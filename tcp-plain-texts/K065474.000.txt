 THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF  Thomas Ellwood  Or an Account of his BIRTH EDUCATION  c  WITH Divers Observations on his Life and Manners when a Youth And how he came to be Convinced of the  Truth  with his many Sufferings and Services for the same Also Several Other  Remarkable Passages  and  Occurrences  Written by his own Hand  To which is added A  SUPPLEMENT By  J W  Heb  By Faith the Elders obtained a good Report  The Second Edition  London  Printed and Sold by the Assigns of  J Sowle  in  White HartCourt  in  GraciousStreet    THE PREFACE  GAther up the Fragments that remain that nothing be Lost  John Was the direction of our  Saviour  to his  Disciples  after he had fed the Multitude Which may well and usefully be applied to the Collecting and Preserving the Accounts of the  Lives  of  Good Men Men  who in their Day have been eminently useful in those Stations of Life wherein  God  by his good  Providence  hath placed them And this preserving by  Publication  is the rather to be done when themselves do leave behind them in Writing an  Account  of their  Lives  and of the  signal Mercies of God  to them therein For  from such  Accounts  may best be gathered by the  Reader  the Man's  particular State Exercise  and  Growth  in the  Work  of  Restoration  out of the  Fall  and  Degeneracy  And in the Reading thereof be not only excited to  Bless the Name of the Lord  on his behalf but also gain some direction from the  Path  so fairly tract out and ground of  Hope  that by being  Faithful  they may likewise attain to the same good  Experience  There is not with me any doubt but something of this kind may be the Lot of many into whose Hands this  Treatise  may happen to come for that they will herein meet with variety of  Exercises  and the  Providences  of God therein all related with great strength and plainness of Speech Our  Deceased  Friend  Thomas Ellwood  having been a Man whom God had endued with  singular Abilities  both as a  Man  and as a  Christian  which is evident not only from this short Account of his  Life  which was written by himself and by the  Supplement  added hereunto  but more largely from his many useful Labours and Services in the many Books which he writ in the Defence of  Truth  and the  Friends  thereof For which  Service  he was in a particular manner qualified by  Spiritual Wisdom  and  Christian Obedience  to which in him was added great strength and depth of  Judgment  wherein he could discern the Spirits of others and was very much the Master of his own as did appear to such who knew him not only by the soundness of his  Reasoning  and the Seasonableness of his  Words  but also by his great and exemplary  Modesty  in that he was not hasty to  propose  nor rudely tenacious to insist on what he had proposed if any thing though not well exprest yet well intended was offered by any one much Weaker nay though but by a  Babe  in  Christ  His  Countenance  was Manly and Chearful His  Deportment  Grave yet Affable and Courteous even to the meanest Person His Conversation Innocent Pleasant  and Instructive yet severe against any thing that was beyond the Liberty of  Truth  These with his other Qualifications of  Body  and  Mind  did render him both very Acceptable and very Useful as a  Friend  as a  Neighbour  and as a  Member  and  Elder  in the  Church of Christ  and the more for that his Time was chiefly Imployed in being Serviceable in one or other of these  Capacities  I might here particularly mention the several  Labours  of our  Deceased Friend  according to their respective Times and the Nature of their several Subjects but much of this being already done in the ensuing Pages I chuse to remit the  Reader  thither by which possibly he may be excited to the Perusal of them and shall only say concerning them  that the Judicious Reader will easily Observe that his Method and Stile do denote him to have been a Scholar And yet not farther so than the Simplicity and Purity of the  Truth  whereof he made Profession would permit him  I was with our Friend  Thomas Ellwood  the greater part of his  Sickness  In which he was also very frequently visited by our Friend  George Bowles  who was his Neighbour to whom therefore I refer for the Account which he may give of his  Sickness  and  Dying Words  As it was my good Lot to be well acquainted with him though only in the latter Years of his Life and know that he did neither use nor encourage the bestowing Elaborate  Encomiums  upon Persons Deceased So neither shall I add further concerning him than to say with the  Apostle  concerning the Faithful  Heb  That he was Righteous God Testifying of his Gifts and by it being Dead yet Speaketh  J W  London  the th  of the  d  Month    George Bowles  his  TESTIMONY  Concerning  Thomas Ellwood  Dear Friends  It is in my Heart briefly on this Occasion to commemorate the  tender Dealings  of the Lord with his People in this latter Age of the World when it hath pleased him in Love to poor lost Man graciously to appear by the breaking forth of his  Glorious Gospel Day  And by the secret divine Reaches of the Hand of God which hath been felt and seen in the Light of it many have been drawn in their Spirits to seek after the Lord and to enquire after the Knowledge of the Way of  Life  and  Salvation  and blessed be his Holy Name who was graciously pleased by the Inshinings of this  Divine Light  in the Hearts of many to expel the  Darkness  and rend the  Vail  And then was the Arm of his mighty Power made bare for the gathering many Thousands to the saving  Knowledge of Himself  And in that Day was the Lord pleased according to his Promise to  pour forth of his Spirit upon Sons and upon Daughters  yea upon Servants and upon Handmaids and many were made to Prophesie and being qualified by the Holy Spirit which they received and were baptized by it into his Name became willing and were freely given up in Obedience to the Lord and in Bowels of tender Love to the Souls of Mankind in his Power to preach the Gospel of Life and Salvation to those to whom they were sent and many  were turned from  Darkness to Light and from the Power of Satan unto God  by their Ministry Amongst whom our dear deceased Friend and Brother  THOMAS ELLWOOD  was one whose Conscience was reached and awakened by the Powerful Ministry of dear  Edward Burrough  as I have heard him relate and as by the following Sheets will more plainly appear And of that Day and Time and the worthy Instrument by whose Ministry he was Convinced and turned unto God and made sensible of the  Divine Principle  of  Life  and  Light  in his own Heart have I heard him speak with great Regard and also of the Sufferings which did attend him after he received the Truth in his Father's Family for the Truth's sake and how the Lord preserved him in that time under the various Exercises which he passed through for Truth's Testimony which for Christ's sake he was Conscientiously Concerned to stand in according to that Plainness and Simplicity which Truth then led and still continues to lead the sincere Disciples of Christ into by which they were distinguished from the World and for the sake thereof they were despised of Men and hated of the World Such was the Plain Language of  Thou  to one and refusing the  HatHonour  For which Dear  T E  suffered not a little in that Day as by the following Account of his Life more fully appears And it were well if all who come up in a Profession of the Blessed Truth in this Time were Faithful in these and in the other Branches of its Testimony And let all consider that the neglecting thereof is in a Degree  a making void the Sufferings of the Faithful and strengthening the Hands of Evil Doers who for the sake of their  Testimony loved not their Lives to the Death  but underwent cruel  Mockings Buffetings Stonings Whippings Stockings Revilings Imprisonments  and  Spoiling of Goods  Rejoycing in the Lord that they were counted worthy to Suffer either less or more for his Name sake In respect of which this my dear  Friend  was a good Example he being a Man of a steady  Mind  and very patient in  Suffering  as well as Faithful in his Testimony for  Truth  and took joyfully the Spoiling of his  Goods  wherein he was tryed but a few Years before his Death He was often Concerned in Defence of Truth's Testimony both against our Professed  Adversaries  and also against the  Libertine Spirit  which appeared in some Professing the same Truth with us who Opposed themselves against that good Order and Discipline which the  Truth  led  Friends  into All which will abundantly appear from the Books themselves which are in Print which he writ upon  Various Occasions  and upon  Divers Subjects  and let not his great Labour and Industry be Forgotten in his writing those Two Historical Volumes relating to the  Old  and  New Testament  A Work truly Great and is and may be of great Use and Service By all which his many Labours it may be perceived by the wary and inlightned  Reader  that the Lord had Endowed him with an excellent Gift and Qualified him for the Service of Truth his Church and People in which he imployed the Talent  which the bountiful Lord had given him to the Honour of the great Giver and to the Comfort and Edification of the Church of Christ But more especially were his Services known to the  Brethren  in this County of  Bucks  Most of which are fallen asleep and but few remaining here who knew him in his beginning or his first Services for the Lord his Church and People amongst whom he was a Zealous Asserter of that excellent Discipline the Lord had opened in and led his People to for the preserving his Church as a Garden enclosed for which cause how did many of those  Libertines  set themselves fiercely against him and shot their Arrows at him but the Lord Defended him and covered his Head in the  Day of Battle and his Bow abode in Strength and his Bough spread over the Wall and continued fresh and green  But a Blast from the Lord came upon their Evil Work And how have they melted away And how is their Strength failed and their Work brought to Naught But the Blessing of the Lord is with his People even with the Faithful to this Day whom he hath preserved as a peculiar Treasure to himself Blessed be his Holy Name for evermore And furthermore it may be truly said of this our dear Friend that as the Lord fitted him for his Service so was he eminently serviceable in his Hand in the Church of Christ particularly in these Parts of which there are many Living Witnesses in this and the adjacent Counties of his great Labour of Love having served the Church Freely with great Diligence and Faithfulness The true sense of which  ucheth me and others with the deeper sense of the  reat Loss the Church hath by his Removal but  eing also sensible through the Lord's Goodness that ur  Loss  is his  Eternal Gain  I feel in my Heart  n humble Submission to the Will of him who doth  hatsoever pleaseth him both in Heaven and in Earth and who shall say unto him  What doest thou  And it is the tender breathing of my Spirit to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ that he would be graciously pleased in Pity and Compassion to his poor People to raise up fit and furnish more faithful Servants for his Work and Service and make them Zealous for his Name and Truth upon the Earth that the place of this my Dear  Friend  and other Faithful Servants of the Lord and his People of late removed from amongst us in these Parts may be supplied and that the Spouse of Christ may amidst all her Tribulations Afflictions and sore Exercises be made to Praise the Lord and Bless his Holy Name who taketh away one and raiseth up another and Blesseth his Children with his Goodness according to his Promise made of Old by the Holy Prophet  Isa    ver  saying  I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed and my Blessing upon thine Offspring  And thus hath the Lord preserved  Zion  from Age to Age And I doubt not but am fully perswaded that he will still Bless his People and Preserve  Zion  and Deliver her from all her Enemies  And my Dear  Friends Brethren  and  Sisters  although it be matter of Sorrow to us to part with our Dear  Friends  especially such as have been  made Serviceable in their Day and have faithfully served the Lord and his People in their Generation as it may I hope without just occasion of Offence to any be said of dear  T E  that he was a Man who served the Lord in  Faithfulness  and his People with  Chearfulness  and his Neighbours with  Uprightness  and  Integrity  And therefore both they and we have the greater Loss Yet may we not sorrow unseasonably as those which sorrow without Hope but believing that the Lord hath taken him to himself in Mercy though it may be in Judgment to some who were unworthy let us all learn Resignation to his blessed Will and say with Holy  Job The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away Blessed be the Name of the Lord  And dear Friends I may farther signifie unto you that it being my Lot to be with this our dear Friend of whom I am speaking almost every day of his last Ilness I did observe in him to my great Comfort and Satisfaction a quiet composed Frame of Mind and Spirit and Resignation to the Will of God When I came first to him which was soon after I heard of his being taken ill which was the th day of the d Month I found him very much disabled by the  Distemper  which was thought to be a  Palsie  that had seized him especially on his right Side so that he could not stand alone nor help himself but a little with his left Hand and his Speech was also very much interrupted insomuch that it was with great difficulty for the most part that he expressed himself so as to be Understood Some time after I came to him there being also other  iends  with him we sate down together under a  ighty Exercise of Spirit waiting upon the Lord  deep Silence with our Eye to him it pleased the  ord eminently to appear amongst us and to fill our  earts with the refreshing Streams of his Divine  ove and to open the Mouth of one of us in Prayer  nd Supplication and the Lord was graciously Pleas  d abundantly to replenish our Spirits to our mutu  Comfort in a Living Sense of Divine Goodness  nd this our  Dear Friend  expressed himself in great  enderness and Brokenness of Spirit on this wise  am sensibly Comforted and Refreshed in this Visit  And that Afternoon he fixing his Eyes upon me with great Earnestness of Spirit expressed as well as he could at that time a great Concern that was upon his Mind for  Truth  and the  Friends  of it in divers Particulars especially in Relation to our own  Monthly  and  QuarterlyMeetings  the  Writings  of both which had been under his Care for more than Fourty Years After which he was much eased in his Spirit and so continued to the last so far as I perceived often saying when asked how he did  I am easie I am quiet  And he was often very tender in his Spirit expressing his Resignation to the Will of God whether in Life or Death saying  If the Lord hath no more Work for me to do I am content and resigned to his Will and my hearty Farewel to all my Brethren  And at another time nearer his End he said to us present in much Brokenness of Heart  I am full of Joy and Peace my Spirit is filled with Joy  or to this Effect  for by reason that his Speech was so weakned sever  things could not be so well collected which he at time  spake in a tender sense of the Lord's Goodness th  sense of which deeply affected some of as who were with him And my Heart is sorrowfully affected at this time in a sense of the great Loss which the Church of Christ in these Parts especially hath by his Removal But in this I am comforted in a living sense of the Lord's Mercy and Goodness towards him in carrying him through his Affliction in great Patience and Quietness under which he was sweetly refreshed by the Streams of Divine Love and his Cup was often made to overflow And we who were present being touched with a Sense thereof were comforted therein being in a Travail of Spirit for him and did in our Measures truly sympathize with him under his Affliction And I am fully satisfied he laid down his Head in Peace with the Lord and is gathered to his everlasting Rest He departed this Life the  st  of the  d Month  about the d Hour in the Morning in the th Year of his Age He received the Truth in the Year and lived in Fellowship with the  Friends  of it about Years And I think it may be truly said of him That as he  Lived  so he  Died  the  Servant of the LORD  and  His People  and hath left a sweet Savour behind him and his  Memory  is blessed with the  Righteous  for ever  Amen  GEORGE BOWLES  The    th Month    A  TESTIMONY  from the  MonthlyMeeting  at  HungerHill  the Seventh Day of the Fourth  Month  Concerning our Dear and Wellbeloved  Friend  and  Brother  in the Truth  Thomas Ellwood  Deceased  THAT the Dead which  Die in the Lord  are Blessed of him we have great Assurance of from  John  the  Divine  his writing to the Seven  Churches  Rev ver Where he tells them that he  Heard a Voice from Heaven saying Write Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth Yea saith the Spirit that they may Rest from their Labours and their Works do follow them  Of which Number we have no Cause to doubt but this our dear friend is one who was eminently Serviceable in the Church of Christ A Man to whom the Lord had given a large Capacity beyond many and furnished him with an excellent Gift whereby he was qualified for those Services in the Church in the performance of which he did shine as a  Star  which received its Luster and Brightness from the Glorious  Sun  of  Righteousness  He was Wise but Humble Condescending to the Weak and ready to Help where he saw and felt Sincerity but Sharp to that which he apprehended to be Insincere and Deceitful for which Cause he was not acceptable to Hypocrites and Disorderly Walkers Yet he was a Man of a very acceptable and agreeable Conversation as well as Sober and Religious both in the Church and in the World being of a free  and affable Temper and Disposition far from Affecta+tion but of a Courteous Behaviour and Graceful Car+riage to all and very Serviceable to and amongst  Neighbours He was very Near and Dear to many  us who were most intimately Acquainted with him and his Memorial is sweet to us His Services in o  Meetings  and in the  Quarterly Meeting  for the County of  Bucks  were very Great and of many Years C  +tinuance in which he shewed great Diligence be  of a ready Mind willing to Serve the Church according to that Ability which the Lord had given him and his Heart and House was open to his  Friends  and the  MonthlyMeeting  was kept there more than Forty Years and remains there to this Day Our Loss is great by his Removal But in this we are satisfied that it is his Everlasting Gain being gathered as we have good Cause to Believe to his Eternal Rest The knowledge we had of him and the good Account which we have received of him in the time of his last Ilness by those who were most constantly with him and of his quiet and peaceable Departure doth sensibly Engage our Hearts to acquiesce in the Will of the Lord and therein we have Peace and Comfort He departed this Life the First of the Third  Month  and was Honourably Buried in  Friends  Burying place at New  Jourdens  in the Parish of  Giles Chalfont  in the County of  Bucks  the Fourth Day of the same Month  Signed by the Appointment of the  MonthlyMeeting  by us  George Bowles  William Grimsdall  James Smith  Daniel Wharley  Daniel Roberts  Abraham Barber  Thomas Olliffe  A  TESTIMONY  from the  WomensMeeting  Concerning  Thomas Ellwood  A Concern is upon our Spirits to write somewhat concerning our dear deceased  Friend  and  El  r Thomas Ellwood  who was highly Valued by  for that Wisdom and Counsel were with him and  ing of a free and affable Temper ready to Assist  ose which stood in need thereof encouraged many to  ply to him for Advice under the divers Circum  nces and various Exercises which this Uncertain  orld affords which we have found to be for our  od as we followed it He was an early Comer to  eetings  seldom hindred by  Weather  though he Liv  Three Miles distant when  Bodily Weakness  did  hinder of late Years being oft indisposed as to his  ealth The  MonthlyMeeting  was held at his  ouse about Forty Years and he always look'd very kind  d Courteous on  Friends  when they came there and  ok Care and Notice of the  Meanest  who came in  ncerity  He was Zealous for  Good Order  and a  inst such who being in an  Apostatized Spirit Op  sed it  and may well be numbred amongst the  Wor  ies  whose Names are upon Record for their  Valour  is this our  Friend  worthy to be who never turned his  ck on such who  Opposed  the  Truth  but stood his  round  as his  Printed Sheets  on such occasions do  w As also his other Works of several kinds do  nifest how great  Endowments  God had bestowed on  Yet we who knew him in his Conversation are  Engaged to set forth how Kind and Condescending he was to the  Weakest Capacity  and would help out when they wanted a  Word  that Generations to come may learn how good it is to  forsake All  and  follow Christ Jesus  as this our  Friend  did and the  Account  of his  Life  following shews who not only  Gives Wisdom  but  Teacheth Humility  also  He was greatly respected by his Neighbours for his Services amongst them his Heart and Doors were open to the  Poor  both  Sick  and  Lame  who wanted  Help  and had it freely taking Care to provide things useful for such  Occasions  blest also with good  Success  often saying  He mattered not what Cost he was at to do Good  Such Lament their  Loss  what then may we do who miss him in an  Higher Station  in his great Service in the  Church of Christ  but even desire to be resigned to the  Will of the Lord  who Preserved him through all his  Hardships  to a  Dominion  over  False Brethren  and is now out of their Reach and of  Temptation  too on whose Head the  Blessing  ask'd for  Joseph  rests who as a Fruitful  Bough  his  Branch  spreads over the  Wall  of  Opposition  and  his Bow abode in Strength the Hands of whose Arms were made Strong by the help of the Mighty God of  Jacob to whom be the  Glory  for what he hath wrought in our Day whose own Works  Praise him  for Evermore And the Tears of  Sorrow  that we shed for the Loss of this our Deceased  Friend  let them be remembred to bow our Spirits each of us into a  Godly Care  that we may com  up according to our several  Capacities  to follow th  Lord  Faithfully  in a  Godly Zeal  for his  Honour  and so come to lay down our Heads in  Joy  and  Peac  as this our  Friend  expressed he did  This Eminent Servant of Christ was Early Convin  +ed of the Way of  Truth  wherein he continued to th  finishing of his Days for the sake of which he soo  became a  Sufferer  not only by  Imprisonment  for  Worshipping God  in the Assemblies of his People but also from his  Father  by whom he was made as an  Outcast  for no other Cause but for his Faithful  Testimony  in taking up the  Cross  to the  Worlds Behaviour  and  Language  Whereupon he was Invited by his much valued Friend  Isaac Penington  to his House where he abode several Years until he  Married  He was a Blessing in as well as a great Comfort and Help to that  Family  and by his wise Conduct therein gained much  Esteem  not only from the  Elders  but the  Youth  whom he Instructed in  Learning  and though most of them are by  Death  Removed yet One still Remains who from Certain and Experimental Knowledge can Commemorate his  Worth  being engaged thereto from a Sense of the  Benefit  of his Good and Wholsom  Advice  given at  Sundry Times  and on  Divers Occasions  Which Friendship continued firm to the Last  His  Natural Capacity  was large and his  Understanding  in the  things of God  very deep which excellent Qualifications meeting in one rendred him useful beyond many to his  Country  as well as very serviceable in the  Church  by both which he is and will be greatly missed But he is gone to his Grave in a full Age and  gathered as a shock of Corn in its Season having done his Days Work Faithfully  So that saying may be verified in him  The END Crowns all  His Sickness was sudden which soon deprived him of the use of his  Limbs  yet he retained the Faculties of his Inward and Outward  Senses  clear all along and notwithstanding at times his Pains were Great his Exemplary  Patience  and Composed Resignation was remarkably apparent to those that Visited and Attended him so that their Sorrow in parting with so dear a Friend was intermixed with Comfort in beholding  the Heavenly Frame of Mind wherewith he was Adorned  Thus after all his Labours he entred into  Everlasting Rest  and left many behind  Weeping  though not without Hope that they shall again meet at the  General Assembly of Saints  where the redeemed shall sing  Praises  to their blessed  Redeemer  whose Right it is to Reign for ever  We have this farther to add namely That our Esteem of him was great because of that real worth that was in him through the Operation of the mighty Power of the Lord that separated him from the  Love  of the  World  So that he chose with  Moses  rather to  suffer Affliction with the People of God than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a Season  and it pleased the Lord to fit him with Wisdom and Counsel so that he was made able to give Judgment in difficult Cases wherein many of us have particularly received Benefit and therefore have cause to lament the loss we have by his Removal And Oh say our Souls That the Lord would raise up many more in his Room to the Praise and Honour of the good  Husbandman  And it is our Desire that we who are yet behind may be made able so to Steer our Course through this troublesome World that when our End comes we may lay down our Heads in Peace with the Lord and leave a good Savour behind us as this our Friend hath done  This is written in true Love and Respect to the Memory of our Deceased  Friend  as it pleased the Lord to move upon our Hearts And being read and approved in our  WomensMeeting  at  Hungerhill  the  th  of the th Month was subscribed in behalf of the said Meeting by us  MARY BAKER  MARY WHARLEY  MARY LARCUM  Concerning our Dear Friend  Thomas Ellwood  of  HungerHill  HE was much esteemed amongst good Men Good Men in their Day and Station upon the Earth represent him who made all things good in the beginning who said  Gen    Let there be Light and there was Light  And also said  ver    Let us make Man in our Image after our Likeness  Oh high Favour  So God created Man in his own Image in the Image of God created he him Male and Female created he them  v and blessed them and gave them Dominion under himself for he was chief Commander then and so he is witnessed to be now where his Heavenly Image is come into again and Men Live in it as did this our  dear Friend  who did good in his  Day  and  Generation Counsel  was with him to give to such as needed and did apply to him He was of a  Tender Spirit  and had Dominion over  Passion  over  Pride  and over  Covetousness  So he was Comfortable to and in his  Family  He was Amiable in the  Church of Christ  and a  Doer of Good  amongst his  Neighbours  And being an  Elder  amongst and with the  Elders  he hath not only obtained a  good Report  but also the  Blessing  in the  Promised Seed  which  bruises the Serpent's Head  He was  Valiant  in suffering for his Testimony which he held in the  Truth  and may not I say  unwearied  in his  Labours  for the setting forth the  Fame  and  Excellency  of it Whereby we see what the  Truth  makes Men to be who do come under the Conduct and Power of it even as  fixed Stars  in the  firmament  of his  Divine Power  who has caused the  Morning  of his  Heavenly  and  Glorious GospelDay to break forth  and as with the  Day that springs from on High  in  tender Mercy  hath he  visited many  Souls  And early did this our  Worthy deceased Friend  Embrace it as it appears by his Testimony con+cerning that Eminent and Blessed Messenger and M  nister of the  Gospel G F  And now he having endured the Times of Proving  and the Days of Tribulation and Suffering togethe  with the Perils and Slights and Undervaluings of  Fal  Brethren  against whose Ungodly Work he was en+gaged to stand as a noble Warrior in the defence of and for the glorious Gospel of Christ Not admiring Mens Persons but the Work of the GospelPower And altho' he was endowed with Parts and Accomplishment  above many he was Humble and Grave not Selfseek+ing but esteeming the Power of Truth tho' it did appear through mean Instruments He was Honourable and Honoured for that he sought not his own Honour  but the Honour of Truth not only by his Sufferings fo  it and Labours in it but also in standing firmly a+gainst the loose Libertine Ones who would have thrust in amongst the Lambs and Flock of Christ i  an unclean adulterating Spirit from the Life of the true Shepherd and heavenly Husband Christ Jesus But to the tender Hearted and sincere Minded he was Strengthening and Comfortable I knew him when  was but Young and I can truly say my Heart has often been affected on his behalf with Thankfulness to the Lord who made him as a strong Pillar in his spiritual House with many more of his dear Servants and Children who shall no more go out His Memory is in my Heart esteemed beyond what I can Write Oh surely  The Righteous shall be had in Everlasting Remembrance  Psal  And they that be Wise shall shine as the brightness of the Firmament And they that turn many to Righteousness as the Stars for Ever and Ever  Dan  ELIZ RICHARDSON  Hunger Hill  the    th of the    th Month    Richard Vivers  his Testimony Concerning  Thomas Ellwood  HE was a Man of great Wisdom and Understanding and the Lord the Giver of it being pleased to visit him in his early Days made choice of him▪ and by the Sanctification of his Holy Spirit fitted and prepared him for his  Work  and  Service  whereunto he was called And although he did not often appear as a  Minister  Yet in those Meetings set apart for the Affairs of  Truth  he often appeared in great  Wisdom  having an extraordinary Talent given of the Lord for that  Work  more than many other Brethren And faithful he was in waiting for Instruction from God to improve the same to  his Glory  and the  Churches Advantage  for nothing was more desirable to him than to be imployed in the  Lord's Service  So it pleased the  Almighty  to furnish him with  Understanding  and  Strength  faithfully to do his Days work And now he hath taken him to himself where his Soul is at Rest and although our Loss be his Gain therein I with many more are greatly comforted for I can truly say I loved him in the Truth from the First of my acquaintance with him and so it remained to the End of his Course being near Fourty Years since we knew each other And when ever we conversed together our Discourse was chiefly concerning  Heavenly Things  and the Affairs of the  Church  and I always thought my Time well spent with him although opportunity would not serve for so much of it as I desired had it been the Will of God  And this I can say according to my Observation He was a Man  True  to his  Friend  and deliberate in the Choice of his  Acquaintance  to whom he shewed real Love and sincerity of Heart And he was one of a steady and sound  Judgment  as to the things of God often desiring that those who came amongst us especially Children of Believing Parents might not settle down only in a  Form  of  Godliness  without the  Power  at which Door the  Apostacy  entred but that they might be raised up to walk in that wherein the  Saints  Fellowship doth stand which is the  Light of our Lord Jesus Christ  enlightening  every Man that cometh into the World  And then the Ancient  Testimony of Truth  will be more and more raised up in their Hearts and they being Preserved of the Lord in it it will more be maintained in its several Branches as in former Days Blessed be the Name of the  Lord  who hath a People in these latter Ages of the World to whom he hath given  Power  to stand for his  Truth whilst on Earth  and to be  Tender  of the  Honour of his Name  of the Number of whom this our  Deceased Friend  and  Brother  was who although  Dead  yet his Memory  Liveth  and will be preserved amongst the  Righteous  in  Generations yet to come  RICHARD VIVERS  Banbury  the  th  of the  th Month    An  INDEX  of the Names

being so Eminent either in the Church of Christ or in the World as others who have moved in higher Orbs may not afford such considerable Remarks as theirs yet inasmuch as in the Course of my Travels through this Vale of Tears I have passed through various and some uncommon Exercises which the Lord hath been graciously pleased to support me under and conduct me  hrough I hold it a matter excusable at least  f not commendable to give the World some  ittle Account of my Life that in Recounting  he many Deliverances and Preservations which the Lord hath vouchsafed to work for  me both I by a grateful Acknowledgmen  thereof and Return of Thanksgivings unt  him therefore may in some measure set forth hi  abundant Goodness to me and others whos  Lot it may be to tread the same Path and fal  into the same or like Exercises may be encou+raged to persevere in the way of Holines  and with full assurance of Mind to trust in th  Lord whatsoever Trials may befal them  To begin therefore with mine own Begin+ning I was Born in the Year of our Lord about the Beginning of the  Eighth Mont  so far as I have been able to inform my self  for the Parish  Register  which relates to th  time not of Birth but of  Baptism  as the  call it is not to be relied on  The Place of my Birth was a little Countr  Town called  Crowell  situate in the upper sid  of  Oxfordshire  Three Miles Eastward fro  Thame  the nearest MarketTown  My Father's Name was  Walter Ellwood  an  my Mothers MaidenName was  Elizabeth P  +man  both well descended but of declinin  Families So that what my Father Possesse  which was a pretty Estate in Lands and mo  as I have heard in Monies he received as h  had done his Name  Walter  from his Grandf  +ther  Walter Gray  whose Daughter and onl  Child was his Mother  In my very Infancy when I was but abo  two Years Old I was carried to  London  F  the  Civil War  between  King  and  Parliamen  breaking then forth my Father who favou  +ed  the ParliamentSide though he took not Arms not holding himself safe at his Country Habitation which lay too near some Garisons of the King's betook himself to  London  that City then holding for the Parliament  There was I bred up though not without much Difficulty the City Air not agreeing with my tender Constitution and there continued until  Oxford  was surrendred and the War in Appearance ended  In this time my Parents contracted an Acquaintance and intimate Friendship with the Lady  Springett  who being then the Widow of Sir  William Springett  who died in the Parliament Service was afterwards the Wife of  Isaac Penington  Eldest Son of Alderman  Penington  of  London  And this Friendship devolving from the Parents to the Children I became an early and Particular Playfellow to her Daughter  Gulielma  being admitted as such to ride with her in her little Coach drawn by her Footman about  Lincoln'sInnFields  I mention this in this Place because the Continuation of that Acquaintance and Friendship having been an Occasional Means of my being afterwards brought to the Knowledge of the Blessed TRUTH I shall have frequent Cause in the Course of the following Discourse to make honourable Mention of that Family to which I am under so many and great Obligations  Soon after the Surrender of  Oxford  my Father returned to his Estate at  Crowell  which  by that time he might have need enough to look after having spent I suppose the great+est Part of the Monies which had been left him by his Grandfather in maintaining himsel  and his Family at an high Rate in  London  My elder Brother for I had one Brothe  and two Sisters all elder than my self was  while we lived in  London  Boarded at a privat  School in the House of one  Francis Atkinson  a  a Place called  Hadley  near  Barnet  in  Hertford+shire  where he had made some good Profici+ency in the  Latin  and  French  Tongues But af+ter we had left the City and were resettled i  the Country he was taken from that privat  School and sent to the Free School at  Tham  in  Oxfordshire  Thither also was I sent as soon as my ten+der Age would permit for I was indeed bu  young when I went and yet seemed younge  than I was by reason of my low and little Sta+ture For it was held for some Years a doubt+ful Point whether I should not have proved a Dwarf But after I was arrived to the Fif+teenth Year of my Age or thereabouts I be+gan to shoot up and gave not over growing  till I had attained the middle Size and Statu  of Men  At this School which at that time was i  good Reputation I profited apace havin  then a natural Propensity to Learning so tha  at the first reading over of my Lesson I com+monly made my self Master of it And y  which is strange to think of few Boys in th  chool wore out more Birch than I For tho'  was never that I remember whip't upon  he Score of not having my Lesson ready or of not saying it well yet being a little busie Boy full os Spirit of a working Head and  ctive Hand I could not easily conform my self to the grave and sober Rules and as I  hen thought severe Orders of the School but was often playing one waggish Prank or other among my FellowScholars which subjected me to Correction so that I have come under the Discipline of the Rod twice in a Forenoon Which yet brake no Bones  Had I been continued at this School and in due time preferred to an higher I might in likelihood have been a Scholar for I was observed to have a Genius apt to learn But my Father having so soon as the  RepublicanGovernment  began to settle accepted the Office of a Justice of the Peace which was no way Beneficial but meerly Honorary and every way Expensive and put himself into a Port and Course of Living agreeable thereunto and having also removed my Brother from  Thame  School to  Merton  Colledge in  Oxford  and entred him there in the highest and most chargeable Condition of a  FellowCommoner  he found it needful to retrench his Expences elsewhere the Hurt of which fell upon me For he thereupon took me from School to save the Charge of Maintaining me there which was somewhat like plucking green Fruit from the Tree and laying it by before it was come to its due Ripeness  which will thenceforth shrink and wi+ther and lose that little Juice and Relish which it began to have  Even so it fared with me For being taken home when I was but young and before I was well settled in my Studies though I had made a good Progress in the  Latin  Tongue and was entred in the  Greek  being left too much to my self to ply or play with my Books or without them as I pleased I soon shook Hands with my Books by shaking my Books out of my Hands and laying them by degrees quite aside and addicted my self to such youthfu  Sports and Pleasures as the Place afforded and my Condition could reach unto  By this Means in a little time I began to lose that little Learning I had acquired at School and by a continued disuse of my Books became at length so utterly a Stranger to Learning that I could not have read far less have understood a Sentence in  Latin  Which I was so sensible of that I warily avoided reading to others even in an  English  Book lest if I should meet with a  Latin  Word I should shame my self by mispronouncing it  Thus I went on taking my Swing in such vain Courses as were accounted harmless Recreations entertaining my Companions and familiar Acquaintance with pleasant Discourses in our Conversations by the meer Force of MotherWit and Natural Parts without the Help of SchoolCultivation and was accounted good Company too  But I always sorted my self with Persons of  ngenuity Temperance and Sobriety for I  athed Scurrilities in Conversation and had a  atural Aversion to Immoderate Drinking So  at in the Time of my greatest Vanity I was  reserved from Prophanness and the grosser E  ils of the World which render'd me accept  ble to Persons of the best Note in that Coun  ry then I often waited on the Lord  Wenman  t his House  Thame  Park about two Miles  rom  Crowell  where I lived to whose Favour held my self intituled in a twofold Respect  oth as my Mother was nearly related to his Lady and as he had been pleased to bestow his Name upon me when he made large Promises  or me at the Font He was a Person of great Honour and Virtue and always gave me a kind Reception at his Table how often soever I came And I have cause to think I should have received from this Lord some advantageous Preferment in this World as soon as he had found me capable of it though betwixt him and my Father there was not then so good an Understanding as might have been wish'd had I not been in a little time after called into the Service of the best and highest Lord and thereby lost the Favour of all my Friends Relations and Acquaintance of this World To the Account of which most happy Exchange I hasten and therefore willingly pass over many Particularities of my youthful Life Yet one Passage I am willing to mention for the Effect it had upon me afterwards which was thus  My Father being then in the Commission  the Peace and going to a  PettySessions  at  Wa  +lington  I waited on him thither And whe  we came near the Town the Coachman see+ing a nearer and easier Way than the commo  Road through a Corn Field and that it wa  wide enough for the Wheels to run withou  endammaging the Corn turned down there  Which being observed by an Husbandma  who was at Plow not far off he ran to us an  stopping the Coach poured forth a Mouthfu  of Complaints in none of the best Language  for driving over the Corn My Father mild+ly answered him That if there was an Offenc  committed he must rather impute it to hi  Servant than himself since he neither direct+ed him to drive that Way nor knew whic  way he drove Yet added that he was going to such an Inn at the Town whither if h  came he would make him full Satisfaction fo  whatsoever Dammage he had sustained thereby And so on we went the Man venting his Discontent as he went back in angry Accents At the Town upon enquiry we understood that it was a way often used and without Dammage being broad enough but that it was not the common Road which yet lay not far from it and was also good enough Wherefore my Father bid his Man drive Home that way  It was late in the Evening when we returned and very dark and this quarrelsome Man who had troubled himself and us in the Morning  having gotten another lusty Fellow like  mself to assist him waylay'd us in the  ight expecting we would return the same  ay we came But when they found we did  ot but took the common Way they angry  at they were disappointed and loth to lose  eir Purpose which was to put an Abuse up  us coasted over to us in the dark and lay  g hold on the Horses Bridles stopt them from  oing on My Father asking his Man what  e Reason was that he went not on was an  wered  That there were two Men at the Horses  eads who held them back and would not suffer  em to go forward  Whereupon my Father o  ening the Boot step't out and I followed close  his Heels Going up to the place where  e Men stood he demanded of them the  eason of this Assault They said  We were  pon the Corn  We knew by the Routs we  ere not on the Corn but in the common way nd told them so But they told us  They were esolved they would not let us go on any farther but  ould make us go back again  My Father endea  oured by gentle Reasoning to perswade them  forbear and not run themselves farther into  he Danger of the Law which they were run  oo far into already but they rather derided  im for it Seeing therefore fair Means would  ot work upon them he spake more roughly  o them charging them to deliver their Clubs  for each of them had a great Club in his Hand  omewhat like those which are called  Quarter  taves  They thereupon laughing told him  They did not bring them thither for that En  Thereupon my Father turning his Head to m  said  Tom Disarm them  I stood ready at his Elbow waiting only fo  the Word of Command For being naturall  of a bold Spirit full then of youthful Hea  and that too heightned by the Sence I had no  only of the Abuse but insolent Behaviour o  those rude Fellows my Blood began to boy  and my Fingers itch'd as the Saying is to b  dealing with them Wherefore stepping bold+ly forward to lay hold on the Staff of him tha  was nearest to me I said  Sirrah Deliver you  Weapon  He thereupon raised his Club whic  was big enough to have knock't down an Ox  intending no doubt to have knock't me dow  with it as probably he would have done ha  I not in the twinkling of an Eye whip't o  my Rapier and made a Pass upon him  could not have failed running of him throug  up to the Hilt had he stood his Ground b  the suddain and unexpected Sight of my brigh  Blade glistering in the dark Night did so a+maze and terrifie the Man that slipping asid  he avoided my Thrust and letting his Sta  sink betook himself to his Heels for Safety  which his Companion seeing fled also I fo  +lowed the former as fast as I could but  Tim  addidit Alas  Fear gave him Wings and mad  him swiftly fly so that although I was accoun  +ed very nimble yet the farther we ran th  more ground he gain'd on me so that I coul  not overtake him which made me think h  k shelter under some Bush which he knew  ere to find though I did not Mean while  e Coachman who had sufficiently the outside  a Man excus'd himself from intermedling  der pretence that he durst not leave his  rses and so left me to shift for my self  d I was gone so far beyond my Knowledge  t I understood not which way I was to go  by Hollowing and being Hollowed to a  in I was directed where to find my Company  We had easie Means to have found out who  se Men were the principal of them having  en in the Day time at the Inn and both  arrelled with the Coachman and threatned  be even with him when he went back but  ce they came off no better in their Attempt  y Father thought it better not to know them  an to oblige himself to a Prosecutiou of them  At that time and for a good while after I  d no regret upon my Mind for what I had  ne and designed to have done in this Case  t went on in a sort of Bravery resolving to  l if I could any Man that should make  e like Attempt or put any Affront upon us  d for that reason seldom went afterwards  on those publick Services without a loaded  stol in my Pocket But when it pleased the  ord in his infinite Goodness to call me out  the Spirit and Ways of the World and give  e the Knowledge of his saving Truth where  y the Actions of my forepast Life were set in  der before me a sort of Horror seized on me  hen I considered how near I had been to the  staining of my Hands with Human Blood A  whensoever afterwards I went that way a  indeed as often since as the Matter has come i  to my remembrance my Soul has blessed t  Lord for my Deliverance and Thanksgivin  and Praises have arisen in my Heart as no  at the relating of it they do to Him w  preserved and withheld me from sheddi  Man's Blood Which is the Reason for whi  I have given this Account of that Action th  others may be warned by it  About this time my dear and Honoured M  who was indeed a Woman of singular Wor  and Virtue departed this Life having a litt  before heard of the Death of her eldest Son w  falling under the Displeasure of my Fath  for refusing to resign his Interest in an Estat  which my Father sold and thereupon desiri  that he might have Leave to Travel in hop  that Time and Absence might work a Recon  +liation went into  Ireland  with a Person po  +erful there in those Times by whose Means  was quickly preferred to a Place of Trust a  Profit but lived not long to Enjoy it  I mentioned before that during my Father  Abode in  London  in the time of the  Civil Wa  he contracted a Friendship with the Lady  Spri  +gett  then a Widow and afterwards Marri  to  Isaac Penington  Esq  To continue which  sometimes Visited them at their CountryLodg  ings as at  Datchet  and at  Causham Lodge  nea  Reading  And having heard that they we  come to live upon their own Estate at  Chalfo  Buckinghamshire  about Fifteen Miles from  well  he went one Day to Visit them there  d to return at Night taking me with him  But very much surpized we were when  ing come thither we first heard then found  ey were become  Quakers  a People we had  Knowledge of and a Name we had till  en scarce heard of  So great a Change from a free debonair  d courtly sort of Behaviour which we for  erly had found them in to so strict a Gra  ty as they now received us with did not a  tle amuse us and disappoint our Expectation  f such a pleasant Visit as we used to have and  ad now promised our selves Nor could my  ather have any Opportunity by a private  onference with them to understand the Ground or Occasion of this Change there be  g some other Strangers with them related to  saac Penington  who came that Morning from  ondon  to Visit them also  For my Part I sought and at length found Means to cast my self into the Company of the Daughter whom I found gathering some Flowers in the Garden attended by her Maid who was also a  Quaker  But when I addressed my self to her after my accustomed Manner with Intention to engage her in some Discourse which might introduce Conversation on the Foot of our former Acquaintance though she treated me with a Courteous Mein yet as young as she was the Gravity of her Look and Behaviour struck such an Awe upon me that  I found my self not so much Master of my s  as to pursue any further Converse with h  Wherefore asking Pardon for my Boldness  having intruded my self into her private Wa  I withdrew not without some Disorder a  thought at least of Mind  We stay'd Dinner which was very ha  some and lacked nothing to recommend it  me but the want of Mirth and pleasant D  course which we could neither have w  them nor by reason of them with one a  +ther amongst our selves the Weightiness t  was upon their Spirits and Countenances kee  +ing down the Lightness that would have be  up in us We stay'd notwithstanding till t  rest of the Company took leave of them a  then we also doing the same returned n  greatly satisfied with our Journey nor kno  +ing what in particular to find fault with  Yet this good Effect that Visit had upon m  Father who was then in the Commission f  the Peace that it disposed him to a more f  +vourable Opinion of and Carriage towards tho  People when they came in his way as not lo  after one of them did For a young Man wh  lived in  Buckinghamshire  came on a  First Day  to the Church so called at a Town calle  Chinner  a Mile from  Crowell  having it seem  a Pressure on his Mind to say something to th  Minister of that Parish He being an Acquain  +tance of mine drew me sometimes to hea  him as it did then The young Man stood i  the Isle before the Pulpit all the Time of th  rmon not speaking a Word till the Sermon  d Prayer after it was ended and then spake  few Words to the Priest Of which all that  could hear was That  The Prayer of the Wicked  Abomination to the Lord  and  that God heareth  t Sinners  Somewhat more I think he did say which  could not distinctly hear for the Noise the  eople made and more probably he would  ave said had he not been Interrupted by the  fficers who took him into Custody and led  im out in order to carry him before my Fa  er  When I understood that I hastened home  at I might give my Father a fair Account of  e Matter before they came I told him the  oung Man behaved himself quietly and peace  +bly spake not a Word till the Minister had  uite done his Service and that what he then  ake was but short and was delivered with  ut Passion or ill Language This I knew would furnish my Father with a fair Ground whereon to discharge the Man if he would  And accordingly when they came and made  high Complaint against the Man who said  ittle for himself my Father having Examined the Officers who brought him what the Words that he spake were which they did not well agree in and at what time he spake them which they all agreed to be after the Minister had done and then whether he gave the Minister any reviling Language or endeavoured to raise a Tumult among the People  which they could not charge him with  finding that he had broken the Law he Cou  selled the young Man to be careful that he d  not make or occasion any publick Disturbance  and so dismissed him Which I was glad of  Some time after this my Father having go  +ten some further Account of the People calle  Quakers  and being desirous to be informed co  +cerning their Principles made another Visit  Isaac Penington  and his Wife at their Hou  called the  Grange  in  Peter  's  Chalfont  and to  both my Sisters and me with him  It was in the  Tenth Month  in the Year  that we went thither where we found a ve  kind Reception and tarried some Days o  Day at least the longer for that while w  were there a Meeting was appointed at  Place about a Mile from thence to which w  were invited to go and willingly went  It was held in a FarmHouse called  T  Grove  which having formerly been a Ge  +tleman's Seat had a very large Hall and th  well filled  To this Meeting came  Edward Burrough  b  +sides other Preachers as  Thomas Curtis  an  James Nailor  but none spake there at tha  Time but  Edward Burrough  Next to who  as it were under him it was my Lot to sit o  a Stool by the Side of a long Table on whic  he sate and I drank in his Words with D  +sire for they not only Answered my Under+standing but warmed my Heart with a cer+tain  Heat which I had not till then felt from  he Ministry of any Man  When the Meeting was ended our Friends  ook us home with them again and after Sup  er the Evenings being long the Servants of  he Family who were  Quakers  were called in  nd we all sate down in Silence But long we  ad not so sate before  Edward Burrough  began  o speak among us And although he spake  ot long yet what he said did touch as I sup  ose my Father's Religious Copyhold as the  hrase is And he having been from his  outh a Professor though not join'd in that which is call'd  Close Communion  with any one Sort and valuing himself upon the Knowledge  e esteemed himself to have in the various Notions of each Profession thought he had now a fair Opportunity to display his Knowledge and thereupon began to make Objections against what had been delivered  The Subject of the Discourse was  The universal free Grace of God to all Mankind  To which he opposed the  Calvinistical Tenet  of  Particular  and  Personal  Predestination  In defence of which indefensible Notion he found imself more at a Loss than he expected  Edward Burrough  said not much to him upon it though what he said was close and cogent But  James Nailor  interposing handled the Subject with so much Perspicuity and clear Demonstration that his Reasoning seemed to be irresistable and so I supposemy Father found it which made him willing to drop the Discourse  As for  Edward Burrough  he was a Bri  young Man of a ready Tongue and migh  have been for ought I then knew a Schola  which made me the less to admire his way o  Reasoning But what drop't from  James Na  +lor  had the greater Force upon me because h  look'd but like a plain simple CountryMa  having the Appearance of an Husbandman o  a Shepherd  As my Father was not able to maintain th  Argument on his Side so neither did the  seem willing to drive it on to an Extremity o  their side But treating him in a soft an  gentle Manner did after a while let fall th  Discourse and then we withdrew to our re+spective Chambers  The next Morning we prepared to retur  Home that is my Father my younger Siste  and my self for my elder Sister was gone be+fore by the Stage Coach to  London  An  when having taken our Leaves of our Friend  we went forth they with  Edward Burroug  accompanying us to the Gate he there direct+ed his Speech in a few Words to each of u  severally according to the Sense he had o  our several Conditions And when we were gone off and they gone in again they asking him what he thought of us he answered them as they afterwards told me to this Effect  As for the Old Man he is settled on his Lees and the Young Woman is light and airy but the Young Man is Reach't and may do well if he don't lose it  And surely that which he said to me or  rather that Spirit in which he spake it took such fast hold on me that I felt Sadness and Trouble come over me though I did not distinctly understand what I was troubled for I knew not what I ayled but I knew I ayled something more than ordinary and my Heart was very heavy  I found it was not so with my Father and Sister for as I rode after the Coach I could hear them talk pleasantly one to the other but they could not discern how it was with me because I riding on Horsback kept much out of Sight  By that time we got home it was Night And the next Day being the first Day of the Week I went in the Afternoon to hear the Minister of  Chinner  and this was the last time I ever went to hear any of that Function After the Sermon I went with him to his House and in a Freedom of Discourse which from a certain Intimacy that was between us I commonly used with him told him where I had been what Company I had met with there and what Observations I had made to my self thereupon He seemed to understand as little of them as I had done before and civilly abstained from casting any unhandsome Reflections on them  I had a Desire to go to another Meeting of the  Quakers  and bid my Father's Man enquire if there was any in the Country thereabouts He thereupon told me he had heard at  Isaac  Penington  's that there was to be a Meeting at  HighWiccomb  on  Thursday  next  Thither therefore I went though it was Seven Miles from me And that I might be rather thought to go out a Coursing than to a Meeting I let my GrayHound run by my Horseside  When I came there and had set up my Horse at an Inn I was at a Loss how to find the House where the Meeting was to be I knew it not and was ashamed to ask after it Wherefore having order'd the Horstler to take Care of my Dog I went into the Street and stood at the InnGate musing with my self what Course to take But I had not stood long e're I saw an Horseman riding along the Street whom I remember'd I had seen before at  Isaac Penington  's and he put up his Horse at the same Inn Him therefore I resolved to follow supposing he was going to the Meeting as indeed he was  Being come to the House which proved to be  John Raunce  's I saw the People sitting together in an outer Room wherefore I stept in and sate down on the first void Seat the End of a Bench just within the Door having my Sword by my Side and Black Cloaths on which drew some Eyes upon me It was not long e're one stood up and spake whom I was afterwards well acquainted with his Name was  Samuel Thornton  and what he spake was very suitable and of good Service to me for  it reached Home as if it had been directed to me  As soon as ever the Meeting was ended and the People began to rise I being next the Door step't out quickly and hastning to my Inn took Horse immediately homewards and so far as I remember my having been gone was not taken Notice of by my Father  This latter Meeting was like the Clinching of a Nail confirming and fastening in my Mind those good Principles which had sunk into me at the former My Understanding began to open and I felt some Stirrings in my Breast tending to the Work of a New Creation in me The general Trouble and Confusion of Mind which had for some Days lain heavy upon me and pressed me down without a distinct Discovery of the particular Cause for which it came began now to wear off and some Glimmerings of Light began to break forth in me which let me see my Inward State and Condition towards God The Light which before had shone in my Darkness and the Darkness could not comprehend it began now to shine out of Darkness and in some Measure discovered to me what it was that had before clouded me and brought that Sadness and Trouble upon me And now I saw that although I had been in a great degree preserved from the common Immoralities and gross Pollutions of the World yet the Spirit of the World had hitherto ruled in me and led me into Pride Flattery Vanity and Superfluity  all which was Naught I found there were many Plants growing in me which were not of the  Heavenly Father's Planting  and that all these of whatever sort or kind they were or how specious soever they might appear must be plucked up  Now was all my former Life ripped up and my Sins by Degrees were set in order before me And though they looked not with so black a Hue and so deep a Dye as those of the lewdest Sort of People did Yet I found that all Sin even that which had the fairest or finest shew as well as that which was more course and foul brought Guilt and  with  and  for Guilt  Condemnation on the Soul that sinned This I felt and was greatly bowed down under the Sense thereof  Now also did I receive a New Law an  Inward Law  superadded to the  Outward    The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus  which wrought in me against all Evil not only  in Deed  and  in Word  but even  in Thought  also so that every thing was brought to Judgment and Judgment passed upon all So that I could not any longer go on in my former Ways and Course of Life for when I did Judgment took hold upon me for it  Thus the Lord was graciously pleased to deal with me in somewhat like manner as he had dealt with his People  Israel  of Old when they had transgressed his Righteous LAW whom by his Prophet he called back required  to put away the Evil of their Doings  bidding them First  Cease to Do Evil  Then  Learn to Do Well  before He would admit them to  Reason with Him  and before he would impart to them the  Effects of His free Mercy  Isa  I was now required by this  Inward  and  Spiritual LAW The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus  to  put away the Evil of my Doings  and  to Cease to do Evil  And what in Particulars the  Evil  was which I was required to  to put away  and  to cease from  that Measure of the  Divine  LIGHT which was now manifested in me discovered to me and what the Light made manifest to be  Evil  Judgment passed upon  So that here began to be a Way cast up before me for me to walk in A direct and plain Way so plain  that a wayfaringMan  how weak and simple soever  though a Fool  to the Wisdom and in the Judgment of the World  could not Err  while he continued to walk in it the Error  coming in  by his  going out of it  And this Way with respect to me I saw was that Measure of  Divine Light  which was manifested in me by which the  Evil of my Doings  which I was to put away and to cease from was discovered to me  By this  Divine Light  then I saw that though I had not the Evil of the  common Uncleanness  bauchery Prophanness  and  Pollutions of the  rld  to  put away  because I had through the  at  Goodness of GOD  and a  Civil Educa    been preserved out of those  grosser Evils  yet I had many other Evils to  put away  and  cease from  some of which were not by t  World  which lies in Wickedness  Joh  accounted  Evils  but by the  Light of Chr  were made manifest to me to be  Evils  and  such condemned in me  As particularly Those  Fruits  and  Effects  PRIDE  that discover themselves in the  +nity  and  Superfluity  of APPAREL which I far as my Ability would extend to took ala  too much Delight in This  Evil of my Doi  I was required  to put away  and  cease from  a  Judgment lay upon me till I did so Whe  +fore in Obedience to the  Inward Law  whi  agreed with the  Outward    Tim    P    Tim    Jam  I took  from my Apparel those unnecessary Trimmin  of  Lace Ribbands  and  useless Buttons  whi  had no real Service but were set on only  that which was by mistake called  Orname  And I ceased to wear  Rings  Again  The giving of flattering Titles to Me  between whom and me there was not any R  +lation to which such Titles could be preten  +ed to belong This was an  Evil  I had be  much addicted to and was accounted a read  Artist in therefore this  Evil  also was I  +quired to  put away  and  cease from  So th  thenceforward I durst not say  Sir Master M  Lord Madam  or  My Dame  or say  Your Se  +vant  to any one to whom I did not stand i  the real Relation of a Servant which I ha  never done to any  Again  Respect of Persons  in Uncovering the  ead  and  Bowing  the  Knee  or  Body  in  Saluta  ns  was a Practice I had been much in the  se of And this being one of the  Vain Customs  the World introduced by the Spirit of the World instead of the true  Honour  which this  a false Representation of and used in Deceit  a Token of  Respect  by Persons one to another  ho bear no  real Respect  one to another And  esides This being a  Type  and proper  Emblem  f that  Divine Honour  which all ought to pay  o  Almighty GOD  and which all of all sorts  who take upon them the  Christian Name  ap  ear in when they offer their Prayers to Him  nd therefore should not be given to Men I  ound this to be one of those  Evils  which I had  een too long doing therefore I was now re  uired to put it away and cease from it  Again  The Corrupt and Unsound Form of Speak  g in the Plural Number to a Single Person YOU  o One  instead of  THOU  contrary to the  Pure Plain  and  Single Language of  TRUTH  THOU  to  One  and  YOU  to more than  One  which had always been used by  GOD  to  Men  and  Men  to  GOD  as well as one to ano  er from the oldest Record of Time till  Cor  pt Men  for  Corrupt Ends  in later and  Corrupt Times  to  Flatter Fawn  and  work  upon the  Corrupt Nature  in  Men  brought in that false and senseless Way of Speaking  YOU  to  One  which hath since corrupted the  Modern Languages  and hath greatly debased the Spirits and depraved the Manners of Men This  Evil Custom  I had been as forward in as others  and this I was now called out of and require  to cease from  These and many more  Evil Customs  whic  had sprang up in the Night of Darkness an  general Apostacy from the TRUTH and Tru  RELIGION were now by the Inshining o  this pure Ray of  Divine Light  in my Conscience  gradually Discovered to me to be what I ough  to cease from shun and stand a Witness against  But so subtilly and withal so powerfully  did the Enemy work upon the weak Part in me as to perswade me that in these things I ought to make a Difference between my Father and all other Men And that therefore though I did disuse these Tokens of Respect to others yet I ought still to use them towards him as he was my Father And so far did this Wile of his prevail upon me through a Fear lest I should do amiss in withdrawing any sort of Respect or Honour from my Father which was due unto him that being thereby beguiled I continued for a while to demean my self in the same manner towards him with respect both to  Language  and  Gesture  as I had always done before And so long as I did so standing  Bare  before him and giving him the accustomed Language he did not express whatever he thought any Dislike of me  But as to my self and the Work begun in me I found it was not enough for me to  Cease to do Evil  though that was a good and a great Step I had another Lesson before me which  To learn to do well  which I could by no  ns do till I had given up with full Purpose  Mind to  Cease from doing Evil  And when  d done that the Enemy took Advantage of  Weakness to mislead me again  or whereas I ought to have waited in the  t for Direction and Guidance into and  e Way of  WellDoing  and not to have mo  till the  Divine Spirit  a Manifestation of  ich the Lord hath been pleased to give unto  e for me to profit with or by the Enemy  nsforming himself into the Appearance of an  gel of Light offered himself in that Ap  arance to be my Guide and Leader into the  erformance of  Religious Exercises  And I  t then knowing the Wiles of Satan and be  eager to be doing some acceptable Service to  too readily yielded my self to the Con  of my Enemy instead of my Friend  He thereupon humouring the warmth and  of my Spirit put me upon Religious Per  mances  in my own Will in my own Time  and  my own Strength  which in themselves were  od and would have been profitable unto me  d acceptable unto the Lord if they had been  ormed  in His Will in His Time  and in the  ity  which  He gives  But being wrought in  Will of Man and at the prompting of the  il One  no wonder that it did me Hurt in  d of Good  Read abundantly in the BIBLE and  ld set my self Tasks in Reading injoying  self to Read so many Chapters sometimes  an whole Book or long Epistle at a tim  And I thought that time well spent though  was not much the wiser for what I had Rea  reading it too cursorily and without the tr  Guide the  Holy Spirit  which alone could op  the Understanding and give the true Sense  what was Read  I Prayed often and drew out my Prayers  a great length and appointed unto my self ce  +tain set Times to Pray at and a certain Nu  +ber of Prayers to say in a Day yet knew no  mean while what true Prayer was Whi  stands not in Words though the Words whi  are uttered in the  Movings  of the  Holy Spirit  a  very available but in the breathing of th  Soul to the Heavenly Father through the Ope  +ation of the  Holy Spirit  who maketh  Intercessi  sometimes in Words and sometimes with Sig  and Groans only which the Lord vouchsafes  hear and Answer  This  WillWorship  which all is that is pe  +formed in the Will of Man and not in th  Movings of the  Holy Spirit  was a great Hu  to me and Hinderance of my Spiritual Growt  in the Way of Truth But my Heavenly Fa+ther who knew the Sincerity of my Soul t  Him and the hearty Desire I had to Serve Him  had Compassion on me and in due time wa  graciously pleased to  Illuminate  my Understand+ing farther and to open in me an Eye to discer  the  False Spirit  and its way of Working fro  the  True  and to reject the former and cleav  to the latter  But though the Enemy had by his Subtilty  in'd such Advantages over me yet I went on  twithstanding and firmly persisted in my  odly Resolution of ceasing from and deny  g those things which I was now Convinced  my Conscience were Evil And on this Ac  unt a great Trial came quickly on me For  e  General QuarterSessions  for the Peace com  g on my Father willing to excuse himself  m a dirty Journey commanded me to get  betimes and go to  Oxford  and deliver in  e  Recognizances  he had taken and bring him  Account what Justices were on the Bench  d what principal Pleas were before 'em  hich he knew I knew how to do having often  tended him on those Services  I who knew how it stood with me better  an he did felt a Weight come over me as  n as he had spoke the Word For I presently  y it would bring a very great Exercise upon  But having never resisted his Will in any  ng that was lawful as this was I attempt  not to make any Excuse but ordering an  rse to be ready for me early in the Morning  ent to Bed having great Struglings in my  east  For the Enemy came in upon me like a  od and set many Difficulties before me  elling them up to the highest Pitch by repre  ting them as Mountains which I should ne  be able to get over And alas that  Faith  ich could remove such Mountains and cast  them into the Sea was but very small an  weak in me  He cast into my Mind not only how I shoul  behave my self in Court and dispatch the B  +siness I was sent about but how I should d  +mean my self towards my Acquaintance  which I had many in that City with whom  was wont to be Jolly whereas now I coul  not put off my Hat nor Bow to any of the  nor give them their honorary Titles as they a  called nor use the corrupt Language of  You  any one of them but must keep to the pla  and true Language of  Thou  and  Thee  Much of this Nature revolved in my Min  thrown in by the Enemy to discourage a  cast me down And I had none to have r  +course to for Counsel or Help but the Lor  alone To whom therefore I poured forth m  Supplications with earnest Cries and Breat  +ings of Soul that H E in whom all Pow  was would enable me to go through this gre  Exercise and keep me faithful to Himself the  in And after some time he was pleased  compose my Mind to Stilness and I went  rest  Early next Morning I got up and fou  my Spirit pretty calm and quiet yet not wit  +out a Fear upon me lest I should slip and  +fall the Testimony which I had to bear And  I rode a frequent Cry ran through me to th  Lord on this wise  O my God Preserve  faithful whatever befals me Suffer me not to  drawn into Evil how much Scorn and Contempt soever may be cast upon me  Thus was my Spirit exercised on the way almost continually And when I was come within a Mile or two of the City whom should I meet upon the Way coming from thence but  Edward Burrough  I rode in a  MountierCap  a Dress more used then than now and so did he and because the Weather was exceeding sharp we both had drawn our Caps down to  helter our Faces from the Cold and by that means neither of us knew the other but passed  y without taking Notice one of the other till  few Days after meeting again and observing  ach others Dress we recollected where we  ad so lately met Then thought I with my  elf O  How glad should I have been of a Word  Encouragement and Counsel from him when I  as under that weighty Exercise of Mind  But the  ord saw it was not good for me that my Re  ance might be wholly upon him and not on Man  When I had set up my Horse I went directly  the Hall where the Sessions were held  here I had been but a very little while before  Knot of my old Acquaintances espying me  me to me One of these was a Scholar in his  own another a Surgeon of that City both  y SchoolFellows and FellowBoarders at  ameSchool  and the Third a Country Gentle  an with whom I had long been very Familiar  When they were come up to me they all sa  ted me after the usual manner putting off  their Hats and Bowing and saying  Your Humble Servant Sir  expecting no doubt the like from me But when they saw me stand still not moving my Cap nor bowing my Knee in way of  Congee  to them they were amazed and looked first one upon another then upon me and then one upon another again for a while without a Word speaking  At length the Surgeon a brisk young Man who stood nearest to me clapping his Hand in a familiar way upon my Shoulder and smiling on me said  What  TOM  a Quaker  T  which I readily and cheerfully Answered  Ye  A Quaker  And as the Words passed out of m  Mouth I felt Joy spring in my Heart for  rejoyced that I had not been drawn out b  them into a Compliance with them and tha  I had Strength and Boldness given me to Co  +fess my self to be one of that despised People  They staid not long with me nor said an  more that I remember to me but lookin  somewhat confusedly one upon another after  while took their Leave of me going off in th  same ceremonious Manner as they came on  After they were gone I walked a while a+bout the Hall and went up nearer to the Court to observe both what Justices were on th  Bench and what Business they had before them  And I went in Fear not of what they coul  or would have done to me if they should ha  taken notice of me but lest I should be su  +prized and drawn unwarily into that whi  I was to keep out of  It was not long before the Court adjourned to go to Dinner And that time I took to go to the  Clerk of the Peace  at his House whom I was well acquainted with So soon as I came into the Room where he was he came and met me and saluted me after his manner for he had a great Respect for my Father and a kind Regard for me And tho' he was at first somewhat startled at my Carriage and Language yet he treated me very civilly without any Reflection or shew of Lightness I delivered him the  Recognizances  which my Father had sent and having done the Business I came upon withdrew and went to my Inn to refresh my self and then to return home  But when I was ready to take Horse looking out into the Street I saw two or three Justices standing just in the Way where I was to ride This brought a fresh Concern upon me I knew if they saw me they would know me And I concluded if they knew me they would stop me to enquire after my Father and I doubted how I should come off with them  This Doubting brought Weakness on me and that Weakness led to Contrivance how I might avoid this Trial I knew the City prety well and remembred there was a back Way which though somewhat about would bring me out of Town without passing by  ose Justices Yet loth I was to go that Way Wherefore I staid a pretty time in hopes they would have parted Company or removed to  ome other Place out of my Way But when  I had waited till I was uneasie for losing so much time having entred into Reasonings with Flesh and Blood the Weakness prevailed over me and away I went the back Way which brought Trouble and Grief upon my Spirit for having shunned the Cross  But the Lord looked on me with a tender Eye and seeing my Heart was right to him and that what I had done was meerly through Weakness and Fear of Falling and that I was sensible of my Failing therein and sorry for it he was graciously pleased to pass it by and speak Peace to me again So that before I got home as when I went in the Morning my Heart was full of Breathing Prayer to the Lord that he would vouchsafe to be with me and uphold and carry me through that Days Exercise So now at my Return in the Evening my Heart was full of thankful Acknowledgments and Praises unto Him for his great Goodness and Favour to me in having thus far preserved and kept me from falling into any thing that might have brought Dishonour to his Holy Name which I had now taken on me  But notwithstanding that it was thus with me and that I found Peace and Acceptance with the Lord in some good degree according to my Obedience to the Convictions I had received by his  Holy Spirit  in me yet was not the Vail so done away or fully rent but that there still remained a Cloud upon my Understanding with respect to my Carriage towards my Father And that Notion which the Enemy  had brought into my Mind That  I ought to put such a Difference between him all others as that on the Account of Paternal Relation I should still deport my self towards him both in Gesture and Language as I had always heretofore done  did yet prevail with me So that when I came home I went to my Father bare headed as I used to do and gave him a particular Account of the Business he had given me in Command in such manner that he observing no alteration in my Carriage towards him found no Cause to take Offence at me  I had felt for sometime before an earnest Desire of Mind to go again to  Isaac Penington  's And I began to question whether when my Father should come as I concluded e're long he would to understand I enclined to settle among the People called  Quakers  he would permit me the Command of his Horses as before Wherefore in the Morning when I went to  Oxford  I gave Direction to a Servant of his to go that Day to a Gentleman of my Acquaintance who I knew had a Riding Nag to put off either by Sale or to be kept for his Work and desire him in my Name to send him to me which he did and I found him in the Stable when I came home  On this Nag I designed to ride next Day to  Isaac Penington  's and in order thereunto arose betimes and got my self ready for the Journey But because I would pay all due Respects to my Father and not go without his Consent or Knowledge at the least I sent one up to him  for he was not yet stirring to acquaint him that I had a Purpose to go to  Isaac Peuington  's and desired to know if he pleased to Command me any Service to them He sent me Word He  would speak with me before I went and would have me come up to him  which I did and stood by his BedSide  Then in a mild and gentle Tone he said  I understand you have a Mind to go to Mr  Penington  's  I answered I have so  Why  said he  I wonder why you should You were there you know but a few Days ago and unless you had Business with them don't you think it will look odly  I said I I thought not  I doubt  said he  You'll tire them with your Company and make them think they shall be troubled with you  If replyed I I find any thing of that I'll make the shorter Stay  But  said he  can you propose any sort of Business with them more than a meer Visit  Yes said I I propose to my self not only to see them but to have some Discourse with them  Why  said he in a Tone a little Harsher  I hope you don't encline to be of their Way  Truly answered I I like them and their Way very well so far as I yet understand it and I am willing to Go to them that I may understand it better  Thereupon he began to reckon up a BeadRoll of Faults against the  Quakers  Telling me  They were a rude unmannerly People that would not give Civil Respect or Honour to their Superiors no not to Magistrates That they held many dangerous Principles That they were an immodest shameless People and that one of them strip't himself  starknaked and went in that unseemly manner about the Streets at Fairs and on Marketdays in great Towns  To all the other Charges I answered only That perhaps they might be either misreported or misunderstood as the best of People had sometimes been But to the last Charge of  Going Naked  a particular Answer by way of Instance was just then brought into my Mind and put into my Mouth which I had not thought of before and that was the Example of  Isaiah  who went  Naked  among the People for a long time  Isai    Aye  said my Father  but you must consider that He was a Prophet of the Lord and had an express Command from God to Go so  Yes Sir replied I I do consider that but I consider also that the  Jews  among whom he lived did not own him for a Prophet nor believe that he had such a Command from God And added I how know we but that this  Quaker  may be a Prophet too and might be commanded to do as he did for some Reason which we understand not  This put my Father to a stand so that letting fall his Charges against the  Quakers  he only said  I would wish you not to go so soon but take a little time to consider of it you may Visit Mr  Penington  hereafter  Nay Sir replied I Pray don't hinder my going now for I have so strong a Desire to go that I do not well know how to forbear And as I spake those Words I withdrew gently to the ChamberDoor and then hastning down Stairs went immediately  to the Stable where finding my Horse ready Bridled I forthwith mounted and went off lest I should receive a Countermand  This Discourse with my Father had cast me somewhat back in my Journey and it being Fifteen long Miles thither the Ways bad and my Nag but small it was in the Afternoon that I got thither And understanding by the Servant that took my Horse that there was then a Meeting in the House as there was Weekly on that Day which was the  Fourth Day  of the Week though I till then understood it not I hastened in and knowing the Rooms went directly to the  Little Parlour  where I found a few Friends sitting together in Silence and I sate down among them well satisfied though without Words  When the Meeting was ended and those of the Company who were Strangers withdrawn I addressed my self to  Isaac Penington  and his Wife who received me courteously but not knowing what Exercise I had been in and yet was under nor having heard any thing of me since I had been there before in another Garb were not forward at first to lay suddain Hands on me which I observed and did not dislike But as they came to see a Change in me not in Habit only but in Gesture Speech and Carriage and which was more in Countenance also for the Exercise I had passed through and yet was under had imprinted a visible Character of Gravity upon my Face they were exceeding kind and tender towards me  There was then in the Family a Friend whose Name was  Anne Curtis  the Wife of  Thomas Curtis  of  Reading  who was come upon a Visit to them and particularly to see  Mary Penington  's Daughter  Guli  who had been ill of the  Small Pox  since I had been there before Betwixt  Mary Penington  and this  Friend  I observed some private Discourse and Whisperings and I had an Apprehension that it was upon something that concerned me Wherefore I took the freedom to ask  Mary Penington  If my coming thither had occasioned any Inconvenience in the Family She asked me  If I had had the Small Pox  I told her no She then told me  Her Daughter had newly had them and though she was well recovered of them she had not as yet been down amongst them but intended  have come down and sate with them in the Par  our that Evening yet would rather forbear till  nother time than Endanger me  And that  that  as the matter they had been discoursing of  I assu  ed her that I had always been and then  ore especially was free from any Apprehen  on of Danger in that respect and therefore  treated that her Daughter might come  own And although they were somewhat  nwilling to yield to it in regard of me yet  y Importunity prevailed and after Supper  e did come down and sit with us and tho'  e Marks of the Distemper were fresh upon  er yet they made no Impression upon me  aith  keeping out  Fear  We spent much of the Evening in Retiredness of Mind our Spirits being weightily gathered inward so that not much Discourse pas+sed among us neither they to me nor I to them offered any Occasion Yet I had good Satisfaction in that Stilness feeling my Spiri  drawn near to the Lord and to them therein  Before I went to Bed they let me know  that there was to be a Meeting at  Wiccomb  nex  Day and that some of the Family would g  to it I was very glad of it for I greatly d  +sired to go to Meetings and this fell very ap  +ly it being in my way home Next Mornin  Isaac Penington  himself went having  Anne Cu  +tis  with him and I accompanied them  At  Wiccomb  we met with  Edward Burroug  who came from  Oxford  thither that Day that  going thither met him on the Way and h  +ving both our  MountierCaps  on we recollecte  that we had met and passed by each other  the Road unknown  This was a Monthly Meeting consisting  Friends  chiefly who gathered to it from sever  Parts of the Country thereabouts so that  was pretty large and was held in a fair Roo  in  Jeremiah Steevens  's House the Roo  where I had been at a Meeting before in  Jo  Raunce  's House being too little to receive us  A very good Meeting was this in its se  and to me  Edward Burrough  's Ministry ca  forth among us in Life and Power and t  Assembly was covered therewith I also a  +cording to my small Capacity had a Sha  therein For I felt some of that Divine Power working my Spirit into a great Tenderness and not only Confirming me in the Course I had already entred and strengthning me to go on therein but rending also the Vail somewhat further and Clearing my Understanding in some other things which I had not seen before For the Lord was pleased to make his Discoveries to me by degrees that the Sight of too great a Work and too many Enemies to encounter with at once might not discourage me and make me faint  When the Meeting was ended the  Friends  of the Town taking notice that I was the Man that had been at their Meeting the Week before whom they then did not know some of them came and spake lovingly to me and would have had me staid with them but  Edward Burrough  going home with  Isaac Penington  he invited me to go back with him which I willingly consented to For the Love I had more particularly to  Edward Burrough  through whose Ministry I had received the first awakning Stroke drew me to desire his Company and so away we rode together  But I was somewhat disappointed of my Expectation for I hoped he would have given me both Opportunity and Encouragement to have opened my self to him and to have poured forth my Complaints Fears Doubts and Questionings into his Bosom But he being sensible that I was truly reach'd and that the  Witness  of GOD was raised and the  Work  of GOD  rightly begun in me chose to leave me to the  Guidance of the good Spirit in my self  the  Counsellor  that could resolve all Doubts that I might not have any Dependence on Man Wherefore although he was naturally of an open and free Temper and Carriage and was afterwards always very familiar and affectionately kind to me yet at this time he kept himself somewhat reserved and shewed only common Kindness to me  Next Day we parted He for  London  I home under a very great Weight and Exercise upon my Spirit For I now saw  in  and  by  the farther  Openings  of the DIVINE LIGHT in me that the Enemy by his  false Reasonings  had  beguiled  and  misled  me with respect to my  Carriage towards my Father  For I now clearly saw That the  Honour  due to  Parents  did not consist in  Uncovering the Head  and  Bowing the Body  to them but in a  ready Obedience to their Lawful Commands  and in  Performing all needful Services unto them  Wherefore as I was greatly troubled for what I already had done in that Case though it was through Ignorance So I plainly felt I could no longer continue therein without drawing on my self the Guilt of  wilful Disobedience  which I well knew would draw after it  Divine Displeasure  and  Judgment  Hereupon the Enemy assaulted me afresh setting before me the  Danger  I should run my self into of provoking my Father to use Severity towards me and perhaps to the casting  e utterly off But over this Temptation the  ord whom I cried unto supported me and  ave me Faith to believe that he would bear  e through whatever might befal me on that  ccount Wherefore I resolved in the Strength  hich he should give me to be faithful to his  equirings  whatever might come on it  Thus labouring under various Exercises on  e Way I at length got home expecting I  ould have but a rough Reception from my  ather But when I came home I understood  y Father was from home Wherefore I sate  own by the Fire in the Kitchin keeping  y Mind retired to the Lord with Breathings  Spirit to Him that I might be preserved  om falling  After some time I heard the Coach drive in  hich put me into a little Fear and a sort of  ivering came over me But by that time he  as alighted and come in I had pretty well  covered my self and as soon as I saw him I  ose up and advanced a Step or two towards  im with my Head covered said  Isaac Pen  gton  and his Wife remember their Loves to  ee  He made a Stop to hear what I said and ob  erving that I did not stand bare and that I  sed the Word  Thee  to him He with a  ern Countenance and Tone that spake high Displeasure only said  I shall talk with you Sir  nother time  and so hastening from me went  to the Parlour and I saw him no more that Night  Though I foresaw there was a Storm arisi  the Apprehension of which was uneasie to m  yet the Peace which I felt in my own Brea  raised in me a Return of Thanksgivings to t  Lord for his gracious supporting Hand whi  had thus far carried me through this Exercis  with humble Cries in Spirit to Him that  would vouchsafe to stand by me in it to t  End and uphold me that I might not fall  My Spirit longed to be among  Friends  a  to be at some Meeting with them on the  Fi  Day  which now drew on this being the  Six  Day  Night Wherefore I purposed to go  Oxford  on the Morrow which was the  Seven  Day  of the Week having heard there was  Meeting there Accordingly having order  my Horse to be made ready betimes I got u  in the Morning and made my self ready al  Yet before I would go that I might be as o  servant to my Father as possibly I could I d  +sired my Sister to go up to him in his Chambe  and acquaint him that I had a Mind to g  to  Oxford  and desired to know if he pleased  Command me any Service there He bid h  tell me  He would not have me go till he ha  spoken with me  And getting up immediately  he hastened down to me before he was quit  dressed  As soon as he saw me standing with my Ha  on his Passion transporting him he fell upo  me with both his Fists and having by tha  Means somewhat vented his Anger he plucked off my Hat and threw it away Then stepping  hastily out to the Stable and seeing my  rrowed Nag stand ready Saddled and Bridled  asked his Man  Whence that Horse came  who  ling him he fetch't it from  Mr  such an  e's  Then ride him presently back  said my Fa  r  and tell  Mr  I desire he will never  d my Son an Horse again unless he brings a  te from me  The poor Fellow who loved me well would  have made Excuses and Delays but my  ther was positive in his Command and so  gent that he would not let him stay so much  to take his Breakfast though he had Five  iles to ride nor would he himself stir from  e Stable till he had seen the Man mounted  d gone  Then coming in he went up into his Cham  r to make himself more fully ready think  g he had me safe enough now my Horse was  e for I took so much Delight in Riding  t I seldom went on Foot  But while he was dressing himself in his  amber I who understood what had been  e changing my Boots for Shoos took an  er Hat and acquainting my Sister who  ed me very well and whom I could confide  whither I meant to go went out privately  d walked away to  Wiccomb  having Seven  g Miles thither which yet seem'd little and  e to me from the Desire I had to be among  ends  As thus I travelled all alone under a Load  Grief from the Sense I had of the Opposition  and Hardship I was to expect from  Father the Enemy took Advantage to Assa  me again casting a Doubt into my Mind  W  +ther I had done well in thus coming away from  Father without his Leave or Knowledge  I was quiet and peaceable in my Spirit b  +fore this Question was darted into me but a  +ter that Disturbance and Trouble seized up  me so that I was at a stand what to do wh  +ther to go forward or backward  Fear of offend  inclined me to go back but  Desire of the Meet  and to be with  Friends  pressed me to go forwa  I stood still a while to consider and weig  as well as I could the Matter I was sensib  satisfied that I had not left my Father with a  Intention of  Undutifulness  or  Disrespect  to hi  but meerly in Obedience to that  Drawing  Spirit  which I was perswaded was of t  LORD  to join with  His People  in  Worshipp  Him  and this made me easie  But then the Enemy to make me uneasie  +gain objected  But how could that Drawing be  the LORD which drew me to disobey my Fath  I considered thereupon the Extent of  Pat  +nal Power  which I found was not wholly A  +  bitrary  and  Unlimited  but had Bounds set u  it So that as in  Civil Matters  it was restra  +ed to  Things Lawful  so in  Spiritual  and  Reli  +ous Cases  it had not a  compulsory Power  over  C  +science  which ought to be  Subject  to the  H  +venly Father  And therefore though  Obedie  to Parents  be enjoyned to  Children  yet it  with this Limitation IN THE LORD  hildren obey your Parents in the Lord for this  right  Pet  This turned the Scale for going forward  d so on I went And yet I was not wholly  ee from some Fluctuations of Mind from the  esettings of the Enemy Wherefore altho'  knew that  Outward Signs  did not properly be  g to the  Gospel Dispensation  yet for my bet  r Assurance I did in Fear and great Humi  y beseech the Lord that He would be pleas  so far to condescend to the Weakness of his  rvant as to give me a Sign by which I  ight certainly know whether my Way was  ght before Him or not  The Sign which I asked was  That if I had  e wrong in Coming as I did I might be Reject  or but coldly received at the Place I was Going  but if this mine Undertaking was right in his  ht he would give me Favour with them I went  so that they should receive me with hearty Kind  s and Demonstrations of Love  Accordingly  en I came to  John Rance  's House which be  g so much a Stranger to all I chose to go to  ause I understood the Meeting was com  nly held there they received me with  re than ordinary Kindness especially  Frances  nce    John Rance  's then Wife who was both  Grave and Motherly Woman and had a  rty Love to Truth and Tenderness towards  that in Sincerity sought after it And this  kind Reception confirming me in the Be  that my Undertaking was  Approved of by  LORD  gave great Satisfaction and Ease  to my Mind and I was thankful to the Lord therefore  Thus it fared with me there but at Hom  it fared otherwise with my Father He sup+posing I had betaken my self to my Chamber  when he took my Hat from me made no En+quiry after me till Evening came and the  sitting by the Fire and considering that th  Weather was very cold he said to my Sister  who sate by him  Go up to your Brother's Cham+ber and call him down it may be he will sit the  else in a sullen Fit till he has caught Cold Alas Sir  said she  He is not in his Chamber nor i  the House neither  At that my Father startling said  Why where is he then I know not S  said she  where he is but I know that when  saw you had sent away his Horse he put on Shoo  and went out on Foot and I have not seen hi  since And indeed Sir  added she  I don't wo  +der at his going away considering how you use  him  This put my Father into a great Frigh  doubting I was gone quite away and so grea  a Passion of Grief seized on him that he fo  +bore not to Weep and to cry out aloud so tha  the Family heard him  Oh my Son I shall ne+ver see him more For he is of so bold and refolut  a Spirit that he will run himself into Danger an  so may be thrown into some Goal or other wher  he may lie and die before I can hear of hi  Then bidding her light him up to his Cham+ber he went immediately to Bed where h  lay Restless and Groaning and often bemoan+ing himself and me for the greatest Part o  the Night  Next Morning my Sister sent a Man whom  or his Love to me shew knew she could  rust to give me this Account and though  y him she sent me also fresh Linnen for my  se in case I should go farther or stay out  nger yet she desired me to come home as  on as I could  This Account was very uneasie to me I was  uch grieved that I had occasioned so much  rief to my Father And I would have re  rned that Evening after the Meeting but  e Friends would not permit it for the Meet  g would in likelihood end late the Days be  g short and the Way was long and dirty  nd besides  John Rance  told me that he had  mething on his Mind to speak to my Father  d that if I would stay till the next Day he  ould go down with me hoping perhaps that  ile my Father was under this Sorrow for  he might work some good upon him  ereupon concluding to stay till the Morrow  ismiss't the Man with the things he brought  ding him tell my Sister I intended God  ling to return home to Morrow and  rging him not to let any Body else know  t he had seen me or where he had been  Next Morning  John Rance  and I set out and  en we were come to the End of the Town  agreed that he should go before and knock  the great Gate and I would come a little  er and go in by the back Way He did so  when a Servant came to open the Gate he  ing if the Justice were at home she told  him  Yes  and desiring him to come in an  sit down in the Hall went and acquainted h  Master that there was one who desired to spea  with him He supposing it was one that ca  for Justice went readily into the Hall to hi  But he was not a little surpized when he fou  it was a  Quaker  Yet not knowing on wh  account he came he staid to hear his Busine  But when he found it was about me he  somewhat sharply on him  In this time I was come by the back w  into the Kitchin and hearing my Fathe  Voice so loud I began to doubt things wroug  not well but I was soon assured of that B  my Father having quickly enough of a  Quak  Company left  John Rance  in the Hall a  came into the Kitchin where he was m  surprized to find me  The Sight of my Hat upon my Head m  him presently forget that I was that Son  his whom he had so lately lamented as  and his Passion of Grief turning into An  he could not contain himself but running  on me with both his Hands first viole  snatch't off my Hat and threw it away T  giving me some Buffets on my Head he  Sirrah Get you up to your Chamber  I forthwith went he following me at  Heels and now and then giving me a Whi  on the Ear which the way to my Cham  lying through the Hall where  John Rance  he poor Man might see and be sorry for  I doubt not but he was but could not help  This was sure an unaccountable thing That  y Father should but a Day before express  high a Sorrow for me as fearing he should  ever see me any more and yet now so soon  he did see me should fly upon me with such  iolence and that only because I did not put  f my Hat which he knew I did not keep on  Disrespect  to him but upon a  Religious Prin  le  But as this  HatHonour  as it was ac  unted was grown to be a great  Idol  in those  es more especially so the Lord was pleased  engage his Servants in a steady Testimony  ainst it what suffering soever was brought  on them for it And though some who have  en called in the Lord's Vineyard at latter  urs and since the Heat of that Day hath been  uch over may be apt to account this Testimo  a  small thing  to suffer  so much  upon as some  ve done not only to  Beating  but to  Fines  d  long  and  hard Imprisonments  yet they who  those Times were  faithfully  Exercised  in  and  der  it durst not despise the  Day of small things  knowing that he who should do so would  t be thought worthy to be concerned in  her Testimonies  I had now lost one of my Hats and I had  t one more That therefore I put on but  not keep it long for the next time my Fa  er saw it on my Head he tore it violently  m me and laid it up with the other I  ew not where Wherefore I put on my  untier  Cap which was all I had left to wear  my Head and it was but a very little while  that I had that to wear for as soon as my Fa+ther came where I was I lost that also And now I was forced to go bearHeaded wher  ever I had Occasion to go within Doors an  without  This was in the  Eleventh Month  called  Jan  +ary  and the Weather sharp so that I wh  had been bred up more tenderly took so grea  a Cold in my Head that my Face and Hea  were much swelled and my Gums had o  them Boyls so sore that I could neither Che  Meat nor without Difficulty swallow Liquid  It held long and I underwent much Pain wit  out much Pity except from my poor Siste  who did what she could to give me Ease a  at length by frequent Applications of Figs a  stoned Raisins toasted and laid to the Boy  as hot as I could bear them they ripened  for Lancing and soon after sunk then I h  Ease  Now was I laid up as a kind of Prison  for the rest of this Winter having no mea  to go forth among  Friends  nor they Liber  to come to me Wherefore I spent the Ti  much in my Chamber in Waiting on t  LORD and in Reading mostly in the  Bib  But whenever I had occasion to speak to  Father though I had no Hat now to offe  him yet my Language did as much fo  durst not say YOU to him but THOU  THEE as the Occasion required and th  would he be sure to fall on me with his Fi  At one of these times I remember when  e had beaten me in that Manner he command  me as he commonly did at such times to  o to my Chamber which I did and he fol  wed me to the Bottom of the Stairs Being  me thither he gave me a PartingBlow and  a very angry Tone said  Sirrah If ever I  ar you say  Thou  or  Thee  to me again I'll strike  ur Teeth down your Throat  I was greatly  ieved to hear him say so And feeling a Word  e in my Heart unto him I turned again  d calmly said unto him Would it not be  t if God should serve thee so when thou  est  Thou  or  Thee  to Him Though his Hand  as up I saw it sink and his Countenance  and he turned away and left me standing  ere But I notwithstanding went up into  y Chamber and Cryed unto the Lord ear  stly beseeching Him that he would be pleas  to open my Father's Eyes that he might see  hom he fought against and for what and  at He would turn his Heart  After this I had a pretty time of Rest and  iet from these Disturbances my Father not  ing any thing to me nor giving me Occa  n to say any thing to him But I was still  der a kind of Confinement unless I would  ve run about the Country bareheaded like  MadMan which I did not see it was my  ace to do For I found that although to be  road and at Liberty among my Friends  ould have been more pleasant to me yet  ome was at present my proper Place a  School in which I was to learn with  Patience  to  Bear the Cross  and I willingly submitted to it  But after some time a fresh Storm more fierce and sharp than any before arose and fell upon me the Occasion whereof was this My Father having been in his younger Years more especially while he lived in  London    constant Hearer of those who are called  Puri+tanPreachers  had stored up a pretty stock o  ScriptureKnowledge  did sometimes not con+stantly nor very often cause his Family t  come together on a  First Day  in the Evening  and expound a Chapter to them and Pray  His Family now as well as his Estate wa  lessen'd for my Mother was dead my Bro+ther gone and my elder Sister at  London  an  having put off his  Husbandry  he had put  with it most of his Servants so that he ha  now but one Man and one MaidServant  so fell out that on a  First Day  Night he bi  my Sister who sate with him in the Parlou  Call in the Servants to Prayer  Whether this was done as a Trial upon m  or no I know not but a Trial it proved  me For they loving me very well and di  +liking my Father's Carriage to me made  haste to go in but staid a second Summon  This so offended him that when at length the  did go in he instead of Going to  Prayer  E  +amined them  Why they came not in when th  were first Called  and the Answer they gave hi  being such as rather heightned than abate  s Displeasure he with an angry Tone said  ll in that Fellow  meaning me who was left  one in the Kitchin  for he is the Cause of all  is  They as they were backward to go in emselves so were not forward to call me in aring the Effect of my Father's Displeasure  ould fall upon me as it soon did for I  earing what was said and not staying for the  all went in of my self And as soon as I  as come in my Father discharged his Dis  easure on me in very sharp and bitter Ex  essions which drew from me in the Grief  f my Heart to see him so transported with  assion these few Words  They that can Pray  ith such a Spirit let 'em for my part I cannot  With that my Father flew upon me with both  is Fists and not thinking that sufficient step't  astily to the Place where his Cane stood and  atching that up laid me on I thought with  ll his Strength And I being bareheaded I  hought his Blows must needs have broken my  cull had I not laid mine Arm over my Head  o defend it  His Man seeing this and not able to con  ain himself step't in between us and laying  old on the Cane by Strength of Hand held  t so fast that though he attempted not to take  t away yet he withheld my Father from striking with it which did but enrage him the more I disliked this in the Man and bid him  et go the Cane and be gone which he immediately did and turning to be gone had a  Blow on the Shoulders for his Pains which ye  did not much hurt him  But now my Sister fearing lest my Fathe  should fall upon me again besought him  forbear adding  Indeed Sir if you strike hi  any more I will throw open the Casement and C  Murther for I am afraid you will kill my Brothe  This stop't his Hand and after some Threa  +ning Speeches he commanded me to  Get to m  Chamber  which I did as I always did whe  ever he bid me  Thither soon after my Sister followed m  to see my Arm and dress it for it was indee  very much bruised and swelled between th  Wrist and the Elbow and in some places th  Skin was broken and beaten off But thoug  it was very sore and I felt for some time mu  Pain in it yet I had Peace and Quietness i  my Mind being more grieved for my Fathe  than for my self who I knew had hurt himsel  more than me  This was so far as I remember the la  time that ever my Father called his Family t  Prayer  And this was also the last time tha  he ever fell so severely at least upon me  Soon after this my Elder Sister who in al  the time of these Exercises of mine had bee  at  London  returned home much troubled t  find me a  Quaker  a Name of Reproach an  great Contempt then and she being at  Lon+don  h  d received I suppose the worst Character of them Yet though she disliked th  People her affectionate Regard to me made her rather Pity than Despise me and the more when she understood what hard Usage I had met with  The rest of this Winter I spent in a lonesome solitary Life having none to Converse with none to unbosom my self unto none to ask Counsel of none to seek Relief from but the LORD alone who yet was more than All And yet the Company and Society of Faithful and Judicious  Friends  would I thought have been very welcome as well as helpful to me in my Spiritual Travel in which I thought I made but a slow Progress my Soul breathing after further Attainments The Sence of which drew from me the following Lines  The Winter Tree  Resembles me  Whose Sap lies in its Root  The Spring draws nigh  As it so I  Shall bud I hope and shoot  At length it pleased the Lord to move  Isaac Penington  and his Wife to make a Visit to my Father and see how it fared with me And very welcome they were to me whatever they were to him to whom I doubt not but they would have been more welcome had it not been for me  They tarried with us all Night and much Discourse they had with my Father both about  the Principle of TRUTH in general and m  in particular which I was not privy to Bu  one thing I remember I afterwards heard of  which was this  When my Father and we were at thei  House some Months before  Mary Penington  in some Discourse between them had told hi  how hardly her Husband's Father Alderma  Penington  had dealt with him about his Hat  which my Father little then thinking that i  would and so soon too be his own Case di  very much Censure the Alderman for won+dring that so wise a Man as he was shoul  take Notice of such a trivial Thing as the  Put+ting off  or  keeping on a Hat  and he spare  not to blame him liberally for it  This gave her a Handle to take hold of him by And having had an ancient Acquaintance with him and he having always had an high Opinion of and Respect for her she who was a Woman of great Wisdom of ready Speech and of a wellresolved Spirit did pres  so close upon him with this HomeArgument  that he was utterly to seek and at a loss how to defend himself  After Dinner next Day when they were ready to take Coach to return home she de+sired my Father that since my Company was so little acceptable to him he would give me leave to Go and spend some time with them  where I should be sure to be welcome  He was very unwilling I should go and made many Objections against it all which  she Answered and removed so clearly that not finding what Excuse further to alledge he at length left it to me and I soon turned the Scale for Going  We were come to the Coachside before this was concluded on and I was ready to step in when one of my Sisters privately put my Father in Mind that I had never a Hat on That somewhat startled him for he did not think it fit I should go from home and that so far and to stay abroad without a Hat Wherefore he whi  p  red to her to fetch me a Hat and he entertained them with some Discourse in the mean time But as soon as he saw the Hat coming he would not stay till it came lest I should put it on before him but breaking off his Discourse abruptly took his leave of them and hastened in before the Hat was brought to me  I had not one Penny of Money about me nor any indeed elsewhere For my Father so soon as he saw that I would be a  Quaker  took from me both what Money I had and every thing else of Value or that would have made Money as some Plate Buttons Rings  c  pretending that he would keep them for me till I came to my self again lest I in the mean time should destroy them  But as I had no Money so being among my Friends I had no need of any nor ever honed after it though once upon a particular Occasion I had like to have wanted it The Case was thus  I had been at  Reading  and set out from thence on the First Day of the Week in the Morning intending to reach as in point of Time I well might to  Isaac Penington  's where the Meeting was to be that Day but when I came to  Maidenhead  a thoroughfair Town on the Way I was stop't by the Watch for Riding on that Day  The Watchman laying hold on the Bridle told me  I must go with him to the Constable  and accordingly I making no Resistance suffered him to lead my Horse to the Constable's Door When we were come there the Constable told me  I must go before the Warden  who was the Chief Officer of that Town and bid the Watchman bring me on himself walking before  Being come to the Warden's Door the Constable knock't and desired to speak with Mr  Warden  He thereupon quickly coming to the Door the Constable said  Sir I have brought a Man here to you whom the Watch took riding through the Town  The Warden was a budge old Man and I looked somewhat big too having a good Gelding under me and a good Riding Coat on my Back both which my Friend  Isaac Penington  had kindly accommodated me with for that Journey  The Warden therefore taking me to be as the Saying is  Somebody  put off his Hat and made a low  Congee  to me but when he saw that I sate still and neither bowed to him nor moved my Hat he gave a start and said  o the Constable  You said you had brought a Man  ut he don't behave himself like a Man  I sate still upon my Horse and said not a Word but kept my Mind retired to the Lord waiting to see what this would come to  The Warden then began to Examine me Asking me  Whence I came  and  Whither I was  oing  I told him I came from  Reading  and was going to  Chalfont  He asked me  Why I did Travel on that Day  I told him I did not know  hat it would give any Offence barely to Ride  r Walk on that Day so long as I did not Car  y or Drive any Carriage or Horses laden with Burthens  Why  said he  if your Business was ur  ent did you not take a Pass from the Mayor of  Reading Because replied I I did not know  or think I should have needed one  Well  said  e  I will not talk with you now because it is time  o Go to Church but I will Examine you further  non  And turning to the Constable  Have him  aid he  to an Inn and bring him before me after Dinner  The Naming of an Inn put me in Mind that  uch publick Houses were places of Expence  nd I knew I had no Money to defray it Wherefore I said to the Warden Before thou  endest me to an Inn which may occasion some Expence I think it needful to acquaint thee that I have no Money  At that the Warden startled again and turning quick upon me said  How No Money How can that be You don't look like a Man that has no Money  However I look said I I tell  thee the Truth that I have no Money and  tell it to forewarn thee that thou mayst no  bring any Charge upon the Town  I wonder  said he  what Art you have got that you can Tra+vel without Money you can do more I assure you  than I can  I making no Answer he went on and said  Well well but if you have no Money you have  good Horse under you and we can Distrain hi  for the Charge  But said I the Horse is no  mine  No  said he  ut you have a good Coa  on your Back and that I hope is your own  No  said I but it is not for I borrowed both th  Horse and the Coat  With that the Warden holding up hi  Hands and smiling said  Bless me I neve  met with such a Man as you are before What  were you set out by the Parish  Then turning to the Constable he said  Have him to the Gray+hound and bid the People be civil to him  Ac+cordingly to the Grayhound I was led my Horse set up and I put into a large Room  and some Account I suppose given of me to the People of the House  This was new Work to me and what the Issue of it would be I could not foresee but being left there alone I sate down and retired in Spirit to the Lord in whom alone my Strength and Safety was and beg'd support of Him even that he would be pleased to give me Wisdom and Words to Answer the Warden when I should come to be Examined again before him  After some time having Pen Ink and Paper about me I set my self to write what I thought might be proper if Occasion served to give the Warden And while I was writing the Master of the House being come home from his Worship sent the Tapster to me to invite me to dine with him I bid him tell his Master that I had not any Money to pay for my Dinner He sent the Man again to tell me  I should be welcome to dine with him though I had no Money  I desired him to tell his Master that I was very sensible of his Civility and Kindness in so courteously inviting me to his Table but I had not freedom to eat of his Meat unless I could have paid for it So he went on with his Dinner and I with my Writing  But before I had finished what was on my Mind to write the Constable came again bringing with him his FellowConstable This was a brisk genteel young Man a Shopkeeper in the Town whose Name was  Cherry  They saluted me Civilly and told me they were come to have me before the Warden This put an End to my Writing which I put into my Pocket and went along with them  Being come to the Warden's He asked me again the same Questions he had asked me before To which I gave him the like Answers Then he told me the Penalty I had incurred which he said was either to pay so much Money or lye so many Hours in the Stocks and asked me which I would chuse I reply'd I shall not chuse either And said I I have told  thee already that I have no Money though i  I had I could not so far Acknowledge my sel  an Offender as to pay any But as to lying i  the Stocks I am in thy Power to do unto me  what it shall please the Lord to suffer thee  When he heard that he paused awhile and then told me  He considered that I was but a Young Man and might not perhaps understand the danger I had brought my self into and therefore he would not use the Severity of the Law upon me but in hopes that I would be wiser hereafter he would pass by this Offence and discharge me  Then putting on a Countenance of the greatest Gravity he said to me  But young Man I would have you know That you have not only broken the Law of the Land but the Law of God also and therefore you ought to ask Him Forgiveness for you have highly offended Him  That said I I would most willingly do if I were sensible that in this Case I had offended Him by breaking any Law of His  Why  said he  do you question that  Yes truly said I for I do not know that any Law of God doth forbid me to Ride on this Day  No  said he  that's strange Where I wonder were you Bred You can read Can't you  Yes said I that I can  Don't you read then  said he  the Commandment  Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy Six Days shalt thou Labour and do all thy Work but the Seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it thou shalt not do any Work Yes replyed I I have both read it often and remember it very  well But that Command was given to the  Jews  not to  Christians  and this is not that Day for that was the Seventh Day but this  the First  How  said he  Do you know the Days of the Week no better you had need then  e better taught  Here the younger Constable whose Name was  Cherry  interposing said  Mr  Warden  the Gentleman is in the right as to that for this is the first Day of the Week and not the Seventh  This the old Warden took in  dudgeon  and  oking severely on the Constable said  What  you take upon you to teach me I'll have you  now I will not be taught by you As you please  r that Sir  said the Constable  but I am sure  u are mistaken in this Point for  Saturday  I  ow is the  Seventh Day  and you know Yesterday  as  Saturday  This made the Warden hot and testy and  ut him almost out of all Patience so that I  ar'd it would have come to a downright Quar  el betwixt them for both were confident and  either would yield And so earnestly were  ey engaged in the Contest that there was no  oom for me to put in a Word between them  At length the Old Man having talk't him  lf out of Wind stood still a while as it were  take Breath and then bethinking himself of  e he turn'd to me and said  You are discharg  and may take your Liberty to go about your Occa  ns  But said I I desire my Horse may be  ischarged too else I know not how to go  y Ay  said he  you shall have your Horse  and  turning to the other Constable who had no  offended him he said  Go see that his Horse b  delivered to him  Away thereupon went I with that Consta+ble leaving the Old Warden and the Young Constable to compose their Difference as they could Being come to the Inn the Constable called for my Horse to be brought out Which done I immediately Mounted and began to set forward But the Hostler not knowing the Condition of my Pocket said modestly  me  Sir Don't you forget to pay for your Horse  standing  No truly said I I don't forget it  but I have no Money to pay it with and so  told the Warden before  Well hold you yo  Tongue  said the Constable to the Hostler  I  see you paid  Then opening the Gate they l  me out the Constable wishing me a good Jou  ney and through the Town I rode withou  further Molestation though it was as muc  Sabbath I thought when I went out as i  was when I came in  A secret Joy arose in me as I rode on th  Way for that I had been preserved from D  ing or Saying any thing which might gi  the Adversaries of TRUTH Advantage again  it or the  Friends  of it and Praises sprang i  my thankful Heart to the Lord my Preserve  It added also not a little to my Joy that  felt the Lord near unto me by His Witness i  my Heart to Check and Warn me and m  Spirit was so far subjected to Him as readily  take Warning and stop at His Check An Instance of both that very Morning I had  For as I rode between  Reading  and  Mainden  ead  I saw lying in my way the Scabbard of an  anger which having lost its Hook had slipt off I suppose and drop't from the Side of the Wearer and it had in it a pair of Knives whose Hafts being inlaid with Silver seemed  o be of some Value I alighted and took it  p and clapping it between my Thigh and  he Saddle rode on a little way but I quickly  ound it too heavy for me and the Reprover  me soon began to Check The Word arose  me  What hast thou to do with that Doth it  elong to thee  I felt I had done amiss in Taking  wherefore I turned back to the Place where  lay and laid it down where I found it And when afterwards I was stop't and seized on at  Maidenhead  I saw there was a Providence in  ot bringing it with me which if it should  ave been found as it needs must under my  oat when I came to be Unhorsed might  ave raised some evil Suspicion or sinister  houghts concerning me  The Stop I met with at  Maidenhead  had  ent me so much time that when I came to  aac Penington  's the Meeting there was half  er Which gave them Occasion after Meet  g to enquire of me If any thing had befal  n me on the Way which had caused me  come so late Whereupon I related to them  hat Exercise I had met with and how the  ord had helped me through it Which when  they had heard they Rejoyced with me and for my sake  Great was the Love and manifold the Kind+nesses which I received from these my wor+thy Friends  Isaac  and  Mary Penington  while I abode in their Family They were indeed as affectionate Parents and tender Nurses to me in this time of my  Religious Childhood  For besides their weighty and seasonable Counsels and Exemplary Conversations they furnishe  me with Means to go to the other Meetings o  Friends in that Country when the Meeting was not in their own House And indeed th  time I staid with them was so well spent tha  it not only yielded great Satisfaction to m  Mind but turned in good Measure to my sp  +ritual Advantage in the TRUTH  But that I might not on the one hand bea  too hard upon my Friends nor on the othe  hand forget the House of Thraldom after  had staid with them some Six or Seven Week  from the Time called  Easter  to the Tim  called  Whitsuntide  I took my leave of the  to depart home intending to walk to  Wiccom  in one Day and from thence home in another  That Day that I came Home I did not see my Father nor until Noon the next Day when I went into the Parlour when he was to take my usual Place at Dinner  As soon as I came in I observed by my Father's Countenance that my Hat was still an Offence to him but when I was sitten down and before I had eaten any thing he made me  nderstand it more fully by saying to me but  a milder Tone than he had formerly used  speak to me in  If you cannot content your self  come to Dinner without your Hive on your  ead  so he called my Hat  pray Rise and go  ke your Dinner somewhere else  Upon those Words I arose from the Table  d leaving the Room went into the Kitchin  here I staid till the Servants went to Dinner  d then sate down very contentedly with  em Yet I suppose my Father might intend  at I should have gone into some other Room  d there have eaten by my self But I chose  ther to Eat with the Servants and did so  om thenceforward so long as He and I lived  gether And from this time he rather chose  I thought to avoid seeing me than to re  w the Quarrel about my Hat  My Sisters mean while observing my Wa  ess in Words and Behaviour and being sa  fied I suppose that I acted upon a  Principle  Religion  and  Conscience  carried themselves  ry kindly to me and did what they could to  itigate my Father's Displeasure against me  that I now enjoyed much more quiet at  ome and took more Liberty to go Abroad  mongst my Friends than I had done or could  before And having informed my self  here any Meetings of  Friends  were holden  ithin a reasonable Distance from me I resort  d to them  At first I went to a Town called  Haddenham  Buckinghamshire  Five Miles from my Father's  where at the House of one  Belson  few who were called  Quakers  did meet som  times on a  First Day  of the Week but I foun  little Satisfaction there Afterwards upon fu  +ther Enquiry I understood there was a settle  Meeting at a little Village called  Meadle  abo  Four long Miles from me in the House of o  John White  which is continued there still  and to that thenceforward I constantly wen  while I abode in that Country and was ab  Many a sore Days Travel have I had thith  and back again being commonly in the Wi  +ter time how fair soever the Weather was  +ver head wet up to the Ancles at least y  through the Goodness of the Lord to me  was preserved in Health  A little Meeting also there was on t  Fourth Day of the Week at a Town call  Bledlow  two Miles from me in the House  one  Thomas Saunders  who  Professed  the Trut  But his Wife whose Name was  Damaris  Possess  it she being a Woman of great Since  +ty and lively Sense and to that Meeting a  I usually went  But though I took this Liberty for the S  +vice of GOD that I might Worship Him  the Assemblies of his People yet did I not  it upon other Occasions but spent my Ti  on other Days for the most part in my Cha  +ber in Retiredness of Mind waiting on  LORD And the LORD was graciously ple  +ed to visit me by his quickening  Spirit  a  Life  so that I came to feel the  Operation of  Power  in my Heart working out that which was contrary to his Will and giving me in measure Dominion over it  And as my Spirit was kept in a due Subjecti  n to this  Divine Power  I grew into a nearer Ac  uaintance with the LORD and the LORD  ouchsafed to speak unto me in the Inward of  y Soul and to open my Understanding in his  ear to receive  Counsel  from Him so that I  ot only at sometimes heard his Voice but  ould distinguish his Voice from the Voice of  he Enemy  As thus I daily waited on the LORD a weighty and unusual Exercise came upon me which bowed my Spirit very low before the LORD I had seen in the  Light of the Lord  he horrible Guilt of those deceitful  Priests    f divers Sorts and Denominations who made  Trade  of PREACHING and for  filthy Lucre  ake  held the People  always Learning  yet so  aught them as that by their  Teaching  and  Ministry  they were never able  to come to the Knowledge  much less to the Acknowledgment  f the Truth  For as they themselves hated the  Light  because their own  Deeds were Evil  so  y  Reviling Reproaching  and  Blaspheming  the TRUE LIGHT  wherewith every Man that  ometh into the World is Enlightned  John  hey begat in the People a Disesteem of the  Light  and laboured as much as in them lay  o keep their Hearers in the  Darkness  that they might not be turned to the  Light  in  themselves  est by the  Light  they should discover the  Wickedness  of these their  Deceitful Teachers  and turn from them  Against this Practice of these  false Teachers  the  Zeal  of the LORD had flamed in my Breast sor some time And now the Burthen of the Word of the LORD against them fell heavy upon me with Command to proclaim His Controversie against them  Fain would I have been excused from this Service which I judged too heavy for me  Wherefore I besought the Lord to take this Weight from off me who was in every respect but young and lay it upon some other of his Servants of whom he had many who were much more able and fit for it But the Lord would not be intreated but continued the Burden upon me with greater weight  requiring  Obedience  from me and promising to assist me therein Whereupon I arose from my Bed and in the Fear and Dread of the Lord committed to Writing what He in the Motion of his  Divine Spirit  dictated to me to write When I had done it though the Sharpness of the Message therein delivered was hard to my Nature to be the Publisher of yet I found Acceptance with the Lord in my Obedience to his Will and his Peace filled my Heart As soon as I could I communicated to my Friends what I had written and it was Printed in the Year in one Sheet of Paper under the Title of  An Alarm to the  PRIESTS or  A Message from Heaven to forewarn them    c  Some time after the Publishing of this Paper  aving Occasion to go to  London  I went to visit  George Fox  the younger who with another  riend  was then a Prisoner in a  Messenger  's  ands I had never seen him nor he me be  re yet this Paper lying on the Table before  im he pointing to it asked me  If I was  e Person that writ it  I told him I was  It's  uch  said the other Friend  that they bear it  is  replied he  their Portion and they must  ear it  While I was then in  London  I went to a  tle Meeting of Friends which was then held  the House of one  Humphry Bache  a Gold  mith at the Sign of the Snail in  Towerstreet  was then a very troublesome Time not from  e Government but from the Rabble of Boys  d rude People who upon the Turn of the  imes at the Return of the KING took Li  erty to be very abusive  When the Meeting ended a pretty Number  these unruly Folk were got together at the  oor ready to receive the Friends as they came  th not only with evil Words but with  ows which I saw they bestowed freely on  me of them that were gone out before me  d expected I should have my Share of when  came amongst them But quite contrary to  y Expectation when I came out they said  e to another  Let him alone Don't meddle  th him he is no  Quaker  I'll warrant you  This struck me and was worse to me than  they had laid their Fists on me as they did  on others I was troubled to think what th  Matter was or what these Rude People saw i  me that made them not take me for a  Quake  And upon a close Examination of my self wit  respect to my Habit and Deportment I coul  not find any thing to place it on but that  had then on my Head a large  MountierCap  Black Velvet the Skirt of which being turne  up in Folds looked it seems somewhat abo  the then Common Garb of a  Quaker  and th  put me out of Conceit with my Cap  I came at this time to  London  from  Isa  Penington  's and thither I went again in  way Home and while I staid there among other Friends who came thither  Thomas Loe  Oxford  was one A faithful and diligent  +bourer he was in the Work of the Lord a  an excellent Ministerial Gift he had And  in my Zeal for Truth being very desirous t  my Neighbours might have the Opporunity  hearing the Gospel the glad Tidings of Salv  +tion livingly and powerfully preached amo  them entred into Communication with h  about it offering to procure some convenie  Place in the Town where I lived for a Me  +ing to be held and to invite my Neighbo  to it if he could give me any Ground to  +pect his Company at it He told me he  not at his own Command but at the Lord's  he knew not how he might dispose of him  wish'd me if I found when I was come home t  the thing continued with Weight upon my Mi  and that I could get a fit Place for a Meeting  would advertize him of it by a few Lines directed to him in  Oxford  whither he was then going and he might then let me know how his Freedom stood in that Matter  When therefore I was come home and had treated with a Neighbour for a Place to have a Meeting in I wrote to my Friend  Thomas Loe  to acquaint him that I had procured a Place for a Meeting and would invite Company to it if he would fix the Time and give  e some Ground to hope that he would be  t it  This Letter I sent by a Neighbour to  Thame  o be given to a Dyer of  Oxford  who constant  y kept  Thame  Market with whom I was pretty well acquainted having sometimes formerly used him not only in his way of Trade  ut to carry Letters between my Brother and  e when he was a  Student  in that  University  r which he was always paid and had been  o careful in the Delivery that our Letters had  lways gone safe until now But this time  Providence  so ordering or at least for my Tryal permitting it this Letter of mine in  tead of being delivered according to its Dire  tion was seized and carried as I was told  o the Lord  Faulkland  who was then called  LordLieutenant  of that County  The Occasion of this Stopping of Letters at  hat time was that mad Prank of those in  atuated  FifthMonarchyMen  who from their MeetingHouse in  ColemanStreet London  break  ng forth in Arms under the Command of  their Chieftain  Venner  made an Insurrection in the City on Pretence of setting up th  Kingdom of Jesus  who it is said they expect+ed would come down from Heaven to be thei  Leader So little understood they the  Natur  of his Kingdom  though he himself had de+clared it was not of this World  The KING a little before his Arrival in  England  had by his  Declaration  from  Breda  given Assurance of Liberty to  Tender Conscience  and that no Man should be disquieted or called in Question for  Differences of Opinion  in Mat+ters of  Religion  who do not disturb the  Peace o  the Kingdom  Upon this Assurance  Dissenters  o  all sorts relied and held themselves secur  But now by this Frantick Action of a few ho  brain'd Men the King was by some holde  Discharged from this his ROYAL WORD an  PROMISE in his foregoing  Declaration  pub+lickly given And hereupon Letters were in+tercepted and broken open for Discovery o  suspected Plots and Designs against the Go+vernment and not only Dissenters Meetings o  all sorts without Distinction were disturbed  but very many were Imprisoned in most Parts throughout the Nation and great Search the  was in all Countries for suspected Persons who if not found at Meetings were fetch'd in from their own Houses  The  Lord Lieutenant  so called of  Oxfordshire  had on this Occasion taken  Thomas Loe  and many other of our Friends at a Meeting and sen  them Prisoners to  Oxford  Castle just before my  Letter was brought to his Hand wherein I  ad invited  Thomas Loe  to a Meeting and he  utting the worst Construction upon it as if I a poor Simple Lad had intended a  Seditious  Meeting in order to raise  Rebellion  ordered  wo of the  Deputy Lieutenants  who lived near  to me to send a Party of Horse to fetch  e in  Accordingly while I wholly ignorant of  hat had passed at  Oxford  was in daily Ex  ctation of an agreeable Answer to my Letter  me a Party of Horse one Morning to my Fa  er's Gate and asked for me  It so fell out that my Father was at that  e from home I think in  London  whereup  he that Commanded the Party alighted and  me in My eldest Sister hearing the Noise  Soldiers came hastily up into my Chamber  d told me there were Soldiers below who  quired for me I forthwith went down to  em and found the Commander was a  Bar  of  Thame  and one who had always been  Barber  till I was a  Quaker  His Name was  ately  a bold brisk Fellow  I asked him what his Business was with me  told me I must go with him I demand  to see his Warrant He laid his Hand on his  ord and said  That was his Warrant  I told  Though that was not a legal Warrant  I would not dispute it but was ready to  r Injuries He told me  He could not help  he was commanded to bring me forthwith be  the Deputy Lieutenants  and therefore desired  me to order an Horse to be got ready because he was in haste I let him know I had no Horse of my own and would no  meddle with any of my Father's Horses in hi  Absence especially and that therefore if h  would have me with him he must carry me a  he could  He thereupon taking my Sister aside told he  he found I was resolute and his Orders were pe  +emptory wherefore he desired that she woul  give Order for an Horse to be made ready fo  me for otherwise he should be forced to mou  me behind a Trooper which would be ver  unsuitable for me and which he was very u  +willing to do She thereupon ordered an Hor  to be got ready upon which when I had take  Leave of my Sisters I mounted and went of  not knowing whither he intended to carry me  He had Orders it seems to take some  +thers also in a Neighbouring Village who  Names he had but their Houses he did n  know Wherefore as we rode he asked m  If I knew such and such Men whom he na  +ed and where they lived and when he unde  +stood that I knew them he desired me to she  him their Houses No said I I scorn to  an Informer against my Neighbours to bri  them into Trouble He thereupon riding  and fro found by Enquiry most of their Ho  +ses but as it happened found none of the  at Home at which I was glad  At length he brought me to the House of  e called Esquire  Clark  of  Weston  by  Thame  ho being afterwards Knighted was called  r  John Clark  a jolly Man too much addict  to Drinking in  soberer  Times but was now  own more  Licensious  that way as the Times  d now more favour  Debauchery  He and I  d known one another for some Years though  t very intimately having met sometimes at  e Lord  Wenman  's Table  This  Clark  was one of the DeputyLieute  nts whom I was to be brought before And  had gotten another thither to joyn with him  tendering me the Oaths whom I knew only  Name and Character he was called Esquire  owls  of  Grays  by  Henly  and reputed a Man  better Morals than the other  I was brought into the Hall and kept there  d as  Quakers  were not so common then as  ey now are and indeed even yet the more  the pity they are not common in that Part  the Country I was made a Spectacle and  zingstock to the Family and by divers I  s diversly set upon Some spake to me cour  ously with Appearance of Compassion O  ers ruggedly with evident Tokens of Wrath  d Scorn But though I gave them the Hear  g of what they said which I could not well  id yet I said little to them but keeping  y Mind as well retired as I could I breathed  the Lord for Help and Strength from him  bear me up and carry me through this Try  that I might not sink under it or be prevailed  on by any Means fair or foul to d  any thing that might dishonour or displease my GOD  At length came forth the Justices themselve  for so they were as well as Lieutenants an  after they had saluted me they discoursed wit  me pretty familiarly and though  Clark  woul  sometimes be a little jocular and waggis  which was somewhat natural to him ye  Knowls  treated me very civilly not seeming  take any Offence at my not standing bare b  +fore him And when a young Priest who  I understood was Chaplain in the Famil  took upon him pragmatically to reprove me  standing with my Hat on before the Mag  +strates and snatch'd my Cap from of  Head  Knowls  in a pleasant Manner correct  him telling him he mistook himself in taki  a Cap for a Hat for mine was a  Mountier  Ca  and bid him give it me again which  though unwillingly doing I forthwith p  it on my Head again and thenceforward no  meddled with me about it  Then they began to Examine me putti  divers Questions to me relating to the pres  Disturbances in the Nation occasioned by t  late foolish Insurrection of those frantick  Fif  MonarchyMen  To all which I readily A  +swered according to the Simplicity of  Heart and Innocency of my Hands for I h  neither done nor thought any Evil agai  the Government  But they endeavoured to affright me with  reats of Danger telling me with  Innuen  s  that for all my Pretence of Innocency  ere was high Matter against me which if would stand out  would be brought forth and  at under my own Hand I knew not what  ey meant by this but I knew my Innocency  d kept to it  At length when they saw I regarded not  eir Threats in general they asked me  If I  ew one  Thomas Loe  and had written of late  him  I then remembred my Letter which  then I had not thought of and thereupon  nkly told them That I did both know  Tho  s Loe  and had lately written to him but  at as I knew I had written no Hurt so I did  t fear any Danger from that Letter They  ook their Heads and said  It was dangerous to  rite Letters to appoint Meetings in such trouble  e Times  They added  That by appointing a Meeting and  eavouring to gather a Concourse of People toge  r in such a Juncture especially as this was I had  dered my self a dangerous Person And there  e they could do no less than Tender me the Oaths  Allegience  and  Supremacy  which therefore  y required me to take  I told them If I could take any Oath at all  would take the Oath of  Allegiance  for I owed  legiance to the KING But I durst not  ke any Oath because my Lord and Master  SUS CHRIST had commanded me not  Swear at all  and if I brake his Command  I should thereby both dishonour and disple  him  Hereupon they undertook to reason with m  and used many Words to perswade me Th  that Command of Christ related only to common a  prophane Swearing not to Swearing before a Ma  +strate  I heard them and saw the Weakn  of their Arguings but did not return the  any Answer for I found my present Busin  was not to dispute but to suffer and that  was not safe for me in this my weak and Ch  +dish State especially to enter into Reasoni  with sharp quick witty and learned Me  lest I might thereby hurt both the Cause  Truth which I was to bear Witness to a  my self Therefore I chose rather to be a Fo  and let them triumph over me than by  Weakness give them Advantage to triumph  +ver the Truth And my Spirit being close  exercised in a deep travel towards the Lord  earnestly begged of him that he would  pleased to keep me faithful to the Testimo  he had committed to me and not suffer me  be taken in any of the Snares which the E  +my laid for me And blessed be his h  Name He heard my Cries and preserved  out of them  When the Justices saw they could not bo  me to their Wills they told me they must se  me to Prison I told them I was contented  suffer whatsoever the Lord should suffer the  to inflict upon me Whereupon they wit  +drew into the Parlour to consult together wh  o do with me leaving me mean while to be gazed on in the Hall  After a pretty long Stay they came forth to me again with great shew of Kindness telling me They were  very unwilling to send me to Goal  ut would be as favourable to me as possibly they  ould and that if I would take the Oaths they would pass by all the other Matter which they had  gainst me  I told them I knew they could not  stly have any thing against me for I had  either done nor intended any thing against  he Government or against them And as to  he Oaths I assured them that my refusing  hem was meerly Matter of Conscience to me  nd that I durst not take any Oath whatsoever  it were to save my Life  When they heard this they left me again  nd went and signed a  Mittimus  to send me to  rison at  Oxford  and charged one of the Troo  ers that brought me thither who was one of  e newly raised  MilitiaTroop  to convey me  fe to  Oxford  But before we departed they  lled the Trooper aside and gave him private  structions what he should do with me  hich I knew nothing of till I came thither  t expected I should go directly to the Castle  It was almost dark when we took Horse  d we had about Nine or Ten Miles to ride  e Weather thick and cold for it was about  e beginning of the  Twelfth Month  and I had  Boots being snatch'd away from home on  suddain which made me not care to ride  ry fast And my Guard who was a Tradesman  in  Thame  having Confidence in me that I would not give him the slip jogged on without heeding how I followed him  When I was gone about a Mile on the Way I overtook my Father's Man who without my Knowledge had followed me at a distance to  Weston  and waited there abroad in the Stables till he understood by some of the Servants that I was to go to  Oxford  and then ran before resolving not to leave me till he saw what they would do with me  I would have had him return home but he desired me not to send him back but let him run on till I came to  Oxford  I considered that it was a Token of the Fellows affectionate Kindness to me and that possibly I might send my Horse home by him and thereupon stopping my Horse I bid him if he would go on Get up behind me He modestly refused telling me  He could run as fast as I rid  But when I had told him If he would not ride he should not go forward he rather than leave me leap'd up behind me and on we went  But he was not willing I should have gone at all He had a great Cudgel in his Hand and a strong Arm to use it and being a stout Fellow he had a great Mind to Fight the Trooper and Rescue me Wherefore he desired me to turn my Horse and and ride off And if the Trooper offered to pursue leave him to deal with him  I check'd him sharply for that and charged him to be quiet and not think hardly of the poor Trooper who could do no other nor less than he did and who though he had an ill Journey in going with me carried himself civilly to me I told him also that I had no need to fly for I had done nothing that would bring Guilt or Fear upon me neither did I go with an ill Will and this quieted the Man So on we went but were so far cast behind the Trooper that we had lost both Sight and Hearing of him and I was fain to mend my Pace to get up to him again  We came pretty late into  Oxford  on the Seventh Day of the Week which was the Market Day and contrary to my Expectation which was to have been carried to the Castle my Trooper stop't in the  HighStreet  and calling at a Shop asked for the Master of the House who coming to the Door he delivered to him the  Mittimus  and with it a Letter from the DeputyLieutenants or one of them which when he had read he asked where the Prisoner was Whereupon the Soldier pointing to me he desired me to alight and come in which when I did he received me civilly  The Trooper being discharged of his Prisoner marched back and my Father's Man seeing me settled in better Quarters than he expected mounted my Horse and went off with him  I did not presently understand the Quality of my Keeper but I found him a genteel  courteous Man by Trade a  LinnenDraper  and as I afterwards understood he was the  CityMarshall  had a Command in the County Troop and was a Person of good Repute in the Place his Name was  Galloway  Whether I was committed to him out of Regard to my Father that I might not be thrust into a Common Goal or out of a Politick Design to keep me from the Conversation of my Friends in hopes that I might be draw  to abandon this Profession which I had but lately taken up I do not know But this I know that though I wanted no civil Treatment nor kind Accommodations where I was yet after once I understood that many  Frien  were Prisoners in the Castle and amongst the rest  Thomas Loe  I had much rather have been among them there with all the Inconveniencies they underwent than where I was with the best Entertainment But this was my present Lot and therefore with this I endeavoured to be content  It was quickly known in the City that a  Quaker  was brought in Prisoner and committed to the Marshall Whereupon the Men  Friends  being generally Prisoners already in the Castle some of the Women  Friends  came to enquire after me and to visit me as  Silas Norton  's Wife and  Thomas Loe  's Wife who were Sisters and another Woman  Friend  who lived in the same Street where I was whose Husband was not a  Quaker  but kindly affected towards them a  Baker  by Trade and his Name as I remember  Ryland  By some of these an Account was soon given  the Friends who were Prisoners in the Castle of my being taken up and brought Prisoner to the Marshall's Whereupon it  eased the Lord to move on the Heart of my  ear Friend  Thomas Loe  to salute me with a  ery tender and affectionate Letter in the fol  owing Terms  My Beloved FRIEND  IN the Truth and Love of the Lord Jesus by which Life and Salvation is revealed in the  aints is my dear Love unto thee and in much  enderness do I Salute thee And dear Heart a  ime of Tryal God hath permitted to come upon us  try our Faith and Love to Him and this will  ork for the good of them that through Patience  dure to the End And I believe GOD will be  orified through our Sufferings and His Name will  exalted in the Patience and Longsuffering of  s Chosen When I heard that thou wast called  to this Tryal with the Servants of the Most High  give thy Testimony to the Truth of what we have  lieved it came into my Heart to write unto thee  nd to greet thee with the Embraces of the Power  f an Endless Life where our Faith stands and  nity is felt with the Saints for ever Well my  ear Friend let us live in the pure Counsel of the Lord and dwell in his Strength which gives us Power and Sufficiency to endure all things for his Name's sake and then our Crown and Reward will  be with the Lord for ever and the Blessings  his Heavenly Kingdom will be our Portion O  dear Heart let us give up all freely into the W  of God that God may be glorified by us and  comforted together in the Lord Jesus which  the Desire of my Soul who am  Thy dear and loving Friend in th  Eternal Truth THOMAS LO  We are more than Fourty here which suffer i  +nocently for the Testimony of a good Cons  +ence because we cannot Swear and bre  Christ's Commands And we are all well  the Blessings and Presence of God is with  Friends here Salute thee Farewell  The Power and the Wisdom of the Lord God  with thee  Amen  Greatly was my Spirit refreshed and  Heart gladded at the Reading of this Cons  +lating Letter from my Friend and my So  blessed the Lord for his Love and tender Goo  +ness to me in moving his Servant to wri  thus unto me  But I had Cause soon after to double a  redouble my thankful Acknowledgment to t  Lord my God who put it into the Heart  my dear Friend  Isaac Penington  also to vi  me with some encouraging Lines from  Alesbu  Goal where he was then a Prisoner and fro  whence having heard that I was carried P  +soner to  Oxford  he thus saluted me  Dear THOMAS  GREAT hath been the Lord's Goodness to thee in Calling thee out of that Path of Vanity and Death wherein thou wast running towards Destruction to give thee a living Name and an Inheritance of Life among his People which certainly will be the End of thy Faith in Him and Obedience to Him And let it not be a light thing in thine Eyes that He now accounteth thee worthy to suffer among his choice Lambs that He might make thy Crown weightier and thy Inheritance  he fuller O that that Eye and Heart may be  ept open in thee which knoweth the Value of these  hings And that thou mayst be kept close to the Feeling of the Life that thou mayst be fresh in thy Spirit in the midst of thy Sufferings and mayst reap  he Benefit of them finding that pared off thereby which hindereth the Bubblings of the Everlasting Springs and maketh unfit for the breaking forth  nd Enjoyment of the pure Power This is the  rief Salutation of my dear Love to thee which  esireth thy Strength and Settlement in the Power nd the utter weakning of thee as to self My dear Love is to thee with dear  Thomas Goodyare  nd the rest of Imprisoned Friends I remain  Thine in the Truth to which the Lord my God preserve me Single and Faithful  I P  rom  Alesbury  Goal  th of th Mo  Though these Epistolary Visits in the Lov  os God were very Comfortable and Confirm+ing to me and my Heart was thankful to th  Lord for them yet I honed after personal Con+versation with Friends and it was hard  thought that there should be so many faithfu  Servants of God so near me yet I should no  be permitted to come at them to enjoy thei  Company and reap both the Pleasure and Be+nefit of their sweet Society  For although my MarshallKeeper was ve  kind to me and allowed me the Liberty of h  House yet he was not willing I should b  seen abroad the rather perhaps because h  understood I had been pretty well known i  that City Yet once the Friendly  Baker  g  him to let me step over to his House and onc  and but once I prevailed with him to let m  visit my Friends in the Castle but it was wit  these Conditions That I should not go fort  till it was dark That I would muffle my se  up in my Cloak and that I would not sta  out late All which I punctually observed  When I came thither though there we  many Friends Prisoners I scarce knew one  them by Face except  Thomas Loe  whom  had once seen at  Isaac Penington  's Nor did a  of them know me though they had generall  heard that such a Young Man as I was Co  +vinced of the Truth and come among Friend  Our Salutation to each other was very Grav  and Solemn nor did we entertain one anothe  with much Talk or with common Discourse  ut most of the little Time I had with them was spent in a silent Retiredness of Spirit waiting upon the Lord Yet before we part  d we imparted one to another some of the Exercises we had gone through and they  eming willing to understand the Ground and Manner of my Commitment I gave them a  rief Account thereof letting  Thomas Loe  ore particularly know that I had directed a  etter to him which having fallen into the  and of the Lord Lieutenant was so far as  could learn the immediate Cause of my be  g taken up  Having staid with them as long as my li  itted time would permit which I thought  as but very short that I might keep Touch  ith my Keeper and come home in due time  took leave of my Friends there and with  utual Embraces parting returned to my in  me sense more easie but in others less easie  rison where after this I staid not long be  re I was brought back to my Father's House  For after my Father was come home who  I observed before was from home when I  as taken he applied himself to those Justices  at had committed me and not having dis  liged them when he was in Office easily  tained to have me sent home which between  m and them was thus contrived  There was about this time a general Muster  nd Training of the  Militia  Forces at  Oxford  whither on that Occasion came the Lord  ieutenant and the DeputyLieutenants of the  County of which Number they who Committed me were two  When they had been a while together and the Marshall with them he stept suddainly in and in haste told me  I must get ready quickly to go out of Town  and that  a Soldier would come by and by to go with me  This said he hastned to them again not giving me any Intimation how I was to go or whither  I needed not much time to get ready in but I was uneasie in thinking what the Friend  of the Town would think of this my suddai  and private Removal and I feared lest a  Report should be raised that I had purchase  my Liberty by an Unfaithful Complian  Wherefore I was in care how to speak wi  some Friend about it and that friendly Bake  whose Wife was a Friend living on the oth  side of the Street at a little Distance I we  out at a back Door intending to step over t  Way to their House and return immediatel  It so fell out that some of the Lieutenan  of whom  Esq  Clark  who Committed me w  one were standing in a Balcony at a gre  Inn or Tavern just over th Place where I w  to go by and he spying me called out to t  Soldiers who stood thick below in the Stree  to stop me They being generally Gent  +mens Servants and many of them knowin  me did civilly forbear to lay hold on me b  calling modestly after me said  Stay Sir sta  pray come back  I heard but was not willin  to hear therefore rather mended my Pa  at I might have got within the Door But  calling earnestly after me and charging  em to stop me some of them were fain to  and laying hold on me before I could o  the Door brought me back to my Place  ain  Being thus disappointed I took a Pen and  k and wrote a few Lines which I sealed  and gave to the Apprentice in the Shop  ho had carried himself handsomely to me  d desired him to deliver it to that Friend  ho was their Neighbour which he promised  do  By that time I had done this came the Sol  er that was appointed to conduct me out of  wn I knew the Man for he lived within  Mile of me being through Poverty reduced  keep an AleHouse but he had lived in bet  Fashion having kept an Inn at  Thame  d by that means knew how to behave him  f civilly and did so to me  He told me he was ordered to wait on me  Whately  and to tarry there at such an Inn  Esq  Clark  came thither who would then  ke me home with him in his Coach Ac  rdingly to  Whately  we walked which is from  ford  some four or five Miles and long we  d not been there before  Clark  and a great  mpany of rude Men came in  He alighted and stay'd a while to eat and  ink though he came but from  Oxford  and  vited me to eat with him but I though I  d need enough refused it for indeed their  Conversation was a Burthen to my Life an  made me often think of and pity good  Lot  He seem'd at that time to be in a sort  mix't Temper between Pleasantness and Sou  +ness He would sometimes Joke which wa  natural to him and cast out a jesting Flurt a  me but he would rail maliciously against th  Quakers If  said he to me  the King wou  authorize me to do it I would not leave a  Quak  alive in  England  except you I would make  more  added he  to set my Pistol to their Ears a  shoot them through the Head than I would to  a Dog  I told him I was sorry he had so  an Opinion of the  Quakers  but I was glad  had no Cause for it and I hoped he would  of a better Mind  I had in my Hand a little WalkingSti  with a Head on it which he commended a  took out of my Hand to look on it but I sa  his Invention was to search it whether it h  a Tuck in it for he tryed to have drawn t  Head but when he found it was fast he  turned it to me  He told me  I should ride with him to his Ho  in his Coach  which was nothing pleasant  me for I had rather have gone on Foot  bad as the Ways were that I might have bee  out of his Company Wherefore I took no n  +tice of any Kindness in the Offer but onl  Answered I was at his Disposal not min  own  But when we were ready to go the Marsha  came to me and told me  If I pleased I shou  ide his Horse and he would go in the Coach with Mr  Clark I was glad of the Offer and only  ld him he should take out his Pistols then  r I would not ride with them He took  em out and laid them in the Coach by him  d away we went  It was a very fine Beast that I was set on  y much the best in the Company But tho'  e was very tall yet the Ways being very foul  found it needful as soon as I was out of  own to alight and take up the Stirrups  ean while they driving hard on I was so  r behind that being at length missed by the  ompany a Soldier was sent back to look  er me  As soon as I had fitted my Stirrups and was  emounted I gave the Rein to my Mare  hich being Couragious and Nimble and im  tient of Delay made great Speed to recover  e Company And in a Narrow Passage the  ldier who was my Barber that had fetch'd  e from home and I met upon so brisk a  allop that we had enough to do on either  de to take up our Horses and avoid a Brush When we were come to  Weston  where  Esq  ark  lived he took the Marshall and some  hers with him into the Parlour but I was  ft in the Hall to be exposed a second time  r the Family to gaze on  At length himself came out to me leading  his Hand a beloved Daughter of his a  oung Woman of about Eighteen Years of  ge who wanted nothing to have made her  Comely but Gravity An airy Piece she was  and very merry she made her self at m  When she had throughly viewed me He pu  +ting her a little forward towards me said  Her  Tom  will you Kiss her  I was grieved and a+shamed at this frothy Lightness and I suppos  he perceived it whereupon he drew neare  as if he would have whispered and the  said  Will you lie with her  At which I wi  a disdainful Look turning away he said  think it would be better for you than to be a Qu  +ker  and so little Consideration and Rega  to Modesty had she that she added  I thi  so too  This was all by Candle light And wh  they had made themselves as much Sport wi  me as they would the Marshall took his lea  of them and mounting me on a Horse  Clark  's had me Home to my Father's th  Night  Next Morning before the Marshall we  away my Father and he consulted togeth  how to intangle me I felt there were Snar  laid but I did not know in what manner or  what End till the Marshall was ready to g  And then coming where I was to take  leave of me he desired me to take notice  Th  although he had brought me home to my Fathe  House again yet I was not discharged from  Imprisonment but was his Prisoner still and t  he had committed me to the Care of my Father  see me forthcoming whenever I should be cal  for And therefore he expected I should in all thi  serve my Father's Orders and not go at any time  m the House without his Leave  Now I plainly saw the Snare and to what  d it was laid And I asked him if this De  e was not contrived to keep me from going  Meetings He said  I must not go to Meetings  ereupon I desired him to take Notice That  would not own my self a Prisoner to any Man  ile I coninued here That if he had Power  etain me Prisoner he might take me back  in with him if he would and I should not  se to go with him But I bid him assure  self that while I was at home I would  e my Liberty both to go to Meetings and  isit  Friends  He smiled and said  If I would  esolute he could not help it  and so took his  e of me  By this I perceived that the Plot was of my  er's laying to have brought me under such  Engagement as should have ty'd me from  g to Meetings and thereupon I expected  ould have a new Exercise from my Father  was the constant manner of my Father to  all the Keys of the Outdoors of his House  ich were Four and those link't upon a  in brought up into his Chamber every  ht and fetch'd out from thence in the  ning so that none could come in or go  in the Night without his Knowledge  knowing this suspected that if I got not  before my Father came down I should be  ed from going out at all that Day Where  the Passage from my Chamber lying by  his ChamberDoor I went down softly with+out my Shoos and as soon as the Maid had o+pened the Door I went out though too early and walk'd towards the Meeting at  Meadle  four long Miles off  I expected to have been talked with about it when I came home but heard nothing of it my Father resolving to watch me better next time  This I was aware of and therefore on the next  First Day  I got up early went down softly and hid my self in a BackRoom before the Maid was stirring  When she was up she went into my Father's Chamber for the Keys but he bid her leave them till he was up and he would bring them down himself which he did and tarried in the Kitchin through which he expected I would go  The manner was That when the commo  Doors were opened the Keys were hung upo  a Pin in the Hall While therefore my Fathe  staid in the Kitchin expecting my Coming  stepping gently out of the Room where I wa  reached the Keys and opening another Doo  not often used slipped out and so got away  I thought I had gone off undiscovered Bu  whether my Father saw me through a Win+dow or by what other means he knew of my going I know not but I had gone but a littl  Way before I saw him coming after me  The Sight of him put me to a stand in my Mind whether I should go on or stop Ha  been in any other Case than that of Going to  Meeting I could not i  any wise have gone a  ep further But I considered that the intent  my Fathers endeavouring to stop me was to  der me from obeying the Call of my heaven  Father and to stop me from going to wor  ip him in the Assembly of his People upon  s I found it my Duty to go on and observ  g that my Father gained Ground upon me  mewhat mended my Pace  This he observing mended his Pace also  at length Ran Whereupon I ran also  a fair Course we had through a large Mea  w of his which lay behind his House and  of sight of the Town He was not I sup  e then above Fifty Years of Age and be  light of Body and nimble of Foot he held  to it for a while But afterwards slacking  Pace to take Breath and observing that I  gotten Ground of him he turned back  went home and as I afterwards under  d telling my Sisters how I had served him  said  Nay if he will take so much Pains to Go  him Go if he will  And from that time for  rd he never attempted to stop me but left  to my liberty to Go when and whither I  uld Yet kept me at the usual Distance a  ing the Sight of me as much as he could  ot able to bear the Sight of my Hat on nor  ing to contend with me again about it  Nor was it long after this before I was left  only to my self but in a manner by my  For the Time appointed for the Coronation  of the KING which was the d of  d Month called  April  drawing on my  ther taking my two Sisters with him went  to  London  sometime before that they might  there in readiness and put themselves in  Condition to see that so great a Solemni  leaving no body in the House but my self a  a couple of Servants And though this was  +tended only for a Visit on that Occasion ye  proved the Breaking of the Family for he  +stowed both his Daughters there in Marria  and took Lodgings for himself so that aft  +wards they never returned to settle at  Cr  Being now at Liberty I walked over to  bury  with some other Friends to visit my  Friend  Isaac Penington  who was still a Pris  there With him I found dear  John Whit  and between Sixty and Seventy more be  wellnigh all the MenFriends that were  in the County of  Bucks  many of them  taken out of their Houses by Armed Men  sent to Prison as I had been for refusing  Swear Most of these were thrust into a  Room behind the Goal which had ancie  been a Malthouse but was now so deca  that it was scarce fit for a Doghouse A  open it lay that the Prisoners might have g  out at pleasure But these were purposely  there in confidence that they would not  out that there might be Room in the P  for others of other Professions and Na  whom the Goaler did not trust there  While this Imprisonment lasted which was  some Months I went afterwards thither  etimes to visit my suffering Brethren and  ause it was a pretty long way some eight  ine long Miles too far to be walked forward  backward in one Day I sometimes staid  ay or two there and lay in the Malthouse  ong my Friends with whom I delighted  e  After this Imprisonment was over I went  etimes to  Isaac Penington  's House at  Chal    to visit that Family and the Friends there  uts There was then a Meeting for the  st part twice a Week in his House but one  st Day  in four there was a more General  eting which was thence called the  Monthly  eting  to which resorted most of the  Friends  ther adjacent Meetings and to that I usu  went and sometimes made some stay  re  Here I came acquainted with a Friend of  don  whose Name was  Richard Greenaway  Trade a  Taylor  a very honest Man and one  o had received a Gift for the Ministry  He having been formerly in other Profes  s of Religion had then been acquainted  th one  John Ovy  of  Watlington  in  Oxfordshire  Man of some Note among the Professors  ere and understanding upon Enquiry  t I knew him he had some Discourse with  about him The Result whereof was that  having an Intention then shortly to visit  e Meetings of Friends in this County and  the adjoyning Parts of  Oxfordshire  and  Berksh  invited me to meet him upon notice giv  and to bear him Company in that Journ  and in the way bring him to  John Ovy  's Ho  with whom I was well acquainted wh  I did  We were kindly received the Man and  Wife being very glad to see both their  Friend  Richard Greenaway  and me also w  they had been very well acquainted with  +merly but had never seen me since I w  Quaker  Here we tarried that Night and in the  +vening had a little Meeting there with  few of  John Ovy  's People amongst who  G  declared the TRUTH which they a  +tively heard and did not oppose which at  time of Day we reckoned was pretty w  For many were apt to Cavil  This Visit gave  John Ovy  an Opportunity t  +quire of me after  Isaac Penington  whose Wri  those which he had written before he  among Friends he had Read and had a  Esteem of and he express'd a Desire to see  that he might have some Discourse with  if he knew how Whereupon I told him  if he would take the Pains to go to his Ho  I would bear him Company thither intro  him and Engage he should have a  Reception  This pleas'd him much and he embra  the Offer I undertook to give him Noti  a suitable time Which after I had gone  tle Journey with my Friend  Richard Greena  y  and was retured I did making Choice  the  Monthly Meeting  to go to  We met by Appointment at  StokenChurch  ith our Staves in our Hands like a couple of  lgrims intending to walk on Foot and ha  g taken some Refreshment and Rest at  Wic  mb  went on cheerfully in the Afternoon En  rtaining each other with Grave and Religi  s Discourse which made the Walk the ea  r and so reached thither in good time on  e  Seventh Day  of the Week  I gave my Friends an Account who this Per  n was whom I had brought to visit them  d the Ground of his Visit He had been a  ofessor of Religion from his Childhood to  s old Age for he was now both Grayheaded  d Elderly and was a Teacher at this time  nd had long been so amongst a People whe  er  Independants  or  Baptists  I do not well re  ember And so well thought of he was for  s Zeal and Honesty that in those late Pro  sing Times he was thrust into the  Commission  the Peace  and thereby lifted up upon the  ench which neither became him nor he it  r he wanted indeed most of the Qualifica  ons requisite for a  Justice of the Peace  an  tate  to defray the Charge of the Office and  bear him up in a Course of Living above  ontempt A competent Knowledge in the  aws and a Presence of Mind or Body or  oth to keep Offenders in some Awe in all  hich he was deficient For he was but a  Fellmonger  by Trade accustomed to ride upon  Pack of Skins and had very little Estate  little Knowledge in the Law and of but  mean Presence and Appearance to look  But as my Father I suppose was the mea  of getting him put into the Commission so  I know did what he could to countenance hi  in it and help him through it at every tur  till that turn came at the King's Retur  which turned them both out together  My Friends received me in affectionate Ki  +ness and my Companion with courteous Ci  +lity The Evening was spent in common  grave Conversation for it was not a prop  Season for Private Discourse both as we we  somewhat weary with our Walk and the  were other Companies of  Friends  come into  Family to be at the Meeting next Day  But in the Morning I took  John Ovy  into  private Walk in a pleasant Grove near t  House whither  Isaac Penington  came to  and there in Discourse both Answered all h  Questions Objections and Doubts and ope  +ed to him the Principles of  TRUTH  to  both Admiration and present Satisfactio  Which done we went in to take some Re+freshment before the Meeting began  Of those  Friends  who were come over Nigh  in order to be at the Meeting there was  Isaac  Brother  William Penington  a Merchant  London  and  with him a  Friend  whose Nam  I have forgotten a  Grocer  of  Colchester  in  Essex  and there was also our Friend  George Whitehead  whom I had not that I remember seen  efore  The Nation had been in a Ferment ever  ce that mad Action of the Frantick  Fifth  onarchyMen  and was not yet settled but  orms like ThunderShowers flew here and  ere by Coast so that we could not promise  r selves any Safety or Quiet in our Meet  gs And though they had escaped Disturb  ce for some little time before yet so it fell  t that a Party of Horse were appointed to  me and break up the Meeting that Day  ough we knew nothing of it till we heard  d saw them  The Meeting was scarce fully gathered when  ey came But we that were in the Family  d many others were settled in it in great  ace and Stilness when on a suddain the  ancing of the Horses gave Notice that  ght'ning was at hand  We all sate still in our Places except my  mpanion  John Ovy  who sate next to me  t he being of a Profession that approved  Pe  's Advice to his Lord  To save himself  soon  k the Alarm and with the Nimbleness of  Stripling Cutting a Caper over the Form  at stood before him ran quickly out at a pri  te Door which he had before observed  hich led through the Parlour into the Gardens  d from thence into an Orchard where he  d himself in a Place so Obscure and withal  convenient for his Intelligence by Observation  of what passed that no one of the Famil  could scarce have found a likelier  By that time he was got into his Burrow  came the Soldiers in being a Party of th  County Troop commanded by  Matthew Ar  +dale  of  Wiccomb  He behaved himself civill  and said  He was commanded to break up t  Meeting and carry the Men before a Justice of t  Peace  but he said  He would not take all  an  thereupon began to pick and chuse chiefly a  his Eye guided him for I suppose he knew ve+ry few  He took  Isaac Penington  and his Brothe  George Whitehead  and the Friend of  Colcheste  and me with Three or Four more of t  Country who belonged to that Meeting  He was not fond of the Work and th  made him take no more But he must ta  some he said and bid us provide to go wi  him before Sir  William Boyer  of  Denham  w  was a Justice of the Peace  Isaac Penington  be+ing but weakly rode but the rest of us wa  +ed thither it being about four Miles  When we came there the Justice carrie  himself civilly to us all courteously to  Isa  Penington  as being a Gentleman of his Neigh+bourhood and there was nothing charged a+gainst us but that we were met together with+out Word or Deed Yet this being contrary t  a late Proclamation given forth upon the risin  of the  FifthMonarchyMen  whereby all Disse  +ter's Meetings were forbidden the Justice coul  do no less than take Notice of us  Wherefore he Examined all of us whom he did not personally know asking our Names and the places of our Respective Habitations But when he had them and considered from what distant Parts of the Nation we came he was amazed For  G Whitehead  was of  Westmorland  in the North of  England  The  Grocer  was of  Essex  I was of  Oxfordshire  and  W Penington  was of  London  Hereupon he told us  That our Case look't Ill and he was sorry for it for how  said he  can it be imagined that so many could jump altogether at one Time and Place from such remote Quarters and Parts of the Kingdom if it was not by Combination and Appointment  He was Answered That we were so far from coming thither by Agreement or Appointment that none of us knew of the others Coming and for the most of us we had never seen one another before and that therefore he might impute it to  Chance  or if he pleased to  Providence  He urged upon us  That an Insurrection had been lately made by Armed Men who pretended to be more Religious than others that that Insurrect  on had been Plotted and Contrived in their MeetingHouse where they Assembled under Colour of Worshipping GOD that in their MeetingHouse they hid their Arms and Armed themselves and out of their MeetingHouse issued forth in Arms and killed many so that the Government could not be safe unless such Meetings were supprest  We reply'd We hoped he would distinguish and make a Difference between the  Guilty  and the  Innocent  and between those who were Principled for  Fighting  and those who were Principled  against it  which we were and had been always known to be so That our Meetings were publick our Doors standing open to all Comers of all Ages Sexes and Perswasions Men Women and Children and those that were not of our Religion as well as those that were and that it was next to Madness for People to Plot in such Meetings  He told us  We must find Sureties for our good Behaviour and to Answer our Contempt of the King's Proclamation at the next General QuarterSessions or else he must Commit us  We told him that knowing our Innocency and that we had not misbehaved our selves nor did meet in Contempt of the King's Authority but purely in obedience to the LORD's Requirings to Worship Him which we held our selves in Duty bound to do we could not consent to be bound for that would imply Guilt which we were free from  Then  said he  I must commit you  And ordered his Clerk to make a  Mittimus  And divers  Mittimusses  were made but none of them would hold for still when they came to be read we found such Flaws in them as made him through them aside and write more  He had his Eye often upon me for I was a young Man and had at that time a Black Suit on At length he bid me follow him and  went into a private Room and shut the Door upon me  I knew not what he meant by this but I cryed in Spirit to the Lord that He would be pleased to be a Mouth and Wisdom to me and keep me from being Entangled in any Snare  He asked me many Questions concerning my Birth my Education my Acquaintance in  Oxfordshire  particularly what Men of Note I knew there To all which I gave him brief but plain and true Answers naming several Families of the best Rank in that Part of the Country where I dwelt  He asked me How long I had been of this Way and how I came to be of it Which when I had given him some Account of he began to perswade me to leave it and return to the right Way the  Church  as he called it I desired him to spare his Pains in that respect and forbear any Discourse of that kind for that I was fully satisfied the Way I was in was the right Way and hoped the Lord would so preserve me in it that nothing should be able to draw or drive me out of it He seemed not pleased with that and thereupon went out to the rest of the Company and I followed him glad in my Heart that I had escaped so well and Praising God for my Deliverance  When he had taken his Seat again at the upper End of a fair Hall he told us he was not willing to take the utmost Rigour of the Law against us but would be as favourable  to us as he could And therefore he would dis+charge he said Mr  Penington  himself becaus  he was but at Home in his own House An  he would discharge Mr  Penington  of  London  because he come but as a Relation to visit hi  Brother And he would discharge the  Groce  of  Colchester  because he came to bear Mr  Pen+ington  of  London  Company and to be acquaint+ed with Mr  Isaac Penington  whom he ha  never seen before And as for those others o  us who were of this Country he would dis+charge them for the present at least because they being his Neighbours he could send for them when he would  But as for you  said he to  George Whitehead  and me  I can see no Business you had there and therefore I intend to hold you to it either to Give Bayl or Go to Jayl  We told him we could not give Bayl  Then  said he  You must go to Jayl  and thereupon he began to write our  Mittimus  which puzzled him again For he had discharged so many that he was at a Loss what to lay as the Ground of our Commitment whose Case differed nothing in Reality from theirs whom he had discharged  At length having made divers Draughts which still  G W  shewed him the Defects of he seemed to be weary of us and rising up said unto us  I consider that it is grown late in the Day so that the Officer cannot carry you to  Alesbury  to Night and I suppose you will be willing to go back with Mr  Penington  therefore if you will promise to be forthcoming at his House  to Morrow Morning I will dismiss you for the present and you shall hear from me again to morrow  We told him we did intend if he did not otherwise dispose of us to spend that Night with our Friend  Isaac Penington  and would if the LORD gave us leave be there in the Morning ready to Answer his Requirings Whereupon he dismist us all willing as we thought to be rid of us for he seemed not to be of an ill Temper nor desirous to put us to Trouble if he could help it  Back then we went to  Isaac Penington  's But when we were come thither O the Work we had with poor  John Ovy  He was so dejected in Mind so Covered with Shame and Confusion of Face for his Cowardliness that we had enough to do to pacifie him towards himself  The Place he had found out to Shelter himself in was so commodiously contrived that undiscovered he could discern when the Soldiers went off with us and understand when the Bussle was over and the Coast clear Whereupon he adventured to peep out of his Hole and in a while drew near by degrees to the House again and finding all things quiet and still he adventured to step within the Doors and found the Friends who were left behind peaceably fettled in the Meeting again  The Sight of this smote him and made him sit down among them And after the Meeting was ended and the  Friends  departed to their several Homes addressing himself to  Mary Penington  as the Mistress of the House he could not enough magnifie the Bravery and Courage of the Friends nor sufficiently debase himself He told her how long he had been a Professor what Pains he had taken what Hazards he had run in his Youthful Days to get to Meetings how when the Ways were forelaid and Passages stop't he Swam through Rivers to reach a Meeting  And now  sai  he  that I am grown Old in the Profession of Religion and have long been an Instructor and Encourager of others that I should thus shamefully fall short my self is matter of Shame and Sorrow to me  Thus he bewailed himself to her And when we came back he renewed his Complaints of himself to us with high Aggravations of his own Cowardice Which gave Occasion to some of the Friends tenderly to represent to him the Difference between  Profession  and  Possession Form  and  Power  He was glad  he said  on our Behalfs that we came off so well and escaped Imprisonment  But when he understood that  G Whitehead  and I were liable to an AfterReckoning next Morning he was troubled and wish't the Morning was come and gone that we might be gone with it  We spent the Evening in grave Conversation and in Religious Discourses attributing the Deliverance me hitherto had to the LORD And the next Morning when we were up and had Eaten we tarried some time to see what  he Justice would do further with us and to  ischarge our Engagement to him the rest of  he Friends who were before fully discharg  d tarrying also with us to see the Event  And when we had staid so long that on all  ands it was concluded we might safely go  W  and I left a few Words in Writing to  e sent to the Justice if he sent after us im  orting that we had tarried till such an Hour  nd not hearing from him did now hold our  lves free to depart yet so as that if he  ould have Occasion to send for us again upon  otice thereof we would Return  This done we took our leave of the Family  d one of another they who were for  Lon  taking Horse and I and my Companion  ting forth on Foot for  Oxfordshire  went to  ccomb  where we made a short Stay to  t and refresh our selves and from thence  ched our Respective Homes that Night  After I had spent some time at Home  ere as I had no Restraint so my Sisters be  g gone I had now no Society I walked up  Chalfont  again and spent a few Days with  Friends there  As soon as I came in I was told that my  ther had been there that Day to see  J P  d his Wife but they being abroad at a  eeting he returned to his Inn in the Town  ere he intended to Lodge that Night After  pper  M P  told me she had a Mind to go  d see him at his Inn the Woman of the  use being a Friend of ours and I went  with her He seem'd somewhat surprized to see me there because he thought I had been at home at his House but he took no notice of my Hat at least shewed no Offence at it  for as I afterwards understood he had no  an Intention to sell his Estate and thought h  should need my Concurrence therein whic  made him now hold it necessary to admit m  again into some Degree of Favour After w  had tarried some little time with him  rising up to be gone he waited on her hom  and having spent about an Hour with us  the Family I waited on him back to his  On the way he invited me to Come up  London  to see my Sisters the younger  whom was then newly Married and direc  me where to find 'em and also gave  Money to defray my Charges According  I went yet staid not long there but retu  +ed to my Friend  J P  's where I made a lit  Stay and from thence went back to  Crowell  When I was ready to set forth my Frie  Isaac Penington  was so kind to send a Serva  with a Brace of Geldings to Carry me as  as I thought fit to ride and to bring the Ho  back I intending to go no farther t  Day than to  Wiccomb  rode no farther than  Beconsfield  TownsEnd having then but F  Miles to walk But here a new Exercise  +fel me the manner of which was thus  Before I had walked to the middle of  Town I was stop't and taken up by  Watch I asked the Watchman What A  +thority  he had to stop me travelling peaceably on the HighWay He told me he would shew me his Authority and in order thereunto had me into an House hardby where dwelt a  Scrivener  whose Name was  Pepys  To him he gave the Order which he had received from the Constables which directed him to take up all Rogues Vagabonds and sturdy Beggars I asked him For which of these he stopped me but he could not Answer me  I thereupon informed him what a  Rogue  in Law is  viz One who for some notorious Offence has burnt on the Shoulder  and I told them they might search me if they pleased and see if I was so branded A  Vagabond  I told them was  One that had no Dwelling House nor certain Place of Abode  but I had and was going to  and I told them where it was And for a  Beggar  I bid them bring any one that could  y I had  begged  or  asked Relief  This stop't the Fellow's Mouth yet he would not let me go but being both weak  eaded and strongwilled he left me there  ith the  Scrivener  and went out to seek the  onstable and having found him brought  im thither He was a young Man by  Trade  Tanner  somewhat better Mannered than  is Wardsman but not of much better Judg  ent  He took me with him to his House And  aving settled me there went out to take Ad  ice as I supposed what to do with me  aving no Body in the House to Guard me  but his Wife who had a young Child in her Arms  She enquired of me upon what Account I was taken up and seeming to have some Pity for me endeavoured to perswade me not to stay but to go my way offering to shew me a back way from their House which would bring me into the Road again beyond the Town so that none of the Town should se  me or know what was become of me But  told her I could not do so  Then having sate a while in a muze she ask+ed me  If there was not a place of Scripture wh  said  Peter was at a Tanner's House I to  her there was such a Scripture and direct  her where to find it  After some time she laid her Child to sle  in the Cradle and step't out on a suddai  but came not in again in a pretty while  I was uneasie that I was left alone in t  House searing lest if any thing should be m  +sing I might be suspected to have taken  yet I durst not go out to stand in the Stree  lest it should be thought I intended to slip  +way  But besides that I soon found Work to i  +ploy my self in for the Child quickly waki  fell to Crying and I was fain to Rock  Cradle in my own Defence that I might  be annoyed with a Noise to me not more  +pleasant than unusual At length the Wom  came in again and finding me Nursing  Child gave me many Thanks and seemed well pleased with my Company  When Night came on the Constable him  lf came in again and told me  Some of the  hief of the Town were met together to Consider  hat was fit to do with me and that I must go with  m to them  I went and he brought me to a  ttle nasty Hut which they called a  Town  ouse  adjoining to their MarketHouse in  hich dwelt a poor old Woman whom they  lled  Mother Grime  where also the Watch used  turns to come in and warm themselves in  e Night  When I came in among them they looked  ome of them somewhat sourly on me and  k'd me some impertinent Questions to which  gave them suitable Answers  Then they consulted one with another how  ey should dispose of me that Night till they  uld have me before some  Justice of Peace  to  Examined Some proposed  That I should be  d to some Inn or other publick House and a  ard set on me there  He that started this was  obably an Innkeeper and consulted his own  terest Others objected against this  That it  uld bring a Charge on the Town  To avoid  ich they were for having the Watch take  arge of me and keep me walking about  e Streets with them till Morning Most  ices seemed to go this way till a Third  shed them to consider  Whether they could an  er the doing of that and the Law would bear  m out in it  And this put them to a stand  I heard all their Debates but let them alone and kept my Mind to the LORD  While they thus bandied the Matter to and fro one of the Company asked the rest  If any of them knew who this young Man was and whither he was going  Whereupon the Constable to whom I had given both my Name and the Name of the Town where I dwelt told them my Name was  Ellwood  and that I lived at a Town called  Crowell  in  Oxfordshire  Old Mother  Grime  sitting by and hearin  this clap'd her Hand on her Knee and cry'  out  I know Mr  Ellwood  of  Crowell  very we  For when I was a Maid I lived with his Gran  +ther there when he was a Young Man  A  thereupon she gave them such an Account of  Father as made them look more regardful  on me and so Mother  Grime's  Testimo  turned the Scale and took me off fr  walking the Rounds with the Watch t  Night  The Constable hereupon bid them take  further Care I should lie at his House t  Night and accordingly took me home wi  him where I had as good Accommodation  the House did afford Before I went to Be  he told me  That there was to be a Visitation  Spiritual Court  as he called it  holden next D  at  Amersham  about four Miles from  Beconsfie  and that  I was to be carried thither  This was a new Thing to me and it broug  a fresh Exercise upon my Mind But be  given up in the Will of God to suffer w  e should permit to be laid on me I endea  ured to keep my Mind quiet and still  In the Morning as soon as I was up my Spi  was Exercised towards the Lord in strong  ies to Him that He would stand by me  d preserve me and not suffer me to be taken  the Snare of the Wicked While I was thus  ying to the LORD the other Constable  e and I was called down  This was a budge Fellow and talked high  was a  Shoomaker  by Trade and his Name  s  Clark  He threat'ned me with the  Spiri  l  Court But when he saw I did not re  rd it he stop't and left the Matter to his  rtner who pretended more Kindness for  e and therefore went about to perswade  rk  to let me go out at the Back Door so  away  The Plot I suppose was so laid that  Clark  uld seem averse but at length yeild which  did but would have me take it for a Fa  r But I was so far from taking it so that  would not take it at all but told them plain  That as I came in at the ForeDoor so I  uld go out at the Fore Door When there  e they saw they could not bow me to their  ll they brought me out at the Fore Door  o the Street and wished me a good Journey  t before I went calling sor the Woman of  e House I paid her for my Supper and Lodg  g for I had now getten a little Money in my  cket again  After this I got home as I thought very well but I had not been long at home before an Ilness seized on me which proved to be the  SmallPox  Of which so soon as  Friends  had Notice I had a Nurse sent me and in a while  Isaac Penington  and his Wife's Daughter  G  lielma Maria Springett  to whom I had been PlayFellow in our Infancy came to visit me bringing with them our dear Friend  Edward Burrough  by whose Ministry I was called  the Knowledge of the Truth  It pleased the Lord to deal favourably wi  me in this Ilness both Inwardly and Outwa  +ly For his Supporting Presence was with m  which kept my Spirit near unto him a  though the Distemper was strong upon m  yet I was preserved through it and my Cou+tenance was not much altered by it But aft  I was got up again and while I kept  Chamber wanting some Employment  Entertainment sake to spend the Time wit  and there being at hand a pretty good Libra  of Books amongst which were the Works  Augustine  and others of those Ancient Write  who were by many called the  Fathers  I be+took my self to Reading And these Books be+ing Printed in the old BlackLetter with Ab+breviations of the Words difficult to be re  I spent too much time therein and thereb  much impaired my Sight which was n  strong before and was now weaker than usu  by reason of the Ilness I had so newly ha  which proved an Injury to me afterwards for which reason I here mention it  After I was well enough to go abroad with  espect to my own Health and the Safety of  thers I went up in the beginning of the  welfth Month  to my Friend  Isaac Pen  gton  's at  Chalfont  and abode there sometime  r the Airing my self more fully that I might  e more fit for Conversation  I mentioned before that when I was a Boy  had made some good Progress in Learning  d lost it all again before I came to be a Man  or was I rightly sensible of my Loss there  until I came amongst the  Quakers  But  en I both saw my Loss and lamented it  d applied my self with utmost Diligence at  l leisure Times to recover it so false I found  at Charge to be which in those Times was  st as a Reproach upon the  Quakers  That  ey despised and decried all Humane Learning  ecause they denied it to be essentially necessary  a  GospelMinistry  which was one of the Con  oversies of those Times  But though I toiled hard and spared no  ains to regain what once I had been Master  f yet I found it a Matter of so great Diffi  ulty that I was ready to say as the Noble  Eu  uch  to  Philip  in another Case  How can I un  ess I had some Man to guide me  This I had formerly complained of to my  special Friend  Isaac Penington  but now more  arnestly which put him upon Considering  and Contriving a Means for my Assistance  He had an intimate Acquaintance with Dr  Paget  a Physician of Note in  London  and he with  John Milton  a Gentleman of great Note for Learning throughout the Learned World for the accurate Pieces he had Written on va+rious Subjects and Occasions  This Person having filled a publick Statio  in the former Times lived now a private an  retired Life in  London  and having wholly l  his Sight kept always a Man to read to hi  which usually was the Son of some Gentlem  of his Acquaintance whom in Kindness  took to improve in his Learning  Thus by the Mediation of my Friend  Isa Penington  with Dr  Paget  and of Dr  Pag  with  John Milton  was I admitted to come  him not as a Servant to him which at t  time he needed not nor to be in the Ho  with him but only to have the Liberty  Coming to his House at certain Hours wh  I would and to read to him what Books  should appoint me which was all the Favo  I desired  But this being a Matter which would  +quire some time to bring it about I in  mean while returned to my Father's House  Oxfordshire  I had before received Direction by Lett  from my Eldest Sister written by my Fathe  Command to put off what Cattle he had  about his House and to Discharge his Serva  ich I had done at the time called  Michaelmas  fore So that all that Winter when I was  Home I lived like an  Hermit  all alone  ing a pretty large House and no Body in  but my self a Nights especially but an el  rly Woman whose Father had been an old  rvant to the Family came every Morning  d made my Bed and did what else I had  asion for her to do till I fell Ill of the  all Pox  and then I had her with me and  Nurse But now understanding by Letter  m my Sister that my Father did not intend  return to settle there I made off those Pro  ions which were in the House that they  ght not be spoiled when I was gone and  cause they were what I should have spent if  ad tarried there I took the Money made of  em to my self for my support at  London  if  e Project succeeded for my Going thither  This done I committed the Care of the  use to a Tenant of my Father's who lived  the Town and taking my leave of  Crowell  nt up to my sure Friend  Isaac Penington  a  in Where understanding that the Media  n used for my Admittance to  John Milton  d succeeded so well that I might come when  would I hastned to  London  and in the first  ace went to wait upon him  He received me courteously as well for the  ke of Dr  Paget  who introduced me as of  aac Penington  who recommended me to  oth whom he bore a good Respect And  ving enquired divers things of me with respect  to my former Progression in Learning h  dismist me to provide my self of such Accomo+dations as might be most suitable to my futur  Studies  I went therefore and took my self a Lodging  as near to his House which was then in  Jewe  Street  as conveniently as I could and fro  thenceforward went every Day in the After+noon except on the first Days of the Wee  and sitting by him in his DiningRoom re  to him in such Books in the  Latin Tongue  as  pleased to hear me read  At my first sitting to read to him observi  that I used the  English Pronounciation  he t  me  If I would have the Benefit of the Lat  Tongue not only to read and understand  Latin  A  +thors but to Converse with Foreigners either  +broad or at home I must learn the Foreign Pr  +nounciation  To this I consenting he instru  +ed me how to sound the Vowels so differe  from the common Pronounciation used by t  English  who speak  Anglice  their  Latin  th  with some few other Variations in soundi  some Consonants in particular Cases as  C  be+fore  E  or  I  like  Ch Sc  before  I  like  Sh  c the  Latin  thus spoken seemed as different from that which was delivered as the  English  generally speak it as if it were another Language  I had before during my retired Life at my Father's by unwearied Diligence and Industry so far recovered the Rules of  Grammar  in which I had once been very ready that I could both read a  Latin  Author and after a sort hammer  out his Meaning But this Change of  nounciation proved a New Difficulty to  It was now harder to me to read than  was before to understand when read But  Labor omnia vincit  Improbus  Incessant Pains  The End obtains  And so did I Which made my Reading the  re acceptable to my Master He on the o  r hand perceiving with what earnest De  I pursued Learning gave me not only all  Encouragement but all the Help he could  having a curious Ear he understood by  Tone when I understood what I read and  en I did not and accordingly would stop  Examine me and open the most difficult  sages to me  Thus went I on for about Six Weeks time  ding to him in the Afternoons and Exerci  g my self with my own Books in my Cham  in the Forenoons I was sensible of an  provement  But alas I had fixed my Studies in a wrong  ce  London  and I could never agree for  alth my Lungs as I suppose were too  der to bear the Sulphurous Air of that City  that I soon began to droop and in less than  o Months time I was fain to leave both my  dies and the City and return into the Country  to preserve Life and much ado I had  get thither  I chose to go down to  Wiccomb  and to  Jo  Rance  's House there both as he was a Phy  +cian and his Wife an honest hearty discre  and grave Matron whom I had a very goo  Esteem of and who I knew had a good R  +gard for me  There I lay ill a considerable time and  that degree of Weakness that scarce any w  saw me expected my Life But the Lord w  both gracious to me in my Ilness and w  pleased to raise me up again that I might ser  Him in my Generation  As soon as I had recovered so much Streng  as to be fit to Travel I obtained of my  +ther who was then at his House in  Crowel  dispose of some things he had there and w  in my Ilness had come to see me so much M  +ney as would clear all Charges in the Hou  for both Physick Food and Attendance a  having fully discharged all I took leave of m  Friends in that Family and in the Town a  returned to my Studies at  London  I was very kindly received by my Maste  who had conceived so good an Opinion of m  that my Conversation I found was acceptab  to him and he seem'd heartily glad of my Re+covery and Return and into our old Metho  of Study we fell again I Reading to him an  he Explaining to me as Occasion required  But as if Learning had been a forbidde  Fruit to me scarce was I well settled in my  Work before I met with another Diversion which turned me quite out of my Work  For a suddain Storm arising from I know  ot what Surmise of a Plot and thereby Dan  er to the Government and the Meetings of  issenters such I mean as could be found which  erhaps were not many besides the  Quakers  were broken up throughout the City and the  risons mostly filled with our Friends  I was that Morning which was the th  ay of the th Month at the Meeting  the  BullandMouth  by  Aldersgate  when on  suddain a Party of Soldiers of the Trained  ands of the City rushed in with Noise and  lamour being led by one who was called  Major Rosewell  an  Apothecary  if I misremem  er not and at that time under the ill Name  f a  Papist  As soon as he was come within the Room  aving a File or two of Musketteers at his  eels he commanded his Men to present their Muskets at us which they did with Intent I suppose to strike a Terror into the People Then he made a Proclamation that all who were not  Quakers  might depart if they would  It so happened that a Young Man an Ap  rentice in  London  whose Name was  Dove  the Son of Dr  Dove  of  Chinner  near  Crowell  in  Oxfordshire  came that Day in Curiosity to see the Meeting and Coming early and finding me there whom he knew came and sate down by me  As soon as he heard the Noise of Soldiers he was much startled and asked me softly  I would not shift for my Self and try to get out  I told him No I was in my place and was willing to suffer if it was my Lot When he heard the Notice given that  they who were not  Quakers  might depart  he solicited me again to be gone I told him I could not do so for that would be to renounce my Profession which I would by no means do But as for him who was not one of us he might do as he pleased Whereupon wishing me well he turned away and with Cap in Hand went out And truly I was glad he was gone for his Master was a rigid  Presbyterian  who in all likelihood would have led him a wretched Life had he been taken and Imprisoned among the  Quakers  The Soldiers came so early that the Meeting was not fully gathered when they came and when the mixt Company were gone out we were so few and sate so thin in that large Room that they might take a clear view of us all and single us out as they pleased  He that Commanded the Party gave us first a general Charge to come out of the Room But we who came thither at God's Requirings to Worship Him like that good Man of Old who said  We ought to obey God rather than Men  Acts stirred not but kept out Places Whereupon he sent some of his Soldiers among us with Command to Drag or Drive us out which they did roughly enough  When we came out into the Street we were  ceived there by other Soldiers who with  eir Pikes holden lengthways from one ano  er encompassed us round as Sheep in a  und and there we stood a pretty time  ile they were picking up more to add to  r Number  In this Work none seemed so eager and ac  e as their Leader Major  Rosewell  Which  bserving stept boldly to him as he was  sing by me and asked him If he intended  Massacre  for of that in those times there  s a great Apprehension and Talk The sud  nness of the Question from such a young  n especially somewhat startled him but  ollecting himself he answered  No but I  end to have you all hanged by the wholsome Laws  the Land  When he had gotten as many as he could or  ught fit which were in Number  Thirty    whereof Two were catch'd up in the  eet who had not been at the Meeting he  ered the Pikes to be opened before us and  ing the Word to March went himself at the  ad of us the Soldiers with their Pikes ma  g a Lane to keep us from scattering  He led us up  Martins  and so turned down  Newgate  where I expected he would have  ged us But to my Disappointment he  nt on through  Newgate  and turning through  OldBaily  brought us into  FleetStreet  I  s then wholly at a Loss to conjecture whi  r he would lead us unless it were to  Whitehall  for I knew nothing then of  OldBridwell  but on a suddain he gave a short Turn a  brought us before the Gate of that Priso  where knocking the Wicket was forthwi  opened and the Master with his Porter r  +dy to receive us  One of those two who were picked up  the Street being near me and telling me  Case I stept to the Major and told him Th  this Man was not at the Meeting but was  +ken up in the Street and shew'd him  hard and unjust a thing it would be to  him into Prison  I had not pleased him before in the Questi  I had put to him about a Massacre and t  I suppose made this Solicitation less accepta  to him from me than it might have been fr  some other For looking sternly on me  said  Who are you that take so much upon  Seeing you are so busie you shall be the first  that shall go into Bridewell  and taking me  the Shoulders he thrust me in  As soon as I was in the  Porter  pointing w  his Finger directed me to a fair Pair of Sta  on the further side of a large Court and  me  Go up those Stairs and go on till I could go  farther  Accordingly I went up the Stairs the  Flight whereof brought me to a fair Chap  on my left hand which I could look i  through the IronGrates but could not h  gone into if I would  I knew that was not a Place for me Where  e following my Direction and the  winding the Stairs I went up a Story higher which  ought me into a Room which I soon perceiv  to be a  CourtRoom  or Place of  Judicature  ter I had stood a while there and taken a  ew of it observing a Door on the further  e I went to it and opened it with inten  to go in but I quickly drew back being  ost affrighted at the Dismalness of the Place  r besides that the Walls quite round were laid  over from Top to Bottom in Black there  d in the middle of it a great WhippingPost  ich was all the furniture it had  In one of these two Rooms Judgment was  en and in the other it was executed on  se ill People who for their Lewdness were  t to this Prison and there sentenced to be  hip'd Which was so contrived that the urt might not only hear but see if they  ased their Sentence Executed  A Sight so unexpected and withal so unpleas  gave me no Encouragement either to rest  ndeed to enter at all there till looking ear  tly I spy'd on the opposite side a Door  ich giving me Hopes of a further Progress I  entured to step hastily to it and opened it  This let me into one of the fairest Rooms  t so far as I remember I was ever in and  wonder for though it was now put to this  an Use it had for many Ages past been  Royal Seat or Palace of the Kings of  Eng  d  until Cardinal  Woolsey  Built  Whitehall  and offered it as a  PeaceOffering  to King  HE  +RY  the  Eighth  who until that time had ke  his Court in this House and had this as t  People in the House reported for his Dini  Room by which Name it then went  This Room in length for I lived long  +nough in it to have time to measure it  Threescore Foot  and had Breadth proporti  +able to it In it on the FrontSide were v  large BayWindows in which stood a la  Table It had other very large Tables  with Benches round and at that time the F  was covered with Rushes against some So  Festival which I heard it was bespoken  Here was my  Nil ultra  and here I fou  might set up my Pillar for although there  a Door out of it to a BackPair of Stairs w  led to it yet that was kept locked So  finding I had now followed my Keeper's  +rection to the utmost Point beyond whi  could not go I sate down and considered  rhetorical Saying  That the Way to Heave  by the Gate of Hell  the Black Room thr  which I passed into this bearing some Re  +blance to the latter as  This  comparatively  by way of Allusion might in some sor  thought to bear to the former  But I was quickly put out of these Thou  by the Flocking in of the other  Friends  FellowPrisoners amongst whom yet  all were come together there was but  whom I knew so much as by Face and  him I had no Acquaintance For I having  a little while in the City and in that time  t close to my Studies I was by that Means  wn to very few  oon after we were all gotten together came  the Master of the House after us and de  ded our Names which we might reason  have refused to give till we had been  lly convened before some Civil Magistrate  had Power to Examine us and demand  Names But we who were neither  Guil  nor  Wilful  simply gave him our Names  ch he took down in Writing  was as I hinted before a general Storm  ch fell that Day but it lighted most and  t heavy upon our Meetings so that most  ur MenFriends were made Prisoners and  Prisons generally filled And great Work  the Women to run about from Prison to  on to find their Husbands their Fathers  r Brothers or their Servants for accord  y as they had disposed themselves to several  etings so were they dispersed to several  ons And no less Care and Pains had they  n they had found them to furnish them  Provisions and other necessary Accom  lations  But an excellent Order even in those early  ys was practised among the  Friends  of that  y by which there were certain  Friends  of  er Sex appointed to have the Oversight of  Prisons in every Quarter and to take Care  ll Friends the  Poor  especially that should  Committed thither  This Prison of  Bridewell  was under the C  of two honest grave discreet and mothe  Women whose Names were  Anne Mer  afterwards  Vivers  and  Anne Travers  b  Widows  They so soon as they understood that t  were  Friends  brought into that Prison  +vided some hot Victuals Meat and Broth  the Weather was cold and ordering their  +vants to bring it them with Bread Cheese  Beer came themselves also with it and ha  placed it on a Table gave notice to us  T  was provided for all those that had not othe  provide for them or were not able to prov  themselves  And there wanted not among  competent Number of such Guests  As for my part though I had lived as  +gally as possibly I could that I might draw  the Thread of my little Stock to the ut  length yet had I by this time reduced  Ten Pence  which was all the Money I h  bout me or any where else at my Comman  This was but a small Estate to enter  an Imprisonment with yet was I not  discouraged at it nor had I a murm  Thought I had known what it was  +rately to  Abound  and if I should now  to suffer  Want  I knew I ought to be co  and through the Grace of GOD I was s  had lived by Providence before when  long time I had no Money at all and  always found the LORD a good Provide  made no doubt therefore that He who se  vens to feed  Elijah  and who cloaths the Lil  would find some means to sustain me  th needful Food and Raiment and I had  rn'd by Experience the Truth of that Say  g  Natura paucis contenta  i e Nature is cont with few things or a little  Although the Sight and Smell of  hot Food  s sufficiently enticing to my  empty Stomach  r I had Eaten little that Morning and was  gry yet considering the Terms of the In  ation I questioned whether I was included  t and after some Reasonings at length con  ed That while I had  Ten Pence  in my  cket I should be but an injurious Intruder to  t Mess which was provided for such as  haps had not  Two Pence  in theirs  Being come to this Resolution I withdrew  far from the Table as I could and sate  wn in a quiet Retirement of Mind till the  past was over which was not long for  re were Hands enough at it to make light  rk of it  When Evening came the Porter came up  BackStairs and opening the Door told us  we desired to have any thing that was to be had  the House he would bring it us for there was  the House a  Chandler  'sShop at which Beer  ead Butter Cheese Eggs and Bacon might be  d for Money  Upon which many went to  and spake for what of these things they  d a Mind to giving him Money to pay for  em  Among the rest went I and intending  spin out my  Ten Pence  as far as I could de+sired him to bring me a Penny Loaf only  When he returned we all resorted to him  receive our several Provisions which he de  +vered and when he came to me he told m  He could not get a Penny Loaf but he had broug  me two HalfPenny Loaves  This suited me better wherefore returni  to my Place again I sate down and Eat  one of my Loaves reserving the other for  next Day  This was to me both Dinner and Suppe  And so well satisfied I was with it that I  willingly then have gone to Bed if I had h  one to go to but that was not to be expect  there nor had any one any Bedding broug  in that Night  Some of the Company had been so conside+rate as to send for a Pound of Candles th  we might not sit all Night in the dark and h  ving lighted divers of them and placed the  in several Parts of that large Room we kep  walking to keep us warm  After I had warmed my self pretty throug  +ly and the Evening was pretty sar spent  bethought my self of a Lodging and castin  mine Eye on the Table which stood in t  BayWindow the Frame whereof look't  thought somewhat like a Beadstead When  +fore willing to make sure of that I gathered  a good Armful of the Rushes wherewith t  Floor was covered and spreading them und  at Table crep't in upon them in my Cloaths  d keeping on my Hat laid my Head upon  e End of the Tables Frame instead of a  lster  My Example was followed by the rest who  thering up Rushes as I had done made  emselves Beds in other Parts of the Room  d so to rest we went  I having a quiet easie Mind was soon a  ep and slept till about the middle of the  ght And then waking finding my Legs  d Feet very cold I crep't out of my Cabin  d began to walk about apace  This waked and raised all the rest who find  g themselves cold as well as I got up and  lked about with me till we had pretty well  rmed our selves and then we all lay down  ain and rested till Morning  Next Day all they who had Families or be  g'd to Families had Bedding brought in of  e Sort or other which they disposed at the  ds and Sides of the Room leaving the Mid  void to walk in  But I who had no Body to look after me  t to my RushyPallet under the Table for  r Nights together in which time I did not  t off my Cloths yet through the merciful  odness of GOD unto me I rested and slept  ll and enjoyed Health without taking  ld  In this time divers of our Company through  e Solicitations of some of their Relations or  quaintance to Sir  Richard Brown  who was  at that time a great Master of  Misrule  in the City and over  Bridewell  more especially were released And among these one  William Mucklow  who lay in an Hammack He having observed that I only was unprovided of Lodging came very courteously to me and kindly offered me the Use of his Hammack while I should continue a Prisoner  This was a Providential Accommodation  me which I received thankfully both fro  the LORD and from him and from thenc  forth I thought I lay as well as ever I had do  in my Life  Amongst those that remained there were se+veral Young Men who cast themselves into  Club and laying down every one an equ  Proportion of Money put it into the Hand  our Friend  Anne Travers  desiring her to lay  out for them in Provisions and send them in  +very Day a Mess of hot Meat and they kin  +ly invited me to come into their Club wi  them These saw my Person and judged  me by that but they saw not my Purse n  understood the Lightness of my Pocket B  I who alone understood my own Conditio  knew I must sit down with lower Commo  Wherefore not giving them the true Reaso  I as fairly as I could excused my self from e  +tring at present into their Mess and we  on as before to eat by my self and that ve  sparingly as my Stock would bear A  before my  Ten Pence  was quite spent Prov  +dence  on whom I relied sent me in a fresh Supply  For  William Penington  a Brother of  Isaac Pen  ngton  's a Friend and Merchant in  London  at whose House before I came to live in the Ci  y I was wont to Lodge having been at his Brothers that Day upon a Visit escaped this Storm and so was at Liberty And under  tanding when he came back what had been  one bethought himself of me and upon En  uiry hearing where I was came in Love to  ee me  He in Discourse amongst other things asked me  How it was with me as to Money  and  how well I was furnished  I told him I could not boast of much and yet I could not say I had none Though what I then had was indeed next to none Whereupon he put  Twenty Shillings  into my Hand and desired me to accept of that for the present I saw a Divine Hand in thus opening his Heart and Hand in this manner to me And though I would willingly have been excused from taking so much and would have returned one half of it yet he pressing it all upon me I received it with a thankful Acknowledgment as a Token of Love from the Lord and from him  On the  Seventh Day  he went down again as he usually did to his Brother's House at  Chalfont  and in Discourse gave them an Account of my Imprisonment Whereupon at his Return on the  Second Day  of the Week following my affectionate Friend  Mary Penington  sent me  by him  Fourty Shillings  which he soon after brought me out of which I would have repaid him the  Twenty Shillings  he had so kindly furnished me with but he would not admit it telling me  I might have Occasion for that and more before I got my Liberty  Not many Days after this I received  Twenty Shillings  from my Father who being then at his House in  Oxfordshire  and by Letter from my Sister understanding that I was a Prisoner in  Bridewell  sent this Money to me for my Support there and withal a Letter to my Sister for her to deliver to one called Mr  W  who lived near  Bridewell  and was a Servant to Sir  Richard Brown  in some Wharf of his requesting him to interceed with his Master who was one of the Governors of  Bridewell  for my Deliverance But that Letter coming to my Hands I supprest it and have it y  by me  Now was my Pocket from the lowest Ebb  risen to a full Tide I was at the Brink o  Want next Door to nothing yet my Confi+dence did not fail nor my Faith stagger an  now on a suddain I had plentiful Supplies show+er upon shower so that I abounded yet wa  not lifted up but in Humility could say  Thi  is the  LORD's  Doing  And without defraud+ing any of the Instruments of the Acknowledgments due unto them mine Eye looked o+ver and beyond them to the LORD who  saw was the Author thereof and prime Agen  therein and with a thankful Heart I returned  Thanksgivings and Praises to him And this  reat Goodness of the Lord to me I thus Re  ord to the End that all into whose Hands  is may come may be Encouraged to Trust  the Lord whose Mercy is over all his Works  d who is indeed a God near at hand to help  the needful time  Now I durst venture my self into the Club  which I had been invited and accordingly  aving by this Time gained an Acquaintance with them took an Opportunity to cast my self  mong them and thenceforward so long as we continued Prisoners there together I was  e of their Mess  And now the chief thing I wanted was  Im  loyment  which scarce any wanted but my  elf for the rest of my Company were gene  ally Tradesmen of such Trades as could set  hemselves on work Of these divers were  Taylors  some Masters some Journeymen and with these I most inclined to settle But be  ause I was too much a Novice in their Art to  e trusted with their Work lest I should spoil  he Garment I got Work from an  Hosier  in  Cheapside  which was to make  NightWaist coats  of  Red  and  Yellow Flannel  for Women and Children And with this I entred my self among  he  Taylors  sitting Crossleg'd as they did and  o spent those LeisureHours with Innocency and Pleasure which want of Business would have made tedious And indeed that was in a manner the only Advantage I had by it for my Master though a very wealthy Man and  one who professed not only Friendship but particular Kindness to me dealt I thought but hardly with me For though he knew not what I had to subsist by he never offered me a Penny for my Work till I had done Working for him and went after I was released to give him a Visit and then he would not Reckon with me neither  because  as he smilingly said  he would not let me so far into his Trade as to acquaint me with the Prises of the Work but would be sure to give me enough  And thereupon he gave me one Crown Piece and no more tho' I had wrought long for him and made him many Dozens of  Wastcoats  and bought the Thread my self which I thought was very poor Pay But as Providence had ordered it I wanted the Work more than the Wages and therefore took what he gave me without Complaining  About this time while we were Prisoners in our fair Chamber a Friend was brought and put in among us who had been sent thither by  Richard Brown  to beat Hemp whose Case was thus  He was a very poor Man who lived by Mending  Shoos  and on a  Seventh Day  Night late a CarMan or some other such labouring Man brought him a pair of Shoos to mend desiring him to mend them that Night that he might have them in the Morning for he had no other to wear The poor Man sate up at work upon them till after Midnight and then finding he could not finish them he went  o bed intending to do the rest in the Morning  Accordingly he got up betimes and though  e wrought as privately as he could in his Chamber that he might avoid giving Offence  o any yet could he not do it so privately but  hat an illnatur'd Neighbour perceived it who went and informed against him for working on the  Sunday  Whereupon he was had before  Richard Brown  who Committed him to  Bride  ell  for a certain time to be kept to hard Labour in Beating Hemp which is Labour hard enough  It so fell out that at the same time were Committed thither for what Cause I do not now remember two lusty Young Men who were called  Baptists  to be kept also at the same Labour  The Friend was a poor little Man of a low Condition and mean Appearance Whereas  hese two Baptists were topping Blades that  ooked high and spake big They scorned to  eat Hemp and made a  Pish  at the WhippingPost but when they had once felt the Smart of it they soon cried  Peccavi  and submitting to the Punishment set their tender Hands to the Beetles  The Friend on the other hand acting upon a Principle as knowing he had done no Evil for which he should undergo that Punishment refused to work and for refusing was cruelly Whipt which he bore with wonderful Constancy and Resolution of Mind  The manner of Whipping there is To stri  the Party to the Skin from the Waste upwards  and having fastned him to the WhippingPost so that he can neither resist nor shun the Strokes to lash the naked Body with long but slender Twigs of Holly which will bend almost like Thongs and lap round the Body  and these having little Knots upon them tear the Skin and Flesh and give extream Pain  With these Rods they tormented the Friend most barbarously and the more for that hav+ing mastered the Two braving  Baptists  they disdained to be mastered by this poor  Quaker  Yet were they fain at last to yeild when they saw their utmost Severity could not make him yield And then not willing to be troubled longer with him they turned him up among us  When we had enquired of him how it was with him and he had given us a brief Account of both his Cause and Usage it came in my Mind that I had in my Box which I had sent for from my Lodging to keep some few Books and other Necessaries in a little Gally+pot with  Lucatellu  's  Balsam  in it  Wherefore causing a good Fire to be made and setting the Friend within a Blanket befor  the Fire we stripped him to the Waste as  he had been too be Whipt again and foun  his Skin so Cut and Torn with the knott  HollyRods both Back Side Arm and Breast  that it was a dismal Sight to look upon The  melting some of the Balsam I with a Feathe  anointed all the Sores and putting a softe  oth between his Skin and his Shirt help  him on with his Cloaths again This  essing gave him much Ease and I continu  it till he was well And because he was a  ry poor Man we took him into our Mess  triving that there should always be enough  him as well as for our selves Thus he  ed with us until the time he was commit  d for was Expired and then he was Re  sed  But we were still continued Prisoners by an  bitrary Power not being Committed by the  vil Authority nor having seen the Face of  y Civil Magistrate from the Day we were  ust in here by Soldiers which was the th  ay of the Eighth Month to the th of the  nth Month following  On that Day we were had to the  Sessions  at  e  Old Baily  But not being called there we  ere brought back to  Bridewell  and continued  ere to the th of the same Month and then  e were carried to the Sessions again  I expected I should have been called the first  cause my Name was first taken down but  proved otherwise so that I was one of the  t that was called which gave me the Ad  ntage of hearing the Pleas of the other  risoners and discovering the Temper of the  ourt  The Prisoners complained of the  Illegality  of  eir Imprisonment and desired to know  what  y had lain so long in Prison for  The Court  garded nothing of that and did not stick to  tell them so For said the  Recorder  to them  If you think you have been wrongfully Impris  you have your Remedy at Law and may take  if you think it worth your while The Court  sa  he  may send for any Man out of the Street a  tender him the Oath So we take no Notice  you came hither but finding you here we te  you the Oath of  Allegiance  which if you ref  to take we shall commit you and at length P  +munire you  Accordingly as every one Refu  it he was set aside and another called  By this I saw it was in vain for me to  upon False Imprisonment or ask the Cause  my Commitment though I had before  +nished my self with some Authorities and M  +ims of Law on that Subject to have plead  if room had been given and I had the B  out of which I took them in my Bosom  the Weather being cold I wore a Gown g  about the middle and had put the Book wi  in it But I now resolved to wave all th  and insist upon another Plea which just th  came into my Mind  As soon therefore as I was called I ste  nimbly to the Bar and stood up upon the St  +ping that I might the better both hear and  heard and laying my Hands upon the B  stood ready expecting what they would  to me  I suppose they took me for a confident you  Man for they looked very earnestly upon  and we faced each other without Words  a while At length the  Recorder  who was  +d  Sir  John Howel  asked me  If I would take  e Oath of  Allegiance  To which I answered I conceive this Court  ath not Power to tender that Oath to me in  e Condition wherein I stand  This so unexpected Plea seemed to startle  em so that they looked one upon another  d said somewhat low one to another  What  h he demur to the Jurisdiction of the Court  nd thereupon the  Recorder  asked me  Do you  demur to the Jurisdiction of the Court  Not  bsolutely answered I but Conditionally  th respect to my present Condition and the  ircumstances I am now under  Why what is your present Condition  said the  corder  A Prisoner replied I  And what is  t  said he  to your taking or not taking the  th  Enough said I as I conceive to exempt  e from the Tender thereof while I am un  r this Condition  Pray what is your Reason  that  said he This said I That if I  htly understand the Words of the Statute I  required to say  That I do take this Oath free  and without Constraint  which I cannot say  cause I am not a Free Man but in Bonds and  der Constraint Wherefore I conceive that  you would tender that Oath to me ye ought  t to set me free from my present Imprison  ent  But  said the Recorder  will you take the Oath  you be set free  Thou shalt see that said I  en I am set free Therefore set me free first  d then ask the Question  But  said he again  you know your own M  +sure and can tell now what you would do if you we  at Liberty  Yes replied I that I can but  don't hold my self obliged to tell it until I at at Liberty Therefore set me at Liberty a  ye shall soon hear it  Thus we fenced a good while till I was bo  weary of such Trifling and doubted also  some of the Standers by should suspect I wo  take it if I was set at Liberty Wherei  when the  Recorder  put it upon me again  him plainly No though I thought they ou  not to tender it me till I had been set at  berty yet if I was set at Liberty I could  take that nor any other Oath because  Lord and Master CHRIST JESUS had  +presly Commanded his Disciples  Not to S  at all  As his Command was enough to me so  Confession of mine was enough to them  T  him away  said they and away I was tak  and thrust into the BailDock to my oth  Friends who had been called before me A  as soon as the rest of our Company were call  and had refused to  Swear  we were all Co  +mitted to  Newgate  and thrust into the Co  +mon Side  When we came there we found that Side  the Prison very full of Friends who were P  +soners there before as indeed were at that ti  all the other Parts of that Prison and most of t  other Prisons about the Town and our Addi  +on caused a great Throng on that Side No  +withstanding  which we were kindly welcomed  our Friends whom we found there and  ertained by them as well as their Condition  ould admit until we could get in our own  commodations and provide for our selves  We had the Liberty of the Hall which is on  e first story over the Gate and which in the  y time is common to all the Prisoners on that  de Felons as well as others to walk in and  Beg out of and we had also the Liberty of  e other Rooms over that Hall to walk or  rk in a Days But in the Night we all  dged in one Room which was large and  nd having in the Middle of it a great Pillar  f Oaken Timber which bore up the Chap  that is over it  To this Pillar we fastned our Hammacks at  one End and to the opposite Wall on the o  er End quite round the Room and in three  grees or three Stories high one over the o  r so that they who lay in the Upper and  ddle Row of Hammacks were obliged to  to Bed first because they were to Climb up  the Higher by getting into the Lower And  er the Lower Rank of Hammacks by the  llsides were laid Beds upon the Floor in  ich the Sick and such weak Persons as could  t get into the Hammacks lay And indeed  ough the Room was large and pretty airy  t the Breath and Steam that came from so  ny Bodies of different Ages Conditions  d Constitutions pack't up so close together  s enough to cause Sickness amongst us and  I believe did so For there were many Sick and some very weak though we were not long there yet in that time one of our Fellow Prisoners who lay in one of those PalletBeds died  This caused some Bustle in the House For the Body of the Deceased being laid out and put into a Coffin was carried down and set in the Room called the  Lodge  that the  Coroner  might enquire into the Cause and Manner of his Death And the manner of their doing it is thus As soon as the  Coroner  is come the  Turnkeys  run out into the Street under the Gate and seize upon every Man that passes by till they have got enough to make up the  Coroner's Inquest  And so resolute these rude Fellows are that if any Man resist or dispute it with them they drag him in by main Force not regarding what Condition he is of Nay I have been told the will not stick to stop a Coach and pluck the Men out of it  It so happened that at this time they lighted on an Ancient Man a grave Citizen who was trudging through the Gate in great Haste and him they laid hold on telling him  He must come in and serve upon the Coroner's Inquest  He pleaded hard beg'd and besought them to let him go assuring them  He was going on very urgent Business and that the stopping him would be greatly to his Prejudice  But they were deaf to all Intreaties and hurried him in the poor Man Chaffing without Remedy  When they had got their Complement and were shut in together the rest of them said to  this Ancient Man  Come Father you are the oldest Man among us You shall be our Foreman  And when the  Coroner  had Sworn them on the Jury the Coffin was uncovered that they might ook upon the Body But the Old Man disturbed in his Mind at the Interruption they had given him was grown somewhat fretful upon it said to them  To what purpose do you shew us a dead Body here You would not have us think sure that this Man died in this Room How then shall we be able to judge how this Man came by his Death unless we see the Place wherein he died and wherein he hath been kept Prisoner before he died How know we but that the Incommodiousness of the Place wherein he was kept may have occasioned his Death Therefore shew us  said he  the place wherein this Man died  This much displeased the Keepers and they began to banter the Old Man thinking to have beaten him off it But he stood up titely to them  Come come  said he  Though you have made a Fool of me in bringing me in hither ye shall not find a Child of me now I am here Mistake not your selves I understand my Place and your Duty and I require you to Conduct me and my Brethren to the Place where this Man died Refuse it at your Peril  They now wished they had let the Old Man go about his Business rather than by troubling him have brought this Trouble on themselves But when they saw he persisted in his Resolution and was peremptory the  Coroner  told them  They must go shew him the Place  It was in the Evening when they began this Work and by this time it was grown Bedtime with us so that we had taken down our Hammacks which in the Day were hung up by the Walls and had made them ready to go into and were undressing our selves in Readiness to go into them When on a suddain we heard a great Noise of Tongues and of Tramplings of Feet coming up towards us And by and by One of the  Turnkeys  opening our Door said  Hold hold Don't undress your selves here's the Coroner's Inquest coming to see you  As soon as they were come to the Door for within the Door there was scarce room for them to come the Foreman who led them lifting up his Hand said  Lord bless me what a Sight is here I did not think there had been so much Cruelty in the Hearts of  Englishmen  to use  Englishmen  in this manner We need not now question  said he to the rest of the Jury  how this Man came by his Death We may rather wonder that they are not all dead for this Place is enough to breed an Infection among them Well  added he  If it please God to lengthen my Life till to Morrow I will find means to let the  KING  know how his Subjects are dealt with  Whether he did so or no I cannot tell but I am apt to think that he applied himself to the Mayor or the Sheriffs of  London  For the next Day one of the Sheriffs called Sir  William Turner  a  WollenDraper  in  Paul'sYard  came to the PressYard and having ordered the Porter of  Bridewell  to attend him there sent up a  Turnkey  amongst us to bid all the  Bridewell  Prisoners come down to him for they knew us not but we knew our own Company  Being come before him in the PressYard he looked kindly on us and spake courteously to us  Gentlemen  said he  I understand the Prison is very full and I am sorry for it I wish it were in my Power to release you and the rest of your Friends that are in it But since I cannot do that I am willing to do what I can for you And therefore I am come hither to enquire how it is and I would have all you who came from  Bridewell  return thither again which will be a better Accommodation to you and your Removal will give the more room to those that are left behind and here is the Porter of  Bridewell  your Old Keeper to attend you thither  We duly acknowledged the Favour of the Sheriff to us and our Friends above in this Removal of us which would give them more Room and us a better Air But before we parted from him I spake particularly to him on another Occasion which was this  When we came into  Newgate  we found a shabby Fellow there among the  Friends  who upon Inquiry we understood had thrust himself among our Friends when they were taken at a Meeting on purpose to be sent to Prison with them in hopes to be maintained by them They knew nothing of him till they found him shut in with them in the Prison and then took no Notice of him as not knowing how or why he came thither But he soon gave  them cause to take Notice of him for where+ever he saw any Victuals brought forth fo  them to Eat he would be sure to thrust in with Knife in hand and make himself his own Carver And so impudent was he that if he saw the Provision was short whoever wanted  he would be sure to take enough  Thus lived this lazy Drone upon the Labours of the Industrious Bees to his high Content and their no small Trouble to whom his Company was as Offensive as his Ravening was Oppressive nor could they get any Relief by their complaining of him to the Keepers  This Fellow hearing the Notice which was given for the  Bridewell  Men to go down in order to be removed to  Bridewell  again and hoping no Doubt that fresh Quarters would produce fresh Commons and that he should fare better with us than where he was thrust himself amongst us and went down into the Press Yard with us Which I knew not of till I saw him standing there with his Hat on and looking as demurely as he could that the Sheriff might take him for a  Quaker  at Sight of which my Spirit was much stirred  Wherefore as soon as the Sheriff had done speaking to us and we had made our Acknowledgment of his Kindness I stept a little nearer to him and pointing to that Fellow said That Man is not only none of our Company for he is no  Quaker  but is an idle dissolute Fellow who hath thrust himself in among our Friends to be sent to Prison with them that he might  live upon them therefore I desire we may not be troubled with him at  Bridewell  At this the Sheriff smiled and calling the Fellow forth said to him  How came you to be in Prison  I was taken at a Meeting said he  But what Business had you there  said the Sheriff I went to hear said he  Aye you went upon a  rse Design it seems  replied the Sheriff  but I'  disappoint you  said he  for I'll change your Company and send you to them that are like your self  Then calling for the  Turnkey  he said  Take this Fellow and put him among the Felons and be sure let him not trouble the Quakers any more  Hitherto this Fellow had stood with his Hat on as willing to have passed if he could for a  Quaker  but as soon as he heard this Doom passed on him off went his Hat and to bowing and scraping he fell with  Good your Worship have pity upon me and set me at Liberty No no  said the Sheriff  I will not so far disappoint you since you had a Mind to be in Prison in Prison you shall be for me  Then bidding the Turnkey take him away he had him up and put him among the Felons and so Friends had a good Deliverance from him  The Sheriff then bidding us Farewel the Porter of  Bridewell  came to us and told us  We know our Way to  Bridewell  without him and he could trust us therefore he would not stay nor go with us but left us to take our own time so we were in before Bedtime  Then went we up again to our Friends in  Newgate  and gave them an Account of what  had passed and having taken a solemn Leav  of them we made up our Packs to be gone  But before I pass from  Newgate  I think it no  amiss to give the Reader some little Accoun  of what I Observed while I was there  The common Side of  Newgate  is generally accounted as it really is the Worst part of that Prison not so much from the Place as the People it being usually stocked with the veriest Rogues and meanest sort of Felons and PickPockets who not being able to pay ChamberRent on the Master's Side are thrust in there And if they come in Bad to be sure they do not go out better for here they have an Opportunity to instruct one another in their Art and impart each to other what Improvements they have made therein  The Common Hall which is the first Room over the Gate is a good Place to walk in when the Prisoners are out of it saving the danger of catching some Cattle which they may have left in it and there I used to walk in a Morning before they were let up and sometimes in the Day time when they have been there  They all carried themselves respectfully towards me which I imputed chiefly to this That when any of our WomenFriends came there to Visit the Prisoners if they had not Relations of their own there to take care of them I as being a young Man and more at leisure than most others for I could not play the  Taylor  there was forward to go down with them to  the Grate and see them safe out And sometimes they have left Money in my Hands for the Felons who at such times were very importunate Beggars which I forthwith distributed among them in Bread which was to be had in the Place But so troublesome an Office it was that I thought one had as good have had a Pack of hungry Hounds about one as these when they knew there was a Dole to be given Yet this I think made them a little the more observant to me for they would dispose themselves to one side of the Room that they might make way for me to walk on the other And when I walked there I had usually a Book in my Hand on which I had mine Eye which made them think I did not heed what they said By this Means mine Ear being attentive to them I heard them relate one to another many of their Roguish Pranks  One Day as I was thus walking to and fro beside them I heard them recounting one to another what feats they had done at  Pocketpicking  and  Shoplifting  Whereupon turning short upon them I asked them Which of you all will undertake to pick my Pocket They were not very forward to Answer but viewed me round I wore a long Gown which was lap't over before and tied about the Middle and had no PocketHoles in it When they had a while considered it and I having taken another Turn was come up again to them One of them said  Why Master If you will Promise not to Prosecute us we will show you a Piece  of our Skill  Nay hold there said I I won  so far encourage you in Evil as to promise no  to prosecute and away I turned again hav+ing mine Eye on my Book but mine Ear  to them And in a while I heard them contriv+ing how they would have done it  I  said one of them  would give him the Budge and before he can recover himself you  said he to another of them  having your Penknife ready should  his Gown and then  said he  let  Honeypot  alone for the diving Part  This  Honeypot  was a little Boy then in Prison with them for Picking a Pocket who by his Stature did not seem to be above Ten or a Dozen Years old but for his Dexterity at  Pocketpicking  was held to be one of the top of the Trade As for the  Budg  I had had it given me often in the Street but understood not the Meaning of it till now and now I found it was a Jostle enough to throw one almost upon his Nose  I have sometimes occasionally been in the Hall in an Evening and have seen the Whores let in unto them which I take to be a common Practice Nasty Sluts indeed they were and in that respect the more suitable And as I have passed by them I have heard the Rogues and they making their Bargains which and which of them should Company together that Night Which abominable Wickedness must be imputed to the Dishonesty of the  Turnkeys  who for vile Gain to themselves not only suffer but further this Leudness  These are some of the common Evils which make the Common Side of  Newgate  in measure a Type of  HELL  upon  EARTH  But there was at that time something of another Nature more Particular and Accidental which was very Offensive to me  When we came first into  Newgate  there lay in a little Byplace like a Closet near the Room where we were Lodged the Quartered Bodies of three Men who had been Executed some Days before for a real or pretended Plot which was the Ground or at least Pretext for that Storm in the City which had caused this Imprisonment The Names of these three Men were  Philips Tongue  and  Gibs  and the Reason why their Quarters lay so long there was The Relations were all that while Petitioning to have leave to bury them which at length with much ado was obtained for the Quarters but not for the Heads which were Ordered to be set up in some Parts of the City  I saw the Heads when they were brought  p to be Boyled The Hangman fetch'd them  n a dirty Dust Basket out of some ByPlace  nd setting them down amongst the Felons he  nd they made Sport with them They took  hem by the Hair Flouting Jeering and Laugh  ng at them and then giving them some ill Names box'd them on the Ears and Cheeks Which done the Hangman put them into his Kettle and parboyl'd them with  BaySalt  and  CumminSeed  that to keep them from Putrefaction and this to keep off the Fowls from  seizing on them The whole Sight as we  that of the Bloody Quarters first as this of th  Heads afterwards was both frightful an loathsom and begat an Abhorrence in my Na+ture Which as it had rendered my Confine+ment there by much the more uneasie so  made our Removal from thence to  Bridewell  even in that respect the more welcome Whi+ther we now go  For having as I hinted before made up our Packs and taken our Leave of our  Friends  whom we were to leave behind we took our Bundles on our Shoulders and walked Two and Two a Breast through the  Old Baily  into  FleetStreet  and so to  Old Bridewell  And it being about the middle of the Afternoon and the Streets pretty full of People both the Shop+keepers at their Doors and Passengers in the Way would stop us and ask us what we were and whither we were going And when we had told them we were Prisoners going from one Prison to another from  Newgate  to  Bride+well    What  said they  without a Keeper  No  said we for our Word which we have given  is our Keeper Some thereupon would advis  us not to go to Prison but to go home Bu  we told them we could not do so we coul  suffer for our Testimony but could not fl  from it I do not remember we had any Abus  offered us but were generally pitied by th  People  When we were come to  Bridewell  we wer  not put up into the great Room in which we ha  en before but into a low Room in another  ir Court which had a Pump in the Middle  it And here we were not shut up as be  re but had the Liberty of the Court to walk  and of the Pump to wash or drink at And  deed we might easily have gone quite away  we would there was a Passage through the  urt into the Street but we were true and  ady Prisoners and looked upon this Liberty  sing from their Confidence in us to be a  nd of  Paroll  upon us so that both Conscience  d Honour stood now engaged for our true  prisonment  Adjoyning to this Room wherein we were  as such another both newly fitted up for  orkHouses  and accordingly furnished with  ry great Blocks for Beating Hemp upon  d a lusty WhippingPost there was in each  d it was said That  Richard Brown  had Or  red those Blocks to be provided for the  Qua  s  to Work on resolving to try his Strength  ith us in that Case but if that was his Pur  se it was overruled for we never had any Work Offered us nor were we treated after the Manner of those that are to be so Used Yet we set our selves to Work on them for being  ery large they served the  Taylors  for Shop  ards and others wrought upon them as  ey had Occasion and they served us very well for Tables to eat on  We had also besides this Room the Use of  ur former Chamber above to go into when we thought fit and thither sometimes I withdrew  when I found a Desire for Retiremen  and Privacy or had something on my Mind t  write which could not so well be done in Com+pany And indeed about this time my Spiri  was more than ordinarily Exercised though on very different Subjects For on the one hand the Sense of the Exceeding LOVE and GOODNESS of the  LORD  to me in his Gracious and Tender Dealings with me did deeply affect my Heart and caused me to break forth in a  SONG  of THANKSGI+VING and PRAISE to Him And on the other hand a Sense of the  Prophaneness  Debaucheries Cruelties  and other  horr  Impieties  of the AGE fell heavy on me and lay as a pressing Weight upon my Spi+rit And this drew from me a close  Exp  +bration  which my mournful Muse vented i  the following Lines to which I gave for a Title  Speculum SECULI  OR A LOOKINGGLASS FOR THE TIMES  hich began with this  Expostulatory Preface  WHY should my Modest  MUSE  forbidden be  To speak of that which but too many see  y should she by Conniving seem t' uphold  s Wickedness and thereby make them bold  l to persist in't Why should she

Consideration of thy State  And thine I fear inevitable Fate  Doth move my Heart with  Pity  and  Compassion  And leads me to this short  Expostulation  Who to the Eye gave Sight what shall not he  The Cruel Sufferings of his People see  And shall not he that formed hath the Ear  The mournful Groans of his  dear Children  hear  Are Men so stupid grown they think GOD's Blind  Or that he doth not

peculiar Heritage  For of a Truth his longprovoked Hand  Is stretched out in Judgment o'er this Land  And ye must feel it for he hath decreed  To vindicate his long oppressed Seed  And in his Fury he will Vengeance take  In our Behalfs who suffer for his sake  Then shall ye know That he who sits on high  Regards us as the Apple of his Eye  To this occasionally I subjoined a POSTSCRIPT thus  SINCE what precedes was written I have found  An Accusation form'd but without Ground  Against me That  with uncontrouled Pen  I too severely lash the Faults of Men  And take upon me in Satyrick Rhimes  To pass a rigid Censure on the Times  This drew me on to add another Line  To shew them that the Fault's their own not mine  No Crime can justly to my charge be laid  Unless it be a Crime  That Truth be said  Nor can without Injustice any blame  My Muse for Echoing the Common Fame  If any should Object  That wise Men hold  That Truth at all times ought not to be told  Nor that  whatever comes into ones Head  Should straight because 'tis true be published  I readily assent because I know  Pearls before Swine we are forbid to through  Some Truths I grant may better be conceal'd  Than if they out of Season were reveal'd  Yet would I not that any through Mistake  Should of my Words a Misconstruction make  Than that should happen I had rather be  Tax't by the Reader for  Prolixity  Thus then in brief would I be understood  If what I know concerns my Brother's good  For him to know Ought I not then unfold  It to him rather than from him withhold  A Benefit So on the other side  It is I think too plain to be deny'd  That if I see what certainly doth tend  To the Hurt of my Neighbour or my Friend  I am oblig'd by  Christian Charity  To give them warning of the danger nigh  To shew them that they stand upon the brink  Of certain Ruin and if then they sink  By wilful Running on I shall be free  From Guilt their Blood on their own Heads will be  'Tis plain I think yet if ye can't believe it  Without a ScriptureProof lo here  Levit    Ezek    I give it  This is the very Case which if well weigh'd  Will fully justifie what I have said  I saw Men Running to a Precipice  At Foot of which was such a vast Abyss  As could have swallow'd Nations so immense  That 'twas impossible to climb out thence  For if a Man we see but chance to pitch  O'er Head and Ears into some miry Ditch  How quickly

me that I have done ill  In yielding to my own corrupted Will  And though no Eye did see me yet my Heart  I feel is full of Torment Pain and Smart  Were it to do again I'd have more Care  And not run

return from  Newgate  thither w  we had more Liberty and more Opportu  and Room for Retirement and Thought as the Poet said  Carmina Scribentes Secessum Otia quaer  They who would write in Mea  Retire where they may Stilness have and  And this Priviledge we enjoyed by the Indulgence of our Keeper whose Heart God disposed  o Favour us So that both the Master and his  orter were very civil and kind to us and  ad been so indeed all along For when we were shut up before the Porter would readily  t some of us go home in an Evening and stay  t Home till next Morning which was a great Conveniency to Men of Trade and Business which I being free from forbore asking for my  elf that I might not hinder others  This he observed and asked me when I  eant to ask to go out I told him I had not  uch Occasion nor Desire yet at sometime or  ther perhaps I might have but when I had  would ask him but once and if he then de  ed me I would ask him no more  After we were come back from  Newgate  I  ad a Desire to go thither again to visit my  riends  who were Prisoners there more espe  ially my dear Friend and Father in  Christ    dward Burrough  who was then a Prisoner  ith many  Friends  more in that Part of  New  ate  which was then called  JusticeHall  Whereupon the Porter coming in my way I  sked him to let me go out for an Hour or two  o see some  Friends  of mine that Evening  He to enhanse the Kindness made it a matter  f some Difficulty and would have me stay  ll another Night I told him I would be at  Word with him for as I had told him before  hat if he denied me I would ask him no  ore so he should find I would keep to it  He was no sooner gone out of my Sight bu  I espied his Master crossing the Court Where+fore stepping to him I asked him If he was willing to let me go out for a little while to see some Friends of mine that Evening  Yes  said he  very willing  and thereupon away walked I to  Newgate  where having spent the Evening among  Friends  I returned in good time  Under this easie Restraint we lay till the Court sate at the  OldBaily  again And then whether it was that the Heat of the Storm was somewhat abated or by what other means Providence wrought it I know not we were called to the Bar and without further Question discharged  Whereupon we returned to  Bridewell  again and having raised some Monies among us and therewith gratified both the Master and his Porter for their Kindness to us we spent sometime in a solemn Meeting to return our thankful Acknowledgement to the LORD both for His Preservation of us in Prison and Deliverance of us out of it and then taking a solemn Farewel of each other we departed with Bag and Baggage And I took care to return my Hammack to the Owner with due Acknowledgement of his great Kindness in lending it me  Being now at Liberty I visited more generally my Friends that were still in Prison and more particularly my Friend and Benefactor  William Penington  at his House and then went to wait upon my Master  Milton  With whom  yet I could not propose to enter upon my intermitted Studies until I had been in  Buckinghamshire  to visit my worthy Friends  Isaac Penington  and his Virtuous Wife with other Friends in that Country  Thither therefore I betook my self and the Weather being Frosty and the Ways by that means clean and good I walked it thorow in a Day and was received by my Friends there with such Demonstration of hearty Kindness as made my Journey very easie to me  I had spent in my Imprisonment that Twenty Shillings which I had received of  William Penington  and Twenty of the Fourty which had been sent me from  Mary Penington  and had the Remainder then about me That therefore I now returned to her with due Acknowledgement of her Husband's and her great Care of me and Liberality to me in the time of my Need She would have had me kept it But I beg'd her to accept it from me again since it was the Redundancy of their Kindness and the other Part had answered the Occasion for which it was sent and my Importunity prevailed  I intended only a Visit hither not a Continuance and therefore purposed after I had staid a few Days to return to my Lodging and former Course in  London  but Providence ordered it otherwise  Isaac Penington  had at that time two Sons and one Daughter all then very young of whom the Eldest Son  John Penington  and the  Daughter  Mary  the Wife of  Daniel Wharley  are yet living at the writing of this And being himself both Skilful and Curious in  Pronounciation  he was very desirous to have them well grounded in the  Rudiments of the English Tongue  to which End he had sent for a Man out of  Lancashire  whom upon enquiry he had heard of who was undoubtedly the most accurate  English Teacher  that ever I met with or have heard of His Name was  Richard Bradley  But as he pretended no higher than the  English Tongue  and had led them by  Grammar Rules  to the highest Improvement they were capable of in that he had then taken his Leave of them and was gone up to  London  to Teach an  English School  of  Friends  Children there  This put my Friend to a fresh Straight He had sought for a New Teacher to instruct his Children in the  Latin Tongue  as the Old had done in the  English  but had not yet found one Wherefore one Evening as we sate together by the Fire in his BedChamber which for want of Health he kept He asked me his Wife being by  If I would be so kind to him as to stay a while with him till he could hear of such a Man as he aimed at and in the mean time enter his Children in the Rudiments of the  Latin Tongue  This Question was not more unexpected than surprizing to me and the more because it seemed directly to thwart my former Purpose and Undertaking of endeavouring to improve my self by following my Studies with my Master  Milton  which this would give at  least a present Divertion from and for how long I could not foresee  But the Sense I had of the manifold Obligations I lay under to these worthy Friends of mine shut out all Reasonings and disposed my Mind to an absolute Resignation to their Desire that I might testifie my Gratitude by a Willingness to do them any friendly Service that I could be capable of  And though I questioned my Ability to carry on that Work to its due Height and Proportion yet as that was not proposed but an Initiation only by  Accidence  into  Grammar  I consented to the Proposal as a present Expedient till a more qualified Person should be found without further Treaty or mention of Terms between us than that of mutual Friendship And to render this Digression from my own Studies the less uneasie to my Mind I recollected and often thought of that Rule in  Lilly  Qui docet indoctos licet indoctissimus esset  Ipse brevi reliquis doctior esse queat  He that th' Unlearn'd doth teach may quickly be  More Learn'd than they though most Unlearned He  With this Consideration I undertook this Province and left it not until I Married which was not till the Year near Seven  Years from the time I came thither In which time having the Use of my Friends Books as well as of mine own I spent my leasure Hours much in Reading not without some improvement to my self in my private Studies which with the good Success of my Labours bestowed on the Children and the Agreeableness of Conversation which I found in the Family rendered my Undertaking more Satisfactory and my Stay there more easie to me  But alas not many Days not to say Weeks had I been there e're we were almost overwhelmed with Sorrow for the unexpected Loss of  Edward Burrough  who was justly very dear to us all  This not only Good but Greatgood Man by a long and close Confinement in  Newgate  through the Cruel Malice and Malicious Cruelty of  Richard Brown  was taken away by hasty Death to the unutterable Grief of very many and unspeakable Loss to the CHURCH of CHRIST in general  The particular Obligation I had to him as the immediate Instrument of my Convincement and high Affection for him resulting therefrom did so deeply affect my Mind that it was some pretty time before my Passion could prevail to express it self in Words so true I found that of the  Tragoedian  Curae leves loqunntur  Ingentes Stupent  Light Griefs break forth and easily get vent  Great Ones are thro' Amazement closely pent  At length my MUSE not bearing to be any longer mute brake forth in the following  ACROSTICK  which she called  A Pathetick  ELEGY  on the Death of that dear and faithful Servant of GOD  EDWARD BURROUGH  Who died the    th of the    th Month    And thus she Introduceth it  HOW long shall Grief lie smother'd Ah how long  Shall Sorrow's Signet seal my silent Tongue  How long shall Sighs me suffocate And make  My Lips to quiver and my Heart to ake  How long shall I with Pain suppress my Cries  And seek for Holes to wipe my wat'ry Eyes  Why may not I by Sorrow thus opprest  Pour forth my Grief into another's Breast  If that be true which once was said by one  That  Ille dolet vere qui sine Teste dolet  He mourns truly who doth Mourn alone  Then may I truly say My Grief is true  Since it hath yet been known to very few  Nor is it now mine Aim to make

I had thus been breathing forth my Grief  hopes thereby to get me some Relief  heard methought his Voice say  Cease to Mourn  Live And though the Vail of Flesh once worn  now stript off dissolv'd and laid aside  Spirit's with thee and shall so abide  is satisfy'd me Down I threw my Quill  illing to be resign'd to GOD's pure Will  Having discharged this Duty to the Memory  my deceased Friend I went on in my new  vince Instructing my little Pupils in the  diments of the  Latin Tongue  to the mutual  tisfaction of both their Parents and my self As  n as I had gotten a little Money in my Poc  t which as a  Premium  without Compact I  eived from them I took the first Opportu  y to return to my Friend  William Penington  Money which he had so kindly furnished  with in my need at the time of my Imprisonment  in  Bridewell  with a due Acknowledgement of my Obligation to him for it He was not at all forward to receive it so that I was fain to press it upon him  While thus I remained in this Family various Suspicions arose in the Minds of some concerning me with respect to  Mary Penington  's fair Daughter  Guli  For she having now arrived to a Marriageable Age and being in all re+spects a very desirable Woman whether re+gard was had to her outward Person whic  wanted nothing to render her compleatly Come+ly or to the Endowments of her Mind whic  were every way Extraordinary and highly O+bliging or to her outward Fortune whic  was fair and which with some hath not th  last nor the least place in Consideration sh  was openly and secretly sought and solicite  by many and some of them almost of ever  Rank and Condition Good and Bad Ric  and Poor Friend and Foe To whom in the  respective turns till he at length came  whom she was reserved she carried her se  with so much Evenness of Temper such cou  +teous Freedom guarded with the strictest Mo+desty that as it gave Encouragement  ground of Hopes to none so neither did it a  +minister any matter of Offence or just Cau  of Complaint to any  But such as were thus either engaged  themselves or desirous to make themselves Ad+vocates for others could not I observed  look upon me with an Eye of Jealousie a  Fear that I would improve the Opportunities I had by frequent and familiar Conversation with her to my own Advantage in working my self into her good Opinion and Favour to  he Ruin of their Pretences  According therefore to the several Kinds and Degrees of their Fears of me they suggested  her Parents their ill Surmises against me  Some stuck not to question the Sincerity of  y Intentions in Coming at first among the  uakers  urging with a  why may it not be so  hat the Desire and Hopes of obtaining by that  eans so fair a Fortune might be the prime and  ief Inducement to me to thrust my self amongst  at People  But this Surmise could find no  ace with those worthy Friends of mine her  ther in Law and her Mother who besides  e clear Sense and sound Judgment they had  themselves knew very well upon what  erms I came among them how straight and  rd the Passage was to me how contrary to  worldly Interest which lay fair another  ay how much I had suffered from my Fa  er for it and how regardless I had been of  tempting or seeking any thing of that Na  re in these three or four Years that I had  en amongst them  Some others measuring me by the Propen  y of their own Inclinations concluded I  uld Steal her run away with her and Mar  her Which they thought I might be the  re easily induced to do from the advanta  us Opportunities I frequently had of riding  and walking abroad with her by Night as well as by Day without any other Company than her Maid For so great indeed was the Confidence that her Mother had in me that she thought her Daughter safe if I was with her even from the Plots and Designs that others had upon her And so Honourable were the Thoughts she entertained concerning me as would not suffer her to admit a Suspicion that I could be capable of so much Baseness as to betray the Trust she with so great Freedom reposed in me  I was not Ignorant of the various Fears which filled the jealous Heads of some concerning me neither was I so stupid nor so divested of all Humanity as not to be sensible of the real and innate Worth and Vertue which adorned that excellent Dame and attracted the Eye and Hearts of so many with the greatest Im+portunity to seek and solicit her Nor was I  devoid of Natural Heat as not to feel som  Sparklings of Desire as well as others But th  Force of TRUTH and Sense of Honour su  +prest whatever would have risen beyond th  Bounds of fair and vertuous Friendship Fo  easily foresaw that if I should have attempte  any thing in a dishonourable way by For  or Fraud upon her I should have thereb  bought a Wound upon mine own Soul a fo  Scandal upon my Religious Profession and  infamous Stain upon mine Honour either  which was far more dear unto me than my Li  Wherefore having observed how some othe  had befool'd themselves by misconstruing her common Kindness expressed in an innocent open free and familiar Conversation springing from the abundant Affability Courtesy and Sweetness of her natural Temper to be the Effect of a singular Regard and peculiar Affection to them I resolved to shun the Rock on which I had seen so many run and split and remembring that Saying of the POET  Foelix quem faciunt aliena Pericular cautum  Happy's He  Whom others Dangers wary make to be  I governed my self in a free yet respect  ul Carriage towards her that I thereby both  reserved a fair Reputation with my Friends  nd Enjoyed as much of her Favour and Kind  ess in a virtuous and firm Friendship as was fit for her to shew or for me to seek  Thus leading a quiet and contented Life I  ad Leisure sometimes to write a Copy of Ver  s on one Occasion or another as the  Poetick Vein  naturally opened without taking Pains to  olish them Such was this which follows  ccasioned by the suddain Death of some lusty People in their full Strength

the rising Sun  Displays his Beams above the Horizon  As the Consideration of the  Uncertainty of HUMANE LIFE  drew the foregoing Lines from me so the Sense I had of the  FOLLY of MANKIND  in misspending the little Time allow'd them in Evil Ways and vain Sports led me more particularly to trace the several Courses wherein the Generallity of Men run unprofitably at best if not to their Hurt and Ruin Which I introduced with that Axiom of the  Preacher Eccles    ALL IS VANITY  See here the State of MAN as in a Glass  And how the Fashion of this World doth pass  SOME in a  Tavern  spend the

which the Generality of Men misspent their Time I sang the following  ODE  in Praise of VERTUE  WEALTH Beauty Pleasures Honours all adieu  I value  Vertue  far far more than you  Y'are all but Toys  For Girls and Boys  To play withal at best deceitful Joys  She lives for ever ye are transitory  Her Honour is unstained but your Glory  Is meer Deceit  A painted Bait  Hung out for such as sit at

resolving to se  his  Estate  and having reserved for his own us  such parts of his HousholdGoods as he though  fit not willing to take upon himself the Tro  +ble of selling the Rest gave them unto me  Whereupon I went down to  Crowel  and ha  +ing before given Notice there and thereabou  that I intended a Publick Sale of them I So  them and thereby put some Money into my Pocket Yet I Sold such things only as I judged Useful leaving the  Pictures  and  Armour  of which there was some store there unsold  Not long after this my Father sent for me to come to him at  London  about some Business which when I came there I understood was to joyn with him in the Sale of his Estate Which the Purchaser required for his own Satisfaction and Safety I being then the next Heir to it in Law And although I might probably have made some Advantageous Terms for my self by standing off yet when I was satisfied by  Counsel that there was no Entail upon it or Right of Reversion to me but that he might  awfully dispose of it as he pleased I readily  yned with him in the Sale without asking  r having the least Gratuity or Compensation  o not so much as the Fee I had given to Coun  l to secure me from any Danger in doing it  There having been some time before this a  ery severe Law made against the  Quakers  by Name and more particularly Prohibiting our Meetings under the sharpest Penalties of  Five  ounds  for the first Offence so called  Ten Pounds  r the Second and  Banishment  for the Third  nder pain of  Felony  for Escaping or Returning without  License  Which Law was looked up  n to have been procured by the  Bishops  in or  er to bring us to a Conformity to their way of  Worship  I wrote a few Lines in way of  Dialogue  etween a  Bishop  and a  Quaker  which I called  CONFORMITY  Prest and Represt  B  WHAT You are one of them that do deny  To yield Obedience by Conformity  Q  Nay We desire Conformable to be  B  But unto what Q  The Image of the Son  Rom    B  What's that to us We'll have Conformity  Unto our Form Q  Then we shall ne'er have done  For if your fickle Minds should alter w  Should be to seek a New Conformity  Thus who to Day Conform to  Prelacy  To Morrow may Conform to  Popery  But take this for an Answer  Bishop  we  Cannot Conform either to Them or Thee  For while to  Truth  your Forms are opposite  Whoe'er Conforms thereto doth not aright  B  We'll make such Knaves as you Conform or lie  Confin'd in Prisons till ye Rot and Die  Q  Well gentle  Bishop  I may live to see  For all thy Threats a Check to Cruelty  And thee Rewarded with thy envious Crew  According as unto your Works is due  But in the mean time I for my Defence  Betake me to my Fortress PATIENCE  No sooner was this Cruel Law made but it was put in Execution with great Severity The sense whereof working strongly on my Spirit made me Cry earnestly to the Lord that he would Arise and set up his Righteous Judgment in the Earth for the Deliverance of his People from all their Enemies both Inward and Outward And in these Terms I uttered it  AWake awake O Arm o'th' Lord awake  Thy Sword up take  Cast what would thine forgetful of thee make  Into the Lake  Awake I Pray O mighty  Jah  awake  Make all the World before thy Presence quake  Not only Earth but Heaven also shake  Arise arise O  Jacob  's God arise  And hear the Cries  Of ev'ry Soul which in Distress now lies  And to thee Flies  Arise I Pray O  Israel  's Hope arise  Set free thy Seed Opprest by Enemies  Why should they over it still Tyrannize  Make Speed make Speed O  Israel  's Help make Speed  In time of Need  For Evil Men have Wickedly decreed  Against thy Seed  Make Speed I Pray O mighty God make Speed  Let all thy  Lambs  from Savage  Wolves  be freed  That fearless on thy Mountain they may Feed  Ride on Ride on thou Valiant Man of Might  And put to Flight  Those Sons of  Belial  who do Despight  To the Upright  Ride on I say Thou Champion and Smitc  Thine and thy Peoples En'mies with such Might  That none may dare 'gainst thee or thine to Fight  Although the Storm raised by the Act fo  Banishment  fell with the greatest Weight an  Force upon some other Parts as at  London  Hertford  c Yet we were not in  Bucking+hamshire  wholly exempted therefrom for a part of that Shower reached us also  For a  Friend  of  Amersham  whose Name was  Edward Perot  or  Parret  departing this Life and Notice being given that his Body would be Buried there on such a Day which was the First Day of the Fifth Month the  Friends  of the adjacent parts of the Country resorted pretty generally to the Burial So that there was a fair Appearance of  Friends  and  Neighbours  the Deceased having been well beloved by both  After we had spent some time together in the House  Morgan Watkins  who at that time happen'd to be at  Isaac Penington  's being with us the Body was taken up and born on  Friends  Shoulders along the Street in order to be Carried to the BuryingGround which was at the  Towns End being part of an  Orchard  belong  ng to the Deceased which he in his Life time  ad appointed for that Service  It so happened that one  Ambrose Benett  a  arister  at Law and a  Justice  of the Peace for  hat County Riding through the Town that Morning in his way to  Alesbury  was by some  disposed Person or other Informed that  here was a  Quaker  to be Buried there that Day  nd that most of the  Quakers  in the Country were come thither to the Burial  Upon this he set up his Horses and staid  nd when we not knowing any thing of his Design against us went Innocently forward to  erform our Christian Duty for the Interrment  f our  Friend  He rushed out of his Inn upon  s with the Constables and a Rabble of Rude  ellows whom he had gathered together and  aving his drawn Sword in his Hand Struck  ne of the Foremost of the Bearers with it Commanding them to set down the Coffin But the  Friend  who was so stricken whose Name was  Thomas Dell  being more concerned  or the safety of the Dead Body than his own  est it should fall from his Shoulder and any In  ecency thereupon follow held the Coffin fast Which the  Justice  observing and being enraged  at his Word how unjust soever was not  rthwith Obeyed set his Hand to the Coffin  d with a forcible Thrust threw it off from the  earers Shoulders so that it fell to the Ground  the midst of the Street and there we were  rced to leave it  For immediately thereupon the  Justice  giving Command for the Apprehending us the Constables with the Rabble fell on us and drew some and drove others into the Inn giving thereby an Opportunity to the rest to walk away  Of those that were thus taken I was one And being with many more put into a Room under a Guard we were kept there till another Justice called Sir  Thomas Clayton  whom Justice  Benett  had sent for to joyn with him in Committing us was come And then being called forth severally before them they picked out Ten of us and Committed us to  Alesbury  Goal for what neither we nor they knew For we were not Convicted of having either done or said any thing which the Law could take hold of For they took us up in the open Street the King's Highway not doing any Unlawful Act but peaceably Carrying and Accompanying the Corps of our Deceased  Friend  to Bury it Which they would not suffer us to do but caused the Body to lie in the open Street and in the Cartway so that all the Travellers that passed by whether  HorseMen Coaches Carts  or  Waggons  were fain to break out of the Way to go by it that they might not drive over it until it was almost Night And then having caused a Grave to be made in the  Unconsecrated  part as it is accounted of that which is called the  ChurchYard  they forcibly took the Body from the Widow whose Right and Property it was and Buried it there  When the  Justices  had delivered us Prisoners to the  Constable  it being then late in the Day which was the Seventh Day of the Week He not willing to go so far as  Alesbury  Nine long Miles with us that Night nor to put the Town to the Charge of keeping us there that Night and the first Day and Night following Dismist us upon our  Parole  to come to him again  t a set Hour on the Second Day Morning Whereupon we all went home to our respective Habitations and coming to him punctually  ccording to Promise were by him without Guard Conducted to the Prison  The Goaler whose Name was  Nathaniel  irch  had not long before behaved himself ve  y Wickedly with great Rudeness and Cruel  y to some of our  Friends  of the lower side of  he County whom he Combining with the Clerk of the Peace whose Name was  Henry Wells  had contrived to get into his Goal and  fter they were legally Discharged in Court  etained them in Prison using great Violence  nd shutting them up close in the Common Goal  mong the Felons because they would not give  im his Unrighteous Demand of  Fees  which  hey were the more straightned in from his Treacherous Dealing with them And they  aving through Suffering maintained their  reedom and obtained their Liberty We were the more concerned to keep what they  ad so hardly gained and therefore resolved  ot to make any Contract or Terms for either  ChamberRent  or  Fees  but to Demand a  Fre  Prison which we did  When we came in the Goaler was Ridde  out to Wait on the Judges who came in tha  Day to begin the Assize and his Wife wa  somewhat at a Loss how to deal with us Bu  being a cunning Woman she treated us wit  great Appearance of Courtesy offering us th  Choice of all her Rooms and when we asked  upon what Terms she still refer'd us to he  Husband telling us she did not doubt but tha  he would be very Reasonable and Civil to u  Thus she endeavoured to have drawn us to tak  Possession of some of lier Chambers at a ven+ture and trust to her Husbands kind Usag  But we who at the Cost of our  Friends  had  Proof of his Kindness were too wary to b  drawn in by the fair Words of a Woman an  therefore told her we would not settle an  where till her Husband came Home and the  would have a Free Prison wheresoever he put u  Accordingly Walking all together into th  Court of the Prison in which was a Well o  very good Water and having before hand sen  to a  Friend  in the Town a Widow Woma  whose Name was  Sarah Lambarn  to bring u  some  Bread  and  Cheese  we sate down upon th  Ground round about the Well and when w  had Eaten we Drank of the Water out of th  Well  Our great Concern was for our Friend  Isa  Penington  because of the Tenderness of h  Constitution But he was so lively in his Spirit  nd so cheerfully given up to Suffer that he ra  her encouraged us than needed any Encou  agement from us  In this Posture the Goaler when he came  me found us and having before he came to  consulted his Wife and by her understood  what Terms we stood When he came to  he hid his Teeth and putting on a shew of  indness seemed much troubled that we should  there abroad especially his old Friend Mr  enington  and thereupon invited us to come in  d take what Rooms in his House we pleased  e asked upon what Terms letting him know  ithal that we determined to have a Free Prison He like the  Sun  and  Wind  in the  Fable  that ove which of them should take from the Tra  ler his  Cloak  having like the  Wind  tried  gh boisterous violent Means to our  Friends  fore but in vain resolved now to imitate  e  Sun  and shine as pleasantly as he could up  us Wherefore he told us we should  make  Terms our selves and be as free as we desired  we thought fit when we were Released to give  any thing he would thank us for it and if  he would Demand nothing  Upon these Terms we went in and disposed  r selves some in the  DwellingHouse  others  the  MaltHouse  where they chose to be  During the Assize we were brought before  dge  Morton  a Sowre Angry Man who very  ely Reviled us but would not hear either us  or the Cause but referred the matter to t  Two Justices who had Committed us  They when the Assize was ended sent for  to be brought before them at their Inn and Fi  +ed us as I remember  Six Shillings Eight Pen  a piece which we not consenting to Pay th  Committed us to Prison again for one Mon  from that time on the Act for  Banishment  When we had lain there that Month I wi  another went to the Goaler to Demand o  Liberty Which he readily granted telling  The Door should be opened when we pleased to go  This Answer of his I reported to the rest  my  Friends  there and thereupon we raised  +mong us a small Sum of Money which th  put into my Hand for the Goaler Whereup  I taking another with me went to the Goa  with the Money in my Hand and remindi  him of the Terms upon which we accepted t  use of his Rooms I told him That althou  we could not pay  ChamberRent  or  Fees  Yet  +asmuch as he had now been Civil to us  were willing to acknowledge it by a small T  +ken and thereupon gave him the Money  putting it into his Pocket said  I thank you  your Friends for it and to let you see I take it  Gift not a Debt I will not look on it to see  much it is  The Prison Door being then set open for  we went out and departed to our respecti  Homes  But before I left the Prison considering  Day with my self the different Kinds of Lib  and Confinement Freedom and Bondage  ook my Pen and wrote the following  Aenig    or  Riddle  LOE here a Riddle to the Wise  In which a Mystery there lies  Read it therefore with that Eye  Which can discern a Mystery  The RIDDLE  ome Men are Free while they in Prison Lie  thers who ne'r saw Prison Captives Die  CAUTION  He that can receive it may  He that cannot Let him stay  And not be hasty but suspend  His Judgment till he sees the End  SOLUTION  He only's free indeed that's free from Sin  And he is fastest bound that's bound therein  CONCLUSION  This is the Liberty I chiefly Prize  The other without this I can despise  Some little time before I went to  Alesbur  Prison I was desired by my quondam Maste  Milton  to take an House for him in the Neig  +bourhood where I dwelt that he might go ou  of the City for the Safety of himself and hi  Family the  Pestilence  then growing hot in  Lo  +don  I took a pretty Box for him in  GilesCha  +font  a Mile from me of which I gave hi  notice and intended to have waited on hi  and seen him well settled in it but was pr  +vented by that Imprisonment  But now being released and returned Hom  I soon made a Visit to him to welcome him i  +to the Country  After some common Discourses had passed be+tween us he called for a Manuscript of his  which being brought he delivered to me bi  +ding me take it home with me and read it a  my Leisure and when I had so done return i  to him with my Judgment thereupon  When I came home and had set my self t  read it I found it was that Excellent POEM  which he entituled  PARADISE LOST  After I had with the best Attention read i  through I made him another Visit and re+turned him his Book with due Acknowledge+ment of the Favour he had done me in Com+municating it to me He asked me how I liked it and what I thought of it which I modestly but freely told him and after some further Discourse about it I pleasantly said to him Thou hast said much here of  Paradise Lost  but what hast thou to say of  Paradise Found  He made  me no Answer but sate some time in a Muse  hen brake off that Discourse and fell upon a  other Subject  After the Sickness was over and the City well cleansed and become safely habitable again  e returned thither And when afterwards I went to wait on him there which I seldom fail  d of doing whenever my Occasions drew me  o  London  he shewed me his Second POEM  alled  PARADISE REGAINED  nd in a pleasant Tone said to me  This is owing  o you for you put it into my Head by the Question  ou put to me at  Chalfont  which before I had not  hought of  But from this Digression I return  o the Family I then lived in  We had not been long at home about a Month perhaps before  Isaac Penington  was taken out of his House in an Arbitrary manner by Military Force and carried Prisoner to  Ales  ury  Goal again where he lay Three Quarters of a Year with great Hazard of his Life it being the  Sickness  Year and the Plague being not only in the Town but in the Goal  Mean while his Wife and Family were turned out of his House called the  Grange  at  Peter'sChalfont  by them who had seized upon his Estate And the Family being by that means broken up some went one way others another  Mary Penington  her self with her younger Children went down to her Husband at  Alesbury Guli  with her Maid went to  Bristol  to see her former Maid  Anne Hersent  who was Married to a Merchant of that City  whose Name was  Thomas Biss  I went to  Alesbury  with the Children but not finding the Place agreeable to my Health I soon left it and returning to  Chalfont  took a Lodging and was dieted in the House of a Friendly Man and after some time went to  Bristol  to Conduct  Guli  home  Mean while  Mary Penington  took Lodgings in a FarmHouse called  Bottrels  in the Parish of  GilesChalfont  where when we returned from  Bristol  we found her  We had been there but a very little time before I was sent to Prison again upon this Occasion There was in those times a Meeting once a Month at the House of  George Salter  a Friend of  Hedgerly  to which we sometimes went and  Morgan Watkins  being with us He and I with  Guli  and her Maid and one  Judith Parker  Wife of Dr  Parker  one of the Colledge of  Physicians  at  London  with a Maiden Daughter of theirs neither of whom were  Quakers  but as Acquaintance of  Mary Penington  were with her on a Visit walked over to that Meeting it being about the Middle of the First Month and the Weather good  This Place was about a Mile from the House of  Ambrose Benett  the Justice who the Summer before had sent me and some other Friends to  Alesbury  Prison from the Burial of  Edward Parret  of  Amersham  And he by what Means I know not getting Notice not only of the Meeting but as was supposed of our being there came himself to it and as he came  atched up a Stackwoodstick big enough to  ave knock't any Man down and brought it with him hidden under his Cloak  Being come to the House he stood for a while without the Door and out of Sight listning  o hear what was said for  Morgan  was then speaking in the Meeting But certainly he heard very imperfectly if it was true which we heard he said afterwards among his Companions as an Argument that  Morgan  was a  Jesuit  viz  That in his Preaching he trolled over his  Latin  as fluently as ever he heard any one  whereas  Morgan  good Man was better Versed in  Welch  than in  Latin  which I suppose he had never learned I am sure he did not understand it  When this Martial Justice who at  Amersham  had with his drawn Sword struck an unarmed Man who he knew would not strike again had now stood some time abroad on a suddain he rushed in among us with the Stackwoodstick held up in his Hand ready to strike crying out  Make way there  and an Ancient Woman not getting soon enough out of his way he struck her with the Stick a shrewd Blow over the Breast Then pressing through the Croud to the place where  Morgan  stood he plucked him from thence and caused so great a Disorder in the Room that it brake the Meeting up yet would not the People go away or disperse themselves but tarried to see what the Issue would be  Then taking Pen and Paper he sate down at the Table among us and asked several of us our Names which we gave and he set down in Writing  Amongst others he asked  Judith Parker  the Doctor's Wife what her Name was which she readily gave and thence taking Occasion to discourse him she so overmastered him by clear Reason delivered in fine Language that he glad to be rid of her struck out her Name and Dismist her yet did not she remove but kept her place amongst us  When he had taken what Number of Names he thought fit he singled out half a Dozen whereof  Morgan  was one I another One Man more and three Women of which the Woman of the House was one although her Husband then was and for divers Years before had been a Prisoner in the  Fleet  for Tythes and had no body to take care of his Family and Business but her his Wife  Us six he committed to  Alesbury  Goal Which when the Doctor's Wife heard him read to the Constable she attacked him again and having put him in Mind that it was a sickly Time and that the  Pestilence  was reported to be in that Place she in handsome Terms desired him to Consider in time  how he would Answer the Cry of our Blood if by his sending us to be shut up in an Infected Place we should lose our Lives there  This made him alter his Purpose and by a new  Mittimus  sent us to the  House of Correction  at  Wiccomb  And although he committed us upon  the Act for  Banishment  which limited a certain time for Imprisonment yet he in his  Mittimus  imitted no time but ordered us to be kept till we should be delivered by due Course of LAW so little regardful was he though a Lawyer of keeping to the Letter of the LAW  We were committed on the Thirteenth Day of the Month called  March  and were kept close Prisoners there till the Seventh Day of the Month called  June  which was some Days above Twelve Weeks and much above what the Act required  Then were we sent for to the Justices House and the rest being Released  Morgan Watkins  and I were required to find Sureties for our Appearance at the next  Assize  which we refusing to do were committed anew to our old Prison the  House of Correction  at  Wiccomb  there to lie until the next  Assizes Morgan  being in this second  Mittimus  represented as a  Notorious Offender in Preaching  and I as being upon the  second Conviction in order to Banishment  There we ay till the Five and Twentieth Day of the same Month and then by the Favour of the Earl of  Ancram  being brought before him at his House we were discharged from the Prison upon our Promise to appear if at Liberty and in Health at the  Assizes  Which we did and were there discharged by Proclamation  During my Imprisonment in this Prison I betook my self for an Imployment to making of Nets for KitchinService to boil Herbs  c  in which Trade I learned of  Morgan Watkins  and Selling some and Giving others I pretty well stocked the Friends of that Country with them  Though in that Confinement I was not very well suited with Company for Conversation  Morgan  's natural Temper not being very agreeable to mine yet we kept a fair and Brotherly Correspondence as became Friends Prisonfellows and Bedfellows which we were And indeed it was a good Time I think to us all for I found it so to me the Lord being graciously pleased to visit my Soul with the refreshing Dews of his divine Life whereby my Spirit was more and more quickned to him and Truth gained ground in me over the Temptations and Snares of the Enemy Which frequently raised in my Heart Thanksgivings and Praises unto the LORD And at one time more especially the Sense I had of the Prosperity of Truth and the spreading thereof filling my Heart with abundant Joy made my Cup overflow and the following Lines drop out  For  Truth  I suffer Bonds in  Truth  I live  And unto Truth this Testimony give  That  TRUTH shall over all Exalted be  And in Dominion Reign for evermore  The Child's already born that this may see  Honour Praise Glory be to God therefore  And underneath thus  Tho' Death and Hell should against  Truth  combine  It's Glory shall through all their Darkness shine  This I saw with an Eye of Faith beyond the reach of Humane Sense For  As strong Desire  Draws Objects nigher  In Apprehension than indeed they are  I with an Eye  That pierced high  Did thus of  Truth  's Prosperity declare  After we had been discharged at the  Assizes  I returned to  Isaac Penington  's Family at  Bottrel  's in  Chalfont  and as I remember  Morgan Watkins  with me leaving  Isaac Penington  a Prisoner in  Alesbury  Goal  The Lodgings we had in this FarmHouse  Bottrel  's proving too strait and inconvenient for the Family I took larger and better Lodgings for them in  BerrieHouse  at  Amersham  whither we went at the time called  Michaelmas  having spent the Summer at the other Place  Some time after was that memorable Meeting appointed to be holden at  London  through a divine Opening in the Motion of Life in that eminent Servant and Prophet of God  George Fox  for the Restoring and bringing in again those who had gone out from Truth and the Holy Unity of Friends therein by the Means and Ministry of  John Perrot  This Man came pretty early amongst  Friends  and too early took upon him the Ministerial Office and being though little in Person yet great in Opinion of himself nothing less would serve him than to go and Convert the POPE In order whereunto he having a better Man than himself  John Luff  to accompany him travelled to  Rome  where they had not been long e're they were taken up and clap't into Prison  Luff  as I remember was put in the  Inquisition  and  Perrot  in their  Bedlam  or Hospital for Madmen  Luff  died in Prison not without wellgrounded Suspicion of being Murthered there but  Perrot  lay there some time and now and then sent over an Epistle to be Printed here written in such an affected and phantastick Stile as might have induced an indifferent Reader to believe they had suited the place of his Confinement to his Condition  After some time through the Mediation of Friends who hoped better of him than he proved with some Person of Note and Interest there he was released and came back for  England  And the Report of his great Sufferings there far greater in Report than in Reality joined with a singular Shew of Sanctity so far opened the Hearts of many tender and compassionate Friends towards him that it gave  im the Advantage of insinuating himself in  o their Affections and Esteem and made way  or the more ready Propagation of that peculiar Error of his of  Keeping on the Hat in time of Prayer as well publick as private unless they had  immediate Motion at that time to put if off  Now although I had not the least Acquaint  nce with this Man not having ever exchanged  Word with him though I knew him by  ight nor had I any Esteem of him for either  is Natural Parts or Ministerial Gift but ra  her a Dislike of his Aspect Preaching and way of Writing yet this Error of his being  roached in the Time of my Infancy and Weakness of Judgment as to Truth while I  ived privately in  London  and had little Converse with Friends I amongst the many who were catch't in that Snare was taken with the Notion as what then seemed to my weak Understanding suitable to the Doctrine of a Spiritual Dispensation And the Matter com  ng to warm Debates both in Words and Wri  ing I in a misguided Zeal was ready to have entred the Lists of Contention about it not then seeing what Spirit it proceeded from and was managed by nor forseeing the Disorder and Confusion in Worship which must naturally attend it  But as I had no evil Intention or sinister End in engaging in it but was simply betrayed by the specious Pretence and Shew of greater Spirituality the Lord in tender Compassion to my Soul was graciously pleased to open my  Understanding and give me a clear Sight of the Enemies Design in this Work and drew me off from the Practice of it and to bear Testimony against it as Occasion offered  But when that solemn Meeting was appointed at  London  for a Travel in Spirit on behalf of those who had thus gone out that they might rightly return and be sensibly received into the Unity of the Body again My Spirit rejoyced and with Gladness of Heart I went to it as did many more of both City and Country and with great Simplicity and Humility of Mind did honestly and openly Acknowledge our Outgoing and take Condemnation and Shame to our selves And some that lived at too remote a Distance in this Nation as well as beyond the Seas upon Notice given of that Meeting and the intended Service of it  did the like by Writing in Letters directed to and openly read in the Meeting which for that Purpose was continued many Days  Thus in the Motion of Life were the healing Waters stirred and many through the Virtuous Power thereof restored to Soundness  and indeed not many lost And though most of these who thus returned were such as with my self had before renounced the Error  and forsaken the Practice yet did we sensibly find that Forsaking without Confessing in Case of publick Scandal was not sufficient  but that an open Acknowledgment of ope  Offences as well as Forsaking them was ne+cessary to the obtaining compleat Remission  Not long after this  G F  was moved of the Lord to Travel through the Countries from County to County to Advise and Encourage Friends to set up  Monthly  and  Quarterly Meetings  for the better ordering the Affairs of the Church in taking Care of the Poor and Exercising a true GospelDiscipline for a due Dealing with any that might walk disorderly under our Name and to see that such as should Marry among us did act fairly and clearly in  hat respect  When he came into this County I was one  f the many Friends that were with him at  he Meeting for that Purpose And afterwards  travelled with  Guli  and her Maid into the West of  England  to meet him there and to visit Friends in those Parts and we went as  ar as  Topsham  in  Devonshire  before we found  im He had been in  Cornwall  and was then  eturning and came in unexpectedly at  Top  ham  where we then were providing if he  ad not then come thither to have gone that Day towards  Cornwall  But after he was come  o us we turned back with him through  De  onshire Somersetshire  and  Dorsetshire  having  enerally very good Meetings where he was  nd the Work he was chiefly concerned in went on very prosperously and well without  y Opposition or Dislike save that in the General Meeting of Friends in  Dorsetshire  a  uarrelsom Man who had gone out from  riends in  John Perrot  's Business and had not  ome rightly in again but continued in the  Practice of keeping on his Hat in time of Prayer to the great Trouble and Offence of Friends began to Cavil and raise Disputes which occasioned some Interruption and Disturbance  Not only  George  and  Alexander Parker  who was with him but divers of the Ancient Friends of that Country endeavoured to quiet that troublesom Man and make him sensible of his Error but his unruly Spirit would still be Opposing what was said unto him and justifying himself in that Practice This brought a great Weight and Exercise upon me who sate at a Distance in the outward Part of the Meeting and after I had for some time bore the Burthen thereof I stood up in the constraining Power of the LORD and in great Tenderness of Spirit declared unto the Meeting and to that Person more particularly how it had been with me in that respect how I had been betrayed into that wrong Practice how strong I had been therein and how the Lord had been graciously pleased to shew me the Evil thereof and recover me out of it  This coming unexpectedly from me a young Man a Stranger and one who had not intermedled with the Business of the Meeting had that Effect upon the Caviller that if it did not satisfie him it did at least silence him and made him for the Present sink down and be still without giving any further Disturbance to the Meeting And the Friends were well pleased with this unlooked for Testimony from me  and I was glad that I had that Opportunity to Confess to the Truth and to Acknowledge once more in so publick a manner the Mercy and Goodness of the Lord to me therein  By the time we came back from this Journey the Summer was pretty far gone and the following Winter I spent with the Children of the Family as before without any remarkable Alteration in my Circumstances until the next Spring when I found in my self a Disposition of Mind to change my Single Life for a Married State  I had always entertained so high a Regard for Marriage as it was a Divine Institution that I held it not lawful to make it a sort of political Trade to rise in the World by And therefore as I could not but in my Judgment blame such as I found made it their Business to Hunt after and endeavour to gain those who were accounted great  Fortunes  not so much regarding  What she is  as  what she has  but making Wealth the chief if not the only thing they Aimed at so I resolved to avoid in my own Practice that Course and how much soever my Condition might have prompted me as well as others to seek Advantage that way never to engage on the Account of  Riches  nor at all to Marry till judicious Affection drew me to it which I now began to feel at Work in my Breast  The Object of this Affection was a Friend whose Name was  Mary Ellis  whom for divers Years I had had an Acquaintance with in the  way of common Friendship only and in whom I thought I then saw those fair Prints of Truth and solid Virtue which I afterwards found in a sublime Degree in her but what her Condition in the World was as to Estate I was wholly a Stranger to nor desired to know  I had once a Year or two before had an Opportunity to do her a small Piece of Service which she wanted some Assistance in wherein I acted with all Sincerity and Freedom of Mind not expecting or desiring any Advantage by her or Reward from her being very well satisfied in the Act it self that I had served a Friend and helped the Helpless  That little Intercourse of common Kindness between us Ended without the least Though I am verily perswaded on her Part wellas+sured on my own of any other or further Re+lation than that of free and fair Friendship Nor did it at that time lead us into any close Conversation or more intimate Acquaintan  one with the other than had been before  But some time and that a good while a  +ter I found my Heart secretly drawn and in+clining towards her Yet was I not hasty i  proposing but waited to feel a satisfactory Set+tlement of Mind therein before I made an  step thereto  After some time I took an Opportunity  open my Mind therein unto my much honou  +ed Friends  Isaac  and  Mary Penington  who th  stood  Parentum loco  in the Place or Stead  Parents to me They having solemnly weig  +  d  the Matter exprest their Unity therewith  nd indeed their Approbation thereof was no  mall Confirmation to me therein Yet took I  urther Deliberation often retiring in Spirit to  he Lord and Crying to him for Direction  efore I addrest my self to her At length  s I was sitting all alone waiting upon the  ord for Counsel and Guidance in this in it  lf and to me so important Affair I felt  Word sweetly rise in me as if I had heard  Voice which said  Go and Prevail  And  ith springing in my Heart with the Word  immediately arose and went nothing doubt  g  When I was come to her Lodgings which  ere about a Mile from me her Maid told  e she was in her Chamber for having been  der some Indisposition of Body which had  liged her to keep her Chamber she had not  t left it Wherefore I desired the Maid to  quaint her Mistress that I was come to give  r a Visit Whereupon I was invited to go  to her And after some little time spent in  mmon Conversation feeling my Spirit weigh  y concerned I solemnly opened my Mind un  her with respect to the particular Business  ame about which I soon perceived was a  eat Surprisal to her for she had taken in an  pprehension as others also had done that  ine Eye had been fixed elsewhere and nearer  ome  I used not many Words to her but I felt  Divine Power went along with the Words  and fixed the Matter expressed by them so fast in her Breast that as she afterwards acknowledged to me she could not shut it out  I made at that time but a short Visit For having told her I did not expect an Answer from her now but desired she would in the most solemn Manner weigh the Proposal made and in due time give me such an Answer thereunto as the Lord should give her I took my leave of her and departed leaving the Issue to the Lord  I had a Journey then at hand which I foresaw would take me up about two Weeks time Wherefore the Day before I was to set out I went to visit her again to acquaint her with my Journey and excuse my Absence not yet pressing her for an Answer but assuring her that I felt in my self an Increase of Affection to her and hoped to receive a suitable Return from her in the Lord's time to whom in the mean time I committed both her my self and the Concern between us And indeed I found at my Return that I could not have left it in a better Hand for the Lord had been my Advocate in my Absence and had so far answered all her Objections that when I came to her again she rather acquainted me with them than urged them  From that time forwards we Entertained each other with Affectionate Kindness in order to Marriage which yet we did not hasten to but went on deliberately Neither did I use those vulgar ways of Courtship by making  requent and rich Presents Not only for that my Outward Condition would not comport with the Expence But because I liked not to  btain by such Means but preferred an un  ribed Affection  While this Affair stood thus with me I had  ccasion to take another Journey into  Kent  and  ussex  Which yet I would not mention here  ut for a particular Accident which befel me  n the Way  The Occasion of this Journey was this  Mary Penington  's Daughter  Guli  intending to go to  er Uncle  Springett  's in  Sussex  and from thence  mongst her Tenants her Mother desired me  o accompany her and assist her in her Busi  ess with her  Tenants  We tarried at  London  the first Night and  et out next Morning on the  Tunbridge  Road  nd  SevenOak  lying in our way we put in here to Bait But truly we had much ado to get either Provisions or Room for our selves or our Horses the House was so filled with Guests and those not of the better Sort For the Duke of  York  being as we were told on the Road that Day for the  Wells  divers of his  Guards  and the meaner sort of his  Retinue  had near filled all the  Inns  there  I left  John Gigger  who waited on  Guli  in this Journey and was afterwards her menial Servant to take Care for the Horses while I did the like as well as I could for her I got a little Room to put her into and having shut her into it went to see what Relief the  Kitchin  would afford us and with much ado by Praying hard and Paying dear I got a smal  Joint of Meat from the Spit which served ra+ther to stay than satisfie our Stomachs for w  were all pretty sharp set  After this short Repast being weary of ou  Quarters we quickly Mounted and took th  Road again willing to hasten from a Place where we found nothing but Rudeness fo  the  Roysters  who at that time swarmed there besides the Damning Oaths they belched out a  one another looked very sowerly on us as i  they grudged us both the Horses we rode and the Cloaths we wore  A Knot of these soon followed us designing as we afterwards found to put an Abuse upon us and make themselves Sport with us We had a spot of fine smooth sandy Way whereon the Horses trod so softly that we heard them not till one of them was upon us I was then riding a Breast with  Guli  and discoursing with her when on a suddain hearing a little Noise and turning mine Eye that way I saw an Horseman coming up on the further Side of her Horse having his left Arm stretched out just ready to take her about the Waste and pluck her off backwards from her own Horse to lay her before him upon his I had but just time to thrust forth my Stick between him and her and bid him stand off and at the same time reigning my Horse to let hers go before me thrust in between her and him and being better Mounted than he my Horse  run him off But his Horse being tho' weaker than mine yet Nimble he slipt by me and got up to her on the near Side endeavouring to offer Abuse to her To prevent which I thrust in upon him again and in our Jostling we drove her Horse quite out of the Way and almost into the next Hedge  While we were thus Contending I heard a Noise of loud Laughter behind us and turning my Head that way I saw three or four Horsemen more who could scarce sit their Horses for Laughing to see the Sport their Companion made with us From thence I saw it was a Plot laid and that this rude Fel  ow was not to be dallied with Wherefore I bestirr'd my self the more to keep him off Admonishing him to take Warning in time and give over his Abusiveness lest he Repented too late He had in his Hand a short thick Truncheon which he held up at me on which laying hold with a strong Gripe I suddainly wrenched it out of his Hand and threw it at as far a Distance behind me as I could  While he rode back to fetch his Truncheon I called up honest  John Gigger  who was indeed a right honest Man and of a Temper so throughly Peaceable that he had not hitherto put in at all But now I rouzed him and bid him ride so close up to his Mistress's Horse on the further Side that no Horse might thrust in between and I would endeavour to Guard the near Side But he good Man not thinking it  perhaps decent enough for him to Ride so nea  his Mistress left room enough for another t  Ride between And indeed so soon as ou  Brute had recovered his Truncheon he cam  up directly thither and had thrust in again  had not I by a nimble turn chopt in upon him  and kept him at a Bay  I then told him I had hitherto spared him  but wish'd him not to Provoke me further This I spake with such a Tone as bespake an high Resentment of the Abuse put upon us and withal pressed so close upon him with my Horse that I suffered him not to come up any more to  Guli  This his Companions who kept an equal distance behind us both heard and saw and thereupon Two of them advancing came up to us I then thought I might likely have my Hands full but Providence turn'd it otherwise For they seeing the Contest rise so high and probably fearing it would rise higher not knowing where it might stop came in to part us Which they did by taking him away one of them leading his Horse by the Bridle and the other driving him on with his Whip and so carried him off  One of their Campany staid yet behind And it so happening that a great Shower just then fell we betook our selves for shelter to a thick and wellspread  Oak  which stood hard by Thither also came that other Person who wore the  Duke  's Livery and while we put on our defensive Garments against the Weather which  en set in to be wet he took the opportunity  discourse with me about the Man that had  een so Rude to us endeavouring to Excuse  m by alledging that  he had drunk a little too  iberally  I let him know that one Vice would  ot Excuse another That although but one of  em was actually concern'd in the Abuse yet  oth He and the rest of them were Abettors  f it and Accessaries to it that I was not Ig  orant whose Livery they wore and was well  ssured their Lord would not maintain them in  ommitting such Outrages upon Travellers on  he Road to our Injury and his Dishonour That I understood the  Duke  was coming down  nd that they might expect to be called to an Account for this rude Action  He then begg'd hard that we would pass by the Offence and make no Complaint to their Lord for he knew he said  the  Duke  would be very severe and it would be the utter Ruin of the Young Man  When he had said what he could he went off before us without any ground given him to expect Favour And when we had fitted our selves for the Weather we followed after our own Pace  When we came to  Tunbridge  I set  John Gigger  foremost bidding him lead on briskly through the Town and placing  Guli  in the middle I came close up after her that I might both Observe and Interpose if any fresh abuse should have been offered her We were expected I perceived for though it Rained very hard the Street was thronged with Men who  looked very earnestly on us but did not put  +ny affront upon us  We had a good way to Ride beyond  Tu  +bridge  and beyond the  Wells  in Byways a+mong the Woods and were the later for th  hinderance we had had on the Way An  when being come to  Harbert Springett  's Hous  Guli  acquainted her Uncle what Danger an  Trouble she had gone through on the way h  resented it so high that he would have had th  Persons been Prosecuted for it But since Provi+dence had interposed and so well Preserved an  Delivered her she chose to pass by the Offence  When  Guli  had finished the Business she wen  upon we returned home and I delivered he  safe to her glad Mother From that time forward I continued my Visits to my best beloved Friend untill we Married which was on the  th  Day of the  th  Month called  October  in the Year We took each other in a Select Meeting of the Ancient and Grave  Friends  of that Country holden in a  Friend  's House where in those times not only the Monthly Meeting for Business but the Publick Meeting for Worship was sometimes kept A very Solemn Meeting it was and in a weighty frame of Spirit we were in which we sensibly felt the Lord with us and Joyning us the sense whereof remained with us all our Life time and was of good Service and very Comfortable to us on all Occasions  My next Care after Marriage was to Secure to my Wife what Monies she had and  ith her self bestowed upon me For I held it  ould be an Abominable Crime in me and sa  ur of the highest Ingratitude if I though  t through Negligence should leave room for  y Father in case I should be taken away sud  nly to break in upon her Estate and de  ive her of any part of that which had been  d ought to be her own Wherefore with the  st opportunity as I remember the very next  y and before I knew particularly what she  d I made my  Will  and thereby secured to  r whatever I was Possessed of as well all that  hich she brought either in Monies or in  oods as that little which I had before I Mar  ed her Which indeed was but little yet  ore by all that Little than I had ever gi  en her Ground to expect with me  She had indeed been Advised by some of her  elations to secure before Marriage some part  t least of what she had to be at her own  isposal Which though perhaps not wholly  ree from some Tincture of SelfInterest in the Proposer was not in it self the worst of Counsel But the worthyness of her Mind  nd the sense of the Ground on which she re  eived me would not suffer her to entertain any  uspicion of me And this laid on me the greater Obligation in point of Gratitude as well as of Justice to Regard and Secure her which I did  I omitted in its proper place because I would not break in upon the Discourse I was then upon to insert a few Lines which I writ as a Congratulation to an Honoured  Friend  upon  his Marriage and presented him with the ne  Morning thus  MY Heart's affected with a weighty Se  Of Yesterdays Proceedings and fr  thence  Desire arises to CONGRATULATE  My happy  Friend  in his New Married State  Not in that strain wherewith some use to Cl  Mens Ears with tedious Peals of giving Joy  But shunning all Extreams I chuse to tread  The Middle Path which doth to  Vertue  lead  This then my Heart desires for thee my  Frie  Thy  Nuptial  Joys may never here have End  May  Happiness  with thee take up her Rest  And sweet  Contentment  always fill thy Breast  May GOD thee bless with numerous Increase  And may thy utmost Offspring rest in Peace  Accept this Pledge of Love tho' but a Pa  Of what is Treasur'd for thee in my Heart  From him who herein hath no other End  Than to declare himself  Thy faithful Friend T E  Stepney  th d  Month    I had not been long Married before I was  licited by my dear Friends  Isaac  and  Mary  enington  and her Daughter  Guli  to take a  ourney into  Kent  and  Sussex  to Accompt with  eir Tenants and overlook their Estates in  ose Countries which before I was Married  had had the Care of and accordingly the  ourney I undertook though in the depth of Winter  My Travels into those Parts were the more  ksome to me from the Solitariness I underwent and want of suitable Society For my Business lying among the Tenants who were a  ustick sort of People of various Perswasions  nd Humours but not  Friends  I had little Op  ortunity of Conversing with  Friends  though  contrived to be with them as much as I could  specially on the First Day of the Week  But that which made my present Journey more heavy to me was a sorrowful Exercise which was newly fallen upon me from my Fa  her harder to be born than any I had ever met with before  He had upon my first acquainting him with my Inclination to Marry and to whom not only very much approved the Match and vountarily offered without my either asking or expecting to give me a hansome Portion at present with Assurance of an Addition to it hereafter And he not only made this Offer to me in private but came down from  London  into the Country on purpose to be better acquainted with my Friend and did there make the  same Proposal to her offering also to give Se  +rity to any Friend or Relation of hers for t  Performance Which Offer she most generou  declined leaving him as free as she found hi  But after we were Married notwithstan  +ing such his Promise he wholly declined t  Performance of it under Pretence of our n  being Married by the  Priest  and  Liturgy  Th  Usage and Evil Treatment of us thereupo  was a great Trouble to me and when I ende  +voured to Soften him in the matter he forbi  me speaking to him of it any more and remo  +ed his Lodging that I might not find him  The Grief I conceived on this Occasion wa  not for any Disappointment to my self or to m  Wife for neither she nor I had any strict  necessary Dependence upon that Promise bu  my Grief was partly for the Cause assigned b  him as the Ground of it which was  That o  Marriage was not by  Priest  or  Liturgy and part  for that his lower Circumstances in the World might probably tempt him to find some such though Unwarrantable Excuse to avoid per+forming his Promise  And surely hard would it have been for m  Spirit to have born up under the weight of thi  Exercise had not the LORD been exceedin  gracious to me and supported me with the In+flowings of his Love and Life wherewith h  visited my Soul in my Travel The Sens  whereof raised in my Heart a thankful Remem+brance of his manifold Kindnesses in his for+mer Dealings with me And in the Evening  hen I came to my Inn while Supper was get  ng ready I took my Pen and put into Words  hat had in the Day revolved in my Thoughts  nd thus

of the Summer fo  +lowing I went into  Kent  again and in  Passage through  London  received the unwe  +come News of the Loss of a very hopeful Yout  who had formerly been under my Care for Ed

general and  equious Carriage towards him in particular  very much wrought himself into his Favour  As for me I thought it one of the sharpest  okes I had met with sor I both loved the  ild very well and had conceived great hopes  general Good from him and it pierced me  deeper to think how deeply it would pierce  afflicted Parents  Sorrow for this Disaster was my Compani  in this Journey and I travelled the Roads  +der great Exercise of Mind revolving in  Thoughts the manifold Accidents which  LIFE of Man  was attended with and sub  to and the great  Uncertainty of all Hum  Things  I could find no Center no firm B  for the  Mind of Man  to fix upon but the  Div  Power  and  Will  of the  Almighty  This Consid  +ation wrought in my Spirit a sort of Conte  of what supposed  Happiness  or

Domino Mens nixa quieta est  The Mind which upon God is stay'd  Shall with no Trouble be dismay'd  T E  Kent    bris    to    A Copy of the foregoing Lines inclosed in a Letter of  Condoleance  I sent by the first Post into  Buckinghamshire  to my dear Friends the afflicted Parents And upon my Return home going to visit them we sate down and solemnly mixed our Sorrows and Tears together  About this time as I remember it was that some Bickerings happening between some  Baptists  and some of the People called  Quakers  in or about  HighWiccomb  in  Buckinghamshire  occasioned by some reflecting Words a  Baptist  Preacher had publickly uttered in one of their Meetings there against the  Quakers  in general and  W Penn  in particular it came at length to this Issue that a Meeting for a publick Dispute was appointed to be holden at  WestWiccomb  between  Jeremy Ives  who espoused his Brother's Cause and  W Penn  To this Meeting it being so near me I went rather to Countenance the Cause than for any Delight I took in such Work for indeed I have rarely found the Advantage equivolent to the  Trouble and Danger arising from those Contests For which Cause I would not chuse them as being justly engaged I would not refuse them  The Issue of this proved better than I expected For  Ives  having undertaken an Ill Cause to argue against the  Divine Light  and  Universal Grace conferr'd by God on all Men  when he had spent his Stock of Arguments which he brought with him on that Subject finding his Work go on heavily and the Auditory not well satisfied stept down from his Seat and departed with purpose to have broken up the Assembly But except some few of his Party who followed him the People generally stay'd and were the more attentive to what was afterwards delivered amongst them Which  Ives  understanding came in again and in an angry railing Manner expressing his Dislike that we went not all away when he did gave more Disgust to the People  After the Meeting was ended I sent to my Friend  I P  by his Son and Servant who returned Home though it was late that Evening a short Account of the Business in the following  Distich  Praevaluit  VERITAS  Inimici Terga dedêre  Nos sumus in tuto Laus tribuenda Deo  Which may be thus Englished  Truth  hath prevail'd the Enemies did fly  We are in Safety Praise to God on high  But both they and we had quickly other Work found us It soon became a stormy time The Clouds had been long gathering and threatned a Tempest The Parliament had sate some time before and hatched that unaccountable Law which was called  The Conventicle Act  If that may be allowed to be called a Law by whomsoever made which was so directly contrary to the Fundamental Laws of  England  to common Justice Equity and right Reason as this manifestly was For    st  It brake down and overrun the Bounds and Banks anciently set for the Defence and Security of  Englishmens  Lives Liberties and Properties  viz Tryal by Juries  Instead thereof directing and authorizing Justices of the Peace and that too privately out of  Sessions  to Convict Fine and by their Warrants Distrein upon Offendors against it directly contrary to the  Great Charter  By that Act the Informers who Swear for their own Advantage as being thereby entituled to a Third Part of the Fines were many times concealed driving on an underhand private Trade so that Men might be and often were Convicted and Fined without having any Notice or Knowledge of it till the Officers came and took away their Goods nor even then could they tell by whose Evidence they were convicted Than which what could be more opposite to common Justice which requires that every Man should be openly charged and have his Accuser Face to Face that he might  both Answer for himself before he be convicted and object to the Validity of the Evidence given against him  By that Act the Innocent were punished for the Offences of the Guilty If the Wife or Child was convicted of having been at one of those Assemblies which by that Act was adjudged Unlawful the Fine was levied on the Goods of the Husband or Father of such Wife or Child though he was neither present at such Assembly nor was of the same Religious Perswasion that they were of but perhaps an Enemy to it  It was left in the arbitrary Pleasure of the Justices to lay half the Fine for the House or Ground where such Assembly was holden and half the Fine for a pretended unknown Preacher and the whole Fines of such and so many of the Meeters as they should account Poor upon any other or others of the People who were present at the same Meeting not exceeding a certain limitted Sum without any regard to Equity or Reason And yet such Blindness doth the  Spirit of Persecution  bring on Men otherwise sharp sighted enough that this Unlawful Unjust Unequal Unreasonable and Unrighteous Law took place in almost all Places and was vigorously prosecuted against the Meetings of  Dissenters  in general though the Brunt of the Storm fell most sharply on the People called  Quakers  not that it seemed to be more particularly levelled at them but that they stood more fair steady and open as a But to receive all the  Shot that came while some others found means  nd freedom to retire to Coverts for Shelter  No sooner had the Bishops obtained this Law for suppressing all other Meetings but their own but some of the Clergy of most Ranks and some others too who were overmuch bigotted to that Party bestirr'd themselves with might and main to find out and Encourage the most profligate Wretches to turn Informers and to get such Persons into Parochial Offices as would be most obsequious to their Commands and ready at their Beck to put it into the most rigorous Execution Yet it took not alike in all Places but some were forwarder in the Work than others according as the Agents intended to be chiefly imployed therein had been predisposed thereunto  For in some Parts of the Nation care had been timely taken by some not of the lowest Rank to chuse out some particular Persons Men of sharp Wit close Countenances pliant Tempers and deep Dissimulation and send them forth among the  Sectaries  so called with Instructions to thrust themselves into all Societies Conform to all or any sort of Religious Profession  Proteous  like change their Shapes and transform themselves from one Religious Appearance to another as occasion should require In a word To be all things to all not that they might win some but that they might if possible ruin all at least many  The Drift of this Design was That they who imployed them might by this means get a full  Account what Number of  Dissenters Meetings  of every sort there were in each County and where kept what Number of Persons frequent+ed them and of what Ranks who amongst them were Persons of Estate and where they lived that when they should afterwards have troubled the Waters they might the better know where with most Advantage to cast their Nets  He of these Emisaries whose Post was assigned him in this County of  Bucks  adventured to thrust himself upon a  Friend  under the counterfeit Appearance of a  Quaker  but being by the Friend suspected and thereupon dismist unentertain'd he was forced to betake himself to an Inn or Alehouse for Accommodation Long he had not been there e're his unruly Nature not to be long kept under by the Curb of a feigned Sobriety broke forth into open Prophanness so true is that of the POET  Naturam expellas furcâ licèt us{que} recurret  To Fudling now falls he with those whom he found Tippling there before and who but he amo  gst them In him was then made good the Proverb  In Vino Veritas  for in his Cups he out with that which was no doubt to have been kept a Secret 'Twas to his PotCompanions that after his Head was somewhat heated with strong Liquors he discovered that he was sent forth by Dr  Mew  the then ViceChancellor of  Oxford  on the Design before related and under the Protection of Justice  Morton  a  Warrant under whose Hand and Seal he there produced  Sensible of his Error too late when Sleep had restored him to some degree of Sense and discouraged with this ill Success of his Attempt upon the  Quakers  he quickly left that Place and crossing through the Country cast himself among the  Baptists  at a Meeting which they held in a private Place of which the overeasie Credulity of some that went among them whom he had craftily insinuated himself into had given him Notice The Entertainment he found amongst them deserved a better Return than he made them For having smoothly wrought himself into their good Opinion and cunningly drawn some of them into an unwary Openness and Freedom of Conversation with him upon the unpleasing Subject of the Severity of those Times he most villanously impeached one of them whose Name was  Headach  a Man well reputed amongst his Neighbours of having spoken  Treasonable Words  and thereby brought the Man in danger of losing both his Estate and Life had not a seasonable Discovery of his abominable Practices elsewhere imprinting Terror the Effect of Guilt upon him caused him to fly both out of the Court and Country at that very instant of Time when the honest Man stood at the Bar ready to be arraigned upon his false Accusation  This his false Charge against that  Baptist  left him no further room to play the Hypocrite in those Parts Off therefore go his Cloak and  Vizor And now he openly appears in his pro+per Colours to disturb the Assemblies of God's People which was indeed the very End for which the Design at first was laid  But because the Law provided  That a Con+viction must be grounded upon the Oaths of two Witnesses  it was needful for him in order to the carrying on his intended Mischief to find out an Associate who might be both sordid enough for such an Imployment and vicious enough to be his Companion  This was not an easie Task yet he found out one who had already given an Experiment of his Readiness to take other Mens Goods being not long before released out of  Alesbury  Goal where he very narrowly escaped the Gallows for having Stolen a Cow  The Names of these Fellows being yet unknown in that Part of the Country where they began their Work the former by the general Voice of the Country was called  The Trepan  the latter  The Informer  and from the Colour of his Hair  Redhead  But in a little time the  Trepan  called himself  John Poulter  adding withal That Judge  Morton  used to call him  John for the King  and that the A B of  Canterbury  had given him a  Deaconry  That his Name was indeed  John Poulter  the reputed Son of one  Poulter  a Butcher in  Salisbury  and that he had long since been there branded for a Fellow egregiously Wicked and Debauched we were assured by the Testimony of a young Man then living in  Amersham  who both was his Countryman  and had known him in  Salisbury  as well  s by a Letter from an Inhabitant of that Place  o whom his Course of Life had been well known  His Comrade who for some time was only  alled  The Informer  was named  Ralph Lacy  of  Risborough  and Sirnamed the  Cowstealer  These agreed between themselves where to  ake their first Onset which was to be and was  n the Meeting of the People called  Quakers  hen holden at the House of  William Russell  cal  ed  Jourden's  in the Parish of  GilesChalfont  in  he County of  Bucks  that which was wanting  o their Accommodation was a Place of Har  our fit for such Beasts of Prey to lurk in for Assistance wherein Recourse was had to Parson

time  he lived at a Farm called  Whites  a Byplace in  he Parish of  Beconsfield  whither she removed  rom  Hitchindon  To her these Fellows were  ecommended by her old Friend the Parson  he with all readiness received them Her  ouse was at all times open to them what she  ad was at their Command  Two Sons she had at home with her both at Man's Estate to the Eldest of which her Maid  ervant not

Incontinency o  his lustful Brother had misspent listed himsel  in the Service of his Mothers New Guests t  attend on them as their Guide and to inform them who were too much Strangers to pretend to

the  appeared openly and began to Act their i  +tended Tragoedy upon the  Quakers  Meeting a  the Place aforesaid to which I belonged an  at which I was present Here the chief Acto  Poulter  behaved himself with such impetuo  Violence and brutish Rudeness as gave Occ+sion for Enquiry who or what he was An  being soon discovered to be the  Trepan  so Inf  +mous and abhor'd by all sober People and

Reader may make  dgment of him as of the Lion by his Paw  at at the Sessions holden at  Wiccomb  in  Octo  r  then last past he was openly accused of  ving enticed one  Harding  of the same Town  be his Companion and Associate in Robbing  the Highway and Proof offered to be made  at he had made Bullets in order to that Ser  e Which Charge  Harding  himself whom  had endeavoured to draw into that hainous  ickedness was ready in Court to prove upon  th had not the Prosecution been discounten  ced and smothered  Lacy  the Cowstealer having thus got  Aris  e intended Highwayman to be his Com  de they came on the st of the Month cal  August  to the Meeting of the People  led  Quakers  where  Lacy  with  Poulter  had  en a Month before and taking for granted  at the same who had been there before were  ere then they went to a Justice of the Peace  led Sir  Thomas Clayton  and Swore at all ad  nture against one  Thomas Zachary  and his  ife whom  Lacy  understood to have been there  e Month before that they were then present  that Meeting Whereas neither the said  Tho  s Zachary  nor his Wife were at that Meeting  t were both of them at  London  above Twen  Miles distant all that Day having been  there sometime before and after Which no  +withstanding upon this false Oath of these fal  Men the Justice laid Fines upon the said  Thom  Zachary  of  l  for his own Offence  l  f  his Wife's and  l  for the Offence of a pr  tended Preacher though indeed there was n  any that preached at that Meeting that Day  and issued forth his Warrant to the Officers  Beconsfield  where  Thomas Zachary  dwelt for t  levying of the same upon his Goods  I mention these things thus particularly t  not an immediate Suffering of my own  +cause in the Consequence thereof it occasio  no small Trouble and Exercise to me  For when  Thomas Zachary  returning H  from  London  understanding what had been  against him and advising what to do was  formed by a Neighbouring  Attorney  that his  +medy lay in appealing from the Judgmen  the Convicting Justice to the  General Qu  Sessions  of the Peace he thereupon ordering  said  Attorney  to draw up his Appeal in For  Law went himself with it and tendered  the Justice But the Justice being a Man ne  well principled nor well natured and u  that he should lose the Advantage both of  present Conviction and future Service of  in his Judgment useful Men as those bold Informers were likely to be fell sh  upon  Thomas Zachary  charging him that h  +fer'd justly and that his Suffering was  a Religious Account  This rough and unjust Dealing engaged the  od Man to enter into further Discourse with  e Justice in defence of his own Innocency  om which Discourse the insidious Justice tak  g offence at some Expression of his charged  with saying  The Righteous are Oppressed and  Wicked go Unpunished  Which the Justice in  preting to be a Reflection on the Govern  nt and calling it an  high Misdemeanour  re  ired Sureties of the good Man to answer it at  e next  Quarter Sessions  and in the mean time  be bound to his good Behaviour But he  ll knowing himself to be Innocent of having  ken any Law or done in this Matter any E  could not answer the Justices Unjust De  nd and therefore was sent forthwith a Pri  er to the County Goal  By this Severity it was thought the Justice  igned not only to wreak his Displeasure on  good Man but to prevent the further Pro  ution of his Appeal Whereby he should at  e both Oppress the Righteous by the Levy  of the Fines unduly imposed upon him  d secure the informers from a Conviction of  ful  Perjury and the Punishment due there  e that so they might go on without Controul  he wicked Work they were engaged in  But so great Wickedness was not to be suffer  to go unpunished or at least undiscovered  herefore although no way could be found at  sent to get the good Man released from his  ust Imprisonment Yet that his Restraint  ght not hinder the Prosecution of his Appeal  on which the Detection of the Informers V  +lany depended Consideration being had the  of amongst some Friends the  Management the Prosecution was committed to my Care w  was thought with respect at least to Leisu  and disengagement from other Business most  to attend it and very willingly I undertook  Wherefore at the next general  QuarterSessi  of the Peace holden at  HighWiccomb  in  Oct  +ber  following I took care that Four Substant  Witnesses Citizens of unquestionable Cred  should come down from  London  in a Coa  and four Horses hired on purpose  These gave so punctual and full Eviden  that  Thomas Zachary  and his Wife were in  Lond  all that Day whereon the Informers had Sw  them to have been at an Unlawful Meeting a  place more than Twenty Miles distant fr  London  that notwithstanding what Endeavo  were used to the contrary the Jury found th  Not Guilty  Whereupon the Money deposi  for the Fines at the Entring of the Appe  ought to have been returned and so was T  Pounds of it but the rest of the Money bei  in the Hand of the Clerk of the Peace wh  Name was  Wells  could never be got out aga  Thomas Zachary  himself was brought fro  Alesbury  Goal to  Wiccomb  to receive his Trya  and though no Evil could be charged upon hi  yet Justice  Clayton  who at first committed hi  displeased to see the Appeal Prosecuted and  Conviction he had made set aside by Imp  +tunity prevailed with the Bench to rema  im to Prison again there to lie until another  essions  While this was doing I got an Indictment  rawn up against the Informers  Aris  and  Lacy  or wilful Perjury and caused it to be delivered  o the Grand Jury who found the Bill And  lthough the Court adjourned from the Town Hall to the Chamber at their Inn in favour as  t was thought to the Informers on Supposition we would not pursue them thither yet thither  hey were pursued and there being two Coun  ells present from  Windsor  the Name of the one was  Starkey  and of the other as I remember  Forster  the former of which I had before retained upon the Tryal of the Appeal I now retained them both and sent them into Court again to Prosecute the Informers upon this Indictment Which they did so smartly that the Informers being present as not suspecting any such suddain Danger were of necessity called to the Bar and Arraigned and having pleaded  Not Guilty  were forced to enter a Traverse to avoid a present Commitment All the Favour the Court could shew them being to take them Bail one for the other though probably both not worth a Groat else they must have gone to Goal for want of Bail which would have put them besides their Business spoil'd the Informing Trade and broke the Design whereas now they were turned loose again to do what Mischief they could until the next Sessions  Accordingly they did what they could and yet could make little or no Earnings at it For  this little step of Prosecution had made them so known and their late apparent Perjury had made them so detestable that even the common sort of bad Men shunned them and would not willingly yield them any Assistance  The next QuarterSessions was holden at  Alesbury  whither we were fain to bring down our Witnesses again from  London  in like manner and at like Charge at the least as before And though I met with great Discouragements in the Prosecution yet I followed it so vigorously that I got a Verdict against the Informers for  wilful  Perjury and had forthwith taken them up had not they forthwith fled from Justice and hid themselves However I moved by my  Attorney  for an Order of Court directed to all  Mayors Bayliffs High Constables Petty Constables  and other Inferiour Officers of the Peace to Arrest and take them up whereever they should be found within the County of  Bucks  and bring them to the County Goal  The Report of this so terrified them that of all things dreading the Misery of lying in a Goa  out of which they could not hope for Deliver+ance otherwise than by at least the Loss o  their Ears they hopeless now of carrying o  their Informing Trade disjoyned and one o  them  Aris  fled the Country So that what+ever Gallows caught him he appeared no mo  in this Country The other  Lacy  lurked pri+vily for a while in Woods and Byplaces 'ti  Hunger and Want forced him out and the  casting himself upon an hazardous Adventu  which yet was the best and proved to him the  est Course he could have taken he went di  ectly to the Goal where he knew the Inno  ent Man suffered Imprisonment by his Means  nd for his sake where asking for and being  rought to  Thomas Zachary  he cast himself on  is Knees at his Feet and with appearance of  orrow confessing his Fault did so earnestly beg  or Forgiveness that he wrought upon the ten  er Nature of that very good Man not only to  ut him in hopes of Mercy but to be his Advo  ate by Letter to me to mitigate at least if  ot wholly to remit the Prosecution To which I so far only consented as to let him know I would suspend the Execution of the Warrant upon him according as he behaved himself or until he gave fresh Provocation At which Message the Fellow was so overjoyed that relying with Confidence thereon he returned openly to his Family and Labour and applyed himself to Business as his Neighbours observed and reported with greater Diligence and Industry than he had ever done before  Thus began and thus ended the InformingTrade in these Parts of the County of  Bucks  the ill Success that these first Informers found discouraging all others how Vile soever from attempting the like Enterprize there ever after And though it cost some Money to carry on the Prosecution and some Pains too Yet for every Shilling so spent a Pound probably might be saved of what in all likelihood would have been lost by the Spoil and Havock that might  have been made by Distresses taken on the  Informations  But so Angry was the Convicting Justi  whatever others of the same Rank were a  this Prosecution and the loss thereby of the Se  +vice of those  Honest Men  the  Perjur'd Informer  For as I heard an  Attorney  one  Hitchcock  of  A+lesbury  who was their Advocate in Court sa  A great Lord a Peer of the Realm called them  in a Letter directed to him whereby he recommend+ed to him the Care and Defence of them and thei  Cause  that he prevailed to have the Oath o  Allegiance  tendred in Court to  Thomas Zachary  which he knew he would not take because h  could not take any Oath at all by which Sna  he was kept in Prison a long time after and  far as I remember until a general Pardon r  +leased him  But though it pleased the Divine Providenc  which sometimes vouchsafeth to bring Goo  out of Evil to put a stop in a great Measur  at least to the Prosecution here begun Yet i  other Parts both of the City and Country  was carried on with very great Severity and R  +gour the worst of Men for the most part b  +ing set up for  Informers  the worst of Mag  +strates encouraging and abetting them and th  worst of the Priests who first began to blo the Fire now seeing how it took spread an  blazed Clapping their Hands and Hallowin  them on to this Evil Work  The Sense whereof as it deeply affected m  Heart with a Sympathizing Pity for the Oppre  +sed  Sufferers So it raised in my Spirit an Holy Disdain and Contempt of that Spirit and its Agent by which this ungodly Work was stirred up and carried on Which at length brake forth in an Expostulatory POEM under the Title of  GIGANTOMACHIA The Wars of the Giants against Heaven  Not without some Allusion to the Second  Psalm  thus  WHY do the Heathen in a brutish Rage  Themselves against the Lord of Hosts Engage  Why do the frantick People entertain  Their Thoughts upon a thing that is so vain  Why do the Kings themselves together set  And why do all the Princes them abet  Why do the Rulers to each other speak  After this foolish manner  Let us break  Their Bonds asunder Come let us make hast  With joint Consent their Cords from us cast  Why do they thus joyn Hands and Counsel take  Against the  Lord's Anointed  This will make  Him doubtless Laugh who doth in Heaven Sit  The  Lord  will have them in Contempt for it  His sore Displeasure on them he will wreak  And in his Wrath will he unto them Speak  For on his Holy Hill of  Sion  He  His King hath set to Reign  Scepters  must be  Cast down before him  Diadems  must lie  At foot of him who sits in Majesty  Upon his Throne of Glory whence he will  Send forth his fiery Ministers to Kill  All those his Enemies who would not be  Subject to his Supream Authority  Where

Affront  wou'd bear  From any of his Subjects shou'd they dare  So to encroach on his Prerogative  Which of them wou'd permit that Man to  live  What shou'd it be adjudg'd but  Treason  And  Death he

could not forbear to celebrate his Praises  the following Lines under the Title of  A SONG of the Mercies and Deliverances of the LORD  HAD not the Lord been on our Side  May  Israel  now say  We were not able to abide  The Tryals of that Day  When Men did up against us rise  With Fury Rage and Spight  Hoping to catch us by surprize  Or run us down by Might  Then had not God for us arose  And shewn his mighty Pow'r  We had been swallow'd by our Foes  Who waited to devour  When the jointPow'rs of Death and Hell  Against us did combine  And with united Forces fell  Upon us with design  To Root us out then had not God  Appear'd to take our Part  And them chastized with his Rod  And made them feel the Smart  We then had overwhelmed been  And trodden in the Mire  Our Enemies on us had seen  Their cruel Hearts Desire  When  Ston'd  when  Stock't  when rudely  stript  Some to the Waste have been  Without regard of Sex and whip't  Until the Blood did spin  Yea when their  Skins  with  Stripes look't black  Their Flesh to Jelly beat  Enough to make their Sinews crack  The Lashes were so great  Then had not God been with them to  Support them they had dy'd  His Pow'r it was that bore them thro'  Nothing cou'd do't beside  When into Prisons we were throng'd  Where  Pestilence  was rife  By bloodyminded Men that long'd  To take away our Life  Then had not God been with us we  Had perish't there no doubt  'Twas He preserv'd us there and He  It was that brought us out  When Sentenced to Banishment  Inhumanly we were  To be from Native Country sent  From all that Men call  dear  Then had not God been pleas'd t' appear  And take our Cause in hand  And struck them with a pannick Fear  Which put them to a stand  Nay had he not great Judgments sent  And compass'd them about  They were at that time fully bent  To root us wholly out  Had he not gone with them that went  The Seas had been their Graves  Or when they came where they were sent  They had been Sold for Slaves  But God was pleased still to give  Them Favour where they came  And in his Truth they yet do live  To Praise his Holy Name  And now afresh do Men contrive  Another wicked Way  Of our Estates us to deprive  And take our Goods away  But will the Lord who to this Day  Our Part did always take  Now leave us to be made a Prey  And that too for his sake  Can any one who calls to Mind  Deliverances past  Discourag'd be at what's behind  And murmur now at last  O that no unbelieving Heart  Among us may be found  That from the Lord wou'd now depart  And Coward like give ground  For without doubt the God we serve  Will still our Cause defend  If we from him do never swerve  But trust him to the End  What if our Goods by Violence  From us be torn and we  Of all things but our Innocence  Should wholly stripped be  Would this be more than did befal  Good  Job  Nay sure much less  He lost Estate Children and all  Yet he the Lord did bless  But did not God his Stock augment  Double what 'twas before

Storm of a  +other kind against us on this Occasion T  foregoing Storm of Persecution as it lasted lon  so in many Parts of the Nation and partic  +larly at  London  it fell very sharp and violen  especially on the  Quakers  For they having  Refuge but God alone to fly unto could n  dodge and shift to avoid the Suffering as othe  of other Denominations could and in the  worldly Wisdom and Policy did altering the  Meetings with respect both to Place and Tim  and forbearing to meet when Forbidden  kept out of their  MeetingHouses  So that of the s  +veral Sorts of Dissenters the  Quakers  only he  up a publick Testimony as a Standard or Ensig  of Religion by keeping their Meeting duly a  fully at the accustomed Times and Places  long as they were suffered to Enjoy the Use  their MeetingHouses and when they we  shut up and Friends kept out of them by Forc  ey assembled in the Streets as near to their MeetingHouses as they could  This bold and truly Christian Behaviour in  e  Quakers  disturbed and not a little displeas  the  Persecutors  who fretting complained  at the Stubborn  Quakers  brake their Strength and  e off the Blow from those other Dissenters whom  they most feared so they principally aimed at  r indeed the  Quakers  they rather despised  an feared as being a People from whose  aceable both  Principles  and  Practices  they held  emselves secure from

of a Shelter by a R  +treat behind us during the time that the Sto  lasted yet partly through an Evil Emulatio  partly through Fear lest they should lose so  of those Members of their Society who h  discovered such favourable Thoughts of o  Principles and us they set themselves as so  as the Storm was over to represent us in as ug  a Dress and in as frightful Figure to t  World as they could invent and put upon  In order whereunto one  Thomas Hicks  Preacher among the  Baptists  at  London  took u  +on him to write several Pamphlets successivel  under the Title of  A Dialogue between a Christia  and a Quaker  which were so craftily contrive  that the unwary Reader might conclude the  to be not meerly Fictions but real Discourse  actually held between one of the People called  Quaker  and some other Person In these feig  +ed Dialogues  Hicks  having no regard to Ju+stice or common Honesty had made his  Coun+terfeit Quaker  say whatsoever he thought woul  render him one while sufficiently  Erronious  another while  Ridiculous  enough forging i  the  Quaker  's Name some things so abominabl  False other Things so intolerably Foolish a  could not reasonably be supposed to have com  into the Conceit much less to have droppe  from the Lip or Pen of any that went under th  Name of a  Quaker  These  Dialogues  shall I call them or rather  iabologues  were answered by our  Friend W  enn  in two Books the first being entituled  eason against Railing  the other  The Counter  it Christian detected  in which  Hicks  being  harged with manifest as well as manifold  For  eries Perversions downright Lyes  and  Slanders  gainst the People called  Quakers  in general  W Penn G Whitehead  and divers others by Name Complaint was made by way of an  Appeal  to the  Baptists  in and about  London  for  ustice against  Thomas Hicks  Those  Baptists  who it seems were in the Plot with  Hicks  to defame at any rate right or wrong the People called  Quakers  taking the Advantage of the Absence of  W P  and  G W  who were the Persons most immediately con  erned and who were then gone a long Jour  ey on the service of Truth to be absent from the City in all probability for a considerable time appointed a publick Meeting in one of their MeetingHouses under pretence of calling  Thomas Hicks  to account and hearing the Charge made good against him but with design to give the greater Stroke to the  Quakers  when they who should make good the Charge against  Hicks  could not be present For upon their sending Notice to the Lodgings of  W P  and  G W  of their intended Meeting they were told by several  Friends  that both  W P  and  G W  were from home travelling in the Countries uncertain where and therefore could not be informed of their intended Meeting  either by Letter or Express within the time by them limitted for which reason they were desired to deferr the Meeting till they could have Notice of it and time to return that they might be at it But these  Baptists  whose Design was otherwise laid would not be prevailed with to deferr their Meeting but glad of the Advantage gave their brother  Hick  opportunity to make a colourable Defence where he had his Party to help him and none to oppose him and having made a mock Shew of Examining him and his Works of Darkness they in fine having heard one side Acquitted him  This gave just Occasion for a New Complaint and Demand of Justice against him and them For as soon as  W P  return'd to  London  he in Print exhibited his Complaint of this unfair Dealing and demanded Justice by a rehearing of the Matter in a publick Meeting to be appointed by joint Agreement This went hardly down with the  Baptists  nor could it be obtained from them without great Importunity and hard pressing At length after many delays and Tricks used to shift it off constrained by Necessity they yielded to have a Meeting at their own MeetingHouse in  Barbican London  There amongst other  Friends  was I and undertook to read our Charge there against  Thomas Hicks  which not without much Difficulty I did they inasmuch as the House was theirs putting all the Inconveniencies they could upon us  The particular Passages and Management  f this Meeting as also of that other which  ollowed soon after they refusing to give us any  ther publick Meeting we were fain to ap  oint in our own MeetingHouse by  Wheeler  treet  near  SpittleFields London  and gave  em timely notice of I forbear here to men  on there being in Print a Narrative of each  which for particular Information I refer  he Reader  But to this Meeting  Thomas Hicks  would not  ome but lodged himself at an Alehouse hard  y yet sent his Brother  Ives  with some others  f the Party by clamorous Noises to divert us  rom the Prosecution of our Charge against  im which they so effectually performed that  hey would not suffer the Charge to be heard  hough often attempted to be read  As this rude Behaviour of theirs was a Cause of Grief to me so afterwards when I understood that they used all evasive Tricks to avoid another Meeting with us and refused to do us Right my Spirit was greatly stirred at their Injustice and in the Sense thereof willing if possible to have provoked them to more fair and manly Dealing I let fly a Broadside at them in a single Sheet of Paper under the Title of  A Fresh Parsuit  In which having restated the Controversie between them and us and reinforced our Charge of Forgery  c  against  Thomas Hicks  and his Abettors I offered a fair Challenge to them not only to  Thomas Hicks  himself but to all those his Compurgators who  had before undertaken to acquit him from our Charge together with their Companion  Jer  Ives  to give me a fair and publick Meeting  in which I would make good our Charge against him as  Principal  and all the rest of them as  Accessaries  But nothing could provoke them to come fairly forth  Yet not long after finding themselves galled by the Narrative lately published of what had passed in the last Meeting near  WheelerStreet  they to help themselves if they could sent forth a Counter Account of that Meeting and of the former at  Barbican  as much to the Advantage of their own Cause as they upon deliberate Consideration cou'd contrive it This was published by  Thomas Plant  a  Baptist  Teacher and one of  Thomas Hicks  his former Compurgators and bore but falsly the Title of  A Contest for Christianity or A faithful Relation of two late Meetings  c  To this I quickly writ and published an Answer And because I saw the Design and whole drift of the  Baptists  was to shroud  T Hicks  from our Charge of  Forgery  under the specious Pretence of his and their  standing up and contending for Christianity  I gave my Book this general Title  Forgery no Christianity or a brief Examen of a late Book  c And having from their own Book plainly convicted that which they called  A faithful Relation  to be indeed  A false Relation  I in an Expostulatory  Postscript  to the  Baptists  reinforced our Charge and my former Challenge Offering to make it  ood against them before a publick and free  uditory But they were too wary to appear  rther either in Person or in Print  This was the End of that Controversie which was observed to have this Issue That what those Dialogues were written to prevent was by the Dialogues and their unfair un  anly unchristian Carriage in endeavouring  defend them hastened and brought to pass  not a few of the  Baptist  Members upon this  ccasion left their Meetings and Society and  me over to the  Quakers  Meetings and were  yned in Fellowship with them Thanks be  God  Though many of the most eminent among t  e  Baptists  in and about  London  engaged  hemselves in this Quarrel to have defended  at least to have brought fairly off if it  ad been possible their Brother  Hicks  yet the  ain Service lay upon  Jeremy Ives  Who having  een an unsuccessful Trader in  Cheese  and there  n failed more than once had now for some  ime given over that Imployment and like a Mercenary  Switzer  undertook to be the Cham  ion for the  Baptists  and to maintain their Quarrels against all Comers  His Name was up for a topping Disputant but indeed on the best Observation I could make of him both now and formerly I could not find him a clean and fair Disputant He seemed I confess well read in the  Falacies of Logick  and was indeed rather ready than true and sound in framing  Syllogisms  But his  chief Art lay in Tickling the Humours of rud  unlearned and injudicious Hearers thereby i  +sinuating himself into their good Opinion an  then Bantering his Opponent  He lived not long after this but the Impre  +sion his crafty false and frothy Carriage as we  at this time as before had made upon m  Mind drew from me when I heard of h  Death something like an  Epitaph  in a drollin  Stile as himself was wont to Use And th  it was  BEneath this Stone deprest doth lie  The Mirrour of  Hypocrisie  IVES  whose mercenary Tongue  Like a WeatherCock was hung  And did this or that way play  As  Advantage  led the way  If wellhir'd he wou'd Dispute  Otherwise he wou'd be mute  But he'd Baul nigh half a Day  If he knew and lik'd his Pay  For his Person let it pass  Only Note his  Face  was  Brass  His Heart was like a  Pumice  Stone  And for  Conscience  he had none  Of  Earth  and  Air  he was compos'd  With  Water  round about enclos'd  But  Earth  in him had greatest Share  For questionless his Life lay there  And thence his cankred  Envy  sprung  Which poyson'd both his  Heart  and  Tongue  Air  made him frothy light and vain  And puff't him up with proud Disdain  Flouting  and  fleering  more like a  StagePlayer  Than an  Anabaptist  Preacher and Prayer  Fitter to be a  Mountebank  's Fool  Than peep into a  DivinitySchool  More Tricks he had than  Jack Pudding  by Half  To raise the rude  Multitude  into a Laugh  Into the  Water  oft he went  And through the  Water  many sent  That was ye know his Element  The greatest Odds that did appear  Was this for ought that I can hear  That He in  Cold  did others dip  But did himself  Hot Waters  sip  Sip said I Nay more than so  Sipping wou'd not serve his turn  He did unto  Quaffing  go  'Twas much his Guts he did not burn  For if Credit may be given  To Report he'd Fuddle even  Till he Reeled to and fro  And his Cause he'd never doubt  If wellsoak'd o'er Night in  Stout  But mean while he must not lack  Brandy  or a Draught of  Sack  One Dispute wou'd shrink a Bottle  Of three Pints if not a Pottle  One wou'd think he fetch'd from thence  All his dreaming  Eloquence  And his fourleg'd  Syllogisms  Proving  Breakings  are no  Schisms  Wot ye why Himself  Brake  twice  Say no more the Point is nice  But let us now bring back the Sot  Unto his  AquaVitae  Pot  And observe with some Content  How he fram'd his Argument  That his Whistle he might wet  The Bottle to his Mouth he set  And being Master of that Art  Thence he drew the  Major  part  But left the  Minor  still behind  Good reason why He wanted Wind  If his Breath wou'd have held out  He had Conclusion drawn no doubt  But to't again he went and thence  He fetch'd a lusty Consequence  Then finding all his Drink was spent  He thus wound up his Argument  My Sides are not of Iron neither  Are my Lungs made of Whitleather  If therefore you've not I have done  Then Leaping down  From the Dispute at  WheelerStreet London  the    th of  October  away he Run  The Controversie which had been raised by  ose cavilling  Baptists  had not been long end  before another was raised by an  Episcopal  iest in  Lincolnshire  Who fearing as it seem  to lose some of his Hearers to the  Quakers  rote a Book which he miscalled  A Friendly  nference between a Minister and a Parishioner of  inclining to Quakerism  In which he Mis  ted and greatly Perverted the  Quakers  Prin  ples that he might thereby beget in his Pa  hioners an Aversion to them And that he  ght Abuse us the more securely he concealed  self sending forth his Book without a Name  This Book coming to my Hand became m  Concern after I had read it and considere  the evil Management and worse design ther  +of to Answer it Which I did in a Treati  called  Truth Prevailing and detecting Erro  Published in the Year  My Answer I divided according to the sev  +ral Subjects handled in the Conference into d  +vers distinct Chapters the last of which trea  +ed of TYTHES  This being the Priests  Delilah  and th  Chapter of mine pinching them it seems  a tender part the Belly they laid their Hea  together and with what speed they could se  forth a distinct Reply to the last Chapter  Tythes  in mine under the Title of  The Right  Tythes Asserted and Proved  This also ca  forth without a Name yet pretended to  written by another Hand  Before I had finished my Rejoynder to t  came forth another called  A Vindication of  Friendly Conference  said to be written by  Author of the feigned Conference who was  yet willing to trust the World with his Na  So much of it as related to the Subject I w  then upon  Tythes  I took into my Rejoynde  the  Right of Tythes  which I Published in  Year with this Title  The Foundat  of Tythes Shaken  c  After this it was a pretty while befor  heard from either of them again But at len  came forth a Reply to my Last supposed to  written by the same Hand who had be  ritten the  Right of Tythes Asserted  c but  ll without a Name This latter Book had  ore of Art than Argument in it It was in  ed a  Hash  of illcook'd  Crambe  set off with as  uch Flourish as the Author was Master of  d swell'd into Bulk by many Quotations But  ose so wretchedly misgiven misapplied or  verted that to a judicious and impartial  ader I durst oppose my  Foundation of Tythes  ken  to the utmost Force that Book has in it  t it coming forth at a time when I was pret  well at leisure I intended a full Refutation  ereof and in order thereunto had written be  een Forty and Fifty Sheets When other Bu  ess more urgent intervening took me off  d detained me from it so long that it was then  ged out of Season and so it was laid aside  Hitherto the War I had been engag'd in was  a sort Foreign with People of other Reli  us Perswasions such as were open and avow  Enemies but now another sort of War a  e an intestine War raised by some among  selves such as had once been of us and yet  ained the same Profession and would have  n thought to be of us still But having  ough illgrounded Jealousies let in Discon  ts and thereupon fallen into Jangling chief  about ChurchDiscipline they at length  ke forth into an open Schism headed by two  rthern Men of Name and Note  John Wil  on  and  John Story  The latter of which as  ng the most active and popular Man having  ed a considerable Interest in the  West  carried  the Controversie with him thither an  there spreading it drew many too many t  abet him therein  Among those  William Rogers  a Merchant  Bristol  was not the least nor least accounted  by himself and some others He was a bo  and an active Man moderately Learned b  immoderately Conceited of his own Parts a  Abilities which made him forward to Engag  as thinking none would dare to take up t  Gauntlet he should cast down This high Op  +nion of himself made him rather a Troub  +some than Formidable Enemy  That I may here step over the various ste  by which he advanced to open Hostility  what I was not Actually or Personally engag  in He in a while arrived to that height  Folly and Wickedness that he Wrote and Pu  +lished a large Book in Five Parts to which  Maliciously gave for a Title  The Christian Q  +ker distinguished from the Apostate and Innovat  thereby Arrogating to himself and those w  were of his Party the topping Stile of  Christ  Quaker  and no less Impiously than Uncha  +tably branding and rejecting all others e  the main Body of  Friends  for  Apostates  a  Innovators  When this Book came abroad it was no  little and He for its sake cryed up by his  judicious Admirers whose Applause setting  Head assoat he came up to  London  at the ti  of the  YearlyMeeting  then following and at  Close thereof gave notice in writing to this  +ct  viz That if any were Dissatisfied with his  ok he was there ready to Maintain and Defend  h it and himself against all Commers  This daring Challenge was neither dreaded  r slighted but an Answer forthwith returned  Writing Signed by a few  Friends  amongst  hom I was one to let him know that as ma  were Dissatisfied with his Book and him he  ould not fail God willing to be met by the  xth Hour next Morning at the Meeting  ace at  DevonshireHouse  Accordingly we met and continued the Meet  g till Noon or after in which time he sur  unded with those of his own Party as might  et and assist him was so fairly foiled and baf  d and so fully exposed that he was glad to  it the Place and early next Morning the own also leaving in excuse for his going so  bruptly off and thereby refusing us another Meeting with him which we had earnestly pro  oked him to this slight shift that he had be  re given Earnest for his Passage in the StageCoach home and was not willing to lose it  I had before this gotten a sight of his Book  nd procured one for my use on this occasion  ut I had not time to read it through But a while after Providence cast another of them in  o my Hands very unexpectedly For our dear  riend  G Fox  passing through this Country a  ong  Friends  and lying in his Journey at my House had one of them in his Bags which he  ad made some Marginal Notes upon For that  ood Man like  Julius Caesar  willing to improve  all parts of his time did usually even i  his Travels dictate to his  Amanuensis  what h  would have committed to Writing I knew not that he had this Book with him for he ha  not said any thing to me of it till going in th  Morning into his Chamber while he wa  Dressing himself I found it lying on the Tabl  by him And understanding that he was goin  but for a few Weeks to Visit  Friends  in the Meet+ings hereabouts and the Neighbouring parts  Oxford  and  Berkshire  and so return through th  County again I made bold to ask him if  would Favour me so much as to leave it wit  me till his Return that I might have the op+portunity of reading it thorough He consente  and as soon almost as he was gone I set my se  to read it over But I had not gone far in i e're observing the many foul Falshoods ma  +lious Slanders gross Perversions and false Do+ctrines abounding in it the sense thereof in+flamed my Breast with a Just and Holy Indigna+tion against the Work and that Devilish Spi  in which it was brought forth Wherefor  finding my Spirit raised and my Understandin  Divinely opened to Refute it I began the Boo  again and reading it with Pen in Hand An+swered it Paragraphically as I went And  clear were the Openings I received from th  Lord therein that by the time my Friend cam  back I had gone through the greatest part of it  and was too far engaged in Spirit to think o  giving over the Work Wherefore requesting him to continue the Book a little longer with  me I soon after finished the Answer which with  Friends  Approbation was Printed under  he Title of  An Antidote against the Infection of  W Rogers  his Book miscalled The Christian Qua  er  c This was written in the Year But no Answer was given to it either by him  r any other of his Party though many others were concerned therein and some by Name so  ar as I have ever heard Perhaps there might  e an Hand of Providence overruling them  herein to give me leisure to attend some other  ervices which soon after fell upon me  For it being a Stormy time and Persecu  ion waxing hot upon the ConventicleAct  hrough the busie Boldness of Hungry Infor  ers who for their own Advantage did not  nly themselves hunt after Religious and Pea  eable Meetings but drove on the Officers  not only the more Inferior and Subordinate  ut in some places even the Justices also for  ear of Penalties to Hunt with them and for  hem I found a Pressure upon my Spirit to write a small Treatise to inform such Officers  ow they might secure and defend themselves from being ridden by those Malepert Informers and made their Drudges  This Treatise I called  A Caution to Constables and other Inferior Officers concerned in the Execution of the ConventicleAct With some Observations thereupon humbly offered by way of Advice to such Wellmeaning and Moderate Justices of the Peace as would not willingly Ruin their Peaceable Neighbours  c  This was thought to have some good Service where it came upon such Sober and Moderate Officers as well  Justices  as  Constables  c as acted rather by Constraint than Choice by incouraging them to stand their Ground with more Courage and Resolution against the In+sults of sawcy  Informers  But whatever Ease it brought to others it brought me some Trouble and had like to have brought me into more Danger had not Provi+dence wrought my Deliverance by an unex+pected Way  For as soon as it came forth in Print which was in the Year one  William Ayrs  o  Watford  in  Hertfordshire  a Friend and an Ac+quaintance of mine who was both an  Apothecay  and  Barber  being acquainted with divers of the Gentry in those Parts and going often to som  of their Houses to Trim them took one o  these Books with him when he went to Tri  Sir  Benjamin Titchborn  of  Rickmansworth  an  presented it to him supposing he would have ta+ken it kindly as in like Cases he had formerly done But it fell out otherwise For he lookin  it over after  Ayrs  was gone and taking it b  the wrong Handle entertained an evil Opinio  of it and of me for it though he knew me no  He thereupon communicated both the Book  and his Thoughts upon it to a Neighbouring Justice living in  Rickmansworth  whose Nam  was  Thomas Fotherly  who concurring with hi  in Judgment they concluded that I should b  taken up and Prosecuted for it as a Seditiou  Book For a Libel they could not call it my Name being to it at length  Wherefore sending for  Ayrs  who had brought the Book Justice  Titchborn  examined him if  he knew me and where I dwelt  Who telling him He  knew me well and had been often at my House  He gave him in charge to give me Notice that  I should appear before him and the other Justice at  Rickmansworth  on such a Day  Threatning that  if I did not appear he himself should be Prosecuted for spreading the Book  This put  William Ayrs  in a Fright Over he came in haste with this Message to me troubled that he should be a means to bring me into Trouble But I endeavoured to give him Ease by assuring him I would not fail with God's Leave to appear at the time and place appointed and thereby free him from  Trouble  or  Danger  In the Interim I received Advice by an Express out of  Sussex  that  Guli Penn  with whom I had had an Intimate Acquaintance and firm Friendship from our very Youths was very dangerously Ill her Husband being then absent in  Pennsylvania  and that she had a great Desire to see and speak with me  This put me to a great Straight and brought a sore Exercise on my Mind I was divided betwixt Honour and Friendship I had engaged my Word to appear before the Justices which to omit would bring Dishonour on me and my Profession To stay till that time was come and past might probably prove if I  should then be left at Liberty too late to Answer her desire and satisfie Friendship  After some little Deliberation I resolv'd as the best Expedient to answer both Ends to go over next Morning to the Justices and lay my Straight before them and try if I cou'd procure from them a Respit of my Appearance before them until I had been in  Sussex  and paid the Duty of Friendship to my Sick Friend Which I had the more Hopes to obtain because I knew those Justices had a great respect for  Guli  For when  William Penn  and she were first Married they lived for some Years at  Rickmansworth  in which time they contracted a  Neighbourly Friendship  with both these Justices and theirs who ever after retained a kind regard for them both  Early therefore in the Morning I rode over But being wholly a Stranger to the Justices I went first to  Watford  that I might take  Ayrs  along with me who supposed himself to have some Interest in  Justice Titchborn  And when I came there understanding that another Friend of that Town whose Name was  John Wells  was well acquainted with the other Justice  Fotherly  having imparted to them the Occasion of my coming I took them both with me and hasted back to  Rickmansworth  Where having put our Horses up at an Inn and leaving  W Ayrs  who was a Stranger to  Fotherly  there I went with  John Wells  to  Fotherly  's House and being brought into a fair Hall I tarried there while  Wells  went into the Parlour to him and having acquainted him that I was there and desired  to speak w  th him brought him to me with Severity in his Countenance  After he had asked me in a Tone which spake Displeasure  what I had to say to him  I told him I came to wait on him upon an Intimation given me that he had something to say to me He thereupon plucking my Book out of his Pocket asked me  If I owned my self to be the Author of that Book  I told him If he pleased to let me look into it if it were mine I would not deny it He thereupon giving it into my Hand when I had turned over the Leaves and look'd it through finding it to be as it came from the Press I told him I wrote the Book and would own it all but the Errors of the Press Whereupon he looking sternly on me answered  Your own Errors you should have said  Having Innocency on my side I was not at all daunted at either his Speech or Looks but feeling the Lord present with me I replied I know there are Errors of the Press in it and therefore I excepted them but I do not know there is any Error of mine in it and therefore cannot except them But added I if thou pleasest to shew me any Error of mine in it I shall readily both acknowledge and retract it And thereupon I desired him to give me an Instance in any one Passage in that Book wherein he thought I had Erred He said  he needed not go to particulars but charge me with the general Contents of the whole Book  I replied that such a Charge would be too General for me to give a Particular Answer to but if he would assign  me any particular Passage or Sentence in the Book wherein he apprehended the ground of Offence to lie when I should have opened the Terms and explained my meaning therein he might perhaps find Cause to change his Mind and entertain a better Opinion both of the Book and me And therefore I again intreated him to let me know what particular Passage or Passages had given him an Offence He told me  I needed not to be in so much haste for that I might have it timely enough if not too soon But this  said he  is not the Day appointed for your Hearing and therefore  added he  what I pray made you in such haste to come now  I told him I hoped he wou'd not take it for an Argument of Guilt that I came before I was sent for and offered my self to my Purgation before the time appointed And this I spake with somewhat a brisker Air which had so much Influence on him as to bring a somewhat softer Air over his Countenance  Then going on I told him I had a particular Occasion which induced me to come now which was That I received Advice last Night by an Express out of  Sussex  That  William Penn  's Wife with whom I had had an intimate Acquaintance and strict Friendship  ab ipsis ferè Incunabilis  at least  à teneris Unguiculis  lay now there very ill not without great Danger in the Apprehension of those about her of her Life and that she had exprest her desire that I would come to her as soon as I could the rather for that her Husband  was absent in  America  That this had brought a great Straight upon me being divided between  Friendship  and  Duty  willing to visit my Friend in her Ilness which the Nature and Law of Friendship required yet unwilling to omit my  Duty  by failing of my Appearance before him and the other Justice according to their Command and my Promise lest I should thereby subject not my own Reputation only but the Reputation of my Religious Profession to the Suspicion of Guilt and Censure of willingly shunning a Tryal To prevent which I had chosen to anticipate the Time and come now to see if I could give them Satisfaction in what they had to object against me and thereupon being dismist pursue my Journey into  Sussex  or if by them detained to submit to Providence and by an Express to acquaint my Friend therewith both to free her from an Expectation of my Coming and my self from any Imputation of Neglect  While I thus delivered my self I observed a sensible Alteration in the Justice and when I had done speaking he first said he was  very sorry for Madam  Penn  's Ilness  of whose Virtue and Worth he spake very highly yet not more than was her due Then he told me  That for her sake he would do what he could to further my Visit to her But  said he  I am but one and of my self can do nothing in it therefore you must go to Sir  Benjamin Titchborn  and if he be at home see if you can prevail with him to meet me that we may consider of it  But I can assure you  added he  the matter which will be laid to your Charge concerning your Book is of greater Importance than you seem to think it For your Book has been laid before the  KING  and  Council  and the Earl of  Bridgwater  who is one of the  Council  hath thereupon given us Command to Examine you about it and secure you  I wish said I I could speak with the Earl my self for I make no Doubt but to acquit my self unto him And added I if thou pleasest to give me thy Letter to him I will wait upon him with it forthwith For although I know continued I that he hath no Favour for any of my Perswasion yet knowing my self to be wholly innocent in this matter I can with Confidence appear before him or even before the KING in Council  Well  said he  I see you are Confident but for all that let me tell you how good soever your Intention was you timed the publishing of your Book very unluckily for you cannot be ignorant that there is a very dangerous Plot lately discovered contrived by the  Dissenters  against the  Government  and  His Majesty's  Life  This was the  RiePlot  then newly broke forth and laid upon the  Presbyterians And for you  added he  to publish a Book just at that Juncture of time to discourage the Magistrates and other Officers from putting in Execution those Laws which were made to suppress their Meetings looks I must tell you but with a scurvy Countenance upon you  If replied I with somewhat a pleasanter Air there was any Mistiming in the Case it must  lie on the Part of those Plotters for timing the breaking forth of their Plot while my Book was a Printing for I can bring very good Proof that my Book was in the Press and wellnigh wrought off before any Man talked or knew of a Plot but those who were in it  Here our Discourse ended and I taking for the present my leave of him went to my Horse and changing my Companion rode to Justice  Titchborn  's having with me  William Ayrs  who was best acquainted with him and who had casually brought this Trouble on me  When he had introduced me to  Titchborn  I gave him alike Account of the Occasion of my coming at that time as I had before given to the other Justice And both he and his Lady who was present exprest much Concern for  Guli Penn  's Ilness  I found this Man to be of quite another Temper than Justice  Fotherly  for this Man was smooth soft and oily whereas the other was rather rough severe and sharp Yet at the winding up I found  Fotherly  my truest Friend  When I had told Sir  B Titchborn  that I came from Justice  Fotherly  and requested him to give him a Meeting to consider of my Business he readily without any Hesitation told me he would go with me to  Rickmansworth  from which his House was distant about a Mile and calling for his Horses mounted immediately and to  Rickmansworth  we rode  After they had been a little while together I was called in before them and in the first place  they Examined me  what was my Intention an  Design in writing that Book  I told them the I  +troductory Part of it gave a plain Account o  it  viz  "That it was to get Ease from the Pe+nalties of a  Severe Law  often Executed wit  too great a Severity by unskilful Officers  who were driven on beyond the Bounds o  their Duty by the impetuous Threats of a sort of Insolent Fellows as needy as greedy who for their own Advantage sought out Ruin  To prevent which was the Design and Drift of that Book by acquainting such Officers how they might safely demean themselves in the Execution of their Offices towards their honest and peaceable Neighbours without ruining either their Neighbours or themselves to enrich some of the worst of Men And that I humbly conceived It was neither Unlawful nor Unreasonable for a Sufferer to do this so long as it was done in a fair sober and peaceable Way  They then put me in Mind of the Plot told me  It was a troublesome and dangerous Time and my Book might be Construed to import Sedition in discouraging the Officers from putting the Laws in Execution as by Law and by their Oath they were bound  And in fine brought it to this Issue That  they were directed to secure me by a Commitment to Prison until the Assize at which I should receive a further Charge than they were provided now to give me but because they were desirous to forward my Visit to Madam  Penn  they told me they would admit me to Bayl and therefore if I would enter a Recognizance with sufficient Sureties for  my Appearance at the next Assize they would leave me at Liberty to go on my Journey  I told them I could not do it They said  hey would give me as little Trouble as they could  nd therefore they would not put me to seek Bail but  ould accept those two Friends of mine who were  hen present to be bound with me for my Appearance  I let them know my Straight lay not in the Difficulty of procuring Sureties for I did sup  ose my self to have sufficient Acquaintance  nd Credit in that place if on such an Occasion I could be free to use it but as I knew my  elf to be an innocent Man I had not Satis  action in my self to desire others to be bound  or me nor to enter my self into a Recogni  ance that carrying in it to my Apprehension Reflection on my Innocency and the Repu  ation of my Christian Profession  Here we stuck and strugled about this a pret  y while till at length finding me fixed in my  udgment and resolved rather to go to Prison  han give Bail they ask'd me  If I was against Appearing or only against being bound with Sure  ies to Appear  I told them I was not against Appearing which as I could not avoid if I would so I would not if I might but was  eady and willing to Appear if required to  nswer whatsoever should be charged against me But in any Case of a Religious Nature or wherein my Christian Profession was concerned which I took this Case to be I could not yield  give any other or further Security than my Word or Promise as a Christian  They unwilling to commit me took hold o  that and ask'd  If I would promise to appear  answered Yes with due Limitations  What d  you mean by due Limitations  said they I mea  replied I if I am not disabled or prevented by Sickness or Imprisonment For added I a  you alledge that it is a troublesome Time I per+haps may find it so I may for ought I know  be seized and imprisoned elsewhere on the sam  Account for which I now stand here before you  and if I should how then could I appear at th  Assize in this County  Oh  said they  these ar  due Limitations indeed Sickness or Imprisonmen  are lawful Excuses and if either of these befal yo  we shall not expect your Appearance here but the  you must Certifie us that you are so disabled by Sicknes  or Restraint  But said I how shall I know when and where I shall wait upon you again after my Re+turn from  Sussex You need not  said they  trou+ble your self about that we will take care to giv  you Notice of both Time and Place and till you hea  from us you may dispose your self as you please  Well then said I I do promise you tha  when I shall have received from you a fres  Command to Appear before you I will if th  Lord permit me Life Health and Liberty ap+pear when and where you shall appoint  It is enough  said they  we will take your Word  And desiring me to give their hearty Respect  and Service to Madam  Penn  they dismist m  with their good Wishes for a good Journey  I was sensible that in this they had dealt ve  y favourably and kindly with me therefore I  ould not but acknowledge to them the Sense I  ad thereof Which done I took leave of them  nd mounting returned home with what haste  could to let my Wife know how I had sped  nd having given her a summary Account of  he Business I took Horse again and went so  ar that Evening towards  Worminghurst  that I got thither pretty early next Morning and to my great Satisfaction found my Friend in an  opeful Way towards a Recovery  I stay'd some Days with her and then find  ng her Ilness wear daily off and some other  riends being come from  London  to visit her I  mindful of my Engagement to the Justices  nd unwilling by too long an Absence to give  hem Occasion to suspect I was willing to avoid  heir Summons leaving those other Friends to  ear her Company longer took my leave of her  nd them and set my Face homewards car  ying with me the welcome Account of my  riend's Recovery  Being returned home I waited in daily Ex  ectation of a Command from the Justices to  ppear again before them but none came I  pake with those Friends who had been with me when I was before them and they said They  had heard nothing of it from them although  ey had since been in Company with them  At length  he Assize came but no Notice was given to me that I shou'd appear there In fine they  er troubled themselves nor me any further a  out it  Thus was a Cloud that look'd black an threatned an  great Storm blown gently over b  a providential Breath which I could not bu  with a thankful Mind acknowledge to the Al  +great Allgood Allwise Disposer in whos  Hand and at whose Command the Hearts o  all Men even the greatest are and who turn  their Counsels disappoints their Purposes and defeats their Designs and Contrivances as He pleases For if my dear Friend  Guli Penn  had not fallen Sick if I had not thereupon been sen  for to her I had not prevented the time of my Appearance but had appeared on the Day ap+pointed And as I afterwards understood tha  was the Day appointed for the Appearance of a great many Persons of the Dissenting Party in that side of the County who were to be taken up and secured on the Account of the afore+mentioned Plot which had been cast upon the  Presbyterians  So that if I had then appeared  with and amongst them I had in all likelihood  been sent to Goal with them for Company and that under the Imputation of a Plotter tha  which nothing was more contrary to my Profes+sion and Inclination  But though I came off so easie it fared no  so well with others for the Storm increasing  many Friends in divers Parts both of City and Country suffered greatly the Sense whereo  did deeply affect me and the more for that I observed the Magistrates not thinking the Laws which had been made against us severe enough perverted the Law in order to punish  s For calling our peaceable Meetings  Riots  which in the Legal Notion of the Word  Riot    a  Contradiction in Terms  they indicted our  riends as  Rioters  for only sitting in a Meeting  o' nothing was there either said or done by  em and then set Fines on them at pleasure  This I knew to be not only against  Right  and  J  stice  but even against  Law  and it troubled  e to think that we should be made to suffer  t only by Laws made directly against us but  en by Laws that did not at all concern us  or was it long before I had Occasion offered  ore throughly to consider this Matter  For a Justice of the Peace in this County who  as called Sir  Dennis Hampson  of  Taplow  break  g in with a Party of Horse upon a little Meet  g near  Wooburn  in his Neighbourhood the  st  the  Fifth Month  sent most of the Men  the Number of Twenty three whom he found  ere to  Alesbury  Prison tho' most of them were  r Men who lived by their Labour and not  ing himself to the next  QuarterSessions  at  ckingham  on the th of the some Month sent  Clark with Direction  That they should be in  cted for a Riot  Whither the Prisoners were  ried and indicted accordingly and being  essed by the Court to Traverse and give Bail  y moved to be tryed forthwith but that was  ied them And they giving in Writing the  ason of their refusing Bail and Fees were re  nded to Prison till next QuarterSessions but  lliam Woodhouse  was again Bailed as he had  en before and  William Mason  and  John Reeve  who not being Friends but casually taken at that Meeting entred  Recognizance  as the Court desired and so were released till next Sessions Before which time  Mason  died and  Reeve  being sick appeared not but got himself taken off  And in the  Eighth Month  following the Twenty one Prisoners that remained were brought to Tryal a Jury was found who brought in a pr  +tended Verdict that they were  Guilty of a Rio  for only sitting peaceably together without  Wo  or  Action  and tho' there was no Proclamatio  made nor they required to depart but one  the Jurymen afterwards did confess  he kne  not what a Riot was  yet the Prisoners we  fined a Noble a Piece and recommitted to P  +son  during Life  a hard Sentence or the  King  Pleasure  or until they should  pay the said Fin  William Woodhouse  was forthwith discharged  his Kinsman's paying the Fine and Fees for hi  Thomas Dell  and  Edward Moor  also by other Pe  +ple of the World paying their Fines and Fees  them and shortly after  Stephen Pewsey  by t  Town and Parish where he lived for fear  Wife and Children should become a Charge u  on them The other Seventeen remained P  +soners till King JAMES's Proclamation of P  +don whose Names were  Thomas  and  Willi  Sexton Timothy Child Robert Moor Richard Jam  William  and  Robert Aldridge John Ellis Geo  Salter John Smith William Tanner William B  +chelor John Dolbin Andrew Brothers Rich  Baldwin John Jennings  and  Robert Austin  A SUPPLEMENT  Being a Continuation of the History of the Life of  THOMAS ELLWOOD  Giving Account in particular of his  Books  and  Writings  OUR dear Friend  Thomas Ellwood  for whom we cannot but have an honourable Esteem for his Service in the Church  aving written an  Historical Account  of Part of  is Life well worth the Knowledge of Posterity  far as it goes  viz  to the Year and  ere left off Whether he writ any further  whether ever he designed it or for what  eason he did not proceed is uncertain but so  is that no more of it can be found at present  hich is to be lamented he being a Man so E  inent many Ways that any Part of it should  e lost In Consideration whereof it rose in my  eart to write something in order to  supply  the  eficiency thereof many things occurring to  y Mind which its pity should be omitted  herefore for the Respect I bore him and owe  his Memory being acquainted with him for ore than the last Twenty Years of his Life I  all endeavour to make up that Defect as far as  am capable of tho' far short of what himself  ight have done by giving an Account of some  of the most material Passages of the remaining Part of his Life and such Memorials of him and his Works as came to my Hands which I shall set down with as much Brevity and Plainness as I can in Sincerity to him and the Truth he professed and adorned Particularly of his Labours Writings Sufferings and End from the time he left off  But first I must look back a little to give some additional Account of some Passages in re+lation to his Answers to the  Priests  about  Tythes  for the Readers Information and Satisfaction  which every Body may not know to preven  Misapprehensions in the Case  In the Year he answered a Namele  Book miscalled  A Friendly Conference between  Minister and a Parishioner of his inclining to  Qua+kerism in a Book intituled  Truth prevailing a  detecting Error  which he divided into Nin  Chapters according to the various Subjects trea  +ed of wherein that nameless Author had endea+voured to misrepresent us the last of whic  was of  Tythes  'This to use his own Words  pinching the Priests in a tender Part the  Bel  as  Erasmus  wittily said  Luther  did the  Monk  made them bestir themselves and lay the  Heads together to consider what was to b  done  Preface to Foundation of Tythes Shaken Pag  After divers Debates and much Co  +sultation as he was informed about it it wa  at last resolved to Answer that first which th  the last Chapter in his Book yet having the fi  and chiefest Place in the Priests Minds and A  +fections the  Priests Delilah the very Darling a  Minion of the Clergy  says T E  the Oil by which their Lamp is Nourished the Pay by which their Army is maintained  as the Priest confesses and to take away  Tythes  would be to  stop the Oil that nourishes the Lamp and force them to disband for want of Pay  Introduction  Page  Right of Tythes  p  This being I say their chiefest Concern and lying nearest at Heart  obtain'd  from them the first and chiefest Defence which at length came forth by a nameless Author also in a Book intituled  The Right of Tythes asserted and proved  To which  T E  reply'd in in a large Book intituled  The Foundation of  Tythes  shaken and the four principal Posts    of  Divine Institution Primitive Practice Voluntary Donation  and  Positive Laws  on which the Nameless Author of the said Book had set his pretended Right to  Tythes  removed  Tracing them all along from the  Patriarchs  to the time of the  Law  shewing the Design and Use of them under it and how they were abolished by the Coming and Suffering of Christ in the Flesh and how they came to be set up again in the Declension of the Church by  Popish  Kings and Councils in the Night of Apostacy for supersticious and Idolatrous Ends and Uses contrary to the Gospel Dispensation and consequently not Obligatory on Christians by any  Divine Right  to pay in this Gospel Day answering all the Objections and Pretences which were brought by that Author for them from the Four forementioned Topicks  To this Book of  T E  's there was a pretended Answer put forth Two Years after supposed by  the Author of the former but Nameless still the Author not daring to own his Work with his Name though since called  Combers  intituled  The Right of  Tythes  Reasserted  wherein the Proofs from the four former Points are said to be further  strengthened and vindicated especially from the Objections taken out of Mr  Selden  's History of Tythes  as if it was chiefly designed against  John Selden T E  's Name or Book not being so much as mentioned in the Title Page though often in the Book as if it was however designed as an Answer to him which therefore  T E  though not entituled to it took in Hand to rejoin to and had begun and made some considerable Progress in it but before he had gone through or finished it some other Occasions falling in his way of which hereafter it was laid by and never finished though he had writ as he told me near  Sixty Sheets  though I find but  Fourty Six  among his Papers but these with his Notes and Quotations will make near  Sixty  for he had Collected a vast Number of Materials out of Authors in order thereto as appears by his Papers which I have since seen For thus it was That some of the Priests party vaunting that this Second Book of the Priests was not answered I took occasion once at  London  in the Year to speak to him about it and he told me  That the Substance of the Priests Arguments in this Second Book were answered in his former  The Foundation of Tythes shaken  only some New Quotations which he had brought and that was what he chiefly designed  to deal with the Priest about to Examine and Clear by adding some New Ones also but that he never expected to have the last Word with the Priests about  Tythes  which their Interest lay so much in that they would never be satisfied but always be Cavilling about some way or other how little soever it was to the Purpose and some other Services taking him off  as aforesaid  he laid it by  Which I mention to satisfie any who may Question in their Minds why it was never answered or at least gone through and this is the Reason why I resumed this Matter  'In handling the Argument of  Tythes  says he in a Paper found among his Manuscripts as an  Introdnction  to his said intended Answer I write with this Disadvantage That I encounter a numerous Party and Order of Men with whom  Interest  is far more prevalent than  Truth  whose  Profit  will not permit them to yield to  Reason  whose  Advantage  will not suffer them to acknowledge the plainest  Demonstration  their  Gain  as apparently lying in that which I oppose as  Demetrius  's and his FellowCraftsmen the  Silversmiths  of  Ephesus  did in that which the Apostle preached against  Acts  Hence is it that they bend all their Strength and imploy their utmost Force to maintain this Point by which they are maintained and like those  Shrinemakers  of old they endeavour to carry it by Noise and Clamour instead of Truth and Reason Nor do they regard what they say how false soever or whom they bespatter how undeservedly  soever in order to the upholding their adored  Diana  and enjoying their most beloved  Delilah TYTHES  My present Adversary is not ashamed to say p  That I and my fellow Quaking Speakers  as he reproachfully calls us  have our Gain by Railing against Tythes  A Charge so apparently and rediculously False that it needs no more than its own Malice and Folly to detect it With equal Reason might  Demetrius  have charged St  Paul  that he and his Brethren had their Gain by impugning the Idolatrous Worship of  Diana  '  Sacriledge  and  Idolatry  the Priests say  are Sins near of kin  but  Covetousness  and the  Clergy  are perhaps nearer The great Outcry against  Sacriledge  is made for the most part by Idolaters and false Ministers who as they are most greedy and crafty to get so are they most solicitous and careful to keep most enraged and clamourous when they come to lose their unjustly acquired Gains Thus was it with the  Popish Clergy  after they had gull'd the People by a religious Cheat of a great part of their Substance they laboured to terrifie them by the Name of  Sacriledge  from attempting to recover that which had been so fraudulently gotten from them and doubtless the  English Clergy  as they derive in chief part the Maintenance they possess from their Predecessors the  Popish Clergy  from whom they received their  Priesthood  have therewith also taken up from them their Old Cry of  Sacriledge  with which as a Bugbear they would scare all from attempting to discover the  Cheat  But the legal Alienation of a great Part of those surreptitius Acquisitions of the  Clergy  begun in  HENRY the Eighth  's Time carried on in  EDWARD the Sixth  's and compleated in Q  ELIZABETH  's of these three the two last were  Protestant  Princes hath abated the Edge of that  Clerical  Weapon and satisfied the disintrested Part of the Nation that the Word  Sacriledge  in this Case is but like a Scarecrow especially when used by the Priests for their own Profit as most commonly it is for though they pretend the Maintenance of  God's Worship  yet it is their own Maintenance they intend And herein  Demetrius  and they most patly agree for he also urged as the most specious Pretence and which was most likely to impress the People the Danger lest by  Paul  's Preaching  the Temple of the great Goddess Diana should be despised and her Magnificence destroyed  Acts Whereas the great Inducement to him for stirring was the danger lest his Craft should be set at nought and he should thereby lose the Gains he made by  Diana's Temple  ver Do the Priests now cry out against  Sacriledge  So did  Demetrius  and his Craftsmen then Did they cloak their private Interest with a seeming Regard and Care for the  Temple and Magnificence of their Goddess  Dinna So do the  Priests  theirs now with a pretence of Zeal for the  Worship of God  Did they in their Fury take no notice of th  Magistrates  nor  Laws  of their Country S  neither do many of the  Priests  now who wit  out regard to  Law  or  Magistrates  run Fur  +ously and Tumultuously into their Neighbou  Grounds with their Servants and Teams and Forcibly and Arbitrarily Take and car+ry away their  Corn  and  Hay  when where and in what Quantity they please Will the  Priests  alledge that notwithstanding these irregular Practices yet they have the  Law  and  Magistrates  on their sides So had  De+metrius  and his Company too while the good  Apostle  not backt by  Laws  nor counte+nanced by  Magistracy  was yet Enabled by  Divine Assistance  to stand the shock of a  their Rage and Fury and boldly to Testifie a+gainst that which was Corrupt and Naugh  although it had the Favour and Support of  Law  and  Magistracy  too And indeed so ap  is the Comparison in most Respects betwee  those  ShrineMakers  and these  TytheTaker  that my Adversary in vain Labours to Reto  it for even the very particulars he instanc  to cast it upon me fix it the more firmly  the Head of himself and his own Party  'Nor is he less put to it to avoid the force  his own unwary Expressions of the  Oyl for t  Lamp  and  Pay for the Soldier  whereby  hath discovered that he and his Brethren a  meer mercinary Men whose  Lamp  will bu  no longer than it is fed with the  Oyl of Tyth  This was one of the  Arcana Cleri  a Secret  seems that should not have been divulged But  Children  and he knows who besides are said to tell true And he having inconsideratly blab'd it out his chief Care and Art is now how to palliate extenuate and mince the Matter and varnish it over with some kind of flourish that the ground of it may not be seen but this he does so weakly and lays his Colour so thin that even the weakest Eye may easily see through it The mention I made of these Passages in my former Book he calls  tedious and nauseous Repetitions  and tedious no doubt and nauseous it is to him and his Brethren to see the false Foundation of their Ministry so openly exposed but so little do I fear those Repetitions being nauseous or tedious to the indifferent Reader that upon this Occasion I desire him to peruse them again in the and Pages of my former Book  '  From Tythes being the Oyl to their Lamp and Pay to their Army  He says  I draw as I imagin a cutting Consequence  viz  That their Lamps will not burn without Oyl nor they Fight without Pay  This  Cutting Consequence  as he calls it he touches as tenderly as if he was afraid it would cut his Fingers though he well knew that in the Wording of it he had taken off its Edge as much as he could For if my Consequence had been only that their  Lamps will not burn without Oyl  it would not then have been so Keen He might then have Replied  Whose will Can any Lamp burn without Oyl  No sure Every  Lamp  must have  Oyl  But the  Oyl  should be suitable to the  Lam  an  Outward Lamp  should have  Outward Oy  an  Inward Lamp Inward Oyl  Now they pr  +tending their  Ministry  to be a  Spiritual Lam  a  Religious Lamp  as the  True Ministry  inde  is and is and can be Nourished only by t  Spiritual Heavenly Oyl  of the  Divine Eter  Word  and yet Confessing  Tythes to be the O  that Nourishes their Ministerial Lamp and wit  out which their Lamp will not Burn  This plai  +ly shews their  Lamp  is not  Spiritual  nor th  Ministry  what they Pretend  c  By this we may Judge  Ex pede Herculem  the Priests performance and  T E  's Answ  had he gone through and finished it which y  I hope so far as he hath gone may one ti  or other see the Light being well worth t  Perusal as it is and had he finished it I am  +tisfied it would have been a very serviceab  Piece No Hand in my Judgment being m  Capable of such a Performance But he ha  as I said some other Services on his Hands divert him Of which his Answer to  Willi  Rogers  's great Book aforesaid in Inti  +led  An Antidote against the Infection of  Willia  Rogers  's Book miscalled the  Christian Quak  In Five Parts soon after no doubt was o  containing above Thirty Sheets In which  Answered him Chapter by Chapter and  most Paragraph by Paragraph in Relation  Church Government and the good Order  Truth  Established amongst us and also as  most of the Principles of  Truth  which the  W R  in one part of his Work had endeavour  d to Pervert to his own Ends A Laborious Work it was and difficult task to go through  o evenly as he hath done And though it is Controversie yet pleasant to Read As also his  aution to Constables and other Inferior Officers  ncerning the Execution of the ConventicleAct With some Observations thereupon Humbly offered  way of Advice to such Wellmeaning and Mode  te Justices of the Peace as would not willingly  in their Peaceable Neighbours  c Which is  entioned in his own Account  And now to come to the time where he  eaks off his own Relation and to carry it on  some measure though far short and infe  ur to what his own Hand could have done  r it cannot be expected that any one can  ite another Man's Life like himself there  ing many Passages Publick and Private Out  ard and Inward even as to the frame of his  wn Mind and Condition between God and  own Soul which as  No Man knoweth the  ngs of a Man save the Spirit of a Man which is  im  So none can Relate but himself or like  self For as the Wise Man says  The Heart  weth his own Bitterness and the Stranger can  intermeddle whith his Joy  But what occurs  m my own Knowledge or from his Books  d Papers pertinent to the case in Hand shall  thfully be Related  Therefore to resume the Thread of his Dis  rse and begin where he leaves off He inti  tes at the Close of his own Account that the  Magistrates not thinking the Laws made a+gainst us  viz  the  ConventicleAct  c s  +vere enough perverted the Law by makin  our  Peaceable Meetings Riots  and Indicting o  Friends  as  Rioters  that they might Fine at Plea+sure Which he knew to be contrary to Law and Justice nor was it long says he before h  had occasion offered more throughly to Con  +der this matter  viz  the breaking up of t  Meeting near  Wooburn  by Justice  Hampso  sending Friends to Prison and Indicting the  for a  Riot  which shews he design'd to write  Book on that Subject though he doth not me  +tion it and accordingly did this Year aft  the  Caution to Constables  c as aforesaid T  he called  A Discourse concerning Riots Occasion  by some of the People called Quakers being Indict  for a Riot  c Of which he gives by way  Preface this further Account  'The Procee  +ings of late in City and Country against  of the People called  Quakers  for  Riots  for o  Meeting  Peaceably  together to  Serve  and  W  +ship  GOD first put me upon enquiring i  the Nature of  Riots  What upon inquiry  have found I here present to publick Vie  for common Benefit that none through Ig  +rance may be the occasion of bringing an  U  +just Suffering  upon an  Innocent People  a  thereby Guilt on themselves I do not prete  much Skill in  Law  a Study and Professio  was never bred to but having spent so  Hours on this occasion in searching what  Law Books say in this Case I hope I  without incurring the Censure of Presumption communicate my Gleaning to such of my well meaning Country Men as have not Leizure or Opportunity to inform themselves otherwise I solemnly declare I have no other End or Aim in this Work than to  do Good  and  prevent Evil  Which Consideration with Men of Candour and Ingenuity will be I hope a sufficient Apology for my seeming boldness in this Undertaking  And so he proceeds to set forth what  Riots  are in the Law and Law Books of which he cites divers and Scripture too to shew that our Peaceable Meetitgs which in those Days they used to make  Riots  that they might Imprison and Fine us at Pleasure could not be  Riots  tho' thro' Ignorance or Envy they were often so rendred which shewed their Injustice Saying  'How truly I have stated the Case on the one hand with respect to  Riots  the many Quotations in the foregoing Discourse will shew How true an Account on the other Hand I have given of our Meetings the whole Nation and all Nations where we have Meetings may Judge upon the whole says he My request is that all both  Justices  and  Jurors  who have or shall be Concerned in this or the like Case will seriously weigh the matter and not strain the Law beyond its due Extent adding To Oppress any by colour of Law is the greatest abuse of Law  Concluding with a serious Recapitulation and Application of the whole That none for the  future might Err Ignorantly in that Respect and if any would willfully they might be left without Excuse  About the same time or not long after he writ also  A Seasonable Disswasive from  Persecution  Humbly and Modestly yet with Christian freedom and plainness of Speech offered to the Consideration of all concerned therein on Behalf generally of all that suffer for Conscience sake Particularly the People called Quakers  In the beginning of which he defines what  Persecution  is  '  Persecution  says he is a word of so harsh a Sound and so generally Distastfull to  English  Ears that scarce any of those who are most forward and active in that Work are willing to have their Actions called by that Name That none therefore who have set an Hand to that Work or whose Minds are any whit inclining thereto may from the dislike they have to the Word  Persecution  Reject this  Disswasive  as a thing wherein they are not Concerned I think it needful here to declare what it is I mean by  Persecution  By  Persecution  then I intend  a Forcing or Compelling any by Pains or Penalties Bodily or Pecuniary to Relinquish or Forsake that Exercise of Religion or way of Worship which they believe to be the Right way of Worship and the true and acceptable Exercise of Religion which God hath required of them And to Receive Embrace Conform to and perform some other Exercise of Religion and way of Worship which they who are so Compelled are either firmly perswaded is not the Right or at  least have no belief that it is Right  This in short is that which I call  Persecution  and this is that which I Disswade from whatever other Name the Actors of it may please themselves in calling it by  I To begin with the first of these  viz  the Forcing or Compelling any to Forsake and and Leave that Exercise of Religion or way of Worship  c  The Reasons by which he endeavours to disswade all Men from such an undertaking are these  i e  the Heads of them  ' You may for ought you know be found  Fighting against God  You are not you cannot be upon your own Principles infallibly sure that that way of Worship which you thus endeavour to force us from is not the true Worship of God By endeavouring to force us from that way of Worship which we believe the Lord hath led us into and requireth of us you endeavour to force us to make  Shipwrack  of  Faith  In endeavouring by Force and Cruelty to Restrain us from Worshipping God as we are fully perswaded he hath Taught us and doth Require us You go out of the Path of the Righteous and tread in the Steps of the Wicked and Ungodly That Exercise of Religion which you would force us from is not simply of it self Condemned and Disallowed by that Law by the Severity of which you would force us from it In thus eagerly Pursuing us and Disturbing our Peaceable Meetings you give your selves as well as us a great deal of needless  Trouble  Refrain from these Men and let them alone  And lastly Be pleased to Consider what sort of Agents and Instruments you are fain to make use of and not seldom are your selves made use of by to carry on this Work Concluding this part thus O never give Cause for this  Epitaph  to be written on your Tombs  Here lies a Persecutor of the People of God  II Now for the other Branch of  Persecution  viz  The Forcing or Compelling of any by Pains or Penalties to Receive Embrace Conform to and Perform some Exercise of Religion and way of Worship  c The Reasons by which he endeavours to disswade all Men from such an Undertaking are these  viz  the Heads  ' In thus imposing your way of Worship upon others you act quite contrary to Christ and his Apostles In thus imposing your way of Worship upon others you follow the worst of Patterns  Nebuchadnezzar  King of  Babylon  c In forcing People to your way of Worship who have no Belief that it is the right you cause them to Sin for  whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin  In forcing People to your way of Worship who have a firm Perswasion and Belief that it is not the right you make Men  Hypocrites  and  Timeservers  By obtruding and inforcing your Religion upon others you greatly disparage and undervalue it and give Men the more ground to suspect and dislike it You break that great Command which Christ says is the  Law  and the Prophets  viz  All things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you do ye even so to them  Mat  All these Reasons are illustrated and backed with Scripture and Reason concluding with a  ery close and seasonable Application to our  Per  cutors  A solid serious Discourse it is if any Arguments had been sufficient to disswade Men  om  Persecution  of which there was very great bout this time particularly in  London Bristol  nd divers other Places the whole being well worth Perusal and I should have inclined to in  ert it at large but that it hath pleased God to  cline the Hearts of our Superiours to ease us in  hat respect by Granting a Toleration to  Prote  ant Dissenters  for which we are thankful These three  viz  the  Caution to Constables Discourse of Riots  and  Disswasive from Persecu  ion  were all Written or at least Printed this Year  And he acquitted himself so well on these Subjects that one  William Tournay  to him unknown sent him a Letter from  London  taking Notice of the aforesaid  Tracts  which he was so well pleased with that he desired his Judgment on the d th and th of Q  ELIZABETH  in Relation to the Proceedings then upon them to which our Friend  T E  return'd him an Answer in a large Letter which is in his Decades of Letters among many others to divers Persons and on various Subjects well worthy the Perusal from the Year down to his latter Times and if they were published  would help to supply the deficiency of his own Account of the latter Part of his Life  About this time he writ the following POEM or HYMN of Praise to the Lord whic  I think well deserves to be inserted in thi  Place Intituled  COLLAUDEMUS DOMINUM  COME let us Praise the LORD with on Consent  All ye whose Hearts to honour him are ben  Come let us of his gracious Dealings tell  For with us he hath dealt exceeding well  When him we did not seek he did us find  He gave us Sight when we were dark and blind  He brought us home when we were run astray  And set our Feet i'th' new and living way  When Hunger pin'd he gave us heavenly Bread  And with the choicest Dainties hath us fed  He from misleading Guides deliver'd hath  And led us forward in the Just Man's Path  He hath with Strength and Courage us endu'd  With Zeal for Truth and Christian Fortitude  He Wisdom from above doth daily give  To them that in his Truth sincerely live  In Battle he hath us preserv'd thus far  And made us Victors in the Holy War  Our Enemies he greatly hath subdu'd  His Sword in Blood o'th' slain hath been imbru'd  He hath preserved from the Roaring Lion  And brought a little Remnant safe to  Sion  Where in his Presence they sit down and Sing  Eternal  Hallelujah's  to their KING  Who lives and reigns and may his Reign extend  Throughout the Universe and have no End  T E  But to proceed  William Rogers  whom our Author Answered in the Year as aforesaid though he did not Reply to it or ever attempted it that I have heard of putting forth a Rhiming  Scourge  for  George Whitehead  against whom he bent his most Inveterate Spleen and who had also Answered his great Book falsly called  The Christian Quaker  in a Book intituled  The Accuser of the Brethren cast down  c  T E  writ an Answer to his Scourge in Verse intituled  RogeroMastix A Rod for  William Rogers  in return for his Rhiming Scourge  For which he gives the following Reason  To such as ask why I in Verse have writ  This Answer I return I held it fit  Verse  shou'd in  Verse  be answer'd  Prose  in  Prose  My Adversary his own Weapon chose  He chose before in  Prose  to write and then  I answer'd him in  Prose  So now agen  Since he his Stile from  Prose  to  Verse  hath chang'd  And in the  Muses Walks  hath boldly rang'd  In his own Method him I chose to treat  Lest he should wise be in his own Conceit  Prov  And begins thus  The Preacher tells us that  beneath the Sun  There's no new thing  for  That which shall be done  Hath been before  And  what is now a doing  Shall acted be again in Times ensuing  Let none be shaken therefore in his Mind  If he God's People now Reviled find  Reproach'd with bitter words and vilify'd  With filthy Slanders loaded and bely'd  By wicked Men Such was the Churches State  Of old as Sacred Story doth relate  And having recounted the Opposition made by  Rabshaketh Sanballat  and  Tobiah  c to the  Jews  and  Diotrephes  to the  Apostles  he proceeds  Page    By these Examples plainly it appears  How Satan play'd his Pranks in former Years  What Arts he us'd how craftily he wrought  What Instruments whereby to work he sought  One while professed Enemies and then  Another while he chose false Brethren  And though those Agents now are dead and gone  Satan remains the same the  Evil One  He Mischief always to the Church intends  And Mischief to effect his Agents sends  Though  Rabshaketh  be dead  Tobiah  rotten  Sanballat  and  Diotrephes  forgotten  The wicked Spirit that in them did strive  Against God's Truth and Church is still alive  And other Instruments doth daily raise  To hinder Truth's fair Progress in these Days  He Agents has great store of ev'ry Size  And Sort How numerous are Truth's Enemies  Yet blest be God A greater Number's those  That stand for Truth than those that it oppose  I list not here a MusterRoll to make  Of all who from without in hand did take  To Battle against Truth and shake their Spears  At  Israel's  Camp within these Twenty Years  Nor do I purpose to ennum'rate all  Who in that time themselves did  Quakers  call  That through misguided Zeal or Discontent  Their Bows against their Brethren have bent  But since some few of late appear to be  With Rage and Envy fill'd to that degree  That with more Bitterness than all the rest  Their Malice against Truth they have exprest  My Purpose is to single out from these  Him that appears as their  Diotrephes  And that is  ROGERS  For tho'  Crisp  and  Bug  With other some do at the same Oar tug  And Toil hard at it too with all their Might  et can they do no more but shew their Spight  And for the rest that lie behind the Skreen  And move the Wheels but like not to be seen  Although they help to carry on the Work  take less notice of them while they Lurk  Them therefore leaving I return again  To view  Will Rogers  his Poetick Strain  Who having been too often foil'd in  Prose  To try his Fortune now in  Verse  hath chose  Verse  without Offence that may call'd  Which is delivered in Rhimes so bald  So flat so dull so rough so void of Grace  Where  Symphony  and  Cadence  have no place  So full of  Chasmes  stuck with  Prosie  Pegs  Whereon his tired  Muse  might rest her Legs  Not having Wings and take new Breath that the  She might with much a do hop on agen  His    Words to that Effect Why so How so  Hence I observe Hence I conclude    do show  His Pursy  Muse  was often out of Wind  And glad when she a perching place could find  What drew thee  William  to this Rhiming fit  Having no more Propensity to it  Could'st think such hobling and unequal Rhimes  That make a Jangling like disorder'd Chimes  Could of a  POEM  e'er deserve the Name  Or e'er be read without the Author's Shame  What Clouds of Darkness in thy Lines appear  How is thy Stile perplex't How far from clear  Thy  Muse  is wrapt in thickest Fogs of Night  Which shews thou art departed from the Light  Nor Sun nor Moon nor Star throughout thy Boo  Is to be seen No Spring nor Christal Brook  Glides through thy Margin No thy Waters ru  Black like the Streams of  Styx  or  Phlegeton  And having gone through and Answered this Adversaries Book he sums it up and con+cludes as followeth Page  William  Thy Work is weigh'd thy Spirit try'd  And both thy Work and Spirit are deny'd  Thy Spirit is the same that wrought of old  In  Sanballat Tobiah  and the bold  Assyrian  Railer  Rabshakeh  who sought  God's Work and People to have brought to nought  As thou hast done And what the Prophet cry'd  In that Case may to thee be well apply'd  The Virgin hath despis'd thee  Zion  's Daughte  Makes thee the Object of her Scorn and Laughte  The Daughter of Jerusalem hath shook  At thee her Head  with a disdainful Look  or  whom hast thou Reproached and Blasphem'd  And against whom hast thou so  loudly scream'd  And lift thine Eyes on high  Thy Spleen doth swell  Against the Holy One of  Israel  To this effect the Prophet did declaim  Against the Proud  Assyrian  from whom came  That cursed Railer who e'en seems to be  Railing Blasphemies a Type of thee  What  Nehemiah  to  Sanballat  said  When he foul Slanders to his Charge had laid  That I to thee of all thy Slanders Thus  There are no such things acted  amongst us  As thy abusive Pamphlet doth contain  But out of thine own Heart thou dost them feign  And where thou carp'st at what we do aright  We can for Truth's sake in Reproach delight  The Lord rebuilding is his Holy City  Which thou and others envy more's the pity  And put forth all the Strength and Art you have  The Work to stop the Workmen to deprave  But never be so vain to think you can  The Work obstruct  'tis not the Work of Man  The God of Heaven He will prosper us  And therefore we his Servants  strengthned thus  Will rise and build as God shall us endue  With Courage Strength and Counsel for't  But you  No Portion have  who do the Work condemn  Right nor Memorial in JERUSALEM  My Soul laments your State who once have felt  That tend'ring Pow'r which stony Hearts can melt  And have been in some measure tend'red by it  But now so hard'ned are as to defie it  All you I mean who have in Print appear'd  With Envious Hearts and Conscience doubly sear'd  To fight against the  Truth  and to expose  God's People  to the  Fury  of their  Foes  And all you too who do that  Work  abet  Although your Names thereto ye have not set  Ah had ye kept unto the  heav'nly Grace  Which in your  inward Parts  the  Lord  did place  And not in  discontented Humour  run  After  Loheres Lotheres  as you have done  Ye might in  Truth  the  Bond of Peace  have known  And in the  Spirits Unity  have grown  Which is the  Churches Girdle  highly priz'd  By all the  Faithful  though by you despis'd  Whereas by letting in first  false Surmisings  Of others which e're long produc'd Despisings  And so made way for  Prejudice  to enter  Till  cancred Malice  in your  Hearts  did center  Ye now are broke and into Pieces Shatter'd  And from the  Body  and  Head  are Scatter'd  Without the Camp ye stand Oh dismal State  Snarling amongst the Dogs  without the Gate  Belching forth  Slander  and  Calumniation  'Gainst those that in the  Light  have kept their  Station  Oh may the God of Heaven stop your Way  That ye no more the Simple may betray  I could not but recite thus much of the Beginning and End of that Book which is so Excellent both for the Subject and Composure  that one may sooner Transcribe too little than too much the whole being well worth the Reading  In the Second Month he had a Concern upon his Spirit in a deep Sense of the Enemies working to sow Divisions and endeavouring to lay waste the Testimony of Truth to write an Epistle to  Friends  which he did very solidly and weightily to stir up Friends to Faithfulness and to beware of the Enemies Wiles and avoid that Rending Dividing Spirit which was then at work to cause Division and Strife among Friends which being so Seasonable and Excellent both for Matter and Stile the whole is thought meet to be here inserted at large and is as followeth  An EPISTLE to FRIENDS  DEAR Friends unto whom the gathering Arm of the Lord hath reached and who have known in your several Measures a being gathered thereby into the heavenly Life and are Witnesses of the preserving Power by which ye have been kept faithful to the Lord and regardful of his Honour Unto you in an especial manner is the Salutation of my true and tender Love in the Lord and for you as for my self are the Breathings and fervent Desires  of my Soul offered up in the One Spirit unto Him who is your God and mine that both you and I may be for ever kept in the fresh Sense of his tender Mercies and great Lovingkindness unto us that therein our Souls may cleave firmly unto Him and never depart from Him For Friends it is a trying Day a Day of great Difficulty and Danger wherein the Enemy is at work and very busie setting his Snares on every side and spreading his Temptations on every hand And some alas have entred thereinto and are caught and held therein for whom my Soul in secret mourns  And truly Friends a great weight hath been upon my Spirit for many Days and my Mind hath been deeply exercised in the sence I have of the Enemy's prevailing by one Bait or other to unsettle the Minds of some whom the Arm of the Lord had reached unto and in some measure gathered to a resting Place But not abiding in that pure Light by which they were at first visited and to which they were at first turned the  Understanding  hath been vailed again the  Eye  which was once in some measure opened hath the God of the World insensibly Blinded again and Darkness is again come over to that degree that they can now contentedly take up again what in the Day of their Convincement and in the time of their true Tenderness they cast off as a Burthen too heavy to be born O my Friends this hath been the Enemy's Work therefore it greatly behoves all to watch against him for it hath been for want  of Watchfulness that he hath got entrance into any For when the Mind hath been from off the true Watch in a secure and careless State then hath he secretly wrought and presented his fair Baits his Allurements or Enticements by Pleasure or Profit to catch the unwary Mind And hence it hath come to pass that some who have come out fairly and begun well and have seemed in good Earnest to have set their Hands to God's Plow have looked back and been weary of the Yoke of Christ and have either  lusted after the Fleshpots of Egypt  again or turned aside into some Bypath or crooked way in the Wilderness and thereby have fallen short of the promised good Land  But you my dear Friends in whom the Word of Life abides and who abide in the Vertue and Savour thereof ye know the Wiles of the Enemy and the Power which subdues him  nd the Rock in which the Preservation and  afety is So that I write not these things unto  ou because ye know them not But the End  f my thus writing is to stir up the pure Mind  n all upon whom the Name of the Lord is cal  ed that we all may be provoked to Watchful  ess against the Workings of the wicked One Therefore dear Friends bear I beseech you  he Word of Exhortation though from one  hat is little and low and through Mercy sensile of it and who hath not been accustomed  o appear after this manner For the Wind ye  now  bloweth where it listeth  Friends Call to Mind the former Times and remember the Days that are past and gone when the Day of the Lord first dawned unto you and his Power seized upon you Ye know how weighty and retired the Spirits of Friends then were how grave and solid their Deportment and Carriage how few and savoury their Words tending to edifie the Hearers how great a Fear and Backwardness was in them to enter into Familiarity with the World's People O Friends that was a good Day and tha  was a safe State for Fear begets Watchfulness  and Watchfulness is a means to prevent Danger  Therefore all Friends keep in the Holy Fear  and therein watch against the Enemy that h  entangle you not nor hurt your Spirits by a too near Familiarity and intimate Conversing with the People of the World for therein I assure you lies a Snare For though it be bot  lawful and necessary and in some Cases al  useful and serviceable to the Truth to Convers  with them that are without yet if any Frien  should adventure in a frank and free Mind  b  +yond the Limits of the pure Fear  to entertain F  +miliarity with the World's People the Spiri  of the World in them will  seek an Entrance  and  if not diligently watched against will also  g  an Entrance  and bring a hurt and a loss upo  him or them into whom it so gets For bein  once entred it will insensibly work and dis+pose the Mind into which it is got to a Conde+scention to and Compliance with the People o  the World it converses with first in one thing  then in another in  Words  in  Behaviour  c little things in Appearance but great in Consequence till at length an Indifferency gets up in the Mind and the Testimony of Truth by degrees is let fall But while the pure Fear is kept to and dwelt in the Watch is always set the Spirit is retired and weighty and an holy Awfulness rests upon the Mind which renders such Converse both safe to the Friends and more serviceable to them they converse withal  And Friends not only in your conversing with the World's People but in all your Conversation and Course of Life watch against the Spirit of the World for it lies near to tempt and to draw out the mind and to lead back into the World again You know Friends that at the first when the visiting Arm of the Lord reached to us he led us out of the World's  Ways Manners Customs  and  Fashions  and a close Testimony both in Word and Practice was born against them But how hath this Testimony been kept up and kept to by all who have since made Profession of the Truth Ah how hath the Enemy  for want of Watchfulness  stole in upon too too many and led out their Minds from that which did at first Convince them into a Liberty beyond the Cross of Christ Jesus and in that Liberty they have run into the Worlds Fashions which the worldly Spirit continually invents to feed the vain and airy Minds withal that they may not come to Gravity and Solidity  Thence it hath come to pass that there is scarce a  New Fashion  come up or a  Fantastick Cut  invented but some one or other that professes Truth is ready with the foremost to run into it Ah Friends the World sees this and smiles and  points the Finger at it  And this is both a Hurt to the particular and a Reproach to the general Therefore O let the Lot be cast let Search be made by every one and let every one Examine himself that this  Achan  with his  Babylonish Garment  may be found out and cast out for indeed he is a  Troubler of Israel  And all Friends who upon true search shall find your selves concerned in this particular I warn and exhort you all Return to that which at first Convinced you to that keep close in that abide that therein ye may know as at the first not only a  Bridle to the Tongue  but a  Curb to the roving Mind  a  Restraint to the wandring Desire  For assuredly Friends if Truth be kept to none will need to learn of the World what to wear what to put on or how to shape and fashion their Garments but Truth will teach all how best to answer  the End of Cloathing  both for  useful Service  and  modest Decency  And the Cross of Christ will be a Yoke to the unruly Will and a Restraint upon the wanton Mind and will Crucifie that Nature that delights in  Finery  and in  Bravery of Apparel  in which the true adorning doth not stand but  in the hidden Man of the Heart in that which is not corruptible  even  a meek and quiet Spirit  Pet And the Grace of God which  hath appeared to all and which hath brought Salvation to many will not only teach  to deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts and to live soberly righteously and godly in this present World  Titus but will also lead those that obey it out of all Excess and out of all Superfluities and worldly Vanities and will teach them to order their Conversation aright Therefore to this heavenly Grace let every Mind be turned and therein stay'd that thereby all who profess the Truth may be kept in the holy Limits of it that in their whole Conversation and Course of Life in Eating in Drinking in putting on Apparel and in whatsoever else we do or take in hand that all may be done to the Glory of God  Cor  that our Moderation in all things may appear unto all Men  And let not any deceive and hurt themselves with a False Plea saying  I will be left to my Liberty I have freedom to do go or wear so and so  And  Religion stands not in Cloths  c For that Liberty which the worldly Spirit leads into is not indeed the true Liberty but is a false and feigned Liberty which leads into true and real Bondage And though Religion stands not simply  n Cloths yet true Religion stands in that which  ets a  Bound  and  Limit  to the  Mind  with respect  o Cloths as well as to other things So that where there is a running out into  Excess  and  Va  ity  in Apparel that is a certain Indication and  oken that the  Mind is got loose  and hath cast off  he Yoke and is broke away from its due Sub  ction to that Divine Power in which the true  eligion stands  Great hath been the Hurt which the Enemy hath done in this Day by leading into a  false Freedom  and crying up a  wrong Liberty  for under this Pretence have crept in great Disorders some running out one way and some another some mixing in Marriages with the World's People and some going to the Priest to be married And many loose and unclean Spirits have shrouded themselves under this plausible Pretence of  being left to their Liberty  unto whom Truth's Order is irksome and uneasie and they kick against it and call it  Imposition  because it  checks their licentious Liberty  Therefore all who join with their Plea examine and try what Liberty it is ye claim and stand for for the true Liberty is not inconsistent with the Cross of Christ nor repugnant to his Yoke but agrees with it and is obtained through it and maintained by it And none whom the Son hath made free indeed will or can plead or make use of that Liberty in Opposition to any Means which the God of Order hath appointed or set up in his Church for the keeping out Confusion Disorder and Loosness And hereby all may take a right Measure and may certainly know  what kind of Liberty  that is which some have so hotly contended for in Opposition to that ne+cessary and commendable Order which God hath led his People into and which the Enemy  in his Agents labours so hard to lead them ou  of For the Enemy well knows that the Ten+dency and Service thereof is to detect and disco+ver his secret workings and to bring his Deeds t  Light and Judgment and therefore he strives with might and main to overturn it crying out through his Instruments  Away with your Order Let every one be left to his Liberty  By which seemingly fair and specious Plea not only the loose disorderly factious Spirits have been let up and encouraged to greater Boldness and Licentiousness but some simple and wellmeaning Friends also not seeing the Design of Satan therein have been misled thereby and made use of by the Enemy and the more subtle of his Instruments to oppose the good order of Truth Thus hath the Enemy wrought and sought to lay waste the Work of the Lord But the Lord magnified be his holy Name hath not been wanting to his People who in sincerity of Heart have diligently waited on him and trusted in him for he hath all along raised up some whose Eye he hath opened to see the Design and working of the Evil One and whose Spirits he hath engaged to stand up in a faithful Testimony against him  contending for the way of Truth  Which when they in whom the Enemy wrought perceived and found they could not run over the Heads of Friends and carry things on as themselves pleased they set themselves  in a heady wilful Spirit  to raise Disturbances in Meetings for Business by encouraging and abetting such heady loose contentious and disorderly Persons as wou'd join with them thus hardning themselves and provoking the Lord to give them up to Blindness and Hardness of Heart till at length the Enemy prevailed so far upon them  as to work them by degrees from  Discontent  to  Prejudice  then to  Enmity  and so at length in divers Places to an open  Defection Apostasy  and  Separation  Now although I know my dear Friends that ye who have  kept your Habitation in the Light of the Lord  and whose  Eye is single  therein have a clear Sight and Understanding that the Spirit which hath thus  wrought  and  fought against the Truth  is not nor can be of God but is of the  wicked One  and although the Fruits it hath brought forth through the Agents and Instruments in and by which it hath wrought  viz Making Disturbances in Meetings to the breaking the Churches Peace Causing Divisions amongst Friends Publishing to the World most wicked malicious railing and scandalous Books against Friend  an Effect of the greatest Enmity  shutting an  keeping Friends out of their common MeetingHou+ses in which they have a just Right and Property  and not suffering them to meet therein  which is a part of the Persecution inflicted on Friends by the World  and at length also set up separate Meetings in Opposition to the Meetings of God's People  Although I say these Fruits are sufficient o  themselves to discover and manifest to an  un+clouded Mind  what Spirit that is and mus  needs be which hath brought them forth ye  inasmuch as some partly through  Weakness o  Judgment  and partly through  personal Affectio  to some of those leading Separatists  are yet in dan+ger to be betrayed by their  fair Words and feign+ed Speeches wherewith they lie in wait to deceive  feel a Concern remain upon my Spirit in the Love of God to warn all such that they join not with nor give Countenance unto that Spirit that hath thus wrought against the Lord and against his People  For Friends in the holy Fear of the living God and in the Openings of the Spring of his pure Life in my Soul at this time and from the certain Knowledge and clear Demonstration which I have received from him therein I testifie and declare unto you That this Spirit which in this Day hath run out and hath drawn out some into Opposition against the Way and Work of the Lord into Division and Separation from the People of the Lord and from the holy Assemblies which the Lord hath gathered and by his powerful Presence hath owned and daily doth own This Spirit I say is the same with that which hath formerly wrought in other Appearances against the Truth in our time and is the same with that Spirit that wrought against the Work of the Lord in the Days of the Holy Apostles This Mystery of Iniquity then wrought and caused many to turn aside and to leave the right way of the Lord and to  forsake the Assemblies of God's People  Heb Yea and to run into  Separation  too  Jude  Upon whom the holy Ghost hath set his Brand that they were  Sensual having not the Spirit  And many close and sharp Testimonies did the Lord give forth through his Servants in that Day against this Spirit and against those that were joined to it  and acted by it as may be seen in the Holy Scriptures  Yea Friends this Spirit that hath led some now to set up their Separate Meetings is the same that led  Jeroboam  the Son of  Nebat  to set up his separate Altar at  Bethel  of which you may read  Kings  and Chapters He was afraid that if the People should continue to go up to the House of the Lord to do Sacrifice there as they had been accustomed to do and as the Lord had required they would then forsake him and return to the Lord again And this Spirit now is afraid that if they whom he hath seduced and drawn aside should still frequent the Assemblies of God's People and continue to meet with Friends as before that heavenly Power which is eminently manifest in the Meetings of God's People might at one time or other reach unto them touch their Hearts open the right Eye in them and give them to see the Mischief and misery he is leading them into And therefore to prevent this and to keep his Captives close unto him he hath contrived to set up Separate Meetings in Opposition to the Meetings of God's Appointment as  Jeroboam  set up his Separate Altar in Opposition to the Altar which God hath commanded to be set up and to keep the People from going thereto And so subtilly did this Spirit work then as well as now that  Jeroboam  contrived to have his false Worship bear some Resemblance to the true that he might the more easily beguile the People For he ordained a  Feast like unto the Feast that was in Judah  Kings But it was  in the Month which he had devised of his own Heart  ver Mark that there is a Blot upon it How fair or specious soever the Worship he set up appeared or seemed to be yet it was but the  Devise of his  own  Heart  it was neither appointed by God nor accepted of God For you may read in the th Chapter that the Lord sent a Prophet a Man of God out of  Judah  to  Bethel  and he cryed against the Altar in the Word of the Lord and prophesied the Destruction thereof by  Josiah  which was afterwards outwardly fulfilled as you may read  Kings    c  Now  Josiah  signifies  The Fire  or  Burning of the Lord  And in the holy Dread of the living Eternal God I declare The Fire of the Lord is kindled and kindling against this accursed separating Spirit and against its Work and against all those that join with it therein Therefore all Fear before the Mighty God and stand still and consider your Ways and let none resist or reject the Warning of the Lord lest such be hardned to Destruction For  Jeroboam  you may read stood by his separate Altar vers  And when he heard the saying of the Man of God which he cryed against the Altar in  Bethel  he put forth his Hand saying Lay hold on him  But  his Hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him  vers O Friends consider How hath Driness and Withering come upon many a great and stout One in this Day who have lifted up themselves against  the Lord and have sought by the  De+vices of their own Hearts  to establish themselves in their own Way against the Way of the Lord so that the Hand they have put forth in that Work they could not pull in again Now mind I pray you Friends and observe the way of the working of this Spirit in that Day Here was the Enmity the rough Nature of  Cain  and  Esau  the Spirit of  Persecution  got up first in  Jeroboam  to dismay the Man of God  Lay hold of him  says he But when he saw that would not do then the subtle Serpent the crafty Fox the fair Speeches the smooth Words the seeming Friendship and shew of Kindness to betray him  Come home with me  says he to the Man of God  and refresh thy self and I will give thee a Reward  vers O Friends stand in the Fear and Counsel of the Lord and in the Dominion of his Power over this wicked Spirit in all its Twistings and Twinings Let neither the Frowns nor the Fawnings the Threats nor the Flatteries the hard Speeches nor the Oyly Words the Pharisaical Friendship the dissembling Love the seeming Kindness the familiar Carriage the free Entertainment the fine Bit the Offer of Advantages  c  have any Influence upon you to draw you in the least measure to join or touch with God's Enemy with him that sets up a separate Altar a separate Meeting in Opposition to and to draw or keep from the right Way of the Lord Mind well the Answer which the Man of God gave to  Jeroboam  's tempting Invitation  If  said he  thou wilt give me half thine House I  ill not go in with thee neither will I eat Bread nor  rink Water in this Place  ver This was where  he Separate Altar was set up And he gives  forcible Reason for it  For so it was charged  by the Word of the Lord  Vers  Here now you see both the Charge of the Lord and the good Resolution of the Man of God I will not go in with thee who hast re  olted from God neither will I eat or drink in  is Place where an Ensign of Separation and Opposition to the way of God is set up Con  der this well I warn you All in whom there  yet any true Breathings after the living God  ho retain any Tenderness and in whom there  any Simplicity left Consider this well I say  hen thy pretended Friend or Friends in a  eat deal of seeming Love and Kindness shall  vite thee to partake with them at their Separ  e Altar to sit down with them in their Se  rate Meeting Thou canst not be a Man of  od and go in with them or eat or drink in  at Place Thou canst not sit down there to  ait for the Bread of Life or the Water of  ife to be given thee there No the Word of  e LORD if thou givest heed unto it will  arge thee otherwise Therefore to that pure  ing Word let every Mind be turned and  ereto kept in a diligent Waiting to receive Wisdom Strength and Power from the Lord  erein that none may be betrayed by the  btilty of the the Enemy with whatsoever  ir pretences he may come For remember  how the Man of God that was enticed by a  +other to eat and drink outwardly at  Bethel  t  place where the separate Altar was set up lo  his outward Life therefore ver and  And if thou shalt presume to go in to eat o  to drink spiritually that is to join in Worshi  with the Sons of  Nebat  at this Day in the s  +parate Meetings which any of them have s  up in Opposition to the Assemblies of God  People and to the Blessed Way and Work  the Lord how knowest thou but thou may  for ever lose thy spiritual Life and never kno  a Day of Quickning more  Therefore all Friends watch against eve  Temptation thereunto as you love your Liv  as you regard the Good and Eternal Welfare  your Souls and let not the Name nor Pers  of any Man have Power over you to dra  you aside neither let  Numbers  sway with yo  in which I know these Adversaries of Tru  do not a little boast though blessed be G  with little Reason But remember that  Je  +boam  of Old had Ten Tribes out of Twelve  cry up his separate Altar Notwithstandi  which he is branded to Posterity in the H  Record with this Brand  Jeroboam the Son  Nebat WHO MADE ISRAEL TO S  Kings Therefore let not any foll  a Multitude to do  Evil  Exod But  follow that which is Good both among your selv  and to all Men  Thess For Friends y  know whither the  Broad  Way leads and w  it is the  Wide  Gate opens into which  MANY  go in at but keep ye to the  Straight  Gate and walk ye on in the  NARROW  Way for in it is Safety and at the End of it everlasting Happiness  But Friends because of the Straightness of this Gate and the Narrowness of this Way some that have attempted to walk in it are grown weary of it and have sought out another way a way which  Jeroboam  like they have devised of their own Hearts wherein they may have more Room more Scope more Company Ease in the Flesh Liberty to the Flesh and all without controul And this I am satisfied hath not been the least Motive to the Separation in this Day as it was the greatest in Days past tho' some that have been drawn into it may not perhaps see the Ground upon which it was undertaken But the Lord hath opened an Eye in many which sees the Rise and Ground Entrance and End of this libertine Spirit and its Work And this Eye will the Lord daily open more and more in all that diligently and in Sincerity wait upon Him Therefore all Friends every where who have not yet a clear Sight and a thorow Understanding of the Nature and Work Design and Drift of this dividing Spirit wait I beseech you in Simplicity of Heart and Lowliness of Mind upon the Lord and keep to the Measure of the Grace you have received from him and suffer not your Minds to be swayed or byassed by any personal Kindness natural Affection Relation Kindred or Acquaintance but stand single and  open to the Lord not joining to nor any way countenancing that which the Testimony of Truth in the Arisings of the heavenly Life and Breakings forth of the divine Power thro' any goes forth against So will your present Standing be safe and you be preserved out of the Snares of this insinuating and treacherous Spirit And the Lord in his appointed time as ye abide with him will open your Understandings further and give you a clearer Sight of that which at present you do not fully see and thereby bring you to that Certainty and Assurance which blessed be his Name he hath brought many unto  And you my dear Friends whose Spirits the Lord hath stirred up and whose Hearts he hath engaged in an Holy Zeal to stand up for his Blessed Name and Truth and to bear a faithful Testimony against this wicked rending Spirit go on in the Strength and Power of the Lord in the Might of the God of  Jacob  for you are assuredly on the Lord's Side and the Lord  Jehovah  the Strength of  Israel  is on your Side Therefore Friends be encouraged in the Lord to stand stedfast in your Testimony not giving way to the Enemy no not for a Moment And take heed I beseech you in the Love of God how ye enter into any Treaty of Peace or Terms of Agreement with this Ungodly Treacherous Spirit which is out of the Truth and draws out of the Truth and Fights against the Truth For there is no Peace unto it saith my God And they who have  joined themselves unto it and have wickedly given themselves up to be acted by it and to act for it must pass through the River of Judgment if ever they be redeemed from under its Power Friends Condemnation must first be felt and owned before Reconciliation can be known and the Fire of the Lord must pass upon the Transgressor to consume the Works of Darkness the ungodly Deeds the envious reviling Speeches the wicked malicious slanderous Books and Pamphlets  c  and to burn up the Ground from whence they sprang For a flaming Sword hath the Lord God set in his  Eden  which turneth every Way and none that are gone out can ever come in again but they must pass under the flaming Edge thereof Therefore my dear Friends stand your Ground in the Authority of the heavenly Life and tamper not with God's Enemies Remember the Word of the Lord to the Prophet  Let them return unto thee but return not thou unto them  Jer And then what follows  I will make thee unto this People a fenced brazen Wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the Lord  ver So the God of Life fill your Hearts daily more and more with a  Phineas Zeal  for the Honour of his Name and furnish you abundantly with Wisdom and Counsel with Boldness and Courage with Strength and Power to encounter and overcome the Enemy And make every one more watchful against the Spirit of the World to  withstand it in all its Allurements to Vanity of whatsoever kind that whatsoever would defile the Camp of the Lord may be purged out and kept out that the Lord may more and more delight in his People and shower down his Blessings upon them which is the fervent desire of  Your faithful Friend in the Love and Service of the unchangeable Truth  Thomas Ellwood  The    th of the    d Month    After this I do not find he writ any thing only some private Letters in his  Decades  but lived Retired till the Year In wich time of Privacy as fittest for it he began a Work which he did not finish till many Years after and that was  The Life of  David  King of  Israel in Verse which he began for his own Diversion not thinking then of Printing it and carried it on to the End of the Third Book But then the  Prince of Orange  Landing and the Revolution following the Nation being in Arms against King  James  the Noise of Guns and Sound of Drums  c  so desturbed his Meditation and gentle Muse which like the  Halcion  breeds in Calm Weather that his Poetical Genius left him for a time and he thereupon left his Work for above Twenty Years of which more hereafter in its Place  And here he retired again for two Years so that I find nothing to Remark of him either publick or private but some private Letters  till the Year When  John Raunce  and  Charles Harris  of  Wiccomb  in that County publishing  A Memorial  as they call'd it  for the present Generation and also for that which is to come Being an Account from  Wiccomb  concerning the Difference  c This  Thomas Ellwood  answered in a Book intituled  The Account from  Wiccomb  lately published by  John Raunce  and  Charles Harris  examined and found false And a Warning thereof given to all such wellmeaning Persona among the People called  Quakers  as through Personal Affection want of Consideration or Weakness of Judgment have been betrayed or may be in danger to be betrayed by them or any other in the same dividing Spirit with them and led aside from the Way of Truth into a Separation from the People of God For whose Recovery and Preservation this is written  Which begins thus  'For your sakes it is O ye much pittied Ones more than for any weight in the Account it self or worth in the Authors of it that I have thus taken notice of it For indeed as soon as I had perused it I felt a compassionate Concern spring in my Heart on your behalfs and a direction in Spirit to open some Passages therein and relating thereto to you that ye might be preserved from being taken Or if in any measure taken might be rescued and delivered from the Snare which the Enemy of your Souls and of all Righteousness hath made use of these Men to set to entangle entrap and catch you by And to the true Witness of the Holy God in  every one of your Consciences who retain any honest Breathings after the Lord and the Way of Holiness do I recommend this my Undertaking and the Sincerity of my Intention herein  Wherein he discovered their Deceit as to their Separation and that it was not for Conscience but from a libertine Spirit to lay waste the good Order in the Church as their Actions manifested Of which he gave some Instances not to their Advantage But their Works have made them manifest  The next Book he published was in viz  A Reply to an Answer lately published to a Book long since written by  W Penn  Intituled A brief Examination and State of Liberty Spiritual both with respect to Persons in their private Capacity and in their Church Society and Conversation  Which Book was written or at least published by  W Penn  in the Year To distinguish between true and false Liberty little understood by some and too frequently abused by others Liberty from Sin not to Sin to do his God's Will and not our own as  W P  expresses it Which true spiritual Liberty being abused by some in the Profession of the Truth as our Friend  T E  observes in his Preface  'Who under pretence of being left to that Liberty in themselves and to their own Freedom therein both took Liberty to do such things as were inconsistent with that true Liberty and with the Principle of Truth which they professed and despising those useful good and necessary Helps and Means which  the Lord hath provided and furnished his Church and People with for the preventing and keeping out such Disorders Evils and Scandals as the unruly Nature of Man thro' such a Mistake of true Liberty might and would bring in Did reject the Counsel Admonition or Reproof of their Brethren with  What hast thou to do with me Leave me to my own Freedom  To reclaim if it might be those who are thus deceived and prevent others from being so the Author being pressed in Spirit for  Zion  's sake and for the Peace of  Jerusalem  and having a deep Sense as himself expresses of the working of the Enemy of  Zion  's Peace to rend and divide the Heritage of God did write the forementioned Treatise for the Establishment of the Faithful Information of the Simplehearted and Reproof of the Arrogant and Highminded  Which striking at the false Liberty and Pre  ences of the Separate Party it seems it had  ain on their Stomachs undigested these Ten Years and then came forth an Answer to it by  J H  supposed to be  John Hog  one of the Se  arates about  Hull  This Answer our Friend  T Ellwood  undertakes and replies to in a pretty  arge Book in which he shews what is meant  y true spiritual Liberty in  W P  's own Defi  ition which he defends shews their Abuse  f it answers their Arguments or rather Ca  ils against it in behalf of their false libertine  pirit and Practices which too many ran into  their own Hurt and Separation from the  Church the Body of Christ whereof He is Head saying in the  Preface  'The God of Truth knows I have no other End in this Reply than to defend Truth and the Children of it against the slanderous Suggestions false Charges and wicked Insinuation of the Adversaries to lay open their deceitful Dealing and to remove as the Lord shall enable me the stumbling Blocks which they have laid in the Way of the Weak whereby they have caused some to fall into Misapprehensions and hard Thoughts of Friends without Cause And I beseech the God of Mercy to open the Understandings and clear the Sight of all those whose Simplicity has been betrayed by the others Subtilty that they may see and escape the Enemies Snares and return to the true Fold from which they have been led astray  To which I never heard of any Rejoinder only some private Letters past between  J H  and  T E  about some Passages in it  His next were two Broadsides the first in  viz  T E's  Answer to so much of  Leonard Key  's late Printed Sheet as relates to him  Which Paper of  L K  's was intended mostly to excuse their shutting Friends out of their MeetingHouse at  Reading  But therein taking Occasion to slant at some Passages in  T E  's Answer to the Account from  Wiccomb  gave our Friend  Thomas  an Occasion not only to open that Matter further but also to lay open their Deceit in Relation to that Affair as well as  L K  's and his Party at  Reading  To which I refer the Reader  The Second was in  viz Deceit discovered and Malice manifested in  L Key  's late Paper from  Reading  Thomas  being then at  London  at the YearlyMeeting met with  B Coal's Expedients for a true Reconciliation among the People of God called  Quakers Which  L K  it seems promoted But when  T E  came home he found a Letter at his House directed to him from  L K  with a Printed Sheet inclosed so different in Terms and Tendency from the other sign'd by  B C  and  C H  that proposing Expedients for Peace this renewing the Difference and yet but one Day different in the Dates this being dated the d the other the th of the th Month that he could not but admire at it which therefore he compares and shews the Difference of and discovers their Deceit in and not only in that but also in Relation to the Difference at  Wiccomb  which they were not yet easie under and yet would not confess the Truth but instead thereof  J Raunce  endeavours to fix a Slander on  T Ellwood  about his Father's Burial pretending he was not Buried in the right Ground but among Strangers he and his Party Riding Twenty Miles or more about the Country and  J R  going himself to the place where he was Buried at  Holton  to pick up a Stone at the Father's Grave to throw at the Son above seven Years after his Death enquiring examining yea provoking some to pretend as if  T E  had been unkind to his Father and that they had shewed  him Kindness to bring  Thomas  under Obligation of Requital or upbraid him for Ingratitude if he did not In all which  J R  's Malice was manifest more than any thing else for as to the Ground he was buried in  T E  confesses he was not so well acquainted with the GraveYard as to know the Difference of Places in it or whether some Parts of it be more Holy than others which he thinks considering their former Principles they should not have quarrel'd with him about However the Place was not of his appointing for he was prevented of being at the Burial by a Message his Father received in his Sickness that his Sister but which of them he doth not say lay then Sick in  London  near unto Death After he had waited on his Father until he had finished his Life and given Direction for his Interrment he hastened up to his Sister at  London  thinking he might be more serviceable to the Living than to the Dead and knew not in what Part of the Ground his Father was buried till after his Return from  London  he went thither to defray the Charges of his Sickness and Funeral as some of them knew and therefore the more shame to raise such a Story And as to the other of Unkindness they could prove nothing but shew their Envy against him which we shall have Occasion to take further notice of e're we have done  The next and last Book he writ in Relation to this Controversie with the Separates was  A fair Examination of a foul Paper called  Observations and Reflections  c lately published by  John  Raunce  and  Leonard Key who after their separate Bickerings come now to join their Forces together in this Paper which seems to be Reflections on  T E  's last mentioned Paper and which Paper of theirs our Friend answers in this Examination wherein  their Envy is rebuked and their Folly and Falshood laid open  in endeavouring to excuse  L K  's former Paper of Revival of the Difference at the same time when  B C  's Expedient for Reconciliation was for having it all forgotten and buried which  T E  exposes in its proper Colours beginning thus  'We read among the  Proverbs  of  Solomon  that  the Way of the Wicked is as Darkness they know not at what they Stumble  Prov This is verified in  J Raunce  and  L Key  and others of their separate Party Since their turning against the Truth their way is become as Darkness they stumble and know not at what They fall into many idle Absurdities many gross Follies and Errors and into many hurtful Evils and labour to draw others better than themselves after them for whose sake chiefly the following Lines are written that the Deceit and Hypocrisie of these Men their Falshood and Envy being further and further laid open the more Simple and Wellmeaning Ones amongst them may see them as they are and be no longer beguiled by them  So he goes on to Answer their Cavils confirming by Certificate his former Charge of their scandalous Practice at  Wiccomb  then answers their new Slander the old proving false  That he suffered  his Father to want  raking into his Ash  when he had been dead above Ten Years to ca  something at his Son so restless is Envy as if h  had been short in his Duty to his Father whic  T E  fairly and clearly wipes off vindicating himself as to his not being at his Father's Bu+rial which  J R  throws at him though  Thoma  in his last had fairly related the Occasion which was his Sister's Ilness at  London  though she recovered and which one would think might have satisfied any one not overgrown with Envy which yet  J R  revives again and also about his Burial  c  All which appears to be nothing but  J R  's Rancor which seeing he has made so much ado about out of his Inveterate Malice to  T E  under pretence of Friendship to his Father but to be sure Hatred to the Son and as  T E  says  If this be the Effect of his Friendship he should not desire to be numbred among his Friends  To set which in a clear Light I shall here set down his Vindication in his own Words because it bears some Analogy to his Relation of the former part of his Life  viz  Pag of the Fair  Examination  'Tis well known to many that my Father was possest of a good Estate and they that knew him well knew also that he had the spending of it himself How he spent it becomes not me to speak he was my Father to whom I ow'd and always paid Respect and Honour while living and whose Frailty being dead I desire to cover It is enough for me to say I did not help him spend his Estate nor was  I much chargeable to him after I was capable of shifting for my self And when it pleased the Lord to visit me with the saving Knowledge of his Truth and bring me under the visible Characters of the Profession thereof which was about the th Year of my Age my Father expressing a dislike to me on that Account by degrees withdrew his Care of me not making any Provision for my Maintenance save the giving me such of his Houshold Goods as he could spare upon his giving over HouseKeeping though he had then a plentiful Estate remaining When afterwards he Sold his Estate I had no part at all of the Money  Though upon his Marriage he promised both him and his intended Wife to do something considerable for them yet after they were Married he refused to give them any thing as aforesaid p and so far withdrew himself that he would not let him know where he lodged  'Notwithstanding this says  T E  he would sometimes come to my House which was always open and free to him to come when he pleased and to tarry as long as he pleased whenever he came he was well Habitted both for Linnen and Woolen and made no Appearance of Want other than such as may befal any Man to have his Money fall short in a Journey upon which Occasion when he had as he said been longer from home than he expected or when being here he had a mind to go further than at his coming forth he intended he  has divers times asked me to lend him Money  which I always did and never asked him fo  it again And to the best of my Remem+brance it was not above two Weeks time be+fore his last Sickness that he had been at my House and had Money of me on that Account  As soon as I heard of his Ilness I hastened t  him and took the best Care of him I could during his Life and after his Death defrayed the Charge of his Sickness and Burial and re+paid to my Sister that Money she had sen  him before I knew of his Ilness I could say more on this Subject than I intend or at pre+sent think fit But I forbear and commit my Innocent Cause to the Lord not doubting but that as I am clear in his Sight from any Undutifulness or Unkindness towards my Father so he will clear mine Innocency in the Hearts of his People and of all unprejudiced Persons  This I hope will satisfie the Reader of  T E  's Carriage towards his Father which we are beholding to  J R  for or else perhaps might never have had this Account which one would think Envy it self should not be able to cavil at▪ yet after this  J R  being restless trumpt up another Story answered by  T E  in his Postscript to that Book which we shall meet with again hereafter on another Occasion and therefore I shall say no more of it here  Here ends his Controversie with the  Separates  In which I must needs say he acquitted himself  as an Ingenuous Man a Christian and a fair Opponent And now to come to something more pleasant Our dear Friend  G Fox  dying  n the  Eleventh Month  and leaving be  ind him an excellent Journal of his Travels  nd Sufferings our Friend  T E  as no body fit  er about this time was at the Pains of Tran  cribing it and fitting it for the Press A Labo  ious Work Which was Printed next Year in  large Folio To which  T E  prefixed a nota  le Account concerning him which is the only  ingle Testimony Printed with it except his Wifes  M F  's and an Excellent Preface by  W Penn  But now a new Scene opens for  George Keith  who had known better things than most Oppo  ers that ever rose up against Truth and  Friends  aving been a  Quaker  and a  Preacher  among  hem near  Thirty Years  and had writ many Books in  Vindication  of  Truth  and  Friends  but  ow falling out and differing with some of his Brethren in  Pennsylvania  whither he went some Years before because he could not have his own way in every thing came over with some of his Party full fraught with Contention against the  YearlyMeeting  Which difference coming  efore the Meeting by some Letters from be  ond Sea which were read in Course in the Meeting whereupon  G K  desired to be heard which after the other Business of the Meeting was over Friends condescended to for several Days to hear him and his Party and  S Jen  ings  c on the other Side in hopes to have  econciled the Difference before it went any further  But as the Prophet  Hos  said  Wh  I would have healed Israel then the Iniquity of  +phraim was discover'd  c which may be applie  to him for the more Endeavours were used  reconcile him to his Brethren the more his D  +ceit appear'd and the more Tenderness an  shewed towards him the more perverse he wa  in turning it to a wrong Use and strengt  +ening himself in his Opposition There was  holding what would away as the Proverb is Resolved he was for a Breach by opposin  Friends more and more till he ran himself qui  out from among them Which our Friend  T  observing the bent and tendency of not only i  the  YearlyMeeting  but after and how he e  +deavoured to make Divisions among Friends  divide the Heritage of God He took up  Pen again and writ an Excellent  Epistle  Friends briefly Commemorating the gracious Dea  +ings of the Lord with them and warning them  beware of that Spirit of Contention and Divisio  which hath appeared of late in  George Keith  which he Addresses to Friends thus  'Dear Friends whom the Lord hath calle  with an Holy Calling and who throug  Faithfulness to the heavenly Call are becom  the Chosen of the Lord It is in my Hear  in the Openings of the Love of God to se  these few Lines amongst you as a Salutatio  of true and hearty Love unto you and in th  tendering Sense of the Lord's Unspeakab  Goodness unto us which at this time rest  with an affecting Weight upon my Spiri  briefly to Commemorate the Gracious Dealings of the Lord with us since we have been a People  Which he Commemorates as follows  'Great and manifold have been the Mercies of our God unto his People in this his Day and his Loving Kindnesses are beyond expressing when we were young and little his fatherly Care was over us he preserved us and nourished us and caused us to grow up before him How did he carry his Lambs in his Bosom when the Beasts of Prey roar'd on every side seeking to devour Who can rehearse the many Deliverances he hath wrought for his People in their Passage from Spiritual  Egypt  How hath he girded their Loins with Strength and covered their Heads in the Day of Battle How hath he subdued their Enemies before them and put to flight the Armies of Aliens How hath he fed them with Bread from Heaven and made them to suck Honey out of the Rock Yea he hath caused the Rock to give forth Water abundantly and hath been to his People as a Brook in the way and  the Shadow of a mighty Rock in a weary Land  So that from a sencible Experience we can say to his Praise Our Bread hath been sure and our Water hath not failed as we have singly relied on him Oh his Goodness is unutterable and his Faithfulness hath never failed them that have trusted in him when have we ever been in Prison for his sake and he hath not visited and comforted us there What Sufferings have any undergone on his Account and he  hath not abundantly recompenced the Loss  Nay hath he not often stopped the Mouths o  Lions and reproved Rulers for the sake of hi  People saying  Touch not mine Anointed an  do my Prophets no harm  In all our Exercises h  hath been with us and he hath stood by us i  our sorest Trials yea he hath caused his An+gel to encamp round about us so that no Wea+pon formed against us hath prospered but e+very Tongue that hath risen up against us the Lord hath given us Power to condemn blessed be his holy Name and exalted and magnified be his Glorious Power for ever  'These things and much more than I can write I doubt not but ye my dear Friends are Witnesses of ye especially my elder Brethren who were called early in the Morning of this Day and have stood faithful in your Te+stimony for God until now who from your own both early and late Experiences can set your Seals to the Truth hereof and unto you I do believe this brief Commemoration of the Goodness and LovingKindness of the Lord to his People will be pleasing and delightful as I hope it may prove useful and profitable unto us all in the stirring up of the  Pure Mind  and putting us in fresh Remembrance of the Lord's manifold Favours towards us and gracious Dealings with us which should be as a renewed Engagement upon us to cleave fast unto the Lord and in Humility of Heart to walk closely with him both that we may as far as in us lies answer his great lovingKindness  to usward and receive from him still daily Strength and Ability to stand and withstand the Assaults and Temptations of the Enemy and escape his Snares wherewith he is at this time as busie and Industrious to betray and draw aside from the Simplicity of the Truth as ever he was  'For Friends ye know we have a restless Adversary to watch against and to war with one that sometimes walks about as a  Roaring Lion  seeking whom he may devour and sometimes creeps about as a  subtil Serpent  seeking whom he may betray whom in each Appearance it is our Duty and Interest to resist stedfast in the Faith which overcomes I need not recount unto you my Friends the many Winds and Floods Storms and Tempests of open and cruel  Persecutions  which this roaring Adversary hath often raised and and caused to beat upon us to have driven us if possible from off our Foundation ye cannot have forgotten it nor that noble  Arm of the Lord  which was made bare for our Preservation and by preserving us against the most furious Shocks gave Evidence even to the World that we are that People whose House is founded and built upon the immoveable Rock  Christ Jesus  At this sort of Fighting the Enemy hath been foiled which hath made him shift his Hand and like a cunning Hunter  spread his Nets  set his Snares lay his Baits to catch the simple and unwary Ones Thus wrought this subtil Enemy in the early  times of Christianity sometimes stirring up the Rulers both  Jews  and  Gentiles  to fall with violent and bloody Hands upon the little Flock of Christ and sometimes in the Intermissions of those Storms covering his Hooks with the taking Baits of  Pleasure Profit  and  Preferment  catch some perhaps of those that had withstood the strongest Storm of outward Persecution and made them Instruments for himself to work by to betray others Such was  Diotrephes  of old whose aspiring Mind loving and seeking  Praeeminence  laboured to make a  Schism  in the Church prating against even the Elders thereof  with malicious Words  c John What Mischief the wicked One hath wrought in our Day by such  ambitious Spirits  I need not recount nor is it pleasing to me to remember ye know it to your Grief as well as I But this in all such Cases is observable that such as have made  Disturbances  in the Church and have run into  Divisions  and  Separations  from Friends have framed to themselves some specious Pretence or other as the Inducement to their Undertaking which they have Industriously spread abroad and varnished over with the fairest Colours they could to allure and draw others to join with them  c  This with much more to the same purpose which might be cited I thought meet to mention of the Mercies of the Lord to his People and Preservation of them from the Beginning well worth the Reading Then recounting the  Wiles and Workings of the Enemy in drawing some aside from the Simplicity of the Truth and stirring them up to make Divisions on one Pretence or other to disturb the Peace of the Church and hinder the Work of the Lord in the Earth as lately in the Separates so now being disappointed in that he hath formed a new Design in  G Keith  yet to shew the difference between the former and this and consequently the Confusion of their Pretences  Theirs  relating to  Discipline This  to  Doctrine They  alledged  That Friends were gone too much from the Inward to the Outward  This  That Friends were gone too much from the Outward to the Inward  c for our Adversaries seldom agree in their Charges And so he goes on to examine and compare his Books published beyond Sea with those he writ here as to the Ground of the Difference and Separation which he lays at his Door manifesting his deceitful Pretences Falacies and SelfContradictions Answering his Cavils and confuting his Calumnies that none might be deceived by him Concluding by way of Application and Warning to Friends to beware of the Enemies Wiles which I doubt not had a good Effect as to many in preserving them out of the Enemies Snare who were in danger of being stagger'd by him  When our Friend  T Ellwood  had written this Epistle he went up to  London  with it and presented it to the  SecondDays MorningMeeting  where such Books and Writings of Friends as are intended for the Press use to be read and  consider'd and read it through in that Meeting and not one Friend though the Meeting was pretty full shewed any Disunity therewith but approved it and left it to him to publish it And yet  G Keith  pretended that it was Printed in great Disunity and against the mind of many Friends as though it was only approved and promoted by a Party  c  Which I mention to shew that he stuck at nothing to make good his Part  Against this Book of  T E  's  G K  made a heavy Complaint to Friends to have it called in as very injurious to him to his Cause to be sure Poor Man who had writ so many Books against Friends after he had writ so many for them and would not take Friends Advice himself and how then could he expect they should answer him So that his Complaint and Clamour not prevailing to stifle it he takes another way first putting out a Sheet against it called a  Loving Epistle  but envious enough In which he charged  T E  with  Fifty Pervertions  c which he said he had noted in his Book but left his Proofs behind to come after  The first by Post  as the Proverb is  the second by Tom Long the Carrier  in another Book which he threatned to Publish if  T E  's was not called in and disowned which not prevailing neither some Weeks after he sent forth his threatned Book miscalled  A Seasonable Information  c but very unseasonable for himself as to his Reconciliation with Friends which he pretended he had rather lay down his natural Life or have his  Right Hand cut off than be disunited or disjointed from them This Book he pretended to be an Answer to  T E  's Epistle and to contain his Proofs such as they were of the Charge he had published before To both these our Friend  T Ellwood  replied this Year In a Book intituled  A further Discovery of that Spirit of Contention and Division which hath appeared of late in  George Keith  c wherein his Cavils are Answered his Falshood is laid open and the Guilt and Blame of the Breach and Separation in  America  c are fixed faster on him written by way of Epistle  as the former was  and recommended as a farther Warning to Friends  Which begins thus  'Dear Friends who have received the Truth in the Love of it and have kept your Habitation therein unto whom the Truth is exceeding precious and who desire the Prosperity thereof above all things unto you is the Salutation of my endeared Love in this blessed Truth in which the Fellowship of the Faithful stands In this it is I desire to know you to be known by you and to have Fellowship with you earnestly breathing to the God of Truth the Father of Spirits that he would be pleased to pour forth more abundantly of his Good Spirit into all our Hearts and fill us with the blessed Fruits thereof that there may be no room for the Enemy to enter to break this Holy Fellowship But that all who profess to believe in the Light may so walk therein that a clear Sight they may  have thereby and a true Discerning between things that differ and may be able to make a right Judgment what is of God and what is not that so the design of that Spirit by whatsoever Instrument it works which would break or disturb the Churches Peace and cast Reproach upon the Heritage of God may be so discovered and laid open that all may see and shun it As this is the Exercise and Travel of my Spirit so it is the Service I have been of late and am at present engaged in For Friends 'tis not many Months since I saluted you with an Epistle wherein my Spirit was drawn forth  briefly to Commemorate the gracious Dealings of the Lord with his People  and as in a general way to remind you of the many Attempts the Enemy hath made by Force and Fraud to hinder the Work of God from going on so more particularly to warn you  to beware of that Spirit of Contention and Division which hath appeared of late in  George Keith  and some few others that join with him who have made a Separation from Friends in some parts of  America In writing that Epistle I did not consult Flesh and Blood neither had I an Eye to my own Ease and Quit as outwardly for I had no Reason to expect Rest from so restless a Man nor fair Treatment from One who in his late Writings and Personal Debates hath so notoriously let loose his Pen and Tongue to an  unbridled Liberty  of Railing and Reviling But I clear'd my Conscience in discharging my Duty to God and to his Church and  therein have that Peace which all his Abuses cannot disturb  And so he proceeds to clear himself of the Perversions  c  which  G K  charged him with and answers all his Cavils against his Book manifesting his Deceit Evasions and Sophistry so effectually that I do not find that  G Keith  ever replied to it being answered home and having his Belly full I suppose of the Controversie with  T Ellwood  for though our Friend  Thomas  answered several other of  G Keith  's Books afterwards of which hereafter he never replied to any of them which shews he had enough of it  At the end of this Book of  G Keith  's  J Raunce  came forth again with a new Slander against  T E  all his old ones being bafled as if his Father had not been buried decently which however False  G K  's  mean Mind it seems could not resist  J R  's slight Offer to take off an Hundred of his Books but rather glad of any Help to run down his Opponent if he could with Slander which he found he could not do with Arguments but had  G K  been a Man of any Worthiness  says T E  or his Cause defensible he would not though an Adversary have suffer'd  J R  to have clapt on his Abusive Piece at the end of his Book to throw Dirt at his Opponent And had  J R  been a manly Adversary he would have scorn'd to have crept in at the Tail of another's Book to renew his Slander no way relating to the Subject of the Book  when  T E's Fair Examination  had lain a TwelveMonth at his Door unanswered But to creep behind such  a mickle Man as  G K  was taken to be  J R  perhaps might count it no Disgrace to repeat his Slander which  T E  had answered in his Postscript to the  fair Examination  and for a final Stroke to it he produces Certificates from those who were concerned about his Father at the time of his Death and Interrment that he was decently Buried as usual which may be seen at the End of this Book in Reply to  G K  And there's an End of all those Lying Stories raised concerning the Dead to asperse the Living to the Shame and Confusion of all the Inventors and Fomentors of them the Man was dead and in his Grave and there should have rested without Envy or Detraction and I am only sorry he seemed to retain his Aversion to his Son for the Truth's sake which he received in his early Days To the Honour of which I attribute it that he was preserved and carried through and over all Opposition and lived in Reputation and Renown to his Dying Day  His next Book is in intituled  Truth defended and the Friends thereof cleared from the false Charges foul Reproaches and envious Cavils cast upon it and them by  George Keith  an Apostate from them in two Books by him lately published one called  A true Copy of a Paper delivered into the YearlyMeeting  c The other  The Pretended YearlyMeeting's nameless Bull of Excommunication  c  In which last  G K  gives an Account of his Coming to the  YearlyMeeting  and of his Entertainment in it when admitted as if he had never been there  before  viz That he was allowed to sit at the Great Square Table among the Ministers and Commissioners  as he calls them  that could hold about it either fully or near double to the Number of Twenty four whether by Allusion to the Twenty four Seats and Elders mentioned  Rev  but doubling the Number he doth not determin  adding  I think it suits not their Crying out so much as they were wont against chief Seats in the Synagogues to erect such a stately Fabrick in their MeetingHouse at that time little differing from the manner of a Throne but that it is low upon the Floor covered with Green Cloth  All which only serves to shew his own  Pageantry  and which our Friend  T Ellwood  corrects him for according to his deserts For the Table will hold few more than Twenty four or Twenty eight at most and only necessary to lay Books and Papers on to Write  In the Beginning of this Book our Friend  T E  resumes the Controversie from the Beginning shews the Rise of the Difference and Proceedings thereupon in relation to  George Keith  particularly after his coming into  England  in the beginning of and how he came to be disowned by the Yearly Meeting in for his rejecting the Advice of the former and opposite Carriage thereunto which being so excellent to the matter in hand and setting the Controversie in a clear light I shall here insert it which begins thus  'It is an old Observation That none prove more angry and implacable Enemies to any Society of People than those that for their  Disorders and unruly Behaviour have been disowned by the Society they once were of a certain vindictive Enmity usually getting up in such and stirring them up to load that Society by which they were denied with all the Reproach and Infamy they can thereby both gratifying a revengeful Spirit in themselves and thinking also by recriminating others to extenuate at least their own Crimes That thus it was in the early Times of Christianity may be gathered from the Writings of the Apostles particularly  Tim    Pet    John    c    John    c Jude  vers Among those in this Age whom Satan hath drawn to this degree of Malice and Madness  George Keith  a  Scotchman  is the latest but not the least whether with respect to his Anger or his Envy He having been bred a Scholar before he came amongst the People called  Quakers  and having acquired more of SchoolLearning than most it may be in his own Opinion than any of that People have hath given in himself a demonstrative Proof of the Apostle's Proposition  Cor    Knowledge puffeth up where Edifying Chais not joined with it  For  Humane Knowledge  is apt of it self to lift up Mens Minds that have or think they have it in any degree of Eminency and makes them think better of themselves than of others or than themselves deserve whereas true Charity useth Knowledge to instruct and thereby builds up not to puzzle and confound and thereby destroy  others but that Charity this Man not having but being vainly puffed up in his Fleshly Mind from a proud Conceit of his own Abilities and being gotten into  America  among a plain People who better understood the plain and simple Truth than the nice Distinctions and Subtilties of the Schools and there advanced to the Office of a SchoolMaster with a standing Sallary as I have been informed of an Hundred and Twenty Pounds by the Year he soon began like  Diotrephes  of old  John  to affect  Praeeminence  in the Church and nothing less would serve his turn than to rule and overrule all And that he might not want Matter to work upon and some Pretence to begin on he not only found fault with Friends Ministry and Discipline there but having in private Discourses put some captious and ensnaring Questions to some particular Persons there whose Simplicity he thought he might most easily betray he by wresting their Answers to a wrong Sense took Advantage to complain against them  for holding  as he said  gross and vile Errors  and with impetuous Heat prosecuted his Charge and not being so fully nor speedily answered as he expected by those Friends to whom he complained who seeing the Innocency of the Accused and his evil Design in Accusing could not Countenance him therein he involved them also in the like Charge of  Cloaking or Covering gross and vile Errors Damnable Heresies and Doctrines of Devils  c Nor gave he over till by continua  Clamours and frequent Disturbances he ha  filled Friends Meetings with Strife and Con+tention and at length having leavened a Par+ty to himself made an open Division and Se+paration from Friends setting up separate Meetings for himself and his Party in Oppo+sition to the Meetings of Friends before settled there And having got the Printer to hi  Party and thereby the only Press there at hi  Command he maliciously put the Difference into Print and thereby spread it not only in those Parts of  America  but in these of  Europ  also These things drew Friends there afte  much Patience and long Forbearance to dea  with him in a Churchway and to give forth at length a Testimony against him which proving uneasie to him he came over from thence to  England  about the beginning of the the Year of which some Friends o  Pennsylvania  having Notice came over also and at the Yearly Meeting of the People called  Quakers  holden at  London  in the th Mon  that Year the Matters relating to that Difference being fully heard and considered the Sence of that Meeting was  That the Separation lay at  G K  's door and that he had done ill in Printing and Publishing those Differences as he had done  And the Advice of the Meeting to him thereupon was  To call in those Books of his or publish something innocently and effectually to clear the Body of the People called  Quakers  and their Ministers from those gross Errors charged on  some few in  America  and retract the bitter Language in them so far as he was concerned and sincerely to use his utmost Endeavours with his Friends concerned to remove the Separation  c Which Sence and Advice being drawn up at large in Writing was then in that Meeting delivered to him and soon after Printed by one of his Party with very envious Reflections upon it as may be seen in a small Pamphlet called  A True Account  c to which I refer But so far was  G K  from regarding the Sence or following the Advice of that Yearly Meeting that in several printed Books by him soon after published he rejected it denying it to be the Sence or Advice of the Yearly Meeting or that to be the Yearly Meeting that gave it Which Abuse this last Yearly Meeting in the d Month past taking notice of and upon further dealing with him finding him instead of being humbled and sorry for the Evil he had done more hardned therein justifying himself both by Word and Writing and rejecting the Meetings Advice That Meeting after it had heard him patiently till he of his own accord withdrew gave forth a Testimony against him which he hath since Printed with his Answer thereunto As he hath also in another Pamphlet a Copy of his Paper which he read in the Meeting together with a Narrative of his own making of the Proceedings of the Meeting with him and a List of Errors charged by him on some particular Persons To each  of these I intend to speak now that I have premised this short Introduction which I thought needful for the Information of any such Reader as had not before heard the Ris  of the Difference nor the Course of Proceed+ings thereupon  This I thought fit to insert being so materia  as to the Ground of the Controversie with  Keith  after which  T E  proceeds to Answe  all his Cavils in his said two Books or Papers  And shews that by his disorderly Practices h  had excluded himself from our Society befor  Friends disowned him So leaving him withou  Excuse and the weight of his Iniquity upon hi  own Head which he could never get from under but waxed worse and worse as evil Me  and Seducers use to do so that Truth was se  over his Head and Friends were clear of him  But now another Occasion offer'd and that was one  Gerard Croese  a  Dutchman  publishing  A general History  so called  of the  Quakers  containing the Lives Tenets Sufferings Tryals Speeches  and  Letters  as pretended  of the most eminent of them  First in  Latin  which was Translated and Printed in  English  in the Year Wherein though he had represented some things pretty fairly yet in others through Inadvertancy or Ignorance I hope not wilfully he had misrepresented us and our Principles and Practices whereupon our Friend  T Ellwood  according to an Advertisement at the End of the said  History  in  English  that  some Remarks on it would be published  he writ some Remarks  on it in  Latin  perhaps before the  English  came out which would no doubt have been turn'd into  English  intending doubtless to publish 'em but in the mean time before they were finished a Book of the same Nature and to the same purpose in  Latin  was published in  Holland  by way of Remarks or Observations on the said  History  which seemed again to circumvent him in his intended Remarks on it so that he laid 'em by and never finished them and so the World was deprived of this Piece also  But now  G Keith  being gone out from the Fellowship of the Faithful and hardened in his Enmity against Friends he arrived to the Top or Height of Opposition he had been playing small Stakes hitherto but now came to throw all at once In order to which he Erected a Stage of Contention at  TurnersHall  in  PhilpotLane London  where he had held Separate Meetings for some time before to oppose Friends in general under pretence of discovering divers Errors out of the  Quakers  Books that were never in them and published an Advertisement of a Meeting he intended to hold there in the  th Month  to discover the  Quakers  Errors though he had been one so long himself and vindicated them as to all that any could Object against and yet now came to accuse them himself but Friends slighted him not thinking it worth their while to follow him or Dance after his Pipe to  TurnersHall  Of which contentious Meeting he afterwards published a Narrative which our Friend  T E  answered this Year in  a Book intituled  An Answer to  George Keith  's Narrative of his Proceedings at  TurnersHall  c wherein his Charges against divers of the People called  Quakers  in that and another Book of his called  Gross Errors  c    are fairly considered examined and refuted  And he made his Title good in a close Answer and entire Confutation of all his Cavils against our Friends Books which because I have given the Preambles or Introductions of his former to illustrate the matter I shall also in like manner introduce this with his general Account of the Controversie by way of Introduction to his Answer being so pertinent to the Case in hand for the Readers better Information and Satisfaction which follows beginning thus  'It is not surely without good Reason that the Church of Christ here on Earth is called the  Church Militant  For besides the Inward and Spiritual Enemies which her several Members have to encounter with in their Pilgrimage through this troublesome World such hath been and is her Lot and Portion that she hath rarely been free from outward Enemies of one kind or other her great Adversary  Satan  continually raising up some Evil Instruments or other to fall upon her all aiming at her Ruin though after divers ways and manners Sometimes the Civil Powers under which she hath lived have been stirred up to proclaim as it were open War against her and to inflict severe and heavy Penalties upon her for her faithful Adherence  to her Lord and Master Christ Jesus When through Faith and Patience she hath overcome and the Wrath and Fury of Men hath been asswaged so that she hath had some respit from those outward Snfferings Then hath her old Adversary the common Enemy of Mankind bestirr'd himself in another way to raise up  Persecution  against her of another kind by instigating some or other either such as were always avowed Enemies to her or such as for sometime appeared to be of her but by the sweep of his Tail had been struck off from her to speak or write against her falsly to accuse her and load her with the foulest Reproaches and most infamous Slanders and Scandals that by so misrepresenting her they might hinder others from joining to or favouring her and stir up the Civil Magistrate again to persecute her afresh This hath been the Lot this the Condition of the Little Flock of Christ in former Ages as  Ecclesiastical Histories  declare As for the present Age and with respect to the People called  Quakers  whom God by an invisible Arm of Power hath raised up and held up and made a peculiar People to himself Experience gives sufficient Proof the Matter being yet fresh in Memory For not to look back so far as that which was called the  Commonwealth  's Time wherein many of the Leading Men in most Professions put forth their utmost Strength against us both in Preaching and Printing raising those false Reports concerning  us and charging many false Accusations upon us with respect both to  Doctrine  and  Practice  which others of our Adversaries that followed after have taken up upon trust from them no sooner was that great Persecution a little abated which soon after the Restoration of K  Charles  the  Second  through the Fault of some  Dissenters  fell upon  all  but most heavily upon  us  and that a little Calm and Quiet ensued but out came several Books against us written by some of those Professors who either in some measure did suffer or if they had been faithful to their own Principle should have suffered in the same Storm with us By that time the Dust which those Books had raised was laid by our Answers thereunto a fresh Persecution from the Government arose upon the  Informing Act  the main weight of which it is well known fell upon us they who before and afterwards assaulted us in Print finding ways then to hide and save themselves from Suffering But when that Storm was a little over out they came again and in divers Books written by  Faldo Hicks  and others heaped up many wrong Charges Defamations Slanders and false Accusations against us all which were refuted and wiped off in our Books Printed in Answer thereunto Nor have those of other Professions been so forward to attack us since But now that Liberty of Conscience in the free Exercise of Religious Worship is by Authority granted and thereby outward Sufferings in a great  measure abated our old Enemy envying us so great a Benefit though but in common with others hath contrived ways and means to raise a  New War  against us by stirring up some who have formerly walked with us and for some time professed to be of us but upon some peevish Discontent or other have turned aside and left us to turn now against us and oppose us and to pour forth Floods of Reproach Slanders and false Accusations upon us His chief Agent at present in this Work is  George Keith a Scotchman  whose  ambitious Aims  not being answered nor his  absurd  and  fantastical Notions  received by and amongst the People called  Quakers  he is now become of a  seeming Friend  a  real Enemy  He having published many Books against us and in defence of those Books wrangled with us for a while in Print till he found himself too closely pinched to be able to give an Answer fit to be seen in Print hath at length bethought himself of a  Wile  to excuse himself from answering which was To set up a kind of  Judicial Court  of his  own Head  and by his  own Authority  in a place at his  own Command  on a Day of his  own Appointing  there to charge and try divers of us who are called  Quakers  whether present or absent concerning Matters of  Faith  and  Doctrine  and that the rude Multitude might not be wanting to his Assistance there he gave publick notice of it some time before by an Advertisement in Print and therein a sort of  Summons  to some of us by Name to others  by Designation to be present This  Arbitrary  Proceeding and  Usurped  Authority as we judged it unreasonable in him to impose so we did not think fit to submit to or own and therefore forbore to appear at the time and place by him appointed Yet lest any whom he should draw thither might mistake the Cause of our not appearing the Reasons thereof drawn up in short Heads were sent thither to be Read and given among the People which they were However according to his before declared Intention to proceed whether any of us were there or no he being  Judge in his own Court  overruled our Reasons and went on to Arraign and Convict us absent The  Pageantry  of which Days Work as acted there by himself he hath since Published with his Name to it under the Title of  An Exact Narrative of the Proceedings at  Turners Hall  c Together with the Disputes and Speeches there between  G Keith  and other  Quakers  differing from him in some Religious Principles  How Idle is this in him to pretend in his Title to give an Account of Disputes and Speeches between him and other Quakers when as his  Narrative  it self gives no Account of any Dispute there nor any thing like it and of that little that was said by any of those few Quakers that were present most was to the People tending to shew them the Unreasonableness of his Undertaking and desiring them to reserve one Ear for the other side very little of it to him  Then he goes on to shew  G K  's Falshood  in calling it  An Exact Narrative  and yet not Inserting the Reasons why our Friends did not Appear which he Confesses were Read and his Falacies in evading them which therefore  T E  sets down Obviates  G K  's Quibbles on them So proceeds to Answer his  Narrative  Clearing the Quotations he brought out of our Friends Books from his Perversions being either unfairly or falsly Quoted or perverted in their Sense to what they never intended according to his Carping and Caviling Way Vindicating the soundness of their Doctrine shewing  G K  's selfcontradictions in opposing what he had so often Vindicated as Orthodox and yet pretending to hold the same Doctrines and Principles still and laying open his Deceit Falshood and Prevarications so plainly and effectually that  G K  never reply'd to it and good reason why because he could not to the Purpose being Answered home and defeated in all his Vile Pretences Envious Cavils and False Accusations  But being Pinch'd and driven to a Nonplus by Quotations out of his own Books in favour of what he opposed which he could not Answer wherein he had Asserted or Defended the same Doctrines and Principles in as plain or higher Words which he now blamed Friends for as Gross Errors  c  Which yet he would not allow to be so in himself but paliated them under the soft Term of  Mistakes  Saying  Narrative  p  I know not any fundamental Principle nor indeed any one Principle of Christian Faith that  I have varied from to this Day ever since I came among the Quakers which is about Thirty Three Years ago  And in his Preface to his  Nar  p he says  The things  he does not call them  Errors  nor hardly ever uses the word  Error  with respect to himself and his own Writings  that need Correction in my Books compared with the vile Errors in theirs are but as my Motes to their Beams Nor are they such things as oppose any Christian Principles of Faith But of an inferior Nature  and yet they were as full in the Points as any he could Cite out of ours And in  The true Copy of a Paper  Printed where in p he faintly intimates a purpose to Publish some  short Explication  c  of some Words and Passages in his former Books  He adds  For upon a Review of my former Books I freely Acknowledge I have found some Passages and Words that not only need some farther Explanation but even in some part an Emendation and Correction  How gently doth he Touch himself says  T E  How softly doth he handle his own Sores Not a Syllable of  Errors  or  Heresie  there No the hardest word he can afford to give them is his  former Mistakes  And lest the Reader should extend them too far he explains it in the next Page saying  Upon the most Impartial search I have made I find not any Cause to Correct either my Judgment or Books as touching any of the great Doctrines and Principles of the Christian Religion nor do I know that I am of another Faith in any one Principle of Christian Doctrine contrary to what I believed ever since I went under the Profession of a Quaker so Called  With much more to the same purpose  Thus Partial was he as to himself notwithstanding his loud Clamours and outcries of  vile Errors  against the Quakers for the same things he had held himself which yet were no  Errors  in him such a Hypocrite was he to Dissemble with God and Man So that when he found his Doctrines Compared with what he Accused Friends of and saw they were the same or parallel 'twas to no purpose for him to go to Vindicate or Clear himself of what was so Notorious▪ And therefore procured another or at least he undertook it for him under disguise of the  Snake in the Grass  And so to slide by the Quotatious out of his Books that lay in his Way which would have been a shame for  G K  to do a  Snake in the Grass  indeed pretending in his Preface that  it was not meant as a Defence of  George Keith  any further than he defended the Truth of the Christian Faith for which Reason  says he  I have wholly omitted all the Personal Reflections cast upon him and the Contradictions which  Thomas Ellwood  pretends to find in his former Books while he was a Quaker of their Communion to the Doctrine he now sets up in opposition to them  And so gave the go by to whatever pincht him which was the design as  T E  observes to help  G Keith  off at a dead Lift from his manifold and manifest self Contradictions which it was impossible for him to Reconcile or Defend and because it had been as absurd for him to have undertaken a Reply to  T E  's Answer and not have attempted to acquit himself of those Contradictions charged upon him therein as it  would have been impossible for him to have Clear'd himself of them Therefore this Contrivance was found out that another or perhaps he in a Mask under the disguise of another for Satan though disrob'd from his Disguise of Light has many black Robes and dark Disguises to put on should undertake the Task of Replying for a Task it seems it was upon such a Foot and under such Circumstances as might give him some colourable Pretence to wave the Contradictions and wholly to omit them and with them whatsoever else he found too hard to meddle with  So that any one might plainly see this was a Contrivance as our Friend  T E  observes to help  G K  out at a dead Lift To which Book of the  Snake's T E  writ an Answer though he did not quite finish it or publish it Of which and that Controversie he gives the following Account  'This Controversie begun by  George Keith  upon a Pick he took against the People called  Quakers  because they could not Answer his Ambitious desire of Rule nor receive some Wild and Fantastical Notions of his has been carried on by him in his own Name 'till he could go no further The Doctrines he Condemns us for as Erroneous and Heritical have been either so clearly cast off by us as Slanders or so Rivetted on himself by undeniable Instances and Proofs taken out of his own Books that having foreclosed his way to a Retractation of them as shall be  shewed anon he had no way left but as his last shift to shift the Cause into anothers Hand to carry it on under the disguise of aanother Person which brought to my Mind the Fable of  Achelous  who being too weak for his Antagonist in fair Force was fain to shift from one Shape to another first to that of a  Snake  then to that of a  Bull  and is thereupon brought in by the  Poet  Saying  Inferior Virtute meas divertor ad Artes  Elaborque Viro Longum formatus in Anguem  c  Metam Lib Fab  In Strength too Weak I to my Wiles betake  And slide from Man into a Twining Snake  Somewhat a like Crafty Course has  G Keith  taken who finding himself over prest the last Year with Books which he knew not how to Answer got as was supposed an Adjutant of his to Publish a Book against us under Disguise without a Name to it and with the very Title of  The Snake in the Grass  Thereby to have diverted us from pursuing the Controversie then and still in Hand with him But when he found that would not do for the design was seen he Roar'd against us like a  Bull  at  TurnersHall  in the Month called  June  and afterwards in his  Narrative  thereof The Answer to that which soon followed has it seems involv'd him in such difficulties that he hath not thought fit to appear against it in his own Shape but either assuming another  Person or turning over his broken Forces with the united Forces of the whole Party to the Hissing Author of the  Snake  they have amongst them lately thrust forth another Book as a Reply to that Answer of mine to  G Keith's Narrative  This without a Name too and said to be written  by the Author of the Snake in the Grass  is called  Satan Disrob'd from his disguise of Light  But the observant Reader will find Cause enough I think to Conclude that whoever writ it was fully Inrob'd in  Satan  's overGuise and proper Dress of  Darkness  from the many bitter and scornful Invectives therein used against the  Light  And for the Controversie it self he Remarks  ' That the matters therein Charged upon us are generally the same that have been charged on us heretofore by  Faldo Hicks  and other Adversaries and always Refuted over and over both formerly and of late  ' That the things they Charge on us as Errors and Heresie are not pretended to be proved by any plain express Positions or Assertions of ours but from our Adversaries own perverse meanings and wrested Constructions of our Words always Denyed and Rejected by us  ' That the Words and Passages brought by our Adversaries for Proof of their Charges against us are not taken out of our Doctrinal Treatises or Declarations of Faith and Principles but for the most part out of Controversial Books wherein oft times the scope  and aim of the Author is not so much to Assert or Express his own Principles or Doctrines as to Impugn and Expose his Adversaries by shewing the Contradictions Absurdities and ill Consequences of his Adversaries Opinions from whence Positively to conclude the Authors own Judgment is neither safe nor fair  ' That however any of our former Adversaries might have been misled in their Judgments concerning us  G Keith  who hath now moved this Controversie against us knows full well that we do not hold those things either generally as a People or as particular Persons which he has charged on us as Errors As a People he has clearly acquitted us from them in his  Preface  to his  Narrative  P where hesays  I charge them not either upon the Generality far less upon the Universality of all them called  Quakers For particular Persons hear what he says of  George Whitehead  one of the principal Butts he shoots at  Nar  p where having charged him with  Denying that Christ in Heaven has any bodily Existence without us  being conscious that  G Whitehead  did not so hold but that he had therein abused him he immediatly adds  If he  G W  has said otherwise in any of his late printed Books I am glad of it  And a Line lower  There is a  G Whitehead  Orthodox and a  G Whitehead  not Orthodox He is in this and some other things Orthodox and not Orthodox  and a little further  I own it that I have cited divers Passages out of his later Books that are Orthodox to prove him sound  What can be made of all this but that  G Whitehead  was Orthodox and Sound in his own both Intentions and Expressions not Orthodox in  G Keith's  perverse and false Constructions And whereas he harps upon the Word  later Books  thereby to insinuate as if  G W  had of late altered his Judgment he has cut off that also in his  Nar  p where he gives an Account That in the Year which is Eighteen Years ago  some  whom he would not Name  Questioning him about some Principles in a Book of his  both  G Whitehead  and  W Penn  took part with him against them though those Principles as he calls them which he says he was then  Questioned about  were of the same Nature with some of those he now charges upon them as Errors From whence it appears that he found them then as well as now  Sound  and  Orthodox  in those Principles  ' That as this Controversie lies properly and directly between  G Keith  and us and that he being bafled in it and driven to a  Ne plus ultra  on his own Part hath contrived to carry it on under Disguise by the Assistance of another yet without a Name who under pretence of  Indifferency and being unconcerned with or for  G Keith should drop the Quotations I had loaded him with out of his own Books against himself and thereby free him if he could from those pinching  Dilemma's  which lay against him and  draw Dun  as the Proverb speaks  out of the mire  he was plung'd into so to obviate and disappoint the Design  That I may not suffer my self to be bubbled by such Artificial Shams but that the Controversie may be kept as much as may be upon its first Bottom I have thought fit in this Rejoinder so to order the Matter as not to let  G Keith  slip away which I perceive he would fain do while I am contending with I know not whom in this Quarrel Therefore as I pass through the several Heads of the Controversie I purpose not only to Answer the most material Cavils of the present Adversary but withal to repeat some at least of those Passages that lay so heavy upon  G Keith  and settle not to use his own smithing Metaphors of  Clinching  and  Rivetting  them faster on him to the end that both the Reader may more plainly see the true Reason why  G Keith  did not himself reply in his own Name to my Answer to his Narrative and  G Keith  may know that I expect it from him and in the mean time look upon him but as a bafled shifting Adversary  'He begins his Epistle with telling his Reader that  his Reply is short in Comparison of the Answer  Therein he and I agree but in  Words  rather than in  Meaning  for he means in Number of Pages I mean in Truth and fair Dealing in which I am confident the indifferent Reader will find his Reply  short  indeed And even as to Bulk upon due Consideration the Disproportion is not so great as he would represent it for his Book is rather more than half as big as mine though he replies not to  the Tenth Part of the Matter contained in mine He makes nothing of skipping over Ten or Fifteen Pages at a time so nimble heel'd he is  And yet this is the Man that caution'd the  Quakers  that  if they answer'd his Book  Snake d Edit p  that they would reply distinctly and not Answer a Book as Rats do by nibling at some Corners of the Leaves stealing through it like Moths to no other Purpose than to deface some Words at a venture  who yet could reply thus slightly himself  'Nay in his first Page he throws off no less than Twenty Five Pages at once and barely mentioning in less than Nine Lines a few Words contained in some of them without a Syllable of Reply thereto sets in his Margin  Reply to the first Twenty three Pages  and yet he hath the Confidence to miscal his Book and that even in the same Page  A full Reply  he might better have called it a  foul  and  false Reply    to  T Ellwood  's Answer  And in his Epistle says  he has omitted nothing that is material  I suppose he means that he has omitted nothing which he thought might tend to abuse and defame the  Quakers  and me for that he has omitted the most material Parts of my Book and thrust in many Passages idle impertinent false and wholly foreign to the Subject only that he might misrepresent ridicule and slander us I shall have occasion hereafter by plenty of Instances to shew  I might cite a great deal more to explicate this Controversie and shew their Disingenuity  in it but by this we may judge what a Reply this of the  Snake  's was and by this Taste to use his own Words at the End of the  Snake    the Reader may guess what a plentiful Meal we might have had  if  T E  had published his  Rejoinder  but that as I said he did not for what Reason I cannot justly assign for though our Friend  George Whitehead  in his Answer to the  Snake in the Grass  writ also  A brief Examination of some Passages in the said Book of the Snake's stiled  Satan Disrob'd  c  as being concerned therein yet he refer'd to a further Answer by  T E  p judging it  'No fair Reply to  T Ellwood  's Answer and so it appears says he and I expect will be made further appear if  T Ellwood  deems it worth the while to undertake it  Which he did and writ Twenty seven Sheets in order thereto and why he should be prevented from publishing it by  G Whitehead's Brief Examination  I do not see being much larger and fuller but perceive he was so modest that he was apt to be put by of his Work if any other put in before him as will further appear on another Occasion hereafter And so I shall leave it hoping however one time or other to see this and some other of his Posthumous Works published by themselves as they well deserve  And here our Friend drop'd his Pen till another Occasion offer'd  And that was next or at least the next he laid hold on after a Vacancy of two or three Years on this Occasion  Some Angry Priests in  Norfolk  on our Friends having a Meeting near one of them and Truth spreading to their regret they challenged a Dispute with some of our Friends at  WestDeerham  in that County the th of the Tenth Month where some of our Friends appearing and answering them so disappointed the Priests in their envious Designs in the said Dispute that they afterwards promoted two Petitions against our Friends to the Parliament one from  Norfolk  the other from  Suffolk  to stir up Persecution against them that what they could not do by Arguments they might by Force To which two Petitions our Friend  T Ellwood  having obtained Copies of them writ  A sober Reply on behalf of the People called  Quakers  to two Petitions against them    the one out of  Norfolk  and the other from  Bury  in  Suffolk  being some brief Observations upon them  c  Printed manifesting their mischievous Machinations against the Truth and Friends which with some other Discouragements through the Labour and Industry of Friends at  London  in attending the Parliament and delivering Printed Papers particularly  A few Considerations humbly offered to the Members of Parliament to obviate some Evil Jealousies and Designs against the People called  Quakers so quashed their malicious Purposes that their Petitions were never delivered to or receiv'd by the Parliament but fell and came to nothing and their Evil Designs were frustrated Friends were preserved and Truth prospered over their Heads  About this time also our Friend  William Penn  being gone to  Pennsylvania  in the th Month this Year and  G Keith  continuing his Opposition against Truth and Friends sometimes more general at  TurnersHall  where as the Course of his  Dilirious Distemper  returned as  Joseph Wyeth  observes in his Answer to his Advertisement this Year he held his Contentious Meetings once a Year to pick Passages out of our Friends Books to Cavil at though he could not Answer nor Clear himself of  T Ellwood  's or others that were writ against him And sometimes more particularly against single Persons especially  William Penn  against whom he chose to vent his Malice above most others especially now in his Absence making him the Butt of his Indignation and published two Books against him one called  The Deism of  William Penn  and his Brethren  c This our Friend  T Ellwood  undertook to Answer and made a considerable Progress in it in a large Book of between Thirty and Forty Sheets which I shall cite some of Beginning thus  'We read of one in former Times who because he had given up himself to do Evil was said to have  sold himself to work Wickedness in the Sight of the Lord  Kings and Whether  George Keith  hath directly sold himself or only let himself out to hire I will not undertake to determine but evident it is that since he crept into the Interest of that which is called the  Church of England  and become a mercenary Hackney to some of the  Clergy  he hath laid out himself with his utmost Vigour to  work Wickedness  not only  in the Sight of the Lord  but  in the Sight of the Sun  asserting defending maintaining and upholding divers both  Doctrines  and  Practices  in Religion which upon a declared full Conviction and from a professed Assurance of Divine Openings and Immediate Guidance of the  Holy Spirit  he had before not only Renounced but declared and written against as  False Superstitious  if not  Idolatrous  and  Antichristian  And to fill up his Measure of  Iniquity  and heap it up that it might run over he hath not only to gratifie his Supporters shot his unadvised Bolts at the several other Bodies of  Protestam Dissenters  but in an especial manner and in a most virulent and to him peculiar Stile hath evomitted Floods not of  Reproach  only and  bitter Revilings  but of the most  malicious Slanders  and  Falshoods  that ever perhaps were poured from the Pulpit or squeezed through the Press against the People called  Quakers  whom once he owned for his Brethren and with whom he professed to hold Communion for more than Thirty Years Herein he hath exceeded good  Joseph  of Old in his Liberality but in another kind that good Man bestowed a  FivefoldMess  of his  good Things  on his Brother  Benjamin  as a Token of his peculiar and abundant Love to him This bad Man has bestowed  double  and  treble  that proportion of his  evil Things  on us The Effect of his peculiar and superabundant Hatred to us to say  nothing here of his railing Rhetorick and bitter Invectives against us wherewith he hath prophaned the Pulpit which lie under the just Censure of the more discreet and wellminded of his Auditors An Instance of his Malice and Injustice from the Press is a late Book of his now lying before me called  The Deism of  William Penn  and his Brethren destructive to the Christian Religion exposed  c The Word  Deism  being somewhat an uncommon Term may not perhaps be readily understood by every Reader As it has been opposed to  Atheism  it has been taken in a good Sense but as it is now used it is taken in an ill sence as importing an Acknowledgment or owning of God  only  or of the  Godhead  but not of Christ with respect to his Incarnation or being manifest in the Flesh for the Redemption of Man So that to Charge any one now with  Deism  is to Charge him with denying that Christ is Come and hath Suffered in the Flesh Now herein  G Keith  's both Injustice and Malice is the greater in Charging  W Penn  and his Brethren the  Quakers  with  Deism  in as much as he assuredly knows which some other Adversaries have not had the like opportunity to know as he hath had by certain Experience drawn by so many Years intimate Conversation with  W P  and the  Quakers  in free and familiar Conferences and in Reading their Books that  W P  and the  Quakers  both in Word and Writing Publickly and Privately have always and on all  Occasions Confest Acknowledged Owned as well as Believed the Incarnation of Christ according to the Holy Scriptures  viz That the Word was made Flesh  John  That when the fulness of time was come God sent forth his Son made of a Woman made under the Law to Redeem them that were under the Law  Gal That  Christ Jesus being in the form of God and thinking it no Robbery to be equal with God made himself of no Reputation and took upon him the form of a Servant and was made in the likeness of Men and being found in fashion as a Man he humbled himself and became obedient unto Death even the Death of the Cross  Phil  Christ Dyed for our Sins according to the Scriptures and that he was Buried and that he Rose again the Third Day according to the Scriptures  Cor  That he was delivered for our Offences and was raised again for our Justification  Rom  That he is the Propitiation for our Sins and not for ours only but for the Sins of the whole World  John  That he ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things  Ephes  That he is the one Mediator between God and Men  Tim  That he is at the Right Hand of God and maketh intercession for us  Rom  And is our Advocate with the Father  John  And that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of Quick and Dead  Acts These things I say  G Keith  certainly knows have been constantly Held Believed Professed and Owned by  W Penn  and his Brethren the  Quakers  in General both Privately and Publickly in Word and Writing These things are so often Testified of in our Meetings and have been so fully and plainly asserted and held forth in our Books that we might call in almost as many Witnesses thereof as have frequented our Meetings or Attentively Read our Books  'The Book of  W P  's Called  A Discourse of the general Rule of Faith and Life  To which  G K  's  Deism  is an Answer  G K  tells us in his Preface  was first Printed in the Year  As an Appendix to  W P  's part of the  Christian Quaker  A Folio Book in Two Parts the former written by  W Penn  the latter by  G Whitehead  In that former part of the  Christian Quaker  written by  W Penn  though the tendency of it is to Assert and Defend the Divinity of Christ and his Spiritual Appearance by his Divine Light in the Hearts of  Men  yet there it enough said concerning his Manhood his Outward Appearance and Sufferings in the Flesh to free  W Penn  from the Imputation or Suspicion of  Deism  In p  W P  says Notwithstanding the same Light and Life with that which afterwards cloathed it self with that Outward Body did in measure Inwardly appear for the Salvation of the Souls of Men Yet as I have often said never did that Life so eminently put forth it self to that end as in that Sanctified and prepared Body so that what he then Suffered and did in that Transcendent Manifestation may by way of  Eminency assume the whole work unto it self that he ever did before or might do afterwards P His Righteous Life with respect to its appearance in that Body was grieved by Sin and the weight of the Iniquity of the whole World with the concernment of its Eternal Wellbeing lay hard upon him nor was his  Manhood  insencible of it under the load of this did he Travel  He alone trod the Winepress  c  Not that we would irreverently Rob the Holy Body of whatsoever acknowledgement is justly due nor yet separate what God joined  P Chap A Confession in particular to Christ's Redemption Remission Justification and Salvation Which was actually to the Salvation of some and intentionally of the whole World As there was a necessity that  one should Die for the People  so whoever then or since Believed in him had and have a Seal or Confirmation of the  Remission  of their Sins in his Blood This grand assurance of Remission do all receive in the Ratifying Blood of Christ who Repenting of their Sins Believe and Obey the Holy Light with which he hath Illuminated them P But there is yet a further Benefit that accrueth by the Blood of Christ  viz  That  Christ is a Propitiation and Redemption to such as have Faith in it  For though I still place the stress of particular Benefit upon the Light Life and Spirit Revealed and Witnessed in every Particular Yet in that general Appearance there was a general Benefit justly to be attributed  to the Blood of that very Body of Christ to wit that it did Propitiate For however it might draw stupendious Judgments upon the Heads of those who were Authors of that dismal  Tragedy  and died Impenitent yet doubtless it thus far turned to very great Account in that it was a most precious Offering in the sight of the Lord and drew God's Love the more eminently to Mankind at least such as should Believe in his Name P Doubtless it did greatly Influence to some singular Tenderness and peculiar Regard unto all such as should Believe in his Name among other his weighty Performances For the sake of that last and greatest of all his External Acts the resisting unto Blood for the Spiritual good of the World thereby offering up his Life upon the Cross through the Power of the Eternal Spirit that Remission of Sin God's Bounty to the World might be Preached in his Name and in his very Blood too as that which was the most Ratifying of all his Bodily Sufferings And indeed therefore might it seem meet to the Holy Ghost that Redemption Propitiation and Remission should be Declared and held forth in the Blood of Christ unto all that have a right Faith therein as saith the Apostle to the  Romans  because it implies a firm Belief that  Christ was come in the Flesh  and that none could then have him as their  Propitiation  and  Redemption  who withstood the acknowledgment of and belief in his  Visible Appearance  P Faith in his Blood was requisite  that they might Confess him whose Body and Blood it was to be Christ To Conclude we confess  He  who then appeared was and is the Propitiation  c  and in him was Redemption obtained by all those who had such true Faith in his Blood  'Thus much and much more which I have omitted against  Deism  in that very Treatise of  W P  's to which the Book out of which  G K  by his Art of Counterfeit  Chymistry  would Extract  Deism  was an Appendix and yet this was not the direct Subject of that Treatise but only toucht on occasionally or by the by Should I gather up all Quotations on this Argument out of our other Books such especially as have more directly handled this Subject I might therewith fill a large Volume To prevent which I refer the Reader to my  Answer to  G Keith  's First Narrative of his Proceedings at  TurnersHall from P to where he may find this Cavil fully Confuted Which Answer to his first  Narrative  may serve for an Answer to his other following  Narratives  also they for the most part being but the Scraps of his First heated again and served up afresh with some new Garnish  'It is observable that that Book called  A Discourse of the general Rule of Faith and Life  was first Printed as  G K  in his Preface to his  Deism  takes Notice in the Year which is Years ago and about Years before he quite left us it appears he had Read it in the first Impression for making as if  when he saw the last Impression he did not know but that it was a New Book  So little had I Read or Considered the Contents of it  Both Read it then it seems he had and Considered the Contents of it and though here he would suggest he had but slightly Read it yet he would not be taken for an heedless Reader or a superficial Considerer of what he Reads Now since he held the same Doctrine with respect to the  General Rule of Faith and Life  which is laid down by  W Penn  in that Discourse during the time he was amongst us and Professed himself one of us as well after the Publishing of that Book in the Year as before and did not only openly Defend and Maintain that Doctrine in publick Disputations both in  England  and in  Scotland  after the Year But no longer ago than in the Year Nineteen Years after that Book of  W Penn  's Called  A Discourse of the General Rule of Faith and Life  was in Print  G K  in his  Serious Appeal  p says  According to the best Knowledge I have of the People called  Quakers  and those most generally owned by them as Preachers and Publishers of their Faith of unquestioned esteem among them and worthy of double Honour as many such there are I know none that are Guilty of any one such Heresies and Blasphemies as thou Accusest them And I think I should know and do know these called  Quakers  better than  C Mather against whom he then writ  or any of his Brethren having been Conversant with them in Publick Meetings as well as  in Private Discourse with the most Noted and Esteemed among them for above    Years past and that in many places of the World in  Europe  and for these divers Years in  America I say all this Considered how will  G Keith  upon the Charges he now makes against  W P  acquit himself from having been a Profest  Deist  all the while he was among the  Quakers  Yet he himself well knows that neither he nor  W Penn  nor any of the  Quakers  ever were  Deists  ever did Deny Disown or Disbelieve the Coming Incarnation Sufferings and Death of Christ as Man outwardly in the Flesh his Resurrection Ascention and Mediatorship and he himself has undesignedly acquitted  W Penn  from his present Charge of  Deism  by a story he told in his first  Narrative  P That upon some urging him to give an Instance of one English  Quaker  that he ever heard Pray to Christ  W Penn  being present said  I am an English Man and a Quaker and I own I have oft Prayed to Christ Jesus even him that was Crucified  This he says was in the Year Which was Five Years after the Publishing of that Book from which he attempts to prove him a  Deist  that is a Denyer of the Man Christ Jesus who was Crucified Judge now Reader how Rank the Malice of  G Keith  must needs be against  W Penn  and his Brethren the  Quakers  who would choose to subject himself with them to the foul imputation of  Deism  though in his own Conscience he knows the Charge is false on them as well as  on himself rather then not gratifie his Envy and Revenge upon them In this resembling the Envious Man in the  Apologue  who desired that he might loose one of his Eyes on Condition his Neighbour might loose both his  Whence th' Observation rose a wicked Will  Would wound it self to work another's Ill  But before he had finished this Answer tho' he had gone about two thirds through it  Benjamin Coole  of  Bristol  Published a Book there Intituled  Honesty the truest Policy shewing the Sophistry Envy and Perversion of  George Keith  in his Three Books  viz  His Bristol Quakerism▪Bristol Narrative  And his  Deism  On Perusal of which  viz  His Answer to  G Keith's Deism  c  T E  writ the following Verses  INDEED Is then the Work by me begun  And which I labour'd at with such good Will  Already by a readier Workman done  Who Nimbleness hath added to his Skill  Well may it thrive Successful may it prove  Truth's way to Clear and StumblingBlocks Remove  I never was Ambitious to appear  In Print nor to my self Applause have sought  With satisfaction therefore I can bear  What thon design'st another hand hath wrought  This superceeds my Work I'm glad to see  Such help come in that there's no need of me  This is the third Time I have thus been put  Besides my Work which makes me think my Friend  The Controversial Door to me is shut  And of my scribling Service there's an End  If so Content I can with pleasure see  The Work well done although not done by me  T E  th th Month  The three Times he was put besides his Work of which he says this was the Third The other Two I suppose were his  Remarks on  Gerrard Croese's  History of the  Quakers And his Answer to  The Snake in the Grass  his Book called  Satan Disrob'd  Both before mentioned  However this of  B C  's Anticipating his Answer to the  Deism  he laid it by and never finished it thinking perhaps the other tho' far short of his might suffice at present for an Answer thereto and so we were deprived of his Labour in this respect also Which yet I hope one time or other may be Published for the Service of Truth which its pity the World should be deprived of  His next Service upon a general Foot which I find any Footsteps of was on this Occasion One  John Shockling  a Priest of  Ash  near  Sandwich  in  Kent  having got some of the  Snake  's Books set up for an Opposer or Disputant about  WaterBaptism  and sends a Paper to  John Love  Called  A Question upon those Words in  Mathew  Go ye therefore and Teach all Nations Baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Whether  the Apostles were not commanded by them to baptize with Water  This Paper and Question our Friend  T E  answered in the th Month very much to the purpose To which the  Priest  being unwilling to take an Answer and let it drop so replying I might say to little purpose  T E  writ a Rejoinder in the th Month  Both which Answer and Rejoinder being very pertinent to the Purpose and notable on that Subject I should insert some part of it but that it was only private and never published that I know of And therefore I would not begin to be the first Publisher thereof  But now we come to his great Work of the  History of the Old Testament  which at his Leisure he had in Hand for some Years and both he and we had this Advantage of his being put by his Work in answering Adversaries particularly that of the Snake and  G K  's  Deism  having now seem'd to have done with Controversie that he had the more Time and Leisure to prosecute this more excellent Work which having finished in  he brought it up to  London  to shew it to Friends for their Perusal and Approbation Which being done it was published in Folio the next Year  under the Title of  Sacred History or the Historical Part of the Holy Scriptures of the Old Testament Gathered out from the other Parts thereof and digested as near as well could be into due Method with respect to Order of Time and Place with some Observations here and there tending to illustrate some Passages therein  In his Preface to  which having mentioned the Praise of History out of  Cicero  viz That it is  The Witness of Times the Light of Truth the Life of Memory  c which he thinks cannot be so well verefied of any particular History as of that which being written by divinelyinspired Penmen is contained in the Books of the Old and New Testament Then speaking of the Motive or Inducement to the Undertaking Two things he says more especially led him to it One That the Divine Providence the Wisdom Power Goodness and Favour of God in ordering disposing providing for preserving defending and wonderfully delivering his Servants and People out of the greatest Straits Difficulties Hardships Dangers and Sufferings being more directly and in a continued Series and Course of Actions set before the Readers Eye he might be thereby the more stirred up and engaged to admire and magnifie to love reverence and fear the Lord and be the more careful not to offend Him The other Motive was That all the Youth especially of either Sex under what soever Religious Denomination they go might be furnished with such an Entertainment to spend at least their Leisure Hours upon as might yield them at once both Profit and Delight After which he proceeds to speak of the Manner of Performance under Eight Heads The Substance of which are  That in digesting the following History he hath not strictly tied himself to the Letter and very Syllables of the Text but with all  due Circumspection and Care to retain the Matter and Sense hath sometimes varied the Expressions  c  Where he hath left the last  English Translation  of the BIBLE he hath followed for the most part some other  English  or  Latin  or the Judgment of some eminently Learned  Expositors  As to the Chronology especially with respect to the Times of the Judges and Kings of  Israel  and  Judah  he found so much Incertainty and so little Certainty or Agreement amongst Interpreters about it that he had a Mind to have left it out but at the Desire of some he added it in the Margin wherein for the most part he followed  R Blome's History of the Old and New Testament  The few Helps he says he had were chiefly from Dr  Gell's Essay towards an Amendment of the last  English  Translation of the Bible Hugh Broughton's Consent of Scripture Godwin's Moses and Aaron The Annotations of  Tremelius  and  Junius And for Names of Persons and Places the  Tables  of  Robert F Herry  The whole Work is divided into Three Parts without any particular Regard had to the  Seven Periods of Time  into which Chronologers and Historiographers out of a Desire to reduce them to some sort of Proportion with the  Six Days Work  and  Seventh Days Rest  in the first Week of the Creation have generally divided the Ages of the World from  Adam  until now Of these three Parts the first reaches from the Creation to the Death of  Moses  when the Children of  Israel  being come to the Borders of the Promised Land  the second Time were ready to enter in and contains the Remarkables in the Five Books of  Moses  taking in  Job  between  Genesis  and  Exodus  The second Part beginning with the Book of  Joshua  goes through that and the Book of  Judges  with the first Book of  Samuel  and carries on the History from the Death of  Moses  to the Death of  Saul  and the Account that was brought to  David  of it In which are recounted the Transactions of chief Note under all the  Judges  and  Saul  the first Anointed King of  Israel  The third Part by much the largest goes on with the second Book of  Samuel  thro' the rest of the Canonical Scripture sets forth the Reigns of the Kings of  Israel  and  Judah  throughout the  Jewish Monarchy  with the most remarkable Acts and Occurrences therein from  David  to the Return of the last  Babylonish Captivity  and Rebuilding of the Temple taking in the Prophets as near as may be in their several Times  Then he gives Account who hath writ on this Subject particularly a Treatise called  The General View of the Holy Scriptures  supposed to be the Learned  Broughton  's which  T E  commends as a useful Discourse in its kind And of late Years  Chr Ness  his  History and Mystery of the Old and New Testament  in four Volumes A Book says he well fraught with Variety of useful Matter but wittily observes the Mystery is not only interwoven with the History but hath also so much overgrowu it that the Reader who desires to peruse the History by it  self will be at some Loss in that respect And that which promises most to answer his End he says is  R Blome's History of the Old and New Testament  A Work indeed says he not only instructive and delightful but pompous and magnificent A Character that may justly be apply'd to his own except the Word  pompous  A Work indeed it is both pleasant and profitable such judicious Observations and witty though grave Turns on Passages and Things as make it as well as his other Writings not only pleasant to read but profitable to the Reader A Work that will remain a Monument of his Worth and Ingenuity to Generations to come  I would only add That there is a Book of  Sulpitius Severus  intituled  Sacred History  but as that is in  Latin  and far short of this of  T E  's so this cannot interfere with that or be justly thought to be in Imitation of it  About this time we entred into a more particular Correspondence by Letters on several Occasions which we continued at times almost 'till his Death So that I usually imparted to him the most remarkable Occurrences that passed here and often advised with him in the most important Affairs as I had Occasion and he in Requital was always ready to Answer me in a very obliging manner in any thing I desired And I must acknowledge he was very helpful to me by his Advice in some Controversies I had with some late Adversaries which I shall not now name some of them being gone  to their Graves and his friendly Correspondence was always very acceptable and instructive as well as grateful to me in his agreeable Letters of which I have many by me Some of which he hath inserted in his  Decades  The next Year  viz  there followed an Intercourse of some Letters between him and  William Sewell  of  Holland  upon some particular Points which led into a Friendly Correspondence between them in some other Matters not unpleasant to read Several of which Letters of  T E  's are in his  Decades  with many others to divers Persons Friends and others on various Subjects Which if ever it should be thought meet to publish them or any of them they would I doubt not be very instructive as well as diverting  His next publick Work was on this Occasion About this time a Book was published by a Nameless Author called  A Divine Treatise written by way of Essay  pretending  to demonstrate according to the  Mosaical Philosophy  WaterBaptism Imposition of Hands and the Commemoration of the Death and Passion of our ever blessed Lord and Saviour under the Species of Bread and Wine  c This Treatise coming accidentally or providentially to our Friend  Thomas Ellwood  's Hands as he says in his Preface he observed that the Design of the Author therein was To reintroduce and set up again those  Typical Representations  therein treated of among those who have been led by the Lord out of the use thereof into a more spiritual  Dispensation And finding his Understanding in some measure Opened to see the Danger and Mischief of that Undertaking and his Spirit withal stirred in him against it he felt a Concern upon his Mind to publish his  Observations  which he had made thereon that others might the more clearly see and readily escape the Snare therein laid to entangle them and draw them into Bondage to outward Ceremonies and elementary Shadows again This he did in a Book Printed  intituled  The glorious Brightness of the GospelDay dispelling the Shadows of the Legal Dispensation and whatsoever else of Humane Invention hath been superadded thereunto  And hoped to make it evident that they are not of the Nature of the Gospel Dispensation nor have by any Divine Institution a continued Place or Service in the Church of Christ without taking Notice who or what he was that writ it  'Since the Author of the Treatise says  T E  under my Observation hath thought fit to conceal his Name I shall not pry behind the Curtain which himself hath thereby drawn before him or concern my self to enquire either who or what he is or has been but without any regard to that shall directly apply my self to give a plain Answer to the most material Parts of his Treatise  which he did to the purpose in a close and nervous Answer it being indeed an excellent Treatise well worth the Perusal of every impartial Reader To whom therefore I recommend it  And now I must say something of him under another Consideration as well as Writing He had writ several Books against Tythes as before hinted to shew the Unsuitableness of them to the Gospel Dispensation being  Jewish  in their Original and  Popish  in their Revival and that the Obligation of paying them was ceased under the Gospel as to any  Divine Right  from Scripture And now it fell to his Lot to suffer also in his turn for his Testimony against the Payment of them  For to him it was given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe in him  and bear witness to his Coming in the Flesh and offering up himself to put an End to the Law and Priesthood Tythes and Offerings  but also to suffer for his sake  being prosecuted with three Friends more  viz John Penington Abraham Butterfield  and  William Catch  in the  Exchequer  for Tythes at the Suit of  Joshua Leaper  TytheFarmer of  Amersham  in the County of  Bucks  under  Humphry Drake  Clerk Rector and Parson so called of the Rectory and ParishChurch of  Agmondesham  alias  Amersham  aforesaid  Thomas Ellwood  with the rest were  Subpoena'd  to appear at  Westminster  in  TrinityTerm  which they did by an Attourney to prevent being in Contempt of the Court and took a Copy of the Complainants Bill But for not Answering Attachments were issued out in  Michaelmas Term  to take them up on which they were taken into Custody in the Eleventh Month and afterwards an  Habeas Corpus  sent down to the Sheriff of  Bucks  to bring them up to the  Exchequer  Bar  Bar in  Trinity Term  on which they came up And to to prevent the Plantiffs going on to a Sequestration by default they put in their Answers setting forth the Value of the Tythes according to the best of their Knowledge Yet so vexatious was the Adversary that he would not be satisfied with their Answer but got a Commission of Enquiry to Examine Witnesses in the Country as to the Value of the Tythes which they did at  Amersham  in the Tenth Month The first Witness they examined was one  E G  of the Parish of  Chesham  Aged as they say Fourty four Years or thereabouts who deposed  That he knew the Complainant and Defendants and had known the Complainant about Sixty Years  which was about Sixteen Years before he was born Whereby we may Judge of the rest of his Evidence The Charge of which Commission and executing it came to between Thirty and Fourty Pounds though some of it was abated on taxing the Cost and yet they proved little if any thing more than the Defendants had set down in their Answers yet went on to a hearing on it and obtain'd a Decree for the Tythes and Cost For not performing which Attachments were issued out afresh against them in  TrinityTerm  to the Sheriff of  Hartfordshire    TE AB  and  WC  living in that County but  JP  living in  Bucks  was drop't because the Attachments to the Sheriff of  Hartfordshire  would not reach him and then a Proclamation but the Sheriff living remote did  not endeavour to take them and the Prosecutor seemed rather to aim at a  Sequestration  on their Goods and Estates than their Bodies so that seeing them resolved to go on the Defendants to prevent it offer'd to surrender themselves to the Sheriff but he return'd them each  Non est Inventus  and they got a Commission of  Rebellion  antedated and moved for a Serjeant at Arms the same Day to run them to a Sequestration in all haste  Leaper  being Sick and bad like to die least he should not live till it was accomplish'd but being so  illegal  at least in point of time for that there ought to be Eight Days between the  Test  and  Return of the Writ  in Miles off  London  and beyond on our appearing against it they could not obtain it till  Hillary Term  In which time  Leaper  recovered and one might have hoped that he might have repented but instead thereof then got a  Sequestration  against them and their Estates both Real and Personal for Tythes of  Thomas Ellwood  which was but        And  Abraham Butterfield  's        And  William Catch  's        And Cost as tax'd by the Deputy        In all for Tythes and Cost        For which they seized and took from  T E  in HousholdGoods Bedding Pewter  c  throwing out the Meat to take the Dishes to the Value of  l  And a Horse he used to ride on which he would not have took Five  Gueneas  for  In all about        Which they sold working and hobling about the Horse till they had almost spoil'd him all for about        And from  Abraham Butterfield  Cattle Corn Hay  c  to the value of which they Sold by their own Account for so much        And from  William Catch  they took by their Account  Grass  c        And a Years Rent of his House deducting for Taxes shillings        Being about  l per Annnm  which they seized and kept till paid which for Four Years since the time called  Michaelmas  when they gave in their Account came to        In all from  W C  about        Seized taken in the  whole  about        For Tythes and Cost        More than demanded        And yet what by Charge of  Sequestration  making out and selling the Corn Selling underhand  c  they brought in the Defendants in Debt and wanted more  I have been the larger in this Account to shew the Proceeding of the  Exchequer  and the Fruit of Tythes to ruin the QUEEN's Subjects for small Matters when they might recover  by  JusticesWarrants  to the value of  l  with the hundredth part of the Charge  Now we come to the second Volume of his Great Work the  History of the New Testament  which he had had in Hand at times for the most Part since he finished his former and when he had finished this he brought it up to  London  for  Friends  Perusal and Approbation where it was Read and afterwards published this Year in Folio under the same Title with the former only as that was of the Old Testament this was of the New  viz Sacred History or the Historical Part of the Holy Scriptures of the New Testament  c as in the Title of the former which as I gave some Account of so it behoves I should of this The former Treatise says he in his Preface having found a favourable Reception he was thence encouraged to resume his Pen which at the close of that Volume he had let fall and proceed to the Methodizing of the Historical Part of the New Testament in Two Parts In the first Part whereof the Reader will find an Account of the Conception Birth Life Travels Doctrines Discourses Miracles Sufferings Death Burial Resurrection and Ascention of our Blessed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST the Author of the true Christian Religion plainly fairly and succinctly given ushered in with a brief Account of the Conception Birth Manner of Life Ministry and Death of his Forerunner  John  Sirnamed the  Baptist  And attended in the Second  Part with a like Historical Account of the Acts and Travels of the Apostles of our Lord in the Propagation of his Blessed Gospel after the Ascention of our blessed Saviour so far at least as the Evangelist  Luke  in the Acts of the Apostles hath recorded or the Clue or Thread of the Holy Text leads him beyond which he says he was not willing to adventure  c  In this Undertaking he says he aimed at the same End as in the former  viz  That all the Youth especially of either Sex under whatsoever religious Denomination they go might be further furnished with such an Entertainment to spend at least their Leisure Hours upon as might yield them at once both Profit and Delight and might be thereby drawn off from misspending their precious Time upon other either hurtful or at best unprofitable Subjects Then he gives Account why he hath with the Matter of Fact delivered the Discourses Speeches Sermons and Doctrines delivered by our blessed Lord to his Disciples  c  viz That the Nature of the History required it and that without it the Discourse would have been less profitable and pleasant to the Reader and by that means less conducive to the End he proposed which is to allure him to read the Holy Scriptures with Delight  c  according to the Poet  He certainly doth hit the white  Who mingleth Profit with Delight  After which he gives an Account of his going from Place to Place in the  Evangelists  to reduce the several Parts and Passages of the History in the first Part to their due and Proper Times and Places which he endeavoured to do tho' difficult as near as he could But the Second Part the Acts being all written by one Hand the Method he says is more regular and the Course of the History more clear Yet the Apostolical Epistles being without Date are hardly he conceives to be reduced with indubitable Certainty to exact Order which yet he hath endeavour'd to place them right according to the best of his Understanding Then owning the Helps he had in Compiling this History had been chiefly from the  Criticks  and  Cradock  's  Harmony of the four Evangelists  and his  Apostolical History  with a few Words of the Performance which if not done as it should nor as he would yet as well as he could And therefore in all Humility recommending and committing it to the Divine Disposal he concludes his Preface  Next to the Preface is an Introduction concerning the Penmen of the New Testament and in what Language Originally written and in what Order of Time particularly of the four Evangelists  Matthew Mark Luke  and  John  what they were the time of their Writing and some particular Circumstances concerning them and their Ends well worth the Readers Perusal for the better understanding the History both of the Evangelists and Apostles So proceeds to  the History which he deduces from the  Promised Seed  after the Fall for Man's Restoration which the Prophets foretold the Coming of and which he pleasantly draws out at large in Order of Time and explains with the like judicious Observations as in the former taking in the Epistles of St  Paul  c in the second Part in their proper Places as near as could be and gives an Account of them the Occasion why the manner how and time when they were written ending with the Revelations which he renders as a Revelation unrevealed with some Brief Notes on it The whole as I said of the former being both pleasant and profitable Both which will remain a lasting Monument of him in time to come  This Year our Friend  Oliver Sansom  formerly of  Faringdon  since of  Abington  in  Berkshire  who had long War with the Priests about Tythes dying in the d Month and leaving behind him  An Account of some Remarkable Passages of his Life  which he Communicated in his Life time to our Friend  T Ellwood  to peruse who being always ready to be helpful and serviceable to all especially his Friends he Transcribed the same and fitted it for the Press which was Printed this Year to which  T E  prefixed a Testimony concerning him pertinent to the Occasion  There is one Book more of his which he published in his Lifetime which it seems he had had by him for the most part a long time and after he had finished his  Sacred History of the New  Testament  he took in hand to finish and compleated And that is  The Life of  DAVID  in Verse  first begun for his own Diversion not then thinking of the Press and carried on by degrees to the End of the Third Book in the Year as hinted before in that Year when the  Prince of Orange  Landing and the Nation being in Arms the Noise of  Guns  and Sounds of  Drums  and  Trumpets  so affrighted and disturbed his peaceful Muse as he says in his Preface that both she for a while forsook him and he thereupon the Work for above Twenty Years save that on a Review observing how abruptly  David  was brought in he added the first Chapter of the first Book to introduce his Hero from the Beginning of his Story Where it rested again without any Prospect of its ever going further until the last Winter  When having as he says less Health and more Leisure than at sometimes before he took it up for an Entertainment to make some uneasie Hours pass somewhat less uneasily over And after he had read it through considering that if after his Death it should be found among his Papers and committed to the Press it would be but an imperfect Piece he found an Inclination to carry on the Story to the End of  David  's Life I wish he had done so by his own And giving a kind Invitation to his gentle Muse to return which by some short Visits on particular Occasions in the Interval had given him some Ground to hope she had not quite forsook him he entred again upon the Subject where he had  left off and by degrees went through it till he had brought his  warlike Hero  to his  peaceful Grave  After it was finished deliberating whether to publish it himself or leave it as a  Posthume  to be published by some kind Hand after his Death for some Reasons particularly That if any should  Carp  at it he might be capable to answer for himself he thought best to publish it in his Life time and accordingly brought it up with him when he came to the  YearlyMeeting  but not having then an Opportunity to have it Read he came up again with it some time after which I think was the last time he was at  London  and after Reading committed it to the Press this Year under the Title of  DAVIDEIS The Life of  David  King of  Israel  A Sacred Poem in five Books  in Octavo Tho' as he observes  Abraham Cowley  writ a Poem called  Davideis  he had not read it till after he had finished his and besides their different way of Writing  A C  's was but of the Troubles of  David  in his Youth and that not half finished And that he had the same Aim in this as in that of his  Sacred History  aforesaid Which Book begins thus  I Sing the Life of  David Israel  's King  Assist thou sacred Pow'r who did'st him bring  From the Sheepfold and set him on the Throne  Thee I invoke on thee rely alone  Breath on my Muse and fill her slender Quill  With thy Refreshing Dews from  HermonHill  That what she Sings may turn unto thy Praise  And to thy Name may lasting Trophies Raise  But I would not Anticipate the Reader but leave him to Read and Judge for himself as it deserves  I shall Conclude his Works and Writings with a Copy of Verses he formerly Writ which though out of Course as to Time is so well worth the Inserting that I hope they will make amends for being misplaced  viz  O That mine Eye might closed be  To what becomes me not to see  That Deafness might possess mine Ear  To what concerns me not to hear  That  Truth  my Tongue might always ty  From ever speaking Foolishly  That no vain Thought might ever rest  Or be conceived in my Breast  That by each Word each Deed each Thought  Glory may to my God be brought  But what are Wishes Lord mine Eye  On thee is fixt to thee I Cry  O purge out all my Dross my Tin  Make me more white than Snow within  Wash Lord and purifie my Heart  And make it clean in every part  And when 'tis clean Lord keep it too  For that is more than I can do  T E  Thus having gone through his Printed Books and Papers which I have endeavoured to give  a plain and succinct Account of and of him out of them as far as I could and with as much Brevity as well might be I shall now speak somewhat of him in his Private Capacity and other Services and Station in the Church with his Death and Character and so Conclude the Whole  He lived many Years if not most of his Time especially after he was Married at  HungerHill  in the Parish of  Agmondesham  alias  Amersham  in  Buckinghamshire  though his House stood in  Hartfordshtre  as aforesaid where the Monthly Meetings of Men and Women were constantly kept for that part of the County of  Bucks  Wherein he was very Serviceable in Writing Advising and Exhorting to keep all things Well and in good Order according to Truth and the Testimony thereof and had a Peculiar Gift for Government in the Church and ordering things in Monthly and Quarterly Meetings and used to come up constantly to the YearlyMeeting at  London  and was very Serviceable therein not only by his Grave Counsel and Advice but also in Reading and Writing on occasion especially in difficult Matters He had a singular Talent in Indicting and Composing of things Epistles and Papers beyond many so that I must needs say he was an Ornament to the Meeting and will be much missed therein and many other ways His Wife Died about Five Years before him being a Solid Weighty Woman who had a Publick  Testimony for the Lord and his Truth in Meetings and therefore the greater Loss to him and Friends And for himself he lived a Private Retired Life not concerning himself with much Business in the World but gave himself much to Reading and Writing and lived in good Repute among Friends and all sorts of People as far as ever I heard of to a pretty good Age but bore his Age very well being of a Regular Life and Healthy Constitution only in his latter Years was somewhat troubled at times with an  Asthma  And at last he was taken ill of a  Palsie  the d Day of the d Month  which he bore with great Patience and Resignation an Account of which and his Dying Words I leave to them who were with him in the time of his Sickness the th day of which he departed this Life the st of the d Month in the th Year of his Age  Having served his Generation according to the Will of God he fell a Sleep  and was Honourably Buried the d Day following being the th of the d Month at  Jordans  Being accompanied from his own House by a great many Friends and others to the MeetingHouse there the Meeting he belong'd to and Interr'd in the BuryingGround belonging thereto where was a very large Meeting and great Appearance of Friends and others several Publick Friends being there from  London  and other Parts and divers Living Testimonies born to the Truth he Lived and Died in in a Living Remembrance of him and his Services in the Church A Man of a Comely Aspect of a  Free and Generous Disposition of a Courteous and Affable Temper and Pleasant Conversation a Gentleman Born and Bred a Scholar a True Christian an Eminent Author a Good Neighbour and Kind Friend whose Loss is much Lamented and will be much missed at Home and Abroad The Lord if it be his Will Raise up many more such Pillars Elders and Overseers of his  Flock  and  Family  as Watchmen upon  Sion's  Walls for his Honour and the benefit of his Church and People saith my Soul  Amen  J W  London  the    th of the    th Month    POSTSCRIPT  SINCE the Writing of the foregoing  Supplement  I have Understood that our Friend  Thomas Ellwood  after he had finished and Published his  Davideis  signified  That he had but one thing more that lay upon his Mind and that was to add something to his  Journal  or Account of his  Life  which was chiefly to give an Account of his  Books  and  Writings Which as it shews he had not done it or finished it before and 'tis to be doubted he did not after not Living long after that and so no more to be expected more's the Pity from his own Hand So it shews what his design was as to what he  intended to have added to it had he Lived to perform it or had not Death prevented him So that the foresaid  Supplement  seems in some sort at least to Answer his own Intention though far short as was said of what his own Hand could have done yet so far as it does any way answer his Mind I am therein Glad that I have done any service to his Memory or the Truth in that respect having endeavoured to represent things according to his own Mind and to speak of him and things as probably he would have done it he had been Living and hope the Reader will accept it the better To whom therefore I recommend it as giving at least a fair Character of the Books he Writ and Controversies he Managed both Published and Unpublished which I hope will be no Disservice but Service to the  Truth  as it is intended in the Fear of God To whose Honour and the Service of his  Truth  I desire with great Sincerity to Dedicate the remainder of my Days and Rest  A Friend to all Men  J W  A Catalogue of his Printed BOOKS before mentioned    AN Alarm  Priests c  Pr Sheet

Moderate ENQUIRER  Robert Snow  WE received a Paper subscribed by thee and directed to the Church or People of God called  Quakers  c Which Paper contains some  Objections  which thou sayst thou hast heard spoken against us and wherein thou desirest to be satisfied To which we say It is no strange Thing to us to be spoken against by the World's Teachers that being no more than befel the People of God in the First breaking forth of Christianity in the World Of whom it was said  Acts    As concerning this Sect we know that every where it is spoken against  But we are willing to endeavour thy Satisfaction by Answering the  Objections  The First is  You own no Day either the First or Last as a Sabbath to the Gentiles  Answer  The Sabbath which was the seventh or last Day of the Week was given to the  Jews Ex    Rom  Not to the  Gentiles Psal    Rom  and was to last as other typical Ordinances  were  untill the time of Reformation Heb    till the Seed should come Gal    which was Christ ver    the Lord of the Sabbath Mat    who in the Fulness of time did blot out the Hand writing of Ordinances  c  and took it out of the way nailing it to his Cross Col  From whence the Apostle thus infers  Let no man therefore judge you  the Saints and faithful Brethren  Col    in Meat or in Drink or in respect of an Holy Day or of the New Moon or of the Sabbath Days Col  which says he  are a Shadow of things to come but the Body is of Christ ver  Thus was that  Sabbath  which was given by God to his People the  Jews  ended and taken away by Christ before the  Gentiles  were called to be his People And as for the  First Day  of the Week we do not read in the Holy Scriptures that it is called the  SabbathDay  or commanded to be kept and observed for a  Sabbath  as the  Seventh Day  had been But on the contrary we find the Apostle  Paul  writing to the  Romans  who were  Gentiles  though not without some mixture of believing  Jews  amongst them as appears  Acts  says  One Man esteems one Day above another  there was the believing  Jew    Another esteemeth every Day alike  there was the believing  Gentile  Well what then Doth he commend the Former of these and condemn the latter No but he says  Let every Man be fully perswaded in his own Mind  Rom And in the  th    th  and  th  verses disswades them from judging one another about the Observing or not observing a Day as well as about the Eating or not eating of Meats and seems to lay no more Stress upon the one than the other And if the Drift of the Apostle's discourse there be heedfully minded it will appear that as he sets him who believed he might eat all Things with him that esteemed every Day a like and him that esteemed one Day above another with him that eat Herbs So he imputes the Weakness to the Latter  ver  and sets himself on  the other side saying  We then that are strong ought to bear the Infirmities of the weak  Chap And he tells the  Galatians  which though a  Gentile Church  had also  Jewish  Believers in it  I am afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you Labour in vain  Gal Why so  Ye observe Days and Months and Times and Years  says he  ver  So Jealous was the Apostle lest any that had been gathered from outward Observations and from a shadowy State should imbondage themselves again in Shadows and fall short of injoying the Substance which is the true Gospel  Rest that remains to the People of God  Heb Which in the next Verse is described to be Their  Ceasing from their own Works as God did from His Into which Rest we  saith the Apostle  that have believed do enter  ver And in the Verse he presses others to labour to enter into that Rest Now when the Apostle says  There remains a Rest  it plainly implies that the former Rest the outward Sabbatical Rest did not  remain  but was passed away and gone Nor is it reasonable to suppose that the Rest here mentioned which is said to  Remain to the People of God  was an outward bodily Resting from outward bodily Labour on whatsoever Day both as that would be but to change one Type or Figure for another And as the entring into this Rest is set forth in the Text as a Matter of Labour and Difficulty  ver  as it is indeed yet blessed be the Lord he hath enabled some that have believed in his Name and subjected to his Power to enter into this Rest in this his Day and many are pressing after it as the true abiding GospelRest which the Legal Sabbath was but a Type or Shadow of  The d Objection is  You deny the Scriptures to be any Rule for Man or Woman to walk by so as to direct them to the saving of their Souls  Answer  In this we are misrepresented We sincerely own love and regard the Holy Scriptures believing  with the Apostle that  they were given by Inspiration of God and are profitable for Doctrine for Reproof for Correction for Instruction in Righteousness that the Man of God may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good Works    Tim  and that  they are able to make wise unto Salvation through Faith that is in Christ Jesus ver  And great benefit and delight we find in them reading them in the openings of that Divine Spirit by which they were given forth We are so far from denying them to be  any  Rule  c  that we acknowledge them to contain  many  excellent Rules Precepts Doctrines and Instructions directing Man and Woman how to walk that they may obtain the Salvation of their Souls Yet we do not say as some have done that the Scriptures are the  only  Rule or the  chief  and  principal  Rule because we dare not give the Honour and Office of the Holy Spirit unto the Scriptures For the Scriptures themselves declare That  it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to guide Believers into all Truth John  And indeed the true Meaning and Benefit of the Scriptures themselves is not attained to in the Reading of them unless the Spirit that gave them forth do open them and unseal the Mysteries contained in them So that the Holy Spirit is greater than the Scriptures and therefore we cannot but give the chief Place unto him For he is able to manifest himself unto Man and to lead Man into the Way of Salvation either with and by the Scriptures or without them as he pleases But the Scriptures cannot do that without the Operation of the Holy Spirit Justly therefore do we affirm the Spirit of God to be the  Chief  Rule and yet acknowledge the Holy Scriptures to be a true Rule and proper Instrument in the Hand of the Spirit to direct Men and Women how they ought to walk to obtain Salvation to their Souls as the Spirit of the Lord makes use of the Scriptures to that End  The d OBJECTION is  You deny the Resurrection of this mortal Body that this Mortal shall not put on Immortality  Answer  In this also we are misrepresented We do not deny but own the Resurrection of the Dead Believing with the Apostle that  This Corruptible shall put on Incorruption and this Mortal shall put on Immortality  Cor And indeed if we did not believe this we might well say as he did  If in this Life only we have Hope in Christ we were of all Men most miserable  ver  And Why stand we in jeopardy every Hour  ver But the Lord knows and we have openly and sincerely declared that we believe and own the Resurrection of the Dead according as the Holy Scriptures testify concerning it Which say  Thou sowest not that Body that shall be but bare Grain  c  But God giveth it a Body as it hath pleased him and to every Seed his own Body  ver  It is sown a natural Body it is raised a Spiritual Body  ver the reason of which follows  ver  namely  That Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption  And as we firmly believe this So we take this to be sufficient without being so curiously inquisitive as he who would needs ask  How are the Dead raised up and with what Body do they come  ver and was called  Fool  for his Pains  ver    The th OBJECTION is  You suffer Women to be your Teachers that were forbid by the Apostle for he says that they should keep silence  Answer  The  Jews  of old had a strong Persuasion grounded upon some misunderstood Places of Scripture that the Salvation of God was confined to them and belonged not at all to the  Gentiles  And this Opinion had prevailed so far upon them that even those of them that received the Gospel could not easily shake it off In so much that after  Peter  had been with  Cornelius  the  Centurion  and was come  back again to  Jerusalem  he was called before the Church for it  they that were of the Circumcision contending with him  and  saying Thou went'st in to Men uncircumcised and did'st eat with them  Act To whom having related the Occasion and Particulars of that Matter he concludes his Defence thus  For as much then as God gave them the like Gift as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could withstand God  ver And in the next verse it follows  when they heard these Things they held their Peace and glorified God  c This Answer which the Apostle gave in that Case may be suitable we think for us to give in this Case to such as from some misunderstood Places of Scripture are offended at us for Suffering Women to speak in our Assemblies  viz  For as much as God hath given them the like Gift as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what are we that we should withstand God God by his Servant  Joel  in the Time of the Law had made this Promise with Relation to the Times of the Gospel  viz And it shall come to pass afterwards    or in the last Days as  Peter  repeats it  Act  that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh and your Sons and your Daughters shall prophecy your old Men shall dream Dreams your young Men shall see Visions And also upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in those Days will I pour out my Spirit  Joel And they shall prophecy adds  Peter  Act Here was no Distinction of Sex made But this Promise of  pouring out the Spirit  and of  prophesying  thereby is extended as expresly and fully to the Daughters as to the Sons to the Handmaids as to the Servants And this the Apostle  Peter  doth expresly apply to that great  pouring forth of the Spirit upon the Church  at the Pentecost immediately after Christ's Ascension saying  This is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel  Acts Now at that great and eminent  pouring forth of the Spirit it appears the Women were not excluded For when after the Ascention the Apostles and Disciples were returned from Mount  Oliver  to  Jerusalem  it is said  These all continued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication with the Women and Mary the Mother of Jesus  c  Acts    The Number of the Names together being about an Hundred and Twenty  ver  And when the Day of Pentecost was fully come they were  all  with one accord in one Place  Chap And in Ver it is said  The cloven Tongues sate upon  each  of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance  ver Here was no Distinction made no shutting out the Women but all were together all received the Gift of the Spirit and began to  speake with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance  Nor was it thus only at that time and upon that extraordinary Occasion but continued in the Church afterwards For we read  that Philip the Evangelist had four Daughters that did prophesie  Acts  Phebe  a Woman is recommended by the Apostle  Paul  to the Church at  Rome  not only as a  Sister  but as a  Servant of the Church  Rom  Priscilla  a Woman is called by the same Apostle  My Helper  or Fellow Labourer  in Christ Jesus  ver  Tryphena  and  Tryphosa  two Godly Women are saluted by him as  Labourers in the Lord  And of the beloved  Persis  another holy Woman he testifies that  she laboured much in the Lord  ver The same Apostle in his Epistle to the  Philippians  says  I entreat thee also true Yoke Fellow help those Women which laboured with me in the Gospel  Phil Which is the Phrase by which the Apostle doth frequently express his own Ministry and which he particularly applies to  Timotheus  whom he calls  Our Brother and Minister of God and our Fellow Labourer in the Gospel of Christ  Thes Which is a clear Evidence  that those Women that had received the Gift of Prophesy did minister therein to the Edification of the Church as well as the Men Nay the Apostle  Paul  in that very Epistle wherein he is thought by some to discountenance  Womens Preaching  doth give Directions for the Manner of their  Preaching  or  Prophesying  viz  That they should do it with their Heads covered  For having first said  Every Man praying or prophesying having his Head covered dishonoureth his Head  Cor He adds  But every Woman that Prayeth or Prophesyeth with her Head uncovered dishonoureth her Head  ver This puts it out of doubt that Womens  Praying  and  Prophesying  in the Church was at that Time both lawful and usual as well as Mens  Now that by  Prophesying  here is meant  Preaching  not barely foretelling Things to come may not only be inferred from the use of the same Word in the verse foregoing where being spoken of Men it is granted on all Hands to intend  Preaching  and from thence the general practice of  Mens Preaching uncovered  is defended but may also fairly be concluded from the explanation the Apostle gives of it in Chap ver where he tells that Church in general  We may all Prophesy one by one that  all  may  learn  Which manifests that by  Prophesying  he intended  Preaching  or  Teaching  that being the proper way or means of  Learning  And in the Beginning of that Chapter where he prefers  Prophesying  before  Speaking whith Tongues  ver and he says  He that Prophesyeth Speaketh unto Men to Edification and Exhortation and Comfort  ver And  He that Prophesyeth Edifieth the Church  ver which plainly shew that by  Prophesying  he meant  Preaching  or  Teaching  that being the proper means or way of Edifying And therefore seeing he not only allowed Women to  Prophecy  but directed and advised them how they should perform it  Chap  and that in  this Place  Prophesying  and  Preaching  appear to be one and the same Thing it is unreasonable to suppose he denied them the Liberty of  Preaching  being gifted and called thereunto As for those Words of his Cor  Let your Women keep silence in the Churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but to be under Obedience as also saith the Law  Observe first that those Words  as also saith the Law  relate only to the Womens being under  Obedience  not to their keeping  silence  in the Church For that was never enjoyned them in the Law but they were permitted to speak in the Congregation And both  Miriam  who was a Prophetess did sing the Triumphs of the Lord in the publick Congregation  Ex  And  Deborah  who was a Prophetess did recount the noble Acts of the Lord and celebrate his Praises in a Triumphant Song  Judges  Read also what  Hanna  spake in the House of the Lord in  Shiloh    Sam  And  Anna  who was a Prophetess did not only give thanks unto the Lord but spake of Christ to all them that looked for Redemption in  Jerusalem Luke  This was direct  Preaching  and that  in the Temple  So that the Women were not enjoyned  silence  under the Law but were permitted to  Speak  In the next Place consider what Speaking it was that was forbidden by the Apostle in that Place  Cor  which from his following Words will appear to be not a Speaking of the Words of Life and Salvation not a Speaking as the Spirit of God gives utterance but speaking disorderly asking Questions unseasonably and out of place not speaking for the Edification of Others but speaking for their own Information only for he immediatly adds  If they will learn any Thing let them ask their Husbands at home  ver These Words  learn  and  ask  plainly shew that the Speaking here condemned was not a Speaking the  Doctrines  of the Gospel for the Edification of the  Church but  asking Questions  for their own Satisfaction which they might have done at home but not there therefore he adds  For it is a Shame for Women to speak in the Church  And so indeed it was in such a disorderly manner as they spake to interrogate or Catechise either the Minister or their Husbands openly in the Church to ask the Meaning of this or call for an Explanation of that which might look like a throwing off their Obedience to their Husbands and must needs occasion Disorders and Confusion in the Assembly which we may perceive was the thing that troubled the Apostle and which he laboured to reform for he said before  God is not the Author of Confusion but of Peace  ver and he concludes the Chapter with this Admonition  Let all things be done decently and in order  So that it was the disorderly Practice of some Women in that Church which he reproves who it seems when any Thing was spoken which they did not understand would interpose and  ask Questions  for Information sake which was uncomely in them offensive and troublesome to the Congregation This sort of  Speaking  was not permitted them but was a Shame to them and from which they ought to have kept silence  in the Church  and  if they will learn any thing  says he  let them ask their Husbands at home  Of like import are those other Words of the same Apostle to  Timothy  and probably on the same Occasion  Let the Woman  says he  learn in silence with all Subjection But I suffer not a Woman to teach nor to usurp Authority over the Man but to be in silence    Tim  For hence it appears still that the Occasion they took of speaking was under pretence of  learning  wherein they took an undue Liberty to  ask Questions  as if they would catechize or teach their Husbands But though the Apostle would not suffer such sort of Speaking in the Church as might give Occasion to any to think that the Women did cast off the Obedience  they owed and did usurp Authority over their Husbands nor after such a Manner as might breed Confusion in the Congregation for he was so watchful against that that he enjoins the Man to be silent in that Case as well as the Woman  If any Man  says he  speaks in an unknown Tongue let one interpret But if there be no Interpreter let him keep silence in the Church  Cor Yet we have before shewed that he allowed of  Women Prophesying  and that by  Prophesying  he meant  Preaching  We have also given many Instances of Women that laboured in the Work of the Gospel in that Day and could from a living and sure Experience multiply instances of many Women in this Day whom the Lord hath committed the Word of Life and Reconciliation unto and who in the quickning Power and Virtue thereof have sounded forth the same to the awakening of many that were asleep in Sin and turning of many  from darkness to Light  and from the  Power of Satan to God  who are now become living Seals of their Ministry Neither would this seem so strange as it doth to some did they duly consider That  God is no Respecter of Persons  But that as in the  old Creation  Male and Female were Created in the Image of God So in the  new Creation  Male and Female are all one in Christ Jesus  Gal  But as they that contended with  Peter  for conversing with the  Gentiles  when they had heard his Defence held their Peace and glorified God saying  Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto Life Acts  So we hope they that have taken Offence at us for suffering Women to speak in the Church when they shall have duly and impartially weighed what is herein offered for their Satisfaction will hold their Peace as to any Opposition thereunto and Glorifie God saying  Then hath God committed unto Women also the Word of Reconciliation  The fifth Objection is  You are a People that have gained Health to your Immortal Souls and are sure of Heaven when the Scriptures say that  the Righteous Man falls seven times a Day  and the Apostle  Paul  said that  Sin was still actually in him  Answer  We do not desire to boast of any Attainments Yet we cannot but confess to the Glory of God and the Praise of his Holy Name that His saving Health hath appeared in this his Day and we through his Mercy have tasted of it Christ the Saviour is manifested in Spirit and we through Grace have felt the healing Virtue of his Divine Life and Power Through the tender Mercy of our God the Dayspring from on high hath visited us and hath given Light to us that sate in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death and hath guided our Feet into the way of Peace and hath helped us to make our Calling and Election sure As for the Scripture thou mentionest we do not find that the Scripture saith  The Righteous Man falls seven times a Day  but in  Prov  we find it thus written  For a Just Man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the Wicked shall fall into Mischief  And as the Verse before shews the Occasion of these Words where it is said  Lay not wait O wicked Man against the Dwelling of the Righteous spoil not his resting place  So the latter Part of this th Verse  but the wicked shall fall into Mischief  implies that the just Man doth not fall as the wicked Man does  into Mischief  And seeing all Sin is Mischief it seems as if the Fall here spoken of the just Man were not a  falling into Sin  but into some outward Calamity or Exercise However the Place speaks nothing of  daily  or  continual falling  Nor do we remember that  Paul  doth use that very Expression concerning himself  viz That Sin was still actually in him  though we know that he doth in divers places run through as it were and open the various States and Travels  of the Soul in some of which he cried out  O wretched Man that I am who shall deliver  c But he rested not there but quickly breaks forth into a Rejoycing and cries out  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord  Rom And then in the next Chapter having said  There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit  he says expresly concerning himself  For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death  ver And again  Thanks be to God which giveth us the Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ  Cor This  Victory  we press after this  Freedom from the Law of Sin and Death  we labour and travel to attain unto by a Subjection through Divine Assistance to the  Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus  The th Objection is  Why your Teachers perswade you that all other People are in a barren and desolate Condition and are out of Christ  Answer  Our Teachers do not perswade us so nor do we Judge so of all other People For we our selves were gathered out of various Professions States and Conditions and some of us who had been seeking after the Lord in other Professions can remember that before we were thus gathered to this divine Principle of  Light  which the Lord hath set up in this his Day as an Ensign for the Nations to be gathered unto and to walk in we were not wholly barren and desolate but had at Seasons some touches and tastes of the Vertue of that hidden Life which we were then Strangers to the Lord having regard to the Sincerity of our Hearts and answering in some measure the Breathings of our Souls to him so far at least as to cherish and keep alive those good Desires which were begotten in us and to beget in us a greater Hunger and Thirst after him And it is not hard to us to believe that  so it may be with others at this Day who have an Integrity to the Lord though not acquainted with his Outgoings and Manifestations of himself in this Dispensation of  Light  and  Life  And both our Prayers to God the Father in and through his Son Jesus Christ and our Labour and Endeavours in the Openings of his Love and Life in our Hearts are That all these in whatsoever Profession may be drawn off from all the dry Hills and barren Mountains and gathered into the true Sheepfold For we remember our Saviour said  Other Sheep I have which are not of this Fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my Voice and there shall be one Fold and one Shepherd  Joh The Lord grant that none of these may mistake his Voice or disobey it  The last Objection is  You deny all outward Ordinances as  Baptism  and the  Six Principles  that were taught to the first primitive Christians  Answer  The Dispensation of the Law was  outward  and the Ordinances appertaining to that Dispensation were  outward  also But the Dispensation of the Gospel is spiritual and  inward  and the Ordinances appertaining to this Dispensation are of a spiritual Nature The  Baptism with Water  was  John  's and came up under the Dispensation of the Law nor did properly belong to the Gospel Dispensation though for a time by Condescention continued as Circumcision and some other Legal Rites were And this was that Baptism which  Paul  says Christ sent him not to baptize with  Cor  But the  Baptism of Christ  the true GospelBaptism that by which the true Believer is baptized into Jesus Christ  Rom  and buried with him into Death ver  The one Baptism  Eph is the  Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with Fire  and is plainly distinguished from the Baptism with Water both by  John  to whom the WaterBaptism  belonged and by Christ to whom the SpiritBaptism belonged For  John  said  I indeed baptize you with water unto Repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose Shoos I am not worthy to bear He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with Fire  Mat And Christ as  Luke  records a little before his Ascension said  John truly baptized with Water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many Days hence  Acts which was the Promise of the Father  ver  delivered by Christ to his Apostles and Disciples just before his parting from them  Luke  Let it therefore be fairly considered That the Dispensation of the Gospel is  Spiritual  and therefore the Ordinances belonging to it should be so too That in  Mat  From which place the Commission for WaterBaptism is usually fetched there is no Mention ef Water That Baptism with Water is no where in Scripture called Christ's Baptism That Baptism with Water is frequently called  John's Baptism  That the Baptism with the Holy Ghost is called  Christ's Baptism  That the Apostle  Paul  acknowledges but  One Baptism  Eph which cannot be supposed to be that with  Water  since then he must exclude the Baptism of the  Spirit  That the Apostle  Peter  speaking of the Baptism that saves says expresly  It is not the putting away the Filth of the Flesh  Pet which it is the Property of Water to do as if he had said  The Baptism which now saves us is not WaterBaptism  That Baptism with Water is no where expresly commanded in Scripture as it would doubtless have been had it been intended by Christ for a Gospel Ordinance That tho' it was sometimes used after Christ's Ascension yet that cannot authorize the use of it now any more than of Circumcision and other Legal Ordinances which in Condescention to the Weakness of Believers in that Day were also used  after Christ's Ascension yet are confest by all not to be in force now For  John  as himself said was to  decrease  Joh which related to his Ministry or Dispensation not to his Person Now a  Decreasing  implies a growing less or wearing away by degrees not all on a suddain or at once and therefore no wonder if his WaterBaptism was continued for a time even after Christ's Baptism of the Holy Spirit took place But as Christ's Baptism was to  increase  so  John  's was to  decrease  till Christ's came to be  all in all  and  John  's Water Baptism wholly to give place Let these things we say be duly weighed and we hope we shall not be blamed for leaving the Baptism of  John  and cleaving to the Baptism of  Christ  As for the  Six Principles  thou mentionest seeing thou hast not declared what they are it cannot be expected we should speak to them at this time But we recommend to thee that holy divine Principle of  Light  wherewith Christ  lighteth every Man that cometh into the World  Joh  In which Light the Nations of them that are saved shall walk  Rev And we heartily desire thou mayst walk therein  T E  AN ACCOUNT OF TYTHES In GENERAL  THE only Command from God that we read of in Holy Scripture for the Payment of Tythes was given by  Moses  to the People of  Israel  in the time of the  Levitical Law  Then God first reserved to himself the Tythe of the Land of Canaan  Lev  Which he did for this reason that intending to take the Tribe of  Levi  more peculiarly into his Service as he did  Numb  in stead of or in exchange for all the First born of  Israel  ver and and Chap ver Having before reserved and appropriated the First born to himself  Ex  he might bestow those Tythes on the  Levites  for and towards the Maintenance of that whole Tribe as a Reward for their Service in the Tabernacle of the Congregation  Numb  and in lieu of and Compensation for their Part or Share of and in the Land of  Canaan  which thereupon they were expresly cut off from ver  Now although it was grounded on a Principle of Moral Justice and Equity that the  Levites  thus engaged in a continual Attendance on a publick Service and shut out from their Share in the Inheritance of the promised Land should receive a sufficient  Maintenance from them for whom they performed that Service and who enjoyed their Part of the Land Yet the ascertaining of the  Quot a  of that Maintenance to the exact Proportion of a  Tenth Part  of the Increase of the Land was not grounded on moral Justice but had its Dependence on the Ceremonial Law adapted and limited to the Polity of that Dispensation and People only And that it might not be extended beyond its appointed Time and Bounds it pleased the Divine Wisdom to subject it to such Ceremonial Circumstances as plainly rank it amongst those carnal Ordinances Rites or Ceremonies which were imposed but  till the Time of Reformation  spoken of  Heb  For as God appointed the  Levites  to be offered for a  WaveOffering  by  Moses  in the Name and on the Behalf of the Children of  Israel  when he said to  Moses Thou shalt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Congregation and thou shalt gather the whole Assembly of the Children of Israel together And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord and the Children of Israel shall put their Hands upon the Levites And Aaron shall offer  in the Margin  Wave    the Levites before the Lord for an Offering  in the Margin  WaveOffering    of the Children of Israel that they may execute the Service of the Lord  Numb So the Tythes which were assigned for the Maintenance of the  Levites  were to be first offered by the People as an  HeaveOffering  unto the Lord  The Tythes of the Children of Israel which they offer as an HeaveOffering unto the Lord I have given to the Levites  c  Numb  And even the Tythe of those Tythes which the  Levites  were to yield unto the  Priests  were to be offered by the  Levites  as an  HeaveOffering  to the Lord before the  Priests  might have them  Thus speak unto the Levites  said God to  Moses    and say unto them When ye take of the Children of Israel the Tythe which I have given you from them for your Inheritance Then ye shall offer up an Heave Offering of it for the Lord even  a Tenth Part of the Tythe And this your HeaveOffering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the Corn of the threshing Floor  c  Thus ye also shall offer an HeaveOffering unto the Lord of all your Tythes which ye receive of the Children of Israel And ye shall give there of the Lord's HeaveOffering to Aaron the Priest  ver This makes it evident beyond doubting that the Tythes which were given by the People to the  Levites  and by the  Levites  to the  Priests  under the Law had their Dependence on the Ceremonial Law as that Priesthood had And were to stand no longer than that Law and that Priesthood stood Which was but till  Shiloh  came and by the Offering of himself once for all had put an end to all the shadowy Offerings under that Law  This the Author of the Epistle to the  Hebrews  did so well understand that he positively declared that  the Levitical Priesthood being changed there was made of Necessity a Change also of the Law  of that Law by which that Priesthood and the Maintenance of it had stood See  Heb  And 'tis also evident from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity that neither the Apostles themselves nor for some ages after them any of the Christians did meddle with or at all concern themselves about Tythes But let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated Part  viz  Offerings  c  and of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  But after that the Mystery of Iniquity which in the Apostles time began to work  Thes  had wrought to that Degree amongst some Christians and had drawn them so far from the Purity and Simplicity of the Gospel as to form and model the Church in many things by and according to the  Jewish  Pattern amongst other Ceremonial Parts of the  Jewish  Religion which had been abolished by the Coming and Death of Christ Tythes were preached up again about the latter end of the fourth Century and beginning of the fifth by some at first under the Notion  of Alms and Charity because part of the Tythes under the Levitical Law were appointed for the Maintenance of the Fatherless the Widow and the Stranger  Deut  And by others as then still due by the Mosaic Law which had required them to be paid to the Levitical Priesthood Which Plea afterwards Corruptions increasing in the Church and in those especially who were called the  ChurchMen  or  Clergy  more and more prevailing the Payment of Tythes was reintroduced as due by those Levitical Laws which had been given to the  Israelites  of old And upon that Bottom Tythes have stood been claimed and the Claim defended unto this Day  Now not only he that thus claims and receives Tythes but he that consents to and complies with such Claim by paying Tythes thus brought in and thus claimed doth thereby implicitly and vertually at least deny that Christ has put an End to the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  and consequently that he is come and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind And that this may appear as plain as is possible I shall draw the Matter into an Argument thus  To uphold any Thing as still in force which was to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ is to deny that Christ is come and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind  But to receive or pay Tythes now is to uphold a Thing as still in force which was to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ▪  Therefore to receive or pay Tythes now is to deny that Christ is come and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind  The  Major  must be granted and the  Minor  I thus prove  Whatsoever was  a part  of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  was to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ  But Tythes were a part of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  Therefore Tythes were to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ  The  Major  here again is unexceptionable And the  Minor  is thus proved  Every  HeaveOffering  among the  Jews  was  a Part  of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  But Tythes were an  HeaveOffering  among the  Jews  Num  Therefore Tythes were  a Part  of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  By this it appears that without regard had of the Person to whom or the Use for which Tythes are paid the paying of Tythes as well as the receiving them being  a Part  of the abrogated Ceremonial Law of  Moses  imports a denyal of the Coming and Death of  Christ  Hence it is that Tythes have been and are commonly called  Antichristian  or  against Christ  And hence hath risen that saying often used not only by our antient Friends but by some of the Martyrs long before  viz He that pays Tythes doth thereby deny that Christ is come in the Flesh  That Conclusion could not have been drawn from the paying of Tythes to a wrong Ministry or for a wrong use only though such Payment be evil Nor could any thing justify that Inference but the Consideration that Tythes depending on the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  which must of Necessity and in course fall and cease when Christ suffered the paying of Tythes carries in it a supposal that that Law is not yet ceased but is still in force and consequently that Christ whose Death must needs have ended it is not yet come nor has yet suffered in his Flesh for Mankind  That other Objection not less weighty than common against paying Tythes to the  Clergy  so called  viz  The unlawfulness of upholding a false Ministry to perform a false Worship being it self so  clear and plain that it needs no illustration I shall in this Discourse no further meddle with than to observe in my way how far it may affect those Tythes also which the  Impropriators  claim Wherefore having premised what is said before concerning Tythes in general to what Hand or for what Use soever paid let us now inquire into those Tythes which are called  Impropriate  Of Impropriate  TYTHES  THAT these Tythes which are claimed by the  Impropriators  are of the same Nature and stand originally on the same Root and Ground on which the other Tythes stand which are claimed and exacted by the  Priests  is evident from hence that they were all heretofore these as well as those claimed by and paid to some or other of the  Romish Clergy  or their Appendices the Religious Orders so called and upon the same Foot That is These  Impropriate Tythes  were paid to those Religious Orders or Houses as being due to God by vertue of the  Levitic Law  as well as the other Tythes were paid to the  ParishPriests  on the same supposed Right from the same Law But how these Tythes came to those Religious Houses first and how afterwards from them to the  Impropriators  is next to be inquired  Until the  Lateran Council  so named because it was holden in the  Pope's  Palace at  Rome  called the  Lateran  in the Year It was in the choice of every Man to give his Tythes to what Church he pleased so he gave them to some Church And even after that Council the  Popes  as Heads of that Church by their dispencing Power did give leave to such as would sue and pay for it to give their Tythes from the  ParishPriest  to such Order of Religious People whether  Monks Friers  or  Nuns  as they were best affected to By which means the  ParishPriests  called  Seculars    and those of the several Religious Orders called by a general Title  Regulars  being left to scramble as they could for maintenance the  Regulars    mendicant Fryers  and others swarming in all Places and pretending at least to greater Sanctity and Austerity of Life than the  ParishPriests  prevailed with the People either living or dying to give not only very considerable Estates in Lands but also the Tythes of other Lands and of whole Parishes from the  ParishPriests  to their Religious Houses or Convents  The Tythes or Parsonages so given were then called  Appropriations  because they were appropriated to this that or the other Religious House or Convent And I have read that there were in  England  about Parsonages thus appropriated And as Tythes were then held to be  due to God and holy Church  and those Religious Orders were reputed a part of that Church So the Tythes as well as the Lands thus given them were continued to them and possessed by them till that general Storm arose in K  Henry  his time which overturned those Religious Houses and Orders together And here by the way it may be noted That while those Religious Houses stood a great part of the Lands which had been given to them were by Papal Authority exempted from paying Tythes Whence it is that many of those Estates which had belonged to those Religious Houses remain discharged from the Burden of Tythes still  As Tythes were set up here on the Authority of the  Levitic Law  and in imitation of the  Jewish Practice  consonant to that Law So while those Religious Houses stood and the  Pope  's Power prevailed here not only the  Seculars  or  ParishPriests  but all those  Regulars  who received Tythes were bound to pay the  Tenths  out of the Tythes they received to the Head of their Church the  Pope  as the  Levites  under the Ceremonial Law were required to do to the Priests  But after that K  Hen  upon a Quarrel between  the  Pope  and him about his Divorce from his first Queen  Catharine  which he earnestly desired and the  Pope  would not grant fell off from the  Pope  though not from  Popery  For after that he retained the most pernicious Doctrines of the  Romish Church  contained in the six Articles and burnt some for denying them he threw off the  Pope  's Supremacy here and assumed it to himself declaring himself and being declared first by the  Clergy  in their  Convocation  and soon after by  Lords  and  Commons  in  Parliament The only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of England  This was done by the Statute of  Hen  c And therein it is enacted  'That the King his Heirs and Successors Kings of this Realm shall be taken accepted and reputed the only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of  England  And shall have and enjoy annexed and united to the Imperial Crown of this Realm as well the Title and Stile thereof as all Honours Dignities Praeeminences Jurisdictions Privileges Authorities Immunities Profits and Commodities to the said Dignity of Supream Head of the same Church belonging and appertaining And shall have full Power and Authority from time to time to Visit Repress Redress Reform Order Correct Restrain and Amend all such Errors Heresies Abuses Offences Contempts and Enormities whatsoever they be which by any manner of Spiritual Authority and Jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed repressed ordered redressed corrected restrained or amended  c  By which it is evident the Intention of the  Parliament  then was to transfer confer and settle unto and upon King  Henry  all the Powers Profits and Privileges which had been before supposed to be in or belong to or had been enjoyed or exercised by the  Pope  while he was received as  Supream Head of the Church  And therefore as the  Pope  while he retained the  Supremacy  here had the first Fruits which are the Profits of every Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Living for one Year upon the advancing of any Ecclesiastical Person to such a Living and also the  Tenths  that is the  tenth Part  of all the Tythes So these two Revenues as appendant to that  Supremacy  followed it being settled on the King in the same Session of Parliament wherein the Supremacy was vested in him The Words of the Statute  H  c relating to the  first Fruits  are these  'That for the more surety of Continuance and Augmentation of his High+ness Royal Estate being not only now recognized as he always indeed hath heretofore been the only Supream Head in Earth next and immediatly under God of the Church of  England  but also their most assured and undoubted natural Soveraign Liege Lord and King  c  It may therefore be enacted and ordained by  c  That the King's Highness his Heirs and Successors Kings of this Realm shall have and enjoy from time to time to endure for ever of every such Person and Persons which at any time after the first Day of  January  next shall be nominated elected perfected presented collated or by any other means appointed to have any ArchBishoprick Abbacy Monastery Priory Colledge Hospital Archdeaconry Deanry Provostship Prebend Parsonage Vicarage Chauntry FreeChappel or other Dignity Benefice Office or Promotion Spiritual within this Realm or elswhere within any of the King's Dominions of what Name Nature or Quality soever they be or to whose Foundation Patronage or Gift soever they belong the FirstFruits Revenues and Profits for one Year of every such ArchBishoprick Bishoprick Abby Monastery Priory Parsonage Vicarage  c  Then after Provisions made for finding out the value of those Spiritual Livings and for paying receiving and recovering those  FirstFruits    the Settlement of the  Tenths  that other part of the  Pope  's Revenue upon the King follows in the same Statute in these Words  'And over this be it enacted by Authority aforesaid that the Kings Majesty his Heirs and Successors Kings of this Realm for more Augmentation and Maintenance of the Royal Estate of his Imperial Crown and Dignity of Supream Head of the Church of  England  shall yearly have take enjoy and receive united and knit to his Imperial Crown for ever one yearly Rent or Pension amounting to the value of the Tenth Part of all the Revenues Rents Farms Tythes Offerings Emoluments and of all other Profits as well called Spiritual as Temporal now appertaining or belonging or that hereafter shall belong to any Archbishoprick Bishoprick Abbacy Monastery Priory Archdeaconry Deanry Hospital Colledge HouseCollegiate Prebend Cathedral Church CollegiateChurch ConventualChurch Parsonage Vicarage Chauntry FreeChappel or other Benefice or Promotion Spiritual of what Name Nature or Quality soever they be within any Diocess of this Realm or in Wales  c  And so goes on to direct the time place and manner of Payment of these Tenths with the Penalty for nonpayment  Thus were these two great Pillars of  Papal Supremacy First Fruits  and  Tenths  transferr'd from the  Pope  the old Head to the King the new Head of the Church to support and maintain that Headship in him as they had done before in the  Pope  Which Ecclesiastical Headship the King was no sooner possessed of than he began to exercise it amongst those Religious Orders Suppressing as  Herbert  in his Life p relates the  Observant Fryers  at  Greenwich Canterbury Richmond  and other Places and substituting the  Augustines  in their  Places  'Which he did says  Herbert  there for the finding out how his People would take his Design of putting down Religious Houses  To which he proceeded the next Year beginning with the lesser Sort and suppressing all those Monasteries Priories and other Religious Houses of  Monks Canons  and  Nuns  which had not in Lands Tenements Rents Tythes Portions and other Hereditaments above the clear yearly Value of two hundred Pounds By which means of those Religious Houses being dissolved a Revenue of above thirty thousand Pounds a Year beside an hundred thousand Pounds in Money raised by sale at low Rates of the Goods and Chattels of those Houses a Sum not small in that Age came to the King for support of his Ecclesiastical Supremacy  The Statute which countenanced this Proceeding is the of  Hen  cap And a new Court called  the Court of Augmentations  was then erected and settled by Parliament for receiving and ordering these new accessional Revenues the Act for which in our printed Statute Books is set before that for the Suppression of those lesser Monasteries But though that for Suppressing those Monasteries be by an  Hysterosis  set after that for establishing the  Court of Augmentations  Yet it must have been made before it For it is recited in it  In that Statute  Hen  for suppressing those smaller Monasteries mention is made of Monasteries Abbies and Priores which within one Year before the making of that Statute had been given and granted to the King by any Abbot Prior Abbess or Prioress under their ConventSeal or that otherwise had been suppressed or dissolved All which were by that Statute confirmed to the King and to all those unto whom the King either then before had conveyed or then after should convey any Part or Parts thereof 'To hold to them in like Manner  Form and Conditions as the Abbots Priors Abbesses Prioresses and other chief Governors of any religious Houses which had the same might or ought to have had if they had not been suppressed For upon the King's falling as was noted before upon the Observant  Fryers  at  Greenwich  and other places some of the more considerate of the  Abbots Priors  c Seeing the Storm arising which then threatned and soon after brought Destruction on those Orders thought it better Policy to comply with the times and surrender upon Terms in hopes to save something than hold out to the last as many did and lose all  And indeed the suppressing of those lesser Monasteries struck so great a Fear into the greater that the Statute made four Years after  Hen  cap whereby the Rest of the Religious Houses were given to the King recites  'That divers and sundry Abbots  c  of their own free and voluntary Mind since the fourth of  Feb  in the of his Reign had by due Order of Law and by their sufficient Writings of Record under their Convent and common Seals severally given granted and confirmed to the King his Heirs and Successors for ever All their said Monasteries Abbeys Priories  c  and all the Mannors Lordships Lands Tenements  Tythes  c to them belonging and had voluntarily renounced left and forsaken the same  And therefore in the said Statute it is enacted  'That the King shall have hold  c  All such late Monasteries  c  and all the Sites Circuits Manners Lands Tenements  c  thereunto belonging  In the ennumeration of the Particulars whereof which are many  Tythes  Parsonages appropriate and Vicarages are expresly mentioned All which as likewise all other Religious Houses with the Revenues thereof which should there after be dissolved suppressed relinquished forfeited or given to the King and which by that Statute are settled on him he was to hold and enjoy  in as large and ample Manner and Form as the late Abbots  c  had held or of right ought to have held the same in Right of their said late Monasteries  c  From hence this Observation arises That since those Religious Orders did hold the  Tythes  which they possessed upon the supposed Right of their being due  to God and Holy Church  which they held themselves and were by others holden to be a part of and the King received those  Tythes  and  Parsonages  amongst the rest of the Revenues of the Religious Houses as well those that were resigned to him by the Governours of those Houses themselves as the rest which by Act of Parliament he took upon the same Right on which those Religious Orders had holden them He also must hold them upon that supposed Right of their being due  to God and Holy Church  which he then held himself and was holden by all both  Clergy  and  Laity  to be the only  Supream Head  of here in  England  And as upon that supposed Right of their being  due to God and Holy Church  on which the Religious Houses held them they passed them from those Houses to the King as  supream Head of the Church  So on the same supposed Right of their being  due to God and Holy Church  they passed from the King as  supream Head of the Church  to those whether  Spiritual  or  Lay  Persons unto whom the King granted them For they stuck not long in the King's Hand But he of his own meer Motion Liberality and Benignity as the Statute in the d Year of his Reign cap relates had by that time freely given and granted  c  unto divers and sundry of the Lords and Nobles as well  Spiritual  as  Temporal  and unto divers and many other Persons and Bodies politick  c  divers and many sundry Honours Castles Manors Lands Tenements and among the rest  Rectories  c  But great care was taken to retain and keep up the Character of  Spirituality  which had formerly been  stamped upon those  Rectories Parsonages  and other Revenues by  Tythes  into what Hands soever they were passed And therefore by the Statute of  Hen  cap in case of withholding or denying to pay the Tythes all Persons claiming them  Impropriators  as well as  Priests  are restrained from suing in the  Temporal Courts  and limitted to the  Ecclesiastical  or  Spiritual Courts  only for the Recovery of them  And that they might still have Dependence upon the  Supremacy  care was taken from the first by the Statute of  Hen  cap That none of these Estates which then had come or should come from any of those Religious Houses to the King should pass from him by Grant to any Person whatsoever without an express Reservation of a  Tenth  And in a subsequent Statute  Hen  cap complaint being made that altho' out of those Grants which the King had made to sundry Persons of Honours Castles Mannors Lands Tenements Rectories  c  which were under the Survey of the  Court of Augmentations  the  Tenths  had been reserved yet the Persons unto whom such Grants had been made though they had quietly enjoyed and taken the Issues and Profits of those Lands Rectories  c  had not paid the reserved  Tenths  to the King Provision was made in that Statute by several  Forfeitures  and  NominePoenae  's to enforce the Payment thereof  Nor was Care taken of the  Ecclesiastical Head  the  King  only but of the  Ecclesiastical Members  the  Clergy  also Many if not most of which had Pensions or Portions issuing out of those Parsonages Rectories or other spiritual Benefices as they were counted which the Religious Orders held for besides that upon the increasing of those  Appropriations  whereby the  Parish Priests  were pinch'd there had been Provision made early in the time of K  Richard  the  Second  for the  Vicars  as well as for the  Poor  the Statute of  Ric  directing  'That upon the  Appropriation  of such Churches the  Diocaesian  of the Place or Bishop of the Diocess shall ordain according to the Value of such Churches a convenient Sum of Money to be paid and distributed Yearly of the Fruits and Profits of the same Churches to the poor Parishioners and also that the Vicar be well and sufficiently endowed  Which Statute so far at least as concerned the Vicars was afterwards confirmed by another Statute of  Hen  cap which expresly ordains  'That the Statute of Appropriation of Churches and of the Endowment of Vicars in the same made the th Year of K  Ric  the  d  be firmly holden and put in due Execution  I say besides these the Stat of and of  Hen  cap takes notice  'That the ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons and other Ecclesiastical Persons of both Provinces of  Canterbury  and  York  having formerly in right of their Churches received out of the late Monasteries  c  divers Pensions and other Profits had after the Dissolution of those Houses been disturbed and denyed of the having receiving and gathering of the said Pensions  c  Whereupon it is in the said Statute enacted  'That if any Person or Persons being Farmer or Occupier of any Manners Lands Tenements Parsonages Benefices or other Hereditaments of any of the said late Monasteries  c  by the King's Gift Grant Sale Exchange or otherwise out of which any such Pensions  c  have been heretofore lawfully going answered or Paid to any of the ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons and other Ecclesiastical Persons abovesaid do at any time after the first Day of  April  next coming wilfully deny the Payment thereof Then it shall be lawful for the said ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons or other Ecclesiastical Persons aforesaid being so denied to be satisfied and paid thereof  c  to proceed in the Ecclesiastical Courts for the recovery thereof  By which Statute all Pensions payable to ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons or other Ecclesiastical Person that had been possessed thereof at or within Ten Years next before the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries out of the Parsonages Rectories or Tythes holden by the said Monasteries  c  are confirmed and assured to such ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons and other Ecclesiastical Persons still  So that upon the whole besides what hath been said of Tythes in general with respect to the  Judaizing  and denying of Christ by the paying thereof which extends a like to all  Tythes  those claimed by the  Impropriator  as well as those claimed by the  Priest  the  Impropriate Tythes  being generally charged either with some Payment to the  Vicars  for enlarging of their  Stipends  or with  Pensions  to the ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons and other Ecclesiasticks all such of them as are so charged come under the same Objection that is made against paying to the Priest  viz  The upholding of a false Ministry to perform a false Worship And if any  Impropriation  may be supposed to be free from all those Charges yet all  Impropriators  as well as  Priests  being bound to pay the reserved  Tenths  to the King as  Supream Head of the Church  which were wont before to be paid to the  Pope  while he was owned for  Head of the Church  the paying of Tythes to an  Impropriator  is a  Recognizing  and  acknowledging  of a Man Bad or Good  Popish  or  Protestant  as it happens to be the only  Supream Head on Earth of the Church  Which is to set an  Human Head  to a  Spiritual Body  and to divest and deprive our Lord  Jesus Christ  of his undoubted Right who the Apostle says expresly is  the Head of the Body the Church  Col  And that not of Man's making or appointing but God  saith the Apostle  hath given him to be the Head over all things to the Church which is his Body  Ephes  T E  FINIS
