 THE HISTORY OF HINDOSTAN  THE HISTORY OF HINDOSTAN FROM THE DEATH OF AKBAR TO THE COMPLETE SETTLEMENT OF THE EMPIRE UNDER AURUNGZEBE TO WHICH ARE PREFIXED  I A DISSERTATION on the Origin and Nature of DESPOTISM in HINDOSTAN  II An ENQUIRY into the STATE of BENGAL With a Plan for restoring that Kingdom to its former Prosperity and Splendor  By ALEXANDER DOW  Esq  LIEUTENANTCOLONEL IN THE COMPANY's SERVICE  LONDON PRINTED FOR T BECKET AND P A DE HONDT IN THE STRAND BOOKSELLERS TO THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES THE PRINCE OF WALES AND BISHOP OF OSNABRUGH MDCCLXXII  TO THE KING THIS VOLUME IS MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED BY HIS MAJESTY's MOST DUTIFUL MOST HUMBLE AND MOST DEVOTED SUBJECT AND SERVANT  ALEXANDER DOW  A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF DESPOTISM IN HINDOSTAN  The climate and soil of India  GOVERNMENT derives its form from accident its spirit and genius from the inherent manners of the people The languor occasioned by the hot climate of India inclines the native to indolence and ease and he thinks the evils of despotism less severe than the labour of being free Tranquillity is the chief object of his desires His happiness consists in a mere absence of misery and oppression must degenerate into a folly which defeats its own ends before he calls it by the name of injustice These phlegmatic sentiments the Indian  carries into his future state He thinks it a mode of being in which passion is lost and every faculty of the soul suspended except the consciousness of existence  favourable to despotism  Other motives of passive obedience join issue with the love of ease The sun which enervates his body produces for him in a manner spontaneously the various fruits of the earth He finds subsistence without much toil he requires little covering but the shade The chill blast of winter is unknown the seasons are only marked by an arbitrary number of nights and days Property being in some measure unnecessary becomes of little value and men submit without resistance to violations of right which may hurt but cannot destroy them Their religious institutions incline them to peace and submission The vulgar live with the austerity of philosophers as well as with the abstinence of devotees Averse themselves to the commission of crimes they resent no injuries from others and their low diet cools their temper to a degree which passion cannot inflame  Encourage conquest  The fertility of the soil which in other kingdoms constitutes the great prosperity of the natives was a source of misfortune to the Indians Notwithstanding their abstinence and indolence they were in some degree industrious and in want of but few things themselves  their own arts and the natural productions of their country rendered them opulent Wealth accumulated in the progress of time upon their hands and they became objects of depredation to the fierce nations of the northern Asia The facility of incursion among a peaceable and harmless race of men encouraged conquest The victors instead of carrying the spoil into their native country sat down where it had been found and added the ministration of the conquered to the other enjoyments of wealth  Asia always the seat of slavery  Asia the seat of the greatest empires has been always the nurse of the most abject slaves The mountains of Persia have not been able to stop the progress of the tide of despotism neither has it been frozen in its course through the plains of the northern Tartary by the chill air of the North But though despotism governs Asia it appears in different countries under various forms The Arabs of the desart alone possess liberty on account of the sterility of their soil Independent of revolution and change they see with unconcern empires falling and rising around They remain unconquered by arms by luxury by corruption they alter not their language they adhere to their customs and manners they retain their dress Their whole property consists of flocks and herds of their  tents and arms They annually make a small and voluntary present to the chief of their blood They revolt against oppression and they are free by necessity which they mistake for choice When men are obliged to wander for subsistance despotism knows not where to find its slaves  Nature of the Tartar  The Tartar though a wanderer like the Arab was never equally free A violent aristocracy always prevailed in the country of the former except in a few short periods when the fortune of one established a transient despotism over the whole There man is armed against man chief against chief and tribe against tribe War is no longer a particular profession but the constant occupation of all Men are more afraid of men in the solitudes of Tartary than of beasts of prey The traveller moves with great circumspection and hears an enemy in every blast of wind When he sees a tract in the sand he crosses it and begins to draw his sword Though the barrenness of the country has prevented the growth or introduction of luxury avarice prevails and he that has the least to lose is the most independent where life is invariably risqued for a trifling spoil Robbery acquires the more honourable name of Conquest and the assassin is dignified with the title of Warrior  and Afgan aristoeracies  In the mountains which separate Persia from India the nature and face of the country have formed a different species of society Every valley contains a community subject to a prince whose despotism is tempered by an idea established among his people that he is the chief of their blood as well as their sovereign They obey him without reluctance as they derive credit to their family from his greatness They attend him in his wars with the attachment which children have for a parent and his government though severe partakes more of the rigid discipline of a general than of the caprice of a despot Rude as the face of their country and fierce and wild as the storms which cover their mountains they love incursion and depredation and delight in plunder and in battle United firmly to their friends in war to their enemies faithless and cruel They place justice in force and conceal treachery under the name of address Such are the Afgans or Patans who conquered India and held it for ages  Despotism of the Patans different  The despotism which the Patans established in their conquests partook of the violence of their national character at home Their government was oppressive through pride and tyrannical from passion rather than from avarice Reinforced by successive migrations from the mountains of Afganistân they retained their native  spirit in the midst of the luxuries of India When the monarch became voluptuous and degenerate they supplied his place with some hardy chieftain from the north who communicated his own vigour to the great machine of the state The empire was supported by a succession of abilities rather than by an hereditary succession of princes and it was the countrymen and not the posterity of the first conquerors who continued the dominion of the Patâns over India  from that of the Moguls  The conquest of India by the family of Timur proceeded from the abilities of one man and not from the effort of a nation Baber himself was a stranger in the country in which he reigned before he penetrated beyond the Indus His troops consisted of soldiers of fortune from various countries his officers were men who owed their rank to merit not to succession The religion of Mahommed which they in common professed and their obedience to one leader were the only ties which united the conquerors upon their arrival and they were soon dissipated in the extensive dominions which their arms subdued The character of the prince went down on the current of government and the mild disposition of his successors contributed to confirm the humane despotism which he had introduced into his conquests  Cause of that difference  A continued influx of strangers from the northern Asia became necessary for the support of princes who professed a different faith with their subjects in the vast empire of India The army was recruited with soldiers from different nations the court was occupied by nobles from various kingdoms The latter were followers of the Mahommedan religion In the regulations and spirit of the Coran they lost their primary and characteristical ideas upon government and the whole system was formed and enlivened by the limited principles which Mahommed promulgated in the desarts of Arabia  from their religion  The faith of Mahommed is peculiarly calculated for despotism and it is one of the greatest causes which must fix for ever the duration of that species of government in the East The legislator furnishes a proof of this position in his own conduct He derived his success from the sword more than from his eloquence and address The tyranny which he established was of the most extensive kind He enslaved the mind as well as the body The abrupt argument of the sword brought conviction when persuasion and delusion failed He effected a revolution and change in the human mind as well as in states and empires and the ambitious will continue to supp  a system which lays its soundation  on the passive obedience of those whom Fortune has once placed beneath their power  Despotism  The unlimited power which Mahommedanism gives to every man in his own family habituates mankind to slavery Every child is taught from his infancy to look upon his father as the absolute disposer of life and death The number of wives and concubines which the more wealthy and powerful entertain is a cause of animosity and quarrel which nothing but a severe and unaccountable power in the master of a family can repress This private species of despotism is in miniature the counterpart of what prevails in the state and it has the same effect in reducing all the passions under the dominion of fear Jealousy itself that most violent of the feelings of the soul is curbed within the walls of the haram The women may pine in secret but they must clothe their features with cheerfulness when their lord appears Contumacy is productive of immediate punishment They are degraded divorced chastised and even sometimes put to death according to the degree of their crime or obstinacy or the wrath of the offended husband No enquiry is made concerning their fate Their friends may murmur but the laws provide no redress for no appeals to public justice issue forth from the haram  of the masters of families  Young men with their minds moulded to subjection become themselves masters of families in the course of time Their power being confined within their own walls they exercise in private that despotism which they in public dread But though they are freed from domestic tyranny they still continue slaves Governors magistrates and inferior officers invested with the power of the principal despot whose will is law to the empire exercise their authority with rigour The idea of passive obedience is carried through every vein of the state The machine connected in all its parts by arbitrary sway is moved by the active spirit of the prince and the lenity or oppressiveness of government in all its departments depends upon the natural disposition of his mind  Law of compensation for murder  The law of compensation for murder authorised by the Coran is attended with pernicious effects It depresses the spirit of the poor and encourages the rich in the unmanly passion of revenge The price of blood in India is not the third part of the value of a horse The innate principles of justice and humanity are weakened by these means security is taken from society as rage may frequently get the better of the love of money A religion which indulges individuals in a crime at which the rest of mankind shudder leaves ample room for the  cruelty of a prince Accustomed to sit in judgment on criminals he becomes habituated to death He mistakes passion for justice His nod is condemnation men are dragged to execution with an abruptness which prevents fear The incident has no consequence but to impress terror on the guilty or suspected and the spectators scarcely heed a circumstance which its frequency has made them to expect  Bathing  The frequent bathing inculcated by the Coran has by debilitating the body a great effect on the mind Habit makes the warm bath a luxury of a bewitching kind The women spend whole days in water and hasten by it the approach of age The indolence of the men which induces them to follow every mode of placid pleasure recommends to them a practice which Mahommed has made a tenet of religion The prohibition of wine is also favourable to despotism It prevents that free communication of sentiment which awakens mankind from a torpid indifference to their natural rights They become cold timid cautious reserved and interested strangers to those warm passions and that cheerful elevation of mind which render men in some measure honest and sincere In the East there are no public places of meeting no communications of sentiments no introduction to private friendship A fullenness and  a love of retirement prevail which disunite mankind and as all associations among men are prevented the hands of government are strengthened by the very virtue of temperance  Predestination  The doctrine of a rigid fate or absolute predestination which forms one of the principal tenets of the Mahommedan religion has a great influence on the character and manners of men When this opinion is adopted as an article of faith the necessity of precaution is inculcated in vain The fatalist begins an action because human nature is incapable of absolute idleness but when a love of repose invites him when an obstacle arises before him to thwart his designs he has  o motive for perseverance He waits for another day perhaps for another month he at last trusts the whole to Providence and makes God the agent in his very crimes Miscarriage can be no disgrace where success depends not on abilities and the general who loses a battle through his own pusillanimity lays the blame upon Providence  Polygamy  The extensive polygamy permitted by the law of Mahommed has a fatal effect on the minds of his followers but it has its advantages as well as its defects The peculiar nature of the climate subjects women to diseases  and hurries them forward in a few years to age One man retains his vigour beyond the common succession of three women through their prime and the law for a multiplicity of wives is necessary for the support of the human race But the custom weakens paternal affection for as a husband cannot equally divide his regard among many women the children of the favourite will be preferred Even these will not be much beloved The loss of a child is no misfortune and the care of preserving it is lessened by the opportunity which the number of his women furnishes to the father for begetting more The child himself is no stranger to this indifference and he fails in proportion in his duty Besides the jealousy between mothers in the haram grows into hatred among their sons The affection between brothers is annihilated at home and when they issue forth into the world they carry their animosities into all the various transactions of life  Concealment of women  These religious tenets which are so favourable to despotism are accompanied with singular opinions and customs which are absolute enemies to freedom and independence The concealment of their women is sacred among the Mahommedans Brothers cannot visit them in private strangers must never see them This excessive jealousy is derived from various causes It  proceeds from religion which inculcates female modesty it arises partly from the policy of government it is derived from the nature of the climate where continence is a more arduous virtue than in the bleak regions of the north Honour consists in that which men are most solicitous to secure The chastity of his wives is a point without which the Asiatic must not live The despot encourages the opinion as the possession of the women of his most powerful subjects is a sufficient pledge for their faith when absent in expedition and war  Its effect  When the governor of a province falls under the suspicion of disaffection for his prince the first step taken against him is an order issued for sending his women to court Even one of his wives and she too not the best beloved will bind him to his allegiance His obedience to this mandate is the true test of his designs If he instantly obeys all suspicions vanish if he hesitates a moment he is declared a rebel His affection for the woman is not the pledge of his fidelity but his honour is in her person in the custody of his sovereign Women are so sacred in India that even the common soldiery leave them unmolested in the midst of slaughter and devastation The haram is a sanctuary against all the licentiousness of victory and ruffians  covered with the blood of a husband shrink back with confusion from the secret apartments of his wives  on their manners  In the silence which attends despotism every thing is dark and solemn Justice itself is executed with privacy and sometimes a solitary gun fired at midnight from the palace of the despot proclaims the work of death Men indulge themselves under the veil of secrecy and rejoice in their good fortune when their pleasures can escape the eye of their prince Voluptuousness is therefore preferred to luxury The enjoyment of the company of women is the chief object of life among the great and when they retire into the sanctuary of the haram they forget in a variety of charms their precarious situation in the state The necessary privacy enhances the indulgence and the extreme sensibility perhaps peculiar to the natives of a hot climate carries pleasure to an excess which unmans the mind Men are possessed of something which they are afraid to lose and despotism which is founded on the principles of fear and indolence derives stability and permanency from the defects and vices of its slaves  Reflections  The seeds of despotism which the nature of the climate and fertility of the soil had sown in India were  as has been observed reared to perfect growth by the Mahommedan faith When a people have been long subjected to arbitrary power their return to liberty is arduous and almost impossible Slavery by the strength of custom is blended with human nature and that undefined something called Public Virtue exists no more The subject never thinks of reformation and the prince who only has it in his power will introduce no innovations to abridge his own authority Were even the despot possessed of the enthusiasm of public spirit the people would revolt against the introduction of freedom and revert to that form of government which takes the trouble of regulation from their hands  on the nature  The simplicity of despotism recommends it to an indolent and ignorant race of men Its obvious impartiality its prompt justice its immediate severity against crimes dazzle the eyes of the superficial and raise in their minds a veneration little short of idolatry for their prince When he is active and determined in his measures the great machine moves with a velocity which throws vigour into the very extremities of the empire His violence and even his caprices are virtues where the waters must be always agitated to preserve their freshness and indolence and irresolution can be his  only ruinous vices The first indeed may injure the state but by the latter it must be undone A severe prince by his jealousy of his own authority prevents the tyranny of others and though fierce and arbitrary in himself the subject derives a benefit from his being the sole despot His rage falls heavy on the dignified slaves of his presence but the people escape his fury in their distance from his hand  of despotism  The despotic form of government is not however so terrible in its nature as men born in free countries are apt to imagine Though no civil regulation can bind the prince there is one great law the ideas of mankind with regard to right and wrong by which he is bound When he becomes an assassin he teaches others to use the dagger against himself and wanton acts of injustice often repeated destroy by degrees that opinion which is the sole soundation of his power In the indifference of his subjects for his person and government he becomes liable to the conspiracies of courtiers and the ambitious schemes of his relations He may have many slaves but he can have no friends His person is exposed to injury A certainty of impunity may arm even cowards against him and thus by his excessive ardour for power he with his authority loses his life  Mild under Baber  Despotism appears in its most engaging form under the Imperial house of Timur The uncommon abilities of most of the princes with the mild and humane character of all rendered Hindostan the most flourishing empire in the world during two complete centuries The manly and generous temper of Baber permitted not oppression to attend the victories of his sword He came with an intention to govern the nations whom he subdued and selfish motives joined issue with humanity in not only sparing but protecting the vanquished His invasion was no abrupt incursion for plunder and he thought the usual income of the crown a sufficient reward for his toil His nobles were gratified with the emoluments of government and from disposition an enemy to useless pomp and grandeur he chose that his treasury should be gradually filled with the surplus of the revenue than with the property of individuals whom the fortune of war had placed beneath his power Awed by his high character the companions of his victories carried his mildness and strict equity through all the departments of government The tyranny of the family of Lodi was forgotten and the arts which had been suppressed by a violent despotism began to rear their heads under the temperate dominion of Baber  Humaioon  Humaioon though not equal in abilities to his father carried all his mild virtues into the throne He was vigilant and activein the administration of justice he secured property by his edicts and an enemy to rapacity himself he punished the oppressive avarice of his deputies in the provinces The troubles which disturbed his reign were the effect of the ambition of others and his expulsion from the throne was less a misfortune to him than to his subjects When he returned with victory he left the mean passion of revenge behind He punished not his people for his own disasters he seemed to forget the past in the prospect of doing future good The nations of India felt by the benefit received from his presence how much they had lost by his absence Though worn out under a succession of tyrants during his exile Hindostan began to revive when he remounted the throne His sudden and unexpected death portended a storm which was dissipated by the splendid abilities and virtues of his son  Akbar  Akbar was possessed of Baber's intrepidity in war of Humaioon's mildness in peace Bold manly and enterprizing he was an enemy to oppression and he hated cruelty as he was a stranger to fear In the more splendid business of the field he forgot not the arts of peace  He established by edict the right of the subject to transfer his property without the consent of the crown and by ordering a register of the fixed rents of the lands to be kept in the courts of justice in every district he took from his officers the power of oppressing the people Severe in his justice he never forgave extortion He promoted just complaints against the servants of the crown by various proclamations He encouraged trade by an exemption of duties through the interior provinces and by the invariable protection given to merchants of all nations He regarded neither the religious opinions nor the countries of men all who entered his dominions were his subjects and they had a right to his justice He issued an edict which was afterwards revived by Aurungzêbe that the rents should not be increased upon those who improved their lands which wise regulation encouraged industry and became a source of wealth to the state  Jehangire  Jehangire though unfit for the field trod in his father's path in regulating the civil affairs of the state Impressed with a high sense of the abilities of Akbar he continued all his edicts in force and he was the invariable protector of the people against the rapacity and tyranny of his own officers In his administration of justice he was scrupulous severe and exact and if he  at any time gave a wrong decision it proceeded from a weakness rather than from a vice of the mind  Shaw Jehân  His son Shaw Jehân was possessed of better parts and was more attentive than Jehangire to the business of the subject He was minutely acquainted with the state of the empire and being free from that caprice and whim which threw a kind of disgrace on the authority of his father he rendered his people happy by the gravity justice and solemnity of his decisions The empire flourished under his upright and able administration Oppression was unknown from the officers of the crown on account of the vigilance of the emperor and the strict impartiality which he established in the courts of justice diminished injuries between man and man  Aurungzêbe  Aurungzêbe to whom business was amusement added the most extensive knowledge of the affairs of the empire to an unremitting application He made himself minutely acquainted with the revenue paid by every district with the mode of proceeding in the inferior courts and even with the character and disposition of the several judges He ordered the register of the rents to be left open for the inspection of all that the people might distinguish extortion from the just demands of the crown He commanded that men versed in the usages  of the several courts in the precepts of the Coran and in the regulations established by edicts should attend at the public expence and give their opinion to the poor in matters of litigation He established a mode of appeal beyond certain sums and he disgraced judges for an error in judgment and punished them severely for corruption and partiality His activity kept the great machine of government in motion through all its members his penetrating eye followed oppression to its most secret retreats and his stern justice established tranquillity and secured property over all his extensive dominions  State of landed  When Baber at the head of his army took possession of the dominions of the Imperial family of Lodi he continued to the crown the property of all the lands These being annually rented out to the subject furnished those immense revenues which supported the unequalled splendor of his successors in the throne The property of individuals consisted at first of moveables and money only and the officers of the crown could not even dispose of these by will without the written consent of the prince Time however wrought a change in things The posterity of Baber alienated sor particular services estates from the crown in perpetuity and these descended in succession by will or if the proprietor  died intestate by an equal division to his children according to the law of the Coran This kind of property was also transferable by sale and it has been judged that one third part of the empire was given away by this species of grants from the crown  property  These grants however were not always a sufficient security against the violence of the crown Some of the emperors found themselves obliged to resume many estates by an edict and it must be confessed that political necessity justified the measure Princes who contended for the empire were lavish in their donations and had not an act of resumption sometimes taken place the revenue of the crown would in process of time have been annihilated There was however a kind of equivalent given to the proprietors a pension was settled upon themselves and their children were received into the service of the government The wealth of the officers of the crown is after their death considered as Imperial property but unless it is immense it is never appropriated by the prince and even in that case a proper provision is made for the children and they have by an established custom a right to be employed in some of the departments of the state The women of the dec  sed receive annual pensions according  to their rank and they may either live in widowhood or make new alliances by marriage  Of titles of honour  The Mogul system of government admits of no hereditary honours Every man must owe his preferment and rank to himself and to the favour of his prince High birth however was respected and to a person of abilities it was a great recommendation at the court of princes proud of their own noble origin The ranks and degrees of nobility were for the most part official excepting those of the military kind Judges men of letters and eminent merchants have been frequently dignified with titles and admitted into the circle of the principal nobles in the Imperial presence The nobles consisted of three orders The EMIRS who were the first officers of state and the viceroys of provinces the CHANS who held high posts in the army and the BAHADURS who may in some measure be compared to our knights The number of which these three orders consisted was arbitrary and each of them had peculiar privileges in the empire and a demand on the respect of the undignified part of the subjects  Form of  The course of justice ran through the same gradations which the general reason of mankind seems to have established in all countries subject to regular governments  The provinces were divided into districts in each of which a judge appointed by the emperor decided in criminal as well as civil affairs He pronounced judgment on capital offences but his sentence was never put in execution without the consent and warrant of the governor of the province In disputes concerning property there lay an appeal to the supreme court in which the viceroy presided in person Every province was in miniature a copy of the empire Three principal judges with high titles of dignity sat with many assessors in the capital They not only decided upon appeals but suits might originate before them The emperor himself in the presence of his nobles presided almost every day in this court which generally sat for two hours in the hall of public justice  justice  When the matter appeared clear the prince without much hesitation pronounced judgment when it was doubtful witnesses were examined and the opinion of the judges asked on the point of law Should the suit appear intricate it was referred to the judgment of the court in their own common hall but the subject might appeal from their decision to the emperor and his assessors in the chamber of audience These courts both when the monarch was present and when he was absent were lest open to the people No judgment was ever pronounced  secretly except when the power of the delinquent rendered a public trial dangerous to the state  Council of state  The great officers of state by a kind of prescription formed a council which answers to our cabinet The emperor asked their advice upon affairs of moment he heard their sentiments but nothing came ever to a vote They were his advisers but they had no controul on his power He frequently called to this council men in inferior departments and when the deliberation concerned any particular province the nobles best acquainted with that part of the empire were admitted into the cabinet The offences of the first rank of nobility came under the cognizance of this council as well as other matters of state They were a kind of jury who found the matters of fact and the sovereign pronounced the sentence He might by his despotic power issue out a warrant of death without their advice but the known opinions of mankind on that subject bound him like a law  Reflections  To these great lines of the government of the Moguls some reflections may be joined Conquests made by incursion rather than by war must be retained by violence The sword which obtained the empire supported it under the house of Timur Their subjects obeyed  them from necessity more than from choice and the lenity of their administration arose more from the mildness of their disposition than from the spirit of their regulations The despotic principles of the Tartars ingrafted upon the Mahommedan tenets of religion led to force and seemed to recognize no obedience but that which proceeded from fear This circumstance obliged the despot to invest his deputies in the provinces with a great part of his power and when they left his capital they only did not absolutely rise from subjects into princes  on the communication  This communication of power though in some measure necessary to command the people became dangerous to the prince The Imperial deputies began to lose their allegiance in proportion to their distance from the throne The governors became in some measure independent though they professed obedience to the Imperial edicts A certain portion of the revenue was remitted to court and the deputy in a venal court found frequently means to retain the favour of his prince when he disobeyed his commands Every idea of loyalty was towards the decline of the empire destroyed among the people of the distant provinces They heard of an emperor as the superstitious hear of a guardian angel whom they never behold An indifference for his fate succeeded to his want of power A peasant at the end of many months was informed of a revolution  at Delhi He stopt not his oxen nor converted the plowshare into a sword He whistled unconcerned along his field and enquired not perhaps concerning the name of the new prince  of power  Notwithstanding this indifference in the inferior sort the emperor every day extended symptoms of his superior power to the very extremities of his empire His edicts were transmitted to every district they were publicly read and registered in the courts of justice They became a security to the people against the impositions of the governor An appeal lay from his decisions by a petition to the emperor in the hall of audience This doctrine was inculcated by the edicts and some of the oppressed took advantage of the promise of justice which they contained Their petitions whenever they found access to the throne were heard with the attention which a jealous prince pays to his own power and there are many instances in which the governors of provinces have been severely punished for an act of injustice to a poor peasant Never to forgive oppressions against the helpless and low was an established maxim among all the princes of the house of Timur  On the rules of  The power of disposing of the succession naturally belongs to a despot During his life his pleasure is the  law When he dies his authority ceases but the strength of custom has made his will in favour of any of his sons a superior title to primogeniture The power is in some measure necessary A prince having an independent right of succession to the throne might be very troublesome to his father in an empire established on the principles which we have described The weight which he might derive from his hopes would clog the wheels of government which under a system of despotism can admit of no delays no obstructions no divided or limited power Personal abilities under such a system are more necessary than under established laws A weak prince brings more calamities than a civil war A minority is dreadful and it can scarce exist where the voice of the prince is the living law which moves the whole machine of the state  succession to the throne  Necessity frequently excuses in the eyes of mankind the worst of crimes A prince of abilities who mounts a throne in the East by the exclusion of an elder brother escapes the detestation of his subjects from the good which they hope to derive from his superior parts Even fratricide loses its name in selfpreservation combined with the public good The greatness of the crime is colipsed by the greatness of the object Success is a divine decision and the state gives up the lives of the unhappy  sufferers as a sacrifice to its own repose To be born a prince is therefore a misfortune of the worst and most embarrassing kind He must die by clemency or wade through the blood of his family to safety and empire  Mildness  The Hindoos or the followers of the Brahmin faith are in number far superior to the Mahommedans in Hindostan The system of religion which they profess is only perfectly known in the effect which it has upon the manners of the people Mild humane obedient and industrious they are of all nations on earth the most easily conquered and governed Their government like that of all the inhabitants of Asia is despotic it is in such a manner tempered by the virtuous principles inculcated by their religion that it seems milder than the most limited monarchy in Europe Some of the reigning princes trace their families with clearness above four thousand years many of them in a dubious manner from the dark period which we place beyond the flood Revolution and change are things unknown and assassinations and conspiracies never exist  of the  Penal laws are scarce known among the Hindoos for their motives to bad actions are sew Temperate in  their living and delicate in their constitutions their passions are calm and they have no object but that of living with comfort and ease Timid and submissive from the coldness of a vegetable diet they have a natural abhorrence to blood Industrious and frugal they possess wealth which they never use Those countries governed by native princes which lay beyond the devastations of the Mahommedans are rich and cultivated to the highest degree Their governors encourage industry and commerce and it is to the ingenuity of the Hindoos we owe all the fine manufactures in the East During the empire of the Moguls the trade of India was carried on by the followers of Brahma The bankers scribes and managers of finance were native Hindoos and the wisest princes of the family of Timur protected and encouraged such peaceable and useful subjects  Hindoo government  The nation of the Mahrattors though chiefly composed of Rajaputs or that tribe of Indians whose chief business is war retain the mildness of their countrymen in their domestic government When their armies carry destruction and death into the territories of Mahommedans all is quiet happy and regular at home No robbery is to be dreaded no imposition or obstruction from the officers of government no protection necessary but the shade To be a stranger is a sufficient security  Provisions are furnished by hospitality and when a peasant is asked for water he runs with great alacrity and fetches milk This is no ideal picture of happiness The Author of the Differtation who travelled lately into the country of the Mahrattors avers from experience the truth of his observations But the Mahrattors who have been represented as barbarians are a great and rising people subject to a regular government the principles of which are founded on virtue  AN ENQUIRY INTO THE STATE OF BENGAL WITH A Plan for restoring that Province to its former Prosperity and Splendor  STATE OF BENGAL UNDER THE MOGULS  Preliminary Observations  Reflections  THE affairs of India though long of great importance to this kingdom have only very lately become objects of public attention Facts coming from afar made little impression their novelty could not rouze nor their variety amuse the mind With a selfdenial uncommon in a spirited nation we heard without emotion of the great actions of some of our countrymen and if we listened to any detail of oppressions  committed by others it was with a phlegmatic indifference unworthy of our boasted humanity A general distaste for the subject prevailed an age marked with revolution and change seemed ready to pass away without being sensible of events which will render it important in the eyes of posterity  Design of the author  The current of public opinion has at length taken another direction Men are rouzed into attention with regard to a subject which concerns the welfare of the state They begin to decide in their own minds upon affairs which stand in need of the interposition of the nation and they shew an inclination to be informed as well as a willingness to correct mistakes and to redress grievances This consideration has induced the author of the following observations to submit them with all due deference to the public He has been for years a silent spectator of the transactions of the British nation in the East and it is from the means of information which he has possessed that he hopes to give something new to the world With hands guiltless of rapine and depredation he assumes the pen without prejudice and he will use it with all decent freedom without fear  A brief account  The empire of the Hindoos over all India came down from the darkest and most remote antiquity  to the th year before the Christian aera when it was dissolved by civil discord and war Bengal like many other provinces started up into an independent kingdom and was governed by successive dynasties of Rajas who chiefly resided at the now deserted capital of Ghor Under these princes it continued a powerful and opulent kingdom to the beginning of the thirteenth century when it was first invaded by the Mahommedans under a prince of the race of Chillagi who possessed the countries near the source of the Oxus The name of this Tartar invader was Easuldien but he was soon after reduced to subjection by Altumsh the Patan emperor of Delhi who formed Bengal into a province governed by a lieutenant who derived his authority from the conqueror  of the various revolutions  Bengal during the dominion of the Patans in India was frequently subject to revolution and change When a prince of abilities sat on the throne of Delhi it held of the empire when the emperor was weak it became an independent sovereignty under its governor When the valour and conduct of Baber put an end to the government of the Patans at Delhi some of that race remained untouched in Bengal The misfortunes of Humaioon in the beginning of his reign not only prevented him from extending the conquests of his sather but deprived him even of the throne which Baber  had acquired and death followed too soon upon his return to permit him to reduce the wealthy kingdom of Bengal by his arms The glory of this conquest was reserved for his son the illustrious Akbar who by the expulsion of Daoôd the last king of Bengal of the Patan race annexed it in the year to his empire Viceroys from Delhi governed the kingdom from that period till the debility of Mahommed Shaw gave scope to the usurpation of Aliverdi and now by a wonderful revolution of sortune the sovereigns of that distant province are created by the deputies of the East India company  of Bengal  To give an enlarged idea of the subject it may not be improper to enquire into the mode of government which the Moguls established in the important province of Bengal To impose nothing merely speculative upon the public the Writer of the Dissertation has endeavoured to derive his information from undoubted authority He has therefore translated and annexed to his work the commissions granted by the court of Delhi to its principal officers in the provinces From which it will appear that the despotism of the house of Timur was circumscribed by established forms and regulations which greatly tempered the rigid severity of that form of government  Various Tenures under the Moguls  Policy of the Moguls  THE Mogul Tartars when they conquered India carried a system of necessary policy through the countries which their arms had subdued Instead of seizing the lands of the vanquished they confirmed them in their possessions The number of the conquerors bearing no proportion to the conquered selfpreservation obliged the first to adhere together and to hold the sword in their hands Had they attempted to settle in different provinces they would have soon ceased to be a people and their power would have been broken by separation They retained therefore their military character and when they reduced a province they made the taxes paid to former princes the invariable rule of their imposts The people changed their lords but if their government suffered any change it was in the substitution of a milder despotism in the place of the fierce tyranny of the Patans  Tributary Rajas  Many of the Rajas or indigenous Indian princes had from the first establishment of the Mahommedans in India been permitted to retain a great part of their ancient possessions which they continued to govern by their own laws without any appeal from their jurisdiction  to the courts of justice established by Imperial commissions The only mark of homage paid by the Rajas was a certain annual tribute The house of Timur no less remarkable for their prudence than for their clemency and justice never encroached upon the privileges of the tributary princes They found that though the Rajas paid not to the crown above half the sum raised upon the subject their policy industry and good government were so much superior to those of the Moguls that the countries which they possessed yielded as much in proportion to their extent as those which they had farmed out to Zemindars of their own nation and faith In the two provinces which the British nation now possess and which for the future we will distinguish by the general name of Bengal many districts of greater extent than any county in Britain are still possessed by the aboriginal Rajas But we are more rigid than the Moguls we have encroached on their privileges and annihilated their power During the domination of the house of Timur one fourth of Bengal was subject to these hereditary lords  Mahommedan Zemindars  The division of the province which was more immediately under the Mahommedan government was parcelled out into extensive districts called Chucklas resembling in some measure our counties into lesser  divisions like our ancient tithings These were lett to Zemindars or farmers of the Imperial rents who sometimes possessed a whole district or Chuckla as the Zemindar of Purnea who assumed the style and state of a Nabob though only a farmer of the revenue under the unfortunate SurageulDowla The court of Delhi under the best princes was venal A sum of money secretly and properly applied osten secured the possession of his office to the Zemindar during life and he even was sometimes enabled to transmit it to his heirs till by length of time they were in some measure considered as lords of their respective districts  Their power  The farmers however had no lease from the crown of the lands over which they presided Their authority for collecting the rents from the inferior tenants was derived from a written agreement for a certain annual sum to be paid to the treasury exclusive of the Imperial taxes To prevent imposition on the poorer sort in every district there was established a register in which the rents and imposts upon every village and farm were entered and open to the inspection of all The registered rents and imposts were collected by the Crorie of the district who was established in his office by an Imperial commission He was accountable for the whole even to the last Dâm as the commission expresses it to the Fotadâr or treasurer of the district who  paid them into the hands of the Dewan or receivergeneral of the Imperial revenues in the province  restricted  The rights or dues of the Dewanny or the revenue paid to the crown did not amount to above half the sum raised upon the subject by the great farmers These were from time to time permitted to raise the rents upon the inferior tenants in proportion to the general improvement of the lands The surplus which was known to government from the public registers of the districts was in part allowed to the general sarmers for the purpose of building houses for the husbandmen for furnishing them with implements of agriculture for embanking to prevent inundations for making reservoirs of water for the dry season and in general for all expences attending the improvement and cultivation of the lands which otherwise would have rendered the accounts of government intricate and perplexed  by the crown  The great farmers however were not permitted to oppress the tenants with exorbitant rents neither was it their interest to extort from the husbandmen sums which would render them incapable of cultivating their lands and of living comfortably upon the fruits of their toil In the Imperial officers of the revenue the poor  had friends and the Zemindar spies upon his conduct They were such checks upon him that he could conceal nothing from their observation They transmitted monthly accounts of his transactions to court If the tenants were able without oppression to pay the additional rent the demands of the crown rose at the expiration of the year upon the farmer in proportion to the new impost if they were found incapable of bearing the burden the Zemindar was turned out of his office for his avarice and imprudence  A double revenue  A double revenue it appears from what has been already observed rose to the crown from the lands the ancient rent established at the conquest of India by the Moguls and the sums which proceeded from the annual contracts with the great farmers The viceroy of the province was vested with the power of letting the lands and he was obliged to transmit to the receivergeneral a record of the sums payable by each Zemindar The cause of this mode of raising the revenue is obvious The detail of accounts the making of contracts with the inferior tenants would have rendered the business of government too minute and too expensive and to have permitted the general farmers to manage their districts without either check or controul would have given birth to scenes of oppression  which Fate had reserved for an unfortunate people to our times The Mogul empire is now no more and the servants of the freest nation upon earth have left the body of the people to the mercy of the Zemindars  Various Zemindars  The general farmers of districts were not the only persons known by the name of Zemindars Men who possessed estates for life and sometimes in perpetuity free from all taxation by virtue of Imperial grants were distinguished by the same title These grants were generally given to learned and religious men to favourite servants at court to soldiers who had deserved well of their prince and they were respected by succeeding emperors and seldom revoked One sixth part of the lands in Bengal had been conferred in perpetuity by different princes on their favourites and adherents Many of these estates have fallen into the East India Company from a failure of heirs and others daily fall as the property is not transferable by sale A minute enquiry might greatly increase our revenue Many grants said to be derived from the emperor are only from the governors of the province many are in the possession of men who cannot trace their blood to the original proprietors A succession of revolutions has rolled one part of Bengal upon the other and it is not hitherto settled from confusion  Different  Lands were held by a tenure less permanent of the emperors of Hindostan A firmân or Imperial mandate called by the name of Jagieer was issued frequently to particular men This species of grant was for no term of years It was given through favour and revocable at pleasure When any person was raised to the rank of an Omrah it was an established rule to confer upon him an estate for the support of his dignity This however was nothing more than an assignment on the revenues of the crown arising from a specified tract of land in a district named in the body of the grant The grantee had no business with the tenants as he never resided on the estate allotted for his subsistence He sent his agent every season to the public officers of the district and his receipt to them for his allowance was received by the Dewan as a part of the Imperial revenue No conditions of service none for the maintenance of troops was annexed to this grant These are the fables of men who carried the feudal ideas of Europe into their relation of the state of India The armies of the empire were paid out of the public treasury Every province had its particulr establishment of troops which the governors were impowered to augment in times of rebellion and commotion  tenures  During the domination of the house of Timur there was no transferable landed property in Hindostan excepting gardens orchards houses and some small portions of ground in the environs of great cities for which merchants and wealthy tradesmen had obtained particular grants distinguished by the name of Pottas This species of property was repeatedly secured by general edicts for the encouragement of building for the accommodation of citizens and the improvement of towns Grants of this kind did not always proceed from the crown The governors of provinces were impowered to issue Pottas under certain limitations and restrictions the principal one of which was that the usual rent of the ground should be paid regularly by the proprietor to the collectors of the Imperial revenue  under the empire  Tenures of other various kinds were common in Bengal as well as in the other provinces of the empire An assignment was frequently granted upon a specified tract of land for the discharge of a certain sum and when the sum was paid the assignment expired Particular farms were burthened with pensions called Altumga to holy men and their descendants without their ever having any concern in the management of the lands The despot reserved the people entire to himself  and established his power by preventing oppression Certain imposts were also appropriated for the maintenance of Mullas or priests for the support of places of worship public schools inns highways and bridges These imposts were laid by the receivergeneral of the revenue upon the different husbandmen in proportion to the rent which they paid and the tax was distinguished by the name of the impositions of the Dewan  Civil Officers and Courts of Justice  Despotism limited  IN states subject to despotism the legislative the judicial and executive power are vested in the prince He is the active principle which exists in the center of the machine and gives life and motion to all its parts His authority and consequence however depend in a great measure on the degree in which he communicates his power to his officers If he gives them all his authority the reverence for his person is lost in the splendor of his deputies If he bestows only a small part of his power on his servants that terror which is the foundation of his government is removed from the minds of his subjects and a door is opened for commotion licentiousness and crimes The emperors of India of the house of Timur had for two centuries the good fortune to clothe their officers  with that happy medium of authority which was sufficient to govern without the power of oppressing the body of the people  among the Moguls  The despotism of Hindostan it ought to be observed was never a government of mere caprice and whim The Mahommedans carried into their conquests a code of laws which circumscribed the will of the prince The principles and precepts of the Coran with the commentaries upon that book form an ample body of laws which the house of Timur always observed and the practice of ages had rendered some ancient usages and edicts so sacred in the eyes of the people that no prudent monarch would chuse to violate either by a wanton act of power It was besides the policy of the prince to protect the people from the oppressiveness of his servants Rebellion sprung always from the great and it was necessary for him to secure a party against their ambition among the low  Nabob  The Imperial governor of a province known by the corrupted name of Nabob in the East as well as in Europe was an officer of high dignity and authority but his power though great was far from being unlimited and beyond controul He conferred titles below the rank of an Omrah he was permitted to  grant estates till they should be confirmed by the crown He appointed and dismissed at pleasure all officers both civil and military excepting a few whom we shall have occasion to mention who acted by commission under the seal of the empire and some of these upon misbehaviour he could suspend till the emperor's pleasure was known He let the lands to the general farmers in conjunction with the Dewan but he bore no part in the collection of the revenue but by aiding the Imperial officers with the military power The Omrahs who served under him in the army having generally on account of the convenience their allowance from the emperor on the rents of the province he had the power for disobedience or notorious crimes to suspend them from their Jagieers until he should receive an answer from court where the dispute was examined in the cabinet In matters of justice there rested an appeal to his tribunal from the Cazi or chiefjustice though he seldom chose to reverse the decrees of that judge Disputes where property was not concerned and where the established laws had made no provision were settled by his authority but he was instructed at his peril not to turn the subjects of the empire out of the lands tenements or houses which they themselves either possessed or built or which descended to them from their ancestors  Dewan  The Dewan was the officer next in dignity to the viceroy in the province He derived his commission from the emperor as receivergeneral of the revenue His office was altogether confined to the administration and collection of the Imperial rents and taxes He corresponded with the minister he audited the accounts of the governor and as he had entire to himself the charge and disposal of the public money he might for good reasons refuse to discharge any extraordinary and unprecedented expences or to issue out pay to new troops raised without apparent necessity He presided in the office called Daster Ali or over all the Mutasiddies or clerks of the cheque the Canongoes or public registers Crories or collectors of the larger districts Fusildars or collectors of the lesser districts Fotadars or treasurers Chowdries or chiefs of districts Muckuddums or headmen of villages and in general over all the officers of the Imperial revenue  Crorie  The Crorie of every Pergunna or larger district derived his commission from the emperor His office though in miniature was the exact counterpart of the Dewan being the receivergeneral of the county if the name may be used as the former was of the whole province He was immediately accountable to the  Dewan in whose office he passed his accounts He produced the receipts of the Fotadar or treasurer of the Pergunna or district for the sums which he had paid into that officer's hands from the collections made by the Fusildars who in the subdivisions of the Pergunna held offices each of which was a counterpart of his own  Carcûn  The Carcûn of the larger districts was an officer commissioned by the emperor to settle all matters and disputes between the tenants and the officers of the revenue and to preserve the ancient usages of the Pergunna He was also a kind of spy upon all their private as well as public transactions he audited their accounts publicly transmitting copies of them monthly to court attested by the Sheickdars Chowdries and Canongoes of the district These accounts being entered with great regularity in the visier's office at Delhi the emperor had an immediate view of the collections in the province before the general accounts of the Dewanny were adjusted and this was also a great check upon the office of the Dewan  and other officers  The view already presented of the mode of collecting the Imperial revenue renders it unnecessary to descend through all the inferior offices in the department of the  receivergeneral The revenues it must be observed were never transmitted entire to the Imperial treasury in the capital of the province much less into that of the empire The expences incurred in every district were deducted from the receipts of the Fotadar or treasurer of the district and the disbursements of the province in general from those of the Dewan The surplus alone which was more or less according to accident found its way to the Imperial exchequer The estimates of the Imperial revenues are therefore not the sums received in the exchequer at Delhi but the gross collections in every province  Chiefjustice  The courts of justice in Bengal distinguished by the general name of Cutcherries were of various kinds They generally received their designation from the officer who presided in each or within whose jurisdiction they were comprehended The Author of the Enquiry is not fully informed concerning the powers of the different judges or the mode of proceeding in their courts There arose a chain of appeal from the lowest to the highest An action might be removed from any of the courts below before the Cazi of the province commonly called Daroga Adalit or chiefjustice and from him there lay an appeal to the tribunal of the viceroy  Judges  Inferior judges were appointed by an Imperial commission in every large district and in every considerable city with whom appeals rested from the courts in the country and from the decisions of Cutwals or mayors of towns These Cazis or judges were vested with power to summon before them all persons to examine records public registers grants and witnesses They were at their peril to pass judgment impartially according to the laws of the Coran and the canons and regulations of the empire They were impowered to make and dissolve marriages to execute contracts of every kind between individuals to inflict punishments which did not extend to either life or limb They took cognizance of all riots disorders and tumults and they were denominated the general guardians of the morals of the people They were provided with an establishment of clerks registers and officers of the court They passed judgment in a summary manner and their legal fees were one fourth of the matter in dispute equally levied upon the plaintiff and defendant This regulation was intended to prevent vexatious lawsuits as well as to bring them to a speedy issue During the vigour of the Mogul empire capital punishments were hardly known in India When a crime which merited death was committed the Cazi after a full proof of the fact by witnesses  pronounced sentence against the guilty person but without the confirmation of the viceroy it could not be put in execution Though the empire sometimes abounded with treason it was never punished but in the field  Inferior officers  In each subdivision of the Pergunna or district subject to the jurisdiction of the Cazi or judge there was an inferior officer called a Chowdri similar to our justice of the peace Every village had its chiefman who was the constable of his own department A Fogedar was properly speaking the commander of the troops in every military station He sometimes farmed the lands in the neighbourhood and being the immediate representative of the viceroy he was considered as the principal officer in his district But he did not sit in judgment the civil being always kept distinct from the military department under the government of the Moguls as long as it retained its vigour The Zemindars or general farmers were sometimes entrusted with the command of the troops in their own districts but in their courts they decided only upon trivial disputes between the inferior husbandmenSuch was the government of Bengal under the empire of the house of Timur  Revenue and Commerce  Revenue of Bengal and Behâr  A Brief but it is hoped a comprehensive idea being given in the preceding section of the government of Bengal under the Imperial house of Timur the Author of the Enquiry will proceed to explain the Revenues and Commerce of that once flourishing and opulent kingdom In the reign of the emperor Jehangire the revenues of the provinces of Bengal and Behâr both which for the sake of brevity we comprehend under the name of the former amounted to  £  Under his grandson Aurungzêbe they encreased to    Mahommed Shuffia who wrote an abridgment of the History of the Empire from the death of the illustrious Akbâr to the fatal invasion of Nadir Shaw where he mentions the provinces which revolted during the indolent reign of Mahommed Shaw estimates the revenues of Bengal at sixty crores of Dâms or one crore and fifty lacks of roupees which sum is equal to  £  The revenues of Behâr according to the same writer amounted to fortyfive crores of Dâms or       £  Increase under the empire  It appears from the above calculation that the revenues of Bengal had been gradually increasing in the progress of the empire through time They continued still to increase under the revolted Nabobs some of whom brought into their treasury four millions of our money but not without distressing the subject and plundering him of a part of his wealth It may be necessary to repeat an observation already made that not above half the sum raised upon the people came into the coffers of government The exact sum transmitted annually to Delhi before the dissolution of the empire is not easy to ascertain but we can form some judgment of the amount from the ruinous policy of the Imperial court when its ancient vigour began to decline The provinces of Bengal and Behâr during some years of indolence and debility were farmed out to the viceroys who paid into the treasury one million two hundred and fortynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence of our money  Sum annually remitted to Delhi  This sum it is supposed was a medium struck upon an average of years of the money remitted to the treasury at Delhi when the empire retained its force But this stipulated revenue as might have been foreseen was never regularly paid The viceroys acquired an independent  power by a regulation which threw the whole management of the province into their hands without controul and the vigour of the Imperial government in proportion declined The country profited however by the refractoriness of its governor if his avarice prompted him to raise more on the subject the latter was more able than before to pay the additional impost from the revenue being kept and expended in the province Bengal began to flourish under an additional load of oppression It yielded more to a severe Nabob than to the milder government of the empire and being relieved from an annual drain of specie to Delhi it became opulent under a degree of rapine  Commerce of  Though despotism is not the most favourable government for commerce it flourished greatly in Bengal under the strict justice of the house of Timur Sensible of the advantages which they themselves would derive from a free commercial intercourse between their subjects they were invariably the protectors of merchants The military ideas which they brought from Tartary prevented the principal servants of the crown from engaging in trade and therefore monopolies of every kind were discouraged and almost unknown No government in Europe was ever more severe against forestalling and regrating  than was that of the Moguls in India with regard to all the branches of commerce A small duty was raised by the crown but this was amply repaid by the neverviolated security given to the merchant  Bengal  Bengal from the mildness of its climate the fertility of its soil and the natural industry of the Hindoos was always remarkable for its commerce The easy communication by water from place to place facilitated a mercantile intercourse among the inhabitants Every village has its canal every Pergunna its river and the whole kingdom the Ganges which falling by various mouths into the bay of Bengal lays open the ocean for the export of commodities and manufactures A people from an inviolable prejudice of religion abstemious were averse to luxury themselves and the wants of nature were supplied almost spontaneously by the soil and climate The balance of trade therefore was against all nations in favour of Bengal and it was the sink where gold and silver disappeared without the least prospect of return  Balance of trade in its favour  All the European nations carried chiefly on their commerce with Bengal in bullion The Dutch at a medium  of ten years threw annually into the bosom of that kingdom in bullion  £  The English    The French Danes and Portuguese    The exports of Bengal to the gulphs of Persia and Arabia were very great She supplied Arabia Persia Turkey Georgia Armenia and the lesser Asia with her manufactures and brought home annually into her coffers of gold    Her trade in opium and piece goods to the eastern kingdoms of Asia to the Malayan and Philippine islands brought yearly a balance in her favour of    The inland trade of Bengal with the upper Hindostan and Assam    The coastingtrade with the coasts of Coromandel and Malabâr       £  Observations  The above estimate is made designedly low for were we to argue from general principles a greater sum must have been imported annually into Bengal The twelve hundred and fifty thousand pounds remitted annually to  Delhi never returned into the province and as there were no mines wrought in the country the surplus of the revenue must have proceeded from the balance of trade Coin it is well known loses greatly by friction where little alloy is mixed with the silver and where the want of papercurrency makes the circulation extremely rapid It loses also by recoinage which happened annually under the empire in Bengal The practice of concealing and burying treasure which the terrors of despotism introduced has occasioned a considerable loss besides the quantity of silver and gold used in rich manufactures These various losses could be only repaired by a favourable balance of trade and the sum which we have stated above would barely supply the waste  State of Bengal under the revolted Nabobs  Gradual decline  THOUGH the causes which broke the empire were obvious the decline of the power of the house of Timur was gradual and imperceptible The seeds of decay were long sown before they were brought to an enormous growth by the indolence of Mahommed Shaw Had even the Persian invasion never happened the fabric which Baber raised in India was destined to fall to ruin The abilities of Aurungzêbe by establishing half a century of domestic tranquility in his dominions broke  the spirit of his subjects whilst that of the Imperial family declined The distant provinces obeyed the mandates of the court through habit more than through fear of its resentment and power and governors though destitute of ambition found in their own indolence an excuse for their inattention to commands which could not be inforced with rigour  of the power  The intrigues of the two Seids at the court of Delhi who raised and removed monarchs at pleasure weakened that respect for the house of Timur which bound the allegiance of the subject even after their mildness had degenerated into indolence Every month brought intelligence into the distant provinces of the murder of one prince whilst another was placed on a throne still warm with his predecessor's blood The veil which hid despotism from the eyes of the people was rent in twain monarchs became puppets which the minister moved at pleasure and even men who loved slavery on its own account knew not to what quarter to turn their political devotion The viceroys under a pretence of an unsettled succession retained the revenues of the provinces and with specious professions of loyalty for the Imperial family they became polite rebels against its authority  of the empire  Through this debility in the Imperial line a new species of government rose in various provinces of India The viceroys though they assumed the state of princes were still the HUMBLE SLAVES of some desolate monarch who sat without either power or dignity in the midst of the ruins of Delhi They governed the people in his name but they listened not to his commands He even became an instrument of oppression in their hands and they sanctified the most unpopular of their measures by inducing the prince to pass in their own cabinet regulations which originated under the seals of the empire Instead of a revenue they remitted to him bribes and the necessity of his situation reduced him into a tool to the very rebels who had ruined his power  Effect of  This mock form of an empire continued for many years and some provinces are still governed through the medium of a monarch that only subsists in his name But though the Nabobs affirmed that they had still an emperor the people found in their oppressions that there was none The check which the terror of complaints to Delhi had laid formerly on the conduct of the viceroys was now removed and the officers of the crown who had been placed between the subject and the governor were discontinued or deprived of their power The inferior tenants instead of being supported  by the Imperial collectors of the revenue against the avarice of the general farmers were submitted without redress to the management of the latter and were considered by him as a kind of property  its dissolution  The usurpation of Aliverdi introduced more than thirty years ago the abovedescribed form of government into Bengal The same policy was continued by his successors They owned the emperor of Delhi for their sovereign but they governed the country and collected its revenues for themselves The interposition of the crown being removed the independent Nabobs who succeeded one another either by force or intrigue adopted a more simple but a more impolitic mode of collecting the rents and imposts than that which had been practised by the house of Timur The lands were let from year to year to Zemindars who were accountable for the rents to the treasury and the former officers of the revenue though not annihilated possessed neither emolument nor power  on the province  An intimate knowledge of the country however enabled the Nabobs to prevent their government from degenerating into absolute oppression They had sense enough to see that their own power depended upon the prosperity of their subjects and their residence in the  province gave them an opportunity of doing justice with more expedition and precision than it was done in the times of the empire The complaints of the injured from a possession of the means of information were better understood The Nabobs were less restricted than formerly in inflicting necessary punishments and as they were accountable to no superior for the revenue they had it in their power to remit unjust debts and taxes which could not be borne The miseries of Bengal in short were reserved for other times Commerce manufactures and agriculture were encouraged for it was not then the maxim to take the honey by destroying the swarm  of Bengal  The folly of the prince had no destructive effect on the prosperity of the people The Nabobs carrying down through their own independent government the idea of the mild despotism of the house of Timur seemed to mark out to the people certain lines which they themselves did not chuse either to overleap or destroy Many now in Britain were eyewitnesses of the truth of this assertion We appeal to the testimony of those who marched through Bengal after the death of SurageulDowla that at that time it was one of the richest most populous and best cultivated kingdoms in the world The great men and merchants were wallowing in wealth  and luxury the inferior tenants and the manufacturers were blessed with plenty content and ease But the cloud which has since obscured this sunshine was near  Brief recapitulation  When the troubles which ended by putting Bengal into the hands of the Company first arose SurageulDowla a very young and inconsiderate prince was Nabob of the three provinces The good fortune which had at first forsaken us returned to our arms and by the assistance or rather opportune treachery of Jaffier one of his generals he was deposed and murdered We raised the Traitor as a reward for his convenient treason to a throne still warm with the blood of his lord and the measure seemed to be justified by our apparent inability of retaining the conquered province in our own hands  of its  The fortune of Jaffier however did not long withhold her frowns Though he had treachery enough to ruin his master he was destitute of abilities to reign in his place His weakness became an excuse for a revolution which had been meditated on other grounds and Cassim Ali Jaffier's soninlaw an intriguing politician was invested with the dignity and power of his father If Jaffier was weak Cassim had too good parts to be permitted to govern Bengal He was deposed and his  predecessor reinstated in his place This farce in politics was adopted as a precedent A governor without a revolution in the state of Bengal could not answer to himself for idling away his time  late revolutions  The civil wars to which a violent desire of creating Nabobs gave rise were attended with tragical events The country was depopulated by every species of public distress In the space of six years half the great cities of an opulent kingdom were rendered desolate the most sertile fields in the world lay waste and five millions of harmless and industrious people were either expelled or destroyed Want of foresight became more fatal than innate barbarism and men found themselves wading through blood and ruin when their object was only spoil But this is not the time to rend the veil which covers our political transactions in Asia  STATE OF BENGAL UNDER THE EASTINDIA COMPANY  Observations on the Treaty for the Dewanny  Reflections  AN ample field lay open before us but we have appropriated revolution and war to history The present disquisition is of an inferior kind an enquiry which means not to irritate but to reform Let it suffice to say that Bengal suffered from disturbances and violent measures and that Fortune though unfavourable was less fatal than the rapacity of avaricious men Peculiarly unhappy an unwarlike but industrious people were subdued by a society whose business was commerce A barbarous enemy may slay a prostrate foe but a civilized conqueror can only ruin nations without the sword Monopolies and an exclusive trade joined issue with additional taxations the unfor  were deprived of the means whilst the demands upon them were with peculiar absurdity increased  Observations  But to wander no farther into declamation though the misfortunes of Bengal began with the revolutions and changes which succeeded the death of SurageulDowla the system which advances still with hasty strides to the complete ruin of that once opulent province was established several years after that event A noble governor sent to command in Bengal by the East India Company arrived in that kingdom in the May of The expulsion of the Nabob Cassim Ali and the reduction of SujaulDowla by our arms had enabled the servants of the Company to establish peace upon their own terms The treaty which they concluded was absurd and had it been less exceptionable it would not probably have pleased a man who went not to India to be idle  on the treaty  The various revolutions of Fortune which had subjected several of the richest provinces of India to the Company's servants threw the undoubted heir of the Mogul empire into their hands The governor availed himself of this circumstance Other Nabobs had converted the unfortunate prince into a tool and it was now the turn of our governor to do the same for the benefit of his constituents Conscious of his power over the emperor and having the absolute direction of a Nabob who owed his elevation to the governor himself and to his own  crimes he threw aside the former treaty A perpetual commission for the office of Dewan or receivergeneral of the revenues of Bengal Behâr and Orissa was obtained from SHAW ALLUM for the Company The office of perpetual Nabob might have been as easily obtained but the former balanced a thousand disadvantages by rendering the nature of the tenure perplexed  with the emperor  In consideration of the Imperial mandate which with the revenues conferred the government of Bengal for ever on the Company Shaw Allum was to receive an annual pension of three hundred and twentyfive thousand pounds The annuity was moderate to the lineal successor of Timur He was at the same time guaranteed in the possession of the province of Allahabâd and thus a kind of provision was made for a prince who retained nothing of what belonged to his illustrious ancestors except the empty title of emperor of Hindostan This treaty however though it dazzled with its splendor was neither solid nor advantageous in itself The emperor instead of being placed at Allahabâd ought to possess the province out of which his pretended visier SujaulDowla had been recently driven or should that measure be supposed to invest him with dangerous power the territories of Bulwant Singh equal in revenue to Allahabâd might have been conferred  upon him The Company being then in possession of all these provinces might by its servants have adopted either of these systems  Shaw Allum  To the first measure there are no wellfounded objections and many advantages might be derived from it The sum of three hundred and twentyfive thousand pounds might have been annually saved which sum is now sent to a distant province from whence it never returns This latter circumstance is of more real prejudice to Bengal and the affairs of the Company than if half the revenues of the province had been given to the emperor upon condition of his keeping his court in that country Had Shaw Allum been put in possession of the dominions of SujaulDowla the natural inactivity of his disposition and the extraordinary expence and magnificence which he is in some measure obliged to support would have prevented him from being so dangerous a neighbour as even SujaulDowla The whole empire was in a state of rebellion and we were only from convenience his friends  for the Dewanny  Arguments crowd in to support this position but there are still stronger reasons for placing the emperor in the territories of Bulwant Singh His residence in such a case might have been fixed at Patna or Mongeer  and our army instead of being cantoned at Allahabâd and Cora two hundred miles from the frontier of our provinces might have remained in Patna in the center of our dominions Bengal had this measure been adopted instead of losing the pension paid to the emperor and the enormous expence of a brigade in a foreign country would have been enriched by the greater part of the revenues of the territories of Bulwant Singh for which he had paid twentytwo lacks of roupees to SujaulDowla though in reality he collected double that sum upon the subject  Its loss and inconvenience  The latter position will appear more obvious from the following state Bengal had the measure been adopted would annually have saved  The pension paid to the emperor  £  The expence of a brigade    Twenty lacks from the territories of Bulwant Singh spent at Patna         to the Company  This measure alone we may venture to affirm would have preserved Bengal in a flourishing condition in spite of avarice and mismanagement It would at the same time have been attended with many salutary effects in our political system in India The emperor would have been more immediately under our eye for  though he at present labours under an eclipse he may some time or other shine forth like a comet in the hands of an ambitious and able man We are now obliged to protect and support him under manifest disadvantages His territories border on the Mahrattors Jates and Rohillas and he is under a perpetual apprehension from these nations Had the measure the advantages of which we have described been taken SujaulDowla would have come in between him and these powers but at present our army at Allahabâd becomes a security to that prince whose apprehensions would otherwise have induced him to adhere more firmly than he now shews an inclination to his treaty with the Company  State of Commerce in Bengal under the Company  Observations on the  THE prosperity and opulence which Bengal enjoyed during the government of the house of Timur and even under the revolted viceroys proceeded from her lucrative commerce as much as from the fertility of her soil Rich in the industry of her inhabitants she became independent of the partial rapine of impolitic governors who plundered only to squander away The money which entered by injustice at one door of the treasury was carried out at another by luxury The court of the  Nabob was the heart which only received the various currents of wealth to throw it with vigour through every vein of the kingdom  present commerce of Bengal  We may date the commencement of decline from the day on which Bengal fell under the dominion of foreigners who were more anxious to improve the present moment to their own emolument than by providing against waste to secure a permanent advantage to the British nation With a peculiar want of foresight they began to drain the reservoir without turning into it any stream to prevent it from being exhausted From observation we descend to facts  The annual investments of the Company for which no specie is received amounts at an average of ten years to  £  Those of the Dutch for which the servants of the Company take bills on Europe for remitting fortunes acquired in Bengal    Those of the French paid for to the natives in the same way    Those of the Portuguese and Danes       £  £  Bengal it shall hereafter appear to replace all this waste scarce annually receives in bullion    She loses therefore yearly to Europe  £  Cause of its decline  The above estimate of the exports of Bengal for which she receives no specie is formed on the prime cost of her manufactures The balance against her comprehends the savings of the Company on the revenue the value of British exports the private fortunes of individuals which center in this kingdom This ruinous commerce with Europe is not balanced by a lucrative intercourse with the various states of Asia The increase of the demand for the manufactures of Bengal for our markets here and the revolutions which shook and greatly depopulated that kingdom have raised the price of goods The demand would upon this head sink in proportion in the East but besides the internal state of the various countries which formerly exchanged bullion for the goods of Bengal has been long unfavourable to foreign commerce  with Persia Egypt  Persia about thirty years ago a great and a flourishing empire has been torn to pieces and almost depopulated  by the cruelties of Nadir Shaw and since his assassination by unremitting civil wars The few inhabitants who escaped the rage of the sword sit down in the midst of poverty Georgia and Armenia who shared in the troubles of Persia share also her untoward fate Indigence has shut up the doors of commerce vanity has disappeared with wealth and men content themselves with the coarse manufactures of their native countries The Turkish empire has long declined on its southern and eastern frontiers Egypt rebelled Babylonia under its Basha revolted The distracted state of the former has almost shut up the trade by caravans from Suez to Cairo from the latter of which the manufactures of Bengal were conveyed by sea to all the ports of the Ottoman dominions  Syria Babylonia  The rapacity of the Basha of Bagdat which is encreased by the necessity of keeping a great standing force to support his usurpation has environed with terror the walls of Bussora which circumstance has almost annihilated its commerce with Syria Scarce a caravan passes from the gulph of Persia to Aleppo once in two years and when it does it is but poor and small Formerly in every season several rich and numerous caravans crossed the desart to Syria but the few that venture at present being too weak to protect themselves against the wandering  Arabs are stopt by every tribe and are obliged to purchase safety with exorbitant duties Trade is in a manner unknown the merchants of Bussora are ruined and there were last year in the warehouses of that city of the manufactures of Bengal to the value of two hundred thousand pounds which could not be sold for half the prime cost  the rest of Hindostan  The number of independent kingdoms which have started up from the ruins of the Mogul empire has almost destroyed the inland commerce of Bengal with the upper parts of Hindostan Every prince levies heavy duties upon all goods that pass through his dominions The merchants who formerly came down toward the mouths of the Ganges to purchase commodities have discontinued a trade not only ruined by imposts but even unsafe from banditti The province of Oud and Assâm are the only inland countries with which Bengal drives at present any trade The former has greatly the balance in its favour against us of late years from the money expended by seven thousand of our own troops which till of late have been stationed in the neighbourhood of the dominions of SujaulDowla in consequence of an impolitic treaty and to answer private views The commerce of salt beetlenut and tobacco with Assâm is almost balanced by  the quantity of silk Mugadutties and lack which we receive from that kingdom in return  and the regions of eastern Asia  The trade of Bengal with the kingdoms and islands of the eastern Asia still continues in some degree but it has been long on the decline The coasting trade with the maritime provinces of Hindostan has upon various accounts decayed We may venture to affirm upon the whole that the balance in favour of Bengal from all its Asiatic commerce exceeds not annually one hundred thousand pounds The council of Calcutta have calculated it at less than half that sum They estimated in the year the importation of bullion into Bengal for the space of four years at fifteen lacks of roupees which amounts annually to fortysix thousand pounds of our money But the cause of this decay lies more in negligence than in the present state of the maritime regions and islands beyond the eastern mouth of the Ganges  Estimate of the loss  To draw a conclusion from the observations made Though Bengal by her industry yields to Europe of manufactures to the annual amount of one million five hundred and seventyseven thousand five hundred pounds for which she receives nothing yet  if the balance of her trade with Asia amounts to one hundred thousand pounds she may still continue to flourish under a proper system of internal regulation The paradox is hitherto supportable by argument and proof but there still remain heavy articles to be brought into the account against Bengal Some of the articles from their complicated nature must be stated from opinion Others rest on incontrovertible facts The estimate of the first shall be made as low as possible The latter are established beyond the power of cavil itself  of specie to Bengal  The specie carried from Bengal by the expelled Nabob Cassim Ali is supposed to amount to  £  Specie carried away by men of property who have deserted the kingdom since the power of the company prevailed    The expences of the war for one whole year in the dominions of SujaulDowla at five lacks per month which after deducting fifty lacks paid by treaty by that prince amounts to    Carry over    Brought over  £  Specie sent from Bengal to pay a brigade consisting of seven thousand men stationed for five years after the peace at Allahabâd at the annual expence of fifteen lacks    Specie sent from that kingdom to China and Madrass including the expences of troops on the coast detached from the establishment of Bengal    Specie brought to England    Exported of specie    Deduct the imports of bullion for twelve years at the annual sum of one hundred thousand pounds    Decrease in the specie of Bengal since the accession of the company to the dominion of that kingdom    Her present compared  This ruinous state of the commerce of Bengal is by no means exaggerated To deprive every adversary of argument the calculations are by the Author of the Enquiry purposely rendered extremely low A comparative view of the former situation of that once opulent kingdom with its present condition will throw  additional light on the subject In the days of the empire the balance of trade for which Bengal received bullion has been estimated at  £  Deduct the annual revenue sent in specie to Delhi    Yearly acquisition in money    with her ancient commerce  The kingdom of Bengal it appears has not in the midst of her misfortunes fallen off greatly from her former exports of manufactures She still sends to Europe within one hundred and ten thousand pounds ayear of the quantity for which she received the above balance of bullion in the days of her prosperity This had not her specie been exported would not have impoverished her But let us suppose that her whole currency amounted to fifteen millions the entire loss of a third part of that sum must have inevitably distressed her and an annual decrease of near half a million must if not prevented in a few years totally ruin the little commerce that still remains The prospect is gloomy The taxes must be lessened and the ruin which we have brought on an unfortunate country will recoil upon ourselves  Reflections on the  To illustrate the argument by comparison Were the papercurrency of Great Britain totally suppressed  and her gold and silver currency which is estimated at seven millions left for the purposes of trade and taxation it is evident that ruinous consequences must ensue but none will pretend to affirm that the nation by such a measure would become one farthing poorer than before Trade however from the want of a sufficient quantity of the signs of wealth and property would be cramped in all its veins The interest of money in spite of laws would rise to an enormous pitch The same want of currency would at the same time become such a check upon luxury that the price of labour and especially of provisions would fall unless the latter were kept up by rigorously inforcing the present taxes without abatement The price of provisions in that case would rise every day and the poor would daily become less able to purchase The people would in a very few years be stript of all their property and national beggary would be followed by national ruin  ruinous state of Bengal  Bengal from the decrease of her specie feels in fact the miseries which we have in speculation just described Were not her taxes inforced by oppression provisions would fall in proportion to the decrease of wealth supposing the number of inhabitants and state of cultivation to continue the same But the reverse happens from our endeavouring to keep up the revenues to their  former pitch The farmer cannot sell his grain without a price which bears a proportion to the rents which he is obliged to pay whilst his cultivation decreases for want of a sufficient stock The consumer at the same time must have food If he is a manufacturer or labourer he must raise his goods or his wages to answer the price of bread The evils of a forced state of society encrease Famine with all its horrors ensues and by sweeping away some millions of wretched people gives to the unhappy survivors the respite of a few years  Observations on Monopolies  Reflections  THE Monopolies established by the servants of the Company in Bengal furnish an ample field for animadversion But other writers have already occupied that province The brevity which the Author of the Enquiry has prescribed to his work induces him to pass lightly over ground that has been trodden before It is superfluous to insist upon the prejudice which Monopoly has done to the natural rights of the natives and to the privileges which they possessed by prescription from Despotism itself This part of the subject has been handled with ability by others we shall slightly touch upon what has escaped their observation  on the ruinous  Salt in almost every country is one of the necessaries of life In Bengal which still contains near fifteen millions of people the consumption of this article must be very great for besides what they themselves consume they mix great quantities with the food of their cattle Salt is produced by filtrating the earth near the mouths of the Ganges and by then boiling the water which is impregnated with saline particles The process is simple and cheap where wood for fuel costs nothing The low price at which salt could be conveyed through all the branches of the Ganges rendered it an advantageous article of trade with the inland ports of Hindostan Great quantities were sent to Benâris and Mirzapour from the markets of which the provinces of Oud and Allahabâd the territories of the Raja of Bundela and of all the petty princes of the kingdom of Malava were supplied This trade by a society of Monopolists in Calcutta was seized in the year Avarice got the better of prudence and a rage for present gain cut off all future prospects The article of salt was raised two hundred  per cent  and the foreign purchasers finding that they could be supplied at a much cheaper rate with rocksalt from the dominions of the Rohillas near Delhi this valuable commerce at once was lost  Monopolies in Bengal  Beetlenut and Tobacco have by the strength of habit become almost necessaries of life in Hindostan The first is produced in many parts of the Decan and the latter is cultivated over all the empire There was however a considerable exportation from Bengal in these articles and it unfortunately for that country attracted the notice of the Monopolists But as if Monopolies were not sufficient to destroy the inland commerce of Bengal with the rest of Hindostan an edict was issued in the year prohibiting all the servants of the Company the free merchants Armenians Portuguese and all foreigners whatsoever from carrying goods beyond the limits of our province under the pain of confiscation and the severest punishments inflicted on their agents  The Directors vindicatod  The Court of Directors it is but justice to declare have invariably opposed the aboverecited destructive monopolies But the commands of fugitive and transient masters are weak in opposition to interest The fluctuations in Leadenhallstreet deprived the mandates which issued from it of all their authority and the presidency abroad frequently received orders from their constituents at home with the same inattention that the Nizâm of Golconda would pay to the Firmân of the  unfortunate Shaw Allum The Directors in short are only to blame in an acquiescence to a disobedience to the orders of their predecessors in office Carrying frequently the animosity of prior contention into their measures they forgot the attention due to their own power in the pleasure of seeing a slur thrown on that of their opponents They are also blameable for the suspicious veil of secrecy with which they affect to cover their affairs The door of information is in some measure shut up the inferior servants are precluded by an illfounded fear from laying open to them the state of Government abroad and it was perhaps the interest of their superior servants to conceal a part of the truth Substantial darkness has by these means settled on objects which it is even the interest of the Company as well as of the nation should be known to the world  Mode of collecting the Revenues  Fugitive  THE princes whom we raised in Bengal vanished imperceptibly from their thrones Light and unsubstantial as the shew of power with which as in derision we invested them they disappeared like Romulus but without a storm The benefits derived from former revolutions created a love of change and the angel of  death if not our friend was opportune in his frequent visits to the Musnud In the course of five years three Nabobs expired and the unfledged sovereign who acceded to the nominal government of Bengal on the March of has enjoyed already considering the times a long reign Nabobs to own the truth are useless and they are dismissed to their fathers without either ceremony or noise  Nabobs  In the year upon the demise of Jaffier whom we had for the first time raised in to the government for his convenient treachery to his master NijimulDowla his son by a common prostitute was in the eighteenth year of his age placed upon the throne in the capital of Murshedabâd Soon after the accession of this prince a noble governor on the part of the Company arrived at Calcutta and executed the treaty which has furnished materials for a preceding section Mahommed Riza a man of less integrity than abilities was made prime minister activity being a virtue more necessary to the intention of his creation than honesty The wretched NijimulDowla was a mere name a figure of state more despicable if possible than the meanness of his family and parts The whole executive government turned upon Mahommed Riza A resident was sent from Calcutta to check the accounts of the  nominal government as if one man who knew very little of the language manners and opinions of the people could prevent the frauds of an artful minister and ten thousand of his dependents versed in the management of finance The consequence might be foreseen with little penetration Unable and perhaps unwilling to oppose the current the resident fell down with the stream and became so far a check upon Mahommed that he appropriated to himself a part of what the minister might otherwise have thrown into his own treasure  Mahommed Riza Chan  Mahommed Riza as a small salary of office received annually one hundred and twelve thousand five hundred pounds with three hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds ayear to be distributed in pensions among his friends The minister with his other good qualities had no local attachment to friends They were of various complexions and religions fairfaced Europeans as well as swarthy Indians and though professing Mahommedanism himself he was so far from being an enemy to the uncircumcised that it is said the most of his pensions and gratuities were bestowed on good Christians born in Great Britain and Ireland Mahommed however did not take up his whole time with acts of benevolence to our nation He applied himself to  business and he was more rigid in executing the government which the revolted Nabobs had established in Bengal than fond of introducing innovations more favourable to the prosperity of the country  Impolitic  The Nabobs of Bengal it has been already observed began the ruinous policy of farming out the lands annually leaving the wretched tenants to the oppression and tyranny of temporary Zemindars At the commencement of every year there is a general congress of all the great farmers at the capital of Bengal which meeting is in the language of the country called Punea The object of the congress is to settle the accounts of the former year and to give the lands for another to the highest bidder The competition between the farmers is favourable to the private interest of Mahommed Riza and his friend the resident but it is destructive to the poor and consequently to the Company's affairs  and cruel  The charge of travelling from the more distant divisions of the province and the expence of living in the capital are but a very inconsiderable part of the loss of the farmers in this visit to court Pretences are never wanting to intimidate them on account of their past conduct and where no competitors offer of themselves some are created by the minister to raise anxiety and  terror Presents are an infallible remedy for quashing all enquiries into former oppressions and a bribe secures to them the power of exercising for another year their tyrannies over the unhappy tenants It would be endless to trace the intrigues of the farmers upon this occasion it would be difficult to expose all the artful villany of the minister The Zemindars however wealthy they may be feign such poverty as not to be able to make up the balances of the preceding year They have even been known to carry the farce so far as to suffer a severe whipping before they would produce their money  mode of  The avarice of Mahommed Riza is the cause of this unmanly behaviour in the wretched farmers When they seem rich the impost is raised and the bribe must in proportion be greater Their love of money is often more powerful than the fear of bodily pain When they have long groaned under the lash some banker or moneybroker appears who for the exorbitant interest of ten per cent per month discharges the debt The farmer by such means as these often deceives the vigilance of the minister and resident and obtains his lands for another year because no one else will offer a sum which the possessor finds so much difficulty to pay A friend in the secret gives security for the rents  and a present thrown into the hands of the minister suspends for the time the discipline of the whip  collecting the revenue  In the year the Author of the Enquiry who resided at the time in Bengal had the curiosity to calculate the expence of the Bundubust or yearly settlement He formed his estimate from the accounts of various Zemindars and he avers without exaggeration that the expences amounted to twentyseven and onehalf per cent of the rents of their lands which may amount to a million sterling These trivial perquisites were shared between Mahommed Riza his friends and the bankers of Murshedabâd The place of the Company's resident at the Durbâr or the court of the Nabob was HONESTLY worth one hundred and fifty thousand pounds ayear  The bad  These embezzlements and fraudulent practices were not however so detrimental to the Company's affairs from the actual decrease in the revenues as from the general depravity of manners and the oppressions which they introduced When the sources of government are corrupted they poison the whole stream Every petty officer in the state every clerk of the revenues assumed the tyrant in his own department Justice was totally suspended and the fear of being plundered by a superior  was the only check that remained against the commission of the most atrocious crimes Every instance of abstaining from the most cruel oppressions proceeded from indolence every act of tyranny from the love of money The distemper of avarice in the extreme seemed to infect all whom the wrath of God against a devoted people had placed in power  consequences  The consequences of this mode of letting the lands of Bengal were such as might with little foresight have been expected had not stronger impressions than those of reason been necessary to convince men of a profitable error Nothing in the conquered provinces was premeditated but rapine Every thing but plunder was left to chance and necessity who impose their own laws The farmers having no certainty of holding the lands beyond the year made no improvements Their profit must be immediate to satisfy the hand of Avarice which was suspended over their heads Impressed with the uncertainty of their situation they raised the rents to the last farthing on the wretched tenants who unwilling to forsake their ancient habitations and household gods submitted to impositions which they could not pay They looked up to Heaven in their distress but no redress remained for the wretched  Year after year brought new tyrants or confirmed the old in the practice of their former oppressions The tenants being at length ruined the farmers were unable to make good their contracts with government Their cruelty to their inferiors recoiled at length on themselves Many of them were bound to stakes and whipped but their poverty ceased to be feigned Their complaints were heard in every square of Murshedabâd and not a few of them expired in agonies under the lash Many of the inferior tenants reduced to despair fled the country hoping to derive from other despotisms that lenity which our indolence to speak the best of ourselves denied Those that remained were deprived of the small stock necessary for cultivation and a great part of the lands lay waste Every governor thought it incumbent upon him to keep up the revenues to their former pitch but in spite of the permitted cruelty of Mahommed Riza they continued every year to decrease It could not have happened otherwise unless Heaven had wrought miracles as a reward for our VIRTUES  Wretched state of the country  In proportion as an unfortunate people became less able to bear the established taxation the modes of collecting it became more oppressive Seven entire battalions were added to our military establishment to  inforce the collections They carried terror and ruin through the country but poverty was more prevalent than obstinacy every where This new force became an enormous expence to the Company and the unnatural pressure on the people raised the price of provisions The manufacturers to be able to purchase bread shewed an inclination to raise the price of their goods It was soon perceived that should this be permitted the manufactures of Bengal would not answer in Europe so as even to indemnify the Company for prime cost for duties and other expences exclusive of the profit which a commercial body had a right to expect The prices must be kept down but this could not be done without violence Provisions became daily dearer and the demand for goods encreased  from the officers  The officers chiefly employed in the management of the revenues being needy adventurers from Persia and the upper India carried avarice as well as the arbitrary ideas of their own distracted governments into their departments Solicitous to obtain an immediate advantage to themselves they forgot the interest of their employers and practised every species of rapine and violence on the timid inhabitants of Bengal The wealth which in the space of a few years they accumulated enabled them to return into their native  countries and thus they furnished another cause of the decline of specie in the kingdom These foreign collectors maintained a numerous train of needy dependents who under the protection of their tyrannical masters assumed the privilege of rapine and peculation Venality ceased to be a crime and dexterity in the art of imposition was deemed a recommendation to the first offices of trust  of government  Mahommed Riza made it his invariable policy to keep the servants of the Company in ignorance of the true state of affairs and when any deception was practised another was formed to conceal it from view He entered into a collusion with many of the farmers Occasional accounts were framed and the usual accounts were studiously involved in inextricable confusion Men averse to trouble throw them aside and neglect their duty in their indolence The servants of Mohommed Riza not only escape censure but retain their places and thus iniquity furnishes to itself a new field for a repetition of its execrable talents  Extortions  To investigate the various demands and extortions of the Aumins or the protectors of the people who instead of defending pillage their charge would be endless These by a collusion with the Zemindars prey  with them on the unfortunate tenants The Gomâstas or agents Dellols Pikes Pikars Burkândaz and other vermin employed in the collection and investment establish a thousand modes of oppression and extortion An ignorant and unhappy people see these officers of government through the medium of fear and comply in melancholy silence with their exorbitant demands No collector not even his principal servant travels over any part of his district without imposing upon the village in which he chuses to rest a tax of rice fowl kid fruits and every other luxury of the table for himself and his dependents He also levies fines at pleasure for frivolous offences and under various and often false pretexts The crime consists in the ability of the person to pay the fine and nothing but excess of misery and poverty is safe from the griping hand of Avarice  of the collectors  The Zemindars or principal farmers copy the officers of government in tyranny The Riôts or wretched tenants are forced to give their labour gratuitously to this transitory lord of a year whenever he chuses to employ their toil in his fields when their own farms lie waste for want of cultivation There is not one article of consumption with which the poor tenants are not obliged to supply the general farmer  The quantity brought is frequently more than his consumpt demands and in these cases they are forced under the inspection of his servants to carry their own property to market and to dispose of it for the use of their lord They even frequently raise or fall the exchange upon the roupees against the wretched husbandmen and without even the strength of custom they exact from the lower sort fees upon births marriages and contracts There is scarce an occurrence upon which they have not invented arbitrary imposts  Negligence of the Company  The Company having never examined into the real tenures by which many possess their lands left an ample field for sequestration fraud and encroachment The Talookdârs or the favourites and dependents of former Nabobs hold by grants from their patrons extensive tracts of land Some of these grants convey a kind of freehold others estates at a very low rent possessing besides particular exemptions and extraordinary immunities These alienations were never valid in the days of the empire without being renewed by every viceroy and no good reason remains why they should now exist as the illegal means of oppression in the hands of petty tyrants They have even added encroachment upon the adjacent lands to the injustice by which they possess their own and they have presumed to lay tolls on  ferries and imposts upon markets even beyond the limits of their imperfect grants This encroachment on the rights of the Company is however a kind of benefit to the people The possessor of the grant considers the lands which it describes as his own property and he is from a natural selfishness more a friend to his inferiors than the fugitive Zemindar of a year  in examining into  To render clear affairs hitherto little understood we must descend into more particulars The frauds and oppressions committed in Bengal in the collection of the revenue are as various as they are without number The interior policy subsisting in that kingdom will throw new light on the subject Some of the lands in Bengal go under the designation of Comâr having no native tenants being cultivated by vagrant husbandmen who wander from place to place in quest of labour A farmer takes frequently large tracts of these lands upon contract He obliges himself to be answerable to government for the produce but he keeps the accounts himself The vagrant husbandmen whom he employs having neither implements of agriculture nor stock are from time to time supplied with small sums by the farmer and when the harvest is gathered in he appropriates to himself two thirds of the crop after paying himself from the remainder for the interest of the sums advanced to the vagrants The accounts delivered in to government  contain every thing but the truth and this mode from our indolence becoming most profitable to the Zemindar he wishes to depopulate the country in some measure for his own gain  various  The lands which are under the immediate management of government are in the language of the country called Coss They differ from the Comâr in various particulars Stewards are appointed to superintend them without the power of making new contracts with the tenants or of raising upon them the rents being accountable only for the rents of the lands as they stand upon the rolls of the district These rolls however are in general false and defective Some lands to serve particular friends are greatly underrated and others are entirely concealed by the address of the stewards To grant certain immunities to the stewards themselves was formerly much in practice They were permitted to possess for their subsistence gardens pastures ponds for fish and fields for rice These privileges have been greatly enlarged since Bengal fell under the Company and the stewards have fixed no decent bounds to their encroachments  fictitious tefiures  The lands distinguished by the name of Riotty are possessed and cultivated by the native inhabitants under Zemindars or farmers who contract for them with government for an annual sum The rents are partly levied  on a measurement and partly on the various productions which are sent to market and converted into money by the farmer The ruinous effects of this mode of collecting the revenue have been already explained There are besides great quantities of waste lands which are of two kinds lands struck off the public books at a former period which are now cultivated but not brought to account and such as are really waste which comprehend at least one fourth part of Bengal Of the former there are many large fertile tracts well cultivated which have been appropriated by Zemindars and their dependents and they find means in their accounts with an indolent government to avoid all scrutiny into their usurpations  and encroachments  To add to the mismanagement lands are set apart for almost every officer under the government a mode of salary which makes no appearance upon the annual accounts but which notwithstanding amounts to more than all the apparent charges of collection Great hurt arises to the revenues from this practice and the abuse subsists without reformation The lands of all the officers ought instantly to be resumed and their salaries to be paid out of the exchequer Many of the collectors have also imposed partial duties upon the subject and thus have added oppression and injustice to the people to their usurpations upon government  Perversion of justice  Justice is suffered to be greatly perverted by the officers above specified and others who from their inherent art or abilities substitute their own decisions where government have established no legal judges The custom of imposing mulcts and fines in all cases is an intolerable grievance to a wretched people The rich suffer by having money to give the poor by being deprived of restitution because they have none Every Mahommedan who can mutter over the Coran raises himself to a judge without either licence or appointment and every Brahmin at the head of a tribe distributes justice according to his own fancy without controul The latter threatens the ignorant with the dreadful punishment of excommunication and thus his own moderation becomes the measure of the sums which he receives from an unfortunate race of men  S  lutary regulations made in    Such in the year was the true state of Bengal but it is to be hoped that the regulations of have reformed many abuses A plan was in that year digested and begun to be carried into execution by men who could not be strangers to any one of the above particulars though from their strict adherence to the regulations of a noble governor to which they were tied down by express orders from the Court of Directors the abuses were permitted to exist till the country was beggared and depopulated The effect  which the plan may have cannot yet be estimated with precision Were we however to judge from the improvements in Burdwan which has been under the management of a very able servant for some years past and has greatly encreased in revenue and population the new regulations will be attended with very considerable advantages to the Company But even Burdwân owed part of its prosperity to the misery and distress of the surrounding districts The plan adopted will be far from effectuating the reformation and encrease of the revenue which are now required for the balance of the revenue could in the year hardly discharge the four hundred thousand pounds paid annually to government If our information is just what mighty advantages have the Company derived from their great acquisitions in Bengal  Idea of the present Government of Bengal  Total suspension of all justice  THE total suspension of all justice among the natives of Bengal was another cause of national decay Men who retained some property in spite of the violence of the times instead of being protected by British laws found that they had not even the justice of a despot to depend upon when they were wronged The officers of the Nabob AS THEY WERE CALLED committed  every species of violence under the pretence of the orders of the Company When any person complained to the governor and council he was referred back to those very men of whom he had complained The heavy crime of having appealed to British justice was thrown in his face by oppressors who were at once judges and party and ruin and corporal punishment were added to his other wrongs The spirit which asserts the natural rights of mankind was called insolence till it was totally broken by oppression and men were even cautious in venting their complaints in secret fearing that the very walls of their most private apartments had ears  Apology for the Company's governors  These grievances however proceeded not from the inhumanity of the British governors in Bengal The Author of the Enquiry can aver from personal knowledge that the successors of a certain noble lord were men of probity and honour enemies to oppression and cruelty of every kind But the whole weight of such a monstrous and heterogeneous chaos of government consisting of military political commercial and judicial affairs falling upon the shoulders of men unexperienced in the regulation and management of the great machine of state it was impossible for them to give the necessary attention to all departments The multiplicity of affairs  overwhelmed them with its weight and the kingdom suffered more from a total want of system than from any premeditated design  Every thing left to the summary decisions of Mahommed Riza  The courts of justice which the wisdom of the house of Timur had established in the cities and various divisions of the provinces were either annihilated or they lost their power under the summary despotism of the revolted Nabobs Mahommed Riza as the acting minister had the whole executive power in his hands and those who retained the name of judges were only the executioners of his partial and violent decisions The Company's governor could not in the nature of things enter into the cause of every individual in a very populous kingdom When he consulted his own ease he yielded to a kind of necessity and he had to his own conscience the plausible excuse of having remanded the complaints to the judgment of a man who was perfectly acquainted with the manners customs and prejudices of the natives  Impolitic and ruinous  But even friendship itself will not permit the Writer of the Enquiry to justify the political conduct of any of those men who possessed the supreme power in Bengal Many regulations obvious in themselves might have been formed many pernicious practices be abolished  which have been continued either through negligence or motives of another kind Among the latter ought to be numbered the custom of striking roupees every year and issuing them out at five per centum above the real weight and standard To explain the subject a dry dissertation must be introduced The newcoined roupees are issued from the mint at sixteen per centum more than the current roupee a coin merely imaginary for the convenience of reducing all money to a certain denomination The Sicca roupee as the coin is called continues to circulate at the above value till towards the latter end of the first year The dealers in money as the roupee loses three per centum of its value at the beginning of the second year refuse to receive it in payment without a deduction of one or two per centum as it advances to that period  conduct of  In the beginning of the second year the roupee by this most preposterous of all regulations has lost three per centum of its imaginary value In this manner it continues gradually to fall till the third year after coinage and from that time forward it remains at eleven per centum the intrinsic value of the silver The possessor of the roupee may then upon the payment of three per centum to the mint have the same recoined into a new Sicca of the imaginary value of sixteen per centum  This gain of two per centum is intended as an inducement to bring in the silver that the government may have an opportunity every year of robbing the public of three per centum upon the greater part of their current specie To support this most iniquitous system the revenues are directed to be paid in the new Sicca roupees otherwise the moneychanger will make such deductions as must occasion a very considerable loss to the unfortunate people This evil is attended by another The course of exchange in the markets varies toward the worst from this cruel regulation by government from combinations among the bankers and the demand for particular roupees to discharge the revenue  the mint  This mode of levying an annual tax on the silver currency is not of the invention of the British governors of Bengal The regulation derived its first existence from the wellknown bankers the Jaggat Seats of Murshedabâd in the short reign of the inconsiderate SurageulDowla The error lies in its being adopted But we drop this part of the subject and return to the present state of government To do justice to the Court of Directors their repeated orders have checked the violence and rapine of the nominal government of the Nabob Some of the Company's servants superintend in  various divisions of the country the collection of the revenue The pension and emoluments of Mahommed Riza have been lessened with his power The kingdom in point of civil regulation if civil regulation can exist without regular courts of justice is on a better footing than before But much remains to be done The distresses of an unfortunate people continue to increase through causes which must be explained  General Observations  Conclusions  THE idea of the present state and government of Bengal conveyed in the preceding sections justifies the following conclusion That the Company in the management of that great kingdom have hitherto mistaken their own interest To increase the revenues was the point to which their servants invariably directed their attention but the means employed defeated their views and became ruinous to a people whom their arms had subdued Though they exported the specie though they checked commerce by monopoly they heaped oppression upon additional taxes as if rigour were necessary to power  deduced  Much penetration was not necessary to discover that it was not by the revenues of Bengal alone that either the British nation or the Company were to be enriched A country destitute of mines deprived of foreign commerce must however opulent from better times in the end be exhausted The transitory acquisition upon the opinion that all the specie of Bengal had centered in Great Britain would have no desirable effect The fugitive wealth would glide through our hands and we would have only our folly to regret when the sources would happen to become dry Bengal without ruin to itself could spare none of its specie and the objects to which our aim should have been directed are as obvious as they are salutary We ought to have encouraged agriculture the trade with the rest of Asia and internal manufacture  from the  Agriculture constitutes the wealth of every state not merely commercial Bengal a kingdom six hundred miles in length and three hundred in breadth is composed of one vast plain of the most fertile soil in the world Watered by many navigable rivers inhabited by fifteen millions of industrious people capable of producing provisions for double the number as appears from the desarts which oppression has made it seems  marked out by the hand of Nature as the most advantageous region of the earth for agriculture Where taxes are moderate where security of property is joined to a rich soil cultivation will encrease the necessaries of life will become cheap as well as the gross materials which manufacturers require Manufactures by these means would not only fall in their price but they would be produced in a greater quantity larger investments might be made by the Company the consumption would encrease and the profits rise Bengal can in short be only useful in the prosperity and industry of its inhabitants Deprive it of the last remains of its wealth and you ruin an unfortunate people without enriching yourselves  preceding  In the place of those placid regulations which render mankind useful to their lords we substituted with preposterous policy force the abrupt expedient of barbarous conquerors The pressure of taxation has in the space of a few years trebled the price of provisions of all kinds The Company have in the mean time been endeavouring by every possible measure to encrease their investments without raising the price Various oppressions have for this purpose been adopted This wretched expedient is of short duration The manufacturer  may for one year perhaps for two redouble his industry but whilst the works of his hands is forced from him at a stated and arbitrary price he sinks under an uncommon effort subject to despair The principal servants of the Company to conceal the evil have found themselves obliged either to remit in the quality of the goods or to raise the price to the manufacturer Both expedients have been in part adopted but it is a temporary remedy without the hopes of effectuating a cure  Observations  The reasons already mentioned have contributed to destroy the trade of Bengal with the rest of Asia Merchants can only procure the gleanings of the Company The quality is inferior and the prices high Nations formerly supplied from Bengal found themselves under the necessity of establishing manufactures of the same kind at home or to adapt their clothing to their poverty Argument on this head is superfluous The plan must be totally and radically changed The question is not to oblige the people to become silkwinders spinners and weavers and to take the fruits of their labour as it is practised at present at an arbitrary price Industry cannot be forced upon a people let them derive advantage from toil and indolence shall lose its  hold Ingenuity expires under the foolish despotism which defeats its own ends and human nature in its most wretched state revolts against labour which produces nothing but an increase of toil  PLAN FOR RESTORING BENGAL TO ITS FORMER PROSPERITY  Preliminary Observations  Reflections on the government of India  GOVERNMENT among the natives of a country rises imperceptibly from that impenetrable obscurity with which time and barbarism have covered the origin of mankind When states are subdued by foreign enemies who are advanced in the arts of civil life a new constitution generally starts up from their pressure upon the old Some laws of the conquerors must necessarily supersede some of the regulations of the conquered but the ancient form of government remains in all the lesser departments of the state When the Patans conquered India when the Moguls extended their empire over that country many of the indigenous laws of the northern nations of Asia were introduced but the great system in most of its parts descended from  the regulations which Brahma transmitted with his followers from remote antiquity  Design of the Author  The British nation have become the conquerors of Bengal and they ought to extend some part of their own fundamental jurisprudence to secure their conquests To call the possessions of the Company by any other name is to leave them undefined The sword is our tenure and not the Firmân of an unfortunate prince who could not give what was not his own The thin veil of the commission for the Dewanny is removed and we see a great kingdom at last in our power whose revolutions we directed before It is an absolute conquest and it is so considered by the world This it was necessary to premise The Author of the Enquiry will now proceed to his plan for restoring our conquests to their former prosperity But he proceeds with diffidence he sees the magnitude of the subject he feels his own want of abilities He hopes not to escape without censure as he confesses himself liable to error but he shall answer his own purpose if he can throw some rays of light upon a subject which though interesting to the nation continues still involved in obscurity  Proposal for establishing landed Property  New arrangement proposed  POLICY precedes regulation in every society and a nation has public before it has private concerns The great line of general arrangement is prior to the inferior detail of government the latter being necessarily a superstructure raised on the foundation of the former In Bengal we are to suppose that a new treaty is to settle its great affairs otherwise we build on the sand and the rain comes and washes all away We shall only mention a subject on which we may hereafter enlarge Give the province of Allahabâd to SujaulDowla the territories of Bulwant Singh to the emperor recal your troops into your own dominions make Patna or Mongeer the residence of the representative of Timur degrade the wretched Mubârick from his nominal Nabobship and let Mahommed Riza RESIGN These arrangements require no address the persons mentioned were the creatures and they still continue the slaves of your power Besides the measures will not displease the parties The province of Allahabâd will satisfy SujaulDowla for the territories of Bulwant Singh Shaw Allum will prefer Patna to his residence at Allahabâd a small pension is more eligible for Mubârick than the dangerous name of power which  he does not hold and Mahommed Riza has derived from his SERVICES the means of securing an affluent retreat for his age If it shall appear necessary to retain Bengal by an Imperial Firmân let it be changed into that of perpetual Nabob  Reflections on landed property  This fundamental regulation being settled another of equal boldness but no less practicable ought to succeed An established idea of property is the source of all industry among individuals and of course the foundation of public prosperity When mankind are restrained from possessing any thing which they can call their own they are but passengers in their native country and make only those slight accommodations which suit fugitive wayfarers through the land A carelessness for industry is the natural consequence of the transitoriness of the fruits of toil and men sit sluggishly down with their hands in their bosoms when they are not for a moment certain of possessing property much less of transmitting it to their posterity or friends  Proposal for establishing  The decline of agriculture of commerce and of trade in the kingdom of Bengal have been already represented and the ruinous consequences of farming out the lands from year to year have been amply explained Though long leases might greatly contribute to remove  these evils there is no possibility of doubt but the establishment of real property would more immediately and effectually promote a certainty of prosperity to the kingdom Let therefore the Company be impowered by act of Parliament to dispose of all the lands in Bengal and Behâr in perpetuity at an annual sum not less than the present rents This single operation would have a chain of beneficial effects The first sale of the lands would raise a sum which cannot be estimated with any degree of precision but we may venture to affirm that should the scheme be properly advertised before it was to take place and a fourth part of the lands only to be disposed of every year until the whole should be sold no less than ten millions besides a certain and perpetual revenue might be drawn from the hidden treasures of Bengal and especially from the other opulent kingdoms of Hindostan  landed property  Mankind it is easy to perceive would in an empire where no real property exists crowd to a country in which they could enjoy the fruits of their labour and transmit them to their posterity Cultivation would be the consequence of security The farmer would improve to the height lands that were his own The revenue would be regularly paid without the heavy expence of a band of oppressors under the name of Collectors who suck the very vitals of the country and nothing  would be required but a few comptoirs for the purpose of receiving the rents The whole face of the country would be changed in a few years in the place of straggling towns composed of miserable huts half of which are washed away every season by the rain great and opulent cities would arise Inhabitants would crowd into Bengal from every corner of India with their wealth the deficiency in the currency would be restored commerce would diffuse itself through every vein and manufactures would flourish to a degree before unknown  in Bengal  Men of speculation may suppose that the security of property to the natives might infuse a spirit of freedom dangerous to our power into our Indian subjects Nature herself seems to have denied liberty to the inhabitants of the torrid zone To make the natives of the fertile soil of Bengal free is beyond the power of political arrangement The indolence which attends the climate prevents men from that constant activity and exertion which is necessary to keep the nice balance of freedom Their religion their institutions their manners the very dispositions of their minds form them for passive obedience To give them property would only bind them with stronger ties to our interest and make them more our subjects or if the British nation prefers the namemore our slaves  Its great  Men who have nothing to lose are only enslaved by disunion and the terror of the impending sword Drive them to the last verge of poverty and despair will stand in the place of spirit and make them free Men possessed of property are enslaved by their interest by their convenience their luxury and their inherent fears We owe our freedom to the poverty of our ancestors as much as to the rude independence of their ferocious barbarism But it is even difficult in the cool air of our climate to retain in the midst of luxury and wealth the vigour of mind necessary to keep us free To confer property on the inhabitants of Bengal will never raise in their minds a spirit of independence Their sole hopes of retaining that property will be derived from our policy and valour When we fall their lands will deviate to other heirs  and imme+diate  The revenues of Bengal when properly paid amount to four millions Should this sum appear too small for perpetuity many ways and means of encreasing the taxes without raising the rents will present themselves The British nation famous for their political freedom are still more famous for their judgment and wisdom in imposing taxations Let them transfer to the Banks of the Ganges a part of that science of finance which has so much distinguished their councils  at home The wealth of the people of Bengal is a treasury which will never fail if drawn upon with judgment Taxes may rise in a just proportion to the wealth which this regulation will inevitably throw into our dominions in the East  advantages  Very extensive possessions in the hands of an individual are productive of pernicious consequences in all countries they ought therefore to be prevented in the present regulation Let the purchasers be confined to a certain quantity of land not exceeding upon any account fifty thousand roupees ayear To prevent the accumulation of landed property let the spirit of the laws of a commonwealth be adopted and the lands be divided equally among all the male issue of the proprietor Let the moveable property be divided among the Mahommedan part of our subjects according to the laws of the Coran Let the Hindoos in the same manner retain their own laws of inheritance which are clear simple and defined  Paper Currency  A proposal for establishing  THE absolute establishment of landed property would create a perfect confidence in our faith among our subjects in the East and this circumstance leads to another regulation which if adopted would have a great and immediate effect on the prosperity of Bengal The want of a sufficient quantity of specie for the purposes of trade and the common intercourses among mankind is one of the greatest evils under which Bengal at present labours Let therefore a paper currency be introduced a measure at once salutary easy and practicable Let a bank be immediately established at Calcutta for the convenience of Europeans This would by becoming familiar to the natives prepare them for a more general paper currency The mode of carrying this into execution is left in the hands of those better acquainted with the nature of banking than the Author of the Enquiry  currency  To destroy at once the fraudulent science of exchange which proves so detrimental to trade in Bengal a current coin ought to be established to pass without variation for its fixed and intrinsic value This was in some degree attempted by a noble governor but he failed in his first principles by imposing an arbitrary  value upon his coin not less than twenty per cent above its intrinsic worth No other reason is necessary for the bad success of this coinage Though a decimal division of money is the most rational and commodious yet entirely to change the forms of a country in that respect might be attended with great inconvenience Let the roupee therefore consist as at present of sixteen of the imaginary Anas which are now used in accounts in Bengal The Pice which is the twelfth part of an Ana may be continued as the imaginary coin but a copper coin of one half of an Ana would answer the subdivisions of money and be greatly beneficial to the poor  Its great  The immediate fall of the exorbitant interest of money which prevails in Bengal would be one of the first effects of this regulation Ten per centum is the present interest not so much owing to insecurity as to the want of currency Men of undoubted and established credit are ready to give this great premium to the lender as they can turn the money to a great and immediate advantage Were every man enabled by a paper currency to bring his whole property to the market monopoly in spite of oppression would be at an end and trade extend itself through a thousand channels not known now in speculation The consequence  would be highly beneficial Bengal would draw great quantities of money from all the regions of Asia and by enriching herself be rendered capable of bearing such taxes upon different articles as this nation for the augmentation of the revenues might think proper to impose  and immediate  Napal Thibet Ava Arracân Pegu Siam Cochinchina China and almost all the islands in the Eastern ocean produce gold In the west that metal seems only to be found in the Turkish Diarbekir Japan and China only have silver mines Asia contains native wealth which has enriched it in all ages exclusive of the balance of its commerce against Europe The Author of the Enquiry means not that specie should be drawn from the East But it might center in Bengal and make it one of the richest kingdoms in the world whilst we might import in its manufactures the surplus of its revenues without damaging either its foreign commerce or internal prosperity  advantages  These two plans and it is to be feared only these would restore under a government established on impartial justice Bengal to its former prosperity and splendor Let the lands be disposed of in property let a paper currency be established Every individual would  in such a case become industrious in improving his own estate provisions would fall to a third part of the present price the country would assume a new face and the people wear the aspect of joy Immense tracts of rich land which now with their woods conceal the ruins of great cities would again be cultivated and new provinces arise out of those marshy islands near the mouth of the Ganges which are at present the wild haunts of the rhenoceros and tiger  Monopolies  Monopolies  THERE is no maxim in commerce better established than the destructive tendency of monopolies In Bengal its recent evils are wellknown and abhorred A law must provide against it otherwise every other regulation will be made in vain The inhabitants must be permitted to enjoy a free trade subject however to such imposts upon various articles excepting those of either the growth or manufacture of Great Britain as may be thought reasonable from time to time Gross articles necessary for carrying on the finer manufactures ought however to be exempted from duty and every encouragement possible given to the export trade  abolished  Free merchants ought to be encouraged neither must they be excluded from the inland trade as that circumstance would place the subjects of Great Britain on a worse footing than foreigners whom we cannot without violence prevent from trading wherever they please Let however the residence of the free merchants be confined to Calcutta as the influence which all the natives of Britain have acquired over the inhabitants of Bengal is so great that the selfish can convert it into the means of oppression The Indian agents of British traders will not carry among a wretched people the same terror which clothes their masters whom it is a kind of sacrilege not to obey in their most unjust commands  Superior servants debarred from trade  The servants of the Company will have many objections to this proposal But the management of the revenues and of the general trade which must remain in their hands will still give them superior advantages sufficient to gratify all their reasonable desires The influence of a member of the council will without doubt enable any man in that high station to engross a share of the trade almost equal to a partial monopoly Should even a man of that rank be so selfdenied as not to take advantage of the influence annexed to his place his attention to commerce would encroach on  the time allotted for public affairs Let him therefore when he rises to the board be debarred from trading either directly or indirectly by severe penalties of law and let there an ample allowance be made forhis services from the funds of the Company  Religion  An absolute  MEN who submit to bodily servitude have been known to revolt against the slavery imposed on their minds We may use the Indians for our benefit in this world but let them serve themselves as they can in the next All religions must be tolerated in Bengal except in the practice of some inhuman customs which the Mahommedans have already in a great measure destroyed We must not permit young widows in their virtuous enthusiasm to throw themselves on the funeral pile with their dead husbands nor the sick and aged to be drowned when their friends despair of their lives  toleration  The Hindoo religion in other respects inspires the purest morals Productive from its principles of the greatest degree of subordination to authority it prepares mankind for the government of foreign lords It supplies  by its wellfollowed precepts the place of penal laws and it renders crimes almost unknown in the land The peaceable sentiments which it breathes will check the more warlike doctrines promulgated by the Coran The prudent successors of Timur saw that the Hindoo religion was favourable to their power and they sheathed the sword which the other princes of the Mahommedan persuasion employed in establishing their own faith in all their conquests Freedom of conscience was always enjoyed in India in the absence of political freedom  of all religions  Attention must be paid to the usages and very prejudices of the people as well as a regard for their religion Though many things of that kind may appear absurd and trivial among Europeans they are of the utmost importance among the Indians The least breach of them may be productive of an expulsion from the society a more dreadful punishment Draco himself could not devise But the caution about religion is superfluous these are no converting days Among the list of crimes committed in Bengal persecution for religion is not to be found and he that will consent to part with his property may carry his opinions away with freedom  The Executive Power  Reflection on the  THE great path of general regulation is with less difficulty traced than the minute lines which carry the current of government from the center to the extremities of the state Practice resists theory more on this subject than in any other and the wisest legislators can neither foresee nor prevent obstacles which may rise in the progress of time In a country where the body of the people meet annually in their representatives to new inconveniences new remedies may be instantly applied and even the mandate of the despot loses half its tyranny in the expedition with which it opposes evil  mode of legislation  The distance of Bengal from the eye of the British legislature renders it extremely difficult for them to frame laws against every emergency that may arise and it is equally difficult with propriety to create a legislative authority in a kingdom which cannot in the nature of things have a representative of its own The executive power being vested in the governor and council it is dangerous to trust them with the legislative and it is impossible to permit the court of justice which we mean to propose to make those laws upon  which they are to decide The least of two evils is preferred by the prudent Let the governor and council suggest annually in their general letter the necessary regulations and these after being duly weighed by the Company in their collective body at home be laid before parliament to be by them if found just necessary and equitable framed into a law The general laws for the government of Bengal being by the British legislature once established the inconveniences which may arise in India will neither be so great nor detrimental as to occasion much mischief for one or even two years in which time the proposed regulations sent home by the governor and council will return to them with the force of laws  the council  The executive power in its full extent as at present must be vested in a president and council of which the chief justice and commander in chief of the troops ought to be  ex officio  members The number should be encreased to sixteen of which any five with the president may form a board and ten always to reside at Calcutta exclusive of the chief justice and the commander in chief should even the peaceableness of the times permit him to be absent from the army The four remaining counsellors should be directed to reside in the capitals of the larger districts into which for the benefit of justice we  shall hereafter divide the provinces of Bengal and Behâr The business for forming regulations to make a foundation of a law being of the last importance ought never to come before less than ten members in council of whom the chief justice ought invariably to be one  boards of revenues  Let a general board of revenue be established at Calcutta at which a member of the council is to preside Let this board in its inferior departments be conducted by the Company's servants and let it receive the correspondence and check the accounts of four other boards of the same kind but of inferior jurisdiction to be fixed at Dacca Murshedabâd Mongeer and Patna Let the provinces of Bengal and Behâr be divided into five equal divisions each subject in the first instance to one of the four boards which are all under the controul of the superior board of revenue established at Calcutta In the lesser districts let a Company's servant superintend the collection of the revenue and be accountable for his transactions to the board under whose jurisdiction he acts    The wild chaos of government if the absence of all rule deserves the name which subsists in Bengal must be utterly removed There some saint traces of the British constitution is mixed with the positive orders of  a Court of Directors the convenient and temporary expedients of a trading governor and council the secret orders of the select committee the influence of the president with the Nabob and the boisterous despotism of Mahommed Riza To separate or even to restrain them within proper bounds is beyond human capacity some branches must be lopt off to give more vigour and room to others to flourish Mubârick must retire from the Musnud Mahommed Riza and the secret committee vanish away and even the council itself must be restrained from BREVI MANU despotism such as the sending home by force British subjects and dismissing officers without the sentence of a court martial  Judicial Power  Reflection  TO preserve the health of the political body the pure stream of impartial justice must rush with vigour through every vein When it meets with obstructions a disease is produced and when the whole mass becomes corrupted a languor succeeds which frequently terminates in death To drop the metaphor the distributers of justice ought to be independent of every thing but the law The executive part of government must not interfere with the decisions of the judge otherwise that officer who was created for the defence  of the subject from injury becomes a tool of oppression in the hands of despotism  Various jurisdictions in Bengal  The first principle of wise legislation is to open an easy passage to the temple of Justice Where the seat of redress is either distant or difficult of access an injury is forgot to avoid the trouble of complaint and thus injustice is encouraged by the almost certain prospect of impunity To avoid this evil the Author of the Enquiry thinks it necessary that the act of the legislature which shall constitute the mode of distributing justice should also divide Bengal and Behâr into five great provinces the capitals of which ought to be Calcutta Murshedabâd and Dacca in Bengal and Patna and Mongeer in Behâr Let each of these five great divisions be subdivided into ten Chucklas or extensive districts almost the number of which the kingdom consists at present and let each of these be still subdivided into an indefinite number of Pergunnas  Constables and justices of the peace  To bring justice to use a certain author's words home to the door of every man let there in each village be established as in the days of the empire a Muckuddum to act as a constable for the preservation of the peace A Sheichdâr with a commission similar to that of a justice of the peace should be fixed in the most  centrical part of the Pergunna or lesser district to whom disputes which cannot be quashed by the authority of the Muckuddum or constable may be referred Let the court of this officer however communicate with another of a more extensive and ample jurisdiction established in the capital of the division or district of which the Pergunna is a part  Cutwál or Mayor  Similar to the office of a Sheikdâr or justice of the peace ought to be that of the Cutwâl or mayor of great towns and considerable cities The wisdom of the house of Timur established this officer to animadvert upon thieves gamblers and other miscreants to remove nuisances to suppress pimps and jugglers to prevent forestalling of grain and other provisions to be the regulator of the market and to decide in all trivial and vexatious disputes that tended toward a breach of the peace His ministerial office coincided almost with that of the mayors of our lesser towns and his court was the counterpart of the now obsolete CURIA PEDIS PULVERIZATI mentioned by our lawyers  Courts of Cutcherri  In every Chuckla or greater division let there be established a court similar in its nature but different in its mode to the courts of Cutcherri instituted in the days of the empire Let this court be composed of the  Company's servant residing for the collection of the revenue in the Chuckla and of two Mahommed Cazis and two Brahmins The servant of the Company ought to be the nominal president of the court but only to sit when the voices are equal to throw his castingvote on the side of equity In such a case the process to begin anew The fees of the court must be regulated and a table of the expence of every article to be hung up to public view in the common hall The punishment for corruption upon conviction in the supreme court of Bengal ought to rise to a degree of severity suitable to the danger of the crime  Its jurisdiction  This court besides the power of hearing appeals from the decisions of the Sheichdâr in the lesser districts ought to retain its ancient authority subject however to an appeal from decisions beyond a sum to be specified to the provincial courts which shall be hereafter described Its jurisdiction ought to extend to the contracting and dissolving of marriages to the settlement of doweries for women and the succession to money and moveables among children according to the respective institutes of the Mahommedan and Hindoo systems of religion It ought also to be a court of record and to be obliged to keep an exact register of all public and private contracts births marriages and deaths and to execute that department of the business a Canongoe and  a Mutaseddy as clerks ought to be annexed to each court These with other matters to be described in the succeeding section ought to comprehend the whole power of the court of Cutcherri  Provincial courts  In each of the capitals of the five provinces a member of the council of state at Calcutta ought to reside He together with possessing the management of the Company's commercial affairs in his province ought to be empowered by a special commission with three assessors of the elder resident servants to form and preside in a court of justice which we shall for distinction call The provincial court of appeal To direct their judgment upon points of law an officer under the name of Attorneygeneral for the province ought to be appointed to give his advice together with a Mahommedan Cazi and an Indian Brahmin to explain the principles of their respective institutions and usages and to tender oaths to the parties Suits may originate in this court and it ought to have the power of removing before itself the proceedings of the court of Cutcherri  Supreme court its civil  To establish thoroughly the independence of the judicial on the executive power a supreme court from which an appeal ought only to lie to Great Britain should be erected at Calcutta by the authority of the legislature  Let it consist of a chief justice and three  puisné  justices who derive their commissions from the king and let them be in Bengal the counterpart of the court of king's bench in England The jurisdiction of this court which from its transcendent power may be called the supreme court of Bengal ought to extend without limitation over the whole kingdom and to keep the inferior courts within the bounds of their authority as well as to decide ultimately upon all appeals It ought to protect the just rights of the subject by its sudden and even summary interposition and to take cognizance of criminal as well as of civil causes  and criminal jurisdiction  To carry justice in criminal matters with all the expedition possible through our conquests it is proposed thas two of the  puisné  justices shall twice ayear go on circuits to the respective capitals of the five provinces one into the three provinces in Bengal and one into the two into which Behâr is to be divided The  puisné  justice shall sit upon these occasions with the members of the provincial court but the member of the council who is the president of the court shall still be considered as the principal judge In criminal matters the culprit shall be tried by a jury of British subjects only there being always a sufficient number of good and lawful men to form a jury in the  capital of the province In the supreme court at Calcutta disputes between the natives may be decided in civil cases according to equity without a jury by the judges but in suits between British subjects the matter ought to be tried by a jury upon the principles of the law of England  Court of exchequer  The sole management of the revenue of Bengal being in the Company many capital alterations are necessary to be made in that important branch The great channel of public justice has been by the above regulations separated from the executive power but some part of the judicial authority must still remain in the Company's hands To manage the receipts of the revenue it has been already mentioned that five boards must be formed the superior one of which to remain in Calcutta The boards ought to consist of two divisions or rather of two sides the receipt of the Exchequer and the judicial part which must enable them to inforce the payment of the revenues  its jurisdiction  The mode of proceeding in this branch ought to rise in the same gradations with the course of appeals in the civil line of disputes between man and man Let the Cutcherries inforce the payment of the revenues of the Chucklas under an appeal to the provincial board  whose decisions beyond certain sums ought to be subject to the revision of the general board at Calcutta But as the state must not suffer through delay let the sum in dispute upon a decision against the subject by any of the courts of revenue before whom the suit shall originate be forthwith paid into the exchequer and let the person aggrieved seek for redress by petition to the court which is placed immediately above that court of whose decision he complains  confined as such  The board of revenue in each of the capital cities of the five provinces except in Calcutta where no court of law except the supreme court exists is to be made up of the same persons whom we have already placed as judges in the provincial court of appeal The court of exchequer in England examines by a fiction into all sorts of civil causes It is necessary to preclude the boards of revenue from such powers as a court of exchequer As provincial courts of common law their decisions are liable to an appeal to the supreme court at Calcutta and therefore any prejudices which they may be supposed to imbibe as members of the executive part of government cannot be of great detriment to the people subject as their proceedings are to a court not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Company  Observations on the Judicial Power  Reflections  THE despotism which naturally sprung from the double government which arose on the foundation of the success of our arms in Bengal repressed one evil whilst it gave birth to a thousand Those frequent disputes which grow between individuals where the access to justice is easy were quashed by a terror which prevented an unfortunate people from appearing before rulers who wanted but an excuse to oppress The hand of power fell heavy upon both the plaintiff and defendant and therefore men put up with injuries from one another in hopes of concealing themselves from the rigid eyes of government This alludes to the boisterous tyranny of the minister of a nominal Nabob indolence was more our crime than cruelty  on what of their own laws  The doors opened to justice in the preceding section will without doubt introduce an ample harvest for men of the law but it is better that they should live by litigiousness than that the people should perish by tyranny The objection rising from this circumstance must therefore vanish in the utility of the thing and another objection just as obvious may be as easily removed It  may be thought impolitic by some that any part of the judicial authority should remain in the hands of the natives But this is objected in vain The officers of justice as well as being subject to a revision of their decrees to the British derive from them their own power and the people by being left in possession of some of their laws and usages will be flattered into an inviolable submission to our government  ought to be lest entire  Though the inhabitants of Bengal are from their natural disposition prepared to submit to any system of government founded upon justice there are some laws of their own which absolute power itself must not violate The regulations with regard to their women and religion must never be touched and upon mature consideration the Author of the Enquiry is of opinion that many other ancient institutions might be left entire There are however particular usages established by time into a law which our humanity must destroy No pecuniary compensation must be permitted for murder no theft be punished by cutting off the hand Let the Mahommedan laws still in force against the Hindoos be abrogated let no women burn themselves with their husbands no dying person be exposed by his friends  to the natives  To leave the natives entirely to their own laws would be to consign them to anarchy and confusion The inhabitants of Bengal are divided into two religious sects the Mahommedan and Hindoo almost equal in point of numbers Averse beyond measure to one another both on account of religion and the memory of mutual injuries the one party will not now submit to the laws of the other and the dissention which subsists between individuals would without a pressure from another power spread in a flame over the whole kingdom It is therefore absolutely necessary for the peace and prosperity of the country that the laws of England in so far as they do not oppose prejudices and usages which cannot be relinquished by the natives should prevail The measure besides its equity is calculated to preserve that influence which conquerors must possess to retain their power  Expence of  The expence of the judicial establishment is but trivial if compared to the advantages which the kingdom of Bengal must derive from such a necessary institution The judges in every country should be placed in affluence in Bengal they ought to derive a fortune from the labour of some years The natives of a northern climate settle not for life in the torrid zone they always place the prospect of returning with wealth to their friends  among their great inducements for venturing to cross the ocean The following table presents an estimate of the annual expence of justice in Bengal  The Supreme Court of Bengal  One chief justice  the supreme  £    Three  puisné  justices    One attorney general    One register    Two Cazis and two Brahmins to attend the court    Contingencies       £    the provincial  The four provincial courts of appeal consisting of the Company's servants     Four counsellors as presidents  £    Twelve assessors    One provincial attorney in each    One register in each    One Cazi and one Brahmin in each    Contingencies in all       £    and Cutcherri courts  Fifty courts of Cutcherri     Fifty presidents being servants of the Company  £  Two hundred assessors    Fifty registers    Fifty Clerks       £     £  Observation  The above calculation it is hoped will not be thought extravagant for dispensing justice to fifteen millions of people The salaries of the members of the boards of revenue and of these as forming courts of exchequer are not mentioned as the Company is supposed to pay its own servants with certain sums and lucrative privileges for the whole of their trouble The Shiechdârs the Cutwâls and the Muckuddums have no salaries the influence and distinction which they shall derive from their employments being a sufficient reward for their toil  General Reflections on the Plan  Reflections on the  PROPERTY being once established and the forms of justice to protect it delineated public prosperity is placed on a solid foundation But the love of money which generall prevails renders the most of mankind more anxious to possess present profit than to look forward to future advantage The plan which we have laid down in the preceding sections will begin to yield an apparent benefit from its commencement at the same time that the tide will become the more rapid the longer it flows  Immediate  The immediate pecuniary advantages which will rise to Bengal are to be derived from various sources The removal of the emperor either to Patna or Mongeer will save to the kingdom his pension of three hundred and twentyfive thousand pounds the revenues of the territory of Bulwant Singh three hundred and twelve thousand five hundred pounds to be spent in Bengal and fifty thousand pounds which is now sent abroad without hopes of return to pay three battalions of our troops stationed at Allahabâd This sum of six hundred and eightyseven thousand pounds thrown at once into the circulation would animate the languid  pulse of commerce and at once prepare the kingdom for the commercial improvements which the plan in its other regulations seems absolutely to ensure  and future advantages  The future advantages arise also from various springs The influx of specie and inhabitants which the sale of the waste as well as of the cultivated lands would draw from all the other provinces of Hindostan would be productive of immediate national wealth The advancement of agriculture would promote the advancement of manufactures The peace of the country would be secured from abroad and justice by prevailing at home would attach the natives to a government on the stability of which the possession of their landed property depended The establishment of a paper currency on national faith and the Company's security would enable mankind to bring all their property into action lower the exorbitant interest of money and render Bengal in the space of a few years the most commercial the most flourishing and the most wealthy kingdom of its extent in Asia  to be derived from the plan  The Company in the midst of the prosperity of the subject would amazingly thrive in their affairs A sum not less than ten millions independent of their revenue would in the space of four years flow from the first sales of  the land into their coffers The improvement of their present revenue would join issue with its future certainty and permanency A large annual sum would arise from a thorough examination of tenures and from imposts already laid upon fairs markets entrance into great towns shops magazines of grain fees upon marriages tolls collected at ferries licences for exercising trades groundrent of houses which though at present paid by the public have never been brought to account by Mahommed Riza and the general farmers These articles at the lowest average might amount to the annual sum of four hundred thousand pounds Five hundred thousand pounds would yearly be saved in pensions and on the charge of collection besides the immense encrease in the revenues which would most certainly be derived from the growing prosperity of the kingdom  Concluding  The absolute establishment of property without which written law seems superfluous to society is as has been observed the foundation upon which national prosperity is laid Regulations which stop short of this primary object are only temporary expedients which may for a time alleviate the pain of the distemper but it can never cure A tacit acquiescence in the right of possession of the natives the prevention of  some part of the present national waste a mild despotism which we may dignify with the name of Justice will have an immediate good effect but the advantage is limited partial and transient and the Author of the Enquiry will venture to affirm that unless something similar to what has been in the preceding sections proposed is adopted Bengal will in the course of a few years decline into a shadow and vanish from our hands  reflection  Miracles are not to be expected in this age and without them in the absence of a bold and determined exertion the boasted fruits of our victories in the East will wither with our laurels A kingdom lying under all the disadvantages of a foreign conquest which without return deprives it of one million and an half of its annual industry must sink under the weight unless it is placed on a better footing than the surrounding countries which pay no tribute Let our justice to our own subjects let the advantages of our regulations entice foreigners with their wealth to settle among us let us without the sword appropriate the wealth of India by our policy otherwise the stream which slows into Great Britain will soon become dry The lake which feeds it has already disappeared from the banks Temporary regulations may dazzle with their immediate  effect but a permanent plan which in its wide circle comprehends futurity will preserve the vigour and health of Bengal to the verge of that political death to which all empires seem to be subjected by Fate  Concluding Reflections  Present  ARGUMENTS deduced from general principles however obvious they may appear strike not the bulk of mankind so forcibly as facts The revenues of Bengal without including the Jagieers amounted in the year to near three millions and six hundred thousand pounds of our money The charges of collection the Nabob's government pensions civil military and marine expences being deducted there remained a balance of one million three hundred thousand pounds for the Company The expences have since been encreasing yearly and the revenues decreasing Both were hastening to that middle point which would balance the accounts of the British nation with the fortune of their arms in the East  ruinous state  To conceal this decrease as much as possible men fell on a very shallow and poor expedient The servants of the Company protracted the time of closing  the accounts to make up the usual sum and by these means an encroachment of five months was by degrees made upon the succeeding year To understand this circumstance it is necessary to observe that the collections are not fixed to a particular term They are continued without intermission and the produce of the five months which may amount to one million five hundred thousand pounds must be deducted from the accounts made up since the Dewanny was submitted to our management  of the revenue  Notwithstanding this deception it was not the only deficiency in the state of money affairs The revenues of the year had besides fallen short five hundred thousand pounds and what further reduction the famine which ensued may have made time can only demonstrate By the best accounts from Bengal there was not a balance of five hundred thousand pounds remaining after all expences were paid and this was not above half the sum necessary to purchase the annual investments of the Company No fair conclusion however can be drawn from the produce of one year and the vigilance of the Court of Directors has since established some beneficial regulations To flatter the sanguine we will suppose that the net balance will amount on the present sooting to one million The  sum is just sufficient for the investments of the Company without leaving a single farthing in the treasury to answer any extraordinary emergency  Obvious  The advantages of the proposed plan are obvious and therefore easily explained Let it be supposed that the rentroll of the year shall be taken as the rule of the quitrent to be paid after the sale of the lands Let none think this sum too much Under the management of the proprietors the lands would in a few years produce thrice the sum of three millions six hundred thousand pounds but the subject must receive a bride for his industry The Company at present complain that the Talookdârs or those who possess lands in property run away with all the tenants Their estates are flourishing whilst our limited policy of letting the lands by the year has created solitudes around After a thorough examination of fictitious tenures private encroachments and public embezzlements we may with great propriety venture to add at least one million to the above sum But to speak with a moderation which precludes reply we shall only take it for granted that four hundred thousand pounds are by these means only gained Even this sum will fix the annual revenue at four millions and there let it rest till the prosperity of the country shall authorise an encrease by slight imposts on trade and the articles of consumption  Advantages  The abolition of the tyrannical and impolitic government of the Nabob will be a saving of five hundred thousand pounds on the annual expences The fact is notorious that the real expence of this secondary and intermediate government in pensions and in the mode of collection exceeds six hundred thousand pounds but the judicial and fiscal systems established in the preceding plan will not exceed one hundred thousand pounds with all the advantages of a salutary and equitable administration of justice and law To this sum we may add the five hundred thousand pounds which have fallen off from the revenue as the firstfruits of the plan all which supposing the expences of the civil military and marine departments to remain as at present would make an annual difference of one million four hundred thousand pounds in favour of the Company The investments of the Company might in that case be increased yet leave a sum for the treasury in Calcutta for emergencies  of the proceding  The treasury however ought not to be too rich lest circulation should deaden in the kingdom Two millions in specie would be sufficient To employ the surplus to advantage together with the ten millions which are supposed to arise from the sale of the lands a bank ought to be established for the purpose of lending out sums of money not exceeding three years purchase on landed security to the Proprietors at the interest of seven per centum The landholders would be by these  means enabled to raise the necessary sums at less than half the interest which they now pay and the Company would have good security for their advances Let us suppose that in the course of a few years ten millions were lent upon these terms that sum would produce an annual interest of seven hundred thousand pounds which upon the whole plan makes a yearly balance in favour of the Company of TWO MILLIONS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS MORE THAN THEY AT PRESENT RECEIVE exclusive of a PRODIGIOUS and GROWING TREASURE and the moderate imposts which may be hereafter laid on articles of luxury  Plan  The Plan to speak the least its favour is practicable in its great and general line It would produce even partially followed immense sudden and permanent advantages but no human foresight can absolutely estimate the precise sums Though the Author of the Enquiry has not the vanity to suppose that his scheme is in all its branches infallible he will venture to pledge himself to his country that should the more material parts of his system be adopted the advantages to be derived from it would not fall short of his calculations His knowledge of the kingdom of Bengal and its various resources gives him a confidence on this subject to which he is not intitled by his abilities

Timur on the throne and established tranquillity over all their vast conquests in India Vigorous in his measures without tyranny he impressed the minds of men with awe and checked that spirit of discord and private ambition which had prevailed in more feeble reigns Government becoming settled and uniform in its regulations the arts of civil life began to increase and flourish among a people naturally industrious and ingenious The splendor of the court the wealth of individuals created a  general taste for pomp and magnificence and the crowded levees of the great where all endeavoured to excel in the art of pleasing rendered the Indians equal in politeness to the nations of Europe Learning was not unknown if we exclude the abstruse sciences The Arabian and Brahmin systems of philosophy were studied and the powers of the mind were generally cultivated and improved  observations  This character of civilization it must be confessed tallies not with the political conduct of the people But necessity and selfpreservation make a kind of apology for crimes under despotism which would be unpardonable in a community governed by general and known laws In states subject to arbitrary government there is no security no honour no independence in private life The nation is divided into two sorts of people the oppressors and the oppressed Every man of spirit of family and of fortune must in selfdefence endeavour to possess a share of the government under which he was born When he starts forth from obscurity he must adopt the political principles of his country or be ruined in all his schemes however repugnant these principles may be to the general dictates of humanity and the particular disposition of his own mind The greatest virtues therefore are often blended with the worst vices and this circumstance gives a variety and strength of feature to Asiatic characters unknown in the settled governments of the west  Extent and revenues of the empire  Though the empire of the Mahommedans in India was not so extensive under Akbar as it had been under some princes of the Patan Dynasty it comprehended a vast tract of country divided into twentytwo provinces each equal to some kingdoms in wealth fertility and extent  Kandahar Ghizni Cabal Cashmire Lahore Moultain Outch Sindi Ajmere Sirhind Delhi Duâb Agra Allahabad Oud Behâr Bengal Orissa Malava Berâr Chandeish Guzerat  A small part only of the Decan or sourthern peninsula of India had been conquered  yet the dominions of the family of Timur in their northern and southern frontiers fell under the thirtysixth and ninetenth parallels of latitude and they extended themselves from east to west about twentyfive degrees The revenues according to the Imperial register were thirtytwo millions sterling received in the exchequer exclusive of the customary presents and the estates of the officers of the crown which at their death reverted to the emperor and amounted at a mediùm to twenty millions more of our money These immense sums were expended in maintaining an army of three hundred thousand horse as many of foot in support of the splendor of the court and in the salaries of civil officers  Intrigues against Sultan Selim  When the indisposition of the emperor Akbar rendered him incapable of attending to public business the whole weight of government fell on Chan Azim the Visier Selim Akbar's only surviving son notwithstanding the disputes which he had formerly with his father was still looked upon as the heir of the empire But the Visier's daughter being married to Chusero the eldest son of Selim that minister was desirous of placing the reins of government in the hands of his soninlaw He was supported in this scheme by many of the nobles the most enterprizing and powerful of whom was Raja Man Singh whose sister was the mother of Chusero The Raja from the antiquity of his family and his own address commanded all the Hindoo interest in the empire and he had at that very time twenty thousand of his native subjects of the Rajaput tribe in and near the environs of the capital prepared to execute his orders Selim being apprized of the powerful confederacy against him waited upon his father Akbar two days before his death and laid before him all their schemes The emperor called them to his presence reprimanded them severely and having publicly acknowledged Selim his lawful  successor in the empire obliged the confederate lords to pay him homage and to promise to support his title  His accession to the throne  On the sixteenth of the second Jemmâd in the year of the Higera one thousand and fourteen the illustrious Akbar expired at Agra amid the tears of his subjects who loved him as their father admired him as their leader and feared him as their prince The promise extorted by the emperor from the Visier and Man Singh in favour of Selim had no effect on their conduct He was no sooner dead than they assembled their party in the house of the former and renewed their deliberations in favour of Chusero in prejudice of his father Selim in the mean time was not idle He convened all his friends in his own palace Things remained in suspense for some hours Ferid Bochari who commanded the cityguards took at length a spirited resolution He ordered the gates to be shut to prevent any troops from entering the city and taking the keys in his hand hastened to the palace of Selim He presented them on his knees and saluted him emperor All present followed his example The news soon reached the house of the Visier The party of Chusero was struck with a sudden panic They broke up from council and made all possible haste to pay their respects to the new sovereign The Visier took care not to be the last The hopes of Chusero were dashed in a moment He was seized with fear and fled down the river in a small canoe with Raja Man Singh and concealed himself in that prince's house till he obtained a pardon from his father Ferid for this signal service was advanced to the rank of paymastergeneral of the forces by the title of Murtaza Chan and many other distinguishing honours were at the same time conferred upon him  His titles and age  Selim was born at Sikri near Agra on Wednesday the seventeenth of the second Ribbi in the nine hundredth and seventyseventh  year of the Higera The most remarkable event of Selim's life before his accession was his disobedience to his father's orders rather than his rebellion against him about two years prior to that monarch's death Insolent at first he refused to return to his duty and was once actually at the head of seventy thousand men Upon the death of the prince Daniâl he however submitted having then a nearer prospect of the throne Akbar having upbraided him for his disobedience at first and his pusillanimity afterwards for throwing himself upon an enraged sovereign's mercy when he was at the head of a great army received him into favour When Selim took the reins of government in his hands he assumed the titles of Nooruldien Mahommed JEHANGIRE or Mahommed the Light of the Faith and CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD He dated the commencement of his reign from the twentieth of the second Jemmâd which answers to the st of October being then in the thirtyseventh year of his age Akbar was interred with great pomp at Secundra near Agra and the minds of men were distracted between grief and joy funeral solemnity and the festivity attending upon the accession of a new sovereign  His prudent and wise administration  Chan Azim the discontented Visier and the Raja Man Singh were so formidable in the empire that Jehangire thought it most prudent to accept of the offered allegiance of both and to confirm them in their respective honours and governments without animadversion upon their late conduct Man Singh was dispatched to his subaship of Bengal Chan Azim to that of Malava The prince Chusero made his appearance at court and his father after a severe reprimand took him at last into favour The emperor in the mean time began his reign by a strict administration of justice and by a minute inspection into the finances and resources of the state He issued a public edict to confirm all the  laws and regulations in force Many subas were removed from their respective governments into other provinces some were dismissed to make room for the emperor's abettors and friends The deprived governors repaired to court to restore themselves by money and intrigue to their former dignities Some succeeded in their views others were reduced to despair through want of success The latter began to form treasonable designs to recover the consequence and power which they had lost  A conspiracy in favour of his son Chusero  To accomplish their purpose the discontented lords turned their eyes upon Chusero and hoped by his means to effect a revolution in the state They pretended to have the greatest attachment to his person they magnified the number of his friends and his own merit They rouzed his ambition by the praise of past actions and animated it by the fair prospect of present success But what had most weight with the prince they intimidated him with pretended discoveries of the designs of his father against his life The secrecy necessary to be observed in all arduous undertakings against despotic governments rendered it difficult for Chusero to know the true state of things The spies whom the emperor had placed around him in the mean time increased and confirmed his fears Ambition aided by timidity at length prevailed over filial duty He plunged therefore into danger to take immediate possession of a throne which he was born one day to mount without the doubtful fortune of the sword  who rejects a proposal of assassination  Chan Azim and the Raja Man Singh had the address not to appear openly in the conspiracy They were however known to be the life and support of the whole They were still under the cloud of the emperor's displeasure which at a convenient season might burst on their heads The prince being so far involved in the plot it would be dangerous for him to recede and they  justly considering the improbability of success by open force against the Imperial power proposed the more speedy expedient of assassinating Jehangire The proposal came to the ears of the prince Though he was bent upon rebellion he startled at parricide Nature was rouzed in his breast  "My father" said he "may enjoy life without a throne but I can never enjoy a throne stained with a father's blood Let him try the fortune of the field Let us throw away the daggers of assassins and owe our advancement to our swords"  The plot discovered  The conspirators pretended to applaud the noble sentiments of the prince but they from that instant were irresolute and embarrassed in their councils Many violent at the beginning now awed by the greatness of the undertaking shrunk back from their purpose and began to shelter themselves behind one another The emperor in the mean time was in part informed of the plot He prepared to seize the prince the latter was apprized of his father's designs By a premature discovery this conspiracy like many of the same kind failed Fear took possession of the adherents of Chusero He himself was afraid They neglected to execute the daring stroke which their situation and safety required They began to remove themselves from immediate danger as if the present were more to be feared than those which in future they had to oppose They however did not altogether relinquish their designs  First rising  On Monday the eight of Zehidge six months after the accession of Jehangire to the throne of India near one hundred of the conspirators assembled privately in the evening at the tomb of the emperor Akbar Chusero having joined them on pretence of paying his devotions at his grandfather's shrine they proceeded that very night toward Delhi About daybreak next morning they had reached the city of Muttra about thirtyeight miles from  Agra and entered the town when the troops who garrisoned the place were on the parade They halted for refreshment and they had the good fortune not to be suspected by the officer who commanded at Muttra Hussein Beg Chan Buduchshi who had been governor of the province of Cabul during a considerable part of the former reign being turned out of his office by the emperor was on his way to court Having travelled in the night on account of the heat of the weather he happened to enter the city of Muttra at the opposite gate just when the prince arrived They met in the marketplace Chusero was no stranger to the discontent of Hussein and esteeming him a great acquisition to his party from his known bravery and popularity among the Tartars who formed a great part of the imperial army he called him aside and having sounded him laid open his whole plan Hussein being conscious of no crime against the state thought himself highly injured by Jehangire Possessed of no property but the sword from the generosity of his disposition which had lavished his fortune upon his friends he required not much intreaty to espouse the cause of the prince  Chusero marches to Delhi  The retinue of Hussein was but small It consisted of two hundred Tartar horse and three hundred Afgan foot But his military fame was great and he gave life to the conspiracy The prince endeavoured to bring over the governor of Muttra to his party That officer perceiving his intentions shut himself up in the citadel and would listen to no terms Chusero had neither time nor force to reduce him He contented himself with enlisting as many as he could of the inhabitants and garrison into his service and leaving Muttra continued his route to Delhi  Ravages the country  The road between the two great cities of Delhi and Agra being crowded with travellers and detachments of horse and foot going  on different services the prince forced them to join his standard Those who refused were without mercy put to the sword after being plundered of all their effects Small parties of horse were at the same time dispersed through the country on every side and such as did not immediately take up arms in favour of Chusero were submitted to military execution and all the severities of war Many were compelled to join him through fear Others from the same cause fled into the woods and saw from their retreats the smoke of their burning houses and mourned over their infants and aged parents who had not strength to avoid the flames Some more resolute defended themselves against the rebels and to their valour owed their lives The orders of the prince it must be owned did not extend to such rigour and cruelty But he found it impossible to restrain from excesses his undisciplined soldiers He had set them an example of wickedness by rebellion and it was not to be expected that they would submit to his commands in favour of humanity and justice  Lays the suburbs of Delhi under contributions  Such was the wasteful progress of Chusero to Delhi His followers having greatly increased their numbers in the march he laid the suburbs of that capital under contribution The gates being shut the city itself was preserved from pillage The unfortunate people who lived without the walls from their delay in raising the sum imposed upon them had their houses consumed with fire Many thousands were ruined Many to retrieve their affairs joined the rebels to make reprisals upon the world for the loss which they had sustained  The emperor pursues Chusero  At eleven o'clock of the same night on which Chusero left Agra his father was informed of his flight by the captaingeneral who was ordered to pursue immediately the fugitive About an hour  after this officer's departure with a considerable body of horse the emperor suspecting his loyalty dispatched his commands to him to return Ferid Bochari lately raised to the dignity of Murtaza Chan and to the office of paymastergeneral of the forces was dispatched upon that service with an additional number of troops The whole under Ferid amounted to ten thousand horse which greatly retarded his march Chusero of course had the more time to harass the country and to strengthen himself In the morning as soon as daylight appeared the emperor mounted his horse and having assembled all the forces in and near Agra leaving a sufficient garrison in the place marched with a great army toward Delhi He was upon the occasion heard to repeat a verse which implied  "That fortune depended upon expedition more than on counsel and that his life should be darkened who put off till tomorrow what ought to be done today"  The undutiful behaviour of a son whom he loved was a severe stroke to his mind He refused to eat or drink or to take rest for some time and even opium to which he was much addicted he declined  who takes the route of Lahore  The governor and inhabitants of Delhi having recovered from the first impressions which the sudden arrival and ravages committed by Chusero had made upon their minds prepared for a resolute defence Some troops who were stationed in different parts of the country had thrown themselves into the town As there was a considerable quantity of the Imperial treasure lodged in the city as well as the great wealth of private persons the intentions of the prince were to have surprized Delhi and to furnish himself with money sufficient to raise an army in the province of Punjab But the general terror which his rapacity had excited carried the news of his march before him and disappointed his designs Despairing of being able to force Delhi to surrender  before the arrival of the Imperial army having remained only two days in the suburbs Chusero took the route of Lahore Having been on his march joined by a great number of men he attempted immediately upon his arrival to take that city by escalade He was repulsed with some loss by the garrison and being at the same time destitute of artillery he was greatly disconcerted in his measures He however invested the place  He is deseated by Ferid Bochari  The Imperial troops stationed in the province threw themselves into Lahore They sallied out on the besiegers nine successive days but they were as often repulsed and obliged to shelter themselves behind their walls Chusero in the mean time had drawn together some artillery from small fortresses in the neighbourhood which he had found means to surprise Nothing could be effected against the place before the arrival of Ferid the paymastergeneral with the emperor's advanced guard The prince with an army of thirty thousand horse and foot but without order without discipline marched out of his camp to give battle to Ferid The garrison of Lahore perceiving his motions fell upon his rear He left a part of his army to oppose them With the remaining part he attacked Ferid His troops behaved better than their discipline seemed to promise He exposed his own person He was at length deserted and pressing among the thickest of the enemy he found himself with only a few of his principal adherents who bravely fought by his side In this situation he was surrounded by the Imperialists on every side He was personally known to them all They were tender of his life and in attempting to take him prisoner they permitted him to make his escape Great honours were conferred upon Ferid by the emperor on account of this signal victory  Fluctuating counsels of his adherents  The unfortunate Chusero wandered all night through the woods with a few attendants His army was all dispersed He came in  the morning to a hut where quite overcome by fatigue he laid himself down to rest Some of his friends having discovered where he lay assembled around him They began to consult together on the present untoward situation of their affairs They differed in opinion Such of the chiefs as were natives of Bengal and the adjacent provinces insisted upon taking the route of that quarter of India by the foot of the northern mountains they alleged that the Raja Man Singh who was then suba of Bengal possessed great power which he would not fail to exert in his nephew's cause  It was customary with the Mahommedan emperors of Hindostan to demand the daughters of Hindoo princes in marriage The mother of Chusero was sister to the Raja Man Singh  that the country was rich and populous that it was an invariable maxim among the Hindoo princes never to desert the interest of a stranger who should throw himself under their protection Besides that the Raja Man Singh joined the affection of a relation to the prince to the natural faith of his nation to the suppliant and unfortunate The natives of Chandeish and Malava were for trying their fortunes in their respective provinces Chan Azim the late Visier fatherinlaw of Chusero was governor of the latter and they doubted not but he would support the dignity of his own family They added that Azim was possessed of a fine army provided with artillery and furnished with stores  They disperse  Hussein Beg who was in chief confidence with the prince started objections to the different plans of his other adherents He urged the distance of the march and the impossibility of forcing their way through countries full of Imperial troops who would be very active since Fortune had forsaken the side of Chusero He proposed that they should continue their route to Cabul where he himself had interest sufficient to arm the whole province together with his native country Buduchshân in favour of the prince  Chusero during the debate sat silent Having at length weighed each opinion he declared in favour of that of Hussein alleging that the troops of the north were most faithful to their chiefs The observation displeased the other chiefs they murmured and left his presence They saw that their affairs were desperate and they resolved to retreat to their respective habitations covering their fears under a pretended disgust at the preference given to the counsel of Hussein  He arrives on the banks of of the Attoc  Chusero in a few minutes found himself deserted by those who had made him the tool of their ambition and revenge Reproaches were to no effect He blamed his adherents for their timidity and perfidy but he himself was not less culpable His mind was agitated with various passions Rage against his own folly was the most predominant Hussein was the only chief of note who remained of the conspirators His followers consisting of three hundred horse and a few of the prince's menial servants formed their whole retinue With these they set out for Cabul Being forced to depart from the high road they frequently lost their way as they were obliged to travel in the night  where for want of boats  Keeping their course through unfrequented paths and byroads they at length arrived on the banks of the river Attoc the largest branch of the Indus It was impassable without boats It was then midnight They moved down the river to the ferry of Choudera Finding no boats at that place though a much frequented passage they understood that orders had been sent to conceal them The ferryman and villagers were asleep It was proposed to seize them to force them to discover where the boats were laid Some were taken in their beds others escaped and with their outcries alarmed the country The prince understood from those that were taken that orders from the Imperial camp had two days before been received by the zemindâr of the district to stop the  passage of the river and that in obedience to these orders he had secreted the boats Hussein in the mean time having dispatched some of his followers in quest of the boats they found two filled with wood in a neighbouring creek These were unloaded and brought to the proper place The zemindâr being rouzed from sleep by the noise had come by this time to the banks of the Attoc attended by a concourse of people He called to those who dragged the boats that he had an Imperial mandate to prohibit all persons under pain of death to cross the river They intimidated by his threats turned the head of the two boats across the stream The prince's party fired upon them some were killed others plunged into the river and a few expert swimmers in the retinue of Chusero brought one boat with difficulty to the shore  he is in great distress  The banks of the Attoc were in the mean time crowded with the country people An officer arrived with a hundred horse to guard the passage Other detachments came gradually in from every quarter Chusero and Hussein resolved to save themselves in the boat They placed their horses in the center and they themselves took their seats in the stern Their attendants afraid of being left to the mercy of their enemies threw themselves headlong into the vessel and almost sunk her They however pushed her from shore threw some overboard and cut off the hands of others who clung to her sides Many were drowned A few slain by the Imperialists This was but the beginning of misfortunes Most of the oars had been lost in the confusion and the rudder to complete the ruin of the unfortunate Chusero had been inadvertently thrown overboard with the wood with which the boat had been found loaded These inconveniences joined to a want of skill in the rowers rendered it impossible for them to manage the boat She was carried down the stream The confusion was great and danger every moment increased  He is taken prisoner  The zemindâr and the party who guarded the ferry were not idle They seized upon those left ashore They fired at the boat and followed her down the river She struck at last on a sandbank Some plunged into the water to push her off she remained immoveable The fire continued Many were killed No resource was left The sun was just rising Casim Chan who commanded the party of horse seeing the unfortunate prince in this unextricable situation stopt the fire Being by this time joined by another officer who commanded a body of troops in the neighbourhood both mounted their elephants and riding in to the bank on which the boat lay seized the prince Casim placed him behind him on the elephant while the other officer secured Hussein The few that remained of their attendants were carried ashore in another boat  His behaviour before his father  Such was the end of a rebellion begun without any just cause concerted without judgment and carried on with very moderate abilities by a prince scarce more unfortunate than he deserved to be The emperor was at the time encamped in a garden near Lahore He received the news of the seizure of the prince with excessive joy He ordered him to be brought before him with a golden chain from his left hand to his left foot according to the laws of his ancestors Zingis and Timur Hussein loaded with iron chains was placed on the right hand of Chusero Abdul Rahim another of the principal rebels on his left Jehangire sternly asked his son  "What could induce thee Sultan Chusero to rebel against thy sovereign and father"  Chusero was silent the emperor began to relent He then in a soster tone questioned him about his advisers and abettors in rebellion Chusero burst into tears His father was surprized for till then he had remained firm  "Father" said the prince with a broken voice "my crime is great but let me suffer for it alone When you  accused me I was sensible of my faults and as I was reconciled with the loss of life I behaved with dignity But when you raise the remembrance of my friends I am troubled at their fate Let them escape as they can I will never become their accuser"  Execution of his adherents  Jehangire stood silent and by his pressing him no farther seemed to applaud his sentiments Any information from the prince would be unnecessary The conspirators had impeached one another and three hundred of the chiefs were already seized The prince was delivered over in close confinement into the hands of the paymastergeneral Hussein was sentenced to be sewed up in the raw hide of an ox and to be thrown in that condition into the street The hide was soon contracted by the heat of the sun and he expired in a few hours Abdul Rahim did not so easily escape Finding that Hussein was dead sooner than they expected those appointed to superintend the executions kept the ass's hide in which Rahim was inclosed constantly moist with water He lived for several days in that miserable condition Three hundred pales in the mean time were set up in two rows along the public road The rebels to that number were drawn alive on the pales Chusero was brought every day as long as any of the unhappy wretches breathed under their tortures to view the horrid sight He was led in chains through the midst of them whilst he watered the ground with his tears Some of them had been his dearest companions others his faithful servants who had followed his fortunes merely to shew their fidelity to a master whom they loved  Candahar invested by the Persians  These barbarous executions were scarce over at Lahore when news was brought to the Imperial camp that the Persians had invested Candahar with a numerous army that Shaw Beg the governor of that city and province had by his rashness suffered  a very considerable loss in a sally yet that he continued without any necessity to expose the garrison His conduct could only be accounted for by an absurdity bordering on madness He was as careless of his own life as he was of his duty Dissolute beyond example he ordered an awning to be spread over the gateway most exposed to the enemy's fire He sat under it all day conversing with common prostitutes whom much against their inclination he forced to attend him The emperor fearing more from his negligence and debauchery than he hoped from his fidelity and courage sent Sirdir Chan an old Omrah to supersede him in his government with orders to defend Candahar to the last extremity Ghazi Chan an officer of great reputation was at the same time dispatched with twentyfive thousand horse to harass the enemy Jehangire himself with the remaining part of the Imperial army marched to Cabul  The siege raised  Ghazi had scarce advanced within six days march of Candahar when the Persians raised the siege and retreated towards Chorassan No reason could be assigned for these hostilities on the side of Persia except the favourable opportunity offered by the rebellion of Chusero for seizing the city of Candahar which was in some measure the key to the Persian empire Shaw Abas of Persia pretended that his lieutenants in the provinces of Seistan and Chorassan had taken this step without his orders and that it was his positive commands which raised the siege  A peace with Persia  Jehangire placed little faith in the professions of Abas being satisfied that the death of Akbar and the rebellion of Chusero were the true motives of the invasion He however admitted the excuses of the Persian which were brought by his ambassador Hussein Several small forts near Candahar which had been taken by the Persians were evacuated and peace between the two  formidable powers was reestablished Shaw Beg deprived of the government of Candahar was made Suba of Cabul for notwithstanding his absurd behaviour he had displayed both ability and spirit in the defence of the city The emperor after these transactions returned toward Lahore  A conspiracy  Sultan Chusero was still in close consinement which his active and vehement disposition could very ill endure The usage he met with deprived him of every hope of a reconciliation with his father The marks of assection shewn by the emperor to his younger sens Purvez and Churrum confirmed the suspicions of Chuscro It was also currently reported that Jehangire was to appoint one of the two favoured princes his successor Nothing but disappointment and even death presented to Chusero's mind His friends were still numerous in the army He sounded them by his emissaries some moved by his misfortunes many in love with novelty began to form treasonable designs against the emperor's life It was concerted to fall upon Jehangire at the chace and having dispatched him to raise Chusero from his prison to the throne  Discovered  Some writers doubt whether Chusero was at all privy to this conspiracy others deny the whole The first argue from the humanity of Chusero the latter say that it was a siction of Sultan Churrum third son of Jehangire This much is certain that the first intelligence of the conspiracy came through prince Churrum to the emperor's ears He informed his father that five hundred of the nobility were engaged in a plot against his life Jehangire was slartled and knew not how to act he considered that should he seize some the rest would be alarmed and that danger might arise from their power As it was difficult therefore to secure them all at once he thought it most  prudent to send all on different services Four of the principals he reserved whom he ordered to be seized They were tried for treason sufficient proofs could not be found They were kept in consinement Chusero was more narrowly watched and became daily more and more obnoxious to his father  CHAP II  Disturbances in BengalStory of Chaja AiassHis slight from TartaryDistress in the desartBirth of the Sultana NoorMâhilMarriage with Shere

Indus marched toward the capital When he was crossing the Attoe letters were received from Islam Chan governor of Behâr with intelligence that Shere Afkun a native of Turkomania who commanded in the district of Burdwan had with his own hand killed Kuttubuldien Ko  a Suba of Bengal together with several other o  cers who had set upon Shere Afkun with an intention to assassinate him Jehangire was much afflicted at the death of his favourite Kuttub but he derived some comfort from the Suba's success against the life of Shere Afkun The circumstances of the unhappy fate of this chief are in themselves extraordinary and the knowledge of them is necessary for clucidating the sequel of the history of Jehangire To trace things to their source we must for some time lose sight of the unfortunate Shere  Story of Chaja Aiass  About twenty years before this period Chaja Aiass a native of the western Tartary left that country to push his fortune in Hindostan He was descended of an ancient and noble family fallen into decay by various revolutions of fortune He however had received a good education which was all his parents could bestow Falling in love with a young woman as poor as himself he married her but he found it difficult to provide for her the very necessaries of life Reduced to the last extremity he turned his thoughts upon India the usual resource of the needy Tartars of the north He left privately friends who either would not or could not assist him and turned his face to a foreign country His all consisted of one sorry horse and a very small sum of money which had proceeded from the sale of his other effects Placing his wife upon the horse he walked by her side She happened to be with child and could ill endure the fatigue of so great a journey Their scanty pittance of money was soon expended they had even subsisted for some days upon charity when they arrived on the skirts of the Great Solitudes which separate Tartary from the dominions of the family of Timur in India No house was there to cover them from the inclemency of the weather no hand to relieve their wants To return was certain misery to proceed apparent destruction  His distress  They had fasted three days to complete their misfortunes the wife of Aiass was taken in labour She began to reproach her husband for leaving his native country at an unfortunate hour for exchanging a quiet though poor life for the ideal prospect of wealth in a distant country In this distressed situation she brought forth a daughter They remained in the place for some hours with a vain hope that travellers might pass that way They were disappointed Human feet seldom tread these desarts the sun declined apace They feared the approach of night the  place was the haunt of wild beasts and should they escape their hunger they must fall by their own Chaja Aiass in this extremity having placed his wife on the horse found himself so much exhausted that he could scarcely move To carry the child was impossible the mother could not even hold herself fast on the horse A long contest began between Humanity and Necessity the latter prevailed and they agreed to expose the child on the highway The infant covered with leaves was placed under a tree and the disconsolate parents proceeded in tears  in the desart  When they had advanced about a mile from the place and the eyes of the mother could no longer distinguish the solitary tree under which she had left her daughter she gave way to grief and throwing herself from the horse on the ground exclaimed  "My child my child"  She endeavoured to raise herself but she had no strength to return Aiass was pierced to the heart He prevailed upon his wife to sit down He promised to bring her the infant He arrived at the place No sooner had his eyes reached the child than he was almost struck dead with horror A black snake say our authors was coiled around it and Aiass believed he beheld him extending his fatal jaws to devour the infant The father rushed forward The serpent alarmed at his vociferation retired into the hollow tree He took up his daughter unhurt and returned to the mother He gave her child into her arms and as he was informing her of the wonderful escape of the infant some travellers appeared and soon relieved them of all their wants They proceeded gradually and came to Lahore  His arrival and good fortune at Lahore  The emperor Akbar at the arrival of Aiass kept his court at Lahore Asiph Chan one of that monarch's principal Omrahs attended then the presence He was a distant relation to Aiass  and he received him with attention and friendship To employ him he made him his own secretary Aiass soon recommended himself to Asiph in that station and by some accident his diligence and ability attracted the notice of the emperor who raised him to the command of a thousand horse He become in process of time master of the household and his genius being still greater than even his good fortune he raised himself to the office and title of ActimâdulDowla or high treasurer of the empire Thus he who had almost perished through mere want in the desert became in the space of a few years the first subject in India  Character of his daughter MherulNissa  The daughter who had been born to Aiass in the desert received soon after his arrival at Lahore the name of MherulNissa or the Sun of Women She had some right to the appellation for in beauty she excelled all the ladies of the East She was educated with the utmost care and attention In musie in dancing in poetry in painting she had no equal among her sex Her disposition was volatile her wit lively and satirical her spirit lofty and uncontrouled Selim the princeroyal visited one day her father When the public entertainment was over when all except the principal guests were withdrawn and wine was brought on the table the ladies according to custom were introduced in their veils  She capti  Sultan    The ambition of MherulNissa aspired to a conquest of the prince She sunghe was in raptures she dancedhe could hardly be restrained by the rules of decency to his place Her stature her shape her gait had raised his ideas of her beauty to the highest pitch When his eyes seemed to devour her she as by accident dropt her veil and shone upon him at once with  ll her charms The confusion which she could well feign on  the occasion heightened the beauty of her face Her timid eye by stealth fell upon the prince and kindled all his soul into love He was silent for the remaining part of the evening she endeavoured to confirm by her wit the conquest which the charms of her person had made  Marries Shere Afkun  Selim distracted with his passion knew not what course to take MherulNissa had been betrothed by her father to Shere Afkun a Turkomanian nobleman of great renown He applied to his father Akbar who sternly refused to commit a piec  of injustice though in favour of the heir of his throne The prince retired abashed and MherulNissa became the wife of Shere Afkun The latter however suffered in his prospects in life for not having made a voluntary resignation of the lady to the enamoured prince Though Selim durst make no open attack upon his fortunate rival during the life of Akbar men in office worshipped the rising sun and threw accumulated disgrace on Shere Afkun He became disgusted and left the court of Agra He retired into the province of Bengal and obtained from the Suba of that country the superintendency of the district of Burdwan  who is persecuted by Selim  The passion for MherulNissa which Selim had repressed from a respect and fear for his father returned with redoubled violence when he himself mounted the throne of India He was now absolute no subject could thwart his will and pleasure He recalled Shere Afkun from his retreat He was however afraid to go so much against the current of the public opinion as to deprive that Omrah of his wise Shere was inflexible no man of honour in India can part with his spouse and retain his life His incredible strength and bravery had rendered Shere extremely  popular He was naturally highspirited and proud and it was not to be expected that he would yield to indignity and public shameHis family his former reputation was highBorn of noble parents in Turkomania he had spent his youth in Persia and had served with uncommon renown Shaw Ismaël the third of the Sufvi line His original name was Asta Jillô but having killed a lion he was dignified with the title of Shere Afkun or the Overthrower of the Lion Under the latter name he became famous in India In the wars of Akbar he had served with great reputation He had distinguished himself in a particular manner under Chan Chanan at the taking of Sind by exhibiting prodigies of personal strength and valour Preserments had been heaped upon him and he was highly esteemed at court during the life of Akbar who loved in others that daring intrepidity for which he himself was renowned  He is called to court  Jehangire kept his court at Delhi when he called Shere Afkun to the presence He received him graciously and conferred new honours upon him Shere Afkun naturally open and generous suspected not the emperor's intentions Time he thought had crazed the memory of MherulNissa from Jehangire's mind He was deceived The monarch was resolved to remove his rival but the means he used were at once foolish and disgraceful He appointed a day for hunting and ordered the haunt of an enormous tiger to be explored News was soon brought that a tiger of an extraordinary size was discovered in the forest of Nidarbari This savage it was said had carried off many of the largest oxen from the neighbouring villages The emperor directed thither his march attended by Shere Afkun and several thousands of his principal officers with all their trains Having according to the custom of the Mogul Tartars surrounded the ground for many miles they began to move toward the center  on all sides The tiger was rouzed His roaring was heard in all quarters and the emperor hastened to the place  He attacks  The nobility being assembled Jehangire called aloud  "Who among you will advance singly and attack this tiger"  They looked on one another in silence then all turned their eyes on Shere Afkun He seemed not to understand their meaning at length three Omrahs started forth from the circle and sacrisicing fear to shame fell at the emperor's feet and begged permission to try singly their strength against the formidable animal The pride of Shere Afkun arose He had imagined that none durst attempt a deed so dangerous He hoped that after the refusal of the nobles the honour of the enterprize would devolve in course on his hands But three had offered themselves for the combat and they were bound in honour to insist on their prior right Afraid of losing his former renown Shere Afkun began thus in the presence  "To attack an animal with weapons is both unmanly and unfair God has given to man limbs and sinews as well as to tigers he has added reason to the former to conduct his strength"  The other Omrahs objected in vain  "That all men were inferior to the tiger in strength and that he could be overcome only with steel"  "I will convince you of your mistake"  Shere Afkun replied and throwing down his sword and shield prepared to advance unarmed  and kills an enormous tiger  Though the emperor was in secret pleased with a proposal full of danger to Shere he made a shew of dissuading him from the enterprize Shere was determined The monarch with seigned reluctance yielded Men knew not whether they ought most to admire the courage of the man or to exclaim against the folly of the deed Astonishment was painted in every face Every tongue was silent Writers give a particular but incredible  detail of the battle between Shere Afkun and the tiger This much is certain that after a long and obstinate struggle the astonishing warrior prevailed and though mangled with wounds himself laid at last the savage dead at his feet The thousands who were eyewitnesses of the action were even almost afraid to vouch for the truth of the exploit with their concurring testimony The fame of Shere was increased and the designs of the emperor failed But the determined cruelty of the latter stopt not here other means of death were contrived against the unfortunate Shere  Defe  t  a design ag  inst his life  He had scarce recovered from his wounds when he came to pay his respects at court He was caressed by the emperor and he suspected no guile A snare however was prepared for him Jehangire had meanly condescended to give private orders to the rider of one of his largest elephants to waylay his rival in one of the narrow streets when he next should return to court and there to tread him to death As accidents of that kind sometimes happen from the rage of those animals in the rutting season the thing might have passed without suspicion Shere was carried in his palanky He saw the elephant in his way He gave orders to the bearers to return back the elephant came forward They threw the palanky with their master in the street and sled to save their lives Shere saw his danger He had just time to rise He drew a short sword which always hung by his side with this weapon he struck the elephant across the root of the trunk which he cut off with one blow The animal roared turned from him fell down and expired The emperor was looking out at a window Here tired with amazement and shame Shere continued his way to the palace Without any suspicion of treachery he related the particulars to Jehangire The latter disguised his sentiments but reliquished not his designs He  praised the strength and valour of Shere who retired satisfied and unsuspecting from the presence  Discomfits  Whether the emperor endeavoured to conquer his passion for MherulNissa or felt remorse from his own behaviour is uncertain but for the space of six months no further attempts were made against the life of Shere who now retired to the capital of Bengal The former designs of Jehangire were no secret They were the subject of common conversation little to the advantage of the character of a great prince Absolute monarchs however are never without men who flatter their worst passions and administer to their most pernicious pleasures Kuttub Suba of Bengal was one of these convenient sycophants To ingratiate himself with the emperor though perhaps not by his express commands he hired forty russians to attack and murder Shere when an opportunity should offer Shere was apprized of the intentions of Kuttub He continued within doors but such was his confidence in his own strength and valour that at night he would not permit his servants to remain in his house They according to custom retired each to his own home An old porter only remained of the men servants under the same roof with Shere The assassins were no strangers to a circumstance common in India They made their observations upon the house They found that there was a room on the right hand within the the principal door which Shere used as a writingchamber This room communicated by a narrow passage with the sleeping apartments When it was dark they took advantage of the old porter's absence and conveyed themselves without discovery into the house  forty assassins  The principal door being bolted at the usual hour Shere and his family went to bed Some of the assassins when they thought  he was fallen asleep stole silently into his apartment They prepared to plunge their daggers into his body when one of them who was an old man being touched with remorse cried out with a loud voice  "Hold have we not the emperor's orders Let us behave like men Shall forty fall upon one and that one asleep"  "Boldly spoken"  said Shere starting that instant from his bed Seizing his sword he placed himself in a corner of the room There he was attacked by the assassins In a few minutes many of the villains lay weltering in their blood at his feet Scarce one half escaped without a wound The old man who had given warning did not attempt to fly Shere took him by the hand praised and thanked him for his behaviour and having enquired about those who had hired the assassins dismissed him with handsome presents to relate the particulars abroad  He is murdered  The fame of this gallant exploit resounded through the whole empire Shere could not stir abroad for the mob who pressed around him He however thought proper to retire from the capital of Bengal to his old residence at Burdwan He hoped to live there in obscurity and safety with his beloved MherulNissa He was deceived The Suba of Bengal had received his government for the purpose of removing the unfortunate Shere and he was not ungrateful After deliberating with himself about the means he at last fell upon an effectual expedient Settling the assairs of his government at Tanda which was at that time the capital of Bengal he resolved with a great retinue to make the tour of the dependent provinces In his rout he came to Burdwan He made no secret to his principal ossicers that he had the emperor's orders for dispatching Shere That devoted Omrah hearing that the Suba was entering the town in which he resided mounted his horse and with two servants only went to pay his respects The Suba received Shere with assected  politeness They rode for some time side by side and their conversation turned upon indifferent assairs The Suba suddenly stopt He ordered his elephant of state to be brought which he mounted under a pretence of appearing with becoming pomp in the city of Burdwan Shere stood still when the Suba was ascending and one of the pikemen pretending that Shere was in the way struck his horse and began to drive him before him Shere was enraged at the affront He knew that the pikeman durst not have used that freedom without his master's orders he saw plainly that there was a laid design against his life He turned round upon the pikeman and threatened him with instant death He fell on the ground and begged for mercy Swords were drawn Shere had no time to lose He spurred his horse up to the elephant on which the Suba was mounted and having broke down the amari or castle cut him in two and thus the unfortunate Kuttub became the victim of his own zeal to please the emperor Shere did not rest here he turned his sword on the other officers The first that fell by his hands was Aba Chan a native of Cashmire who was an Omrah of five thousand horse Four other nobles shared the same fate A death attended every blow from the hand of Shere The remaining chiefs were at once astonished and frightened They sled to a distance and formed a circle around him Some began to gall him with arrows others to sire with their musquets His horse at length being shot with a ball in the forehead fell under him The unfortunate Shere reduced to the last extremity began to upbraid them with cowardice He invited them severally to single combat but he begged in vain He had already received some wounds He plainly saw his approaching fate Turning his sace toward Mecca he took up some dust with his hand and for want of water threw it by way of ablution upon his head He then stood up seemingly unconcerned Six balls  entered his body in different places before he fell His enemies had scarce the courage to come near till they saw him in the last agonies of death They praised his valour to the skies but in adding to his reputation they took away from their own  MherulNissa  The officer who succeeded the deceased Suba in the command of the troops hastened to the house of Shere He was afraid that MherulNissa in the first paroxisms of grief might make away with herself That lady however bore her misfortunes with more fortitude and resignation She was unwilling to adopt the manners of her country upon such tragical occasions She even pretended in vindication of her apparent insensibility to sollow the injunctions of her deceased lord She alleged that Shere foreseeing his own fall by Jehangire had conjured her to yield to the desires of that monarch without hesitation The reasons which she said he gave were as fecble as the fact itself was improbable He was afraid that his own exploits would sink into oblivion without they were connected with the remarkable event of giving an empress to India  illreceived at court  MherulNissa was sent with all imaginable care to Delhi She was sull of the ambition of becoming the savourite Sultana Her vanity was disappointed Though she was received with great tenderness and affection by Rokia Sultana Begum the emperor's mother Jehangire refused to see her Whether his mind was then sixed on another object or remorse had taken possession of his soul authors do not agree They however assert with great improbability that the emperor was so much assected with the death of his savourite the Suba of Bengal that he resolved to punish MherulNissa for an accident in which she had no concern Be that as it will he gave orders to shut her up in one of the worst apartments of the seraglio He even  would not deign to see her and contrary to his usual munificence to women he allowed her but fourteen anas about two shillings of our money aday for the subsistance of herself and some female slaves This coldness to a woman whom he passionately loved when not in his power was at once unaccountable and absurd  Not seen by the emperor  MherulNissa was a woman of a haughty spirit and could not brook this treatment She had no remedy She gave herself up for some time to grief as if for the death of her husband but it was disappointment only that preyed upon her mind She was at length reconciled to her condition from a hope of an opportunity of rekindling the emperor's former love She trusted to the amazing power of her own beauty which to conquer required only to be seen The emperor's mother who was deeply interested for MherulNissa could not prevail upon her son to see her He turned away from her in silence when she spoke of the widow of Shere An expedient however offered itself to MherulNissa To raise her own reputation in the seraglio and to support herself and slaves with more decency than the scanty pittance allowed her would admit she called forth her invention and taste in working some admirable pieces of tapestry and embroidery in painting silks with exquisite delicacy and in inventing female ornaments of every kind These articles were carried by her slaves to the disserent squares of the royal seraglio and to the harams of the great officers of the empire The inventions of MherulNissa excelled so much in their kind that they were bought with the greatest avidity Nothing was fashionable among the ladies of Delhi and Agra but the work of her hands She accumulated by these means a considerable sum of money with which she repaired and beautified her apartments  and clothed her slaves in the richest tissues and brocades while she herself affected a very plain and simple dress  till the end of four years  In this situation the widow of Shere continued four years without once having seen the emperor Her fame reached his ears from every apartment in the seraglio Curiosity at length vanquished his resolution He determined to be an eyewitness of the things which he had so often heard concerning MherulNissa He resolved to surprize her and communicating his resolution to none he suddenly entered her apartments where he found every thing so elegant and magnificent that he was struck with amazement But the greatest ornament of the whole was MherulNissa herself She lay half reclined on an embroidered sopha in a plain muslin dress Her slaves sat in a circle round her at work attired in rich brocades She slowly arose in manifest confusion and received the emperor with the usual ceremony of touching first the ground then her forehead with her right hand She did not utter one word but stood with her eyes fixed on the ground Jehangire remained for some time silent He admired her shape her stature her beauty her grace and that inexpressible voluptuousness of mein which it is impossible to resist  Her nuptials with Jehangire  Jehangire did not for some time recover from his confusion He at length sat down on the sopha and requested MherulNissa to sit by his side The first question he asked was  "Why this difference between the appearance of MherulNissa and her slaves"  She very shrewdly replied  "Those born to servitude must dress as it shall please those whom they serve These are my servants and I alleviate the burden of bondage by every indulgence in my power But I that am your slave O Emperor  of the Moguls must dress according to your pleasure and not my own"  Though this answer was a kind of sarcasm on his behaviour it was so pertinent and well turned that it greatly pleased Jehangire He took her at once in his arms His former affection returned with all its violence and the very next day public orders were issued to prepare a magnificent festival for the celebration of his nuptials with MherulNissa Her name was also changed by an edict into NoorMâhil or the Light of the Seraglio The emperor's former favourites vanished before her and during the rest of the reign of Jehangire she bore the chief sway in all the affairs of the empire  Promotion of her family  The great power of NoorMâhil appeared for the first time in the immediate advancement of her family Her father who in the latter end of the reign of Akbar had been chief treasurer of the empire was raised to the office of absolute visier and first minister Ferid Bochari who under the title of Mortaza Chan managed the affairs of the empire had been by a stroke of the palsy rendered unfit for business which opened the way for the promotion of the ActemâdulDowlat The two brothers of NoorMâhil were raised to the first rank of nobility by the titles of Acticâd Chan and Asiph Jah Her numerous relations poured in from Tartary upon hearing of the fortune of the house of Aiass Some of them were gratified with high employments all with lucrative ones Her father was not dazzled with the splendor of his high station He was a man of probity in private life of ability in office He became a great and good minister His name is revered to this day in Hindostan The talents of her brothers were rather popular than great They behaved with honour and moderation upon every occasion strangers to insolence and enemies to oppression The invidiousness of their situation did not raise envy Men allowed that merit intitled  them more to their high stations than their relation to the favourite Sultana The writers of the affairs of Hindostan remark That no family ever rose so suddenly or so deservedly to rank and eminence than the family of Chaja Aiass and this is our apology for the minute relation of their progress to greatness  CHAP III  Prudent administrationInsurrections quelledBad success in the DecanEmperor's progress to AjmerePeace with the RanaPrince Churrum in favourCharacter of Sultan PurvezAn English

of the Sultana estranged the mind of Jehangire from all public affairs Easy in his temper and naturally voluptuous the powers of his soul were locked up in a pleasing enthusiasm of love by the engaging conversation and extraordinary beauty of NoorMâhil The state however did not suffer from the negligent indolence of the emperor An ample field was left for the virtues and abilities of the new visier who turned his attention more to domestic improvement than to foreign conquest Agriculture which had been much neglected was encouraged Many provinces desolated by former disturbances and wars were by degrees repeopled and cultivated Security of property was given to the farmer the industry of the mechanic was protected The country assumed a new face the useful arts were revived and flourished in the cities The visier even extended his improvements to desarts Forests formerly the haunts of wild beasts were cut down and villages and towns  began to rise in solitudes Insurrection and rebellion were not heard of because there was no oppression idleness being discouraged robberies were things unknown The revenues of the empire gradually increased to prevent extortion in the collection every Suba was obliged to transmit monthly to court a state of the improvements and regulations made in consequence of public instructions from Agra When the improvements were not adequate to the taxes the Subas were either severely reprimanded or degraded No distinctions were made in the administration of justice between the Mahommedan and Hindoo Both were worshippers of God each in his way both members of the same community and subjects of the same lord  Afgans rebel  When the father of the Sultana was thus employed in internal regulations for the good of the empire new commotions arose near its northern frontier The Afgans a sierce and untractable people natives of the mountains beyond the Indus always thirsting after slaughter and plunder could not long endure peace These barbarians were encouraged to insurrection by the absence of Shaw Bcc Chan Suba of Cabul from the capital of the province of that name The Suba had been obliged to make a journey northward to settle some affairs on the frontiers and MajinulMuluc the deputygovernor of Cabul suffered himself to be surprized in the city by the insurgents They entered Cabul with a considerable army and began to exercise all the cruelties of war The inhabitants rendered desperate by misfortune took arms against the plunderers The city became a seene of slaughter and distress Nadili Meidani a gallant man and an officer of rank in the province hastened to the relief of Cabul Some of the banditti fled many were put to the sword The sugitives were pursued to their mountains and the rebellion  quashed These transactions happened in the month of Siffer of the sixth year of Jehangire  An in surrection in Bengal  An insurrection happened in Bengal toward the close of the same year Asman an Afgan descended of the race of the Patan princes who reigned in India before the empire fell under the dominion of the house of Timur stirred up a rebellion He had formerly made many attempts to recover the throne of his fathers but this was his most formidable and resolute effort Sujait an officer of rank was dispatched against the rebel by Islam Chan Suba of Bengal Both armies soon came to an action Sujait was on the point of being defeated He drove his elephant as the last resort of despair through the thickest of the enemy in search of Asman who was mounted on a horse The elephant having seized the horse dashed him and his rider against the ground but when the animal was about to tread the unfortunate Asman under his feet one of his attendants came and wounded the elephant in the trunk The elephant with the pain of the wound plunged in such a manner that Sujait was thrown off and fell headlong on the ground His life was saved by his men who seeing him exposing his person became less careful about their own In their effort to extricate their chief they repulsed the enemy Asman bruised with his fall was carried back to his tent where he soon after expired His death gave the victory to Sujait and quashed the rebellion in Bengal Sujait for this signal service was raised by the emperor to the title of Rustum Zimân which signified the Hercules of the Age  Another in Behâr  The insurrection in Bengal was scarce quelled when another of a more extraordinary nature happened in the neighbouring province of Behâr A man of low degree whose name was  Cuttub descended of the Rohilla tribe of Afgans and a native of Atcha found his way to Behâr That province was possessed by a number of his nation who had settled there under the Patan empire He affirmed that he was the prince Chusero the reigning emperor's son and he accompanied his imposture with a probable story of his escape from prison The misfortunes of Chusero had rendered him popular Many believed the tale Many in love with innovation and spoil joined the standard of Cuttub He numbered in less than a week seven thousand among his followers He assumed immediately the Imperial titles and advanced with his motley army of banditti toward Patna the capital of the province of Behâr Assil Chan the Suba of the province was absent at Gazipoor about one hundred and twenty miles from Patna and his deputy commanded in the city when Cuttub appeared before it  Quashed  The city of Patna was too large and illgarrisoned with troops to make any defence Cuttub entered it with little opposition He took possession of the palace women and wealth of the Suba and giving up Patna to plunder divided the spoil among his adherents Some who were no strangers to the person of Sultan Chusero endeavoured to expose the imposture They suffered for their rashness and were put to death Some conscious of the imposition were afraid to own their folly and having gone so far were unwilling and ashamed to recede Assil himself at first gave some credit to a report brought from all quarters He knew not how to behave He affected the party of Chusero and he feared the emperor Ten days after Patna was surprized by Cuttub Assil was convinced by various letters that the leader of the insurrection was not the prince He hastened from Gazipoor with all the forces he could collect On the third day he  presented himself before Patna Cuttub marched out and gave him battle The insurgents were defeated and fled In the hurry of their flight they neglected to shut the gates and the enemy entered at their heels The pretended prince driven to the last extremity shut himself up with a few friends in the Suba's house He defended himself for some time Assil having lost twenty men in endeavouring to scale the walls was so fortunate as to kill the impostor with a brickbat and thus a ridiculous kind of death put an end to the ambitious views of Cuttub  Prince Purvez sent against the Rana  Intelligence of this insurrection arrived at the court of Agra at the same time with the news of its being quelled Fresh disturbances broke out in a different corner of the empire Amar Sinka prince of Odipour in the Decan setting suddenly upon the Imperial troops on the frontier defeated them The action happened near the city of Brampour among the mountains of Balagat The emperor was alarmed He placed his second son Purvez at the head of thirty thousand horse and gave him at the same time a commission to take the command of all the troops on the confines of the Imperial dominions and the Decan The force had it even been well conducted was no more than adequate to the service Amar Sinka who went under the title of Rana or THE PRINCE by way of eminence deduced his descent from the Imperial family who reigned in the great city of Kinôge over all India for many centuries before that empire was invaded by the followers of Mahommed He added power to his noble birth He possessed the greater part of the territories which compose the extensive dominions of the present Mahrattors and the lawful heir of his family bears to this day the name of Prince among that powerful aristocracy  Feuds in the Imperial army  Many nobles of the first rank and renown attended Sultan Purvez in this expedition The most considerable were Chan Jehan descended of the Imperial family of Lodi who reigned before the house of Timur in Hindostan Mirza Abdul Rahim who derived his pedigree from Timur and Chan Chanan the son of the famous Byram who had been regent during the minority of the emperor Akbar These composed the prince's council But they carried their former feuds into their deliberations They were unanimous in nothing Jealousy in its most forbidding form appeared in all their debates and they could not even abstain from indecent reflections upon one another The spirit of discord spread from the council of war to the army Each of the great Omrahs had his partizans and abettors Faction and tumult reigned in every corner of the camp The prince was naturally mild he wanted experience and he was destitute of that intrepid firmness and severity which is necessary to awe mankind into obedience He descended to intreaty where he ought to command and when he endeavoured to reconcile them their passion became more inflamed as every check was removed by his known softness of disposition  Their distress and retreat  The army in the mean time advanced Within a few days march of Brampour the Imperialists came in sight of the enemy Men generally become united at the approach of danger It happened otherwise here The spirit of Discord and Envy had been let loose and the Omrahs feared the enemy less than the success that might attend the advice of any one of themselves Chan Jehan was for battle Chan Chanan differed from him in opinion as the enemy was too advantageously posted in the hills Abdul Rahim was for entering the Rana's country by another road The prince was ready to adopt any resolution upon which they all should agree This was impossible The  army lay inactive The air in the camp became putrid Fevers raged The enemy hovered round on the mountains Provisions and forage became scarce the fields around were red with the fresh graves of the dead But though the council of war disagreed about an attack they concurred in a retreat They fled with precipitation to Ajmere The enemy hung on their rear The Omrahs wrote separately letters to court with accusations against each other's conduct Chan Chanan was recalled to Agra divested of all his employments and he even thought himself happy in being able to save his life The disgrace of this nobleman redounded not to the honour of Chan Jehan That lord through whose accusations Chan Chanan chiefly fell rendered himself odious by ingratitude He had been educated in the family of Chan Chanan he had risen through his influence to all his honours and offices  Purvez recalled  Jehangire alarmed at the bad success of his arms against the Rana dispatched Mohabet Chan to take the command of the army He could not have made a better choice Mohabet was brave in action intrepid in deliberation full of dignity and spirit under the absolute dominion of judgment and good conduct Purvez was recalled to the presence The unfortunate issue of the campaign was a severe blow to that prince It affected his reputation it lost him his father's affections and even his prospect of succeeding to the throne  Emperor's progress to Ajmere  Though the choice which Jehangire had made of a general to command his forces against the Rana seemed to promise success the event did not answer the emperor's sanguine expectations The army was in too bad a condition to be suddenly restored to discipline and order Mohabet could not with any assurance of victory shew them to the enemy Jehangire was naturally  impatient On the second of Shabân of the one thousand and twentysecond year of the Higera he moved the Lescar or Imperial camp with a professed design of putting himself at the head of the troops employed against the Rana The magnificence of the emperor's progress to Ajmere deserves a brief description When the monarchs of Hindostan take the field their camps are a kind of moving cities That of Jehangire in his present progress was in circumference at least twenty miles The Lescar is divided like a regular town into squares alleys and streets The royal pavilion is always erected in the center no man raises his nearer than the distance of a musketshot around Every man of quality every artificer knows his ground the space allotted for him on which side how far from the emperor he must pitch his tent The pavilions of the great officers of the court are at a distance known by their splendor at hand by marks which distinguish the various ranks of the owners The shops and apartments of tradesmen are also known by rule and no man is for a moment at a loss how to supply his wants The Lescar from a rising ground furnishes one of the most agreeable prospects in the world Starting up in a few hours in an uninhabited plain it raises the idea of a city built by enchantment and fills the mind with delightful wonder and surprize Even those who leave their houses in cities to follow the prince in his progress are frequently so charmed with the Lescar when situated in a beautiful and convenient place that they cannot prevail with themselves to remove To prevent this inconvenience to the court the emperor after sufficient time is allowed to the tradesmen to follow orders them to be burnt out of their tents  Prince Churrum sent to command in the Decan  Though the emperor at his departure from Agra declared that he was to command in person his army in the Decan that  service was actually destined for Sultan Churrum his third son That prince left Ajmere on the twentieth of Zicâda He was more successful than his brother Having superseded Mohâbet he entered the mountains without hesitation The enemy was seized with a panic and fled before him He made himself master of Brampour the capital of the Rana's dominions with little opposition Several skirmishes were fought but no decisive battle The Rana sued for peace His son Kinwâr Kirren came with magnificent presents to the prince Churrum received him with apparent kindness and great distinction The Rana himself encouraged by Churrum's reception of his son came unexpectedly into the presence He threw himself at the feet of Churrum who very courteously raised him took him in his arms and obliged him to sit on his right hand  The Rana offers terms  The Rana opened the conference by excusing his own behaviour the outrages committed by his people and he extolled the clemency of the prince who though superior in the field was willing to grant an equitable peace Churrum knew that the blame of the war did not rest on the Hindoos He therefore replied That excuses on the side of the Rana were unnecessary that it was the duty of every prince to exert the power placed in his hands in defence of his subjects and dominions but as war had been kindled and the fortune of the Mahommedans had prevailed he thought it his duty to use his success with moderation and that he was willing to put an immediate end to all differences by a solid and lasting peace The Rana consented to pay a tribute to the family of Timur Some dissiculties arose about the sum the decision was left to Jehangire To finish the treaty as well as to be an hostage for the Rana's faith Kinwâr Kirren that prince's son was dispatched to the Imperial presence Jehangire at the time kept his court at Ajmere He received Kinwâr with great  distinction He presented him with arms jewels a rich dress for himself and one for each of his principal attendants He also gave to the prince an Imperial elephant sumptuously caparisoned and one hundred fine Persian horses He created him by patent an Omrah of five thousand but all these were splendid badges of slavery and the means of degradation from his former independence and rank Peace was finally settled upon the terms proposed by Churrum  Prince Churrum in great favour  The success of the expedition into the Decan raised to a high pitch the reputation of Churrum His father's affection for him grew with his fame Men began to turn their eyes upon him as the heirapparent of the throne Jehangire treated him in his conversation with the highest distinction and he seemed anxious to express to the world his affection and regard A court was appointed for him Estates were settled upon him for the maintenance of a bodyguard of a thousand horse and fifteen thousand foot subject only to his commands Sultan Purvez in the mean time declined in his father's esteem in proportion as Churrum rose The prince Chusero was still in close consinement and a fair field was left for the ambition of Churrum  A whim of the emperor  During the transactions in the Decan a ridiculous whim rose in the emperor's mind He ordered his ears to be bored and then he hung them with large pearls An edict was issued to forbid the court to all nobles who should not do the same He in the mean time distributed a vast quantity of pearls and jewels among the nobility to induce them to pay obedience to the edict Many however were refractory Earrings are the badge of slavery among the Indians and the Mahommedans though subject to despotism wished to avoid the appearance of being  slaves Jehangire himself gives a ridiculous reason for this innovation in dress In his memoirs of the first twelve years of his reign he excuses the introduction of earrings from a motive of religion to the superstitions of which he was by no means often subject His father Akbar it was pretended by the merit of a pilgrimage to Ajmere to the learned and religious Chaja Moinuldien had been blessed with children Jehangire was the first fruits of this piece of devotion and he said in the preamble to his edict that he who was brought into being by the prayers of Chaja could do no less than become his slave and wear the marks of servitude His reasons appeared so absurd and superstitious that some of the nobles taxed him with favouring idolatry The effeminate custom was however introduced by the weight of the Imperial authority and it still remains a blot on Jehangire's memory and a lasting mark of the weakness of his mind  Disgrace of Chan Azim and death of Maa Singh  On the twentieth of Mohirrim of the Sultan Churrum returned to court covered with laurels He was received by Jehangire with marks of the highest esteem and affection which the artful prince converted to means favourable to his schemes of ambition and to gratify his passion for revenge Chan Azim already mentioned as the principal abettor of Chusero's rebellion was accused by Churrum of intended treason He had long been excluded from the councils of state and though his government of Malava had been continued to him it was more from a fear of his influence than from a respect to his character and person Habituated to the high office of visier in the reign of Akbar he could not brook his want of power He spoke incautiously of government and it is said that he actually meditated to render himself independent of the empire in his own province of Malava He was seized before his schemes were ripe for execution carried to  Gualiâr and imprisoned in that impregnable fortress Raja Man Singh the next great adherent of prince Chusero died in the course of the same year in his government of Bengal He was chief of the Rajaput princes His honour was great his reputation high In the wars of Akbar he signalized himself upon many occasions He was very instrumental in the conquest of Bengal the government of which as a reward for his services he retained to his death His son Bao Singh succeeded him in his subaship being raised by the emperor to the rank of an Omrah of five thousand horse by the title of Mirza Rajagi  Character of Sultan Purvez  When Sultan Churrum carried all things before him in the Imperial presence his elder brother Purvez resided with all the pomp of royalty at Brampour as governor of the dominion and province of Candeish Chan Chanan in some measure restored to favour remained with Purvez and managed under him the affairs of the province In the end of the autumn of the of the Higera Sir Thomas Roe the English Ambassador to the court of Agra arrived at Brampour Politeness and affability were natural to Purvez Full of honour and goodnature his virtues were of the milder cast too indolent for the fatigues of business diffident of his own abilities He possessed the personal courage of a good soldier but he was destitute of the conduct necessary to a great general He followed implicitly the advice of others when there was no disagreement in their opinions when there was he was embarrassed and could not decide His genius suited times of tranquillity and had he lived to possess the throne he might have rendered his people happy from his invariable clemency and love of domestic quiet  His courteous reception of Sir Thomas Roe  When the arrival of Sir Thomas at Brampour was announced by the proper officer to the prince he sent him a plite message  to come into his presence The ambassador obeyed and Purvez prepared to receive him in state In the outward court of the palace a hundred gentlemen on horseback formed a lane through which the ambassador conducted by the Cutwal passed In the inner court the prince sat mounted in a gallery under a royal canopy The nobles according to their rank formed a line on either side The chief secretary stood on the steps of the throne and conveyed in the concisest terms to the prince whatever was addressed to him from below The behaviour of Purvez was upon the whole courteous and obliging he passed from the usual ceremonies required from ambassadors and affected to treat Sir Thomas after the manner of his own country A firmân was immediately issued for a permission to an English factory to settle at Brampour The prince invited the ambassador to a private conference to thank him for his presents insinuating that he was anxious to throw off that state and distance with which he was obliged to receive him before so great an appearance of nobles  Transactions at the court in Ajmere  Jehangire in the mean time kept his court at Ajmere He seemed insane upon the article of paying honours to Chaja He ordered a magnificent palace to be built in the neighbourhood of Ajmere for Hafîza Jemmâl the saint's daughter the holy man himself from the austerity of his principles not chusing by an acceptance of presents to depart from the simplicity of life and philosophical character which had raised his fame The palace built for Jemmâl was remarkable for beauty and situation Fine baths were crected over natural fountains and extensive gardens were laid out around it with great elegance and taste Tranquillity prevailed over all the empire The motions of the army in the Decan were rather parade than war Luxury prevailed in every form The magnisicence of the favourite Sultana was  beyond all bounds Expensive pageants sumptuous entertainments were the whole business of the court The voice of music never ceased by day in the street the sky was enlightened at night with fireworks and illuminations  The English ambassador arrives at court  In the midst of this festivity and joy the English ambassador arrived at Ajmere He was received by Jehangire with the utmost affability and politeness He even prevented the ambassador with expressions of respect for his master and felicitations to himself upon his safe arrival at court The presents given by the ambassador were agreeable to the emperor but a fine coach sent by King James pleased him most of all He even had the impatience to go into it that very night and to desire the ambassador's servants to draw him around the court of the palace Sultan Churrum at the time was allpowerful in the affairs of the state To him the ambassador applied as lord of Surat to redress the grievances of the English at that port The prince was courteous and promised fair but he was an enemy to all Christians whom he called Idolaters and most of all an enemy to the English The emperor's favour for the ambassador prevailed in some measure over the prince's prejudices and obstinacy In the month of January a firmân was obtained for the establishment of a factory at Surat But it was worded with caution defective and circumscribed  Disturbances in Guzerat  In the end of the year two insurrections happened in the kingdom of Guzerat The first was a rebellion excited by a youth descended of the ancient kings of that country the second was an extraordinary incursion of the Coolies a race of robbers who from their desarts infested the highways and cultivated country The young rebel assumed the title of Bahadar Shaw Before he could execute any thing material he died and Guzerat was relieved from the threatened misfortune of a civil war Abdalla  Chan was ordered from the Decan against the Coolies He had commanded the Imperial army against the Rana in the intermediate space of time between the recall of Mohâbet and the arrival of prince Churrum He was successful but his glory was obscured by the superior reputation of the prince who succeeded him Jehangire was not insensible of the valour and abilities of Abdalla To leave a fair field to his favourite son he removed the general to Guzerat The emperor departed from his usual humanity in his instructions to Abdalla The Coolies were a barbarous and cruel race of men and Jehangire gave directions to extirpate the whole tribe as enemies to the rest of mankind  Quashed by Abdalla  Abdalla arrived with great expedition at Ahmedabâd the capital of Guzerat Some chiefs who from the hopes of booty and through fear had joined the Coolies submitted to him in his march With five hundred select men the general left Ahmedabâd and he made so much expedition that he entered the mountainous and almost impervious country of the Coolies before they had any intelligence of his march The two principal chiefs of the banditti were Eder and Laël Abdalla sat down suddenly before the castle of Eder That chief not intimidated marched out and gave him battle After an obstinate conflict of some hours the Coolies were obliged to fly Eder took the way of the desart and left his castle and treasure to the victor Laël in the mean time was on an excursion of depredation in another corner of Guzerat He had robbed a great caravan of all its merchandize and it was the news of this misfortune that directed Abdalla to the enemy Laël had under him three thousand horse and twelve thousand foot but Abdalla had been reinforced The Cooli did not decline battle The action was bloody Victory declared for Abdalla and the head of Laël  who was slain in the fight was placed over one of the gates of Ahmedabâd  Disturbances in Cabul quashed  The insurrection at Guzerat was scarce quelled when the Afgans the natives of the mountains between India and Persia revolted and issuing from their hills laid waste the neighbouring country in the province of Cabul Shaw Bec governor of Cabul marched against the insurgents They had the folly to come to a regular battle with that Suba and they were defeated Shaw Bec made the best use of his victory He pursued the fugitives beyond Candahar and restored his province to its former tranquillity  Bad success in the Decan  During the residence of Sultan Purvez in Brampour the capital of Chandeish Chan Jehân already mentioned as an Omrah of great distinction descended from the royal family of Lodi commanded the Imperial army in subordination to the prince and pushed his expeditions into the unconquered kingdoms of the Decan MaleckAmber was at the head of the confederacy against the Imperial invasion Nothing of consequence was done by Chan Jehân on account of disputes between the officers of the army The prince Purvez was ordered to take the command in person Upon his appearance at the head of the Imperial troops several chiefs submitted and paid the accustomed tribute Maleck Amber stood out alone The Rana broke his treaty and appeared in arms The danger alarmed Jehangire He had a better opinion of the military abilities of Sultan Churrum than of those of Purvez The former was ordered to supersede the latter which was at once reckoned unjust and impolitic as Churrum was as much detested by the soldiers as Purvez was beloved  Sultan Churrum's name changed to Shaw Jehân  In the month of June one thousand six hundred and sixteen according to our computation of time the prince Churrum marched from Ajmere to the Decan His father before his departure conferred upon him the title of Shaw Jehân or KING OF THE WORLD This name he retained even after his accession to the empire and he was distinguished by it during the remainder of his father's reign that of Churrum being from his going upon the present expedition laid for ever aside The friends of the family of Timur represented to the emperor the danger of sending the younger to supersede the elder brother considering the animosities which subsisted between them  "No matter" said Jehangire "let them fight it out The victor shall manage the war in the Decan the vanquished may return to me"  The speech of a lunatic more than that of a prudent prince Purvez however was of a milder disposition than to push his resentment so far He quietly resigned the command and was succeeded by Shaw Jehân much against the inclination of the army  Forces the princes of the Decan to a peace  Shaw Jehân having carried from Ajmere a great reinforcement upon his arrival set the army in motion toward the enemy The princes of the Decan were intimidated and they were divided among themselves They retreated at Shaw Jehân's approach and sent ambassadors to sue for peace Shaw Jehân glad of an opportunity of eclipsing Sultan Purvez received their submission upon easy terms Maleck Amber again deserted had the resolution not to accede to the pacification Shaw Jehân anxious to return with his laurels to court left the war suspended by a partial truce rather than finished by a solid peace On the eleventh of Shawal of the one thousand and twentysixth of the Higera he arrived in the presence accompanied by the princes  who had submitted to his arms Their respective tributes were soon settled and they were permitted to return  Cause of the former bad success  The success of this expedition was by no means the effect of Shaw Jehân's prudent and resolute conduct The way to a pacification had been paved before he left Ajmere The emperor justly astonished at the small progress of his arms in the Decan enquired minutely into the cause Chan Chanan who managed every thing under Sultan Purvez was secretly in the pay of the enemy He clogged every measure and rendered every expedition of no effect He long endeavoured by his friends at court to prevent the removal of Purvez The emperor had taken his resolution Shaw Jehân was destined for the command of the army and Chan Chanan to deprive him of the honour of a victory over an enemy who had apparently resisted all his own and his pupil's efforts persuaded the confederates to sue for peace in the Imperial presence without alleging their fear of Shaw Jehân as anyways conducive to their offers of pacification The emperor however would not receive their submission but through the hands of the prince anxious to raise the consequence of his favourite son in the eyes of his subjects  The emperor removes from Ajmere  In the month of December of the year one thousand six hundred and sixteen according to the Christian aera the emperor with all the accustomed magnificence of his march left Ajmere His professed design was to approach nearer to his army on the frontiers to give them spirit with his presence After a tedious journey he arrived at Mando in the province of Malava and took up his residence in that city He did one very popular action on his march Passing by the place where his son Chusero was confined he ordered his coach  The same that was sent him as a present by our James I  to stop at the gate The prince  by his commands was brought before him His chains were struck off and he was placed upon one of the Imperial elephants The people were overjoyed at the release of Chusero His affability and the beauty of his person recommended him to the vulgar and they loved him on account of his misfortunes Many causes concurred to make the emperor adopt this measure He was informed that some friends of Shaw Jehân were plotting against the life of Chusero The minister Asaph Jah the favourite Sultana's brother had also behaved rudely to the unfortunate prince and betrayed symptoms of dislike and revenge Shaw Jehân was probably at the bottom of all His friends without his permission would searce have attempted the life of his brother and he had been lately married to the daughter of Asaph Jah The emperor was enraged at their wickedness and presumption and by an act of power frustrated for the time their designs  Great power of the empress  The power of NoorMâhil over the emperor's affections had not in the least abated She for the most part ruled over him with absolute sway sometimes his spirit broke forth beyond her controul Her brother's alliance with Shaw Jehan kept her in the interest of that prince and her aversion to Chusero and Purvez was equal to her regard for him An edict was issued to change her name from NoorMâhil into that of NoorJehân or the LIGHT OF THE WORLD To distinguish her from the other wives of the emperor she was always addressed by the title of SHAHE or Empress Her name was joined with that of the emperor on the current coin She was the spring which moved the great machine of the state Her family took rank immediately after the princes of the blood They were admitted at all hours into the presence nor were they excluded from the most secret apartments of the seraglio By her influence Chan  Azim the late visier was released from his confinement in Gualiâr and admitted into court  Transactions at court during its residence at Mando  It was after Jehangire's arrival at Mando that the affairs of the Decan were settled The English ambassador remained still at court The affability and goodnature of Jehangire did not for some time overbalance Shaw Jehân's aversion to the English nation An incident at Surat was magnified into an insult upon the Imperial power by the prince and his party The ambassador however removed the emperor's jealousy and he had the address to gain at last the favour of the prince the minister and the empress and obtained the privileges of trade which were the object of his embassy An ambassador from Persia was not so successful he was received with little ceremony and dismissed with a coolness little short of contempt He came to negociate a loan at the court of Agra and Jehangire was in no humour to give any of his money away The emperor even descended into meanness on the occasion The Persian had been served in all necessaries from court A bill was ordered to be sent him when he announced his design of departing He was obliged to pay the last farthing but the presents which he had brought for the emperor were valued and deducted from the sum demanded  Emperor's progress to Guzerat and return to Agra  The emperor having settled the affairs of the Decan and spent at Mando seventeen months in hunting and other rural amusements marched with his Lescâr or great camp into the kingdom of Guzerat In the latter end of the Autumn of the one thousand and twentyseventh of the Higera he arrived at Ahmedabâd the capital of Guzerat He took from that city the route of Cambait where he had ordered ships and magnificent barges to be ready for him to take his amusement on the ocean with all his court He was soon tired of the agitation of the vessels on the waves and returned to Ahmedabâd on the second of Ramzan of  the year one thousand and twentyseven He did not long remain at Ahmedabâd He took the route of Agra and arrived in that capital after an absence of near five years  Death and character of the visier  Soon after the court returned to Agra the good old visier ActemâdulDowla the emperor's fatherinlaw gave up a life which on account of his many virtues had become dear to the people Bred up in the school of Adversity ActemâdulDowla had learned to subdue his passions to listen to the dictates of Reason to feel for the misfortunes of mankind Having raised himself from servitude to authority from indigence to honour and wealth he knew the duties of every station He was not less conversant with the world in practice than he was from his extensive reading and the wellweighed reflections of his own mind An oeconomist in every thing but in charity he was only covetous of wealth to relieve the needy and the poor He chose rather to maintain the dignity of his rank by the number of his friends than by that of domestics followers and slaves The people loved him as a father but feared him as a father too for he tempered severity with moderation and lenity with the rigour of the laws The empire flourished under his wise administration No evil but luxury prevailed That weed takes root in prosperity and perhaps can never be eradicated from so rich a soilThe empress was inconsolable for the death of her father She proposed at once as a proof of her affection and magnificence to perpetuate his memory in a monument of solid silver The Imperial architect soon convinced her that a metal so precious would not be the most lasting means of transmitting the visier's fame to posterity  "All ages" said he "are full of a varice and even the empire of the house of Timur like all sublunary things is subject to revolution and change"  She dropt her purpose and a magnificent fabric of stone still retains in Agra the name of ActemâdulDowla  CHAP IV  Disposition of the

court  THE death of the old visier produced no alteration in the affairs of the court of Agra Habituated under his father to public business Asiph Jah was active in his high department and Jehangire himself had acquired a considerable degree of experience and knowledge in the past years of his reign The favourite Sultana was not in the mean time idle She even attended to transactions in which her own passions were not immediately concerned and often gave seasonable advice to her consort She had such an ascendancy over the emperor's mind that he seldom durst attempt any material measure without her concurrence She disposed of the highest offices at pleasure and the greatest honours were conferred at her nod Asiph was attentive to his sister's humours He knew the pride and haughtiness of her disposition and he forgot the equality which nature gives to a brother in a profound respect for the empress  Expedition into the mountains of Sewalic  Toward the close of the year the Raja Bickermajît was sent with a considerable force to the mountains of Sewalic to the northeast of the Ganges In the numerous vallies which intersect that immense ridge of hills many tribes lived under their native princes who had never been subdued by the arms of the followers of Mahommed Safe in their inaccessible retreats they often issued out in a depredatory manner from their fastnesses and harassed with incursions the northern provinces Bickermajît after having encountered with great difficulties penetrated into the heart of their country and sat down before the fort of Eangurra which was situated upon a rocky mountain and thought impregnable It fell soon into his hands but the reduction of all the tribes was not finished till the close of the succeeding year Twentytwo petty princes agreed to pay a certain tribute and they sent hostages to Agra as securities for their future obedience  Aurungzébe born  The eleventh of Zicâda was rendered remarkable by the birth of a son to the prince Shaw Jehân by Sultana Kudsia the daughter of Asiph Jah Jehangire who from his affection to his son was highly pleased with this increase in his family called the infant AURUNGZEBE or the Ornament of the ThroneTo avoid the approaching heat of the season the emperor resolved to remove his court to the delightful country of Cashmire Shaw Jehân accompanied his father in his progress They entered the mountains of Sewalic in their way and visited the fort of Eangurra which had some time before surrendered to Bickermajît Jehangire in a pretended zeal for religion ordered all the images of the gods of the Hindoos which were found in a temple within the fortress to be broken to pieces and he assisted in consecrating the place for the worship of God after the manner prescribed in the Coran  Return of the ambassador to Persia  In his progress to Cashmire the emperor was met by Chan Alum from his embassy to the court of Persia Jehangire after reflecting upon the contemptuous treatment which he had given to the Persian ambassador had resolved to remove any coldness which might arise on that account between the two empires He for that purpose had dispatched Chan Alum with magnificent presents to Shaw Abas of Persia This nobleman was received with every mark of respect The treaties between the two crowns were renewed and confirmed and the Persian loaded him with rich presents accompanying them with a letter of friendship to Jehangire without mentioning the injurious reception of his own minister at the Indian court  The great roads improved  Jehangire fond of making progresses through his extensive dominions made this year great additions to the convenience of travelling Considerable sums were issued from the treasury for mending the great roads of the empire Wells were dug at the end of every two miles and a building for the reception of wayfarers was erected near each well This improvement began on the road to Cashmire where Jehangire arrived in the beginning of the year He was highly pleased with that most beautiful province The principal valley of which it consists being much more elevated than the plains of India is cool and pleasant in the hottest season of the year A profound tranquillity reigning over all the empire Jehangire remained many months in Cashmire He went daily to the chace and wandered after a variety of rural pleasures over the face of that charming and flourishing country He did not return to Lahore till the month of Mohirrim of the year that succeeded his arrival at Cashmire  Disturbances in the Decan  The emperor had scarce arrived at Lahore when he received advices that the princes of the Decan who had engaged to pay a certain tribute had driven away by force the deputies who had been sent to receive it The refractory tributaries backed this violent measure with an army of sixty thousand horse They encamped at Ballapour The chiefs of the confederates were NizamulMuluc Adil Chan and Cuttub They were descended of the Mahommedan princes who at the fall of the Patan empire had assumed the state and independence of princes in the Decan  Shaw Jehin sent to quell the insurgents  Jehangire upon receiving this intelligence immediately dispatched Shaw Jehân to Agra He gave him a commission to command the Imperial army stationed in and near that city The prince did not continue long at Agra He marched on the twentieth of Siffer toward Brampour His force consisted of forty thousand horse Abdul Hussein an experienced officer was his second in command Letters came to the prince on his march from the Imperial governor of Mando that a considerable detachment of the enemy had crossed the Nirbidda and were laying waste the country Abdul Hussein was immediately detached against them with five thousand horse That general came up with the plunderers defeated them slew many on the spot and pursued the fugitives to the hills The prince himself continued his route to Brampour  The rebels reduced  Chan Chanan who commanded at Brampour was in a manner besieged in that city by the enemy They had traversed the provinces of Berâr and Chandeish and spread their devastations to the gates of Brampour The Imperialists recovered their spirit upon the prince's arrival with an army and the hopes of the insurgents began to vanish Some petty Rajas who had  joined the confederates took the first opportunity of throwing themselves at the feet of Shaw Jehân They were pardoned but obliged to pay the arrear of their tribute which amounted to fifty lacks The Mahommedan princes being deserted by the Hindoo Rajas their troops mutinied and dissentions rose in their councils They separated in disguist and despair each to his own territory Shaw Jehân divided his army into five parts and followed the rebels In the space of a few months without any considerable action he reduced the insurgents to their former obedience forcing them to pay the arrears of their tribute which was now settled at the annual sum of fiftyfive lacks of roupees  Chusero delivered into the hands of Shaw Jehân  When Shaw Jehân had received orders from his father to quell the disturbances in the Decan he requested that his brother the unfortunate prince Chusero might be put into his hands He had often made the same request before but to no effect Jehangire justly doubted his sincerity when he professed that it was a regard for a brother that induced him to wish to have Chusero in his possession He knew the ambition of Shaw Jehân he still had an affection for Chusero Asiph Jah even the favourite Sultana had gone into the views of Shaw Jehân but the emperor remained long inflexible Shaw Jehân for some time seemed to drop his designs He in the mean time grew daily in his father's esteem and Chusero declined in proportion as his brother rose When the alarming news from the Decan arrived at Lahore the emperor's hopes rested all on Shaw Jehân The artful prince in the critical moment renewed his request with regard to Chusero and he was delivered into his hands  The Sultana suspects his designs  Though NoorMâhil had been formerly in the interest of Shaw Jehân she had lately many reasons to alter her opinion concerning that prince Her penetrating eye had pierced the veil which  he had drawn over his designs She saw the great lines of ambition and an unrelenting perseverance in pursuit of power in all his conduct She communicated her suspicions to Jehangire she told him that Shaw Jehân must be curbed that he manifestly aspired to the throne that all his actions tended to gain popularity that his apparent virtues were hypocrisy and not the offspring of a generous and honest mind and that he waited but for a convenient opportunity to throw off the mask of deceitful duty and feigned allegiance The emperor was convinced but it was too late Chusero was already in the hands of Shaw Jehân and the latter was at the head of an army Silence now was prudence and a melancholy anxiety succeeded to condescending weakness  Character of Chusero  Chusero though popular on account of the beauty of his person and his misfortunes was a prince of a haughty disposition He was governed by furious passions His mind was in a perpetual agitation without pointing to any end He was now volatile and cheerful now dark and sullen He often laughed at misfortune he was often enraged at trifles and his whole conduct betrayed every mark of an insanity of mind His judgment was little his memory weak He always preferred the last advice having no power of mind to distinguish propriety no retention to make just comparisons His designs were therefore often illfounded his actions irresolute and undecisive and they always terminated in disgrace and ruin Yet he had something about him that commanded respect in the midst of his infirmities Nobody could look at his conduct without disgust none observed his manner or saw his person without regard and a kind of esteem Had he not been soured by misfortunes he was naturally of a generous and tender disposition but adversity  stopping up the current of his mind threw it out of its channel and he at last became indifferent concerning his own fate  He is assassinated  Shaw Jehân for some time affected to treat the unfortunate Chusero with attention and respect But this was a delusive gleam before a storm His designs were not yet ripe for execution To remove Chusero would be to no purpose till other obstacles to his own ambition were removed Fortune favoured his designs His success in the Decan raised his reputation the plunder of the enemy furnished the means of gaining for him the army They expressed their inviolable attachment to his person and views He threw off the mask at once He disregarded the mandates of the court of Agra and to complete his crimes he ordered the unfortunate Chusero to be assassinated by ruffians under the walls of Azere He assumed soon after the Imperial titles laying the foundation of his throne in a brother's blood  Manner of his death  Though all mankind were convinced that Shaw Jehân was accessary to the murder of Chusero he had taken previous measures to conceal the intended crime When he had quelled the insurrection in the Decan he became apparently melancholy and pretended to fall into a disease His friends were full of anxiety One only was in the secret and he began to insinuate that the prince had received intelligence that Jehangire had determined to raise Chusero to the throne He expatiated upon the uncertain fate of Shaw Jehân and upon the doubtfulness of their own fortune as connected with that prince One Raja Bandor a notorious villain understood the meaning of Shaw Jehân's friend In hopes of a reward he went at midnight to the tent of Chusero and pretending a message from the emperor he was admitted by the attendants of the prince without suspicion  He found him fast asleep and stabbed him to the heart The favourite wife of Chusero the daughter of the visier Chan Azem came to her husband's tent in the morning She found him cold in his blood she filled the camp and the neighbouring city of Azere with her cries She ran about distracted and called down the vengeance of God upon the murderers Shaw Jehân who had removed to the country for the benefit of the air returned upon the news of Chusero's death and shewed such apparent fymptoms of grief that he was believed for some time innocent of the murder  The emperorr enraged at the murder  The news of the death of Chusero came soon to the emperor's ears Retaining still some affection for his unfortunate son he was shocked at the murder and gave himself up to grief He suspected Shaw Jehân but common fame had not yet fixed the crime on that prince Jehangire wrote a public letter to him and his principal officers signifying that he was determined to make a strict and severe enquiry concerning the assassination and that he would punish the murderers with the utmost rigour He ordered the body to be dug up from the grave and examined He openly accused Shaw Jehân who finding himself discovered resolved to continue in his rebellion  Apology for Shaw Jehân  The author of the life of Shaw Jehân ascribes his rebellion to the violence and ambition of the favourite Sultana That woman says the writer finding that the health of the emperor declined was apprehensive that the crown would devolve on Shaw Jehân who had for some time been the determined enemy of her influence and power She therefore resolved to ruin the affairs of that prince and to fix the succession in the person of Shariâr the fourth son of Jehangire who was married to her own daughter by her former husband Shere Afkun Her  absolute dominion over the emperor obtained credit to her aspersions She actually procured a promise for an alteration of the succession and it was the certain intelligence of this circumstance continues his apologist that drove Shaw Jehân to extremes  He assumes the Imperial titles  Though Shaw Jehân's designs upon the throne were no secret he did not assume the Imperial titles till the twentyseventh of the second Jemmâd of the one thousand and thirtyfirst of the Higera He immediately with a numerous army took the route of Delhi where at that time his father resided The news of his march flew before him and reached the ears of Jehangire That monarch became anxious irresolute and perplexed and to complete the confusion in his councils advices were at the same time received that Shaw Abas king of Persia at the head of a great force had surprised Candahar The emperor was thunderstruck at this double intelligence of approaching misfortune The rebellious prince had the flower of the Imperial army under his command Jehangire as the last resort had recourse to policy Instead of arming for his own defence he diffembled his knowledge of his son's intentions He wrote him affectionate letters from day to day He praised his former actions He commended his present alacrity in coming so expeditiously to his aid against the Persian Shaw Jehân was not to be flattered out of his designs He saw through his father's policy and he gradually advanced but being overtaken by the rains he was obliged to halt some months at Mando the capital of the province of Malava  Is repulsed at Agra  Shaw Jehân in his march made the first hostile attempt upon the castle of Agra In that fortress was lodged a great part of the Imperial treasure Upon the news of the prince's departure from Mando the emperor sent Asiph Jah the visier to transport the  Asiph Jah the visier to transport the treasure from Agra to Lahore Etabâr Chan who commanded the fortress was unwilling to risk the treasure on the road as the news of Shaw Jehân's near approach was arrived The importunities of Asiph prevailed Etabâr with a party escorted the treasure some of the enemy appeared in view Etabâr immediately retired with his convoy to the castle of Agra and Asiph made the best of his way to Delhi Shaw Jehân immediately upon his arrival ordered the castle to be assaulted but Bickermajît who commanded the attack was so warmly received that he was glad to retire with the loss of five hundred men The prince enraged at this disappointment delivered up to plunder some of the nobility's houses at Agra and then took the rout of Delhi  His demands on his father  The prince having advanced formed his camp at Feridabâd The city of Delhi was alarmed the emperor perplexed A letter in the mean time was brought to him from his rebellious son Shaw Jehân demanded That the command of all the Imperial troops should be given to him without reserve that orders should be sent to the governors of the provinces to receive all their future instructions from his hands that permission should be given him to receive into his possession all the warlike stores that he should have access to the royal magazines and treasures to supply him with every necessary for carrying on the war against Persia and that the impregnable castle of Rentimpour should be placed in his hands as a place of security for his family against the machinations of the Sultana during his absence in the north  refused  Jehangire was enraged beyond measure at proposals which if granted would actually dethrone him His resentment and pride got the better of his temporizing timidity He issued out  an edict declaring his son a rebel should he not disband his army and return to his duty by a certain day Another edict confiscated all his estates by recalling the grants which had been given him for a magnificent subsistence The estates were conferred upon Sultan Shariâr who was at the same time invésted with a commission to carry on with the utmost vigour the Persian war Rustum Suffavi an experienced and able officer was placed next in command to the prince in the expedition Rustum was himself a Persian a near relation to Shaw Abas and deduced his paternal descent from the Imperial family of Suffvi  Preparations against him  The Imperial edicts made no impression on Shaw Jehân The emperor flew from the pen to the sword The troops stationed near the capital flocked to his standard others joined him from the provinces Asiph Jah and the Sultana had foreseen the storm and the adherents of the emperor were on their march to Delhi when the rebel prince was on his route from the Decan Jehangire in a few days saw forty thousand horse under his command Scarce ten thousand of these were of the standing force of the empire so that Shaw Jehân had still a manifest superiority  He endeavours to excuse his conduct  The river Jumna being in the dry season of the year fordable the emperor crossed it and both armies arrived at Belochpoor and remained some days in hourly expectations of a battle The prince in the mean time endeavoured to excuse his own conduct by affirming that he was driven to extremes by the intrigues of the Sultana against his power She carried he said all before her with the emperor and to throw disgrace upon him persuaded Jehangire to order him to the Persian war without the necessary supplies of money and warlike stores He therefore alleged that his demands had been made in so peremptory a  manner merely because he did not consider his father as a free agent swayed and commanded as he was by the pernicious counsels of a vindictive and ambitious woman These allegations lessened his crime in the eyes of the superficial and tended to strengthen in his army the attachment to his interest which he had purchased with donations  Distress of the emperor  The emperor was impatient to come to action with his son Asiph Jah the visier opposed this measure by affirming that it was imprudent to risque all with a small force while reinforcements were daily expected The emperor suspected his fidelity and he had some reason Asiph was said to have provided against all events by keeping up a correspondence with Shaw Jehân His enemies affirmed that it was his advice which hastened the prince from the Decan though this agrees but little with the preparations which Asiph had made against Shaw Jehân from foreseeing his rebellion Jehangire however believed his minister guilty He gave himself up to rage and despair  His dream  In the heat of his imagination upon the occasion he fell asleep in his tent He dreamed that he saw a pole fixed in the ground before the Imperial palace On the top of the pole which almost reached the skies a meteor seemed to play and to lighten the whole world with its splendor An elephant came from the west and overturned the pole The meteor fell and expired on the ground leaving the whole earth in profound darkness Jehangire started from his bed Naturally superstitious he foresaw some coming evil in his dream He related it in the morning to his Omrahs None ventured to interpret it and when they stood in silence in the presence a courier arrived with advice that Mohâbet Chan with all the forces of Punjâb was at the distance of a few miles from the Imperial camp This sudden  and unexpected reinforcement diffused an universal joy The emperor cried out That his dream was interpreted Mohâbet joined the army in the evening and private orders were immediately issued to the officers to prepare for action by the dawn of day  He prepares for battle  The Imperial army was in motion while yet it was dark and Shaw Jehân apprized of their march did not decline to engage He advanced apace The two armies came in sight of each other opposite to Tuglickabad The Imperialists were commanded in chief by Asiph Jah the visier who was posted in the center Mohâbet Chan had charge of the right wing Nawasis Chan of the left Abdalla commanded the advanced guards consisting of three thousand horse The Emperor himself stood behind the center and to encourage the generals sent to each some presents as a mark of his confidence and favour  The action begins  Some of the rebel lords who thought they were giving good advice to Shaw Jehân prevailed upon him not to expose his person in the field He retired to a small distance and Raja Bickermajît marshalled his troops in order of battle The Raja placed himself in the center Raja Bimé commanded the right Darab Chan the left wing The action was begun by the advanced guards on both sides Those of Shaw Jehân were defeated at the first onset by a strange accident Abdalla who commanded the advanced guard of the Imperialists spurring on his horse among the enemy with a few officers in the secret joined the rebels His troops mistaking their commander's perfidy for valour rushed forward to support him and having engaged the enemy hand to hand drove them back upon their own line  Shaw Jehân defeated  Asiph Jah took immediate advantage of the confusion occasioned by the flight of Shaw Jehân's advanced guard He pressed forward with the center of the Imperialists and came to action with Raja Bickermajît The shock was violent and the battle continued obstinate for some time Both the commanders exerted themselves to the utmost At length the fortune of Asiph prevailed Raja Bickermajît fell pierced through the head with an arrow The center of the rebels immediately fled and at that instant Mohâbet drove the left wing from the field Raja Bimé in the mean time pressed hard upon Nawasis Chan who commanded the right wing of the Imperialists The dust was so great that the contending armies were involved in darkness They felt for each other with their swords Nawasis was driven from the field Many of his officers were killed and some taken prisoners Raja Bimé imagining he was returning after a complete victory fell in with the troops of Asiph Jah They mixed undistinguished with each other Slaughter and confusion reigned Wounds were inflicted at random Chance governed all Every individual considered himself as in the midst of ten thousand foes The armies retreated to their camps The field was left to the dead  Circumstances  Both parties at first claimed the honour of the victory but the consequences declared it to belong to Jehangire Though both the emperor and Shaw Jehân had been kept out of the line at the beginning of the action by the assiduity of their friends when the battle became hot they mixed with their respective armies Bickermajît observing the emperor pressed forward to seize him but in the attempt was slain The spirit of the rebels fell with their leader Shaw Jehân presented himself to the runaways in vain Neither threats nor promises would do A panic had seized them and though the prince cried aloud That  he himself as good and as brave an officer as Bickermajît was alive they listened not as they passed and soon fled beyond the power of hearing  during the battle  Shaw Jehân became almost distracted with his misfortunes He resolved seriously to prevent future misery and distress by an immediate death His adherents however prevailed upon him to retreat He fled to the mountains of Mewat his army falling off as he fled Jehangire was the more astonished at his good fortune the more it was unexpected When the news of Abdalla's treachery was brought him he had given all over for lost He distrusted Asiph Jah and he sent a messenger to recal him from the front when that minister was upon the point of engaging the enemy Fortunately for the emperor the messenger did not come up to the visier till the affair was decided The latter obeyed Jehangire and brought him the news of victory  Sultan Purvez arrives in the camp  The battle was scarce decided when Sultan Purvez in consequence of his father's orders arrived from Allahabad in the Imperial camp Jehangire received him with an excess of joy The victory over his rebellious son had elevated his spirits and dissipated all his fears He sent his seraglio before him to Agra and raised Purvez under the tuition of Mohâbet to the command of the army Shaw Jehân in the mean time with a few adherents pursued his way to the Decan and Purvez was ordered to follow him with a considerable force The fugitive prince stopt with his adherents to refresh themselves at the river Genîva Purvez in the mean time came up a cannonade ensued and the Imperialists having forced their passage Shaw Jehân retreated with precipitation  Affairs in the Decan  We must for a moment lose sight of the prince in the misfortunes of his adherents The Emperor in his extreme affection for Shaw Jehân had while yet he remained in his duty submitted to his government an extensive division of the empire consisting of several provinces In that number was the rich kingdom of Guzerat Bickermajît who was slain in the action near Delhi had been governor of that province and when he joined the prince in his expedition against his father Suffvi Chan was left in the superintendency of Guzerat Abdalla whose perfidy in deserting his sovereign in the late battle we have already mentioned was rewarded by the prince for his treachery with the government vacant by the death of Bickermajît Unwilling to leave the prince in his distress Abdalla dispatches his friend Offâder Chan to command in the mean time in that province Offâder arriving with a small force at Ahmedabad the capital displaced Suffvi Chan the Imperial governor Suffvi fled to Hanksi He wrote from thence to Nasir the governor of Patan Understanding that Suffvi was no stranger to the march of Sultan Dawir Buxsh the son of Chusero under the tuition of his maternal grandfather Chan Azem to command for the emperor in Guzerat Nasir blamed him for his flight He met Suffvi with a force at Caperbenîz They resolved to march to Ahmedabad and setting forward in the evening they arrived next morning under the walls of the city Dividing their forces into three bodies each body attacked a gate The elephants broke them open the Imperialists entered and Offâder was seized  Shaw Jehân's party defeated in Guzerat  Shaw Jehân after the rencounter at the River Genîva fled to Mando the capital of Malava News was brought to him in that city that Guzerat was lost He was much affected but Abdalla made light of the matter That Omrah marched toward Ahmedabad with seven thousand horse When he arrived  at Wasset he found Suffvi now the Imperial Suba ready unexpectedly to receive him This lord finding that prince Dawir Buxsh and Chan Azem had lagged on their march provided himself with an army He posted his forces about twelve miles from Ahmedabad Abdalla endeavoured to turn his rear He was prevented by the vigilance of Suffvi and he therefore resolved to come to battle Dividing his army into three columns he advanced in that order upon the enemy Nasir Chan supported Suffvi with his courage and conduct The battle was obstinate Many officers of rank fell on the side of Abdalla He was routed with great slaughter He fled to Surat The country people cut off the greatest part of the shattered remains of his followers in their retreat He soon after with a few troops betook himself to Brampour  Purvez defeats Shaw Jehân at the Nirbidda  The prince Purvez and Mohâbet after the affair at the river Genîva returned to the Emperor who was encamped under the walls of Fattépour The disturbances in Guzerat convinced Jehangire that the flames of civil war could be only extinguished by the total ruin of Shaw Jehân He therefore ordered Purvez and Mohâbet at the head of the Rajaputs in the Imperial pay to pursue the rebel and to take him alive Shaw Jehân left Mando with a resolution to try his fortune in a battle He passed the river Nirbidda and threw up works to defend the ford He was by this time reduced to great distress His adherents gradually deserted him He became tired of hostilities which promised no success He sent to his brother Purvez for very moderate terms Purvez by the advice of Mohâbet amused him with hopes without coming to any determined point The usual precautions were neglected on the side of Shaw Jehân and Mohâbet who watched an opportunity crossed the river and surprized him in his camp He was defeated with great slaughter  Shaw Jehân flies to Orixa  Shah Jehân fled from the field through Golconda and then took the rout of Orixa to Bengal The governor of Orixa Ahmed Beg fled on the prince's approach That province was given to Kulli Chan one of Shaw Jehân's adherents whilst he himself advanced to Burdwan and took possession of that district He did not continue long at Burdwan Ibrahim governor of Bengal had collected all his forces to Raja Mâhil to oppose the unexpected invasion and Shaw Jehân marched toward the place  Enters Bengal and defeats the Suba  When the prince had arrived within a few miles of Raja Mâhil the Suba abandoned that fortress as untenable He retreated in good order to the fort of TelliaGurri which had been built to defend the pass between the mountains and the Ganges In the fort were a number of Europeans He strengthened them with a reinforcement of his best troops whilst he encamped his army on the opposite bank of the river Shaw Jehân upon his arrival invested the fort of TelliaGurri He made little impression the Europeans being excellent gunners and engineers He attempted to cross but was repulsed having but a few boats A neighbouring Raja however provided the prince with a fleet of boats and in these he transported two thousand horse Ibrahim finding that he was to be attacked in his camp crossed the river in his turn He drew up in order of battle against the prince but in the action his troops were defeated and he himself slain Bengal fell with the Suba from the empire Rumi the chief engineer of Shaw Jehân in the mean time found means to carry a mine under the fort of TelliaGurri and blew up about twenty yards of the rampire The place was taken by assault and the garrison put to the sword  Bengal submits  Shaw Jehân after this great and unexpected success attending his arms marched to Dacca where Ibrahim the late Suba had  deposited his own and the Imperial treasure He no sooner appeared before Dacca than it surrendered Forty lacks of roupees were found in specie besides jewels much spoil and warlike stores Dacca was the last place in Bengal that held out for the emperor The Rajas the hereditary governors of districts and all those who held estates of the crown crowded into the court of the prince and with presents and proffers of allegiance endeavoured to secure their possessions The whole kingdom received a new sovereign and Darab the son of Chan Chanan was raised to the high office of Suba under Shaw Jehân  and Behâr  The ambition of the prince was not to be confined to Bengal He turned his eyes upon the adjoining province of Behâr He scarce had permitted his army to breathe after the conquest of Dacca before he led them into Behâr Muchlis Chan the Imperial governor of that province fled to Allahabad at the approach of the prince The gates of Patna the capital were left open to receive him He kept his court in the Suba's palace The Zemindârs crowded from all quarters into the city made their submission and with presents obtained his favour But what was of greater consequence to the prince Mubârick governor of the impregnable fort of Rhotas which had never been taken by force came and presented to him the keys Shaw Jehân was exceedingly rejoiced at this piece of good fortune He had now a place of security for his family and he found his mind as alleviated from care sitter to encounter the dangers of the field and the vicissitudes of fortune  He divides his army into three parts  The prince having restored the civil government of Behâr which had been ruined by his invasion raised Nasir Chan to the office of Suba He himself took again the field He divided his army into three parts The first he placed under the command  of Abdalla who had been lately so unfortunate in Guzerat He ordered that officer to proceed to Allahabad with his division to drive away the Suba of Behâr from thence and to take possession of the place Deria Chan was placed by the prince over the second division That general was ordered to reduce the country round Jionpour The third division Shaw Jehân in person commanded He advanced by very slow marches to Benaris hearing complaints deciding causes and settling the government of the country as he went  Purvez advances toward him  Fortune hitherto favoured the arms of the rebellious prince Purvez with Mohâbet Chan had pursued the fugitives from the affair at the Nirbidda into the heart of Golconda At Hydrabad they gave over the pursuit and began to employ themselves in resettling the affairs of the Decan which the rebellion of Shaw Jehân had very much deranged The news of the loss of the eastern provinces alarmed Mohâbet Even Jehangire who passed his time in voluptuousness with his favourite NoorMâhil was rouzed from his lethargy He dispatched express after express to Purvez The march of Shaw Jehân toward the capital determined Mohâbet to endeavour to intercept him on his way He marched with Purvez through Malava and Behâr He crossed the Jumna at Calpé and the Ganges at Babere The Imperial army came up with Deria who commanded one of the three divisions of the rebels at Manicpour He was instantly defeated and he fell back to Benâris Abdalla at the same time evacuated Allahabad and joined Shaw Jehân A council of war was called Their deliberation was short They resolved to give immediate battle to Purvez and Mohâbet  Preparations for action  The resolution was scarce taken when the Imperialists appeared in sight No time was to be lost Shaw Jehân drew up  his army on the banks of a brook called Tonish Abdalla commanded the right wing Nasir Chan the left the prince himself took his post in the center The advanced guards were commanded by Raja Bimè and the whole field was marshalled by Sujait Chan who was at the head of the reserve in the rear The artillery under the direction of Rumi was drawn up in one place before the center instead of being disposed properly along the line The army of the rebels exceeded forty thousand horse the Imperalists were more in number  The army of Shaw Jehân  Mohâbet in the mean time was not idle He formed in order of battle the army of Prince Purvez His superiority in point of numbers enabled him to outflank the enemy The particulars of his disposition are not relatedThe action was begun by the artillery on the side of Shaw Jehân But more than a thousand shot were expended before one took place the enemy being yet at too great a distance Mohâbet would not permit his artillery to play till he was sure of doing execution The cannonade continued near an hour Some of Rumi's guns were dismounted his men were driven from others Shaw Jehân immediately ordered his advanced guard to charge a body of the Imperialists who were coming forward with hasty strides to seize his artillery The two advanced parties fought with great bravery Those of Shaw Jehân at length gave ground Raja Bimè who commanded them preferred death to flight He stood with a few gallant friends and was cut to pieces  totally defeated  Mohâbet observing the defeat of the enemy's advanced guard came forward briskly with his whole line and fell with great sury on the center where Shaw Jehân commanded in person The shock was violent but did not last The prince was driven back from his guns which were seized by Mohâbet Sujait Chan  who commanded the reserve of the rebels threw himself into the interval left by Shaw Jehân's retreat He fought for some time with great bravery and furnished the prince with an opportunity of rallying his broken squadrons But Sujait was in his turn defeated and driven back in great confusion Shaw Jehân advanced to the charge but advice was brought him that Nasir was defeated on the left and that some of the enemy who had passed his flanks were seen advancing in his rear  His bravery  The desperate situation of the prince suggested to him a desperate resolution He advanced as if he heard not the messenger and plunged into the thickest of the enemy He was followed by five hundred horse This small body devoting themselves to death with their leader were irresistible They effected more by despair than the whole army had done by courage Mohâbet received a check when he least expected it He began to retreat but Shaw Jehân was not properly supported His officers considered the battle as lost and refused to advance Abdalla who had hitherto maintained his ground on the right received a message from the prince He returned for answer that all hopes of victory were gone and that the best retreat they could make was now the only thing left them by fortune The prince was enraged He resolved to die His companions seizing his horse by the reins forced him from the field He fled not but he was carried to the fort of Rhotas The rich plunder of his camp saved him from being pursued  He flies toward the Decan  Sultan Purvez and Mohâbet having stopt for a few days to refresh their army after the fatigues of a long march and an obstinate battle took the route of Bengal Shaw Jehân left his family in the fortress of Rhotas He collected the remains of his defeated army He marched to Patna and prepared to defend that city He however  evacuated the place at the approach of his brother He fled through Bengal Purvez was close at his heels Shaw Jehân took the route of the Decan by the way of Cuttack Bengal Behâr and Orixa fell into the hands of Purvez That prince and Mohâbet spent some time in resettling the government of the three provinces and when the current of regulation and law was restored to its ancient channel they marched after Shaw Jehân into the Decan by the northern road  Besieges Brampour  Though Shaw Jehân's affairs were to all appearance ruined he found resources in his own active mind During the time that Purvez and Mohâbet remained in the recovered provinces he found means to attach to his party the Raja of Ambere By the junction of the Raja's forces he found himself in a condition to sit down before the city of Brampour He had reduced it to great distress when the Imperial army under Purvez and Mohâbet arrived on the banks of the Nirbidda He had not a force sufficient to oppose them he raised the siege and took shelter in the mountains of Ballagat In his retreat he made an attempt on the castle of Hasser This is a strong fortress on the frontiers of Chandeish It stands upon the top of a mountain it has springs of water and of good soil a sufficiency to maintain with its produce four thousand men As all access to the fortress is impracticable he might have waited there for the change which time might make in his fortunes He was repulsed  His affairs ruined  This latter piece of bad success completed the ruin of his party His nobles first deserted him and they were followed by the private soldiers A thousand horse only remained His spirits sunk within him his misfortunes oppressed him his guilt and folly were always present to his mind Sickness was added to his other miseries He was hunted like a wild beast from place to  place All mankind were his enemies and he was their foe Where he thought he could not overcome he fled he spread devastation through places where he could prevail He was however tired of rapine worn down by contention and hostility He wrote letters of compunction to his father He enlarged on his own guilt he even added if possible to his own wretchedness and misfortune Jehangire was often full of affection he was always weak He was shocked at the miserable condition of a son whom he once had loved His tears fell upon the part of Shaw Jehân's letter which mentioned guilt and his crimes vanished from memory  He is pardoned  In the midst of this returning softness Jehangire was not altogether void of policy He wrote to his son that if he would give orders to the governors of Rhotas of Azere and other places which were still held out in his name to deliver up their forts and send his three sons Dara Aurungzebe and Murâd to court and at the same time accompany them he would be forgiven for his past crimes Shaw Jehân embraced the offer with joy He delivered up the forts he sent his children to Agra He however found various pretences for not appearing in person at court He alleged that he was ashamed to see a father whom he had so much injured but he was actually afraid of the machinations of the favourite Sultana He made excursions under a pretence of pleasure through all parts of the empire attended by five hundred horse He was sometimes heard of at Ajmere sometimes at Tata on the Indus and again in the Decan  Candahar lost to the empire  In the rebellion of Shaw Jehân we lost sight of the Persian invasion under Shaw Abas The sovereigns of Persia had long laid claim to the city of Candahar They endeavoured often to  obtain it by negociation and often by force They had failed in the first and they were not successful in the latter till the civil distractions of India furnished them with an undisturbed opportunity of besieging the place When the Persian invasion happened Candabar was but slightly garrisoned The place however held out with vigour till Shaw Abbas appeared before it in person It surrendered to that monarch and the news of the misfortune met Rustum Suffavi at Lahore as he was on his march to relieve the besieged The Persians after the capture of Candahar retreated and Jehangire having occasion for all his troops to quell domestic disturbances sat silently down with the loss  Irruption of the Usbecks  Shaw Abas had scarce retreated when the Usbeck Tartars encouraged by his success and the civil dissentions in Hindostan invaded the province of Ghizni and took several small forts When the news of this invasion arrived at court Chanazâd the son of Mohâbet was sent from Cashmire with some troops to oppose the invaders This young officer attacked them with vigour on all occasions and in general with great success They were at length after an obstinate and bloody war which continued nine months driven out of the empire The conqueror pursued the fugitives and laid waste a part of their country  CHAP V  Mohâbet in favourAccused of intended treasonOrdered to courtMachinations of his enemiesIndignities offered himHe

sentiments of gratitude in the breast of Jehangire His son Channa Zâd had been lately gratified with the government of Cabul and others his relations and friends were advanced to lucrative and honourable employments The great victory near Benâris confirmed the emperor's high opinion of Mohâbet and the news of that important event filled him with excessive joy His grateful feelings for his general rose in proportion to the decrease of his fears for his throne These sentiments however did not long continue Mohâbet had a great many enemies his sovereign had but little firmness The abilities of the former had raised envy and nature had given to the latter a disposition too easy and pliant to be proof against misrepresentation To explain the causes of an event which almost transferred the empire from the house of Timur to other hands we must look back to some circumstances prior to this period  Accused of intended treason  Chan Chanan mentioned as the tutor of Purvez in his government of Candeish had through some disgust attached himself to the fortunes of Shaw Jehân when that prince succeeded his brother in the command of the Imperial army in the Decan It was by that lord's advice that he cut off Chusero by his advice he rebelled against his father He accompanied the prince in his expedition to Agra and Delhi and though he took no part in the fatigues of the field he ruled in the cabinet When the affairs of Shaw Jehân became desperate after his retreat to the Decan he advised him to sue for a pardon through his brother Purvez He himself undertook to be his messenger to Purvez to whose temper and character he could have been no stranger When he arrived in the Imperial camp he found no disposition in Mohâbet to relinquish by terms the advantages which had been obtained by the sword Having failed in his endeavours for the prince he applied for himself Mohâbet was shocked at this reiteration of treachery and he persuaded Purvez to throw him and his family into prison The latter were sent under an escort to Agra he himself was detained in close confinement in the camp and his estate was confiscated by an Imperial edict  The grounds of the accusation  After the decisive battle near Benâris the province of Bengal which had been reduced by Shaw Jehân fell at once into the hands of the conquerors Purvez who had a commission from his father to govern the eastern provinces conferred the subaship of Bengal upon Mohâbet who sent his son Channa Zâd lately arrived in the army to manage his government in his own absence Dara the son of Chan Chanan had been made suba of Bengal by Shaw Jehân That young lord was seized by the people and delivered into the hands of Channa Zâd as soon as he arrived at the capital of the province He immediately sent  Dara to his father who having informed the emperor of that circumstance received orders to put him to death as an obstinate rebel Mohâbet obeyed and sent the unfortunate suba's head to Agra  His enemies at court  Chan Chanan though confined in the camp of Purvez found means by letters to insinuate himself into the good graces of the Sultana and her brother the visier The two last had been long the enemies of Mohâbet and the former imputed the death of his son to that lord and was resolved to revenge the injury He wrote to the Sultana he sent letters to Asiph He informed them that Mohâbet was forming designs to raise Purvez to the throne This was carried to the emperor's ears He ordered Chan Chanan to be released and that Omrah who remained with Purvez accused Mohâbet by letters to the emperor of intended treason  The emperor alarmed  Jehangire naturally suspicious was alarmed The spirit of jealousy and distrust took possession of his mind He forgot the services of Mohâbet in his own fears He ordered him to court and raised Chan Jehân Lodi from the government of Guzerat to the command of the army under Purvez Mohâbet before the emperor's orders arrived had set out with Purvez for Bengal He had been guilty of a neglect which gave colour to the accusations of his enemies The elephants taken in battle are Imperial property These he had retained together with the presents which his son Channa Zâd had received in resettling the province A second peremptory order was sent to him He was acquainted that he was appointed to the subaship of Punjâb but that the emperor deprived him of Lahore which had been usually annexed to that government He was thunderstruck at the sudden change in the emperor's mind He resolved to obey He went to take his leave of Purvez The  prince was cold and stately and seemed to forget his friend in the displeasure of his father  Mohâbet commanded to court  Sensible of his own abilities conscious of his honour elevated by his reputation in war Mohâbet was disgusted beyond measure at this return for his services He resolved to retire to his castle of Rintimpour but an order arrived to deliver that fortress into the hands of one of the Sultana's creatures This latter circumstance confirmed what his friends at court had written to him before that his life was in danger should he trust himself in the Imperial presence He wrote to Jehangire He expressed his astonishment at his displeasure He declared his perfect confidence in the honour of his prince but he expressed his wellgrounded distrust of his advisers The letter produced nothing but an order for his immediate appearance at court To refuse was to rebel He wrote again to the emperor  "I will" says he "serve my sovereign with my life against his enemies but I will not expose it to the malice of his friends Assure me of safety and I will clear myself in the presence"  Jehangire upon receiving this letter was enraged He dispatched a courier with his last commands for his appearance He at length resolved to obey Five thousand Rajaputs in the Imperial pay from an affection for their general offered him their service to conduct him to court Escorted by these he took the rout of Lahore where the emperor at the time resided  He obeys  On the eighteenth of April Jehangire set out from Lahore toward Cabul News was brought to the Imperial camp that Mohâbet had sent before him the elephants taken at the battle of Benâris and that he himself followed with a retinue of five thousand Rajaputs The Sultana and the visier were struck with a double terror They were afraid of a reconciliation  they were afraid of his force They persuaded the emperor not to admit him into the camp When therefore he arrived near the tents he was ordered to stop till he accounted for the revenues of Bengal and the plunder taken at the battle of Benâris Mohâbet was enraged he dispatched his soninlaw to the emperor to complain of an indignity so unworthy of his fidelity and services He could not have chosen a worse messenger The emperor had been much offended with Mohâbet for giving his daughter in marriage without his consent and he had resolved to be revenged When therefore the young lord alighted from his elephant in the Imperial square he was suddenly seized he was stript of his clothes covered with rags bastinadoed and sent out of the camp riding backward on a sorry jade amid the shouts of the whole army  His messenger grossly affronted  The intelligence of this gross affront came to Mohâbet before the dishonoured youth appeared He bore it with seeming patience He was shocked at the weakness of the emperor which had yielded so much to the malice of a vindictive woman He separated by degrees his retinue from the camp He found he could not trust himself in the hands of his enemies and he took at once a bold resolution The emperor was on his march to Cabul and he resolved to watch his motions He hovered during the night round the skirts of the camp and the morning presented a favourable opportunity for the execution of his scheme  He surprises the emperor in his tent  When Mohâbet arrived the Imperial army lay encamped on the banks of the Behat or Gelum at the end of the bridge on the highroad which led to Cabul The advanced guard began to move over the bridge in the morning and was gradually followed by the other troops The emperor remained in the old  camp He was not in an enemy's country and he used no precautions When the greatest part of the army had passed Mohâbet suddenly advanced with his faithful Rajaputs He seized the bridge and set it on fire leaving two thousand of his men under the command of his son to defend the flames and to stop the return of the enemy Having made this disposition he rode with great speed to the Imperial square He was first observed by the officers of the household passing by the haram in seeming disorder His countenance was pale but determined They were alarmed and he rushed forward to the emperor's tent  takes him  The writer of the Acbal Namma who was then lord of the wardrobe suspecting that Mohâbet meant to assassinate the emperor drew his sword and followed him with great speed The Omrahs in waiting did the same When they had advanced to the Imperial tent they found Mohâbet surrounded by five hundred Rajaputs on foot standing at the door with swords by their sides and pikes in their hands The lords were immediately seized and disarmed The emperor hearing the noise and confusion without cut his way through the screens and entered the bathingtent which was behind his sleeping apartment Mohâbet alighted and entered not finding the emperor he pressed forward with forty Rajaputs to the bathingtent Some of the Imperial guards stood at the door The officer who commanded them sternly asked Mohâbet Why he presumed to intrude on the emperor's privacy He answered him by putting his hand upon his sword and frowning upon him with a determined countenance A panic seized the guards They made way for him to pass In the outer apartment of the bathingtent stood many Omrahs of high rank They drew their swords but the Rajaputs surrounding them they thought proper to deliver up their arms  prisoner  The news of this insult was carried to the emperor by some of the women who attended him in the inner tent He seized his sword and was about to assault Mohâbet when he saw his guards and nobles disarmed He dropt his point and said  "What dost thou mean Mohâbet Chan"  Mohâbet touching the ground and then his forehead with his hand thus replied  "Forced by the machinations of my enemies who plot against my life I throw myself under the protection of my sovereign"    "You are safe"answered the emperor "but what would these who stand armed behind you"    "They want full security" rejoined Mohâbet "for me and my family and without it they will not retire"  "I understand you" said Jehangire "name your terms and they shall be granted But you do me an injustice Mohâbet I did not plot against your life I knew your services though I was offended at your seeming disobedience to my commands Be assured of my protection I shall forget the conduct which necessity has imposed upon you"  and carries him  Mohâbet without naming his conditions observed to the emperor that it was now time to take his daily amusement of hunting Without waiting for a reply he ordered his own horse to be brought Jehangire declined mounting him Mohâbet seemed not to listen  "Then Mohâbet Chan" said the emperor "if still I have a horse of my own I will mount him"  One was brought him They rode slowly away together surrounded by the Rajaputs When they had advanced beyond the skirts of the camp Mohâbet observed to the emperor That it would be prudent for him to mount an elephant to avoid any accident that might happen in the confusion which was likely to ensue Jehangire had now no will of his own He mounted the elephant and three Rajaputs under a pretence of defending him mounted by his side  to his own camp  The emperor had scarce placed himself on the elephant when Muckirrib Chan one of the officers of state pressing through the Rajaputs climbed up the elephant's side and sat down by his sovereign He was threatened by the Rajaputs He was obstinate and would not stir One slightly cut him on the forehead with his sabre but he was not to be moved They had now proceeded near a mile from the camp when some of the officers of the household mounted upon elephants came up and placed themselves on the road before the emperor Mohâbet ordered them to clear the way they refused and were cut to pieces He then continued his rout without further obstruction to his own camp The emperor was brought to his tent and all spectators being removed Mohâbet explained himself to him protesting that he had formed no designs neither against his life nor his power  "But" concluded he sternly "I am determined to be safe"  Cuts off Sujait Chan  Asiph the visier had crossed the bridge in the morning with the Imperial army The Sultana when Mohâbet was busy in securing the person of the emperor made her escape to her brother He considered that nothing was done so long as that haughty woman remained out of his power He resolved to prosecute his plan with the same resolute boldness with which it was begun He returned with the emperor to his former camp on the bank of the Gelum Sujait Chan an Omrah of high reputation had arrived that instant to join the Imperial army He knew the situation of affairs and loudly inveighed in the presence of the Rajaputs against Mohâbet That lord was at once enraged and alarmed He ordered his troops to fall upon Sujait and his retinue and every man of them was put to the sword The other Omrahs who had hitherto hovered  round struck with the fate of Sujait fled across the river and joined the Imperial army  The visier determines to rescue the emperor  NoorJehân was the messenger of the disaster which befel the emperor to her brother Asiph He immediately called the Omrahs together and the Sultana vehemently accused those who had been left with Jehangire of negligence and cowardice A debate arose about the best method of rescuing their sovereign out of the hands of Mohâbet The measure was full of peril but it must be taken They agreed to assemble their forces by the dawn of next morning and to endeavour to repass the river against the rebel The emperor was apprized of their intentions He began to fear for his life Repeated messages were sent to the visier to desist from his purpose but that minister did not think himself obliged to obey the commands of an imprisoned monarch who was under the influence of the man who had seized his person  But is defeated  Asiph begun his march with day When he came to the bridge he found it burnt down He resolved to ford the river but the water was so deep that many were drowned Those who gained the further shore had to fight the enemy at a manifest disadvantage They were cut off as fast as they ascended the bank A succession of victims came to the swords of the Rajaputs The action continued for some hours The rear of the Imperialists pressing into the river prevented the front from retreating The Sultana was not a tame spectator on the occasion Mounted on an elephant she plunged into the stream with her daughter by her side The young lady was wounded in the arm but her mother pressed forward Three of her elephantdrivers were successively killed and the elephant received three wounds on the trunk NoorJehân in the mean time emptied  four quivers of arrows on the enemy The Rajaputs pressed into the stream to seize her but the master of her household mounting the elephant turned him away and carried her out of the river notwithstanding her threats and commands  with great slaughter  Whilst these things happen in the river Fidai Chan and Abul Hassen with some other gallant nobles forming a squadron of gentlemen in the rear of the Imperialists plunged into the river and gained the opposite shore The shock between them and the Rajaputs was violent The latter gave way and fled toward the tents of the prince Shariâr where the emperor remained under a guard They stopt and the action became bloody The arrows and shot piercing through the tents the emperor was in imminent danger but Muchlis Chan who stood near him covered him with shields In the mean time Mohâbet reestablished the ranks of the fugitives behind the tents He turned them and fell upon the flank of the Imperialists Visier Bec Attalla and several gallant lords were killed Fidai was covered with wounds The spirit of his followers began to sink Mohâbet pressed hard upon them and at length they fled The sield was covered with dead bodies and a complete victory remained to the Rajaputs  and taken prisoner  The runaways gaining the opposite side of the river found their troops diminished and completely ruined They gave up all thoughts of further resistance each fled to his own home The army in the space of a few hours was dissipated Asiph fled to his estate and shut himself up with five hundred men in the castle of New Rhotas on the Attoc The Sultana found means to escape to Lahore Mohâbet dispatched a messenger to Asiph with assurances of safety should he return to the camp The visier would not trust himself in his hands Meer Berwir  the son of Mohâbet with a detachment besieged the fort of Rhotas Asiph was soon reduced to distress and on the arrival of Mohâbet before the place that lord with his son Abu Talib  The Sultana seized  surrendered at discretion NoorJehân had scarce returned to Lahore when she received letters from the emperor He acquainted her that he was treated with respect by Mohâbet and that matters were amicably settled between them He conjured her therefore as she regarded his peace and safety to lay aside all thoughts of hostile preparations He concluded with commanding her to follow him to Cabul whither of his own free choice he then directed his march NoorJehân did not long hesitate She set out from Lahore and soon came up with her lord When she arrived troops were sent out by Mohâbet by way of doing her honour But they were her keepers and not her guards They surrounded her tent and watched all her motions  Condemned to death  Mohâbet who carried every thing before him in the presence accused her publicly of treason He affimed that she had conspired against the emperor by estranging from him the hearts of his subjects that the most cruel and unwarrantable actions had been done by her capricious orders in every corner of the empire that her haughtiness was the source of public calamities her malignity the ruin of many individuals that she had even extended her views to the empire by favouring the succession of Shariâr to the throne under whose feeble administration she hoped to govern India at pleasure He therefore insisted that a public example should be made of so wicked a woman as a sign to mankind that crimes in the most exalted persons ought to meet with no more favour than iniquities in the mean and low  "You who are emperor of the Moguls" said Mohábet addressing himself to Jehangire "whom we look upon as something more than  human ought to follow the example of God who has no respect for persons"  Saved at the request of the emperor  Jehangire was too well acquainted with his situation to contradict Mohâbet He owned the justice of the accusation and he signed a warrant for her death Being excluded from his presence her charms had lost their irresistible influence over him and when his passions did not thwart the natural bias of his mind he was always just The dreadful message was delivered to the Sultana She heard it without emotion  "Imprisoned sovereigns" said she "lose their right to life with their freedom but permit me for once to see the emperor and to bathe with my tears the hand that has fixed the seal to the warrant of death"  She was brought before her husband in the presence of Mohâbet Her beauty shone with additional lustre through her sorrow She uttered not one word Jehangire burst into tears  "Will you not spare this woman Mohâbet" said the emperor "you see how she weeps"    "The emperor of the Moguls" replied Mohâbet "should never ask in vain"  The guards retired from her at a wave of his hand and she was restored that instant to her former attendants  March to Cabul  The friends of Mohâbet disapproved of his generosity and he had cause to repent of it himself The Sultana lived not to thank her forgiver but to revenge herself The Imperial camp moved to Cabul Mohâbet without appearing to command directed every thing at court The emperor implicitly followed his advice and he even seemed to harbour no resentment against him for the past He had long known his abilities he was now convinced of his integrity and generosity Naturally fond of indolence and pleasure himself he could not wish to have left the affairs of the state in better hands The attention paid him by  Mohâbet eradicated every idea of bondage and the weight which his edicts carried from their precision and wisdom reconciled his situation to his pride by the obedience which was paid to them over all the empire  Designs of the Sultana against Mohabet  Six months had passed in Cabul in an apparent harmony between the monarch and his minister The busy spirit of NoorJehân was in the mean time hatching mischief She concealed her schemes so effectually that they escaped the penetrating eyes of Mohâbet The emperor resided in his palace at Cabul the minister lay every night in the camp of his Rajaputs without the walls When he came one morning to pay his respects at court with his retinue the citizens at the instigation of the Sultana attacked him from both ends of a narrow street Some posted in windows on either side fired upon him with musquets He turned back and forced his way to his camp He arrived among the Rajaputs unhurt his followers were all either wounded or slain The citizens did not rest here They fell upon the guards which he had placed round the emperor and put five hundred to the sword  defeated  Mohâbet enraged at the perfidy of the Cabulians prepared to take ample revenge He blocked up the city with his army The massacre within was discontinued Fear succeeded to rage The principal inhabitants laying the whole blame upon the rabble came out in the most suppliant manner to Mohâbet Jehangire who disclaimed all knowledge of the tumult interceded for them and the enraged minister spared the city after having punished the most notorious ringleaders of the insurgents He however declared that he would never enter the perfidious city of Cabul he gave directions to the emperor to quit it the next  day and having made the necessary preparations the Imperial camp moved in a few days toward Lahore  Mohâbet resigns his power  On the way to Lahore Mohâbet took a sudden resolution to throw up his power He had no intentions himself upon the empire and he had triumphed over his enemies and served his friends He exacted and obtained from Jehangire the most solema promises of oblivion for the past and he restored that prince to all his former consequence and power He promised to assist him with his advice and to shew his sincerity he dismissed the greatest part of his guards and attendants This conduct was noble but he had gone too far to retreat Gratitude is not so strong a passion as revenge The weak forget savours but the haughty never forgive indignities The Sultana kept fresh in her memory her disgrace she remembered her danger from Mohâbet She applied to Jehangire for his immediate death She urged specious arguments to strengthen her request  "A man" said she "who is so daring as to seize the person of his soveraign is a dangerous subject The lustre of royalty must be diminished continued the Sultana in the eyes of the people whilst he who pulled his prince from the throne is permitted to kneel bef  re it with feigned allegiance"  Jehangire was shocked at her proposal He commanded her to be silent  H  i  obliged to    She was silent but she did not drop her design She resolved to take off by private treachery the man whom she failed to bring to a public death She contrived to place one of her cunuchs behind the curtain with orders to shoot Mohâbet when he should next come to pay his respects in the presence Jehangire overheard her commands to the slave He acquainted Mohâbet with the snare laid for his life insinuating that his power was not  to protect him from private treachery though he was  resolved to save him from public disgrace Mohâbet was alarmed He escaped from the camp The army lay that day on the banks of the Gelum in the very spot where the emperor had seven months before been seized Mohâbet after having the whole power of the empire in his hands was obliged to fly from that very place without a single attendant He carried nothing with him but his life his wealth was left in the Imperial camp and became the property of NoorJehân His flight had scarce become public when an edict was issued by the Sultana's procurement to all the governors of provinces to make diligent search for him He was declared a rebel and a reward was put upon his head  His conference  Asiph disapproved of his sister's violence He knew the merit of Mohâbet he was not forgetful of his kindness to himself when under his power He was tired besides of the weakness of Jehangire and of the Sultana's tyranny He however observed a cautious silence His power depended upon his sister and she was haughty as well as vindictive Mohâbet flew from place to place He took at first the route of Tatta but the unfortunate have enemies every where The boldness which had lately raised him to the summit of power forsook him not in his distress He mounted his horse and rode solitary near four hundred miles to throw himself into the conversation of Asiph That minister at the time was in the Imperial camp at Karnal on the road between Lahore and Delhi Mohâbet in a mean habit entered the camp when it was dark and about nine o'clock placed himself in the passage which led from the apartments of Asiph to the Haram The cunuch who stood at the door questioned Mohâbet He knew that lord by his voice but he assured him of his sidelity Mohâbet told him that he wished  to speak to his lord on affairs of the last moment The visier came  with Asiph  When Asiph saw the low condition into which he who lately commanded the empire was fallen he could scarce refrain from tears He took him in his arms they retired in silence to a secret place Mohâbet after mentioning the ingratitude of NoorJehân complained of the imbecillity of the emperor and plainly told the visier that low as he was reduced he was determined to raise up another sovereign in India  "Purvez" continued Mohâbet "is a virtuous man and my friend But he is easy and pliant and we must not change one weak prince for another I know the merit of Shaw Jehân I have fought against him and when I conquered I gained not a victory but my own life He suits the times He is ambitious and sometimes severe but he will aggrandize the empire abroad and add vigour and precision to the laws at home"  Asiph was overjoyed at this declaration He was connected in friendship as well as in affinity with Shaw Jehân  "You must go hence with speed" said Asiph "and I will endeavour to procure your pardon The emperor who is not averse to you will listen to my request especially as Shaw Jehân with whom you alone are able to cope in the field is in arms I shall procure for you an army which you shall use as the circumstances of the time will demand"  in favour of Shaw Jehân  The two Omrahs having sworn fidelity to one another parted Mohâbet mounting his horse dived into the night Asiph went into the presence The emperor was much alarmed at the news from the Decan that his rebellious son had collected an army He regretted the loss of Mohâbet and Asiph took that opportunity of suing for his pardon The emperor in the warmth  of his zeal against his son ordered an edict of indemnity to be forthwith issued which restored Mohâbet to his honours and estates A commission was given him to command the army against Shaw Jehân and the ceremony of giving thanks in the presence was dispensed with in his favour as he could not trust his life to the mercy of NoorJehân  Death of Purvez  An event however happened which rendered these preparations against Shaw Jehân unnecessary That prince desisted from his new enterprize without the interposition of force When Mohâbet carried all before him at court his friend and pupil the prince Purvez remained at the head of the army and commanded all the eastern and southern provinces in great tranquillity He took no notice of his father's confinement and he used no means for his releasement He knew that Mohâbet had no designs upon the empire and he was rather pleased with a check upon the emperor which might prove an excuse to himself from being bound by his commands In the midst of the insensibility and tranquillity of Purvez he was seized by an apoplexy which carried him off in the thirtyeighth year of his age  His character  Sultan Purvez was one of those harmless men that pass without either envy or fame through life Destitute of those violent passions which agitate the animated and ambitious he was never completely happy nor thoroughly miserable Ease was his only comfort toil his sole aversion Though battles were gained in his name he was rather an incumbrance to an army than the spring which should move the whole Without ambition to command he thought it no indignity to obey He approved of the counsel of others without ever proposing his own He was in short an useful engine in the hands of an able general There was a kind of comity in his manner which commanded  respect where he impressed no awe and even men who knew his weakness listened with attention to his commands His constitution was feeble and lethargic his life a perpetual slumber Had he lived he was destined for the throne and as he had no passions to gratify the happiness or misery of his reign would depend on those whom chance might place around him His death was regretted more perhaps than that of an abler man might have been He never committed injuries and mankind gave him credit for benevolence Mohâbet mourned him as a goodnatured friend Jehangire as a dutiful son The contrast which the character of his brother presented justified the sentiments of both  Affairs at Court and in the Decan  When Mohâbet fled NoorJehân governed the empire without controul While yet he held the reins of government he had sent orders to his son ChannaZâd Suba of Bengal to send him the surplus of the revenues of that country Twentytwo lacks under an escort were advanced as far as Delhi when the flight of Mohâbet happened and the same messenger who brought the news of the treasure to the emperor brought him also intelligence of the death of Purvez Jehangire was affected beyond measure at the loss of his son he never had disobeyed his commands and his manner was naturally engaging and pleasingThe command of the army devolved upon Chan Jehân Lodi He was ordered to send his family to court as hostages for his faithAn unexpected war furnished a field for the abilities of Lodi The Nizam raised disturbances but he was reduced without battle to terms  Death of Chan Chanan  Chan Chanan who after his release from confinement had remained with Purvez in the camp did not long survive that prince He attained to the seventysecond year of his age and though in his latter days he was accused of treachery he had  covered the former part of his life with renown He performed many memorable actions under the emperor Akbar He reduced the kingdom of Guzerat he defeated with twenty thousand horse an army of seventy thousand under the confederate princes of the Decan He was a scholar as well as a soldier He was the most learned man of his time shrewd in politics eloquent to a proverb He translated the commentaries of the emperor Baber into the Persic from the Mogul language He understood the Arabic the Pehlvi and all the dialects of India He was also a good poet and many of his pieces have come down to our time In abilities he yielded not to his father the famous Byram though he possessed not his integrity and unsullied virtue  CHAP VI  Schemes of Mohâbet and AsiphDeath of the emperorHis characterAnecdotes of his private

JehangireState of Persia  Schemes of Mohâbet  MOHABET after his conference with Asiph made the best of his way to the dominions of the Rana He had been recommended by letters from the visier to that prince and he was received with extraordinary marks of distinction A circumstance omitted in its place will contribute to throw light on the sequel A correspondence by writing between Mohâbet and Asiph would be a measure full of peril to both They had resolved to seize upon the accidents that might arise in the course of time for the service of Shaw Jehân The visier was to be the judge as having the best access to know the period fit for their purpose from his residence at court and intimate knowledge of its affairs Mohâbet left a ring in his hands which when it should be sent was the signal for him to espouse openly the interests of the prince  Death of the emperor  The edict of indemnity to Mohâbet had scarce been promulgated when that lord understood from court that the emperor  began to decline visibly in his health The prospect of his approaching dissolution rendered it unnecessary to wrest from him by force a scepter which he was soon to resign to death Mohâbet remained quiet with the Rana who holding a friendly correspondence with Shaw Jehân took an opportunity of informing that prince that his noble guest was no enemy to his causeJehangire had for seven years been troubled with a slight asthma His disorder increased toward the end of the preceding year and he resolved to make a progress to Cashmire for the benefit of the air The autumn proved very severe in that elevated country He was seized with a violent cold which fell upon his lungs The sharpness and purity of the air rendered his breathing difficult He complained of a kind of suffocation and became impatient  Oct th  under his disorder He commanded the camp to move with slow marches toward Lahore He was carried in a litter as far as the town of Mutti which stands about half way on the road from Cashmire At Mutti his difficulty of breathing increased He was growing worse every day and the army halted On the ninth of November of the year he expired having lived fiftyeight and reigned twentytwo lunar years and eight months  His character  Jehangire was neither vicious nor virtuous in the extreme His bad actions proceeded from passion and his good frequently from whim Violent in his measures without cruelty merciful without feeling proud without dignity and generous without acquiring friends A slave to his pleasures yet a lover of business destitute of all religion yet full of superstition and vain fears Firm in nothing but in the invariable rigour of his justice he was changeable in his opinions and often the dupe of those whom he despised Sometimes calm winning and benevolent he gained the affections of those who knew him not at other  times morose captious reserved he became terrible to those in whom he most confided In public he was familiar complaisant and easy to all he made no distinction between high and low he heard with patience the complaints of the meanest of his subjects and greatness was never a security against his justice in private he was thoughtful cold and silent and he often clothed his countenance with such terror that Asiph Jâh frequently fled from his presence and the Sultana in the plenitude of her influence over him was known to approach him on trembling knees His affection for his children bordered on weakness He was as forgetful of injuries as he was of favours In war he had no abilities he was fond of peace and tranquillity and rather a lover than an encourager of the arts of eivil life Naturally averse to tyranny and oppression property was secure under his administration he had no avarice himself to render him unjust and he was the determined and implacable enemy of extortion in others He was a man of science and of literary abilities and the memoris of his life which he penned himself do him more honour as a good writer than the matter as a great monarch Upon the whole Jehangire though not a faultless man was far from being a bad prince he had an inclination to be virtuous and his errors proceeded from a defect more than from a depravity of soul His mother was thought to have introduced a tincture of madness into his blood and an immoderate use of wine and opium rendered sometimes frantic a mind naturally inflamed  His private life and opinions  Though Jehangire was often serious and distant among his domestics he was fond of throwing off the character of the emperor and of enjoying freely the conversation of his subjects He often disappeared in the evening from the palace and dived into obscure punchhouses to pass some hours in drinking and talking with the lower sort He had no enemies and he was under no  apprehensions concerning the safety of his person Being in the hall of audience accessible to all ranks of men after the performance of the usual ceremonies he was often known in his nocturnal excursions But the people loved his familiar openness and did not by rudeness abuse the trust reposed in them by their prince He often desired his companions at the bowl to ask no favours of him lest SELIM in his cups might promise what JEHANGIRE in his sober senses would not chuse to perform When the liquor began to inflame him he was rather mad than intoxicated He flew from one extreme of passion to another this moment joyful the next melancholy and drowned in tears When in this situation he was fond of arguing upon abstruse subjects Religion was his favourite topic He sometimes praised the Mahommedan faith sometimes that of the Christians he was now a follower of Zoroaster and now of Brahma In the midst of these devout professions he would sometimes as starting from a dream exclaim That the prophets of all nations were impostors and that he himself should his indolence permit him could form a better system of religion than any they had imposed on the world When he was sober he was divested of every idea of religion having been brought up a Deist under the tuition of his father Akbar  Scheme of establishing a new faith  The variety of opinions on the subject of religion which prevailed in India occasioned great uneasiness both to Jehangire and his father Akbar The tenets of Mahommedanism which the family of Timur had brought along with them into their conquests were the religion established by law but the majority of their subjects were of different persuasions The followers of the Brahmin faith were the most numerous and the next were the Persian Guebres who worshipped the element of Fire as the best representative of God The Christians of Europe and of Armenia  possessed several factories in the principal cities and ports and they wandered in pursuit of commerce over all the empire The different opinions among all these sects on a subject which mankind reckon of the last importance were the source of disputes animosities and quarrels Akbar was chagrined He tolerated every religion he admitted men of all persuasions into his confidence and service and he had formed serious thoughts of promulgating a new faith which might reconcile the minds of all his subjects He esteemed himself as equal in abilities to Mahommed and he had more power to enforce his doctrine But foreseeing the distractions which this arduous measure might occasion he dropt his design and instead of establishing a new faith contented himself with giving no credit to any of the old systems of religion Jehangire in his youth had imbibed his father's principles He began to write a new code of divine law but he had neither the austerity nor the abilities of a prophet He shewed more wisdom in relinquishing than in forming such a visionary scheme  His violence  Jehangire was subject to violent passions upon many occasions Complaints against his nobles and even against his favourite sons were received with an eagerness and a rage against the offenders more easily imagined than described When his mind was heated with a relation of oppression he often burst out into a loud exclamation  "Who in my empire has dared to do this wrong"  His violence flew before the accusation and to name any person to him was to convince him of his guilt Shaw Jehân had been known when in the greatest favour to have come trembling before his father at the accusation of the meanest subject and the whole ministry and the servants of the court frequently stood abashed pale distant and in terror for themselves when a poor man in rags was relating his grievances to the emperor  An instance  His excessive severity in the execution of impartial justice was the great line which marks the features of the character of Jehangire He had no respect of persons when he animadverted upon crimes His former favour was obliterated at once by guilt and he persevered with undeviating rigour to revenge upon the great the injuries done to the low The story of Seif Alla remains as a monument of his savage justice The sister of the favourite Sultana had a son by her husband Ibrahim the Suba of Bengal who from his tender years had been brought up at court by the empress who having no sons by Jehangire adopted Seif Alla for her own The emperor was fond of the boy he even often seated him upon his throne At twelve years of age Alla returned to his father in Bengal Jehangire gave him a letter to the Suba with orders to appoint him governor of Burdwan Alla after having resided in his government some years had the misfortune when he was one day riding on an elephant through the street to tread by accident a child to death The parents of the child followed Alla to his house They loudly demanded an exemplary punishment on the driver and the governor considering it an accident refused their request and ordered them to be driven away from his door They abused him in very opprobrious terms and Alla proud of his rank and family expelled them from the district of Burdwan  of his severity  Jehangire residing at that time in the city of Lahore they found their way after a long journey on foot to the presence They called aloud for justice and the emperor wrote a letter to Alla with his own hand with peremptory orders to restore to the injured parents of the child their possessions and to make them ample amends for their loss and the fatigue of their journey The pride of Alla was hurt at the victory obtained over him and instead of obeying the orders of his prince he threw them into prison  till they made submissions to him for their conduct But as soon as they were released they travelled again to Lahore Alla was alarmed and wrote letters to the Sultana and Asiph Jâh to prevent the petitioners from being admitted into the presence They hovered to no effect for some months about the palace They could not even come within hearing of the emperor till one day that he was taking his pleasure in a barge upon the river They pressed forward through the crowd and thrice called out aloud for justice The emperor heard them and he recollected their persons He ordered the barge to be rowed that instant to the bank and before he inquired into the nature of their complaint he wrote an order for them to receive a pension for life from the Imperial treasury When they had explained their grievances he said not a word but he commanded Alla to appear immediately at court  in the execution of justice  Alla obeyed the Imperial command but he knew not the intentions of Jehangire which that prince had locked up in his own breast The youth encamped with his retinue the night of his arrival on the opposite bank of the river and sent a messenger to announce his coming to the emperor Jehangire gave orders for one of his elephants of state to be ready by the dawn of day and he at the same time directed the parents of the child to attend He himself was up before it was light and having crossed the river he came to the camp of Alla and commanded him to be bound The parents were mounted upon the elephant and the emperor ordered the driver to tread the unfortunate young man to death But the driver afraid of the resentment of the Sultana passed over him several times without giving the elephant the necessary directions The emperor however by his threats obliged him at last to execute his orders He retired home in silence and issued out his commands  to bury Alla with great pomp and magnificence and that the court should go into mourning for him for the space of two moons  "I loved him" said Jehangire "but justice like necessity should bind monarchs"  Of his humanity  The severe justice of Jehangire established tranquillity through all his dominions when they were not disturbed by the ambition of his sons The Subas of provinces avoided oppression as the poor had a determined avenger of their wrongs in their sovereign He upon every occasion affected the conversation of the lower sort They had immediate access to his person and he only seemed pleased when he was humbling the pride of his nobles upon the just complaints of the vulgar He boasted of his humanity as well as of his justice He had used to say That a monarch should even feel for the beasts of the field and that the birds of heaven ought to receive their due at the foot of the throne  Dawir Buxsh raised to the throne  As soon as Jehangire expired Asiph at the head of the Imperial retinue proceeded with the body to Lahore When he arrived on the banks of the Gelum he dispatched a Hindoo named Narsi with the ring to Mohâbet as the signal for that lord to espouse the cause of Shaw Jehân The will of Jehangire had been opened immediately upon his demise He had at the instigation of the Sultana named his fourth son Shariâr as his successor in the throne but that prince had some weeks before set out for Lahore When the news of the death of Jehangire arrived at that city the prince seized upon the Imperial treasure and encouraged the troops to join him by ample donations The visier was alarmed To gain time for the execution of his designs in favour of Shaw Jehân he proclaimed Dawir Buxsh the son of prince Chusero emperor of the Moguls His  sister disapproved of this measure and endeavoured to raise a party in the camp in favour of Shariâr but he put an end to her schemes by confining her to her tent and gave strict orders that none should be admitted into her presence  Shariâr defeated taken and blinded  Shariâr by means of the Imperial treasure collected together a considerable force Being ill of a venereal disorder himself he appointed Baiêsâr the son of his uncle the prince Daniâl to command his army The troops of Asiph were inferior in number to those of Shariâr but they were in some measure disciplined and inured to the field Shariâr had crossed the Gelum before the arrival of Asiph who drew up his forces upon the first appearance of the enemy It was rather a flight than a battle The raw troops of Shariâr gave way before they came to blows He was not himself in the action he stood on a distant hill and fell in into the current of retreat He shut himself up in the citadel of Lahore which was invested the next day by the army of Asiph The friends of Shariâr deserted him and made terms for themselves The unfortunate prince hid himself in a cellar within the haram He was found and dragged to the light by Ferose Chan and Alliverdi bound his hands with his girdle and brought him to Dawir Buxsh He was ordered to be confined and the second day he was deprived of sight  March of Shaw' Jehân  Narsi the messenger of Asiph arrived with the ring after a journey of three weeks at Chibîr on the borders of Golconda where Mohâbet at the time resided with Shaw Jehân He informed the prince of the death of Jehangire and acquainted Mohâbet of the plan formed by the visier to secure the throne for the former and that Dawir Buxsh was only raised as a temporary bulwark against the designs of the Sultana and to appease the people who were averse to Shariâr Shaw Jehân by the  advice of Mohâbet began his march through Guzerat Two officers were sent with letters to the vizier and Nîshar Chan was dispatched with presents to Lodi who commanded the army in the Decan  Suspicious conduct of Lodi  Lodi was always averse to the interests of Shaw Jehân He was proud and passionate of high birth and reputation in war Deriving his blood from the Imperial family of Lodi he even had views on the empire Many of his nation served under him in the army and confiding in their attachment he looked with secret pleasure upon the contests for the throne which were likely to arise in the family of Timur He had detached a part of his army to seize Malava and all the Imperial territories bordering upon that province The messenger of Shaw Jehân was received with coldness The answer given him was undecisive and evasive and he was dismissed without any marks either of resentment or favour Lodi did not see clearly before him and he was resolved to take advantage of events as they should happen to rise  Dawir Buxsh deposed and murdered  Shaw Jehân having as already mentioned taken the rout of Guzerat received the submission of that province Seif Chan who commanded for the empire being sick was taken in his bed but his life was spared at the intercession of his wife who was the particular favourite of the sister of the prince Having remained seven days at Ahmedabâd news arrived of the victory of the visier over Shariâr ChidmudPerist was dispatched to the conqueror with letters They contained expressions of the deepest gratitude to the minister but he at the same time intimated that dissention could not cease but with the life of the sons of Chusero and DaniâlThe temporary emperor Dawir Buxsh had been dethroned and imprisoned three days before the arrival of Shaw  Jehân's messenger at Lahore His brother Gurshasp and Baiêsâr and Hoshung the sons of Daniâl had been also confined To show his attachment to Shaw Jehân the visier delivered the keys of the prison to Perist and that chief to gain his master's favour strangled the three princes that very night Asiph made no enquiry concerning their deaths He marched the next day toward Agra having proclaimed Shaw Jehân emperor of the Moguls  Shaw Jehân arrives at Agra  Shaw Jehân arriving at Ajmere was joined in that city by the Rana and his son They were dignified with titles and several Omrahs were raised to higher ranks of nobility The government of Ajmere with many rich estates were conferred upon Mohâbet and the emperor for Shaw Jehân had assumed that title marched toward Agra and pitched his camp in sight of that capital on the st of January in the garden which from its beauty was called the Habitation of Light Cassim the governor of Agra came with the keys and touched the ground with his forehead before the emperor who entered the city the next day amid the acclamations of the populace They forgot his crimes in his splendour and recognized the right to the throne which murder had procured  Jehangire's children  Seven children were born to the emperor Jehangire five sons and two daughters The first were Chusero Purvez Churrum Jehandâr and Shariâr the daughters were Sultana Nissa and Sultana Bâr Banu Chusero Purvez and Jehandâr died before their father Shariâr fell a victim to his brother's jealousy and Churrum under the name of Shaw Jehân succeeded to the empire The prince Chusero left two sons Dawir Buxsh and Gurshasp the first had obtained the name of emperor they were both murdered as has been already mentioned at Lahore The children  of Purvez were a son and a daughter the first by dying a natural death soon after his father prevented the dagger of Shaw Jehân from committing another murder and the latter became afterwards the wife of Dara the eldest son of Shaw JehânThe two sons of Daniâl Baiêsâr and Hoshung had been confined during the reign of their uncle Jehangire Strangers to the world and destitute of experience their nerves were relaxed by inactivity and their minds broken by adversity This state of debility did not secure them from the jealousy of the new emperor by whose commands they were strangled at Lahore The emperor either by the dagger or bowstring dispatched all the males of the house of Timur so that he himself and his children only remained of the posterity of Baber who conquered India  State of Persia and Usbekian Tartary  The state of Persia suffered no change during the reign of the emperor Jehangire in Hindostan Shaw Abas sirnamed the Great who was in his twentieth year on the throne of the family of Seifi at the death of Akbar outlived Jehangire He covered with splendid exploits and a rigorous adherence to justice the natural severity and even cruelty of his character and acquired the reputation of a great though not of an amiable prince The Usbec Tartars of Great Bucharia who had made encroachments on the Persian dominions during the interrupted reigns of the immediate predecessors of Abas lost much of their consequence in the time of that victorious prince Domestic troubles and disputes about the succession converted the western Tartary into a scene of blood and offered an object of ambition to Abas He invaded Chorassan he besieged the capital Balick but he was obliged to retreat by the activity and valour of Baki who had possessed himself after various vicissitudes of fortune of the throne of the Usbecs Baki dying in the third year of his reign  was succeeded by his brother Walli who being expelled by his uncle took refuge with many of the nobles in the court of Shaw Abas The Persian assisted him with an army He was successful in many engagements defeated his uncle's forces and took the city of Bochara but his fortune changed near Samarcand and he fell in a battle which he lost The views of Abas on the western dominions of the Usbecs which had formerly belonged to Persia fell with his ally Walli Emam Kulli and his brother divided between them the empire and notwithstanding the efforts of Abas retained the dominion of the extensive province of Chorassan  SHAW JEHAN  CHAP I  ReflectionsAccession of Shaw JehânPromotionsThe emperor's childrenState of the empire with regard to foreign powersIncursion of the UsbecsWar in

takes the field  Reflections  THE ideas upon government which the Tartars of the northern Asia carried into their conquests in Hindostan were often fatal to the posterity of Timur Monarchy descends through the channel of primogeniture but despotism must never fall into the hands of a minor The prince is the center of union between all the members of the state and when he happens to be a child the ties which bind the allegiance of the subject are dissolved Habituated to battle and inured to depredation the Tartars always adopted for their leader that person of the family of their princes who was most proper for their own mode of life and lost sight of hereditary succession in the convenience of the nation When they settled in better regions than their native country they did not lay aside a custom suited only to incursion and war The succession to the throne was never determined by established rules and a door was opened to intrigue to murder and to civil war Every prince as if in an enemy's country mounted the throne through conquest and the  safety of the state as well as his own forced him in a manner to become an assassin and to stain the day of his accession with the blood of his relations When therefore the Despot died ambition was not the only source of broils among his sons They contended for life as well as for the throne under a certainty that the first must be lost without a possession of the second Selfpreservation that first principle of the human mind converted frequently the humane prince into a cruel tyrant and thus necessity prompted men to actions which their souls perhaps abhorred  Accession of Shaw Jehân  Shaw Jehân had this apology for the murder of his relations and the manners of the people were so much adapted to an idea of necessity in such a case that they acquiesced without murmuring under his government He mounted the throne of the Moguls in Agra on the first of February of the year of the Christian Aera and according to the pompous manner of eastern princes assumed the titles of THE TRUE STAR OF THE FAITH THE SECOND LORD OF THE HAPPY CONJUNCTIONS MAHOMMED THE KING OF THE WORLD He was born at Lahore on the fifth of January and on the day of his accession he was thirtysix solar years and twentyeight days old To drive away the memory of the late assassinations from the minds of the people and to gratify the nobles who had crowded from every quarter to Agra he ushered in his reign with a festival which exceeded every thing of the kind known in that age in magnificence and expence The pompous shews of the favourite Sultana in the late reign vanished in the superior grandeur of those exhibited by Shaw Jehân  Promotions  In the midst of festivity and joy Shaw Jehân did neither forget the state nor the gratitude which he owed to his friends Asiph Jâh though not yet arrived from Lahore was confirmed in the office of visier His appointments to support the dignity  of his station and as a reward for the part he acted in securing the possession of the throne to the emperor amounted to near a million sterling Mohâbet who in Shaw Jehân's progress from the Decan to Agra had been presented with the government of Ajmere was raised to the high office of captaingeneral of all the forces and to the title and dignity of Chan Chanan or first of the nobles His son Chanazâd who had been raised to the title of Chan Zimân was placed in the government of Malava Behâr was conferred on Chan Alum Bengal on Casim Allahabâd on Jansapar Chan The emperor in bestowing the province of Cabul on Liscâr exhibited an instance of justice He had during his rebellion taken eight lacks of roupees by force from that Omrah and when he appointed him to Cabul he at the same time gave him a draught on the treasury for the money signifying to Liscâr  "That necessity being removed there was no excuse for the continuance of injustice"  Fifty Mahommedan nobles together with many Indian Rajas were raised to honours and gratified with presents  Asiph arrives at Agra  During these transactions at Agra Asiph pursued his journey in very slow marches from Lahore His sister the favourite of the late emperor being ruined in all her schemes of ambition was left in a kind of consinement at Lahore in the Imperial palace The four sons of the reigning emperor Dara Suja Aurungzêbe and Morâd had been sent as hostages for their father's good behaviour to Jehangire They were in the Imperial camp when that monarch expired and Asiph treated them with kindness and respect He arrived at Agra on the twentysecond of March and presented his sons to the emperor when he was celebrating the festival of the Norose which is kept by the followers of Mahommed at the vernal equinox in every year The emperor was so much rejoiced at the sight of his children who had been all  born to him by his favourite wife the daughter of Asiph that he conferred upon their grandfather the pompous title of THE FATHER OF PRINCES THE STRENGTH OF THE REALM AND PROTECTOR OF THE EMPIRE  Children of the emperor  The Imperial prince Dara Shêko was thirteen years old at the accession of his father to the throne Suja was in the twelfth Aurungzêbe in the tenth and Morâd in the fourth lunar year of his age The eldest of the emperor's children by the favourite Sultana the daughter of Asiph was the princess Jehânara which name signifies THE ORNAMENT OF THE WORLD She was fourteen years of age when Shaw Jehân mounted the throne Sensible lively and generous elegant in her person and accomplished in her mind she obtained an absolute empire over her father A similarity of disposition with the open and sincere Dara attached her to the interest of that prince and he owed in a great measure the favour of his father to her influence Roshenrai Begum or THE PRINCESS OF THE ENLIGHTENED MIND was the second daughter of Shaw Jehân and his fourth child by the favourite Sultana Her wit was sharp and penetrating her judgment sound her manner engaging like her person she was full of address and calculated for stratagem and intrigue She resembled the pervading genius of Aurungzêbe and she favoured his designs The emperor's third daughter was Suria Bânu or THE SPLENDID PRINCESS a name suited to her exquisite beauty She was easy and gentle in her temper soft and pleasing in her address humane benevolent and silent averse to duplicity and art full of dignity and honourable pride She took no part in the intrigues which disturbed the repose of the state devoting her time to the accomplishments of her sex and a few innocent amusements  State of the empire  Shaw Jehân found himself in the peaceable possession of the extensive empire of his father and he had abilities to govern it with dignity justice and precision Tranquillity was established at home and there were no enemies to disturb him from abroad Shaw Abas soon after died in Persia and the scepter fell into the weak and inactive hands of his grandson Sesi a prince incapable of either governing his subjects with dignity or of giving any disturbance to his neighbours The spirit of the Usbecs had declined and they were exhausted by disputed successions and civil wars The Indian nations beyond the pale of the empire were peaceable and unwarlike incapable of committing injuries and too distant from the seat of government to receive them The Portugueze though the most powerful European nation in India were not formidable to the empire though hated by the prince Shaw Jehân when in arms against his father had solicited their assistance They had not only refused him their aid but in a manly manner reproached him for having demanded it against his parent and sovereign He was sensible of the justice of the reproof and therefore could not forgive it The Sultana was their enemy She had accompanied her husband to one of their settlements and she was enraged beyond measure against them for the worship they paid to images  Lodi submits  The disrespect shewn by Lodi who commanded in the Decan to Nishar Chan the emperor's messenger produced a superceding commission to the latter against the former Nishar produced the Imperial mandate but Lodi would not obey Mohâbet was ordered with a force against the refractory general and Nishar on account of his not having acted with a proper spirit was recalled Chan Zimân from his government of Malava marched with all his forces to the aid of his father Mohâbet  Lodi was soon reduced to extremities He sent messengers to Mohâbet with a request of his mediation with the emperor explaining away his conduct by the difficulty of deciding in favour of the reigning emperor against the will of Jehangire  "But now" continues he "that Shaw Jehân remains alone of the posterity of Timur Lodi cannot hesitate to obey his commands"  These letters were received by Mohâbet before things came to open hostility He transmitted them to Agra and Lodi was restored in appearance to favour  Invasion  The confusions occasioned by the disputed succession after the death of Jehangire rouzed the ambition of Shaw Kull prince of the Usbee Tartars He looked upon a civil war as a certain event in India and he resolved to seize on the opportunity presented by Fortune He ordered ten thousand of his best horse under Nidder Mahommed accompanied with a good train of artillery to penetrate into the province of Cabul That general entered the Imperial dominions and laid siege to the fortress of Zohâc But the place was so strong and so well defended by Zingis who commanded the garrison that Mahommed after suffering a considerable loss raised the siege The Usbecs however did not retreat to their own country Mahommed after being repulsed at Zohâc attempted to surprize Cabul and having failed in the enterprize he sat down before that city  of the Usbecs  Having summoned the garrison of Cabul to no purpose the Usbecs began to make their approaches They soon advanced their batteries to the counterscarp of the ditch and by a constant fire made several breaches in the wall Ziffer the late Suba had left the place and Liscâr the new governor was not yet arrived The command of the garrison was in Jacob Chan who defended himself so well that the enemy was beat back with great loss in  a general assault Mahommed though repulsed was not discouraged He raised with great labour mounds to command the walls and drove the besieged from the rampart The breach however had been repaired and the Usbecs durst not attempt to scale the walls  Repulsed  The news of the invasion had in the mean time arrived at the court of Agra and the emperor finding that Mohâbet had settled the affairs of the Decan ordered that general to the relief of Cabul Having left his son in his command in the south Mohâbet hastened with all expedition to the north Twelve thousand horse attended him and he was to take up the forces of Punjâb on his way The siege had now continued three months the Usbecs had again made a practicable breach and the ditch was almost filled when the news of the march of Mohâbet arrived in the camp of Mahommed He redoubled his diligence and the garrison who knew nothing of succour began to despair When therefore the Usbecs began to prepare for a second general assault the besieged sallied out with all their forces The battle was obstinate and bloody but Mahommed was at length obliged to give way and the garrison hung on his heels beyond the frontiers of the province Mohâbet upon the news of this defeat returned to Agra and civil contests took up the attention of the Usbecs at home  War with the  The invasion of the Usbecs was succeeded by an insurrection in the small province of Bundelcund The Indian prince of that country whose name was Hidjâr Singh having come to pay his respects at the court of Agra found that an addition was made in the books of the Imperial treasury to the tribute which he and his ancestors had formerly paid to the house of Timur Instead of petitioning for an abatement of the impost he fled without  taking leave of the emperor When he arrived in his dominions he armed his dependants to the number of fifteen thousand men He garrisoned his fortresses and occupied the passes which led to his country The emperor was enraged at the presumption of this petty chieftain He ordered Mohâbet to enter his country with twelve thousand horse and three thousand foot by the way of Gualiâr Lodi lately received into favour with twelve thousand more was commanded to invade Bundelcund from the south and Abdalla with seven thousand horse from the east by the way of Allahabâd These three armies under three experienced and able officers were more than necessary for the service but the emperor was desirous to shew an instance of vigour at the commencement of his reign to raise the terror of his displeasure and to establish tranquillity and good order by the means of fear  Raja of Bundelcund  The emperor himself marched from Agra on the twentieth of December on a tour of pleasure to the forest of Niderbari where he hunted tigers for six days and then took the route of Gualiâr that he might be near the seat of war He opened the gates of that fortress to all state prisoners some of whom had remained in confinement during the whole of the former reign This clemency procured him popularity and took away part of the odium which his bloody policy had already fixed on his character The refractory Raja was in the mean time pressed hard on every side He resisted with spirit but he was driven from post to post He as the last resort shut himself up in his fort of Erige Abdalla sat down before it and having made a practicable breach stormed the place and put the garrison consisting of three thousand men to the sword The Raja made his escape He was ruined but his spirit was not broken With the remaining part of his army he fell into the rout of Mohâbet  and his forces being cut off he himself came into the hands of the captaingeneral  He is taken prisoner  Mohâbet carried his prisoner to the emperor who had returned to Agra Shaw Jehân was rigid to an extreme and his humanity gave always place to policy He ordered the unfortunate prince into confinement intimating that a warrant should soon be issued for his execution Mohâbet who admired the intrepid constancy of the Raja shewed an inclination to intercede for his life but the stern looks of the emperor imposed silence upon him He however the next day carried his prisoner into the presence the rigid darkness of Shaw Jehân's countenance continued and the captaingeneral stood at a distance in close conversation with the Raja The emperor saw them but he was silent The prince and even Mohâbet despaired of success They came the third day into the presence and stood as usual at a distance The Raja was in fetters and Mohâbet chained his own hand to that of the prisoner  "Approach Mohâbet" said Shaw Jehân "The captaingeneral will have it so and I pardon Hidjâr Singh But life without dignity is no present from the emperor of the Moguls to a fallen prince I therefore to his government restore Hidjâr Singh upon paying sixteen lacks of roupees and furnishing the Imperial army with forty elephants of war"  Mohâbet removed from the head of the army  Notwithstanding the deference which was shewn to Mohâbet for his great abilities the emperor was jealous of his influence and popularity He therefore requeited of him to resign the command of the army on the frontiers of the unconquered provinces of the Decan together with the government of Candeish both which offices the captaingeneral discharged by Chan Zemân his son Eradit the receivergeneral of the Imperial revenues  was appointed to that important station He set out from court and Chan Zemân having resigned the army and government to him returned to Agra This change in the government of the frontier provinces was productive of disturbances The Nizam of Golconda who had been kept quiet by the reputation of Mohâbet and his son invaded upon the departure of the latter the Imperial province of Candeish Diria who in subordination to the new Suba commanded the army attacked the Nizam in a disavantageous situation and obliged him to retreat into his own dominions with the loss of a great part of his army  Irruption of the Usbecs  The unsuccessful attempts of the Usbecs upon Cabul in the beginning of the preceding year together with domestic distractions consequent upon their disgrace had hitherto secured the peace of the northern frontier of the empire They were however anxious to recover their lost reputation An army of volunteers were collected and the command vested in Zingis That officer suddenly entered the Imperial dominions and sat down before the fort of Bamia in the mountains of Cabul The place was feebly garrisoned and the Usbecs pressed the fiege with vigour It fell into their hands and Zingis having demolished the walls returned with the plunder of the open country to the dominions of the Usbecs This irruption could be scarce called a war as the sudden retreat of the enemy restored the public tranquillity  Story of Chan Jehân Lodi  The most remarkable event of the second year of Shaw Jehân is the flight of Chan Jehân Lodi from Agra This nobleman at the death of Jehangire commanded as already mentioned the Imperial army stationed in the Decan The favourite Sultana had found means by letters to gain over Lodi to the interest of the prince Shariâr whom she had resolved to place on the  throne of India Shaw Jehân in his march to Agra applied to him for a passage through his government which he absolutely refused He added contempt to his refusal by sending a thousand roupees a horse and a dress to the prince as to a person of inferior dignity to himself The messenger of Lodi however had not the courage to deliver the humiliating present He gave the roupees the dress and the horse to a shepherd when he got beyond the walls of Brampour where Lodi resided He at the same time desired the shepherd to return the whole to Lodi and to tell him That if the presents were not unworthy of him to give they were too insignisicant for his servant to carry to a great prince Having given these directions to the shepherd the messenger proceeded to Shaw Jehân The prince approved of his behaviour thanked him for having such a regard for his honour and after he was settled on the throne raised the messenger as a reward for his services to the rank of a noble  Cause of the emperor's resentment  Shaw Jehân being in no condition to force his way through the government of Lodi took a long circuit round the hills through wild and unfrequented paths Lodi became soon sensible of his error The defeat and death of Shariâr the imprisonment of the Sultana the murder of Dawir Buxsh and the accession of Shaw Jehân to the throne came successively to his ears He thought of submission but an army was on its march to reduce him to obedience Zimân the son of Mohâbet was at the head of this force but Lodi being in possession of an army and an extensive and rich province the emperor gave to his general a commission to treat with that refractory Lord He soon closed with the terms He was appointed to the government of Malava upon his resigning the Imperial division of the Decan The emperor however was not sincere in the pardon which  he promised His pride revolted at the indignities offered him by Lodi and at a proper occasion he resolved to punish him  against that Omrah  Lodi was not long in possession of the government of Malava when he received orders to repair to court As his resignation of the command of the army might be construed into obedience rather than attributed to fear he was under no apprehensions in making his appearance in the presence An edict of indemnity had been promulgated to all the Omrahs who had opposed the accession of Shaw Jehân to the throne and Lodi thought that there was no probability of his being excluded from the indulgence granted to others He was however convinced of his error on the first day of his appearance at court The usher Perist obliged him to exhibit some ceremonies of obedience inconsistent with the rank which he held among the nobility He was somewhat refractory but he thought it prudent to submit His son Azmut Chan was introduced after his father The youth was then but sixteen years of age He thought that the usher kept him too long prostrate upon the ground and he started up before the signal for rising was given The usher in a rage struck Azmut over the head with his rod and insisted upon his throwing himself again on the ground Azmut full of fire and valour drew his sword He aimed a blow at the usher's head but one of the macebearers warded it off and saved his life  He is disgraced in the presence  A sudden murmur spread around All fell into confusion and many placed their hands on their swords Lodi considering the blow given to his son as the signal of death drew his dagger to defend himself Hussein his other son followed his father's example The tumult encreased and the emperor leapt from his throne Lodi and his sons rushed out of the presence  Their house was contiguous to the palace and they shut themselves up with three hundred dependants The house being inclosed with a strong wall no impression could be made upon it without artillery and as a siege so near the gates of the palace would derogate from the majesty of the emperor Shaw Jehân endeavoured to entice Lodi to a surrender by a promise of pardon His friends at court however acquainted him that that there was a resolution formed against his life and he resolved to make his escape or to die in the attempt  His distress▪  Night in the mean time came on and he was tormented with various passions His women were all around him To leave them to dishonour was intolerable to remain was death to remove them by violence cruelty He was afflicted beyond measure and he burst into tears His wives saw his grief and they retired They consulted together in an inner apartment Their resolution was noble but desperate they raised their hands against their own lives The groans reached the ears of Lodi He rushed in but there was only one taper burning which in his haste he overturned and extinguished He spoke but none answered He searched around but he plunged his hand in blood He stood in silence a while and one of his sons having brought a light discovered to his eyes a scene of inexpressible horror He said not a word but the wildness of his eyes was expressive of the tempest which rolled in his mind He made a signal to his two sons and they buried the unfortunate women in the garden He hung for some time in silence over their common grave Then starting at once from a profound reverie he issued forth in a state of horror and despair He ordered his drums to be beaten his trumpets to be sounded His people gathered around him They mounted their horses in the courtyard and he himself at once threw open the gate He issued out with his two  sons and his followers fell in order into his path The Imperial troops were astonished and made little resistance He was heard to exclaim  "I will awaken the tyrant with the sound of my departure but he shall tremble at my return"  He rushed through the city like a whirlwind and took the rout of Malava  and flight  The emperor disturbed by the sudden noise started from his bed He enquired into the cause and ordered Abul Hussein with nine other nobles to pursue the fugitive They collected their troops and left the city by the dawn of day Lodi without halting rode forward near forty miles He was stopt by the river Chunbil which was so high so rough and rapid on account of the rains that he could not swim across it and all the boats had been carried down by the stream This was an unexpected and terrible check but as the weather was now fair he hoped that the torrent would soon fall and in that expectation he and his followers stood on the bank In the midst of his anxiety the Imperial troops appeared He called his people together and told them he was resolved to die in arms There was a pass behind him which opened between two hills into a narrow plain He took immediate possession of the pass the river which had cut off all hopes of flight served to cover his rear  His gallant behaviour  The Imperialists trusting to their numbers advanced with confidence but they were so warmly received that they drew back with manifest signs of fear Shame forced them to renew the charge A select body pressed forward into the pass The shock was violent and the slaughter on both sides was as great and expeditious as the small place in which they engaged would permit Hussein had a resource in numbers Lodi had nothing in which he could conside but his valour Scarce one hundred of his men now remained unhurt he himself was  wounded in the right arm and the enemy were preparing a third time to advance His affairs were desperate His two sons Azmut and Hussein conjured him to attempt the river and that they would secure his retreat  "The danger is equal" replied Lodi "but it is more honourable to die in the field"  They insisted upon his retreating as his wound had rendered him unsit for action  "But can I leave you both" said Lodi "when I have most need of my sons One must attend me in my misfortune which is perhaps a greater evil than death itself"  A dispute immediately arose between the brothers each contending for the honour of covering their father's retreat At that instant the Usher Perist who had struck Azmut in the presence appeared in the front of the Imperialists  "Hussein the thing is determined" said Azmut "dost thou behold that villain and bid me fly"  He spurred onward his horse his father and brother plunged into the river  and escape▪  Perist was a Calmue Tartar of great strength of body and intrepidity of mind He saw Azmut advancing and he started from the ranks and rode forward to meet him halfway Azmut had his bow ready bent in his hand he aimed an arrow at Perist and laid him dead at the feet of his horse But the valiant youth did not long survive his enemy He was cut to pieces by the Imperialists and the few faithful friends who had remained by his side were either slain on the spot or driven into the river and drowned The conquerors had no reason to boast of their victory four hundred men and three officers of high rank were slain in the action six nobles and a great number of inferior chiefs were wounded The latter action was so short that it was over before Lodi and Hussein had extricated themselves from the stream When they ascended the opposite bank of the river they looked back with anxiety for Azmut but Azmut was no more to be seen  even his followers were by that time slain and the victors with shouts of triumph possessed the further shore  His distress and bravery  Lodi had no time to deliberate none to indulge his grief for Azmut The enemy had already plunged into the stream and he made the best of his way from the bank He entered his own province of Malava but the Imperialists were close at his heels Before he could collect his friends he was overpowered by numbers and defeated in several actions He was at length driven beyond the boundaries of Malava He continued his flight to Bundela with a few adherents who had joined him and he maintained with great bravery every pass against the troops that pursued him in his retreat The Imperialists however being at length harassed by long marches bad roads and continual skirmishing gave over the pursuit Lodi remained a few days at Bundela then he traversed the provinces of Berâr and Odipour in his rout to Golconda and presented himself before the Nizâm at Dowlatabad That prince received the unfortunate fugitive with open arms a warm friendship having for some years subsisted between them  Uneasiness of the emperor  The emperor expressed great uneasiness at the escape of Lodi He knew his abilities he was acquainted with his undeviating perseverance Highspirited and active Lodi loved danger as furnishing an opportunity for an exertion of his great talents and he was always discontented and uneasy at that tranquillity for which mankind in general offer up their prayers to Heaven The more noble and generous passions of his mind were now up in arms His pride had been rouzed by the indignities thrown upon him and he ascribed the death of his wives and of his gallant son to the perfidy of Shaw Jehân His haughty temper revolted against submission and his prudence forbad him to listen  any more to pardons that were not sincere The emperor knew the man with whom he had to contend and he was alarmed at the news of his arrival in the Decan He foresaw a storm in that quarter should time be given to Lodi to reconcile the jarring interests of princes who were the avowed enemies of the house of Timur Shaw Jehân was naturally provident He judged of futurity by the past and he was rapid in decision He thought the object not unworthy of his presence on the southern frontier of his empire and he ordered his army to be drawn together that he might command them in the expected war in person  Death and character of Shaw Abas  During these transactions an ambassador arrived from Shaw Abas of Persia to felicitate Shaw Jehân on his accession to the throne He had scarce made his public entrance when the news of his master's death arrived Abas died in the month of January of the year after a reign of fifty years over Chorassan and more than fortytwo as sovereign of all Persia He was a prince of a warlike disposition a good stateman a deep politician a great conqueror But he was cruel and prodigal of blood He never forgave an enemy nor thought he ever sufficiently rewarded a friend Severe in his justice beyond example he rendered what is in itself a public good a real evil He knew no degrees in crimes death which is among mankind the greatest punishment was the least inflicted by Abas Though given to oppression himself he permitted none in others He was the monarch and he would be the only tyrant He delighted in curbing the haughtiness of the nobility lie took pride in relieving the poor All his subjects had access to his person He heard their complaints and his decisions were immediate and terrible His people therefore became just through fear and he owed a reign of half a century to the terrors with which  he surrounded his throne He was passionate and violent to a degree that sometimes perverted his judgment and he who boasted of holding the scales of just dealing between mankind broke often forth into outrageous acts of injustice During his life he was respected by all but his death was lamented by none  Preparations for war  The great preparations made by Shaw Jehân for an expedition into the Decan detained him at Agra till the fourth of February of the of the Christian Aera He placed himself at the head of one hundred thousand horse which together with infantry artillery and attendants increased the number of the army to three hundred thousand men He advanced toward the Decan and the governors of the provinces through which he passed fell in with their forces into his line of march On the borders of Chandeish he was met by Eradit Chan the Suba of the province who conducted him to his own residence the city of Brampour The emperor encamped his army in the environs of Brampour and dispatched messengers to the tributary princes of the Decan The principal of these were Adil sovereign of Bejapour Kuttub who styled himself king of Hydrabad and Tellingana and the Nizam prince of Golconda He threatened them with utter destruction should they not come personally to make their submission after having disbanded the armies which they had raised to support the rebellion of Lodi He also recommended to them either to deliver up or expel the man who had by encouraging their schemes projected their ruin They sent evasive answers to these demands and continued their preparations for war  Emperor arrives in the Decan  The sudden arrival of the emperor with such a great force was however premature for the affairs of Lodi He had not  yet been able to unite the armies of his allies nor to raise a sufficient force of his own The terror of the Imperial army had made each prince unwilling to quit his own dominions lest they should become the theatre of invasion and war They saw the storm gathering but they knew not where it was to fall and when they were afraid of all quarters they took no effectual means for the defence of any They were besides divided in their councils Ancient jealousies and recent injuries were remembered when the good of the whole was forgot Distrust prevailed indecision and terror followed and the unfortunate Lodi in spite of his activity his zeal and abilities found but small ground on which he could rest his hopes  He detaches  The emperor in the mean time was piqued at the inattention which princes whom he considered as tributaries had shewn to his embassy He resolved upon revenge The Nizam as being the first who had received Lodi under his protection was the first object of his resentment He raised Eradit the governor of Chandeish to the title of Azim Chan and submitted an army of twentyfive thousand men to his command The force was not judged sufficient for the reduction of the Nizam but the emperor would not trust Eradit with the absolute command of a more numerous army He fell upon the expedient of detaching two other armies consisting each of fourteen thousand horse under the separate commands of Raja Gop Singh and Shaista Chan These two generals were to act in conjunction with Eradit but they were not absolutely under his orders The three armies began their march from the capital of Chandeish about the vernal equinox of the of the Christian Aera and took the rout of Dowlatabâd  armies from the Imperial camp  The emperor in the mean time remained at Brampour Forces from various quarters crowded daily into his camp He detached seven thousand horse under Raw Ruton toward Tellingana and as many more under the conduct of Abul Hussein into the principality of Nasic in the mountains of Ballagat The Raja of Nasic had insulted Shaw Jehân in his exile and misfortunes nor did he ever forget an injury which affected his pride The Hindoo prince suffered for his insolence his country being without mercy subjected to fire and sword The emperor told Hussein at parting  "The Raja of Nasic listened not to me in my distress and you must teach him how dangerous it is to insult a man that may one day be sovereign of the world"  The expression alluded to his own name but a jest was unfit for the tragedy which was acted in the desolated country of Nasic  Success in Golconda  The first account of the success of Shaw Jehân's arms arrived at Brampour from Bakîr the governor of Orissa That province lying contiguous to Golconda Bakîr had received orders to make a diversion on that side He accordingly had marched with a considerable force and found the side of the country nearest to Orissa uncovered with troops He laid siege to Shudda Shikerist Chizduar and Berimal places of great strength in Golconda and they fell successively into his hands The news of this success pleased the more the less it was expected In the splendour of the other expeditions that under Bakîr was forgotten and the emperor scarce remembered that he had given orders to the Suba to invade the enemy when he heard that he had penetrated into the heart of their country Honours were heaped upon him and his messengers were loaded with presents  Lodi commands the consederates  Though Lodi had failed in bringing the united force of the confederates into the field he led the councils of the  courts of Golconda and Bijapour By representing to them that when they fought one by one all should be overcome they submitted their armies to his command He advanced immediately toward the Imperialists and threw himself into the passes of the mountains before Eradit who made many vain efforts to penetrate into Golconda A reinforcement of nine thousand men were detached to him from the Imperial camp Nothing would do His situation and abilities enabled Lodi to counteract all his motions and he either remained inactive or lost numbers in fruitless attempts An army which penetrated from Guzerat into the countries on the coast of Malabar was not so unsuccessful The strong fortress of Chandwar fell into their hands and they spread their devastations far and wide  Affairs at court  Shaw Jehân was not in the mean time idle at Brampour Though he directed all the motions of the armies he was not forgetful of the civil government of his vast empire With a justice which bordered on severity he quashed all petty disturbances through his dominions He inquired minutely into every department He heard all complaints against his own officers and when the people were aggrieved he removed them from their employments Nor was he in the midst of public business negligent of that grandeur and magnificence which by raising awe in his subjects gave weight to his commands He selected a hundred out of the sons of the nobility who were of the most distinguished merit and created them Omrahs in one day He gave to each a golden mace and they were by their institution always to attend the presence They were all uniformly dressed in embroidered cloaths with golden helmets swords inlaid and shields studded with gold When the emperor rode abroad these attended him with drawn sabres all mounted on fine Arabian horses Out of these he chose his officers and when he sent any  of them on service his place was immediately supplied from another corps who though not dignified with titles were equipped in the same manner only that their ornaments were of silver They also attended the emperor on horseback when he rode abroad  An action  Eradit having despaired of being able to force the passes of the mountains where Lodi was posted with the army of the confederates directed his march another way He was close pursued by Lodi with twelve thousand horse That general finding a proper opportunity attacked the Imperialists with great vigour threw them into confusion and went near routing the whole army Six Omrahs of rank fell on the Imperial side but Eradit having formed his army in order of battle Lodi thought proper to give way and to shelter himself in the hills Eradit took advantage of his retreat and hung close upon his heelsbut Lodi had the address not to offer battle excepting upon unequal terms on the side of the enemy He in the mean time harassed the Imperial army with flying squadrons cutting off their convoys defeating their foraging parties and laying waste the country in their rear Nor was the expedition under Raw Ruton into Tellingana attended with more success than that under Eradit The general was inactive and the army weak Raw Ruton was recalled and disgraced for his inactivity and Nazir Chan took the command of the Imperial troops in Tellingana  Asgans repulsed  The active spirit of Lodi was not consined to the operations of the sield No stranger to the superior power of the emperor he armed against him by his emissaries the Afgans of the north They issued from their hills to make a diversion on that side They were led by Kemnal the chief of the Rohilla tribe and they entered Punjâb with a numerous but irregular army The  project failed The emperor despised too much the depredatory incursion of naked barbarians to be frightened by them from his main object He contented himself with sending orders to the governors of the adjacent provinces to repel the invaders The Afgans accordingly were opposed defeated and driven with little loss on the side of the empire to shelter themselves in their native hills The project of Lodi though well planned fell short of the intended effect  Eradir superseded in the command of the army  The slow progress made by Eradit against the conduct and abilities of Lodi induced the emperor to think of superseding him in his command He had promised to himself success from the great superiority of his army in point of numbers and the disappointment fell heavy on his ambition and pride To place himself at the head of the expedition was beneath his dignity and his presence was otherwise necessary at Brampour as the place most centrical for conveying his orders to the different armies in the field Besides the civil business of the state the solid regulation of which he had much at heart required his attention and application He therefore resolved to send his visier Asiph into the field His name was great in the empire and his abilities in war were at least equal to his talent for managing the affairs of peace  CHAP II  The Visier commands the armyDeseat of the

army  THE visier in obedience to the emperor's orders set out from Brampour on the nineteenth of November with a splendid retinue together with a reinforcement of ten thousand horse He took the command of the army upon his arrival in the mountains and Eradit remained as his lieutenant the emperor distrusting more the abilities than the courage and fidelity of that Omrah The name of Asiph at the head of the army struck the confederates with a panic They were no strangers to his fame and they began to be conquered in their own minds They resolved to retreat from their advantageous post Lodi remonstrated in vain They had taken their resolution and would not hear him His haughty spirit was disgusted at their cowardice Several nobles formerly his friends had joined him in his misfortunes with their retinues They adhered to his opinion and resolved to stand by his side They took possession of advantageous ground and they engaged the visier with great resolution and conduct The battle was long equal numbers at last prevailed Lodi and his brave friend Diria Chan  covered the retreat of their party whilst they themselves slowly retired The sield of action and the passes of the mountains remained to the visier who immediately detached a great part of the army under his lieutenant Eradit to Dowlatabâd  The Nizam proposes terms  The Nizam being advanced in years was unfit for the fatigues of the field He had remained in his capital but as soon as he heard of the approach of Eradit he evacuated the city and shut himself up in the citadel which was thought impregnable Lodi after his defeat made the best of his way to Dowlatabâd with an intention of throwing himself into that capital to defend it to the last extremity He was too late by some hours Eradit was in the city He fled and took possession of a pass near Dowlatabâd where he defended himself till night against the whole force of the Imperialists He escaped in the dark and wandered over Golconda The army of the Nizam had by this time thrown themselves into the fortresses and the open country was overrun by the enemy To complete the misfortunes of that prince his nobles daily deserted him with their adherents and joined Shaw Jehân He began seriously to think of peace and dispatched ambassadors both to the emperor and to the visier  Flight  The emperor had given instructions to Asiph to listen to no terms without a preliminary article that Lodi should be delivered into his hands The affairs of the Nizam were desperate and Lodi was afraid that necessity would get the better of friendship He now considered his allies as his greatest enemies and he resolved to fly from Golconda The emperor had foreseen what was to happen and he placed strong detachments in all the passes of the mountains Notwithstanding this precaution in spite of the general orders for seizing him dispersed over the country Lodi forced his way with four hundred men into  Malava and arrived at the city of Ugein Shaw Jehân was no sooner apprised of his escape than he sent Abdalla in pursuit of him with ten thousand horse Abdalla came up with the fugitive at Ugein but he escaped to Debalpour and being also driven from that place he surprised Sirong where he seized several Imperial elephants and with these he took the route of Bundela  misfortunes  Misfortune pursued Lodi wherever he went The Raja's son to gain the emperor's favour fell upon him In the action he lost many of his best friends Deria was the first who fell and the unfortunate Lodi gave up his soul to grief He fled but it was to accumulated misery He fell in the very next day with the army of Abdalla there scarce was time for flight His eldest son Mahommed Azîz stopt with a few friends in a narrow part of the road and devoting their lives for the safety of Lodi were cut off to a man He waited half the night on a neighbouring hill with a vain expectation of the return of his gallant son All was silent and the unhappy father was dissolved in tears The noise of arms approached at last but it was the enemy recent from the slaughter of his son and his friends He fled toward Callenger but Seid Amud the governor of that place marched out against him A skirmish ensued Lodi was defeated Hussein the only son left to him was slain and his adherents were now reduced to thirty horsemen He was pursued with such vehemence that he had not even time for despair  nd death of Lodi  Abdalla hearing of the low ebb of Lodi's fortune divided his army into small parties to scour the country A detachment under Muziffer Chan fell in with the unfortunate fugitive When he saw the enemy at a small distance he called together his thirty followers  "Misfortune" said he "has devoted me to ruin it is in vain to struggle longer against the stream I have lost my sons  but your attachment in the last extreme tells me I have not lost all my friends I only remain of my family but let me not involve you in the destruction which overwhelms me without resource Your adherence is a proof that I have conferred favours upon you permit me to ask one favour in my turn It isthat you leave meand save yourselves by flight"  They burst all into tears and told him that was the only command from him which they could not obey He was silent and gave the signal with his sword to advance Muziffer was astonished when he saw thirty men marching up against his numerous detachment He imagined they were coming to surrender themselves But when they had come near his line they put their horses on a gallop and Muziffer ordered his men to fire A ball pierced Lodi through the left breast he fell dead at the feet of his horse and his thirty faithful companions were cut off to a man  His character  Such was the end of Chan Jehân Lodi after a series of uncommon misfortunes He was descended of the Imperial family of Lodi who held the sceptre of India before the Moguls His mind was as high as his descent his courage was equal to his ambition He was full of honour and generous in the extreme His pride prevented him from ever gaining an enemy and he never lost a friend The attachment of his followers to his person is the best eulogy on the benevolence of his mind and the fears of the emperor are irrefragable proofs of his abilities Those misfortunes therefore which might have excited pity had they fallen upon others drew admiration only on Lodi We feel compassion for the weak great men are a match for adversity the contest is equal and we yield to no emotion but surprize  Negociation broke off  When the news of the death of Lodi arrived in the Imperial camp Shaw Jehân betrayed every symptom of joy The head of  the unfortunate rebel was placed above one of the gates of the city of Brampour Abdalla was caressed for his services Valuable presents were given him and he was dignified with the splendid title of THE SUN OF OMRAHS AND THE VICTORIOUS IN WAR Muziffer whose fortune it was to kill Lodi was raised to the dignity of the deceased being afterwards distinguished by the name of Chan Jehân The negociations for the reestablishment of peace between the emperor and the confederate princes of the Decan was in the mean time broke off by the too great nemands on the part of Shaw Jehân Hostilities were accordingly recommenced and Eradit was left in the command of the army the public business demanding the presence of the visier at court The confederates had as has been already observed retired from the field into their strong holds The war was converted into a succession of sieges The fortresses were strong the garrisons determined and the Imperialists unskilful but the emperor was obstinate and would not abate from his first demands The consequence was that Shaw Jehân after a war of two years in which he lost multitudes of men by famine disease and the sword and after having expended prodigious treasures found himself possessed of a few forts his army tired out with ineffectual hostilities and the enemy distressed but not vanquished  Progress of the Imperial arms  A minute detail of unimportant campaigns would be tedious and dry Uninteresting particulars and events scarce stamp a sufficient value on time to merit the pen of the historian In the summer of Damawir the strongest fort in Golconda was taken In the beginning of the year Candumâr in Tellingana which was deemed impregnable fell into the hands of the Imperialists Little treasure was found in either The Patan princes never had a disposition for hoarding up wealth A sierce warlike and independent race of men they valued the hard tempered steel  of their swords more than gold and silver which the rest of man  ind so much prize  Death and character of the Sultana  On the eighteenth day of July died in childbed about two hours after the birth of a princess the favourite Sultana Arjemund Banu the daughter of Asiph Jah She had been twenty years married to Shaw Jehân and bore him a child almost every year Four sons and four daughters survived her When her husband ascended the throne he dignified her with the title of Mumtâza Zemâni or THE MOST EXALTED OF THE AGE Though she seldom interfered in public affairs Shaw Jehân owed the empire to her influence with her father Nor was he ungrateful he loved her living and lamented her when dead Calm engaging and mild in her disposition she engrossed his whole affection and though he maintained a number of women for state they were only the slaves of her pleasure She was such an enthusiast in Deism that she scarce could forbear persecuting the Portuguese for their supposed idolatry and it was only on what concerned that nation she suffered her temper which was naturally placid to be ruffled To express his respect for her memory the emperor raised at Agra a tomb to her name which cost in building the amazing sum of seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds  Public calamities  The death of the Sultana was followed by public calamities of various kinds The war in the Decan produced nothing but the desolation of that country An extraordinary drought which burnt up all vegetables dried up the rivers and rent the very ground occasioned a dreadful famine The Imperial camp could not be supplied with provisions distress prevailed over the whole face of the empire Shaw Jehân remitted the taxes in many of the provinces to the amount of three millions sterling he even  opened the treasury for the relief of the poor but money could not purchase bread a prodigious mortality ensued disease followed close on the heels of famine and death ravaged every corner of India The scarcity of provisions prevailed in Persia the famine raged with still greater violence in the Western Tartary No rain had fallen for seven years in that country Populous and slourishing provinces were converted into solitudes and desarts and a few who escaped the general calamity wandered through depopulated cities alone  The confederates sue for peace  But as if famine and disease were not sufficient to destroy mankind Asiph Jâh who had resumed the command of the army assisted them with the sword He trod down the scanty harvest in the Decan and ravaged with fire and sword the kingdom of Bijapour Adil Shaw the sovereign of the country came into terms when nothing was left worthy of defence He promised to pay an annual tribute to the house of Timur and to own himself a dependent on the empire Money was extorted from the Nizam and from Kuttub prince of Tellingana The conditions were That the emperor should remove his army but that he should retain by way of security for their future behaviour the strongholds which had fallen into his hands Such was the end of a war begun from motives of conquest and continued through pride The emperor after squandering a great treasure and losing a multitude of men sat down without extending his limits without acquiring reputation His great superiority in point of strength when compared to the small force of the confederates prevented battles which might yield him renown He wasted his strength on sieges and had to contend with greater evils than the swords of the enemy He however humbled the Patan power in India which during the distractions  occasioned by his own rebellion in the preceding reign had become formidable to the family of Timur  Return of the emperor to Agra  The emperor returned not to Agra from the unprofitable war in the Decan till the seventh of March of the year Eradit was left in the city of Brampour in his former office of governor of Chandeish He however did not long continue to execute the duties of a commission which was the greatest the emperor could bestow The command of the army stationed on the frontiers of the Decan had been annexed to the subaship of the province and though Shaw Jehân was in no great terror of Eradit's abilities he at that time placed no trust in his fidelity The command and the province were offered to the visier who was alarmed lest it might be a pretence of removing him from the presence He covered his dislike to the measure with an act of generosity He recommended Mohâbet to the office destined for himself and the emperor though from a jealousy of that lord's reputation he had kept him during the war in the command of the army near Brampour consented to grant his request He however insinuated to Mohâbet that he could not spare him from his councils and therefore recommended to him to appoint his son Chan Zimân his deputy in the province of Chandeish  Persecution of the Hindoos  The emperor had observed that during the distress occasioned by the late famine the superstitious Hindoos instead of cultivating their lands flew to the shrines of their gods Though neither an enthusiast nor even attached to any system of religion he was enraged at their neglect of the means of subsistence for the uncertain relief to be obtained by prayer  "They have a thousand gods" said he "yet the thousand have not been able to guard them from famine This army of divinities" continued he "instead of being beneficial to their votaries distract their  attention by their own numbers and I am therefore determined to expel them from my empire"  These were the words of Shaw Jehân when he signed an edict for breaking down the idols and for demolishing the temples of the Hindoos The measure was impolitic and in the event cruel The zealous followers of the Brahmin religion rose in defence of their gods and many enthusiasts were massacred in their presence Shaw Jehân saw the impropriety of the persecution he recalled the edict and was heard to say  "That a prince who wishes to have subjects must take them with all the trumpery and bawbles of their religion"  Suba of Bengal complains of the Portugueze  Soon after this insult on the superstition of Brahma letters were received at court from Casim Chan governor of Bengal Casim complained to the emperor that he was very much disturbed in the duties of his office by a parcel of European idolaters for so he called the Portuguese who had been permitted to establish themselves at Hugley for the purposes of trade that instead of confining their attention to the business of merchants they had fortified themselves in that place and were become so insolent that they committed many acts of violence upon the subjects of the empire and presumed to exact duties from all the boats and vessels which passed by their fort The emperor wrote him in the following laconic manner  "Expel these idolaters from my dominions"  The severity of this order proceeded from another cause  Their insolence to Shaw Jehân  When Shaw Jehân after the battle at the Nirbidda found himself obliged to take refuge in the eastern provinces he passed through Orixa into Bengal When he arrived in the neighbourhood of Dacca Michael Rodriguez who commanded the Portugueze forces at Hugley paid him a visit of ceremony Shaw Jehân after the first compliments were over requested the assistance  of Rodriguez with his soldiers and artillery making large promises of favour and emolument should he himself ever come to the possession of the throne of Hindostan The governor saw the desperate condition of the prince's affairs and would not grant his request He had the imprudence to add insult to his refusal by insinuating that he would be ashamed of serving under a rebel who had wantonly taken up arms against his father and sovereign Shaw Jehân was silent but he laid up the sarcasm in his mind He therefore listened with ardour to the representations of Casim and ordered him to invest Hugley  Hugley taken by assault  Casim in consequence of the Imperial orders appeared with an army before the Portuguese factory Their force was not sufficient to face him in the field and he immediately made his approaches in form A breach was made and the ditch filled up in a few days and the Imperialists carried the place by assault The Portuguese however behaved with bravery They continued to fight from their houses Many were killed and the living proposed terms They offered half their effects to Casim they promised to pay an annual tribute of four lacks upon condition that they should be permitted to remain in the country in their former privileges of trade The victor would listen to no terms until they laid down their arms Three thousand souls fell into his hands Their lives were spared but the images which had given so much offence to the favourite Sultana were broken down and destroyed These were the first hostilities against Europeans recorded in the histories of the East  Revolt of the Raja of Bundela  The petty war with the Portuguese was succeeded by the second revolt of the Raja of Bundela The terms imposed upon him at the reduction of his country by Mohâbet were too severe and he only had remained quiet to prepare for  another effort against the Imperial power Aurungzêbe the third son of the emperor was sent against him under the tuition of Nuserit the Suba of Malava This was the first opportunity given to that young lion of rioting in blood The Raja though much inferior in force was obstinate and brave Possessed of many strong holds he resolved to stand upon the defensive against an enemy whom he could not with any assurance of victory face in the field The war was protracted for two years Judger Singh maintained every post to the last and he yielded in one place only to retire with accumulated fortitude to another Aurungzêbe though but thirteen years of age displayed that martial intrepidity which distinguished the rest of his life He could not by the influence of Nuserit be restrained in the camp he was present in every danger and shewed an elevation of mind in the time of action which proved that he was born for tumult and war  His misforfortunes bravery  The last place which remained to the Raja was his capital city and in this he was closely besieged He was hemmed in on every side by the Imperial army and the circle grew narrower every day Resolution was at last converted into despair His bravest soldiers were cut off his friends had gradually fallen The helpless part of his family his women and children remained He proposed terms but his fortunes were too low to obtain them To leave them to the enemy would be dishonourable to remain himself certain death to him but no relief to them He set fire to the town and he escaped through the flames which overwhelmed his family A few horsemen were the companions of his flight and Nuserit followed close on their heels for two hundred miles The Raja at last crossed the Nirbidda and penctrated into the country of Canduana  and death  The unfortunate prince was at length overcome with fatigue He came into a forest and finding a pleasant plain in the middle he resolved to halt dreaming of no danger in the center of an impervious wood Both he and his followers alighted and tying their horses to trees betook themselves to rest A barbarous race of men possessed the country round They had not seen the Raja's troop but the neighing of his horses led some of them to the spot Looking from the thicket into the narrow plain where the fugitives lay they perceived to their astonishment a number of men richly dressed sleeping on the ground and fine horses standing near with furniture of silver and gold The temptation was too great to be withstood by men who had never seen so much wealth before They rushed upon the strangers and stabbed them in their sleep While they were yet dividing the spoil Nuserit came The robbers were slain and the head of the Raja was brought back to the army which Nuserit had left under the command of Aurungzêbe In the vaults of the Raja's palace were found to the value of three millions in silver coin in gold and in jewels which Aurungzêbe laid at the feet of his father as the first fruit of his victories He was received with uncommon demonstrations of joy and Nuferit for his services was raised to a higher rank of nobility  Marriages of the princes Dara and Suja  During these transactions all remained quiet at court The emperor applied to public business nor was he forgetful of pleasure Though during the life of the Sultana his affections were confined to her alone he became dissolute after her decease The vast number of women whom he kept for state in his haram had among them many enchanting beauties He wandered from one charming object to another without fixing his mind on any and enjoyed their conversation without being the dupe of their art The daughter of his brother Purvez was now grown into marriageable  years and he gave her to wife to his eldest son Dara whom he destined for the throne Suja his second son was at the same time married to the daughter of Rustum Suffavi of the royal line of Persia The ceremonies of these two marriages were attended with uncommon pomp and festivity eight hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds were expended out of the public treasury alone and the nobles contended with one another in expensive entertainments and shews  Mohâbet invades Golconda  Though the jealousy of the emperor prevented Mohâbet for some time from taking upon himself the Subaship of Chandeish and command of the army on the frontiers that lord was at last permitted to retire to his government His active genius could not remain idle long Dissatisfied with the conduct of his predecessor Eradit who had carried on the late unsuccessful war in the Decan he found means of renewing hostilities with the Nizâm He led accordingly the Imperial army into the kingdom of Golconda The Nizâm was no match for that able general in the field and he shut himself up in the citadel of Dowlatabâd Mohâbet sat down before it but for the space of six months he could make little impression upon it from its uncommon strength and situation  Takes Dowlatabâd  The citadel of Dowlatabâd is built on a solid rock almost perpendicular on every side which rises one hundred and forty yards above the plain The circumference of the outermost wall is five thousand yards the thickness at the foundation five the height fifteen The space within is divided into nine fortifications separated by strong walls rising gradually above one another toward the center by which means each commands that which is next to it beneath The entrance is by a subterraneous passage cut from the level of the plain which rises into the center of the inner  fort by a winding staircase On the outside the entrance is secured with iron gates the top of the staircase is covered with a massy grate on which a large fire is always kept during a siege But the strength of Dowlatabâd was not proof against treachery Fatté the son of Maleck Amber who was the governor sold it to Mohâbet for a sum of money and an annual pension of twentyfive thousand pounds secured on the Imperial treasury  The Nizâm confined  The old Nizâm was dead before the treachery of Fatté had delivered up the impregnable fortress of Dowlatabâd to Mohâbet An infant succeeded him and Fatté chose to make terms for himself under the uncertainty of the young prince's fortunes The delivery of the Nizâm into the hands of the Imperial general was one of the conditions imposed on Fattè for the bribe which he received The prince was carried to Agra He was treated with apparent respect and kindness by the emperor but it was dangerous to permit him to remain at large He was ordered into confinement in the castle of Gualiâr with an attendance of women and servants to alleviate his captivity His dominions in the mean time were annexed to the empire and Mohâbet with his wonted abilities established the form of government by which the new province was to be for the future regulated  Suja sent to the Decan  The animosity and jealousy which broke out afterwards among the princes the four sons of Shaw Jehân made their first appearance at this time Aurungzêbe who shewed a courage and understanding beyond his years was in great favour with the emperor He delighted to encourage him in the martial exercises which the prince ardently loved and though he did not abate in his regard for his other sons they repined at the preference given to Aurungzêbe A feat which that prince performed on his birthday when he entered his fifteenth year strengthened his  interest in his father's affections He fought on horseback against an elephant in the presence of the emperor and the whole court and by his dexterity killed that enormous animal The whole empire rung with his praise and the action was celebrated in verse by Saib Selim the best poet of the age The prince Suja naturally highspirited and jealous shewed violent signs of discontent at the preference given to Aurungzêbe He began to look upon his younger brother as designed for the throne and his haughty mind could not endure the thought He wished to be absent from a scene which gave him uneasiness and he prevailed on Mohâbet to write to the emperor requesting that he should be sent to him to the Decan Shaw Jehân consented Suja was created an Omrah of five thousand horse and having received sixty thousand pounds for his expences from the treasury he took leave of his father  Jealousy of Dara  Dara the Imperial prince highly resented the honours conferred on Suja He himself had hitherto remained at court without either office or establishment He complained to his father with great vehemence and the latter endeavoured to sooth his son by insinuating that from his great affection for him he could not permit him to take the field and that in the palace there was no need of the parade of a military command Dara would not be satisfied with these reasons and the emperor to make him easy gave him the command of six thousand horse The prince however could not forget the prior honours of Suja He was told that Mohâbet designed that prince for the throne and there were some grounds for suspicion on that head Had Shaw Jehân had a serious design of favouring Suja he could not have fallen upon more effectual means of serving him than by placing him under the tuition of so able an officer as Mohâbet But he had no intention of that kind He had sixed on Dara as his successor though  there was little policy in his placing Suja in the channel of acquiring the favour of the army a knowledge of the world and a superior skill in war It was upon these grounds that Dara justly complained and the sequel will shew that he judged better than his father of the consequences  Emperor's progress to Cashmire  On the fifth of April the emperor marched from Agra toward Lahore He moved slowly taking the diversion of hunting in all the forests on the way He himself was an excellent sportsman and the writer of his life relates that he shot forty deer with his own hand before he reached Delhi In that city he remained a few days and then proceeded to Lahore where he arrived after a journey of more than a month The governours of the northern provinces met the emperor near the city and with these and his own retinue Shaw Jehân went with great pomp to visit the tomb of his father He distinguished by peculiar attention and acts of favour Mirza Bakir and Sheich Beloli two learned men who resided at Lahore and having made a considerable present to the Fakiers who kept up the perpetual lamp in his father's tomb he set out for the kingdom of Cashmire on the limits of which he arrived on the thirteenth of June Pleasure was his only business to Cashmire He relaxed his mind from public affairs for some days and amused himself with viewing the curious springs the cascades the hanging woods and the lakes which diversify the delightful and romantic face of that beautiful country His progress was celebrated in verse by Mahommed Jân but his care for the state soon brought him back to Lahore  Suja recalled  The Prince Suja arrived in the Imperial army in the Decan while Mohâbet was yet settling the affairs of the conquered dominions of the Nizâm The general received him with all the  distinction due to his birth and soon after put his troops in motion toward Tellingana The enemy forsook the field and betook themselves to their strong holds Mohâbet sat down before Bizida but the garrison defended the place with such obstinacy that the Imperialists made little progress The warm valour of Suja could not brook delay He attributed to the inactivity of Mohâbet what proceeded from the bravery of the enemy and the strength of the place He raised by his murmuring a dissention between the officers of the army Mohâbet remonstrated against the behaviour of Suja and gave him to understand that he himself and not the prince commanded the troops Suja was obstinate Mohâbet sent expresses to court and the prince was recalled He was enraged beyond measure at this indignity but it was prudent to obey He left the camp and Mohâbet falling sick was obliged to raise the siege He returned to Brampour and his disorder having increased in the march put a period to his life in a very advanced age  Death and character of Mohâbet  Mohâbet was one of the most extraordinary characters that ever sigured in India Severe in disposition haughty in command rigid in the execution of his orders he was feared and respected but never beloved by an indolent and effeminate race of men In conduct he was unrivalled in courage he had few equals and none in success In the field he was active daring and intrepid always in perfect possession of his own mind His abilities seemed to rise with the occasion and Fortune could present nothing in battle which his prudence had not foreseen In his political character he was bold in his resolves active and determined in execution As his own soul was above fear he was an enemy to cruelty and he was so honest himself that he seldom suspected others His demeanor was lofty and reserved his manner full of dignity and grace he was generous  and always sincere He attempted high and arduous things rather from a love of danger than from ambition and when he had attained the summit of greatness and might have rested there he descended the precipice because it was full of peril Jehangire owed twice to him his throne once to his valour and once to his moderation and his name gave the empire to Shaw Jehân more than the friendship of Asiph Jâh  Anecdotes  Notwithstanding the great abilities of Mohâbet he seemed to be sensible of his own merit and conscious of his importance in the state He was punctilious about rank and would upon no occasion give place to the visier who would not relinquish the precedence which he derived from his high office The dispute was carried so high between these two great men in the beginning of the reign of Shaw Jehân that it was agreed they should not come to court on the same day The emperor did not chuse to interfere in the contest they were both his benefactors both were powerful in the state and it would not be prudent to disoblige one by giving preference to the claims of the other He however was at last prevailed upon to decide in favour of Asiph And he made his excuse to Mohâbet by saying  "That in all civilized governments the sword should yield to the pen"  Mohâbet submitted but he avoided ever after as much as possible the ceremony of appearing publicly in the presence of the emperor  concerning him  These disputes though they did not break out into an open rupture between the visier and Mohâbet were the source of a coldness between them Shaw Jehân was at no pains to reconcile them He was unwilling to throw the influence of both into one channel and by alternately favouring each he kept alive their jealousy Mohâbet had a numerous party at court and they had once almost ruined the power of Asiph by recommending  him to the emperor as the only fit man for settling the affairs of the Decan His commission was ordered without his knowledge but he fell upon means of turning the artillery of the enemy upon themselves He persuaded the emperor that Mohâbet only was fit to conduct the war at the same time that he made a merit with that general of transferring to him a government the most lucrative and important in the empire  Embassy to the Usbecs  The emperor upon the death of Mohâbet separated the command of the army from the government of the Decan Islam Chan became general of the forces with the title of paymastergeneral and the Subaship was conferred on Chan Zimân the son of Mohâbet In the beginning of January Tirbiet Chan returned from his embassy to Mahommed prince of Balick That lord had been sent to Mahommed to demand redress for the incursions of his subjects into the northern provinces Mahommed excused the insult in submissive letters accompanied with presents the most valuable of which to a prince of Shaw Jehân's amorous disposition was the young and beautiful Malika Shadè the daughter of Mahommed Sultân lineally descended from Timur The emperor received this northern beauty with excess of joy and soon forgot the invasions of the Usbecs in her charms  Emperor returns to Agra  Shaw Jehân after his return from Cashmire continued for some time at Lahore He left that city on the th of January and arrived at Agra on the d of March Nadira the daughter of Purvez and wife of the Imperial prince Dara was brought to bed on the way of a son who received the name of Solimân Sheko from his grandfather Great rejoicings were made upon the birth of the prince and the emperor upon the occasion mounted a new throne formed of solid gold embossed with  various figures and studded with precious stones The throne had been seven years in finishing and the expence of the jewels only amounted to twelve hundred and fifty thousand pounds of our money It was afterwards distinguished by the name of Tuckt Taôus or the Peacock Throne from having the figures of two peacocks standing behind it with their tails spread which were studded with jewels of various colours to represent the life Between the peacocks stood a parrot of the ordinary size cut out of one emerald The finest jewel in the throne was a ruby which had fallen into the hands of Timur when he plundered Delhi in the year Jehangire with peculiar barbarity diminished the beauty and lustre of the stone by engraving upon it his own name and titles and when he was reproved for this piece of vanity by the favourite Sultana he replied  "This stone will perhaps carry my name down further through time than the empire of the house of Timur"  Promotions  The festival on account of the birth of Solimân was succeeded by various promotions at court Aurungzêbe was created an Omrah of five thousand horse and the visier was raised to the high dignity of captaingeneral of the Imperial forces Shaw Jehân was not altogether disinterested in conferring this honour on Asiph He paid him a visit in his own house upon his appointment and received a present of five lacks of roupees which he immediately added to the sum of one million and an half sterling which he laid out in the course of the year on public buildings and on canals for bringing water to Agra  CHAP III  Emperor's expedition to the

PersiaInterrupted by the death of Shaw Sefi  The emperor resolves to invade the Decan  SHAW JEHAN whether most prompted by avarice or by ambition is uncertain formed a resolution to reduce the Mahommedan sovereignties of the Decan into provinces of the Mogul empire The conquests made by his generals were partial They had laid waste but had not subdued the country and when most successful they imposed contributions rather than a tribute on the enemy Even the great abilities of Mohâbet were not attended with a success equal to the sanguine hopes of the emperor and all his prospects of conquest vanished at the death of that able general Shaw Jehân though addicted to the enervating pleasures of the haram was rouzed by his ambition to mark his reign with some splendid conquest  "For it is not enough" he said "for a great prince to send only to his posterity the dominions which he has received from his fathers"  The thought was more  magnificent than wise To improve the conquests of his fathers with true policy would be more useful to his posterity and more glorious to himself than to exhaust his strength in violent efforts to extend the limits of his empire He however had determined on the measure and the advice of his most prudent Omrahs and counsellors was despised  He sets out from Agra  On the first of October he set out from Agra with his usual pomp and magnificence Dowlatabâd was the point to which he directed his march but his progress was politically slow He had given orders to the governors of the provinces to join him with their forces as he advanced and the distance of many of them from the intended scene of action required time to bring them to the field The prince Aurungzêbe attended his father on this expedition and was highly in favour He proposed with a youthful ardor which pleased the emperor to take a circuit with the Imperial camp through the province of Bundela to view the strong holds which he himself under the tuition of Nuserit had some time before taken from the unfortunate Judger Singh The emperor had not as yet collected a force sufficient to ensure success to his arms and to gain time he listened to the request of his son The whole of the year was passed in premeditated delays and in excursions of hunting so that the emperor did not arrive in the Decan till the latter end of the rainy season of the of the Christian aera  He lays waste the enemy's country  The Subas of the different provinces had with their troops joined the emperor on his march His force was prodigious when he entered the borders of the enemy On his arrival at Dowlatabâd he was able to form twelve different armies which under twelve leaders he sent into the kingdoms of Bijapour and Tellingana The princes of the country had collected their forces but  they knew not to which quarter they should direct their march The Imperialists formed a circle round them and war was at once in all parts of their dominions The orders of the emperor were barbarous and cruel He submitted the open country to fire and garrisons that resisted were put to the sword  "War is an evil" he said "and compassion contributes only to render that evil permanent"  The eastern writers describe the miseries of the Decan in the peculiar hyperboles of their diction  "Towns and cities" say they "were seen in flames on every side the hills were shaken with the continual roar of artillery and tigers and the wild beasts of the desert sled from the rage of men"  One hundred and fifteen towns and castles were taken and destroyed in the course of the year The emperor sate in the mean time aloft in the citadel of Dowlatabâd and looked down with horrid joy on the tempest which he himself had raised around  which submits  The devastations committed by the express orders of the emperor had at last the intended effect on the sovereigns of Tellingana and Bijapour Shut up in their strongest forts they could not assist their subjects who were either ruined or massacred without mercy around them They proposed peace in the most humble and supplicating terms Shaw Jehân took advantage of their necessities and imposed severe conditions They were established by commission from the emperor as hereditary governors of their own dominlons upon agreeing to give a large annual tribute the first payment of which was to be made at the signing of the treaty The princes besides were to acknowledge the emperor and his successors lords paramount of the Decan in all their public deeds and to design themselves The humble subjects of the empire of the Moguls  Emperor returns to Ajmere  The treaty being signed and ratified the emperor left his son Aurungzêbe under the tuition of Chan Zimân the son of Mohâbet  at the head of a considerable force to awe his new subjects In the strong holds which had fallen into his hands during the war he placed garrisons and having left the Decan took the route of Ajmere On the eighth of December he arrived in that city and visited the shrine of Moin ul Dien more from a desire to please the superstitious among his courtiers than from his own devotion He had not remained long at Ajmere when the prince Aurungzêbe arrived to celebrate his nuptials with the daughter of Shaw Nawâz the son of Asiph Jàh The visier who had remained during the war at Agra to manage the civil affairs of the empire came to join the court at Ajmere accompanied by Morâd the emperor's youngest son and was present at the splendid festival held in honour of the marriage of his grandson with his granddaughter  Death of Chan Zimân  Soon after the departure of Aurungzêbe from the army in the Decan Chan Zimân fell sick and died His death was much regretted by the whole empire Calm manly and generous he was esteemed respected and beloved He was possessed of all the polite accomplishments of the gentleman he was a brave general a good statesman an excellent scholar and a poet Under his original name of Mirza Amani he published a collection of his poems which are still in high repute for their energy and elegance over all the East The emperor was so sensible of the high merit of Chan Zimân that he sincerely lamented his death and spoke much in his praise in the hall of the presence before the whole nobility  "We did not miss" said he "the abilities of Mohâbet till we lost his son"  Aurungzêbe received immediate orders to repair to the Decan and to take upon himself the sole command of the Imperial army stationed in the conquered provinces  Insurrection in Behâr  During these transactions in Ajmere the revolt of the Raja of Budgepour happened in the province of Behâr The emperor detached a part of the army under Abdalla to suppress the insurrection Abdalla at the same time received a commission to govern Behâr in quality of Suba He attacked and defeated the Raja on his first arrival and that unfortunate prince whose love of independence had made him overlook his own want of power was reduced to the last extremity He shut himself up in a fortress which was invested on all sides When a breach was made in the walls and the orders for the assault were issued the Raja came out of his castle leading his children in his hand He might have been pardoned but his wife appearing behind him sealed his doom She was extremely handsome and Abdalla though old himself wished to grace his haram with a beautiful widow The unfortunate Raja therefore was put to death on the spot as a rebel  Candahâr delivered up to the empire  The news of the defeat and death of the Raja of Budgepour had scarce arrived at court when Shaw Jehân received an agreeable piece of intelligence from the northern frontier of the empire The feeble administration of Sefi who succeeded Shaw Abas in the throne of Persia had thrown the affairs of that kingdom into confusion Ali Murdan commanded in the fortress of Candahâr His fidelity was suspected and besides he saw no end of the troubles which distracted his country He resolved to save himself from the malice of his enemies by delivering the city to the emperor of Hindostan from whose hands it had been wrested by Shaw Abas A negociation was therefore set on foot by Ali Murdan with Seid Chan the governor of Cabul His terms were only for himself Seid closed with him in the name of his sovereign He sent his son in haste with a force to Candahâr which  was delivered by Ali Murdan who set out immediately to pay his respects to his new sovereign  Persian defeated  Sefi no sooner heard of the treachery of Ali Murdan than he issued orders for a force to march from Chorassan to retake Candahâr This expedition was under the conduct of Scâhôsh That officer appeared before the city with seven thousand horse but Seid who commanded in the place sallied out with an inferior force and totally defeated the Persians for which signal service he was raised by the name of Ziffer Jung to the dignity of six thousand horse Gulzâr the governor of Moultan was removed to Candahâr and as a general war with Persia was apprehended the prince Suja was dispatched with a great army to the province of Cabul Before Gulzâr arrived at his new government Seid following his victory over the Persians penetrated into Seistân Bust Zemindâwir and other places fell into his hands and all the district which had formerly been annexed to the government of Candahâr was reduced to subjection by his arms  Ali Murdan rewarded  The emperor was so overjoyed at the recovery of Candahâr that he received Ali Murdan with every mark of esteem and gratitude He was raised to the rank of six thousand horse with the title of captaingeneral of the Imperial forces and invested with the government of Cashmire The service he had done was great but the reward of treachery was extravagant Ali however seemed to possess abilities equal to any rank Bold provident and ambitious he grasped at power and when he had obtained it he kept it during his life by management and intrigue His generosity rendered him popular and before his death he is said to have numbered sixteen thousand families of Afgans Usbecs and Moguls among his clients and dependants  Invasion from Assam  The most remarkable transaction of the year next to the recovery of Candahâr was an invasion of the province of Bengal by the Tartars of Assâm They rushed down the river Birramputa in armed boats to where it falls into the Ganges below Dacca They plundered some of the northern districts and made themselves masters of several small forts Islam governor of Bengal hearing of the invasion marched against the enemy with all the Imperial troops stationed in the province They had the folly to come to action with the Suba and he gave them a signal defeat Four thousand were killed on the spot and five hundred armed vessels fell into the hands of the conqueror The remaining part of the invaders fled and the governor pursued them into their own country Fifteen forts with the king of Assam's soninlaw fell into his hands The whole province of Cochâgi was reduced and he invaded that of Buldive The latter was very obstinately defended Few passes led into it being environed with mountains The Suba at last forced the passes and the enemy fled to the hills  Reduction of Assam  The sovereign of Buldive did not long survive the reduction of his country Worn out with fatigue harassed with grief and tormented with vexation he was seized with a contagious distemper which infected his family and carried him and them off in a few days His people however would not quit their hills The enemy spread devastation over the plain below and the unfortunate Assâmites beheld from the woods the smoke of their burning towns But the unbounded ravages of Iflam occasioned his retreat The grain was inadvertently destroyed in the fire which consumed the towns of Buldive and a scarcity of provisions began to be felt in the Imperial camp Islam marched back with the spoils of Assâm but he suffered incredible hardships from the badness of the roads the torrents which fell from the hills and a distemper which the rainy season now come on had raised in the  army The kingdom of Tibet was at the same time reduced by Ziffer The news of this double conquest came at the same instant to the emperor He was greatly pleased with the success of his arms as none of the Mahommedan princes who had reigned before him in India ever penetrated into those countries  Death of the MahRaja  The eleventh year of the reign of Shaw Jehân commenced with the death of the MahRaja prince of the Rajaputs He was succeeded in the throne by his second son Hussinet Singh it being the established custom of the branch of the Rajaputs called Mahrattors to leave the sceptre to the disposal of the sovereigns by their latter will The Rajaputs properly so called did not acquiesce in the right of Hussinet He had an elder brother and they adhered to him The flames of a civil war were kindied but the emperor interfered and after having examined the claims of both the princes he confirmed the Raja's will in favour of Hussinet whom he raised to the rank of four thousand horse His elder brother who was deprived of all hopes of the throne by the decision of the emperor was also created an Omrah of three thousand  Peace with Persia  The insult which Persia received through the invasion of its territories by the Mogul governor of Candahâr did not raise any spirit of revenge in the court of Ispahan The debility in the councils of Sefi brought on a peace between the empires Shaw Jehân had dispatched Sifder Chan his ambassador to the court of Persia That lord returned this year from Serifa where Sefi resided with a present of five hundred horses some curious animals and various manufactures of Persia to the value of five lacks of roupees Sifder executed his commission so much to his master's satisfaction that he was raised to the dignity of five thousand horse The chief condition of the treaty of peace between Perfia and  Hindostan was an entire cession of Candahâr by the former in favour of the latter  Death of Afzil the emperor's preceptor  The winter of the year had been remarkable for a great fall of snow in the northern provinces of India It extended as far as Lahore and in the mountains of Cabul and Cashmire many villages with all their inhabitants were overwhelmed and destroyed The emperor in the mean time kept his court at Lahore Peace being established on every side he applied himself to the management of the civil government of the empire He issued many salutary edicts for the security of property the improvement of the country and the encouragement of commerce In the midst of his cares for the good of the state he was afflicted with the death of Afzil Chan a man of great literary talents who had been his preceptor The young princes were also educated under his care and they mourned him as a father He had been raised to the first honours of the empire He obtained the rank of seven thousand and the management of the civil affairs of the empire were in a great measure in his hands The emperor to show his great veneration for his abilities allowed him an annual revenue of three hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds  Dara and Suja promoted  Soon after the death of Afzil the princes Dara and Suja were raised to higher ranks of nobility Dara was dignified with the title of an Omrah of ten thousand horse and ten thousand foot and Suja with the rank of seven thousand horse and as many of foot The emperor having frequently declared his intentions of leaving the throne to Dara gave him always the first place in dignities and power He shewed an inclination of habituating his other sons to a submission to Dara and whatever marks of superior affection he might bestow on his younger sons in private in public he directed his principal attention to the eldest Aurungzêbe  was not at court when his brothers were promoted Averse to idleness in his command of the army in the Decan he made an incursion under pretence of injuries into the country of Baglana The forts fell into his hands and the chiefs submitted to a tribute but the sterility and poverty of those regions did neither answer the expence of the war nor that of keeping the possession of the conquered country He therefore evacuated the places which he had taken and depended for the tribute on the future fears of the enemy Having brought back the army within the limits of the empire Aurungzêbe who was jealous of the influence of Dara with the emperor requested leave of absence and came to Lahore where his father at the time resided  Suja made governor of Bengal  The prince Suja who had been sent with an army to Cabul when a war with Persia was apprehended had for some time remained in that city His wife dying he returned on the twentythird of June to Lahore where he was married with great pomp and solemnity to the daughter of Azim Complaints having been sent to court against Islam governor of Bengal he was removed from his office and Suja was ordered to proceed with a commission into that kingdom to restore the civil regulations which had been ruined by the rapacity of Islam Abdalla governor of Behâr had also fallen under the emperor's displeasure for some oppressions which he had exercised in the execution of justice Shaw Jehân who was a severe justiciary would not even have his representatives in the provinces suspected of partiality in the distribution of the laws He heard the complaints of the poorest subjects from the most distant corners of the empire and the influence of the first men in the state was not sussicient to protect the delinquents from his resentment He was therefore beloved by the people and reverenced and feared by the great An Imperial order was issued to Abdalla to appear in  the presence to give a public account of his administration and Shaista the son of the visier was raised to the government of Behâr Abdalla had the good fortune to clear himself of the aspersions thrown on his character by his enemies and he was sent with a considerable force against insurgents in the province of Bundela and some Rajas who from their hills made depredatory incursions into Behâr  Excellent government of the emperor  Abdalla no sooner arrived in the place of his destination than peace was restored The banditti who infested the country fled precipitately to their mountains and dispersed themselves to their several homes Some examples of justice upon those who fell into the hands of the Imperialists confirmed the tranquillity which now was general over all the empire The attention of the emperor to the improvement of his dominions his impartial execution of justice his exact but not oppressive mode of collecting the revenues rendered his people happy and his empire flourishing A lover of pleasure himself though not fond of parade and shew his haram was a considerable market for the finest manufactures and the ample provision made for his sons and nobles rendered his capital a cluster of princely courts where magnificence and elegant luxury prevailed in the extreme He divided his time between the hall of audience and the haram He heard complaints with patience he decided with precision and equity and when his mind was fatigued with business he dived into the elegant and secret apartments of his women who being the natives of different countries presented to his eyes a variety of charms  The capital of Bengal destroyed by fire  Suja to whom a son was born soon after his arrival in Bengal narrowly escaped with his life from a fire which broke out in the capital of the province Many of his servants and some  of his women were destroyed in the flames and the whole city was burnt down to the ground Rajamâhil never recovered from this disaster The waters of the Ganges joined issue with the flames in its destruction The ground on which it stood was carried away by the river and nothing now remains of its former magnificence except some wells which as the earth in which they were sunk has been carried away by the stream appear like spires in the channel of the river when its waters are low  Ali Murdan promoted  Ali Murdan who for the delivery of Candahâr to the emperor had been gratified with the government of Cashmire returned to court at Lahore on the eighteenth of October No complaints against his administration having been preferred in the hall of audience he was received with distinction and favour To reward him for the equity and justice of his government he was raised to the government of Punjâb with a power of holding Cashmire by deputy Ali Murdan took immediate possession of his new office and the emperor signified to his son Aurungzêbe that his presence in the Decan was necessary to superintend the affairs of his government which in the hands of deputies might fall into confusion from the distance of the conquered provinces from the seat of empire  Return of the ambassador to the Ottoman emperor  When Aurungzêbe set out for the Decan the emperor resolving upon a tour to Cashmire moved the Imperial camp northward from Lahore Whilst he amused himself in that beautiful country Mahommed Zerif whom he had some time before sent ambassador to Constantinople returned to court Morâd who at that time held the Ottoman scepter had received Zerif with every mark of respect and esteem The empires having no political business to settle the embassy was chiesly an affair of compliment with a request to permit Zeriff to purchase some fine horses  in Arabia Morâd not only granted the required favour but even gave to the ambassador several horses of the highest blood with furniture of solid gold studded with precious stones as a present to Shaw Jehân The emperor was highly pleased with the reception given to his ambassador and he was charmed with the beauty of the horses On the seventeenth of February he set out for Lahore the business of the empire requiring his presence nearer its center  Calamitous floods  When he was upon the road a prodigious fall of rain laid the whole country under water No dry spot was left for pitching the Imperial tent and he was obliged to sleep for several nights in a boat His army were in the mean time in the utmost distress Their horses without provender and they themselves destitute of provisions Four thousand families were swept away and drowned by the river Bêhat On the banks of the Choshal the destruction was greater still Seven hundred villages were carried away with their inhabitants and every day brought fresh accounts of disasters from other parts of the country through which the branches of the Indus flow When the waters began to subside the emperor hastened his march The scene which presented itself to his eyes as he advanced was full of horror Boats were seen sticking in the tops of trees the fish were gasping on dry land the bodies of men and animals were mixed with the wreck of villages and mud and sand covered the whole face of the country He was so much affected with the misery of his subjects that he issued an edict for the remission of the taxes for a year to the countries which had suffered by that dreadsul calamity He also made donations from the public treasury to many of the farmers to enable them to maintain their families and continuing his journey arrived on the first of April at Lahore  Bust surprised and retaken  During these disasters on the banks of the Indus Bust was surprised by the Persian governor of the province of Seïstân Gulzâr who commanded for the empire in Candahâr detached a part of the garrison under his lievtenant Leitif Chan to retake the place He summoned Bust upon his arrival but the Persians refused to surrender He began his approaches and after a smart siege in which his vigilance activity and courage did him great honour he took Bust The garrison were made prisoners and Leitif pursuing the advantage which he had obtained made incursions into Seïstan and carried off great booty with which he returned to Candahâr The debility of the councils of Persia suffered this affront to pass without revenge  An ambassador from Constantinople  In the summer of the year Arselan Aga who had accompanied Zerif from Constantinople as ambassador from Morâd had his audience of leave of the emperor He was presented with twelve thousand pounds for the expences of his journey home and he was charged with magnificent presents for his master News at the same time arrived at court that the oppressions committed by Azim governor of Guzerat had occasioned an insurrection at the head of which the two chiefs Jami and Bahara appeared Azim possessed of an immense revenue soon raised a force which in the end reduced the insurgents but all the money which ought to have been remitted to the treasury was expended in the war The emperor was enraged at his conduct He deprived him of his government and ordered him to repair to court to give an account of his administration His friends interceded in his behalf The emperor was inflexible till a fair consin of Azim who was retained in the Imperial haram threw herself at his feet and not only obtained the pardon of the governor but even his reinstatement in his former office After he had  passed his word in favour of Azim to this weeping beauty he commanded her never more to appear in his presence  "For" said he "I will not have my justice perverted by my weakness"  The prince Morâd distinguishes himself  Morâd the fourth son of the emperor was now in the seventeenth year of his age Like his brothers he was highspirited and a lover of war An opportunity offered which suited his disposition Jagenât Singh a prince on the confines of Marwâr who was a subject of the empire revolted and issuing from his native mountains spread devastation through the neighbouring plains The active spirit of Morâd flew before him He outstripped the news of his coming by his expedition surprised defeated and pursued the prince to his fort of Tara Cudda in which after a smart siege he was taken but pardoned upon conditions The emperor was pleased with the vigour which he discovered in the soul of Morâd and he received him upon his return with great distinction and affection  Death of the visier  The death of the visier Asiph Jâh in the seventysecond year of his age was the most remarkable event of the succeeding year His daughter Moina Bânu the sister of the favourite Sultana and wife of Seif Chan the highsteward of the household died a short time before her father and his grief for her as he was wornout with business infirmities and age seems to have hastened his death which happened on the twentieth of November He was born in Tartary many years before his father Aiâss quitted that country to push his fortune in Hindostan and he did not leave the place of his nativity till the affairs of his father assumed a very favourable aspect in the court of the emperor Akbâr The merit of Aiâss raised himself to the first offices of the state and his son was not of a disposition to relinquish the advantages which his family had gained Habituated to business  under his father he succeeded him in the office of visier and managed the affairs of the empire with great address during the remaining part of the reign of Jehangire The active part which he took to secure the empire for Shaw Jehân met with every return of gratitude from that prince who soon after his accession raised him to an office superior in dignity to that of visier called Vakiel Mutuluck or absolute minister of the empire The emperor who had the sincerest affection for his daughter the mother of so many princes and princesses distinguished Asiph in his conversation with the title of Father He dignified that minister at the same time with many pompous titles In public deeds he was styled The Strength of the Realm the Protector of the Empire the Powerful Prince the Lord of Lords the revered Father of Wisdom the Leader of Armies in rank great as ASIPH and a Lion in War  He leaves his fortune to prince Dara  Though three sons and five daughters survived the visier he adopted his grandson Dara the Imperial prince and constituted him heir to all his fortune He excused himself to his sons by saying that he had already raised them to high ranks and employments in the state and that if they conducted themselves with prudence and wisdom the favour of the emperor would be to them an ample fortune  "But should Folly be the ruler of your conduct" continued Asiph "you do not deserve to possess the wealth which I have acquired by my services"  There was prudence in the conduct of Asiph upon this occasion The emperor loved money and he might have availed himself of the law which constitutes the prince the heir of all his officers and a dispute of that kind might prove fatal to the influence and interest of the family of the visier He however divided before his death three hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds among his children and servants Dara in terms of his will took possession  of the bulk of his fortune which in coin in jewels in plate elephants and horses amounted to near four millions sterling exclusive of his estates in land which according to the tenures in India reverted to the crown  His character  Though the abilities of Asiph Jâh were little known under the wise and able administration of his father they broke forth with lustre when he himself came into the first office in the state He was a great orator a fine writer an able politician In his private character he was mild affable humane generous in his public severe reserved inflexible exact He never excused negligence he punished disobedience His orders therefore were no sooner issued than they were executed his very nod was respected understood and obeyed He was possessed of political as well as personal courage as little afraid of the unjust reproaches of his friends as he was of the weapons of his enemies and he was often heard to say  "That he who fears death is unworthy of life"  He was uniform in his conduct impartial and dignified in his actions consistent with himself He courted not popularity by his measures justice propriety and the ultimate good of the state and not the applause of the vulgar were his objects in all his decisions He was fit for the field as well as adapted for the cabinet and had he not gained renown with the pen he would have commanded it with the sword In his youth he was addicted to poetry He wrote upon heroic subjects and the fire of his genius was such that the very sound of his verse animates the soul to war The glory and happiness of India during his long administration were great and when war raged on the frontiers the interior provinces enjoyed uninterrupted peace The field in which he moved was extensive but his eye comprehended the whole An eastern writer continues the metaphor and says  "That he rendered that field flourishing and fruitful He passed  through it with reputation and lustre and when he sunk into the grave a cloud of sorrow obscured the face of the empire"  His sons  The original name of the eldest son of Asiph was Mirza Morâd He was dignified afterwards with the title of Shaista Chan and he was governor of Behâr at the death of his father He possessed not the abilities of his family being of an infirm and sickly constitution with a delicate rather than a vigorous and active mind Mirza Misti the second son of Asiph was a youth of great hopes vigorous active and full of fire He lost his life in a drunken frolic for being one day at the river Behât in Cashmire when it foamed over its banks he spurred his horse into the stream by way of bravado and for his temerity was drowned Mirza Hussein the third son of the visier was a man of moderate abilities and his fourth son who had been dignified with the title of Shaw Nawâz was a nobleman of great reputation and high distinction in the empire  Justice of the emperor  The emperor jealous of the influence which the governors of the provinces might acquire by a long continuance in their offices made a practice of removing them every third year When the news of any oppression committed by them arrived at court they were instantly superseded and upon examination if found guilty divested of all their honours and confined The punishment of death seemed to have been laid aside from the commencement of this regin Tirbiet Chan was this year ordered back from the government of Cabul for his severity in exacting the revenue from the poor The emperor himself had been a witness of the miserable condition to which the people of that province were reduced by the floods in the rivers Choshal and Behât and they had not yet recovered from that grievous calamity They were unable to pay their rents and Tirbiet submitted them  to the rigours of military execution He was divested of his honours as well as of his government and the emperor issued money from the treasury to relieve thirty thousand of the inhabitants whom the exactions of Tirbiet had reduced to want  "Remember" said the emperor to his nobles "that when you are too severe on my people you only injure me for it is but just I should pay for losses occasioned by my wrong choice of officers to govern the provinces of my empire"  Ali Murdan was appointed to the government of Cabul in the room of Tirbiet He was succeeded in that of Cashmire by Ziffer Complaints had been received against the prince Aurungzèbe from the Decan His father ordered him to the presence to answer to the charge which he did to satisfaction and was forthwith reinstated in his government  Persian invasion threatened  The cruelty of Shaw Sefi of Persia had crowded hitherto his reign with tumult and misfortune The empire suffered in its consequence with foreign powers during years which Sefi distinguished only with the blood of his subjects His intentions against Ali Murdan lost him the strong fortress of Candahâr and he took no measures to revenge the insults which he received on his frontiers after that place had fallen into the hands of the Moguls The tumults of the Persians were at length quelled in their blood and Sefi having destroyed his domestic enemies turned his attention to his foreign foes Having collected a great army he took the field and moved toward Candahâr with a professed design to retake that city  Prevented by the death of Shaw Sefi  The news of the motions of the Persian was brought by express to the court of Agra The emperor was alarmed He gave a commission to the Imperial prince Dara to command an army of fifty thousand men The troops were soon ready and  the prince took the route of Cabul Thirty thousand men stationed on the frontiers flocked also to the standard of Dara upon his arrival at Cabul Morâd the emperor's fourth son was posted with twenty thousand men behind the Nilâb with orders to reinforce in case of a requisition for that purpose the army of Dara But these formidable preparations were in the event unnecessary Sefi to the great joy of his subjects fell sick and died The war which was begun by him was dropt with his other measures by his successor The Persians retreated and Dara and Morâd returned to their father who still kept his court at Lahore Morâd soon after his return to the presence married a daughter of Shaw Nawâz the son of the late visier Asiph  Affairs at court  The emperor who took pleasure in managing in person the affairs of his empire created no visier upon the death of Asiph That lord's deputy in office without any rank or title managed the business of the department and by a special commission countersigned all public edicts Aliverdi governor of Punjâb who resided at Lahore which had formerly been the capital of his government had the imprudence to speak contemptuously of this mode of transacting the public business He said That the emperor from extreme avarice endeavouring to save to himself the usual appointments bestowed on visiers had thrown disgrace upon his own administration He made no secret of his sarcasms and they were carried to Shaw Jehân He sent for Aliverdi and said to that lord  "You do not like I am told my mode of governing my subjects and therefore Aliverdi shall not assist in an administration which he does not love"  He was immediately divested of his government and honours and dismissed with ignominy from the presence The prince Morâd was raised to the vacant government and having received magnificent presents from the emperor set out for Moultân The emperor in the mean  time assisted at a grand festival which he gave to his court upon opening the new gardens of Shalimâr which had been begun in the fourth year of his reign The gardens were laid out with admirable taste and the money expended upon them amounted to the enormous sum of one million sterling  CHAP IV  ReflectionsEmperor arrives at AgraIncidents at courtIncursions of the UsbecsAurungzêbe removed from the DecanSadulla Chan made visierBuduchshân invaded

governments the Despot is every thing and the people nothing HE is the only object of attention and when he sits in the midst of tranquillity the page of the historian languishes in the detail of unimportant events His hall of audience is a court of summary justice His decisions are rapid and they are generally impartial as his situation has placed him beyond the limits of fear and of favour But there is a sameness which never plcases in the transactions of a government whose operations run through one unchangeable channel and it is for this reason only we pass lightly over the more peaceable years of the reign of Shaw Jehân In these he acted in the character of a judge a mere determinator if the word may be used of  differences between individuals and it must be confessed that he had abilities to see and integrity to do what was right  Emperor arrives at Agra  Lahore during the former reign had been considered as the capital of the empire and the most settled residence of the prince Jehangire whose lungs were weak wished to breathe in the free air of the north and the improvements which he made in the palace and gardens had rendered Lahore the most convenient and beautiful if not the most magnificent of the Imperial residences Shaw Jehân however whose attention to the affairs of the empire was always uppermost in his mind thought Lahore too distant from the southern provinces which on account of their wealth were the most important division of his dominions He therefore resolved as there was a prospect of permanent tranquillity on the northern frontier to remove his court to Agra where he arrived in the month of November The cavalcade which attended his progress was magnificent and numerous beyond description The armies returned from the north were in his train and half the citizens of Lahore who from his long residence in that place were become in a manner his domestics accompanied him on his march He pitched his tents in the gardens of his favourite wife Mumtâza Zemân The tomb of that princess was now finished at a great expence and he endowed with lands a monastery of Fakiers whose business it was to take care of the tomb and to keep up the perpetual lamps over her shrine  Applies to the public business  Nothing material happened during nine months after the emperor's arrival at Agra The public business which had been neglected through the alarm of the Persian war took up a part of his time and pleasure appropriated to itself the rest Several beautiful acquisitions had been made in the haram and the  emperor's attention to the execution of justice was interrupted by his love for women A son was in the mean time born to Dara the Imperial prince Shaw Jehân who loved his son gave a magnificent festival upon the occasion His posterity began to multiply apace A son was born to Aurungzêbe whom he named Mahommed Mauzim and Morâd had this year a daughter whom he called ZêbeulNissa or The Ornament of Women The emperor in the course of the year made an excursion to Ajmere and after he returned to Agra Dara was seized with a violent fever which endangered his life  An accident  The emperor's alarm for Dara was scarce subsided when a dreadful accident happened to his eldest daughter whom he loved above all his children Returning one night from visiting her father to her own apartments in the haram she unfortunately brushed with her clothes one of the lamps which stood in the passage Her clothes caught fire and as her modesty being within hearing of men would not permit her to call for assistance she was scorched in a terrible manner She rushed into the haram in flames and there were no hopes of her life The emperor was much afflicted He gave no audience for several days He distributed alms to the poor he opened the doors of prisons and he for once became devout to bribe Heaven for the recovery of his favourite child He however did not in the mean time neglect the common means AnitAlla the most famous physician of the age was brought express from Lahore and the Sultana though by slow degrees was restored to health  Rashness and death of Amar Singh  The princess had scarce recovered when the emperor himself escaped from imminent danger The brother of the Maraja whose name was Amar Singh having rebelled against the decision  of Shaw Jehân in favour of his father's will was defeated by a detachment of the Imperial army and sent prisoner to court When he was brought into the emperor's presence he was forced by the lords in waiting to make the usual submissions and the emperor pronounced his pardon from the throne desiring him at the same time to take his place among the lords in the rank which had been conferred upon him on a former occasion He accordingly took his place but being a young man of a proud and ungovernable spirit he burnt with rage at the late indignity as well as at the past injury done him by the emperor in preferring to him his younger brother He drew his dagger in secret and rushed furiously toward the throne Sillabut Chan the paymastergeneral of the forces threw himself before Amar who plunged his dagger in his body and stretched him dead at his feet Chilulla Seid Sallâr and several other lords drew immediately their swords and slew the Hindoo prince on the spot The emperor who had descended from his throne with his sword in his hand ordered the body to be dragged out of the hall of audience A number of his followers seeing their master dead fell upon the guards and fought till they were cut off to a man  Incursions of the Usbecs  The Usbees who had for a long time remained quiet made an incursion this year into the territories of the empire They were led by Kuli the general of Mahommed king of the Western Usbecs Ali Murdan governor of Cabul marched out and defeated the invaders He followed his victory and driving the fugitives beyond the limits of the empire ravaged their country as far as Balick and returned with a considerable booty The news of the victory arrived at Agra on the day that another son was born to Dara the Imperial prince The emperor expressed his satisfaction on this double occasion of joy by restoring Abdalla his own former friend to the dignities of which he had  been deprived on account of his mismanagements in the government of the province of Behâr Abdalla however did not long enjoy the good change in his fortune He died in the eightieth year of his age having been sixty years a noble of the empire At the time of his death he was possessed of the dignity of six thousand horse He had passed through all the various vicissitudes of fortune He was engaged in every war and was unsuccessful in all yet he was esteemed an able and active general  Aurungzêbe removed from the Decan  Dara by his constant residence with his father had gained an ascendency over his mind The prince was free generous and manly pleasing in conversation affable polite and mild The emperor loved him as a friend as well as a son he listened to his advice and studied to please him He represented to his father that it was dangerous to the repose of the empire to leave so long the management of the Decan in the hands of Aurungzêbe  "I trust" says he "to my brother's honour but why should the happiness of the emperor depend upon the honour of any man Aurungzêbe possesses abilities and his manner and perhaps his integrity has gained him many friends They in their ambition may persuade him to things which without their advice he would abhor The army he commands are by habit accustomed to perform his pleasure and are attached to his person What if they should prefer the spoils of the empire to their watchful campaigns on our frontiers Are the troops debauched by the loose manners of the capital sit to cope with men inured to arms To foresee danger is to no purpose" continued Dara "unless it is prevented It is my part to advise my father and sovereign his to do what he pleases but to remove Aurungzêbe from the government of the Decan is to remove temptation from that prince If he is that devout man he pretends to  be he will thank Heaven for being deprived of the means of committing crimes"  Reflections of the emperor  The emperor was sensible of the justice of Dara's observations and he complied with his request He was naturally fond of his children he liked their spirit and loved their aspiring genius He was however too prudent not to foresee the disturbances which were likely to rise from even their good qualities His affection when they were young prevented him from following the policy of other Despots by shutting up every access of knowledge from their minds and to keep them at court after they had commanded armies and provinces would be a perpetual source of animofity between them and of uneasiness to himself He was heard often to say  "I have the sons I wish yet I wish I had no sons"  But hitherto he had no just reason to complain they kept on apparent good terms with one another and they implicitly obeyed his commands  Aurungzêbe sent into Guzerat  Orders were sent to Aurungzêbe to remove to Ahmedabâd the capital of Guzerat where he should find a commission to govern that province The prince obeyed and Chan Dowran who had lately been governor of Cashmire was advanced to the superintendency of the conquered provinces and to the command of the troops stationed on the southern frontiers of the empire Dowran did not live to enjoy his high office being assassinated by one of his domestics whom he had punished for some crime Sixty lacks of roupees or about seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds of our money were found in coin and jewels in his tent The emperor was his heir as he had amassed his fortune in his service He had been governor of several provinces and he possessed the rank of seven thousand horse in the empire When the news of his death came to court Islam Chan was appointed  his successor and that lord set out for his government in the month of August of the year  Sadulla made visier  The emperor it has been already observed did not appoint any successor to Asiph Jâh in the high office of visier Sadulla the chief secretary of Asiph who was acquainted with the business of the empire transacted the duties of the office without the name He was a man of abilities His experience in his department recommended him first to the emperor and when he came to know him better he esteemed him for his integrity He was sent for one day to the presence and the emperor without previously acquainting him of his design delivered to him the seals of the empire and at the same time presented him with a patent for the dignity of five thousand horse  Ali Murdan invades Buduchshân  Whilst these things are transacted at court Ali Murdan governor of Cabul continued his incursions into the dominions of the Usbecs He took the fort of Shermud in Buduchshân and some other strong towns When the winter came on he retreated into his province and took that opportunity of paying his respects to the emperor who upon his return from a tour to Cashmire had stopt at Lahore Shaw Jehân approved of his incursions and recommended to him to continue the war Ali returned to Cabul and led his army to the north in the beginning of the spring He took the direct road to Balick but the enemy turning his rear cut off both his supplies and his communication with Hindostan They at the same time laid waste their own country by carrying off or destroying the grain and cattle Ali thought it prudent to retreat but the Usbecs had retaken the forts which had when he advanced fallen into his hands He a second time laid siege to Shermud and having forced it to surrender he established posts along the skirts of Buduchshân  and then returned to Cabul An ambassador charged with rich presents was dispatched this year to the court of Persia to congratulate Shaw Abas the Second upon his accession to the throne  Death and character of NoorJehân  The emperor had not been returned to Lahore many days before the famous NoorJehân the favourite Sultana of his father Jehangire died in her palace in that city Twentyfive thousand pounds had been annually paid to her out of the treasury and as her power ceased with the death of her consort she was too proud even to speak of public affairs and she therefore gave up her mind to study retirement and ease The extraordinary beauty of her person has been already mentioned we shall now delineate the features of her mind Her abilities were uncommon for she rendered herself absolute in a government in which women are thought incapable of bearing any part Their power it is true is sometimes exerted in the haram but like the virtues of the magnet it is silent and unperceived NoorJehân stood forth in public she broke through all restraint and custom and acquired power by her own address more than by the weakness of Jehangire Ambitious passionate insinuating cunning bold and vindictive yet her character was not stained with cruelty and she maintained the reputation of chastity when no restraint but virtue remained Her passions were indeed too masculine When we see her acting the part of a soldier she excites ridicule more than admiration and we are apt to forget that delicacy beyond which her sex ceases to please  War with the Usbecs  The ineffectual expedition of Ali against the Usbecs did not induce the emperor to relinquish the war He set up an antiquated claim which his ancestors had on Buduchshân and  the district of Balich and moved with a great army toward Cabul to support his pretensions When he arrived in that city he detached fifty thousand horse with a large train of artillery under the conduct of prince Morâd to the north Nidder Mahommed who had taken Balich and its district by force from the Usbecs shut himself up in that city where he was besieged by Morâd Mahommed made but a poor defence for he evacuated the place in a few days Morâd entered the city in triumph He protected the inhabitants from being plundered and detached a party in pursuit of Mahommed His own army fell in the mean time upon Mahommed and having plundered him of sixty lacks of roupees separated and left him alone The unfortunate prince had no resource but to fly his dominions which were now overrun by the conquerors He hoped to engage Persia in his interest and he hastened to Ispahan The prince Morâd in the mean time took all his towns and castles at leisure there was no enemy in the field and scarce a garrison within the walls Having left detachments of his army in the conquered countries he moved toward the frontiers of the empire and waited there for orders of recal  Moràd disgraced  The emperor having fixed his mind upon the complete conquest of Buduchshân and Balich had no intention of withdrawing his army from these provinces Morâd became impatient He wrote letters to his father He pretended want of health he said he disliked the country and he earnestly requested leave to return Shaw Jehân knowing the real state of his son's health was much offended at his request He commanded him to remain in the north to settle the country according to the instructions given to him and not to attempt to enter the dominions of Hindostan without orders Morâd having a violent inclination  to be near the capital in case of his father's death and preferring the rich and fertile provinces of the south to the sterile regions of the north obstinately disobeyed the emperor left the army and returned to Cabul His father resented this undutiful behaviour He formally divested him of the government of Moultân and of all his dignities without admitting him into his presence He at the same issued an edict which banished Morâd to the mountains of Peshâwir Sadulla the visier was sent to settle the affairs of the north  Prince of the Usbecs slies Persia  The fugitive prince Mahommed having arrived at Ispahan was treated by Shaw Abas with great friendship and respect He received at different times four lacks of roupees for his subsistence He however could obtain no aid His applications were counteracted by the ambassador of India and besides the Persian was not fond of war The bad success of Mahommed soured his temper He spoke disrespectfully of Shaw Abas and his ministers His subsistence was withdrawn and he was reduced to great distress Sadulla in the mean time settled the affairs of Balich In the year he was recalled to court and the emperor returned to Lahore Morâd in the mean time wrote letters of contrition to his father He owned his error and expressed his grief His friends solicited warmly in his favour He was permitted to come to court and by his prudent management he soon regained the affections of his father who restored him to his dignities and to the government of Moultân  Usbecs invade Balich  When the prince of Balich was deserted by his own army and obliged to take refuge in Persia his son Abdul Azîz who commanded a body of troops in another part of the province threw himself under the protection of the northern Usbecs The petty chieftains beyond the Oxus were induced by promises of  advantage to themselves to join his small squadron so that he soon found himself at the head of an army He however could not cover his intentions of invading the conquered dominions of his father from the Mogul garrison of Balich who sent advices of the approaching storm to the emperor That monarch issued orders to his son Aurungzêbe to leave Guzerât and to hasten to take the command of the army in the north The emperor himself marched to Cabul to sustain the operations of his son whilst Dara commanded another army in the environs of Lahore Shaw Jehân upon this occasion shewed an instance of his generosity Two of the sons of the prince of Balich together with some of his wives and daughters had been taken prisoners in the war The sons he raised to the rank of nobles and the women were treated with the decency and respect due to their quality  Aurungzêbe sent against them  Aurungzêbe who was fond of action posted with great expedition to Balich He took the command of the troops upon his arrival and he was informed that the enemy were by that time advanced to within a few miles of the place He surveyed the works and made temporary repairs then devolving the command of the garrison upon Raja Mado Singh he marched out against the Usbecs with the troops which had flocked in to his standard from the untenable posts in the province Bahadur of the Rohilla tribe of Afgans commanded the vanguard Ali Murdan was stationed on the right wing and Ziffer on the left The prince himself after having marshalled the field took his post in the center The enemy seeing the good order and firmness of the Moguls declined for that day to come to action They however skirmished with small parties whilst the main body retreated Night coming on Aurungzêbe lay on his arms  He comes to action  When daylight appeared the prince formed his line of march and pursued the Usbecs Several detachments of the enemy hovered round and insulted him from time to time whilst others turned his rear and began to plunder a part of his baggage the main body in the mean time began to form in his front The prince detached parties from the line who drove the flying squadrons of the enemy from the field He then drew up his forces in the same order as on the preceding day but Ziffer from exerting himself too much was seized with a violent fever and obliged to devolve his command on his son He scarce had retired when Abdul Azîz advanced upon the Imperialists with his whole force Ziffer again mounted his horse and when he returned to his post he found his son in close engagement with the Usbecs The enemy advanced with redoubled violence but Ziffer who now had resumed the command stood his ground with great spirit and firmness till he received nine wounds He fell with loss of blood from his horse and two of his sons covered him from the Usbecs and carried him between their horses to the rear  defeats  Abdul Azîz in the mean time with ten thousand Tartar horse fell in sword in hand with Ali Murdan on the right The contest was fierce and bloody The Tartars proud of their native valour despised the opposition of troops whom they deemed inferior to themselves the Imperialists being chiefly composed of soldiers from the north and better disciplined than the Tartars to war stood their ground with great firmness and checked the confident bravery of the enemy Ali exhibited all the qualities of an able general and valiant soldier he sometimes encouraged his troops by words but oftener by example and finding that the enemy charged in a deep column he contracted and strengthened his line The Usbecs were thrice repulsed but defeat only rendered them more desperate In the fourth charge  the Imperialists were thrown into confusion but they were rather borne down than defeated They were on the point of flying but Aurungzêbe came in to their aid  the Usbecs▪  The prince had been engaged in the center where the action had not been so hot Finding how affairs went on the right he formed into a column and advanced on full speed on the flank of Abdul Azîz That chief however was ready to receive him The shock was violent and bloody A mighty shout arose on either side and men seemed to forget they were mortal The Usbec was at the last overpowered and driven off the field with great slaughter Aurungzêbe thought himself in possession of a complete victory but the battle was not yet over The enemy took a circuit round the right where Ali was restoring the line of his broken squadrons and fell upon the rear of the Imperialists The vanguard had retired thither after the commencement of the action and formed a line round the artillery which had been little used Abdul Azîz attacked them with great violence and drove them from the guns Bahadur who commanded the vanguard rallied them and sustained the charge till Aurungzêbe came up in full speed from the line Abdul Azîz was again repulsed with great slaughter and the remains of the Usbec army quitted the field in disorder  and takes their camp  The prince after the action was over advanced and took possession of the enemy's camp It was now dark and such an impression had the valour of the enemy made upon the Imperialists that even the flight of the vanquished could not convince them of their victory A panic seized the victors frequent alarms disturbed the night and though fatigued and wearied they lay sleepless upon their arms Morning appearing convinced them of their error and discovered to them how much they had done by  the number of the slain Ten thousand lay dead on the field Many officers of distinction fell on the Imperial side and Aurungzêbe justly acquired great reputation from the fortunate end of such an obstinate battle  They are driven from Buduchshan  The Usbecs under their gallant leader being frustrated in their designs on Balich by the signal victory obtained over them fell upon the province of Buduchshân Despairing of conquering that province they laid it waste and filled their rout with confusion desolation and death Express upon express was sent to Cabul to the emperor and he forthwith detached twenty thousand horse under the prince Morâd to expel the enemy The Usbecs weakened in the late bloody battle with Aurungzêbe were in no condition to face Morâd They fled before that prince beyond the limits of the province and left an undisturbed conquest to the family of Timur  They submit  Nidder Mahommed who left the court of Persia upon advice of the invasion under his son received on the way the news of the unfortunate battle in which all his hopes were blasted To contend longer in arms against Shaw Jehân was impossible he therefore had recourse to submission and intreaty He sent a letter to Aurungzêbe  "To the emperor" said he "I dare not write But you descended from the victorious line of sovereigns who support with your sword their title to command the world may find an opportunity of presenting the request of Mahommed among those of his meanest subjects and he who confers happiness on mankind will relent at the misfortunes of an exiled prince Inform him that Nidder Mahommed wishes to be numbered among the servants of the King of Kings and waits melancholy on the skirts of his dominions to receive his answer"  Aurungzêbe sent the letter to his father The emperor moved by  prudence as much as by pity for Mahommed ordered his son to reinstate that prince in his sovereignty over his former dominions It was difficult to defend such a distant frontier against the incursions of the Usbecs beyond the Oxus and he made a merit of his policy by restoring the provinces of Balich and Buduchshân to Mahommed upon condition of receiving a small annual tribute That prince being sick sent his grandson Chusero to Aurungzêbe to sign the terms of this pacification  Emperor returns to Lahore  The emperor in the month of April of the year returned to Lahore and Aurungzêbe after the treaty was signed and ratified joined his father in that city He was appointed to the government of Moultân to which province he went after remaining a very few days at court The prince Suja was at the same time sent to command in the province of Cabul to watch the motions of the Tartars on the northern frontier The war with the Usbecs was undertaken through wantonness and ended though successful with loss to the empire Six millions were expended upon it out of the Imperial treasury besides estates granted to the nobility to the value of one million more The emperor had a puff of reputation for this enormous sum  Jealous of his sons  Shaw Jehân who became jealous of the abilities and ambition of his sons repented sincerely of having raised them to the first offices of the state and to the government of the richest provinces of the empire They had hitherto maintained a shew of implicit obedience but the nation looked up to their power and consequence and seemed apparently to divide themselves into parties in their favour To prevent them from taking a stronger hold of the affections of the people he removed them from one province to another to prevent an increase in their popularity and to inure  them to obedience In the midst of this policy the complying weakness of the father prevailed over the prudence of the monarch None of his sons liked the northern provinces They suited not with their pride and they were not fit for their ambition They were destitute of treasure to acquire dependants they abounded not in lucrative employments to gratify friends Morâd by an act of disobedience had quitted the north Aurungzêbe by his address was permitted to leave it and Suja by his friends at court wrought so much upon the emperor that he was removed from Cabul to the government of Bengal  Resides at Delhi  The emperor ever fond of sestivals found an opportunity of exhibiting his generosity and hospitality upon finishing the repairs of the city of Delhi Seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds had been laid out on the Imperial palace in which the emperor mounted the throne of his ancestors on the first of April of the year The nobility paid their compliments with magnificent presents and their ladies waited with gifts of value upon the most favoured of the emperor's wives During nine days the whole city as well as the court were entertained at the public expence Magnificent dresses were distributed among the great officers and several new Omrahs among whom were the two sons of prince Dara were created Hamid one of the disciples of the great Abul Fazil presented upon the occasion to the emperor a history of the first ten years of his reign and received a princely present  Promotions  The emperor remained at Delhi nine months and returned to Lahore in the end of December the same year Soon after his arrival in that latter city he raised the visier to the rank of seven thousand and gratified him at the same time with the government of Behâr which he was permitted to hold by deputy  The abilities of this lord in his high deportment and above all his unintriguing disposition if the expression may be used recommended him in the highest degree to his master He never sought a favour of the emperor and he conferred none without his permission His assiduity to please consisted in his undeviating attention to business and he gained the affections of his prince by making him believe that he was the sole spring which moved all the affairs of his own empire The vanity of Shaw Jehân induced him to wish that every thing were done by himself and the prudent visier did not by his obvious interference deprive him of the reputation which he strove to maintain On the same day that Sadulla was promoted to the government of Behâr the prince Morâd was raised to that of the Decan The emperor though fond of his son distrusted his natural impetuosity and fire he therefore committed the charge of the army on the frontiers to Shaw Nawâz the fatherinlaw of Morâd himself Without the consent of this lord Morâd was not to attempt any thing of material concern to the empire  Persians take Candahâr  Though the Imperial ambassador who had been sent to congratulate Shaw Abâs the Second on his accession to the throne had been well received at Ispahan the court of Persia had not relinquished their pretensions to the city of Candahâr The arrangements necessary to restore the kingdom to order after the tyranny of Shaw Sesi had hitherto engaged their attention and the numerous armies employed by Shaw Jehân on his northern frontiers against the Usbecs rendered it imprudent to break with him till they were withdrawn After the pacisication with the prince of Balich the greater part of the Imperial army had been removed to the south and a fair field was left for th designs of Shaw Abas That monarch accordingly in the year marched with a great force toward Candahâr but the news  of his preparations for the expedition had been previously carried to Lahore Shaw Jehân who had arrived in that city toward the close of the year detached fifty thousand of his troops under the visier to cover Candahâr The prince Aurungzêbe joined that minister with the forces stationed in his province of Moultân but before they arrived the city was surrendered to the Persians by capitulation Shaw Abas left ten thousand musqueteers to garrison the place and retreated with the rest of his army  Aurungzêbe besieges it in vain  Aurungzêbe and Sadulla invested the place in the March of The siege continued more than three months before a practicable breach was made and the Imperialists in a general assault were repulsed with great loss The prince however did not raise the siege he continued his approaches but he made very little progress toward taking of the place Winter was now approaching and the weather began to be already very severe in that high country There was a great scarcity of forage and provisions and the warlike stores were exhausted The emperor being apprized of the state of his army ordered the siege to be raised and Aurungzêbe without laurels returned toward Lahore  Defeats the Persiants  Nizier Ali the Persian governor of Candahâr and Murtizi who commanded an army of observation on the frontiers of that province having joined their forces fell on the rear of the Imperialists in their retreat Aurungzêbe behaved upon the occasion with his usual spirit and conduct He fell upon the assailants in the flank with a column of cavalry which he had filed off from his front when he first observed the enemy The Persians were repulsed with considerable slaughter Though defeated they were not however intimidated Being reinforced from Candahâr they hovered round the Imperial army and after a few days formed  their line and offered battle Aurungzêbe did not decline to come to action The shock was from wing to wing and the contest was long and bloody The prince owed the victory which he obtained to the bravery of Rustum one of his generals who commanded the reserve consisting of two thousand horse Rustum when the prince was on the point of quitting the field fell on the the enemy sword in hand and threw them into confusion Aurungzêbe in the mean time restored his ranks and returned to the charge The Persians fled and were pursued twenty miles beyond the field and the prince returned with unexpected glory to the emperor who set out soon after the arrival of his son for Agra  Usbecs apply for aid  The Usbec Tartars beyond the Oxus taking advantage of the debilitated state of Nidder Mahommed who had not recovered from the blow given to his power by the conquest of his country by the Imperialists invaded the dominions of that prince Mahommed applied in the character of a vassal to the emperor who was so well pleased with this mark of his submission that he sent him a very considerable sum of money which was the principal thing wanted The escort sent with the treasure to Balich conveyed his women and children to Mahommed but two of his sons Chusero and Byram who had been created nobles of the empire remained from choice in India Many marks of the emperor's favour were conferred on the family of Mahommed An honorary dress was given to each together with a considerable sum of money Nor had their education been neglected Masters had been appointed to teach the young princes and the daughters were instructed in the suitable accomplishments of their sex  Morâd removed from the Decan  The prince Morâd as before related had been sent under the tuition of his fatherinlaw into the Decan Proud haughty and full of fire he could not bear with patience the controul of that lord He possessed abilities and he knew it and he considered it as an insupportable hardship to have the name without the power of government He upon many occasions neglected the counsel given him by Shaw Nawâz but at last he added insult to contempt  "Know you not" said he one day to his fatherinlaw "that even you who attempt to command me are by the Imperial commission subject to my government Behave yourself therefore as the humble adviser not as the proud dictator of my measures"  Shaw Nawâz was enraged at this disrespect and he wrote letters of complaint to the emperor who without further examination removed his son from the government of the Decan He however conferred upon him that of Cabul and removed Ali Murdan to the government of Cashmire  Aurungzêbe besieges  Morâd impatient in every station did not long keep the government of Cabul Aurungzêbe by the command of the emperor made preparations for recommencing the siege of Candahâr Morâd instead of assisting him with the troops stationed in his own province threw every obstacle in his way and pretended that the necessary service required all the troops under his command To Aurungzêbe's commission for taking his choice of all the troops in the northern provinces his brother opposed his own commission for the absolute command of the forces in Cabul Aurungzêbe wrote to the emperor and Morâd was ordered into the province of Malava Upon his removal his brother collected an army The visier joined him with fifty thousand horse from the south escorting five hundred camels loaded with treasure to pay the army five hundred with arms and two  thousand with other warlike stores The retaking of Candahâr engrossed so much of the emperor's attention that he himself made a progress to Cabul to support the besiegers ChannaZâd the son of Asiph Jâh was upon this occasion raised to the office of paymastergeneral of the forces Prince Suja came from his government of Bengal to pay his respects to his father soon after his arrival at Cabul  Candahâr in vain  The preparations for the siege of Candahâr took up a considerable time Aurungzêbe did not appear before it till the month of January He invested the place on all sides and began to make his approaches in form But his gunners were bad and his engineers if possible worse The siege continued two months and eight days without any impression being made on the city All the warlike stores were at length exhausted the army was discouraged from seeing no end to their toil The prince was ashamed and the positive orders of his father recalled him to Cabul Shaw Jehân after all his expence and idle parade returned without having effected any thing material to Agra In that city his first business was to promote his children and nobles to honours and governments Solimân the son of Dara was raised to the dignity of eight thousand horse and sent to the government of Cabul Aurungzêbe was ordered back to the Decan Dara who held Guzerât by deputy was removed to Moultân Suja returned to Bengal and Shaista Chan one of the sons of the late visier was promoted to the government of Guzerât in the room of

at court  Dara's jealousy of Aurungzebe  THOUGH Shaw Jehân by his great attention upon every occasion to Dara had convinced his subjects of his design to appoint him his successor in the throne that prince was jealous of the growing reputation of Aurungzêbe The latter in his frequent expeditions at the head of armies found various opportunities of gaining friends by the places of honour and profit which he had by his commission to bestow and he was not of a disposition to relinquish by negligence the influence which he had acquired by favours Cool subtle and selfdenied he covered his actions with such an appearance of honest sincerity that men imputed his attention to their own merit and not to his designs The penetrating eye of his father had pierced the veil which he had thrown over his ambition but the implicit obedience which Aurungzêbe paid to all his commands flattered him into a kind of oblivion of his former observations on the duplicity of his character Dara had carried his jealousy of Aurungzêbe into a kind of aversion to his person He envied him when successful  and he triumphed over his misfortunes but his exultation was as secret as his hatred as both proceeded from fear a passion which his soul disdained to own  His unsuccessful expedition against Candahâr  Aurungzêbe having twice miscarried in his attempts on Candahâr Dara wished to gather laurels where his rival had failed He applied to his father for an army insinuating that the bad success which attended his brother proceeded from his want of knowledge and conduct A very large sum was issued from the Imperial treasury and the army and artillery in the provinces beyond the Indus were submitted to the command of Dara That prince invested Candahâr The siege continued five months without any impression being made The stores were at last exhausted the troops were dispirited and Dara found himself under the necessity of retreating with loss of repuputation Shaw Jehân was silent upon the occasion and even Aurungzêbe who triumphed in secret over Dara's disappointment attributed in his conversation this fresh miscarriage to the strength of the place more than to his brother's want of abilities in war  He is solemnly appointed successor to the emperor  The unsuccessful expedition to Candahâr did not shake the emperor's design in favour of Dara He foresaw the tumult and disorder which were likely to arise from the ambition of his younger sons after his death and he resolved to habituate them in his lifetime to the authority of their elder brother Having ordered all the nobles to attend the presence he descended from his throne took Dara by the hand and placed him under the Imperial conopy commanding the lord of the requests to read aloud an edict changing the name of Dara into that of Shaw Belind Akbal or THE EMPEROR OF EXALTED FORTUNE  "Behold" said Shaw Jehân "your future prince Upon him  we leave the support of the reputation and honour of the family of Timur"  Nor was this merely a ceremony He devolved on Dara a part of the Imperial power and made an allowance of more than two millions ayear for the expences of his household  A Turkish embassy  Soon after this solemn appointment of Dara to the succession Shaw Jehân made a progress of pleasure to the city of Ajmere During his residence in that place Zulsikar Aga the Turkish ambassador arrived from Bussora at Surat He was received with the usual honours and escorted by a party of the Imperial cavalry to court The presents which he brought to the emperor were rather curious and rare than valuable He was treated with the highest distinction a table was kept for him at the public expence and he was gratified with a considerable present in money for his own private use He remained for some months in Hindostan and Caim Beg an Omrah of distinction returned with him to Constantinople on the part of the emperor  Marâja rebels and is reduced  The Marâja who owed his throne to an Imperial decision against his elder brother the unfortunate Amar Singh forgot about this time the gratitude which he owed to Shaw Jehân He stopt the payment of the stipulated tribute and began to fortify the strong city of Chitôr The emperor detached thirty thousand horse under Sadulla the visier to chastise him for his insolence and to demolish the works The Hindoo prince hung out the flag of desiance and the visier invested Chitôr Parties were at the same time detached on all sides to lay waste the open country The refractory prince had not the spirit necessary to support his rebellion He sent on the eleventh day to Sadulla a most submissive overture of peace The minister referred him to the emperor who still remained at Ajmere but that monarch would  not receive the letters Orders were sent to prosecute the siege with vigour and to give no terms The Maraja in this extremity found means to convey a present to Dara That prince softened his father's resentment and the Maraja upon paying the expence of the war was reinstated in his hereditary dominions  Rise and character of Jumla  The most memorable transaction of the year was the promotion of Mahommed Jumla to the rank of five thousand horse He was recommended to the emperor by the prince Aurungzêbe and as he is to make a great figure in the sequel of the history there is a propriety in premising something concerning his origin and gradual rise Jumla was a Persian born in Ardistan a village in the neighbourhood of Ispahan His parents though of some rank were extremely poor he however found means to acquire some knowledge of letters which circumstance procured for him the place of clerk to a diamond merchant who made frequent journies to Golconda In that kingdom he quitted his master's service traded on his own account and acquired a considerable fortune which enabled him to purchase a place at the court of Cuttub sovereign of Tellingana In that station he behaved so well that he attracted the notice of his prince who raised him to a considerable rank in the army His military promotion opened a field for the abilities of Jumla He yielded to few in conduct in courage to none He rose by his merit to the head of the forces of Tellingana He led the army into the Carnatic and in a war which continued six years reduced that country to subjection But when he conquered for his sovereign he acquired wealth for himself Cuttub wishing to share with his general in the spoil disobliged him and he attached himself to the fortunes of Aurungzêbe who then commanded for his father in the conquered provinces of the Decan The prince who was an excellent judge of character saw something extraordinary in Jumla  He found him upon trial a fit instrument for his ambition and he exerted all his influence at court in his favour  Promotions  Soon after the promotion of Jumla the eldest son of the prince Suja was sent by his father from Bengal to pay his respects to the emperor Shaw Jehân naturally fond of his posterity was struck with the accomplishments of his grandson and raised him to the rank of seven thousand horse To avoid giving umbrage to Dara always jealous of distinctions bestowed on his brothers Cipper Shekô the second son of that prince was promoted to the same rank of nobility A magnificent festival was given on the occasion at which the dependants of the two dignified princes assisted Though jealousy prevailed in private between the posterity of Shaw Jehân in public there was nothing but harmony and affection Dara who with the state of an emperor possessed also a part of the power treated the son of Suja with distinction and respect His fears of the ambition of Aurungzêbe absorbed all his suspicions concerning the designs of his other brothers Suja who was a man of pleasure was not so formidable as the hypocritical austerity of Aurungzêbe and the open valour of Morâd without the necessary balance of prudence was not an object of serious terror  Death and character of the  isier  On the twentieth of February the visier died after a short illness He was fortyseven years of age at the time of his decease His assiduity and ability in business recommended him in an uncommon degree to the emperor's affections and the bier of the minister was bathed with the tears of his prince His parts were rather solid than shining industry and indefatigable perseverance made up for the defects of his genius Experience rendered him master of the detail of finance and he was by habit conversant in the inferior intrigues which are the  springs of actions of moment His mind was too much circumscribed in its powers to comprehend at one view the great line of public affairs but he could execute with precision what he could not plan with judgment He was fond of military fame but he was unsuccessful in the field though neither deficient in conduct nor distitute of courage Superstition which was none of the follies of the age was the greatest defect in his character and his sanctity was said to be frequently a cloke for dishonourable deeds  War in Golconda  The influence of Jumla with Aurungzêbe was the source of a new war in the Decan though another cause was assigned to reconcile the emperor to the measure Cuttub Shaw sovereign of Tellingana and of a great part of Golconds had upon the desertion of Jumla imprisoned the son of that lord and seized upon his wealth Aurungzêbe complained in repeated letters of Cuttub to his father alleging that he was dilatory in the payment of his annual tribute to the empire He therefore applied for leave to bring the refractory prince to reason by force The emperor jealous of his authority gave permission for the march of an army into the dominions of Cuttub Mahommed the eldest son of Aurungzêbe commanded in this expedition a brave an obstinate and a haughty prince not to be swayed from his purpose either by argument or fear  Mahommed the son of Aurungzêbe  Mahommed at the head of twenty thousand horse entered suddenly the dominions of Cuttub and that prince expecting nothing less than hostilities was totally unprepared for war He sent messengers to the camp of the Imperialists and paid down the arrears of the tribute He at the same time released Amîn the son of Jumla and endeavoured to sooth Mahommed with rich presents This however was not the sole object of the expedition  of the Imperialists The fortune of Jumla was still in the hands of Cuttub A just restitution was demanded and the latter in vain objected that the accounts between him and Jumla were not settled and therefore that till they were adjusted he could form no judgment of the sum which ought to be paid Mahommed continued obstinate and advanced to the gates of Hydrabad When things appeared ready to come to extremities a few chests of money and some caskets of jewels were delivered by Cuttub as the whole wealth of Jumla Amîn made greater claims in the name of his father and the prince offended at the prevarications of Cuttub ordered him to come out of the city to do him homage as the grandson of his emperor and lord  takes Hydrabad  The pride of Cuttub was still greater than his avarice His mind revolted against the very idea of homage and his rage overcame his prudence Mahommed entered Hydrabâd Death and confusion filled every street and the city was submitted to the ravages of fire and sword The spoils was great but the destruction was immense The avarice of the Imperialists was defeated by their fury The flames moved quicker than depredation so that except silver gold and jewels which neither the rage of men nor of fire could destroy nothing of value remained to the conquerors  and deseats the king of Golconda  Cuttub from this scene of slaughter tumult and ruin fled to the old city of Golconda which stood about six miles from Hydrabâd A number of his troops and many of the citizens followed their sovereign Mahommed immediately invested Golconda Cuttub in his distress resolved to try the fortune of the field He accordingly marched out with six thousand horse twelve thousand foot and a great rabble of halfarmed men to  give battle to the Imperialists The affair was soon decided Cuttub was defeated and the enemy entered the city at his heels The horrors of war were renewed in every form Mahommed waded through blood Cuttub threw himself at his feet but he was not to be appeased by submission The unfortunate prince at length produced his beautiful daughter Rizia to the victor and he sheathed his sword He married her in form and a magnificent festival was held to celebrate the nuptials Mirth was mixed with sorrow and pageants of joy with the solemn funerals of the dead  Returns to Brampour  Mahommed after finishing with more good fortune than reputation the war with Cuttub returned to his father who resided at Brampour Aurungzêbe wrote a pompous account of the success of his son to the emperor and that monarch raised him to the rank of eleven thousand horse Shaista the son of the late visier Asiph was second in command in the expedition against Hydrabâd and he as a reward for his services was dignified with the honours of six thousand horse Jumla who had hitherto remained with Aurungzêbe at Brampour charged himself with the letters of that prince to his father His son Amîn attended him to court and both were received with distinguished marks of kindness and esteem His knowledge and abilities recommended Jumla in a high degree The place of visier was vacant by the death of Sadulla and notwithstanding the remonstrances of Dara who was averse to Jumla on account of his attachment to Aurungzêbe that lord was invested with the highest office in the empire The avarice of the emperor joined issue in this promotion with the merit of Jumla When he received the seals the presents which he made amounted to more than sixty thousand pounds of our money  War with Adil Shaw  The emperor soon after the promotion of Jumla took a tour of pleasure toward the north Having hunted for some time in the forests on the banks of the Ganges he returned to Agra and upon his arrival received intelligence of the death of Adil king of Bijapour The principal officers at the court of Adil without asking permission of the emperor raised the son of the deceased to the throne This conduct was highly resented by Shaw Jehân who considered the dominions of Bijapour as an appendage of the empire The expedient upon which he fell was in some measure the source of his misfortunes The new visier was ordered with twenty thousand horse into Bijapour to depose the son of Adil till he should make his submissions in the Imperial presence Amîn who was his father's deputy in his high office remained at court to carry on the business of that department  Death and character of Ali Murdan  In the month of November of the year died Ali Murdan the nominal captaingeneral of the Imperial forces on his return from Agra to his province of Cashmire His defection from his sovereign the emperor of Persia and his delivering up the important fortress of Candahâr had highly recommended him to Shae Jehân and he had abilities to keep the favour which he had once acquired The designs of Shaw Sefi against his life were a sufficient apology for his revolt from that prince and the fidelity with which he served his benefactor is a proof that necessity was the sole cause of his treachery He was rather a dignified than a great character more sit for the fatigues of the sield than for the intrigues of the closet He was a faithful servant to his prince a constant and unshaken friend an active and a gallant officer A love of money which did not amount to absolute avarice was the greatest defect of his mind but were we to judge from the number of his dependants he was possessed of a generous disposition Being always absent from court in  the government of various provinces he had no opportunity for expending his vast income and he therefore amassed great wealth The emperor became the heir of his fortune which in money and jewels amounted to one million eight hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds  Expedition into Bijapour  Intelligence of the march of Jumla flew before him to the kingdom of Bijapour Ali the visier of the deceased Adil who had raised the son of that prince to the throne had foreseen the strom which was now gathering over his head He levied forces he fortified his dismantled castles and towns Jumla in the mean time advanced to Brampour Aurungzêbe joined him with his forces and with his usual affected humility pretended to submit himself to the command of his father's visier That minister however was too much attached to the interests of the prince to avail himself of his modesty and though Jumla bore the name of commander in chief the orders of Aurungzêbe were only issued and obeyed The greatest harmony subsisted between them for they reckoned this present expedition as a fortunate prelude to their future designs  Siege of Bider  The rapid march of the Imperialists disconcerted the measures of Ali He had collected an army but it was too small and the troops too raw to risque the fortune of the field He threw a numerous garrison into Bider which is one of the strongest places in Hindostan With a body of cavalry he himself harassed the enemy leaving the command at Bider to Jân Jissi who had been thirty years governor of that important fortress Aurungzêbe arriving before Bider reconnoitred it with great attention and care He foresaw the difficulty which would attend a siege and he endeavoured by bribes and large promises to corrupt the fidelity of Jissi That old officer rejected his proposals with indignation  and disdain and the prince despairing of success by intrigue prepared to ensure it by force he accordingly made his approaches to Bider  That city taken  On the twentyseventh day of the siege a mine being sprung a practicable breach was made in the first wall Aurungzêbe wishing to make a lodgment within the wall ordered an assault It happened that one of the principal magazines of the place was under a great bastion in the second wall opposite to the breach The besieged having expended all their granadoes and ammunition in repelling the attack this magazine was thrown open that they might supply themselves with more A rocket by accident fell near the door of the magazine upon some powder that had been scattered there in the confusion It took fire and communicating with the magazine blew up the bastion which was covered with people and destroyed the greatest part of the garrison who had been drawn together into that place to oppose the enemy The governor and his three sons were numbered among the dead The assailants in the mean time suffered considerably from the explosion The whole place was exposed The Imperialists took advantage of the consternation of the surviving part of the enemy A thick darkness occasioned by the smoke and dust covered Bider Aurungzêbe rushed over the ruins and when light began to appear he found himself in the midst of the citadel Though there was no resistance death ravaged all around him for even his authority could not appease for some time the rage of the troops  Adil Shaw defeated  Ali who had looked on Bider as impregnable had deposited in that city the greatest part of his young sovereign's wealth and Aurungzêbe acquired an immense treasure as well as an unexpected reputation from the capture of the place The minister  though struck with the loss of his strongest fortress did not give all his hopes away He collected a numerous army of Abyssinian mercenaries under the walls of Kilburga and placed the prince at their head Aurungzêbe despised the enemy too much to march against him in person He detached twenty thousand horse under the command of Mohâbet toward Kilburga whilst he himself sat down before Kallian which after a siege of a few weeks fell into his hands Mohâbet in the mean time came to battle with Ali and defeated his mercenary army with great slaughter Aurungzêbe himself arrived in the camp soon after the battle and invested Kilburga where the fugitives had taken refuge  and submits  Kilburga was large and well fortified The garrison was numerous and made frequent sallies They at length issued forth with their whole force came to battle and were driven back into into the city with great slaughter These repeated efforts weakened those within but one of the generals of young Adil who commanded a body of horse was very active in harassing from without the Imperial army He cut off their convoys and a scarcity prevailed in their camp Aurungzêbe however was not to be driven from his designs He carried on the siege with unabating diligence and having made a practicable breach in the walls he took Kilburga by assault on the eleventh of June Adil led by his minister Ali threw himself at the feet of the conqueror The tribute of Bijapour was fixed at one million eight hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds and a great sum toward defraying the expence of the war was paid down by Adil He at the same time was obliged to give up his strongest forts and to settle estates upon some of the adherents of Aurungzêbe That prince having changed the name of the city of Bider to that  of Zifferabad or the City of Victory returned in triumph to Brampour the seat of his government  Plans concerted between the visier and Aurungzebe  Jumla the visier of the empire remained in the army during the war against Bijapour After the taking of Bider the name of Aurungzêbe appeared first in the commission for commanding the army The attachment and gratitude of Jumla to that prince induced him to request the emperor to confer upon him the honour as well as the power in the expedition The measure besides was favourable to their concerted plans of ambition Shaw Jehân was now become aged and his excesses in venery had weakened his constitution The scene of ambition was not distant and Aurungzêbe who had opened his whole soul to Jumla had concerted all his future measures with that lord Orders in the mean time arrived for the visier to return to court Having sworn fidelity and secrecy to one another the prince and the minister parted at the gates of Brampour  Emperor falls  ck  On the seventeenth of September Shaw Jehân was suddenly seized in the city of Delhi with a paralytic disorder accompanied with a violent strangury He remained in a state of insensibility for several days and all hopes of his recovery vanished But by the copious bleeding prescribed by his physicians he was at length relieved His disorder however returned though not with the same violence and on the occasion the customary edict for the remission of the taxes due for the year when the life of the emperor is in danger was issued with the usual formalities Large sums were at the same time given to the poor and to Fakiers of reputed sanctity for their prayers to Heaven for the recovery of Shaw Jehân The mosques were filled with the devout and the people in general expressed unfeigned  grief at the danger of a monarch under whose auspicious reign they had enjoyed protection and happiness All business was suspended in Delhi Silence prevailed over the whole place except when that silence was broken by anxious enquiries concerning the emperor's health Shaw Jehân was a stranger to the interest which he possessed in the hearts of his subjects till he fell into a disease which was thought mortal by all  Dara assumes the government  The emperor being by his disorder rendered incapable of giving any attention to business the management of public affairs fell into the hands of Dara His father had prepared for an accident which might occasion a suspension of government An edict had some time before been issued bearing that the signet of Dara should be considered as equally valid with that of the emperor through all the dominions of the house of Timur The prince however till Shaw Jehân fell ill made no use of this extraordinary power When his father became insensible Dara mounted the throne Warm vehement and precipitate he acted the sovereign with too much violence He issued out a public order that no person whatever should presume under pain of death to hold any correspondence with his brothers upon the present posture of affairs The agents of Aurungzêbe and Morâd at court were seized with their papers and imprisoned The money in their hands on account of the princes was locked up and in short the whole conduct of Dara betrayed the most violent suspicions of the designs of his brothers  His violence  The suspension of the visier was among Dara's first acts of power He suspected his sidelity as being raised to his office by the influence of Aurungzêbe An Indian prince by the title of Rai Raiân was made temporary visier for the commissions given by Dara were limited expressly to the time of the emperor's  illness The prince in the mean time ordered all the nobles into the hall of presence He explained to them with unfeigned tears the hopeless condition of the emperor He hinted the ambition of his brothers and the dangers which would arise to the empire from a civil war  "The emperor" said he "more from an idea of justice than from any superior affection to me has appointed me his successor in the throne and I find in my own mind no inclination to relinquish what Heaven and my father have thrown into my hands Those therefore who will show the earliest zeal in my support shall command my gratitude Be explicit and open as I always am and resolve to continue faithful Such of you as owe favours to my brothers will not serve me with zeal Let them therefore in their prudence retire to their houses I want not their pretended support and I will not bear with their intrigues in favour of others"  The wishes of the prince were commands The lords who had estates in Bengal in Guzerat and in the Decan the governments of Suja Morâd and Aurungzêbe to avoid suspicion confined themselves at home  Emperor carried to Agra  On the eighteenth of October the emperor being much recovered of his disorder was placed by his son in a barge which was ordered gradually to fall down the Jumna to Agra The army and court moved along the banks of the river with slow marches under the command of Dara who though he passed the most of his time with his father spent the night always ashore Several arrangements were made in the greater offices during this progress Chilulla was sent back to the government of Delhi and Danismund was turned out of his office of paymastergeneral of the Imperial forces Amîn the son of Jumla had found means to recommend himself to Dara and notwithstanding that prince's aversion to his father the son was raised to the vacant office of Danismund  Recovers  The tour from Delhi was recommended to the emperor for the reestablishment of his health and he gradually recovered on the way On the th of November he arrived at a palace in the country near Agra and he continued daily to mend till the th of February on which day he entered Agra in perfect health The populace who had exhibited their affection in silent sorrow during his illness crowded round him with tumultuous joy His heart was opened at the shouts of his people and he ordered considerable sums to be distributed among the poorer fort The first thing he did after his arrival in the Imperial palace was to enquire for Jumla the late visier He was however told that during his illness that lord had applied to him for leave to proceed to the Decan and that the leave had been granted He sent for Dara The prince appeared before him and was severely reprimanded for dismissing so able a man from an office which demanded abilities  "But Jumla" said he "must be disgraced since you will have it so Dara is to be my successor in the throne and the authority of the heir of the empire must not be diminished by the restoration of men whom he has dismissed in his displeasure"  Favour for Dara  Dara had bestowed great attention and care on his father during his illness He sat often for whole nights by his side and watched the very motion of his eye to supply him in all his wants When the emperor was at the point of death the prince dropt unfeigned tears and he could not suppress his joy when the first dawn of his father's recovery appeared But if Dara's silial piety was great the emperor's gratitude was not less He exhibited to his son unbounded testimonies of his affection and regard He raised him to the honours of sixty thousand horse and in one day gave him jewels to the value of one hundred thousand pounds twelve hundred thousand in specie and an order upon certain  revenues to the amount of three millions more Three hundred Arabian horses with rich furnitures and a number of elephants were at the same time bestowed on the prince by the lavish hand of his father  "He who prefers the life of an aged parent" said Shaw Jehân "to the throne of India can never be sufficiently paid for his filial piety"  who carries all before him at court  Though Dara laid down the name of authority at the recovery of his father his influence was equal to actual power Solimân Shekô his eldest son was appointed to the command of ten thousand horse to suppress some disturbances in the province of Allahabâd his second son Cipper Shekô was raised to the government of Behâr and Bahadur was sent as the deputy of the prince to manage the affairs of the province The Rana Jesswint Singh who adhered to the interest of Dara was raised to a higher degree of nobility All means were used to attach the affections of the grandees to the heirapparent Jaffier Chan known long for his abilities was placed in the high office of visier Mohâbet was sent to the government of Cabul on account of his hatred to Aurungzêbe and the Rana who had been saved from destruction at the intercession of Dara was gratified with the rich and extensive province of Malava  CHAP VI  Cause of the civil warCharacter of the Emperor's sonsDaraSujaAurungzêbeMorâdSuja takes the fieldDefeated by Solimân the son of

wars  SHAW Jehân after a reign of thirty years of prosperity found himself suddenly involved in trouble and misfortune The storm had been long gathering it was foreseen but nothing could prevent it from falling The emperor with abilities for business was addicted to pleasure and though he was decisive in the present moment he was improvident of the future His affection for his sons was the source of the calamities which shook his empire Pleased with their promising parts when young he furnished them with opportunities for exerting their talents in the cabinet as well as in the field and when they became by their own merit objects of public attention it was dangerous if not impracticable to reduce them into private stations The unsettled system of succession to the crown had rouzed their ambition and awakened their fears They were to each other objects of terror as well as of envy They all looked forward with anxiety to the death of their father and each saw in that  gloomy point either a throne or a grave Their hopes and fears increased with their growing age They had provided themselves against the important event of his demise and when he was seized with what was deemed a mortal disease they broke forth at once from that silent respect which their reverence for the person and authority of a parent had hitherto imposed on their minds  Views of the emperor's sons  The means of ambition which their respective ranks in the empire had placed in the hands of each of the sons of Shaw Jehân were great but their boldness to carry their schemes into execution was greater still Highspirited and intrepid they wished for no object which their natural courage durst not attempt to obtain they were born for enterprize and though beyond measure ambitious they loved danger more than power Each was possessed of armies and of treasures and being rivals in fame as well as in influence they lost all affection for one another in the more violent passions of the mind Dara vested with his claim of primogeniture as well as with his father's declaration in favour of his succession construed the ambition of his brothers into rebellion Suja in possession of Bengal was carried by his pride to the resolution of seizing the whole empire Aurungzêbe covered his ambition with motives of religion and the vehement Moràd arrogated all to himself by his courage The figure which the brothers are to make in the succeeding sccnes seems to demand a delincation of their respective characters  Character of Dara  Dara the eldest son of Shaw Jehân was polite in his conversation affable open and free He was easy of access acute in observation learned witty and graceful in all his actions He pryed not into the secrets of others and he had no secret himself  but what he disdained to hide He came fairly upon mankind he concealed nothing from them and he expected that faith which he freely gave Active lively and full of fire he was personally brave and he forgot misfortune in the vehemence of his mind which neglecting past evils looked forward to future good Though elevated with success he never was dejected by bad fortune and though no believer in a particular providence he met with all the incidents of life as if they had been immoveably determined by Fate In his public character he was sometimes morose frequently haughty always obstinate and full of pride Selfsufficient in his opinions he scarce could hear advice with patience and all he required of his friends was implicit obedience to his commands But with this appearance of illnature he was in his disposition humane and kind for though he was often passionate his rage was not destructive and it passed suddenly away without leaving a trace of malice behind In his private character Dara was in every respect unexceptionable He was an indulgent parent a faithful husband a dutiful son When he returned at night to his family the darkness which had covered his brow throughout the day was dispelled his countenance was lightened up with joy and his whole conversation displayed a peculiar serenity and benevolence of disposition Though no enemy from principle to pleasure he was naturally virtuous and he filled up his leisure time with study instead of those enervating indulgences which render the princes of the East effeminate  Of Suja  Suja was humane in his disposition averse to cruelty an enemy to oppression In the execution of justice he had no respect of persons but when the natural tenderness of his disposition gave his mind a bias toward the unfortunate Though honest like his brother Dara he was not so open and free He never told a  falsehood but he did not always tell the whole of the truth He was more tranquil more close and reserved than Dara and he was more fitted for the intrigues of party and that management which is necessary to direct the various passions of men to one point He was generous to his friends he did not disdain to hear their advice though he for the most part followed his own judgment of things He was fond of pomp and magnificence and much addicted to the pleasures of the haram Graceful and active in his own person he loved in women that complete symmetry of limbs which rendered himself the favourite of the sex and he spared no expence in filling his seraglio with ladies remarkable for their beauty and accomplishments In their society he spent too much of his time but the warmth of his constitution did not make him neglect the necessary affairs of life During his long government of Bengal he won the affections of the people by the softness of his manners and his exact and rigorous execution of justice and the country flourished in commerce and agriculture under the protection which he invariably gave to industry In battle he was brave nor was he destitute of the talents necessary for a general and we much attribute his misfortunes in the field to the effeminacy of his troops more than to his own want of conduct  Of Aurungzêbe  The character of Aurungzêbe differed in every respect from those of his elder brothers Destitute of that graceful appearance of person which rendered them popular as soon as seen he acquired by address that influence over mankind which nature had on them bestowed In disposition serious and melancholy he established an opinion of the solidity of his understanding even among those who had no opportunity of being acquainted with his great talents Pliant and accommodating in his manner he gained mankind by flattering their pride and he wrapt  up his behaviour in such plausibility that they attributed his attention to their own merit more than to his designs His common conversation turned always on trifles In affairs of moment he was reserved crafty and full of dissimulation Religion the great engine of political impostors he professed in all its severity With it he deceived the weak and awed into a kind of reverence for his person the greatest enemies of his power Though not remarkable for humanity he did not naturally delight in blood but ambition was his darling passion and before it vanished all the softer feelings of the soul Fear which renders other tyrants cruel had no place in his breast but that provident caution which wishes to shut up every access to danger made him careless about the lives of his rivals He had a particular talent for kindling dissentions among those who opposed his designs and his art and cunning were more destructive to his enemies than his sword  Of Morâd  Morâd the youngest son of Shaw Jehân was by constitution lively and full of fire With too much levity for business he gave up his time to mirth action and amusement He delighted in the chace he was more fond of battle than of war In riding in bending the bow in throwing the lance he met with few that could equal him in the armies which he commanded and he was more desirous of carrying the palm in the manly exercises of the field than in the intrigues of the cabinet He despised all cabals he gloried in keeping nothing secret He thought it beneath his dignity to command mankind by art and he openly professed that he disdained to owe distinction to any thing but the sword  "To possess a throne by the will of a parent to owe it to birth" said Morâd "is unworthy of a great prince and had not my brother supported his pretensions to the crown by arms I would disdain to wear it"  In battle his soul  was a stranger to fear he was even an enthusiast in his love of danger and slaughter was his favourite pastime In peace he was mild though proud liberal affable and humane But his very virtues were weakness and his fate furnishes a melancholy proof that an open generosity of spirit is never a match for hypocrisy and deceit His splendid qualities however rendered him popular in the army and Aurungzêbe notwithstanding his superiority of parts owed at last his success over Morâd as much atleast to accident as to his known talents Such were the illustrious competitors for the throne of their father  Suja takes the field  Suja who had possessed the government of Bengal for many years was the first who appeared in the field upon receiving intelligence of the dangerous illness of Shaw Jehân He excused his measures by the violence of Dara He was informed that he had nothing to expect from his brother should he possess the throne but imprisonment or even death and he affirmed that necessity had rendered rebellion lawful The resources which Suja possessed promised success to his enterprise He had accumulated treasure and levied an army and though his agent at court transmitted to him accounts of his father's recovery he affected not to credit the intelligence When he pitched his tent in the field he issued out a manifesto which bore that Shaw Jehân was dead and that there were violent suspicions of Dara's being accessary to his death Though he received letters from the hands of his father announcing his recovery he alledged that they were a forgery by Dara to amuse him and to divert him from his intentions of revenging the death of the emperor on the parricide The enemies of Dara contributed by their letters to make Suja persist in his resolution  Opposed by Solimân Shekô  Dara had the earliest intelligence of the designs of his brother and he made the necessary preparations against him His son Solimân had marched with ten thousand horse to quell some disturbances in the province of Allahabâd Dara ordered a reinforcement to fall down the Jumna and to join Solimân Raja Joy Singh and Debere Chan commanded the detachment and they had positive instructions after joining the prince to stop the progress of Suja to the capital with the sword The emperor however repented of orders procured from him by the violence of Dara He was averse to a civil war and he sent secret directions to Joy Singh to endeavour to induce Suja to return to his government of Bengal These directions were scarce dispatched to the Raja when advices arrived at court that the prince Morâd who commanded in the kingdom of Guzerat was proclaimed emperor by the army that the receivergeneral of the Imperial revenues in opposing the usurpation had been slain in battle and that Morâd having negociated a considerable loan with the bankers of Ahmedabâd had coined money in his own name  Suja surprized in his camp  The intelligence of this second rebellion hastened Suja in his measures He wished to be the first of the competitors who should arrive at the capital and he therefore moved his camp to Benâris When he was busy in constructing a bridge of boats for crossing the Ganges Solimân appeared in sight on the opposite shore with his army A negociation was set on foot with Suja by Joy Singh and it was at last agreed that the prince should return to his government and disband his army The active spirit of Solimân did not relish this precarious pacification Joy Singh without his participation had settled the terms with Suja and he did not think himself bound by a truce in which he had no hand He changed his ground and moved a  few miles up the Ganges The river by an extraordinary drought was remarkably low Solimân to the astonishment of every body discovered a ford by which the cavalry could pass The circumstance was too favourable to the inclinations of the prince not to be turned to immediate advantage In the night he forded the river and when daylight appeared fell suddenly on Suja's camp  and defeated  Suja who considered the Ganges as an insuperable barrier permitted himself to be completely surprized The shouts of the army the clashing of swords first rouzed him from sleep He started from his bed seized his arms rushed forth and mounted his horse When he looked round him he beheld nothing but confusion and terror and slaughter and flight His voice was not heard in the tumult and if heard it was not obeyed The crowd around him was great but his army was too much agitated by fear to be reduced to any form As no man could trust to another each endeavoured to provide for his own safety by flight The slaughter of those who stood retarded the enemy in their pursuit of the fugitives Suja with some of his officers fought with courage but they were driven into the river and the prince with great difficulty made his escape in a canoe and fell down the stream without stopping tell he reached Mongeer Solimân after his victory marched into Bengal and besieged Suja in the fort of Mongeer But we must turn our attention to another quarter of the empire  Aurungzêbe hears of his  Aurungzêbe as has been already related returned to Brampour after having finished the war in Tellingana He did not continue long in that city He took up his residence in a town in the neighbourhood of Dowlatabâd which he had rebuilt and called after his own name Aurungabad In this place  he received the first news of his father's illness  father's illness  but three months relapsed before he heard any further intelligence from court Dara who was resolved to establish himself firmly on the throne in case of the demise of his father had placed guards on all the ferries and highways at the same time issuing orders to all the officers of the customs and the commanders of districts to stop all letters and travellers These circumstances induced Aurungzêbe to believe that his father was dead and he began to levy forces for his own security In the midst of his preparations letters were received from Morâd who commanded in Guzerat That prince informed Aurungzêbe that Dara had usurped the throne and was taking measures for cutting off his brothers He therefore proposed that they should join in their own defence Aurungzêbe embraced Morâd's proposal with joy He knew his own superior abilities which were more than a match for the open valour of Morâd and he hoped that if by his assistance he could defeat Dara his own way to the throne would be paved A negociation with Morâd was opened and the preparations for war continued  Gains over  Jumla who had been dismissed from the office of visier by Dara arrived in the mean time from Agra in the Decan Shaw Jehân having disapproved of that lord's being turned out of his dipartment endeavoured to gratify him in some other way and had for that purpose given him the command of a considerable body of troops to reduce some places which still held out in the lately conquered provinces Dara who was jealous of Jumla's known attachment to Aurungzêbe kept his family in the capital as the hostages of his faith Jumla pitching his camp in the neighbourhood of Aurungabad was informed of Aurungzêbe's preparations for war He sent him a message informing him that the emperor was recovered and had resumed the reins of government  The prince astonished at the coldness of Jumla sent to demand a conference but that lord fearing the spies of Dara who were dispersed over the camp refused to wait upon a man who was arming against his sovereign  Jumla  Aurungzêbe penetrated into the cause of this cautious conduct He knew that he was attached to his interest and that it was only the fear of Dara's resentment against his family prevented him from joining with alacrity in his own views He therefore had recourse to art Mahommed Mauzim the second son of Aurungzêbe was a great favourite with Jumla That prince was sent to visit him with proper instructions from his father Mauzim who was then about seventeen years of age possessed a part of Aurungzêbe's address He waited upon Jumla in his tent without any previous notice and was received with great kindness and distinction When night was coming on Jumla put the prince in mind of the time and Mauzim told him that having waited upon him without either the permission or knowledge of his father he was afraid of returning without the customary honour of being attended by the person to whom he had paid the visit Jumla who was ashamed of being defective in point of politeness agreed to accompany Mauzim home When they came to the prince's apartment Jumla signified his intention of returning he was however persuaded to enter Mauzim retired and his father appeared He earnestly insisted that Jumla with the army under his command should join in his designs upon the throne That lord excused himself on account of his family who were in the hands of Dara It was at length ageced that the person of Jumla should be seized and an order issued for consiscating all his effects This expedient secured him the resentment of both parties and a door of reconciliation was left open whichever  side should prevail The troops soon after the imprisonment of their general joined the standard of Aurungzêbe  Marches from Aurungabad  On the sixteenth of February Aurungzêbe marched from Aurungabad with twelve thousand horse leaving his second son Mauzim with a sufficient force for the protection of the Decan from whence he intended to derive his supplies for the war Nijabut Chan descended in a direct line from Timur commanded his vanguard and took the rout of Brampour He himself followed with the main body and arrived on the first of March at that place He remained at Brampour near a month for an answer to the dispatches which he had sent to Guzerat to his brother His proposals to that prince were so obviously hypocritical that only the open spirit of Morâd who being full of honesty himself suspected no guile in others could be for a moment deceived He professed in his letters that he had always been his affectionate friend that Dara from his natural weakness was incapable of holding the reins of government besides that he was from principle indifferent about all religion that Suja with abilities little superior to Dara was a heretic and by consequence unworthy of the crown  "As for me" continues Aurungzêbe "I have long since dedicated myself to the service of God I desire only for that safety and tranquillity which suits the fervency of my devotion But I will with my poor abilities affist Morâd to take possession of a scepter which the united wishes of the people of Hindostan have already placed in his hand Morâd may then think of his faithful Aurungzêbe and assign him a quiet retreat for passing the remainder of his life in the austerities of religion"  His management of Morâd  Morâd who with his splendid qualities was selfconceited and vain ascribed Aurungzêbe's moderation to his own superior  merit He wrote back to his brother that he was ready to join him with all his forces and for that purpose was preparing to march from Ahmedabâd On the twentysecond of March Aurungzêbe having received the dispatches of Morâd left the city of Brampour and took the rout of Ugein where the brothers had preconcerted to join their forces Arriving on the banks of the Nirbidda he was informed that the Maraja Jesswint Singh had on the part of Dara taken possession of Ugein with seventy thousand horse He was beyond measure astonished that the enemy had not sent a part of his army to guard the passage of the river which might have stopt his progress He however with his small force durst not cross it and he encamped on the opposite banks in anxious expectation of the arrival of Morâd  Opposed at the Nirbidda  The Maraja instead of attacking Aurungzêbe with a force that promised a certain victory when he had advanced within ten miles of the rebels took possession of a woody hill on the top of which there was an extensive plain In this place he intrenched his army and contented himself with detaching flying squadrons to awe the enemy from crossing the river The conduct of the Maraja who was personally brave proceeded in a great measure from his pride and arrogance He was heard to say That he waited for the junction of the brothers that he might in one day triumph over two Imperial princes Aurungzêbe owed his safety to this unaccountable folly His small army when he arrived on the banks of the Nirbidda was so much fatigued with the march and spent with the excessive heat of the weather that he might be routed by an inconsiderable force  Joined by Mor  d  A few days after Aurungzêbe's arrival at the Nirbidda the van of Morâd's army entered his camp When they were first seen  on a rising ground near the army of Aurungzêbe the enemy struck his tents and advanced toward the banks of the river Aurungzêbe dispatched a messenger to hasten Morâd who was still about fifteen miles distant He himself in the mean time resolved to take the present opportunity to pass the river which by the late extreme drought had become fordable He placed therefore his artillery which was worked by some Frenchmen in his service on a rising ground and entered the river in columns under his own fire The Maraja trusting to the height of the banks and his advancedguard who were already engaged with the enemy contented himself with drawing up his army in order of battle at a distance Aurungzêbe having forced the passage of the river encamped on its bank and the next day he was joined by Morâd who had left his army on their march The brothers after a long conference resolved to attack the enemy by the dawn of the morning whilst orders were sent to the forces of Morâd who were not yet arrived to hold themselves in readiness for action  April defeats the Maraja  The Maraja by his scouts being apprised of the motions of the rebels was ready to receive them He drew up before daylight his army in order of battle to be ready to accommodate his dispositions afterwards to the appearance of the enemy's line He accordingly began the action with the Mogul cavalry but these were soon repulsed by the veteran troops of Aurungzêbe The Maraja who foresaw the discomfiture of the Moguls shewed behind them the front of thirty thousand of his native troops the Rajaputs in whom he chiefly confided Aurungzêbe upon seeing this formidable body drew back from the pursuit and restored his line The Maraja advanced with impetuosity and the prince met him half way The shock was extremely violent and the rebels were on the point of giving way when Morâd with his troops just  arrived on the field attacked the enemy in flank The victory was snatched from the hands of the Rajaputs their prince disdained to fly The wings were broken and ruined but the center animated by the presence of their prince stood its ground Slaughter and danger increased every moment Morâd was irresistible on the right flank and Aurungzêbe who had been on the point of retreating advanced again to the charge The Rajaputs behaved with their usual bravery but they were surrounded on all sides The action became mixed and undistinguished Friends were mistaken for foes and foes for friends Uncertainty would have suspended the sword but fear made it fall every where About the setting of the sun the field covered with ten thousand dead bodies on the side of the enemy was left to Aurungzêbe and Morâd The Maraja after the battle was over drove his chariot by way of bravado quite round the army of the victors and when it was proposed to Aurungzêbe that a party should be detached in pursuit of that prince  "No" he replied "let the wounded boar have time to fly"  Masculine behaviour of the Maraja's wise  The bad success of the Maraja proceeded not more from his own folly than from the address of Aurungzêbe That prince had his emissaries in the Imperial camp who insinuated to the rigid Mahommedans that should the Maraja prevail their religion would be at an end in India The Moguls accordingly made but a faint resistance and the whole weight of the action fell upon the Rajaputs The Maraja after his defeat was ashamed to appear at court He retreated to his own country but his wife a woman of a masculine spirit disdained to receive a husband not covered with victory She shut the gates of her castle against him He in vain remonstrated that though unsuccessful he had fought with the bravery of his ancestors as appeared from the number of the slain  "The slain" said she "have lest Jesswint without an  excuse To be defeated is no new thing among the Marajas but to survive a defeat is new Descended from their blood adopted by marriage into their house they left their glory in the hands of Jesswint and he has tarnished it with flight To be the messenger of the ruin of his armies to show the world that he fears death more than disgrace is now become the employment of my husband But I have no husband It is an impostor that knocks at our gates Jesswint is no more The blood of kings could not survive his loss of fame Prepare the funeral pile I will join in death my departed lord"  To such a pitch of enthusiasm had this woman carried her ideas of valour She herself was the daughter of the late Rana and Jesswint was of the same family He however prevailed upon her to open the gate of the castle by promising that he would levy a new army and recover from Aurungzêbe the glory which he had lost to that prince  Aurungzêbe remains at Ugein  The princes after their victory over the Maraja entered Ugein in triumph Morâd who loved battle as a pastime was unwilling to stop in that city but Aurungzêbe convinced him that it was necessary to refresh the troops for a few days after the fatigues of a long march and the toils of an obstinate action He at the same time informed him that time should be given to their victory to work upon the fears of the enemy  "Besides" said Aurungzêbe "there are thirty thousand men in the army of Dara whom I intend to gain over to my interest before we shall again engage"  The true cause of this delay was a want of information of the real state of the court of Agra If Dara was the sovereign Aurungzêbe had no doubt of carrying all before him on account of the unpopularity of that prince among the nobility but if the reins of government had reverted into the hands of Shaw Jehân who was in a manner adored both by the army and  the people he was sure that even his own troops would desert him in a day of battle He had sent privately expresses to his friends at Agra and he waited for their return  Perplexity of the emperor  The news of the battle near the Nirbidda arrived in the mean time at court Dara was enraged at the Moguls from whose cowardice or perfidy the rebels derived their success The emperor himself was perplexed beyond measure He was snsible of the determined resolution of his rebel sons he dreaded the violence of Dara He saw nothing but misfortune before him and some dreadful calamity hanging over himself and his family The eager preparations of Dara for another battle alarmed him as much as the approach of the rebels A victory would make Dara master of the empire a defeat would throw himself into the hands of those whom he opposed His mind flew from one resolution to another and he could six on none The prospect was gloomy before him and seeing no point on which he could rest his hopes he left all to chance  Preparations of Dara  Dara with the natural activity and vehemence of his temper prepared with redoubled vigour for the field He passed like a flame through the capital and kindled thousands into an eagerness equal to his own When the first news of the defeat of the Maraja came to court Dara sent an express to his son Solimân who besieged Suja in Mongeer He desired him to make the best terms which the urgency of the times would admit with Suja and to return to Agra by forced marches A negociation was opened accordingly with the besieged prince His neeessities made him listen with eagerness to a treaty Solimân in the name of the emperor reinstated him in the government of Bengal after having exacted from him a solemn promise of taking no farther part in the war He himself marched night and day to reinforce his  father and had he arrived in time Aurungzêbe might have given his hopes to the wind Solimân was then in the twentysixth year of his age graceful in his person and vigorous in his mind Nature seemed to have formed him for war He was brave in action sedate and possessing himself in the greatest dangers He was generous in his disposition liberal in his sentiments pleasing to his friends humane to his enemies He possessed the fire and warmth of Dara without his weaknesses the prudence of Aurungzêbe without his meanness and deceit  who marches against Aurungzêbe and Morâd  The Imperial army in the mean time marched out of Agra under the conduct of Dara The emperor became more and more perplexed as matters approached to a decision He knew that the nobles loved not Dara he knew that the best troops were absent with Solimân One expedient only remained and that if followed would have insured success He ordered the Imperial tent to be pitched without the walls declaring that he would take the field in person against the rebels His frineds saw an end to his troubles in this resolution His own army to a man would die in defence of his power and even the troops of Aurungzêbe and Morâd had openly declared that they would not draw their swords against Shaw Jehân The infatuation of Dara prevented his father's designs He had recourse to intreaty and when that failed to commands The emperor whose intellects had been in some measure impaired by his illness was at first shocked at the obstinacy of Dara That prince whose silial piety was even greater than his ambition waited upon his father He threw himself at his feet and earnestly requested that he would not endanger his health by taking the field as upon his life the prosperity of the empire depended in days of so much trouble  Charge given him by his father  The emperor having yielded to the intreaties of Dara conjured him though bent on war to avoid coming to action till the arrival of his son The malignity of his fate prevailed also over this advice He said not a word to his father but his countenance expressed chagrin and discontent  "Then go my son" said Shaw Jehân "but return not without victory to me Misfortune seems to darken the latter days of your father add not to his grief by presenting yourself before him in your distress lest he may be induced to say That prudence as well as fortune were wanting to Dara"  The prince had scarce parted with his father when news arrived of the march of the rebels from the city of Ugein Dara placed himself immediately at the head of the army which consisted of one hundred thousand horse with a thousand pieces of cannon He advanced hastily to the banks of the river Chunbul which is twenty miles from Agra A ridge of mountains which extend themselves to Guzerat advance into the plain country along the Chunbul to within twentyfive miles of the river Jumna and this pass Dara occupied with strong lines strengthened by redoubts which were mounted with artillery  Aurungzêbe turns the rear of the Imperial army June  Dara had not long remained behind his lines when the princes on the first of June appeared on the opposite bank of the Chunbul and pitched their camp within sight of the Imperial army Aurungzêbe reconnoitred the situation of the enemy but he was not to be forced His army consisted not of forty thousand men and they were fatigued with the heat of the weather and the length of their march But there was no time to be lost Solimân covered with laurels was approaching fast with the flower of the Imperial army to support his father's cause No hopes presented themselves to Aurungzêbe and he became of a sudden sullen melancholy and perplexed To retreat was ruin to advance destruction He was lost in suspence Morâd with his usual love  of arduous undertakings was for forcing the lines but a letter from Shaista the son of Asiph Jâh and who was third in command in the Imperial army broke off that measure by presenting a better to the brothers This treacherous lord informed Aurungzêbe that to attempt the lines would be folly and that the only means left him was to leave his camp standing to amuse Dara and to march through the hills by a byeroad which two chiefs who were directed to attend him in the evening would point out The princes closed with the proposal The guides joined them in the evening and they decamped with the greatest silence leaving their tents baggage and artillery under a strong guard who were to amuse the enemy The army moved about thirty miles that night and the next day they were discovered by the scouts of Dara in full march toward Agra  Dara's order of battle June  Dara decamped from his lines with precipitation leaving the greater part of his cannon behind him By a forced march he pushed between the enemy and the capital and on the fourth of June he presented himself before the rebels On the morning of the fifth the prince ordered the army to be formed in order of battle Rustum Chan an experienced general from Tartary marshalled the field The artillery was placed in the front joined together with chains to prevent the passage of the cavalry of the enemy Behind the artillery stood a number of camels mounted with small swivels which the riders of each camel without lighting could charge and discharge with ease In the rear were drawn up the musqueteers in three lines and the two wings were formed of the cavalry armed with bows and arrows together with sabres One third of the cavalry formed the reserve behind the lines Dara placed himself in the center mounted on a lofty elephant from which he could command a view of the field The treacherous Shaista took the command of the right wing and that of the  left was destined by Dara for Rustum That officer who was acknowleged the most experienced commander in Hindostan was actually at the head of the army He bore the commission of captaingeneral and all orders were issued by him He represented to Dara before the action commenced that he intended to place himself at the head of the reserve in the rear where he might direct the movements of the field and issue out his orders as the circumstances of affairs might require  "My post" said Dara "is in the front of battle and I expect that all my friends shall partake of my danger if they wish to share the glory which I hope to obtain"  The generous and intrepid spirit of Rustum was offended at this reflection He answered with a stern countenance and a determined tone of voice  "The front of battle has been always my post though I never contended for an empire and if I wished to change it today it was from an anxiety for the fortune of Dara"  The prince was struck with the impropriety of his own conduct He endeavoured to persuade Rustum to remain at the head of the reserve but he went beyond hearing and placed himself in the front of the left wing  That of Aurungzêbe  Aurungzêbe on the other hand having marshalled his army into order of battle requested of Morâd to take the command of the center He committed the left wing to his son Mahommed and he placed himself on the right Morâd was astonished and pleased at the ease with which Aurungzêbe assigned to him the post of honour But the crafty prince had two reasons for his conduct Morâd was haughty he had assumed the Imperial titles and though out of a pretended complaisance to his father he had laid them down he looked forward with undeviating ardour to the throne It was not the business of Aurungzêbe to offend him at this critical juncture But his other reason was equally prudent Rustum commanded the left wing of the enemy and he was the  most renowned general of the times He had passed many years in the service of the Tartars and Persians being bred up to the the field from his youth in which he had always eminently distinguished himself He had been present in one hundred general actions he was habituated to danger and perfect master of his own mind in the most desperate situations Aurungzêbe therefore could not trust the experience of Rustum against the conduct of any but his own  The battle begins  Both lines began now to move from wing to wing and the artillery opened on both sides Rustum advanced on the left with a hasty pace directing the march of his troops by the motion of his sword Aurungzêbe ordered a part of his artillery to point toward Rustum and that general received a cannonball in his breast when he had advanced within five yards of the enemy The whole wing stopt at the fall of Rustum but Sittersal one of the chiefs of the Rajaputs at the head of five thousand horse fell in sword in hand with Aurungzêbe Shaw Mahommed who commanded under the prince opposed the Rajaputs with great bravery A sharp conflict ensued and the Rajaputs began to file off when their leader engaged personally with Shaw Mahommed The Rajaputs strove to cover their chief but in vain he was cut down by the sabre of Mahommed The whole wing fell into disorder but did not fly and a promiscuous slaughter covered the field with dead  Dara's bravery  Dara mounted on his elephant in the mean time advanced with the center He was observed by his army to look over all the line and they gathered courage from his intrepid demeanor A part of the enemy's artillery was opposed to the very point where Dara advanced A heavy fire was kept up and his squadron fell into a kind of disorder but when he waved his hand for them to advance  they resumed their ranks and followed him with ardour Before he could come to blows with the enemy a second volley occasioned a second disorder He however stood up on his elephant and without any change in his countenance called out with a loud voice to advance with speed He himself in the mean time fell in with the first line or Morâd He rushed through with his elephant and opened a way for his horse who pressing into the heart of the enemy commenced a great slaughter  Morâd's bravery  The whole center under Morâd was broken and the prince himself was covered with wounds He endeavoured to lead his troops again to the charge but they were deaf to his commands He ordered his elephant to be driven among the thickest of the enemy being determined to fall with his fortune or by a brave example to reanimate his flying troops with hopes of recovering the day His boldness was attended with success His squadron seeing the enemy surrounding their prince were ashamed of their terror and poured around him Arib Dass an Indian chief thrice strove to reach Morâd with his sword but he did not succeed on account of the height of the elephant He however cut the pillars which supported the roof of the Amari or castle which falling upon the prince incumbered him in such a manner that he could not defend himself He however disengaged himself and dealt death with his arrows on every side In the mean time Mahommed the son of Aurungzêbe was sent by his father's orders from the left to the assistance of Morâd He came up when the prince was in the greatest danger Fresh spirit was given to the troops of Morâd and Dara received a check  Dara by an accident  The battle now raged with redoubled fury The elephant of Morâd rendered outrageous by wounds rushed forward through the columns of the enemy Mahommed ashamed of being left  behind followed him with great ardour Dara did not retreat He gave his orders with apparent composure But a cannonball having taken off the head of his fosterbrother who sat with him on the elephant he was almost blinded with the blood A rocket at the same time passing by his ear singed his turban a second followed and having stuck in the front of the Amari burst and broke it all to pieces His colour was seen then to change The lord who drove the elephant observed an alteration in the prince and whether through personal fear or for the safety of his master is uncertain retreated a few paces Dara reprimanded him with severity but the mischief was already done His squadrons saw the retreat of the prince and their spirit flagged He however ordered the driver to turn his elephant toward the enemy but that lord represented to him that now being marked out by the rebels it were better for him to mount his horse and pursue the fugitives for that now very few remained on the field He alighted but there was no horse to be found He fought for some time on foot At length he mounted a horse whose rider had been killed  is defeated  Almost the whole of both armies had now left the field Not a thousand men remained with Dara and scarce one hundred horse with Aurungzêbe and Morâd The latter however sought with increasing ardour His young son of about eight years of age sat with him upon the elephant Him he covered with his shield and dealt his arrows around on the enemy Aurungzêbe having in vain endeavoured to rally his flying squadrons advanced with fifty horsemen to the assistance of Morâd hoping more for an honourable death than for a victory It was at the very instant that he came to blows with the Imperialists that the unfortunate Dara dismounted from his elephant The squadrons who had still adhered to that prince seeing the elephant retreating with the Imperial standard  thought that Dara had been killed The cause for which they fought in their opinion no longer existed They betook themselves to flight and when Dara had mounted his horse he found the field bare of all his troops He fled with precipitation and the rebel princes found themselves at the head of only two hundred horsemen in possession of an unexpected victory  Reflections  This battle in which many thousands were slain on both sides was lost to Dara by an accident though that prince was guilty of previous follies which made men forbode no good to his arms Had he sat on his elephant a few minutes longer the princes his brothers would have been involved in those irretrievable misfortunes which now surrounded him But his evil stars prevailed He who never received counsel before was ruined by hearkening to advice and Aurungzêbe who had placed his hopes on art and intrigue owed at last his success to his valour Dara like a desperate gambler threw all upon throw and when Fortune favoured him in that he turned the dye for his foes Had he permitted Shaw Jehân to have taken the field his brothers would scarce have dared to negociate for their lives had he waited for his gallant son it would not have been a contest but a flight But ambition had dazzled the eyes of Dara and he could not see things in their proper light Had the emperor appeared at the head of his forces his power would be at an end Had Solimân arrived fresh from the conquest of Suja the glory of victory would have rested upon that prince Dara unfortunately for himself was from his love of power afraid of his father and from the desire of fame envious of the renown of his son  CHAP VI  ReflectionsDara appears before his fatherHis flight to DelhiThe army deserts Solimân ShekôShaista Chan condemned to deathRescuedThe confederate princes appear before

which quashed for ever the hopes of Dara and gave the crown of Hindostan to Aurungzêbe was fought within sixteen miles of Agra The victor astonished at a piece of good fortune which he did not expect pursued not his enemies beyond the field The fugitives on both sides had rallied in the rear of the small parties who continued the action and presented a shew of firmness without any inclination of renewing the combat To an unconcerned spectator it would have been difficult to determine which party had prevailed The flight on each side was equal and the field was left by both armies to the dead But Dara was conquered in his own mind he passed suddenly through the halfformed lines of his rallied army and men who wanted but an excuse for flight relinquished their ground with precipitation Aurungzêbe was first convinced  of his victory by its consequences but whether from policy or fear is uncertain he forbore to advance towards Agra He gave time to his troops to recover from their terror as well as room to his enemies to increase their panic besides the affairs of his rival were not desperate Should the emperor take the field in person the rebel princes notwithstanding the advantages which they had obtained would have vanished from his presence But his distemper had not left Shaw Jehân and he was incumbered with the indolence of age  Dara appears before his father  The emperor had sat all day in anxious expectation in the tower over that gate of the citadel which looked toward the field of battle Parties of fugitives had often alarmed his fears but the expresses from Dara during the time of action had as often restored his hopes The prince at length came to the foot of the wall with marks of his own defeat To mention the result of the battle was superfluous his appearance betrayed misfortune  "The rebels I perceive have prevailed" said Shaw Jehân with a sigh "but Dara Shekô must have had some other cause than fear for his flight"    "Yes" replied the prince "there is a cause The traitor Shaista Chan I have lost the empire but let him not escape unpunished"  The emperor bent his eyes to the ground and for some time uttered not one word at length suddenly starting up he said  "What means Dara to do"    "To defend these walls"  replied the prince  "You deceive yourself" said Shaw Jehân "walls are no defence to those who have failed in the field"  Having expressed himself in these words he ordered the byestanders to remove He then advised Dara to set out immediately for Delhi He told him That the governor of that city should have orders to supply him with all the public money in his possession and that an express should be immediately dispatched to his son Solimân to march along the  northern banks of the Ganges and to join him in the province of Doâb which lies between that river and the Jumna  Flies  Dara approving of this advice retired to his own palace and made preparations for his immediate flight He loaded all his elephants and chariots with his women and slaves and for want of beasts of burden he imprudently left his treasure behind About midnight the unfortunate prince issued out of Agra mounted on horseback accompanied by a few menial servants One of the pikemen who attended him had the insolence to ride close by his side and to murmur in his ears concerning the loss which he himself sustained by such an abrupt departure Dara was enraged at this sudden mark of his own fallen condition  "Slave" said he "murmur not at your fate Behold me who but yesterday commanded armies reduced thus low and forget your own trivial misfortunes Behold me who am called great as Darius" alluding to his own name "obliged to fly by night and be silent concerning your fate"  The pikeman was struck by the reproof He shrunk back and the other servants wept One of them was so much enraged that he prepared to chastise the slave but Dara interposing said  "Forbear the friends of the unfortunate have a right to complain in their presence"  to Delhi  Dara proceeded through night and deceived his misfortunes by repeating some of the elegies of Hafiz a famous poet of Shiraz When he had rode two miles from Agra he heard the noise of horsemen approaching from behind He stood and drew his sword but they were two private soldiers who having perceived the prince passing through the gate of the city took a resolution to join him They told their business and Dara was prevented from thanking them by his tears He had not advanced many  miles when an officer with forty troopers joined him and by the dawn of the morning several men of distinction came up with him with three hundred horse With this retinue he continued his rout to Delhi and arrived in that city on the third day after his departure from Agra  Raises sorces  The emperor anxious about Dara sent to his palace soon after his departure He understood that in the confusion he had neglected to carry along with him his treasure He immediately ordered fiftyseven mules to be loaded with gold coin and to be sent to his son under the protection of a detachment of the guards But a tribe of Hindoos who have since made a figure under the name of Jates having intelligence of this treasure defeated the party and seized the money This was a dreadful blow to Dara Thirty lacks of the public money were only found in the possession of the governor of Delhi and the merchants and bankers would subscribe to no loan in the present untoward posture of the prince's affairs The threats of military execution at last enabled him to raise considerable sums for which he gave orders on the Imperial treasury Soldiers flocked round his standard and he had in a few days the appearance of an army  Aurungzêbe corrupts  Aurungzêbe who still remained encamped near the field of battle was informed of every transaction in Agra by his spies The greatest lords who looked upon him as the heir if not the actual possessor of the empire endeavoured to gain his favour by giving him intelligence He found that all the hopes of Dara depended upon the army under the command of his son and he resolved to gain it over to his own views He sent letters to the Raja Joy Singh he wrote to Debere Chan who were next in command to Solimân Shekô He exaggerated if possible the  hopeless condition of Dara he informed them that the army of that prince had joined his standard that he himself had fled unattended to Delhi that he could not escape as orders had been distributed through all the provinces to seize him as a public enemy  "Shaw Jehân" continued Aurungzêbe "is rendered unfit for government by age and infirmities Your hopes and even your safety must depend upon me and as you value both seize Solimân and send him to my camp"  the army of prince Solimân  Joy Singh who received the first letters from Aurungzêbe was perplexed His fears stood against his adherence to Solimân his honour rendered him averse to side with Aurungzêbe He went to the tent of Debere and that lord placed the letters which he also had received in his hands To seize the prince was a measure of peril from his known valour to attempt to seduce the army whilst he remained at its head dangerous They followed the middle course as the safest When the news of the defeat of Dara arrived at the camp about a day's march beyond Allahabâd the prince called a council of war He proposed to march straight to Delhi they dissented and plainly told him that they would not stir from the camp till more certain advices arrived The prince anxious to join his father was distressed beyond measure He endeavoured to persuade them but their measures had been taken He applied to the army they too were traitors and disobeyed Instead of being able to assist Dara he became afraid of his own safety He resolved to leave a camp where he had no authority He however altered his opinion and remained but the principal officers with their retinues left the camp  Shaista Chan condemned to death  Shaista Chan who had commanded the right wing of Dara's army in the late battle betrayed his trust and retreated without  coming to blows with the rebels He returned to Agra and a message was sent him by the emperor commanding him to appear in the presence His friends advised him not to obey but his confidence was equal to his want of faith He trusted in his own power he was encouraged by the vicinity of the victorious princes He went and stood undaunted in the presence The emperor offended before at his treachery was enraged at his impudence  "You villain" said he "you son of a villain how could you presume to betray my son and me"  Shaista took sire at the reproach  "The name" he replied "I confess is not insuitable to Asiph Jâh he invested Shaw Jehân with power by delivering the heir of the crown into his hands"  The emperor started from his throne and drew his sword He looked furiously around on the nobles and cried  "Will none of you seize the traitor"  All were silent the emperor repeated the same words Fowlâd Chan stept forth threw Shaista to the ground and binding his hands behind him asked the further pleasure of Shaw Jehân  "Throw him headlong" said he "from the Imperial bastion"  When they were dragging him to execution Shaista cried out to the emperor  "Shall you who are the vicegerent of God break his laws by shedding blood on the seventh day of the holy month of Ramzân"  Shaw Jehân hung down his head for a moment and then ordered him to be kept bound till the next day  Rescued  The friends of Shaista were in the mean time apprised of his danger They gathered from all quarters and collected near ten thousand men who came to the gate of the citadel and peremptorily demanded him from the emperor Shaw Jehân continued obstinate during the night In the morning the force of the rebels had increased and he perceived that they were resolved to come to extremities He sent for the prisoner and obliged him  to write an order for them to disperse They saw through this piece of policy They refused to obey the commands of a man subject to another's power Scaling ladders were actually applied to the walls and the emperor was obliged to comply with the demands of the insurgents and to restore Shaista to his freedom  The princes appear before Agra  On the ninth of June the confederate princes appeared with their army before the capital The city was in no condition to sustain a siege and the gates were left open Aurungzêbe declining to enter Agra pitched his tent in a garden without the walls His schemes were not yet ripe for execution and he assumed an appearance of moderation Morâd lay ill of his wounds and being unable to attend to business a fair field was left for his brother The emperor when the van of the rebels appeared in sight ordered the gates of the citadel which was a place of great strength to be shut This resolution alarmed Aurungzêbe To attack his father would be a measure of great imprudence His health being reestablished his subjects still looked up to him as their only lawful sovereign Aurungzêbe therefore resolved to substitute art in the place of force  Aurungzêbe sends to his father  When he arrived at the gate of the city he sent a trusty messenger to his father He ordered him to touch the ground in his name before the emperor and to signify to him that Aurungzêbe still retained for him the affection of a son and the loyalty of a subject that his grief for what had happened was exceedingly great that he lamented the ambition and evil designs of Dara who had forced him to extremities that he rejoiced extremely at the emperor's recovery from his indisposition and that he himself remained without the city in humble expectation of his commands Shaw Jehân being no stranger to the dark crafty and intriguing disposition of Aurungzêbe received his messenger with  affected joy He had long disovered his passion for reigning and he resolved to meet deceit with duplicity He however was not a match in art for his son and by endeavouring to intrap Aurungzêbe he himself fell at last into the snare  The conference  Shaw Jehân to expiscate the real designs of his rebellious sons sent his eldest daughter Jehanâra to visit them upon their arrival at the gates of Agra Aurungzêbe having owned the superiority of Morâd the princess went first to his tent Morâd was of a disposition that could neither conceal his hatred nor his love He knew that Jehanâra was inviolably attached to the interests of his elder brother and being at the same time fretful through the pain of his wounds he treated her with disrespect and even used harsh expressions The haughty spirit of Jehanâra was impatient of insult She called for her chair in her rage and told him that his brutality was equal to his crimes The behaviour of Morâd to his sister was instantly carried to Aurungzêbe by his spies He ran out of his tent and stopt her chair  "Will my sister" he said "leave the camp without enquiring concerning my health My long absence Jehanâra has I fear blotted me out of the memory of my relations Should you not deign yourself to honour me with your presence it would have been kind to have sent to me one of your meanest slaves to give me some accounts of my father"  Having flattered her pride with such expressions as these he prevailed upon her to enter his tent where she was treated with the highest respect and distinction  of the princess Jehanâra  To gain the confidence of Jehanâra he pretended the greatest remorse for his own behaviour He told her that his happiness in life depended upon his father's forgiveness of his errors  "But why did I call them errors Jehanâra" said he "they are crimes though I might plead as an excuse that I was deceived  by designing men but my folly in believing them has thrown discredit on my understanding in my own eyes"  His asseverations were accompanied with tears and the princess was deceived  "I am no stranger" she replied "to the sentiments of the emperor on a subject which has caused so much of his sorrow He is most offended at Morâd who has added the name of Sovereign to his other crimes He considers Aurungzêbe as only misled by misrepresentation Morâd as an obstinate and determined rebel Desert him therefore and you may not only depend upon forgiveness but upon all the favour an indulgent parent can bestow on a son whom he loves"  and Aurungzêbe  Aurungzêbe's countenance appeared lightened up with joy during the time which she employed in speaking But an affected darkness returned upon his features when she mentioned Morâd  "Dara's party" he then began "is ruined and Fortune has added to the friends of Morâd The first is unpopular on account of his passionate severity among the nobility the latter beloved for the open honesty of his disposition and his unequalled valour As for me" continued Aurungzêbe "I am what I seem a man devoted to the service of God a character little calculated to gain the favour of men But should Dara appear to have friends to support my endeavours to regain the esteem of my father I venture to assure Jehanâra that I will succeed or perish in the attempt"  He spoke these words with such an appearance of emphatic sincerity that the princess was overjoyed In the openness of her heart she informed him of all the resources of her brother Dara and she mentioned the names of his principal friends Many who pretended to be in the interest of Aurungzêbe were of the number though they had yielded for the present to the bias of fortune Without any personal affection for Dara they affected his cause from a principle of justice  "I am rejoiced  Jehanâra" said Aurungzêbe "at the discovery you have made No doubts now remain to perplex my mind Go to my father and tell him that in two days he shall see Aurungzêbe at his feet"  Emperor writes to Dara  Shaw Jehân upon this occasion forgot the natural cautiousness of his character He looked upon his schemes as completed and thought he saw Aurungzêbe already submitting to his clemency In the fulness of his heart he sat down and wrote a letter to Dara He acquainted the prince that the bad aspect of his fortune began to change  "Aurungzêbe" said he "is disgusted with the insolence of Morâd He is to abandon that haughty young man and to throw himself at my feet A foolish and inexperienced boy who owed all his success to the abilities of his brother must soon fall when deprived of his support But we are not to depend upon the contrition of Aurungzêbe When he shall enter the citadel his person will be seized Hold yourself therefore in readiness to march with all expedition to Agra Two days more shall carry to you accounts of the full completion of our designs"  The emperor placed his letter in the hands of Nahirdil one of his trusty slaves He ordered him to set out for Delhi at midnight with all expedition  His letter intercepted  The impatience of the emperor proved fatal to his schemes Shaista Chan had his spies in the presence and one of them informed him that a letter had been written and given in charge to Nahirdil He suspected that it was intended for Dara and he occupied the road toward Delhi with some faithful friends Nahirdil had scarce issued out of the gate of the city when some horsemen surrounded and seized him He was brought to Shaista who perused the letter Elevated with the discovery he immediately went to the palace of Aurungzêbe for that prince  had now taken up his residence in the city The slave was confined with the greatest secrecy The prince read the letter without emotion He had always doubted the emperor's sincerity when he promised his forgiveness to a son who had ruined his armies in two battles He however prosecuted his plan of deceit with indefatigable perseverance To besiege his father in the citadel would be an unpopular if not a dangerous measure The reverence which the army still had for their aged sovereign would prevent them from drawing their swords against him But the citadel must be possessed and the person of the father must be placed in the hands of his ambitious son otherwise he may give his hopes to the wind  Aurungzêbe's schemes  On the fifteenth of June Aurungzêbe was to have performed his promise of visiting his father in the citadel The emperor full of anxiety looked forward to the appointed hour in which he saw a period to his misfortunes A letter from his son was delivered into his hands when he expected him in person He told his father that his crimes were of so deep a dye that he could not divest himself of fear that the injured emperor would not forgive him  "However much desirous I am of being received into favour I cannot risque my personal safety in the presence The guilty are always timid Permit me therefore to receive the most convincing proofs of my sovereign's forgiveness and let my son Mahommed who reveres the person and authority of his grandfather be admitted into the citadel with a guard for the protection of my person"  Shaw Jehân anxious for the execution of his own project found that without consenting to these proposals it must be entirely frustrated He therefore returned for answer that Mahommed with a certain number of men might come  to seize the emperor  Mahommed accordingly having received the proper instructions from his father entered the citadel and disposed his party in different places The emperor in the mean time had concealed a body of men in a court adjoining to the haram The prince roaming about lighted on these men He complained to the emperor of an intention against his father's person he therefore plainly told him that till these men were removed he would send a messenger to Aurungzêbe to stop him from coming into the citadel Shaw Jehân whether he put some confidence in the promises of his son or that he thought he could seize him by means of the women and eunuchs of the seraglio is uncertain but he removed the soldiers out of the fort as a proof of his sincerity It afterwards appeared that the emperor rested his hopes on a number of robust Tartar women in the haram whom he had armed with daggers and who from the spirit of their country were fit for an undertaking of boldness  Shaw Jehân taken prisoner  Mahommed contrary to his expectations found his party superior within the citadel He however concealed his intentions Every thing was settled and the emperor and his grandson remained in silent expectation News was at last brought that Aurungzêbe had mounted his horse and that the procession of his retinue was approaching Shaw Jehân was elevated with hopes but the crafty prince as if struck with a fit of devotion ordered his cavalcade to change their course and to move toward the tomb of Akbâr where he intended to offer up his prayers to Heaven When the emperor was informed of this circumstance he started up from his throne in great rage  "Mahommed" said he to the prince "what means Aurungzêbe by this behaviour Is he more anxious to appease the spirit of his great ancestor for his crimes than the offended majesty of his own father"  Mahommed calmly replied  "My father had never any  intention to visit the emperor" "What then brought Mahommed hither" retorted Shaw Jehan "To take charge of the citadel"  Mahommed coolly rejoined The emperor finding himself betrayed and outwitted by his grandson bore him down with a torrent of opprobrious names The prince seeing his passion rising beyond the bounds of reason retired from the presence with the usual obeisance and left his rage to subside at leisure  He offers the empire  The emperor after the heat of his passion was over began to reflect upon his deplorable condition He accused his own weakness more than his fortune and he was ashamed to have fallen into a snare which he himself had laid Resentment and a desire of immediate revenge prevailed over every other passion of his soul He sent again for Mahommed The prince came and found his grandfather with his hand upon the Coran and his eyes raised to the Imperial crown which was suspended over his head  "You see Mahommed" he said "these sacred objects before an unfortunate old man I am overwhelmed with rage worn out with age and disease It is in your power young man to make me for once happy in my latter days Release me from prison and by these" pointing to the crown and holding the Coran in his hand "I solemnly swear to make you emperor of the Moguls"  The prince was silent but various passions flew alternately over his features  "And do you hesitate" begun Shaw Jehân "to do an action which will at once gain you the favour of Heaven and the empire of Hindostan Are you afraid that it shall be hereafter related to your dispraise that you delivered an aged grandfather from prison and disgrace"  The prince hung down his head for a moment then suddenly starting rushed out without uttering a word  to the son of Aurungz  be  It is difficult to determine what motive induced the prince to decline the offer made to him by Shaw Jehân He was ambitious nor was he remarkable for his filial piety He probably doubted his grandfather's sincerity or he did not chuse to trust to proposals imposed by necessity Aurungzêbe however escaped from imminent danger through the selfdenial of his son Had the emperor appeared in public at the head of his friends Aurungzêbe would shrink from before him and the haughty Morâd would fly The nobles who adhered to the interest of the brothers and even the common soldiers had repeatedly declared that they would not draw their swords against a prince under whose long and auspicious government their country had so much flourished The first repulse received from Mahommed did not induce the emperor to relinquish his designs He sent to him a second time but he refused to come to his presence He had still the keys of the citadel in his possession and neither Aurungzêbe nor his son chose to use force to obtain them from him Two days passed in this suspence Shaw Jehân was obstinate and Mahommed stood on his guard within the walls The first however despaired of gaining over the latter to his purpose and in the evening of the second day he sent him the keys of the fortress and desired him to acquaint his father that he might now come in full security to see his imprisoned sovereign  Aurungzêbe writes to the emperor  Aurungzêbe excused himself in a letter He complained of his father's intentions against him under the mask of elemency and friendship that when he pretended to forgive one son he assisted another son with money to take away his life in war  "If the emperor complains" said Aurungzêbe "Dara is only to blame He owes his misfortunes to the ambition and evil designs of a son unworthy of his favour As for me" continued the prince "no injuries can alter my affections Nature makes me  wish well to my father and Heaven has imposed my regard for him upon me as a duty But though I love the emperor I also love my life and I am determined not to trust it in the hands of even a father till the influence of illdesigning persons has departed quite from his mind Let him in the mean while pass his time in that serene tranquillity which is suitable to his years and when I shall have disabled Dara from doing further harm to the empire I myself will come and open the gates of the citadel"  This letter was only intended to deceive the people It was publicly read to the nobles and it is even doubtful whether it was sent at all to the emperor  Deceives Morâd  When the prince Mahommed took possession of the person of the emperor with the citadel his father as has been already related was paying his devotions at the shrine of the emperor Akbâr When intelligence of his son's success was carried to him he immediately waited upon Morâd in his palace and told him all the circumstances of the affair That prince who knew that he could have no hopes from his father was much pleased at hearing of his imprisonment Aurungzêbe in the mean time saluted him emperor and said  "Morâd had before the name but he now has the power of a sovereign My wishes" continued he "are now completely accomplished I have contributed to raise a prince worthy of the throne of our ancestors and I have but one favour to ask for all the fatigue which I have undergone" "Speak your wishes" said Morâd "and they shall be instantly granted" "This world" replied Aurungzêbe "has already overwhelmed me too much with its cares I long to throw the burden away I am tired of the vain bustle and pageantry of life Will therefore the emperor of the Moguls permit me to make a pilgrimage to Mecca will he give me some small allowance to enable me to pass my days in ease and in the exercise  of prayer and constant devotion"  Morâd though secretly overjoyed at his resolution made some slight attempts to dissuade him Aurungzêbe was determined His brother yielded to his importunity and the crafty prince prepared for a journey which he never intended to make  Prepares to pursue Dara  Whilst this farce was acting at Agra advices arrived that Dara had collected a considerable force at Delhi Officers of distinction crowded to the prince every day from the distant provinces Aurungzêbe pretended to be alarmed He advised his brother to march in person to finish the war That prince who was fond of action prepared for the field but he wanted money The old emperor had concealed part of the Imperial treasure Aurungzêbe had secreted the rest The army of Morâd had not been paid for two months and they began to murmur The prince called together all the bankers of Agra He offered to mortgage part of the revenue for an immediate loan but they refused to give him credit He was enraged beyond measure and he prepared to use force when his brother advised him against an act of injustice and promised to discharge the arrears due to the army out of his own private fortune Morâd acceded to the proposal without observing its fatal tendency Aurungzêbe by this expedient became at once popular in the army and in the city  Counterplot of Morâd  The designs of Aurungzêbe were now too palpable not to be perceived The friends of Morâd had long seen through his deceit and the prince himself though not suspicious was now convinced that he covered ambition under the mask of sanctity The preparations for Mecca had been converted into preparations for the field He told his brother that he still stood in need of his advice He marched in front from Agra with a division of the army and Morâd having created his uncle Shaista captaingeneral  of the Imperial forces left that lord in the government of Agra and followed Aurungzêbe The latter prince having arrived at Muttra received intelligence that Dara had taken the rout of Lahore He stopt and waited for the arrival of his brother who joined him the next day The latter had on his march been convinced by his friends that his brother had designs on his life and selfpreservation as well as ambition rendered it necessary for him to prevent the falling blow  Miscarries  The day after Morâd's arrival at the camp near Muttra he invited his brother to an entertainment Aurungzêbe who never had suspected the open temper of Morâd accepted of the invitation When the brothers sat at dinner Nazir Shabâs highsteward of the household who was in the secret entered suddenly and whispered in Morâd's ear that now was the time to make a rent in a magnificent dress Aurungzêbe whose eye could trace the thoughts in the features of the face was alarmed at this mysterious whispering as well as at the affected gaiety of his brother He remained silent and Morâd dispatched Shabâs with only desiring him to wait the signal Aurungzêbe was now convinced that there was a design against his life He complained suddenly of a violent pain in his bowels and rising under a pretence of retiring joined his guards and returned to his own quarter of the camp  Morâd deceived  Morâd ascribed his brother's departure to his illness and entertained no idea that he had the least suspicion of his own intentions In three days he recovered of the pretended pain in his bowels He received his brother's congratulations with every mark of esteem and affection and the day after he sent him an invitation to come to his tent to see some beautiful women whom he had collected for his amusement Their performances  in singing in dancing and in playing upon various instruments of music were he said beyond any thing ever seen in Hindostan He enlarged upon their grace their beauty the elegant symmetry of their limbs The mind of Morâd who was naturally a great lover of pleasure was inflamed at the description and contrary to the advice of all his friends he went to his brother's quarter On the arrival of the emperor as Aurungzêbe affected to call his brother he was received by the young ladies in an inner tent They were handsome beyond description and the voluptuous prince was struck with a pleasing astonishment at their charms  and seized  An elegant entertainment was in the mean time served up to the sound of vocal and instrumental music Morâd was elevated and called for wine of Shirâz The ladies sat round him in a circle and Aurungzêbe throwing off his usual austerity began to partake of the wine Morâd in a short time became intoxicated and his brother instead of wine imposed upon him bumpers of arrack He at length fell asleep on a sopha in the arms of one of the ladies Aurungzêbe had in the mean time given orders to some of his officers to entertain the lords who attended Morâd in the same voluptuous manner Even his bodyguard were intoxicated with wine so that the unfortunate prince was left without defence  by Aurungzebe  Aurungzêbe gave orders to Ziffer Jung and three other lords to enter the tent and to bind his brother The lady retired upon their coming and they advanced to the sopha on which he lay His sword and dagger had been already removed by the care of Aurungzêbe and they began softly to bind his hands Morâd started up at this operation and began to deal around his blows The lords were terrified and the prince began to call aloud  for his sword Aurungzêbe who stood at the door of the tent thrust his head from behind the curtain and said with a menacing voice  "He has no choice but death or submission dispatch him if he resists"  Morâd hearing the voice of his brother began to upbraid him and submitted to his fate Nazir Shabas his principal friend and adviser was at the same instant seized He had been sitting under a canopy before the paymastergeneral's tent and at a signal given the ropes of the four pole  were at once cut and before he could extricate himself he was bound The other lords who were attached to the prince being surrounded with armed men were brought before Aurungzêbe to whom they swore allegiance A murmur ran through the camp but it was an ineffectual sound and the army as if but half wakened from a dream fell fast asleep again  Sent prisoner to Agra  The night was not far advanced when Morâd was seized and bound Before daylight appeared he and his favourite were mounted on an elephant in a covered amari or castle and sent off under an escort to Agra Fearing that some attempts might be made to rescue them Aurungzêbe ordered three other elephants to be sent off before them attended by guards to elude pursuers The precaution was unnecessary Mankind forsook Morâd with his fortune In action in the manly exercises of the field he had many admirers but the accomplishments of his mind acquired him but few friends and even those whom he favoured with his generosity were disgusted at his haughtiness He fell by attempting to be artful Had he followed in his designs against his brother the natural bias of his own intrepid mind he could not have failed but he met that crafty prince in his own province of deceit and he was foiled This remarkable transaction happened in the camp near Muttra on the sixth of July  Aurungzêbe advances to Delhi  Though Shaista who was left in the government of Agra was sufficiently attached to the cause of Aurungzêbe that cautious prince left his son Mahommed in that capital to watch any unforeseen events that might arise To the joint care of Mahommed and Shaista the unfortunate Morâd was committed and his brother having no fears remaining in that quarter moved his camp from Muttra and arrived at Delhi on the twentysixth of July Though he had not assumed the Imperial titles he created Omrahs in that city the first of whom was Ziffer Jung whom he dignified with the name of Chan Jehân Under that lord he detached a division of his army against Dara That prince upon the news of the approach of Ziffer decamped from Sirhind and took the rout of Lahore In his march he laid under military execution all the Rajas and governors of districts who refused to join He raised considerable sums in his way and having crossed the Suttuluz ordered all the boats on that river to be destroyed  Dara flies to Lahore  Dara having advanced beyond the river Bea took possession of Lahore Giving his army time to breathe in that city he employed himself in levying troops and in collecting the Imperial revenue Daôod the general of his forces remained in the mean time at the village of Tilbundi with half the army to guard the passage of the river Bea Aurungzêbe upon advice of the dispositions of Dara reinforced the army of Ziffer with five thousand horse under the conduct of Chillulla The war with Dara from being protracted became serious The minds of the people were divided as long as two princes continued in the field Aurungzêbe with his caution was rapid in his designs He knew how to use as well as how to gain a victory His suspicious temper saw peril rising from delay and therefore notwithstanding the solstitial rains were at their height and the country deluged  with water he prepared to move toward Lahore with all his forces  Aurungzêbe mounts the throne  Apprehending that his not assuming the name of emperor would be considered by mankind as a tacit acknowledgment of the injustice of his proceedings he resolved to exalt the Imperial umbrella over his head His affected selfdenial upon former occasions stood at present in the way of his designs He was ashamed to take upon himself an honour which from motives of religion he had pretended before to reject His most intimate friends knew however the secret thoughts of his mind They insinuated to the nobles that Aurungzêbe from declining so long to ascend the throne seemed to have still an intention of retiring from the world that in his zeal for religion he might be induced to leave his friends to the resentment of his enemies that therefore it was the business of all to force upon him in a manner a power necessary to their own safety They waited upon him in a body He seemed disappointed and even offended at their proposal At length he suffered himself to be persuaded  "You are" said he "resolved to sacrifice my love of retirement to your own ease But be it so God will perhaps give me that tranquillity upon the throne which I hoped to find in a cell and if less of my time shall be employed in prayer more of it will be spent in good actions I should only have an inclination for virtuous deeds in my retreat but as  mperor of the Moguls I shall have the power of doing them These motives and not the vain pomp of greatness induce me to assume the empire"  at Delhi  On the second of August in an assembly of the nobility he mounted the throne in the garden of Azabâd near Delhi No pompous ceremonies were used upon the occasion for he affected  to despise magnificence His finances at the same time were low and he prudently considered that money in the present situation of affairs would be better bestowed upon an army than on the idle pageantry of state He assumed upon his accession to the throne the pompous title of ALLUMGIRE OR THE CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD being then near the close of the fortieth year of his age  Reflections  The means taken by Aurungzêbe to obtain the empire were scarce more justifiable than those by which he secured to himself the undisturbed possession of the throne Religion the convenient cloke of knavery in all countries was the chief engine of his ambition and in that respect he relied on the credulity of mankind to a degree of unpardonable imprudence His selfdenial and moderate professions agreed so little with his actions that it is even ashonishing how any person of common reflection could have been for a moment deceived But the vulgar give implicit faith to sanctity in its most questionable form and Morâd by whose popularity and valour his brother overthrew the hopes of Dara suspected not a duplicity to which his own soul was a stranger To deceive that prince was to secure the empire Bearing more the appearance of an hermit himself than that of a competitor for the throne the army looked up to Morâd who being addicted beyond measure to pleasure gave up the influence as well as the labour of business to his brother Aurungzêbe to support his ambitious views was obliged to have recourse to arts which stamp his character with meanness whilst they prove the abilities of his mind  on the conduct  Morâd with many commendable qualities was also distinguished by disgusting weaknesses Instead of that haughty pride which recommends itself in its very absurdities he was puffed up  with unmanly vanity A stranger to his own merit in those things in which he excelled in the opinion of the world he arrogated to himself praise in provinces for which nature had altogether rendered him unfit With an open and generous disposition he wished to be thought artful and severe and blind to his abilities in the field he endcavoured to carry the palm in the cabinet To mention to him the designs of his brother was a satire upon his penetration to suggest to him caution was in his eyes an accusation of his courage He looked not around him into the conduct of others and he abhorred every enquiry into his own Under the shadow of this careless and arrogant vanity in Morâd his brother fabricated at leisure his own designs But his excessive eagerness to heighten the deceit was the means of its being discovered Morâd himself saw through the veil of flattery which he had laid over his ambitious views but the vanity which at first induced him to give faith to Aurungzêbe made him afterwards despise his insincerity He fell at last a victim to his own arrogant folly  and rise  Aurungzêbe however owed not altogether his success either to his own hypocrisy or to the weakness of his brother Naturally averse to pomp and magnificence he affected all his life that humble deportment which brings the prince near to the people Without being virtuous from principle he was an enemy to vice from constitution and he never did an act of injustice till he aspired to the throne In his private character he was an example of decency to others an affectionate parent a sincere friend a just master Destitute of that elegance of person and that winning behaviour which had rendered his brothers the idols of the people wherever they moved he endeavoured to acquire a degree of popularity by the austerity of his manners Like the rest of the family of Timur he was bred up with very free notions  upon the subject of religion but various circumstances induced him afterwards to assume the appearance of a rigid devotee His brothers by encouraging men of all religions had offended the followers of Mahommed The posterity of those Moguls who under Baber conquered India and soldiers of fortune from Tartary and Persia occupied the greatest number of the places of profit and trust in the empire These could not see without envy men of different persuasions from themselves admitted into the confidence of princes who still professed the Mahommedan faith Though silent at court they murmured in secret and lamented the declining state of a religion under the auspices of which they had extended their government over India Aurungzêbe by his rigid adherence to the tenets inculcated in the Coran gained the esteem of all those who if the expression may be used were the chains which kept together the nations of Hindostan under the house of Timur But the influence which Aurungzêbe derived from his devotion did not for many years suggest an ambition to aspire to the empire He only hoped that under the cloke of sanctity he might pass in safety his life under any of his brothers whom Fortune might place on the throne  of Aurungzêbe  That specious appearance which the actions of a man of religion must wear in the eyes of the world facilitated his schemes In his long march from the Decan his troops observed a most exact discipline No ravages were committed no injustice done When he sat down with his army in a field of corn he either paid the estimated value to the owners or gave a receipt for it as a part of the revenue due to the crown  "Though I am forced" said he "into a war by the machinations of Dara I cannot consider myself as in an enemy's country"  When the people came to decide their differences before him he remanded  them to the officers of the empire  "Fortune" he was heard to say "may change the prince but the fundamental laws of the state must not be changed Should I fail in my present enterprize" continued he to the petitioners "my judgment would not avail you nay it would do you harm with the conquerors But if I shall succeed in my undertakings I promise to acquiesce in the determinations of the Imperial judges"  These moderate sentiments contributed to reconcile the minds of the people to his government and even induced them to ascribe the most wicked of his actions to necessity  Intelligence  When the news of his having mounted the throne arrived at Agra the governor filled every corner of the city with public demonstrations of joy The people were rather struck with surprize than moved with gladness They however observed that cautious silence which suits the subjects of despotism The noise of the artillery on the walls of the citadel saluted the old emperor's ears and rouzed him from the melancholy into which he had been plunged by his misfortunes  "Go Jehanâra" he said for his daughter was the only person near him "go and learn the cause of this sudden mark of joy But why should we enquire The gladness of those who surround us must add to our grief Some new misfortune must have fallen on Dara look not abroad lest the first object to strike your eyes should be the head of a brother whom you tenderly loved"  Jehanâra bursting into tears arose and in the passage which led to the haram was met by the chief eunuch who was hastening to the emperor with the news  concerning his accession  The eyes of Shaw Jehân flashed with rage He rosehe walked to and fro through the apartment but he uttered not one word His daughter sat at a distance in tears he raised his  eyes and looked stedfastly for some time on the figure of a crown which hung suspended from the ceiling over his head He called at length the chief eunuch  "Take" said he "that bauble away it mocks me with the memory of my former condition" The tear stood in his eye "Yet stay thy hand" resumed the emperor "this would be owning the right of Aurungzêbe"  He beckoned to the eunuch to retire he stood involved in thought  "The new emperor Jehanâra" said Shaw Jehân "has prematurely mounted his throne He should have added the murder of a father to the other crimes which have raised him so high But this perhaps is also art he wants to deprive me by misrepresentation of what remains of my fame before he deprives me of life"  How received by Shaw Jehân  Whilst Shaw Jehân was making these melancholy reflections on his own lost condition a message was brought to him from Mahommed the eldest son of Aurungzêbe who had remained at Agra He begged leave to have permission to wait upon his grandfather The emperor starting from his reverie at the name of Mahommed replied to the messenger  "If he comes as an enemy I have no power to prevent him if as a friend I have now no crown to bestow"  alluding to his offer to Mahommed when that prince seized the citadel The messenger told him That Mahommed wished only to be admitted to communicate to the emperor the reasons which induced his father to mount the throne  Fathers" replied Shaw Jehân "have been dethroned by their sons but to insult the misfortunes of a parent was left for Aurungzêbe What reason but his ambition has the rebel for assuming the empire To listen to his excuses would be to acknowledge the justice of his conduct by shewing by my weakness that I could no longer wield the scepter which he has struck from my hand"  Mahommed retired  Reflections  Though the power of Shaw Jehân had in a great measure terminated with the sickness which rouzed his sons to arms his reign may be said to have continued till Aurungzêbe mounted the throne near Delhi He held the scepter of India thirty solar years five months and two days and when he was dethroned he had arrived at the sixtyseventh year of his age The means by which Shaw Jehân obtained the empire of the Moguls were not more justifiable than those which he so much blamed in Aurungzêbe He rebelled against his father and he permitted his relations to be sacrificed to his fears When he had secured to himself the undisturbed possession of the empire he became an excellent and a humane as well as an able prince During his long reign we hear of no private assassinations no public executions no arbitrary injustice no oppression Rebellion which generally rises from tyranny was unknown universal peace was established on the undeviating justice and clemency of the emperor His government was vigorous without severity impartial dignified and sudden in its determinations He received complaints with wellweighed caution and never passed judgment till both parties were heard His pervading eye travelled to the most distant corners of his empire He traced oppression to its most secret retreats and though a lover of money no sum could protect offenders from his justice Theft and robbery were by his prudent regulations eradicated from his extensive empire The governors of the provinces were directed by an edict to pay out of their private fortunes the losses of the subject in that way which were ascertained upon oath in a court of justice The sentence of the judge was a warrant for the money upon the Subas which they were forced immediately to pay otherwise they were upon complaint to the emperor turned out of their governments and severely fined  on the reign  Shaw Jehân was handsome in his person active in all the manly exercises affable and agreeable in his conversation He did not like his father descend too much from the dignity of a prince nor involve himself in an obscure distance and reserve Warm in his constitution he loved the company of women though the charms of the daughter of Asiph the mother of almost all his children kept possession of his affections during her life His learning was such as was common among the princes of the house of Timur a thorough knowledge of the Arabian and Persian languages the arts of writing and speaking with elegance and propriety the study of history of the Coran of the laws and canons of his predecessors of the art of government financiering and of the ancient usages of the empire Though eclipsed by the extraordinary abilities of Mohâbet in war he was a good general and an excellent soldier His reputation was so high in that respect that he not only kept his own dominions in peace at home but even made extensive conquests abroad Rapid in all his measures he crushed rebellion before it deserved the name for to suspect it in any man was with him to be prepared A lover of pleasure without being its slave he never neglected business for sensuality and industry wealth and commerce flourished under the certain protection and vigilance of his government Had he not fallen in some measure from the state of reason and sensibility by the rage of that cruel disorder which he inherited from his father he might have descended from the throne to his grave and have crowned his latter days with that lustre which had covered his reign But his mind was weakened by disease and his age was devoted to melancholy and misery  and character of Shaw Jehân  Shaw Jehân was upon the whole a great and if we draw a veil over his accession to the throne a good prince But we  must ascribe his cruelty in a great measure to necessity and the manners of his country Ambition among the princes of the East is joined with the stronger passion of fear Selfpreservation drives them on to desperate measures submission will not avail and they must owe their lives to their valour The throne itself is no security to the reigning prince in a country where the succession is not fixed by acknowledged and established rules Revolution and change present themselves to his imagination till assassination steps in and effectually relieves him from his terrors Shaw Jehân was not naturally cruel but he loved his own life better than the lives of his relations To murder or to be murdered was the alternative offered to him by fortune A throne or a grave terminated his prospects on either side and when we confess ourselves shocked at his inhumanity we lose half our rage in the necessity which imposed upon him the measure He made some amends for his crimes in the strict justice and clemency of his government and Hindostan was flourishing and happy till his own policy was revived by his sons  AURUNGZEBE  CHAP I  ReflectionsMisfortunes of Solimân ShekôHis flight to SerinagûrDistress irresolution and flight

longer his serious designs on the empire would from the improbability of the thing be imprudent He however covered his love of power with professions of necessity and still lamented the occasion which had burdened his head with a crown This specious conduct though too obvious in its design to deceive derived an advantage from its modest appearance and men forgot his deviations from virtue in the opinion that he was ashamed of his crimes Having subdued the passion of vanity before he gave the rein to ambition he appeared insensible of his own exaltation His humility seemed to encrease upon the throne to such a degree that even those who could not approve of his measures were at a loss to what they ought to ascribe his conduct Averse to pleasure and contemning pomp and magnificence the obvious inducements to the seizing of the scepter were  wanting to Aurungzêbe but his active mind found in its own vigour a kind of right to command mankind  Solimân  The new emperor had scarce mounted the throne near Delhi when he was alarmed with intelligence of the march of Solimân by the skirts of the northern mountains to join his father Dara at Lahore We lost sight of that prince in the midst of his mutinous army near Allahabâd The principal nobles who had attended him in his successful expedition against Suja deserted his standard at the first news of his father's defeat The confinement of Shaw Jehân deprived him of more of his followers but a number sufficient to deserve the name of an army still remained in his camp Though bold and unconcerned in action Solimân was subject to political fears The news of repeated misfortunes came daily from every quarter He became perplexed and undecisive various expedients presented themselves to his view but he could fix on none His first resolution was to return to Bengal but dubious of success against Suja with a reduced and dispirited army he dropt that design and gave himself up again to wavering schemes He had none to advise him and his own mind afforded no resource in distress When intelligence of the march of the confederate princes from Agra arrived in his camp he thought of surprising the capital and by releasing his grandfather to add the weight of that monarch's name to his declining cause He decamped but his evil stars prevailed He changed his course and directed his march to Lahore  deserted  The undecisive measures of Solimân were known to his troops They began to despise the authority of one who could not persevere in any plan All discipline became relaxed The independance of the soldier rose with his contempt of his general Regularity was lost in licentiousness confusion rapine and insolence  prevailed and the whole army instead of obeying the prince placed a merit in their not deserting his cause That intrepidity and firmness which was necessary to the occasion no longer remained in Solimân His standard had been left by those whom he thought his best friends and a melancholy distrust prevailed in his mind To correct the licence of the soldiery was to lose their support He permitted them with a vain hope of conciliating their affections to ravage the country at large But when they had loaded themselves with spoil they deserted in whole squadrons to secure their wealth as home and to avoid the doubtful chance of war  by his army  Destitute of all authority the prince moved along sullen and silent at the head of an army converted into a mob of banditti He issued out no orders under a certainty of their not being obeyed and he even looked with indifference on the gradual decline in the number of his followers Every morning presented to his eyes at a distance whole squadrons that had quitted his camp in the night There only remained at last four thousand miserable wretches who had suffered themselves to be robbed of their booty Fear and not attachment kept these round the standard of Solimân Their rapine had converted the whole country into an enemy and there was no longer any safety in desertion They however marked their march with ruin and covered their rear with the smoke of villages which they had plundered and set on fire  takes  Aurungzêbe received certain intelligence of the destructive rout of Solimân through the countries of Shinwâra and Muchlispour He detached Fidai Chan with a considerable force to interrupt his march Shaista who had been left in the government of Agra was ordered with troops by a different rout to prevent the escape of the prince by the road through which he had come He was in no condition to cope with either of those lords He turned his  march to the north and entered the almost impervious country of Serenagûr where the Ganges issues from the mountains into the plains of India Pirti Singh the Raja received the unfortunate fugitive with kindness and respect He sent his own troops to guard the passes and permitted the forces of Solimân to encamp in his valleys to recover from the fatigues of a tedious march Aurungzêbe upon receiving advices of the escape of the prince recalled Fidai to the Imperial camp and ordered Shaista to his government of Agra  refuge  Safe in the hospitality of the prince of Serinagûr Solimân remained shut up in a secluded country The mountains which protected him from the enemy prevented him from hearing of the fate of his friends He became anxious and thoughtful and discovered neither pleasure nor amusement in the rural sports pursued by others through the romantic vallies which formed the dominions of the Raja He loved to walk alone to dive into the thickest woods to mix his complaints with the murmur of torrents which falling from a thousand rocks filled the whole country with an agreeable noise One day as the prince wandered from his party he entered a narrow valley formed by one of the streams which fall headlong from the impassable mountains that environ Serinagûr In the center of the valley there stood a mound almost covered with trees through the branches of which appeared undistinctly what seemed an Indian pagod The stream divided into two surrounded the mound and appeared to have worn away the foundations of the rock on which the building stood which circumstance rendered it inaccessible on every side Solimân pleased with this romantic scene rode forward and found that what he had mistaken for a temple was a house of pleasure belonging to the Raja Thither that prince often retired with a few attendants to enjoy the company of some Cashmirian women of exquisite beauty Some of these were walking on the terrace  when Solimân approached He was struck with their persons but he instantly retired  in Serinagûr  When he returned to the residence of the Raja he mentioned his adventure to that prince His countenance was suddenly overcast and he remained for some time silent He at length said  "All my dominions have I given up to Solimân yet he has intruded upon one little valley which I reserved for myself"  Solimân excused his conduct by his ignorance but though the Raja pretended to be satisfied there appeared from that day forward a manifest change in his behaviour He became cold and distant and he was discontented and agitated when the fugitive prince came before him Jealousy however was not the cause of this alteration Aurungzêbe had applied to him through his emissaries and the honour of that prince contended with his avarice Solimân became uneasy at the doubtful gloom which hung on his countenance He encamped with his few followers at some distance from the Raja's residence and he began to watch narrowly the conduct of a prince whom he still called his protector and friend  Irresolution  When Solimân entered the mountains of Serinagûr he dispatched a messenger with the news of his misfortunes to his father Dara That prince was encamped with a considerable army on the banks of the Suttuluz When he received the letters of his son he shut himself up in his tent and gave way to melancholy reflections on his own misfortunes The imprisonment of his father was an event which as it was expected did not surprize him but the desertion of the victorious army under his son was a severe stroke to his declining fortunes H  even had conceived hopes from the presence of Solimân whose activity and fame in war might revive the drooping spirits of his party But he was  shut up within impervious mountains and the enemy had occupied all the passes Dara was left to his own resources and they failed in the distressed situation of his mind He reflected on the past with regret he looked forward to the future with fear Agitated by various passions he could six upon no determined expedient to extricate himself from misfortune and a panic began to seize his troops from the irresolute undecisiveness of his conduct  of Dara  Aurungzêbe who had his spies in the camp of Dara was no stranger to the situation of his mind To add to his panic he marched from Karnal on the fifteenth of August and directed his course toward Lahore Dara who had remained irresolute on the banks of the Suttuluz decamped upon the news of the enemy's approach with precipitation The advanced guard of Aurungzêbe passed the river without opposition and Dara sat down with his army behind the Bea on the road to Lahore to which city he himself soon after retired leaving the troops under the conduct of Daood Chan an able and experienced officer Dara had great resources in the provinces behind Lahore The governors had still remained faithful to the old emperor the revenues of the preceding year had not been paid and the prince found a considerable sum in the Imperial treasury at Lahore He soon raised twenty thousand horse and his activity had begun to change the aspect of his affairs But he had hitherto been unsuccessful and he judged of the future by the past He was disturbed by the news of the approach of a part of the army of Aurungzêbe who having constructed a bridge on the Suttuluz were on full march to the Bea  He retreats from the Bea  Daood whom Dara had left at the head of the troops on the Bea had lined the banks with artillery and thrown up entrenchments  and redoubts with a firm assurance of stopping the progress of the enemy The rainy season was now come on and he was under no apprehensions of not being able to keep the enemy for five months at bay The northern provinces might in the mean time furnish Dara with an army of hardy soldiers Mohâbet who commanded in Cabul was in his interest and he rivalled his predecessor of the same name in his abilities in war But the evil genius of Dara prevailed He sent orders to Daood to quit his post That officer was astonished he sent a remonstrance against the measure to the prince and the jealous mind of Dara suspected his fidelity Positive orders were sent Daood reluctantly obeyed The prince finding himself wrong in his suspicions repented of his conduct He flew into a violent passion against the accusers of Daood and he ordered that officer back to his post It was now too late The advanced guard of the enemy had crossed the Bea and Aurungzêbe with the main body arrived on the Suttuluz on the twentyfifth of August  Hesitates about giving battle  Dara reflecting on the folly of his past conduct and the pressure of the present time was thrown into the utmost consternation Chan Jehân who commanded the enemy had been reinforced by a body of troops and a train of artillery from the main body Daood advised the prince to give battle to confirm the courage of his troops by the defeat of a force so much inferior in point of numbers The prince was obstinate He alleged that though his army was more numerous than the enemy they were not equal to them in discipline that suddenly gathered together they had not been habituated to danger and that to engage the rebels for so he affected to call the abettors of Aurungzêbe would be to hasten the completion of their wishes by giving them an easy victory  "But Daood" continued he "I am not only unfortunate but weak Had I followed your advice and kept possession of the  Suttuluz and Bea I might have at least suspended for some months the fate of the empire But I who have been so often deceived by my brothers am become distrustful of my friends"  and slies from Lahore  Daood endeavoured to comfort the prince by observing that though the reputation of keeping a victorious enemy at bay during the rainy season might contribute to change the face of affairs yet still there were hopes That to remain at Lahore without obtaining a victory would be as improper as it appeared impossible that still they had rivers which might be defended against the whole force of Aurungzêbe and that if the prince should be pleased to blot all unworthy suspicions from his mind he himself would undertake to give him sufficient time to collect a force in the provinces beyond the Indus Dara embraced him with tears and began to retreat The army discouraged at the apparent irresolution of their commander began to fear for themselves Having lost all confidence in the abilities of the prince they saw nothing before them but distress to him and ruin to themselves They deserted in whole squadrons and the unfortunate Dara saw his numbers hourly diminishing as he advanced toward Moultân The van of the enemy under Chan Jehân hung close on the heels of the fugitive and his friends throughout the empire gave all their hopes to the wind  Several nobles submit  Aurungzêbe arriving on the Suttuluz was informed of the flight of Dara His apprehensions from that quarter vanished and he encamped for ten days on the banks of the river to refresh his army The Maraja who had given the first battle to Aurungzêbe near the city of Ugein thinking the affairs of Dara desperate came to the camp with a tender of his allegiance A number of the nobility who had hitherto remained firm to the old emperor hastened to the court of the new and prostrated themselves  at the foot of the throne Aurungzêbe received them with unconcern and told them that the season of forgiveness was past  "When Fortune" said he "hung doubtful over my arms you either abetted my enemies or waited in security for the decision of Fate concerning the empire These" pointing to his nobles "served me in my distress I reward them with my confidence but I grant you in pardoning your lives a greater favour than those I conferred on them Necessity gives me your obedience let your generosity convince me that you are sincere My enemies have dissipated the treasures of the empire and I who hope long to manage its affairs will not impoverish it by heavy exactions Your wealth is great Justice which in affairs of state follows fortune gives me a right to the whole but my moderation only claims a part"  They paid large sums to the treasury and a general indemnity passed under the seals of the empire  to Aurungzêbe  The haughty spirit of the Maraja revolted at the indignity of a cold reception He however had gone too far to recede Naturally averse to the subtle character of Aurungzêbe he had actually performed the promise which he had made to his highspirited wife after his defeat He collected an army and was about to pursue Aurungzêbe when the misfortunes of Dara began The loss of the battle near Agra staggered his allegiance he became more irresolute after the imprisonment of Shaw Jehân and the flight of Dara to Lahore threw him at the feet of the new emperor He told Aurungzêbe That being of a religion which inculcated the belief of a Providence as superintending over human affairs he was now under no doubts concerning the side on which the gods had declared themselves It were therefore continued he a kind of impiety to oppose him whom Heaven has placed on the throne Aurungzêbe pleasantly replied  "I am glad to owe to the religion what I hoped not from the love of Jesswint Singh"  Jumla arrives at court  The visier Meer Jumla who at the beginning of the rebellion had submitted to a political imprisonment in the Decan seeing the affairs of Aurungzêbe in too good a condition to demand a continuance of his double conduct broke his fictitious chains and presented himself at court The new emperor received him with every mark of honour and affection He presented him with elephants horses riches dresses and arms but of his whole fortune which to keep up appearances had been confiscated he only returned about fifty thousand roupees  "In serving the state" said Aurungzêbe "I have expended your fortune but you in serving it again may acquire another"  Jumla made no reply but seemed satisfied with his escape from the critical situation in which he had been plunged by the civil war A field soon presented itself to his abilities and his fortune was amply restored by the unabating favour of his sovereign  Aurungzêbe marches to Moultân  Intelligence arriving in the Imperial camp that Dara had taken the rout of Moultân Aurungzêbe crossed the Suttuluz on the fifth of September He advanced with rapid marches toward that city wishing to put an end to the war in the north Chan Jehân who commanded the vanguard arriving in Moultân the unfortunate prince fled toward Bicker and the mountains beyond the Indus In vain had it been remonstrated to him by his followers that he ought to have taken the rout of Cabul Mohâbet who had been always averse to Aurungzêbe was at the head of a disciplined army in that province Aids might be drawn from the western Tartary there was even a prospect of Persia's espousing the cause of Dara Soldiers of fortune men adapted by their manners and climate for the field would flock to his standard But Fortune had forsaken Dara and she was followed by Prudence Aurungzêbe when he first heard of the course of his brother's flight cried out in an ecstacy of joy  "That the war was at an end"  He  detached eight thousand horse under the conduct of Meer Baba after the fugitive and moved his camp on his return toward Agra  Cause of his return  Many causes concurred in making Aurungzêbe anxious to return to Agra The force left in that city was small and Shaista who commanded there was no great soldier The troops though silent had not yet reconciled their minds to the force used against the person of Morâd and they were in some measure shocked at the emperor's breach of faith to a friend as well as a brother Shaw Jehân though closely confined had his emissaries and friends every where Whispers concerning the unworthy usage of that great prince were carried round and heard with attention Many of the nobles raised by his favour respected him still for what he had been and the empire in general which had flourished under his government lamented the cloud which had settled on the latter end of a life of renown The Maraja was still his friend Proud and haughty beyond measure he could not forget his defeat by Aurungzêbe and he was chagrined at the cold reception which that prince had lately given to his proffered allegiance Joy Singh who had in a manner betrayed Solimân thought also that he was not well requited for his services He was still attached to Shaw Jehân whose open and manly behaviour upon every occasion he compared with advantage to the cold duplicity of his son  Preparations  Suja who first appeared in arms against Dara saw now a more dangerous enemy in another brother The loss which he had sustained against Solimân was soon recovered in the rich and populous kingdom of Bengal He saw a new could forming which was to burst upon him and he prepared himself against the storm He collected an army with his usual activity and was on the point of  taking the rout of Agra to relieve his father from confinement To deceive Aurungzêbe he had congratulated that prince on his mounting the throne at Delhi he owned his title and only solicited for a continuance of his government over Bengal The emperor was not to be deceived He saw the views of mankind in their situation and character and took professions of friendship from rivals for mere sounds He however had behaved with his usual civility to the messenger of Suja He pretended to be anxious about knowing the state of his health and he made a minute inquiry concerning his children and family  "As for a new commission to my brother" said he "it is at once unnecessary and improper I myself am but my father's vicegerent in the empire and I derive my whole power from those infirmities which have rendered THE EMPEROR unfit for the business of the state"  This answer though not satisfactory amused Suja and furnished an opportunity for Aurungzêbe to break the power of Dara and to establish his own authority  Of Suja  Suja at length threw off the mask from a subject to Aurungzêbe he became his competitor for the empire He begun his march with a numerous army accustoming them to the manoeuvres of the field as he moved His brother who expected the storm was not surprised at its approach He remained but four days at Moultân His son Mahommed was made governor of that province that of Punjâb was conferred on Chillulla He outstripped his army in expedition and on the twentyfourth of October he entered Lahore He arrived at Delhi on the twentyfirst of November and notwithstanding the pressure of his affairs in the south he celebrated his birthday in that city having entered the fortyfirst year of his age The splendid and numerous appearance of the nobility on that occasion convinced Aurungzêbe who always made judicious observations on the  behaviour of mankind that he was firmly established on the throne which he had usurped The nobles most remarkable for their penetration were the first to pay their respects they saw the abilities of the reigning prince they were no strangers to the inferiority of his brothers and they considered Fortune as only another name for Prudence Daood who had adhered hitherto to Dara forsook that prince when he took contrary to his advice the rout of Bicker He threw himself at the feet of Aurungzêbe who knowing his abilities received him with distinction and raised him to the rank of six thousand horse  Preparations of Aurungzêbe  During the few days which Aurungzêbe passed at Delhi he informed himself minutely of the force and resources of Suja That prince was more formidable than the emperor had imagined To insure success he ordered his son Mahommed to join him with the army from Moultân and he resolved to avail himself of the great parts of Jumla That lord had been sent soon after his arrival at court to settle the affairs of Chandeish and Guzerat and he was ordered to return with some of the veteran troops stationed on the southern frontiers of the empire The emperor in the mean time having arrived at Agra reinforced the garrison of that city under Shaista being apprehensive of an invasion under prince Solimân from the mountains of Serinagûr He himself took immediately the field and moved slowly down the Jumna in hourly expectations of reinforcements from the north and west  Suja on full march  Suja in the mean time with a numerous army was in full march toward the capital He arrived at Allahabâd and having remained a few days in the environs of that place he renewed his march and encamped his army in a strong position at a place called Kidgwâ about thirty miles from Allahabâd Distrustful  of the discipline of his army he entrenched himself and waited for the arrival of Aurungzêbe whom he wished to engage with an advantage which might supply the inferiority of his troops in point of courage and hardiness But Aurungzêbe studiously protracted the time His march was designedly slow till he was joined by his son Mahommed with the troops of the north He then moved forward with great expedition Mahommed commanding the van consisting of five thousand chosen horse Suja was astonished at this sudden vigour in his brother's measures he began to fortify his camp and to make dispositions for receiving the enemy with warmth  Fortifies his camp  The prince Mahommed naturally full of fire exceeded his orders He pressed onward with the van eager for a sight of the enemy and when he presented himself before Suja the emperor with the army and artillery was forty miles in the rear He rode along the lines of the enemy and with unpardonable rashness seemed to provoke them to battle Suja however for what cause is uncertain took no advantage of his temerity The prince at length encamped his small army and dispatched a messenger with his observations on the position and strength of the enemy Aurungzêbe was offended at the rashness of his son He was however gentle in his reproof  "When you shall possess the empire Mahommed" said he "you must protect it with more caution A monarch ought to be a general rather than a partizan and few forget folly in valour"  The haughty spirit of the prince was impatient of rebuke Active gallant and siery he despised the slow dictates of Prudence and would rather owe his fame to his sword than to political management and address  Aurungzêbe  sters battle  The Imperial standard came in sight on the thirteenth of January and Aurungzêbe encamped his army leaving an  extensive plain very sit for a battle between him and the lines of Suja He drew up his army on the morning of the fifteenth in two lines advancing his artillery some paces in the front About twelve o'clock the cannon began to open on both sides Suja had placed his artillery on a risingground and his batteries were well served He scoured the enemy's lines and Aurungzêbe who durst not attack the trenches was obliged to return with some loss to his camp Suja took no advantage of the retreat of his brother He retired within his lines and imprudently neglected to keep possession of the risingground on the right from which his artillery had played with such advantage on the enemy Meer Jumla who had arrived a few days before from the Decan observed the negligence of Suja He represented the advantage which Fortune had offered to Aurungzêbe and that prince ordered him to take possession of the hill in the night Before morning appeared Jumla threw up a redoubt on the place and lined it with cannon which were covered with a strong party of spearmen  The battle begins  When daylight appeared Jumla ordered his battery on the hill to open The tents of Suja were in the range of the shot and the prince was obliged immediately to strike them and to move his quarters to the left Aurungzêbe who perceived the commotion in the enemy's camp on account of the unexpected fire from the battery thought this a proper opportunity to make a general assault His army were already formed and he ordered his elephants to advance with all expedition to tread down the entrenchments A strong body of cavalry sustained the charge The defendants already in confusion made but a faint resistance The elephants soon levelled the entrenchment and the horse poured into the camp Flight confusion and slaughter prevailed Aurungzêbe mounted on a lofty elephant  saw the appearance of victory on every side He pushed forward into the center to render complete the advantage which he had already obtained But Fortune took a sudden change and inevitable ruin seemed to overwhelm him and his affairs  Treachery of the Maraja  The Maraja Jesswint Singh having made his peace with Aurungzêbe had joined that prince with his native troops His defeat at Ugein remained still fresh in his mind and he longed to recover the laurels which he had lost in that unfortunate field He had received orders to advance with his Rajaputs and he even made a shew of attacking the enemy But when he saw the emperor entering their camp he suddenly turned and fled with all his forces The Moguls however followed not his example Aurungzêbe carried forward on his elephant the Imperial standard and they were ashamed to leave it to the enemy Jesswint disappointed in his aim of drawing his party to flight by his own fell suddenly on the rear of the line He seized upon the baggage and put servants and women to the sword without either distinction or mercy The noise of the slaughter behind was carried to the front which was engaged with Suja in the center of his camp Some fled to save their wives and cowards wanting only an example they were sollowed by thousands The lines began to thin apace the attack was sustained with less vigour and the enemy acquired courage  Resolution of Suja  Aurungzêbe exhibited upon the occasion that resolute firmness which always rises above misfortune To fly was certain ruin to remain an almost certain death He sat aloft on his elephant in full possession of his own mind and he seemed not to know that any disaster had happened in the rear The enemy who had been tumultuously hurrying out of the camp returned with  vigour to the charge upon the sudden change in the face of affairs Suja with an undaunted countenance led the attack standing in the castle upon an enormous elephant When his eye fell upon his brother he ordered his driver to direct the furious animal that way One of the principal officers of Aurungzêbe who was also mounted on an elephant perceiving the intention of Suja rushed in before the prince He was overthrown in the first shock but the elephant of Suja suffered so much in the concussion that the animal stood trembling through every joint having lost all sense of command and almost the power of motion The disappointed prince seemed enraged at his fortune but the elephant of one of his nobles advanced against that of the emperor and in the first shock the latter animal fell upon his knees and it was with great difficulty he recovered himself Aurungzêbe had one foot out of the castle ready to alight The crown of India hovered on the resolution of a moment Meer Jumla was near on horseback  "Stop" said he turning sternly to Aurungzêbe "you descend from the throne"  The emperor who was now composed seemed to smile at the reproof Whilst the animals continued to engage the marksman who sat behind him shot the adversary's driver but the enraged elephant continued notwithstanding to sight Aurungzêbe was now in imminent danger when he was delivered from destruction by the resolution of his driver He threw himself dexterously on the neck of the other elephant and carried him off whilst his own place was supplied by one of the officers who sat behind the castle Another elephant in the mean time advanced against Aurungzêbe but he had the good fortune to shoot the driver with his own hand  and of Aurungzêbe  The emperor now found that his own elephant from the many shocks which he had received was much weakened and  dispirited He began to be afraid that he could not even keep the animal in the field To alight would be equal to flight itself The elephant began to turn and Aurungzêbe whose resolution never failed him in desperate situations ordered the chains which are always ready for binding him to be locked round his feet The emperor remained immoveable amidst the enemy a thousand shot were aimed at him a thousand arrows fell into the castle but being in complete armour he remained unhurt Some of the nobles observing this daring behaviour in their prince rushed forward to his rescue They bore all before them in this last effort and Suja in the moment of victory was beginning to give way His elephant disabled by the first shock was not to be moved forward Aliverdi one of his friends came with a horse and Suja in an evil hour deseended from his lofty seat The same conduct had ruined Dara The elephant returning to the rear with an empty castle the army thought that the prince was slain and they began to fly on every side  who obtains the victory  Aurungzêbe who owed his victory to his own intrepidity was in no condition to pursue the enemy Night was now coming on and he lay on the field under arms During the action the Maraja had defeated the party left to defend the baggage and loading camels with the booty sent them off under an escort He himself still hovered round the rear The proximity of the Imperial tents to the line had hitherto protected them from being plundered by the Rajaputs Night coming on the Maraja advanced and about an hour after it was dark fell upon the tents of Mahommed who had remained with his sather on the sield A few who defended the quarter of the prince were cut off to a man and the Rajaputs advanced to the Imperial tents and seized upon every thing valuable within the square putting every one that opposed them to the sword The night became a scene of  horror confusion and death Aurungzêbe was not to be moved from the field but he detached a part of the army to oppose the Maraja When day appeared the troops of Suja were no more to be seen and the emperor now convinced of his victory turned his arms upon the Maraja That prince stood his ground A bloody battle ensued The Rajaputs retreated but they carried their booty away  Suja pursued by Mahommed  Suja fled with so much precipitation in the night that he left all his tents equipage and artillery on the field His army deserted him and he even deserted his army He changed his clothes he threw off every mark of distinction and hurried forward to Patna like a private man He feared no enemy but he was afraid of his friends When Fortune had forsaken him he hoped not to retain their faith for to deliver him to Aurungzêbe would not only procure their safety but advance their interest The sun was scarce up when Aurungzêbe detached ten thousand horse under his son Mahommed in pursuit of his brother The enemy were so much dissipated that sew were slain The instructions of the prince were to follow Suja He arrived at Patna and the unfortunate prince sled to Mongeer hoping to derive from walls that safety which he could not command in the field His courage however forsook him not in his distress He had still resources in his own active mind and the whole province of Bengal was devoted to his interest from the strict justice and mildness of his government  Aurungzêbe's speech to his nobles  After the flight of the Maraja and the departure of Mahommed the emperor called together the nobility and principal officers of his army He had marked from his elephant the particular behaviour of each He punished some for cowardice others he promoted for valour His reproofs were strong and  pointed the praise he bestowed manly and just He at the same time made a long speech from the throne He assumed no merit to himself he even gave up that of his army and attributed his success to Providence He involved Heaven in his quarrel with his brothers and made it the partner of his own guilt This religious oration was received with bursts of applause Mankind are in all ages and nations superstitious and the bare profession of sancity hides the blackest crimes from their eyes Aurungzêbe however did not forget his temporal affairs in his devotion Anxious for the reduction of Bengal and for an end of the war with Suja he detached a large body of horse under Meer Jumla to reinforce Mahommed whilst he himself took the rout of the capital  A false report carried to Agra  The Maraja in the mean time with his booty advanced to the walls of Agra News of the defeat of Aurungzêbe had already filled that capital with surprize The appearance of the Rajaputs confirmed the report The adherents of the new emperor began to shift for themselves and grief and joy prevailed as men were variously affected to this or the other side Shaista who commanded in the city was struck with melancholy and despair He knew the active part which he himself had taken for Aurungzêbe and he could expect no favour from the conquerors He even made attempts against his own life and seemed indifferent about shutting the gates of the citadel against Jesswint Singh That prince though he suffered little in the running fight with Aurungzêbe was still afraid of the Imperial army which followed close on his heels Had he boldly entered the city taken advantage of the panic of Shaista and released Shaw Jehân Aurungzêbe might still be ruined But the fortune of that prince was still greater than his abilities  Aurungzêbe arrives in that city  Aurungzêbe apprehensive of some mischief in Agra hastened his march to that capital The city was now undeceived with regard to the battle and the Maraja who had boasted of the defeat of the emperor began to fly before him He directed his course to his own country and though incumbered with spoil outstripped his pursuers in the march Aurungzêbe entered Agra without any pomp He did not permit himself to be saluted by the guns of the fort  "It would be improper" said he "to triumph in the ears of a father over the defeat of his son"  He wrote a letter to Shaw Jehân enquiring concerning his health and he excused himself from coming into his presence on account of the hurry of public affairs He slightly mentioned his victory by insinuating that Providence by his hands had frustrated the designs of the enemies of the house of Timur His father who was no stranger to the situation of affairs would not read the letter He gave it back to the messenger and said  "If my son means to insult me to know it would but add to my misfortunes if he treats me with affection and respect why does he permit me to languish within these walls"  CHAP II  Dara's flight to BickerHe crosses the desertGains the governor of GuzeratMarches toward

Imperialists were close at his heels His army fell off gradually in his flight His affairs were desperate and their attachment gave way to personal safety Four thousand still adhered to their colours with which number Dara encamped near Bicker having garrisoned the place and submitted it to the command of a faithful friend He had scarce pitched his tents when the enemy came in sight Though wornout with fatigue he was obliged to fly He found boats by accident and crossed the Indus with all his followers On the opposite shore stood the strong fortress of Sicar Struck with the hard fate of Dara the governor opened the gates But it was not the business of the prince to shut himself up within walls which at best could only protract misfortune He reinforced the garrison with a part of his troops and left some valuable effects under the protection of the governor  Meditates to retire to Persia  Disincumbered he betook himself to the open field before he had even thought of the quarter to which he should direct his course He wandered away in a melancholy mood His faithful adherents for only those whose attachment to his person overcame their own fears were now in his train followed silently the path of a master whom they loved Having marched a few miles the prince came to the place where the road parted into two the one leading to Tatta the other toward the Persian province of Chorassan Starting from his reverie he stood for some time irresolute On the one side there was apparent ruin on the other a certainty of personal safety But glory was blended with disgrace in the first in the latter there was nothing but obscurity and dishonour When he weighed these things in his mind the chariots in which were his women arrived His perplexity increased The desart toward Persia was extensive and unhospitable on the side of India his own misfortunes must overwhelm his family He could not decide and a melancholy silence prevailed around  but changes his course to Tatta  The favourite Sultana seeing the undecisiveness of Dara at length put an end to his doubts  "Can the first of the race of Timur" she said "hesitate in this moment of distress There is danger but there may be also a throne on one side but a frightful solitude and the cold reception given to fugitive princes by strangers threaten from the other If Dara cannot decide I who am the daughter of Purvêz will decide for myself This hand shall prevent me by death from dishonour The descendant of the immortal Timur shall not grace the haram of the race of Sheick Sesi"  The features of the prince were at once lighted up into a kind of mournful joy He burst into tears and without uttering a word spurred forward his horse toward Tatta He had not remained many days in that city when he  received advices that a considerable detachment of the enemy was arrived within a few miles of the place He evacuated Tatta crossed the Indus and fled toward the capital of Guzerat The enemy laid a bridge of boats over the river and were preparing to pursue the fugitive when unexpected orders arrived for them to repair with all expedition to join the Imperial army in full march against Suja  Crosses the desart  The removal of the Imperial troops procured a happy respite for Dara but it was but a transient gleam of Fortune who had resolved to continue her frowns The road of the prince lay partly through burning sands destitute of water partly through abrupt mountains covered with impervious woods the haunts of beasts of prey His people were parched with thirst his very camels died of fatigue His unfortunate women were just expiring for want of water when the prince who ranged the solitudes far and wide lighted on a spring He encamped near it and having refreshed his attendants arrived next day on the borders of the territories of the Raja's Jâm and Bahâra which lay contiguous to each other in his rout They received him with hospitality but they declined to embrace his cause They were the natural enemies of the house of Timur who had often from views of conquest penetrated into their almost inaccessible country When persuasion failed Dara endeavoured to work upon the pride of Jâm He proposed an alliance between his son Sipper Shekô the constant attendant of his misfortunes and the daughter of the Raja The match did not take place The few Mogul nobles who adhered to him were so much dissatisfied with the proposal on account of its inequality that it was laid aside and Dara proceeded to Ahmedabâd  and arrives in Guzerat  Shaw Nawâz whose two daughters were married to Aurungzêbe and Morâd had been left by the latter in the government of Guzerat and kept his residence in Ahmedabâd When Morâd was seized Aurungzêbe sent a new commission to Shaw Nawâz which that lord received and governed his province in the name of the new emperor He prepared to oppose Dara with all his forces The match was unequal and the prince hemmed in with misfortunes on every side began to despair He however resolved to carry no longer round the empire a life obnoxious to misery He advanced with his few attendants and as the last resort wrote a letter to the younger daughter of Shaw Nawâz who was the wife of Morâd and had been left with her father when the prince marched toward Agra He recounted his own misfortunes and compared them with those of her husband  "The enemy of both is one" said he "if the memory of the unfortunate Morâd still lives in the breast of his wife she will persuade her father to favour Dara who is oppressed by the same untoward fate"  Gains over the governor  The princess who had mourned incessantly for the misfortunes of her lord whom she loved to distraction burst into a flood of tears at the reception of the letter She grasped at the shadow of hope for her husband's releasement which was offered by a prince overwhelmed by his own bad fortune She threw herself at the feet of her father her tears suppressed her voice but she looked up to him with that forcible eloquence of eyes which it is impossible to resist from beauty in distress She placed the letter of Dara in his hands He read it with emotion and turned away in silence She followed him on her knees holding the skirt of his robe  "Is not my daughter" said he "already sufficiently wretched Why does she wish to involve her father in the irretrievable misery which has overtaken her lord  But she will have it soand prudence must give way to pity"  He ordered the gates to be thrown open and the princess in an ecstasy of joy sent accounts of her success to Dara  Raises an army  The prince could scarce believe his own eyes when he received the letter of the wife of Morâd A gleam of hope came in upon his misfortunes He entered Ahmedabâd and the governor received him with the highest distinction and respect He gave to the prince about one hundred and twenty thousand pounds in money together with jewels to a great amount to contribute to raise troops This new life to the affairs of Dara rendered him active in his preparations for war In a few weeks he found himself at the head of a considerable army He in the mean time received letters from the Maraja who with his native troops was on his march with Aurungzêbe to attack Suja That prince acquainted him of his design of deserting the new emperor in the action and we have already seen that he kept his promise He conjured Dara to hasten his march to support him in his intended defection The advice was good but the evil genius of Dara prevailed He delayed that he might augment his forces and lost the golden opportunity of restoring his affairs by an act of boldness and intrepidity Suja was in the mean time defeated and Aurungzêbe turned his whole force toward the strom which was brewing in the West  Marches toward Agra  The desertion of the Maraja had spread news of the defeat and death of Aurungzêbe to every corner of the empire The agreeable intelligence came to Dara He instantly marched toward Agra to seize the capital before the arrival of Suja who was said to have conquered In three days the unfortunate prince was undeceived Letters from different quarters brought him the particulars of the action and of the complete victory obtained by  his greatest foe He was again thrown into perplexity To proceed with so small a force was imprudent to retreat ruinous to his reputation He had built his last hopes on his army to retire was to lose them by desertion Many Europeans were in his camp He had gained them by large promises and they naturally loved that impartiality which he shewed indiscriminately to men of merit of all nations His artillery was upon the best footing and he was not destitute of able engineers His soldiers for the most part consisting of the troops of the empire stationed on the frontiers were habituated to action But they were too few in number and their leader was destined for misfortune  Turns toward the dominions of the Maraja  The Maraja after plundering the Imperial camp declared his intentions of marching to Guzerat with the spoil Dara halted to take him up by his way But the Indian had no serious intentions of assisting effectually any branch of the house of Timur An enthusiast in his own religion he considered all Mahommedans as his natural enemies He abetted none of the princes through choice He studied to add fuel to the flame which raged between them and to derive advantage from their dissentions He hoped to find that freedom and independence in their weakness which he could never expect from their favour and power Under the influence of these political principles he studiously avoided to meet Dara He took the rout of Marwâr to lodge his booty in his own dominions in safety He however wrote letters to the prince to advance to his borders where he would join him with a recruited army Dara accordingly marched toward Meirta at which place he encamped with his forces in daily expectations of the junction of the Maraja who was collecting his forces at the capital of his dominions  who is gained over by Aurungzêbe  Aurungzêbe was in the mean time alarmed at the great preparations of the Maraja He saw danger in his defection and he had recourse to his usual art and address He wrote to him a letter He acquainted him That the opposition given to his fortune at the battle of Ugein had long since been blotted out of his memory as it was the result of the Maraja's opinion in favour of Dara that his submission to his government while yet his brothers were in the field was a conduct which entitled him to favour but that his late desertion in battle and his subsequent attack upon the Imperial baggage could not be forgot though it might be forgiven  "The love of public tranquillity however" continues Aurungzêbe "has expelled from my breast every wish of revenge It is therefore your interest to withdraw your foot from the circle of Dara's misfortunes That you should join my standard I neither expect nor wish I cannot trust again your faith and my own force is sufficient to overthrow my enemies You may therefore look from your own country an unconcerned spectator of the war and to reward you for your neutrality the government of Guzerat shall be added to that of your hereditary dominions"  and deserts Dara  The letter had the intended effect on the Maraja He preferred the proffered advantage to the gratitude of Dara whose fortunes wore such a doubtful aspect He broke off his correspondence with that prince at the very time that he was buoyed up with the hopes of the junction of a great army with his own forces A stranger to the motive of the Hindoo he sent his son Sipper Shekô to endeavour to prevail upon him to throw off his inactivity The young prince was received at his capital with distinction and hospitality He was however disappointed in his views The Maraja would give no satisfactory answer and the prince returned to his father who was  greatly disconcerted by this new misfortune He however resolved to hesitate no longer with his fate He decamped and marched in a direct line for Agra and arrived at Ajmere about eight days journey from that capital  Dara fortisies  In the neighbourhood of Ajmere the highroad to the capital passes between two steep hills each of which forms the point of an impassable ridge of mountains which stretch far into the country on both sides and separate the kingdom of Guzerat from the rest of Hindostan Dara halted with his army in this pass His high opinion of the European mode of war which he imbibed from the English French and Portuguese in his service had rendered that prince fond of entrenchments He had considered the appearance of security more than the movements of the human mind for armies often take entrenchments in no other light than as a proof of the superiority of the enemy He threw up lines from hill to hill in his front and strengthened them with artillery Aurungzêbe in the mean time marched with an army to stop his progress and arrived with great expedition in the neighbourhood of Ajmere When he came in sight of the entrenchments he ordered his army to encamp and he himself rode out to reconnoitre the enemy  himself at Ajmere  Nothing could equal his astonishment when he viewed through a spyglass the position of his brother The strength of the works was inconceivable instead of a common entrenchment the prince had fortified himself with a strong rampire defended by bastions a deep ditch and a double row of palisadoes which extended six miles across a valley Aurungzêbe was perplexed beyond measure He knew not how to act An assault was evidently impracticable to do nothing would derogate from that high opinion which he had already established in the minds of the people Every day would add to Dara's influence  and party and mankind who always side with the unfortunate would attribute to ability what was the gift of chance He called a council of the nobles They differed in their opinions much time was spent in argument without coming to a decisive measure They at last agreed upon an expedient They knew that the spirit of Dara was impatient of insult and they advised the emperor to draw out his forces and to offer battle  Aurungzêbe of  ers battle  In compliance with the advice of his nobles he formed his line on the d of March and advanced with his artillery within cannonshot of the camp Dara continued within his lines and Aurungzêbe began to fortify himself under the enemy's fire He continued the work the whole night and covered his men before daylight appeared notwithstanding his brother had sallied thrice during that time The sun was scarce risen when Debere and some other nobles issued out of the camp and advanced on full speed with five thousand horse near the lines hoping by insulting him to draw Dara from his lines They paid dear for their temerity The artillery of the enemy being well served galled the assailants so much that they retreated in disorder and were glad to shelter themselves behind their own lines Things remained in this doubtful situation for several days The army of Dara having the country in their rear open were in no want of provisions and were therefore under no necessity of retreating and it was impossible without a long siege to overcome their almost impregnable lines  His stratagem  Fortune who never forsook Aurungzêbe relieved his anxiety upon this occasion A petty Indian prince who commanded three thousand of his native infantry in the Imperial army informed himself of a narrow and steep path by which men accustomed to climb might ascend the mountain on the right of Dara's lines He communicated his information to the emperor who was overjoyed  at the discovery He made large promises to the Raja should he gain with a party the summit of the mountain without alarming the enemy Should he be so fortunate as to succeed in the attempt he was ordered to make a signal to the emperor from that side of the mountain which was covered from Dara When night came on he marched with his troops Having encountered many difficulties he ascended the mountain and the appointed signal was ready to be shewn by the dawn of day  to deceive  Aurungzêbe never rested his hopes upon the success of a single scheme He had during the night planned the ruin of his brother's affairs by a more fatal stroke of policy than the stratagem of the Raja Debere Chan and the Indian prince Joy Singh had at the beginning of the war adhered with warmth to the interests of Dara Under the prince Solimân they had distinguished themselves in the defeat of Suja and the reduction of Bengal Yielding to the pressure of the times and to the intrigues of Aurungzêbe they deserted as has been already related the colours of Solimân and ruined all the hopes which the unfortunate Dara derived from the victorious army under his son To these chiefs the emperor applied with much address He promised largely and he mixed threats with his proffered favour He at length prevailed upon them to write an insidious letter to Dara to the following purpose  Dara  "It is not unknown to the emperor" for with that title they affected to distinguish Dara "that Debere and Joy Singh once deemed it their greatest glory to be numbered among his servants With how much fidelity they obeyed his orders they derive a proof from their actions under the command of the illustrious prince Solimân Shekô So much satisfied was Dara with the conduct of his faithful servants that in his letters which were  presented to us by the prince he attributed the victory over Suja to our conduct and valour The emperor was partial in our favour but we presume to hope we deserved a part of his praise When the news of the defeat of our prince and of the imprisonment of the king of kings came to our ears we thought ourselves alone amidst the victorious armies of our foes What could we do Our loyalty remained but necessity was near The times left us no choice and we were forced to submit We have ever since been dragged along the unwilling slaves of Aurungzêbe But now Fortune has returned to the threshold which leads to the presence of Dara The accession of his faithful servants to his power though not necessary to his affairs will bring them to a more speedy conclusion When therefore daylight shall appear let the gate of the camp be opened to receive us that we may have an opportunity of regaining by our merit the favour of which we have been deprived by necessity As soon as the sun shall arise we look for admittance into the camp with all our followers and friends"  Succeeds  This letter was thrown into the lines by a horseman on full speed It was immediately carried to the prince and with that credulity which is inherent in a sincere mind he implicitly believed every thing which the letter contained Shaw Nawâz in vain remonstrated to him in the strongest terms that there was danger in considing in their sincerity Dara was always averse to advice and now he was rendered blind by the hopes of gaining such powerful chiefs to his party He was obstinate and determined to risque all on the faith of men who had a few months before betrayed his son He gave positive orders that in the morning that gate of the camp which looked toward the enemy should be thrown open to receive the expected fugitives He at the same time issued directions to all the officers  that care should be taken not to fire upon them as they advanced Shaw Nawâz was highly dissatisfied Mahommed Sherif who commanded the forces was astonished The orders were peremptory and they must be obeyed They however resolved to stand upon their guard and when morning came they posted themselves with several squadrons without the lines giving orders at the same time that all the troops in the camp should stand to their arms  against  Aurungzêbe who was no stranger to the character of Dara foresaw that his stratagem would succeed He drew up his army before day behind his own camp being covered by the tents from the enemy's view The sun was not yet up when he ordered Debere to issue forth from his right and Joy Singh from his left at the head of their troops and to advance on full speed toward the camp These officers accordingly rushed forth and Aurungzêbe to carry on the deceit began to fire with his artillery but with powder only on the pretended deserters Dara full of expectation stood on the rampire When he saw the squadrons advancing he ordered the gate to be thrown open but Mahommed Sherif who with a chosen body stood without the lines being still dubious of the intentions of the fugitives ordered them to stop till he should be satisfied of their real designs  that prince  Debere who first advanced had no time to deliberate A parley would discover the whole to his own men he immediately stopt short and gave the signal of attack by shooting Sherif with an arrow through the heart That officer fell headlong to the ground and a dreadful slaughter commenced hand to hand Debere unmatched in that age for strength and personal bravery hewed on his way to the gate which Shaw Nawâz was endeavouring to shut But the thing was now impracticable from the  numbers that crowded into the camp Debere entered sword in hand and Shaw Nawâz advanced to oppose him The match was unequal Debere who respected the virtues the years the high quality of his adversary desired him to surrender and to fear nothing from his soninlaw  "I myself" said Debere "will intercede for Shaw Nawâz"  The pride of the old lord arose  "NoDebere ChanI have hitherto defended my life by my valour nor shall I purchase a few years of decrepid age at the expence of my former fame"  Debere at the word ran him through with his spear With Shaw Nawâz and Sherif the courage of Dara's army fell The treacherous Debere was now within the camp with his squadron who fired with the example of their leader made a prodigious slaughter Joy Singh followed close on their heels  who is torally defeated  The emperor in the mean time advanced with his whole line and the party who had gained the summit of the mountain in the night shewed themselves above the camp The hills reechoed to their shouts and they began to roll stones and loosened rocks into the valley These falling from precipice to precipice came crashing down on the affrighted army and they turned their eyes from the swords of their enemies to this new species of danger An universal panic spread over all Confusion every where prevailed Some fought others fled many stood in astonishment without having even the courage to fly Dara mounted his elephant to be seen by his army but he himself saw nothing around but terror and death He rushed forward to meet the enemy but he was left alone He called for Sherif that chief was already cold in his blood he wished for the presence of Shaw Nawâz but his dead body presented itself to his eyes He turned back and gave his soul to despair The safety of his women came then across his mind he hastened with them from the field  whilst the spoils of his camp kept the enemy from pursuing his flight Four thousand fell on the side of Dara in this extraordinary action Aurungzêbe lost not above two hundred and in that number no officer of distinction except Sheich Meer the captaingeneral of his forces  The misfortunes of Dara  The grief of Dara for his defeat was great but it was not equal to his astonishment The misfortune though dreadful was unexpected and by the sudden ill prevented the fear It was however succeeded by misery and unequalled distress The unfortunate prince fled to the capital of Guzerat But the governor  hom he left in the place shut the gates against his lord He sat down in silence and knew not whither to fly His friends became his greatest enemies Two thousand Mahrattors still adhered to the unhappy prince When they heard of the message of the governor they despaired of the affairs of Dara and added their own cruelty to his misfortunes In a pretence of having large arrears of their pay due to them they fell upon his baggage and plundered it in his presence Some caskets of jewels were saved by his women for even in that season of licence and disorder their persons were sacred from barbarity itself This outrage was committed in the night When daylight appeared the robbers as if ashamed of their conduct fled with their spoil A few only of the lowest menial servants remained Every thing was removed from the field The miserable tents which he had collected in his flight were carried away and nothing was left but a few old screens of canvass which covered the Sultana and her female slaves from the public eye The distress of the prince may be imagined but cannot be described He walked about in seeming distraction and the sad complaints of the women from behind their wretched covering drew tears from the eyes of the few servants who still adhered to their unhappy lord  Flies to the desart  The pressure of his misfortunes at length awakened Dara from a melancholy reverie in which he had strayed from the place where his camp had stood He returned in manifest disorder and seemed to question every one with his eyes about the means of moving to some place of safety A few beasts of burden were collected by his servants and the robbers who had deserted and plundered his camp had left to him the two elephants which he had brought from Ajmere On these he placed all the effects which had escaped the ravages of the Mahrattors and a few oxen found in a neighbouring field dragged slowly away in covered carriages his women The prince himself with his son Cipper Shekô attended them on horseback with an illmounted retinue of two or three hundred servants and faithful adherents He turned his face to the frightful solitudes in which he had suffered so much before but the parched desarts which stretched themselves from Guzerat to the Indus were less unhospitable to Dara than a brother's hands  His great  The prince soon arrived in the territories of Raja Jâm whose hospitality alleviated his distress He again applied to that chief for his aid but he was deaf to the request Dara promised largely should Fortune again favour his cause but she had taken her slight to return no more Jâm was too prudent to throw his own fate into the scale of the prince He became cold and reserved and seemed by his manner to wish for the departure of his unfortunate guest He was again sorced to encounter the hardships of the desart The heat of the season had added to the natural sterility of these dreadful solitudes There was no water to be found not a blade of grass to be seen The air seemed in some measure on sire There was nothing to shade the desolate travellers from the scorching sun excepting when clouds of sand raised by whirlwinds covered them with a satal darkness The  beasts of burden died for want of provender the very camels perished for want of water The favourite elephant which had often carried Dara in all his pomp was now the only useful animal that remained and even he began to fail To add to the misfortunes of the prince the favourite Sultana the mother of all his children and whom he tenderly loved was at the point of death She had been seized with hysteries from the fright of the battle and had ever since been subject to violent fits Death cut off gradually his retinue at the end of every furlong he was obliged to pay the last sad offices to some favourite servant or friend  distress  When he came within sight of Tatta the elephant which had carried his family across the desart worn out with satigue and thirst lay down and died The few that remained of his followers were so languid and spent that they could not crawl to the neighbouring villages for succour Dara himself was obliged to execute that necessary service He came to a hind who kept oxen in a field He mentioned his distress and his name and the clownfled from his presence He sat down having no strength to retur  to  is desolate family Curiosity however brought the whole village around and every eye was full of tears They brought all their beasts of burden to the place and the whole country accompanied him with shouts of joy to Tatta He however did not rest long in that city He crossed the Indus and threw himself under the protection of the petty chiefs of the district of Bicker and they touched with compassion promised to support him with their lives and fortunes  The active spirit of the emperor was not in the mean time idle So long as Dara lives he must totter on his throne He knew the rout which his unfortunate brother had taken but his troops would not pursue the fugitive through such a perilous way  He hoped that the hardships of the desart might prevent him from embruing his hands in blood but Dara must perish and Aurungzêbe was resolved to be provided against every event of Fortune He ordered some troops to march down along the Indus from Moultân and the news of their approach came a few days after the arrival of Dara The generous chiefs who from compassion had resolved to support his cause being not yet prepared to receive the enemy advised him to fly into Persia the frontiers of which were within four days march of the place at which he then resided  prepared for his flight but Nadîra Bâna the favourite Sultana was dying Spent with fatigue overwhelmed with sickness and worn out with misfortune she was altogether incapable of the journey and he could not leave her behind She knew his situation and requested earnestly that they should move away  "Death" said she "will soon relieve the daughter of Purvez from her misfortunes but let her not add to those of her lord"  She could not prevail upon him to march whilst she was in such a situation and he had besides placed great hopes in the friendship of Jihon Chan a neighbouring chief of great power Jihon had been twice saved from death by the interest of Dara Shaw Jehân who was an enemy to oppression had ordered him to be at two different times prosecuted for murder and treason before the chief justice of the empire That judge upon the clearest proofs condemned him twice to death and at the request of Dara he was pardoned by the emperor and restored to his estate which had been confiscated The prince therefore had reason to expect a return of gratitude but the obligations were too great for the pride of this unprincipled chief and they pressed upon him like injuries  but throws himself on Jihon Chan  The natural perfidy of Jihon was so notorious that all his friends with one voice remonstrated to Dara against his design of throwing himself on the faith of that chief The prince naturally obstinate was now blinded by his fate He could not think of leaving his beloved Nadîra in the hour of death and he resolved to risque all for the melancholy satisfaction of being present when the faithful companion of his distress expired Some nobles who had hitherto attended his person and who had determined to accompany him in his exile to Persia separated themselves from a prince devoted to ruin With seventy domestics only he went to the residence of Jihon and that chief apprized of his coming came out to meet him and received him with the warmest professions of friendship  June st  He quitted his own palace to accommodate the prince and nothing was to be seen around but the greatest marks of hospitality and profound respect  The Sultana dies  The distemper of the Sultana had increased on the road to the residence of Jihon She fainted away when she was carried into the apartments assigned for her reception and the prince sat in tears by her side during the whole night In the morning she expired in his arms  "It is only now" said Dara "I have found that I am alone I was not bereft of all my friends whilst Nadîra lived But she has closed her eyes on the misfortunes which are to involve her children and lord and thus a peculiar happiness has succeeded to accumulated distress"  He tore off his magnificent robe and threw the Imperial turban on the ground then clothing himself in a mean habit he lay down by his departed consort on the bed In the evening one of his faithful servants joined him with fifty horse He was overjoyed at his arrival and starting up took him in his arms and said  "My situation Gal Mahommed" for that was the officer's name "is not without resource Nadîra having forsaken the devoted Dara has met  with a part of that good fortune which was due to her virtues You must with your fifty horse escort the body to Lahore to the sepulchre of her great ancestors Aurungzêbe himself will not refuse a grave to the family of Dara"  The body was accordingly embalmed and being placed in a magnificent herse was escorted to Lahore  He is betrayed by Jihon  Dara had not remained many days at the residence of Jihon when intelligence was received that Chan Jehân one of the principal generals of his brother was advancing from Moultân and that his van was already arrived in the neighbourhood Dara resolved to make his escape into Persia He called his servants together and he took leave of Jihon When he had proceeded about a mile on his way he discovered Jihon coming after him with about a thousand horse on full speed He imagined that Jihon designed to escort him with these troops to Persia He rode back by way of doing him honour and when he was about addressing his thanks to the treacherous chief he was suddenly surrounded and disarmed  "Villain" said Dara "is it for this I twice saved your life from the resentment of my father when the elephants were standing over you waiting for orders to crush you to death But Justice will be satisfied and Heaven has revenged your crimes upon my head"  He stoptand with a scornful silence submitted his hands to be bound  and delivered up  Jihon heard the prince without making any reply for what could he say to vindicate his conduct He ordered the prisoner to be mounted on an elephant and then he fell upon the baggage to enrich himself with the spoil of his benefactor He then hastened toward Chan Jehân and during the journey notwithstanding the natural unfeelingness of his mind he durst not for once come into the presence of the much injured prince His  fate being now determined that anxiety which had long clouded the countenance of Dara vanished His son was carried with him on the same elephant Having a talent for poetry he composed many affecting verses on his own misfortunes with the repetition of which he often drew tears from the eyes of the common soldiers who guarded his person  "My name" said he one day "imports that I am IN POMP LIKE DARIUS I am also like that monarch in my fate The friends whom he trusted were more fatal than the swords of his enemy"  Notwithstanding these casual complaints he maintained his usual dignity and there was even something majestic in his grief It was not the wailings of a woman but the manly afflictions of a great mind  to the enemy  When Chan Jehân who had been apprized of the imprisonment of Dara saw that prince advancing meanly dressed on a sorry elephant he could not bear the sight and he hid his tears in his tent He detached a party from his army to escort him together with the traitor to Delhi where Aurungzêbe at the time kept his court The emperor though he rejoiced at the news that his brother had fallen into his hands was full of perplexity and indecision He called a council of his nobles and they differed in their opinions some declaring for sending him by another rout to the castle of Gualiâr some that he should be carried through the city to convince mankind that he was fallen for ever Many advised against a measure that might be full of danger from the humanity of the people a few argued that such conduct would degrade the dignity of the family of Timur Others maintained to whose opinion the emperor himself seemed to lean that it was necessary he should pass through the capital to astonish mankind with the absolute power and invincible fortune of Aurungzêbe  Carried with ignominy through Delhi  The unfortunate prince accordingly accompanied by his son entered Delhi on an elephant This says a certain writer was none of the fine elephants of Ceylon and Pegu which they were wont to ride with golden harness embroidered covers and magnificent canopies to defend them from the sun No It was an old animal dirty and lean with a tattered cover a pitiful seat and the castle open on all sides to the winds The splendid ornaments of his person were now vanished like his good fortune A dirty dress of coarse linen scarce covered his body from the weather and his wretched turban was wrapt round with a scarf made of Cashmire wool His face which formerly commanded respect with the manly regularity of its features was now parched and shrivelled by being long exposed to the heat and a few straggling locks which appeared from his turban presented a grey colour unsuitable to his years In this wretched situation he entered Delhi and when the mob who crowded to the gates knew that it was Dara they burst into loud complaints and shed a flood of tears The streets were rendered almost impassible by the number of the spectators the shops were full of persons of all ages and degrees The elephant moved slowly and the progress he made was marked to those who were distant by the advancing murmur among the people Nothing was heard around but loud complaints against Fortune and curses on Aurungzêbe But none had the boldness to offer to rescue the unfortunate prince though slightly guarded They were quite unmanned by their sorrow  Confined in a neighbouring village  After wandering over the features of Dara the eyes of the people fell on his son They opposed his innocence his youth his graceful person his hopes and his quality to the fate which impended over his head and all were dissolved in grief The infectious sorrow flew over the whole city even the poorest  people forsook their work and retired to secret corners to weep Dara retained his dignity upon this trying occasion He uttered not one word but a settled melancholy seemed to dwell on his face The unfortunate young prince was ready frequently to weep being softened by the complains of the people but his father checked him with a stern look and he endeavoured to conceal his tears Dara having been thus led through the principal streets of Delhi was conducted to Chizerabâd a village four miles without the walls He was locked up with his son in a mean apartment in which he remained for some days in hourly expectation of his death Here he amused himself with writing instructions for his son Solimân having concealed an ink standish and some paper in one of the folds of his garment His anxiety to know the intentions of Aurungzêbe sometimes broke in upon his melancholy amusements He appeared through the window to the guards but they knew nothing of what passed at court He then enquired concerning an old devotee who had formerly lived in a cell near the foot of the Imperial garden at Delhi One of the soldiers knew the old man and the prince gave a billet to be carried to him requesting some intelligence  "But even he perhaps" he said with a sigh "may have changed with the current of the times"  The traitor Jihon slain by the people  The traitor Jihon in the mean time made his appearance at court to claim the reward of his treachery Aurungzêbe dignified him with a title and enriched him with presents Passing through the city of Delhi he was pointed out to the mob who falling upon him near the gate which leads to Lahore killed seven of his attendants He himself escaped but the country people rose upon him every where They hunted him from place to place till at length he met with his deserts and was slain when he had almost reached the boundaries of his own government  The zeal of the people however proved fatal to Dara The emperor hearing of the tumult near the gate of Lahore ordered the chief magistrate of the city with his officers to go to the place and enquire into the cause of the disturbance The mob fell upon the judge and his attendants They fled to the palace and the whole city was in an uproar  Disturbances at Delhi  Aurungzêbe in dead of a general revolt called a council of his nobles He had determined before to send his brother to the fortress of Gualiâr but now he was afraid of a rescue by the way The minds of the people were strangely agitated Their imprecations against his cruelty reached him in the midst of his guards and he began for the first time to shew symptoms of political fear He asked the advice of his lords The majority seemed to be for sparing the life of Dara and for sending him under a strong guard to the usual prison of the Imperial family Aurungzêbe though not satisfied was about to yield to their opinion when one Hakîm a Persian by birth with a design to gain the favour of the emperor insisted that Dara should be put to death as an apostate from the faith of Mahommed The emperor pretended to be startled and said  "The thing is determined I might have forgiven injuries done to myself but those against religion I cannot forgive"  He immediately ordered a warrant to be issued to Nazir and Seif two fierce Afgan chiefs which impowered them to take off Dara that very night  asten the murder of Dara  On the eleventh of September about midnight the unfortunate prince was alarmed with the noise of arms coming through the passage which led to his apartment He started up and knew immediately that his death approached He scarce had awakened his son who lay asleep on the carpet at his seet when the assassins burst open the door Dara seized a knife  which he had concealed to mend the reed with which he wrote He stood in a corner of the room The murderers did not immediately attack him They ordered his son to remove to the adjoining apartment but he clung round his father's knees Two of the assassins seized him to force him away when Dara seeing Nazir standing at the door begged to be indulged a few moments to take leave of his son He fell upon his neck and said  "My dear son this separation is more afflicting than that between soul and body which I am this moment to suffer But should HE spare youlive Heaven may preserve you to revenge my death for his crimes shall not pass unpunished I leave you to the protection of God My son remember me"  A tear half started from his eye when they were dragging the youth to the adjoining room He however resumed his wonted dignity and courage  "I beg one other favour Nazir" he said "much time has not been lost by the last"  He wrote a billet and desired that it should be delivered to Aurungzêbe But he took it back and tore it saying  "I have not been accustomed to ask favours of my enemies He that murders the father can have no compassion on the son"  He then raised up his eyes in silence and the assassins seemed to have forgot their office  who is assissinated  During this time of dreadful suspence the son who lay bound in the next room listened expecting every moment to hear his father's dying groans The assassins in the mean time urged on by Nazir seized Dara by the hands and feet and throwing him on the ground prepared to strangle him Deeming this an infamous death he with an essort disincumbered his hand and stabbed with his penknife one of the villains to the heart The others terrified fled back but as he was rising from the floor they fell upon him with their swords His son hearing the noise though his hands were bound burst open the door and  entered when the murderers were severing his father's head from his body Nazir had the humanity to push back the youth into the other apartment till this horrid operation was performed The head of Dara was carried to Aurungzêbe and the unfortunate young prince was left during the remaining part of the night shut up with his father's body Next morning he was sent privately under a guard to the castle of Gualiâr  Reflections  Thus fell the unhappy Dara Shekô a prince whose virtues deserved a better fate But he was born to distress and his imprudence often assisted the malignity of his fortune Though destitute of the address which is necessary to gain mankind in general he was much beloved by his family and domestics and he was the darling of his father who was often heard to say That all his other children were not half so dear to him as Dara This predilection in his favour was the source of the misfortunes of both The other princes envied the influence of Dara and all their differences with and every disappointment which they experienced from their father was laid to the account of their brother who possessed all his confidence and esteem Dara was certainly jealous of his brothers whom he saw invested with too much power in their respective provinces and his opposing their measures at court was the natural consequence of his fears This mutual animosity being once kindled all the princes looked forward to the death of their father with terror The seeds of civil war were long sown before they appeared and the illness of the emperor was the signal to begin the charge from the four corners of his dominions Dara had the post of advantage but he was not a match in abilities to Aurungzébe  on his death  Nazir before daylight appeared was admitted into the citadel to the emperor That prince had remained all night in anxious expectation Many of the nobles had expressed their high dissatisfaction  at the measure of putting Dara to death and he was afraid that the resolution before it took effect might be communicated to the people and army He saw that he was supported only by his own abilities and the venality of his followers The unbiassed by either interest or fear looked with horror on the crimes which his ambition had already committed They were disgusted at his cruelty to his father and his injustice to his brothers and they with indignation saw hypocrisy and the worst kind of ambition lurking behind professions of religion and moderation Nazir however relieved him of a part of his fears The head of Dara being disfigured with blood he ordered it to be thrown into a charger of water and when he had wiped it with his handkerchief he recognized the features of his brother He is said to have exclaimed  "Alas unfortunate man"  and then to have shed some tears  CHAP III  War against SujaHe is driven from Mongeerand

fears of the emperor from the most formidable of his rivals were extinguished with the life of Dara The silence which accompanies the decisions of despotism is an effectual prevention of tumult and confusion The people for some days were strangers to the death of the prince and his prior misfortunes had even lessened the regret which his murder might have otherwise created in the minds of mankind Misery had risen to its height and the worst period it could have was in some degree fortunate The conduct of the emperor contributed to obliterate his crimes With an appearance of humanity and benevolence in the common operations of government men were apt to attribute the instances of cruelty which he exhibited to the necessity of his situation and they forgot the evils done to individuals in the general good of the whole Should selfpreservation be admitted  as an excuse for the commission of bad actions Aurungzêbe was not without apology He had gone too far not to go farther still he had deposed his father he had excluded his brother from the throne and a flame had been kindled which could be extinguished by nothing but blood  Preparations of Suja  During the misfortunes of Dara in the west and north the war was carried on with vigour in Bengal against Suja That prince having after the unfortunate battle of Kidgwâ escaped to Mongeer was active in making new preparations for the field Naturally bold and intrepid misfortune had no effect upon him but to redouble his diligence to retrieve it and he wanted not resources in his province for recommencing hostilities with an appearance of being able for some time to ward off the hand of Fate which seemed to hang over his head His first care was to collect the remains of his dissipated army in the neighbourhood of Mongeer which commands the pass into Bengal and whilst he was collecting more troops from the extensive country in his rear he drew lines from the mountains to the Ganges to stop the progress of the enemy  Jumla turns his rear  Mahommed the son of Aurungzêbe had been detached with ten thousand horse from the field of Kidgwâ in pursuit of Suja The prince was soon joined by Jumla the visier with a great force and they proceeded slowly down along the banks of the Ganges The strong position of Suja gave him a manifest advantage and Jumla an able and experienced officer contrived to drive him from his post without bloodshed The ridge of mountains to the right of the Ganges are in their fertile valleys possessed by petty but independent princes Jumla found means to draw these over to his party and they shewed to him a passage through their country by which he could turn the rear of Suja Having by  way of blind left a considerable part of the army to fall down in the common rout along the river he himself accompanied by the prince entered the mountains and was heard of by Suja in his rear when he expected to be attacked in front Suja decamped with precipitation but he arrived in the environs of RajaMâhil some days before Jumla issued from the mountains He fortified himself in his camp and the visier who could make no impression without artillery marched toward the left to join the army coming down along the Ganges  Attacks him in his lines  The whole army having joined the Imperialists presented themselves before the lines of Suja The visier opened upon him with his artillery and made several unsuccessful assaults During six days he was repulsed with slaughter but Suja durst not trust the effeminate natives of Bengal in the open field against the Tartars of the north who composed the greater part of the Imperial army Jumla played incessantly with his artillery upon the fortifications which being only made up of hurdles and loose sandy soil were soon ruined Suja's post becoming untenable he decamped under the favour of night and Jumla afraid of an ambush though he was apprised of the retreat of the enemy durst not follow him The rainy season commenced on the very night of Suja's flight and the Imperialists were constrained to remain inactive for some months in the neighbourhood of RajaMâhil  Suja retreats  Suja with his army crossing the Ganges took the rout of Tanda and during the inactivity of the Imperialists strengthened himself with troops from the Lower Bengal He also drew from that quarter a great train of artillery which was wrought by Portuguese and other Europeans who were settled in that country Suja being attached to no system of religion was favourable to all He promised to build churches for the Christians should he succeed in his views  on the empire and the missionaries and fathers entered with zeal into his cause The affairs of the prince began to wear a better aspect His effeminate troops acquired confidence from a wellserved artillery and even Aurungzêbe who confided much in the abilities of Jumla was not without anxiety An event happened about this time which raised the hopes of Suja and added to the fears of his brother  The prince Mahommed  The prince Mahommed who in conjunction with Jumla commanded the Imperial army had before the civil war conceived a passion for one of the daughters of Suja Overtures of marriage had been made and accepted but the consummation of the nuptials had been broken off by the troubles which disturbed the times He seemed even to have forgot his betrothed wife in his activity in the field but the princess moved by the misfortunes of her father wrote with her own hand a very moving letter to Mahommed She lamented her unhappy fate in seeing the prince whom she loved armed against her father She expressed her passion and unfortunate condition in terms which found their way to his heart His former affections were rekindled in all their fury and in the elevation of his mind he resolved to desert his father's cause  goes over to Suja  The visier upon affairs of some importance was in the mean time at some distance from the army which lay at RajaMâhil The opportunity was favourable for the late adopted scheme of Mahommed He opened the affair to some of his friends he complained of his father's coldness and even of his ingratitude to a son to whom as having seized the person of Shaw Jehân he owed the empire He gave many instances of his own services many of the unjust returns made by Aurungzêbe and concluded by declaring his fixed resolution to join Suja They endeavoured to dissuade him from so rash an action but he had taken his resolution and he would  listen to no argument He asked them Whether they would follow his fortunes they replied  "We are the servants of Mahommed and if the prince will tonight join Suja he is so much beloved by the army that the whole will go over to him by the dawn of day"  On these vague assurances the prince quitted the camp that evening with a small retinue He embarked in a boat on the Ganges and the troops thought that he had only gone on a party of pleasure  Jumla perplexed  Some of the pretended friends of Mahommed wrote letters containing an account of the desertion of the prince to the visier That lord was struck with astonishment at the folly and madness of the deed He thought it impossible that without having secured the army he could desert his father's cause He was perplexed with anxiety and doubt he expected every moment to hear that the troops were in full march to Tanda and he was afraid to join them with a design of restoring them to their duty lest he should be carried prisoner to the enemy He however after some hesitation resolved to discharge the part of a good officer He set out express for the camp where he arrived next day He found things in the utmost confusion but not in such a desperate situation as he had expected A great part of the army was mutinous and beginning to plunder the tents of those who continued in their duty These had taken arms in defence of their property so that bloodshed must soon have ensued The country on every side of the camp was covered with whole squadrons that sled from the flame of dissention which had been kindled Tumult commotion and disorder reigned everywhere when the visier entered the camp  quells  The appearance of that lord who was respected for his great qualities by all soon silenced the storm He mounted an elephant in the center of the camp and spoke after this manner to the army who crowded tumultuously round him  "You are  no strangers my fellowsoldiers to the flight of the prince Mahommed and to his having preferred the love of the daughter of Suja to his allegiance to his sovereign and father Intoxicated by the same to which your valour had raised him he has long been presumptuous in his hopes Ambition brought him to the edge of the precipice over which he has been thrown by love But in abandoning you he has abandoned his fortune and after the first transports are over regret and a consciousness of folly will only remain Suja has perhaps pledged his faith to support the infatuated prince against his father he may have even promised the throne of India as a reward for his treachery But how can Suja perform his promise We have seen his hostile standardsbut we have seen them only to be seized Bengal abounds with men with provisions with wealth but valour is not the growth of that soil The armies of Aurungzêbe are numerous like you they are drawn from the north and he is himself as invincible in the field as he is wise and decisive in the cabinet  a mutiny  "But should we even suppose that Fortune which has hitherto been so favourable to Aurungzêbe should desert him in another field would Mahommed reign Would Suja experienced in the arts of government and ambitious as he is of power place the scepter of India in the hands of a boy Would he submit to the authority of the son of a younger brother to the tool of his own designs The impossibility is glaring and obvious Return therefore my fellowsoldiers to your duty You can conquer without Mahommed Fortune has not followed him to the enemy Your valour can command her every where He has embraced his own ruin but why should we share in his adverse fate Bengal lies open before you the enemy are just not totally broken They are not objects of terror but of plunder you may acquire wealth without trouble and glory without toil"  in the army  This speech of the visier had the intended effect Every species of disorder and tumult subsided in a moment The troops desired to be led to the enemy and Jumla did not permit their ardor to cool He immediately began to throw a bridge of boats across the river The work was finished in three days and he passed the Ganges with his whole army Mahommed in the mean time having arrived at Tanda was received with every mark of respect by Suja The nuptials were celebrated with the utmost magnificence and pomp and the festivity was scarce over when certain news arrived of the near approach of the Imperial army under Jumla Suja immediately issued out with all his forces from Tanda He posted himself in an advantageous ground and waited for the enemy with a determined resolution to risk all on the issue of a battle  Defeats Suja  Mahommed who was naturally full of confidence and boldness did not despair of bringing over the greatest part of the army of Jumla to his own side He erected his standard in the front of Suja's camp and when that prince drew out his forces in order of battle he placed himself in the center of the first line Jumla conscious of the superiority of his own troops in point of valour was glad to find the enemy in the open field He formed his line and ordered a column of horse to fall immediately upon Mahommed That prince vainly supposed when the enemy advanced that they were determined to desert Jumla But he was soon convinced of his error by the warmth of their attack He behaved with his usual bravery but the effeminate natives of Bengal were not to be kept to their colours They fled and he was carried along with their flight The utmost efforts of Suja proved also ineffectual His troops gave way on all sides and he himself was the last who quitted the field A great slaughter was made in the pursuit and Tanda opened her gates to the conqueror The  princes fled to Dacca in the utmost distress leaving the eldest son of Suja dead on the field but Jumla remaining for some time in Tanda to settle the affairs of the now almost conquered province gave them some respite which they employed in levying a new army  Artifice of Aurungzêbe  The news of the flight of Mahommed arriving in the mean time at Delhi Aurungzêbe concluded that the whole army in Bengal had gone over to Suja He immediately marched from the capital with a great force He took with incredible expedition the rout of Bengal He however had not advanced far from Delhi when intelligence of the success of his arms in the battle of Tanda met him on his way and he forthwith returned to the capital He there had recourse to his usual policy He wrote a letter to his son as if in answer to one received and he contrived matters so that it should be intercepted by Suja That prince having perused the letter placed it in the hands of Mahommed who swore by the Prophet that he had never once written to his father since the battle of Kidgwâ The letter was conceived in terms like these  to separate Mahommed  "To our beloved son Mahommed whose happiness and safety are joined with our life It was with regret and sorrow that we parted with our son when his valour became necessary to carry on the war against Suja We hoped from the love we bear to our firstborn to be gratified soon with his return and that he would have brought the enemy captive to our presence in the space of a month to relieve our mind from anxiety and fear But seven months passed away without the completion of the wishes of Aurungzêbe Instead of adhering to your duty Mahommed you betrayed your father and threw a blot on your own fame The smiles of a woman have overcome filial piety Honour is forgot in  the brightness of her beauty and he who was destined to rule the empire of the Moguls has himself become a slave But as Mahommed seems to repent of his folly we forget his crimes He has called the name of God to vouch for his sincerity and our parental affection returns He has already our forgiveness but the execution of what he proposes is the only means to regain our favour"  from Suja  The letter made an impression on the mind of Suja which all the protestations of Mahommed could not remove He became silent and discontented He had an affection for the prince and he was more enraged at being disappointed in the judgment which he had formed than at the supposed treachery Having continued three days in this agitation of mind he at last sent for the prince He told him in the presence of his council that after all the struggles of affection with suspicion the latter had prevailed that he could no longer behold Mahommed with an eye of friendship should he even swear to his innocence in the holy temple of Mecca that the bond of union and confidence which had lately subsisted between them was broken and that instead of a son and a friend he beheld him in the light of an enemy  "It is therefore necessary for the peace of both" continued Suja "that Mahommed should depart Let him take away his wife with all the wealth and jewels which belong to her rank The treasures of Suja are open he may take whatever he pleases GoAurungzêbe should thank me for sending away his son before he has committed a crime"  He is dismissed by that prince  Mahommed on this solemn occasion could not refrain from tears He felt the injustice of the reproach he admired the magnanimity of Suja he pitied his misfortunes But his own condition was equally deplorable He knew the stern rigour of his father  who never trusted any man twice He knew that his difficulty of forgiving was equal to his caution The prospect was gloomy on either side Distrust and misery were with Suja and a prison was the least punishment to be expected from Aurungzêbe He took leave the next day of his fatherinlaw That prince presented his daughter with jewels plate and money to a great amount and the unfortunate pair pursued their journey to the camp of Jumla  seized  Mahommed accompanied by his spouse the daughter of Suja moved slowly toward the camp of Jumla His melancholy encreased as he advanced but whither could he fly No part of the vast empire of India was impervious to the arms of Aurungzêbe and he was not possessed of the means of escaping beyond the limits of his father's power He was even ashamed to shew himself among troops whom he had deserted Regret succeeded to folly and he scarce could reflect with patience on the past though the fair cause of his misfortunes still kept her dominion over his mind Having approached within a few miles of the Imperialists he sent to announce his arrival to the visier That minister hastened to receive him with all the honours due to his rank A squadron with drawn swords formed around his tent but they were his keepers rather than guards Jumla the very next day received a packet from court which contained orders to send Mahommed should he fall into his hands under a strong escort to Delhi The officer who commanded the party was ordered to obey the commands of the prince but he at the same time received instructions to watch his motions and to prevent his escape When he arrived at Agra he was confined in the citadel from whence he was soon after sent to Gualiâr where he remained a prisoner to his death  and imprisoned  Mahommed though brave and enterprizing like his father was destitute of his policy and art Precipitate full of fire and inconsiderate he was more fitted for acting the part of a partizan than of a general and was therefore less adapted for war than for battle Haughty in his temper yet easy in his address an enemy to cruelty and an absolute stranger to fear He was daring and active on occasions of danger but he knew his merit and he was selfconceited and haughty He ascribed to his own decisive valour the wholesuccess of his father and he had been often known to say that he placed Aurungzêbe on the throne when he might have possessed it himself Naturally open and generous he despised the duplicity of his father and disdained power that must be preserved by art His free conversations upon these subjects estranged from him the affections of his father who seems to have confessed this merit by his own fears Had Mahommed accepted of the offer of Shaw Jehân when he seized that prince he had courage and activity sufficient to keep possession of the throne of the Moguls But he neglected the golden opportunity and shewed his love of sway when he was not possessed of any rational means to acquire the empire His misfortunes however were greater than his folly He passed seven years in a melancholy prison at Gualiâr till death put a period to his misery  Suja  Jumla having settled the affairs of the western Bengal marched with his army toward Dacca Suja was in no condition to meet him in the field and to attempt to hold out any place against so great a force would be to ensure by protracting his own fate His resources were now gone He had but little money and he could have no army Men foresaw his inevitable ruin and they shunned his presence His appearance to the few troops who had remained near him was even more terrible than the sight of an enemy They could not extricate him from misfortune and they  pitied his fate He however still retained the dignity of his own soul He was always cheerful and full of hopes his activity prevented the irksomeness of thought When the news of the approach of the Imperialists arrived he called together his few friends He acquainted them with his resolution of flying beyond the limits of an empire in which he had now nothing to expect but misfortunes and he asked them Whether they preferred certain misery with their former lord to an uncertain pardon from a new master  driven from Bengal  To the feeling and generous misfortune secures friends They all declared their resolution to follow Suja to whatever part of the world he should take his flight With fifteen hundred horse he directed his march from Dacca toward the frontiers of Assâm Jumla was close at his heels but Suja having crossed the Baramputre which running through the kingdom of Assâm falls into Bengal entered the mountains of Rangamâti Through almost impervious woods over abrupt rocks across deep valleys and headlong torrents he continued his flight toward Arracân Having made a circuit of near five hundred miles through the wild mountains of Tippera he entered Arracân with a diminished retinue The hardships which he sustained in the march were forgot in the hospitality of the prince of the country who received him with the distinction due to his rank  takes refuge in Arracán  Jumla lost sight of the fugitive when he entered the mountains beyond the Baramputre He turned his arms against Cogebâr and reduced that country with the neighbouring valleys which intersect the hills of Kokapâgi But Suja though beyond the reach of Jumla's arms was not beyond his policy The place of his retreat was known and threatening letters from the visier whose fame had passed the mountains of Arracân raised terrors in the  mind of the Raja He thought himself unsafe in his natural fastness and a sudden coolness to Suja appeared in his behaviour The wealth of his unfortunate guest became also an object for his avarice Naturally ungenerous he determined to take advantage of misfortune but he must do it with caution for fear of opposing the current of the public opinion He sent a message to Suja requiring him to depart from his dominions The impossibility of the thing was not admitted as an excuse The Monsoons raged on the coast the hills behind were impassable and covered with storms The violence of the season joined issue with the unrelenting fate of Suja The unfeeling prince was obstinate He issued his commands because he knew they could not be obeyed Suja sent his son to request a respite for a few days He was accordingly indulged with a few days but they only brought accumulated distress  His uncommon  Many of the adherents of the prince had been lost in his march many foreseeing his inevitable fate deserted him after his arrival at Arracân Of fifteen hundred only forty remained and these were men of some rank who were resolved to die with their benefactor and lord The Sultana the mother of his children had been for some time dead his second wife three daughters and two sons composed his family The few days granted by the Raja were now expired Suja knew of no resource To ask a longer indulgence was in vain he perceived the intentions of the prince of Arracân and he expected in silence his fate A message in the mean time came from the Raja demanding in marriage the daughter of Suja  "My misfortunes" said the prince "were not complete without this insult Go tell your master that the race of Timur though unfortunate will never submit to dishonour But why does he search for a cause of dispute His inhumanity and avarice are too obvious to be covered by any pretence Let  him act an open part and his boldness will atone for a portion of his crime"  distress  The Raja was highly offended at the haughtiness of the answer of Suja But the people pitied the fugitive and the prince durst not openly do an act of flagrant injustice To assassinate him in private was impossible from the vigilance of his forty friends A public pretence must be made to gain the wealth of Suja and to appease his enemies by his death The report of a conspiracy against the Raja was industriously spread abroad It was affirmed that Suja had formed a design to mount the throne of Arracân by assassinating its monarch The thing was in itself improbable How could a foreigner with forty adherents hope to rule a people of a different religion with themselves An account of the circumstances of the intended revolution was artfully propagated The people lost their respect for Suja in his character of an assassin It was in vain he protested his innocence men who could give credit to such a plot had too much weakness to be moved by argument  Ordered to leave Arracân  The Raja in a pretended terror called suddenly together his council He unfolded to them the circumstances of the conspiracy and he asked their advice They were unanimously of opinion that Suja and his followers should be immediately sent away from the country The Raja was disappointed in his expectations he had hoped that death should be the punishment of projected murder But the natural hospitality of the nobles of Arracân prevailed over his views He however under the sanction of the determination of his council resolved to execute his own designs The unfortunate prince with his family and his forty friends were apprised of his intentions They were encamped on a narrow plain which lay between a precipice and a river which issuing from Arracân falls into the country of Pegû At  either end of the plain a pass was formed between the rock and the river Suja with twenty of his men possessed himself of one and his son with the rest stood in the other in arms They saw the Raja's troops advancing and Suja with a smile on his countenance addressed his few friends  His resolution  "The battle we are about to sight is unequal but in our present situation the issue must be fortunate We contend not now for empire nor even for life but for honour It is not fitting that Suja should die without having his arms in his hands to submit tamely to assassination is beneath the dignity of his family and former fortune But your case my friends is not yet so desperate You have no wealth to be seized Aurungzêbe has not placed a price upon your heads Though the Raja is destitute of generosity it is not in human nature to be wantonly cruel You may escape with your lives and leave me to my fate There is one however who must remain with Suja My son is involved with me in my adverse fortune his crime is in his blood To spare his life would deprive the Raja of half his reward from Aurungzêbe for procuring my death"  bravery  His friends were silent but they burst into tears They took their posts and prepared themselves to receive with their swords the troops of the Raja The unfortunate women remained in their tent in dreadful suspence till rouzed by the clashing of arms they rushed forth with dishevelled hair The men behaved with that elevated courage which is raised by misfortune in the extreme They twice repulsed the enemy who afraid of their swords began to gall them with arrows from a distance The greatest part of the friends of Suja were at length either slain or wounded He himself still stood undaunted and defended the pass against the cowardly troops of Arracân They durst not approach hand to hand and their missive weapons flew wide of their aim  The officer who commanded the party sent in the mean time some of his soldiers to the top of the precipice to roll down stones on the prince and his gallant friends One fell on the shoulder of Suja and he sunk down being stunned with the pain The enemy took advantage of his fall They rushed forward disarmed and bound him  misfortunes and murder  He was hurried into a canoe which lay ready on the river The officer told him that his orders were to send him down the stream to Pegû Two of his friends threw themselves into the canoe as they were pushing it away from the bank The wife and the daughters of Suja with cries which reached heaven threw themselves headlong into the river They were however brought ashore by the soldiers and carried away together with the son of Suja who was wounded to the Raja's palace The prince sad and desolate beheld their distress and in his sorrow heeded not his own approaching fate They had now rowed to the middle of the stream but his eyes were turned toward the shore The rowers according to their instructions from the cruel Raja drew a large plug from the bottom of the canoe and throwing themselves into the river were taken up by another canoe which had followed them for that purpose The canoe was instantly filled with water The unfortunate prince and his two friends betook themselves to swimming They followed the other canoe but she hastened to the shore The river was broad and at last worn out with fatigue Suja resigned himself to death His two faithful friends at the same instant disappeared in the stream  Deplorable fate of his family  Piâra Bani the favourite the only wife of Suja was so famed for her wit and beauty that many songs in her praise are still sung in Bengal The gracefulness of her person had even become proverbial When the Raja came to wait upon her in the haram  she attempted to stab him with a dagger which she had concealed She however was disarmed and perceiving that she was destined for the arms of the murderer of her lord in the madness of grief rage and despair she disfigured her beautiful face with her own hands and at last found with sad difficulty a cruel death by dashing her head against a stone The three daughters of Suja still remained two of them found means by poison to put an end to their grief The third was married to the Raja but she did not long survive what she reckoned an indelible disgrace on the family of Timur The son of Suja who had defended himself to the last was at length overpowered by means of stones rolled down upon him from the rock He was carried to the Raja and soon after with his infant brother fell a victim by a cruel death to the jealousy of that prince  Reflections  Such was the melancholy end of Suja and of all his family a prince not less unfortunate than Dara though of better abilities to oppose his fate He was bold and intrepid in action and far from being destitute of address His personal courage was great and he was even a stranger to political fear Had he at the commencement of the war been possessed of troops equal in valour to those of his brother we might probably have the misfortunes of Aurungzêbe and not those of Suja to relate But the effeminate natives of Bengal failed him in all his efforts Personal courage in a general assumes the appearance of fear with a cowardly army When Suja prevailed the merit was his own when he failed it was the fault of his army No prince was ever more beloved than Suja he never did a cruel never an inhumane action during his life Misfortune and even death itself could not deprive him of all his friends and though his fate was not known in Hindostan for some years after his death when it was heard it filled every eye with tears  CHAP IV  Prudent administration of AurungzêbeObservations on his conductHis behaviour toward his second sonSolimân Shekô betrayed by the Raja of SerinagurHe fliesis takenbrought to Delhiand

extremity of the empire neither disturbed the repose of Aurungzêbe nor diverted his attention from the civil affairs of the state Impartial and decisive in his measures he was even acknowledged to be a good prince by those who recognized not his right to the throne and men began to wonder how he who was so just could be so cruel The people suffered little by the civil war The damage done by the marching and countermarching of armies was paid out of the public treasury An exact discipline had been observed by all parties for the rivals for the crown of Hindostan though in the sield against one another could not persuade themselves that they were in an enemy's country The prince who prevailed in a province extended not the punishment  of treason to those who supported a competitor with their swords and what is scarce credible not one man beyond the family of Timur was either assassinated in private or slain by the hands of public justice during a civil war so long so bloody and so various in its events  Prudent administration  The emperor accustomed to business in his long government of various provinces was well acquainted with the whole detail of public affairs Nothing was so minute as to escape his notice He knew that the power and consequence of the prince depended upon the prosperity and happiness of the people and he was even from selfish views an enemy to oppression and an encourager of agriculture and commercial industry He established a perfect security of property over all his dominions The forms of justice were made less intricate and more expeditious than under former reigns To corrupt a judge was rendered for the first time a crime The fees paid in the courts of judicature were ascertained with accuracy and precision and a delay in the execution of justice subjected the judge to the payment of the loss sustained by the party aggrieved  of Aurungzebe  The course of appeals from inferior to superior courts was uninterrupted and free but to prevent a wanton exertion of this privilege the appellant was severely fined when his complaint against a judgment was found frivolous and illfounded The distributers of public justice when their decrees were reversed could not always screen themselves under a pretended error in judgment Should the matter appear clear they were turned out of their offices as swayed by partiality or bribery Aurungzêbe soon after his accession to the throne established a precedent of this kind An appeal came before him in the presence of the nobles The decision had been unjust He sent for the judge and told him in public  "This matter is clear and obvious  if you have no abilities to perceive it in that light you are unfit for your place as a weak man if you suffered yourself to be overcome by presents you are an unjust man and therefore unworthy of your office"  Having thus reprimanded the judge he divested him of his employment and dismissed him with ignominy from his presence  Observations on his conduct  But this is the fair side of the character of Aurungzêbe Dark and determined in his policy he broke through every restraint to accomplish his designs He pointed in a direct line to the goal of ambition and he cared not by what means he removed whatever object obstructed his way He either believed that morality was inconsistent with the great tract of government or he acted as if he believed it and he sometimes descended into a vicious meanness which threw discredit on his abilities as well as upon his honesty He held the cloke of religion between his actions and the vulgar and impiously thanked the Divinity for a success which he owed to his own wickedness When he was murdering and persecuting his brothers and their families he was building a magnificent mosque at Delhi as an offering to God for his assistance to him in the civil wars He acted as highpriest at the consecration of this temple and made a practice of attending divine service there in the humble dress of a Fakier But when he lifted one hand to the Divinity he with the other signed warrants for the assassination of his relations  Artful conduct of his second son  During the civil wars which convulsed the empire all remained quiet in the Decan The prudent management of Mahommed Mauzim the second son of Aurungzêbe prevented the lately conquered provinces from shaking off the yoke That prince with a great share of his father's abilities exceeded him if possible in coolness and selfdenial He knew the stern jealousy of  the emperor and he rather affected the humility of a slave than the manly confidence of a son He was no stranger to the facility with which his father could sacrifice every thing to his own security and he looked upon him as an enemy who watched his motions more than in the light of a parent who would grant indulgences for errors He knew that the best means for preventing the suspicions of Aurungzêbe was to copy his own art He affected to love business he was humble and selfdenied in his professions destitute of presumption and full of devotion  suspected  Aurungzêbe whose penetrating eye saw some design lurking in secret behind the conduct of Mauzim insinuated to that prince that to reign was a delicate situation that sovereigns must be jealous even of their own shadows and as for himself he was resolved never to become a sacrifice to the ambition of a son Mauzim knew the intention of the speech but he seemed not to understand it and he redoubled his attention to those arts which had already in a great measure lulled asleep the watchful suspicions of his father He remitted the revenue to the capital with great regularity and precision He practised in his expences the oeconomy and frugality which his father loved In appearance and even perhaps from constitution an enemy to effeminate pleasures without vanity enough for pomp and magnificence his court seemed like the cell of a hermit who grudged to others the indulgences for which he had no taste himself All this art however prevailed not with Aurungzébe to continue him in his viceroyship of the Decan He knew from his own experience how dangerous it is to continue the government of a rich province long in the hands of a prince of abilities He therefore recalled Mauzim to court and gave his high office to Shaista Chan  Expedient against Solimân  The attention of Aurungzêbe turned from Bengal to another quarter upon receiving certain intelligence of the flight of Suja to Arracân Solimân still remained inclosed in the mountains of Serinagur under the protection of the Raja The emperor did not think himself firmly fixed on the throne whilst any of the family of Dara remained out of his hands He applied through Joy Singh who from being of the same religion with the Raja had great influence over him to the prince of Serinagur He tempted his avarice and he wrought upon his fears The Raja being averse to be thought dishonourable hesitated contrary to the bias of his passions He however connived at an invasion of his country to reconcile his people by an appearance of necessity to the delivering up of the prince The troops who entered his country with pretended hostilities carried to him the price set upon the head of Solimân  Seized  The unfortunate youth being apprized of his danger fled over the frightful mountains which separate Serinagur from Tibet Three friends accompanied him in this impracticable attempt The sides of these mountains are covered with impervious forests the haunts of beasts of prey on their top dwells a perpetual storm Rapid rivers and impassable torrents occupy the vallies except where some brushwood here and there hides dangerous and venomous snakes It was then the rainy season and mist and darkness covered the desart with additional horror The unhappy fugitives not daring to trust any guide lost their way When they thought themselves on the borders of Tibet they were again within sight of Serinagur Worn out with fatigue they took shelter under a rock where they were discovered by a shepherd who gave them some refreshment but at the same time informed the Raja of what he had seen That chief sent his son with a party to seize Solimân The prince was  asleep when they arrived in fight but he was rouzed by one of his three friends who kept the watch They took to their arms The young Raja plied them with arrows from a distance and two of the prince's companions were slain He himself was wounded He fell under this unequal mode of attack and was brought bound into the presence of the Raja  and sent to Delhi  That prince began to excuse his breach of hospitality by public necessity He diminished the independence of his own situation and magnified the power of Aurungzêbe  "To seize an unfortunate fugitive" said Solimân "is a crime but it is aggravated by the insult of making an apology for what Heaven and mankind abhor Take your reward for my life it alleviates the misfortunes of my situation that now I owe you nothing for the friendship which you exhibited upon my arrival in your dominions"  He turned his eyes in silence to the ground and without a murmur permitted himself to be carried prisoner to Delhi The emperor affected to be displeased that the unhappy prince had fallen into his hands To leave him at large was impossible and even the walls of a prison were not a sufficient security against the designs which the disaffected might form in his favour He ordered him to be brought into the hall of audience in the presence of all the nobles even the chief ladies of the haram were indulged with a fight of a young prince as famous for his exploits as for his misfortunes  Brought before the emperor  When he had entered the outergate of the palace the chains were struck off from his feet but the fetters of gold were left upon his hands The whole court were struck with the stately gracefulness of his person they were touched with grief at his melancholy fate Many of the nobles could not refrain from tears the ladies of the haram weeped aloud behind the screens  Even the heart of Aurungzêbe began to relent and a placid anxiety seemed to wander over his face Solimân remained silent with his eyes fixed on the ground  "Fear nothing Solimân Shekô" said the emperor "I am not cruel but cautious Your father fell as a man destitute of all religion but you shall be treated well"  The prince bowed his head and then raised his hands as high as his fetters would permit according to the custom in the Imperial presence He then addressed himself to the emperor  "If my death is necessary for the safety of Aurungzêbe let me presently die for I am reconciled to my fate But let me not linger in prison to languish away by degrees by the means of draughts which deprive the mind of reason when they enfeeble the body"  This alluded to an infusion of poppy which the imprisoned princes were forced to drink in Gualiâr It emaciated them exceedingly their strength and understanding left them by degrees they became torpid and insensible till they were at last relieved by death The emperor desired him to rest satisfied that no design was entertained against his life He was sent that very night to Agra and soon after ordered to Gualiâr with the prince Mahommed the emperor's eldest son  Embassies from Persia and Tartary  The imprisonment of Solimân put an end to the fears of Aurungzêbe He found himself firmly seated on the throne and mankind were unwilling to disturb the tranquillity which they enjoyed under his prudent administration Peace prevailed all over the empire The most distant and inaccessible provinces became pervious to his authority He extinguished party by retaining no appearance of revenge against those who had opposed his elevation He made friends of his enemies by conferring upon them favours and he secured the faith of his friends by reposing in them his confidence The neighbouring states who had remained unconcerned spectators of the civil wars acknowledged  the right which Aurungzêbe had acquired by his fortune and address An ambassador arrived from Shaw Abas the Second of Persia to felicitate him on his accession to the throne and he was followed by another from Suja king of the western Tartary The emperor's pride was flattered by the acquiescence of these two powerful monarchs in his title to the crown He received their representatives with unusual pomp and at the same time that he gratified the princes with magnificent presents he enriched the ambassadors with very considerable sums of money  Shaw Allum declared heir of the empire  The folly of the prince Mahommed had totally estranged from him the affections of his father his obstinacy and daring disposition had rendered him an object of terror to the provident mind of Aurungzêbe That monarch had resolved to keep him always a close prisoner in Gualiâr he however allowed him a household and the company of women This humane treatment had raised the hopes of the prince of being speedily released He wrote to his father penitential letters but they produced no answer Mahommed in the vigour of his own mind had a crime which could not be forgiven Mauzim the second son took advantage of his brother's misfortune He redoubled his attention to his father's orders and seemed to obey with so much humility that he eradicated all fears of wishing to command from his suspicious mind To cut off the hopes of Mahommed as well as to secure the affections of Mauzim the latter was publicly declared heir of the empire and his name changed to that of Shaw Allum or King of the World A son was soon after born to that prince and his birth was celebrated with uncommon splendour and festivity  A dreadful famine  In the midst of this public joy the news of a dreadful calamity was received at court A prodigious famine occasioned by the  uncommon drought of the season which burnt up the harvest prevailed in different parts of India The emperor exerted himself with a humanity unsuitable to his behaviour toward his own family to alleviate the distress of his subjects He remitted the taxes that were due he employed those already collected in the purchase of corn which was distributed among the poorer sort He even expended immense sums out of the treasury in conveying grain by land as well as by water into the interior provinces from Bengal and the countries which lie on the five branches of the Indus as having suffered less on account of the great rivers by which they are watered The grain so conveyed was purchased at any price with the public money and it was resold at a very moderate rate The poorer sort were supplied at fixed places with a certain quantity without any consideration whatever The activity of the emperor and his wise regulations carried relief through every corner of his dominions Whole provinces were delivered from impending destruction and many millions of lives were saved  Wisdom and humanity of of Aurungzêbe  This humane attention to the safety of his subjects obliterated from their minds all objections to his former conduct He even began to be virtuous The ambition which made him wade through blood to the throne inclined him to the pursuit of fame which can only be acquired by virtue  "No man" observes a Persian author "is a tyrant for the sake of evil Passion perverts the judgment a wrong judgment begets opposition and opposition is the cause of cruelty bloodshed and civil war When all opposition is conquered the sword of vengeance is shcathed and the destroyer of mankind becomes the guardian of the human species"  Such are the reflections of a writer who published the history of Aurungzêbe in the heart of his court and that they were just appears from his having the boldness to make them  To alleviate the calamity which had fallen on the people was the principal if not the sole business of the emperor during the third year of his reign A favourable season succeeded to his care and the empire soon wore its former face of prosperity  A war on the  In the month of September of the year the news of the breaking out of a war on the frontiers of the Decan was brought to Aurungzêbe The Imperial governor Shaista Chan irritated at the depredatory incursions of the subjects of Sewâji prince of Côkin or Concan on the coast of Malabar led an army into his country Sewâji unable to cope with the Imperialists in the field retired into the heart of his dominions to levy troops and left his frontier towns exposed They fell one by one before the power of Shaista and that lord at length sat down before Chagna one of the principal places both for consequence and strength in the province of Côkin It was situated on a high rock steep and inaccessible on every side The utmost efforts of Shaista were baffled He had made breaches in the parapet on the edge of the rock but he could not ascend with an assault When he attempted to apply scaling ladders the besieged rolled down huge stones upon him and crushed whole squadrons of his troops To raise the siege would bring disgrace to take the place seemed now impossible  coast of Malab  r  Shaista in the mean time fell upon an ingenious contrivance which produced the desired effect A hill rose at some distance from the fort from the top of which every thing which passed within the walls could be seen through a spyglass The captaingeneral stood frequently on this hill to reconnoitre the place He observed that at a certain hour every day the garrison was supplied with ammunition from a magazine in the center of the sort He had no mortars in his train it having been found  impossible to carry them across the immense ridge of mountains which separate the Decan from Malabâr He however fell upon an effectual expedient The wind blowing fresh from the hill upon the town he let fly a paperkite which concealed a blind match at the very instant that the garrison was supplying themselves with powder from the magazine He permitted it to drop in the midst by an accident the match fell upon some powder which happened to be strewed around The fire communicated with the magazine and the whole went off with a dreadful explosion which shook the country threw down the greatest part of the fort and buried the most of the garrison in the ruins The Moguls ascended in the confusion and those who had escaped the shock fell by the sword  The Maraja▪sent  The emperor was so much pleased with the expedition of Shaista into Malabâr that he resolved to reinforce him to complete the conquest of Côkin The Maraja who for his desertion of Dara had been placed in the government of Guzerat was ordered to march to join Shaista with twenty thousand horse That prince fond of the activity and tumult of expedition obeyed the Imperial mandate without hesitation He arrived in the camp before the news of his march had reached the captaingeneral Being naturally haughty and violent he disapproved of Shaista's mode of carrying on the war He pretended that he was sent to assist him with his counsel as well as with his arms and that he was resolved if he did not alter his plan to complete the conquest of Côkin with his own troops Shaista would relinquish no part of his power He commanded him upon his allegiance to obey The Maraja was provoked beyond measure at a treatment so humiliating to his pride He thwarted privately the measures of the captaingeneral and that lord began to exercise over him all the rigour of authority  to reinforce the army  The Maraja whose honour was not proof against his more violent passions formed a plot against Shaista's life The nobles of the first rank are permitted by the patent of their creation to have among their other marks of dignity a band of music consisting of drums fifes trumpets cymbals and other warlike instruments These have an apartment over the gates of their palaces in cities in the camp a tent near that of their lord is assigned to them where they relieve one another and play when not prohibited night and day The Maraja under a pretence that the captaingeneral was much pleased with their music sent them one night a present of five hundred roupees in their master's name and commanded them to continue to play till next morning They accordingly struck up after supper and made a prodigious noise Shaista not averse to music took no notice of this uncommon attention in his band  His plot to assassinate  When the camp became silent toward midnight the Maraja who having a correspondence with Sewâji had admitted a small party of the enemy into the camp ordered them to steal unperceived into the quarter of the captaingeneral They accordingly passed the guards and cutting their way through the screens which surrounded the tents of Shaista entered that in which he slept They searched in the dark for his bed He awakened Alarmed at their whispering he started and seized a lance which was the first weapon that met his hand He at that instant received a blow with a sword which cut off three of his fingers and obliged him to drop the lance He called out aloud to the guards but the noise of the music drowned his voice He groped for the weapon and with it defended his head from their swords His son who slept in the next tent alarmed by the noise rushed in with a lighted torch in his hand The father and son fell then upon the assassins Murderers are always cowards They sled but the son of Shaista expired of the  wounds which he received in the conflict and the father himself recovered with much difficulty  the captaingeneral  The Maraja in the mean time came in seeming consternation to the quarter of the general He lamented the accident and condescended to take the command of the army till he should recover The officers suspected the prince of the assassination but he had cut off the channels which could carry home a proof Silence prevailed over the camp and though Shaista was not slain the Maraja possessed every advantage which he had expected from the murder Aurungzêbe from his perfect knowledge of the disposition of the Maraja was satisfied of his guilt It would not however be either prudent or effectual to order him to appear to answer for his crimes in the presence he knew that his boldness was equal to his wickedness He therefore suppressed his resentment and drew a veil on his designs to lull the prince into security He affected to lament the accident which had befallen to his general but he rejoiced that the management of the war had come into such able hands  Aurungzêbe falls sick  When the affairs of Aurungzêbe wore the most promising aspect he was near losing by his own death the empire which he had acquired by the murder of his relations On the twentyfifth of May he fell into a fever His distemper was so violent that he was almost deprived of his reason His tongue was seized with a palsy he lost his speech and all despaired of his recovery The people were silent and looked forward for a sudden revolution Intrigues for the empire commenced The lords met in private in their palaces the court the haram were full of schemes It was already whispered abroad that he was actually dead Some regretted him as an able prince some as a great general many were of opinion that Heaven had interfered in  punishing his injustice to his relations His sister the princess Roshinâra who had possessed his confidence was thought to conceal his death till her own plans for the succession of his younger son to the throne should be ripe for execution  Consternation of the people  Uncertain and improbable rumours were in the mean time circulated and swallowed with avidity by the people Their affections for the old emperor being still entire they created fictions to flatter their wishes The Maraja they said was in full march to release him from confinement Mohâbet ever averse to Aurungzêbe was on his way with an army for the same purpose from Cabul and had already passed Lahore The people of Agra they affirmed were actuated by tumult and commotion the garrison of the citadel was mutinous and Etabâr who commanded in the place waited only for the news of the death of the new emperor to open the gates to his ancient lord Though it was impossible that these fictions could have any probable foundation from the shortness of the time they were received with implicit faith by a credulous multitude The very shopkeepers and artizans neglected their business for news They gathered together in groups and one continued whisper of important and incredible events flew over all the strects of Delhi  Shaw Allum intrigues for the throne  The prince Shaw Allum was not in the mean time idle He secretly waited upon many of the nobility and solicited their interest with large promises of gratitude and advantage in the event of his father's demise Roshinâra who was best acquainted with the intentions of the emperor insinuated that the succession was to fall on Akbâr as yet but a boy Both parties averred however in public that at present there was no occasion for a new prince Aurungzêbe himself they said only managed the empire during the debility of mind which his illness  had brought upon Shaw Jehân That monarch continued they being now recovered will resume the reins of government and dispose of the succession in favour of any of his posterity whom he shall think worthy of the throne of the Moguls The people already believed themselves under the government of the old emperor The nobility entertained no resolution of that kind Their acquiescence under Aurungzêbe had rendered them afraid of the restoration of his father They knew that the Maraja and Mohâbet who still professed themselves the friends of the latter would in the event of his enlargement carry all before them and feared the violence of the first as much as they dreaded the abilities of the second  Anxiety  Etabâr who commanded the citadel of Agra seemed now to have the fate of the empire in his hands To open the gates to Shaw Jehân was to involve all in confusion though it might be expected that from the attachment of the people to their ancient sovereign tumult and commotion would soon subside Aurungzêbe in the short intervals of his excessive pain applied his mind to business He gathered the sense of the people from the dark anxiety which covered the features of his attendants He called his son Shaw Allum before him He desired him to keep himself in readiness in case of his death to ride post to Agra and to take the merit of releasing Shaw Jehân  "Your only hopes of empire and even the safety of your person" said he "will depend upon the gratitude of your grandfather Let not therefore any other person deprive you of that advantage"  He then called for pen and ink and wrote to Etabâr to keep a strict watch upon the emperor  "As my death is not certain" said Aurungzêbe "let not your fears persuade you to trust to the gratitude of any man"  of Aurungzêbe  The anxiety shewn by the emperor on the occasion convinced mankind that he thought his own recovery doubtful The lords quitted the palace and each began to prepare against the worst events He sent on the fifth day a summons to all the nobility to come to the hall of audience He ordered himself to be carried into the assembly and he requested them from his bed to prevent tumults and commotions  "A Iion" said he alluding to his father "is chained up and it is not your interest to permit him to break loose He is exasperated by real injuries and he fancies more than he feels"  He then called for the great seal of the empire which he had intrusted to the princess Roshinâra He ordered it to be sealed up in a silken bag with his private signet and to be placed by his side His exertion to speak to the nobles threw him into a swoon They thought him dead A murmur flew around He however recovered himself and ordering Joy Singh and some of the principal lords to approach he took them by the hand Day after day he was thus brought into the presence of the nobility All intrigues ceased at the hopes of his recovery On the tenth day of his illness the fever began to leave him and on the thirteenth though weak he was apparently out of danger The storm that was gathering subsided at once A serene calm succeeded and people wondered why their minds had been agitated and discomposed by the hopes and fears of revolution and change  He recovers  The sickness of Aurungzêbe was productive of a discovery of importance to a monarch of his jcalous and provident disposition He sound that Shaw Allum whom he had designed for his successor in the throne had shewn more eagerness in forwarding the schemes of his own ambition than anxiety for the recovery of his father He also found from the reception given to the solicitations of the prince by the nobility that his influence was too inconsiderable to secure to him the undisturbed possession of the  empire His pride was hurt by the first his prudence penetrated into the cause of the second He had long thought the selfdenial of his son to be a cloke for some deeplaid design and an accident had convinced him of the truth of what he had suspected before The mother of Shaw Allum was only the daughter of a petty Raja Aurungzêbe had on account of her beauty taken her to wife but the meanness of her birth had left a kind of disgrace on her son in the eyes of the nobles who revered the high blood of the house of Timur The emperor therefore in his youngest son found a remedy against the objections of the nobility to Shaw Allum That prince was born to Aurungzêbe by the daughter of Shaw Nawâz of the Imperial house of Sefi The Persian nobility who were numerous in the service of the empire discovered a great attachment to Akbâr and even the Moguls preferred him on account of the purity of his blood to his brother The affections of the emperor were also in his favour and he now seriously endeavoured to pave his way to the succession  His demands  When the family of Dara had with the unfortunate prince fallen into the hands of Aurungzêbe that monarch had at the request of his father and the princess Jehanâra delivered over the only daughter of Dara into their hands She remained in the prison at Agra with her grandfather Aurungzêbe upon his recovery wrote a letter full of professions of regard to his father and he concluded it with a formal demand of the daughter of Dara for his son Akbâr hoping by that connection to secure the influence of the young prince among the nobles The sierce spirit of Shaw Jehân took fire Jehanâra's indignation arose They rejected the proposition with disdain and the old emperor returned for answer That the insolence of Aurungzêbe was equal to his crimes The young princess was in the mean time alarmed  She feared force where intreaty had not prevailed She concealed a dagger in her bosom and declared that she would suffer death a hundred times over before she would give her hand to the son of her father's murderer Shaw Jehân did not fail to acquaint Aurungzêbe of her resolution in her own words and that prince with his usual prudence desisted from his design He even took no notice of the harshness of his father's letter He wrote to him soon after for some of the Imperial jewels to adorn his throne  "Let him govern with more justice" said Shaw Jehân "for equity and clemency are the only jewels that can adorn a throne I am weary of his avarice Let me hear no more of precious stones The hammers are ready which will crush them to dust when he importunes me for them again"  on his imprisoned father  Aurungzêbe received the reproaches of his father with his wonted coolness He even wrote back to Agra that  "to offend the emperor was far from being the intention of his dutiful servant Let Shaw Jehân keep his jewels"  said he  "nay more let him command all those of Aurungzêbe His amusements constitute a part of the happiness of his son"  The old emperor was struck with this conduct He knew it to be feigned but the power of his son to inforce his requests gave value to his moderation He accordingly sent to him a present of jewels with a part of the ensigns of Imperial dignity to the value of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds He accompanied them with a short letter  "Take these which I am destined to wear no more Your fortune has prevailedBut your moderation has more power than your fortune over Shaw Jehân Wear them with dignity and make some amends to your family for their misfortunes by your own renown"  Aurungzêbe burst into tears upon the occasion and he was thought sincere The spoils of Suja were on the same day presented at the foot of his throne His fears being  now removed there was room left for humanity He ordered them from his sight and then retired in a melancholy mood from the hall of audience  Shaw Allum sent to the Decan  During these transactions at court Shaw Allum was commissioned by his father to take the command of the Imperial army in the Decan Shaista being rendered unfit for that charge by the wounds which he had received from the assassins armed against him by the Maraja The forwardness of the prince in making a party during his father's illness adhered to the mind of Aurungzêbe but he concealed his sentiments on that subject There however subsisted a coolness which the accurate observers of human nature could plainly perceive in the conduct of the emperor and his abridging the power and revenue of his son when he appointed him to the government of the Decan shewed that he distrusted his loyalty Men who are willing to suppose that Aurungzêbe sacrificed every other passion to ambition affirm that he became even careless about the life of his son and they relate a story to support the justice of the observation A lion issuing from a forest not far distant from Delhi did a great deal of mischief in the open country The emperor in an assembly of the nobles coolly ordered his son to bring him the skin of the lion without permitting him to make the necessary preparations for this dangerous species of hunting Shaw Allum whose courage was equal to his reservedness and moderation cheerfully obeyed and when the master of the huntsmen proposed to provide him with nets he said  "No Aurungzêbe when at my age feared not to attack any beast of prey without formal preparations"  He succeeded in his attempt and brought the lion's skin to his father  and Mohâbet to Guzerat  The arrival of the prince in the Decan superseded the Maraja who during the illness of Shaista commanded the army He requested to be permitted to return to his government of Guzerat but it had been conferred upon Mohâbet This lord during the troubles which convulsed the empire remained quiet in his government of the city and province of Cabul He retained his loyalty to Shaw Jehân and executed the duties of his office in the name of that prince After the death of Dara and the flight of Suja beyond the limits of the empire he saw an end to all the hopes of the restoration of his ancient lord He therefore began to listen to the proposals of Aurungzêbe That prince informed him that instead of being offended at his attachment to his ancient lord he was much pleased with his loyalty That such honour conduct and bravery as those of Mohâbet far from raising the jealousy of the reigning prince were deemed by him as valuable acquisitions to his empire and that to shew the sincerity of his professions he had sent him a commission to govern in quality of viceroy the opulent

to business was an enemy to the speedy restoration of his health but the annual rains which commenced in July having rendered the air more cool his fever entirely left him and he soon regained his former strength His physicians advised him to avoid by an expedition to Cashmire the heat of the ensuing season and his favourite sister Rochinâra whose counsel he generally followed being very desirous of visiting that delightful country persuaded him to prepare for his progress The affairs of the empire had become settled with his returning health The hopes of novelty had subsided in the minds of the people and the precision with which government was carried on left room for neither their hopes nor their fears The superficial  judges of things however blamed the emperor for quitting the center of his dominions whilst his father remained a prisoner in his own capital Aurungzêbe judged of the future by the past the nobles were tired of revolution and war and the vulgar are feldom mutinous or troublesome where no glaring oppression exists  His progress  About the middle of December the emperor after a tedious preparation for this progress left Delhi and moved toward Lahore at which city he arrived by slow marches at the end of seven weeks The army which accompanied him in this tour consisted of near fifty thousand men exclusive of the retinues of his nobles and the necessary followers of the camp The heavy baggage and artillery kept the common highway but the emperor himself deviated often into the country to enjoy the diversion of hunting The princess Rochinâra fond of pomp and magnificence was indulged in her favourite passion by the splendor of her cavalcade The emperor who in a great measure owed his success to the intelligence which she had from time to time transmitted to him from the haram shewed himself grateful Her jealousy of the influence of Jehanâra over her father first attached her to the interests of Aurungzêbe and the partiality shewn by her sister to Dara naturally threw Rochinâra into the scale of his foe Her abilities rendered her sit for politics and intrigue and the warmth of her constitution which she could not consecrate to pleasure adapted her for business and action  to Cashmire  The progress of the prince did not obstruct the necessary business of the state Attended by all his officers the decisions of each department were carried from the camp to every corner of the empire Expresses stood ready on horseback at every stage and the Imperial mandates were dispatched to the various provinces as soon  as they were sealed in the tent of audience The nobles as was customary in the capital attended daily the presence and appeals were discussed every morning as regularly as when the emperor remained at Delhi The petitioners followed the court and a small allowance from the public treasury was assigned to them as a compensation for their additional expence in attending the Imperial camp In this manner Aurungzêbe arrived at Cashmire The beauty the cool and salubrious air of that country induced him to relax his mind for a short time from business He wandered over that charming valley after a variety of pleasures and he soon recovered that vigour of constitution which his attention to public business as well as his late sickness had greatly impaired  Disturbances  The universal peace which had encouraged the emperor to undertake his progress to Cashmire was not of long continuance Disturbances broke out in the kingdom of Guzerat The Rajas of the mountains thinking the tribute which they paid to the empire too high rebelled Rai Singh was chosen chief of the confederacy They joined their forces and issuing from their narrow valleys presented a considerable army in the open country Cuttub a general of experience was ordered against them with the troops stationed in the adjacent provinces He arrived before the rebels and encamped in their presence Both armies entrenched themselves and watched the motions of each other The commanders were determined not to fight at a disadvantage and they continued to harass one another with flying parties whilst the main bodies remained in their respective camps Slight skirmishes happened every day in which neither side arrogated to themselves any great advantage  in Guzerat  The mountaineers being chiefly of the Rajaput tribe at length resolved to continue no longer inactive The nights being lighted  with the increasing moon were unsuitable for a surprize but an accident happened which favoured their designs Under the cover of a flying shower they fell upon the Moguls Advancing in a cloud they came unperceived to the intrenchments and many had clambered over the walls before the sentries gave the alarm A sudden tumult and confusion flew over the camp and a dreadful slaughter commenced The Moguls had no time either to arm or to form The horses broke loose from their piquets and rushed in disorder over men and tents and baggage and arms Some who had mounted were thrown headlong with their horses over the tentropes and other embarrassments of the camp  quelled  A few in the mean time opposed the enemy in a tumultuous manner The Rajaputs themselves were in disorder The confusion and terror of the scene intimidated all They withdrew on both sides as they could not distinguish friends from foes The night was full of horror Every heart beat with fear every tongue joined in the uproar every eye looked impatiently for day The light of morning at length appeared and a sudden shout from both armies gave testimony of their joy Preferring certain danger to evils which they could not distinguish clearly each side on the approach of battle discovered that elevation of spirit which others derive from victory The rebels renewed the attack but the Imperial general who had improved the suspension of battle was now prepared to receive them Rai Singh with a body of his officers charged in the front of the Rajaputs and sustained the whole shock of the Moguls Three hundred persons of rank with Rai Singh the general of the confederates lay dead on the field fifteen hundred of their followers were slain the remaining part of the rebels having fled and left their camp standing to the victors The Imperial general pursued the fugitives into their mountains and in the space of six months he reduced their whole country  and depriving the princes of their hereditary jurisdictions he subjected the people to the authority of temporary governors who derived their power from Aurungzêbe  Invasion of  During these transactions in the north and west Jumla continued in the government of Bengal After the total defeat and flight of Suja he returned to the capital of his province to regulate public affairs thrown into confusion by a length of hostilities Aurungzêbe jealous of the great power and reputation of Jumla had signified to that lord that his presence in the capital would be soon necessary for discharging the duties of his high office of visier He at the same time informed him that he longed much to have an opportunity of expressing in person the high sense which he entertained of his eminent services Jumla who preferred the pomp and activity of the field to the sedentary business of the closet signified to the emperor his desire of continuing in his province pointing out a service from which the empire might derive great advantage and he himself considerable honour  the kingdom  Aurungzêbe who was unwilling to discover his jealousy to a man whom he esteemed as well as feared acquiesced in the proposals of Jumla He however resolved to point out to that lord an enemy which might divert him from any designs he might have to fortify himself in the rich and strong kingdom of Bengal against the empire An army inured to war were devoted to Jumla and his ambition was not greater than his ability to gratify it in the highest line To the north of Bengal lies the rich province of Assâm which discharges the great river Baramputre into the branch of the Ganges which passes by Dacca The king of Assâm falling down this river in his fleet of boats had during the civil wars not only ravaged the lower Bengal but appropriated to himself what part of that country lies between the Ganges at Dacca and the mountains which environ Assâm His power and wealth made  him an object of glory as well as of plunder and Jumla received an Imperial mandate to march against him with his army  of Assam  Jumla having filed off his troops by squadrons toward Dacca joined them at that city and embarking them on the Baramputre moved up into the country which the king of Assâm had long subjected to depredation No enemy appeared in the field They had withdrawn to the fortress of Azo which the king had built on the side of the mountains which looks toward Bengal Jumla invested the place and forced the garrison to surrender at discretion then entering the mountains of Assam defeated the king in a pitched battle and besieged him in his capital of Kirganu The vanquished prince was soon obliged to leave the city with all its wealth to the mercy of the enemy and to take refuge with a few adherents in the mountains of Lassa In many naval conflicts on the river and great lakes through which it flowed Jumla came off victorious and the small forts on the banks fell successively into his hands  Retreat  Thus far success attended the arms of Jumla But the rainy season came on with unusual violence and covered the valley which forms the province of Assâm with water There was no room left for retreating none for advancing beyond Kirganu The mountains around were involved in tempest and besides were full of foes The king upon the approach of the Imperialists removed the grain to the hills and the cattle were driven away Distress in every form attacked the army of Jumla They had wealth but they were destitute of provisions and of every thing necessary for supporting them in the country till the return of the fair season To remain was impossible to retreat almost impracticable The king had destroyed the roads in the passes of the mountains and he harassed the march of the Imperialists with incessant skirmishes Jumla in the mean time conducted his measures with his wonted abilities and prudence and carried back  his army covered with glory and loaded with wealth into the territory near the entrance of the mountains from Bengal  death  Expresses carried the news of the success of Jumla to the emperor He acquainted Aurungzêbe that he had opened a passage which in another season might lead his arms to the borders of China Elated with this prospect of extending his conquests he began to levy forces and dispatched orders to Jumla to be in readiness for the field by the return of the season But the death of that general put an end to this wild design Upon his arrival at Azo a dreadful sickness prevailed in the army and he himself fell a victim to the epidemic malady which carried off his troops Though the death of Jumla relieved the emperor of some of his political fears he was affected by an event which he neither expected nor wished He owed much to the friendship of that great man he admired his abilities and renown in arms  and character of Jumla  Though Jumla arose to the summit of greatness from a low degree mankind ascribed his elevation less to his fortune than to his great parts Prudent penetrating and brave he excelled all the commanders of his age and country in conduct in sagacity and in spirit During a war of ten years when he commanded the army of the king of Tillingâna he reduced the Carnatic and the neighbouring countries with all their forts some of which are still impregnable against all the discipline of Europeans He was calculated for the intrigues of the cabinet as well as for the stratagems of the field He was wise in planning bold in execution master of his mind in action though elevated with all the fire of valour In his private life he was amiable and humane in his public transactions dignified and just He disdained to use ungenerous means against his enemies and he even expressed his joy upon the escape of Suja from his arms He was upon the whole  equal in abilities to Aurungzêbe with no part of the duplicity which stampt some of the actions of that prince with meanness Jumla to his death retained the name of Visier though the duties of the office were discharged by Raja Ragnatta who did not long survive him  Insurrection  The security which Aurungzêbe acquired by the defeat of so many formidable rivals was disturbed from a quarter which added ridicule to danger In the territory of the prince of Marwâr near the city of Nagur there lived an old woman who was arrived at the eightieth year of her age She possessed a considerable hereditary estate and had accumulated by penury a great sum of money Being seized with a fit of enthusiasm she became all of a sudden prodigal of her wealth Fakiers and sturdy beggars under a pretence of religion to the number of five thousand gathered round her castle and received her bounty These vagabonds not satisfied with what the old woman bestowed in charity armed themselves and making predatory excursions into the country returned with spoil to the house of their patroness where they mixed intemperance and riot with devotion The people oppressed by these sanctified robbers rose upon them but they were defeated with great slaughter  Repeated disasters of the same kind were at last attributed to the power of enchantment This ridiculous opinion gaining ground fear became predominant in the opponents of the Fakiers The banditti acquiring confidence from their success burnt and destroyed the country for many leagues and surrounded the castle of the pretended enchantress with a desart The Raja marched against them with his native troops but was defeated the collectors of the Imperial revenue attacked them but they were forced to give way A report prevailed and was cagerly believed by the multitude that on a certain day of the moon the old lady used to cook  in the skull of an enemy a mess composed of owls bats snakes lizards human flesh and other horrid ingredients which she distributed to her followers This abominable meal it was believed by the rabble had the surprising effect of not only rendering them void of all fear themselves and of inspiring their enemies with terror but even of making them invisible in the hour of battle when they dealt their deadly blows around  Fakiers  Their numbers being now encreased to twenty thousand this motley army with an old woman at their head directed their march toward the capital Bistamia for that was her name was a commander full of cruelty She covered her rout with murder and devastation and hid her rear in the smoke of burning villages and towns Having advanced to Narnoul about five days journey from Agra the collector of the revenue in that place opposed her with a force and was totally defeated The affair was now become serious and commanded the attention of the emperor He found that the minds of the soldiers were tainted with the prejudices of the people and he thought it necessary to combat Bistamia with weapons like her own Sujait was ordered against the rebels The emperor in the presence of the army delivered to that general billets written with his own hand which were said to contain magical incantations His reputation for sanctity was at least equal to that of Bistamia and he ordered a billet to be carried on the point of a spear before each squadron which the soldiers were made to believe would counteract the enchantments of the enemy The credulity which induced them to dread the witchcraft of the old woman gave them confidence in the pretended charm of Aurungzêbe  quelled  The Fakiers after their victory at Narnoul thought of nothing but the empire for their aged leader Having rioted upon the  spoils of the country for several days they solemnly raised Bistamia to the throne which gave them an excuse for festivity In the midst of their intemperate joy Sujait made his appearance They fought with the fury of fanatics but when the idea of supernatural aid was dispelled from the minds of the Imperialists the Fakiers were not a match for their swords It was not a battle but a confused carnage a few owed their lives to the mercy of Sujait the rest met the death which they deserved Aurungzêbe when he received Sujait after his victory could not help smiling at the ridicule thrown upon his arms by the opposition of an old woman at the head of a naked army of mendicants  "I sind" said he "that too much religion among the vulgar is as dangerous as too little in a monarch"  The emperor upon this occasion acted the part of a great prince who turns the passions and superstitions of mankind to the accomplishment of his own designs It was more easy to counteract the power than to explode the doctrine of witchcraft  An universal peace  The season of peace and public happiness affords few materials for history Had not the rage of conquest inflamed mankind ancient times would have passed away in silence and unknown Aeras are marked by battles by the rise of states the fall of empires and the evils of human life Years of tranquillity being distinguished by no striking object are soon lost to the sight The mind delights only in the relation of transactions which contribute to information or awaken its tender passions We wish to live in a peaceable age but we read with most pleasure the history of times abounding with revolutions and important events A general tranquillity now prevailed over the empire of Hindostan Aurungzêbe pleased with the salubrious air of Cashmire continued long in that romantic country Nothing marks the annals of that period but a few changes in the departments of the court and  in the governments of provinces which though of some importance to the natives of India would furnish no amusement in Europe  Death of the prince Mahommed  In the seventh year of the emperor's reign his son the prince Mahommed died in prison in the castle of Gualiâr Impatient under his confinement his health had been long upon the decline and grief put at last an end to misfortune which the passions of youth had begun His favourite wife the daughter of Suja was the companion of his melancholy and she pined away with sorrow as being the cause of the unhappy fate of her lord Mahommed had long supported his spirits with the hopes that his father would relent but the sickness of the emperor during which he had named another prince to the throne confirmed him that his crime was not to be forgiven Mahommed though violent in the nobler passions of the human mind was in his private character generous friendly and humane He loved battle for its dangers he despised glory which was not purchased with peril He was even disappointed when an enemy fled and was heard to say That to pursue fugitives was only the business of a coward But he was unfit for the cabinet and rather a good partizan than a great general in the field He had boldness to execute any undertaking but he wanted prudence to plan Had his warm disposition been tempered by length of years he might have made a splendid figure But he was overset by the passions of youth before experience had poised his mind  War with Sewâji  The war with Sewâji the prince of Cokin on the coast of Malabar which had been for some time discontinued broke out this year with redoubled violence The attempt of the Maraja upon the life of Shaista though no proof could be carried home to that prince had induced Aurungzêbe to recal him with all his native forces  He would no longer trust his affairs in the hands of a man whose violent passions could not spare the life of a person with whom he lived in the habits of friendship A truce rather than a solid peace had been patched up with the enemy but their love of depredation overcame their public faith The prince of Cokin made incursions into the Decan and complaints of his hostilities were carried to Aurungzêbe Under the joint command of the Raja Joy Singh and Dilêre a considerable force was sent against the enemy He fled before them and they entered his country at his heels The strong holds of his dominions soon fell into the hands of the Imperialists Sewâji and his son surrendered themselves to Joy Singh and he sent them under an escort to Delhi to which city the emperor was now returned after his long absence in the north  Death of Shaw Jehân  The emperor Shaw Jehân after an imprisonment of seven years ten months and ten days died at Agra on the second of February The same disorder which had lost to him the empire was the cause of his death He languished under it for fifteen days and expired in the arms of his daughter Jehanâra his faithful friend and companion in his confinement Though Aurungzêbe had kept him with all imaginable caution in the citadel of Agra he was always treated with distinction tenderness and respect The ensigns of his former dignity remained to him he had still his palace and his garden of pleasure No diminution had been made in the number of his domestics He retained all his women singers dancers and servants of every kind The animals in which he formerly delighted were brought regularly into his presence He was gratified with the sight of fine horses wild beasts and birds of prey But he long continued melancholy nothing could make a recompence for his loss of power He for several years could not bear to hear the  name of Aurungzêbe without breaking forth into rage and even till his death none durst mention his son as emperor of Hindostan  Anecdotes  They had endeavoured to conceal from him the death of Dara but he knew it from the tears of Jehanâra The particulars of the melancholy fate of his favourite son made such an impression on his mind that absent in the violence of his passion he took his sword and rushed to the gate of the palace But it was shut and reminded him of his lost condition Though the rebellion of Suja had enraged him against that prince he lost his wrath in the superior crimes of Aurungzêbe He heard with eagerness every turn of fortune in Bengal and when the flight of Suja from that kingdom reached his ears he abstained from eating for two days He however comforted himself with the hopes of his return and eager for the revenge of his wrongs upon Aurungzêbe he attended with joy and satisfaction to the vague reports which were propagated concerning the appearance of his son in various provinces of the empire Accounts of the death of Suja came the year before his father's death He burst into a flood of tears  "Alas" said he "could not the Raja of Arracân leave one son to Suja to revenge his grandfather"  of his  Aurungzêbe whether from pity or design is uncertain took various means to sooth the melancholy of his father and to reconcile him to his own usurpation To express his tenderness for him was insult he therefore flattered his pride He affected to consult him in all important affairs He wrote him letters requesting his advice declaring that he reckoned himself only his vicegerent in the empire These artful expressions and the absence of every appearance of restraint on his conduct made at last an impression upon his mind But Aurungzêbe building  too much upon the success of his art had almost by his demand of the daughter of Dara for his son ruined all the progress which he had made His apology for what his father called an insult obliterated his indiscretion and his abstaining from force upon the occasion was esteemed by Shaw Jehân a favour which his pride forbade him to own  private life  Shaw Jehân brought up in the principles of his father and grandfather was destitute of all religion in his youth He had often been present when Jehangire who delighted in disputes on abstruse subjects called before him Indian Brahmins Christian priests and Mahommedan Mullas to argue for their respective faiths Jehangire who with his want of credulity on the subject of religion was weak in his understanding was always swayed by the last who spoke The Mahommedan who claimed the preeminence of being first heard came always off with the worst and the emperor observing no order of time with regard to the Christian and Indian was alternately swayed by both The Mulla saw the disadvantage of his dignity and being designedly late in his appearance one day he was heard after the priest Jehangire was perplexed for whom he should give his opinion He asked the advice of Shaw Jehân and that prince archly replied  "That he too was at a loss for whom to decide But as each have established the credit of their systems" said he "with a relation of miracles let them both be put to that test Let each take the book of his faith under his arm let a fire be kindled round him and the religion of him who shall remain unhurt shall be mine"  The Mulla looked pale at the decision and declared against this mode of proving his faith the priest knew the humane temper of the emperor and offered himself for the pile They were both dismissed But the misfortunes of Shaw Jehân rendered him devout in his latter days The Coran was  perpetually read in his presence and Mullas who relieved one another by turns were always in waiting  Grief of Aurungzêbe  The emperor when first he heard of his father's illness ordered his son Shaw Allum to set out with all expedition to Agra  "You have done no injury" said he "to my father and he may bless you with his dying breath But as for me I will not wound him with my presence lest rage might hasten death before his time"  The prince rode post to Agra but Shaw Jehân had expired two days before his arrival His body was deposited in the tomb of his favourite wife Mumtâza Zemâni with funeral solemnities rather decent than magnificent When the news of the death of his father was carried to Aurungzêbe he exhibited all the symptoms of unaffected grief He instantly set off for Agra and when he arrived in that city he sent a message to the princess Jehanâra to request the favour of being admitted into her presence The requests of an emperor are commands She had already provided for an interview and she received him with the utmost magnificence presenting him with a large golden bason in which were contained all the jewels of Shaw Jehân This magnificent offering together with the polite dexterity of the princess in excusing her own former conduct wrought so much on Aurungzêbe that he received her into his confidence which she ever after shared in common with her sister Rochinâra  Strange conduct  The most remarkable transaction of the ensuing year was the escape of the Raja Sewâji from Delhi and his slight through byroads and desarts to his own country The turbulent disposition of that prince and his depredatory incursions into the Imperial dominions in the Decan brought upon him the arms of Aurungzêbe under the conduct of Joy Singh and Dilêre Unfortunate in several battles he shut himself up in his principal fortress  and being reduced to extremities he threw himself upon the mercy of the enemy and was carried as has been already related to Delhi Upon his arrival he was ordered into the presence and commanded by the usher to make the usual obeisance to the emperor He refused to obey and looking scornfully upon Aurungzêbe exhibited every mark of complete contempt of his person The emperor was much offended at the haughty demeanor of the captive and he ordered him to be instantly carried away from his sight  and flight  The principal ladies of the haram and among them the daughter of Aurungzêbe saw from behind a curtain the behaviour of Sewâji She was struck with the handsomeness of his person and she admired his pride and haughty deportment The intrepidity of the man became the subject of much conversation Some of the nobles interceded in his behalf and the princess was warm in her solicitations at the feet of her father  "Though I despise pomp" said Aurungzêbe "I will have those honours which the refractory presume to refuse Power depends upon ceremony and state as much as upon abilities and strength of mind But to please a daughter whom I love I will indulge Sewâji with an abatement of some of that obeisance which conquered princes owe to the emperor of the Moguls"  A message was sent by the princess in the warmth of her zeal and the Raja without being consulted upon the measure was again introduced into the hall of audience  of Sewâji  When he entered the usher approached and commanded him to pay the usual obeisance at the foot of the throne  "I was born a prince" said he "and I know not how to act the part of a slave" "But the vanquished" replied Aurungzêbe "lose all their rights with their fortune The sword has made Sewâji  my servant and I am resolved to relinquish nothing of what the sword has given"  The Raja turned his back upon the throne the emperor was enraged He was about to issue his commands against Sewji when that prince spoke thus with a haughty tone of voice  "Give me your daughter in marriage and I will honour you as her father but fortune cannot deprive me of my dignity of mind which nothing shall extinguish but death"  The wrath of the emperor subsided at a request which he reckoned ridiculous and absurd He ordered him as a madman from his presence and gave him in charge to Fowlâd the directorgeneral of the Imperial camp He was closely consined in that officer's house but he found means to escape after some months in the disguise of a man who was admitted into his apartments with a basket of flowers  The Maraja discontented  The war with Sewâji proved fatal to the Maraja's influence with Aurungzêbe Naturally passionate deceitful and imperious he considered every order from the emperor an injury He had been gratified with the government of Guzerat for deserting the cause of the unfortunate Dara When the three years of his subaship were expired he received an Imperial mandate to repair with the army stationed in his province to the assistance of Shaista against Sewâji On the way it is said he entered into a correspondence with that prince being enraged to sind that the rich kingdom of Guzerat had been submitted to the government of Mohâbet It was from Sewâji that the Maraja received the assassins by whose means he had attempted to assassinate Shaista He however covered his crime with so much art that mankind in general believed that it was only a party of the enemy who had the boldness to surprise the general in his tent attributing to the known intrepidity of Sewâji what actually  proceeded from the address of Jesswint Singh The emperor who expected no good from an army commanded by two officers who disagreed in their opinions recalled them both as has been already related and patched up a temporary peace with the enemy Shaista disfigured and maimed with his wounds returned to court but the Maraja retired in disguist to his hereditary dominions  Shaista made governor of Bengal  Shaista at once as a reward for his services and a compensation for his misfortunes was raised to the government of Bengal which had been manged by deputy ever since the death of Jumla The affairs of the province stood in need of his presence The death of Jumla had encouraged the prince of Arracân to invade the eastern division of Bengal He possessed himself of all the country along the coast to the Ganges and maintained at Chittagong some Portuguese banditti as a barrier against the empire of the Moguls These robbers under the protection of the invader spread their ravages far and wide They scoured the coast with their piratical vessels and extended their depredations through all the branches of the Ganges The complaints of the oppressed province were carried to the throne and Shaista was not only commissioned to extirpate the pirates but even to penetrate with his arms into Arracân A generous regret for Suja joined issue with an attention to the public benefit in the mind of Aurungzêbe The cruelty exercised against the unfortunate prince was not less an object of revenge than the protection afforded to public robbers  Takes the island Sindiep  Shaista upon his arrival in the province sent a fleet and three thousand land forces under the command of Hassen Beg against the Raja of Arracân The fleet sailed from Dacca and falling down the great river surprised the forts of Jugdea and Allumgire  Nagur which the Raja had formerly dismembered from Bengal Shipping his land forces on board his fleet he set sail for the island of Sindiep which lies on the coast of Chittagong The enemy possessed in this island several strongholds into which they retired and defended themselves with great bravery The Mogul however in the space of a few weeks reduced Sindiep and took part of the fleet of Arracân Hassen's force being too small to act upon the continent with any prospect of success Shaista had by this time assembled ten thousand horse and foot at Dacca with the command of which he invested his son Ameid Chan He wrote in the mean time a letter to the Portuguese who were settled at Chittagong making them advantageous offers should they join his arms or even remain in a state of neutrality and threatening them with destruction should they aid the enemy  Gains over the Portuguese  The letter had the intended effect upon the Portuguese who began to fear the threatened storm They immediately entered into a negociation with Hassen Beg The Raja of Arracân was apprised of their intentions by one of their own party who betrayed their secret He prepared to take ample vengeance by putting them all to the sword The Portuguese in this critical situation ran to their boats in the night and set sail for the island of Sindiep where they were well received by Hassen He ordered them soon after to proceed to Bengal Shaista upon their arrival adhered to his former promise and gave them houses and lands He engaged many of them in his service and he took advantage of their experience in naval affairs by joining them with their armed vessels to the proposed expedition against Arracân  Invades Chittagong  Every thing being prepared for the invasion Ameid with his fleet consisting of about five hundred sail and a considerable body of horse and foot departed from Dacca in the beginning of the fair season and in the space of six days crossed the river Phenny which divides Chittagong from Bengal The troops of Arracân made a shew of opposition but they sled to the capital of the province which was about fifty miles distant They shut themselves up in the fort Ameid pursued them without delay The fleet sailed along the coast in sight of the army between the island of Sindiep and the shore When it had reached Comorea the fleet of Arracân consisting of about three hundred Ghorâbs and armed boats made its appearance A smart engagement ensued in which the enemy were repulsed with a considerable loss of men and thirtysix of their vessels Being reinforced the next day they prepared to renew the fight Ameid fearing the defeat of his fleet ordered it to hawl in close to the shore and having detached a thousand musqueteers with some great guns from his army posted them among the bushes behind the sleet  Capital of Chittagong taken and the province reduced  The enemy encouraged by the retreat of the Moguls from the open sea pursued them with great eagerness and began the attack within musquetshot of the land The Moguls defended themselves with resolution The enemy pressed on furiously and began to board their boats The whole sleet would have certainly been destroyed had not the detachment upon the shore advanced to the water's edge keeping up such a sire upon the enemy with guns and small arms as obliged them to put off to sea Many were however disabled in such a manner as not to escape and they were so much discouraged that they sled up the river and secured themselves behind the fort Ameid without delay laid siege to the place The enemy lost their  courage with their success They behaved in a dastardly manner The town was very strong and well supplied with artillery stores and provisions They however all evacuated it excepting fifty men who remained with the governor and surrendered at discretion The fugitives were pursued and two thousand being surrounded on a neighbouring mountain were taken and sold for slaves Ameid found twelve hundred and twentythree pieces of cannon in the place and a prodigious quantity of stores He named the town Islamabad and annexed the whole province to the kingdom of Bengal  CHAP

origin  THE emperor having by his address as well as by his crimes extricated himself from domestic hostilities was suddenly involved in a foreign war The Persians who with a preposterous negligence had remained quiet during the civil dissentions in India shewed a disposition to attack Aurungzêbe after his fortune and conduct had firmly established him on the throne But various reasons had induced Shaw Abâs the Second who with no mean abilities held then the seepter of Persia to avoid coming to extremities with the house of Timur when all its branches were in arms The unsuccessful expeditions against the unconquered tribes along the Indian ocean had drained his treasury and Mohâbet who remained in a state of neutrality in the  northern provinces of Hindostan kept an army of veterans in the field The other passions of Abâs were more violent than his ambition He seemed more anxious to preserve his dignity at home than to purchase fame by his arms aborad and had not his pride been wounded by an accident more than from any design on the side of Aurungzêbe that monarch might have enjoyed in tranquillity an empire which he had acquired by blood  of the  The death of Dara and the flight of Suja having given stability to the power of Aurungzêbe in the eyes of the princes of the north he had received in the fourth year of his reign congratulatory embassies from Tartary and Persia To return the compliment to Shaw Abâs Tirbiet Chan a man of high dignity was sent ambassador from the court of Delhi to Ispahan He was received with the ceremony and respect which was due to the representative of so great a prince as the emperor of Hindostan His credentials were read in the hall of audience in the presence of the nobility and the few presens which the suddenness of his departure from his court had permitted him to bring along with him to Abâs were accepted with condescension and expressions of satisfaction Tirbiet wrote an account of his reception to Delhi and the emperor ordered magnificent presents to be prepared and sent under an escort to Persia  quarrel  The care of furnishing the presents is vested in an office which bears some resemblance to our chancery having the power of ingrossing patents and of judging of their legality before they pass the seal of the empire Some presents had been at the same time ordered to be prepared for the prince of the Usbecs whom it was customary to address only by the title of Wali or Master of the Western Tartary The same clerk in the office made out  the inventory of the presents for both the princes and at the head of the list for Persia he called Shaw Abâs Wali or Master of Iran The inventory accompanied by a letter to the emperor was sent with the presents to Tirbiet and he without examining either demanded an audience of Abâs and placed both in his hands as he sat upon his throne Abâs though otherwise an excellent prince was much addicted to wine He was intoxicated when he received Tirbiet and with an impatience to know the particulars of the presents he threw first his eyes on the inventory When he read the Wali or Master of Persia he started in a rage from his throne and drew his dagger from his side The nobles shrunk back on either side and Tirbiet who stood on the steps which led up to the Imperial canopy retreated from the wrath of Abâs The emperor still continuing silent sat down Amazement was pictured in every countenance  with Persia  "Approach" said Abâs "ye noble Persians and hear the particulars of the presents sent by the EMPEROR OF THE WORLD"  alluding to the name of ALLUMGIRE which Aurungzêbe had assumed  "The EMPEROR OF THE WORLD to the MASTER OF PERSIA"  A general murmur spread around they all turned their eyes upon Tirbiet That lord began to fear for his life and Abâs saw his consternation  "Hence from my presence" said he "though I own not the title of Aurungzêbe to the world I admit his claim to your service Tell the impious son the inhuman brother the murderer of his family that though his crimes have rendered him master of Hindostan there is still a lord over Persia who detests his duplicity and despises his power Hence with these baubles let him purchase with them the favour of those who are not shocked at guilt like his but Abâs whose hands are clean shudders at the iniquity of a prince covered with the blood of his relations"  The emperor endeavours in vain  Tirbiet retired from the presence and wrote letters to Aurungzêbe The emperor of Persia in the mean time ordered every necessary preparation for war The troops stationed on the skirts of the empire were commanded to assemble new levies were made and a general ardour for an invasion of India ran through all the Persian dominions Aurungzêbe upon receiving the letters of Tirbiet wrote an immediate answer to that lord He laid the the whole blame on the inadvertence and ignorance of a clerk in office declaring in the most solemn manner that he never meant an affront to the illustrious house of Sefi  "The title of Allumgire" said he "is adopted from an ancient custom prevalent among the posterity of Timur It is only calculated to impress subjects with awe not to insult independent princes The presents which I sent are the best testimony of my respect for Shaw Abâs but if that prince is bent on war I am ready to meet him on my frontiers with an army Though I love peace with my neighbours I will not prostrate my dignity before their ungovernable passions"  to appease Shaw Abâs  Abâs whose choleric disposition was almost always inflamed with wine would not admit Tirbiet into his presence He sent an order to that lord to depart his dominions and his ambassador was to be the messenger of the unalterable resolves of Abâs to Aurungzêbe That prince when he had first received the letters of Tirbiet called his son Shaw Allum with twenty thousand horse from the Decan He ordered him immediately to the frontiers to watch the motions of Persia Abâs in the mean time having collected his army to the number of eighty thousand with an immense train of artillery advanced at their head into Chorassan Shaw Allum was reinforced by all the troops of the northern provinces He however received strict orders from his father not to risque the issue of a general action but to harass the enemy in his march He himself made preparations to take the field  An accident however happened which threw him into great perplexity and stopt his progress  Spies seized  Amir Chan the Imperial governor of the province of Cabul having seized four Tartars who had been sent as spies by Shaw Abâs to explore the state of the frontiers of India sent them prisoners to Delhi The emperor delivered them over for examination to Alimâd one of his principal nobles Alimâd having carried the Tartars to his own house began to ask them questions concerning their commission from the king of Persia They remained silent and he threatened them with the torture One of them immediately snatched a sword from the side of one of Alimâd's attendants and with one blow laid that lord dead at his feet Three more who were in the room were slain The Tartars arming themselves with the weapons of the dead issued forth dispersed themselves in the crowd and notwithstanding all the vigilance activity and promises of Aurungzêbe they were never heard of more The emperor naturally suspicious began to suppose that the Persian nobles in his service had secreted the spies He became dark and cautious placing his emissaries round the houses of those whom he most suspected  A letter interepted  Advices in the mean time arrived at Delhi that Abâs having finished his preparations was in full march with a wellappointed army toward India A letter was intercepted from that prince to Jaffier the visier a Persian by descent It appeared from the letter that a conspiracy was formed by all the Persian nobility in the service of India to betray Aurungzêbe into the hands of the enemy should he take the field The emperor was thrown into the utmost perplexity His rage for once got the better of his prudence He gave immediate orders to the cityguards to surround all the houses of the Persian nobility He issued forth at the same time  a proclamation that none of them should stir abroad upon pain of death He called the Mogul lords to a council he secured their fidelity by representing to them the urgency of the danger and contrary to his usual coolness and moderation he swore by the living God that should he find that there was any truth in the conspiracy he would put every one of the Persian nobility to the sword  which occasions Sept  The proclamation was scarce promulgated when Tirbiet arrived from Persia He presented himself before the emperor and informed him that at his departure he had been called before Shaw Abâs That prince after venting his rage against Aurungzêbe in very disrespectful terms concluded with telling the ambassador That as his master might soon be in want of swift horses to fly from his resentment he had ordered for him three hundred out of the Imperial stables whose speed would answer the expectations of his fears  "We shall soon have occasion to try" added Abâs "whether this CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD can defend the dominions which he has usurped in Hindostan"  Aurungzêbe was enraged beyond measure He commanded that the horses as a dreadful denunciation of his wrath should be killed before the gates of the conspirators The troops at the same time were ordered to stand to their arms in the seven military stations and to wait the signal of massacre which was to be displayed over the gate of the palace  a general consternation  A general consternation spread over the whole city The people retired to their houses and the streets were deserted A panic seized ali they saw a dreadful tempest gathering and they knew not where it was to fall An awful silence as a prelude to the storm prevailed The Persians were numerous and warlike the emperor implacable and dark The eyes and  ears of men were turned to every quarter The doors were all shut There was a kind of silent commotion a dreadful interval of suspence Ideal sounds were taken for the signal of death and the timorous seemed to hug themselves in the visionary security of their houses The Persians had in the mean time collected their dependents They stood armed in the courts before their respective houses and were prepared to defend their lives or to revenge their deaths with their valour  at Delhi  Things remained for two days in this awful situation Aurungzêbe himself became for the first time irresolute He was alike fearful of granting pardon and of inflicting punishment There was danger on both sides and his invention fertile as it was in expedients could point out no resource He endeavoured by promises and fair pretences to get the principals into his hands But they had taken the alarm and no one would trust himself to the clemency of an enraged despot Upon the first intelligence of the conspiracy the emperor wrote to his sister Jehanâra who resided at Agra to come with all expedition to Delhi The Persian nobles he knew had been attached to Shaw Jehân to whose favour they had owed their promotion in the empire and he hoped that they would listen to the advice of the favourite daughter of the prince whom they loved He himself remained in the mean time sullen and dark he spoke to none his whole soul being involved in thought  Advice of the Mogul lords  Taër and Cubâd two of the most powerful most popular and respectable of the Mogul nobles presented themselves at length before the emperor They represented to him that it would be both unjust and impolitic to sacrisice the lives of so many great men to bare suspicion for that no proofs of their guilt had hitherto appeared but from the hands of an enemy who might  have devised this method to sow division and dissention in a country which he proposed to invade That the Persian nobles had become powerful in the state from their high military commands their great wealth the immense number of their followers that the common danger had united them that the attack upon them would not prove a massacre but a civil war That the Patan nobility warlike numerous disaffected still hankering after their ancient domination of which they had been deprived by the folly of their princes as much as by the valour of the Moguls would not fail to throw their weight into the scale of the Persians and upon the whole they were of opinion that peaceable measures should be adopted toward domestic traitors at least till the danger of foreign war should be removed  in favour of the Persian nobles  The arguments of the two lords had their due weight with the emperor He declared himself for lenient measures but how to effect a reconciliation with honour to himself was a matter of difficulty The princess Jehanâra arrived in the mean time from Agra She had travelled from that city to Delhi on an elephant in less than two days though the distance is two hundred miles Her brother received her with joy After a short conference she presented herself in her chair at the door of the visier's house The gates were immediately thrown open and she was ushered into the apartments of the women The visit was a mark of such confidence and so great an honour in the eyes of the visier that leaving the princess to be entertained by the ladies he hastened without even seeing her himself or waiting for her request to the emperor When he entered the hall of audience he prostrated himself before the throne Aurungzêbe descended took him in his arms and embraced him in the most friendly manner He then put the letter which was the cause of the disturbance in the visier's hand  who are reconciled  Jaffier with a countenance expressing that serenity which accompanies innocence ran over the letter Aurungzêbe marking his features as he read He gave it back and positively denied his ever having given the least reason to Shaw Abâs for addressing him in that manner He expatiated on his own services upon those of his ancestors who had resided in Hindostan ever since the time of the emperor Humaioon He represented the improbability of his entertaining any designs against a prince who had raised him to the first rank among his subjects and had left him nothing to hope or to wish for but the continuance of his favour and the stability of his throne He concluded with a pertinent question  "What could I expect in Persia equal to the high office of visier in Hindostan Let my common sense be an argument of my innocence and let not the emperor by an opinion of my guilt declare to the world that I am deprived of reason"  with the emperor  Aurungzêbe was convinced by the speech of Jaffier and he wondered from whence had proceeded his own fears By way of doing him honour he ordered him to be clothed with a magnificent dress at the same time directing him to command all the Persian nobles to make their immediate appearance in the hall of audience When they were all assembled the emperor mounted the throne and after they had paid the usual compliments he addressed them in a long speech He excused his proceedings by reading the letter of Abâs and he reproved them gently for their contumacy in not obeying his orders He argued that the power of a monarch ceases when his commands are disputed and that the indignity thrown upon him by their disobedience touched him more than their supposed treason  "But" continued he "a prince though the representative of God is liable to error and deception To own that I have been  partly in the wrong carries in itself an excuse for you Forget my mistake and I promise to forgive your obstinancy Rest satisfied of my favour as I am determined to rely upon your gratitude and loyalty My father and even myself have made you what you are let not the hands which raised you so high repent of the work which they have made"  Insolence of Amîn Chan  The speech of the emperor seemed to be well received by all the Persians excepting Mahommed Amîn the son of the famous Jumla That lord haughty and daring in his disposition was dissatisfied with the conduct of the visier hurt at the submission of his countrymen and piqued at the emperor's latter words He looked sternly upon Aurungzêbe and said in a scornful manner  "Since you have been pleased to pardon us for offences which we did not commit we can do no less than forget the errors which you have made"  The emperor pretending that he did not hear Amîn distinctly ordered him to repeat his words which he did twice in a haughty and high tone of voice The eyes of Aurungzêbe kindled with rage He seized a sword which lay by his side on the throne He looked around to see whether any of the nobles prepared to resent the affront offered to his dignity They stood in silent astonishment He sat down and his fury beginning to abate he talked to the visier about the best manner of carrying on the Persian war  Aurungzêbe takes the field  The minds of the people being settled from the expected disturbances Aurungzêbe prepared to take the field The army had already assembled in the neighbourhood of Delhi and the Imperial tents were pitched on the road toward the north He marched in a few days at the head of a great force but the storm which he feared dissipated without falling When he was within a few miles of Lahore expresses arrived from his son who  commanded the army of observation on the frontiers of Persia with intelligence that Shaw Abâs who had languished for some time under a neglected disease expired in his camp on the twentyfifth of September This accident of which a more ambitious monarch than Aurungzêbe might have taken advantage served only to change the resolutions of that prince from war He considered that nature seemed to have designed the two countries for separate empires from the immense ridge of mountains which divide them from one another by an almost impassable line  Death and character of Shaw Abâs  Shaw Abâs was a prince of abilities and when rouzed fond of expedition and delighting in war He was just in his decisions mild in his temper and affable in his conversation Destitute of prejudices of every kind he made no distinction of countries none of systems of religion He encouraged men of worth of every nation they had access to his person he heard and redressed their grievances and rewarded their merit He was however jealous of his prerogative and he was determined to be obeyed He could forgive the guilty upon being convinced of their contrition but an insult on his dignity he would never forgive His passions were naturally strong he broke often forth like a flash of lightning but when he was most agitated a calm was near and he seemed to be ashamed of the trifles which ruffled his temper He loved justice for its own sake and through his excesses in wine gave birth sometimes to folly they never gave rise to an act of injustice He was fond of the company of women and his love of variety produced the distemper of which he died  Peace with Persia  Upon the death of Shaw Abâs his uncle remained in the command of the Persian army He sent a messenger to Aurungzêbe acquinting him of the death of his nephew and that he left him to chuse either peace or war The emperor returned sor answer  That his own empire was ample and that all he wanted was to defend it from insult and invasion That the disrespectful words of Abâs vanished with his life for conscious of his own integrity and power that he neither feared the abuse nor dreaded the arms of any prince He condoled with the family of Sheick Sefi for the loss of a monarch whose most exceptionable action was his unprovoked attempt upon India Aurungzêbe however left a powerful army on his frontiers The Persians might be induced to derive advantage from the immense preparations which they had made and he resolved to trust nothing to their moderation The prince Shaw Allum was in the mean time recalled to Delhi The emperor full of circumspection and caution in all his actions was resolved to remove temptation from his son He feared that an army unemployed in a foreign war might be converted into an instrument of ambition at home Shaw Allum copied his father's moderation and selfdenial upon every occasion and he therefore was not to be trusted  War in Bijapour  During the alarm of the Persian war the tributary sovereign of Bijapour began to shew a disrespect for the Imperial mandates and though he did not absolutely rebel his obedience was full of coldness and delay Dilêre Chan by orders from the court of Delhi led an army against the refractory tributary He laid waste the country and besieged the prince in his capital Adil Shaw was soon reduced to extremities for want of provisions and he was upon the point of surrendering himself at diseretion when orders arrived from the emperor in the camp of Dilêre to break up the siege and to return immediately with the army to Delhi These unseasonable orders proceeded from the jealousy of Shaw Allum He knew that Dilêre was in the interest of his younger brother and he was afraid that a conquest of such splendor would give him too much weight in the empire He had insinuated  therefore to his father that Dilêre had entered into a treasonable correspondence with the enemy Aurungzêbe was deceived and the siege was raised  Designs of the prince Shaw Allum  Shaw Allum who had returned to the Decan resided in the city of Aurungabâd To disappoint Dilêre in his prospect of fame was not the only view of the prince He meditated a revolt and he was afraid of Dilêre His father's orders were favourable to his wishes He had received instructions from court to seize the person of the suspected lord should he shew any marks of disaffection or to subdue him by force of arms should he appear refractory Thus far the designs of Shaw Allum succeeded Dilêre apprized of the prince's schemes broke up the siege though with regret as the place was on the point of surrendering He moved toward Delhi with a disappointed army of thirty thousand Patan horse and the like number of infantry  to rebel  Dilêre arriving within six miles of Aurungabâd encamped with his army in an extensive plain The prince lay under the walls of that city with eighty thousand men Dilêre sent a messenger to Shaw Allum excusing himself for not waiting upon him in person that evening but he promised to present himself in the tent of audience by the dawn of next morning The prince called a council of his principal officers who had already sworn on the Coran to support him with their lives and fortunes The Maraja who was never happy but when he was hatching mischief against Aurungzêbe was present This prince proposed that when Dilêre came into the presence they should lay open to him their whole design against the emperor that in case of his appearing refractory he should instantly be dispatched as a dangerous enemy Though Shaw Allum did not altogether approve of the Maraja's violence he consented that Dilêre should be  seized and they broke up their deliberations with that resolution  Pursues Dilêre  Dilêre who was no stranger to the conspiracy suspected the design against his person He was also informed by his friends in the camp that the principal officers were shut up in council with the prince He struck his tents in the night and marching on silently took a circuit round the other side of the city and when morning appeared he was heard of above thirty miles from Aurungabâd on the road to Delhi The prince being informed of the flight of Dilêre was violently transported with rage He marched suddenly in pursuit of the fugitive but he was so much retarded by his numbers which including the followers of the camp amounted to two hundred thousand men that in a few days he found that Dilêre had outstripped him above fifty miles He selected a part of his army and leaving the heavy baggage behind continued the pursuit with great vivacity His officers did not however second the warmth of the prince They were afraid of the veteran troops of Dilêre and threw every obstacle in the way which could retard their own march  Emperor alarmed  Dilêre in the mean time apprized Aurungzebe by repeated expresses of the revolt of his son The Imperial standard was immediately erected without the walls and the emperor himself took the sield the very day on which he received the letters He took the rout of Agra with great expedition He arrived in that city in three days and he immediately detached a force to take possession of the important pass of Narwâr Orders were at the same time sent to Dilêre to march to Ugein the capital of Malava and there to join the troops of the province Reinforced by these he was directed to encamp behind the Nirbidda which divides the Decan from the rest of India and there  to stop the progress of the prince Dilêre with his usual activity complied with the orders and presented formidable lines mounted with artillery at the fords of the river  Prince drops his d  ign    The prince apprized of the strong position of Dilêre and the rapid preparations of Aurungzêbe returned toward Aurungabâd He wrote from that city letters to his father He pretended that he had only executed the orders of the emperor in pursuing Dilêre Aurungzêbe seemed satisfied with this excuse His son was formidable and he resolved by degrees to divest him of his dangerous power A rebellion was thus begun and ended without shedding blood The art of the father was conspicuous in the son They looked upon one another with jealousy and fear and it was remarkable that when both were in the field and ready to engage they had carried their politeness so far as not to utter on either side a single word of reproach The emperor himself notwithstanding his preparations affected to say to his nobles that he was perfectly convinced of the loyalty of his son  Dilêre rewarded  The true sentiments of Aurungzébe however appeared in the distinguishing honours which he bestowed on Dilêre That lord had rendered eminent services to the empire In his march to the Decan against Adil Shaw he had reduced some refractory Rajas in the mountains who having joined in a confederacy resused to pay their tribute He deviated from his rout into the country of Bundela and attacked in his territory the Raja of Hoda The spoils of the enemy made ample amends for the tribute which had been withheld Near two millions in jewels and coin were remitted by Dilêre to the Imperial treasury The tribute of the reduced princes was increased and the successful general himself became rich at the expence of his foes Aurungzêbe added honours to his wealth and without throwing any reflections on  his son he publicly thanked the man who had so gallantly opposed his designs  Rebellion  The general peace which had been established in the empire by the return of Shaw Allum to his duty was in some degree disturbed by an insurrection of the wild barbarians of the north The Afgan tribe of Eusoph Zehi who possess the heads of the Attoc and the Nilâb rushed down from their mountains like a torrent with thirty thousand men They spread terror and devastation over all the plains of Punjâb having invested their chief with the ensigns of royalty under the name of Mahommed Shaw This prince in the manifestoes which he dispersed in his march averred his own descent from Alexander the Great and a daughter of the king of Transoxiana This genealogy was probably fabulous but the Afgans have high claims on antiquity A literary people like the Arabs and by their mountains their poverty and the peculiar ferocity of their manners secured from conquest they have preserved among them many records of ancient authority and undoubted credit  of the Afgans  Mahommed Shaw's power of doing mischief was less problematical than his high descent The news of his ruinous progress was carried to Aurungzêbe He ordered the governor of the adjoining districts to harass the enemy till troops should march to his aid The name of this officer was Camil Impatient of the insults of the enemy he resolved to attack them with ten thousand Geikers whom he had collected from their hills round his standard He directed his march toward the ferry of Haran on the Nilâb with a determined resolution to give battle to the rebels The Afgans equally desirous of engaging crossed the river with ten thousand of their best troops and advanced impetuously against Camil Morâd who commanded the van of the Imperial militia sell in  sword in hand with the enemy before they had formed They were thrown into confusion but they obstinately kept their ground and began to surround Morâd Camil in the mean time advanced with the main body The battle became obstinate and doubtful Mahommed behaved with a spirit worthy of his new dignity The rest of his army hastened to his relief but before their arrival he was defeated and he involved the whole in his own flight The Nilâb unfortunately for the fugitives was four miles in their rear They were pursued by Camil to the banks They plunged into the river More were drowned than fell by the sword The rest were dissipated and the insurrection seemed to be entirely quashed  Camil after this signal victory entered the country of the rebels with his army The governor of Cabul had in the mean time detached five thousand men under his lieutenant Shumshîr to oppose the Afgans Camil sat down before their strong holds They collected an army at the heads of their valleys and marched down upon the Imperialists Their troops were now more numerous than before but not less unfortunate They fell in upon their march with Shumshir whose army had been augmented to fifteen thousand The battle was obstinate and the Afgans derived their own defeat from their impetuous valour Strangers to regularity and command they rushed without any form into the heart of the enemy and being singly overcome all at last took to flight They left some thousands dead on the spot the survivors dissipated themselves in their mountains  quashed  The inhabitants of the plain country who dreaded the incursions of these rude mountaineers sent deputations to the emperor to request a force sufficient to extirpate the rebels In consequence of this application ten thousand chosen troops were ordered into  the mountains under the conduct of Mahommed Amîn the paymastergeneral of the forces Camil and Shumshîr before his arrival had joined their forces They marched up through the principal valley and were met by a third army of Afgans The rebels averse to the delays of war offered battle upon their first appearance before the Imperialists The action was bloody Mahommed Shaw the pretended descendant of Alexander behaved with a bravery not unworthy of his ancestor He led his mountaineers repeatedly to the charge Fired with the gallant behaviour of their prince they were not to be driven from the field The Imperialists having suffered much were upon the point of giving way when a report that the prince was slain induced the common soldiers among the rebels to fly The officers were left in their posts alone They formed themselves in squadrons but they were surrounded and three hundred chiefs came into the hands of the enemy The flower of the rebel army fell in this action Amîn in the mean time arriving pursued the fugitives through all their almost inaccessible vallies and levelled every thing with the ground but the rocks into which a few unfortunate Afgans found a refuge from the swords of the victors  A general peace  A general peace was now established over all the empire Aurungzêbe to whom business was amusement employed himself in making salutary regulations for the benefit of his subjects He loved money because it was the foundation of power and he encouraged industry and commerce as they encreased his revenue He himself in the mean time led the life of a hermit in the midst of a court unequalled in its splendour The pomp of state he found from experience was not necessary to establish the power of a prince of abilities and he avoided its trouble as he liked not its vanity He however encouraged magnificence among his officers at court and his deputies in the provinces The ample allowance  granted to them from the revenue was not they were made to understand to be hoarded up for their private use  "The money is the property of the empire" said Aurungzêbe "and it must be employed in giving weight to those who execute its laws"  Magnificent reception of the king of Bucharia  An opportunity offered itself to his magnificence and generosity in the beginning of the eleventh year of his reign Abdalla king of the Lesser Bucharia lineally descended from the great Zingis having abdicated the throne to his son Alîris advanced into Tibet in his way to Mecca He sent a message to Aurungzêbe requesting a permission for himself and his retinue to pass through India The emperor ordered the governor of Cashmire to receive the royal pilgrim with all imaginable pomp and to supply him with every article of luxury and convenience at the public expence The governors of districts were commanded to attend Abdalla from province to province with all their followers The troops in every place through which he was to pass were directed to pay him all military honours and in this manner he advanced to Delhi and was received by the emperor at the gates of the city Having remained seven months in the capital he was conducted with the same pomp and magnificence to Surât where he embarked for Arabia  CHAP VII  ObservationsEducation of Eastern princesGenius of AurungzêbeHis attention to justiceContempt of

the morningnoonand eveningObservations  Observations  THOUGH History loses half her dignity in descending to unimportant particulars when she brings information she cannot fail even in her most negligent dress to please The singular good fortune and abilities of Aurungzêbe stamp a kind of consequence on every circumstance which contributed to raise him to a throne which his merit deserved to possess without a crime The line of his public conduct in rising to the summit of ambition has already been followed with some precision but his private life which prepared him for the greatness at which he had now arrived remains still in the shade To bring forward the objects which have hitherto lain distant and dim behind will heighten the features of the picture and perhaps recommend it to those who wish to see the glare of great transactions tempered with anecdote  Unfavourable education  The education of the natives of Asia is confined that of young men of distinction always private They are shut up in the haram from infancy till their seventh or eighth year or if they are permitted to come abroad it is only under the care of eunuchs a race of men more effeminate than the women whom they guard Children therefore imbibe in early youth little female cunning and dissimulation with a tincture of all those inferior passions and prejudices which are improper for public life The indolence natural to the climate is encouraged by example They loll whole days on silken sophas they learn to make nosegays of false flowers with taste to bathe in rosewater to anoint themselves with persumes whilst the nobler faculties of the soul lose their vigour through want of cultivation  of eastern princes  Princes are permitted at ten years of age to appear in the hall of audience A tutor attends them who imposes upon them no restraint They receive little benefit from his instructions and they advance frequently into life without having their minds embued with any considerable knowledge of letters They are married to some beautiful woman at twelve and it cannot be supposed that a boy in possession of such an enchanting plaything as a young wife will give much attention to the dry study of grammar The abilities of the princes of the house of Timur it must be confessed extricated when they advanced in life their minds from the effects of this ruinous mode of passing youth The most of them were men of letters and given to inquiry but their attention to the education of their children could not altogether supersede the inherent prejudices of their country  Early genius of Aurungzebe  Shaw Jehân was extremely anxious in training up his sons in all the literature and knowledge of the East He delivered each of them into the hands of men of virtue as well as of letters he raised  the tutors to dignities in the state to impress awe upon their pupils and to induce them to listen to their precepts Aurungzêbe however was not fortunate in his master His genius flew before the abilities of the teacher and the latter to cover his own ignorance employed the active mind of the prince in difficult and unprofitable studies Being naturally remarkably serious he gave up his whole time to application The common amusements of children gave him no pleasure He was frequently known whilst yet he was very young to retire from the puerile buffoonery of his attendants to the dry and difficult study of the Persian and Arabic languages His assiduity prevailed over the dulness of his tutor and he made a progress far beyond his years  His attention to justice  Time had established into an almost indispensible duty that the emperor with his assessors the principal judges was to sit for two hours every day in the hall of justice to hear and decide causes Shaw Jehân who took great delight in promoting justice frequently exceeded the usual time Aurungzêbe while yet but twelve years of age stood constantly near the throne and he made remarks with uncommon sagacity upon the merits of the causes which were agitated before his father The emperor seemed highly pleased at abilities which afterwards ruined his own power He often asked the opinion of his son for amusement upon points of equity and he frequently pronounced sentence in the very terms of Aurungzêbe's decision  contempt of pomp and flattery  When he was in his early youth appointed to the government of a province he was obliged by his office to imitate though in miniature the mode of the court He had his hall of audience he presided in his court of justice he represented royalty in all its forms except in its pomp and magnificence to which the natural austerity of his manners had rendered him an enemy He exhihibited  upon every occasion an utter aversion to flatterers he admitted not into his presence men of dissolute manners The first he thought insulted his judgment the latter disgraced him as the guardian of the morality as well as of the property of the people Musicians dancers and singers he banished from his court as foes to gravity and virtue Mimics actors and buffoons he drove from his palace as an useless race of men  Affects plainness in dress  His dress was always plain and simple He wore upon festival days only cloth of gold adorned with jewels He however changed his dress twice aday being remarkably cleanly in his person When he rose in the morning he plunged into the bath and then retired for a short time to prayers Religion suited the serious turn of his mind and he at last became an enthusiast through habit In his youth he never stirred abroad on Friday and should he happen to be in the field or on a hunting party he suspended all business and diversions Zealous for the faith of Mahommed he rewarded proselytes with a liberal hand though he did not chuse to persecute those of different persuasions in matters of religion  His austerity and love  He carried his austerity and regard for morality into the throne He made strict laws against vices of every kind He was severe against adultery and fornication and against a certain unnatural crime he issued various edicts In the administration of justice he was indefatigable vigilant and exact He sat almost every day in judgment and he chose men of virtue as well as remarkable for their knowledge in the law for his assessors When the cause appeared intricate it was left to the examination of the bench of judges in their common and usual court They were to report upon such causes as had originated before the throne and the emperor  after weighing their reasons with caution pronounced judgment and determined the suit  of justice  In the courts of the governors of provinces and even often on the benches on which his deputies sat in judgment he kept spies upon their conduct Though these were known to exist their persons were not known The princes his sons as well as the other viceroys were in constant terror nor durst they exercise the least degree of oppression against the subject as every thing found its way to the ears of the emperor They were turned out of their office upon the least wellfounded complaint and when they appeared in the presence the nature of their crime was put in writing into their hands Stript of their estates and honours they were obliged to appear every day at court as an example to others and after being punished for some time in this manner according to the degree of their crime they were restored to favour the most guilty were banished for life  His clemency  Capital punishments were almost totally unknown under Aurungzêbe The adherents of his brothers who contended with him for the empire were freely pardoned when they laid down their arms When they appeared in his presence they were received as new subjects not as inveterate rebels Naturally mild and moderate through policy he seemed to forget that they had not been always his friends When he appeared in public he clothed his features with a complacent benignity which pleased all Those who had trembled at his name from the same of his rigid justice when they saw him found themselves at ease They could express themselves in his presence with the greatest freedom and composure His affability gave to them considence and he secured to himself their esteem by the strict impartiality of his decisions  Knowledge of affairs  His long experience in business together with the acuteness and retentiveness of his mind rendered him master even of the detail of the affairs of the empire He remembered the rents he was thoroughly acquainted with the usages of every particular district He was wont to write down in his pocketbook every thing that occurred to him through the day He formed a systematical knowledge of every thing concerning the revenue from his notes to which upon every necessary occasion he recurred The governors of the provinces and even the collectors in the districts when he examined either on the state of ther respective departments were afraid of misrepresentation or ignorance The first ruined them for ever the latter turned them out of their offices  Public buildings  His public buildings partook of the temper of his own mind They were rather useful than splendid At every stage from Cabul to Aurungabâd from Guzerat to Bengal through the city of Agra he built houses for the accommodation of travellers These were maintained at the public expence They were supplied with wood with utensils of cookery with a certain portion of rice and other provisions The houses which his predecessors had erected on byroads were repaired bridges were built on the small rivers and boats furnished for passing the large  Encouragement to letters  In all the principal cities of India the emperor founded universities in every inferior town he erected schools Masters paid from the treasury were appointed for the instruction of youth Men of known abilities honour and learning were appointed to examine into the progress which the learners made and to prevent indolence and inattention in the masters Many houses for the reception of the poor and maimed were erected which were endowed with a revenue from the crown The emperor in the mean time collected all the books which could  be found on every subject and after ordering many copies of each to be made public libraries were formed for the convenience of learned men who had access to them at pleasure He wrote often to the learned in every corner of his dominions with his own hand He called them to court and placed them according to their abilities in offices in the state those who were versed in the commentaries on the Coran were raised to the dignity of judges in the different courts of justice  Skill and courage in war  Aurungzêbe was as experienced in war as he was in the arts of peace Though his personal courage was almost unparalleled he always endeavoured to conquer more by stratagem than by force To succeed by art threw honour upon himself to subdue by power acquired to others fame Such was his coolness in action that at the rising and setting sun the times appointed for prayer he never neglected to attend to that duty though in the midst of battle Devout to excess he never engaged in action without prayer and for every victory he ordered a day of thanksgiving and one of festivity and joy  Learning  In the art of writing Aurungzêbe excelled in an eminent degree He wrote many letters with his own hand he corrected always the diction of his secretaries He never permitted a letter of business to be dispatched without critically examining it himself He was versed in the Persian and Arabic he wrote the language of his ancestors the Moguls and all the various dialects of India In his diction he was concise and nervous and he reduced all dispatches to a brevity and precision which prevented all misconstruction and perplexity  Skill  Though not remarkable for his strength of body he was extremely active in the exercises of the field He was an excellent  archer he threw the lance with grace and he was so good a horseman that few men durst follow him in the chace He understood the use of firearms so well that he shot deer on full speed from his horse When he wandered over the country in pursuit of game he did not forget the concerns of the state He examined the nature of the soil he enquired even of common labourers concerning its produce He understood and therefore encouraged agriculture He issued an edict that the rents should not be raised on those who by their industry had improved their farms He mentioned in the edict that such practice was at once unjust and impolitic that it checked the spirit of improvement and impoverished the state  "And what joy" said he "can Aurungzêbe have in possessing wealth in the midst of public distress"  Chastity  Though he entertained many women according to the custom of his country it was only for state He contented himself with his lawful wives and these only in succession when one either died or became old He spent very little time in the apartments of his women He rose every morning at the dawn of day and went into the bathingchamber which communicated with a private chapel to which he retired for half an hour to prayers Returning into his apartments from chapel he spent half an hour in reading some book of devotion and then went into the haram to dress He entered the chamber of justice generally about seven o'clock and there sat with the judges read petitions and decided causes till nine Justice was dispensed in a summary manner and rewards and punishments were immediate the disputes which were not clear having been already weighed by the judges in their own court  Accessibleness to all  The people in general had access into the chamber of justice and there they had an opportunity of laying their grievances and distresses before their sovereign Aurungzêbe ordered always a sum of money to be placed by his side on the bench and he relieved the necessitous with his own hand Large sums were in this manner expended every day and as the court was open to all the unfortunate found invariably a resource in the Imperial bounty  Amusements  The emperor retired at nine to breakfast and continued for an hour with his family He then came forth into a balcony which faced the great square He sat there to review his elephants which passed before him in gorgeous caparisons He sometimes amused himself with the battles of tygers and leopards sometimes with those of gazzelles elks and a variety of ferocious animals On particular days squadrons of horse passed in review The fine horses of his own stables were also brought at times before him with all their magnificent trappings mounted by his grooms who exhibited various feats of horsemanship The balcony in which he sat was called THE PLACE OF PRIVACY as it looked from the haram and the ladies saw every thing from behind their screens of gauze  His mode of receiving  An hour being spent at this amusement the emperor generally about eleven o'clock made his appearance in the great hall of audience There all the nobles were ranged before the throne in two lines according to their dignity Ambassadors viceroys commanders of armies Indian princes and officers who had returned from various services were introduced in the following sorm The Meer Hajîb or the lord in waiting ushers each into the presence At the distance of twenty yards from the throne the person to be presented is commanded by one of the macebearers  to bow three times very low raising his hand each time from the ground to his forehead The macebearer at each bow calls out aloud that such a person salutes the EMPEROR OF THE WORLD He is then led up between the two lines of the nobles to the foot of the steps which ascend to the throne and there the same ceremony is again performed He then moves slowly up along the steps and if he is a man of high quality or much in favour he is permitted to make his offering to the emperor himself who touches one of the gold roupees and it being laid down the lord of the privypurse receives the whole The emperor sometimes speaks to the person introduced when he does not the person retires keeping his face toward the sovereign and performs the same ceremonies at the same places as before  and creating the nobles  The introduction of an officer when he is raised into the rank of Omrahs is the same with that already described When he retires from the steps of the throne the emperor gives his commands aloud to clothe him with a rich dress ordering a sum of money not exceeding a lack of roupees to be laid before him He is at the same time presented with two elephants one male and one female caparisoned two horses with rich furniture a travelling bed elegantly decorated a complete dress if once worn by his Imperial majesty the more honourable a sword studded with diamonds a jewel for the front of his turban The ensigns of his rank are also laid before him fifes drums colours silver maces silver bludgeons spears the tails of peacocks silver fish silver dragons with his titles engraved with a parchment containing his patent of dignity and the Imperial grant of an estate  The business of the morning  The hall of audience in the city of Delhi was called Chelsittoon or Hall of Forty Pillars as the name imports In the  square which opened to the hall the cavaliers or soldiers of fortune who wanted to be employed in the Imperial service presented themselves completely armed on horeback with their troop of dependents The emperor sometimes reviewed them and after they had exhibited their feats of military dexterity before him they were received into pay The Mansebdârs or the lower rank of nobility presented themselves in another square artizans with their most curious inventions occupied a third and they were encouraged according to the utility and elegance of their work The huntsmen filled a fourth court They presented their game consisting of every species of animals and beasts common in the empire  noon and evening  Aurungzêbe about one o'clock retired into the Gussel Châna or bathingchamber into which the great officers of state were only admitted There affairs of inferior concern such as the disposal of offices were transacted At half past two o'clock he retired into the haram to dine He spent an hour at table and then in the hot season slumbered on a sopha for half an hour He generally appeared at four in the balcony above the great gate of the palace A mob of all kinds of people assembled there before him some to claim his bounty others to prefer complaints against the officers of the crown He retired at six into the chapel to prayers and in half an hour he entered the Gussel Châna into which at that hour the members of the cabinet were only admitted He there took their advice upon all the important and secret affairs of government and from thence orders were issued to the various departments of the state He was often detained till it was very late in this council as conversation was mixed with business but about nine he generally retired into the haram  Observation  Such is the manner in which Aurungzêbe commonly passed his time but he was not always regular He appeared not  some days in the chamber of justice and other days there was no public audience When the particular business of any department required extraordinary attention that of others was from necessity postponed Particular days were set apart for auditing the accounts of the officers of the revenue some for reviewing the troops and some were dedicated to festivity Though Aurungzêbe bore all the marks of an enthusiast in his private behaviour he did not stop the progress of business by many days of thanksgiving for he often declared that without using the means it were presumptuous to hope for any benefit from prayer  APPENDIX  ADVERTISEMENT  THE nature of a government is best understood from the power which it communicates to its officers The Author of the preceding History has thought proper to subjoin to his Work the forms of commissions granted by the emperor to his servants in the provinces They will serve to justify his observations on the policy of the Imperial house of Timur who were too jealous of their own authority to commit their power without reservation to the hands of their deputies The Despot derived the stability of his throne from the opinion which the people formed of his paternal care of their happiness and prosperity Wanton oppression is an act of folly not of true despotism which leaves to mankind a few rights which render them worthy of being commanded  APPENDIX NUMBER Tenor of a NABOB'S FIRMAN  THE mandate of the emperor the shadow of
