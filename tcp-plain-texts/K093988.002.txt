 A SERIES of Genuine LETTERS BETWEEN HENRY AND FRANCES  Felices ter ampliùs  Quos irrupta tenet copula nec malis  Divulsus querimoniis  Supremâ citiùs solvet amor die  HOR Lib I Od  VOL II  LONDON Printed for W JOHNSTON in St  Paul's ChurchYard    MDCCLVII  A SERIES of LETTERS BETWEEN  HENRY  and  FRANCES    LETTER CLXXX  My Dear  FANNY  Elton  _I SET off in  Thursday  's Stage the th Instant and beg you will get some Lodging for me  I received a Letter from you on  Saturday  last and another this Day And first of the first I am very glad you got safe to Town But why all this Plaintiveness Why will you eternally doubt my Tenderness for  you Observe that there is a childish and a manly one Perhaps I am a Child in every thing else and then one may suspect if I do not appear so in this it is because I want the Feeling But if you will allow me to be a Man in other Things why will you not judge of me all together If my Letters and Behaviour differ it is because one proceeds from the Sentiments I have toward you and the other from a certain Nonchalance or Want of Earnestness in my Manners which has been often misinterpreted  What you say with regard to Love and Friendship is certainly just as it is ingenious also The Pleasures of those Affections are the greatest Enjoyments of Life How careful ought we then to be to cherish them in their proper Season which does not extend even so far as you mention And yet we have a long Life to labour through after that Aera which would lag heavily along without those Helps  The Opinion of a continued Converse after Death has been often disputed and by me too But I will come over to your Sentiment for this conclusive Reason We are to be happy after Death Providence always acts by the most continued uniform and constant Means Love and Friendship are the highest Enjoyments of Mortals They are likewise in the Series of Virtue Would it not be Caprice in Providence  to give us new Objects and strange Affections when we can be made as happy by the Improvement of the former as by the Enjoyment of any other I will never change my Opinion more on this Subject for your Sake my sweet Girl whose Charms pardon the Quibble I wish to enjoy both above and below and in that Wish I live and in that Hope I die  Your's all your's and only your's  Henry  LETTER CLXXXI  FRANCES  to  HENRY    THOUGH I have been ever since I came to Town overwhelmed with Business I cannot say that I am displeased at this Embarras du Monde as it prevents my having Leisure to indulge gloomy Reflections which are the certain Consequence of Indolence and Inactivity And though my Spirits are too weak to bear much Fatigue I would prefer the most laborious Life to the melancholy Hours I sometimes pass not for Want of Employment but Resolution to employ myself  I am however far from being satisfied with my present Condition for I almost hourly  find the Want of a reasonable Companion who by participating in my Concerns or approving my Actions would double my Assiduity and of course my Success And this leads me to mention two Things I have often thought ofFirst Providence certainly designed us social Creatures and that our greatest Happiness on Earth and strongest Pursuit is the Enjoyment of a rational and tender Friendship which cannot be attained without devoting the greatest and best Part of our Lives to this single Purpose for I am thoroughly convinced that sincere Love or real Friendship never was contracted after the Age of Forty The Mind then takes another Turn grows callous to the tender soft Impressions of Humanity and is in Pursuit of Enjoyments directly opposite to those the first and bestunless before engaged in the dear Tyes of Husband or of Friend if so each Day adds Strength to the blest Union and steals the Sting from Sorrow and from Care Can we then my dearest Life without arraigning the Goodness and Wisdom of the divine Being suppose that from the highest Excellence of our Nature we should be engaged in laudable Pursuits which are to take up the best and happiest Part of our Lives and that after having been at innumerable Pains to obtain them the Enjoyment should cease just when we are capable of it  by putting off this frail Mortality Noit cannot be With thee I'll range the liquid Fields of Air wander through all the Immensity of Bliss and find none equal to thy dear Society so fix my Heaven there  I grow quite an Enthusiast on this Subject and of course talk an infinite deal of Nonsense but sure you will excuse me when I solemnly declare I have no Idea of Happiness either in this World or the next unshared by thee  The second Thing I have to mention is my Surprize at your being able to live so long alone "for in Unequals what Society" And sure you appear to me like  Adam  before  the last and best of all God's Works  was formed dignified with and conscious of that Superiority he felt amidst his vassal Brutes Yet could Equality alone render Society agreeable to you you must indeed condemn yourself to a perpetual Solitude for in that Case I know not where it would be possible for you to find a Companion  I am but just come home from Lady 's My Watch lies on the Table and points to Twelve so I must bid you a thousand Times GoodNight  Frances  LETTER CLXXXII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    Elton  I AM come so far on my Way to  London  and shall be able to receive just one Letter from you before I leave it My Uncle is in the Gout which will not mend his Temper and the three Women I left behind me are in a hopeful Way with him and he of consequence extremely unhappy with them for Providence has ordered it's eternal Laws so equitably that whoever makes another unhappy by Perverseness of Temper makes himself no less so I have more Indulgence for great Vices than for this peevish unsociable Humour which Men absurdly contract at that Stage of Life when they stand most in need of all the friendly amusing and social Helps to aid them through The other Vices have Nature on their Side or Allurements and Temptations to excuse them but Moroseness is contrary to Nature who diffuses Chearfulness among all her Works and is also a Selftorment in the very Exercise As I have often said I look'd upon Chearfulness to be an Hymn to Providence as well as a strong Indication of a virtuous Mind so I am almost bold to affirm that Illhumour is Blasphemy in the Act and a moral Vice in the Disposition  Nay to prove it a Vice by the strict Rules of Logic I affirm it to be a Thing diametrically opposite to the Nature of Virtue for as that is it's own Reward this is it's own Punishment  It is observed by  Addison  that few People have all the Qualities requisite to render Life agreeable But there are two indispensably necessary which are in every one's Power Chearfulness and Constancy Now he who wants either of these should be condemned while those who fall short in the Gifts of Nature ought only to be pitied Here it may be proper to say something in my own Defence who seem to labour under this Rule in  some People  's Opinion but observe that there may be Chearfulness without Mirth and Constancy with Professing  I am  my dearest Pet  Your's sincerely  Henry  LETTER CLXXXIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    IT may seem idle to write you a Letter now which you will get but a few Hours before I see you but I do it perhaps to shew you I have not so paltry a Consideration for you as  the saving you a Groat though I am sure as I have no Letter of your's to answer that I shall not be able to say any thing which can defray the Expence  Our Assizes ended this Day by the Execution of all the Condemned among whom was  Johnson  a Rogue of some Consequence When I heard the Guards coming down the Street I retired to a back Room as it is not a Spectacle I care to look on but considering it as an Object which might give Occasion to some useful Reflections I returned and saw them pass by The first Thought which occurred to me was that I should be glad to have been for some Time in their Situation out of Curiosity to know how a Man feels or imagines in such shocking Circumstances for the mere Description of any thing does not sufficiently satisfy me I should be also glad more particularly to know how I should behave myself upon such an Occasion whether I should feel myself most concerned for my Crime or shocked at the Punishment whether my Hopes through the Merit of Repentance would be sufficient to support me through the Terrors if the Shame or Pain would afflict me most whether I should act like a Madman or a Fool and lastly whether I could have Strength of Mind sufficient to support that calm and philosophic Temper at my Death which great Part of my Life has  been laid out in endeavouring to attain With regard to the Wretches themselves I had one comfortable Reflection which will henceforward take off greatly from the Shock which Executions of this Kind give to the humane Mind That few of such Creatures ever reclaim of themselves but proceeding in a Series of Iniquities die without Repentance In this the executed Malefactor has a great Advantage above the Rogue who escapes The condemned Man has that Benefit which the Psalmist prays for so emphatically  Teach me O Lord so to number my Days that I may apply my Heart unto Wisdom  And I think that the highest Crimes sincerely repented of shall meet more Favour in the next World than lesser Offences unattoned by Sorrow and Contrition I shall pursue these Gallows Meditations no farther but only observe to you the powerful Effect of this great Salvo of Repentance towards the perfect Quietism of a Mind the least imbued with Religion though untutored by Philosophy in the Instance of  Johnson  this Day who just before he mounted the Ladder declared he would not change his present Situation with any Man in the World  I am  my dearest  Fanny  Sincerely your's  LETTER CLXXXIV  Dear  FANNY  I AM at present sitting in the midst of a large Field of Barley which I reaped the other Day and am taking Care of the Binders and Stackers There are fortyseven Women and fourteen Men at Work round about me while I am reading  Pliny  and writing to you  I think Lord  Orrery  's Comment upon the seventh Epistle is extremely fine The eighth Epistle of  Pliny  has a great Nobleness of Sentiment and a particular Justness of Thought I love the fine Struggle between natural Vanity and the Contempt of Praise which is obvious through the whole Letter It may be Stoicism if you please but I never will admit any Pretence to Virtue to be true Heroism which seems to be above human Nature 'till it has first shewn its Strife with the Frailties of it The ninth Epistle was always a Favourite of mine But there was a Note I expected from Lord  Orrery  upon this Passage  Thou art  almost  preferable  c  There is no Doubt but  Pliny  if he had consulted his own Taste and Inclinations would have left out that Adverb and put in  omnino  or  altogether  But the Philosophers  were obliged to speak of the tranquil Joys of retired Contemplation and learned Leisure with some Caution and Reserve either because the Antients had so often spoken and written in such Raptures of these Pleasures that the World had got into a Kind of Enthusiasm which alarmed Governments and States and the more particularly for this Reason that those Men who are fittest for the World are most fond of retiring from it or else  Pliny  moderated his ecstatic Soliloquy because he could not think a Man who was retired from all Business could be quite so virtuous or at least capable of exercising so much Virtue as one who employed himself in the Affairs of this World for some Part of the Duty of a Man born a social Creature must be neglected  In the Comment upon the tenth Epistle there is poetical Wit in the Allusion to  Ajax  's Shield There is an Expression in the same Comment which I think exceptionable Speaking of the young Men among the  Romans  he calls them  Gentlemen  which being a modern Phrase is improperly applied when we are speaking of the Antients  The Observations upon the eleventh Epistle are very pretty and very just and please me particularly because they flatter me about a Sentiment you may remember of mine that  Absence to Friends like Death to Enemies buries every Fault and enlivens every Virtue  In the last Paragraph of the Comment upon the th Epistle there is a good deal of Wit and Justness in the Simile of Lightning There is also something extremely pretty in the Annotation to the second Epistle of the second Book in the Allusion to the Flux and Reflux of the Sea The sixth Epistle of the same Book pleases me much I have been always offended when I have seen such improper and paltry Distinctions at very good Tables which I have often done and always made it a Rule with myself to take Part with the despised Guest which has sometimes had the proper Effect upon the Entertainer  I received your Letter with Lady 's inclosed and am much obliged to her for remembering me which it seems she does by mentioning Lord I know already that I am not to expect any thing from her Kindness in that Particular for I mentioned to you before Mr 's Answer to my Letter on that Head Now as I have a Way of profiting something from every Disappointment in Life I shall from this have the Satisfaction of feeling the grateful Sense of Lady 's Patronage pure and unmixed for the Friendship she designed me whereas had I succeeded my Acknowledgments might be looked upon  rather as a Rejoicing at the Emoluments of it than a Gratitude for the Favour itself  Now have at her Ladyship's  A Paragraph of a Letter inquiring after three or four Persons under the Characters of A B C  c  CrissCross A then is  B is  C spends his Time between Books Music and the Business of his Farms has indeed an uncomfortable Prospect with Regard to his Fortunes but has a certain Sturdiness in his Nature which helps to keep up his Spirits He has that happy Constitution and Turn of Mind that contemplating every Fortune or Accident in this Life as he hopes to do when he is out of it he regards each Incident of it as a Man should do  at the Hour of Death or in the Day of Judgment  so that he is resolved to regulate his present Actions upon that Plan which the Ages some Centuries hence should his Memory last so long shall approve or at least not condemn when all Prejudices private Interests or partial Connections shall be no more  The fourth Letter in the Alphabet is of course D but either the Carelessness of her Ladyship's Typography or my own ready Adaption of the Letter has made me fix on O which from the Figure being the most perfect in Geometry seems to bear the nearest Analogy to the Person decyphered by it O may our Loves our Joys our Days end like the Circle as they have begun for I keep no Record of Time before our first Acquaintance and may our Wishes like that too have but one common Center  I am concerned at your Apprehensions about Lady  L  's Face but more for her as a Child than as a Woman For Beauty is desirable when we can expect nothing better but a Woman may be amiable without a Symmetry of Features which I cannot instance in you because I think you handsome but Lady may fill the Example as she was never reckoned a Beauty And may the Mother's Fortune attend the Child to miss a Fop and gain a Man of Sense  I am sorry for the Accident which happened to your Eye But if it ends only in a Blemish I am quite easy for Mens sana in Corpore sano completes all my Wishes with Regard to you  I am  my dear  Omicron  Your's from  Alpha  to  Omega  LETTER CLXXXV  YOU speak too humbly my dear  Fanny  about your Person It is to my Liking amiable and no Comparison can render it otherwise to me but that of your Understanding And though Age or Sickness may forfeit your common Admirers  Best quitted with Disdain  yet your Charms to me must still remain For though the setting Sun to use a bold Expression  annihilates  the  Shadow  the Substance still remains the same  I am sorry you had nothing more particular to tell me in your last about  our  Lady  which  is a fond Expression among the Antients signifying a particular Regard or Friendship to any Person  I have got home the fine Edition of the  Spectators  I promised to send you The Papers I design to make Part of a Collection hinted to you in a former Letter which I mean to intitle "The Solamen Miseris or Cordial of Adversity" are Numbers the latter Part of and There are but four Papers in the  Tatlers  to be added to them Number the first Part of Number  Number and I have not looked into the  Guardians  lately but shall soon do it with a View to this humane and useful Work Writings of this Kind have admirable Effects upon a Mind rightly turned They have quelled all Ambition in me They have reconciled me to Poverty rendered me lukewarm to Fame have comforted me in Affliction have even alleviated Pain and taken away the Terrors of Death At the same Time they have enlivened my Hope enlarged my Views and opened such a glorious Prospect into Eternity that the Mind's Eye but carelessly glances over every Object which lies intermediate to it yet not with such an intemperate Enthusiasm as to hinder a thorough Resignation to the Dispensations of Providence for I contemplate the Joys of Eternity without any Impatience for the Possession of them which is owing to the admirable Contrivance of the Almighty who has given us such a SelfConviction of the Pleasures of Hereafter as may make us rest in Hope but restrained us from such a Sense of them as might render us impatient in our Wishes  Farewell  my Love my Friend my Oracle  Henry  LETTER CLXXXVI  FRANCES  to  HENRY    WHAT a Scene of tranquil Happiness does my dear practic Philosopher's Letter present me with How earnestly how passionately do I wish to share those rational Delights which he can at once partake and inspire How "  altogether preferable  " should I think it to be seated by him on an Hillock of Hay contemplating the Works of Nature while he deduced each obvious Effect from it's first great Principle and made me lose all Wonder in Praise and Gratitude to that Almighty Being who first created and then made him mine  I say how much should I prefer that happy Situation to a Throne without thee thou dearest and most charming of thy Sex Nor will I doubt that my sharing would enhance the Pleasures of Retirement for Solitude's the Nurse of Love as well as Contemplation and I am very sure were we to live but a few Months in a calm settled Way together you would be infinitely fonder of me than you are or can be at present as I make no doubt but we should then experience the charming Theory you have somewhere laid down  Chearfulness without Mirth Gravity without Spleen and  the warmest Love with the highest Esteem  You will perhaps be surprized when I tell you that I now rejoice at what I have sometimes looked on as the greatest Misfortune of my Life that we have not lived together We should have been miserable if that had happened two Years ago It is but a very short Time since I became thoroughly acquainted with you That Knowledge has increased my Love and Esteem for you You have introduced me to myself Need I say that by knowing myself I have triumphed over my greatest Foible And sure I cannot err greatly after your pointing out my Faults when I declare in the Sincerity of my Heart that I have no Will of my own nor Wish but that of rendering my little Self agreeable to youIf it were not a Work of Supererogation I could even wish that I had greater Failings to surmount as they would be a still stronger Proof of your Love and mine  Though I remember the Subject of each particular Letter you mention in  Pliny  I will not pretend to speak my Sentiments as I have not the Books by me if I had I should certainly start Objections for the Pleasure of being refuted by you  I have not been at the Rock these ten Days I have lain in  BondStreet  since I came to Town and am almost killed with Raking I shall not  leave  London  'till  Kitty  does I know you will be a little angry with this Account of myself 'till you recollect that I have not seen her for some Months and that the greatest Part of our Conversation is about you which being a Subject I shall never be weary of I cannot think of quitting it without Reluctance  With your's I received a long Letter from Lady I think according to your Definition of it the Letter O is much better adapted to her than to me for she is indeed the Center of female Perfection By her Desire I inclose you Lord 's Letter Nothing can be more elegant than your Sentiments with Regard to her Intentions to serve you  I am vastly anxious to know what you have determined about  BelvidereKitty  is tearing the Pen out of my Hand When shall I be able to write or converse with you sans Interruption I can no longer withstand the Riot round me but though they force my Hand away my Heart is unalterably your's  Frances  LETTER CLXXXVII  Dear  FANNY  AS the Post for this Day is not come in I do not know yet whether you leave Town Tomorrow or no therefore I shall write to you because I would not spare myself any Trouble certain for even the Chance of giving you a Quarter of an Hour's Amusement  I met with a small Treatise Yesterday intitled "On the Employment of Time" It is wrote by  Gilbert West  I think it is very well  collected  for indeed it is mostly a Heap of Quotations and shews more of Learning than Understanding For a Work of this Kind almost any Man may  compile  who reads with a Commonplace Book by him  Young  the Satirist has two very severe Lines against Quotations which for that Reason I shall not recite and there is certainly nothing so tiresome to the Reader as Writings of that Kind which are only to be admitted in Works of Fancy but not at all necessary upon moral or philosophical Subjects For Example If Mr  West  speaks Sense or Reason what Occasion is there to inform us that  Cicero  thought the same Way or said the same Thing It is Argument not Authority which convinces All Knowledge  is derived originally from the human Understanding and a Thought is nevertheless our own because it has been hit on by somebody else before And one may as well quote  Adam  for breathing because he was the first Creature who did so as  Euclid  for saying that the three Angles of every Triangle are equal to two right ones because he was the first Person who demonstrated that Proposition  A quoting Author is just as ridiculous as a Country Girl who upon her first coming to Town being decked out by the Help of her Friends should make public Acknowledgment from whom she had her Stockings her Shift her Stays  c  So that if every Person was there to claim their own she would be left as naked as the Jay in the Fable or as such a pyebald Author say Writer rather say Complier say Publisher say secondhand Cook who gives you a Beggar's Dish out of Fragments or say Printer's SignPost upon which are pasted the heterogeneous Scraps of many Authors  I remember a stupid Sort of Fellow who used to put me in mind of these Men who are too modest to say any Thing of their own for he never asked for Bread Drink told you what o'Clock it was or mentioned even the most trifling Occurrence without adding  as the Man said  And whenever he had a mind like these Men to shew the Extent of his  Learning by recurring up to the most antient Authority he would cry  as the Man said  a great while ago    The Importance of the Subject which Mr  West  treats on is great and ought to be the frequent Reflection of every Man of Sense Morality or Religion He has considered it with Regard to the two last and placed the Matter in several very strong Lights But as a Thing of this Consequence cannot stand in too many Points of View I shall attempt to consider it with Relation to the first merely as a rational Man without any Regard to Virtue relative only to our present State and in that Respect confined intirely to ourselves Which few Hints you may stile  Of the Oeconomy of Time  Of the simple Enlargement of itOr a certain Method to lengthen Life in Spight of Fate or of the Grave  There is an Expression often made use of by thoughtless People which astonishes and provokes me extremely  Let us do so and so to kill Time  It is some Revenge however to observe what Suicides they are at the same Time of this most horrid and unnatural Murder So true it is that We and our Time must live and die together We generally lament the Shortness of Man's Life taken together while we are blaming the Tediousness of every Portion of it This Contradiction may be accounted  for if we consider that as Time unemployed lags heavily along an idle Person for this Reason must complain of tiresome Days and as Duration is marked only by the Succession of Ideas his Life must appear shortest who has fewest Actions or Passages to recollect  To consider Man then only with Regard to this Life What a miserable Wretch must he be whose passing Minutes are told as so many Hours and whose past Years are reflected upon but as so many Days  Let us then as rational Creatures contrive so to employ ourselves in a Series of Actions which by marking every Period of our Lives we may enjoy this great and happy Advantage that the present Moments shall glide imperceptibly away and our past Age appear so long upon summing up that we may not murmur at the short Span "of threescore Years and ten"  O Vita Stulto longa Sapienti brevis  Again 'tis computed that the generality of Men sleep away about one Third of their Time that is about eight Hours in the twentyfour Now five Hours is full sufficient for any Person who would preserve Health of Body and Vigour of Mind So that there may be above three Hours saved out of every Day which is about one Day in the Week and that is one Year in seven Then by the Time a Man has reached  his grand Climacteric he may be said to have lived just nine Years more than some of his twin Cotemporaries  What would a Man give for nine Years added to sixtythree How much more valuable are nine Years before sixtythree for surely that Time is the most preferable which we can live without growing older We cannot indeed borrow Time from Death but we can take it from it's Semblance Sleep Which brings me to the Close of my Proposition or  a certain Method to lengthen Life in Spight of Fate or the Grave  Henry  LETTER CLXXXVIII  Dear  HARRY  I HAVE read the Treatise you mention but like your Supplement to it much better It is a double Charity to write to me on Subjects at present because there is not a Book in this House which could supply me with Matter for a Minute's Reflection which makes the Time except what I spend in reading your Letters or writing to you pass like an idle Dream which leaves no Trace behind  Your Letter has made me grow quite impatient at the Reflection of having lost so much of my Life The Desire of improving my Mind and fixing it's Contemplation upon proper Objects increases daily yet by some unforeseen Accident I find myself continually deprived even of one Day's Retirement and am if I may use the Expression constantly immersed in Idleness  The Tediousness of present Time is often irksome to the wise Man as well as the Fool though not in so great a Degree which has been considered as a Proof of the Soul's Immortality For we are continually pushing forward to some Point of Time which when arrived at falls short of the Expectations we had raised upon it we still persist in flattering ourselves and fix our Happiness on some future Period which in it's Course brings Disappointment too and yet we still go on wishing the present Hour were past and hoping Peace or Joy from some more distant Aera 'till the Grave opening interrupts our Schemes and shews the only Prospect where the Soul can rest Oh may we fix our Grasp on that StrongHold which cannot will not fail us and like the Patriarch wrestle for a Blessing Let the incumbering World recede and even our mutual Loves decay before the glorious Hope of Immortality What Joy what more than Transport do I  feel in thinking that when Death shall have dissolved the poor infirm and feeble Forms which now incase our Spirits we shall meet again conscious of each other's Love and Truth in perfect Bliss above  I do not cordially approve of your lessening the Portions of Time allotted for Sleep It is wise Nature prompts and all Philosophy is vain which dares oppose her She has appointed equal Periods to Labour and to Rest while Man impatient to be happy steals from his only promised Blessing Ease to squander in the vain Pursuit of Wealth or Pleasure I must own notwithstanding your philosophical Moral which I acknowledge to be very ingenious that I am a great Friend to Sleep whom  Silius Italicus  calls the most amiable of all the Gods When tired out with Grief or Pain it strengthens and renews the Springs of Life we wake refreshed and feel a Kind of silent Hymn of Gratitude arise in our Minds for this more than for any other Blessing While we sleep we are at least negatively good incapable of acting or designing Ill and I am afraid that even the best Man has more to answer for his wakin  than his sleeping Hours be he never so great a Sluggard However I shall receive one Advantage from your Doctrine that I shall insist upon your Practice keeping up to your Preaching and I will certainly produce your Letter against  you whenever I find you begin to yawn about Ten o'Clock for that is a most unreasonable  Hour  for a Person to go to Bed who has not Occasion to sleep more than  five    LETTER CLXXXIX  Dear  FANNY  YOUR'S of the th I shall answer by desiring you to look into that Letter of mine which gave you Occasion to speak upon this Head and you will find that I did not say my Philosophy prevented me from feeling A Man may be very sensible of the Gout or Stone without roaring nay more so for the Expression of either Grief or Pain is observed to lessen the Poignancy of them I would say with  Romeo  "hang up Philosophy" indeed if it served to extinguish in my Breast the least Part of that manly Love that tender Friendship that soft Sentiment or that warm Affection which my charming  Fanny  is best capable of inspiring my quick Sense of all which I am proud to own and grateful to acknowledge I owe to her alone  As to your leaving  England  you may remember I told you before that though I might  submit I never should consent because I could never sincerely do it But upon this Subject I hope to have an Opportunity of speaking more at large in a few Days when I design being in Town  I do not remember the particular Conversation you hint at just before I left  London  I am very certain I never came into such an Agreement and if you proposed it I have forgot it as I should do every Thing which betrayed the least Unkindness in you  I shall send this Night to the Post for your Letter and am impatient to know how you are I am afraid you spent your Time careless of your own Health I may say of my Health while  Kitty  was in Town I wish a little Scolding Would do you any Good  My dearest  Fanny  I do not lessen the Portion of Time allotted by Nature for Rest I find five Hours sufficient for my Health and Spirits more Sleep injures both then rationally I conclude Nature meant no more Now every Indulgence we take beyond what Nature requires is rather a Fatigue than a Refreshment This is equally true in Meat and Drink and Sleep And to consider it in this Light th  Passage in Lord  Grimston  's Play which along with the whole Performance has been so laughed at is not quite so absurd as it is generally taken  I'll rest my wearied Bones 'till they  more wearied be  I do not think with you that a Man is passively good all the while he is asleep it would be great Favour to allow him to be even negatively bad The Mind of Man was framed for a Series of rational Thought and his Life designed for a Course of moral Actions if then without Necessity he ceases to think or act to the best of his Powers he mars the Ends of his Creation Nay I think we can hardly refrain from charging positive Guilt upon a Person who sleeps more than he needs Sleep is a temporary Death and as I hinted to you upon this Subject before how a Man may lengthen his Life he by this Means shortens it of course then for so much he is guilty of Suicide Is not a Man guilty of Theft who steals from an Heap because he does not pocket the Whole And if a Parcel of Money be laid in a Line upon a Table is he not equally criminal who takes from the Middle as if he stole from one End  I have now gone through both your Letters and having nothing better or more agreeable to do shall return to  Pliny  but shall first observe to you that I have had frequent Thought since I was upon this Work of writing Remarks upon your Letters  and hold my FarthingCandle to the Sun  This would be an Undertaking which would require a great deal but not too much Time for though your  Letters are but few yet the Comments would be many either to point out the Beauties or express my Admiration of them  The sixteenth Epistle of the fifth Book is a very fine and a very affecting one I love  Pliny  most when he speaks upon such Subjects as these His generous Friendships extreme Tenderness and extensive Humanity have given me such an Affection for him beyond any of the Antients I am acquainted with that I am resolved he shall be the first Person I will inquire for when I go to Heaven for there he is if St  Paul  be there There may be many greater Characters I mean with Regard to History but not one more amiable How vain then is Ambition when  Pliny  is preferred to  Alexander  or  Caesar  and how surprizing that Men should still continue in a Mistake when so little Reflection may set them right  LETTER CXC  Dear  FANNY  AS I never read with complete Pleasure but when we are together so it gives me Uneasiness in my Musaeum when any Sentiment or Criticism occurs to me that I cannot immediately communicate it to you And this  is the Reason that many of my Letters treat upon Subjects which seem not proper for such familiar Epistles as our's generally are so that perhaps some of them appear stiff merely from the Freedom of them for I never sit down with a Design of writing you  a Letter  but when I take Pen in Hand I write you whatever occurs to my Mind at that Time whether Poetry Metaphysics Politics or Divinity  For Instance now who could think of entertaining a young Woman of Wit Gaiety and poetic Rapture with a Discourse upon SelfMurder But I happened this Morning to look into a Treatise against Suicide by Dr  Watts  which I think a very insufficient Performance  Authorities drawn from the Scriptures or Writings of the Philosophers may have Effect upon very weak or over religious Minds But Reasons not Authorities are requisite to Men of Sense or free Reflection which a Man may have without being an Atheist or merely a Deist  In those Places where the Author attempts to reason he does it very imperfectly of which I shall give you two Instances among many He says  We are placed here like a Centinel at his Post  c  and after going on with a great deal of Commonplace on that Head concludes from the  supposed  Analogy of human and divine Things that Suicide must be a  Crime But this is begging the Question What Authority from Reason have we to say that Man is placed here as a Centinel Or what Certainty have we of this Analogy In Metaphysics indeed we are obliged to give some Definitions of our Ideas in order to help us to discourse intelligibly about them but in Reality there may be no more Relation between the Things themselves and our Ideas of them than there is between Colours and Sounds though a blind Man to give us his Notion of Red compared it to the Sound of a Trumpet but yet in true Philosophy it comes as near the Sound of a Lute And indeed the speculative Divines seem to me generally to reason like this Man with more Fancy than Logic  Another Piece of Reasoning he makes use of is this  That though we cannot perceive any Relation we are placed in with Regard to this Life as in some Instances may be the Case which might make our Death a moral Evil yet  perhaps  we may be appointed by God to influence some future Event and so the Ends of Providence may be disappointed by one Man's Impatience  Now I think it extremely weak perhaps impious to imagine that it can be in the Power of one Man or Mankind united to frustrate the least Scheme or Design of Providence And a Thief at the Gallows may make use of such an Argument  with as much Reason as any body else So that this Reasoning by proving too much proves nothing  Watts  has indeed summed up all that has ever been said upon this Occasion but to tell the Truth I never met with any thing satisfactory upon the Subject which is owing to the cautious but unfair Manner of arguing upon this Head used by the Divines who for Fear of giving the least Encouragement to desperate Men will not admit of any Sort of Latitude in this Matter  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CXCI  FRANCES  to  HENRY    ON finding that my dear  Harry's  Letter had been opened before it came to my Hands I began to apprehend that my Letters might have been intercepted I know not how this Treatment affects you but it has filled me with the highest Resentment For sure it is the Extreme of Insolence and Cruelty to deprive us of the only Means left to soften the tedious melancholy Hours of Absence Nor can I believe that any Law human or divine has vested even a Parent with such a Power What barbarous Tyranny then to assume it  I have often experienced the Uneasiness you mention at reading any thing that pleased me when you was not with me One finds but a vague Enjoyment in any Pleasure unshared by the Person beloved  I think I have Reason to resent the Apology you make for writing upon Subjects above a tawdry Girl's Reflection If you consider me in that Light I must join with the World in condemning your Taste But if as you have flattered me my Person has the least Share in your Affection that you love my Mind and would improve it in order to render it capable of the highest Enjoyment that of conversing with you why need you make any Apology for taking the proper Method of rendering it worthy of your Regard I have often told you that no Subject can appear dull or abstruse to me which you wrote on Nay I have gone farther and sometimes fancied that if you were to write in a Language I was wholly unacquainted with I should certainly understand you at least I am sure I should if I was to hear and see you speak it  I have never met with any of Dr  Watts  's Writings but from the Specimen you give I take him to be a better Christian than Philosopher Though I am sure there may be many stronger Arguments against Suicide than those you quote from him yet I am pleased at his  considering every Individual though without visible Tye or Connection as necessary to the Wellbeing of the whole Species for as the Great Artificer made nothing in vain the Wretch who finds not Happiness in his own Bosom or in any outward Objects may from this Principle alone conclude SelfMurder to be a Crime  But after all what are all Arguments about this Matter Only speculative Essays For I am convinced that no Person ever committed the Act but an Atheist or a Madman Then it would be in vain to reason with the first upon Principles which he denies you and it would be a Jest to reason with the other at all  After this Reflection I do not look upon Suicide in that shocking Light which other People do For with Regard to the Atheist I fear it is pretty equal to his poor Soul after what Manner he dies and as to the Madman I throw him upon his Mercy who could had he pleased have  made Reason rule and Passion be it's Slave  LETTER CXCII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I talked of dying better Thoughts come forward  and since the Satisfaction I have had in this Day has made me somewhat more in Love with Life I shall here give you a Supplement to my last Letter lest you should imagine I was quite of a different Opinion from  Watts  because I did not allow his Reasoning to be sufficiently strong upon the Subject  I do not look upon Suicide or indeed upon any Act in the Light that Divines do as criminal in itself but regard all Actions in a general View as indifferent in themselves for the same Thing may be virtuous at one Time and vicious at another So that the Difference seems to lie merely in Circumstance I think with Deference to the Pulpit that whoever understands the Nature of Vice in any other Sense impiously charges God with having originally generated Evil Now with Regard to this particular Instance we are upon I consider a Suicide not as guilty of a particular Crime but of so  much Vice as the moral Consequences of the Act leave him chargeable with And the Chain is so extensive and the Dependencies so nice in this Life that very few Men can be free enough from Relation or Contingency to be perfectly clear from Guilt in this Act And so far as it is a Crime it is of the highest Nature so as it has the Aggravation of Presumption the Sin of acting against Nature and the Impossibility of Repentance  However there may be particular Instances where the Thing may be indifferent in itself yet even here though the Action be innocent the Turn of Mind which prompts to it must be extremely vicious It argues an Impatience and Rashness which are the Signs of an Intemperance of Soul a Disregard to the Opinion of this World which every good Man should have Respect for or a Despair of God's Providence which a Man of Philosophy or Religion should never betray  There are I think but three Things which can provoke a Person to this desperate Act Pain Poverty or Shame If from the first Circumstance then he has forgot what all the Trials in this Life were intended for and so foolishly refuses that Physic which may give him Health to Immortality If from the second it is owing to a false Pride and an unchristian Spirit joined to a Habit of Idleness which  creates a slothful Despondency If from the third he but seals his Name with Infamy makes that Shame the more public and deprives himself of any Opportunity of retrieving his Character It was finely said by some great Man upon hearing Libels had been wrote against him  I will live so as to give the Lye to their Reproach  Suppose a Criminal leading forth to Execution even he shall have no Power over his own Life though already forfeited and condemned for he adds to his Crime by rebelling against the Laws of his Country and deprives the Community of a wholesome Example of public Justice Beside as all human Inflictions may be considered as Trials of our Virtue so may even legal Punishments if undergone with Resignation Contrition and Hope be considered as Attonements for our Crimes  Thus you see that even in the most indifferent Case though the Action itself may be morally innocent yet it can never be performed but by a vicious Actor  In short it is an Action contrary to the Laws of God and Man The first without recurring to Authorities may be proved from the natural Abhorrence we find in ourselves from the Act which to Demonstration shews the Sense of Providence about the Matter And the second we know from the general Sense of Mankind  who have endeavoured to deter from by affixing Ignominy upon it the only Way of dealing with the Dead  But all these Reflections may not occur to a Man in the Hurry of the Act for there are but few deliberate Suicides Yet surely any Moment of Time may afford us Leisure for this short Expostulation  What if it should be a Crime Then great God how shocking must his Situation be whose Conviction comes too late for Repentance  Henry  P S  Keep this Letter for me  LETTER CXCIII  Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED your Letter last Post with the Pamphlet wrote against the  Essay on Spirit  I do not think it is well done nor has he answered the Essay in any Sort to my Satisfaction He shelters himself entirely under Texts of Scripture which may be explained and understood as well for the Essay as himself He does not venture into the Field at large nor engage at all in the metaphysical Parts of that Work  What does he mean by saying that  to suppose the one only selfexisting God can  delegate a Power of Creation even to the highest Spirit is impious and absurb  It does not appear to me that there is any thing in such a Supposition beyond the Power or contrary to the Nature of God  There is something new in his Opinion that by the Expression of the Angel of the Lord is to be understood not a distinct Spirit but only the Form or Matter with which the Most High has sometimes indued himself in order to become visible to the Grossness of human Faculties This may be true for any thing that either he or I know But I think there is no Authority for it in the Scriptures  In speaking of the three Men who were stiled Jehovah and appeared to  Lot  and from which he means to deduce a Hint of the Trinity in Unity he gives a very unsatisfactory Reason why only two of them were stiled Angels And I shall here venture upon a Sentiment of my own on this Head which has just now occurred to me Two of the Persons are called Angels intimating the Father and the Holy Ghost and the third is only spoken of as Man prealluding to that State of Humanity which God the Son was thereafter to take upon himself in this WorldI think that this Passage thus explained greatly strengthens the Allegory of that Apparition supposed to manifest to  Abraham  the Trinity in Unity  The Insincerity which he charges upon the Author in the Dedication to the Primate is perhaps true but he unfairly passes by that St  Paul  was quoted for it in giving Way in some Things to the Customs of the Jews  As to the "Essay on Spirit" my Objection is not to the Treatise but to the Author for as he confesses himself to be a Clergyman he should have kept himself within the Trammels of his Garb and  In some former Letter  as I said before rather have governed himself by Form than guided himself by Reason The Church  Catholicon  indeed may be a proper Subject for human Disquisition and has in former Times been purged modelled and reformed to the great Advantage of Christianity But the Church  established  is a sacred Thing the Peace of it is not to be disturbed and Noli irritare is it's Motto The Author is guilty of the same Officiousness of a Person that should rouze a Friend dozing away his Life in a Lethargy who would prefer peaceful Slumbers to the Vigour of Health or the Length of Days It had been a more prudent Attempt to have affirmed Atheism than Unitheism as Truth and Reason are more safely combated than Prejudice or Superstition It is the same Indiscretion as it would be in a State for an enthusiastic Patriot to venture his Life or Fortunes for the Sake of Liberty or  Justice In short Truth is no more to be spoken by all Persons than at all Times  For my Part I think this Essay though it has not immediately advanced the Principles of Christian Morality has had that great End ultimately in View by strengthening our Faith in the Hierarchy Metaphysics are in Truth a dangerous Science to introduce into Religion for where there can be no Certainty the Doubts must be infinite Natural Philosophy with the rational Deductions therefrom afford to every contemplative Man sufficient Light to work his Salvation by But surely the supermetaphysical Doctrine of Trinity in Unity has made more Christians recur to Deism than Divines perhaps are aware of while the Trinity as explained in this Essay sufficiently vouched I think from the Scriptures and the Opinions of the antient Fathers of the Church who immediately followed the Apostles has nothing antimetaphysical in it The Possibility of it is comprehensible and then and then only it becomes the proper Object of Faith  But there are some enthusiastic Believers who are over zealous for Mysteries and think that any thing which falls short of Impossibility is not sufficient Exercise for the Christian Faith Perhaps these Men are of that dangerous Sect who affirmed that perfect Faith alone was sufficient to Salvation and that the Doctrine of  Good Works was impiously presuming to add to the Merits of our Saviour though the Apostle says  Give all Diligence to add to your Faith Virtue    Pet  i  For my Part I think that there is Mystery enough in the Incarnation and Redemption to satisfy a reasonable Man And as these Things are indeed incomprehensible but not directly contrary to our Reason they square as I said before with the allowed Definition of Faith  I shall conclude these Remarks with an Allusion to the Body natural That Constitution is in Danger whose Appetite swallows more than it's Stomach can digest and the most valid Health is always found to be with the most temperate Man  LETTER CXCIV  I AM indeed sincerely rejoiced to find my dear  Harry  in such a chearful Mood For my own Part I cannot tell when I have been in lower Spirits than now I am separated from you  Kitty  leaves us Tomorrow and my dear Lady in a few Weeks perhaps for ever I have passed a very disagreeable Summer I am sick of Parties of Pleasure and quite weary of  London  My Inclination would carry me to the Country with  Kitty  I sacrifice that to Prudence  and stay in a Place I dislike Might I not as well be a thousand as fifty Miles from you The Distance would not I am sure lessen my Affection nor do I believe it would alter your's You could write to me with the same Tenderness if I were in  Paris  as in  London  and my Replies should always be as constant and as kind Your Friends would then be satisfied there was no Engagement between us and would leave us both at Peace If our mutual Regards continued 'till those Obstacles were surmounted which now divide us we should meet with double Gladness and if they are never to he conquered Habit would supply the Place of Philosophy and render our Separation every Day less painful In short I honestly confess I never thought of leaving  England  with so little Regret as now and should Lady press me to go but half as warmly as she did some Time since nothing but your Commands shall prevent me I desire you will let me know your real Sentiments on this Subject by Return of the Post  I shall at your Desire keep your last  The last Letter but one  and at my own all your Letters I shall think myself much obliged if you will either return or destroy mine You have already paid me a greater Compliment and I dare say you will not refuse this if we part Though I have  slightly touched on a Subject that is to me most melancholy yet as I find myself in such a gloomy Cast of Mind I will not venture to make any Reply to your Treatise on Suicide lest the Lowness of my Spirits should make me appear though contrary to my Reason an Advocate for a Crime I look on with the greatest Horror  I expect a very long Letter by Tomorrow's Post in Answer to the little Hundred which I hope you have got of mine I shall for the future direct to as I think it the safest Way I shall go to the Rock on  Friday  Continue to direct to  BondStreet  and believe me  Very affectionately your's  Frances  LETTER CXCV  My Dearest  FANNY  Musaeum  TOMORROW is to be a very busy Day with me both at home and abroad therefore I shall dedicate this pleasant tranquil  Sunday  Evening to you lest I should miss a Post I am in Haste too to finish  Pliny  that I may send it up along with the rest of your Books  In a Note upon the twentyseventh Epistle of the seventh Book we are informed of the Name of that Philosopher who gave the famous Advice to  Augustus  to repeat the twentyfour Letters whenever he found his Passion rising I wish I had seen this Passage before the last Evening we spent at The Advice indeed I have often heard of but never knew the Author's Name before or I should have honoured it I have very seldom known the Charm put in Practice but always imagined when I saw a Man in a Passion that either he had never heard of it or had never learnt his Alphabet Upon which Hint I am tempted sometimes to treat such Persons like Children and hang a HornBook about their Necks saying with  Brutus    I will use thee for my Sport yea for my "Laughter when thou grow'st waspish  The Cure for a Scold a Poem in one of the  Tatlers  is from such a Hint as this of  Athenodorus    In the Observations upon this same Epistle Lord  Orrery  inveighs against the Weakness and Credulity with Regard to Ghosts and Apparitions Now I cannot join with him in this Particular because there are some Stories of this Kind so well attested that they should gain Credit like other Parts of History upon the same Authority The Belief of this Matter is  a Thing above our Reason but not contrary to it which is the proper Definition of Faith And if it were made an Article of our Creed I do not think it would be amiss for it is not contrary to Religion as being vouched by Holy Writ At least I would not discourage the Belief since it is a strong Proof of Life after Death which every Argument that tends to prove adds Strength to Religion and Virtue As to the Immortality of the Soul which I lay hold of every Opportunity to discourse upon it is a Thing which a Christian cannot doubt of because there is express Authority for it in that Book upon which his Faith is founded And even to a Deist it may be proved ex absurbo which is a Method of arguing in the Mathematics when the Truth of a Proposition cannot be demonstrated in a direct Manner the Assent is gained by shewing the Absurdity of the contrary Opinion As thus If there be no Hereafter for Mankind God is inconsistent and unjust the first in giving us Hopes which we certainly have from the Light of Nature alone that are never to be fulfilled and the second in suffering Virtue in any Shape to go unrewarded That Being then which is inconsistent or unjust cannot be God ergo a Mortalist Deist sinks into an Atheist I would treat an Atheist after the same Manner that I mentioned just now and brand him with that  pupil Ensign which is the proper Emblem of his extreme Ignorance for as the Psalmist justly expresses it  The  Fool  hath said in his Heart there is no God  Orrery  in the Notes upon the twentyeighth Epistle says this Letter should be placed the first of the whole Collection and he is certainly right Proper Lights and particular Points of View are a great Advantage to every thing He often complains of the Want of Order through the Whole and I am angry at him for not setting this Matter right for it would be as little Trouble as the Observing upon it I have a Mind to do so myself when I have finished the Reading  I am pleased with  Pliny  's Sentiment upon Ridicule in the last Paragraph of the twentyninth Epistle And I approve of it as an admirable Weapon against Vice and surely fitter here employed than as  Shaftsbury  recommends it for the Test of Truth Almost any Man would rather undergo Fine Imprisonment or Pain itself rather than the Mortification of being laughed at  Addison  and other ingenious Writers have spoken so admirably upon the Power of Shame or Influence of Modesty that for very Shame I shall not attempt to pursue the Subject in this Light but shall take the Liberty for the Honour of human Nature to  consider this Matter in a particular Manner which I never met with in any Author  Speech is not the distinguishing Sign of an human Creature for Birds have been taught to speak Nay all the Brute or Animal Creation converse naturally for their Tones are intelligible to each other and what are Words but Sounds and Expressions of our Ideas Rationality is not the proper Sign neither for Instinct makes that Matter doubtful and it is certain that all Animals act logically Risibility is a Mark much insisted upon but if this is meant merely of a Distortion of Countenance I have seen Dogs laugh and if it be meant as a Sign of Chearfulness or Pleasure then the various Expressions of these Sensations throughout the whole Brute World sufficiently answer to this Definition I look upon Modesty then to be the only Characteristic or Criterion which properly distinguishes Man from other Animals as we are certainly the only Creatures known who have the least Sense of Shame  I am  my fair Inspirer  Your Oracle  Henry  LETTER CXCVI  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I SENT a second Messenger to the Post suspecting the first had deceived me but not a Line from you though you must know how anxious I am at present to learn some Particulars relating to your Situation Well I am angry now but A B C  c  and now kiss and Friends and you are my own spoiled Pet again But if I do not hear from you by Tomorrow I must eke out the  Roman  Alphabet with the  Greek  and  Hebrew  I sent to know if  Kitty  had any Account of you but received no Satisfaction from thence  But to return to  Pliny  I think  Orrery  too severe upon the second Epistle of the eighth Book not considering it as wrote to a Friend and not to the World The Privilege of Friendship is to think aloud And shall I be reprimanded for communicating to my dearest  Fanny  my humane Sentiments with Regard to the Gleaner's Harvest  c  Or shall I be thought ridiculous for telling you that I have spent good Part of this Morning in the Amusement of a  Roman  Emperor catching Flies not like  Domitian  to kill them but to retrieve them from their torpid State by the Heat of my Hand and have the Joy to see them flutter  about the Room with added Life and Vigour I think it a wrong Thing to discourage in any Sort the Exercise of Humanity even the Talking of it as by this Means perhaps some People may be as it were intrapped into Virtue by professing it first out of Vanity they may come afterwards to practise it out of Shame Many a Coward has been induced to fight because he has happened to boast that he would  In the twentysecond Epistle there is a very just Sentiment and a very proper one to be considered by the severe Moralist or the outrageously Virtuous  He who hates Faults hates Mankind  The twentythird Epistle is a very affecting one and the Character of  Junius Avitus  is very amiable It is indeed the Nature of the Afflicted to enumerate every little Circumstance which once gave us Pleasure in the Enjoyment of what we have lost and it is sometimes a mortifying Reflection that while we are multiplying our Joys we may perhaps be but increasing the Earnest of our Griefs  In the seventh Letter of the ninth Book and several precedent ones I find the Reason for Lord  Orrery  's Essay upon antient Architecture which you may remember I was a little alarmed about in his Preface to this Work for which I here offer my Palinode  On the eighth Epistle there is an Instance of Wit in the Comment  Vanity like Smoke smothers and obscures the Flame from whence it proceeds  I have observed a great deal of lively Fancy as well as just Thought in my Lord's Writing through the Course of this Work And upon the Whole I think he has shewn himself a Man of Virtue a Man of Learning and a Man of Taste and if he was not also a Man of Rank and Fortune which might make my Attachment suspected by Persons who have none of the Qualities abovementioned to ennoble their Sentiments I would certainly take some solicitous Pains to become acquainted with him  In the last Paragraph of the Preface to the tenth Book my Lord seems in Doubt about the rendering the Word  Dominus  which he has done very justly by translating it  Sir  as it is addressed by  Pliny  to  Trajan  It is in this Manner we speak to our Kings and the  French  who are Patterns of all Politeness and Decorum salute their Grand Monarque by the Stile of  Sire    The twentyeighth Epistle of the tenth Book should immediately precede the thirtieth because in this last he refers to the former in these Words  I had informed you by my last Letter that  Lycormas  c  I take especial Notice of the Want of Order in this Particular  because my Lord has attempted to place all the Letters of this tenth and last Book in a regular Series and upon this Occasion I shall repeat what I said in a former Letter Why did he not take the same Pains throughout  In his thirtieth Epistle  Pliny  gives an absurd Reason for not detaining the Ambassador He says it was because  Lycormas  had desired he should be detained 'till he himself arrived  The thirtyfifth and thirtyninth Epistles from  Trajan  are exact Models of all the Court Answers to Public Addresses  Adieu  my Life and believe me 'till Tomorrow's Post  Your's  Athenodorus  LETTER CXCVII  MY dear little Shrub my Arbutus my Evergreen I wish you Joy of your Retirement and happy Vacation from  I am really charmed with your Reasoning upon the Analogy between the finite Perfections and the divine Attributes so justly deduced from  the Wisdom and Goodness of Providence and am pleased that I carried my Sentiments no farther upon that Subject than merely to suggest that  perhaps  there might be no Relation between them For when I come close to the Argument with the Divines I enter the Lists upon their own Terms but I only fix the Feet of  Jacob  's Ladder on the Earth while you soar upon it to the Skies  I meant to consider Mercy as a selfsufficient distinct operating Excellence in the Godhead the proper Objects of which were those which did not come within the Merits of that Repentance which might intitle them to the Justice defined in that Letter I am my dearest  Fanny  well aware how little orthodox I am in this Opinion and therefore call upon myself for some Explanation of this Subject as I seem to make no Difference between the Good and Bad with Regard to the unbounded Mercy of God In order to which I shall make Use of an Allusion by considering Man in this Life like a SilkWorm in it's NymphState involved and incompassed round with Toils of their own weaving the one waiting 'till God's Blessing as the other for a warm Sun shall rescue him to a joyful Resurrection Now some Insects carry the Seeds of Death with them into the Grave and consequently perish immediately without being able to revive to a new Life  in which forlorn Situation I consider a wicked Man and think I have some Authority from Scripture for this Hypothesis  The Wages of Sin are  Death    And again  The Lord wisheth not the  Death  of a Sinner but rather that he may turn from his Wickedness and  live    Now though the Inflicting of Punishments as I have somewhere said would in some Sort deprive Heaven of the full Enjoyment of it's own Perfection yet such a literal Death as I understand from these Texts that is the intire Deprivation of Sense or Being from a Sinner is not only agreeable to Justice but to Mercy too for  they say bad Men would be unbless'd in Heaven  And as this Life is given us in order to prepare our Souls for the Relish of that contemplative Bliss which is hereafter to be permitted to the Spirits of good Men made perfect it would be rather an Instance of Cruelty than Mercy to grant Immortality to those unhappy Wretches in a State of Existence which would not admit the Gratification of mortal Senses or the Indulgence of human Passions  As I am drawing toward the Conclusion of  Pliny  's Works I shall finish my Remarks upon him and his Translator in the Remander of this Letter  In a Note upon the fortysixth Epistle  optimo Viro  is called an Idiom but I cannot see for what Reason And my Lord might very well have rendered it literally  the best of Men  without appearing the least stiff in the Stile of that Expression  Trajan  's Speech in the last Part of the Comment upon the fiftyfirst Epistle puts me in mind of a Humour of the Widow in this Country who was some Time ago married and the Morning after she appeared caparisoned with an Horsewhip pinned to her Girdle and told her Husband she meant always to wear it about her that it might be ready whenever she deserved his Chastisement  In the sixtyseventh Epistle read  since  for  scarce    I have gone through the rest of this Book which finishes the Volume and find nothing more fit to be remarked upon that is not already taken Notice of by the Commentator much better than I can pretend to do and this in general is the Reason why I have made so few Observations upon the whole Work As to the Freedom I have taken in some Criticisms both with the Author and his Commentator I shall excuse myself with a Quotation out of the thirteenth Epistle of the third Book  If I find you so frank as to make Objections to particular Passages I shall take  it for granted that you are pleased with all the rest  And so indeed I am  I think the twentieth Epistle of the fourth Book would be proper to conclude these Remarks with changing the Word  Grief  for  Sense  and applying that Letter to  Pliny  and  Orrery    And now let me assure you my dear  Fanny  that I feel a real Concern upon the Close of this Work at parting with three such Men as  Trajan Pliny  and  Orrery  But one I hope to know in this Life and shall die in Trust of meeting the others in the next and you my bestloved Girl shall know them too  Together to the Realms of Bliss well go  'Till then let us live and love for while we do one I am sure we shall do the other  Adieu  my Heart's Delight  Henry  LETTER CXCVIII  My Dearest  HARRY  I AM vastly provoked at your not receiving my Letters regularly I am uneasy about my  Saturday  's Letter though the Disappointment only could make it of any Consequence As I have nothing extraordinary to say at present  with Regard to myself and have not Time to answer your's I should not write Tonight but on Account of the inclosed which I am sure will give you Pleasure as my dear Lady 's Sentiments correspond with your's I have wrote a very long Letter to her and my Fingers ache to such a Degree I can hardly hold the Pen I hope I have now returned the Compliment you paid me by bringing her Letter to  We will prescribe the whole Alphabet only to very weak or very irascible People for I think the five Vowels might serve to surmount any Resentment we could have to each other However if you like the  Alluding to the Poem in the  Tatler  intitled "A Cure for a Scold"  WaterBottle best I will always have one by my Side  Adieu  my Love  LETTER CXCIX  My  FANNY  I RECEIVED your's with Lady 's inclosed and am pleased to find she does not speak like a Courtier to your Pride but addresses herself like a Philosopher and a Friend  to your Prudence It is certain that no Man partakes of the Lowness of his Situation while he appears above it And the Question in Life is not what Part we acted but how we performed it What she says is extremely just  that Misfortunes should be rather a Spur than a Bridle to us  as a Man exerts himself more in a Bog than upon Terra firma and the noble Mind like a TennisBall always rises in Proportion to it's Fall  Caesar  said bravely that he would rather be the first Man in a Village than the second at  Rome  and I would rather appear above a low Part than beneath a great one  I am glad to find that you have contracted the Maxim of  Athenodorus  to the Vowels tho' by mentioning the  WaterBottle  I suspect you mean to add the  Liquids  to them Now I will cut the Work still shorter for I will confine myself not only to the Vowels but to two of them in Honour of ourselves For I think upon any such Occasion we need have Regard but to U and I and to shorten it still further let us consider those two Letters but as Diphthong  I have been employed these three Mornings in two of the most opposite Amusements that one can well imagine in sorting and reading all your charming Letters filled with Kindness Love and Truth and pulling the grey Hairs  out of my Head Not as one might conjecture to leave myself yet the Appearance of Youth sufficient to justify so much Fondness but for a very extraordinary Reason to present my lively gay young Love with a Locket of them You have several Times wished that I was many Years older than I am in return for which I shall dedicate every Symptom of Age to you still as they appear  My Fiddle as my Nerves unstrung  Venus  upon thy Shrine be hung  Cupid  found a Retreat  Now we are upon the Subject of Age we may talk of the Epitaphs which I promised to frame for you and me The two I have thought of are "  Evasi  I have escaped" looking upon Death in that philosophic Light and "  Permutatio felix  A happy Exchange" considering Death as becomes a Christian the Means of an Exchange for Immortality I give you your Choice of them tho' as I hope and shall take Care that we shall be both laid under one Stone I will have them both inscribed as of one Sentence to shew that in Death as well as Life I consider you Part of myself  And in Death they were not divided  The Epitaph then shall stand thus  Evasimus Permutatio felix  In the Name of God Amen  Believe me your's  Henry  LETTER CC  I AM almost angry with my sweet Love for not attributing his Disappointment to any Cause rather than my Neglect I did indeed write by  Saturday  's Post to Lady to  Kitty  and to you How extremely rude must Lady think me as there is no Doubt but all my Letters miscarried I am vastly uneasy about them but particularly for her's it being of most Consequence  I join with you in thinking that Friendship not only allows the Privilege of communicating our inmost Thoughts and of acknowledging the honest Pride we feel from the Exercise of any moral Virtue but that it is a Breach of that noble Intercourse to conceal even our Faults or Foibles For my Part I have shewn my Heart as naked to thy View as to the Eye of Heaven Real Friendship like true Love is understood by very few yet common in the Mouths of every one It can only be conceived by Minds capable of the most refined and disinterested Sentiments  Reserve will wound it and Distrust destroy  and this makes  Friends such Rarities below  I think that Persons of different Sexes who with a tolerable Understanding have had a sincere Affection for each other are most likely to be capable of real  Friendship for even the Remains of Love will create a Gentleness in our Manners and Complacency of Behaviour the Want of which is too often the Effect and Bane of common Friendships I declare solemnly I have felt a higher Satisfaction in considering myself as your first Friend than ever I did in thinking myself the Object of your Affection I know myself capable of retaining your Esteem because I will never do any Thing to forfeit it and therefore I receive greater Pleasure from any Mark of your Confidence than from the fondest Expressions of your Love Not but I shall ever wish to preserve that too as I have paid the Price for it by giving mine but we are in general fonder of what we have no Right to than what is justly our's  There is no Part of your Character so much indears you to me as the Tenderness and Humanity of your Disposition I have actually felt the same Transport in thinking of it as you have done in the Exercise my Heart has trembled and Eyes overflowed with Pleasure as if I had done some generous or humane Act myself  I do assure you that often in the extreme Fondness of my Heart when I have looked at and heard you with the sincerest Delight I have been ready to burst into Tears from reflecting that the Happiness I then enjoyed might some  Time prove an Aggravation of my Misery and sure there is no Anguish equal to that which arises from our departed Joys I do not remember I was ever so much affected at any thing I read as at a Passage of  Young  's which I met with during the Interregnum of our Loves  And she  was  mine and I  waswas  most bless'd  Gay Title of the deepest Misery  But I will have done with this melancholy Subject and I sincerely hope it will never more occur to my Remembrance  Your Brother and Sister have been with me all Day so that I must quit you sooner than I would Set down all the Blots and Blunders to their Account for though my Thoughts are fixed on you yet being obliged to converse with them makes both my Hands and Eyes to wander They have been vastly civil to me since I came to Town  I intreat you will inquire about my  Saturday  's Letter and believe me my dearest Life  Your sincerest and most affectionate Friend  Frances  LETTER CCI  HENRY  to  FRANCES    Musaeum  I AM concerned at the Account of your Health You say you do not know what ails you but that you are sick and have lost your Appetite and Spirits Now take it thus and you will find the true State of your Disorder You have lost your Spirits consequently your Appetite and then it is no Wonder you are sick But the Cause of this Progression is yet to be related namely the Fretting you have humoured yourself in upon this late Occasion I wish my dear  Fanny  I could make you as good a Philosopher in Practice as you are in Theory You have made me both for which I am more beholden to you than to my Mother for my Birth She made me but an Animal you have made me a Man  I desire you will send me Lady 's Letter when you have answered it I am interested in the smallest Circumstance relating to you and am vain of every Compliment paid you  I think there is something very pretty in your Sentiments about Friendship You have carried the Thought farther than I had ever considered it by saying even our Faults or Foibles we  should not hide in such an Intercourse but I think there is even a certain Honesty in such an open Dealing for Friendship such as deserves that Name is an Union for Life and as in the meaner Partnerships of Trade we should reveal the Drawbacks of Debts or Insufficiencies upon our Stock how much more nice ought we to be in this noble and generous Society I think with you that Persons of different Sexes are most likely to preserve the best and most lasting Friendships and really believe that in the very few Marriage States which can be deemed happy the most perfect Concords of this Kind are to be found That Gentleness of Manners and Complacency of Behaviour which you mention may be considered as the Essence of Virtue rather than the mere Ornament of it and the  French  Writers treat of them in this pretty Light under the Title of "Les petites Morales" If strict Philosophy will not admit of this Expression they may certainly be allowed the Marks of the most amiable Virtues as they are sure Signs of Goodnature Humility and Humanity As some of the Sages said that Virtue need but put on a visible Form to bewitch Mankind with her Charms I think that what is meant by the Term Goodbreeding must certainly be the Dress she would appear in Mere naked Virtue perhaps may be a fit Contemplation for an Angel but she must  be cloathed with Decency to be admired by Man A blessed Spirit as it has no  Sense to ake  can bear the transcendent Splendor of Truth but her Glory is too dazzling for the human Mind to bear without a Veil as we look at the Sun through a smoaked Glass and are obliged to use Shades to mark the Beauties of Proportion  Upon this Occasion has happily occurred to me Part of the most noble Descriptions of the State of the Blessed that can be conceived though it was imagined by an unenlightened Heathen  Plotinus  a Philosopher of the  Platonic  Sect A Translation will serve you as well as the Original  In Heaven the blessed Inhabitants enjoy a happy Tranquillity having Truth itself for the Author of their Being for their Essence and Support They see Things there not only as they are produced but contemplate them in their first Principles and behold themselves in those about them for there all Things are obvious and perspicuous nothing obscure nothing opposite All is conspicuous to all intrinsical throughout for Light everywhere blends with Light Every one has every thing in himself and beholds the same in others All Things then are everywhere and immense Splendor shines through all Motion there is perfectly pure for one Motion  does not impede another Rest also there is never disturbed by Change for it is not blended with unstable Nature There dwells Beauty in the Abstract independent of Form or Matter We may farther presume that those who behold these Things can never be fatigued in the Contemplation of them nor can any Satiety occur to occasion any Fatigue for there will be no Emptiness in any one which by being filled and satiated may put an End to their Enjoyment  I have here given you the Sense of this beautiful Passage though I am afraid I have but poorly imitated the Spirit of it The whole Author is extremely fine and this is but a very small Part of the great Description he has so gloriously attempted but it was all which fairly occurred to me upon the Subject of this Letter and as I thought had some Relation to it  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    THE Passage you quote from  Plotinus  is indeed a fine one I have never met with any thing which gives so strong and beautiful an Idea of a future State What a  Disgrace to our modern Philosophers and Divines who have the Light of Revealed Religion for their Guide to be so far outdone by the noble Spirit and Blaze of unenlightened Heathenism  I look upon Les petites Morales to be as absolutely necessary to make a Man happy in this Life as true Morality to intitle him to or render him capable of Happiness in the next  There is something so extremely elegant and tender in the first Part of your second Letter as would render Life pleasing under the severest Agonies if by enduring them I might repay such Goodness Indeed thou dearest kindest best of Men I will do all I can for the Recovery and Preservation of that Health whose only Charm to me is being dear to you I wish I could tell you I was better I think I grow worse every Day but I do not make the least Doubt of my Recovery for there is nothing dangerous in my Disorder though I suffer more than I thought my Constitution could possibly bear I am convinced I should mend immediately if you were with me This may appear childish but sick Folks and Children are fanciful alike Tell me then thou dear Physician to my Soul and Body when wilt thou give me new Life and Health I consider myself in the same Situation as the little Butterfly you mention insensible to every thing  round me or rather like  Promotheus  's Man of Clay  I stand unmov'd and wait in dull Suspence  Thy heav'nly Charms to warm me into Sense  I can no more than you determine whether it is kind or cruel to prolong the Life of your little Favourite What does it subsist on during the Time of it's natural Existence If you know and can provide it with natural Sustenance we may suppose it dies only for Want of the Sun's Heat then to revive it with an artificial Warmth cannot be Cruelty But if it's Food as I believe be of the Summer's Pride and is not now to be found in the vegetable World I fear the poor little Insect suffers by your Fondness as Annihilation is preferable to Misery Besides I fancy a Butterfly does not die but according to the  Pythagorean  System changes it's Form and Being This I am not quite clear in though I have met with some poetical Simile that warrants this Opinion  To consider our present State of Existence as rational Beings who hope for a glorious Immortality it must appear the highest Act of Folly to aim at lengthening it even for a Moment It is as absurd as to suppose a Prisoner should desire to continue in a Dungeon when he may have Liberty to quit it and enjoy all the Delights of Life Yet were there any  Person who had been born and bred in such a dismal Situation that had entered into Ties and Connections with Wretches as unhappy as himself he would I dare say feel a strong Reluctance at entering into a happier State when he must part from those who had been Partners in his Misery and all the Solace of it So we though Providence has wisely ordered that Disappointments Pain and Loss of Friends should by Degrees unloose the Hold we take of this dim Spot that our Loves our Friendships should be torn asunder that even our Desires and Passions should decay and leave us scarce a Wish on Earth yet stripped of and abandoned by all that makes Life pleasing left as it were naked on a barren Shore when we have nothing else to grasp at we lay Hold on our own frail and feverish Beings and seem to find a  Pain  in being separated from  Pain    There are five or six People talking round me It is impossible for me to know what I write But this I know that I live but in the earnest Hope of being your's here and hereafter  Frances  LETTER CCIII  My Dear  FANNY  YOU may see by my Paper that I am not at home and consequently have not your last Letter with me to answer therefore you can expect no other Reason for my writing to you now but to shew you I would not neglect it even for one Post though unprepared with my best Help your Loveinspiring Senseinditing Epistles  The  dined with me Today and hurried me home with them this Evening I would have excused myself but that I avoid the Appearance of any thing which looks queer and I am apt to suspect that a Person has but the Appearance of Sense Courage or Philosophy who affects to manifest them upon trifling Occasions I declare that I have of late so entirely given myself up to the charming Pleasures of Solitude that I begin to endure Company as one plays a bad Hand of Cards not for the Enjoyment of the Sport but merely to keep one's Self within the Game This Turn of Mind has sometimes so alarmed me that I have argued the Point with myself pro and con but have declared for the Pleasures of retired and philosophic Leisure upon this  Reasoning that it is possible some Accident or Misfortune of Life may hereafter deprive me of the Enjoyment of Society for few and rare Friends are found at the Poor the Sick or the Prisoner's Levee but Death alone can rob me of the Heartapproving rational Joys of Solitude If I quitted the  Converse  of the World out of an Austereness of Manners or a Severity of Morals I might justly appear in the uncouth and unphilosophic Light of a Misanthrope but when I retire in order to prepare myself for a  better  I seem to myself to act the Part of one who takes a larger Scope in view than the scanty Horizon of this narrow Globe I retire to converse with you and to make Assignations with thee my charming Seraph where I shall have Myriads of unjealous Rivals in thy Love in the Harmony of thy Sense and Virtue It is you alone who can make me endure Society as it was you only who have inspired me with those Helps which can enable me to live alone You need not be apprehensive that such abstracted Speculations as these can ever abate the Warmth of my Affection to you for what is my Love to my dearest  Fanny  but that  Taste  for Virtue which I hinted at in a former Letter and that high Admiration for Beauty Harmony and Order which is the proper Contemplation of the truly philosophic Mind So that even my Relish for every thing that is amiable may be  considered but as a Part of that Love and Esteem which I bear to you  I slipt away from Cards to write to you and the Bell rings for Supper So I must unwillingly conclude my Letter though most willingly conclude myself my charming Girl  Ever your's  Henry  LETTER CCIV  My Dear  FANNY  THE Dependence you express upon my doing every thing for our mutual Happiness was not necessary to encourage me to do so upon all Occasions but if I needed any Inducement that Confidence alone would be sufficient to oblige me to it and I shall never attempt to overrule your Will but to better inform it or the more effectually to answer the great End of all my Thoughts and Actions namely your Happiness and Establishment and my own only through such charming Means My not going to  London  before this is one Instance I may give that I prefer both our Interests before our Pleasure and if I have not fixed the Day at your frequent Request it is  because I cannot be certain of it yet however I can answer you that before ten Days from this I shall have the unfeigned Delight of seeing my sweet Girl  I cannot help being angry with you for such an ungenerous and impious Wish as you make in your last Letter What Advantage could possibly accrue to me from your Death who as I said before only intend nay only wish or desire and am only capable of Happiness through your Means How have I  undeserved  from you or what Merits have those Persons you so falsely stile my Friends toward you that their Satisfaction is so unkindly and unwarrantably preferred before mine What Comfort could they afford me for your Loss or where else could I expect to find it It is too late in Life for me to begin the World anew My Habits are grown too strong to be counteracted now What a Turn must my whole Set of Ideas take and how many refined Pleasures must I  unlearn  or lose the Relish of before I could be satisfied with the Enjoyment of any other Woman I have often quarrelled with you upon such Subjects and take it very unkindly that you will not recollect yourself a little before you treat me with so much Ingratitude and Ungenerosity Indeed  I  is angry with  U  in Spight of all the Letters of the Alphabet from  Alpha  to  Omega  which is the  Order your dear Idea presents itself to my Thoughts in Repent thou Suicide and Homicide in one  Remember to write to me by  Tuesday  's Post directed to and on  Thursday  direct to me at which is my Way home I will not excuse you these two Posts because I shall want your Company on the Road  Adieu my Treasure for by a Turn upon the Words of Scripture I may call you so as my Heart is with you  Henry  LETTER CCV  THE sincere Pleasure I received from my dear  Harry  's last Letter is indeed sufficient to make me wish for Life nay a long one to enable me to repay his generous Tenderness Believe me my sweet Love your Kindness is not thrown away for all the poor Return which I can make is most sincerely your's in Thought in Word in DeedAnd if I really am so blest as to contribute to your Happiness well may you call me ungenerous and ungrateful for wishing to exchange that Bliss even for the Joys of Immortality The Transport which I feel from thinking I am dear to you is much too great to be expressed  I am I ever will be your's Dispose my Life my Being as you please Thou art the Lord of meHaste then thou dear Author of my Happiness haste to complete it by thy muchloved muchlongedfor Presence  I am still une pauvre Solitaire and look upon myself to be the truest female Recluse that ever was as my Confinement Solitude and Fasting are dictated by Choice not NecessityYet I am afraid this voluntary Restraint is not founded in Reason or Virtue My Moderation may be compared to that of an Epicure who though he may have a good Appetite eats sparingly of a coarse Dinner but provide him with Delicacies and he shews the Glutton So I go seldom abroad see no Company at home never think of public Diversions and pass my Life in a State of Indifference to the Objects which are within my Reach but were it in my Power to enjoy the Feast of Reason in thy Converse I should quickly lose the Appearance of SelfDenial and gladly indulge myself in the extreme Enjoyment of the highest Pleasuresthose of seeing hearing loving and being loved by thee  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCVI  My sweetest dear Girl  I AM at a Loss for Epithets fond or expressive enough to address you with but must refer self to the Intuition of angelic Minds to shew you how far short the warmest Terms of human Language fall of that sincere Affection and tender Love I bear you  I am surprised at the Weakness of your Concern upon my mentioning my dying for surely a Man is not the nearer though he may be the better prepared for it by his making a Will nay even the very Approach of it ought to alarm us no more than it should a fond Parent that his Child was growing taller for Death in the Philosophy of a Man or the Hope of a Christian is to be considered not as a Change of our State but an Improvement of it However I will indulge your Tenderness so far as to speak no more upon this Head but am pleased to find I am even with you for some unkind Hints much stronger than mine upon this Subject in one of your late Letters  I have been to see the large Manufacture at as I have engaged in the same and it has given me great Satisfaction though it would make any one of less Spirit than myself despair of bringing so vast a Work to Perfection from  the complexed Machinery various Business intense Application and large Sums of Money and Credit which are necessary to carry it on yet believe me that every Difficulty which occurred has but strengthened my Resolution to pursue it It would surprise and startle your Philosophy at the same Time to see so many different Machines performing the Parts of rational Agents and requiring no farther Assistance from Man than to set them in Motion and to preserve their Courses regular which is no more than what often Man from Man requires as Patients from Physicians Nay some of them like a Person in Health perform their Parts by the mere Help of the Elements only and if the sole Difference between these and Animals be that the first regularly labours to pursue the Design of it's Formation while the other through Caprice is capable of disappointing the Ends of it's Creation I do not think that living Creatures have much to boast of in the Superiority of their Mechanism Man indeed as exercised in the Contemplation of Truth Beauty Harmony and Order and employed in the Practice of Virtue Morality and Religion is in Reality a noble and exalted Creature but the manyheaded Monster the vulgar Herd who are insensible to these great Advantages I take to be a more imperfect Instrument than a Windmill or a Loom  Adieu Adieu  LETTER CCVII  Dear  FANNY  I AM just returned from my Expedition to  Scotland  and to give you my Opinion of it I need only say that since I was obliged to go I am glad it is over  You cannot imagine in what Light every thing both at Bed and Board appeared to me who have been used all my Life to travel through the best Roads in  England  for though I am no great Epicure yet I look upon Cleanliness not to be any extraordinary Luxury though  Mandeville  calls it so when he wants to help out a disingenuous Argument  I have rode several Days through this quondam Kingdom and was so persuaded that I strayed into  Gulliver  's Country of  Hounhymns  that I was almost tempted to alight from my Horse and swear Allegiance to him for I could not perceive a Grain of Corn through all the Fields but Oats nor any one House that was too good for a Stable And when at last I chanced to espy a  Garden  of Wheat I rejoiced like the shipwrecked Sailor who thinking himself cast away upon a desart Island when he observed a Circle described on the Sands cried out  Courage my Friends for human Creatures inhabit here  There is a Saying among Foreigners who observe the Cleverness of the Generality of the  Scotch  Gentlemen who travel abroad that  Scotland  keeps all her Fools at home But I think they are mistaken in this Particular for really those of that Nation whom I have had any Sort of Commerce with are "ne Feuls" I shall not press this Remark farther as I think all national Reflections both unphilosophical and unjust I shall take Leave of you now for as my ingenious Hostess of the  Garter  often expresses herself I am tired after my Fatigue  Adieu  my own  Fanny  Henry    LETTER CCVIII  Dear  FANNY  YOU desired to hear from me on  Wednesday  but you may see my Impatience in writing to you a Post sooner  I had a very direct and obstinate Wind in my Face all the Day and very disagreeable Weather of Rain and Hail however I jogged on hither to shew that neither Wind or Weather should get the better of me I suffered greatly from the Cholic but chewed  Rheubarb all the Way Mutton Chops was the Word and now your Health goes round which is a just Manner of speaking as I pledge myself to that Toast every Glass  I direct this to  India  because I know you are to dine there Tomorrow and might be from home before the Post reached your Lodgings My Love to the Company and remember that the Council of Six is still complete as I have left my Deputy with you So observe that upon every Question you are to claim the Right of a double Voice which is the same as if I were present for I am sure I shall never differ from you in any Opinion  Her Taste was his own  Adieu  LETTER CCIX  My Dearest  HARRY  I AM still a poor lonely Wretch Judge from your own Heart how earnestly I wish for you and how tenderly and constantly my Thoughts are employed in lamenting your Absence and the cruel Necessity which occasions it It is now a Month by common Calculation since we parted what a Length of Time when measured by the Pangs of Absence and  yet you do not speak of coming to me I envy you the complicated Hurry of Business you are engaged in It divides your Anxiety and prevents your thinking too earnestly on any one Subject I rejoice at it while I feel the Uneasiness of having my every Sentiment and Idea fixed on the only Object which can give me Pain or Pleasure thy dear Self alone  Your kind your charming Letter has indeed raised my Spirits to an higher Degree of Chearfulness than they have known for some Time past But while the elegant Tenderness which you there express elates my Heart to a kind of Rapture it necessarily increases my Sorrow for our Separation  So Mourning comes by Bliss convey'd  And ev'n the Sweets of Love allay'd  My dearest Life may be perfectly assured that there is no Enjoyment however dear to me that I would not readily sacrifice to the Pleasure of obliging him For this Reason I was picqued at your seeming to suspect me of Irregularity Take my Word that the dear little Object of our mutual Care and I hope Bliss shall not suffer through any Fault of mine that I can avoid I am in Bed every Night by Twelve and up at Nine If my lying so long be a Fault I will not cover it with a Falsehood But if you knew the many restless and uneasy Hours I pass in Bed you would more wonder at my rising so early than  at my lying so late You must allow something to the Weakness of my Condition and consider the vast Difference between this and my former Way of living and you will find my Nine almost equal to your Five in the Morning  I am surprized has not wrote to you but not at your Sentiments on the Occasion They are consistent with that good Sense and Steadiness of Mind which accompanies my dear practic Philosopher through every Action of his Life  Adieu my dearest  Harry  May we never be able to determine the only Point which I hope and believe we shall ever dispute on and may each incessantly endeavour through the Course of our Lives to make the only coveted or contested Superiority between us that of loving most appear doubtful even to our latest Moments  Adieu  LETTER CCX  Dear  FANNY  I PITY you not for being alone knowing your Mind and the Use you are capable to make of it though by your mentioning your Solitude in such a forlorn Way I am afraid you  have not a proper Set of Books to read Indeed your present Study is but thinly scattered with them and mere Amusement is but a sorry Comfort in Solitude which requires the best Helps of Reflection moral Philosophy and Religion to support which light Reading is but ill qualified to afford us I do not mean to make you an abstracted Enthusiast by the Study I shall recommend to you But what I shall prescribe will not only qualify you for Retirement but for the World too at least for that Part of it which is worthy of your Sense Spirit and Virtue to hold Society with When you have engaged in such a Course of dead Authors you will have the less Reason to lament my Absence for you will there find much better that Sense Philosophy and Virtue which you are so partial to compliment me with and the real Excellencies of those Things may perhaps be as dead in me as they are in them  I do not mention my going to you because the Time was fixed already for that which is about the Time of your  c  and you know my Situation too well to desire it seriously sooner  My Pet you surely could not imagine I expected you should be up at Five in the Morning I only mentioned my own Practice to vaunt myself not to prescribe to you and shall be satisfied with cutting you off only one Hour in  the Morning But to shew you how indulgent I shall be to you at the same Time I will allow you to go to Bed an Hour or even two earlier at Night  has played a very knavish Prank lately with Regard to me  Tom  can inform you But I shall not expose him for two extraordinary Reasons because I do not believe any other Man would decline it and because I have a sincere Picque to him upon an Occasion I mentioned to you some Time ago  Adieu  my Heart's Transport    Henry  LETTER CCXI  Dear  HARRY  THOUGH I make no Doubt but your good Sense and Philosophy will prevent your being uneasy from the Account you received of my Illness yet I think it my Duty to inform you that I am better than when you heard last I believe few People ever suffered more in the Time than I did from  Tuesday  Noon to the same Hour on  Wednesday  But I make no Account of all I have endured since it has pleased the Almighty to spare the dear  Life which I am infinitely more anxious for than my own I hope still to preserve it and am determined rather to sacrifice myself than it I have four of your Letters before me but cannot pretend to answer any of them I write in Bed and can hardly see  You say I talk of dying in a splenetic Way You are mistaken  Harry  Death has as few Terrors for me as for most People I talked of his Approach as a Thing expected but not feared If I betrayed any Weakness it must have been from the Thoughts of parting with you not Life for indeed I have as little Reason to be fond of a painful Existence as you have to be "displeased and disobliged" at my being concerned for our present or future Separation I am of Opinion that it is Strength of Body not Mind I want to render me agreeable to you If I were a Foot taller and proportionably robust I should be a cleverer Person than I am but since  we cannot by taking Thought add one Cubit to our Stature  it is in vain to complain of my small Size or Want of Strength or Spirits  I shall not mention your Coming any more I have already spoke my Sentiments Your own Discretion be your Guide  Adieu my dear Stoic May I if I live be able to acquire the Strength you wish me possessed of or may you in some Degree become  more indulgent as better used to my Weakness and Deficiencies both of Mind and Body  LETTER CCXII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I SEND you Mr  Lyttelton  's Monody which I am charmed with though I think there appears more Poetry than Love in it Not that the Grief is not  well  but that it is too well expressed which a Person who really felt could not perhaps so aptly describe And methinks I perceive more of the Poet's Art than of the Mourner's Sorrow  If indeed he be truly sincere I declare that I would rather have Mr  Lyttelton  my Widower than be the Wife of any other Man in the World except yourself For then I should have had the highest Happiness this World can boast of the being beloved and esteemed by a Man of Sense Taste and Virtue the Merit of which must insure the Happiness of the next which if higher than that rises above the Power of human Wish to desire or of human Wit to conceive  There is one Criterion of Mr  Lyttelton  's Sincerity which I have established in my own  Mind and that is his marrying or not marrying again  Adieu  LETTER CCXIII  YOU tell me that your Picture is improved into your own Likeness at last then take it home immediately lest the Painter should attempt to cheat me with a  Helen  of  Guido  's  Poetry and Painting they say are Sister Arts but  Hudson  has so raised my Jealousy by his Success that I shall endeavour to make them Rivals too  Character of  FANNY    With all of Wit that Nature can bestow  And more of Sense than ev'n her Sense can know  Her Heart a Mine by Modesty conceal'd  Untaught to glow 'till Love the Gem reveal'd  With Tenderness and Converse sweet to prove  At once the Joys and calm Delights of Love  Her Fancy lively and her Judgment true  Perfect in Nature and in Morals too  Her Air coquettish but her Mind a Prude  Her Body wanton but her Soul not lewd  Rivals by Turns her Mind and Person charms  Allays the Lover and the Husband warms  Who pleas'd at first and yet at last pleas'd more  My future Hope and yet my present Store  These are thy Worth not Dow'r told down in Gold  Too dearly purchas'd for thy Merit sold  Thy Virtues not my Art these Numbers frame  Oh more my Inspiration than my Theme  Henry  LETTER CCXIV  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I RECEIVED the Monody and am as much charmed with it as you are but I could not help smiling at your jealous Criticism I do not look upon the Poem in the Light that you do for it affected me in a higher Concern that it was possible for your Death to inspire me with every Sentiment of Grief there expressed without the Poetry to publish them to the World  To a Person used to read and write Poetry Figures Allusions and Numbers are as familiar as plain Prose is to other People  For the Numbers came  Poets have generally pleaded their Incapacity on Account of Grief but this was always in  order to raise the Merit of the Poem  Tickel  says  Grief unaffected suits but ill with Art  And flowing Numbers with a broken Heart  However he has contrived to sigh out as beautiful an Elegy as ever was written in any Language  Waller  said that Poets excel only in Fiction but this was rather an ingenious Apology for writing better on  Cromwell  than on  Charles  It had more of Wit than Criticism in it or if there was any thing of the latter it must be true only of Heroic Poetry because neither the Actions Virtues or real Characters of Men are high enough to adorn the Epic Verse  But there is a Mixture of Tenderness and Dignity which form the Characteristic of Elegy that agrees perfectly well with Figures which it naturally inspires and the more sincere the Grief the bolder will these be of course  There is one Authority which puts an End to any further Criticism upon this Subject  Horace  says  If you would make me weep you must first drop Tears yourself  Which shews that the Beauty of Elegy must rise in Proportion to the Sincerity of the Mourner  I remember the elder  Palma  whose Taste in Music I was fond of sat down one Day to compose something for me perhaps I was in Love at that Time for I desired he would make  it expressive of the most melting Tenderness Upon which he replied "Il faut pleurer donc" and as the  Italians  have their Passions at Will he began to sigh and actually wrought himself up to a Flow of Tears while he was writing  But I might have saved you the Trouble of all this Criticism only by referring you to Mr  Lyttelton  's Character who is far from being so flight a Man as to  play  the Poet upon so serious and affecting a Subject And there is one Particular which proves to me his Sincerity beyond all Doubt which is that among a great Choice and Variety of his truly classical and poetic Writings this Poem is I think the Chef d'Oeuvre  All the Fault I find with Mr  Lyttelton  is that he did not underwrite himself upon this Occasion for there is a certain gallant Pride in an ingenuous Nature which tempts it to fall short even of the Praise it thinks is due and is willing to bestow lest it should be mistaken for Adulation However there is at the same Time a certain Fondness in the Lover which inclines him to give Immortality to the Object of his Passion which is not to be hoped for without an Exertion of the fullest Powers of Poesy  I pity a Poet's Grief more than any other Man's for his natural Warmth Tenderness of Sentiment and Liveliness of Imagination give  Sorrow a Power of sinking deeper in his Heart than others can possibly be affected with When a plain Man loses a Mistress Wife Child or Friend he laments merely for the Loss of so much Property But when these dear Connections are torn off from a Person of a delicate Taste he feels as if he had lost Part of himself  Animae Dimidium  nay worse for the Remainder is a Burden to him  Your Criterion I will not admit of for a Man who is sincere in his Grief for the Loss of a Wife is the more likely to marry again When Pleasures are flown Nature strongly solicits the Recovery of them The chaste nuptial Joys engross the whole Man and form his Taste and Sentiments entirely to such social Enjoyments which by fond Indulgence become at last his sole Scheme of Happiness and when those charming Ties are dissolved he has the World as it were to begin anew and it is surely then more natural and more rational too to endeavour to renew the Pleasures we have been so well acquainted with and approved of than to attempt a spiritless Succedaneum to them  So that if ever your  Crisis  should come to pass we ought not to doubt his Sincerity to the last Wife but rather say that he had paid a very high Compliment to his future one  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCXV  THE Heat of the Day and the Coolness of my unperforming Nag obliged me to stop here to Dinner When the Sun's Strength declines and my Horse recovers his I shall make a desperate Push for St  Alban's    Among the Parcel of loose Papers which I put into my Pocket for Amusement on the Road I find the inclosed Letter from  Oliver Cromwell  to his Wife which I send you as Part of a Comment upon  Hudibras  which I left you reading You may observe from this Letter the hypocritical and fanatic Stile of the leading Men at that Aera which will give you Light into the Characters of Knight and 'Squire  Though it is but three Hours since we parted I found I could not eat my Dinner without writing to you for my Love is stronger than my Hunger The Eagerness of Appetite sometimes makes me omit a Grace and Sleep too often inclines me to neglect a Prayer at Night but at Bed or Board I never forget to think of you or cease to wish you most earnestly a Participation of such Entertainment as I can afford you at either  I shall call at in my Road this Evening where I expect to find the good Lady  in such a Condition  as is her Custom always in the Afternoon  There is something remarkably odious in this Vice in Women as Custom and Education are against it and that it has not even the Excuse of Nature or Temptation on it's Side  When Women err let Nature be their Guide  Love has some soft Excuse for female Pride  For my Part I should think the Embraces of a Harlot chaster than the Fondness of such a Wife  What a shocking Thing must it be to any Woman's Reflection at a sober Interval to think that by this Vice she has rendered herself the Subject of Lust without being the Object of Desire For such must be the Consequence when Passions are inflamed while Reason is extinct and as the Wife of  Bath  says  There is a Rule I never knew to fail  c  And what a dreadful Situation must that unhappy Man be in who thinks he has no Security over his Wife's Chastity but the natural Abhorrence which her Vice creates For in such a State one could only think her a fit Paramour for an Incubus which is a Species of Daemon that is reported to hold criminal Commerce with dead Bodies But enough of this vile Subject  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCXVI  My Dearest  Rediviva  I RECEIVED your Letter of last Post wrote by your own dear Hand which gave me extreme Transport What your Secretary said of your Health or rather of your Life which I was for a thousand Years alarmed about could not make my Mind easy 'till I had the Confirmation from yourself How I passed the Age between the two last Posts would be too tedious a Detail to trouble you with now  I was ill for several Days of the worst Sort of Illness an Inattention to Reading and a Lowness of Spirits It was upon these Hints that I wrote to you for the Precedent of a Will tho' I pretended it was for another Person for fear of alarming you and you cannot imagine what a Shock it gave me that I had deferred a Matter of such Consequence to you and to our dear Pledge so long I wrote that Letter from my Bed and lay down between every Paragraph  What a Sympathy was between us at the same Time for I think we fell ill and recovered at the same Instant How lucky it was too that neither of us knew the other was ill 'till we had both recovered  I am no farther displeased at your having made Use of  our  Money than that you should mention it In a Fortnight from this Date I design to be in Town neither my Health or Business will permit me sooner  Put up the inclosed along with my Papers Farewell my redeemed my dearest Life  Henry  The Paper which he inclosed was his Will in the Wrapper of which was the following Writing  AS my Marriage which I hereby publish which I have privately owned to some Friends already and which I hope long before these Seals shall be broke open I shall find myself at Liberty to acknowledge to all the World may surprize some of my Relations and Friends to whom I would living or dying give Satisfaction in any Particular relating to myself I shall leave this Declaration behind me for their Perusal  I was not overreached into this Match by Art nor hurried into it by Passion but from long Experience of her Sense and Worth I reasoned myself into it And that I have not had any Cause to change my Opinion since may be seen by my leaving this Writing uncancelled at my Death  I considered that there were three Things necessary in a Wife which the World or myself should approve Money to accommodate my Fortunes Birth to satisfy the Pride of my Relations and Sense to render my own Life happy  I considered that it was an extraordinary Chance for one Man to compass all three any one of which being as much good Luck as generally falls to one Man's Share and the last the most seldom There was then no Dispute which of them I should prefer considering that I was at that Time thirtysix Years of Age and that  a Man who is born of a Woman has but a short Time to live  and a much shorter to be happy  I considered that I had formed my own Mind and made my own Fortune too having never had Tutor or Patron to either and that my Friends ought surely to give me Leave to frame my own Happiness too  I found I had so engaged her Affections that no other Man could make her happy and so dallied with her Character that only myself could repair it Thus Honour Justice and Generosity concurred to what my Love and Reason had before approved  The Progress of our Loves may be seen in a Collection of our Letters which are at present in the Hands of a Friend and in reading them  one may see how our Studies Sentiments and whole Turn of Mind were adapted for each other So that in our Case it might most emphatically be said  Whom the Lord hath joined let no Man put asunder  Amen  I am in my constitutional Principles for a limited Monarchy and in my national Policy for the  Hanover  Succession and think that any one who differs from me must do so more from private Reasons than any Regard to the public Good  I am in my Religion a Christian but of the  Arian  Heresy as it is stiled by bigoted Councils I was for many Years a Deist 'till Dr  Clayton  Bishop of  Clogher  his Essay on Spirit and subsequent Writings upon the same Subject had reconciled the Doctrine of the Trinity to human Reason and metaphysical Science  "Humanum est errare et nescire  "Ens Entium miserere mei"  Buckingham  January    There was also inclosed in the Will the following Poem of  Pope  's  The UNIVERSAL PRAYER DEO OPT MAX  FATHER of All in ev'ry Age  In ev'ry Clime ador'd  By Saint by Savage and by Sage  Jehovah Jove or Lord  Thou Great First Cause least understood  Who all my Sense confin'd  To know but this that Thou art good  And that myself am blind  Yet gave me in this dark Estate  To see the Good from Ill  And binding Nature fast in Fate  Left Conscience free and Will  What Conscience dictates to be done  Or warns me not to do  This teach me more than Hell to shun  That more than Heav'n pursue  What Blessings thy free Bounty gives  Let me not cast away  For God is paid when Man receives  T' enjoy is to obey  Yet not to Earth's contracted Span  Thy Goodness let me bound  Or think thee Lord alone of Man  When thousand Worlds are round  Let not

and Peace my Lot  All else beneath the Sun  Thou know'st if best bestow'd or not  And let thy Will be done  To Thee whose Temple is all Space  Whose Altar Earth Sea Skies  One Chorus let all Being raise  All Nature's Incense rise  LETTER CCXVII  INDEED my  Harry  I wish to live for no other Reason but to make you amends for all your Goodness to me God grant my Power may be in any Proportion equal to my Will and we shall be the happiest Couple breathing And indeed I think I may without Vanity say I know no two Persons who seem better qualified for such a State than we are and therefore we must be thoroughly miserable if we are not entirely happy for both our Feelings and Sentiments are too delicate and refined to be capable of that Indifference which the generality of Mortals pass their Lives in For which Reason I am not displeased that your Situation and Circumstances prevented our living together before I was thoroughly acquainted  with you or myself but though I think I might now safely answer for my future Conduct I own my most fervent Wishes are sometimes damped with fearing that if ever we should live together you may grow weary of me or as  Milton  phrases it  Too much Converse thee perhaps may satiate  However I more often lament the sad Necessity which parts us and I think you more to be pitied in this Separation even than I am supposing our Love to be quite equal I have the Pains of Absence to combat with which are perhaps as much as I can bear You have these also joined to the Reflection of having attached yourself to me for no other Reason but the Hope of finding a sincere tender Friend and an agreeable Companion You have made it my Duty as well as Inclination to become the sole Partner and chief Solace of your every Care to smooth the rugged Path of Life and make the Uphill as well as the Descent less painful nay even your common Affairs and Oeconomy are so situated that you really want a reasonable Woman and a faithful Friend in whom you might confide Will you not think me vain if I say you are deprived of such a Person by our Separation When I consider the Opportunities I lose of endearing myself to you by numberless nameless Acts of Love and  Gratitude I lament each passing Moment and regret my fleeting Youth for oh I want unnumbered Ages beyond the common Date of Man to prove my fond faithful grateful Soul to thee Oh never may the Veil of Passion cloud it more  LETTER CCXVIII  My Dear  FANNY  What I meant to take Notice of in your Letters was to reprimand you for even supposing it possible I should ever cease to love you This Subject which you too often enter upon always alarms me for if ever I should love you less it must be owing to yourself I assure you that it never once enters into my Head but when you mention it and upon such Occasions I naturally reflect upon every Circumstance in our past present and future Lives which might possibly effect such a Change which is by no Means a healthful Contemplation On the contrary when my Thoughts and Reflections are left to my own Guidance I direct them to your Conversation  to your Letters to your Kindness to and Confidence in me I compare you to any other Woman and taking you all in all give you your Advantage I beg Leave to put you in Mind that this is not the first Time by many that I have warned you against this Indiscretion but your Wit does not always give Way to your Sense  And when we grasp the Happiness we wish  We call on Wit to argue it away  I have taken a great deal of Pains well rewarded to gain your Love but have taken a great deal more to teach you how to preserve mine That my Happiness depended upon it was not so strong a Reason to me as that I believed yours rested upon the same Foundation And I have been always more your Friend than your Lover not by exerting the first Character which my Sense and Reason sufficiently inclined me to but by restraining the latter which my Heart so strongly impelled me to And my best Love my first my last my only Love shall always find the Exercise of both these Characters exerted toward her while there is one Quality in her charming Composition which can be the proper Subject of either or rather she is very near being that clever Creature which is capable of happily blending both these Affections in one for which nothing more is necessary but to use that Understanding upon all Occasions  which you are capable of exerting upon some Nor did I mean to be ridiculous when I said you should not comb your Head or call a Coach without consulting it for you cannot imagine to what mean and trifling Offices good Sense will condescend to accompany us and perhaps it is in what the World esteem Trifles that a good Understanding should most employ itself for great or extraordinary Occasions generally direct their own Operations  Henry  P S  There is a Gentleman in the House where I am at present who has lately read his Recantation in order to preserve an Estate of about  l per Annum  He has a Brother at  Bourdeaux  who is a beneficed Priest from whom he received a Letter this Morning so full of Fire and Brimstone that it had almost thrown him into a Fit of Despair But I had the good Fortune to quiet his Mind after a Quarter of an Hour's Conversation and he begged I would reduce my Reasoning upon this Subject into the Form of a Letter which he would copy and send to his Brother I did so and as he has just done with it I send you the Original inclosed  Dear Brother  I Received your religious Exhortation and brotherly Admonition which I must acknowledge  to be in the Stile of a Priest but not in the Spirit of a Christian both for the same Reason that it so boldly and ignorantly denounces Damnation against those who differ from you in controverted Opinions and Forms even though in Essentials you should both agree as if the God of the Universe was but a King of one Nation of Men and declared War against all those who refused to submit to the same Policy This I speak in general with Regard to the uncharitable Sentiments of the whole Body of Christians against the Professors of every other Worship in the rest of the World But as to the Points in Question between you and me let me fairly state the Case between us  We believe and adore the same God and have the same Faith in the Trinity We also observe the same Principles of Morality hinted first to the antient Philosophers by the Light of Reason and afterwards more fully illustrated and made obvious to the meaner Capacities by the divine Grace of Revelation We both derive our Doctrines from the same Text of Holy Writ and are therefore both of the one only true and universal Church  The only Difference then between us is that in the Infancy of Christianity making it's Way through the Errors of Judaism and Heathenism it necessarily contracted a great  deal of the Foulness of Superstition in it's Passage and grew up incumbered with many idle Forms and useless and absurd Ceremonies which are by no Means authorized from Scripture There was likewise a good deal of Timeserving in the first Preachers after the Apostles for they were but Men and the Grace of Inspiration ceased with the Apostles These Men then finding it impossible to propagate this new Faith pure and intire against the superstitious Prejudices of antient and established Modes of Worship at least with that Dispatch which their Zeal required temporized with the Ceremonies and Idolatries of the Nations round them in order to be the better received among them They thought perhaps that as this Religion was first established by the Power of Miracles it must be maintained so and then introduced that absurd and unphilosophical Doctrine of Transubstantiation They thought too that to give Men Hopes of a Redemption even after Death and by the Merit of another's Devotion would naturally allure them to the Embracing this new Faith and so published the Doctrine of Supererogation which unluckily contradicts another broached at the same Time of Purgatory in the most express Manner as the last supposes that no Person can be virtuous or religious enough to save his Soul intire before he dies therefore must necessarily pass  through a Purgation and the other supposes that a Man may not only perform sufficient Acts to secure himself but the Overplus of his Merits may go toward the Salvation of another This Contradiction puts me in Mind of the old saying that  Lyars should have good Memories  Now you are drinking from the polluted Stream while we have recurred up to the pure Fountain and original Source Our Religion is deduced from the plain Text of the Scriptures your's from the sophistical Comments of the Priests When a Priest once asked a Protestant where his Religion was before  Luther  he answered humourously but not less justly by asking him where was his Face before it was washed  As for your Doctrine of seven Sacraments which you say we are deficient in I answer that we receive the Essence of them all in our two and the fewer Heads any Proposition is divided into the less Confusion there will be in the Comprehension of it  In short you seem to have more of the Subtilties of the Schools in your Reasoning than the Purity of Religion which the more simple it is is the more divine  What you say with Regard to the Saints Martyrs Virgins  c  is not only Idolatry in general but that particular Species of it imbibed by the Church with it's Nurse's Milk for the  assigning separate Charges to them over Nations Trades Distempers Perils by Land and Water  c  is the same Error among  Roman  Catholics which Theologicians attribute to the Heathen  Romans  who are said to have worshipped the only true God but mistook every Attribute for a distinct Deity  I shall trouble you no farther now upon these Subjects but conclude that if Religion be your Trade I would have you stick to it for a better you cannot get for that Purpose But if it is your Science quit it for a more virtuous and rational one and you can hardly go amiss I am in true Christian Charity  Dear Brother  Your's  c E K  LETTER CCXIX  My Dearest  FANNY  I HAVE filled one Letter so full of Business that I had not Room to take Notice of the pretty Part of your last but I shall not suffer the Post to go out without a Letter intirely in Answer to the refined Scruples you hint at in your's  Your Love for me does not destroy your present Happiness but rather constitutes it Those Apprehensions and that Uneasiness which sometimes afflict you are not indeed Part of your Happiness but are the natural Consequence of it in tender and delicate Minds for Absence or Fear of losing affects us always in Proportion to the Height of our Enjoyments Now those who desire their Pleasures to be less in order to rid themselves of their Pains know not what they wish for Apathy is a wretched Exchange for fond Sensations even with all their Incumbrances and to prefer such an Indolence of Mind is as if a Man should refuse an Estate because it was subject to QuitRent  As for your extraordinary Notion that perhaps your Love and Fondness for me may affect your Happiness hereafter this must be your own Fault and not the Nature of the Thing if it should The Love of God and the Love of Man are very different Things and both made our express Duties by distinct Commandments Therefore the latter cannot become a Crime of the Nature you apprehend even by it's Excess for parallel Lines can never interfere though extended infinitely But the smallest Portion of mortal Love or any other worldly Affection rises into a Sin when it intersects or runs counter to our Love of God the Duties of Religion or the Morals of Virtue Now  there is nothing surely in our chaste sincere and constant Regards toward each other which can possibly violate any of these high Concerns but rather strengthen us in them by inspiring our Hearts with the most grateful Sense toward Providence and possessing our Minds with the warmest Devotion and Thanksgiving to the Almighty for our mutual Happiness  To a Mind rightly formed the Paths of Heaven are strewn with Roses not stuck with Thorns  For Heaven is paid when Man receives  T'enjoy is to obey  And the Possession of all the Pleasures of Life bounded by Reason and Religion beyond which alone we taste the Bitterness of the Draught leads us not a Step out of the Road to Happiness hereafter referring every thing to God hymning out his Praise and submitting ourselves implicitly and humbly to the Justice Goodness and Wisdom of the divine Dispensations whenever Heaven shall think fit to withdraw any of it's  free Gifts  from us  As for the Concern and Unhappiness we shall unavoidably feel upon the Disappointment or Loss of those Things which our fond Hearts are set upon here you need not moralize so rigidly upon this Subject for this Grief like the Sighs and Tears which are the Consequence of bodily Pain will be attributed by him who  made us to the Weakness of that Nature with which he was pleased to cloath our Souls and in either Case it is not our Feelings but the Repinings Impatience or Despondency which create the Crime  You see I have here renewed the Strain of our former Correspondence for I am always pleased to enter into Subjects with you whenever you give me an Opportunity and if you would more frequently write to me in such a Manner as your last Letter to shew the Delicacy of your Sentiment and the Excellency of your Heart you would do yourself infinite Service in the Improvement of your own Mind and Virtue in the Securing of my Love and Esteem and at the same Time afford the most extreme Pleasure and Pride to my dearest  Fanny  's constant sincere and fond Husband  Henry  LETTER CCXX  My Dearest  HARRY  I THANK you for both your kind Letters They are lively Emblems of yourself sensible philosophic affectionate and polite  I am always sincerely pleased when any little Error or Weakness of mine gives my ever dear  Preceptor an Opportunity of setting his little Pupil right And the Trouble you have taken on this Occasion is doubly kind for as all the present and past Actions of your Life toward me may fully justify the Excess of my Affection for you another Man might have thought it needless to satisfy the nice Scruples of a weak or delicate Mind but thou the dear Dispenser of all Heaven's Bounty to me hast convinced me that it is both my Duty and Happiness as well as it was my Inclination to indulge that tender chaste and inviolable Affection which I feel for thee thou most deserving of thy Sex Nor would change even those Pains thy Absence gives me for the dull Insensibility in which the common Race of Mortals pass their Lives though I confess these Pains imbitter every Hour of Life for even while you are with me my Thoughts are continually filled with the sad Idea of our Partingand indeed it is dreadful to think of passing the Morn of Life the Season for tender Converse domestic Happiness and social Joys the Remembrance of which should gild the downhill Path the Evening Tide of Life in a State of Separation from all we love to have the fleeting Days of Youth pass like a Dream unmarked by any pleasing Aera or interesting Event Not but I agree with  Milton  and  Shaftsbury  that they know not their own Interest who wish never to be separated from  those they truly love  for Solitude is sometimes best Society and short Retirement urges sweet Return  But mine is I think a perpetual State of Banishment for the Months you are from me appear like Centuries and the few Days you are with me fly away like the Moments of a dying Man who knows he has but one short Hour to live or seem at best but like the wretched Exile's Interval of taking Leave for Life  However I will henceforward remember that Happiness is reserved for Immortality and learn to consider those Anxieties which the Tenderness of my Affection sometimes occasions as the Purchase of that Felicity which it has and I hope will still continue to produce I mean the redoubled Joys of meeting  What you say with Regard to the Resentment I express'd upon  Tom  's Behaviour is very just but I own my Nature is warm and impatient of Injuries especially when they are loaded with the vile Weight of Ingratitude but believe me  Harry  I have a Heart as tender and a Hand as open to soft Compassion and to melting Charity even as your generous Self but I confess with a Kind of Pride not to be described that in the stoical Habitude of subduing the first Impulse of Passion and attending to the Dictates of Reason and Humanity you have as in every thing else a considerable Advantage  over me You are indeed the steady  Rock  that keeps one even Course and I the unsettled Cloud below liable to the Gust of every varying Wind which veers it from it's purposed Bearing  There is really something singular in my Affection for you which makes me triumph at every Mark of your Superiority in Sense or Virtue even over myself and I feel a more exulting Pleasure at being excelled by you than I should in being superior to all the World beside Perhaps this may be owing to my having placed my chief Merit and Happiness in the Tenderness and Excess of my Love and there alone I will not yield the Prize even to you and as every new Proof of your Worth confirms and justifies the ruling Passion of my Soul I am doubly pleased and grateful for it  I will not yet despair of your Success with your  petrified Patronymic  for I depend on your Perseverance and constant Dropping wears at length the  Marble  Besides you find that the Proposal you made him two Months ago has at last made it's Way and penetrated into his most obdurate Brain So I take it for granted that your last Offer is travelling the same roundabout Road and may in the same Time arrive much fatigued with the tedious Barrenness of the Way at the same Inn and truly I think an Inn a proper Simile for his Brain where neither  Sense nor Science take up their Rest where every thing passes in dull Rotation and leaves no more Impression than  the Remembrance of a Guest who tarrieth but a Night  If I were Genie of the Black Isles mentioned in the  Arabian  Tales I would certainly take Measure of him with my Wand for a compleat Suit of Marble his Wig at least should  eternal buckle take in  Parian  Stone  I should have been glad to have known from the ossified Man  which  I hear is deposited in  Dublin  College whether his Mind partook of his Body's Disorder and if his Heart grew hard in Proportion as his Nerves grew rigid for if that be the Case I would have the Gentleman in Question anointed with Oils like an Olympic Wrestler for indeed I believe an Act of Generosity would be a gymnastic Exercise to him and I would have him put to sleep in a Tub of GooseGrease to increase his Sensibility  Forgive me  Harry  for making so free but I think it is better to laugh than cry at Things which we cannot remedy for I do not believe what poor  Lear  makes a Question of that there is any Cause or Cure in Nature for hard Hearts  Your Observation about  Charles  's Uneasiness at being separated from his Wife is I believe very just for I own I think him incapable of  that delicate Tenderness which renders Absence painful but it is very possible he may be uneasy for the Reasons you assign the Difficulty of Disuse when Men are governed more by Habit than Reason the miserable Vacuum which this has left in his Mind and Time and which he is at a Loss how to fill up  c  for there is not I believe a more helpless Mortal breathing or one less qualified for Solitude His poor vague Mind is neither imbued with Religion or Philosophy nor stored with Ideas enough to entertain himself or any one else for half an Hour and as he is generally much fatigued with Business and cannot read he must necessarily fall asleep whenever he is left to himself and such a Situation would make one regret the Loss of any Sort of Companion therefore I heartily pity the poor Man  I should be very unhappy if I doubted the Sincerity of your last Paragraph but indeed I do not for you have given me many kind Proofs to illustrate it and you may believe me in Return when I assure you that I would be content to give up half the Duration of my Life to be certain of spending the Remainder of it with you which is however no great Compliment for all the Time you are absent I consider myself in a State of Annihilation as I am deprived of the principal Spring or Movement which actuates this little Machine or rather like a Clock  with the striking Weight taken off which is silent though the Pendulum moves and only expresses itself by the  Hand  as I do now But though I am dumb to every one else I find as you may have  long  since observed in this  long  Letter a vast Inclination of prating away to you and should go on with this running Pattern without any Ground for an Hour or two more but that the Piece of Mechanism I have been alluding to has luckily for you just now informed me that the PostOffice will be shut in five Minutes  Adieu Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCXXI  I AM almost ashamed to acknowledge the Receipt of my dear  Harry  's last Letter I absolutely blush while I think of it I can bear any thing better than Praise which I do not deserve Yet Praise from you will always be pleasing to me for though I may be conscious I do not merit it yet I cannot distrust your Sincerity and sure I shall always be delighted with your thinking I am what I would wish to be  I by no Means doubt your receiving much Pleasure from such a Bundle of my Letters coming at once to your Hands My Idea of it is like passing a Day together Though the  Subject was often changed the Discourse was continued while a single Letter appears like a short Visit where the greatest Part of those Moments we should wish to employ more agreeably is taken up with the Form of coming in and going out Yet I confess I would rather see a Person I loved for half an Hour every Day than be debarred that Pleasure for a Month though I were certain they would then stay a Week with me for I think the  Joys of Meeting harldly pay the Pangs of Absence  This may be owing to an Impatience in my Temper which I would gladly correct as it occasions me many melancholy Hours for alas the greatest Part of my Life is passed in a State of Separation from you and even when you are with me the Certainty of parting at such a Time embitters the present Pleasure Pardon me when I tell you that I have often suspected your Love when I have seen you quit me with as much Indifference as you would a common Acquaintance while my poor foolish Heart has heaved and Eyes strained to follow you I know you have so strong an Understanding as would were you possessed of such a fond Weakness get the better of it and yet at this Moment I swear I speak from my own Heart I wonder how you can bear to be so long and often absent There is I fear but one Way of accounting for it  but as I will not now say anything that might appear illnatured I will leave you to guess at my Meaning I am however at this Time well pleased at your seeming indifferent to our parting for I am now almost determined to take a long Adieu of my dear dear  Harry  and indeed there is not any thing will contribute so much to make me easy as thinking he is so I will not dwell longer on this Subject but wait your Answer to my last Letter for my Determination shall on this and every other Occasion be only the Result of your Opinion or Desire  I parted from  Kitty  at this Morning She pressed me much to go with her I own I was strongly prompted by Inclination to accept her Invitation but durst not venture without your Consent  Nancy  has promised to make her a Visit by next  Thursday  's Stage If you do not think it improper and I do not hear from Lady I shall gladly accompany her but if you have any the least Objection or are apprehensive of any ill Consequence from my going I conjure you by your Love to speak freely and prevent me  Lady 's going to settle in  France  is not a sudden Start She always said she would go whenever she had completed her Affairs here That Time is come and I must either lose or follow her  I have been at 's ever since I came to Town He has lent me his  Pliny  A Company playing at Cards by my Side stun me with their Noise I know not what I am writing but this I know that I am with Love Faith and Constancy  Your's  LETTER CCXXII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    BELIEVE me sincere in my Praises of you for upon that Subject all Hyperbole is lost in Truth Whether indeed you really deserve all that I think which is tenfold more than ever I said of you I cannot tell Nay sometimes I fancy not only for this Reason that I am afraid there is not in Reality any Woman in the World so charming as I imagine you to be yet your Merit is the same to me which is capable of inspiring me with such pleasing Ideas as it amounts to the same let Sceptics wrangle ever so long whether there is such a Thing as Matter in the Universe or whether it is only a Spirit which has the Power of conveying such an Idea to our Senses And as the amiable Opinion I have of my dearest  Fanny  makes up most of my Happiness in this Life I shall consider  it as  Cicero  does an higher Subject  that if it should be a Mistake I would not part with the Belief of it for a Certainty of the highest Good in this World  Your Simile with Regard to your Letters has a pretty Fancy in it and there is a good deal of the same Kind of Turn in many of your Writings which has often made me declare that I never met with any thing in the epistolary Stile so very clever as they are so that even abstracted from the Consideration of their coming from you and being addressed to me I do not read any thing which gives me a more refined Entertainment  I take it very unkindly your seeming to suspect me of the least Indifference to you Whenever I can be near you how few Hours am I from you And be assured it is my Misfortune not my Fault that I am not constantly with you If I do not always part from you with the Appearance of that Fondness which you might expect it is owing intirely to that Temper which I have endeavoured to practise myself into as I have very little of it from Nature No Man has more Tenderness or soft Affection about his Heart than I have and my Philosophy which is not of the Stoic Kind does not make me feel less in myself but only serves to save Appearances to the rest of the World How often my dear  Fanny  have I  most earnestly intreated of you never to say any thing of that Kind to me again and if you recollect yourself you will find we have had very few Disputes but upon this Subject  Henry  LETTER CCXXIII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I RECEIVED your's by the Stage and that by the Post within the same Hour I am however obliged to you for your Design of expediting it though it did not answer  I have somewhere I think in the  Spectator  met a Comparison between the Effect which Praise has on a generous Mind and fine Weather on a Thermometer I like the Simile and think it might be carried a great Way I am not ashamed to own that I receive the highest Transport from your Praise It raises such a noble Emulation in my Mind as would were my Power equal to my Will render me worthy of it I think there is a Kind of Inspiration in your Praise which might lead me to any great or virtuous Act Add to this that it sets my Faults and Foibles in the strongest Light I consider you as the Person who has bestowed the Merits you approve of  and find myself ashamed of every Weakness I discover in myself which may lessen them In short it has the same Effect on the Qualities of my Mind which our Belief of the divine Omnipresence ought to have on all our Actions May my dear  Harry  continue still to see me with the same Eyes of Fondness 'till by never ceasing to desire I at last deserve his Praise and so as you somewhere say  strengthen Habit into Virtue  Notwithstanding your repeated Interdictions I must ask one Question Why should you endeavour to get the better of that natural Softness you say you are possessed of why lay yourself under a Restraint to appear indifferent to the Woman you love You cannot be ashamed of that Passion which is the Boast of human Nature If then you thought the Object worthy of your Tenderness why should you wish to suppress it nay why not boast  the graceful Weakness of your Heart  I must say you are a Laggard in the Race of Love I have outstripped and left you far behind  My  Anthony  is fat and scant of Breath  At the Hazard of every thing that is dear to me I have proclaimed my Fondness and do you blush at your's Indeed I claim no Merit from the too public Confession of my Love I could not help it for  I am made a shallow forded Stream seen to the Bottom all my Clearness  scorned and all my Faults exposed  My Nature is not capable of Disguise nor do I wish it wereI hope we shall never dispute on this or any other Subject I do indeed believe you love me and shall conclude with your own Quotation  that if it should be a Mistake I would not part with the Belief of it for a Certainty of the highest Good in this World  I am sorry I ever thought of leaving  England  It has cost me much Uneasiness I am still undetermined I fear my Resolution will not stand the Shock of quitting you Believe me I have nothing else to encounterMy Interest and Pleasure both point the Way yet still I loiter here If my Going were fixed I should suffer as much on your Account as my own Absence and a strong Probability of never meeting more might perhaps make us both regret our having ever met The Delicacy of my Love is shocked by supposing we shall ever repent our mutual Affection or Engagements yet under the Circumstances I have mentioned it is not impossible that it should happen While we retain the pleasing Expectation of seeing each other our Thoughts are all employed on the approaching Joy and every intervening Object appears scarce worthy our Regard But were we parted with a moral Certainty that Years must roll before we meet again would it not be natural to seek for a Consolation among those  who could best make Amends for the Loss we had sustained and who can say to their Heart "thus far shalt thou go and no farther" You have loved before and may again This Thought I own disturbs me But why should I torment myself with I hope groundless Fears for I will not part with theeLet me be satisfied that you desire my Stay then find the Pleasure or Advantage that shall force me from theeLet not this Confession put you under any Restraint for this be assured of though at your Desire I would chearfully forego every other Happiness in Life I will if you require it as readily embrace the Prospect of an everlasting SeparationMy Heart shall only feel not speak it's Anguish Here give me Leave to remind you of a Conversation we had on this Subject some little Time before you left  London  The Amount of it was that when I left the Kingdom we should no longer maintain any Correspondence but mutually endeavour to forget each other To this I stedfastly adhere For why should we strive to make each other more unhappy If I go I again repeat my Desire of not seeing you Indeed I could not bear itBut I do not think I shall goI will let it rest intirely upon you  I told you in my last Letter I had given up the Thoughts of going to the Country yet I long to see you and could I as easily go to  you as you can come to me I would not complain of Absence I have much to say to you but if I leave  England  my Thoughts and Faults be buried with meThough I have no Right to expect a Letter by Tomorrow's Post I hope for one  I have not  Pliny  by me now But though I am ignorant of the Text I admire the Comment which I beg you will continue I look on it at present as I should on a large Sum of Money which I had in reserve to purchase some particular Pleasure at a stated Time I therefore again desire you will go on increasing my little Hoard more valuable to me than all the Wealth of  Croesus    I intend going to the Rock Tomorrow for two or three Days I have found prodigious Benefit from bathing I am grown almost as fat as you are  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCXXIV  My Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED your Letter upon the Subject of your leaving  England  of which you desire my Opinion I refer my dearest Life to a former Letter wrote upon this Occasion  The Particulars of it I do not at present recollect but am certain of this that my Sentiments are still the same as both my Love and Friendship for you are so In short I shall neither consent to it because it is agreeable to your Inclinations nor dissent from it because it is irksome to mine but shall venture to let it rest upon a more infallible Principle by referring my Heart's best Love to Lady 's Determination about the Matter Her Sense can direct and her Goodness will support you May Heaven bless you And if I could at any Time recommend myself to Providence with that fervent Devotion which my Soul feels at present for you I should think at that Moment it were a Bliss to die  When you first mentioned Lady 's leaving the Kingdom I confess received a Shock which I could not account for I did not know her enough to feel any personal Concern at her Loss but your last Letter has given me some Superstition which could never affect me if my Spirits were not as low as they are at present  It was extremely unkind at this Time to mention your Letters after the Manner you did You speak of quitting the Kingdom and at the same Time grudge to leave me even your Picture more estimable than any that  Titian  ever drew When you desired me merely to  return them you were cruel only to me but when you requested me to destroy them you were unkind to the World which may perhaps one Day see them I despair of any the smallest Portion of Fame from my own Writings but to be loved and praised in your's may render my Name immortal So  Phaon  will be ever remembered But the same Fate cannot attend us both for he from his Inconstancy as  Pope  strongly expresses it is but  damned to everlasting Fame  I shall not dwell any longer on the Subject of your Letter because indeed I find myself too much affected with it and I cannot in my present Temper of Mind think of  Pliny  or any thing else So I shall make my Letter shorter than I am ever inclined to do to you  I shall conclude with a Saying of some of the Philosophers  that the Grief at losing a Thing and the Fear of losing it are equal  Farewell  my Heart's dear  Fanny  Henry    LETTER CCXXV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I WOULD have answered your's of the th last Post but my not being well joined to the present unsettled Situation of my Mind had so much lowered my Spirits that I feared my Letter would appear to you of the splenetic Cast  I now return my Thanks for the very elegant Compliments you make me To deserve them would be too high a Boast for the most perfect of my Sex yet I confess though conscious of my Want of Merit I feel a secret Pleasure mixed with Pride not Vanity when praised by you Though I am perhaps naturally vain I find myself humbled by the very Means which might be supposed to raise it I look on the Compliments you make me as I should on a Picture which though I had sat for the Painter from the Elegance of his Fancy not Judgment had made a finished Beauty I am however proud of that Affection which can to the very few Merits I possess add the Multitude I want and place me in such a Light as it should be my utmost Wish to appear in  I have much to tell you about our Lady I am at present a good deal surprized at not hearing from her She has wrote for her Children  to leave Town on  Wednesday  Is it not strange she did not mention me Though I cannot account for it I am resolved to give her Credit for acting right She must have strong Reasons for altering her Purpose I neither can nor will suspect any Change in her Friendship She gave it me voluntarily unmerited and unsought and should she withdraw it I have not any Right to complainbut I will not torment myself with anticipating what I should indeed think a severe Misfortune Tomorrow's Post may perhaps clear all  I wrote to desire your Opinion about my going with  Nancy  I have changed my Mind in that Particular and think of it no longer If I were certain of going to  France  I could not bear the Agony of a last Parting which I am sure that would be The Pain is already past why should I renew it We are separated let us remain soIf I stay in the Kingdom it would be an idle Frolic and might be attended with disagreeable ConsequencesI will not go there on any Terms  Your last Letter has almost distracted me How can you write with such tender Concern yet leave me in Suspence When I apply to you my Guide my Director for Advice why refer me to another Is there a Creature breathing on whose Love or Friendship I ought to depend more than your's I hoped there was  not If I have been deceived it is equal what becomes of meI will not indulge a Thought so injurious to your Honour and my Peace How can you say it is agreeable to my Inclinations to quit  you  for I neither think or speak of any other TyeIn Return for your unkind Suspicion I might tell you that Thought was suggested by your Wishes rather than Opinion You know my Heart hangs on you you are it's Support and the sole Source of all it's Happiness or Misery and is it possible you can suspect my Love Does not your own Heart bear Witness for me and contradict so cruel an Aspersion Unkind illnatured  Harry  Perhaps I wrong you My Concern transports me beyond the Bounds of Reason You could not mean to injure me so highly  The Concern you express at my leaving the Kingdom shall for the present prevent my taking any Steps towards it 'till I have your Opinion in more explicit Terms for by that only I will be determined What can prevent your giving it freely You certainly know what you would have me do and you are bound by every Tye to direct and guide my little Bark through all the Storms of Life  Though I should be glad my Letters were destroyed I will not if I go desire to deprive you of them Their Value is owing to your Opinion The insisting on them would be somewhat  like stealing your Reputation impoverishing you without enriching myself It would give me the greatest Uneasiness if I thought they would be ever seen by a third Person They were wrote from my Heart to your's without a View of extorting Praise and were never designed for the unfeeling Vulgar I have not any Apprehension of their being made public You will not for your own Sake expose my Weakness to the World and I dare swear there is not another Person in it who would think them worth the Trouble of reading I confess I have often wished for so much Genius or poetic Fire call it which you please as might transmit to Posterity an Idea of my Affection for you and  graft my Love immortal on thy Fame  But that Wish like most of mine is vain  Apollo  denied my Suit though seconded by the antient not modern  Cupid  but made me large Amends by promising that my Name should be immortalized by you  I have this Instant recollected that on this Day Twelvemonth I first saw  Belvidere  Will you forgive me if I say I wish I had never seen it What an infinite deal of Anxiety have we suffered for each other since that Aera and who can tell where it will end Believe me my Heart's dear  Harry  this Reflection affords me as much Uneasiness on your Account as on  my own I fear we were born to make each other unhappyThis I own is a Reflection unbecoming the Woman you love but still I am a Woman and though I think your loving me would make Amends for every Distress that could befal  me  I cannot bear to consider myself as the Cause of any Misfortune to  you  Had we not met at that unlucky Crisis I should at this Time have been happily indifferent to all your Sex and you perhaps might have been fortunately engaged in the laudable Pursuit of some more worthy and amiable WomanBut as I am so far a Predestinarian as to believe  whatever is is right  I think there seems a Kind of Fate in our Reconciliation We have mutually given up the Prime of our Lives to each other and after an Acquaintance of almost six Years we find our Love Friendship and Esteem increasing every DayDoes not this look as if we should spend the calm Evening as well as the Noontide of our Lives together I will indulge this Hope cast every black and gloomy Thought behind and rely on the Opinion I have of your Love and the Consciousness of my own for all my future Happiness Do with me what you will bid me go or stay I will chearfully conform to whatever is most agreeable to you  My Thoughts shall fix my latest Wish depend  On thee Guide Guardian Kinsman Father Friend  By all these tender Names be  Henry  known  To  Fanny  's Heart and grateful let him own  That she of all Mankind has lov'd but him alone  I beg you to excuse this wild Rhapsody My Thoughts are not reduced to any Kind of Form They are filled with Love Grief and you If I had wrote last Post I would not send this I am quite ashamed of it Indeed it is sad incoherent Stuff Can you blame me for not being Mistress of myself when I think of parting from you I have done nothing but weep since I received your last Letter If you consent to my going do not write so tenderly for it will only make our Parting more painful  I have yet a thousand Things to say to you but cannot speak them I have already said too much yet like a peevish Child I go on sobbing to myself after my Reason tells me I should have done  Adieu my everdear my bestloved Friend May Happiness equal to my Wishes attend you through every Scene of Life and may we  meet at last in that Fulness of Bliss which shall far exceed our fondest Hopes  Frances  LETTER CCXXVI  Dear  FANNY  WHEN I said your going to  France  was contrary to my Inclinations I did not mean selfishly it was my Fears and Apprehensions of many Kinds which made my Sentiments doubtful about the Matter And when I said it was agreeable to your's I did not mean to upbraid you for the Want of any the least Part of that Affection and kind Regard you have so generously bestowed upon me but merely alluded to the great Hopes and sanguine Expectations which you had formerly from this Scheme and which I thought depended on too many Hazards to be hastily ventured upon For both these Reasons therefore I referred a Determination in this Matter to Lady because her Patronage and Protection would obviate a good deal of my Fears and justify a great deal of your Hopes and in that Case I should submit though in any Case I could never consent Be well assured my Heart's fondest Wish that no Distance in this World  nor Chance in this Life can ever alter my Love my Friendship my tenderest Regard toward you for as I think it is impossible they can ever improve I am certain from late Experience and frequent Reflection both upon you and myself that my warmest Affection highest Esteem and sincerest Attachment both to your Person and Merits will last during our Lives and can only be increased or improved hereafter  Your mentioning the first Day you came to  Belvidere  has made me recollect that I am but about a Year old for I cast every Day out of my Aera before the Time I may be truly said to begin to live though as I reckon my whole Existence only with regard to you I shall thus divide it The th of  May  I was born the th of  November  following I was christened and the th of  August  I became of Age and I should deem that the Day of my Death upon which we should ever be parted Your visiting this Recess has made me in Love with Life and every Enjoyment of it it has made my own more my own so that I may say you have bestowed it on me  For what Purpose Love  But to be frank and give it thee again  Accept then the Dedication of this Temple and these Plains these Groves and Springs The Hamadryads are your's the Fawnsnot  Satyrs your's the Naiads your's Accept them all and with them my Heart in Dower which is your's your's  LETTER CCXXVII  SINCE you desire me to continue my Notes upon  Pliny  I shall go on with that Subject again  The first Epistle of the third Book puts me in mind of Lord  Orrery  's Wish about the latter Scenes of his Life hinted at in one of my former Letters to you and in the Passage I here allude to for Want of better Light from History he supposes after what Manner  Pliny  passed the Decline of Life but I think the latter Part of the Letter I am now upon affords a strong Presumption of this Supposition and as  Pliny  desires  Calvisius  to keep that Letter by him in order to judge of his Philosophy so shall we remember Lord  Orrery  's Declaration with the same View I think the Character of  Spurinna  not unlike his own and there is one Circumstance hinted at when he takes the Air in his Chariot in which they happily agree In this Letter there is a pretty Distinction between being pleased and being proud of a Thing  The only Mark of Age he discovers is Prudence  This is a fine Trait  In the sixth Epistle of the same Book in the Comment on it Lord  Orrery  gives us a gay Ode to divert our Thoughts from the melancholy Prospect of an old Man which is like the merry Epilogues they give us often after our Tragedies This Argument has been treated pro and con in the  Spectators  But for my Part I always chuse to retire with the Bier for sober Thoughts do me no Harm as I can be grave without being melancholy I am surprized his Lordship should say an old Man was a dismal Sight for a Person who views all Things  In the calm Light of mild Philosophy  regards with equal Eyes both Youth and Age nay I cannot think it requires any great Straining of Philosophy to bear even our own Decay as there are Pleasures and Solations indulged by Providence to every Stage of Life and to a Mind rightly turned perhaps not the least to the last and if any Uneasiness arises in our Senescence from a nearer Prospect of the Grave it is unbecoming a Christian who rests in Hope  There is something extremely elegant and a fine Address of Compliment in several of  Pliny  's Epistles with a certain  Tour d'Expression et de Sentiment  which is observable in the Writings of the best and politest  French  Authors I shall give you but one Example among many because I would not prevent you as you have  not gone through his Works It is in the eighth Epistle of this Book  And since it is equally excellent to merit and confer Benefits I see you are resolved to lay Claim to the Praise of both by giving to another what you have deserved yourself  In the Observations upon the second Epistle of the fourth Book my Lord after his humane Way reprimands  Pliny  for his frequent Abuse of  Regulus  which as I hinted is an Instance of his Humanity but not of his Judgment There are many Men of vile Deserts so far beyond the Reach of Laws that there is no Way to punish them but by Satire or Invective and I believe that several People naturally vicious in themselves have been restrained within the Bounds of social Morality not from Respect to the Tables but out of Fear of being  damn'd to everlasting Fame  From the whole Tenor of  Pliny  's Character and it is this Way we should judge of Men he inveighs against  Regulus  from a virtuous Rage rather than from Hatred Malice or any Uncharitableness This puts me in Mind of a Sentiment of your's upon some such Occasion as this which may not be improperly repeated here It is upon the Subject of Revenge  As a Passion it is a Vice but as a Principle a Virtue  Pursued with Malice and Illnature  upon slight or common Provocations it is a Passion instigated by the Devil but great and real Injuries proceeding from extreme Vice and Immorality call aloud for Justice and then Vengeance becomes a godlike Principle Perhaps it would be a proper Criticism here to distinguish between the Words  revenge  and  avenge    In the latter Part of the Comment upon the fourth Epistle there is a very just Observation That it is absolutely necessary for us to be as wary in the Choice of our Amusements as of our Studies For which Reason I have often thought that there wanted extremely such an Office to be established in all States as a general Reveller who should prescribe and preside over the Amusements Pleasures and Diversions of all Ranks all Professions and all Ages of Men even from their childish Years which would be an Institution of admirable Service to the World  Read the whole nineteenth Epistle and the Comment upon it I fancy there are some Passages in both which will strike and please my dear  Fanny  and in order to leave the Impression on your Mind I shall put an End to this Letter with the Addition only of an Allusion to one of  Prior  's Poems  So thinking on thy charming Youth  c  Henry  LETTER CCXXVIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I SUPPOSE by my not hearing from you last Post that you do not get my Letters regularly which I hope is owing to your being retired to the Rock though you have at present extreme bad Weather for Bathing I have a melancholy Prospect before me for my Wheat Harvest and I have the greatest Quantity and the best in this Country most of which is lodged by the Rain and shedding by the Wind Mais vive la Philosophie  I hope to have a Letter from you Today but cannot get it before this goes to the Post So I shall go on with my  Pliny  which I never read but when I am to write to you and as I undertook this Work merely for your Amusement so I find it now for that Reason if I had no other the pleasantest Manner of reading It is certainly the most improving Method too and if I had a great Fortune I would allow a good Salary to a Librarian who should  antecede  my Study and mark out to me only those Passages which were remarkable or ingenious improving or entertaining as I would give my new Shoes to a Servant to wear first The Person I would employ for this Purpose should  rather be one of a refined Taste than of deep Learning and of more natural Understanding than great acquired Knowledge In short my dearest  Fanny  you should be my  Minerva  my Preceptor for even from your Fragments I might hope to grow rich in Wisdom and to be  polished into Virtue  This last Expression has made a Sentiment occur to me that there is a certain refined Taste Parsons may call it Grace if they will which unless born with a Man the bestdisposed Christian will be but an heavy unformed Lump of Morality What is that Reverence for the Antients that humane Love for our Cotemporaries that generous Benevolence for Posterity that tender Sense for another's Sorrow that high Relish for a Stranger's Happiness and lastly that noble philosophic heartthrilling and religious Ardor which possesses the whole Soul with enthusiastic Rapture upon the Contemplation of the astonishing Greatness of the Works of Providence and the infinite Goodness of their incomprehensible Author What are all these refined Pleasures owing to I say but to a natural Taste and quick Relish for Virtue to a certain gifted Capacity large enough to comprehend the whole intellectual Universe that is all Mankind past present and to come and reaches so high as to embrace even God himself all which a plain good Man has no more Idea of  than we can of the Pleasures of a sixth Sense  Addison  has somewhat the same Turn of Thought with Regard to Piety when he says  that some People want Parts to be devout and could as soon make an Epic Poem as a fervent Prayer  But to return to  Pliny  who is properly enough introduced after such a Subject as carried me beyond myself just now  The twentyfirst Epistle of the fourth Book is an extreme pretty one I wept for the  Helvidiae  not so much for their Death as for  Pliny  's Grief at it  In the next Epistle there is a poetical Witticism in the Allusion of the Arrow which is I think the first Instance of that Kind I have met with in this Author  I am charmed with the whole twentythird Epistle That truly noble and philosophic Exclamation wishing for that Stage of Life when he might live to himself transports me There is nothing for which I despise a Person so much as the paltry Wish to be younger a childish Longing for a Bib and Bells again He must have spent his Life very ill or mean to do so who would desire to return back to any Aera of it for we are at any Stage capable of Virtue  In the twentyeighth Epistle  Pliny  has mistaken the Matter with regard to Painting for  I think it is a much easier Matter to copy a Picture than to draw from the Life  In the last Epistle of this fourth Book he mentions a Spring which ebbed and flowed There is a Well some Miles from this which is reported to do the same I never examined into it but shall ride over there some Day on Purpose  I am surprized that any Person of common Sense could mistake the Legacy which he was so pleased with Epistle I Book V for that from  Curianus  was the only one which did him Honour He says  A small Legacy is fallen to me  which shews he was telling his Friend something new And the former Legacy was above two Years before at least for he says that the Suit with the Coheirs was of so long standing The Mistake of the Commentator's could never have happened but from the mere Force of Prejudice which has amazing Powers in many higher Instances  Pliny  first speaks of  Pomponia  's Favour to which it was natural to apply his Expressions of the Gratefulness of the Present and leaving the Reader in this Error almost during the whole Letter what he says at last tho' it breaks with full Day upon you could not open the Eyes of Prejudice  In the fourth Epistle you may see the extravagant Fees which were given to Lawyers in  Pliny  's Time This may make us a little better  reconciled to the Extortion in our own Days Though to view this Matter in the Light of political Morality the present Exorbitancy ought to alarm us extremely for the higher Law or Justice is vended the scarcer it must be and the Poor who need it most will consequently have least of it Then Oppression reigns and Liberty is no more and then is a State in the proper Crisis for a Revolution either by Rebellion at home or Invasion from abroad At the Time  Pliny  hints at this Extravagance the great  Roman  Empire was hastening to it's Ruin  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCXXIX  My dearest  FANNY  Musaeum  OUR Assizes are over and I am returned to myself that is to you I wait not for the  Pleasure  of hearing from you but amuse myself in the mean Time with the more imperfect  one  of writing to you I am now retired among my Books the best Part of which Library I esteem your Letters for they not only teach me Wisdom but promise me that glorious End of which Wisdom is the surest Means Happiness  I have read some Pages this Morning in the second Volume of  Orrery  's  Pliny  but should not at this Time think of entertaining you out of this Author if I had not from thence a fair Opportunity of addressing myself more particularly to my Heart's only Aim  You may remember that you rallied me upon not taking Notice of  Pliny  's Epistles to  Calpurnia  in my former Remarks but I defended myself upon there not being any in the first Volume The fourth of the sixth Book which is the first of the second Volume is the first of these Epistles I confess myself charmed with it and am the more particularly fond of her as from the Hint of her Constitution and Make she seems to resemble you as you in Return do her in this that I think you would deserve on the like Occasion a Letter full of the same Fondness and Tenderness and conjugal Regard Whenever I raise a Statue to  Pliny  I will have that whole Epistle inscribed on the Pedestal  The two first Lines of the fortieth Page contain a very fine and a just Sentiment From the second Paragraph of the Comment upon this sixteenth Epistle you may draw a Comparison between  Pliny  and  Shakespeare  by observing that the little Jingle and affected Turns in both their Writings were rather the false Taste of their Age than the Vices of the Authors  The Reflection in the seventeenth Epistle that  he who envies another must be his Inferior  is fine  At the End of the Notes upon the fourth Epistle of the seventh Book Lord  Orrery  wishes that this Letter had perished I suppose because it betrays a little Vanity about his trifling Performances in Poetry He is very often angry at him when he shews a Weakness of any Kind because it is natural for us to wish those we love or esteem for some Qualities perfect in all Now I am not quite so severe in this Matter "Non ego paucis offendor Maculis" Human Nature has many Foibles and when I perceive some in a great Character I suppose I see the whole Man but when a perfect System is presented to me I suspect the Genuineness of the whole for as I conclude a Part is acted somewhere I think it possible it may be done throughout Which gives me Occasion to remark upon the only Foible I ever could object to my own  Calpurnia  that I have now begun to consider it like a Tree or Shrub which happens sometimes to be met with in forming the regular Alley of a Parterre which though it would be out of Rule to plant it there would betray a Want of Taste to root it out  The first Paragraph of the fifteenth Epistle gives me an Opportunity of renewing my Remark upon one of the Epistles of the first Volume  I forget which of them and as I have returned you that Book I cannot set myself right now but it is where he comes very near preferring a Life of retired Leisure to public Business but dares not speak quite out for the Reasons there mentioned In the Passage of this Letter which I am now quoting he says  I  dare  not say my Life would be better but certainly it would be happier if my Studies were my sole Employments  I think Lord  Orrery  has mistaken that Passage in the eighteenth Epistle where  Pliny  says  The Land itself will never want a Proprietor  for  Pliny  seems to consider this Farm with a View of setting it not of selling and therefore rather wants a Tenant than a Purchaser The original Expression  By whom the Land is occupied  which distinguishes a Tenant from the Owner of the Soil  "à quo  exerceatur  " seems to warrant this Sense  On the nineteenth Epistle  Faulkner  makes a remarkable Blunder in the Comment about the Genealogy of  Fannia  but indeed the whole Edition of this Book is very faulty  In the Observations upon the twentyfifth Epistle my Lord quotes as a Proverb this Sentence  He that is not for me is against me  by which he seems not to recollect that it is a Passage in Scripture and spoken by  our Saviour  Luke  ii  I am sure if he had been aware of this he would not have introduced it so lightly here  Adieu  LETTER CCXXX  I AM infinitely obliged to my dearest Life for the Kindness and Constancy of his Letters They have indeed almost made me Amends for the Pangs of Absence I know nothing else that could have soothed or even amused my Mind but those dear Pledges of your Love I confess I never felt such severe Anguish in my Life as at our last Parting and though you appeared so then I do not now believe you was indifferent A thousand Circumstances concurred to render it more painful to me than any of our former Separations You have kindly obviated the most material and I shall now endeavour to forget the past and only look forward with the pleasing Hope of our Meeting  The Gentleness with which you treat my greatest Fault will I flatter myself have a better Effect than the severest Reproof Allow me my dearest  Harry  to say without a Boast my Nature is honest generous and open I was brought up with perhaps too much Tenderness and Lenity Unused to Harshness I cannot  easily bring myself to bear it from one I passionately loveBut be assured I will endeavour to root this Weed not Shrub intirely out of your little Parterre  I wish I was as well able to vye with the Merits of  Calpurnia  's Character as your Epistles for Nobleness of Sentiment Justness of Thought Elegance and Tenderness of Expression may with  Pliny  's but alas I fear I fall as far short of her as you in my Opinion surpass him In one Respect however I am sure I shall equal if not exceed her in my unbounded Love and faithful Friendship for thee thou dearest most amiable and deserving of thy Sex  I hope when I write next I shall be more at Peace for I am not settled yet In the mean Time I beg you will excuse the Wildness and Incoherence of this Scrawl and believe me with the tenderest Affection and sincerest Esteem your fond and faithful  Fanny  LETTER CCXXXI  Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED no Letter from you by  Tuesday  Night's Post so suppose there was not any Certainty or Alteration in your Affairs at that Time worth recording I have sent to Town  expecting a Letter by  Thursday  's Post and am very sure I shall not be disappointed I hope the Letter itself may not disappoint me  Since I received Lady 's last Letter I have had frequent Struggles with myself about answering it If I do not answer it I suffer the Correspondence to drop on my Side which is unpolite If I do answer I may seem to presume too much upon an occasional Adventure and thereby be deemed unworthy of the Honour proceeding from it Upon the whole I have determined in the Negative and sacrificed my Inclinations to my Prudence upon this Reasoning that few Men can deserve such high Honour by their Merits but almost any Man may appear not unworthy of it by his Modesty One particular Thing which tempted me to write was the occurring of some farther Thoughts upon that comfortable Subject of the Mercy of God which was Part of my Letter to her and which I did not carry as far as I might with a little Reflection at that Time lest it should look like a premeditated Essay what was in Reality but an occasional Occurrence though after what Manner hinted to me from any Part of my Letter I cannot at present recollect  The only Objection which Divines make to the unbounded Mercy of God is his infinite Justice for say they Justice is concerned about punishing the Wicked as well as rewarding  the Virtuous and the only Scope they will allow to Mercy is Remission upon Repentance  Now let us consider the Matter impartially among ourselves for observe there is nobody by but you and I  In the first Place it is high Presumption to pretend to reason about the Attributes of God and all Definitions of this Kind may be considered  like the Eye in Prospect whose Strength can find no End but Weakness makes one  The Qualities and Faculties of the human Mind from whence they vainly argue may have and it is more than probable so little Relation to the divine Mind that there may not be even any Analogy between them and may perhaps to a Spirit capable of conceiving both be as different Ideas as Sound and Colour  But let us dispute with them upon their own Terms and speak of God as Man and let us agree for the Sake of Argument that though the Qualities of a human Creature certainly bear no Proportion to the Attributes they may however have such a Relation to them as Time has to Eternity and thus we may come to a clear Method of reasoning upon this Subject  Human Justice then as blended with human Passions and human Policies may be defined a Retribution of Rewards and Punishments but  to consider it in the Abstract I do not think that even human Justice comprehends the latter Part of this Definition for Punishments are inflicted either to revenge or to deter Now with Regard to the first a Legislature is dispassionate and with Regard to the latter I am sure that if a Man could commit any Crime which it was impossible for him or any body else ever to commit again it would be a Cruelty to allot any Penalty for it because in this Case the Benefit of the Example would never operate In this State then I look upon our Souls in the next World as having committed Offences which we can no longer repeat and the Punishment of which can then no more avail us or serve as a wholesome Example to deter others nor is God a Man that he should be angry  I shall not add any thing farther upon this Head but just to observe to you that the Definition of Mercy as it is given in the Beginning of this Discourse absolutely annihilates the Virtue by making it only Part of another for Forgiveness upon Repentance is not a distinct Operation according to that Sense but merely a Piece of Justice If I forgive my Debtor he is obliged to my Generosity But if he pays the Debt he releases himself and I but perform common Equity by giving up his Obligation upon Conditions performed  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCXXXII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    THE unsettled and of Course uncomfortable Situation I have been in these three Months makes me feel a very sincere Satisfaction at being able to date this Letter from my own Apartment or rather your's for I cannot will not call it mine 'till you have blest it with your Presence Haste then my dearest Life my kindest Love my All my Being haste and restore your  Fanny  to the Enjoyment of herself in you bring to her Wishes to her Transports bring all that can make Mortality endured and render Immortality still more desirable  The Impatience of my fond Desire to see you has hurried my Imagination into a Kind of Rhapsody but I own I should think it a Crime to love you after the common sober insipid Manner and if Excess of Love be pardonable in any Woman I may stand excused My Constitution is naturally cold nor could it be warmed into Love by an Object less worthy than my Heart's dear  Harry  This Declaration which is indeed a true one may well secure you from any Fear of Change in my Heart I wish both for your Sake and my  own that I had Merits sufficient to furnish me with the same Security But as your Love and Constancy outweigh even your other Merits to me I will rest satisfied from my Dependence on them though conscious of my Want of Worth to deserve them in any other Way but by returning them an hundredfold  I cannot help saying I am sorry the Correspondence between Lady and you is at an End though I am certain you judged it right  Though we can have no perfect Knowledge of the Attributes of God I cannot think it Presumption to form an Idea according to our finite Capacity that he is just and merciful If we believe the Bible to be a Work of Inspiration we must assent to this Opinion If we consider it as the Work of mere Man unassisted uninspired it appears that the Result of natural Reason as far as  finite  can comprehend  infinite  has given us an Idea both of the Almighty and his Attributes and sure it cannot be criminal to employ that Reason which he hath bestowed upon us in Contemplation of his Excellence The Fault which I think the Generality of Men and particularly Divines run into is not the Reasoning on the divine Attributes but daring to set Bounds to what their poor finite Capacities cannot comprehend I cannot by any Means agree with you  that it is probable there should be no Analogy between the divine and human Mind We believe God to be allwise allgood We must change the Idea of these Attributes into Folly and Cruelty if we supposed he did not form the Faculties of our Souls by the most perfect Modelby himself though he confined their Operation within a narrow Sphere But when we shall put off this frail Mortality that now clogs and incloses the Faculties of our Souls I do believe they will be enlarged and of what Use could they be had they no Analogy to the divine Being in the Contemplation of whose endless Glory and Perfection our chief Happiness will I presume consist  I am quite charmed with your Argument for unbounded Mercy I think it is carried as far as finite Wisdom can go and to make use of your own Expression  In some other Place  has shewn that  God is not made up of Parts but is  one  perfect Being  whose Attributes cooperate and correspond together  In Compliance with your oftenrepeated Desire you see I have ventured to touch upon a Subject infinitely beyond my Capacity but it is in such a Manner as Boys first learn to swim conscious I am out of my Depth and afraid of drowning every Instant But my dear Teacher  will I am sure reach out his Hand to save his little trembling Pupil  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCXXXIII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    AS I am still in the same disagreeable Way with Regard to my Health I would not write to my sweet Love this Night but to prevent his Apprehension of my being worse There is something extremely odd in my Disorder as there is not the least Alteration in it Time has however lessened my Feelings but not abated my Complaints I own I am greatly alarmed at my Illness but I will not say more on a Subject which I am sure occasions you almost as much Pain as me  I will not by any Means accept either of the Epitaphs you offer me unless I should survive you What a Thought was that Forgive me Heaven when I say thy Joys as far as my poor finite Views can reach could hardly counterpoise my  Henry  's Loss I will not cannot bear to part with thee My Spirits are much too low to be able to get the better of this melancholy Reflection and believe me  Harry  fully certain as I am of the Mercies of  my Creator I find no Pang in the Thoughts of dying nor do I think I should find a Sting in Death itself but that of being torn from thee my Life my Soul my Immortality and could I call it "an Escape a blest Exchange" ah noI must want much of that passionate Regard I feel for thee e'er I can think it Bliss to part from you I'll not endure the Thought  I hope indeed you will take Care to see me laid in some Place where Death shall not divide our poor Remains  where thou with frequent Eyes my Sepulchre may'st see  Oh grant thou good thou great allmerciful and allglorious God that the last Object which I view on Earth may be my  Henry  that he may close my Eyes  and smooth my Passage to the Realms of Day  I gladly accept of every Mark of Age which it shall ever be in your Power to devote to me provided they give no Hints of your Mortality I own I rejoice at every Pain or Sickness that I feel which seems to promise I shall not be left behind for I can much better bear the Thoughts of quitting you than of your leaving me  Adieu my Life my Love Believe me your's 'till Death and ever after  Frances  LETTER CCXXXIV  HENRY  to  FRANCES    My Dearest Life  I AM much alarmed about your Disorder and extremely concerned at it For Heaven's Sake take Care of yourself Go early to Bed though you lie awake three Hours after it and get up early though you should be obliged to dose in the Middle of the Day for it Consider my Heart's Passion my Mind's Reflection my Life's Happiness and my Soul's Hope that all these precious Concerns depend upon you and are employed about you If I had a more favourite Scheme in View than your Felicity or imagined to myself any Transport but through that Means you might then perhaps be at Liberty to trifle away your Time and Health upon Persons who have neither Sense or Taste enough to conceive your Merits nor Tenderness or Love to be affected by them Remember now my warmest Wish that I trust you with yourself and surely the high Confidence of so dear a Pledge deserves at least that it shall not be impaired in your Keeping  Since you do not approve of my Epitaphs I beg you will frame others more to your Fancy or rather let the Actions of our Lives form the  Mottos for our Graves It was finely said of  Socrates  when called upon by his Judges to make his Defence  I have been doing nothing else all my Life  Montaigne  observes very justly upon the Subject of Death  that the Philosophy of the Schools but increases by Prepensity the Terrors of it and only prepares us for the Preparation  What signifies all the Sophistry deduced from the Consideration of the Mortality of our State that we had Life itself but upon these Conditions  that Death a necessary End will come when it will come  with other Quibbles of the same KindThe only Way to make ready for Death is to prepare our Lives for it Actions not Words can comfort us at such a Crisis  After so solemn a Subject as this it may appear light to mention such a Trifle as I am going to speak of but that in Truth though I expect to be laughed at I have some Scruples of Conscience about it There is a Butterfly in my Study which would be dead some Time past but that I watched it at the End of the Season and have frequently revived it by the Warmth of my Breath every Day since and you cannot conceive the Pleasure I receive when I feel it flutter in my Hand upon such Occasions By this Means I have prolonged it's Life beyond the Date of Butterflies Now perhaps I am counteracting the Order of Providence and may  deserve the Punishment of  Promotheus  for stealing Fire from Heaven to animate his Man of Clay Perhaps too I am but making this poor Insect linger out a Life in Pain for I believe no Creature but Man ever received Pleasure from any thing which was contrary to Nature In short I begin to fancy I am guilty of such a Cruelty as the keeping a Man awake all Night by Way of adding so many Hours to his Day Should any Physician discover an Elixir which might equal our Lives to the Age of the Patriarchs would he not deserve to have his own cut short for tempting Men to cheat themselves of some Portion of a glorious Immortality merely to lengthen out some Years of Misery here below The Gymnosophists have a fine Sentiment that we are in this Life but in a State of  Conception  and that Death is our  Delivery  A Man then who has lived beyond the Bounds prescribed by Nature may perhaps be considered in the next Life as a monstrous  Birth  For my Part I desire not to die before the ordinary Fate of human Nature but at the same Time wish with  Horace    Nec turpem senectutem degere  Not to consume a loathsome Age  Adieu my Life Remember your Health and remember me  Henry  LETTER CCXXXV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I DO not indeed think it would be possible for me to support myself under the very disagreeable Situation I am in both of Body and Mind were it not for the Pleasure I receive from my dear dear Life's kind Letters I own I am jealous of Solitude and cannot help being uneasy when I think your Fondness for that must by Degrees lessen your Love for me And should I ever be so happy as to live with you my Company or Converse may appear an Interruption to your Scheme of Life It will of Course grow distasteful and I unhappy I only speak my Fears not my Opinion for that shall always be guided by you nor will I doubt your Love your Truth and Constancy  I am vastly alarmed at hearing from your Brother you do not intend coming to Town I will not believe you could form so unkind a Resolution Pray answer me directly will you come or no and when if you do come may I expect to see you You cannot conceive what a Shock this Report gave me My whole Life is indeed spent in waiting for you I count every Hour an Age 'till we meet and would gladly  imp the Wings of Time which thy  Absence clips  I rejoice every Night that a Day is passed and that I am so much nearer the happy Aera I had fondly fixed for our Meeting In short I should have no Idea of Time or it's Limits but from the Expectation of seeing you Yet notwithstanding my earnest Desire let me intreat you not to think of coming unless it be quite convenient to you  Though I object from selfish Views to my dear  Harry  's Love of Solitude I perfectly agree with him in thinking the Generality of People and Conversations we meet with to be mostly disagreeable at best trifling and insipid and quite incapable of affording that Delight which should arise from the Converse of rational and immortal Beings yet do I think Life would become irksome and every Virtue stagnate in our Souls were they not called into Action by a Desire of being approved by some particular Person  Nature in Zeal for human Amity  Denies or damps an undivided Joy  'Tis Converse qualifies for Solitude  As Exercise for salutary Rest  By that untutor'd Contemplation raves  A lunar Prince or famish'd Beggar dies  And Nature's Fool by Wisdom's is outdone  Needful Auxiliary is a Friend to give  To social Man true Relish of himself  Full on ourselves descending in a Line  Pleasure's bright Beam is feeble in Delight  Delight intense is taken by Rebound  Reverberated Pleasure fires the Breast  Celestial Happiness whene'er she stoops  To visit Earth one Shrine the Goddess finds  And one alone to make her sweet Amends  For absent Heav'nthe Bosom of a Friend  Where Heart meets Heart reciprocally soft  Each other's Pillow to Repose divine  Oh were I capable of being that pleasing kind and rational Companion to my  Henry  my Bliss would be compleat I would with Transport quit the World this Moment if I might be Partaker of thy Solitude in the most distant Desart nor cast a Wish a Sigh or Thought away on aught on Earthfor thou to me art all And yet perhaps we never shall spend a single Day together in that delightful undisturbed peaceful Retirement which we both pant afterMy Spirits were low before This Thought has sunk them quite  Adieu my dearest Love I am still sick still your's  Frances  LETTER CCXXXVI  My dear giddy Girl  I SEND you inclosed the Cover of your last Letter which you see was sent without a Seal Through what Perusals it has passed I cannot say but am glad it has escaped the  Cotton  Library of Manuscripts to arrive safe to my Hands at last  You have no Reason to apprehend that my Fondness for Retirement can ever seclude you from my Society That Taste or Turn of Mind which gives me a Disrelish to Conversation in general does but create in me a stronger Impatience for the Enjoyment of your's in particular I own that my Passion for Solitude has grown very strong in me of late but must confess that I should chuse to carry it no farther than to that blessed State which  Adam  rejoiced in between the last Creation and his Fall  Adam  relating she sole Auditress  I agree with you that the Approbation we expect from virtuous Actions is a very high Incitement to them and the Love of Fame so strongly implanted in all Mankind has always appeared to me a very good Proof of the Soul's Existence after Death even of it's eternal Existence For as this is a Passion  which nothing less than Immortality can gratify it would be impiously charging Providence with inspiring us with a Desire which we were never designed to possess the Enjoyment of were we to exclude the Hope of an Hereafter  As the Immortality of the Soul and the Existence of a God have been often made use of as reciprocal Proofs I shall add a few Words upon this last Subject to the many excellent Arguments more at large insisted upon by the Divines If Infidels or Sceptics deny or doubt the Certainty of an intelligent Providence yet surely the Belief of it ought to be received as we give Credit to the  Copernican  System if not for it's Demonstration at least because this Hypothesis accounts for all the Phaenomena of the celestial Bodies which would otherwise appear a Heap of wild Incoherence And rashly to deny a Thing because we cannot comprehend it is such a Pyrrhonism as to affirm we cannot see because we are not sufficiently informed how we see For to say we see by our Eyes is unphilosophical for our Eyes are but the Organs of Sight that is the Instrument not the Cause In looking up through the Chain of Effects our Reason hesitates at a certain Period which we presume to be the first Cause though beyond our Comprehension the Links may be infinite before they reach the first Cause and then to say we cannot comprehend  that first Cause is but a Sort of Definition of it for if we could comprehend it it could not be what we must suppose it  Ever since you attacked me so well upon my Hint that perhaps there was as little Analogy as Comparison between the Virtues of Man and the Attributes of God I have been revolving that Subject in my Mind for we should have Reasons even for our Doubts in so high a Matter and the more I consider it the more am I confirmed in an Opinion which was but a Surmise at first If we stick to the Religion of Nature we can indeed only say perhaps there may be no Relation between them but when we come down to Revelation we shall find many express Authorities to support my Argument two of which I think sufficient to produce What Notions of Justice can the human Mind supply us with for the Curse derived to all Mankind from original Sin Then again Part of the second Cammandment says  I will visit the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children to the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me  c  What human Equity is there in this Is not the Crime of hating God in the proper Sense of that Expression sufficient to incur the Punishments denounced against the Wicked without involving us in our Parent's Guilt Perhaps it was from such Instances as these in Scripture that the  Papists have deduced their absurd Doctrine of Supererogation for if we are to be damned by another's Sin it may be reasonably implied that we may be saved by another's Merits Upon the whole I shall conclude with another Passage from the Scriptures  that the Wisdom of Man is but Foolishness in the Sight of God  Away then with all presumptuous Reasonings of this Kind but let us submit our Minds to Faith and begirt ourselves to good Works  Adieu my Heart's Delight my Soul's Desire Say you are well in your next Letter and then say you have obliged me  Henry  LETTER CCXXXVII  My Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED no Letter from you last Post and cannot know whether I shall hear from you by this 'till I return Tomorrow to It was unkind in you to neglect writing when you knew how uneasy I must be to have some Account of your Health I saw  Kitty  Yesterday who heard from some of her Friends and by not mentioning you I hope this Omission was not owing to your Disorder  I had a wild Night of it coming here and have not been so wet since I was last in the River I had no Cloaths with me but what I had on my Back so I have betaken myself to my Bed from whence I am now writing to you and drinking your Health and my own too in MilkWhey My kind Landlady who is also my Tenant upon Notice of my coming here Today has washed my Sheets in the Morning and my Room in the Evening to make me welcome  I observed an extraordinary Phaenomenon as I came along The Night was extremely dark and the Rain fell excessively Notwithstanding which the whole Mountain I rode over seemed to be on Fire with such an ember Light as is seen after the Blaze of a Bonfire is gone out I asked my Guide the Meaning of it whom I hired at the Foot of the Hill and he told me that all the heathy Grounds hereabouts have this Appearance by Night This is certainly a very great natural Curiosity but what I never observed or heard of before If this were real Fire it might put this Part of the Country into a terrible Combustion as the Collieries happen to meet in the Center of these Hills  This Thought led me insensibly on to the Consideration of the general Conflagration which is prophesied in Scripture and which  our Faith makes us expect at a certain Period from some extraordinary Act of divine Power but which I never heard accounted for from the Philosophy of Nature as it stands at present I shall therefore amuse you and myself with an Hypothesis for this Purpose and may sometime or other hereafter refer it to wiser Heads than ours whether there be any real Weight in this whimsical Opinion of mine or no  I must first give your a short Account of Astronomy This Globe of Earth as well as all the Planets of our solar System revolves about the Sun which Rotation is effected from the compounding of two different Powers the  Centripetal  which is the common Gravity of Bodies that mutually attract each other and if acting alone would occasion the Earth to be swallowed up by the Sun and the  Centrifugal  which is a Force impulsed upon all the Planets at their Creation that directs them forward in a right Line and if not counteracted by the first Power would propel the Body on through infinite Space to all Eternity Now both these Powers acting by the almighty Oeconomy upon our Earth at the same Time occasion a Motion compounded of both these Causes every Revolution of which is performed in that Period of Time that is called a Year From what I have said it is plain that if the  Centrifugal  Power was taken away the Earth must rush  into the Sun and so be destroyed by Fire But this would be a particular Act of the Almighty and my Philosophy is to explain the Possibility and Probability of this Effect by plain and natural Means which I apprehend may be occasioned by increasing the Weight of the Earth and consequently it's gravitating Powers For I think natural Philosophers agree that Bodies attract in Proportion to their Quantity of Matter which at a certain Degree will make the  Centripetal  overcome the  Centrifugal  Force Now my Opinion is that every living Creature Man Brute Insect  c  which has been produced since the Creation has made an Addition of so much Matter to the Earth as it's Weight came to at it's Birth The Increase of Bulk during it's Life I make no Account of because that proceeds from the Consumption of the Fruits of the Earth which drawing their Nourishment from the Earth itself alters only the Form not the specific Gravity but that Weight which the Creature brings into the World is certainly an Addition because the Parent neither eats or drinks more to bring the Foetus to Perfection than if she were not pregnant and if tried in Scales would be found to be of equal Weight before and afterexcept in the Case of Sickness or hard Labour neither of which is the natural Consequence of Procreation as may be observed from Brutes and other Animals  and from the Generality of the human Species too who have not weakened or debauched their natural Forces by Luxury Effeminacy or Excess I have no Library here so must be excused if I am not as full and as correct upon this Subject as I might be if I were among my Books But I always write to you in the same loose Manner that Things occur to my Mind at first Thought and often but just enter down Hints to supply us with Topics for Conversation when we are together  I am particularly pleased at this Hypothesis presenting itself to my Reflection as the explanation of any Prophecy by natural Means is a stronger Motive to our Belief than the mere Faith of it from a Miracle Now the Destruction of the World by Fire was denounced as I apprehend long before the Laws of Astronomy or the Gravitation of Matter was sufficiently known to authorize such an Hypothesis as this and as I am not quite orthodox insome Points I own that I heartily rejoice when I can make Amends in others and in reasoning about Religion or contemplating the Ways of Providence I think we ought in a stronger and more particular Manner to apply an Observation which I remember out of  Longinus  That in the reading of  Homer Plato  or any of those precious Spirits of Antiquity when any Passages occur to which we cannot readily  reconcile our Reason we ought firmly to believe that were those great Genii present to explain themselves we should to our Confusion be convinced that we only were guilty of those Errors which we blindly charged upon them  I think I may now lay myself down to sleep esteeming this Essay in the Place of a Prayer And may I have the Blessing of it in my Dreams by meeting you there in perfect Health  Have I not seen thee where thou hast not been  c  Adieu  LETTER CCXXXVIII  My Dearest Life  NO Words can express the distracted Situation of my Mind nor give you any Idea of the ill Treatment I have received from Indeed neither my Health nor Spirits can hold out much longer But I will do all I can to support myself under the complicated Pains of Body and Mind which I at present feel 'till I see you then gladly part with them and Life together  So 'till the Day was won the  Greek  renown'd  With Anguish wore the Arrow in his Wound  Then pluck'd the Weapon from his tortur'd Side  Let rush the Torrent of his Blood and dy'd  I know you will condemn me for letting my Spirits sink but as you do not know the Cause let not my sweet Love judge too harshly from the Effects A little Time will clear me from the Imputation of wanting either Philosophy or Religion Indeed the latter is my only Refuge I am sure the Almighty will never forsake me I know too he orders all Things right and that my present Distress may be productive of my future Happiness In the Sincerity of my Heart I bless the Hand that chasteneth and can say from my inmost Soul his Will not mine be done Yet still as a frail Mortal I cannot help feeling I am hurt and complaining to you though I do not repine for  Sighs and Cries by Nature grow on Pain  Your Account of your Journey to and Manner of lying there has made me vastly uneasy If you have one Grain of Affection for me you will take Care to preserve  my  Life  my  Health  my  Happiness for they are all bound up and centered in my dearest  Harry  's  I met with a very severe Shock from the Account of Mrs 's Death There is yet no Certainty of it but I much fear it is too true  They say she died in Childbed It is very possible those Barbarians she was among have murdered hervile Wretches I have not Patience with them Better they had all died than my poor dear Friend Her Failings are now forgotten Nay I know not that she had any But I am sure she had a thousand Virtues Oh she is happy But her poor little Children those  Hottentots  will kill themI wish it were in my Power to serve them  Adieu my Heart's dear  Harry  While I am myself I shall be your's  Frances  LETTER CCXXXIX  My Dearest Life  YOUR Letter of the th has given me a great deal of Concern Represent your Situation particularly to Lady for to me you have spoken only in general Terms and strictly follow her friendly and considerate Advice My Fortunes shall be your's so use them freely and that I did not offer this before was from a Regard to your Character which I have very nice and honest Reasons to be tender of I could with Pleasure wear Sackcloth and live on Bread and Water  to cloath you in Purple and  make you fare sumptuously every Day  In short I am such an Adventurer in this World that if I have Luck there's nothing in it and if not no Oeconomy can save my Fortune A Year's Industry will not make me rich but a Minute's Reflection can reconcile me to Poverty The utmost Diligence can but establish that Fund which may be thought necessary to this Life and which  Socrates  or  Pliny  needs not at present But let us cultivate that Treasure which will supply us to Eternity and may help us to bear a Part with those precious Spirits who are happy before us  Your Sentiment is both philosophic and religious "that your present Distress may produce your future Happiness"  Socrates  said he owed all his Philosophy to his Wife Every Man should endeavour to be a Philosopher not so much to support himself in Death as to be able to endure Life and when Misfortunes or Mortifications come upon us instead of repining we should thank Providence for the lucky Occasions of exercising that Virtue A wretched Man has greater Scope for Virtue than a happy Man and a poor Man than a rich  I could say a great deal more upon this Subject but I would not prevent your own Reflections  Adieu  my Heart's Delight  Henry  LETTER CCXL  I AM infinitely obliged to my dear  Harry  for his very affectionate Letter Though I am far from doubting your Love or Constancy yet I receive fresh Pleasure from every new Assurance of both as one is pleased to hear good News repeated though it does not want  Confirmation    Adversity is certainly the School of Virtue and of Wisdom We feel our own Defects and by the Loss of any Happiness or Advantage first discover our own Unworthiness and His Goodness who gave that and every other Blessing which we enjoy For my own Part I will say with the Psalmist  it is good for me that I have been afflicted  Though your dear Letter has made me vastly easier than I was I am not yet calm enough to write about my Affairs to Lady besides I am unwilling to determine on any thing 'till I see and consult you  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCXLI  My Dear  HARRY  I AM sorry any Accident should prevent our Letters from passing in a regular Course Indeed it is of little Consequence what becomes  of mine but as they may occasion a Disappointment to you  You desire to know what affects my Mind It would be impossible to recount the Multiplicity of Things which distress meIt is true there is a Cause painfully eminent above the rest which when we meet I fear you will think too soon to know 'till then the Sorrow it occasions shall be all my own  For it is the Wretch's Comfort still to have some little Hoard of Grief some unknown Woe which they may weep and wail and Gluttonlike devour alone  Indeed my dearest Life I would rather suffer any Thing than distress you I am sincerely sorry I even mentioned my Illness to you but I will complain no more therefore pardon what is past  I have been in a continual Hurry all Day It is now very late so must conclude with wishing you a thousand times good Night  LETTER CCXLII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    My Dearest Life  I SENT off an Express to and recovered your Letter of the third I return you Lady 's Letter which is very kind You cannot imagine what Pleasure your saying she stays here for the Winter has given me It is a very lucky as well as pleasing Circumstance for you at this particular Time which is enough to shew you how happy this Account has made me  I shall go to Town in the Beginning of the Term but am extremely uneasy to know what is the Meaning of the Hint you gave me in your last Letter  that you have something to say to me which you will not mention 'till we meet  I beg my  Fanny  you will explain yourself by next Post  I am now returned to  Montaigne  which I quitted for  Pliny  at your Request and I make it a Rule to give you my Observations upon every Book I read  In his History of the three most excellent Men he names  Homer Alexander  and  Epaminondas  By Excellence here he seems merely to consider this Expression with regard to Fame only But I think he has not as one might expect given us Examples from different Classes The first is a Poet the second a Soldier and so is the third when I expected a Philosopher and here I would name  Plato  or better  Socrates  But perhaps  Montaigne  considered  Epaminondas  in this Class and in the highest Degree as he is recorded to have practised what others only teach  Montaigne  makes a good Defence for representing human Nature not much to it's Advantage as in general the  French  Writers are apt to do "Others make Men I but report them"  I am pleased to find he had some of my Whims He mentions one which you may remember I sometimes hinted to you of taking a particular Fancy to some one Glass laid down at Table though of equal Dimensions with the rest out of which I often take a greater Pleasure in drinking nay I have gone so far once or twice as to pay a Man's Club for the Exchange of his Glass Whence such Caprices as this proceed I do not remember that any of the Expositors upon human Nature have accounted and I think it would be an ingenious and amusing Subject to inquire into  This puts me in Mind of a Theme I have a great Mind to recommend for a Premium to the Society of  Dijon  in  France  which is an Essay upon  Metaphorical Taste  being a Liking or Admiration not confined to or deducible from the established Rules of Beauty Harmony Order or Truth which should be the natural or rational Foundations of our Approbation Why is the Mind of Man when endued with what is called Taste delighted with extravagant Flights in Poetry extraordinary Metaphors Excesses in Grammar Chromatics in Music  c  How come we to be charmed with Things which offend common Sense or shock the natural Ear And from what Turn of Caprice does it proceed that the very Errors and Faults of some of the Arts and Sciences are esteemed as Beauties Nay to shew that Taste is not only above but even sometimes averse from rational Admiration we need but recollect the Pleasure we receive from viewing some of the Deformities of Nature as Rocks Precipices  c  and at the same Time remember that we are sensible of a certain Horror during the Contemplation  Have you seen that Piece which carried the last Premium at  Dijon  upon this Thesis Whether the Reestablishment of Arts and Sciences has contributed to the Refinement of Manners I have read it and like the Side of the Question  he has chosen by denying it I think the Subject might have been handled more at large and to better Advantage than the Author has done there  Quid juvat innumeros scire atque evolvere Casus  Si fugienda facis et facienda fugis  What does it import us to know the Springs of Good and Ill while we do those Things which we ought not to have done and leave undone those Things which we ought to have done I have not yet seen the Answer to it but when I have I shall probably determine the Dispute like Sir  Roger de Coverley  by concluding "that much may be said on both Sides"  What the  Genevan  says of Learning with regard to Morals I have often said of it with regard to Understanding That it has so overloaded the Mind of Man that like too full a Stomach the digestive Powers have not Room to exert themselves or it has confined our Reflections by setting Bounds to our Inquiries or given us a Biass out of the right Road by obliging us to think too much after one another and following in a beaten Track When Reason attempts to exercise herself in the Mind of the Learned she finds it like a Storehouse so filled with the old Trumpery of the Antients that she has hardly Room to stretch her Limbs I am for recurring up to the Original of all  Things and drinking Truth at the Fountainhead not quenching my Thirst of Knowledge in polluted Streams Rivers in passing through populous Cities acquire indeed a Softness and a Richness but lose the Sweetness and Purity which they brought from their Spring If you want to inform yourself of Art or Science withdraw to your Study if of Truth or Nature retire within yourself Reading should be your Exercise but Reflection your Study Sense is a Bottle of Essence which loses it's Strength by Dilatation or like a Wedge of Gold which hammered into Plates or drawn into Wire extends it's Dimensions but weakens it's Substance  Adieu  my Life  Henry  LETTER CCXLIII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    ROchefoucault  says  In the Adversity of our best Friends we find something that does not displease us  I will not absolutely say this Maxim is verified in you yet I cannot help observing with what vast Calmness you have endured my Misfortunes I do indeed believe  that the Distresses of others furnish the best Opportunity for exerting our Philosophy  When they are lash'd we kiss the Rod  Resigning to the Will of God  And then we have such a charming Superiority by making light of those Misfortunes which do not affect ourselves But I should be glad to see one of our modern Philosophers endure the Loss of Health with that Indifference they recommend to others  If Lady stays in the Kingdom which is yet doubtful she will not come to  London  the whole Winter I heartily wish she may hold her Resolution of staying at as I hope and believe I shall spend some Time with her for I am absolutely determined not to continue here long When we meet you shall know my Reasons which I fancy will be sufficient to make you entirely of my Opinion In the mean Time I shall exert the little Strength of Body and Mind I have left to bear up against the Distresses of both without complaining I must intreat for the present you will not desire any Explanation from me for I am resolved not to enter into Particulars 'till I see you which I never so earnestly longed for as now I could almost wish you were as impatient to see me we should then meet before "the Beginning of Term" However a few  Days will make no great Difference and I am content to wait 'till Business answers the same End as Inclination  Though I never wanted the Aid of Philosophy more than now I find myself less qualified than ever to seek it's Help  In Pain Philosophy is Spleen in Health 'tis only Ease  Perhaps it is owing to my Want of Health that I find my Mind a perfect Chaos I have not Attention sufficient to read for a Quarter of an Hour I perceive myself frequently absent in Company without being able to recollect what I was thinking of Strange Situation When wilt thou recall me to myself If you have fixed the Time of your coming to Town let me know by Return of the Post that I may be certified not  how long  but  when  I shall live  Adio Caro  Frances  LETTER CCXLIV  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I RECEIVED a Letter from you just as I was leaving  Belvidere  Yesterday which has surprized me more than any thing I have ever met with  The Reason of applying those philosophic Lectures which you are offended at was from this Blunder That I thought the Loss of Health Fortune Friends or any other Unhappiness of Life was the proper Season to recommend such Medicines and it ought to be observed I did not use such Reflections to shew how  I  could bear your Misfortunes but to instruct and assist  you  to support yourself under them He who would comfort another comes not as I apprehended with Sighs and Groans  I shall never upon any Occasion trouble you with more of my Philosophy but shall always cherish it in my Heart because at this Time it stands your Friend and helps me to conclude myself as usual  My dear  Fanny  Ever your's    LETTER CCXLV  My Dearest  FANNY  I RETURN you Lady 's Letter and am pleased to find that you still hold on a Correspondence with her I love her for rallying your Spirits I am ashamed for my  Fanny  with two such philosophic Friends to be so cast down She seems to solicit your writing often to her  which surely I need not intreat you to obey but shall only leave you more at Liberty to do so by letting you know that if Time presses I will take your having wrote to her as a sufficient Apology for your leaving me to hunt through the Stores of Antiquity for something to amuse me in the room of those Letters you neglect to me How much do I regard your Advantage before my own Pleasure And for any Favour she can ever do me I thus pay the Price beforehand  I thank you for your kind Sentiments with Regard to passing your Time with me and it is certain that those Portions of Life which we spend agreeably to ourselves are all that can be computed in a Philosopher's Kalendar I am pleased with the Epitaph which  Similis  a General under  Adrian  directed to be inscribed on his Tombstone He had spent a long Life in Perils and Fatigues 'till about seven Years before his Death when he retired to his Villa passing his Time as became a Man of Religion Sense and Philosophy The  Latin  is  Hic jacet  Similis  cujus Aetas multorum Annorum suit Ipse septem duntaxat Annos vixit  I will attempt the Translation for you  My Life O Time to many Years amount  But seven only make my own Account  For my Part I have made three Divisions of my Time and according to the Distinctions  I make there are but two Portions of them to be attributed to my Life When I am in Company I  pass  my Time when I am alone I  spend  it and while I am with you I  enjoy  it  Since the Election at I have had the Happiness to be entirely alone which the Hurry I was then in has given me a thorough Relish for I do not think it amiss to consider the World as a Prison where we are subject to such Company as Chance Necessity Vice or Misfortune have associated us with And Solitude may be deemed the true Siege of Freedom as there alone we can be Masters of Ourselves our Time and Occupations The only Thing in which I think  Augustus  attempted to be great was his Wish to live to retire but he was never great enough to execute that noble Sentiment It is somewhere said that  Privacy and Freedom is the Wish of the Great but the Privilege of the Mean  The Life I lead at present is certainly the End proposed of all the Labours and Perils of the Great in all States of Life then what a true philosophic Pleasure must a Man be sensible of who has reached this Goal without being out of Breath for it while he looks back with Compassion upon Millions who are sweating and toiling casting away Pomps Fasces and Fortune to make themselves light for the Race and shouldering through opposing Crouds to come up  to him What the Philosopher  Cyneas  said to  Pyrrhus  might be here applied but that I hate Quotations however I shall give you one  Diogenes  said that  Aristotle  must go to Dinner when  Alexander  's Bell rung but  he  was at Liberty to wait for the Summons of his Appetite  In the World we are obliged to act by Rule but in Retirement we can act according to Reason  Adieu thou dear Object or Idea of those Portions of Time which I treasure up as the only Parts of my Life  Henry  LETTER CCXLVI  I AM much obliged to my dear  Harry  for the Indulgence he is so kind to grant me I have a much better Right to plead that Privilege at present than I can ever have from writing to Lady or any other Person which is my being utterly incapable of writing from real Illness I have been all Day on the Bed and though I ventured to  BondStreet  in hopes of rouzing my Spirits I find myself so very weak and languid that I am hardly able to hold the Pen I have had a severe Fit of the Rheumatism in my Arm which joined to a constant Cough  prevents my sleeping an Hour at a Time the whole Night  I am ashamed of living a constant Complainant I think it would be but decent in me to die for indeed I am quite weary of Life But  Death comes not at Call nor mends his slowest Pace for Plaints or Cries  I am extremely glad you are so happy in your Retirement I would by no means have you quit it for the tumultuous Haunts of busy idle Men Let me at least have the Satisfaction of thinking you are well and well pleased which is the only Thing on Earth that can give real Pleasure to my dearest Life's own sick  Fanny  LETTER CCXLVII  My Dearest  FANNY  I SENT to the Post Yesterday but had no Letter from you which I should have been extremely uneasy at but that  Kitty  sent me on▪ from you to her which does not say you are worse though you still complain I came over here just after I wrote last to you and breakfasted with  Kitty  in my Way This was but the second Time I have seen her since you left her which she seems picqued at and complains  that I am grown peevish for she is one of those who cannot distinguish between Gravity and Illhumour or knows any Difference between Reproof and Scolding  I enjoy as much Solitude here as I did lately at  Belvidere  and live after my own Manner which is not to dine 'till Night I am more the Hermit here too which makes some Variety for I dress my own Meals broil my Chops and roast my Potatoes by my Chamber Fire for I chuse them clean and they are but flatternly People who rent this House from me though they are  English  and Protestants I do assure you my Life that I grudge myself every Morsel I eat in this or any Retirement unenjoyed by thee and would very chearfully fast three Days for the Pleasure of your dining with me the fourth  As I have a Way of philosophizing upon even the most trifling Occasions I have begun to look upon Epicurism in a very different Light from what I have always considered it It is certain that the Epicure has a greater and more frequent Enjoyment of Life than a Man of vulgar Appetite I grant that the reducing our Wants to as few Things as possible has more of the Philosopher in it but perhaps to multiply our Pleasures may be the more sensible Scheme within the Bounds of Reason and Innocence They who argue against this Voluptuousness  may from the same Rule prohibit a refined Taste for Letters Painting or Music But though they should indulge us a little in what they call rational Pleasures they will find that all their vain Philosophy against the Enjoyments of Sense is but a certain Stoical Pride which would pretend to set human Nature above any Satisfaction which they may have in common with Brutes I wonder they have not yet attempted to stop our Breath and Motion because Brutes have both  I am my dearest Life while I have Appetite Breath or Motion your own rational Brute  LETTER CCXLVIII  October    AS I know it will give my sweet Love Pleasure I find a very sincere one in being able to acquaint him that I am vastly better than when I wrote last My Cough is somewhat abated and I have slept tolerably well these two Nights  I fancy I live as retired in the midst of a great City as you in your Hermitage I cook for myself and drink rather than eat by myself for I live entirely on Broth Chocolate and Tea I find Slops agree with me much  better than Meat for I am surely sick if I touch it  My Wishes for you are not confined to MealTimes nor do I suppose your's are No Moment passes but I sigh for you What do I suffer in being separated from thee When when shall we meet to part no more  I am so far an Epicurean as to believe that Providence designed a full and perfect Use of all it's Bounties to his Creature Man  For Heav'n is paid when Man receives  T' enjoy is to obey  Else wherefore with an unwithdrawing Hand did he create them It is the Abuse of these which constitutes the Crime and which in general bears it's Punishment in the very Commission of it  To the late Revel and protracted Feast  Wild Dreams succeeded and disorder'd Rest  They who indulge the Gratification of any Appetite to Excess are far below the Brutes and to debar ourselves of any Enjoyment within the Bounds of Innocence and Reason is  to live like Nature's Bastards not her Sons  Every Person's particular Circumstances ought to fix the Bounds of their SelfIndulgence for there are many Gratifications which would be criminal in me that may be both reasonable and innocent for a Person who has a large Fortune  Were I Mistress of ten thousand Pounds a Year I would not wish to multiply my Desires which are now confined within a very narrow Compass because by not having many of my own I might gratify others which is to me the highest Enjoyment human Nature is capable of There indeed we rise superior to the Brute Creation who I believe have much the Advantage in all sensual Pleasures for theirs are unmolested with Intemperance or Remorse Yet I do not think this is a Cause for us to spurn the rational Enjoyment of those Pleasures we have in common with the Animal World Let us rather follow their Example in those Particulars where we appear most on a Level with them by following not oppressing Nature which is in them another Name for what we call Reason  I have been insensibly led into a Subject which I am conscious I am by no Means capable of treating justly But you I am sure will excuse my Errors on this and every Occasion as they proceed only from the Weakness of my Head not Badness of my Heart which is filled and guarded by your loved Idea  Adieu my utmost Wish my fond Desire and only Hope My Life my Love adieu  LETTER CCXLIX  Dear  FANNY  YOU reproach me gallantly enough with only wishing for your Company at Board But indeed my Love I have one constant equal Earnestness toward you which is never broke through except that I wish for your Company with a more particular Fondness upon some Occasions when I happen to be in such a Situation or romantic Circumstance as I know would suit your Taste or give you an additional Relish to my Company Have you not sometimes during a constant Tenor of Health perceived at particular Periods a certain Lightness of Heart and Wantonness of Fancy which you could not account for somewhat like the Gleam of Chearfulness in the Mind which is raised by the sudden Rays of Sunshine breaking through a Cloud Something analogous to this I am frequently sensible of toward you My Love is never less than Health but my Fondness often rises to an Excess of Ardor equal to those extraordinary Spirits I am alluding to And as these Flights of the Soul seem to be it's Essays towards a more perfect State I may be said to love you in general like a Man but upon such extraordinary Occasions to adore you with the Fervor of an Angel  I am extremely pleased at the little Essay I led you into upon the Epicurean Philosophy for upon all such Occasions my dear little Philosopher acquits herself with Justness of Sentiment and Elegance of Expression I wish greatly that you had Leisure to exert your Strength more frequently upon such Topics for believe no Flatterer you have a native Force of Mind which as some Poet expresses it  Leaves puzzled Learning lab'ring far behind  Adieu  my Pleasure  LETTER CCL  My Dear  FANNY  I SEND you inclosed a Letter I had last Post from  Tom  which is a great Improvement to the uneasy Situation I am in at present and likely to be farther involved in  I am my dearest  Fanny  in these and many Circumstances too irksome to trouble you with extremely to be pitied I find now the great Benefit and Blessing of that Turn of Mind which I have for these two Years past endeavoured to cultivate in myself to prevent the  Consequences of a very warm violent and precipitate Disposition of Temper which I was born with and indulged in too much during the former Part of my Life It is not when Misfortunes come upon us the Time to set about the Philosophy of bearing or the Resignation of submitting to them It is in Health we should prepare ourselves against Sickness or the Invalid may find his Couch his Grave  I have brought a very severe Cold from which breaks in upon my Scheme of Solitude as it confines me entirely within Doors It has not yet made any Attack upon my Throat which is all the Danger I ever apprehend from that Disorder  Adieu  my Life my Love  LETTER CCLI  My dearest sick Love  I AM particularly concerned at your Cough for it is the worst Symptom of a Cold and what your slight Constitution inclined to an Hectic and Decay is very little able to bear My Love to the  India  Folk because you say they have been very kind and affectionate to you  I am displeased at your saying you are weary of Life It is at least unkind if not something  worse It is the Sign of a Lowness of Spirits and a Carelessness which is much below your Sense Virtue or Religion I cannot excuse any one for speaking without Thought who is capable of thinking so well It was said by one of the Antients  that a patient Resignation to necessary Evils was next to the Merit of a voluntary Martyrdom  This was a fine Saying in the Days of superstitious Enthusiasm when Men officiously threw themselves in the Way of Persecution in order to merit the eighth Beatitude but at present the first Virtue mentioned above stands unrivalled Let Men repine at what Misfortune they will it will be found upon Examination that their Loss of Patience is the greatest Evil they labour under The absurd Notion of natural Right to the good Things of this Life occasions our Uneasiness at their Loss but consider Matters philosophically or religiously and all the Concern vanishes We cannot challenge a Property in any Thing from Providence in this Life for we were not in a Condition to make Terms for ourselves before we came into it but we should consider ourselves here in an happy State of establishing an indefeasible Right to the highest Enjoyments of the next Neither Health or Fortune we can call our own where every Thing fluctuates incessantly and if our Furniture be Glass why should we be surprized at it's being broken  And it is as vain and ridiculous to grieve at any Loss of worldly Advantage as it would be to be mortified because  The very Air you breathe this Day  The next may help an Ass to bray  Which is the only Distich I remember of a Poem I wrote some Years ago upon this very Subject  Now observe ma Seule et chere Mignonne that I am not scolding but only philosophizing which being premised I shall go on with an Observation I have made long since upon one of the Beatitudes I forget which in Order but the Text is  Blessed are the Poor in Spirit  c  Here is methinks an Instance among many of the Difference between the Christian and Heathen Philosophy which some Authors vain of the natural Reason of Man have affirmed to be the same The latter teaches us Contempt for Riches and Fortitude in Misfortunes But the former inspires us with a Resignation to Poverty and Patience under Sufferings One but increases the savage Fierceness of Man's Nature into a Pride and Stoicism above it The other softens us into a Spirit of Humility and Meekness not below but consonant to the imperfect State of Man in this Life While Men either before or during their Ignorance of Revelation considered themselves  only with Regard to this Life perhaps the Heroism of Stoic Philosophy might sufficiently answer the Purposes of human Nature in this confined View But of what Use are Virtues Sentiments or Affections cultivated here which can never be exerted in that State where there will be no Pomps fit to contemn or Misfortunes to oblige us to suffer while the Spirit of Meekness and Humility will sufficiently answer our Ends here and is the proper Temper to prepare us for the Enjoyment of Love and Contemplation which are the Occupations of  the Blest above    As your Cold has probably taken away what little Appetite you had I shall send you up by  Thursday  's Stage a Crock of the finest pickled Walnuts you ever saw or tasted I wish I could send you some of my Mutton as little and as sweet but somewhat fatter as yourself My Hams however will soon come and I shall carry up some of them for youSweet good Night  Take Notice that I always kiss my Letters going to you as I do those I receive from you and have just put my Lips to the Expression "the Blest above" thy sole Superiors  Henry  LETTER CCLII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    My dearest Life  AMIDST the Noise and Impertinence I am at present surrounded with I am indeed utterly incapable of answering your very elegant Treatise but incumbered as I am with Multitudes I can love and thank you for it Indeed my sweet Love you can reconcile me to any Misfortune but your Absence for while you prove from Philosophy and Religion the trifling  Value  we ought to set on what are called the good Things of this Life you still inhance your  own  My Love my Friendship my Esteem seem to increase daily though it is long since I thought I had arrived at the highest Degree of each for thee my Life my Love  I thank you for your intended Present I doubt not their being excellent but alas unshared by thee what Delicacy can please Haste then my Love to give me a Relish for every Enjoyment for I neither know wish nor hope for any but in thee  While I pressed the dear Spot which thou hadst blessed with the Impression of thy Lips I found a Joy which might indeed be felt even  by angelic Natures unmixed with any Passion that might disgrace an Angel my Soul seemed ready to issue at my Lips in hopes of meeting thine None but those who love like you and me can have an Idea of such Pleasures  I have spent the Day at your Brother's where there are a little Hundred met to be merry They pity my Melancholy for indeed I am not gay But I feel a higher Satisfaction than the broadest Mirth is capable of in subscribing myself faithfully and affectionately  Your's  Frances  LETTER CCLIII  HENRY  to  FRANCES    I AM at a Loss to know whether my Love or Pride is most gratified at your kind Acceptance of those little occasional Essays which I sometimes send you for your Amusement or Guidance in Life but I shall refer the Satisfaction to my Love as that comprehends my best and highest Pride too It is but just in me to make you some Return of that Philosophy which you have taught me But in this Science you are infinitely my Superior for I can but create in you a Disregard for the Things stiled  of this World merely by shewing their Trivialness and Vanity in themselves but you have inspired me with an utter Contempt of them by putting them in Comparison with your own Worth However my Philosophy is neither of the Cynic or Misanthrope Kind I have neither an Aversion to Men or Things for I can very well indulge myself with both but then I consider them like a Dream or a Feast which serve as Amusements for the Time and leave either no Longing or a Satiety behind Indeed I take the true Use of Philosophy to be not to vex ourselves in Prosperity but to comfort us in Adversity In short we need not be so rigidly on our Guard against the Pleasures of this Life for they seldom happen or continue long enough to soften or emasculate our Natures But Disappointments or Misfortunes are the Things which are most familiar to us and yet by our Uneasiness seem the Things which we are least used to Most of the Mortifications we complain of are what we owe to one another a great many of which may be avoided if we justly considered Men but as Tools An Instrument which has not Sharpness enough for a Razor may have Strength sufficient for a ParingShovel and that which has not Toughness for an Hammer may have proper Weight for a Mallet Now to instance in Men would make a miserable Confidant but if you are to  make an Apology he can tell an admirable Lye for you is not of Stuff to make a Friend but nobody directs a Coachman to  Ranelagh  better indeed cannot write Letters but sure he can carry them to the Post would be but an indifferent Comforter in Affliction but then he can make you laugh and forget it So that a tolerable Judgment upon the different Characters of Mankind may help us to work some useful End even out of the Worst and Meanest And as to the Evils and Goods of Life a religious Sense of them will be found to be the only true philosophic one to consider the first as a Reprobation of our Faults and so amend and the latter as a Reward of our Virtues and so persevere  I took a solitary Walk in my Fields this Evening contemplating upon such Subjects as these and think I never observed a more beautiful Western Sky at the Setting of the Sun This shall be the Test with me whether there be a true poetical Genius in this Island at present for such a one must certainly like  Prometheus  catch Fire at the Sun in so much Glory For no Person can be eminent in this Art who has not a strong Enthusiasm about the Beauties of Nature nor without a certain inspired though not an acquired Knowledge of the Philosophy of it too What are all the Hints and Allusions to Arts and Sciences some  of them unknown to the World and others supposed to be so to himself which the Commentators mark out in  Homer  's Works but a Sort of Praesentiment or as it were a Flight at Science which duller Mortals were forced to earn thro' the Labour of Academies I think such Instances as these with Dreams and many other Proofs of stronger Force may be brought as Arguments for the Independence of the human Soul upon Matter For tho' we should allow the Materialists that the Knowledge we attain from the Deductions of Reasoning or Reflection may be but the natural Effect of the animal Spirits upon the Fibres of the Brain which is the unintelligible Jargon they speak yet surely the Discoveries we sometimes make without any Deduction at all cannot be accounted for from the mere Organization of Matter but must arise from a certain Impulse foreign to it  Adieu  my Love  Henry  LETTER CCLIV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    AS I am thoroughly convinced that my dear  Harry  is a much better Judge of his own Affairs than I can pretend to be I will never  let my Overanxiousness for his Welfare betray me into so great an Error as offering my Advice but rest satisfied with believing that he will use every honest and prudent Means for our mutual Happiness  I was so extremely ill on  Saturday  that I was not able to hold a Pen The continual Distraction and Uneasiness of my Mind has almost destroyed my little Body I am doubly unhappy that your Circumstances prevent your coming to Town Your Presence would soften all my Sorrows and subdue even Pain and Sickness How have I flattered myself that you longed as ardently to see me as I do to see you and yet you will not answer to my oftrepeated Question When will you come I am impatient at your Absence and yet afraid to wish you here The Situation of your Affairs distracts me I do not regard myself but cannot bear to think that you are unhappy Do not be angry with me  Harry  for saying that I most earnestly wish and pray the Almighty to take me to his Mercy I know my Death would be of Use to you Your Father and all your Friends would then be free from any Apprehension of your injuring yourself for an unhappy Woman who would die to serve you That single Consideration could disarm the Spectre of his Terrors and take away his Sting for I could part with thee my Life my  Love my Soul to save thee from Misfortune and Distress  My Spirits are so entirely sunk that I am utterly unable to write You may scold if you please but indeed I cannot get the better of myself  Adieu then my Soul's Hope my Life's Pain and Pleasure  Frances  LETTER CCLV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    THOUGH I am thoroughly convinced that my Letters cannot afford you the least Entertainment yet I think it in some measure incumbent on me to acknowledge your's as insolvent Debtors are more frequently obliged to make Promises to their Creditors than those who are able but not willing to pay Like them too my oftrepeated Thanks only prove my Poverty but were I capable of making any other Return I would rather pay than own the Debt You must then my dear Teacher accept the little All I have to offer as freely as I give it my Love Esteem and Gratitude which are indeed sincerely your's  I am afraid to write any more lest I should enter into the  Melpomene  Strain for notwithstanding all your Precepts I cannot will not be satisfied while you withhold my primum Mobile your dear Self from me Indeed  Harry  though you do not know it your Philosophy renders you cold and indifferent to me else how is it possible for you to abstain from even wishing to be with meHang up PhilosophyI will have done You shall not be teazed with my Complaints though sure I have much Cause to be uneasy for in thy Absence Joy is seen no more  May that Health and Chearfulness which is fled from me be doubled to my Love and I will not regret them  Adieu  my dearest  Harry  Frances    LETTER CCLVI  My Dear  FANNY  AS I have had no Letter from you last Post I shall employ that Portion of Time which is more particularly dedicated to you three Times a Week in communicating to you such Reflections as occur to me at present which I take just in the very Order they succeed one another in my own Mind  I am forsooth a great PhilosopherI practise it in myself and perform it to all the World In the severest Trials I think I should be able to exhibit myself to the Satisfaction of all Spectators In a Gaol I could comfort myself with these Reflections  Here I can enjoy a perfect Vacation from all Business or Care All Solicitude after Honours and all Anxiety about Fortune are useless here because incompatible with my present State I can here give up my whole Time to Reading and Contemplation without the Reproach of Idleness and can here indulge my muchloved Solitude without the Imputation of a misanthrope Singularity Here my Occupation and my Leisure are all my own for few intrude upon the Wretch's Levee Welcome the Interruption of those that do for he must be a Friend indeed who seeks us in a Gaol Happy then thricehappy State which at the same Time proves our Virtue and approves our Friends  Even in the Day of Sickness and the Night of Death could I sustain the Pains and survey the Terrors with an unshaken Mind from this Soliloquy  Grant just God that the Vices Errors and Follies of my past intemperate Youth may be opposed at the great Day of Account against the humane Offices I have performed in Act and the general Benevolence I have  always had in Will even to the vast Circle of all created or possible Beings of the Universe and in this Hope welcome thou glorious Death so much dreaded because so little understood  Welcome thou Cordial to a troubled Breast  The softest Remedy that Grief can find  The gentle Spell that lulls our Cares to Rest  And calms the ruffling Passions of the Mind  Thou happy Minute the first of Immortality how have Men traduced thee by comparing thee to a long Sleep but Sleep is a tedious Death while Death is but an instant Sleep  Yet with all this Appearance of Philosophy I am prone to Anger Passion and Resentment and though I am sufficiently aware of this Foible and set the whole Force of my Reason against it I am not Master enough of myself to preserve my Temper sometimes upon the slightest Provocation even of the Folly of a Child Now what is the Reason of such a remarkable Inconsistency in my Character has been the Subject of this Hour's Contemplation and I have attributed it to this that Nature must universally prevail and will always be found too strong for Art In the first Instances I mentioned to you I owe my Philosophy to an happy Turn of Constitution and Genius to a certain Carelessness about and sovereign Contempt  for the Things of this Life when they are out of my Power though nobody enjoys them more when they are within my Reach and an elevated Hope and strong Conviction of the Enjoyments of the other World by the frequent Contemplation of which I have happily improved Nature into an Habit of Philosophy But in the latter Case I am almost afraid Art will never be able to conquer Nature though at some Times it may govern or disguise it because perhaps trifling Occasions do not sufficiently call upon my Philosophy to exert itself and no Army is so soon overcome as that which too much despises it's Enemy  Adieu  LETTER CCLVII  YOUR Letters fill me at once with the extremest pleasure and the tenderest Concern My Heart melts in me while I read thy Thoughts A Kind of gentle Tremor throbs my Breast which is not to be described nor understood by any who have not felt the Extremes of Joy and Grief which I have known for thee The little Understanding I am Mistress of is charmed with truly philosophic Sentiments But the fond Woman is hurried into Grief and Madness at the bare Mention  of those Subjects which are indeed the real but severe Trials of our Religion and Philosophy I have many Times been so weak you perhaps may call it cruel as to lament the Possibility of your dying I am certain I shall never be able to think of your Death either in a christian or philosophic Light Let me intreat you never to mention it more Indeed I cannot bear the Thought  Forlorn of thee whither should I betake me where subsist  Oh if you love me  Harry  the single Consideration of my Distress in being torn from thee should make you even anxious to delay your future Happiness You would not call the Moment of our Separation an happy one were thy Soul linked to mine as mine to thee  Oh the soft Commerce oh the tender Ties  Close twisted with the Fibres of the Heart  Which broken break themand drain off the Soul  Of human Joy and make it Pain to live  And is it then to live when we two part  'Tis the Survivor diesMy Heart no more  I doubt not but you will think my Tenderness upon this Occasion intirely selfish Indeed I grant it is sofor I would leave thee  Harry  with Transport leave thee well knowing that my Death would be conducive to thy Happiness Your Religion and Philosophy would prevent  the Effects of your natural TendernessMy little happy Spirit for such I doubt not it would be should minister unseen to thy gentle Sorrow and bring thee Peace and Comfort from above My Mind is somewhat chear'd by this last Hope  I shall conclude my Letter here as it would be the Art of sinking to mention even our Meeting in this World which indeed I begin to despair of but in a strong Hope of our future Happiness I subscribe myself  Eternally your's  Frances  LETTER CCLVIII  FRANCES  to  HENRY    I AM vastly uneasy at not hearing from you last Post I have a thousand Apprehensions lest some Accident should have befallen my Heart's Treasure for I am sure he is not capable of neglecting me The Badness of the Weather adds to my Concern Every Drop of Rain that falls shrinks me as if it touched my Heart when I think that thou it's dearest Part art perhaps exposed to it I work myself into an hundred different Terrors on your Account yet still I hope that God in whom we trust  will protect and save thee from every Danger  He shall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy Ways  I flatter myself that Tomorrow's Post will bring me glad Tidings 'Till then I will endeavour to suspend my Fears but for the present my Mind is too much disturbed to allow my writing on any Subject that could afford you the least Entertainment What would I not give to be with you this Moment I should find more Joy in being wet dirty and tired on that Occasion than all the Pleasures of this World can give me I have often longed for  Gyges  ' Ring but never so much as now I have frequently amused myself with thinking of the extreme Pleasure I should have in surprising you with my Presence at the very Moment you were perhaps lamenting my Absence or wishing for me to share in the rational Delight you sometimes receive from a fine Passage in a favourite Author This Whim has entertained me much and by the Force of Fancy I have spent many delightful Hours in your Musaeum when you little thought I was so near you I have in the same Manner accompanied you many a Mile in your Evening Walks and held long Conversations with you though you perhaps never utttered a Syllable during the Time of such imaginary Discourse I never found any thing  in Castlebuilding half so pleasant as thisIt annihilates both Time and Space and brings us together in spight of the Severity of that ill Fate which parts us But I hope soon to see this and all other imaginary Joys realized in the substantial Bliss of seeing and conversing with thee my dearest  Harry    I am in some Concern about my two last Letters directed to  Belvidere  as you left Home before they could reach you There was one of them inclosed in your Brother's which I fear your Uncle has openedLet me know their Fate as soon as you are acquainted with it  Adieu my Heart's Delight I am with Love Truth and Constancy ever your's  Frances  LETTER CCLIX  I HAVE passed a very disagreeable Time of it since I set out for the Hosts I have met with thought the best Way to make me welcome was to make me drunk Consider how irksome it must be for a Man to be forced to a Thing which he does not like who does not even care to be pressed to what he does What a terrible Thing must it be for one who hates drink to be obliged to it without any Inducement toward it to keep Company with Men  that I would rather even get drunk than converse with and yet to be under the Necessity of doing both at the same Time At I was  ill  treated with Corporation Politics and sour Claret and at with Puns and Beer At length I have escaped hither to my agreeable Friend where I shall as it were perform Quarantine before I betake my impatient Steps toward thy Feast of Reason  I am  my dearest Girl  Eternally your's  Henry  LETTER CCLX  THOUGH I think I have been pretty much used to Disappointments I find I am not yet Philosopher enough to bear them without a sensible Chagrin Perhaps it is owing to the punctual Exactness of my own Disposition that I am hurt at the most trifling Breach of Promise when committed by any Person for whom I have the least Regard For these Reasons I have felt more Uneasiness at the frequent Disappointment of my Expectations with Regard to your coming to Town than I should from a Certainty of your not coming these six MonthsBut a Truce with the Subject  for I am determined never to mention it more  I am mighty glad you have escaped from the disagreeable Circumstances you mention and are so happy with your agreeable Friend As it is not in my Power to make you Amends for the Loss of his Conversation I shall not detain you longer than while I subscribe myself  Sincerely your's  Frances  LETTER CCLXI  I AM returned home safe to my Elysium and did not see so sweet a Place since I left it A Cow dead two Sheep six Turkeys two Ducks and a Goose stolen was all my Loss while I was away I forgot a Ferret died These Things have greatly ruffled the Calmness of my Uncle's Humour especially the first for it was one of my Weaver's Cows which I had sold to him about a Month before and thought it between half honest and half humane to make good his Loss My Uncle disputed very logically with me upon this Head that it was not an Act which Honesty required because I had fulfilled my Part already in delivering the Cow and was not to be a Guarantee against Accidents He said that Humanity was no  more concerned with him than any other Object of Charity  c c  All which I acknowledge to be true and yet I had some strong Idea roving in my Mind that I was but acting justly not from any particular Law of Morality or Religion but from something higher that adapts itself to many nice Circumstances which express Laws cannot reach This is I suppose what the Philosophers and Divines stile Conscience something as  Prior  expresses it  Beyond the fix'd and settled Rules  Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools  c  There is certainly such a Thing as original Truth coeval with Eternity Part of the Essence of God and not a Law of his ordaining This is that charming Idea which the Mind of Man contemplates in itself with so much philosophic Rapture This primitive Reason is the great Criterion which guides noble or uninslaved Minds when they see fit to depart from exceed or act directly opposite to the express Laws of God or Man which being but imperfect Deductions from that original Source necessarily established for the Regulation of Men's Lives who have not Sense or Leisure to contemplate the native Beauty of Truth or Virtue enough to embrace it may be deviated according as Reason or Conscience instructs the unprejudiced Mind the great Law would have  been directed in such a particular Case or Instance I am extremely provoked at the unphilosophic Assertion of  Descartes    that two and two make four not from original Necessity but because God Almighty willed it so  I have just sent to the Stage and if a Place be vacant I shall go up to Town in it  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCLXII  NOT one Word from my Pet these two Posts Perhaps you did not get my Letters regularly while I was on my Route for I did not know the Course of the Posts as well as I do at home You see how ready I am to make an Excuse for you and attribute your Omission to any thing rather than vex myself with vain Fears of your Sickness or Neglect but in such a Case I know that my dear Heautontimorumenos would immediately conclude me indifferent to her or dead to myselfAnd indeed you may as well suppose me one as the other  But this is nothing to the principal Business of this Letter which is to desire Tea exactly at Seven o'Clock on  Tuesday  Evening  None enter may but Love and he  Shall guard the Door and keep the Key  As I dare say my Life thinks this Account Entertainment enough for this Post I shall husband what little Wit or Sense I have for another Occasion and conclude myself  My dear Girl  Your's eternally  Henry  LETTER CCLXIII  Dear  FANNY  I AM alone here for my Uncle is in the Rheumatism again at I want nothing but you to compleat my Happiness here You cannot imagine the different Sensations I have in this present Vacation from what I am sensible of when I have peevish or difficult People to deal with In short Peace is to the Mind what Health Is to the Body Grace to Religion and Chearfulness to Virtue Without these enlivening Qualities how dead and inactive are all their Subjects Without them all how poor an Animal is Man When endowed with them what a noble and amiable Creature The Love of Gods and the emulating Envy  of Angels Nay how much more glorious is the State of a good Man than even Angels themselves We suppose them at first made perfect and guiltless to Sin but mere Man by the Power of his own Virtue can render himself equal to that Perfection which was at once the Act of Omnipotence with Regard to them You see I lay hold on every fair Occasion of raising the Dignity of human Nature above the disingenuous and unphilosophic Sarcasms of  Theophrastus La Bruyere Rochefoucault Swift  and the Tribe of Authors of that Stamp Such  Satirists  are unjustly stiled  Moralists  which is the Title they vainly arrogate to themselves  I am  my dearest  Fanny  Impatiently your's    LETTER CCLXIV  My Dear  FANNY  I WAS affronted last Post but you have made Amends this by giving a Reason for your Neglect You are a  good  Pet now because you was not  a Pet  when I wrote a little warmly to you lately You behaved once or twice in the same Manner at which gives me Hopes of your reforming from the only  Fault I ever charged you with I did not say I would have no more Complaining as if I would not listen to any Pain or Distress of your's in order to console and relieve it What I said was the frequent Doubts and Apprehensions you seemed to have about my Love my Honour Kindness  c  were irksome enough and inexcusable because they could answer no End for such Methods as these were the most unlikely Way in the World to cure the Maladies you complain of If I do not love you how will Complaints avail If I do they are an ungrateful Return If I am a Man of Honour your Doubts are ungenerous If I am a Scoundrel such Suspicions and uneasy Altercations but justify my Baseness This all this and more than this have I often said and wrote to you and it is surprising that we should have had for some Time past any Conversation on this Head But as this is the last Time now remember I am bound for my good Pet I shall conclude with observing that GoodHumour and Confidence has preserved more Affections than ever Sense or Contracts could secure  You cannot imagine my dear  Fanny  what Satisfaction I received from the easy reasonable and goodhumoured Manner in which you answered the Letter I hint at and as all the Epocha's of my Life are marked from some  Particular relative to you I may say I begin now to live since I may promise myself to do so without Fear of offending you  Give the inclosed to my Brother I expect to be in  London  on  Thursday  Evening or  Friday  Morning at farthest  I am my dearest  Fanny  your's in Honour Constancy Chearfulness and Goodhumour  LETTER CCLXV  FRANCES  to  HENRY    HOW vastly am I indebted to that Tenderness which even prevents my Desires and gratifies my fondest Wish before it is scarce formed Indeed thou dearest best of Men my Heart is fruitful with a thousand Thoughts of Gratitude and Love to thee Every Moment recalls some Image of thy Kindness to me and fills my Eyes with Tears more pleasing than "the broadest Mirth unfeeling Folly wears"  I felt every Blast of the rude Wind that durst oppose thee and almost envied it the Happiness it was insensible to of kissing thy Lips Let me my dearest Love intreat you by that Regard you have for my Health and Happiness to take Care of that on which they both depend and no longer trifle with the  Pain which your present Disorder gives me Remember I have your Promise to take Emetics if you do not find Benefit from the Rhubarb Indeed if you knew what I suffer from your Illness you would do every Thing in your Power to relieve me  I shall take Care of your dear little Epitome and hope "  Shakespeare  's  Coriolanus    the full Interpretation of Time" will render it worthy of the Commission you have assigned it and give me Leave to say that my sincerest Wish is now and ever shall be to deserve the Compliment you make me  The Painter took away your Picture but it is no Matter since neither Time nor Absence can efface the much more lively and more lovely one that is painted on my Heart  I cannot help repeating my Desire of hearing from you tho' I know it is needless as I am sure my dear  Harry  will do every Thing to alleviate the otherwise insupportable Pains of Absence  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCLXVI  Dear  FANNY  I HAVE set up here at the old Inn though you all say it is a bad one This may be a Reason for new Guests not to come but not for old ones to quit it I always suppose in such Cases that Poverty is the Reason of bad Accommodations and make it a Sort of Charity to support the Indigent and when I eat or lye badly it helps Digestion and softens my Repose to consider that others eat or sleep the better for it I made a vile Breakfast at this Morning from this Turn of Mind though I had forsworn the old House upon my going up to Town last Such Reflections as these my dear  Fanny  are extremely pleasant and their being uncommon is perhaps one of the Reasons I amuse myself with them  I halted here in order to write to instead of paying him a Visit for I do Business better by Proxy than in Person The Reason that I write better than I speak is not as  Dryden  observes upon  Persius  that I have a Difficulty in finding a Meaning but rather as the same Critic remarks upon  Juvenal    car il est bon de se fair valoir  that it is hard to chuse one I have too much Fancy and am  too nice about my Expression to explain myself offhand distinctly and intelligibly Besides the Persons and Objects which strike on my Eyes throw me into a Confusion which hinders my Judgment from having fair Play to exert itself My Ideas resemble a Painter's Pallet where you have great Variety of Colours lying together without Harmony or Order 'till a skilful Pencil has blended them into proper Lights and Shades to compose an agreeable Picture This Difference between my Writing and Speaking must be very obvious to you with whom I have corresponded almost constantly for above five Years past And upon a Review of my Letters lately I do not recollect to have repeated the same Sentiment twice yet I remember to have said the same Words in Conversation to you an hundred times  Every Mile I rode since I left Town my Impatience to see  Belvidere  has increased Perhaps the Affection I have for it being suspended while I was with you the greater Passion absorbing the less was then set at liberty to operate when we parted or perhaps the Thoughts of quitting as is natural in soft Minds have the more attender'd me toward it If I thought there was a Naiad or Dryad in the Place who would lament my Absence I should sacrifice my Interest to my Superstition but my Religion teaching me that whereever we go  our GuardianAngel accompanies us I think I but obey it's Call whenever I change my Situation to my wholesome Advantage  I would have you by all means write to Lady You may also present my  Duty  to her as she is to you a  Mother    Adieu my Life my double Life now  LETTER CCLXVII  I BELIEVE I need not take much Pains to assure my dear  Harry  that nothing but a very severe Illness could have prevented my writing last Post However I hope his own Thoughts furnished him with some other Cause for my Silence and that he had not the least Apprehension of the terrible Situation his poor  Fanny  was in I was seized with a Contraction in my Stomach on  Wednesday  Morning attended with an unusual Pain but as I had Intervals of Ease I hoped it would go off I dressed myself in order to go to but finding myself grow worse every Hour I was at last obliged to send an Apology The Pain threw me into perfect Convulsions and in spite of all the Medicines which were given me I continued on the Rack 'till  Friday  Morning when a violent Emetic gave me Ease I am now free from Pain but so extremely weak that I cannot walk from my  Bed to the DiningRoom without Help Even in those Moments which I thought my last I rejoiced you were not with me as your Sufferings would have added to mine and made them more than I could bear Besides I should not have had any Thing to struggle for had you been present but the earnest Desire I have again to see thee gave me Strength to encounter those Agonies that would have torn me from thee my more than Life I would not let  Tom  write to acquaint you with my Illness lest your Apprehension should suggest something even worse than the Reality  I now congratulate you on my Recovery and shall proceed to thank my sweet  Harry  for both his Letters  There is doubtless something inexpressibly charming in reflecting on those Exercises of Humanity which my dear practic Philosopher is so constantly employed in But with regard to the two recent Instances you mention I cannot help thinking that it is rather doing a general Injury than a particular Charity to support Persons in any Profession which their Want of Capacity Industry or a proper Fund renders them unfit for These Persons so disqualified prevent others who may be capable from engaging in that Business which they do not execute while themselves might become useful Members of Society in another Situation  You may perhaps think this Way of arguing too severe But were we not to regard the general Good more than that of Individuals the Tenderness of our Dispositions might impel us to Acts of the highest Injustice and lead us perhaps to the Rescue of a Murderer if we did not reflect on the salutary Effects which Examples produce in the general Community But while I talk with such seeming Strictness my Heart and Pen disagree and an inward Consciousness of the many Failings I am incident to strongly reminds me of the mutual Claim which every Part of the Creation has to each other's Indulgence and perhaps none has more Need of it than my poor faulty helpless Self  I can very easily account for your being able to write in a more clear and distinct Manner than you speak For besides the Confusion of Ideas which you have found so just and pretty a Resemblance for you have probably more Modesty than any Man who has lived so long and been so conversant with the World as you have and I am sure there are Men who are not possessed of the thousandth Part of your Understanding or Knowledge who could make a better Figure in a general Conversation  Distrustful Sense with modest Caution speaks  While flutt'ring Nonsense in full Vollies breaks  You express much Reluctance at parting with the Child of your Fancy and I will allow your Attachment too to be a reasonable one But like good Reason let it give way to better and remember "Your Home is everywhere" I am perhaps partial to this new Scheme as I first mentioned it for this if for no other Reason you cannot condemn me for desiring it's Success as my utmost Wish has ever been to become in some Shape or other the Means of Good to thee Let me then my sweet Love flatter myself that in this Affair I was the Agent to thy GuardianAngel and pointed out the Road to thy future Advantage But I will not inforce the Subject farther as I am sure you will do every Thing which Sense and Prudence direct  Health Peace and Competence attend my Love  Frances  LETTER CCLXVIII  My Dearest  FANNY  YOU have made but a more cruel Apology for your Silence last Post than that Silence itself You cannot imagine what Anxiety I went through in reading your Letter You indeed  I apprehended was well and safe from your writing but I expected a  Lapsus Linguae  at every Line The Remedy I knew to be pleasant but the Delay of the Cure intolerably tedious I am not so fond of this Life as to desire to renew my Age but I should wish most ardently to revive it in my Posterity  I must insist upon it that 'till I see you again which shall be the sooner for your Compliance with this Request you are in Bed every Night by Eleven o'Clock as much sooner as you please and up at Eight as much earlier as you will and that in every other Particular you will live as we should do together alone at  Belvidere  or whatever Place we may hereafter spend and enjoy our Lives together in  There is something very just in your Remarks upon my partial Humanity But I remember to have observed somewhat to you lately upon this Subject  Beyond the fix'd and settled Rules  Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools  c  This Dispute between us puts me in mind of a parallel Difference between  Swift  and  Pope  in their Letters to each other but tho' we sometimes argue on different Sides of the Question I am satisfied we shall always agree in acting the same Way  I have not mentioned a Word to my own Family of my Correspondence with nor  shall I 'till it is finished I must now shorten my Letter to you that I may have Time to lengthen one to him the Copy of which I design to send you and desire you will return it to me  Your's your's your's  LETTER CCLXIX  AND so Sir your chief Concern was for Bab Indeed Bab's Mam is affronted tho' I may venture to assure you she was more anxious for it than herself I have as little Fondness for Life as most People nor is there  a single Hour o'erpass'd that I could wish should take it's Turn again  Yet I acknowledge the same Desire which you express and I am persuaded feel it infinitely stronger than you can do at present There is the same Kind of Difference in our Attachment to the dear little one as in our Affection for each other You were the first and only Object of my Love For you I felt all the romantic Tenderness of a first Passion while you who had loved much and many were utterly insensible to all the soft Inquietudes the indearing Anguish the heartrending Fears which Providence in Mercy to Mankind decreed should never be refelt  I am to be sent to Bed at Eleven o'Clock and made to get up at Eight for Bab's Sake and these are the Conditions you annex to your Coming Indeed my sweet Love I will comply with them or any other Command of your's not grudgingly nor of Necessity but with the utmost Chearfulness as it shall always be my highest Pride to love honour and obey thee my Guide Guardian Kinsman Father Friend  I should indeed be vastly ashamed of myself did I argue against your Sentiments from my own But as you first enter on those Subjects you leave me only the wrong Side of the Argument which I sometimes take up for the Pleasure of being fully confirmed in the right by you With Regard to the late Matter in Question you may be thoroughly assured that both our Ways of thinking and acting will ever be the same for I hope and believe I have as much Humanity in my Disposition as any Person I ever knew except yourself Did I not love you extremely I should envy your Superiority there and there alone  Rejoice with me I have had two whole Days sacred to Peace and Contemplation But they are over and Noise and Folly reassume their Throne  I have sent you the Answer to the  Essay on Spirit  I know not whom it was wrote by nor do I know what I am now writing for the  Hurricane is begun Oh for a little Nutshell of my own  I rejoice in this fine Weather because you enjoy it though I cannot help lamenting my own Confinement doubly uneasy from the Disagreeableness of my Companion But I will bear it patiently in hopes of happier Days Days spent with thee When oh when will that Time come  Adieu my dearest Life I am and ever shall be your's  Frances  LETTER CCLXX  AND so Madam you are jealous of Bab are you I have known such Instances with regard to dead Rivals but none before of Objects not yet in Being However I shall allow you some Foundation for your Jealousy here for if any Thing ever rivals you it must be some new Perfection of your's for nothing can excel you but what is derived from you  Prior  makes but a lame Compliment to his Mistress "I'll love thee o'er again in Age" for this hints rather a Revival than a Continuance of his Passion But I say I will love thee o'er in Youth which shews a Constancy  of the same Affection And I hope I may conclude with an Allusion to the Lines upon the  Spectator    'Tis the same Sun and does itself succeed  I have not received the Answer to the  Essay on Spirit  which you said you had sent me nor the Copies of my last Letters to I am sincerely concerned for the Bishop for though I think his Sentiments are right yet I must agree with the World that he was wrong in publishing them In his Situation it would have been prudent rather to conform to Rule than submit to Reason and I am afraid that it would have done less Hurt to his Orthodoxy in the Conclave to have made an Essay upon the  Flesh  than the  Spirit    I am my dearest  Fanny  your's alone both in Flesh and Spirit  Henry  LETTER CCLXXI  My Dear  FANNY  I AM here attending the Assizes and enjoyed but one Day at home I must be confined here this Week but depend upon the Alto Relievo of your charming Letters to bear me  thro' it one of which I received Yesterday and expect two more before I return to  Belvidere    I do assure you as a Truth that I have not felt the least Symptom of the Cholic since I left In short there is something extraordinary in my Disorder for surely the Cure of so remarkable a Case could not be so suddenly or so slightly performed for I live as usual except in one Particular that I go to Bed and rise early If this be my Remedy it is a very easy one when absent from you For what Entertainment shall retain me at Board or what Pleasure detain me in Bed when you my Society and Happiness at both are distant from me  I here send you my Answer to 's genteel Letter  The Prologue you sent me is in general very well has a good Turn and Spirit of Poetry in it but there is one vile Line as it has but a simple Meaning in itself and no Sort of Context with the rest  To greet his Shade this grateful Night we give  "A Foe to Folly but the Friend of Man" is an old Line I think it is in  Rochester  's Poem upon  Dorset  's Satires where also is this Line  The best good Man with the worstnatur'd Muse  But somewhere I am sure I have seen it before  Adieu my Masterwork of Art and Nature whom no Satire can invest without nor Adulation can corrupt within Farewell while I do so for our Happiness is one  The Post is come in and no Letter from youUnkind  LETTER CCLXXII  I AM not my dearest  Harry  a sufficient Mistress of Language to express the heartfelt Pleasure which your Letters give me They fill my Mind with such a Kind of Rapture as arises from reflecting on any extraordinary Benefit we have received from Providence It is a Mixture of Praise Gratitude and Love Indeed every Act of Kindness of your's raises me to the best and truest Devotion I admire and bless the Greatness and Goodness of that Almighty Being who formed thee while my Heart overflows with the most thankful Sense of his unmerited Benevolence in being graciously pleased to make thee mine  You say you have enjoyed but one Day at home since we parted and I have been but one Day abroad So we remain equal Debtors to Pleasure if that Term may be justly applied to any Circumstance Time or Place I meet with in your Absence  You have already I hope received my Excuse for not writing by  Thursday  's Post  Unkind  how couldst thou deem me so  I will not because I cannot tell you how sincerely I rejoice at hearing you have got the better of your Cholic I have not had any Return that signifies of my Disorder but am still very lame and suffer much from the Rheumatism  I think your Letter to an excessive clever one It shews at once the Man of Sense and Business but still you say nothing of your own Affairs and seem more inclined to advise than engage with him  I hear Lady is to be in Town in a few Days so think it needless to write I have not any Thing new to acquaint you with Every Thing and Person are just in the same Situation you left them  I will send you the Answer to the  Essay on Spirit  next Post 'till then adieu my Love  Frances  LETTER CCLXXIII  Dear  FANNY  I RECEIVED your Letter and since you are well once more observe that I will never give you  Credit  for being sick again and I hope you will never have Discredit for being irregular to which believe me all your Complaints are owing At the same Time I disclaim any Compassion from you too when I am ill again of my old Disorder for from the Discontinuance of it since I left Town I am convinced that early Hours and supperless Slumbers are the absolute Cure for it As truly as that Vice produces Vice Excesses being of the same Nature beget each other We ought certainly to sit up after Supper then we shall as surely lie abed in the Morning and consequently a late Breakfast falls too suddenly upon Dinner then a slight Repast keeps back the natural Appetite 'till Night when the Irregularity must of course begin again And yet the Cure is easy for but any one Excess in this Rotation being omitted the whole will fall again into it's due Order as by stopping any single Point of a Circle you arrest the whole  Just as I had gone so far a poor Boy begged at my Door in the Stile of a poor Scholar and  modestly asked for nothing but Paper It seems he is orphan'd both of Father and Mother and lives from Cottage to Cottage in the Parish where he was born The Boy had a good honest Look and I took him into  Thompson  's Shop and bound him Apprentice I am pleased with the Thought of what charming Surprize it will be Tomorrow to the whole Parish when they inquire after their Foundling to hear that Providence met him begging in the Way had Charity for him and bound him to a Trade  I am very glad to hear that  our  Lady is coming to Town but would not have you decline writing to her on that Pretence You can say many prettier and genteeler Things in a Letter than you could in Person and Writing such as your's to such Taste and Understanding as her's has confirmed more lasting Friendships than ever Conversation did  I have not hinted any Thing to this House about my Correspondence with nor shall I 'till I see the Event of it If it should not answer your Expectations I will not speak of it at all I would not for fifty Guineas I had not proceeded as far as I did but my failing of Success will not give me one Shilling's Worth of Concern I should be uneasy at having passed over through Neglect or Inadvertency any Opportunity Providence had thrown in my Way but more particularly in this Case as  you were the Index which pointed out the Occasion But I have a Turn of Mind that reconciles me to a Disappointment in any Affair of Life which does not happen through my own Fault  Adieu my Comfort my only Coadjutor to my own Conscience farewell  LETTER CCLXXIV  My Dearest  FANNY  I RETURNED this Day extremely fatigued from the Assizes and having roved through my Gardens and Fields and looked over my Manufactures while it was Light I have but little more Time than to write one Letter more to and to make a Copy of it for you As our Correspondence will be then closed I may expect the Event of it soon which whatever it may be you shall be immediately informed of Perhaps after I have given him the complete Plan of Operation he may indeed proceed upon it like  Hudibras  profiting of  Ralpho  's Gifts but may employ some other Person to execute it for him Why then there is but so much Ink and Paper wasted for Trouble I make no Account of And all I shall regret is the precious Time I have thrown away which might have been  so much more agreeably employed in writing to you which though in Fact I have not neglected yet I have wanted Leisure to exert my Faculties in the Manner I should do to your charming Apprehension  Next  Monday  I go to to settle  your  Affairs in that Province  I am my dearest  Fanny  your faithful Trustee and indefatigable Agent  LETTER CCLXXV  INDEED my sweet  Harry  I am very ill of a violent Cold which I have got without knowing how I have a Cough that would deafen you if you was near me It almost shakes me to Pieces and hinders me from sleeping the whole Night If I am not better I will be bled on  Monday  Take Notice I am neither peevish nor lowspirited and only mention my Illness by way of Conversation  Tho' I am utterly ignorant of every Thing which relates to the Scheme of your Letters to I dare from my own Opinion pronounce it a perfect one for Sense like Truth will strike Conviction on any intelligent Mind without the Help of Demonstration  I am sincerely glad to find you returned to your sweet Retirement May every Pleasure  which Virtue Sense Health and Tranquillity can bestow attend my dearest Life And be assured my dear  Harry  there is nothing in this World can so much alleviate the Pains of Absence and the many other disagreeable Circumstances which attend my present Situation as the Thoughts of your being happy and I solemnly declare I would not for any Consideration be persuaded that you felt as much Concern from our Separation or wished as ardently for me as I do to be with you There is a Kind of romantic Justice in this Sentiment which pleases me and I hope will not offend you for as you have such a vast Superiority over me in every Virtue every Charm the only Preeminence I aspire to is that of loving most Believe me it is a painful one and yet I will not part with it nor bear to be rivalled or outdone in this my single Merit even by thee  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCLXXVI  My Dear  FANNY  I HAVE three of your Letters lying before me now which I had not Time to answer or remark upon before as you know the Hurry and Complication of Business I am engaged in  As to whom you inquire about I have not heard one Syllable since his first and only Letter to me Tho' he said then he was to stay at for a Fortnight which Time was not elapsed before he had my last Letter yet perhaps he did not stay as long as he designed and might have gone home before I had finished my Essay This may account for the Delay of hearing from him Or perhaps he has taken Time to consider and consult some Friends about it But as I said in a former Letter on this Head I was so prepared as not to suffer any Disappointment from the very first of my Application to him so shall trouble myself no more about the Matter unless I hear from him again and then it shall be as a new Affair to me  You have renewed a Subject which we have had frequent Disputes about that my Sense is better than your's but your Love greater than mine Now I shall still argue both these Points with you and the latter I hope I shall make at least doubtful during our Lives If I have a stronger Sense you have a prettier one and if I appear to have any Advantage over you in the Humility of your Opinion only it is more owing to the Fortitude of my Mind than the Excellence of my Understanding As to the second Point it is out of Debate as you seem to have given it up by the first for  a Man must love you in Proportion to his Understanding  I did not mean to scold but warn my Pet when I hinted at Irregularities which I apprehended was the Occasion of the heavy Cold you complained of What I meant was sitting up and lying in Bed late both of which are very bad in a  double  Sense at present But I am quite easy since you have promised to conform to the Rules I shall prescribe to you As you likewise know my Sentiments already I need not repeat them for I have that Confidence in you that you will strictly govern yourself by them Nor need I endeavour to give them Weight by hinting to you that not only your own Health and Spirits but the Health Strength and Happiness of that which may one Day be as dear to you as your own entirely depend upon the prudent Regimen of yourself at this Time I am up every Morning at Five tho' I do not go to Bed 'till Twelve and notwithstanding the Labour of Body and Anxiety of Mind I go through all the Day I feel such Chearfulness and Flow of Spirits about me owing to this alone that I cannot contain myself from singing and dancing about my Fields like one stung by the Tarantula  I am now gone through your three Letters and am sorry they are at an End for like a  Person used to speak from Notes I have nothing more to say but that  I am my charming Girl no less your's than ever and I cannot say more  Henry  LETTER CCLXXVII  WHEN I challenged you upon your talking of Death I did not mean that you spoke of it in such a splenetic Way as betrayed a Fear of dying I was rather apprehensive that you mentioned it in a Manner which shewed no Sort of Concern about the Matter and pardon me my best and latest Hope if this should naturally alarm both my Fears and Jealousy You sometimes unkindly take me to Pieces and I am not Beauty enough to stand such a Scrutiny If you would fairly lump me all together I flatter myself you would have Reason to be better satisfied with me Thought as you say will not enlarge our Size but a very little Reflection is capable of giving us higher Advantages in a better Way than the Stature of  Typhon  could boast  I never speak roughly to you but out of my extreme Tenderness for you and when I said it was in your Power to be a cleverer Person than you were I must have been miserably  misunderstood to have this construed into an Affront As for the Philosophy you seem to reproach me with I do not see how I can ever prove it's Virtue with regard to you for your Behaviour I am certain will never try it's Temper and your Danger would be too strong for it's Resolution  Adieu  my Heart's Life  Henry  LETTER CCLXXVIII  BELIEVE me my everdear my muchloved  Harry  when I tell you that my talking of Death need not alarm your Jealousy for I solemnly declare I find nothing dreadful in the Thoughts of his Approach but the too tender Concern I feel at parting with you If this be a Crime I confess my Guilt But let it be a Consolation to you as well as me that I am not conscious of any other unrepented Sin but find my Soul filled with a stedfast Hope that thro' the Merits of my Redeemer I shall be happy Now let the Resignation with which I bear the present Pains inflicted on me and the Calmness with which I expect those that are to come bear witness to my Love for thee since that alone enables me to support the present and expect the future without even wishing for that  certain Relief which Death affords to human Misery Nay I will go farther yet and say I wish to live from the dear Hope that my Life is and may be of Moment to thy Happiness But in this and every Thing let us endeavour at a perfect Resignation to the Dispensations of the Almighty and say with Truth and Chearfulness his Will not our's be done  Be assured my charming tout en semble you cannot be hurt by what you call  my taking you to Pieces  You are perfect enough to stand a much nicer Scrutiny than I am capable of making But indeed you misapprehend me when you suspect me of intending any such Matter It is more than I can do to defend myself nor had I ever the least Design of finding Fault with you  You sometimes accuse me of Weakness which I am actually guilty of but cannot help I am mortified at your seeming to expect I should be perfect when I set up for nothing more than a mere simple mortal Woman Of course I endeavour to lay the Fault on Nature rather than Will And indeed I am convinced that Constitution has a greater Share in our Virtues and Vices than we are willing to allow and that a strong Frame of Body is a great Help to the Mind We have had frequent Instances of Persons possessed of the greatest Fortitude becoming miserably pusillanimous when the  animal Spirits were oppressed by Pain Age or Sickness The Duke of  Marlborough  in the latter Part of his Life used to cry like a sick Girl if he lost a Game at Picquet and say every one could beat him then  Did this become  Whom Armies follow'd and a People lov'd  Yet sure it would have been the utmost Cruelty to have reproached him for this Weakness or from thence to have thrown any Reflection on that noble spirit he formerly possessed In short my dear  Harry  it is my Opinion that Providence to moderate the Pride of Man has made the Faculties of the Mind depend more on the Formation of the Body than we are aware of at least I am willing to think so as it naturally accounts for my Want of Resolution and Strength of Mind besides an hundred and fifty other Failings I am incident to  Adieu my first my best my only Wish and Hope May you ever retain that Philosophy which I admire not reproach you for and may I never furnish you with Trials which may prove it's Virtue or exhaust it's Strength  I am and ever shall be in Sickness or in Health truly and affectionately your's  Frances  LETTER CCLXXIX  My Dear  HARRY  I THINK your noble Correspondent makes a very paltry Figure in his last Letter I own I had a better Opinion of his Sense and Spirit than to suppose he could be alarmed at finding a Person who possessed these Merits in an higher Degree than himself but I am now convinced that the Superiority you demonstrated is the Reason of his declining any farther Connection with you It is not easy to fall with a good Grace from a Principal to a Second in any Point which we have much at Heart nor can we bear the Person whose superior Excellence makes us appear in an inferior Light even to ourselves  Swift  is the only Author or Person I ever met with who honestly confesses this Foible  Why must I be outdone by  Gay    In my own hum'rous biting Way  Arbuthnot  is no more my Friend  Who dares to Irony pretend  Which I was born to introduce  Refin'd it first and shew'd it's Use  When I plain'd my lonely Situation did I seem to lament the Want of any Friend or Companion but thee Indeed I neither did  nor do for all other Company and Converse are tasteless to me I with I had Religion or Philosophy sufficient to support your Absence with a proper Firmness I will not say Unconcern But to those who truly love believe me  the best Authors  appear but bad Comforters under the Pains of Separation To me they must be rather a Disservice than Help as they would but more strongly remind me of thee thou charming practic Essence of them all However if I live I will fall into whatever Course of reading you think proper as I shall always be pleased with adopting your Sentiments or modelling mine by them as far as my poor little Capacity will admit But let me beg you not to attempt curing me of the Pain which your Absence will ever give me for as nothing but Indifference can render me easy in that Particular be assured it is out of your Power to make me so  Notwithstanding your Situation which I know requires your Presence I very seriously and sincerely wish you here at this and every Moment There is no saying how far the Weakness of my Body affects my Mind Perhaps my being disqualified for every other Pleasure and Satisfaction makes me feel your Loss more strongly Be that as it will I cannot help thinking it a little melancholy to be left in the forlorn unsettled Way I am in my present Condition  How is the Time fixed for your Coming when my falling ill is so uncertain And sure you need not grudge me the Happiness of seeing you a little sooner than perhaps my latest Moment However if it is inconvenient I relinquish your Promise for I shall always prefer your Interest to my Satisfaction nor can I receive any Joy from the Thoughts of your coming with Reluctance to me  Adieu  my Heart's dear  Harry  LETTER CCLXXX  My dear  FANNY  YOUR Observation upon is extremely just and expressed in a very pretty Turn and Manner and tho' I did not flatter myself in the Way you have taken it yet that may rather be his Reason than none at all for as to the Objection he makes with regard to the Expence I think my Letters sufficiently proved that the Expence of my Scheme would be considerably less than his own Plan  Your Remark upon puts me in mind of a Passage of Sir  Francis Bacon  's Treatise upon the Wisdom of the Antients where he labours to give a new Moral to the old Fables of Antiquity  Juno  is said to be woo'd by  Jupiter    in the Form of a Cuckow upon which he makes the following Comment  That Men often impede their own Success by Ostentation of superior Merit and that especially with Persons who have more Arrogance and Pride intimated by the Character of  Juno  than Sense or Merit The surest Way to win their Favour is to appear as mean and humble both in Virtue and outward Appearance as possible  The whole Treatise which I am now quoting from is in my Opinion a very poor Performance and much below so great a Man The Morals drawn from the Tales of the Pantheon are wretchedly forced and many of them improperly adapted His Stile is ordinary and Expressions paltry  My dearest Life you cannot surely think that I would not rather be with you even in Town than from you even here Why then do you seem to upbraid me Oh never never do so again Be assured this once for all and then never let a Doubt or Surmise disturb your Breast that I never stay a Day from you but when it is necessary I should both for your present Security and future Happiness You can surely calculate pretty near the Time you would most particularly desire my Attendance and it will certainly be Time enough for me to go up then If I should go at present perhaps I should  be for many Reasons under a Necessity of leaving you at that Time I should most wish to be with you Thus your own Impatience would disappoint your End I shewed the same Impatience in desiring you to come down but I have been uneasy ever since about it as I am apprehensive the Attempt would be extremely hazardous and the Journey too fatiguing and an unlucky Contretemps might happen in the Country before you could be able to return again I hope this Letter will reach you Time enough to prevent you or rather I hope your Prudence has corrected my Indiscretion already There are many Reasons too against your coming at present which however material in themselves are Considerations too insignificant to mention after the Objection I have made of your Danger  I am indeed I am tout a vous Seul  LETTER CCLXXXI  My Dear  FANNY  AS to the Conversation with I should be much obliged if you would let me know who was the second Person which upon my Honour I shall never mention either to him or the other and this you may be assured of  both upon your Account and mine It may be of Use to me to know his Confident upon this Occasion but only so if I keep my Mind to myself  Such Expressions as he made Use of though the same that you quoted may very well bear a different Sense from what Mistake Prejudice against him or in favour of me might possibly apprehend them in or even supposing them capable of no other Meaning but the unkind one reported to you yet the Illnature of the Tongue does not always proceed from the Malice of the Heart and the unmeaning Purposes of a light Reverie or the vague Folly of an idle Dream may sometimes be mistaken for a deliberate and determined Scheme of Action I have not thank Providence in my own Heart Malice to any Man I have therefore no Jealousy of any Man's evil Designs towards me The few I love I love entirely both with Friendship and Esteem Those whom I merely love not for I hate no one have my general Benevolence and Charity This happy Cast of Mind has enabled me to live hitherto very easily and comfortably both in the World and my own Closet and has turned the Edge of many Mortifications and Disappointments I have met with in my Communication with Mankind which though frequent I may be supposed to be not well qualified to bear with as from the  general favourable Opinion I have of human Nature in Honour to it's Creator the Conviction of Yesterday prepares me not for the Disappointment of Tomorrow My Affections vary but my Friendships never for the first depend upon others but the latter upon myself or rather this rests upon an higher Principle than the slight Basis of human Connections This Principle is not my own it was graciously lent me by Providence who would have unkindly given me Life without it I will spend it here with pious Use and pay it back with grateful Tribute And the Lord incline our Hearts to keep this Law  LETTER CCLXXXII  NEED I tell my dearest Life with what unfeigned Pleasure I should accept his Invitation were it in my Power to undertake such a Journey without the immediate Hazard of my own Life and one far dearer to me Surely my dear  Harry  has forgot my being forbid to go even three Miles at a Time in an HackneyCoach The least Exercise fills me with such violent Pains as almost distract me I have not been able to turn myself in Bed without the utmost Difficulty these ten Days and have been obliged to take Opiates to make  me sleep for several Nights past The Want of my Rest has reduced me to the lowest Degree of Weakness imaginable Besides those who know more of the Matter than I think I shall not hold up above three Weeks at farthest But why do I go on assigning Reasons for declining what would afford me the highest Transport when my not accepting it too fully proves my Want of Power not Will I cannot help thinking I have suffered infinitely more than the generality of People in my Condition Be that as it will I know my Strength and Spirits are quite exhausted and I am more than half persuaded that we shall never meet again on Earth in Heaven I am sure we shall for in thy Sight alone I can be blest Something too much of this  There is an extreme pretty Poem come out called  Elfrida  If you will allow yourself an Hour's Leisure to read it I will send it to you I have received much melancholy Pleasure from it  Your Picture is come home and is almost my only Companion I talk to it frequently but alas it does not answer I find myself disappointed and turn from it to your Letters They indeed afford me a more sensible Satisfaction they tell me of your Health your Love and Constancy Thus do I divide my Time as it were between the Shade and Substance  I begin to regret my not having had  my Picture  some Months ago for though I do not wish you should lament me if I die I do not wish you should entirely forget me and  that  would just furnish a bare Remembrance unattended with Pain or Pleasure  I am my dearest  Harry  very faithfully and affectionately your's  Frances  LETTER CCLXXXIII  Dear  HARRY  AS I was sitting down to write about three Hours ago I was taken so ill I feared I should not be able to hold the Pen this Day I have got a little Ease and shall employ the happy Interval in acknowledging your Letters I have already declared my Incapacity of accepting the Pleasure you designed me I am glad to find your mature Consideration approves my pleaded Reason I shall say no more on the Subject but that I am in a very disagreeable Way oppressed with continual Pains Weakness and low Spirits  As to your coming to me take my Word I was never more in earnest than when I desired you to consult your own Interest rather than  my Inclination nor did I mean to upbraid your Want of Tenderness when I supposed you might not come I do not indeed I do not doubt your Love  My Mind nor pines with sickly Jealousy  Nor triumphs in Security and Ease  Who loves must fear and sure who loves like me  Must greatly fear  I have taken much Pains to render Life indifferent to me I have accomplished it I neither wish to live or die If I were thoroughly persuaded I should not recover I would insist on your not coming near me for I am convinced there is a vast Difference in the Sensations which arise from being present or absent at the Death of any one we love But as I cannot be certain in this Point I leave the Matter entirely to your Discretion and be assured I will not be offended if you should determine on staying where you are  Adieu  LETTER CCLXXXIV  My Dear  FANNY  AS you have condescended to be my Pupil I shall recommend the Course of Reading I should chuse for you and to lead the Way have here sent you one of my former Letters  to you upon this Subject I beg you will seriously consider how strongly I have there recommended those Tracts referred to with other Writings of this Kind and that you will carefully and leisurely read them regularly thro' with that sober Sense and rational Reflection which is necessary to give you the full Benefit of such a Study For as  Young  says  Unless for some peculiar End design'd  Learning's the specious Trifling of the Mind  To settle the Course of Study is but half the Work the Method of reading is what completes the Scheme He who reads most studies least For it is with the Mind as with the Stomach where not the Food it swallows but the Digestion it performs turns that to Nourishment which would otherwise be a Poison Therefore I would recommend it to you never to take a Book in one Hand without a Pen in the other And I expect your sesinble Remarks and philosophical Reflections of which indeed you are very capable upon every one of the Papers I have quoted for you in the inclosed Letter and by the Time you have gone regularly thro' them I hope to point out something farther for you in our mutually desired Conversation together  You talk in a splenetic Way in your Letter of dying  c  Now I will not scold you again  for the hundredth Time because I am very sure if you could avoid it you would when you know how often it has disobliged and displeased me I am indeed sincerely concerned at your ill State of Health at present and as much so that you will not exert that Strength of Mind which you may find yourself Mistress of if you will but take a little Pains to try Indeed my dear  Fanny  you are capable of being a cleverer Creature than you sometimes appear to be and I own it vexes me when I see you at any Time fall below your own Sense and Virtue which I am always rouzing you to as there needs nothing more to make you perfect  I am sorry but not angry I am remonstrating not scolding  Adieu  my spoiled Pet  LETTER CCLXXXV  My Dear  FANNY  I AM sincerely concerned at the bad State of Health you are in at present But have a good Heart my own dear Pet for you will be much better of the  next  so let not this discourage you  I am extremely well pleased to find you are at your Aunt's now but am afraid of the  Disturbance you apprehended from the Trade carried on in the BackYard I beg to know immediately how you like your Situation in every Particular and every Instance of Kindness or Goodnature you meet with from any of your Friends who are therefore more mine shall be ever acknowledged by me with more than Thanks If I have a Thought but what tends to my dear  Fanny  's Happiness to her proper and honourable Establishment in Life may I be as much disappointed in the faithless Wish as I am certain I should be in the worthless Experiment  Adieu my dear charming Fugitive Oh when may my Doors as well as my Arms be open to receive thee thou most welcome and muchdesired Guest  Farewell 'till then thy impatient Exile  LETTER CCLXXXVI  I AM sincerely pleased at finding my dear  Harry  in such a chearful Mood tho' what you jest with like the Fable of the Boys and Frogs has been almost Death to me nor am I able to enjoy the little Relaxation from Pain which I am at present blessed with from the dreadful Certainty of what I have yet to undergo  It was indeed very lucky for me that I got to my Aunt's She has behaved with great Care and Tenderness the Want of which must have added greatly to my Sufferings if not immediately endangered mine and the poor Bab's Life As to the Noise I must compound for it and endeavour to bear with one Inconvenience where there are so many Conveniencies  I cannot help telling you that I think our Friends in have behaved very ill to you I had no Claim to their Friendship or Regard but I think they should have rejoiced in any Opportunity of shewing their Gratitude and Affection to so near a Relation and kind a Benefactor The Particulars of their Conduct I refer to our Meeting which I hope and believe will be soon Observe that I have never seemed to take the least Notice of their Behaviour nor shewn any kind of Picque or Resentment at it By this you may perceive your Example has not been thrown away I strive to copy it though convinced I shall never in any Thing arrive at the same Degree of Perfection and I assure you I scarce engage in the most trifling Action without asking myself would my  Harry  if present approve my doing so or how would he act in the same Circumstances So really anxious am I to become thy Epitome  I hope I shall keep up a little longer to gather Strength and Spirits for the approaching  Aera and that Bab and I may live to thank you for the kind Assurances of your present and future Regard  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCLXXXVII  My Dear  FANNY  I HAVE this Day begun my great Buildings  c  The Boldness of my Undertakings with the amazing Success of my Atchievements surprizes even myself but is a Matter of miraculous Wonder to the rest of the World Yet it is impossible to conceive without having tried how much may be compassed by the Help of a little Thought Spirit and Perseverance referring the Success ultimately to Providence which has hitherto in a good Hour be it spoken favourably attended every one of my bold and desperate Undertakings So prosper me still as I mean Honour to you my truest Love and to your Children for whom I begin already to feel a Father's Fondness say rather a Grandfather's for I have always behaved to you as to a favourite Child cherishing you for your own Advantage and thwarting you only for your Good  The Compliment you make of setting me for your Example is higher than my Merits You need no better Pattern than the fair Exemplar in your own Mind whenever you are pleased to reflect your own Thoughts upon it and for this Purpose if you consider me as your Monitor only it will be the highest Favour I shall pretend to  Adieu  my sweet Pupil  LETTER CCLXXXVIII  I DID not receive your's of the th 'till a few Hours ago This Delay joined to your late Silence threw me into a Situation very little short of Distraction I have not slept two Hours at a Time since  Thursday  and have almost blinded myself with crying As you have been always so exactly punctual in writing I must say it was unkind to miss a Post at this particular Time My Spirits weakened and worn out by bodily Pain sunk under the most dismal Apprehensions I imagined you had met with some dreadful Accident or at best concluded that your Uncle had intercepted my Letters Heaven be praised my Fears were groundless But let me intreat you my dear  Harry  to write constantly for the future though your Leisure should afford but a single Line I know you  think it extremely silly to be uneasy on such Occasions but indeed I cannot help it and must therefore beg your Indulgence to this particular Weakness  As I am sure all your Undertakings are founded on Reason and Virtue it would be arraigning Providence to doubt their Success May he ever bless prosper and preserve my Love and then tho' he afflict me I shall not complain  I am not offended at your making so light of my present Sufferings  Thou canst not speak of what thou dost not feel  But I am affronted you take no Notice of my favourite  Elfrida  If you do not like it let me beg you not to tell me so for I am vain enough to fancy there is a strong Parity between her Sentiments and mine  Adieu  my dearest Life  Frances  LETTER CCLXXXIX  My Dear  FANNY  INCLOSE you this Paper because it relates to the Subject of one of my late Letters about Reading I send it to you more for your Amusement than Instruction as you need no Hint of this Kind Nor indeed do I think  Reading itself any otherwise necessary to my charming Philosopher than to direct or adapt your Thoughts to proper Studies for an Ant or a Straw which gave you Occasion to exercise your own Reflections would answer the End as well Give but fair Play to the ingenuous Nature inhabiting thy Breast my proudest Mansion and all human Learning were superfluous to thee Happy for Mankind if Arts and Sciences were merely so As all States thrive best upon their proper Forces so these like Auxiliaries tho' called in as Friends often remain as Tyrants  I am well Amen to you  Fielding  in the second Page of this Paper has rendered the  decens  of  Horace  too literally In the Original it comprehends all the higher Morals but in the Translation it means no more than what the  French  stile Les petites Morales  LETTER CCXC  THOUGH you caution me about speaking my Opinion freely about  Elfrida  I must not be confined or restrained by any Thing but my own Judgment as far as that will go  The Author's prefatory Letters shew him to be a better Critic than his Work shews him  to be a Poet There are some pretty Turns which any one who  imitates  may write But the Soul of Poetry is wanting which I am certain of from my not  feeling  through the whole and a Work must be very slight and insipid which amuses only the Fancy without affecting the Heart I will not allow any Thing to make us  wiser  which does not make us better and the cold inanimate Contemplation of moral Beauty is not sufficient for this He who said Virtue need but be seen to be adored expressed himself but faintly I say she must be felt  But to return  Orgar  is a vile unnatural Brute who would prostitute his Daughter to the Honour of being a King's Mistress  Athelwold  is but a poor Character thro' the whole and as to  Elfrida  I will not compliment her so much to say there is any Parity between your Sentiments and her's She seems in her first Speech to be picqued in Pride that she is not more publickly manifested to the World talks high of  Orgar  's Daughter Courts  c  I think her rather like  Semele  than you and that impatient Temper of her's jealous of his Love in Absence and not without Murmur submitting to the Prudence of concealing their Marriage perhaps drew upon her that Judgment of Providence which destroyed her Husband and rendered her miserable I think the Stile very  indifferent and in some Places mean and absurd One or two of the Heroes I think says '  Sdeath  which is not a Word in the  English  Dictionary  Adieu my dear Pet May you never have  Elfrida  's Fate though I would rather you had that than  Semele  's  I met Yesterday with  Bolingbroke  's Letters upon the Method and Use of reading History  c  I have gone through but the two first Letters I like them extremely but dare not say they are sensible and clever because I have several times spoke and wrote to you upon this Subject and have often inculcated that we misapply our StudyLeisure extremely who read for mere Amusement or even Theory Contemplation Such Persons may be said to study as the College Lad expressed himself by an happy Blunder  I read six Hours a Day and no one is the wiser  I think such a Man may as well be asleep for he can only be said to have pleasant Dreams who reads any Thing but with a View of improving his Morals or regulating his Conduct I mean Men who are happy enough to be under no Necessity of reading but for themselves for Arts and Sciences must be studied by some People for the useful Purposes of Life  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCXCI  My Pet  I DO not remember what I said in the Letter which inclosed you  Fielding  's Essay but am certain from the Tenor of my Opinion of you that I did not mean to reprimand you for the Misapplication of your Time in reading Books of Amusement only When I speak of Sense Honour or Virtue you ought to understand it as a Compliment a just one to you not meant to upbraid you for the Want of these Excellencies Why am I eternally mistaken  You say that the present Uneasiness of your Mind calls for Amusement I should think that Amusements were fitter for a Mind at Ease Irksome Thoughts are not to be relieved by Trifles and it requires high Studies and deep Reflections to divert us from present Ills or melancholy Prospects But let Amusement be the Word Will not  Shakespeare  's Plays amuse you better than  Durfey  's and would you not find better Entertainment in the  Spectator  than the  Rambler  No BoardingSchool Girl reads more for Amusement than I do I would have you do so too For I know very well that Sense Philosophy and Virtue will make any Reading an higher Entertainment to you and  that you are capable of receiving Pleasure or Amusement from many Writings which are capable of instructing half the World This was what I meant to hint to you by any of my Letters on this Subject that the  utile  was not inconsistent with the  dulce  as I was too anxious for even your Amusements to leave them to Chance or Carelessness for the Hap I recommended some Papers to you lately which I flattered myself would have highly amused you as I am sure the Comments I expected from you upon them would have greatly entertained me But I will not presume to set you Tasks Your own good Sense be your Guide  I am sincerely concerned to find you still in that plaintive Mood of  Misfortunes Anxiety of Mind  c  I hope and believe that you are not in any Circumstance of Life which can provoke such melancholy Reflections In short I have observed that there is a great deal of Sense and Virtue with some Smattering of Philosophy in the World but that great noble and comprehensive Quality called Fortitude seems to have quite forsaken Mankind and  Scarron  might well say if in Truth he could even say so much  None but myself could e'er that Pitch attain  To sport with Misery and jest in Pain  May Heaven most earnestly solicited by my Prayers defend my dearest amiable Love from both and from every Evil natural and moral except the Penalties which she deserves herself and then surely her Happiness here will be an Earnest of that Bliss which perfect Spirits enjoy hereafter Amen to that sweet Prayer  Sir  Francis Bacon  has a fine Passage which may be quoted here as a noble Definition of that Constancy and Fortitude of Mind which I am lamenting  prepared for every Event armed in all Fortunes foreseeing without Fear enjoying without Satiety and suffering without Impatience  This great Character is in the Power of so small a Portion of Sense and Virtue to attain to that for my Part I am resolved to commence Hero from the Date of this Letter  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCXCII  My Dearest  FANNY  TUESDAY  's Post did not bring me any Letter from you In your present Situation you may judge how uneasy I must be upon such an Occasion Accordingly I sat down to scold or complain which are synonymous Terms  But stay says I Before my Letter need go another Post may come in and many Accidents may have prevented her writing or made the Letter miscarry without her Illness or Neglect Thus my Pet do I always deal with you and would sooner suspect Improbabilities or even my own Senses than your Truth and should in like Circumstances behave with regard to you like that noble  Venetian  who seeing a Lookingglass make some Reflections on his Wife broke it with his Cane crying out "Thou lyest"  Farewell my dearest Life I am not less your's than ever and need no more to assure you I am totally and for ever your's  Henry  LETTER CCXCIII  I HAD the provoking Pleasure of receiving two Letters from my dear  Harry  by Yesterday's Post Tho' they were of different Dates the PostMark was the same on both so that these teizing Delays must be owing to the Person you send with your Letters  We do indeed too often misapprehend each other I make no Doubt but the Fault lies chiefly on my Side for I am conscious I have too much Quickness in my Disposition which  joined to the earnest Desire I have to render myself agreeable to you puts me on endeavouring to justify or explain away my Faults perhaps with too much Warmth It is long since I have agreed with my dear Preceptor in owning that Trifles will not even for the present Moment amuse a rational Mind There is a Kind of Selfcontempt inseparable from the misspending our Time in Pursuit of any Thing which does not tend to make us wiser or better and of course happier But this Feeling is I believe only known to intelligent Minds tho' I have heard People complain of throwing away their Time on a Book that did not please them who were utterly incapable of making any Reflection or forming any Sentiment from  Milton Shakespeare  or  Addison    It is indeed as my sweet Love observes not in the Power of Trifles to relieve or calm the Sorrows of the Mind or divert the Thoughts from bodily Pain It is only in the Power of Religion Philosophy and Sense to aid us in surmounting present Ills by teaching us to look forward to an happy Futurity  As I had entered into a regular Course of reading the  Spectators  I have not yet gone thro' the particular Set of Papers you recommended I think it is impossible you should doubt my being really charmed with those I have met But alas what Comment could you expect  from me on Subjects where the little Understanding I am Mistress of may be compared to an Infant just weaned from LeadingStrings afraid to make a Step without a Guide  I never did set up for the least Degree of Fortitude My Sensations are much too lively for a Stoic A decent Resignation to the Will of the Supreme Being is the utmost I aspire to Nor do I look upon it that my complaining to you can be deemed a Breach of Duty in this Point You are so much myself and every Faculty of my Soul is so much devoted to you that I can scarce call them mine You have my Thoughts all wild and uncorrected Tho' you may not approve them you should pardon while you endeavour to reform them as you do those faulty ones that rise involuntarily in your own Heart  For where's the Palace whereinto foul Things intrude not  My Heart's dear  Harry  must give me Leave to assure him I am sincerely grateful for that elegant and affecting Solicitude he expresses for my Happiness of which he is and I hope ever will be the first and only Agent in the Hand of Heaven May it reward and bless him for the Kindness and return those Wishes which he makes for me to him an hundredfold  You do me but strict Justice when you believe that nothing but  extreme Illness  or some very extraordinary Accident could prevent  my writing Your not hearing from me by  Saturday  's Post was owing to the  first  I was the whole Day in racking Pain and could not rest three Minutes in any Place therefore as I had no Letter from you to answer I thought it cruel to make you uneasy with my Pains  Tho' I am transported at the Thoughts of seeing my dearest  Harry  I would by no means desire you to come unless you can do it with Convenience to yourself for I would have you leave all your Cares behind when your dear Presence is to banish mine But in this and every Thing I submit myself to your Discretion and your Love  Adieu my dearest Life May it be as consistent with your Business as I am sure it is with your Inclinations soon to see your fond and faithful  Fanny  LETTER CCXCIV  My Dear  FANNY  I WRITE this from my new Farm which I might stile the Paraclete for there are "white Walls and silver Springs" enough to intitle it to that Appellation though there are better Reasons for it So romantic a Place never  was if Wildness Solitariness with the Print of  Astraea  's last Footsteps in the Situation and Love and Constancy in the Proprietor be the distinguishing Marks of that Character  There is something amuses and pleases me extremely in this Chain of Thought that Providence seems to have marked out this Spot of Earth for your's by a Train of unforeseen Accidents I had taken the Land at a Time when you and I were upon such Terms that it it was highly probable we should never be again reconciled You had good Reasons to be highly picqued at my Behaviour and your Prudence your Pride and Honour was a just Bar to a Reunion At that Time perhaps all Libertine as I was with many Schemes in Imagination and many Views in Prospect I might have had some Consolation in the Loss of a Woman whom my Passion loved and my Reason esteemed in the Thought of being in some Sort eased from that Restraint which my Regard to your Worth with my natural Sentiments of Generosity and Honour never yet thank God extinguished in me must have laid me underat such a Time I say we met by Chance When speaking of this extraordinary bold and enterprizing Purchase of mine engaging for six hundred Acres of Land at a desperate Rent at a hazardous Crisis and in a dangerous Country which required a large  Fund to improve when I was above two thousand Pounds in Debt and had neither Money Credit nor Stock to apply upon describing the Situation of the Place you desired I would name it adding that it was probably the only Compliment you might ever desire from me Some time after this you and I projected a Plan of Paraclete which I have this Day by an accidental Turn of Thought adapted to this Place You may remember last Winter that  c c  and when I was to look out for a Nurse and Accommodation for your sweet anteloved Babe I was from some prior Reasons directed to this particular Place for both  Let me indulge myself farther in the Contemplation of this Scheme of Providence with regard to you and me You chose and approved of me when you had before you as  Milton  says  The World to chuse and Providence your Guide  Sense Wit and Reading were from my earliest Years the Objects of my implicit Adoration and whenever I changed my Passion it was in Search of a fit Subject for my Admiration I at length possessed unknowing these rare Qualities in you and was in Danger  like the base  Indian  to throw a Pearl away richer  than all my Tribe  But as my Reason improved by your charming Converse more than my own Reflection I found acknowledged and incased the Gem thou  one entire and perfect Chrysolite  and hope never to exchange thee but for a better World than this made more eminently so by a nobler and higher Converse there with thee thou amiable Cherubim and Seraphim in one in whom are so perfectly joined their two distinguishing Characteristics Love and Knowledge the pleasing Hope of which Enjoyment above will be a stronger Incitement to my Virtue here below In short I do not know two Persons alive who seem more adapted by Nature for each other Excuse this Vanity in me when your Approbation has already made my Panegyric My Calmness and Philosophy is fit to temper the Misfortunes and Disappointments of Life and your Wit and Spirit proper to season and enliven the Ease or Pleasures of it  Dull tasteless all if unenjoy'd by thee  Farewell thou best Subject of my best Comments  Henry  LETTER CCXCV  My Dear  FANNY  I DRANK hard at and it is now too late to reach home However I might get as far as with Ease but have stopped short here that I might be at Liberty to think of and write to you more agreeable to me than any Company or Converse I can meet with in this World while my Back is turned to you  I received a very pretty Letter from you last Post a very generous and a kind one too The fatal Necessity of my too long Absence from you is sufficiently irksome in itself and the sensible Light in which you apprehend it and the rational Manner you speak of it in saves me that additional Weight of Anxiety which would be intolerable You can always command Sense and Reason enough when you are Mistress of yourself and in Obedience to them let me be proud to own myself your Vassal too  The Comments I expect from you upon those Writings and others of the same Class which I have recommended to you are best shewn in your Life by Chearfulness and Content the first manifested in Philosophy and the latter in Resignation Whenever I sit down to  read any Writings of this Kind I first suppose myself in order to try their Power labouring under all the Ills of Sickness Sorrow Poverty and Oppression When in a short Time all these gloomy Cares are dispelled like Mists before the enlivening Sunbeams and I look back first with Triumph and Contempt upon those fleeting Shadows which are now posting so far behind me and then look forward with Gratitude and Joy to that glorious Prospect wideopening before me In short there is but one Misfortune in Life which I think could prove too hard for such Reflections as these to support me through I mean the Loss of thee of thee my only Gain And I am very certain that nothing could prevent me from following you precipitately but the Fear by that rash Action of losing you for ever  Among the Papers which I design to collect in my  Solamen miseris  I would insert the Hymn to Contentment and Nightpiece on Death of  Parnell  's I happened to read them both this Morning at  Kitty  's and if it would not appear too much Vanity I would add some of my Letters to you where I speak of the Providence and Mercy of God and the Immortality of the Soul which as they are my own Reflections might have a better Effect on myself at least than better Writings on the same Subjects A Collection of Essays intitled  Spectacle de la  Nature  occurs to me here as they give you a general and comprehensive View of natural Philosophy which is such a Manifestation of a God infinitely wise powerful and good as away all impious Thoughts almost renders particular Revelation superfluous at least to contemplative Minds There are also many Passages in these Writings especially two Letters from the Prior to the Chevalier which are masterly in their Kind that are admirable to abate the Selfsufficiency of Man's Pride and to humble all human Presumption to a religious and implicit Obedience and Submission to the infinitely great Dispensations of Providence before whose Throne let us both kneel with a pious and virtuous Devotion not with an enthusiastic or fanatic Zeal and from whose Grace may we both receive such Reward as shall merit our just and honest Inclinations and Actions toward each other So concluding with  Othello  Amen I say to that sweet Prayer  Henry  P S is in this House offered me his Company and  stranges  much as the Waiter phrases it why I should chuse to be alone I am not alone  Have I not seen her where she has not been  LETTER CCXCVI  My Dear  FANNY  YOU cannot imagine with what Anxiety I wait for every Post at present to hear a favourable Account of your safe Delivery I own my Concern is double at this Time but double for you alone and had I the Universe to leave an Inheritance I would rather make Hospitals my Heirs than have you forfeit your Life or Health to give me one  In Sorrow shalt thou bring forth  was the original Curse What Labour would it have saved your whole Sex if my charming Girl had been our first Mother  The Delays in the Posts which you complain of are owing to this That for some Time past they have gone later out than usual so that I had Time to write my Letters in the Morning and send soon enough But now I find they have recovered their former Diligence which I was not aware of 'till Yesterday Morning I will take Care that you shall meet with no more Disappointments  I have met with a Book lately which I never heard of before and that pleases me extremely It is stiled  Microcosmography  or the Characters of Mankind It was wrote by Bishop  Earle    who was some time Preceptor to  Charles  the Second Most of the Characters are very well drawn and the whole is wrote with a good deal of Wit and shews a thorough Knowledge of the World both the speculative and busy Parts of it There are some flat Endeavours at Point and Turn with several Passages unintelligible to a modern Reader But as the whole is worth Perusal I design it for your Library I shall send it up along with the Hams  c  which I design for Bab's first Carnival and if it will give me Leave to do the Honours of the Entertainment I shall certainly be there at your appointed Time  Adieu my  Life  for 'till we meet I may be said to have taken my Leave of  it    LETTER CCXCVII  IN the first Place how is my sweet Love and well and how is Bab and what Sort of a Bab is it Has it a broad goodhumoured Countenance like Dad or a lively Eye double Chin and saucy Look like Mam Is it most a Wit or a Philosopher Does it incline rather to Poetry or Metaphysics Is it compounded of the two heavy Elements of Earth and Water or the two light ones of Air and Fire In short tell me every Thing about it what it says  and what it does and whether it has ever yet discovered any Ear for Music what Sounds affect it most and whether it's Eyes sparkle at the gay Colours or it's Brows knit into Contemplation at the grave ones I am in very chearful Spirits upon this happy Occasion and am exerting all my Wit to be a very great Fool about our sweet Infant  I thank God with a grateful Heart for your safe Delivery and do unfeignedly think that among the many remarkable Favours I have at several Times received from the Hands of Providence or can ever yet receive you were it's best and most valuable Gift for you are not only to me a Blessing in yourself but like Health give me a Relish for all the other Goods of Fortune or Advantages of Life  Farewell  my Heart's only Life  Henry  LETTER CCXCVIII  My Dear  FANNY  I AM at present employed more agreeably than I can be otherwise in this Town writing to you and waiting the Arrival of the Post to hear from you  I am obliged to your Secretaries but they must accept my Answers to you for I am at you alone  Kitty  gives a promising Account of our  Iülus  And that he does not suck surprizes me not for  our  Child could not possibly do any Thing like another Child If he was reared entirely by the Spoon perhaps it would not be amiss that he might imbibe no Humours but what he brought into the World with him and that he may say with  Richard  the Third "I am myself alone" Our's is so perfect an  Englishman  on both Sides that he has refused the  Irish  Teat because it would not have the Brogue on it's Tongue If he is to be stiled  Pliny  let it be the Younger for I would rather have him endowed with that Goodness and Benevolence of Heart which was his Characteristic than all the Learning and Philosophy of the Uncle  I have been shifting all I can settle my Affairs so as to make my Journey to through convenient at this Time but whether I can do that or no be assured I will see my sweet Boy christianized though I go up in one Stage to return in the next You shall hear more from me next Post on this Head I have sent up a fine Ham and a Head by a Carrier directed to my Brother  I am so charmed at the proper becoming Sense and Reasonableness of your not pressing  me to go up before nor calling upon me since on the just Assurance that my own Inclinations would induce me to it as soon as possible that I am therefore resolved to go Coute qui Coute tho' I had not determined on it before  Adieu my Heart's Delight and my Mind's Comfort  Henry  LETTER CCXCIX  I WAITED in vain last Post in for a Letter from one of your Secretaries Now may  Kitty  's Days be ever Nights and in those Nights when she stretches forth her Arms for Joy may she be disappointed as I was when the Post came in Let her like me be  mad with the Idea and grasp the Wind  I have not half done my Prayer but have stopped short hoping this Post which I have just sent to may make me some Amends for the Disappointment of the last  The Post is just come in and has answered my Wish of a Letter from yourself But I am extremely alarmed at the unfavourable Account you give of yourself and Bab and this very unnatural Weather happens unlucky for you both  I answered you already about Bab's Name which I shall leave entirely to you I hope your next Letter will contain a better Account of yourself and poor little  ourself  than your former I would not have the Christening delayed on my Account and I am sure I need not give your Sense and Prudence a Caution to have it as private as possible that both the Expence and Report of it may be as small as can be The Ease and Happiness of our  three  Lives depends upon a proper Discretion about these two Articles Your Happiness depends upon my Welfare my Welfare upon your Conduct and  our little Self  rest upon both Now as you are the first moving Principle in this Chain of Causes and Effects I am perfectly easy tho' the Consequences are so choice and estimable  Adieu  my Love  Henry  LETTER CCC  I DECLARE myself a Convert to  Fitzosborne  's Opinion and  no longer doubt of the salutary Effects which are said to have been produced by Words  I am become a recent Instance of their Power for my dear  Harry  's kind Letter has wrought a greater Change in  my Health and Spirits than could have been effected in the Time by the whole  Materia medica  In the Name of our dear little Bab I return his Duty and Thanks for the Kindness you express towards him I hope he will live to make his being mine his smallest Merit to your Tenderness Though I receive a very exquisite Pleasure from seeing him I cannot help grudging it to myself as I should any other unshared by thee and wishing he were placed within your View though I should by that Means be debarred of the only Joy I am capable of tasting in your Absence Any Increase of my Fondness for your dear little Epitome must be superfluous and indeed I know nothing that could add to it but seeing him become as much the Object of your Tenderness as he is of mine I flatter myself with thinking the happy Time will come when it shall be doubtful which of us loves him best  As I am still very weak and have not made the least Progress in recovering my Appetite I should be very glad to get into the Air for a little Time But I wait your Orders to dispose of myself in the Country or wherever else you please All Places are alike to me I must live somewhere and I think my having a Lodging out of Town for a few Weeks could make but a small Difference in my Expences But let this be or not as you think best  Adieu thou dear Dispenser of my present Happiness and only wished Addition to my Hopes of future Bliss  Frances  LETTER CCCI  My Dearest  FANNY  YOU know I was lately angry And I am so ashamed of it that I have been recollecting what my Reading or own Reflections can suggest first to palliate the Offence for what is past and to prevent for the future the ill Effects of a Vice and Weakness which I think even I have Sense and Virtue enough to guard myself from  The best Hints which I shall offer here are taken from an Essay upon this very Subject of Anger wrote by Lord  Verulam    To extinguish this Passion entirely is but a Bravery of the Stoics For like all ill Habits we must cure ourselves by Degrees as a skilful Rider manages an headstrong Horse guides his Steps in the safest Course and pulls and relaxes the Rein by Turns The Reason that so few People reclaim themselves from bad Affections is owing more to Want of Judgment than Virtue We grow careless upon finding the  Imperfections of human Nature not easily conquered by the Perfection of Philosophy not being aware that Habit must be overcome by Habit as Regimen cures chronical Distempers better than Medicines Intermissions are as necessary in Ethics as in Physic The Scriptures which are better Guides in Morals than the whole Body of Philosophers give some Indulgence to human Frailty in this Particular "Be ye angry but sin not" And in another Place  Let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath  which seems to declare that the Continuance of Anger not the first Start of it makes the Vice  Bacon  says the best Way to cure the natural Inclination or Habit of Resentment is to reflect upon the Effects of Anger "how it troubles a Man's Life" and the best Time to do this is to look back upon Anger when the Fit is over  Seneca  says well that  Anger is like a Ruin which breaks itself upon that it falls  Socrates  being asked what a Man was doing who was seen in the Street chafing himself in a Rage answered justly  he is punishing an angry Man  The Scripture exhorts us to possess our Souls in Patience then whoever is out of Patience is out of Possession of his Soul A passionate Man may be compared to a Bee according to  Virgil  's Expression that when they sting they lose their Spirit in the Wound Perhaps this may leave an Open  to Sarcasm to compare a calm Man to a Drone  Bacon  says it ought to make Men ashamed of Anger the Consideration of those Persons who are most subject to it Children Women old People and sick Folks Men should carry their Resentment rather with Scorn than Passion especially where our Pride is picqued for that same Pride should rather shew us above than below an Injury or Affront Many other Arguments drawn from Prudence Morality and Religion occur to me at present but I am sure there are none of them necessary to inform your Sense and Understanding and all I mean by this Essay is to furnish you with a few Hints to be offered to my own Consideration whenever you find me relapsing into that Weakness which you may remember in a former Letter some Time ago I mentioned as the only Thing which now and then gets the better of the Tenor of my Philosophy  Adieu my fairest Guide I assure you that I fly to your Arms with all the Impatience of an angry Man and with all that Goodnature and Affection which passionate Persons are remarkable for  Athenodorus  LETTER CCCII  Dear  FANNY  I ARRIVED here last Night much fatigued by the Warmth of the Weather I hope my Pet is well and my Pet's Pet My Blessing to the little Fellow  I perceived my Heart growing warm at the Approach to a Place where I had twenty Years ago spent so many chearful boyish Days Somewhat like the Emotion we feel upon meeting an old Schoolfellow whether it be one we have a particular Attachment to or no for I am not speaking here of a rational Affection but such a Prejudice and Partiality as is contracted from early Habit and Custom before we have the free Exercise of our Understandings The Love of our Country may be ranked under this Head by which I do not mean that Patriotism which is but universal Benevolence poorly bounded by a Province or Kingdom but that superstitious Attachment Men have even to the very Soil they were born in I fancy that departed Spirits even in Bliss look sometimes back upon this World with a Regard like this though without any Desire of exchanging Situations I speak this upon a Presumption that we carry our Consciousness with us to the  next World which I look upon to be a Thing so far from requiring Proof that to assert the contrary is arguing God to be partial or unjust Should you be rendered a blessed Spirit for your Virtues or I an unhappy one for my Vices you might indeed be said to be happy and I miserable but neither of us could be said to be rewarded or punished without a Consciousness of our being the Persons who in the other Life had merited or incurred these Judgments It is Consciousness which makes the Identity of a Person relative to himself and if Death destroys this it in Effect creates another Spirit in our stead and to reward or punish such a one for our Actions here would be Partiality or Injustice I should be ashamed to insist upon an Argument which by appearing so obvious to me makes me conclude has been often urged before but as I really never met with any Thing on this Head at least deducted from this Reasoning and that it is a Subject you know I am fond of I should carry it a good deal farther if I were writing to any one else but your Apprehension saves me that Trouble as it has often done before  Adieu  LETTER CCCIII  I DID not receive my dear  Harry  's first Letter 'till  Saturday  Evening I was then at the Rock and had no possible Means of sending an Answer to the Postoffice therefore was obliged for the first Time to disobey your Commands  In answer to your Inquiry after mine and my Pet's Health I must tell you you have been very near losing both since you left us I attribute my Illness to the irregular Way we lived in the four last Days you were in Town I was seized on  Monday  Night with all the Symptoms of a violent Fever I raved incessantly and did not recover my Senses 'till  Tuesday Polly  sent an Express to Town but no one came near us 'till  Wednesday  I went thro' all the necessary Operations and am now thank God very well I came to Town Yesterday and shall return no more Poor little Bab has had two Convulsion Fits the last was very near carrying him off They did not let me know of his Illness 'till I came to Town He is vastly altered but I hope and believe he will recover You may judge by your own the Anxiety I feel for him  I am vastly delighted with your Sentiments in regard to our future Consciousness as they are in my Mind highly conformable to Reason and Religion But I am still more charmed with  them as they corroborate my darling Hope that we shall see know and converse with each other in a future State For certainly if we retain a Consciousness of the Affections and Actions of this Life we shall likewise retain the Idea of those Persons who were the Cause of those Actions for which we are to be punished or rewarded The only Thing I ever heard objected to this Opinion is that such Remembrances might lessen the Happiness of those blessed Spirits who may in this Life be connected by natural or acquired Ties to Persons who are to make up the Number of the Unhappy in the next To this I answer from my own Belief and Hope that no Soul will be doomed to everlasting Damnation Or if there should be such unhappy Beings the Heinousness of those Crimes which deserve everlasting Misery would entirely erase the Affection or Regard we bore them unknowing of their Guilt and make us readily acknowledge when purged from gross and selfish Passions that their Doom is just I cannot think that even in this Life there ever did or will subsist a real Friendship or sincere Affection between the Good and Bad Virtue alone is the sure Basis that can make those Unions firm and lasting Without that only true Foundation like  Estcourt's  Guests  They part in Time  Whoever hears this my instructive Song  For tho' such Friendships may be dear  They ne'er continue long  I have not wrote these Lines right but 'tis no great Matter I have only altered the Form the Sense remains  I received two Letters from you Yesterday The Compliment you pay to my Understanding is more justly due to you than me If I am sensible or intelligent it is you have made me so The fond Desire of gaining your Approbation first rouzed me to exert the little Powers which Nature lent me Your Converse your Letters have improved my Mind and given my Thoughts a Turn superior to the Trifles which employ the Generality of my Sex Yet still I plead no Merit from this Boast for such a Preceptor must have improved the dullest Pupil It is you my charming Guide who have made me as far as I am either wise or good You have illustrated your Theory by Practice and by your dear Example shewn me what it is to be a Christian and Philosopher Go on then my loved Master continue to instruct and I hope improve me 'till I arrive as near thy own Perfection as my small Powers admit Yet still remember I am a Woman nay a weak one too subject to all the Failings  of my Sex which require Time as well as Reason to conquer  I am now to thank you for your Concurrence to my Request which I do very sincerely but cannot help saying tho' without Resentment that I had rather you had refused than inhanced the Merit of granting it by such unkind Suspicions I thought I had fully explained my Reasons for desiring at the Time I mentioned it tho' perhaps I thought it needless as I did not 'till now believe my dear  Harry  could think me capable of any mean or selfish Views Far from desiring to enlarge the Number of those whom you stile Confidants I sincerely lament the Necessity which obliged us to make any and I solemnly assure you I would much rather encounter any Consequence which might arise from the World's thinking ill of me than purchase their good Opinion by running the smallest Hazard of injuring you Nor do I now nor ever did mean to make any Use of it on my own Account My sole Reason for desiring it was in regard to a third Person whose future Credit and Happiness in Life is I believe as dear to you as me However if you distrust my Prudence or my Confidence in you I am very ready to resign this trifling Proof of your's in me as I would not have you think it can either lessen or increase the sincere and unbounded Dependence I ought to have on you  I long to know what Success you have with the I am glad you did not explain yourself to There are some People who become Enemies from the Time they refuse to be Friends  Adieu my dearest Life I am and ever shall be faithfully and affectionately your's  Frances  LETTER CCCIV  Callidon  August    THIS is a very sweet romantic Situation the House old and bad The Boy and Girl are really very fine Children and capable of any Education solid or polite Lady is a very sensible chearful and agreeable Woman and such a Person as any Man might be both pleased and proud to have belong to him in any Situation or Relation of Life Her Affability and unaffected Manners not less than her Food which is little more than Bread and Pulse Milk and Water would befit a Cabin while her Taste Spirit and Politeness might become a Palace  I feel a very singular Kind of Affection for her which I never was sensible of before for a new Acquaintance it is such a Regard as  we have for an old Friend I think I could speak as freely to her and intrust her with any Secret of Consequence to me as I could to a Person whose Confidence I had proved for twenty Years  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCCV  Dear  HARRY  I HAD the Pleasure of your's from Hermitage and am highly delighted with your Account of Lady and her Babes I have long been certain that whenever you knew you would love and esteem her and this Belief was I think the highest Compliment I ever paid her Has she not Abundance of that Cleverness which is not to be defined which to the common Actions of Life is like Grace to Beauty And as the latter does not arise from any particular Complexion Limb or Feature but is the joint Result of all so neither can the former be said to depend on Sense or Virtue  tho' I am morally certain it cannot exist without both For as we have seen many handsome People who wanted the charming Je ne sçai quoi so we must have met with many good and sensible Folks who had not one Grain of Cleverness about them  I am heartily concerned at the Account you give of your Affairs It is really a melancholy Thing that you have no Person about you whom you can depend upon for those whose Integrity is past Dispute for Want of a little  Cleverness  may injure you as highly as others could by defrauding you May I live to see the Day when you shall have made me as capable as I am willing and faithful to become my dear  Harry  's only Steward  Our dear little Baby is still very far from well  Blackstone  say him Yesterday He has ordered him to live entirely on ChickenBroth and SackWhey I am sorry to find his Constitution so extremely delicate I grieve over again for every Grief I felt and indulged while he was immediately a Part of me but I hope he will get the better of every Thing and never have Reason to sigh as much as he does now from Constitution  I am to sit for the first Time to  Hudson  on  Saturday  He has been engaged every Day since I came to Town I repent of my Folly already but do not know how to get off  Indeed I think it a very great one to have  my  Picture drawn especially as you cannot take it with you But it is too late to help it now and I must go on with the Farce  As your Affairs are in such an irregular Way I suppose you will not stay long at Hermitage Let me know when you intend coming to Town I wish I were to change my Lodgings every Time you leave me for I can neither sleep or wake without having your Idea continually before me nor can I sit or walk in any Part of the House without recollecting that you sat or walked there at such or such a Time As this local Memory is but a Kind of Interruption to the constant Remembrance I have always of you independent of Time or Place I am sometimes tempted to take up my Abode in the Kitchen where to the best of my Knowledge you never were that I may be free to think of you without Regard to particular Circumstances or material Objects  I have with great Care and Attention read about half of  Brown  but I must give him a second Reading before I pretend to give my Opinion or communicate my Remarks  Your Brother and Sister are come to dine with me I cannot say they interrupt me as I have nothing farther to add but that I am and ever will be your's  Frances  LETTER CCCVI  Dear  FANNY  HERE am I at the Bishop's House quite alone and shall be so 'till  Monday  next when the Family return from I met some of the Servants of this House about six Miles off and they acquainted me with the State of Matters here which would have been Hint enough for any reasonable Man to turn back upon but you know it was rather a Matter for me to rejoice at that I should have so much Time to myself my Books Paper and Music The Servants who are left behind are the higher Sort and as we are unfortunately old Acquaintance they fall foul on me from mistaken Kindness at an unmerciful Rate The Butler was immediately for sending to the Parson of the Parish  to notify the Arrival of a Relation and Friend of the Bishop's who was in such a  lonesome  Way that it would pity one's Heart to see it  But upon Inquiry I found this Man would not go away when I bid him nor take a Denial if he asked me to go home with him and not being at the Top of his Preferment in this Diocese I begged to be excused from the Overabounding of his Civility My Friend the Butler then  apprehending that I thought the Parson too grave and wise for me for he could not get it into his Head that a Man should chuse to be alone recommended the Bishop's Agent to me who he said would much delight me as he was a brave jolly Batchelor like myself and could crack a Bottle and a Joke with any Man I asked him whether this Man would give me any of my Lord's Money without his Leave and being answered▪ No I said I desired no Acquaintance with him  Lady and I had a good deal of Conversation about you the Day before I came away She spoke very handsomely of you and kindly too She said also that you had but a slight Constitution and was subject to low Spirits often which she attributed to Irregularity of Hours late at Night and Morning and recommended to me to take some Care about that Matter for you She assured me that she was herself so sensible of the great Effect of rising early that as she has naturally such a Flow of Spirits which were first owing to early Hours she is now obliged to lie in Bed some Time longer than she is inclined lest she should run wild about the Country to the utter Scandal and Astonishment of all her Neighbours  Adieu  LETTER CCCVII  I Congratulate my dear  Harry  on the unexpected Indulgence which his Taste for Retirement has met with I am not at all surprized that you neither returned to Hermitage nor accepted the Company that has been offered you at for I am well aware how pleasant it must be to a Mind like your's to be allowed the free Exercise of it's own Faculties I have often looked with great Pity not entirely unmixed with Contempt on very good Kind of People for seeming to be utter Strangers to the Pleasures of Selfsociety for I will not call it Solitude to be sometimes alone However I hope your contemplative Amusements are by this Time heightened into the Joys of a rational Converse by the Bishop's Return I am sure he is a sensible Man from the Friendship that has so long subsisted between you and the Manner you always speak of him in  I am much obliged to dear Lady for the Expressions as well as Proofs of Regard she has honoured me with There is really something extraordinary in her Attachment for indeed I cannot plead the least Merit to her Friendship yet I hope and believe I shall ever retain it for I am well convinced I must be highly to blame whenever I forfeit it  I am very certain that you and she are quite right with regard to early Hours But I would not disgrace the Goodness of her Heart as well as Understanding to suppose her chearful Spirits arise merely from Constitution Believe me that in order to support them she has had Recourse to Religion and Philosophy nor has her high Station exempted her from wanting their Aid May both you and she ever retain that sensible Chearfulness which so well becomes ye which tho' you modestly ascribe to Regularity and early Hours has it's Effect from another Cause a Consciousness of acting right and a Mind filled with  that sweet Peace which Goodness bosoms ever  I will not however pretend to deny that in such Constitutions as mine Irregularity may weaken the Faculties of the Mind as well as the Body and diffuse a Lassitude and Heaviness over both Providence having ordained for their mutual Preservation that what injures the one shall immediately or remotely affect the other This Sentiment may be carried a great Way even to the mental Vices of Envy Avarice  c  and every Person who has ever felt Sickness or Pain must know  we are not ourselves when Nature being oppressed commands the Mind to suffer with the Body  Adieu  Frances  LETTER CCCVIII  My Dear  FANNY  ALL alone still in my own Kingdom where though I have no very extensive Sway I have those Subjects to govern that should be the first Essay of a Monarch's Politics namely my own Passions and Foibles I might have answered your Letter last Post but declined it as I had not Time to do it Justice to speak still in the kingly Stile  I am extremely pleased when you answer my Letters properly by entering into the Spirit and Subject of them which indeed you can do so well not with  I received your's and for Answer say  A Correspondence should be properly a Conversation not mere Question and Answer I often just hint at Subjects and leave them imperfect to give you Occasion to complete them and I am vexed and disappointed when you neglect it out of Laziness or Diffidence for it must be owing to either of these whenever I am disappointed You have sometimes told me that I overawe you from an Apprehension of my superior Understanding so that in writing or speaking to me you have not always the full Exercise of your own Powers  Now for Argument's sake we will let this pass but then believe me  Fanny  if I remember right I had not so refined and speculative Sense as you have now when I was at your Age All the Improvement I have ever made to it has been almost since that Time and a practised Wrestler may be able to overcome an inexperienced Man of greater natural Abilities You are now in a State and Stage of Life proper to improve yourself and may have this Advantage over me that you can have the Help of one who has lately travelled through the Road you are to go so that I hope in Return to have your Assistance as your Understanding will be at the Height when mine from the Course of Nature will be on the Decline This I should look upon as a Sort of Triumph of the most flattering Kind namely a Conquest over myself that is my better Part overcoming my worse Besides you have the Advantage of a chaste and religious Education which will the sooner enable you to reach the only End I have ever proposed from my Studies to make me rather a better than a wiser Man Moral Philosophy may reform our Manners and subdue our Passions but slowly the one and with a constant Struggle the other while Religion effects the first at once and the latter with Ease by substituting more charming Pleasures in their stead  This is the most romantic Place I ever saw There are not two hundred Yards of level Ground in the whole Country for it is composed of an infinite Number of green Hills lying so close to each other that it resembles a Codlin Pye in a Bowldish So that the Nurse's Story of Giants of old stepping from one Hill to another round the Country would not appear an improbable Tale here It is much the same Way at Hermitage too and in general thro' all those Parts of this Country I have yet seen  I hope you are reading  Brown  upon the  Characteristics  and writing Notes upon it I am sure you are because I desired it I should be glad to have your Opinion upon the Definition of Virtue given in the last Lines of the third Section of the second Essay upon the moral Obligations of Man to Virtue I give you fair Play by telling you that I think this Definition false and imperfect and only ask you how it is so Read the first second and third Sections carefully before you give your Opinion not that you will discover the Error from them but they will help you to judge the better  This is a severe Trial of my dear Pupil for I own when first I read the Book I was fully satisfied with the Definition And to give you some Help in this Matter I agree that he has shewn the Imperfection of the other  three Definitions of Virtue but yet I say he has given a more imperfect and dangerous one himself  Adieu  my Life  Henry  LETTER CCCIX  IN the disagreeable and embarrassed Situation I am at present I know nothing could tempt me to write but the Fear of your thinking I poorly declined the Task you have assigned me without being ingenuous enough to confess myself unequal to it I had gone through the whole Essay on the Obligations of Man to Virtue before I received your Letter and had remarked the Definition you mention to be as  imperfect  as any of those he terms  so  For which Reason I had contented myself with thinking that Virtue is not to be defined and had taken up so much of Dr  Clarke  's Opinion as to believe that though like the Certainty of an Almighty Being it cannot be reduced to Terms or fully proved and explained by Words yet is it selfevident to every rational Creature  Brown  says Virtue consists  in the Conformity of our Affections with the public Good and the voluntary Production of the greatest Happiness▪  If by the Public he means all  human Kind he might have explained it by  universal Benevolence  which is so far from excluding the natural or moral Ties that it certainly strengthens them  Friends Parents Neighbours first it will embrace  It's Country next and next all human Race  But if he confines his Idea of the Public to a particular Nation or People he doubtless makes Virtue of a variable and indeterminate Nature and at once destroys his own System and it's Existence For tho' the Love of our Country is certainly a very noble and proper Principle yet as the Interests of every Nation and People vary what may be virtuous with regard to the Advantages of one may be highly criminal by becoming prejudicial to another This therefore cannot be the true Criterion of Virtue It's Effects must be uniform independent of Time or Place as it is itself the same in the Vale of  Santone  or the Palace of  Versailles    I am still more displeased at the latter Part of his Definition  the voluntary Production of the greatest Happiness  As this may be understood poorly confining Virtue to the particular Stations of Affluence or Power I cannot think this was the Author's Meaning yet as it may be wrested to this Point I think it is dangerously expressed for it may tend to discourage  the Exercise of Virtue in those who have it not in their Power to do great or generous Actions  I have now given my dear Preceptor the highest Proof of my Obedience to his Commands and as we are told in Scripture that "Obedience is better than Sacrifice" I hope he will accept the Will for the Deed Believe me my dearest Life I have never been so much hurt at the Consciousness of my own Weakness as at this Moment I know I have exposed it but I know I have an indulgent Master who will forgive and instruct me From the first of our Correspondence I have ever declined writing tho' I was vain enough of my Capacity in that Way before but the Perfection of your Letters has shewn me my Insufficiency in such a glaring Light that I never sit down to answer a Letter of your's without blushing You say I am now  at an Age and in a State of Life to admit Improvement  My Age is doubtless on your Side but my Situation much against you The Quickness of my Apprehension which is or should be my best Help to study is turned to melancholy Prospects and my Attention to any Thing I read continually interrupted as I never am one Moment alone  I am ashamed to send this Letter I would not let it go but for fear you should think me lazy Adieu Life Love adieu  Frances  LETTER CCCX  My Dear Pet  YOU cannot imagine what Pleasure your Critique upon  Brown  gives me Your Sentiments are extremely clever and just and would become a greater Adept in Philosophy than you are but are really surprizing for a young Woman upon so abstruse a Subject I am pleased to find that your Remarks have taken a different Turn from mine tho' we both agree in the same Opinion and am glad I did not see your's before I wrote my own lest I should have rested there and thought that no farther Criticism was necessary upon the Subject  Indeed my Dear I intreat you to exert your Talents a little oftener in this Way for you may be assured that if I did not think you equal to the Task I would not recommend it to you Your short and impartial Character is this You have a very good natural Understanding a lively Fancy a quick Apprehension and an easy Expression Your Judgment is rather delicate than strong and may be better stiled a refined Taste than a logical Reason In short you need no farther Helps from Nature and all the Assistance you want from Art is to be directed to a Course of reading proper to furnish  you with Subjects fit for your Reflection and a letter'd Converse to exercise your Mind 'till it attains that Health and Vigour which it is originally capable of  Adieu  my Life  LETTER CCCXI  AS my dear  Harry  knows the Uneasiness which his Silence gives me I cannot help saying it is more than unkind it is absolutely cruel to neglect writing There was a Report last Week that you died suddenly I heard it last  Friday  and my not receiving a Letter from you that Day almost distracted me Tho' your Letters are the most sensible and elegant Pleasure I can receive in your Absence yet is my Affection so much stronger than my Understanding that I would willingly give up the Entertainment they afford me to be certain of a single Line by every Post which should barely tell me you are well I know it is a Weakness to expect such exact Punctuality but it is the natural Effect of a  greater  the having so entirely given up my Heart as to render my Happiness wholly dependent on you a Trust for which contrary to the general Opinion you can with Ease give me sufficient Security  I received your two Letters of the former Posts and think it is really something extraordinary that a Person who was bred and has lived like you should at your Time of Life immersed in Business and involved in disagreeable Circumstances without any outward Call or visible Help become so great a Proficient in a Science which to the Generality of the World appears so tedious and abstruse as to deter them from being at all acquainted with it and in which many learned and from thence called wise Men have passed their Lives without either making themselves or the World one whit the better for it In short I look upon it as a particular Mark of the Almighty's Goodness that has been pleased to give you a Turn of Mind which must render you superior to the common Accidents of Life and that he has thought proper to make you an Instance among the few that neither Riches Power nor Honours are necessary to constitute the real Happiness of a rational Being since with a Taste and Relish for them all yet unpossessing any of them your State is infinitely preferable to those who in the full Enjoyment of them all are unblest with true Religion and Philosophy  May my sweet Love long taste those Blessings which Virtue can alone bestow and may it both in this World and the next be to him  an Addition of his Bliss that he has made me better wiser and of course happier  Adieu  my Heart's my Soul's dear  Harry  LETTER CCCXII  My Dear  FANNY  YOU desired to hear from me on  Friday  but those who love are fond of Works of Supererogation  I am reading one of the Books I brought away from you intitled  Manners  and am well pleased with it I remember the Reason of my throwing it aside when I bought it for you was upon looking a little into it I observed the Author had alluded to a great Number of private Characters to illustrate general Theorems and as I had sometimes met with many insipid moral Novels of that Kind I conceived a Prejudice against the Book But I find from this Author that when such a Manner is managed with Wit and Address it gives a certain Vivacity to this Kind of Writings and strengthens the Stile by adding Action to Reason  What incited my Inclination to read this Book was a Paragraph in the public Papers that it had given great Offence in  France  where it was written and that there was likely to be  a Prosecution against the Author and as far as I have gone I find it has a Merit in it very apt to give Offence to Priests and Bigots The Writer is I think a Man of Sense Learning Parts and unprejudiced Reflections I am therefore highly pleased to find he is of the same Opinion with me of an innate Idea of irrelative Virtue which is a Sentiment I am so charmed with that I am fond of laying hold on every Occasion of discoursing about it So I shall here take a Flight at it again  We have from the mere Beauty of Nature a Smell for Flavours a Taste for Savours a Sight for Symmetry an Hearing for Sounds and a Feeling for more sensual Gratifications Shall then the Goodness nay the Justice of God leave us void of as immediate a Sensation of Virtue which is a Thing of so much higher Consequence both to ourselves and others and both with regard to this Life and the next Shall I say the Bounty of God be greater than his Justice Shall our instinct Faculties be governed by a divine Impulse and shall our moral Powers be left without a Guide for human Reason is insufficient to form the Rule tho' it's proper Province is to be exercised and conversant about it  But the Senses are only the Organs to convey Ideas to the Mind it is the Soul which perceives Brutes then have a Soul They have  also a Spirit if you give me Leave to make a Distinction here for Matter of itself is inactive There are so many Instances in Brutes of what we partially stile little mimic Reason that Mankind has no great Cause to be vain upon the sole Prerogative of this Excellence since all we can claim is but a higher Degree of this boasted Superiority  But we are taught to believe that God formed Man after his own Image This Favour surely was not shewn in his human Figure which  Diogenes  humourously ridiculed by plucking a Goose and leading it through the Streets of  Athens  crying "Behold  Plato  's Man" which that Philosopher had defined to be a twolegged Animal without Feathers Nor can this glorious Characteristic be presumed from any one Quality which Brutes have in any Degree or Analogy with us What then is this great Distinction upon which we do and ought so justly to value ourselves but a certain innate moral Sense which as the Serpent expresses it  makes us as Gods knowing Good from Evil  Brutes are capable of Virtue according to the common Sense of it for many of their Actions demonstrate Love Gratitude and Benevolence And though when the Spaniel beats the Field for our Sport or Food he may be considered as acting merely for his own Pleasure this is no more than some Moralists have charged upon  human Virtue which they have resolved into a Selfsatisfaction In short it is an innate moral Idea which makes us  sensible  of Virtue while Reason and free Will only make us capable of it  As soon as I have read this Book I will send it up to you  Adieu  my fairest Idea  LETTER CCCXIII  My Dear  FANNY  I WOULD not tell you any thing of the Matter 'till it was over but I left Town with a sore Throat which increased very fast upon me last Night but I am this Morning thank God as well as ever and am just setting out for your own  Belvidere    I have gone a good Way in  Manners  and upon a farther View in that Author I begin to find the same Fault with him which I did at first His Characters are too frequently introduced are tedious and ill drawn and many of them not at all to the Purpose However there are here and there certain Traits of Genius which upon the whole make the Work appear to have been written by two different Persons or rather I have taken it into my Head that  it was wrote by a Woman who had for some Time conversed freely with sensible Men  The Author Authors or Compiler of this Book speaks very rationally against the Doctrine of eternal Misery which is a Matter I think I have in some of my Letters given my Opinion upon and is a Subject I am so fond of that I shall venture to speak the Sentiments which at present occur to me on that Head without waiting to recollect whether I have said the same Things to you before or no or whether any one has said them before me  The Doctrine of eternal Misery establishes the Empire of the Devil for twenty Men must be damned for one that can be saved upon the orthodox Christian Scheme and the Mediator has suffered in vain  Suppose during the Millennium of the Just there should be a Millennium of the Unjust don't you think a thousand Years Sufferings may make sufficient Atonement to divine Justice And I think the popish Doctrine of Purgatory only absurd in the Opinion that any Merits of the Living can avail the Dead there However this wild Notion may be considered as a pious Fraud to be of Service in Religion as it multiplies our Inducements to Devotion As for Example If I thought my dear  Fanny  was receiving many Stripes there for her Crossness to me no Anchorite ever led such an exemplary  Life as I should to rescue my own spoiled Pet  Infinite Justice they say requires infinite Satisfaction Perhaps this is only a Quibble upon Words But to take it their own Way has not the Mediator's Suffering already given this infinite Satisfaction and must every miserable Wretch who dies in Sin become an additional Victim to infinite Justice In short this shocking Doctrine seems rather to be a Piece of Priest's Rage than divine Wrath and is such a blasphemous Opinion of the Godhead as exceeds almost any of those Lay Crimes they anathematize so vehemently and presumptuously at the same Time and are not aware that they reduce God to a Kind of Fate while by extending his Justice they limit his Mercy and so peremptorily destroy the Power of free Will in the Exercise of his Attributes But I cannot let this  infinite  Satisfaction pass by so quietly without shewing that it proves nothing by proving too much for infinite Satisfaction must be infinite every Way in Degree as well as Duration then this destroys the equitable Rule of proportionable Punishments for the least Crime requires Satisfaction infinite Satisfaction infinite in Degree and infinite in Duration so that a Man must be made a God before he can be rendered capable of giving such infinite Satisfaction  I have not done with this Subject and shall resume it in my next for the Post is just going out Adieu my own  Fanny  Read and write my charming Pupil while I endeavour to reflect that Light back again upon you which you first inspired me with  LETTER CCCXIV  My Dear  FANNY  I AM just come home My Uncle is as usual or as some Man construed Queen  Anne  's Motto  semper eadem  worse and worse  Every Thing here in a backward and neglected Way Why do not you come done and set Matters to rights I hope in God I shall not be long the only Slave in your Affairs I have many Things to take care of and there is but one Person I can or should chuse to confide in and her Help I am deprived of O my Soul keep steddy to your Philosophy for my old Friend Providence will not forsake you  I have finished  Manners  and still think of that Book as I did in my last and could point out several Passages to shew that it is rather a Collection than an original Work I do not mean from his general Reasoning which if right cannot avoid being the same with others  who have wrote justly upon the same Subject but what I would instance are particular Turns of Thought and Expression which I have met with before There is one among them taken from  Montesquieu  's  Persian Letters  That it appears more reasonable that the Minority instead of the Majority should determine a Question for ten Men think wrong for one who judges right  The only Difference between this Whim in the  Lettres Persanes  and this Book is that  Montesquieu  only threw out this Sentiment as a Stroke of Fancy but our Moralist seems to advance it as a grave Argument and supports it by a Text from  Exodus  disingenuously quoted His Words are that the  Jewish  Legislator advises us  not to pass our Judgment according to the Opinion of the greater Number  which Words do certainly support his ridiculous Argument But observe the literal Words of the Text and you will see how unfairly he deals with it  Thou shalt not follow a Multitude  to do evil  neither shalt thou speak in a Cause to decline after many  to wrest Judgment    Exod xxiii  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCCXV  I HAVE but just Time to tell my sweet Love that I have spent the greatest Part of this Day with my dear Lady She came to Town on  Sunday  Night and sent to me Yesterday Indeed she is a charming Woman  I am sorry for your Uncle's Disorder but am afraid he is incurable I am sure I need not say how earnestly I wish to share and alleviate your every Distress and Fatigue But tho' I am at present denied that Happiness I will rely on that Providence who can and will in his good Time remove every Obstacle that prevents my lessening your Inquietudes by taking that Share in them which is immediately my Right and which I would not part with nor exchange for any Title that could put me into the Possession of Power Wealth and Honours  I could say more much more upon this Subject but hear the Tinkling of the Postman's Bell therefore must conclude truly and affectionately your's  Frances  LETTER CCCXVI  Dear  FANNY  I FORGOT to mention to you in my last another remarkable Passage in our moral Plagiarist even  Pope  's muchadmired Simile of a Stone thrown into a standing Lake verbatim except the Rhyme  But let us have done with him for he interrupted me last Post in the Prosecution of my Argument upon eternal Misery and how or how far I reasoned upon that Subject I do not recollect at present for I have been deep involved in Affairs of this World since I came home But I shall proceed as Thoughts now occur without Regard to Order as you know I take the Liberty with you of making my Letters a Sort of CommonPlaceBook Not that I desire any Writer should see or expect they would borrow any Thing from these rude Essays which I find an Amusement to revolve in my own Mind and a Pleasure to communicate to you for whom alone I write tho' it is for both our sakes I read  I am not ignorant that the Scriptures are full of penal Threats but I do not remember that they are denounced to all Eternity Nay I think the contrary is implied in a Text which the Popish Clergy quote for Purgatory  there to  remain 'till thou hast paid the uttermost Farthing  It is an Allusion made to the State of a Debtor I am afraid that even eternal Happiness is not fully promised in the Scriptures which surely is a more reasonable Faith than the other and that this glorious Hope is rather a moral Presumption than a divine Revelation Our principal Arguments upon this Head are drawn from the perfect Goodness of God the Analogy running through all his Works The natural Frame of the human Soul it's frequent Satiety of all worldly Enjoyments except alone it's Contemplation of the Divine Nature it's earnest Longings after that supreme elevated and complete Bliss and a certain natural Sympathy the virtuous and religious Mind feels to be again allied to some more excellent Nature which it seems to have as it were a Sense of being lately separated from I think it may be rationally inferred from all this that to satisfy the natural Frame of such a Soul it's Bliss must be eternal for Pleasures not made to cloy can give no Satiety Now extend rather say limit our heavenly Bliss to the millionth Power of a millionth Myriad of Years which is almost infinitely beyond the Art of Numbers to enumerate yet even the immediate Bliss of the sublimed Spirit would be from that Reflection rendered imperfect as the higher our Happiness in Possession the more sensibly are  we affected at even the most remote Thought of parting with it And I should prefer my State even in this vile World satiated with frail mortal Joys and oppressed with lifelong Cares but presuming upon the great Hope of a glorious Immortality to the most sublime Pleasures of the next limited in Prospect even one Thought short of Eternity Shall we lose our earnest Relish our virtuous Longing after Immortality in a State of certain Bliss which operates so emphatically in our Souls even while the Vices of the Body and the Corruption of the Heart occasion that Thought to be attended with a Dread of what Eternity we may be doomed to or may the Soul in perfect Bliss have one Desire ungratified In short to bring this hearttransporting metaphysicinspiring Subject as near to Demonstration as possible let me presume to argue thus If the Souls of Men are not immortal God has granted us less Happiness than we are capable of which is contrary to our Notion of God  with whom is Fulness of Joy and Pleasure for evermore  Thus Man has a rational Praesentiment of future Bliss and a rational Deduction of it's Eternity but he has neither one or the other with regard to future Misery or it's Eternity The only Dread which appears to me natural to the Mind of Man is that very shocking one of Annihilation  What I mean is that Man has not any natural Forebodings of future Misery tho' his Reason may draw some Inference about it But then this Reason can never conclude for eternal Punishments and his Faith must be blind who could credit that Religion which adhibited such a Revelation  So that the Doctrine of Punishments rests merely upon what Revelation is made about them which as I hinted before does not denounce them eternal at least the Misery  Nay I think farther that tho' Rewards may be agreeable to divine Justice Punishments are not If I remember right I said something upon this Subject to you in a former Letter by alluding to human Laws so shall insist on it no farther here But to take away all Cavil from this Paradox and to treat this Subject more equally I shall deny that either Rewards or Punishments tho' allowed in the moral Sense are agreeable to divine Goodness or Justice in the legislative Sense and perhaps I may argue in concert with the Scripture too  The Pleasing or Displeasing of God are but figurative Expressions which taken in a literal Sense have occasioned the Terms of Rewards and Punishments for thus are divine Matters confounded and impured by drawing Analogies between them and human Things Now our good or bad Actions relate entirely to our own  Happiness or Misery and would it not be partial to bestow a Reward where there can possibly be no Merit for as the Scripture says  after all we shall be but unprofitable Servants  As it would be cruel to inflict a Punishment where Ignorance Passion or Temptation may lead a Man into Vice for as the same Scripture says "where little is given little shall be expected"  I would not hazard this Subject so unfinished to any Hands but your's as I am obliged to break off in a very dangerous Crisis but the Night is far spent and next Post shall be employed to extract the Poison  Adieu thou sole Partner of my Heart and only Confidante of all it's Sentiments  Henry  LETTER CCCXVII  I THINK then with some sensible Divines that Rewards and Punishments are not bestowed or inflicted upon our Actions good or bad but that Happiness or Misery is the preordained Consequence of Virtue or Vice and that as natural Virtue or Vice as Temperance and Exercise or Intemperance and Inactivity produce Health or Disease in this World so moral Virtue or Vice as essentially are attended with Happiness or Misery in the next  Now if our Portions hereafter be general moral Consequences and not particular justiciary Adaptions I can perceive no Reason how the Soul of Man can be at any Time precluded from redeeming itself by a thorough Contrition and sincere Repentance or that a Halter or a Quinsey shall be sufficient to deprive it of Bliss to all Eternity For a Spirit at any Period of it's Existence reclaimed to a full and perfect Sense Love and Adoration of the Essence Truth Goodness and Power of God must necessarily attract to itself that Happiness which is essentially allied to such a State of Mind  But some severe Divines may here object that a departed Spirit can possibly have no Merit in Contrition or Repentance when Temptation to Sin is no more and when the consequential Misery is demonstratively ascertained and severely experienced To which Part of my last Letter may be an Answer where the Merit of Virtue is denied and the Beginning of this Letter may be referred to where Happiness is said to be the Consequence not the Reward of Virtue And as we are taught to believe that higher Spirits than our's have been plunged into the Abyss for Sin in the next World why may we not hope that a poor human Soul may be capable of emerging from thence by Righteousness hereafter for surely Religion is not limited either in Place or Time to the narrow Bounds and  short Duration of this paltry Globe but extends itself thro' the whole Universe of Intelligence and shall continue to all Eternity  I look upon this Life to be a State of Trial and the next to be a State of Purgation from which perhaps the most perfect Man may not be exempt For Vengeance is not of the Essence of God but his Nature is so pure that no Spirit may approach the Throne of his Grace obscured by Stain or Blemish and a State of thorough Purgation that is of sincere Repentance without Temptation to Sin is necessary to prepare us for the Bliss of Angels So that I look upon the Devil's Empire to be of this World only and not extended to the next for here he may tempt but there he cannot  I think then that a Soul purged from Sin by any Method is a proper Object of the Divine Favour  Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth  Can Chastisement then be deemed the Effect of Hatred in the Lord "who hateth nothing which he has made" And does not a Father cordially love a Son whom he has reclaimed by Discipline Is not the Penitence of a Sinner accepted of by God tho' effected by Pain Poverty or other Misfortune in this Life Shall the whole heavenly Host rejoice over a repentant Sinner in this World and shall the Circumstance of Time or Place deprive them of Charity when our  Souls become more nearly allied to them than in the Flesh  In short if Punishments or Misery either judiciary or consequential be eternal in any one Instance the Devil has triumphed so far which is Blasphemy But according to the Severity of some Divines there can be but a small Minority saved which would look like a very paltry Composition for the Redeemer of Mankind to make  If this Doctrine may appear to set Men too free from Terror to influence their Conduct toward a virtuous Life I shall consider this Subject in that Light in another Letter and do assure you my dearest Ally that I am as sincerely attached to you as if I thought my Salvation depended upon it  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCCXVIII  SINCE my last Letter I have looked into the Bible and find some Passages where eternal Punishments are denounced but then I find also several other Places where the Words  eternal  and  everlasting  are meant in a limited Sense for a long and indefinite Time So that I think these Texts do not preclude me from reasoning upon this Subject  I own the first Thing which occurred to me when I met with Expressions in the Scripture that seemed to shock my Reason and my Idea of God was to suppose them only Threats  in Terrorem  but then this alarmed me about the Consequence which such a Surmise might draw after it with regard to the Promises mentioned in the same Scripture However upon Recollection I did not think this Inference should logically follow for a Promise is a Contract the virtuous Man a Purchaser and Justice exacts the Obligation But the Case is quite different with regard to Threats A Lord may say to his Steward  Tend well this Farm 'till my Return and I will make thee an Inheritance out of it but if you suffer the Soil to be overgrown with Briars I will cause thee to be flayed alive  Now tho' the Lord must fulfil his Promise out of Justice he surely may forgive the Penalty out of Mercy  But I do not mean to insist upon this Argument for as the Texts I hint at may be so interpreted as to agree with the Reasoning of my former Letters I should be very tender of charging the least Disingenuousness upon the Words of God and if they were express and uncontrovertible in this or any other Particular against my Sense or Opinion I would as becomes me submit my Reason to my Faith And indeed tho' the Distinction I have made  between Promises and Threats does sufficiently prove that Justice or Reason does not require the Completion of denounced Vengeance yet certainly  Truth  requires that every Thing shall be as it is affirmed  In order to help us the better to frame a Judgment upon this Subject let us take the Matter as high as we can by beginning at original Sin and yet all the Curse we hear upon that Occasion seems to be Temptation Labour and Death  Genesis  iii and to the End That is it may be apprehended that the natural Consequence of the first Parent's Sin was the debasing human Nature to a State of Frailty Mechanics and Mortality which imperfect Nature was from thence derived down to all their Race  For an evil Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit  Our Redeemer afterwards at a certain Time though resolved from the Beginning takes our Nature upon him and is thence stiled our second  Adam  by which benevolent and godlike Condescension Mankind was retrieved to their former Dignity so far as to be rendered capable of their former Perfection perhaps greater in which the whole Mystery of the Incarnation seems to lie not in the unaccountable Doctrine of satisfying the Divine Justice which Doctrine has perplexed the Faith of many welldisposed Christians and perhaps has prevented this  Religion from becoming as universal as it's other Evidence and moral Perfection seems to promise  That Mankind should labour under Guilt for the Sin of our first Parents and that they should be redeemed by the Sacrifice of God the first not our Crime and the latter not our Merit seems to be a Scheme of Providence contrary to Sense or Religion But that a Race of Beings proceeding from  Adam  after his Fall should consequentially be of too corrupt a Nature to be capable of perfect Bliss and that our Redeemer becoming our second Parent a Man every Way Sin only excepted should thereby restore that Purity to our Nature as may render it capable of perfect Happiness is in my Opinion a Doctrine agreeable to metaphysical Philosophy reconcileable to the Nature of Things to the eternal Laws of God and likewise vindicates him from the Charge of Vengeance or Partiality as the whole Consequences seem to proceed from the original Formation of Things  From all which Reasoning I shall venture to conclude against eternal Punishments For in the first Instance at the Fall even temporary ones are not threatened  in futuro  and in the second Instance at Man's Redemption if they became so then how many wretched Souls would be Losers by the Bargain and Christ  may be said to have overcome Death only by his Sacrifice but not to have conquered Sin  These few Thoughts occurring to me when I sat down to write have obliged me to defer my Promise in my last 'till the next Post  Adieu  Henry  LETTER CCCXIX  My Dear  FANNY  I AM now retired from the Grand Jury to perform a Promise I have delayed for some Posts and think an Assizes a proper Time to discourse about  Judgment to come    When I first entered upon this Subject I own I trembled as  Felix  did for fear of the Consequence of my Doctrine therefore I canvassed the Matter a good deal in my own Mind before I ventured to treat upon it even to you tho' I was perfectly certain that the Notion of eternal Misery could not add any thing to the Strength of your Virtue tho' it might perhaps take away somewhat of the Merit of it The Reasons then which suffered me to proceed were these  If I argued justly which I endeavoured to do I cannot apprehend any ill Consequence from  my Subject Truth cannot injure Truth and Error is not necessary to bring about the Ends or Designs of Providence  I do not say that the Propitiation of our Saviour was selfsufficient to redeem us totally but that it did not leave us in a worse State under the Gospel than it found us under the Law which with regard to the many it would have done upon this Doctrine and only enabled us to work out our own Salvation but I do not think it has limited the Time  I think that the severe Divines endeavour to prove too much For as there is no proportional Justice in eternal Misery Men may suspect the whole Scheme from one Flaw to be but a pious Fraud to deter from Vice but when Misery is taught to be the natural Consequence of Vice Damnation may appear to be unavoidable unless the Great Immutable Being shall contradict his eternal Laws which is absurd and still less to be expected in Favour of a Sinner  The Terror of eternal Torments either drives Men to Despair and so does more Harm than Good or is balanced by the Hope of Mercy in Proportion to it's Fear and so is destroyed  A Man would certainly with more Prudence put himself into the Power of a provoked Enemy than expose himself naked to an easterly Wind  because in one Case something might be hoped from Generosity and Mercy but in the other he must expect the natural Consequence of his Indiscretion and Folly  I think the Doctrine as it stands in the Orthodoxy savours too much of human Politics and the mixing profane with sacred Things has often a dangerous Tendency  Some Divines argue very unfairly and uncomfortably too upon the Obligations of Man to Virtue by attributing it to Hope and Fear as if Rewards and Punishments were as an  Allay  necessary to make the too refined Idea of it permanent and fit for Use But surely the Love of Virtue is not Hope nor is the Abhorrence of Vice Fear though these very distinct Ideas seem to be confounded by their Definition  I believe that any Man who has observed the least upon the Motions of the human Mind has at several Times of his Life perceived a certain Impulse to some Actions and a Sort of Unwillingness to others though both in all human Appearance indifferent in themselves nay sometimes these secret Intimations have moved us contrary to the most obvious Reason about such Things but in a little Time perhaps the Genius of these intimate Directions has manifested itself in some remarkable Event  of our Lives unforeseen and improbable at that Time  Is it reasonable then to suppose that such Hints should be afforded us in Things merely relative to our Lives or Fortunes in this World and that we should be left without some unerring Guide or Impulse with regard to Virtue upon which our nobler Fortunes and immortal Lives depend These inward Workings of the Spirit this natural Consciousness this Selfevidence which I have at several Times supposed in the Mind of Man I am well convinced have in general a stronger Effect toward the Influence of Virtue than all the Art of Logic supported by the Doctrine of eternal Misery For my Part I have been often guilty of Vice with all the Fear and Trembling of an orthodox Christian and have at other Times been capable of Virtue without the least Contemplation about Hope  As true Religion consists in the perfect Love of God  St  Mark  says of the Love of God  This is the first Commandment  I do not see how Fear is any way necessary to Piety except that best and strongest of all Fears which proceeds from extreme Love  There is Mercy with thee therefore shalt thou be feared  And I cannot help joining  with  Shaftsbury  who says  that Priests have made Religion so very selfish that I do not see after all what Merit there is in it worth rewarding  Fear may deter from Vice but can never conduce to Virtue  The less we suppose the Deity capable of Cruelty or Revenge the higher our Love must naturally rise and it is certain that Mankind is apt to undertake nobler and more difficult Actions from the Spirit of Love than from the Passion of Fear There is a Courage in our Natures which spurns at Fear but a Tenderness in our Frames which disposes to Love And if any Man is base enough to be influenced by Terror it is because he has not had his Mind sufficiently imbued with more worthy Principles and in this Case which is corrupt Morals it is too often found that even Fear will have no Avail Instances are numberless of moral Pagans independent of Hope For tho' in the Writings of the Antients there are very fine Reasonings upon a future Life and Retributions of Justice yet these appear to be rather the  Effect  of their Philosophy than the  Cause  of their Virtue  The Jesuits have a blasphemous Tenet with regard to Communicants  That Attrition alone which proceeds merely from the Fear of HellTorments without Contrition which  comprehends the Love of God is sufficient to justify a Sinner at the Sacrament  I will here give you some of the truly religious Sentiments of Father  Quesnel  which I think regard this Subject and in order to raise your Esteem for them I need only tell you they are some of the Propositions condemned by the infamous Bull  Unigenitus    As Sin proceeds from a mistaken Love of ourselves so Virtue proceeds from a true Love of God  Fear stops only the Hand but the Heart remaineth adherent to Sin as long as it is not directed by the Love of Justice  He who refrains from Evil only out of Fear of Punishment commits it in his Heart and is already guilty of it before God  He who is baptized is yet under the Law even as a  Jew  if he doth not fulfil it or if he fulfil it only thro' Fear  Moses  and the Prophets the Priests and the Doctors of the Law are dead without sending any Children to God since they have made Slaves but thro' Fear  They that are under the Curse of the Law do no Good because it is equal Sin to do Evil or to shun it thro' Fear  He that approacheth God should not come to him with brutal Passions nor be  led by Instinct or Fear as Beasts but by Faith and Love as Children  Slavish Fear represents God as a severe imperious unjust and unmerciful Master  To all which I shall add that Fear may make good Citizens but Love alone makes good Christians And upon the whole I really think that in my Doctrine there is Mystery enough to exercise Faith and Inducements sufficient to influence Action  Adieu  my  Fanny  Henry  Several other Thoughts occurred to me upon this Subject but I think I have hinted them in former Letters  LETTER CCCXX  I HAVE ever since the Close of my late nice and extraordinary Subject been examining and viewing it in several Lights to find out whether my Reasoning had proceeded from the Prejudice of former Opinions or had arisen from an Hope produced by a Sinner's Fear But I found that during a constant Neglect of religious and Christian Duties and a free Indulgence of a debauched and libertine Life  I preserved an unhesitating Belief in the Orthodoxy of HellTorments and that 'till within these few Years that is since I became in Practice as well as Belief a Christian I never had the least Doubt upon the Subject The Truth is that I had never before given myself Leisure to reason about Religion and had entirely rested upon a childish Belief instead of supporting myself by a rational Faith Perhaps a Dispute upon this Subject may be put an End to by a very strong though not obvious Distinction between  Punishment  and  Misery  and I will agree with the Orthodoxy that Sinners may be eternally punished though not eternally miserable A less Degree of Bliss than we are taught from Reason and Revelation our Souls are capable of is a Punishment but not a Misery and after having suffered such Pains and Torment emblematized by the  purging so as by Fire  as is sufficient to fulfil the Measure of divine Justice some inferior Degree of immortal Bliss may be the highest Portion of a Sinner's Redemption the Consciousness of which Limitation having proceeded from his own Vices or Demerits may be that Punishment which is described in Scripture by the Metaphor of  the Worm that never dieth    As I have thro' the Course of this Argument made use merely of human Reason instead of  scriptural Authority I shall here call in Aid some profane Writing to support me  Socrates  speaks by  Plato  in his  Gorgias  much to this same Purpose and again in his  Phaedo  where he is discoursing just before his Death I have not the Book here or I would send you the Quotations  Now I can hardly suffer this to pass for profane Authority for he was not only the greatest Heathen that ever lived but was stiled by some of the Fathers of the Church a Christian before Christianity and  Erasmus  seems to consider him as an inspired Person Perhaps the Fulness of Time being then near at Hand and the World as it were entient with the God of Life and Immortality some Ray of Divinity might have illumined that great Man as the Sun disperses a Twilight before itself appears  It was at this remarkable Aera when moral Philosophy was brought to the highest Pitch that ever it arrived at in the Heathen World that  Socrates  or  Plato  for him acknowledged the Insufficiency of natural Reason to perfect this great Scheme and called aloud for a Revelation to dispel the Mists of Error and afford us a certain infallible and safe Guide to direct Mankind in the Paths of Virtue  If I have erred in my Reasonings upon this Subject it has been owing more to the Weakness  of my Understanding than the Wickedness of my Heart So I shall conclude here with the two last Lines of  Buckingham  's Epitaph the whole of which I once translated for you  Humanum est errare et nescire  Ens Entium miserere mei  Henry  FINIS
