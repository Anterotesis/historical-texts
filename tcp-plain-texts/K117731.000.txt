 A CIRCULAR LETTER TO THE SEVERAL PETITIONING COUNTIES CITIES AND TOWNS Addressed to their respective  general Meet∣ings  against the late Proposition for a  triennial Election  of REPRESENTATIVES By GRANVILLE SHARP  SECOND EDITION  To the Gentlemen Clergy Freeholders and other Inhabitants of the  GENTLEMEN  THE last general meeting of the County of York having adopted a proposition  to shorten the duration of parliament to a term not exceeding three years  the worthy gentlemen of your own committee may probably have been induced by the laudable desire of preserving  unanimity  with that respecta∣ble county to recommend the same pro∣position for your adoption Be pleased therefore previously to consider whe∣ther it is probable that a majority of the freeholders  c  of the Yorkshire meet∣ing did really mean to prefer  triennial elections  to the ancient legal usage and constitution of  annual parliaments  or whether they may not rather have been induced to postpone the open declara∣tion of their  loyal  attachment to that an∣cient  law  for frequent parliaments  viz  every year once and more often if need be  merely through a desire to preserve the  unanimity  of their  own meeting  by yield∣ing a little for the present to the preju∣dices of a few particular gentlemen a∣mong them persons indeed of great worth and esteem in many respects and whose sentiments in general deserve the utmost attention and regard but who unhappily in this point are apt to conceive that  annual  elections and  more often if need be  would be attended with some inconveniences to  themselves  You have undoubtedly in your own county also several worthy gentlemen of fortune to whom great respect is due from  the people  on account of their known independence and steady oppo∣sition to bad measures in general who nevertheless perhaps may entertain  the same erroneous conceptions of frequent e∣lections  and therefore you can by your own feelings I mean your respect and  esteem for such worthy men more ea∣sily judge of  the effect  which the same kind of laudable influence must necessa∣rily have caused in the Yorkshire meet∣ing which is the best reason I believe that can be assigned for their having adopted that  unconstitutional  measure  You are therefore most earnestly re∣quested to consider the following plain propositions  I That though great deference and respect be certainly due to such worthy and independent gentlemen as I have described yet your condescension to them ought to have some  due limitation  II That the bounds of the  ancient parliamentary constitution  of the king∣dom ought surely to mark out  the ut∣most extent  of your compliance with the worthy part of the  aristocratical interest  III That if on the contrary your endeavours to preserve UNANIMITY  should carry you  beyond these legal bounds  you will really injure those very gentle∣men whom you wish to oblige as well as the whole  aristocratical interest  the crown the lords the country gentle∣men in general because there is but  one true common interest  which  the fun∣damental laws of the constitution alone can preserve  Consider also  IV That  unanimity  is as  baneful  in a bad measure as it is  salutary  in a good one and  V That if any  compliance  in proceed∣ings is to be made at all  for the sake of unanimity  it ought certainly to be made where a  compliance is most due  viz to the  constitutional resolutions  of a select body of intelligent gentlemen  deputed to a national conference  by freelyelected committees from a very considerable pro∣portion of the counties and most populous cities and towns in Englandto resolu∣tions which were  unanimously  agreed upon by the said  deputies  and therefore  "a compliance for the sake of unanimity"  was most justly due to  them  and the more especially as it appears that they formed their conclusions by the funda∣mental laws and usages of the constitu∣tion  The deputies in their memorial declare that  shortening the duration of the sitting of parliament can only be done  CONSISTENTLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION  or with the best policy in any enlarged view  BY SHORT∣ENING IT TO THE PERIOD OF A YEAR  And this they farther explain in the words of the old statutes  viz  that a parliament should be holden  ONCE  every year and  MORE OFTEN  if need be  from whence it is manifest that  the longest duration consistent with the constitution is the period of one single session  even though two or more such sessions should be necessary in  one  or  the same  year  The striking similarity also of  this deputation  in many respects to an anci∣ent example of a  national deputation  from all the counties cited on this occasion by lord Carysfort  See page of his lordship's very judicious and  loyal  letter to the committee of the county of Huntingdon  from Hoveden adds great weight to the resolutions in ques∣tion as well as to the importance of that  unanimity  with which they were formed  VI That the members of the late depu∣tation have  unanimously  declared in their  memorial that  annual parliaments  are the  ancient constitution  of this kingdom and the  birthright of Englishmen  and in the three last paragraphs of their  memo∣rial  which are highly worthy your most careful attention have not only proved that the old  laws  requiring  a par∣liament to be holden every year once and more often if need be  meant a  new  parliament  every year c  by the instan∣ces of writs issued  two or three times in the same year for new elections  but they also prove from the experience of former ages that these  very frequent elec∣tions  were  not  attended with any such in∣conveniences as the advocates for long parliaments commonly pretend but on the contrary recommend them  "as consistent with the greatest peace" c    The fact is say the deputies from the several peti∣tioning counties  c  during the whole of that reign king Edw III and for the first eighteen years of the following one writs were annually issued and in some instances two or three times in the same year for new elections till Richard II made himself absolute And various were the occasions in those times when the commons gave for answer to any new propositions of magnitude that THEY DARED NOT AGREE WITH∣OUT CONFERENCE WITH THEIR COUNTRIES At what period then was it that the consent of the people was asked and obtained to so momentous a proposal as that of divesting them of their expected controul over their representatives in fact of changing the terms on which the delegation had passed from their hands AN∣NUAL PARLIAMENTS are therefore the ANCIENT CONSTITUTION of England and the BIRTHRIGHT of Englishmen  Nor are they less beneficial in policy than unalienable in right In the language of ancient times before the prejudices of habit had thrown false colours over names and things  they were ever described as consistent with the greatest peace and most peaceably conducted  And in par∣liamentary records for more than two hundred years together from Hen III till Edw IV we find not so much as  one  double return nor more than two or three instances of elections questioned on any ground a circumstance surely most inviting when put in contrast with that multitude of perplexing enquiries which of late years hath consumed so much time in committees to the great hindrance of the national business The plain reason is founded not in the time but in the na∣ture of the thing the duration of the seat was not an object for a violent contest This will also dispel the objection arising from the probability of tumult and ex∣pensiveness to remove which it will farther contribute not a little if we would give attention to what passes now among those large bodies of electors who annual∣ly choose their corporate officers But the argument a∣gainst corruption surmounts every thing else Nothing can give so much assurance of defeating it as this limita∣tion A seat for three years might induce a man's at∣tention to a bribe He that sits but for one is very un∣likely to experience such an offer or will certainly re∣ject it if he would not wish to put all his future expec∣tations to an imminent risque  When once the constitution of parliament is improved in these leading points every thing else that may ap∣pear to have its share in reformation must be subordi∣nate in its class and must follow in its time And the more effectually to insure these we entreat you nei∣ther at the next or any future election to engage your support to any candidate before you are satisfied that he will give his assistance in parliament to the esta∣blishment of so much of these reforms as may not then be accomplished  And therefore you are desired to consi∣der  VII That the Yorkshire proposition for shortening  the duration of parlia∣ments to a term not exceeding three years  is totally different from the  shortening of duration  explained and re∣commended by the said deputies as  the ancient constitution of the kingdom and the birthright of Englishmen  and what is worse has been adopted without the least mention of that  birthright  in any saving clause to assert and preserve your just claim to it for a  future  time where∣by it is manifest that the promoters of this  triennial  scheme have really been  the first  offenders  against that desirable  unanimity  which the conference of deputies was in∣tended to effect and therefore the cry of  "necessary unanimity"  by which alone that  unconstitutional  proposition is at pre∣sent recommended deserves not the least attention What would you be  unani∣mous  against the ancient legal parliamen∣tary constitution of the kingdom which the  triennial  scheme is manifestly calcu∣lated to supplant You ought never to forget  VIII That the people have already been betrayed by a  triennial  parliament That the  representatives  of the people in a  triennial  parliament usurped the le∣gislative authority of their constituents for a longer time than it was delegated and treacherously presumed  without con∣sulting their countries  to prolong the duration of parliaments to the present unreasonable term of  seven  years where∣by  by they established the basis of that de∣testable system of corruption which has been the true source of all your present grievances And therefore be pleased to consider  IX That  triennial  parliaments as well as  septennial  are manifestly dangerous to the state and so grossly inconsistent with the ancient legal parliamentary con∣stitution of this kingdom that the most essential  laws  and  usages  by which that constitution is declared and known are really  suspended  by them You cannot therefore without notorious  disloyalty  in the strictest sense of the word adopt the proposition for  triennial  parliaments so that you have a most ample excuse for not concurring with a few particular gentle∣men whom you would otherwise wish to oblige  viz  that your  compliance  with them in this matter would exceed the  constituti∣onal  bounds of condescension mentioned  in the three first propositions and would really tend to subvert the people's just right  to more frequent elections  Be∣cause it is manifest  X That the  concession  of a popular right made by the people themselves in their collective capacity at their several countymeetings is infinitely more bind∣ing upon them to exclude any future claim to the ceded right than the same  concession  would be if made merely by their  representatives  in parliament with∣out the instruction or concurrence of the people And therefore you ought to be particularly thankful  XI That the people themselves the great body of constituents have never yet by any such  concession  betrayed that valuable  birthright  as the deputies call it the ancient  law  for  annual  parlia∣ments It has too often been  suspended  indeed sometimes through the  disloyalty  of kings and lastly even by the  disloyalty  of parliament itself of which the tyran∣nical  triennial  and  septennial  acts are la∣mentable instances yet as the  suspen∣sion  of it has never been promoted by the requisition or instruction of the peo∣ple at large their right to it remains in∣tire The presumption and treachery of their representatives in consenting to the  triennial  and  septennial  acts cannot in∣jure their just title to it because in both these instances the representatives pre∣sumed to act contrary to an established rule of parliament by adopting a  new device  which even affected a fundamen∣tal law of the kingdom  without con∣sulting their countries  which the con∣stitution absolutely requires in such an important case so that even that unwar∣rantable presumption of the representa∣tives in neglecting to consult the people is the very circumstance which still pre∣serves  that fundamental and essential law  as a part of the constitution  and as a just right of the people which they are en∣titled to demand and resume whenever they shall be pleased to instruct their re∣presentatives for that purpose and to charge all persons with  disloyalty  and e∣ven  treason to the constitution  who shall dare to oppose them But if on the contrary the  people themselves in their several countycourts  or  assemblies  should be so inconsiderate or so depraved as to consent indiscriminately to the proposi∣tion for a  triennial  election without a sa∣ving clause to assert their  birthright  and reserve their title to more frequent elec∣tions which the Yorkshire meeting has unwarily done know for a certainty  XII That in such an unhappy inat∣tention to their own rights which I pray to God they may never be cursed with they would  betray  the constitution  of the kingdom they would betray a fundamental  law  of their ancestors which would mark their character with an eternal stain of  disloyalty  And as they may perhaps never have again so fa∣vourable an opportunity as the present of recovering their ancient birthright of  annual elections  it would probably be lost irretrievably lost for ever Your new triennial representatives in such a case would most likely behave as former triennial representatives have heretofore done  betray and enslave you by another septennial system of corruption  And what is worse you yourselves would  most justly deserve it  But I hope better things of you and I trust also that you will excuse the seve∣rity of my expressions in this address as being prompted merely by an ardent zeal for your prosperity  Old
