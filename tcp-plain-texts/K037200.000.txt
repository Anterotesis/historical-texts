 FALSE IMPRESSIONS  A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS PERFORMED  At the Theatre Royal Covent Garden  BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND ESQ  Saepe etiam audacem fugat hoc terretque poëtam  Quod numero plures virtute et honore minores  Indocti stolidique et depugnare parati  Si discordet eques media inter carmina poscunt  Aut ursum aut pugiles his nam plebecula gaudet  London  PRINTED FOR C DILLY IN THE POULTRY  Price    s    PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr MURRAY  THE time hath been but in a barbarous age  When poets brav'd their audience from the stage  Poets pontifical whose lofty tone  Acknowledg'd no tribunal but their own  And sent their Prologuepurveyor to raise  First fruits and fines of tributary praise  Our modern bards are taught an humbler strain  And if less valiant are not half so vain  No longer aim the nation's taste to lead  Content if they can follow and succeed  Thus if the time should come when in the place  Of Nature you shou'd substitute grimace  Fatal reverse What cou'd the Poet do  Offend the many to appease the few  No if in Greece true taste had been as scarce  The Stagyrite himself had stood for farce  If wit thro' five long acts will not hold out  Momus must help to stir the laugh about  And when you crown his mummery with applause  You bribe him to transgress the drama's laws  He were a very wild romantic elf  Who only wrote to figure on the shelf  To hear his own sad sentiments rebound  Thro' empty galleries with a dying sound  And sit like Seneca in calm decay  Watching how life steals drop by drop away  No let him take his profit and his ease  And trifle on so long as trifles please  Too weak to struggle against fashion's tide  If with the current he's content to glide  He only yields as Caesar did before  When Tiber's torrent drove him from the shore  The simple tale we have to tell this night  Shews truth triumphant over ranc'rous spite  Casts in dark shades the base defamer's part  And crowns with just reward the liberal heart  Oh might our efforts gain their wisht for end  The gay to' amuse the faulty to amend  Make fiction rule her thoughts by nature's laws  And wit exert her powers in virtue's cause  Then and then only might we claim applause

Scud  Aye aye leave your cause and quit your company  Exeunt  SCUD  and  ALGERNON  SIMON SINGLE JENNY SCUD  Jenny  Welcome welcome my good friend  Simon  Glad to see you pretty Mrs Jane  Jenny  So you are taking your rounds this fair morning Mr Simon  Simon  Better take them than Jerry's doses  Jenny  I agree with you  Simon  So wou'd not they perhaps  Jenny  And how are all cronies at the castle How does the venerable virgin Mrs Buckram  pretty Rachel Williams and the rest of the fair nuns  Simon  Name 'em not you have not left your fellow What is Rachel Williams a baby  Jenny  Well but Mrs Buckramshe is no baby  Simon  No o' my word she is of the race of the Anakims  Jenny  No matter for that friend Simon you'll marry Buckram  Simon  No no that buckram shall never stick in my skirts Harapha of Gath wou'dn't marry her I am no knighterrant to encounter giants  Jenny  I shou'd think so for if you were a true knight you wou'd not sleep before you had set free your lovely prisoner Emily Fitzallan  Simon  There's one acoming will do that Fair Emily will be a wife before you'll be a widow Young Montrath is the man for her he's expected every day with his uncle Sir Oliver It is all agreed upon and my lady's whole fortune will be settled on Miss Emily There's a start for youthere's a sally from dependance to prosperity from wanting every thing to possessing all  Jenny  And nothing left to Harry Algernon  Simon  Yes patience if he possesses it and an illname whether he merits it or not  Jenny  Well I can't see the justice of all this  Simon  Who can where lawyer Earling is concerned That puppy of an attorney lords it over the whole castle and now we are in the bustle of setting out Miss Emily in a stile before Sir Oliver arrives There are fine dresses to be made fine  apartments to be furnished and fresh servants to be hir'd for the heiress  Jenny  Say you so fresh servants Are you full If not I can recommend you such a lacqueythe very man of menJerry shall bring him to you  Simon  Bring him yourself lead him over in a white bridle and let me judge of his points and his paces  Jenny  You shallmy life for your's Miss Emily will be charm'd with him  Simon  Adieu time flies when I am with you Once more adieu I shall expect you I hope you are happy with your little doctor but I must think you were much too fine a flower to be pluckt by an apothecary and stuck into a gallipot  Exit  Jenny  He's off you may come out of your hiding hole the coast is clear  Enter  ALGERNON  followed by  SCUD  Alg  Now my fair advocate what have you done for me Is there any hope  Jenny  Of the old lady's fortune none your aunt has not left you a shilling  Alg  I'm glad of it  Scud  I wonder why  Jenny  Miss Emily is to have the whole  Alg  I'm sorry for it  Scud  I wonder wherefore  Alg  I'll tell you then Had my aunt bequeath'd to me her fortune she wou'd have probably restricted me from marrying Emily having given it to Emily she has doubtless tied her up from marrying me Had she done neither one nor the other I have enough to maintain her and the prize had been my own  Jenny  And so she shall I've a project for your meeting  Alg  I doubt if I ought to seek it  Scud  Very true lay it aside altogether it will bring a plaguy deal of mischief upon me and do no good to you  Alg  Tell it me however  Jenny  You'll comprehend it at once There is a proper valet to be hir'd for the heiress fit to wait upon her person and grace the back of her chair at table  Alg  I can't do it I am not equal to the task I can't approach so near and yet refrain When she spoke to me I shou'd be lost when she look'd on me I shou'd betray myself and when I handed her the plate I should present it on my knee  Scud  Aye then you wou'd be vollied out of the window and I kick'd out of the doors Now silly Jenny what's become of your project  Alg  Hold there tho' dangerous in the extreme it is not altogether desperate If I cannot undertake the offices you describe I may yet present myself as a candidate for her service and in that character perhaps obtain an interview with my charmer That hope is worth an effort  Scud  It isn't worth a farthing and will be pounds and pounds out of my way Cursed scrape foolish Jenny cursed scrape  Alg  But where shall I get a proper dress to appear in  Scud  No where you can't appear at all  Jenny  Fear nothing I'll provide you with a dress  Scud  Egad she has a provision for every thing  Alg  Who but must conquer that is armed by the fair There is a rascal in the family Earling by name who has slanderously defam'd me I'll wring his ears from his head  Scud  Take care Earling is an attorney and if he has any ears you will pay for wringing them if he has none you'll be puzzled to lay hold of them  Alg  Come Jerry I see what staggers you you are afraid of losing the old lady's custom  Scud  You are right I am She takes physic and you take pleasure  Alg  Mark me I'll not promise you to swallow as many medicines as she does but come what will I'll guarantee you against all losses incurr'd on my account so fear nothing but come on Discretion I can't boast of but in honour I will never be found wanting  Scud  That's enough that's enough Deal upon honour and I am with you I love to do a good natur'd action when there's nothing to be lost by it  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to an Apartment in Lady  CYPRESS's  Castle  Lady  CYPRESS  Lawyer  EARLING  Lady Cyp  Enter enter Mr Earling you come upon a wish  Earl  Ever prompt to approve myself your ladyship's most devoted and most absolute humble servant upon a wish I come upon a word I vanish  Lady Cyp  I am satisfied with your diligence you may spare yourself the trouble of describing it  Earl  I am dumb  Lady Cyp  Have you the memorandums about you that I dictated  Earl  If my tears have not defac'd them Believe me gracious lady when I saw my own name set down to a bequest so munificent I was cover'd with blushes I was choak'd with gratitude  Lady Cyp  Out with it then out with your name if such is the effect and write in Algernon's I warrant gratitude will not choak him  Earl  Good very good Your ladyship has the gift of rallying me in the most pleasant way out of my metaphors Choak is a figure somewhat of the strongest  Lady Cyp  Why yes and I shou'd think you may venture upon the legacy and risque the effects of it so copy out your paper when you please  Earl  I'll set my clerks upon it out of hand  Lady Cyp  You'll set the world upon it when I'm out of it for you have totally cashier'd Harry Algernon and he is the son of my sister  Earl  And your sister was the wife of his father and his father was your unremitting persecutor who vex'd you with a suit in chancery for ten long years and ten might have been added to ten had it not been that II speak modestly of myself I am no egotistI speak simply of number one and nobody else for your barrister was a cypher  Lady Cyp  But a cypher put to number one adds no trifle to its value so the upshot is you gain'd the suit and I paid the costsa victory little to be enviedand after all is it just and equitable the son should suffer for the father's faults  Earl  O jus et aequum as if he had not faults enough of his own to warrant your exclusion of him  Lady Cyp  I have heard enough of his faults I confess if you are correct in describing them If you have deceiv'd me  Earl  I I deceive you I defame your nephew I who have never spoke of his offences but with regret and sorrow never brought a story to your ears but with the view of intercepting malice and softening down impressions I deceive you then where is truth and virtue  Lady Cyp  Both in sight as I shou'd hopefor Emily appears  EMILY FITZALLAN  enters  Earl  I humbly take my leave Miss Emily I'm your'sHumph not a word Your faithful friend to serve you Not a look Upstart I'll marry the old lady and cut her out of every shillingI will  Exit  EARLING  Lady Cyp  Approach my dear Come near me I must talk with you Well You have been to see the apartment I have newly furnishedand do you like it Emily  Emily  'Tis elegant in the extreme'tis sumptuous  Lady Cyp  'Tis your's my dear it is to grace my Emily that I have deck'd it out  Emily  For me such finery  Lady Cyp  Child of my heart for you All I possess is your's  Emily  I hope you will not tempt me to forget that I was poor and humble  Lady Cyp  I hope not nature has endow'd you with admirable qualities prosperity I trust will not pervert them It does not quite come on you by surprize you cou'd not well suppose I shou'd adopt the son of my most unrelenting persecutor  Emily  I did not dare to reason in that case  Lady Cyp  But you must know how worthless in himself how undeserving of my favour is he who in respect of consanguinity is the only person that cou'd supersede you  Emily  You speak of Mr Algernon  Lady Cyp  I do I speak of him whom no one speaks of but with reproach and scorn  Emily  I do confess I've heard much evil speaking but 'twas from one who shou'd have more respect for truth and decency than to traduce the nephew to the aunt  Lady Cyp  What do you mean Wou'd you defend a libertine  Emily  No madam I defend no libertine but you will not be angry if I avow that I detest a libeller If he who thus has poison'd your opinion knows not the character the manners habits sentiments connections perhaps not even the outward form and feature of the man whose fame he mangles can I be to blame if I implore you for the love of justice to hear before you strike  Lady Cyp  What is this Emily What is this warmth  Emily  Honest not prudent out of time and place but still sincere tho' rash  Lady Cyp  You call on me to hear before I strike I now demand if you that strike have heard  Do you know Algernon Have you convers'd with him  Emily  Madam I have  Lady Cyp  You have when where he comes not hither never was admitted never will be within these doors Astonishing that you shou'd dare to tell me you have made acquaintance with this profligate  Emily  Hear my defenceYou gave me leave to pass a little time for change of air after my late confinement at your Hillfarm One evening I had rambled about a mile from home when upon entering a little copse thro' which my footpath led judge of my horror when a villain such I must call him surpriz'd me seiz'd me and in spite of cries prayers and entreaties  Lady Cyp  Merciful providence what do you tell me  Emily  A dreadful tale I shou'd have had to tell or died ere I cou'd tell it had not heaven sent me a rescue a brave brave preserver who with a soul all fire and motion quick as lightning sprung on the assailant grasp'd him in his arms and after a contention furious tho' short hurl'd him to the ground breathless and maim'd with bruises Which of these merits the name of  profligate  Not be that sav'd meIt was Algernon  Lady Cyp  Algernon do you say My worthless nephew Algernon Take care  Emily  Renounce me if I tell you an untruth  Lady Cyp  I'm all astonishment Who was the assailant  Emily  Madam I know not Your heroic  nephew bore me half dead and fainting to my house 'twas not till then I knew him to be Algernon He staid with me no longer than till the care of the good people had recovered me the next morning I return'd to the castle fearing to remain any longer in so solitary a place Of Algernon I saw no more Now suffer me to ask is this the conduct of a profligate  Lady Cyp  'Tis a strange story  Emily  'Tis a true one madam  Lady Cyp  Why have you kept it to yourself thus long You've been return'd two days  Emily  Because until this hour I have not seen your spirits in a state to bear the slightest agitation  Lady Cyp  And do you think the agitation slight that I now suffer No I see your danger Emily I see your weak credulity and much I fear you'll find yourself the dupe of Algernon What business cou'd he have at my Hillfarm  Emily  Madam your tenant's wife nurs'd Mr Algernon  Lady Cyp  She never shou'd have nurs'd you Emily or harbour'd you one moment had I known it  Emily  That's hard but I must suffer and be silent  Lady Cyp  Be silent then and go to your chamber there you may meditate on what you have been and call to mind with timely recollection what you may be again  END OF ACT I  ACT II  Caste Hall  SIMON SINGLE  Farmer  GAWDRY  and his Son  ISAAC  Simon  MASTER Gawdry Master Gawdry have I not

nothing then you don't believe it  Earl  Pardon me madam I believe it happened just as Miss Emily relates it to you I do believe there was a man set on to frighten her and that he took a drubbing from her hero for which I also perfectly believe he was well paid  Lady Cyp  Why shou'd you not suppose it might be real there are such drunken fellows up and down  Earl  But sober men will not be taken in by such stale tricks You meet the same or something very like it in even paltry novel that you read The man's escap'd you'll never hear of him his bargain was not made to go to prison  Lady Cyp  I see

vulgar nameand so far as appearances bespeak no vulgar person Well Henry Scudamore you want a place  Alg  I wish to serve your ladyship  Lady Cyp  Have you been in service  Alg  Never  Lady Cyp  So I shou'd guess What leads you now to seek it  Alg  The ambition of belonging to your ladyship but I wou'd answer more directly might I presume  Lady Cyp  I understand you Simon leave the room  Exit  SIMON  You seem embarrass'd Was it not your wish to speak to me in private  Alg  Madam it was  Lady Cyp  And what have you to impart that one who possibly may be your fellow servant might not be privy to  Alg  Madam I am a gentleman by birth that being known amongst my fellow servants might chance to raise an evil mind against me and make my humble station painful to me your candour will not think the worse of me because I am unfortunate  Lady Cyp  No not the worse in charity of thought but I cannot employ you in my service No gentleman must wait upon that lady to whom I else perhaps had destin'd you No gentleman at least of your appearance  Alg  I'm sorry for itbut it is my fate to be judg'd by appearances and condemn'd by reports  Lady Cyp  If you have fallen into this decay by mere misfortune or injurious treatment I can pity you nay Henry Scudamore if that's your name and if I knew your story which at present I have not time to hear I cou'd do moreI cou'd and something whispers me I wou'd consider your necessities and help you  Alg  I am the victim madam of a villain My story is soon told for it is founded on a simple fact which I can make appear to full conviction if you will condescend to give me hearing and suffer me to state such evidence as cannot be oppos'd by my defamer  Lady Cyp  I know not what to say to that young man I have no strength to spare for other's burthens and am already loaded with my own even to the breaking down of my weak frame If 'tis a case of pity I've a hand that's open to your wants without enquiry if it is matter of grievance and redress I wou'd recommend you to state it to my lawyer Mr Earling and he shall see you righted  Alg  I humbly thank you I will state it to him and trust the goodness of your heart will see me righted  Lady Cyp  Ah I've no heart no health no nerves to hear you You must excuse me Henry  Scudamore I dare not undertake to arbitrate but wait Sir Oliver Montrath's arrival and he shall hear you he's a noble gentleman  Alg  Where shall I wait the whilst  Lady Cyp  Where Let me seeyes you may stay this night here in the castle My old servant Simon will entertain you at the second table Does that content you  Alg  I were most unthankful if it did not  Lady Cyp  Follow me then and I will give my orders  Exeunt  EMILY's  Apartment  EMILY FITZALLAN RACHEL WILLIAMS  Emily  Rachel  Rachel  Madam what are your commands  Emily  Don't answer me in that stile I have so long been a dependant and liv'd in such familiarity with you my good Rachel in particular that tho' you are my servant I don't wish you to use a language to me so submissive  Rachel  Whatever language you wou'd have me use so it will but convey the same respect I will endeavour to conform to it  Emily  I wou'd fain keep upon such terms with fortune that I may fall back to my former poverty without a pang therefore if ever you perceive me giddy with prosperity recal my recollection to the low situation I emerg'd from and do it honestly my girl don't spare me  Rachel  You'll want no monitor to warn you against pride and yet as you require sincerity there is one warning I conceive is needful just at this crisis  Emily  State it without reserve  Rachel  Are you not now in danger of incurring your patroness's most severe displeasure  Emily  Perhaps I am but be explicit with me  Rachel  Your champion Algernon has he not left a thorn in that soft heart  Emily  If you call gratitude a thorn he has  Rachel  Are you quite sure 'tis only gratitude May it not soon be love Nay give me leave is it not love already  Emily  Well if it is how can I strive against it  Rachel  Prudence will tell you how  Emily  Prudence will tell me an old gossip's tale but who that is in love will hear her out  Rachel  Are you aware how fatal it will be to all your expectations if my lady discovers your attachment  Emily  Are you aware how natural it is to love the man who saves you from destruction My lady gives me riches Algernon rescues my life and honour I was lost but for his courage I am only poor without her bounty and if she demands that I shou'd sacrifice my heart's affections she makes conditions that I cannot grant nor wou'd her fortune bribe me to the attempt  Rachel  Do you know Mr Algernon's character  Emily  Does he that blackens it What does my lady know but what that lawyer instils into her ear Infamous man And why does he defame him why but because he may retain his power in the estate and garbel it at pleasure Besides he has an ample legacy believe me I hold it a disgrace to read my name in the same page with his nor wou'd I be his partner in the crime of plundering  Algernon but that I live in hopes the time will come when I may render back the unlawful spoil  Rachel  Then temporize the whilst my dearest lady or that time never will be your's  Emily  'Tis right you counsel well and now I will confide a secret to you I have warn'd Algernon who is his enemy and what base stories have been forg'd against himAh who is this 'Tis he 'tis he himself  ALGERNON  enters  Alg  Hush not so loud  Emily  Your name was on my lips How came you here How did you gain admission and what have you in view by this disguise You may disclose this friendly girl is secret  Alg  Then let her stay I wou'd not be surpriz'd in private with you I am here by sufferance of Lady Cypress I have seen my aunt for the first time convers'd with her and lodg'd a plea for further hearing when her friend Sir Oliver Montrath shall be at leisure one of his servants is already come he may be soon expected  Emily  And his nephew does he accompany him  Alg  I did not ask that question of the servant but if you wish it I will make the enquiry  Emily  No let it pass I know your aunt expects himHark Rachel somebody is at the door see who it is  Rachel  Madam there's nobody nor any sound that I can hear  Emily  Stand where you are and listenWhat is the meaning of this dress you wear  Alg  I put it on to counterfeit a servant or I shou'd rather say to ask for serviceWill you not  try me Emily don't take my character from that attorney I'll serve you honestly  Emily  You serve you're jesting  Alg  Am I not your servant I am your faithful servant  Emily  My heroic preserverthat is your rightful character and by that title you have a claim upon my gratitude which only can expire with life and now inform me what you have in view by this adventure  Alg  I am not so romantic as to think I can maintain my post longer than till tomorrow to which time I have a furlough by authority if fortune stands my friend I may effect something within that period but even now am I not supremely blest to see you hear you and behold that face that was of late so pale and wan with terror restor'd to all the lustre of its charms  Emily  That face assure yourself will never be turn'd from you to league with those who seek to rob you of your fame and fortune  Alg  I am not robb'd of what enriches you  Emily  The heart that swells with indignation against all that wrong you had but for you been cold and motionless  Alg  Oh Emily forbear  Emily  This and no moreI never will be made the slave of interest or dupe of slander My confidence in you cannot be shaken my obligations cannot be computed The life that I possess is of your givingWhat can I say but that I live for you Now leave me Henry not a word

Lady Cyp  Time has gone lightly over you my friend You that have travers'd sea and land are whole I that have tempted neither am become a shatter'd wreck on shore  Sir Oliv  Not so not altogether so thank heaven Time is a surly guest whose courtesy does not improve by long acquaintance with us but we'll not rail at him since he permits us once more to meetAnd here's the same old castle still unspoilt by modern foppery aye and the same old grand sires firm in their frames with not one wrinkle more than when I parted from them years ago  Lady Cyp  Aye years indeedbut you have fill'd them up with glory your's has been a life of themes for future history a field of laurels to adorn your tombmine has been tame and simple vegetation  Sir Oliv  I have liv'd a soldier's life but heaven  be thank'd I've plunder'd no nabob stript no rajah of his pearls and pagodas nor have I any blood upon my sword but what a soldier's honour may avowbut you have here a relict of my gallant comrade major Antony Fitzallan He was wounded by my side carried off the field and died in my arms With his last breath he bequeath'd 'twas all he had to bestow a blessing to his daughter and charg'd me if I liv'd to come to England to thank you for your charity and be a friend to her  Lady Cyp  I trust you'll find her worthy of your friendship  Sir Oliv  Is she good is she amiable Has she her father's principles her mother's purity  Lady Cyp  See her and judge she's naturally sincerebut where's your nephew where is Mr Lionel I reckon'd with much pleasure upon seeing him  Sir Oliv  Ah my good lady there I am unfortunate I had built upon the hopes of presenting him to you but it cannot be at present Poor Lionel is indispos'd and must bear his disappointment with what philosophy he can  Lady Cyp  The disappointment is reciprocala little time I hope will bring him to us  Sir Oliv  I wish it maybut look who comes  Lady Cypr  This is my orphan chargeThis is our Emily  EMILY FITZALLAN  enters  Sir Oliv  The very image of her lovely mother  Lady Cyp  My dear this is Sir Oliver Montrath mine and your father's friend as such you'll honour him  Sir Oliv  As such I claim the privilege to embrace and press her to my heart My child my charge devolv'd upon me by a father's legacy when breathing out his gallant soul in prayers and blessings for his Emily  Emily  Oh sir was you was you beside him at that dreadful moment  Sir Oliv  I was my child these arms supported him cover'd with wounds and crown'd with victoryalas how dearly purchas'd  Emily  Then let his last commands be ever sacred if you have any such in charge to give me impart them I conjure you  Sir Oliv  I have none but blessings to impart In fortune's gifts the hero had no share in virtue's he abounded In the care of this your generous benefactress he had left you to that and heaven's protection he bequeath'd you  Emily  I am content and what before I ow'd in gratitude to this beneficent and noble lady I now will pay with filial obedience and duty superadded Suffer me dearest madam from this moment to call myself your daughter  Lady Cyp  As such I have adopted you remember now my child the duty you have taken on yourself the authority you have consign'd to me All rights parental center now in me your happiness your credit your establishment are trusts for which I am responsibleYou have no other task but to obey  Emily  Obedience madam has its limitations but such as I would render to my father I'll pay to you Have I your leave to withdraw  Lady Cyp  You may my dear your spirits seem to need itGo and compose yourself  Exit  EMILY  Sir Oliv  Exquisite creature I'm enchanted with her By heaven 'twould be the heighth of my ambition the object I have most at heart in life to see my LionelOh that I cou'dhere kneeling at her feetBorn of such parents train'd by such instructions and grac'd with charms so lovely Emily without a fortune is a match for princes  Lady Cyp  If such is your disinterested wish and greater happiness I could not pray for I trust my fortune thrown into her scale will not make her appear less worthy of your nephew or cause you to retract your good opinion  Sir Oliv  No surely but I doubt if I should wish your fortune to go out of the right channel even to Emily We that have never married should regard our nephews as our sons  Lady Cyp  But does affinity impose on me an obligation to bestow my property on one that merits nothing to the wrong of her that merits all  Sir Oliv  Is that the character of Algernon Is he so undeserving  Lady Cyp  Ah there my friend there is my terror the destiny I dread the man of all men living the most dangerous to my peace is Algernon  Sir Oliv  Indeed  Lady Cyp  Preserve my Emily from himsave her from Algernon  Sir Oliv  Is Algernon then born to be a curse to both of us  Lady Cyp  Explain yourself  Sir Oliv  He is your nephew therefore I was silent but if he's dangerous to your peace of mind to mine he's fatalin one word the wound of which my hapless Lionel now languishes was given by the hand of Algernon  Lady Cyp  Horrible wretchhis murderer  Sir Oliv  I say not that for modern courtesy gives not that name to duellists and honour sanctifies their bloody deeds  Lady Cyp  Away with all such honour Truth disavows it nature revolts from it religion denounces itOh he is born to be my shame and torment  Sir Oliv  Be patient for a while suspend your judgment  Lady Cyp  No I regard a duellist with horror I hold him as an agent of the enemy of mankind sent to disturb society and rend the parent's and the widow's hearts asunder one action one only action and that a doubtful one had met my ear in favour of that wretch whom I call nephew and henceforth even that one I totally discredit and renounce him  Sir Oliv  Hold I conjure you In the midst of wrath let us remember justice I like you abhor a duellist profest yet I am taught by long experience how to make allowances for younger spirits and warmer passions that will not submit to meet the world's contempt and scorn its prejudices  Lady Cyp  Away you talk this language by profession reason declares against it  Sir Oliv  Reason demands that we should pause  in judgment When two men draw their swords upon each other reason will tell us one must be to blame but ere we six the blame upon that one justice decrees that we should hear them both  Lady Cyp  What says your nephew He will speak the truth  Sir Oliv  I should expect he would yet I'll not wholly trust to any man's report against another in his own cause and in this sentiment my nephew honourably coincides for he declines all answer to my questions and will state nothing to affect or criminate his antagonistHah who is this  ALGERNON  enters  Lady Cyp  Go go I did not send for you  Alg  I know it but I wish to speak in private with Sir Oliver Montrath  Sir Oliv  With me Who is this man I do not know him Is he one of your ladyship's domestics  Lady Cyp  No he made offer of his services but upon talking with him I perceiv'd he had a list of grievances to state and not being then at leisure I believe I told him he might wait your coming and make his suit to you  Sir Oliv  And so he mayhis looks plead in his cause Is it your wish to speak with me young man  Alg  It is  Sir Oliv  Alone  Alg  Alone if you'll permit it  Sir Oliv  Freely and when I can command my time it shall be your's I'll call for you  Alg  I shall attend your summons  Exit  ALGERNON  Sir Oliv  I'm curious what this man can have to tell me Do you conjecture  Lady Cyp  There is a mystery about him He says he is a gentleman by birth and so far I believe him Of what he had to tell besides I wav'd the hearing but offer'd him relief that did not seem his object nor was it mine to take a gentleman into my service But you will know the wholeshall we adjourn and see what is become of Emily  Sir Oliv  With all my heart and hope the mournful subject of our last interview may be no more reviv'd  Exeunt

what misery that wicked man has brought upon us all  Emily  I'm sorry for Sir Oliver's misfortune  Lady Cyp  I hope you have also pity for the sufferer  Emily  I trust I have for all that merit it  Earl  I'm sure Mis's Emily will not attempt to extenuate the guilt of such an action  Emily  You may be sure I never will defend a guilty person knowing him for such be you as careful how you criminate an absent man till you have proofs against him  To Sir  OLIVER  Sir you are silent I should wish to know if you have any thing to urge against him  Sir Oliv  Nothing my dear I'm listening with attention and therefore silent I should be sorry were you less unwilling to give up your opinion of a man who render'd you such service  Lady Cyp  What service Earling you have heard the story let us hear what you have to say upon it  Earl  If Miss Fitzallan will suffer me to put a simple question to her  Emily  By all means put your question  Earl  When Mr Algernon by happy chance came in so opportunely to her rescue can Miss Fitzallan say what brought him thither so far from his own home  Emily  I never ask'd what caus'd him to be there nor did he tell me  Earl  We'll call it then a very happy chance without a cause or a most fortunate presentiment that somewhere in that grove there would be found a damsel in the power of some vile ruffian whom he was doom'd to rescue Some people might suppose  this a collusion but Miss Fitzallan can remove all doubts by telling us who was the villain that offer'd her that violence  Sir Oliv  Can you do this my Emily  Emily  I cannot  Earl  Did Mr Algernon know who he was  Emily  I do not think he did  Earl  Did he secure his person  Emily  No his care was wholly turn'd to me▪ the man he left upon the ground and as it seem'd disabled  Earl  I have done I leave it to the court to judge  Lady Cyp  A barefac'd trick It is too palpable  Sir Oliv  Who can say thatLet Mr Algernon speak for himself  Earl  Speak  Sir Oliv  Aye you have spoke and should not he That's justice is it not  Earl  Did you always find it so where you have been Sir Oliver  Sir Oliv  Whether I found it so or not I felt it  Emily  Now Mr Earling you may put those questions you've press'd on me to Mr Algernon Perhaps he'll answer them  Lady Cyp  Emily Emily you forget yourself  Emily  Madam I should if I forbore to speak when charges such as these are urg'd against an absent therefore a defenceless man You have not allow'd him to approach you madam this gentleman equally unknown to him prejudges him at once he is ingenious to find out bad motives for good actions there's not a virtue in the human  heart but may be metamorphos'd by such cunning into a vice Sir Oliver has said and said it in the language of a hero  Let Mr Algernon speak for himself  Sir Oliv  And I repeat those wordsLet him be heardHowever circumstances bear against him and wretched tho' he has made me still I hold it matter of conscience never to prejudge however strong the grounds of my suspicion  Lady Cyp  Sir Oliver we do not think alike and therefore with your leave we'll cut this subject short Emily will retirea little recollection will be useful to shew the error of some rash opinions and amend them Go child remember I have now a right to look for the obedience of a daughter  Emily  And I to expect the mildness of a mother  Exit  Lady Cyp  And now Sir Oliver with your permission I will dispatch a little business with my agent and leave you to fulfil your promise to that young man who I perceive is waiting to approach you Follow me Mr Earling  Exeunt Lady  CYPRESS  and  EARLING  Sir Oliv  See here a sample of the blessings of dependancePoor orphan Emily 'tis now my turn to prove that I am worthy to be call'd friend of thy gallant father  ALGERNON  appears  Oh come in come in young man I promis'd you a hearing and I'll make good my word but as my mind is press'd with many matters be short and to the point  Alg  I will Your nephew has had an affair with Mr Algernon and is wounded You have visited him no doubt Has he related to you the particulars of that unpleasant business  Sir Oliv  Before I answer let me know who it is that questions me  Alg  My father lives upon the lands of Sir George Algernon and I have some acquaintance with his son the person whose unlucky chance it was to wound your nephew  Sir Oliv  And what's your motive for the question that you now put to me  Alg  I am no stranger to your character and if you know the circumstances of that duel I trust you will not suffer Mr Earling to misrepresent them to the Lady Cypress  Sir Oliver  Certainly I shou'd not if I knew the truth suffer it to be disguis'd but I have no particulars from my nephew The affair remains a mystery Can you develope it  Alg  If Lady Cypress will permit me to stay this night as she has promis'd and you can bring me to an explanation with her in your presence I can so far elucidate this mystery that if you still persist to trace it home you shall have full possession of the means  Sir Oliv  I hardly should expect it at your hands nor where my nephew's honour is concern'd shall I be easily induc'd to listen to other evidence than that of facts incontrovertibly attested and I am free to say admitted on his part  Alg  'Tis to such facts and such authorities I shall appeal  Sir Oliv  And do you mean to criminate my nephew  Alg  Pardon me sir I have no other meaning but to declare the truth  Sir Oliv  Have you the means to know it Was you present at the rencontre  Alg  If it appears that I have not the means to know the truth or knowingly disguise it treat me as I deserve I'm in your hands  Sir Oliv  Well sir I'll urge no further questions on you but use my interest with the Lady Cypress to procure you the interview you wish Now fail not on your part you know me sir I trust to you unknown  Alg  Poor as I seem I have a soul within that never yet was tainted by dishonour  Exeunt severally  END OF ACT III  ACT IV  Lady  CYPRESS EMILY FITZALLAN  and  EARLING  Lady  CYPRESS  WELL child I have here the instrument that makes you rich above the dreams of avarice I have not executed it for that depends on you I have not cancell'd it because this gentleman your steady friend has interceded with me to recal you once more to recollection and atonement  Emily  For what must I atone  Lady Cyp  For your intemperate defence of Algernon Guilty or innocent no more of him Where I bestow my fortune I expect to find no opposition to my will in the disposal of it  Emily  What is your will in that respect  Lady Cyp  This is my willIf Lionel Montrath survives his wound he is the man I destine for my heiress To this if you declare instant assent I shall as instantly confirm this paper if not I cancel it and cast you off  Emily  Not all the world cou'd bribe me to do that before I know which is the offending party What baseness what ingratitude were mine to give give my hand to him that wrong'd the brave preserver of my life and honour  Lady Cyp  Obstinate girl you have no such preserver Have not I told you it was mere collusion  Emily  Madam you have but I am not convinc'd because you told me so by your attorney not from your own knowledge and conviction  Lady Cyp  What will convince you  Emily  Proof well established and all parties heard  Lady Cyp  You to make terms that call'd yourself my daughter Where is your duty  Emily  Inviolate unbrokenI shall ever bear you respect and true devotion for your goodness but no parent no patroness not even my father to whose awful spirit I now appeal cou'd have the power or cou'd possess the right to tear away affections from my heart which honour gratitude  have planted there or force me to conspire with that bad man in stripping Algernon of fame and fortune and fixing artifice deceit and murder upon a man so near to you in blood in nature so abhorrent of those crimes  Lady Cyp  You are mad I have done with you I cast you off Now Mr Earling take away your papers they or the thankless object they allude to must be entirely chang'd before I sign them  Exit  Earl  Miss Emily it grieves me to the heart to have heard what now has pass'd Indeed you wrong me if you suppose I am the author of this fatal breach I am no otherwise the enemy of Mr Algernon than as I am your friend in very truth I'm not his enemy  Emily  Sir for your enmity to Mr Algernon and so much of your friendship as flows from it I pray you let them go together I have no use for either  Earl  Do you scorn me because I pity you  Emily  You pity me There cannot be that state of human wretchedness which cou'd reduce me to accept your pity I wonder you can waste your time with one who neither courts your favour fears your power nor credits your professions  Earl  Well haughty madam I have been a friend and I can be a foe  Exit  ALGERNON  enters  Alg  My Emily my angel what is this I've heard Discarded disinheritedand for your generosity to me  Emily  Yes Algernon I'm poor but free I was  a prisoner in a gaudy cage where they wou'd fain have taught me to call names and whistle to a tune of Earling's making but being a bad bird and obstinate my keeper let me fly and now I've got the wide world for my portion and nothing but my own small wits to trust to for picking up a living  Alg  Fly to me perch on my breast for in my heart you'll find both shelter and affection  Emily  Ah that is generous gallant like yourself but 'tis not yet a time for me to hear you The asylum that you offer is attack'd the very citadel of your life and honour is besieg'd by assailants and you must beat them off my hero or I have sacrific'd myself to ruin without the enjoyment of that honest pride which glories in the cause for which it suffers  Alg  Doubt me not Emily the shield of truth covers my breast and I'm invulnerable  Emily  Earling accuses you of a collusion with my unknown assailant in the wood  Alg  I'm arm'd against that charge  Emily  And for your wounding of Montrath he calls it assassinationThere I shou'd fear you are not so well arm'd having no seconds to appeal to and therefore more expos'd to his attack  Alg  Let him come on at all points I defy him Now my sweet advocate repose in peace and wait the event  Emily  Farewell If I am ruin'd in the cause of truth I'll not regret the sacrifice  Exit  Alg  Heroic Emily

RACHEL WILLIAMS  Lady Cyp  Come hither Rachel I wou'd speak with you When I promoted you to be about the person of Miss Emily Fitzallan it was because I saw you was attached to her and I was willing to do her a grace by thus preferring you If you must now fall back into your station it is not that I have withdrawn my favour from you but from your mistress  Rachel  I know it madam all your people know it for Mr Earling has announc'd it to us but I must beg your ladyship to excuse me if I decline all service but Miss Emily's  Lady Cyp  What shou'd enable her to keep a servant  Rachel  Then she will stand in the more need of me I'll work my fingers to the bone to serve her Your ladyship may turn me from your doors but I will say that Mr Earling's a base cruel man and when he has driven all your relations from you your ladyship will find your house a desert and nothing but a villain left within it  Exit  Lady Cyp  Out of my sight begone Such insolence is not to be endur'dyet Earling is to blame to publish this to all my family So what comes next  Mrs  BUCKRAM  enters  Buck  Madam I've serv'd your ladyship too long to bear the arrogance of Mr Earling I beg to be discharg'd I'll not live in the house with one who drives Miss Emily out of your doors tells such monstrous lies of Mr Algernon and sets your ladyship against all your friends and relations  Lady Cyp  Who made you a judge in matters that concern me only When you are cool I'll hear you I know you have been junketing and caballing with Rachel Williams and the rest of themprythee retire  Buck  That's what I mean to do and others beside me or I'm mistaken We respect your ladyship but we can't put up with your attorney  Exit  EARLING  enters whilst this is saying  Lady Cyp  There Mr Earling you hear what is said against you Murmurs complaints invectives from all quarters  Earl  No wonder when that Henry Scudamore  whom I suspect to be a secret agent of your unworthy nephew's sets them on to blacken and arraign me Madam he has had the insolence to give me the worst of names  Lady Cyp  Then give him his dismissionsend him away at once  Earl  It shall be done  Exit  EARLING  Lady Cyp  Oh that Sir

your ways get you gone a man that is in two stories shou'd be credited for neither You made him out to me a compound of all vices  Scud  That was the very vilest compound that ever came out of my hands but lawyer Earling put a lie into my mouth and like a gilded pill of loathsome quality I swallow'd it and now it makes me sick  Lady Cyp  Begone I will no longer be insulted with your apothecary's jargon Never enter my doors again  Scud  I hope your ladyship will give me leave to enter my own Oh honesty honesty it's very pleasant to speak the truth but a man is sure to lose his

Simon  Venerable lady I am not inebriated What I may be if you wall up your cellar doors and me within them I can't pretend to say I  may in that case drink to support life as I have now been tasting a glass by your permission to celebrate this mournful festival  Lady Cyp  How can it be a festival and mournful You know not what you say  Simon  Pardon me pardon me most incomparable lady A festival it must be because you are pleas'd to order us to be merryMournful it surely is because your attorney makes us sad  Lady Cyp  You see he is in my interest and you are all in league against him  Simon  No no no my lady 'tis not because he is in your interest we are leagued against him your interest has been ever dearer to me than my own If you turn me out of your doors this night I can lay my hand upon my heart and appeal to the Giver of it that I never wrong'd you of a farthing and tho' a poor servant scorn to cringe and lie and vilify an absent man as he has done Madam you are abus'd the county wou'd rise up against him if they knew what he has said of Mr Algernonso much is your nephew belov'd  Lady Cyp  Come come I know who tells you so 'tis Henry Scudamore and no one else  Simon  Pray madam be no more deceiv'd but hear and judge for yourself If it was the last word I had to utter I wou'd say and say it to his face that lawyer Earling is a falsifier and a defamer  Lady Cyp  Go stop him from discharging Henry Scudamore don't let him leave the house till I have seen him  Exeunt severally  SCENE  changes  EARLING  enters  Earl  Where is this Henry Scudamore I've hunted the whole house over for the fellow If he is not driven out before this night my post will not be tenable tomorrow we shall have Algernon brought in in triumph upon the shoulders of his partisans and all my labours blasted in a moment Hah here's the man of all men for my purpose this surly fellow has the mastiff's property shew him his prey and he will fasten on it  FRANK  enters  Come hither Frank a word with you  Frank  What is your pleasure master  Earl  Do you know a loose fellow an interloper that came to seek a place but brought no character a vagabond it shou'd seem that calls himself Henry Scudamore  Frank  Yes I know Henry Scudamore  Earl  Well honest Frank you see that he came here for no good purpose and it is not fit he shou'd be let to stay and take the bread out of the mouths of better than himself  Frank  There's bread enough for all of us methinks  Earl  What then what then you're not a man we'll hope to be afraid of such a wafer cake as he is Frank  Frank  I'm afraid of no man  Earl  Why then my hearty Frank I give you orders to turn him bodily out of this house for which I have my lady's authority  Frank  What has he done that I shou'd turn him out  Earl  He has insulted me traduc'd my character and set me at defiance  Frank  Has he done this  Earl  He has  Frank  Then let him stay for meI will not touch him I honour him for his spirit They call me surly Frank and so I am if any man affronts me but I'll be no attorney's catchpole lookye And as for turning out if that's your game there's but one man I'll do that office for and that's yourself my masterThere you have it  Exit  Earl  Impudent varlet the contagion's general if he has caught it The whole swarm's upon me and I must stand their buzzing as for their stings I'm not in fear of them so long as I can keep the queen of the hive in my possession  ALGERNON  enters  Oho I have lit upon you at last Harkye sir you Henry Scudamore whom nobody knows decamp pack up your wallet and betake

drunk for no man will drink with you you never make mistakes about your orders for you are under orders from the old one never to speak the truth and faithfully adhere to your instructions  Earl  This to my face  Simon  Oh yes I never saw a face better intitled to the compliment I only wish to see it face to face with Harry Algernon and then perhaps your face may be promoted where I may treat it with an egg or two  Alg  Go go unhappy man it can't be pleasant to hear yourself describ'd so faithfully  Earl  I'll not goI summon you before the Lady Cypressshe'll do me justiceshe'll avenge my wrongs Here comes Sir OliverI appeal to him  Sir  OLIVER  enters  Sir Oliv  What is the matter  Earl  These fellows have insulted me most grossly  Sir Oliv  You are a lawyer You have your redress  Earl  Sir 'tis above redress by any law  Sir Oliv  Then put it up and seek redress from patience That is a remedy for all complaints  Earl  I hope I've better remedies than patience I warrant I'll exterminate these insolents I'll  pluck 'em root and branch out of this house and hurl 'em to the dunghill that they sprung from  Sir Oliv  Go then and set about it Leave me sir I've business with this gentleman  Earl  This gentleman forsooth this gentleman  Exit  Simon  Well he may be a gentleman for me only he lets the bottle stand too long and takes no pity on his company that wish to give it motion that's not quite like a gentleman methinkselse he may be a sober sort of a gentlemanbut not a lordno no at least he'll never be as drunk as a lord  Exit  Sir Oliv  Now sir I've seen my nephew since we last convers'd You ask'd me then if I had been inform'd of the particulars of that rencontre and by the motives you assign'd for the enquiry I shou'd suppose you know some circumstances of that dark affair  Alg  The whole correctly  Sir Oliv  Indeed I hardly shou'd have thought that Mr Algernon wou'd have reveal'd the whole to any but his nearest and most confidential friend  Alg  Nor has he it remains still in his bosom an inviolable secret though known to me  Sir Oliv  You mean to say that secrets in your keeping are secure I have my nephew's story as you have Algernon's and shou'd be glad with your consent to compare them with each other  Alg  They cannot differ for my account is drawn up by your nephew and being sign'd by him he neither can nor will depart from it  Sir Oliv  You much amaze me sir that Mr Algernon shou'd give a paper of such consequence out of his hand I greatly wish to see it  Alg  Wou'd it relieve your mind at the same time to see and talk with Algernon himself  Sir Oliv  Oh infinitely if I cou'd obtain it  Alg  Then with a man of honour 'twou'd be mean to trifle any longerI am Algernon  Sir Oliv  HowAlgernonmay I believe you  Alg  You shall not doubt meThere's your nephew's paperNo eye but your's has seen it from my hand  Sir Oliv  SirMr AlgernonI ask your pardonI am satisfiedbut can you be unknown and in this house  Alg  I never enter'd it before this day nor to my knowledge ever saw my aunt 'till I appear'd before her in this habit which I shall now put offbut hark we shall be interrupted here Can't we retire to a more private place  Sir Oliv  To my apartmentif you'll be pleas'd to follow meAh sir ah Mr Algernon how hard to find now at the close of a long life of services all it's enjoyments all it's labours lost  END OF ACT IV  ACT V  SCENE  the Castle Hall  JERRY SCUD  and  JENNY  SCUD  WELL well well jewel Jenny here we are for the last time farewell visits to be sure are melancholy matters but we have many good friends in the castle still and tho' I am thrown out of the cabinet I have kept up my interest in the kitchen  Jenny  Aye and in the county too when it shall be known that you have forfeited my lady's favour by speaking up for Mr Algernon he is so much pitied and belov'd by all men that your neighbours will sham sick on purpose to employ you  Scud  To say the truth I have sometimes thought that was my lady's only complaint but I took care my physic should not cure her of it and my comfort is that nobody of the faculty will profit by my loss for when she leaves off my medicines she'll find herself too well to employ a doctor  Jenny  Come come Jerry she'll not leave off you nor your medicines If you can get to the speech of her a little coaxing and a submissive apology will set all things right  Scud  No no jewel Jenny she'll hear no apology and therefore I have express'd myself more at large  in my billHere it is here it isIt's a bouncer isn't it  Jenny  Yes marry if she has patience to go through this she'll find you have enough to say for yourself but I suspect Jerry this argument is a little too much on one side  Scud  Turn over the leaf and you'll find a great deal more on the other side  SIMON SINGLE  and Mrs  DOROTHY BUCKRAM  Ah my good friends my good friends this is the most doleful visit I ever made to the castle Jenny can witness I have pass'd a sleepless night that incubus of an attorney rode upon me like  he nightmare  Buck  Rode indeed Set a beggar on horseback and where will he not ride  Scud  I attempted to put a cracker under his tail but it burst in my hand and I only burnt my own fingers without singing him  Simon  Let him go the road he travels is all downhill and when he comes to his journey's end he'll find those that will put crackers enough under his tail I warrant me  Dor  As for me a jackdaw in a cage has a better life of it than I have for he may cry rogue and not be chidden for itWe shall all be turn'd away I lay my account to be sent going for one  Simon  Thirty years I have pass'd within these walls and I would sooner pass the rest of my days within the walls of a prison than live in a house where scurrility is caress'd and plain speaking turn'd out of doorsHah who comes here  ALGERNON  enters in his own Dress  Buck  Bless the good mark our HenryNo Yes sure 'tis Henry how comes this to pass  Alg  I'm order'd to attend upon my lady so I put on my best  Simon  Hark ye my friend if it is not your own bad is your best Let us have no false feathers Where did you get this suit  Alg  'Tis Harry Algernon's He and I wear the same cloaths one tailor serves us bothIsn't it true Jerry  Scud  It is it is and the same measure fits you  Simon  I don't know what you mean  Alg  Then I'll inform you Here are but two of you in company that do not know me you are both my friends my generous zealous friends for which I thank you and come in person hither to convince you that Algernon is not that worthless man which calumny has painted him to be  Buck  Heaven's grace light on you if indeed you are that injur'd gentleman  Scud  Oh by my soul he is the very man you may take that upon my word for truth  Simon  I saw it I said it I knew he was a gentleman Now we have got that attorney in a trap  Jenny  Yes yes he'll make that Earling shrink into his hole  Simon  Hang him polecat I'll smoke him out of it Oh the inconceivable lies that miscreant has told of a gentleman he does not know even by sight I pray you sir don't discover yourself to him till we have had him up before my lady  Methinks I hear her say Simon I am convinc'd that lawyer is a rascalTurn him out  Buck  Aye we'll all lend a helping hand to that  Scud  Yes or a helping foot if that is wanted I have one at his service  Simon  Bless you my worthy master bless you heartily I hope I have said nothing to affront you I was a little by the head just now but that's over  Alg  So is not my remembrance I shall ever prize you as my best of friends  Simon  Lord love you we are all your friends we are all Algernons and Anti Earlings  Buck  And when the election comes well wear your colours  Scud  Only put me in office on that day let me be surgeongeneral to the enemy and I'll engage they shall have more freeholders in the hospital than at the hustings I'll scour their consciences I warrant me  Alg  Now my good friends keep secret what has pass'd and wait the event in silenceHere comes one a gentle advocate whom I would fain speak to apart  Simon  We are gone we are gone All happiness befal you  Exeunt all but  ALGERNON  EMILY FITZALLAN  enters  Emily  Bless me you've chang'd your habit  Alg  Yes my charmerIn chace 'tis lawful to hang out false colours but when we are clear'd and going into action we must shew what we are  Emily  Right and where truth unfolds her standard victory must follow  Alg  And what should follow victory What but the glorious prize for which I struggle that prize which fortune aiming to impoverish has only made more rich in my esteemthat generous heart that sacrific'd for me interest for which so many sacrifice themselves Now call to mind those words so heavenly sweet which you left with me whilst the ingenuous blush glow'd on your cheek  "Henry I live for you"  Emily  Ah that was then the only way I had to reinstate you in your property and tho' it cost a blush to say those words still I could say them for I scorn'd to rob youbut to repeat them now wou'd beOh heavenit would be every thing but false my Henry  Alg  Then let me take that truth into a heart of which no human power can dispossess you  Emily  I hope not Henry for take that away and I am poor indeed  Alg  'Tis your's for everand believe me dear one if my too credulous aunt has not outliv'd her reason she will see the injustice of her own decisions and revoke them For my exclusion she may have some plea our families have been at suit for years and law will cut asunder closer ties than those existing between her and me but of her motives for discarding you take my word Emily she'll soon repent  Emily  It is not that I fear her worthless favourite the wretch has brought a storm upon his head and has already had some heavy shocksbut my worst fears point to another quarter  Alg  I understand you 'Tis Montrath you dread  Emily  I could not temporize I spoke too plainly Indignant of the claim she made upon me I set her power too boldly at defiance and challeng'd her to cancel her bequest  Alg  You must consult Sir Oliver upon this I cannot speak upon Montrath's affair even to you  Emily  I see you either cannot or you will not therefore I ask no questions well persuaded you never would take arms against the life of any man and know yourself in fault  Alg  I hope I shan't be found to have so done but look here comes Sir OliverI'll leave you he may perhaps be less reserv'd than I am  Exit  ALGERNON  Sir  OLIVER MONTRATH  enters  Sir Oliv  Was not that Algernon  Emily  You know him sir it seems  Sir Oliv  I think I do I have cause to know him  Emily  Ah sir you speak so mournfully I fear you have found no comfort in your visit to your nephew  Sir Oliv  Small comfortYet the danger of his wound is much abated  Emily  Then I'm afraid you have or think you have some cause of anger against Algernon  Sir Oliv  No Emily no anger against him You cannot think too well of Algernon tho' I could wish you had not put your thoughts in language quite so warm  Emily  'Twas indiscreet but that defamer urg'd me and put me off my guard  Sir Oliv  Cou'dn't you find another and a stronger cause that put you off your guard Is there not a certain passion which our hearts are subject to that neither keeps a guard upon itself nor suffers any to be kept against it  Emily  If I should answer that as truth would prompt me shou'dn't I expose myself to another reproof for want of caution  Sir Oliv  No for so far from thinking with my lady that you have chosen ill I think with you that you could no where make a better choiceAnd more than thiswas your brave father living and knew what I know of your Algernon he would approve your judgment  Emily  As I am sure you would not give that name but to a sacred truth what you have said sanctions the character of Algernonbut does it warrant me in suffering him to make a sacrifice of interest by marrying a beggar  Sir Oliv  You point the question wrong and should have ask'd if it exculpates me your father's friend for suffering you to call yourself a beggar No my dear child it does not nor will I permit it to be said the daughter of the generous Fitzallan who in the battle found me faint with wounds and whilst he cover'd me receiv'd his death wanted that dross which I abounded inThis Emily this never should be said so come with me and don't oppose one word to my resolves for in an act of honour I will pause at no man's bidding no my pretty one nor yet at any woman's tho' grac'd with all the charms that heaven can give her  Exeunt  SCENE  changes  EARLING  alone  Now fortune one kind lift and I am landed So far success goes with me I have nothing more to fear from Emily that pert proud miss is silenc'd and thrown by It now remains to sweep those menial vermin out my way those insects that annoy me old Sir Oliver that blusters about justice is a hypocrite he cannot be a friend to Algernon and yet he troubles me takes up my seat at table occupies the ear of the old lady and obstructs my suit which stood so fair that if I could but seize one lucky moment one fair opportunity Hah I have found itHere she comes alone Now impudence befriend me  Lady  CYPRESS  enters  Lady Cyp  So Mr Earling much as I love peace I will not purchase it by mean concessions I will not suffer the gentleman I esteem and trust to be affronted by my sawcy servants they shall atone or troop  Earl  Most amiable most excellent of ladies whom with my heart I serve honour obey and worship I want words to speak my gratitudeThus at your feet in humble adoration let me seal on this dear hand the pledge the sacred pledge of my unutterable my unbounded love  SIMON  and  DOROTHY  enter  Simon  Look Dorothy the devil's at his prayers  Dor  I hope they're his last prayers  Earl  Curse on their coming what a moment lost Madam do you permit your menial servants thus to break in upon your private moments  Lady Cyp  Why not If you have any thing to add to your last speech I shall not interrupt it You may resume your posture and go on  Earl  Madam I cannot  Lady Cyp  I can help your memory if you have lost the word 'Twas  love unbounded love  When you had gone so far out of all bounds all measure of respect can the appearance of these silly people deter you from proceeding  Earl  Madam if you're offended I have done I'll humbly take my leave  Lady Cyp  No sir I must insist upon your staying Tho' you are foil'd to add a single word to insolence so perfect and complete yet you shall not be robb'd of your just right that nature gives you to be heard in vindication of your own assertions If you have spoke the truth and nothing but the truth of Algernon his character cannot be rescued let the fate of your's be what it may  Simon  Any thing the matter Mr Attorney Afraid you are not quite well just now You look a little pale  Lady Cyp  Hold your tongue foolish fellow you Simon in the first place and you next mistress who dare to tell me I am made the dupe of false impressions are you not both asham'd to look this injur'd gentleman in the face  Simon  It is a face to make a man asham'd and we did blush to see him on his knees before your ladyship  Lady Cyp  That's my affair fall down on your's and ask forgiveness of him  Simon  Pray madam don't command me to do  that for fear I never should forgive myselfI ask your pardon for approaching you when I was tipsey but you bade me drink and I was over eager to obey you  Lady Cyp  That's easily forgiven but your abuse of this gentleman whom I must still call the friend of truth is monstrous  Simon  Madam if that gentleman is the friend of truth he makes very free with his friend truly I only said he told lies to your ladyship that's no abuse for here come those an prove it  Sir  OLIVER MONTRATH  and  EMILY  Earl  My evil genius what does he do her    Sir Oliv  Forgive me my good lady if I come to atone to you and this fair advocate for my unjust suspicions of your nephew I have one here waiting who'll confront that gentleman his accuser and I trust remove some false impressions that your ladyship may have imbibed from his unfounded charges Come in sir if you please  ALGERNON  enters  Lady Cyp  How now who's this Henry  Sir Oliv  I claim your promise to give him hearing  Earl  I protest against him that fellow's an impostor we shall not listen to his evidence  Lady Cyp  He first came here humbly to ask for service pleaded decay and said he was a gentleman by birth I pitied him and offer'd him relief He now has chang'd his dress shifted his character and claims to be an advocate for Algernon These are suspicious circumstances and I shou'd have some better reasons for believing him than I am yet possess'd of Do you know any such Sir Oliver  Earl  Aye sir do you know who this champion is  Sir Oliv  Sir give me leave to askDo you  Earl  Not I I know him not  Sir Oliv  Yet you know Algernon are intimate with all his habits frailties faults offenceshave look'd into his heart and kindly told the secrets you discover'dOh thou slanderer Now look him in the face and prove your chargeWell may you startMark his confusion madamThis is your nephew this is Algernon  Emily  Yes on my honour and my brave preserver  Lady Cyp  I am confoundedWhere is that defamer  Simon  Madam he has stept aside to mend a flaw in his indictmentHow do you do Mr Attorney Come forward if you please and get acquainted with this gentleman's face You knew him well enough behind his back  Lady Cyp  Peace let me hear what Algernon will say in his own cause  Sir Oliv  Speak for yourself brave Algernon  Alg  I am that exil'd man whom on the word of this defamer tho' unknown to him even by sight it seems you have proscrib'd Despairing of admission to your presence and driven in selfdefence on this resource I took a counterfeited character and saw what I had never been allow'd to approach your person Much I wish'd to speak in mitigation of your prejudice and give a plain recital of my wrongs but you had then no ear for such discourse and I was told to wait your better leisure  Lady Cyp  All this is trueproceed  Alg  A friend here present told me I was accus'd to you of various crimes and gross enormities I plead to failings to the common errors and indiscretions youth is subject to but I trust I have never degraded my character or debas'd my principle I am no gamester as he makes me to be no dissipater of my paternal fortune as he insinuates no libertine as he asserts and let me add in the hearing of Sir Oliver Montrath I am no assassin  Sir Oliv  It is now my duty and a painful one I feel it to bring to light in vindication of an injur'd character the guilty person for whose shameful act no better palliation can be found than temporary madness and intoxication The monster from whose brutal violence the purest of heaven's creatures was preserv'd by Algernon how shall I speak it without shame and horror was Lionel Montrath  Lady Cyp  I am confounded and amaz'd MontrathThis if not told by you Sir Oliver wou'd mock belief  Sir Oliv  Your nephew was too noble to disclose it tho' he has in his hands a written paper sign'd by the offender for his vindication This I believe he never has discover'd even to that lady tho' a party in it  Emily  Never but constantly evaded my enquiries  Sir Oliv  To this when I shall add that my rash nephew forc'd the duel on him in consequence of blows exchang'd between them I trust I may with  safety rest his cause upon the facts adduc'dunless indeed this gentleman has any other charge which in his modesty he will prefer  Earl  You'll not draw any thing from me Sir Oliver you may talk on I prefer silence  Sir Oliv  You are right 'tis time your tongue had some repose  Lady Cyp  Pray do not keep him longer in my sight My nephew does not seem to hold him worthy of a retort  Alg  No madam I have nothing to return him for his malicious slander but my contempt  Lady Cyp  If he can feel 'tis punishment enough  Sir Oliv  Be gone your infamy go with you and may no part of it adhere to your profession  Earl  Let my profession look to itselfThere are some understandings in this world made it should seem by nature to be duped Had you not been so easy of belief I had not been so forward to deceive you Now put what name you will upon my conduct there are such glaring instances in point of dealers in seduction infamy and false impressions on credulity as make my shame no wonder  Exit  Lady Cyp  Now Henry you've appeal'd to me for justicehear my decree There is your destiny that is the prize which you have nobly earn'd My heart so long estrang'd is now your own You are my son and Emily my daughter all I possess is your'sHave I aton'd  Alg  Oh you have given me that which might atone for all the pains mortality cou'd feelbeauty to charm me talents to enchant and truth to fix my happiness secure  Emily  Oh Henry bear me to my benefactress and let me kneel  Lady Cyp  Yes I will let you kneel my child for now thou hast a treasure worth thy thanks Be virtuous loving faithful to each other ape not the fashions of this guilty world seek pleasures where alone they can be found in nuptial harmony domestic duties and that sweet reflection which fortune well employ'd is sure to giveRise my adopted rise  Sir Oliv  Oh let me add a blessingMay you beWell well it will not forth my heart's too full but I will send it up in thought towards heaven Here Emily my love I'll put the first chain on your bridal arm they are pure pearls my child not spoils of war but gifts of gratitude for life preserv'd wear them for my sake and when I am dead cast a kind look upon them and drop one pearly tear richer than them all to the memory of old Oliver  Emily  Oh sir sir sirmy father and my friend  Sir Oliv  So so no more Henry my gallant boy give me your handa soldier's greeting after victorytime was I could have grasp'd it harder  Alg  I accept it and press it to my heart  Lady Cyp  Where are you all This is a day of joy Simon I look to you to oil the hinges of my castle gates that they may open freely to the neighbours the tenants and the poor  Simon  I'll make 'em swing so please you and for one bad man now gone out of them a hundred good ones shall come in I warrant me  Lady Cyp  You Dorothy must set the girls a dancing and you Rachel must lead the ball in honour of your mistress  SCUD  and  JENNY  who had crept in behind the servants now step forward  Scud  And when the bumpkins caper and kick shins may they not want a plaister good my Lady I'll cure them gratis on this happy night I have brought a bill so please you that will bear some riders on it and not break it's back  Lady Cyp  We'll have no bills nor bickerings any more and to cut short all reckonings I'll establish you apothecary general to the castle upon a salary fixt  Simon  Then Jerry the less physic you send in the better for yourself  Scud

child of the castle and will grace our dance  Scud  Yes under favour Jenny tho' I say it has all the steps that now are thought so graceful she'll balance on one leg and send the other upon a cruize

our castle can cheer one honest ease one heavy heart our harmless efforts have not been in vain  END OF THE COMEDY  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Miss BETTERTON  NOW  False Impressions  are no more in view  Allow me to present you with the true  A bond it is impress'd by honor's seal  With Truth's fair form grav'd in perennial steel  A bond of gratitude to which I set  Both hand and heart to verify my debt  And tho' in law an infant and in merit  Poor as heav'n knows I am not poor in spirit  I'll pay you when I'm able from my gains  If you'll have patience I'll not spare for pains  In truth I did not seek this awful post  No champion I to face so brave a host  There are who when five yawning acts are o'er  Can tickle those same yawners till they roar  These are the friends our prosing bard should court  He gives soft slumbers but they make the sport  They have the spell to puff the stage balloon  Brim full of gas and blow it to the moon  Not so our poetHe accounts it right  To keep his critics ever in his sight  Such jaunts might turn their brains disturb their thinking  And send them where they'd lose the art of sinking  Rigour when just he can he will endure  The stream is bitter but the spring is pure  Candor when candor haply he can meet  Like Moses' rod can turn the bitter sweet  But the foul puddle in which malice dips  Is a dire doseHe spurns it from his lips  He writes because tho' writing is abus'd  The world is not too grave to be amus'd  He writes and ever to some moral end  Because the world is not too good to mend  Soft female hearts are prone as wax to melt  And true or false impressions will be felt  Youth's yielding clay too easily receives  The featur'd st  mp that crossey'd cunning gives  Therefore let her whose dang'rous lot in life  Hangs on the balance betwixt maid and wife  Lay those few short prescriptions to her heart  With which the Lady Cypress clos'd her part  For base seduction spreads on every side  His treach'rous snares to mesh th' unwary bride  She in whose eyes enticing Cupids play  Gives impudence the clue and leads the way  What tho' the faithless husband quits her hand  Truth like a column of itself can stand  To reas'ning minds sufficient strength is giv'n  And none but fools can charge their faults on heav'n  December    In the Press and speedily will be Published  A NEW AND COMPLETE EDITION OF THE OBSERVER  In Six Volumes Duodecimo  NEWLY CLASSED AND ARRANGED And containing in Addition to the Original Matter AN ENTIRE TRANSLATION OF THE CLOUDS OF ARISTOPHANES WITH NOTES CRITICAL AND EXPLANATORY  Also  A
