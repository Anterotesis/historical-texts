VERNON  WOMEN  FELICIA  Mrs SMITH  LISSETTA  Mrs WRIGHTEN  TO THE PUBLICK  THE reader will perceive at first sight that the hint of this piece is borrowed from an Italian Opera entitled  Il Filofofo di Campagna  There is also a circumstance from Moliere which except about twenty lines taken from different publications and thrown occasionally into the songs are the only passages in it that have ever appeared either on the stage or in print  Indeed conscious of my own inability I should have collected all the materials had it been practicable but attempting this without success and being unwilling to throw away a subject than which 'tis hardly possible to conceive any thing more operatical I determined to make a tryal of what I could do to it myself and this in no respect with a view of setting myself up for an author but merely from a desire of assisting my reputation as a musician  And now I should very little deserve the  pains they have taken for me if I did not in the warmest manner acknowledge my obligations to the performers to whose merit I am convinced I owe a considerable share of that applause the WEDDING RING has been favoured with  I have little more to say concerning the piece The dialogue is given for nothing more than such as would immediately arise from the situations and if the songs are found to be irregular I would beg leave to remark that they were written so the comic ones especially on purpose it being very often necessary that the measure should halt in order to give a novelty to the expression of the musick And having said thus much such as it is I take the liberty of submitting this trifle to the public to that public to whom I have such infinite obligations whose humanity and generosity I have so lately experienced and to whose amusement it will always be my greatest pride that I have the honour of endeavouring to contribute  C Dibdin  February    THE WEDDING RING  ACT I  SCENE I  A Library with doors opening into other apartmentsA table with writings  Pandolfo  reading a will and afterwards  Lissetta  enters with chocolate  PANDOLFO  "I Give and bequeath to Zerbino my son  "My estates and effects one and all when I'm gone  "And first the estates that were mortgag'd to me  "By a card'nal a monk a count and grandee  "Worth in all fifty thousand piastres or more  ▪And for which I advanc'd something less than a score  "Next sold e're possess'd the estates of an heir  "Consisting of houses in charming repair  "Which were left him long since by an overfond grannum  "And are worth at the least a thousand per annum"  Good fortunes I'faith next come watches and rings  Aigrettessolitairesby no means bad things  Of which some were pawn'd some detain'd and some plunder'd  From widows and heirs little short of a hundred  These and all his possessions without one omission  Are giv'n to this Spark on the following condition  "In hopes that my son will to virtue incline  "And lead a life careful and honest like mine  "Abstaining from usury avarice and fraud  "In short treading just in the path that I trod  ▪I say in the hope that of this he'll take care  ▪I constitute will and appoint him my heir"  All these possessions has old Zerbino left his son who I intend shall marry my daughter Let me see now what the whole will amount tofifty thousand piastresa thousand a yearwatchesringsaigrettessolitairesno less I warrant than to the value of  Lis  Sir here's your chocolate and Sig Zerbino has sent  Pan  He has been a near miserable fellow  Lis  Sig Zerbino Sir  Pan  A very sad fellow  Lis  Well this is the first word upon that subject I ever heard out of your mouth  Pan  But however that's nothing to the present business his son may make a good husband notwithstanding  Lis  Oh I begin to conceive you Sir will you hear me  Pan  It shall be concluded directly  Takes a pinch of snuff  Lis  Removing the snuffbox and putting the chocolate in the place of it  I'll try to make you feel if I can't make you hear  Pan  I don't think she could possibly have done better  Going to take another pinch of snuff he dips his finger and thumb into the chocolate  What the devil's that  Lis  Only a little innocent method I took to make you understand I was here Sir  Pan  You impudent jade how dare you serve me such a trick  Lis  Why Sir I have been bawling this half hour to you but you was so wrapt up in your deeds and settlements and stuff that I might have stood here till tomorrow morning if I had not taken the way I did  Pan  So you have been overhearing what I read  Lis  Indeed Sir 'tis no secret we all know well enough that you want to marry my young lady to a spark with more money than understanding and I suppose you was contriving now to load her with riches in return for the happiness you intend to deprive her of  Pan  Did ever any body hear such insolence  Lis  Lord Sir what insolence 'tis no more than what every body says and 'tis a great shame especially when there are so many reasons to prevent it  Pan  What's that Do you know any thing that will prevent it  Lis  O yes to be sure you go the way to make me tell you any thing  Pan  Go you fool what could you tell me  Lis  Why I would not tell you any thing if it was ever so much in my power but I'll tell you what I'll keep every thing from you that I can  Pan  I wonder what possesses me that I bear all this Hear me Mrs Impudence send your mistress to me and let me have no more of this behaviour if you expect to stay in my family  Lis  Very well Sir you may do as you please you are not content I find with preventing my young lady's happiness but you want to rob her of the only friend she has in the world  Pan  Why don't you do what I order you  Lis  I am going Sir  Pan  And yet now if you knew any thing that  Lis  Don't ask me for I won't tell you a word about it  I'm not such a fool when I'm snub'd at this rate  Of matters with which I'm entrusted to prate  The secrets I'm told  Are as safe as old gold  And however some folks it may teaze  My mind is my own  And I shall as I please  Though you threat me  And beat me  And like a slave treat me  Conceal it or let it alone  To be sure 'tis no bus'ness of mine  But put any one else in my stead  Let them serve a good humour'd young lady  With gifts and promises ready  Who begs of her lover  No word may be said  And then let her father  Come threat'ning which rather  Would fright one than make one discover  I say in this case  Let who will take my place  And see to which side they'd incline  SCENE II  PANDOLFO FELICIA LISSETTA  Pan  I would fain persuade myself that all the chattering of this wench is no more than the common cant of creatures in her situation and yet Felicia's disingenuous behaviour has half convinc'd me that there's a lover in the case When she comes I shall be better able to judge and in the mean time I'll go and send an invitation to Zerbino  FELICIA  I saw what seem'd a harmless child  With wings and bow  And aspect mild  Who sob'd and sigh'd and pin'd  And beg'd I would some boon bestow  On a poor little boy stone blind  Not aware of the danger too soon I comply'd  For exulting he cry'd  And drew from his quiver a dart  My pow'r you shall know  Then levell'd his bow  And wounded meright in the heart  I understood Sir you desired to see me but I find you are busy  Pan  Only labouring for thee Felicia I am contriving the securest method of adding the vast possessions of Sig Zerbino to the estate of our family  Fel  But why should you do that Sir have not we fortune sufficient already  Pan  To be sure fifteen thousand crowns a year well paid is no contemptible thing but as I told you I am desiring this for you  Fel  I can't see how I am concern'd in it Sir  Pan  Why thus Zerbino's father was my particular friend and I can't bear to think that all his vast wealth should be lavish'd away in equipages courtezans and such sort of expences so out of friendship to the young man and with a view to your interest at the same time I intend to make him my soninlaw  Lis  There Madam you'll believe me another time  Pan  He is this morning arrived from Florence where he has been to take possession of a large estate and I have sent to invite him here  Lis  Oh Sir you might have sav'd yourself that trouble for he has sent to invite himself  Pan  Then I'll go and hasten him I dare swear you'll be glad to see him  Lis  How little you know of the matter  Pan  What's that you say  Lis  I Sir nothing I did not speak a word  Fel  Heavens what shall I do  sighing  Pan  What do you sigh for  Fel  I did not sigh Sir  Lis  Law Ma'am now can you say so she did sigh Sir and I've a great mind to tell you what it was for  Fel  Hold your tongue Lissetta for shame  Lis  Why Ma'am you know very well what I say is truth you do sigh for something and I should sigh too if I was in your place  Pan  Why I must confess Felicia to be ingenuous  you don't seem to enter cordially into this proposal of mine  Fel  Sir if in compliance with any request of your's I was sure to be miserable I don't remember to have given the least room for a suspicion that I should refuse it  Lis  Lord Ma'am how can you begging your pardon be so foolish I would not make myself miserable to oblige all the fathers in the world  Pan  Will you hold your tongue 'tis you that have spoilt her  Lis  I spoil her I am sure I am always giving her good advice  Fel  I beg Lissetta you'll not treat my father in this familiar manner  Pan  Come come I'll cut the matter very short you'll have a visit from Zerbino within this half hour and you may guess what sort of behaviour I expect from you to the man I intend for your husband  When we come to the age of threescore  By our maxims in vain we set store  A girl in her teens  Will find out the means  To fret us and plague us and teaze out our hearts  Till our giant wit  Is forc'd to submit  To her puny arts  Like bells that eternally jangle  You may scold you may fight you may wrangle  If they're set on't you'll see  They masters will be  Nay though you secure them as safe as your pelf  They'll lead you the life of the devil himself  SCENE III  FELICIA LISSETTA  and afterwards  HENRICO  Fel  Was ever poor creature thus harress'd and tormented  Lis  You are tormented enough that's certain and stand in great need of advice  Fel  'Tis too true and I have no friend in the world to give it me  Lis  No Ma'am to be sure 'tis not much in my power to be your friend but if Sig Henrico was to hear you what would he say  Fel  Why will you be always talking to me of him  Lis  Because Ma'am I love to please you  Fel  Heigh ho  Lis  I say Ma'am don't you think he'd be able to give you advice  Fel  What advice would he give me while my father remains so inflexible or if he could how can I see him  Lis  Should you like to see him and would you not be angry if I was to bring it about  Fel  Dear girl don't trifle with me  Lis  Why then jesting apart you may see him now if you choose it  Fel  How Lissetta  Lis  By opening that door Before your father came in here I took an opportunity unobserved of poping your lover into that closet  Fel  Without my leave what must he think of me  Lis  Bless me Madam is this a time to stand upon ceremony you know your opportunities are few enough therefore don't lose this  Fel  Well but Lissetta  Lis  Oh madam indeed I must call him outSirSirSig Henrico  Hen  Is the coast clear  Lis  Yes yes you may venture  Fel  Indeed Lissetta I shan't easily forgive this  Hen  Let me intreat you Felicia to forgive her if there is any indiscretion I am the cause of it and believe me I would not have taken this method of seeing you so well I know your delicacy if I had not been forced to it by the last necessity  Fel  It would be ridiculous Henrico to deny that I am pleased with your attention to me but what can it avail my father is obstinately bent on this hateful marriage  Hen  Shall I tamely stand by in the moment you are so kind to confess a partiality for me and see you sacrificed in so cruel a manner  Fel  What would you do  Hen  Boldly demand you of your father my fortune is not despicable my family unexceptionable and why should not I stand a chance of supplanting this Zerbino  Fel  'Tis impossible my father would never consent to it  Hen  Have I your leave to try  Fel  Upon condition you'll leave me now I give it you for I am frighten'd out of my senses lest my father should return  Lis  Come Sir I think my lady has consented  to a good deal if we don't take care to be prudent every thing will be spoil'd you had better therefore let me conduct you out but above all things remember the instructions I gave you this morning  Hen  Must I then leave you Felicia  Fel  You see 'tis absolutely necessary  Hen  In the afternoon I'll see your father till when I shall be all anxiety and inquietude  The trav'lers that through desarts ride  By conduct of some friendly star  When clouds obscure their trusty guide  Out of their course must wander far  So I with pensive care and pain  In absence still must stray  'Till you  my  star shine out again  And light me on my way  SCENE IV  FELICIA  I am terrified to death at my situation I have not the courage to refuse my father and yet find it impossible to comply with his cruel request Why indeed should I comply with it Is there the least prospect of happiness for me if I do and does not reason every thing forbid my being compell'd to give my hand to a man I cannot love But then is not this the request of a tender and indulgent father who has always made my happiness his constant study and even now wishes this union from no one motive but to see me plac'd in a still superior situation alas how weak and vain as if felicity was the ceriain consequence of splendour and that all the pleasures and enjoyments of life follow'd in the train of the great For my part I must have a new mind before I can entertain such sentiments and cou'd wish to be left to the peaceable enjoyment of content though I shou'd be oblig'd to seek for it in a cottage  Happy the nymph who ne'er can know  Distractions which from riches grow  Remov'd at distance from the great  Who willing lives in low estate  One fountain is her mirrour and her drink  And if she's pleas'd what others think  It matters notof joy secure  Blest in the little heav'n has sent  Her only pride is that she's poor  Poor but content  SCENE V  ZERBINO  and  LISSETTA  Lis  Speaking as she comes on  Oh 'tis impossible for any thing to be better contrivedLet me see how I go onHenrico is guarded against all that can happen I have told him that when he comes in the afternoon he must expect to be snub'd by us all nothing now remains but to get rid of this Zerbino and instruct my mistress in her part She is gone into her dressingroom I seehow luckyby that means when this creature comes he'll be left to my management and if I don't give a good account of him I'll be content to be thought the arrantest novice in loveaffairs that ever liv'd  Ser  Sig Zerbino is come to wait on my young lady  Lis  Oh very well my lady desires you'll shew him in here I'll send him packing I'll warrant him  Zer  Bless me what makes me tremble so  Lis  He's frighten'd out of his wits  Zer  What ails me  Lis  When does he intend to speak I wonder  Zer  I don't know what to say to her I wish she'd speak first  Lis  I see if I don't break the ice we shall wait till the old gentleman returns and then all would be spoiltYour servant Signor Zerbino  Zer  Ma'am your most humble servantPray Ma'am are you Signora Filicia  Lis  I hope Sir there's nothing in my appearance  should make you suspect I am not the mistress of the house  Zer  Oh no not the least in the worldShe has a fine spirit I can see that already  Lis  Pray Sir where did you leave my father  Zer  He's only just stept to the notary about the writings he'll be here presently  Lis  Will hethen I must make good use of my time What writings pray Sir  Zer  Why don't you know what I am come about  Lis  Yes yes it has been sufficiently din'd in my ears I have been teaz'd and worried to death with it  Zer  By your father I suppose  Lis  B  I have behav'd with a becoming spirit does he imagine that I'll suffer an obstinate old fellow like him to controul my inclinations as he thinks proper no no most young ladies of fashion like me take delight in tormenting their fathers and I love to behave like other people  Zer  Yes ye told me you was always tormenting him  Lis  He did and do you think Zerbino he goes the way to prevail on me if it was not that there's something genteel and winning in your carriage and behaviour I declare out of contradiction to him I should order a servant to turn you out of the house  Zer  I am sure Ma'am I am very much obliged to you  Lis  Sir you are oblig'd to nothing but your own merit that to be sure has won upon me but however if it was possible for you to be twenty times more lovely and agreeable than you are  Zer  Lord you jeer me  Lis  Upon my word I am serious I say Sir if such a thing was possible and I really believe it is not it would not avail any thing with me for I beg you to take notice that I don't give you my consent out of love but pure obstinacy  Zer  Oh then you do consent  Lis  What have I in my flurry been guilty of Oh Zerbino you'll despise me for yielding so easily you should not have been so solicitous  Zer  How solicitous why I hardly said any thing at all  Lis  No did not you implore me to soften the rigour of your sufferings and with eyes all full of tenderness beg me to have pity on you  Zer  If I did I don't remember it  Lis  Ah this is always the case the moment a man knows his power he abuses it however Sir I think since I have been so condescending you ought at least to say something handsome to me now on the subject  Zer  Why for that matter I've a vast deal to say to you but I dont know how it is I've such a prodigious pleasure in your company that whenever I go to speak I can't get out a word for the life of me  Lis  There never was so pretty a thing said in this world entirely owing I suppose to your respect for me  Zer  Oh yes all owing to my respect for you  Lis  Well it is impossible for any thing to be more gallant  Zer  I like her a great deal better than I thought I should  Lis  But as you are such a passionate and tender  lover I dare say you have not neglected a most material thing in gallantry  Zer  Lord what's that  Lis  To write some verses on me  Zer  Why I could not myself but I gave a famous poet a hundred piastres to do it for me because I'd have 'em done in the best manner I have got 'em set to music too and I'd sing 'em in a great stile if you would not be affronted  Lis  Oh I'm enchanted pray let me hear 'em Now for something fine and ridiculous  ZERBINO  The Grand Turk with his wives and his mufties and mutes  In his shining alcoves in his grottos and shades  May carouse to the cymbals or dance to the flutes  Or sleep to the music of falling cascades  Or mew up his concubines in his Seraglio  Or deck'd with a pompous regalia  While to every subject his word is a law  May direct the divan  And keep all to a man  From Vizier to slave of the bowstring in awe  But I ev'n high'r  Than this would aspire  And of harsh sounding cymbals and delicate flutes  Which please the Grand Turk and his mufties and mutes  And grottos and bow'rs and cascades and alcoves  With baths and perfumes amber cassia and cloves  And much more having you I've my choice  All that's pleasing to me  In your person I see  All that's musical hear in your voice  And compar'd to your love or your good opinion  What's pow'r or title or wealth or dominion  Lis  Sir you give me very great proofs of your affection indeed and if it was not for a certain delicacy and decorum which you must have remark'd in me and which I always so strictly preserve I don't know but I should consent to be married tomorrow morning  Zer  Oh let us be married tomorrow morning by all means see here I have brought  The  WEDDING RING on purpose pray let me put it on your finger  Lis  Really Sir you have such insinuating ways there's no refusing you any thing but Sig Zerbino the grand point is how are we to live after we are married  Zer  Oh we shan't disagree about that I warrant you I shall be be the most loving creature in the world  Lis  Then I'm afraid we shall disagree I shall expect a great deal of indulgence  Zer  Lord you shall do whatever you please  Lis  Yes yes I must make a point of that for my father's severity has hitherto kept me in the saddest subjection in the world he gives me so little liberty that it makes me half mad and I have a hundred times wish'd that he would marry me to any body that I might be out of this constraint thank heaven you come very happily for that end and I shall henceforward prepare to take diversions and make up for the time I have lost I don't intend to be unreasonable I believe what with public amusements gaming visits company treats  walks balls and a ciscesbeo I shall be pretty well satisfied  I will have my humour I'll please all my senses  I'll neither be stinted in love nor expences  I'll dress with profusion I'll game without measure  You shall have the bus'ness and I'll have the pleasure  By every incentive I'll rouse inclination  More changing capricious and vain than the fashion  In short I'll take care by the bent of my carriage  To shew you the sweets and the comforts of marriage  SCENE VI  ZERBINO PANDALFO  afterwards  LISSETTA  and  FELICIA  Pan  Well Zerbino have you seen her  Zer  Yes I have seen her  Pan  And what sort of a reception has she given you  Zer  Oh I never was so happy in my life if she could eat gold she should have it you told me she'd put on her melancholy airs and I should be frown'd at and truly it made me a little afraid at first But I never saw any thing so coming and so goodnatur'd in all my life  Pan  Why did not she refuse you  Zer  Refuse me why bless your heart she's quite in love with me  Pan  'Tis impossible  Zer  Impossible what do you think it impossible for any body to be in love with me  Pan  Oh no I don't mean that  Zer  E'cod if you did I believe you'd find yourself very much mistaken  Pan  Well well but explain this matter  Zer  Why I can't explain it any more than I have you desir'd me to come and make love to your daughter by that time I had been here five minutes she was as fond of me as any thing can be before we parted I gave her  The  WEDDING  RING and we are to be married tomorrow morning  Oh how my heart is leaping and skipping  And bounding as if from its seat 'twould come out  My head is grown giddy my heels are a tripping  And all my five senses are put to the rout  Pan  I hope she's sincere  I'll call her again  Felicia Felicia  Goes off  Lis  Good Sir 'tis in vain  Coming on  You'll not make her hear  Zer  The old man I see  Is as anxious as me  Lis  Who call'd meZerbino wast thee  Zer  No Ma'am 'twas your father  Lis  I rather  Had hopes it was you  Pan  Felicia  Zer  He's calling you now  Lis  Then adieu  Zer  And why so  Lis  But a whim  I'm asham'd to confess my affection to him  But you on my truth may for ever rely  Zer  Was ever a lover so happy as I  Enough love enough  Lis  Here he comes I'll steal off  Goes off  Pan  Where where can she be  Comes on  Zer  He he he he he  She was here Sir this minute  Pan  The deuce must be in it  Zer  'Tis true and she told me  'Twas joy to behold me  In short she grows kinder and kinder  Pan  I must and will find her  Felicia  Goes off  Lis  Zerbino you'd better be gone  Comes on  You'll speak to the priest let me see you anon  Mean time to my father don't mention a word  Where I am  Zer  I'm not quite so absurd  'Tis enough you command me  Lis  Adieu then  Zer  Adieu  Think kindly of me I'll think kindly of you  LISSITTA  goes off  Zer  I've seen her again Sir  Pan  I've search'd the house round  And can't see her  Zer  'Tis true  Nor you won't bnt I've no time to waste  I'm going on business requires some haste  Pan  But you'll come back again  Zer  Back againto be sure  Pan  Mean time I'll attend you dear son to the door  Go off  Fel  Hold up my poor heart  FELICIA  and  LISSETTA  comes on  What a difficult part  Lissetta you've giv'n me to play  Lis  Here here take the Ring  And seem every thing  Your father can wish that's the way  I'll insure you success  And Hymen shall bless  Fel  Hush hush girl he's here  Pan  Felicia my dear  Comes on  Where was you  Fel  Dear Sir in my room  Pan  And have you been kind  To your lover  Fel  You'll find  That my lover will scarcely complain of his doom  Pan  You've confess'd an affection  Fel  To his care and protection  Myself I would gladly resign  Pan  I'm out of my wits  Lis  How well the plot hits  Pan  Was 'ere so complying a daughter as mine  Fel  Was 'ere situation so cruel as mine  Fel  Was ever man gull'd like this master of mine  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  The Scene continues  PANDALFO HENRICO  afterwards  FELICIA  and  LISSETTA  Pan  Sir I won't hear a single word more  Hen  What are your objections  Pan  Sir I shall keep my objections to myself and you must and shall be satisfied with my refusing you without telling you why  Hen  Was ever any thing to unreasonable But Sir if it should so happen that the lady is not averse to my proposal would you still persist in refusing me  Pan  I believe if you stay till you get her consent your patience will be pretty well exercis'd  Hen  Will you promise me your's Sir upon condition that I am so fortunate to succeed with her  Pan  Ay ay with all my heart I believe I may very securely make that promise  Hen  Sir I am the happiest man in the world  Pan  What then you really have the modesty to imagine it practicable  Hen  Why yes Sir I confess I have  Pan  Then know to your confusion that she has given her consent to another and that she wears on her finger at this minute a WEDDING RING in token of her having promised to marry him  Hen  Well Sir since it is so will you as the  last request I have to make you allow me to hear a confirmation of this from your daughter  Pan  What then you don't believe me  Hen  I don't absolutely say that but it would be a satisfaction to me I confess to hear it from the young lady herself  Pan  Oh Sir you shall have that satisfaction in a minute for here she comesFelicia here's a strange importunate sort of a gentleman who has the audacity to expect my consent to his marriage with you I told him of the promise you made me and nothing forsooth will satisfy him but hearing it from your mouth  Hen  Indeed Madam what I heard from your father might well surprise me I was in doubt I own and that final sentence which determines the fate of my unbounded passion must be so sensibly felt by me that it can be no offence if I desire a repetition of it  Fel  Sir I'd have it known that fate has presented two objects to my view which inspiring me with different sentiments agitate all the passions of my soul one by a reasonable choice whereto honour engages me  Pan  And your father's consent  Fel  Possesses all my esteem and love  Pan  That's my choice  Fel  And the other in return for his affection has all my anger and aversion  Pan  That's you  Fel  To see myself the wife of one is all my desire  Pan  That's my good girl  Fel  And I'd rather lose my life than be married to the other  Pan  Pray Sir are you contented  Fel  Sir he must be contented and if he has the love for me he pretends he ought not to repine at his fate  Hen  Ma'am so far from repining I admire your sincerity and shall endeavour to behave in this affair as I ought  Fel  I know 'tis highly improper for young women to own their love so freely but in the condition fate has plac'd me these liberties may be allow'd and I can without a blush confess that I have declared my real sentiments  Hen  Very well Ma'am your meaning's plain enough I understand what 'tis you urge me too and shall remove from your sight him who gives you this great disturbance  Fel  You can't oblige me more agreeably  Hen  The poor exile who leaving his friends and his home  Leaves more than his life more than fortune or fame  Is doom'd without hope thus unpity'd to roam  His suff'rings unmourn'd and forgotten his name  But justice condemn'd him his sentence is past  His fate is pronounc'd and he must be resign'd  With fortune he struggles indeedbut at last  To her rigid will learns to fashion his mind  SCENE II  PANDOLFO FELICIA  and  LISSETTA  Pan  Poor young mana very great proof of his affection indeedrather than make you unhappy he bears his own torments without seeming to suffer any truly I pity him  Fel  Indeed Sir it's more than I do  Pan  Nay but that's too cruel  Fel  Sir I assure you if you knew what my sentiments are of him you would not think him such an object of pity  Pan  Nay but consider he had an affection for you  Lis  Very true Sir in my opinion she ought to follow your advice and not treat him with so much illnature  Pan  We don't want you Ma'am to give your opinion about it  Lis  Lord Sir you won't be pleased let one talk how one will did not you say my young lady treated him too cruelly and would not any body in the world say the same is there any comparison now between him and Signor Zerbino Oh Ma'am your father is perfectly in the right shew more compassion to Henrico by all means  Pan  And who the devil gave you the liberty of advising my daughter  Lis  Sure Sir there's no harm in speaking one's mind I have said no more than what I actually think of the matter and you can't do better than first of all to marry your daughter to Henrico and afterwards as a reward for my faithful services prevail upon Zerbino to marry me  Pan  I never heard such a piece of impudence since I was born but I am angry with myself for listening to it Felicia I am going to see that Zerbino makes all the necessary preparations and shall be with you again in half an hour  Lis  If that's the case Ma'am I must run ready to break my neck that I may be with him before hand  Fel  Indeed Lissetta I dread the consequence of this disingenuous behaviour  Lis  Oh Ma'am If you don't exert a little spirit we are undone I have taken care to apprise Henrico of all that's going forward and poor Zerbinoif he does not repent his gallantryI have such a battery to play off against him nay I'll make both him and your father principal actors in this plot of ours even without their knowledge  Fel  I have no doubt of either your talents or good wishes for me Lissetta but take care you don't provoke my father  Lis  Never fear Ma'am I have conducted you so far on your voyage with safety and I warrant you I am pilot good enough to bring you fafe to land  Fel  Heaven send it  Lis  Besides who would not run a little risk for so handsome a man as Sig Henrico  Fel  Indeed Lissetta he deserves every thing  When first the youth his fears forsook  And that he lov'd I fondly heard  What sweetness was in ev'ry look  What eloquence in ev'ry word  From her whole store to make me bless'd  Did fortune bid me choose  How gladly would I all the rest  For love and him refuse  SCENE III  An Apartment in Zerbino's House  ZERBINO HENRICO  afterwards  LISSETTA  Hen  Is your name Zerbino Sir  Zer  Yes Sir that's my name  Hen  Then you are the man I was looking for  Zer  Pray Sir what's your bus'ness  Hen  Oh Sir I shall tell you my bus'ness in as brief a manner as possible it seems you have made proposals of marriage to Felicia Sig Pandolfo's daughter  Zer  No I did not 'twas her father made proposals to me  Hen  Well that no matter proposals were made and pray Sir what do you expect as a portion with her  Zer  Oh I am to take her without a portion  Hen  Indeed you are not  Zer  No  Hen  No I am to pay you her portion  Zer  Are you and pray what portion are you to pay me  Hen  I am afraid you won't like it  Zer  Not like it why sowhat is it to be  Hen  Blowswoundsand death  Zer  A very pretty portion indeed I had rather be without it I thank you  Hen  Nay Sir don't hesitate you see I am prepar'd to pay you and take the portion or I'll break off the match  Zer  You break off the match for what  Hen  For what  Zer  Ay tell me that  Hen  Because I am in love with the lady myselfbecause she returns my passionbecausebecause her father has consented to our marriage  Zer  Her father has consented to your marriage  Hen  He has and if you dare even to think of her I'll tear you to atoms  Zer  And all this is most certainly true  Hen  Death and fire have you any doubt of it  Zer  Why I can't say but your arguments are very convincing and yet now if you would but talk a little cool about this affair  Hen  Cool can a man jealous of his honour and affronted like me talk coolSir  Zer  Sir  Hen  I have but one short word to say to you renounce all claim to the lady this instant or tremble at the consequence  Zer  Indeed Sir you are very hasty only let me get over my fright a little I never saw you in all my life before and how do I know but all this may be  Hen  A lie I suppose  Zer  Oh no indeed I did not say a lie  Hen  But you mean't it and I'll not be trifled with therefore if you value your safety do as I command you  Zer  Oh I'll do any thing in the world if you will only give me a little breath and change that terrible countenance Oh as sure as I am alive here comes Felicia herself  Hen  Ah fond girl do you follow him to his house by Heav'n I suspected this but I will be revenged  Lis  Protect me Zerbino  Zer  Oh I am as much frigten'd at him as you can be  Hen  You've neither of you cause to fear for you Madam your infidelity be your punishment and for you Sir you are going to punish yourself but as I have still some regard left for Sig Pandolfo I'll take care he shall not be made a dupe of therefore I insist upon your giving this lady your hand before me and promising to marry her  Zer  That I will with all my heart and shall be glad to be friends with you so easily  Lis  And as for me I own the height of my ambition is to become the wife of Sig Zerbino  Hen  I am satisfied  SCENE IV  ZERBINO LISSETTA  Zer  E'cod he frighten'd me devilishly at first but he has behaved very well upon the whole has not he  Lis  I do assure you Zerbino I am very much in doubt about that he is a very insinuating man and had before I came out persuaded my father into such a plot that I am afraid we shall find a great many difficulties to get over yet  Zer  Why you surprise me  Lis  You must know that this cavalier is very well born and says my father to me soon after you went awayyou'll pardon me for repeating his wordsZerbino has a great deal of money to be sure but then it was all got by rapine and usury and to say truth he is little better than sprung from a dunghill now I have been considering this and am come to an absolute resolution not to let you marry him  Zer  Your father say this  Lis  These very wordsI was thunder struck at them as you may well guess and for heaven's sake dear Sir said I with tears in my eyes why would you let me see and converse with him why would you let me listen to his insinuating addresses which have won my affections and made it impossible for me to obey you  Zer  Dear kind creaturewell what did he say to that  Lis  Oh he continued unmov'd says hein a more resolute tone than ever I heard him speak to me in my lifeyou must conquer your affections I have heard of a gentleman well born and nearly related to the Doge of Venice and am so ashamed that I never thought of this man for my soninlaw that I shan't be content with merely marrying you to my friend Henrico but you must consent to punish Zerbino for having presum'd to think of you  Zer  To punish me and pray how does he mean to do that  Lis  I am almost asham'd to tell you  Zer  Oh I beg of you to tell me  Lis  Why he intendsto trap you into marriage with my maid  Zer  With your maid  Lis  With my maid he is to pass her upon you for me when you come to our house and as a proof of what I tell you he forc'd from me that Ring you were so gallant ro present me with and gave it to her the better to carry on his scheme  Zer  What a deceitful world this is  Lis  To be sure she is a relation of ours and every body thinks her a very smart girlbut I'll assure the minxto pretend to my lover  Zer  Ay indeedbut suppose we were to go  and be married directly that you know would put an end to every thing  Lis  It must not be I would not have my father think I am so afraid of him therefore come at the time you intended and I'll warrant every thing shall go as I'd have it  Zer  Oh you may depend upon me  Lis  My father is coming to you presently and I would advise you to tell him all this only don't say how you came to know it  Zer  Yes yes I'll tell him  Lis  Good b'ye Zerbino  Zer  Well but Felicia  Lis  What do you say  Zer  Won't you give me one kiss before you go  Lis  Lord how can you ask such a thing  Zer  You must indeed  kisses her  Lis  You impudent man you  Nay prithee how can you  Indeed I'll assure you  Will nothing then cure you  Nay now I declare I shall never endure you  You teaze one to death  I'm quite out of breath  I hate and abhor this horseplay  Besides 'tis not right  To see one this fright  Lord what do you think folks will say  I own too much room  You have had to presume  Or you ne'er with these freedoms would teaze me  For though they might please me  And with patience I bore 'em  Yet at least in one's carriage  On this side of marriage  One ought to keep up a decorum  SCENE V  ZERBINO and PANDOLFO  Zer  How violently she loves meWell done Sig PandolfoWho would have believed itHere he comesI'll seem melancholy  Pan  Well Zerbino I could not bear my Impatience so I came that we may conclude this business as soon as possible  Zer  Yes you seem rather in a hurry indeed  Pan  How happy shall I be when I once see you married  Zer  To your daughter's maidI'm very much oblig'd to you  Pan  What's the matter Zerbino You look dull  Zer  No not at all I was only thinking what a strange sort of a world this is  Pan  Why what complaint can you have against the world Has any one done you an ill office  Zer  How his conscience flies in his face Why I can't say but I have been rather ill treated  Pan  AyHow  Zer  You shall judge Do you know one Sig Henrico  Pan  Yes I know him very well Has he treated you ill  Zer  He's well born I believe  Pan  Yes yes he's well born he is related to the Doge of Venice  Zer  The very words Felicia told me and he has made proposals to marry your daughter has not he  Pan  I thought that was coming Why how came you to know it  Zer  Oh a friend informed me and I'll tell you What I have been thinking of Signior Pandolfo that for all I have a great deal of money since it was got by rapine and usury and since I am little better than sprung from a dunghill I ought not to aspire to the honour of being our soninlaw  Pan  You astonish me very much by this discourse  Zer  I am sure I don't know why you should be astonished about it  Pan  What does it tend to  Zer  You don't know I suppose  Pan  How should I unless you tell me  Zer  Why then I'll disguise it no longer'Tis you have used me ill the same friend that told me Sig Henrico wanted to marry Felicia told me you had consented to it and that you was determined to punish me for presuming to think of her and a great deal more  Pan  Was there ever such a strange parcel of stuff heard of  Zer  Well let it be ever so strange you don't contradict it I find  Pan  Zerbino I should not bear such an Imputation so easily if I was certain you had been imposed upon I suppose this is some contrivance of my daughter and her maid  Zer  The maid indeed may have some hand it but I am sure it's no contrivance of your daughter's  Pan  Well let the contrivance be whose it will I'm determin'd to have it explain'd  Zer  I'll tell you how it may be very easily explain'd  Pan  How  Zer  Why let us all come face to face  Pan  With all my heart I don't care how soon and when we do I'm sure you will find these women at the bottom of it  Of woman to tell you my mind  And I speak from the experience I've had  Not two out of fifty you'll find  Be they daughters or wives  But are plague of our lives  And enough to make any man mad  The wrong and the right  Being set in their sight  They're sure to take hold of the wrong  They'll cajole and they'll whimper  They'll whine and they'll snivel  They'll coax and they'll simper  In short they're the devil  And so there's an end of my song  SCENE VI  ZERBINO  I never saw such a turn in my lifeAh Sig Pandolfo you did not know what you was setting your wit tohow soon I found him outand how nettled he wasas if I would not believe Felicia sooner than himI don't wonder now at this fine blustering spark's coming so soon to himself when he knew he was so secure of the fatherand this after all is the regard he pays to the memory of his old friend in the morning he was dining  that in my ears and how much he should be obliged to me and when the notary was reading over all the list of my estates tenements valleys houses barns mortgages and stocks I could have betted 'em all to a single piastre that if the Doge of Venice himself had offered to have been his soninlaw he would have refus'd him for me and now to use me in this manner I am very much deceiv'd if he does not repent itwhat the deuce docs he want to make of me  Can such usage be borne  IndeedI'll be sworn  He fancies to make me a tool  A lacquey an ass  But I'll not let it pass  No no I'm not quite such a fool  'Tis all in my head and no longer I'll stay  But go and see how the nail drives  If I find he desires to be friends  And strives  For this conduct to make some amends  Not a syllable have I to say  But if he thinks  To palm on me this minx  Whose story's I warrant well taught her  Lord how I will use him  I'll scold him revile him reproach and abuse him  And then run away with his daughter  SCENE THE LAST  A large saloon in Pandolfo's house with folding doors on each side which being thrown open discover two different views of Venice  HENRICO FELICIA LISSETTA  afterwards  PANDOLFO  after him  ZERBINO  and then  HENRICO  again who comes forward after having concealed himself  Fel  Oh Henrico what have you persuaded me too I tremble to think how my father will be insenc'd when he finds we have impos'd upon him  Hen  I can't see that we have any great danger to apprehend he voluntarily gave me his promise to day that I shou'd marry you if you did not object to it  Lis  So he did I overheard him and if I had not I'd say I had if there was a necessity for it  Hen  Besides when he sees this Zerbino make himself so ridiculous  Lis  Which thanks to my ingenuity he will very shortly  Hen  I then have no doubt but every thing will go in our favour  Fel  The very thing you build upon I am afraid of  Hen  Well but my dear Felicia you have gone on thus far chearfully and now you drop  Fel  Consider what I hazard I may lose my father's affection that's all I fear and you should not blame me for if I am not capable of discharging  my duty as a daughter what security can you have for my making you a good wife  Lis  That's all very true Ma'am but its nothing to the bus'ness in hand we must to our posts for my part I know well enough what I have to do you Sig Henrico must get into your old hiding place and do you Ma'am look as prim and as demure as if you knew nothing of what's going forward  Hen  The merchants that with weary toiling  Are India of its treasure spoiling  Well might indeed their traffic prize  If rubies pearls and saphires they could find  Like your dear lips your teeth your eyes  Or orient gold as precious as your mind  Fel  A thousand cruel doubts distress me  On every side they thronging press me  I fear  I know not why  And though Henrico thou art near  I tremble droop and sigh  Hen  Ah cease ah cease by heav'n I vow  'Till life be past  My love shall last  As pure as now  Fel  Then wherefore this pain  Why should I complain  Both  Love befriending  Joy attending  On all our hopes shall smile  In thee my love delighting  Requited and requiting  Each night and day  That rowls away  With pleasure we'll beguile  Pan  Felicia what can be the meaning of a strange story I have heard from Zerbino  Fel  Nay Sir how should I know  Pan  I am convinc'd he could not mean to impose upon me and yet upon reflection I hardly think you could have been guilty of so much duplicity at the very time I had every reason in the world to believe you was perfectly obedient to my will  Fel  Let me understand you Sir  Pan  It does not signify repeating the matter he'll be here in a few minutes himself and thenOh here he comesZerbino I am glad to see you let us now clear up this affair you say you was informed that I intended to refuse you my daughter and give her to Sig Henrico  Zer  I was  Pal  Will you be content if I give her to you now and call in friends to witness it  Zer  I don't desire any better  Pal  Then take her hand and I hope you'll both be happy  Zer  Sig Pandolfo I did not think you was capable of using me so ill  Pan  Why is the man mad  Zer  No Sir I am not mad nor such a fool as you think me I find it's all true and perhaps you may repent it  Pan  Repent what  Zer  Why offering me your daughter's maid Do you think I can't see she's dizen'd out that way on purpose  Pan  Why FoolIdeot  Lis  Oh you have found it out have you  Pan  What would you have  Zer  Why I would have you keep your promise of marrying me to your daughter here she stands  by me frightened out of her wits and poor soul I don't wonder it  Pan  My daughter that's her maid  Zer  I knew well enough you would say so but your daughter or not your daughter I'll marry her and no body else  Pan  Why I tell you you are imposed upon  Zer  If I am 'tis by no body but you and you are only mad that your scheme did not take  Pan  Was ever man thus abus'd I could find in my heart to let him continue in his ignorance to punish him  Lis  Don't spoil a poor girl's fortune Sir you see he does not deserve your daughter bestow her then on Henrico  Pan  I thank you for the hint I made him a kind of promise this afternoon and I declare if he was here I'd give him her hand this moment  Hen  Sir I take you at your word and hope you'll never have cause to repent your promise  Fel  And can you Sir forgive my having deceiv'd you  Pan  Felicia you have not deceived me more than I have dcceiv'd myself I therefore not only forgive you but confess I was rightly serv'd for opposing your inclinations  Lis  And now I drop my disguise I assum'd the character of my young lady to prevent you Sig Zerbino from interrupting her happiness it has answer'd my end and I am sufficiently rewarded  Hen  Come come Lissetta you are two diffident this gentleman made a promise to marry you before me  Zer  I made a promise to marry her before you  Hen  Sir you know you did  Zer  Well then if I did I'll tell you whatI'll keep itshe has wit enough in all conscience and she ought to be made a gentlewoman of and as for money I have enough for us both so let's have no more misunderstandings but for the future be all friendswhat d'ye say  Pan  I accept your proposal with pleasure since things have turn'd out in this manner and Lissetta is in some sort a relation of mine my friendship and countenance you may command upon all occasions for my part I am perfectly convinc'd that two young people who have an affection for each other are able to baffle all the precaution in the world And for the future I wou'd no more attempt to oppose the decrees of love than I wou'd the decrees of fate  Pan  As light'ning shoots from place to place  Which through the clouds we wond'ring trace  Or darts a beam from Phaebus' face  Whose flight no eye discovers  Or from the moon a silver ray  Will glittering on a river play  So pointed arrows wing their way  To wound the heart of lovers  Lis  I am your voucher here's the pair  But trust me they may thank my care  Remember Sir the carrier  Who praying did endeavour  To help his team along the road  Cries out this time is ill bestow'd  Friend clap your shoulders to the load  Or you'll stay here for ever  Hen  What will you say in excuse  Your maxims are in little use  Too oft we find 'tis wealth profuse  The female heart bewitches  But you an instance rare remove  The shameful prejudice and prove  Though riches most prefer to love  Some love prefer to riches  Fel  Zerbirto take your Wedding Ring  Of serious sacred usea thing  That us'd or well or ill will bring  To mortals joy or sorrow  It sav'd us both to dayah think  From a rude precipice's brink  Where plunging we were sure to sink  In misery tomorrow  Zer  I see it and the Ring once more  To its right owner thus restore  By whom 'twas won it should be wore  Trust me I'll prove no rover  And now if fortune kindly sends  That we have pleas'd these best of friends  I've gain'd my most ambitious ends  And all my cares are over  THE END
