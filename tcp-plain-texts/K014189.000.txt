SCENE changes to  Sprightly  's House Sprightly and  Toby    Spright  Nay Faith  Toby  I pitty thee with all my Heart but thou may'st make a moral use of this unlucky Accident and learn to believe thy self no wiser than other People Go lay aside the Woman and and take up the Statue all things are now ready for the last Trial and it shall be put in Execution this very Evening  Toby  Truly Sir if your Worship pleases I had rather be the Carver's Man than the Statue for if the old Knight shou'd find out a Trick my Disguise wou'd be so heavy that I cou'd not run away and he might chance to shoot me thro' the Head with his Blunderbuss  Spright  Pish Fool you know he's so purblind he can scarce see  Toby  Ay but if he can't see he can feel tho' and Sir if he should happen to tickle my Sides I shou'd burst out a laughing and discover all  Spright  It's impossible he shou'd suspect thee I saw the Statue at the StoneCutter's who told me the old Gentleman expects it to be brought home every day My painted Canvas is exactly copied from the Original and the Pedestal 'tis to be plac'd on in the Hall is so high that he won't be able to reach your Sides or if he did the Daub is so hard and so thick 'twou'd deceive a nicer Touch than his I'll warrant thee But are the Fellows at hand who are to be concern'd in the management  Toby  They are all drinking at the next Alehouse and the Gentleman who is to act the Statue instead of me Sir is a Man every Inch of him He married a Woman who had beat six Husbands to death with the Butends of their own Muskets and in three Nights time made the wild Beast so very tame Sir that she fawns upon him like a Spaniel Bitch when she's afraid of a Kicking  Spright  Thou hast chose an odd sort of a Simile  Toby  but hark some body knocks Go see who it is  Toby  goes out and reenters with  Cuttum  Toby  An't please your Worship this is the Gentleman we were discoursing about  Spright  May I know your Name Sir  Cuttum  I am vulgarly known by the Name of Corporal  Cuttum  I have been a Soldier from my Cradle and a Cuckold from my MarriageBed Sir I have run thro' all the Mazes of Fortune but cou'd ne'r lay hold of the Gypsie I believe I'm too  honest  to be  prosperous  in this Age and if I live much longer I shall be too old to be  knavish  I wou'd gladly make some use of my time Sir for I have lately learn'd to remember that I come of a Race so much the Reverse of my way of living hitherto that egadif I continue honest much longer I shall be the only Fool of my Family  Spright  Pray Mr  Cuttum  what Country are you of  Cuttum  Why Sir to tell you the plain Truth there is no Country will own us and we own no Country we should be  French  by our Air and  Spaniards  by our steps Sir but a parcel of scoundrel Rogues about Town will needs have the  Cuttums  to be an  Irish  Family sor no other Reason egad than the reach of their assurance  Spright  Have you no Friends in Town to apply to  Cut  Yes Sir there's a Relation of mine generally known about Town he's a kind of a Wit and has writ Plays but he has an odd Humour that makes him incapable of serving a Kinsman  Spright  What Humour is that pray  Cut  Why Sir he has been so fond of fathering Strangers Children that he scarce knows how to look upon the Son of a poor Relation  Spright  Well Mr  Cuttum  you are a merry Fellow you know the task and the reward design'd you I suppose  Cut  My worthy Friend Mr  Toby  here has inform'd me at large and I am ready to prove with how much Zeal I would undertake an action of greater difficulty upon a less temptation  Spright  I assure you you have heard the utmost of your danger come the worst to the worst 'tis but a beating and that I presume you could bear with Resolution  Cut  Am I a  Cuttum  and do you ask that Question 'slife Sir bear a beatingWhy there's not a Branch of our Family but has Patience enough that way sor an informing Constable Bailiff's follower Female Tatler or Marshal of  France  egad  Spright  That's well I think all things are now in a readiness we'll go in and about it presently But heark'e  Toby  is your disguise come home yet  Toby  Four hours ago SirBut now you talk of a Disguise am I to be a Jew or a Gentile  Spright  Oh a Jew by all means Come along Mr Corporal while you are getting  ready I'll instruct you what to say to the Lady for the ill Success of my last Letter forbids me

Leonora    Sir  Tim    'Sbud don't tell me of my Promise ask any Statesman in Christendom if Promises are Chains on a wise Man's Will 'Tis true I told the young Fool  Sprightly  he should have you but that was when no Body of a better Estate was of his Mind Girl  Leon  The ties of Duty Sir first led me to encourage Mr  Sprightly  's Addresses in obedience to your Commands and now the ties of Honour forbid me to wrong a Man who so sincerely loves me  Sir  Tim    I gave him my word that if he could outwit me he should keep what he got with my good Will and a good Fortune but alas poor young Fool his Birdlime is no better than Chaff and an old Fowl is too wise to be taken by it I have defeated five or six of his Projects already and if he comes within the reach of my Blunderbuss have at him by Sir  Jeremy  Leon  Oh Sir you are the most barbarous of Fathers and have contrived this surest way to make me miserable  Sir  Tim    Goodnow Goodnow pretty TurtleDove how naturally it mourns the loss

of Change and Inconstancy  Enter a Servant  Ser  Sir here's a Man without has brought home a great Stone Thing that looks like the Great Turk Sir  Sir  Tim    How the Statue bring him in bring him in Sirrah  Exit Ser  Leon  Sir you are likely to talk of what I don't understand and if you please I'll retire to my Chamber  Sir  Tim    No no pray stay Daughter I'll warrant you if  Sprightly  was coming instead of the Statue you would not be in such haste to be gone but you Women never care much for a Man of Marble  Leon  I am all Obedience Sir  She turns her Back upon the Door and leans pensively against the Hangings  Reenter the Servant with  Toby  disguis'd like a Jew with great Whiskers and a short Cloak  followed by four Men bearing in a Frame upon which stands Corporal  Cuttum  in the Posture of a Statue  Toby  Save you Sirhave a care have a care gently gently I saySir Mr  Chissel  has sent home your Statue Sir and where would you please it should be set Have a care I say

Gentleman But my Master an't please you is sick a present  Sir  Tim  Old Gentleman Sirrah Is that your Hebrew Breeding Get out of my House you Rogue that Levitical Face of thine stirs up my Indignation  Toby  I beg your pardon heartily if I have said any thing that offends you Sir but pray don't be in a Passion for nothing is not the Work done as you expected it  All the while Sir  Tim  is talking with  Toby Cuttum  makes whimsical Motions from the Table to  Leonora  who leans pensively and don't observe him  Sir  Tim  Expected it Sirrah I did not expect to have the Figure to be sent home by a Rogue of a Jew Sirrah Let me look all round the piece egad 'tis to but the superstitious Dog has circumcis'd my Statue  Toby  Ha ha ha ha  Sir  Tim  Villain Rascal what am I to be laughed at

Baggage Don't you see what's the Matter That long bearded Rogue of a Jew has affronted me to my Face and beat out my Teeth behind my Back Rogues  Robin Harry Jonathan  what must I be murder'd and no body come in to my assistance  He runs out calling the Servants  Cut  I am glad he's gone for my Heart ak'd plaguily when he came to pull my Leg off 'Tis a lucky Mistake that he thinks  Toby  struck him but I'll take this Opportunity to speak to the Lady MadamMadam  He leaps down and stalks towards  Leon  who turns and shrieks at his approaching her  Leon  Oh Heav'ns what's here Ghosts Spirits Devils ah help help help  Cut  Nay now we are all undone and egad if you die a Maid 'tis no more than you deserve for your damu'd unseasonable squeaking  He runs to the Table and with much ado gets up and stands in his old Posture but for haste mistakes and puts the wrong Leg forward  Leon  Ah me I see too late this is a Trick of  Sprightly  's  Enter Sir  Timothy  and his Servants  Oh Sir I was half frighted but beg your  pardon for alarming you being in a melancholy Humour I had forgot the Statue stood upon the Table and looking that way on the sudden took it for a naked Man  Sir  Tim  Oh did you so good Daughter I see very well what you would be at this Excess of your Folly betrays the Lewdness of your Thoughts Let's see that Rascal Jew beat off my Spectaclesoh here they lieWell I vow this is a very curious piece of Sculpture no real Flesh and Blood could appear more lively If that Knave  Chissel  had not sent it by a Jew I could have been extreamly pleas'd with it  He views  Cuttum  all round who expresses a great deal of Fear  But stay I forgot to look whether I have nothurt the Leg tho'adso what's here I am sure this Limb does not stand as it did just now Daughter Daughter  Leon  Sir  Sir  Tim  Look here is it the right Posture or no  While Sir  Tim  turns to speak to his Daughter  Cut  puts his Leg as it was before  Leon  Right Sir Yes pray what ails it  Sir  Tim  Ails it 'Slife I am bewitch'dI am sure the Devil's either in me or my Spectacles why 'twas but this moment the Leg stood here and now  Cut  Death Sir stand out of my way or you're as dead as a doornail  Aside  'Slife I'll be gone while I may if I stay a quarter of an hour longer I shall be pounded in a Mortar  He leaps down furiously and runs out  Sir  Tim  Hey day is my House become an enchanted Castle What a plague I shall be hooted at as I walk along the streets if this Jest passes on me Here follow me ye Rascals I'll statue the Dog I'll warrant him  He runs out with his Servants after  Cuttum  Leon  What a wretched Condition has my Folly brought me to if I slip this Opportunity of escaping while the House is in so great a Confusion I shall be miserable for ever I'll get out the backway and trust fortune for the Event of my Undertaking  She goes out  SCENE  changes to a Courtyard with a Well in it Enter  Toby  Frighted  Toby  Here have I crawl'd about this quarter of an hour and can find no means to reach the Door without being discover'd by some of the old Fellow's Maidenheadwatchers and if I stay here much longer the danger will be equal A Pox take Petticoats for  Toby  if this be the Effect of following them What shall I dolet me think a littleadsbobs I have it I have an old black Mask in my Pocket with Horns upon it I'll tie it on and creep down into yonder

may so happen that  the Rogues will take me for the Devil that they say walks in this Neighbourhood and give me free PassageBut first down Cloak that if the Well be deeper than ordinary I may be sure to fall softly I'll tie on the Mask when I'm safe at the bottom So now for it Neck or nothing as the Proverb says  He throws down his Cloak and gets into the Well  Reenter Sir  Timothy  and the Servants with Guns Staves c  Sir  Tim  Who would have thought that the four Rogues who brought in that Dog of a Statue should have waited so cunningly to carry him off again upon occasion Adzooks but we maul'd them in their Retreat Go ye Rogues get ye into the Cellar and drink your selves drunk as a Reward for your Valour  The Servants go out bowing  Well after all this  Sprightly  is a brave bold
