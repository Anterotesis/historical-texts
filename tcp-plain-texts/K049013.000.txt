 JOANNA OF MONTFAUCON A DRAMATIC ROMANCE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AS PERFORMED AT THE TheatreRoyal CoventGarden FORMED UPON THE PLAN OF THE GERMAN DRAMA OF KOTZEBUE AND ADAPTED TO THE ENGLISH STAGE BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND  London Printed by Luke Hansard Great Turnstile Lincoln'sInn Fields FOR LACKINGTON ALLEN    CO TEMPLE OF THE MUSES FINSBURY SQUARE  TO THE READER  THE German original of this Play which its Author stiles 'a Dramatic Romance of the fourteenth century' has not I believe as yet been published It never came under my inspection and if it had I could have made no use of it not understanding a syllable of the language  The model upon which I worked was an English translation that professed nothing more than fidelity to the words of the author and this I have no doubt it correctly performed In this copy I discovered the framework of what might be made a splendid spectacle and the known liberality of those in whom the property and conduct of the Theatre are  vested has more than equalled every expectation I could ground upon their support What else I discovered except as above stated it may not become me to say for I have no right to pronounce upon an author who composes in a language unknown to me but certain it is I stand responsible to the Public for every sentence in this Drama now before them with the exception of a very few periods indeed and those of no great importance Let Kotzebue therefore answer for no more than belongs to himthe plot and fabric of  JOANNA  Whether I have marred it or mended it in the execution can only be decided when the Public shall be in possession of the means for comparing them  It has so rarely been my habit to write upon any plot but of my own fabrication and invention that what I assert in the Prologue is most strictly true viz  "All who cou'd judge my labour wou'd confess  "Originality had made it less"  Whether from inaptitude for the task or from whatever other cause my embarrassments have  proceeded such they have been and so many times have I woven and unwoven this Penelope's web that if plays were only to be appreciated by the pains they cost in composing this of mine would have a merit which I suspect the world will not be in the humour to attach to it Then indeed I should have one fair exception to set against the many instances of precipitation of which I stand accused but of which I cannot be duly convicted till it is known of how many hours my day consists and what portion of those I devote to my studies  I have heard several authors instance a dispatch in composition of which I have no conception but with respect to the drama now submitted whether I did or did not write it  stans pede in uno  I can only assure the Public I will never stand upon German legs any more but take my chance with my countrymen for so much of their favour as my own independant efforts can obtain for me  I have now been so often before the Reader that I must claim the privilege of addressing him as a friend whom I am not to flatter  and in whose company I am not to degrade myself by an unmanly stile of supplication assumed for no other purpose than to invoke his candour the which if he has not false diffidence will not create and if he has plain speaking will not offend I therefore shall not scruple to say speaking under the sanction of age and long experience that the diction of Joanna is not inferior to that of any of my most favoured plays I know I have outlived the time when a simple and consistent fable developed in correct and classic diction presenting characters to be found in nature and producing incidents not irreconcileable to probability can no longer attract I also perceive I have lived to see the time when not content with the eccentricities of our own stage we have gone to that of the Germans for fresh supplies of what we were overstocked withfalse writing and false moral It is too often that the success or failure of a play depends upon the  cast  not upon the composition of course the play is written more for the actors behind the curtain than for the audience before it this makes Tragedy run  riot and Comedy play the antick We have actors who possess such irresistible power over the risibility of the spectator that our writers for the stage find their account in availing themselves of those powers and produce a species of composition which departing from the character of the legitimate drama may be said to border very nearly upon farce and mummery  Where fashion points the stage will follow If endeavouring to write according to nature and good models the dramatic author finds himself deserted by the Town who but will be weary of the attempt If the public taste is vitiated the remedy is not with him the critic may take up the cause a good  dramatic censor  may do much but a scurrilous one can effect nothing Are authors only to be lashed and their misleaders to be passed over uncorrected The enlarged expences of our royal theatres do not warrant their proprietors in opposing themselves to the public tastehow then should authors undertake it  As I have been uniformly adverse in my opinion to the introduction of these German  dramas on the English stage it may well be supposed my reasons for undertaking to adapt this of Joanna were strong ones and in yielding to them I have only to regret that my endeavours have not been more serviceable to the interests of a theatre to which I have every obligation not only for the fair and honourable treatment I experienced from the proprietors but also for the warm and cordial support I received from the performers  Mr Incledon  in particular has a claim to my best acknowledgments for his very honourable and zealous perseverance in his duty under circumstances of such an afflicting nature as might have fully justified him for declining it  In the copy now printed I have not altogether adhered to the Prompter's book as it was altered after the first night's representation The Reader will observe I have retained the incident of Lazarra's falling by the hand of Joanna this I have done because I see no particular reason for departing so entirely from the author's first conception though good reason obtained in point of action for the alteration  that was made on the second night On the German stage Albert in the combat with his rival stumbles over the root of a tree and falls to the ground in this instant Joanna rushes in accoutred in the complete armour of a warlike knight and with a huge sword of twohanded sway dispatches Lazarra at a stroke Albert thus critically rescued rises and requests the unknown Knight to put up his visor when to his astonishment he discovers his preserver in the person of his wife How they may manage these matters on the German stage I cannot pretend to say perhaps their actors may be better duellists and their actresses more adroit in warlike operations than ours but if we found difficulty in the action simplified as it is how much more should we have been embarrassed in point of execution had we undertaken to perform it in the spirit of the original  In the concluding scene of the third act Wensel in the original gets drunk upon the stage and the keys are taken out of his chamber by Philip whilst his intoxicated father  lies buried in profound sleep If what I substituted in place of this incident is not so near to nature as the original it is certainly less offensive to decorum and better suited to the manners of our English stage When I am speaking of this scene unquestionably the most prominent in the play I cannot pass it over without acknowledging my obligations to the young and rising actor whose energetic and impressive execution in the character of Philip gave such brilliancy to the representation and displayed powers which when drawn forth by abler authors and better opportunities cannot fail to place him in the very highest rank of his profession  The Joanna of Kotzebue is kept out of sight during the whole time that Lazarra is in possession of her castle and of course is never before the audience but in the opening and conclusion of the play It appeared to me expedient to fill up this  hiatus  and of course her scenes in the middle acts are supplementary  In like manner Wolf in the original is  merely the shadow of a character The support of such an actor as  Mr Munden  is an object which every author will reach at with avidity I sincerely thank him for his cordial assistance I wish my efforts had been more proportionate to his merit To the performers who condescended to appear in characters neither adequate to their merits nor consonant with their feelings I have more to offer than acknowledgments I must beg them to accept my apology  As there is no music in the original I must in justice exonerate the author from all responsibility on the score of the discarded Page When his singing ceased his services were no longer wanted two songs were composed for this character though but one was performed these exquisite melodies will I hope be published by the composer and that I may not appear to keep that out of sight which will do him so much honour to produce I retain those songs in my copy and of course the whole part of Eugene  The overture chorusses and songs incidental  to the piece with four symphonies between the acts were all composed for the occasion by  Mr Thomas Busby  He also in the run of the piece substituted a new Quintetto instead of the Peasant's chorus in the opening scene and at the same time withdrew the finale of Joy Joy Joy and introduced upon the ninth night a shorter and most brilliant chorus to the following words  "Hail glorious day Death strikes our impious foe  "And Victory binds her wreath on Virtue's brow"  It is matter of the highest satisfaction to me to find that the Public have done justice to his eminent abilities I sincerely hope this his first essay in the dramatic line will encourage him to employ his talents upon a larger and more splendid scale Where genius so sublime is combined with science so profound what is there within the province of his studies which the world may not expect from  Mr Busby  As the opposition which was given to this play upon the first evening only of its performance has passed over me without injury I should have passed over it without a remark  but that I am given to understand an opinion was in circulation that I had vanity enough to conceive I had prepared a spectacle and composed a drama to rival nay to eclipse one that was triumphantly established on the sister stage As an author I have never appealed from the decisions of the theatre conscious that nothing can be more perfectly at the mercy of the Public than an author's reputation when he has committed it to the stage I have never offered a single word in arrest of judgment however rigorous nor persisted to obtrude myself when I had once discovered I was no longer welcome That we had no reason to yield the play up upon the partial clamour of the first night the event of the second clearly evinced not a murmur was heard and the applause was general If I had been the arrogant man which it is presumed I was thought to be by some of my opponents their resentment would have fallen so much more heavily upon the liberal proprietors of the theatre than upon me individually that there would have been infinitely more cruelty than justice in their  revenge But the task of adapting this German Drama to our stage was no work of my seeking and though I expended more pains upon it than I ever did upon any play in my life the hopes I formed of its success were chiefly grounded on the brilliancy of the spectacle and the excellence of the music As for Pizarro I envy not his success I do not aspire to rival it I cannot wish to lessen it and if any man doubts my sincerity let him put himself in the predicament of an author for years held off from receiving the fair and moderate earnings of his productive services and looking to that very fund for indemnification then let him ask his conscience what he would say to such an idle imputation and his answer shall be mine  R C  PROLOGUE  THE Scenes that soon will open to your view  In their first sketch a foreign author drew  If merely tracing his inventive thought  We set translation's servile task at nought  All who can judge our labour must confess  Originality had made it less  Our Dramatists you know in every age  Have copied from the French and Spanish stage  We have done lessfor save in plot alone  The work from top to bottom is our own    These four lines between brackets were not spoken  "Still if you think the British stage disgrac'd  "Is it by us or by the public taste  "Let our spectators stoop to your decree  "And as our masters are such we will be"  If thus tow'rds you in conscience we are clear▪  There's nothing from our foreign friend to fear  We've given him all our carewith music's aid  And painting's art his splendid scene array'd  That when his muse imperial shall be shown  Audience not less illustrious than her own  She may not have it in her power to say  A British stage disgraced a German play  The Author of our plot from married life  Selects his heroine a virtuous wife  This character as fearing to advance  Fiction too bold he paints as a Romance  We under no such terrors vouch it true  And for its living model point to you  Asserting you in grace and goodness show  All that was lovely centuries ago  Conscious tho' Wives of old were more demure  Your eyes may sparkle and your hearts be pure  Here we conclude for Music now prepares  Her better prologue to more moving airs  If knotted oaks will bend to her appeal  Need she despair that hearts of oak will feel  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  ALBERT  Lord of Thurn  Mr Pope  Lazarra  a Knight  Mr Holman  Darbony  Mr Incledon  Wensel  Castellan of Belmont  Mr Waddy  Philip  his Son  Mr H Johnstone

choice  JOANNA  It was a calumny  LAZARRA  And that your heart inclin'd you to Lazarra  JOANNA  That is untrue I never saw Lazarra but at a tournament and then he wore his vizor down  LAZARRA  But he contended for you with Lord Albert  JOANNA  He did and was defeated  LAZARRA  Do you think so  JOANNA  And languish'd long under the cure of wounds inflicted by my husband's sword  LAZARRA  Are you

out too early  JOANNA  Are you not rather home too soon my Albert  if your field sports might dissipate that gloom which for these three days past hath hung upon you  ALBERT  Alas the field affords no sport for me I shall not hunt today  JOANNA  Then for the first time I demand my right my part in your affliction Do not tell me that I am weak a womanand unfit to be the sharer of your secret thoughts Am I not Albert's wife and did the vow he pledg'd me at the altar only make me the fond associate of his happy hours not of his sad ones Oh my best of friends thou hast nurs'd me in sickness may not I cheer thee in sorrow  ALBERT  Excellent Joanna be satisfied I will not keep a worm to gnaw my conscience nor hold that back which is another's right  JOANNA  What is another's right  ALBERT  Ev'n all you seeThis castle at whose gate you feed the poor this rich domain was ravish'd from its owner the banish'd Lord of Thurn  JOANNA  Not by my Albert  ALBERT  NoWould to heaven my father had been clear from that reproach as I am But alas it was a guilty business my Joanna and tho' in candour I'm not bound to blazon my father's shame in honour I am bound to render justice to the Lord of Thurn  JOANNA  The Lord of Thurn is deadHe had no son  ALBERT  He had a daughter and if she survives she is the rightful heiress  JOANNA  Well where is she  ALBERT  That is not known Her father was attack'd and slain by robbers This daughter then an infant was with him and whether she was carried off alive or shar'd her father's fate remains in doubt  JOANNA  Then do we hold this castle but in trust till that doubt is resolv'd Let her be found  ALBERT  And is Joanna then content to lose what she employs so worthily  JOANNA  To loseHow is that lost which we've no right to keep  ALBERT  True but reflect that when this castle's gone my family estate is all that's left me  JOANNA  Is that allNo you have a faithful wife a lovely hopeful child a mind at peace and the pure bliss which unstain'd honour givesenjoyments Albert which who hath is rich in his proud poverty and who hath not is beggar'd by his riches  ALBERT  Glorious woman come to my arms This treasure is my own Nothing but death can rob me of this wealth  JOANNA  We will have treasure where death cannot reach it When conscious rectitude hath chac'd the cloud that wrinkles on your brow and with a smile you enter the small cot where I will meet you cherubs of health and peace shall deck the chamber of our repose with furniture more rich than kings can purchase the low roof shall mount above the pitch of palaces and towers and when I walk beside thee what imports it if leagues or inches limit our possessions Thou art my property thy love my treasure thy courage my strong castle and defence One robe adorns me thy untainted honour one costly jewel my beloved child  PHILIP  enters    PHILIP  If I intrude forgive me I was told you had ask'd for me  ALBERT  'Tis true I did good Philip this day completes the year that I have held you a hostage for the allegiance of your father my castellan of Belmont Now go in peace and greet him in my name  PHILIP  You have forgiv'n him wholly noble sir  ALBERT  'Tis not my practice to forgive by halves  PHILIP  You've buried in oblivion his offence  ALBERT  What I forgive I also can forget  PHILIP  So cannot I your most unbounded goodness  For life alone I am my father's debtor for virtue your's You taught me how to prize it and your example train'd me in the practice My father's failings you have never mention'd in presence of his son For this I thank you'twas delicate 'twas noble But I can no more When feelings are so strong expression fails  JOANNA  Farewell good Philip Let us often see you  PHILIP  Oh you are so great so rich  JOANNA  What's rich and great that fortune can reverse Let us be in your thoughts as you in our's  PHILIP  To the last breath of life Heaven and good angels guard you  Exit hastily  ALBERT  Worthy Philip his heart is full he never will forget us and in the day of trouble of whose coming I have an awful warning I predict that grateful youth will be a friend to serve us Hah who comes here with our old Warden Wolf

pray you look at his badgeI wave all comments on his hangdog  face I only say he wears Lazarra's livery and therefore catching him in the coat of a scoundrel I humbly apprehend he cannot fail to be of the complexion of a rascal  ALBERT  That's but an outside argument friend Wolf  WOLF  Sir take which side you will of a convicted thief and you shall find him still an arrant knave for here's the casethis fellow lurks about and hides in the thick woods why does he so Why but because the gallows stands in sight and 'tis a pretty eyetrap he has no taste for being a twoleg'd building without floors the which who takes possession of is left to dangle and cut capers in the airI pray you Sir give him a lease for life of that same airy tenement that skyparlour  ALBERT  How long has it been my custom to condemn a man unheard Let him speak for himself Are you in the service of Lazarra  ROMUALD  I am  JOANNA  Where is your master  ROMUALD  That I don't know I am on furlough  WOLF  You lie you

you are the son of a strumpet  ALBERT  For shame must your abuse sweep all his kindredWhat has Guntram done to deserve this of you  WOLF  Guntram's a cheat an old litigious knave he robb'd your father and he cribs from you rood after rood and in the dead of night alters the landmarks  ALBERT  Come no more of this  WOLF  Nay Sir I have not half run out his roll Guntram's a traitor harbours rogues and runagates javelin companions in Lazarra's pay who carry within their shields wicked designs against your castle's peace  ALBERT  Lazarra is a knight there's peace between us I will not hold his servantSet him free  WOLF  Well if it must be sountie him There get out Give him the rope however for a keepsake he'll find an use for it ere longNow go your waybe sure you rob and pillage all you

Then I've one one failing Wolf that thou art free from  JOANNA  Come my dear Lord I'll say that for our friend which is the best that can be said for any man he has an honest heart  WOLF  Thank you Madam you have said it just in time or I must else have said it for myself and of all the praise that can be given me I am least flatter'd by my own and much the most by your's  Exeunt severally

affection Belmont is near upon those glist'ning cliffs my father's watchtower stands when the sun sets bright o'er the glassy lake I'll take my crossbow in pursuit of game and visit my soul's treasure

Virtue's self  ELOISA  You are kind and partial to your Eloisa but I well know my father does not please you  PHILIP  I must confess his manners do not please me I would to Heaven my Eloisa were the humblest herdsman's daughter rather than Guntram's Can it be in nature that soul like thine so tender heart so pure and manners so refin'd and elegant should spring from such a stock Is he not shun'd by all the neighbours round a petty tyrant the oppressor of the poor  ELOISA  This may be true but I ought not to hear it  PHILIP  Rich to excess and grasping after more he would sell any thing ev'n

bible with a proper comment and are a very sensible old gentlemanI wish your table may be as well provided as your understanding  HERMIT  My fare is like my fortune poor and humble  WOLF  Heaven mend your fortune and fortune mend  your fare I now perceive grave Sir you are the Hermit so famous in these parts for your piety and learning I will not trouble you on these points at present being just now in greater need of food and rest than hymns and homilies  HERMIT  First tell me are you not of Wensel's company  WOLF  Indeed I am not 'Tis the last company I would wish to be in  HERMIT  Do you

the race being down in battle  with half a score of rapiers at my throat expecting every moment my quietus but this good father is a soldier's story and only should be told over a can  HERMIT  Come on then you shall have the can my friend and I the story for I love a soldier I dwell no further off than in that rock and have employ'd no architect but natureSo we poor hermits are content to live  WOLF  I know what sort of tenements your's are and how you live scotfree under the wind and pay no rent except to Providence on whose account you garnish out your lodgings with mementoes that mark the

embrace you as their brethren they meditate to throw their chains▪ about you and make you bondsmen under the pretence of moderation they would fain conceal monstrous ambition Iust insatiable of universal power and pride so vast that having vow'd eternal enmity to earthly kings they impiously assail the throne of Heaven and rather than confess a greater than themselves deny their GOD  ELOISA  enters carrying a basket    ELOISA  Father  HERMIT  My Child  ELOISA  Are you not angry with me for tarrying so long I ran to you at last and brought you something Are you not hungry poor old man

sleeping  ELOISA  Alasaday there is sad news abroad Have you not heard the doings at Thurn Castle  HERMIT  I have my child  ELOISA  That vile Lazarra is the worst of men and so is Darbony and so is Wenselaye and some others but I name no names All hearts bleed for the good Lady Joanna and as for Lord Albert he's the best of men  HERMIT  I do not know Lord Albert  ELOISA  That is much All poor men know him for he loves the poor  HERMIT  The Lord reward him  ELOISA  He gave to those that hunger'd he himself hungers in chains Alas I pity him  HERMIT  Yes human sufferings strike our hearts with pity and oft we wonder at the ways of Providence that thus permits good men to be oppress'd but whilst we only reason from effects Heaven acts from causes unreveal'd to us  ELOISA  Ah father these are things above my reach I have not understanding of these matters but believe it all because you say it You may have known variety of fortune I've no experience of that sort my life has been a scene of uniform depression I've often ask'd the history of your days but you've no confidence in me to tell it  HERMIT  'T will give you pain why should you wish to hear it  ELOISA  The tender pain that pity gives is pleasing  HERMIT  I have seen better days been rich and noble and all the soft affinities so dear to human nature I have fondly cherish'd Heaven's mercy gave them cruel man destroy'd them  ELOISA  Ah poor unfortunate you've been a father  HERMIT  I have and when you call me by that name the recollection that I had a daughter who might have been the blessing of my age

you shall hear me speak as softly to her as the zephyr blows Child this is Darbony a wealthy knight a gentleman of Florence one whose sword has carv'd him out a fortune by the wars that well may warrant him to say to any the best and proudest spinster in the land"Come Yorth and be my bride"  ELOISA  Well let him say it to any so it is not to me  GUNTRAM  How now do you rebel Do you murmur saucy chit I've said the word the bond is sign'd and seal'd you marry him this night You see I am calm you see I take a gentle course of persuasion with you but have a care how you chafe me take heed how you anger  me By all that's terrible if you hold off I'll have you dragg'd to the altar  DARBONY  Softly friend Guntram there you go too fast You are old and harsh your daughter's young and gentle  GUNTRAM  Aye tell her so You are a notable lover and she 'll tell you she is too young to marry you She'd not say that to me if I propos'd Philip of Belmont neighbour Wensel's son not she not she she'd jump into his armsBut she shall know these shuffling pleas won't pass she's your's this very nightHav'nt I said the word  DARBONY  Yes you have  said  the word but when the theme is love we hold it as the better way to  sing  it  "In spring's sweet prime the op'ning flow'r  "Allures the roving bee  "And is not beauty's vernal hour  "The hour for love and thee  "For like the bee love's archer leaves  "His honey with the dart  "And she who feels the wound receives  "A sweet that heals the smart"  GUNTRAM  There there you lucky girl you've got a husband whose very voice is harmony itself

'll be scraps in plenty to fill your wallet if you come tomorrow  HERMIT  'Tis not for scraps tis mercy and not meat for which I hungerOh for Heaven's sweet sake recal the cruel sentence you have pass'd and do not force this marriage on your daughter  GUNTRAM  Pooh you to talk a hermit Get you gone You're craz'd you're foolish go about your business    Exit  GUNTRAM  HERMIT  Persuasion's lost

with joy  PHILIP  Wine may confound and suffocate the feelings for a while but when the mad delusive dream is past and reason shows you where such dreams must end then will your cry be turn'd aside from Heaven and like the unhallow'd sacrifice of Cain prophetic of your doom sink down abhorr'd rejected and accurst  WENSEL  No more of this be dumb  PHILIP  Forbid me not Silence will come too soon

mother cares little for me  "Her love to another she gave  "I was wretched as wretched cou'd be  "Upon the wide world I was cast  "A poor little fatherless boy  "But fortune relented at last  "And my sorrow was turn'd into joy  "I am page to a lady so kind  "A lady so loving to me  "Such joy in her service I find  "I was happy as happy could be  "But those happy hours are gone by  "Our pleasure is turn'd into pain  "All is sorrow around me and I  "Once so wretched am wretched again"  JOANNA  enters    JOANNA  Eugene  EUGENE  My Lady  JOANNA  That's a mournfulsong  EUGENE  Aye Madam and a melancholy songster  JOANNA  You are young and will forget your sorrows  EUGENE  If Providence shall take my senses from me before it takes my life I may forget them not else  JOANNA  Then how shou'd I  EUGENE  Lady I went up to the tower this morning by the first peep of day and I do think I spied our brave old warden Wolf under the walls  JOANNA  Child 'tis impossible I saw him fall Wolf died as I shall die for his dear lord  EUGENE  Indeed indeed I cou'd not be deceiv'd Methought he saw me too and made a sign as if to call me down  JOANNA  You are mistaken Wolf by a noble death has finish'd a long course of faithful service Now go and ask permission for my child to visit his sad motherHah the tyrant    Exit  EUGENE  LAZARRA  enters    LAZARRA  May I approach and will Joanna deign to say

JOANNA  It is only one Let there be dug a grave where Albert fell and in the spot made sacred by his blood let me be buried  LAZARRA  Was there but one man in the peopled earth for whom Joanna will consent to live I'll hope there isI trust she will prefer life in the conqueror's arms to a cold grave with a dead corpse beside her  JOANNA  Break break my heart  LAZARRA  Nay if you weep it will not The heart that melts in tears will never break  JOANNA  This raillery shows a nature so debas'd that ev'n your cruelty has not one cast of manliness about it but aspires to nothing more than to insult a woman and make a widow's agonies your jest  LAZARRA  Be pacified This castle still is your's it has but chang'd its master all is your'sall that is mine and all that has been Albert's  JOANNA  Away I would prefer the vilest dungeon whose pestilential vapour fraught with death  should be so fatal that you dare not enter to freedom where I must inhale the air that you have breath'd  LAZARRA  You've said enough Tis done I shall not meet aversion so decided like a tame loverI will be your master  EUGENE  appears at the side scene with  JOANNA's  child    Take hence that brat He shall not enter here  JOANNA  May I not see my child  LAZARRA  No you may not Because you tauntingly pronounce my sight so hateful that the blast of death wou'd be more welcome I'll henceforth provide that if you ever let the light of Heaven visit your eyes you shall behold Lazarra I'll have a score of painters set to work and hang my portrait up in every chamber through which you pass 'till the detested image of him whose presence taints the genial air shall be so everlastingly impress'd on your mind's eye in darkness you shall see it in solitude in sleep I still will haunt you nor shall the grave itself conceal me from youNow follow me proud dame Do you rebelMove or my guards shall drag youHah 'tis well I will not quit you Tho' my passing shadow where it fell on you blister'd your fair flesh I

worthy Lord of Thurn out of his castleWill you suffer it  MOUNTAINEER  No no we will notwe'll revenge Lord Albert  WOLF  I knew you wou'd I knew you were true Swiss and wou'd not let those villainous interlopers tread in your lovely snows and track your pleasant mountains where nothing grows but icicles and libertyLord love you you remember poor old Wolf you have the steam of the castle kitchen still in your nostrils and know I was not the Wolf at the door to keep you out but to invite you inYou bear all this in mind I know you do  MOUNTAINEER  We do my master therefore say no more but march  WOLF  Oh yes I'll marchLazarra pays the piper so strike up We hav'nt got the true step but no matter We'll trot and our enemies shall gallop  Exeunt marching    PHILIP  is seen ascending from the

still Within this  cave you'll find repose and shelter enter it my Lord I will ascend the heighths kindle a fire and bring the mountaineers to your assistance  ALBERT  Thanks gallant youth a faintness steals upon me I must confess to you I need reposeAh Philip to be torn from those we love dearer than life and in the hour of danger by strong necessity driven to desert them judge how it wrings my heart  PHILIP  I doI judge I feel it by my ownNo more but enter    ALBERT  enters the Hermit's cave  Oh Eloisa 'tis thy cause no less than Albert's that gives wings to my impatience  Exit hastily  HERMIT  with  ELOISA  HERMIT  Here is my cell We'll take a short repose and then resume our flight  ELOISA  And wilt thou suffer all this for me Wilt thou for me exhaust the small remains of strength

ails thee There is nothing there no dying man to fright thee  ELOISA  Ah he's there the very man I see him there Lord Albert stretcht on the floor and dying as it seems  HERMIT  Merciful Heaven defend us who is this    ALBERT  comes from the cell  ALBERT  Be not thus cast in wonder I am Albert not dying as she thinks but sav'd from death if you betray me not  ELOISA  If we betray you we are not those that wou'd betray the wretch that fled from justice to invoke protection how then shou'd we betray the good Lord Albert the patron of the needy and opprest the orphan's father and the widow's friend Blest be the hand that rescued thee from death Say who it was that I may pray for him  ALBERT  Philip of Belmont  ELOISA  Oh approving Heaven crown him reward him for the glorious deed My Philip has preserv'd you I acquit him I was in like extremity with you at the same hour I call'd him to my rescue in vain his virtue triumph'd o'er his love He turn'd from me and sav'd his benefactor I praise him I applaud him for the choice you had a husband's and a father's claim for you the hearts of thousands wou'd have bled for me none other than his own  HERMIT  And mine  ELOISA  Ah father if you knew the Lord of Thurn  HERMIT  I hope he has been taught to know himself in his adversityI knew his father  ALBERT  I'm sorry for it if you knew him rightly for then you know what cause I have to blush when I am falsely stil'd the Lord of Thurn  HERMIT  That to confess bespeaks a candid mind for that I honour you but Thurn is lost What then remains  ALBERT  Before tomorrow's dawn either to see Lazarra at my feet or see the light no more if on the walls my banner flies it flies not for myself but for the daughter of that rightful Lord who in his banishment was basely murder'd  HERMIT  Alas that daughter never will be found nor was that father murder'd he yet lives and I am he Yes Albert I I am that wretched father degraded exil'd and at once bereft of wife son daughter outcast of the world no home no country not one friend on earth save this sweet innocent the feeble staff of an old beggar tottering to his grave  ALBERT  Oh heavenly justice how did I escape whilst you was begging at that castle's gate which I unconscious of your right usurp'd  HERMIT  That I am Theodore the banisht Lord of Thurn and its domain I had in proof to shew one relick which the robbers miss'd my crest a crowned lion cut in ruby but this last pledge I left in Guntram's hands for purposes which this dear child can witness  ALBERT  There needs no witness to the truth you utter and here in presence of high Heaven I swear to pay you homage and restore your right  HERMIT  No no your virtues have aton'd to justice you Albert have the blessings of the poor Had I possession what cou'd I have more I have no daughter the inhuman villains that robb'd and left me dying kill'd my child Within that cell I have preserv'd one relick one mournful relick You shall see my store  goes into the cell  ALBERT  I saw no relick What does he allude to  ELOISA  Alas I know not My heart melts with pity  ALBERT  This mourful story is not new to you  ELOISA  My Lord I've often ask'd but never heard it he

whom I have snatcht from misery and who clings as if by nature's charter to my heartfor her I make appeal to your protection and as in honour you shall deal with her so may Heaven deal forgiveness to your father  ALBERT  She is my care henceforth and would to Heaven when thus I take her hand in pledge of faith 'twas in my power to sayBehold your daughter    DARBONY  and armed men rush in  DARBONY

drawn my blood why should not I open a vein for him  ALBERT  Stand off and quit him What is your pretence for seizing this young woman  DARBONY  If I had seiz'd her and secur'd my prize I should have had a title Lord of Thurn superior to your own  ALBERT  What do you mean Is she not Guntram's daughter  DARBONY  I am your prisoner you have sav'd my life therefore I tell you fairly not one drop of Guntram's blood runs in those noble veins I would not treat with him till he confess'd it I marry Guntram's daughterno He stole her like a thief she is the daughter of Theodore the ancient Lord of Thurn and had I married her  ALBERT  Break off the father the father stands before you  HERMIT  Oh my daughter  ELOISA  Philip support me bear me to his feet that I may kneelOh tell me tell me truly

western flank the moat is fordable and the wall weakest there he has secured the bridge  WOLF  I wish we had done as much before he pass'd it but rogues are wiser in their generation than we dull downright fellows are in ours  ALBERT  Ah Philip my whole heart is sick with dread of what has pass'd within the castle  PHILIP  We shall soon have the castle  ALBERT  Shall we have the lives within it Shall I greet my wife Shall I embrace my son  PHILIP  Dismiss these terrors and repose your hope where you have lodged your faith Draw forth your sword We cannot fail to conquer when those we combat are the foes of Heaven  ALBERT  'Tis done Now heroes follow to the charge  PHILIP  A moment's patience Where shall we bestow this aged father and his defenceless daughter  ALBERT  Wolf you are wounded you shall stay behind there lives not one more worthy of that trust  WOLF  There lives not one less likely to perform it for though I have a reverence for old age and a soft side towards innocence and beauty yet if I hear the clash of swords in battle I must perforce turn out and make one with them therefore let me be foremost in the onset and last in the retreatthere is my post  HERMIT  I will not hold one hero from his duty and  though I can no longer wield a sword behold I have a weapon  shows a dagger  This and the darkness of the night will guard us therefore go forth and conquer  ELOISA  There is an arbour Philip knows the spot of nature's making in the chesnut grove beside the western tower there we may pass the anxious minutes and put up our prayers for your success

Apartment in the Castle of Thurn  JOANNA  enters  The monster will not let me see my child Well Heaven's high will be doneThere was a time when my afflicted spirit was prepar'd to die with Albert But last night in silence I commun'd with my heart and heard a voice that seem'd to cry within me  "Hold thine hand creature of God thy life is not thine own and none but he that gave can take away"  I started left my couch my lamp was burning the book of life was open on my table I read the text waspatienceand the word of inspiration sunk into my heart with influence so persuasive so serene that as I read I reasoned and perceived when Heaven is pleased to punish  'tis our part to suffer and submitEugene approach  EUGENE  enters to  JOANNA  Is there not something stirring in the castle that occupies my tyrant and reprieves me from his detested presence  EUGENE  I think there isScouts are for ever passing that scour the country round the walls are manned in all the watch towers centinels are posted and by what is going forward I should suppose he looks to be attack'd  JOANNA  Alas what can my helpless people do when their brave leader's lost and Wolf is killed and Philip is far off  EUGENE  Of Philip I know nothing but for Wolf I must believe he lives and that I saw him  JOANNA  Boy you're deceived let me not hear of hope save what the cheering recollection gives that all the sufferings of this transient life must have a speedy end of this assur'd I am prepar'd for conscience sake to brave all that Lazarra's fury can inflict to shake my honour or subdue my spirit for 'tis no question with me whom to fearhim a contemptible and shortliv'd tyrant that only can afflict me for awhile or that tremendous judge whose just award is happiness or misery without end  Exit  EUGENE  She's gone and knows not yet the full extent of her afflictionWhen she shall be told Lord Albert fell not in the field of battle but butchered by assassins in the dungeon of his own Belmont what will then support her Will sighs and tears relieve her sad despair Oh they wou'd I'd weep my eyes to water  "To sigh when sorrow loads the breast  "Is nature's kind relief  "To weep is almost to be blest  "Amid the burst of grief  "Sigh then sad dame if sighs may cheer  "A heart oppress'd as thine  "Weep and I'll double every tear  "For all thy griefs are mine"  Exit  SCENE changes to the Saxon Hall

thumping no more thundering  "No more burning no more plundering  "Soldiers smuggling  "Damsels struggling  "Parents flying  "Children crying  "Such the sorrows we have known  "Sorrow now is past and gone  "Joy Joy Joy  "Merry groupes shall now be seen  "Sporting on the village green  "Dancing round in jovial ring  "Whilst the minstrel smites the string  "All hands clapping all heels clattering  "Grandsires chirping grandams chattering  "Looks inviting  "Hearts uniting  "Smiles inspiring  "Kisses firing  "Such the joys that Peace displays  "Hail bright dawn of golden days  FINIS  Printed by
