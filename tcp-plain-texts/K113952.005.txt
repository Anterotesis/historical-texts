operations on nature Bounty recommended in particular at this season Vernal apostrophe Love the ruling passion in May The celebration of Venus her birthday in this month Rural retirement in Spring Conclusion  ETherial daughter of the lusty Spring  And sweet Favonius evergentle May  Shall I unblam'd presume of thee to sing  And with thy living colours gild my lay  Thy genial spirit mantles in my brain  My numbers languish in a softer vein  I pant too emulous to flow in Spenser's strain  Say mild Aurora of the blooming year  With storms when winter blackens Nature's face  When whirling winds the howling forest tear  And shake the solid mountains to their base  Say what refulgent chambers of the sky  Veil thy beloved glories from the eye  For which the nations pine and earth's fair children die  Where  Leda's twins Castor and Pollux  Leda's twins forth from their diamondtower  Alternate o'er the night their beams divide  In light embosom'd happy and secure  From winterrage thou chusest to abide  Blest residence for there as poets tell  The Cemini are supposed to preside over learned men See Pontanus in his beautiful poem called Urania lib ii de Geminis  The powers of Poetry and Wisdom dwell  Apollo wakes the Arts the Muses strike the shell  Certes Surely certainly  Certes o'er  Rhedicyna Oxford  Rhedicyna's laurel'd mead  For ever spread ye laurels green and new  The brotherstars their gracious nurture shed  And secret blessings of poeticdew  They bathe their horses in the learned flood  With flame recruited for th' etherial road  And deem  Fair as their father god Jupiter deceived Leda in the shape of a swan as she was bathing herself in the river Eurotas  fair Isis' swans fair as their fathergod  No sooner April trim'd with girlands gay  Rains fragrance o'er the world and kindly showers  But in the easternpride of beauty May  To gladden earth forsakes her heavenly bowers  Restoring Nature from her palsied state  April retire  Ne Nor  ne longer Nature wait  Soon may she issue from the morning's golden gate  Come bounteous May in fulness of thy might  Lead briskly on the mirthinfusing hours  Allrecent from the bosom of delight  With nectar nurtur'd and involv'd in flowers  By Spring's sweet blush by Nature's teeming womb  By Hebe's dimply smile by Flora's bloom  By Venusself for Venusself demands thee come  By the warm sighs in dewy eventide  Of melting maidens in the woodbinegroves  To pity loosen'd soften'd down from pride  By billing turtles and by cooing doves  By the youths' plainings stealing on the air  For youths will plain tho' yielding be the fair  Hither to bless the maidens and the youths repair  With dew bespangled by the hawthornbuds  With freshness breathing by the daisied plains  By the mix'd music of the warbling woods  And jovial roundelays of nymphs and swains  In thy full energy and rich array  Delight of earth and heaven O blessed May  From heaven descend to earth on earth vouchsafe to stay  She comesA silken  Camus A light gown  camus emral'dgreen  Gracefully loose adown her shoulders flows  Fit to enfold the limbs of Paphos' queen  And with the labours of the needle glows  Pursled Flourished with a needle  Purfled by Nature's hand the amorous air  And muskywestern breezes fast repair  Her mantle proud to swell and wanton with her hair  Her hair but rather threads of light it seems  With the gay honours of the Spring entwin'd  Copious unbound in nectar'd ringlets streams  Floats glittering on the sun and scents the wind  Lovesick with odoursnow to order roll'd  It melts upon her bosom's dainty mould  Or curling round her waist disparts its wavy gold  Youngcircling roses blushing round them throw  The sweet abundance of their purple rays  And lillies dip'd in fragrance freshly blow  With blended beauties in her angelface  The humid radiance beaming from her eyes  The air and seas illumes the earth and skies  And open where she smiles the sweets of Paradise  On Zephyr's wing the laughing Goddess view  Distilling balm she cleaves the buxom air  Attended by the silverfooted dew  The ravages of winter to repair  She gives her naked bosom to the gales  Her naked bosom down the ether sails  Her bosom breathes delight her breath the spring exhales  All as the Phoenix in Arabian skies  Newburnish'd from his spicy funeral pyres  At large  In roseal undulation Pliny tells us lib xi That the Phoenix is about the bigness of an eagle the feathers round the neck shining like gold the body of a purple colour the tail blue with feathers resembling roses See Claudian's fine poem on that subject and an elegant translation of it by mr Tickell in the first vol of the Poetical Calendar p See also Marcellus Donatus who has a short dissertation on the Phoenix in his observations on Tacitus Annal lib vi  in roseal undulation flies  His plumage dazzles and the gazer tires  Around their King the plumy nations wait  Attend his triumph and augment his state  He towering claps his wings and wins th' etherial height  So round this Phoenix of the gaudy year  A thousand nay ten thousand Sports and Smiles  Fluttering in gold along the hemisphere  Her praises chant her praises glad the isles  Conscious of her approach to deck her bowers  Earth from her fruitful lap and bosom pours  A waste of springing sweets and voluntary flowers  Narcissus fair in snowy velvet gown'd  Ah foolish still to love the fountainbrim  Sweet Hyacinth by Phoebus erst bemoan'd  And tulip flaring in her powder'd trim  Whate'er Armida in thy gardens blew  Whate'er the sun inhales or sips the dew  Whate'er compose the chaplet on Ianthe's brow  He who  Undaz'd Undazzled  undaz'd can wander o'er her face  May gain upon the solarblaze at noon  What more than female sweetness and a grace  Peculiar save Ianthe thine alone  Ineffable effusion of the day  So very much the same that lovers say  May is Ianthe or the dear Ianthe May  So far as doth the harbinger of day  The lesser lamps of night in  Sheen Brightness shining  sheen excell  So far in sweetness and in beauty May  Above all other months doth bear the bell  So far as May doth other months exceed  So far in virtue and in  Goodlihead Beauty  goodlihead  Above all other nymphs Ianthe bears the  Meed Prize  meed  Welcome as to a youthful poet wine  To fire his fancy and enlarge his soul  He weaves the laurelchaplet with the vine  And grows immortal as he drains the bowl  Welcome as beauty to the lovesick swain  For which he long had sigh'd but sigh'd in vain  He darts into her arms she smiles away his pain  The drowzy elements arouz'd by thee  Roll to harmonious measures active all  Earth water air and fire with feeling glee  Exult to celebrate thy festival  Fire burns intenser softer breathes the air  More smooth the waters flow earth smiles more fair  Earth water air and fire thy gladdening impulse share  What boundless tides of splendor o'er the skies  O'erflowing brightness stream their golden rays  Heaven's azure kindles with the varying dies  Reflects the glory and returns the blaze  Air whitens wide the tracts of ether  Been Are  been  With colours damask'd rich and goodly sheen  And all above is blue and all below is green  At thy approach the wild waves' loud uproar  And foamy surges of the maddening main  Forget to heave their mountains to the shore  Diffus'd into the level of the plain  For thee the Halcyon builds her summer's nest  For thee the Ocean smooths her troubled breast  Gay from thy placid smiles in thy own purple drest  Have ye not seen in gentle eventide  When Jupiter the earth hath richly shower'd  Striding the clouds a bow  Dispredden Spread  dispredden wide  As if with light inwove and gayly flower'd  With bright variety of blending dies  White purple yellow melt along the skies  Alternate colours sink alternate colours rise  The earth's embroidery then have ye eyed  And smile of blossoms yellow purple white  Their vernaltinctur'd leaves luxurious died  In Flora's livery painted by the Light  Light's painted children in the breezes play  Unfold their dewy bosoms to the ray  Their soft enamel spread and beautify the day  From the wide altar of the foodful earth  The flowers the herbs the plants their incense roll  The orchards swell the rubytinctur'd birth  The vermilgardens breathe the spicy soul  Grateful to May the nectarspirit flies  The wafted clouds of lavish'd odours rise  The Zephyr's balmy load perfuming all the skies  The bee the golden daughter of the Spring  From mead to mead in wanton labour roves  And loads its little thigh or gilds its wing  With all the essence of the flushing groves  Extracts the aromatic soul of flowers  And humming in delight its waxen bowers  Fills with the luscious spoil and lives ambrosial hours  Touch'd by thee May the flocks and lusty droves  That low in pastures or on mountains bleat  Revive their frolics and renew their loves  Stung to the marrow with thy generous heat  The stately courser bounding o'er the plain  Shakes to the winds the honours of his mane  High arch'd his neck and snuffing hopes the dappled train  Th' aerial songsters sooth the listening groves  The mellow thrush the  Ouzle Blackbird  ouzle sweetly shrill  And little linnets celebrate their loves  In hawthorn valley or on tufted hill  The soaring lark the lowly nightingale  A thorn her pillow trills her doleful tale  And melancholy music dies along the dale  This gay exuberance of the gorgeous spring  The gilded mountain and the herbag'd vale  The woods that blossom and the birds that sing  The murmuring fountain and the breathing dale  The dale the fountains birds and woods delight  The vales the mountains and the spring invite  Yet unadorn'd by May no longer charm the sight  When Nature laughs around shall man alone  Thy image hang ah me the sickly head  When Nature sings shall Nature's glory groan  And languish for the pittance poor of bread  O may the man that shall his image scorn  Alive be ground with hunger most forlorn  Die  Unanell'd Without a funeral knell  unanell'd and dead by dogs and kites be torn  Curs'd may he be as if he were not so  Nay doubly curs'd be such a breast of steel  Which never melted at another's woe  Nor tenderness of bowels knew to feel  His heart is black as hell in flowing store  Who hears the needy crying at his door  Who hears them cry  Ne recks Nor is concern'd  ne recks but suffers them be poor  But blest O more than doubly blest be he  Let honour crown him and eternal rest  Whose bosom the sweet fount of charity  Flows out to  Noursle To nurse  noursle Innocence distrest  His ear is open to the widow's cries  His hand the orphan's cheek of sorrow dries  Like mercy's self he looks on want with pity's eyes  In this blest season pregnant with delight  Ne may the boading owl with screeches wound  The solemn silence of the quiet night  Ne croaking raven with unhallow'd sound  Ne damned ghost  Affray Affright  affray with deadly yell  The waking lover rais'd by mighty spell  To pale the stars till Hesper shine it back to hell  Ne Witches rifle gibbets by the moon  With horror winking trembling all with fear  Of many a clinking chain and canker'd bone  Nor Imp in visionary shape appear  To blast the thriving verdure of the plain  Ne let Hobgoblin ne the Ponk profane  With shadowy glare the light and mad the bursting brain  Yet fairyelves  So antient custom's will The Lemuria or rites sacred to the Lemures were celebrated by the Romans in May They imagined the Lemures in English Fairies to be like ghosts of deceased persons But our traditional accounts are very different in respect to the nature of Fairies  so antient custom's will  The greengown'd fairyelves by starry sheen  May gambol or in valley or on hill  And leave your footsteps on the circled green  Full lightly trip it dapper Mab around  Full featly Ob'ron thou o'er grassturf bound  Mab brushes off no dewdrops Ob'ron prints no ground  Ne bloody rumours violate the ear  Of cities sack'd and kingdoms desolate  With plague or sword with pestilence or war  Ne rueful murder stain thy aeradate  Ne shameless calumny for fell despight  The foulest fiend that e'er blasphem'd the light  At lovely lady rail nor grin at courteous knight  Ne wailing in our streets nor fields be heard  Ne voice of misery assault the heart  Ne fatherless from table be debarr'd  Ne piteous tear from eye of sorrow start  But Plenty pour thyself into the bowl  Of bountyhead may never want controul  That good good honest man who feeds the famish'd soul  Now let the trumpet's martial thunders sleep  The viol wake alone and tender flute  The Phrygian lyre with sprightly fingers sweep  And Erato dissolve the Lydian lute  Yet Clio frets and burns with honest pain  To rouze and animate the martial strain  Since William charg'd the foe on fam'd Culloden's plain  The trumpet sleeps but soon for thee shall wake  Illustrious Chief to sound thy mighty name  Snatch'd from the malice of Lethean lake  Triumphantswelling from the mouth of Fame  Meanwhile disdain not so the virgins pray  This rosy crown with myrtle wove and bay  Too humble crown I ween the offering of May  And while the virgins hail thee with their voice  Heaping thy crouded way with greens and flowers  And in the fondness of their heart rejoice  To sooth with dance and song thy gentler hours  Indulge the season and with sweet repair  Embay thy limbs the vernal blessing share  Then blaze in arms again renew'd for future war  Britannia's happy isle derives from May  The choicest blessings Liberty bestows  When royal Charles for ever hail the day  In mercy triumph'd o'er ignoble foes  Restor'd with him the Arts their drooping head  Gaily again uprear'd the Muses shade  With fresher honours bloom'd in greener trim array'd  And thou the goodliest blossom of our isles  Great Frederick's and his Augusta's joy  Thy native month approv'd with infant smiles  Sweet as the smiling May Imperial Boy  Britannia hopes thee for her future Lord  Lov'd as thy Parents only not ador'd  Whene'er a George is born Charles is again restor'd  O may his Father's pant for finer fame  And boundless bountyhead to human kind  His Grandsire's glory and his Uncle's name  Renown'd in war inflame his ardent mind  So arts shall flourish 'neath his equal sway  So arms the hostile nations wide affray  The laurel Victory Apollo wear the bay  Thro' kind infusion of celestial power  The dullard earth May quickeneth with delight  Full suddenly the seeds of joy  Recure Recover  recure  Elastic spring and force within  Empight Placed fixed  empight  If senseless elements invigorate prove  By genial May and heavy matter move  Shall shepherdesses cease shall shepherds fail to love  Ye shepherdesses in a goodly round  Purpled with health as in the greenwoodshade  Incontinent ye thump the echoing ground  And  Defftly Finely  defftly lead the dance along the glade  O may no showers your merrymakes affray  Hail at the opening at the closing day  All hail ye  Bonnibels Pretty women  Bonnibels to your own season May  Nor ye absent yourselves ye shepherdswains  But lend to dance and song the liberal May  And while in jocund ranks you beat the plains  Your flocks shall nibble and your lambkins play  Frisking in glee To May your girlands bring  And ever and anon her praises sing  The woods shall echo May with May the vallies ring  Your maypole deck with flowery coronal  Sprinkle the flowery coronal with wine  And in the nimblefooted galliard all  Shepherds and shepherdesses lively join  Hither from village sweet and hamlet fair  From bordering cot and distant  Glenne A country borough  glenne repair  Let youth indulge its sport to  Eld Old age  Eld bequeathe its care  Ye wanton Dryads and lighttripping Fawns  Ye jolly Satyrs full of  Lustyhead Vigour  lustyhead  And ye that haunt the hills the brooks the lawns  O come with rural chaplets gay dispread  With heel so nimble wear the springing grass  To shrilling bagpipe or to tinkling brass  Or foot it to the reed Pan pipes himself apace  In this soft season when creation smil'd  A quivering splendor on the ocean hung  And from the fruitful froth his fairest child  The queen of bliss and beauty Venus sprung  The Dolphins gambol o'er the watery way  Carol the Naiads while the Tritons play  And all the seagreen sisters bless the Holyday  In honour of her natalmonth the queen  Of bliss and beauty consecrates her hours  Fresh as her cheek and as her brow serene  To buxom ladies and their paramours  Love tips with golden alchimy his dart  With rapturous anguish with an honey'd smart  Eye languishes on eye and heart dissolves on heart  A softlyswelling hill with myrtles crown'd  Myrtles to Venus  Algates Ever  algates sacred been  Hight Acidale the fairest spot on ground  For ever fragrant and for ever green  O'erlooks the windings of a shady vale  By beauty form'd for amorous regale  Was ever hill so sweet as sweetest Acidale  All down the sides the sides profuse of flowers  An hundred rills in shining mazes flow  Thro' mossy grottoes amaranthine bowers  And form a laughing flood in vale below  Where oft their limbs the Loves and Graces  Bay Bathe  bay  When Summer sheds insufferable day  And sport and dive and flounce in wantonness of play  No noise o'ercomes the silence of the shades  Save shortbreath'd vows the dear excess of joy  Or harmless giggle of the youths and maids  Who yield obeysance to the Cyprian boy  Or lute softsighing in the passing gale  Or fountain gurgling down the sacred vale  Or hymn to Beauty's queen or lover's tender tale  Here Venus revels here maintains her court  In light festivity and gladsome game  The young and gay in frolic troops resort  Withouten censure and withouten blame  In pleasure steep'd and dancing in delight  Night steals upon the day the day on night  Each knight his lady loves each lady loves her knight  Where lives the man if such a man there be  In idle wilderness or desert drear  To beauty's sacred power an enemy  Let foul fiends  Harrow Destroy  harrow him I'll drop no tear  I deem that  Carl A clown  carl by Beauty's power unmov'd  Hated of heaven of none but hell approv'd  O may he never love O never be belov'd  Hard is his heart unmelted by thee May  Unconscious of Love's nectartickling sting  And unrelenting cold to Beauty's ray  Beauty the mother and the child of Spring  Beauty and Wit declare the sexes even  Beauty to woman Wit to man is given  Neither the slime of earth but each the fire of heaven  Alliance sweet let Beauty Wit approve  As flowers to sunshine ope the ready breast  Wit Beauty loves and nothing else can love  The best alone is grateful to the best  Perfection has no other parallel  Can light with darkness doves with ravens dwell  As soon  Perdie An old word for asserting any thing  perdie shall heaven communion hold with hell  I sing to you who love alone for love  For gold the beauteous fools O fools besure  Can win tho' brighter wit shall never move  But folly is to wit the certain cure  Curs'd be the men or be they young or old  Curs'd be the women who themselves have sold  To the detested bed for lucre base of gold  Not Julia such she higher honour deem'd  To languish in the SulmoPoet's arms  Than by the potentates of earth esteem'd  To give to sceptres and to crowns her charms  Not Laura such in sweet Vauclusa's vale  She listened to her Petrarch's amorous tale  But did poor  Colin Clout Spenser uses this name in the Shepherd's Calendar c and his mistress is celebrated by that of Rosalinda  Colin Clout o'er Rosalind prevail  Howe'er that be  In Acidalian shade c These three celebrated poets and lovers were all of them unhappy in their amours Ovid was banished on account of his passion for Julia Death deprived Petrarch of his beloved Laura very early as he himself tells us in his account of his own life As for Spenser we may conclude that his love for Rosalinda proved unsuccessful from his pathetical complaints in several of his poems of her cruelty The author therefore thought it only a poetical kind of justice to reward them in this imaginary retreat of lovers for the misfortunes they really suffered here on account of their passion  in Acidalian shade  Embracing Julia Ovid melts the day  No dreams of banishment his loves invade  Encircled in eternity of May  Here Petrarch with his Laura soft reclin'd  On violets gives sorrow to the wind  And Colin Clout pipes to the yielding Rosalind  Pipe on thou sweetest of th' Arcadian train  That e'er with tuneful breath inform'd the quill  Pipe on of lovers the most loving swain  Of bliss and melody O take thy fill  Ne envy I if dear Ianthe smile  Tho' low my numbers and tho' rude my stile  Ne quit for Acidale fair Albion's happy isle  Come then Ianthe milder than the Spring  And grateful as the rosy month of May  O come the birds the hymn of Nature sing  Inchantingwild from every bush and spray  Swell the green gems and teem along the vine  A fragrant promise of the future wine  The spirits to exalt the genius to refine  Let us our steps direct where FatherThames  In silver windings draws his humid train  And pours wheree'er he rolls his navalstreams  Pomp on the city plenty o'er the plain  Or by the banks of Isis shall we stray  Ah why so long from Isis banks away  Where thousand damsels dance and thousand shepherds play  Or chuse you rather Theron's calm retreat  Embosom'd Surry in thy verdant vale  At once the Muses and the Graces seat  There gently listen to my faithful tale  Along the dewbright parterres let us rove  Or taste the odours of the mazy grove  Hark how the turtles coo I languish too with love  Amid the pleasaunce of Arcadian scenes  Love steals his silent arrows on my breast  Nor falls of water nor enamell'd greens  Can sooth my anguish or invite to rest  You dear Ianthe you alone impart  Balm to my wounds and cordial to my smart  The apple of my eye the lifeblood of my heart  With line of silk with hook of barbed steel  Beneath this oaken umbrage let us lay  And from the water's crystalbosom steal  Upon the grassy bank the finny prey  The Perch with purple speckled manifold  The Eel in silver labyrinth selfroll'd  And Carp allburnish'd o'er with drops of scaly gold  Or shall the meads invite with Irishues  And nature's pencil gaydiversified  For now the sun has lick'd away the dews  Fairflushing and bedeck'd like virginbride  Thither for they invite us we'll repair  Collect and weave whate'er is sweet and fair  A posy for thy breast a garland for thy hair  Fair is the lilly clad in balmy snow  Sweet is the rose of spring the smiling eye  Nipt by the winds their heads the lillies bow  Cropt by the hand the roses fade and die  Tho' now in pride of youth and beauty drest  O think Ianthe cruel time lays waste  The roses of the cheek the lillies of the breast  Weep not but rather taught by this improve  The present freshness of thy springing prime  Bestow thy graces on the god of Love  Too precious for the wither'd arms of Time  In chaste endearments innocently gay  Ianthe now now love thy spring away  Ere cold Octoberblasts despoil the bloom of May  Now up the chalky mazes of yon hill  With grateful diligence we wind our way  What opening scenes our ravish'd senses fill  And wide their rural luxury display  Woods dales and flocks and herds and cots and spires  Villas of learned clerks and gentle squires  The villa of a friend the eyesight never tires  If e'er to thee and Venus May I strung  The gladsome lyre when  Livehood Liveliness  livelood swell'd my veins  And Eden's nymphs and Isis' damsels sung  In tender elegy and pastoral strains  Collect and shed thyself on Theron's bowers  O green his gardens O perfume his flowers  O bless his morning walks and sooth his evening hours  Long Theron with thy Annabell enjoy  The walks of nature still to virtue kind  For sacred solitude can never cloy  The wisdom of an uncorrupted mind  O very long may Hymen's golden chain  To earth confine you and the ruralreign  Then soar at length to heaven nor pray O muse in vain  Wheree'er the muses haunt or poets muse  In solitary silence sweetly tir'd  Unloose thy bosom May thy stores effuse  Thy vernal stores by poets most desir'd  Of living fountain of the woodbineshade  Of Philomel sweet warbling from the glade  Thy bounty in his verse shall certes be repaid  On Twit'nam bowers AonianTwit'nam bowers  Thy softest plenitude of beauties shed  Thick as the winter stars or summer flowers  Albè Although  Albè the tuneful master ah be dead  To Colin next he taught my youth to sing  My reed to warble to resound my string  The king of shepherds he of poets he the king  Hail happy scenes where joy would chuse to dwell  Hail golden days which Saturn deems his own  Hail music which the Muses  Scant Scarcely  scant excell  Hail flowrets not unworthy Venus' crown  Ye linnets larks ye thrushes nightingales  Ye hills ye plains ye groves ye streams ye gales  Ye everhappy scenes all you your poet hails  All hail to thee O May the crown of all  The recompence and glory of my song  Ne small the recompence ne glory small  If gentle ladies and the tuneful throng  With lover's myrtle and with poet's bay May  Fairly  Bedight Adorn'd  bedight approve the simple lay  And think on Thomalin whene'er they hail thee  ODE TO MAY  WElcome sweet May far thro' a world of snow  Far have I travell'd to o'ertake thy dawn  Beneath thy footsteps virgin lillies grow  Now smiles the woodland forest and the lawn  Beside thee lo a pair of turtles fly  Emblems of summer and a milder sky  Two naked Loves twin sons thy steps precede  Each bears a basket made of roses twin'd  Two sporting fawns attend thee as they feed  Two silverwinged Zephyrs fan behind  Hail to thee mother of each fragrant flower  Begot by April on a fruitful shower  Sweet middle month between the harsh extremes  Of summer's calentures and winter's blast  Now gladsome flow the voluntary streams  And flowing seem to sayBleak winter's past  Sweet as thou art thy beauties more we prize  Plac'd like the line between two differing skies  Who loves not Maygo ask the vocal grove  The vocal grove proclaims thee with her notes  Lately confin'd blithe nature's children rove  While in mid air the linnet's music floats  Shrub plant and tree with every glossy flower  Enjoy thy beauty and confess thy power  Ye nymphs who with the virgin lillies vie  Now guard your virtue from the tempting swain  Beneath warm May a thousand dangers lie  Be deaf to all love's counterfeited pain  But when the bands of Hymen once are tied  If love directconsent to be his bride  SONG ON MAY MORNING  BY MILTON  NOW the bright morningstar day's harbinger  Comes dancing from the east and leads with her  The flowery May who from her green lap throws  The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose  Hail bounteous May that dost inspire  Mirth and youth and warm desire  Woods and groves are of thy dressing  Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing  Thus we salute thee with our early song  And welcome thee and wish thee long  THE SIXTEENTH OF MAY  BY G JEFFREYS ESQ  ELiza sweeter than the rose  On which the May its dew bestows  Eliza brighter than the morn  Whose orient beams the May adorn  Eliza claims my song today  The daughter of the queen of May  The feather'd choir from every tree  Salute the fair and sing with me  Well may they sing and well prefer  The month that gave the world and her  The world and she began in May  A tedious world were she away  But oh ye wings of fleeting time  Be tender of her glorious prime  Late may her eyes their fire resign  Still give us death so still they shine  And let her reign without decay  The queen of beauty and of May  A DESCRIPTION OF SPRING IN LONDON  NOW newvampt silks the mercer's window shows  And his spruce prentice wears his sunday cloaths  His annual suit with nicest taste renew'd  The reigning cut and colour still pursued  The barrow now with oranges a score  Driven by at once a gamester and a whore  No longer gulls the stripling of his pence  Who learns that poverty is nurse to sense  Muchinjur'd trader whom the law pursues  The law which wink'd and beckon'd to the Jews  Why should the beadle drive thee from the street  To sell is always a pretence to cheat  " Large stewing oysters" in a deepening groan  No more resounds nor "mussels" shriller tone  Seven days to labour now is held no crime  And Moll "new mackrel" screams in sermontime  In ruddy bunches radishes are spread  And Nan with choicepickt fallads loads her head  Now in the suburb window Christmas green  The bays and holly are no longer seen  But sprigs of gardenmint in vials grow  And gather'd laylocks perish as they blow  The truant schoolboy now at eve we meet  Fatigued and sweating thro' the crouded street  His shoes embrown'd at once with dust and clay  With whitethorn loaded which he takes for May  Round his flapp'd hat in rings the cowslips twine  Or in cleft osiers form a golden line  On milkpail rear'd the borrow'd salvers glare  Topp'd with a tankard which two porters bear  Reeking they slowly toil o'er rugged stones  And joyless beldames dance with aking bones  More blithe the powder'd tyewigg'd sons of soot  Trip to the shovel with a shoeless foot  In gay Vauxhall now saunter beaux and belles  And happier cits resort to Sadler'swells  THE MOONLIGHT NIGHT  Nox erat et coelo fulgebat Luna sereno  Inter minora Sidera  HOR  HAil empress of the starbespangled sky  At thy benign approach night throws aside  Her ravencolour'd vest and from her cave  Starts forth to visibility And now  With thy bright edging burnish'd on the eye  The treetops glitter Hills and vales and plains  Thy softest influence feel The weary ox  Forgetful of the labours of the day  Slumbers at ease beneath thy kindly beam  Tho' now the lamp that late illum'd the day  Its blaze withdraws to light up other worlds  I cannot weep its absence while this scene  Invites to speculation more refin'd  Witness this canopy of cluster'd stars  In dazzling order spread immensely bright  Witness yon glittering mounts and valley streams  Dancing beneath thy silvershedding orb  Mute are the choral warblers of the day  Yet tho' the choral warblers of the day  No more symphonious lull attention's ear  And tho' nor linnet sings nor laughing finch  Shrill twittles from the sprayO smiling night  Still still thou hast thy charms while Philomel  Is thine Ah let me hear th' extatic swells  By echo's voice return'dso sweet's the strain  The nymph enamour'd doubles every note  Save ever and anon thy softest trill  In imperfection dies upon her tongue  If aught of sound the troubled breast can sooth  And from its course avert the tide of grief  'Tis thine thou sweet musician Tho' thy dirge  Be querulous yet does it fill the mind  With solemn musing and celestial wonder  Nor yet I scorn O night thy loving bird  As on her ivyslaunting turret perch'd  Wooing thy brownest solitude she hoots  To some discordantyet again ere morn  Affright thine eye and rob me of thy note  Oh 'tis a pleasing melancholy air  Which fancy well may melodize How oft  From jarring strings harmonious sounds are drawn  Turn upwards eyes and see yon flaming arch  Beholdthere view the Deity immense  How glows each sacred light yon falling star  'Tis he who shines in all th' eternal One  Who form'd and rules with awe the wonderous whole  Here let the atheist tremble as he looks  And blush into beliefBut can there live  A monster so absurdWhere art thou then  Oh conscienceWhat asleepThen must thou wake  In torments wrapt when death disturbs thy dream  For know poor crawling worm of little faith  Thou canst not die the wretch that thou hast liv'd  Here let me gaze and in the trance of thought  Forget that I am mortalBut behold  Alas the prospect lessens and each star  From the fair face of sun retires eclipsed  With lustre more predominant Farewell  Sweet nurse of virtue contemplation sage  For I must leave thee now The busy day  My lingering chides I go till night return  To plunge into that sea of sin a bustling world  AN IMITATION OF SPENSER  BY THE LATE MOSES MENDEZ ESQ  YE baleful followers of the Blatant Beast  Who censure matters far beyond your ken  Behold I now present you with a feast  Rush forth like wolves from your sequester'd den  And mangle all the labours of my pen  Show ye rude louts your lewd unhallow'd rage  In this I share the fate of greater men  Pale Envy ever gnaws the laurel'd page  And 'gainst all worthy wight doth war pepetual wage  If thee sweet nymph these simple lines  Please  aggrate  If I may hope to merit thine esteem  Not with the proudest would I change my state  Of those who deeply drink Castalia's stream  And on Parnassus catch th' inspiring dream  Say thou dear noursling of the Paphian queen  Wilt thou ah wilt thou patronize my theme  So shall this measure blunt the tooth of spleen  Nor critic's tongue shall blast such favour'd lines I ween  See how the tribe of witlings shun the place  And deep in shades conceal their fronts of brass  The coxcomb talks of feathers cloaths and lace  Nay Codrus unimpeach'd doth let me pass  Codrus of pride and spite a mighty mass  Thus when a set of imps at midnight play  And tear the corses from the hallow'd grass  Soon as the sun unbars the gates of day  They fear his heavenly light and melt in air away  THE SEASONS  IN IMITATION OF SPENSER  BY THE SAME  SPRING  Annuus agricolis ordo breviorque laborum  Summa mihi tradenda  PRAEDIUM RUSTICUM  ERE yet I sing the roundrevolving year  And show the toils and pastime of the swain  At  The late mr Thomson  Alcon's grave I drop a pious tear  Right well he knew to raise his learned strain  And like his Milton scorn'd the rhiming chain  Ah cruel fate to tear him from our eyes  Receive this wreath albe the tribute's vain  From the green sod may flowers immortal rise  To mark the sacred spot where the sweet poet lies  It is the cuckoo that announceth Spring  And with his  Revengeful  wreakful tale the spouse doth fray  Mean while the finches harmless ditties sing  And hop in buxom youth from spray to spray  Proud as Sir Paridel of rich array  The little wantons that draw Venus team  Chirp amorous thro' the grove in beavies gay  And he who erst gain'd Leda's fond esteem  Now sails on Thamis' tide the glory of the stream  Proud as the Turkish soldan chaunticleer  Sees with delight his numerous race around  He grants fresh favours to each female near  For love as well as cherisaunce renown'd  The waddling dame that did the Gauls confound  Her tawny sons doth lead to rivers cold  While Juno's  Darling  dearling with majestic bound  To charm his  Lover  leman doth his train unfold  That glows with vivid green that flames with burning gold  The balmy cowslip gilds the smiling plain  The virgin snowdrop boasts her silver hue  An hundred tints the gaudy daisy stain  And the meek violet in amis blue  Creeps low to earth and hides from public view  But the rank nettle rears her crest on high  So ribaulds loose their front unblushing shew  While modest merit doth neglected lie  And pines in lonely shade unseen of vulgar eye  See all around the gallless  Doves  culvers bill  Mean while the nightingale's becalming lays  Mix with the plaintive music of the rill  The which in various  Circles or windings  gyres the meadow  Bathes  bays  Behold the welkin bursts into a blaze  Fast by the car of light the nimble hours  In songs of triumph hail his genial rays  And as they  Go  wend to Thetis cooling bowers  They bound along the sky and strew the heavens with flowers  And now the human bosom melts to love  The raptur'd bard awakes his skilful lyre  By running streams or in the laurel grove  He tunes to amorous notes his sounding wire  All all is harmony and all desire  The happy numbers charm the blooming maid  Her blushing cheeks pronounce her heart on fire  She now consents then shuns th' embowering shade  With faint reluctance yields desirous yet afraid  Now rustic Cuddy with untutor'd throat  Tho' much admir'd I ween of nymph and swain  By various songs would various ends promote  Seeks he to prove that woman's vows are vain  He Bateman's fortune tells a baleful strain  And if to honour Britain he be led  He sings a 'prentice bold in londs profane  Who all unarm'd did strike two lions dead  Tore forth their savage hearts and did a princess wed  But hark the bagpipe summons to the green  The jocund bagpipe that awaketh sport  The blithesome lasses as the morning sheen  Around the flowercrown'd maypole quick resort  The gods of pleasure here have fix'd their court  Quick on the wing the flying moment seize  Nor build up ample schemes for life is short  Short as the whisper of the passing breeze  Yet ah in vain I preachmine heart is ill at ease  SUMMER  BEneath yon  Knotty  snubby oak's extended shade  Safe let me hide me from the eye of day  Nor shall the dogstar this retreat invade  As thro' the heavens he speeds his burning way  The sultry lion rages for his prey  Ah Phoebus quench thy wild destroying fire  Each flower each shrub doth sink beneath thy ray  Save the fresh laurel that shall ne'er expire  The leaves that crown a bard may brave celestial ire  Or shall I hie to mine own hermitage  Round which the wanton vine her arms doth wind  There may I lonely turn the sacred page  Improve my reason and amend my mind  Here 'gainst life's ills a remedy I find  An hundred flowers emboss the verdant ground  A little brook doth my sweet cottage bind  Its waters yield a melancholy sound  And sooth to study deep or lull to sleep profound  The playful insect hopping in the grass  Doth tire the hearer with his sonnet shrill  The poolsprung gnat on sounding wing doth pass  And on the  Starting flyingout  ramping steed doth suck his sill  Ah me can little creatures work such ill  The patient cow doth to eschew the heat  Her body steep within the neighbouring rill  And while the lambs in fainter voices bleat  Their mothers hang the head in doleful plight I weet  Careless  Rechless of seasons see the lusty swains  Along the meadow spread the tawny hay  The maidens too undaunted seek the plains  Ne fear to show their faces to the ray  But all the honest badge of toil display  See how they mould the haycock's rising head  While wanton Colin full of amorous play  Down throweth Susan who doth shriek for dread  Fear notthou canst be hurt upon so soft a bed  At length the sun doth hasten to repose  And all the vault of heaven is streak'd with light  In flamy gold the ruddy welkin glows  And for the noonday heat our pains doth  Requite  quite  For all is calm serene and passing bright  Favonius gentle skims along the grove  And sheds sweet odours from his pennons light  The little bat in giddy orbs doth rove  And loud the screechowl shrieks to rouse her blueeyed love  Menalcas came to taste the evening gale  His cheeks impurpled with the rose of youth  He won each damsel with his piteous tale  They thought they listen'd to the words of truth  Yet their belief did work them muchel  Sorrow  ruth  His oaths were light as gossimer or air  His tongue was poisonous as an aspic's tooth  Ah cease to promise joy and give despair  'Tis brave to smite the foe 'tis base to wrong the fair  The gentle Thyrsis mild as opening morn  Came to the lawn and Marian there was found  Marian whom many huswife arts adorn  Right well she knew the apple to surround  With dulcet crust and Thomalin renown'd  For  Hardy valiant  prow atchievements in the wrestlingring  He held at nought the vantage of the ground  But prone

while night's regent pale clear  Doth thro' the sky her silver chariot steer  Whose lucid wheels were deck'd with dewdrops  The which like pearls descended on the plain  Now every youth doth clasp his

course did steer  And in her left a buglehorn she had  On which she  Often  eft did blow and made the heart right glad  In slow procession moves the tottering wain  The sunburnt hinds their finish'd toil  Follow  ensue  Now in the barn they house the glittering grain  And there the cries of "harvest home" renew  The honest farmer doth his friends  Salute  salew  And them with jugs of ale his wife doth treat  Which for that purpose she at home did brew  They laugh they sport and homely jests repeat  Then smack their lasses lips their lips as honey sweet  On every hill the purpleblushing vine  Beneath her leaves her racy fruit doth hide  Altho'  Albe she pour not floods of foaming wine  Yet are we not potations bland denied  See where the peartree doth in earth abide  Bruise her rich fruitage and the grape disdain  The apple too will grant a generous tide  To sing whose honours Thenot rais'd his strain  Whose soulinchanting lays still charm the listening plain  Thro' greyish mists behold Aurora dawns  And to his sport the wary fowler hies  Crouching to earth his guileful pointer fawns  Now the thick stubble now the clover tries  To find where with his race the partridge lies  Ah luckless sire ah luckless race I ween  Whom force compels or subtle arts surprize  More  Daedalus envying Perdix his nephew's skill in mechanics threw him into the sea He escaped death by being changed into a partridge  uncles wait to cause thee dolorous  Anguish pain  teen  Doom'd to escape the deep and perish on the green  The fullmouth'd hounds pursue the timorous hare  And the hills echo

against you rail  And saith you often magic arts do try  At times you wave Grimalkin's sooty tail  Or on a beesom vild you thro' the welkin sail  The stag is rous'd he stems the threatening flood  That shall ere long his matchless swiftness quell  And to avoid the tumult of the wood  Amongst his wellknown  Companions  pheers attempts to  Mix  mell  With horn and hoof his purpose they repell  Thus should a maid from virtue's lore ystray  Your sex my Daphne show their vengeance fell  Your cruel selves with gall the shaft  Bathe  embay  And lash from pardon's shrine the penitent away  Now silence charms the sages of the gown  To purer air doth speed each crafty wight  The wellsqueez'd client quits the dusty town  Grown grey in the asserting of his right  With head yfraught with law and pockets light  Well pleas'd he wanders o'er the fallow lea  And views each rural object with delight  Ne'er be my lot the brawling courts to see  Who trusts to lawyer's tongue doth much  Judges ill  misween perdy  Right bless'd the man who free from bitter  Sorrow  bale  Doth in the little peaceful hamlet dwell  No loud contention doth his ears assail  Save when the tempest whistles o'er his cell  The fruitful down the flowerdepainted dell  To please his eyne are variously array'd  And when in roundelay his flame he'd tell  He gains a smile from his beloved maid  By such a gentle smile an age of pain's repaid  WINTER  THE little brook that erst my cot did lave  And o'er its flinty pavement sweetly sung  Doth now forget to roll her wanton wave  For winter hoar her icy chain has flung  And still'd the babbling music of her tongue  The lonely woodcock seeks the splashy glen  Each mountain head with fleecy snow is hung  The snipe and duck enjoy the moorish fen  Like  Hermits  Eremites they live and shun the sight of men  The  Stupified  wareless sheep no longer bite the mead  No more the ploughboy turns the stubborn ground  At the full crib the horned labourers feed  Their nostrils cast black clouds of smoak around  A squalid coat doth the lean steed surround  The wily fox doth prowl abroad for prey  Rechless of snares or of th' avenging hound  And trusty Lightfoot now no longer gay  Sleeps at the kitchen hearth his cheerless hours away  Where erst the boat and slowly moving barge  Did with delight cut thro' the dimpling plain  Now wanton boys and men do roam at large  The rivergods quit their usurp'd domain  And of the wrong at Neptune's court complain  There mote you see mild Avon crown'd with flowers  And milky Wey withouten spot or stain  There the fair stream that washes Hampton's bowers  And Isis who with pride beholds her learned towers  Intent on sport the ever jocund throng  Quit their warm cots and for the game prepare  Behold the restless football whirls along  Now near the earth now mounted high in air  Thus often men in life's wild lottery fare  Who quit true bliss to grasp an empty toy  Our honest swains for wealth nor titles care  But lusty health in exercise employ  The distant village hears the rude tumultuous joy  The careful hedger looks the fields around  To see what labour may his skill demand  He mends the fence repairs the sinking mound  Or in long drains he cuts the lower land  That shall henceforth all sudden floods withstand  Mean while at home his dame with silver hair  Doth sit incircled by a goodly band  Of lovely maids who various works prepare  All chaste as Jove's wise child as Cupid's mother fair  She them discourses not of fashions nice  Nor of the trilling notes which eunuchs sing  Allurements vain that prompt the soul to vice  Ne tells she them of Kesar or of king  Too great the subject for so mean a ring  Her lessons teach to swell the capon's size  To make the hen a numerous offspring bring  Or how the wayward mother to chastize  When from her vetchy nest the weetless vagrant hies  When glistering spangles deck the robe of night  And all their kine in pens avoid the cold  The buxom troops still eager of delight  Round Damon's eyne a  A linen cloth  drapet white infold  He darkling gropes till he some one can hold  Next Corin hides his head and must impart  What wanton fair one smote his hand

rude winds those lips of softness kiss  Will Eurus stern the charms of beauty spare  No he will hurt my rosyfeatur'd fair  If aught so bright dares rugged carl invade  Too tender thou such rough assaults to bear  The mountain ash may stand tho' strip'd of shade  But at the slightest wound the silken flower will fade  A FAREWELL HYMNE TO THE COUNTRY  ATTEMPTED IN THE MANNER OF SPENSER'S EPITHALAMION  BY MR POTTER  SWeet poplar shade whose trembling leaves emong  The cheerefull birds delight to chaunt their laies  Where oft the linnet powres the dulcet song  And oft the thrilling thrush descanting plaies  Their tunes attempring to the silver Yare  Which gently murmurs here  A babbling brook but swelling in his pride  Sees two fam'd towns upon his bankes appeare  And the tall ships on his faire bosom ride  Indignant then rolls his prowde waves away  And somes ore half the sea  Sweet stream with shade refresht orehung with bowres  Entrailed with the honied woodbine faire  Where breathes the gentlest softest simplest aire  Stealing fresh odors from the rising flowres  Joy of my calmer howres  O sooth me with thy murmurs whiles I sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  With pleasance oft two silver swannes I view  Pranking their silken plumes with conscious pride  A comely couplement of goodly hew  Come softly swimming down the crystal tide  The crystal tide resplendent as it may  Looks not so faire as they  Whether their snowie necks they love to lave  Or pluck with jettie bill in wanton play  The yellow flowres that flote upon the wave  Orsdeigne to tinge their plumage lest they might  Soyle their pure beauties bright  But with slow pomp on the clear surface move  Sweet cygnets whiter than the newfaln snow  That silvers ore Thessalian Pindus brow  Purer than those that draw the queen of love  Fayrer than Laeda's Jove  Tune your melodious voices whiles I sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  Oft when the modest morn in purple drest  Wak'd by the lively larke's lovelearned laye  Unbarrs the golden lightgate of the east  And as a bridemaid leads the blushing daye  The sunnes bright harbinger before her goes  Scattring violet scattring rose  The jolly sunne uprist with lusty pride  Shakes his fair amber locks and round him throws  His glitterand beams to wellcome up his bride  Then bids his livery'd clouds before him flie  And daunces up the skie  Sweet is the breath of heaven with dayspring born  Sweet are the flowres that ore the damaskt meads  To the new sunne unfold their velvet heads  Sweet is the dewe the spangled child of morn  That does the leaves adorn  Sweet is the matin hymne the glad birds sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  With early step yon verdant slope I tread  Crown'd with the florisht bowre of cremosin health  Whence auntient Norwic rears her towred head  Norwic fair nurse of industrie and wealth  Down in the dale my lowly hamlet lies  Where truth without disguise  Where dovelike peace and virgin virtue where  Hence Bacon's villa greets my pleasur'd eyes  Bacon to Phoebus and the Muses deare  Seeking uncombred with the toyles of state  This groveembosom'd seate  The tufted hill the valley flowrebedight  The silver shinings of my winding Yare  The corn greenspringing and the fallows seare  The lambkins sporting round rural delight  From hence enchaunt the sight  And wake the rural pipe and tempt to sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  Oft when the eve demure with dewy eye  Clad in a lengthned stole of ravengray  Assumes the sober empire of the skye  The streakt west glimmering to the parting day  When golden Hesperus forthstreaming bright  The leader of the night  Marshals his radiant troopes and gives command  In heaven's hie arch their lovely lamps to light  Shouting he walks the Gideon of the band  When first the youthfull moon begins to show  Newbent her blessed bow  When or uprising from her eastern bowre  Fullorb'd she strives her glowing face to shroud  Gorgeously mantled in a lucid cloud  Or all her beaming brightness deignes to powre  The silver'd landskip o'er  And shepherd swains their evening carrols sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  Ore the newshaven level green I rove  Where the fresh haycock breathes along the mead  Or wander thro' th' uncertainshaded grove  Or the trim margent of the river tread  Where the soft murmurs of the poplars tall  To the streames liquid fall  Attempred sweet the museful mind delight  Where the lone partridge to her mate does call  Responsive in his homewardhasting flight  Where the lowe quail with modulation bland  Runnes piping ore the land  Where as I stray along the upland ground  The farreoff clock just trembles to my ear  Where the mad citties louder mirth I hear  When swinging in full peal a festive sound  The deep bells roar around  In mute attention hush'd I cease to sing  Nor hills nor dales nor woods nor fountaines ring  Now night's pale fires a peacefull influence shed  The flockes forget to bleat the herds to low  Loosely along the grassie green dispred  The slumbring trees seem their tall tops to bow  Rocking the careless birds that on them nest  To gentle gentle rest  Silent each one save the lone nightingale  Of all the tuneful sisters sweetest best  She soft musitian thro' th' encharmed dale  Powres daintydittied warblings to delight  The stillness of the night  'Tis sacred thus to tread the dewy glade  In the calme solitude of that still howre  To nature's God the gratefull soul to powre  Or in the silvery shine or doubtfull shade  By quivering branches made  Rapt with the aweful thought I cease to sing  Nor hills nor dales nor woods nor fountaines ring  When flaming in the zenith of his powre  Darting directly down his fiery ray  The hotte sunne leaving his meridian bowre  Enfevers with his beams the cloudlesse day  The gadding herd from such a fervent skie  To the cool thicket flie  Tormented with the bryzes teazefull sting  Th' enduring sheep in th' hot sands panting lie  The grasshoppers blithe insects daunce and sing  The mower swart his sweeping scythe forsakes  The damzels quit their rakes  And seated where the freshing shade is found  With joyous jolliment the daye beguile  Sweet is the quaver'd laugh the simper'd smile  When as the tale or gamesome song goes round  The vocal vales resound  Nor less to me whiles I essay to sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  Ye lordings great that in prowde citties wonne  Which gentlycooling breezes never blesse  In gorgeous palaces with heat foredonne  Come here and envy at my littlenesse  All on a hanging hill a simple home  For its small tenant roome  Safenested in the bosom of a grove  Where pride and strife and envie never come  Nor any cares save the sweet cares of love  A little garden gives a cool retreat  From the daies powrefull heat  Where flowes my gentle Yare whose bankes along  Th' inwoven branches like a girlond made  With wanton wreathing decke a daintie shade  While the smooth watry glass reflecting strong  With bending bankes and shades respondent vies  Pointing to downward skies  Here in this soft enclosure whiles I sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  Here bountious nature like a virgin faire  Whose ladie fingers deck the velvet green  With cunning colourings of broidery rare  Sweetly enterchang'd the varied shades atween  The grassie groundsoil as a lovely bride  Hath richly beautifide  Strowing the primrose pale the violet blew  The silver'd snowdrop and the daisie pied  The crocus glistering in its golden hew  The cowslip drops of Amber weeping still  The flaunting daffodil  The virgin lillie and the modest rose  The prettie pink the red and white yfere  Flowres of all hewes that paint the various yeare  And the mild zephyr that emong them blows  Around sweet odors throws  Scenting the soft enclosure where I sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  The chemist bee with busy murmurings  Extracts the soul of sweetness from each flowre  Such as the Syracosian Thyrsis sings  All in the shadow of the shepherd's bowre  The stockdoves darlings of the Mantuan swaine  In melting murmurs plaine  Sweet birds of such a swaine to be the care  The sootest he that ever chaunted straine  Or with the gladfull pipe enthrald the ear  Him as he sung the graces dauncing round  With their own girlonds crown'd  The nymphes that haunt the river and the grove  Whether his skilfull reed he sweetly charms  Or strikes the sounding lyre and sings of arms  Apollo him and him the Muses love  Their own blest quire above  Ah would they deigne their visits whiles I sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  Here the poetic birds no fear molests  Did I sweet tenants of my garden say  With ruthlesse hand ere marre your prettie nests  Or steal th' unfeather'd innocence away  For you my trees the spring's gay livery wear  For you the ripening year  Purples the plum in the deep cherrie glows  And tempers the rich honie of the pear  For you the laughing vine with nectar flows  For you the permain comely to behold  Glows with irradiate gold  The burnisht bough vermilioning for you  The mellow'd fruit beyond its time has hung  Well have you paid me for you well have sung  On nature's music shall we not bestowe  Gifts we to nature owe  Fond of our fellow poets while they sing  The hills the dales the woods the fountaines ring  An academic leisure here I find  With learning's lore to discipline my youth  By virtue's wholesome rules to form my mind  To seek and love the wise man's treasure truth  Oft too thy hallow'd sons enthroned hie  O peerlesse

ah in vain his art the poet tries  The power of numbers he exerts in vain  The maid regards them with unconscious eyes  And hears but will not understand the strain  Yet hath she seenfor nothing could conceal  The wild emotions of his labouring breast  The fond attention that devour'd her tale  The hand that trembled when her hand it prest  While his pleas'd ear upon her accents hung  Oft hath she mark'd the involuntary sigh  Love's "broken murmurs" forming on his tongue  And love's warm rapture starting to his eye  And she hath seen him whelm'd in bitterest woe  When her frown spoke some error unforgiven  And she hath seen each kindling feature glow  When her smile cheer'd him with a gleam of heaven  But when in verse he breathes his amorous care  As if she knew not what to all is known  His arts she praises but neglects his prayer  Nor deem the poet or the verse her own  Say then O say for sure thou know'st full well  Each tender thought with happiest skill to dress  His heart's strong feelings how his tongue shall tell  How speakwhat language never can express  Teach him those arts that did thy suit commend  When love first prompted Myra to be kind  And that those arts may prosper let thy friend  His love's soft advocate in Myra find  Then while the happy means thy lesson shows  To win the maid his passion to approve  Then Myra shall recountfor Myra knows  What blessings are in store for those that love  Myra shall tell her that from love alone  Flows the pure spring of happiness sincere  And love with power to lovers only known  Doubles each joy and lessens every care  And each warm transport of her conscious heart  And each fair hope that doth her state attend  With generous ardor Myra shall impart  And point her own example to her friend  And if her sense shall Damon's claim approve  And if her candour deem his vow sincere  Her tongue shall speak the interest of his love  Her gentle eloquence enforce his prayer  And all that tenderest pity can suggest  And each soft argument her thought can find  Myra shall urgeO be her pleading blest  To win her fair companion to be kind  And whenfor friendship must not pass them o'er  She gives the frailties of his youth to fight  O may her pencil placehe asks no more  Each little merit in the fairest light  Clara perchance may learn to love an heart  Proud tho' the boast it is an honest pride  Where nothing selfish ever claim'd a part  Which owns no purpose it should wish to hide  Warm with the love of virtue and mankind  At others bliss where social feelings glow  And where when sorrow wrings the worthy mind  The tear is ready for another's woe  This praise the youth is fond to call his own  No higher worth he seeks his claim to grace  His hope he builds upon his love alone  And his love stands on reason's solid base  No sudden blaze the meteor of a day  Its transient splendor o'er his heart doth pour  Kindled at virtue's fire the steady ray  Shall shine thro' life and gild its latest hour  If such an heart can please if such a flame  With kindred ardour can inspire her breast  His first ambition hath obtain'd its aim  To Heaven and Fortune he commits the rest  But if regardless of the honest prayer  The maid unpitying on his love should frown  If fate's worst shock the youth is doom'd to bear  Each prospect darken'd and each hope o'erthrown  Too humbly fearful of th' allruling power  To strike the blow that sets the spirit free  Prison'd in life he'll wait the appointed hour  And patient bend him to the hard decree  Yet ne'er however shifts the varying scene  Shall her dear image from his mind depart  Still fresh the lov'd idea shall remain  Warm in each pulse and woven with his heart  Unchang'd thro' life still anxious for her peace  For her to heaven his daily prayer shall rise  And when kind fate shall grant the wish'd release  His last weak breath shall bless her as it flies  Then when in earth's cold womb his limbs are laid  For sure her servant's fall shall reach her ear  Clara perchance will sigh and grant his shade  The kind compassion of a pious tear  Yesshe will weepfor gentle is her breast  Tho' his love pleas'd not she will mourn his doom  And haply when with flowers his grave is drest  Her hand may plant a myrtle o'er his tomb  This meed at least his service may demand  Thisand 'tis all he askshis truth may claim  No breathing marble o'er his dust shall stand  No storied urn shall celebrate his name  Enough for him that where his ashes lie  When kindred spirits shall at times repair  The prosperous youth shall cast a pitying eye  The slighted virgin pour her sorrows there  Enough for him that pointing to his stone  The sad old man his story shall relate  Then smite his breast and wish with many a groan  No child of his may meet so hard a fate  THE RECANTATION  AN ODE  BY Love too long depriv'd of rest  Fell tyrant of the human breast  His vassal long and worn with pain  Indignant late I spurn'd the chain  In verse in prose I sung and swore  No charms should e'er enslave me more  Nor neck nor hair nor lip nor eye  Again should force one tender sigh  As taught by heaven's informing power  From every fruit and every flower  That nature opens to the view  The bee extracts the nectardew  A vagrant thus and free to change  From fair to fair I vow'd to range  And part from each without regret  As pleas'd and happy as I met  Then Freedom's praise inspir'd my tongue  With Freedom's praise the vallies rung  And every night and every day  My heart thus pour'd th' enraptur'd lay  " My cares are gone my sorrows cease  " My breast regains its wonted peace  " And joy and hope returning prove  " That Reason is too strong for Love"  Such was my boastbut ah how vain  How short was Reason's vaunted reign  The firm resolve I form'd erewhile  How weak oppos'd to Clara's smile  Chang'd is the strainThe vallies round  With Freedom's praise no more resound  But every night and every day  My full heart pours the alter'd lay  Offended deity whose power  My rebel tongue but now forswore  Accept my penitence sincere  My crime forgive and grant my prayer  Let not thy slave condemn'd to mourn  With unrequited passion burn  With Love's soft thoughts her breast inspire  And kindle there an equal fire  It is not beauty's gaudy flower  The empty triumph of an hour  Nor practis'd wiles of female art  That now subdue my destin'd heart  O no'Tis heaven whose wondrous hand  A transcript of itself hath plann'd  And to each outward grace hath join'd  Each lovelier feature of the mind  These charms shall last when others fly  When roses fade and lillies die  When that dear eye's declining beam  Its living fire no more shall stream  Blest then and happy in my chain  The song of Freedom flows in vain  Nor Reason's harsh reproof I fear  For Reason's self is Passion here  O dearer far than wealth or fame  My daily thought my nightly dream  If yet no youth's successful art  Sweet hope hath touch'd thy gentle heart  If yet no swain hath bless'd thy choice  Indulgent hear thy Damon's voice  From doubts from fears his bosom free  And bid him livefor Love and Thee  LOVE ELEGIES  ELEGY I  'TIS night dead night and o'er the plain  Darkness extends her ebon ray  While wide along the gloomy scene  Deep Silence holds her solemn sway  Throughout the earth no cheerful beam  The melancholic eye surveys  Save where the worm's fantastic gleam  The 'nighted traveller betrays  The savage race so heaven decrees  No longer thro' the forest rove  All nature rests and not a breeze  Disturbs the stillness of the grove  All nature rests in Sleep's soft arms  The village swain forgets his care  Sleep that the sting of Sorrow charms  And heals all sadness but Despair  Despair alone her power denies  And when the sun withdraws his rays  To the wild beach distracted flies  Or cheerless thro' the desert strays  Or to the churchyard's horrors led  While fearful echoes burst around  On some cold stone he leans his head  Or throws his body on the ground  To some such drear and solemn scene  Some friendly power direct my way  Where pale Misfortune's haggard train  Sad luxury delight to stray  Wrapp'd in the solitary gloom  Retir'd from life's fantastic crew  Resign'd I'll wait my final doom  And bid the busy world adieu  The world has now no joys for me  Nor can life now one pleasure boast  Since all my eyes desir'd to see  My wish my hope my all is lost  Since she so form'd to please and bless  So wise so innocent so fair  Whose converse sweet made sorrow less  And brighten'd all the gloom of care  Since she is lostYe powers divine  What have I done or thought or said  O say what horrid act of mine  Has drawn this vengeance on my head  Why should heaven favour Lycon's claim  Why are my heart's best wishes crost  What fairer deeds adorn his name  What nobler merit can he boast  What higher worth in him was found  My true heart's service to outweigh  A senseless fopA dull compound  Of scarcely animated clay  He dress'd indeed he danc'd with ease  And charm'd her by repeating o'er  Unmeaning raptures in her praise  That twenty fools had said before  But I alas who thought all art  My passion's force would meanly prove  Could only boast an honest heart  And claim'd no merit but my love  Have I not satye conscious hours  Be witnesswhile my Stella sung  From morn to eve with all my powers  Rapt in the enchantment of her tongue  Ye conscious hours that saw me stand  Entranc'd in wonder and surprize  In silent rapture press her hand  With passion bursting from my eyes  Have I not lov'dO earth and heaven  Where now is all my youthful boast  The dear exchange I hop'd was given  For slighted fame and fortune lost  Where now the joys that once were mine  Where all my hopes of future bliss  Must I those joys these hopes resign  Is all her friendship come to this  Must then each woman faithless prove  And each fond lover be undone  Are vows no moreAlmighty Love  The sad remembrance let me shun  It will not beMy honest heart  The dear sad image still retains  And spight of reason spite of art  The dreadful memory remains  Ye powers divine whose wondrous skill  Deep in the womb of time can see  Behold I bend me to your will  Nor dare arraign your high decree  Let her be blest with health with ease  With all your bounty has in store  Let sorrow cloud my future days  Be Stella blestI ask no more  But lo where high in yonder east  The star of morning mounts apace  Hencelet me fly the unwelcome guest  And bid the Muse's labour cease  ELEGY II  WHen young life's journey I began  The glittering prospect charm'd my eyes  I saw along the extended plan  Joy after joy successive rise  And Fame her golden trumpet blew  And Power display'd her gorgeous charms  And Wealth engag'd my wandering view  And Pleasure wooed me to her arms  To each by turns my vows I paid  As Folly led me to admire  While Fancy magnified each shade  And Hope increas'd each fond desire  But soon I found 'twas all a dream  And learn'd the fond pursuit to shun  Where few can reach their purpos'd aim  And thousands daily are undone  And Fame I found was empty air  And Wealth had terror for her guest  And Pleasure's path was strewn with care  And Power was vanity at best  Tir'd of the chace I gave it o'er  And in a far sequester'd shade  To Contemplation's sober power  My youth's next services I paid  There health and peace adorn'd the scene  And oft indulgent to my prayer  With mirthful eye and frolic mien  The Muse would deign to visit there  There would she oft delighted rove  The flowerenamell'd vale along  Or wander with me thro' the grove  And listen to the woodlark's song  Or 'mid the forest's awful gloom  While wild amazement fill'd my eyes  Recall past ages from the tomb  And bid ideal worlds arise  Thus in the Muse's favour blest  One wish alone my soul could frame  And heaven bestow'd to crown the rest  A friend and Thyrsis was his name  For manly constancy and truth  And worth unconscious of a stain  He bloom'd the flower of Britain's youth  The boast and wonder of the plain  Still with our years our friendship grew  No cares did then my peace destroy  Time brought fresh blessings as he flew  And every hour was wing'd with joy  But soon the blissful scene was lost  Soon did the sad reverse appear  Love came like an untimely frost  To blast the promise of my year  I saw young Daphne's angelform  Fool that I was I bless'd the smart  And while I gaz'd nor thought of harm  The dear infection seiz'd my heart  She wasat least in Damon's eyes  Made up of loveliness and grace  Her heart a stranger to disguise  Her mind as perfect as her face  To hear her speak to see her move  Unhappy I alas the while  Her voice was joy her look was love  And heaven was open'd in her smile  She heard me breathe my amorous prayers  She listen'd to the tender strain  She heard my sighs she saw my tears  And seem'd at length to share my pain  She said she lov'dand I poor youth  How soon alas can Hope persuade  Thought all she said no more than truth  And all my love was well repay'd  In joys unknown to courts or kings  With her I sate the livelong day  And said and look'd such tender things  As none beside could look or say  How soon can Fortune shift the scene  And all our earthly bliss destroy  Care hovers round and Grief's fell train  Still treads upon the heels of Joy  My age's hope my youth's best boast  My soul's chief blessing and my pride  In one sad moment all were lost  And Daphne chang'd and Thyrsis died  O who that heard her vows erewhile  Could dream those vows were insincere  O who could think that saw her smile  That fraud could find admittance there  Yet she was falsemy heart will break  Her frauds her perjuries were such  Some other tongue than mine must speak  I have not power to say how much  Ye swains hence warn'd avoid the bait  O shun her paths the traitress shun  Her voice is death her smile is fate  Who hears or sees her is undone  And when Death's hand shall close my eye  For soon I know the day will come  O cheer my spirit with a sigh  And grave these lines upon my tomb  THE EPITAPH  COnsign'd to dust beneath this stone  In manhood's prime is Damon laid  Joyless he liv'd and died unknown  In bleak misfortune's barren shade  Lov'd by the Muse but lov'd in vain  'Twas beauty drew his ruin on  He saw young Daphne on the plain  He lov'd believ'd and was undone  His heart then sunk beneath the storm  Sad meed of unexampled truth  And sorrow like an envious worm  Devour'd the blossom of his youth  Beneath this stone the youth is laid  O greet his ashes with a tear  May heaven with blessings crown his shade  And grant that peace he wanted here  AN INSCRIPTION WRITTEN UPON ONE OF THE  Two seats in Ham walks called Tubs from their form which resembles an hogshead split in two  TUBS IN HAMWALKS SEPTEMBER MDCCLX  DArk was the sky with many a cloud  The fearful lightnings flash'd around  Low to the blast the forest bow'd  And bellowing thunders rock'd the ground  Fast fell the rains upon my head  And weak and weary were my feet  When lo this hospitable shed  At length supplied a kind retreat  That in fair memory's faithful page  The bard's escape may flourish long  Yet shuddering from the tempest's rage  He dedicates the votive song  For ever sacred be the earth  From whence the tree its vigour drew  The hour that gave the seedling birth  The forest where the scyon grew  Long honour'd may his ashes rest  Who first the tender shoot did rear  Blest be his nameBut doubly blest  The friendly hand that plac'd it here  O ne'er may war or wind or wave  This pleasurable scene deform  But time still spare the seat which gave  The poet shelter from the storm  VERSES WRITTEN UPON A

uncontroul'd  Your fairy sports and revels hold  And up and down wheree'er ye pass  With many a ringlet print the grass  If e'er the bard hath hail'd your power  At morn's grey dawn or evening hour  If e'er by moonlight on the plain  Your ears have caught th' enraptur'd strain  From every floweret's velvet head  From reverend Thames's oozy bed  From these moss'd elms where prison'd deep  Conceal'd from human eyes ye sleep  If these your haunts be worth your care  Awake arise and hear my prayer  O banish from this peaceful plain  The perjur'd nymph the faithless swain  The stubborn heart that scorns to bow  And harsh rejects the honest vow  The fop who wounds the virgin's ear  With aught that sense would blush to hear  Or false to honour mean and vain  Defames the worth he cannot stain  The light coquet with various art  Who casts her net for every heart  And smiling flatters to the chace  Alike the worthy and the base  The dame who proud of virtue's praise  Is happy if a sister strays  And conscious of unclouded fame  Delighted spreads the tale of shame  But far O banish'd far be they  Who hear unmov'd the orphan's cry  Who see nor wish to wipe away  The tear that swells the widow's eye  Th' unloving man whose narrow mind  Disdains to feel for humankind  At others bliss whose cheek ne'er glows  Whose breast ne'er throbs with others woes  Whose hoarded sum of private joys  His private care alone destroys  Ye fairies cast your spells around  And guard from such this hallow'd ground  But welcome all who sigh with truth  Each constant maid and faithful youth  Whom mutual love alone hath join'd  Sweet union of the willing mind  Hearts pair'd in heaven not meanly sold  Lawlicens'd prostitutes for gold  And welcome thrice and thrice again  The chosen few the worthy train  Whose steady feet untaught to stray  Still tread where virtue marks the way  Whose souls no thought whose hands have known  No deed which honour might not own  Who torn with pain or stung with care  In others bliss can claim a part  And in life's brightest hour can share  Each pang that wrings another's heart  Ye guardian spirits when such ye see  Sweet peace be theirs and welcome free  Clear be the sky from clouds or showers  Green be the turf and fresh the flowers  And that the youth whose pious care  Lays on your shrine this honest prayer  May with the rest admittance gain  And visit oft this pleasant scene  Let all who love the Muse attend  Who loves the Muse is virtue's friend  Such then alone may venture here  Who free from guilt are free from fear

Drurylane theatre is said to have first planned Ranelagh  Lacy's great design  And ye who from the fields which lie  Round Chelsea with amazement's eye  The gardens and the dome survey  Whose walks whose trees whose lights among  Wander the courtly train along  Their thoughtdispelling way  Ah splendid room ah pleasing shade  Ah walks belov'd in vain  Where oft in happier times I stray'd  A stranger then to pain  I feel the gales which from you blow  A momentary bliss bestow  As waving fresh their gladsome wing  They seem to sooth my famish'd soul  And redolent of tea and roll  To breathe a second spring  Rotonda say for thou hast seen  Full many a sprightly race  In thy bright round with step serene  The paths of pleasure trace  Who chiefly now delight to lave  Green hyson in the boiling wave  The sable coffee which distill  What lounging progeny are found  Who stroll incessant round and round  Like horses in a mill  While some on earnest business dream  And gravely stupid try  To search each complicated scheme  Of public policy  Some ladies leave the spacious dome  Around the garden's maze to roam  And unknown regions dare descry  Still as they walk they look behind  Lest fame a secret foe should find  From some malicious eye  Loud mirth is theirs and pleasing praise  To beauty's shrine address'd  The sprightly songs the melting lays  Which charm the soften'd breast  Theirs lively wit invention free  The sharp bon mot keen repartee  And every art coquets employ  The thoughtless day the jocund night  The spirits brisk the sorrows light  That fly th'

With all the troop of rage and fear  That follows close behind  Or pining love shall waste their youth  Or jealousy with rankling tooth  That gnaws bright Hymen's golden chain  Who opens wide the fatal gate  For sad distrust and ruthless hate  And Sorrow's pallid train  Ambition this shall tempt to fix  Her hopes on something high  To barter for a coach and fix  Her peace and liberty  The stings of Scandal these shall try  And Affectation's haughty eye  That scowls on those it us'd to greet  The cutting sneer th' abusive song  And false report that glides along  With neverresting feet  And lo where in the vale of years  A grizly tribe are seen  Fancy's pale family of fears  More hideous than their queen  Struck with th' imaginary crew  Which artless Nature never knew  These aid from quacks and cordials beg  While this transform'd by folly's hand  Remains awhile at her command  A teapot or an egg  To each her sufferings all must grieve  And pour a silent groan  At homage others charms receive  Or slights that meet their own  But ill the voice of truth severe  Will suit the gay regardless ear  Whose joy in mirth and revels lies  Thought would destroy this paradise  No moreWhere ignorance is bliss  'Tis folly to be wise  HP  THE RIVAL BEAUTIES  BY JEW  Tantaene animis coelestibus irae  VIRG  FRom gay St James's Myra was return'd  Within her breast the flames of envy burn'd  Reclin'd upon the couch she sought relief  But the soft plumage added to her grief  Now to the citron cordial she applies  The cordial too its usual balm denies  Will not kind Morpheus one short nap bestow  He never perches on a breast of woe  What has her peerless face betray'd some flaws  Or does some mighty loss the conflict cause  Has some dire pimple to disturb her eye  Made an irruption where the lillies lie  Smokes there less incense at her virgin shrine  Or crowns some rivaltoast th' enamour'd wine  What can she dread whose every charm subdues  The garter'd nobleand invites the muse  Not one of those nor all of them conjoin'd  Have ruffled the composure of her mind  But at the court she saw what tongue can tell  Worse than Quevedo's visionary hell  A female implement and at the sight  Her spirit sunkshe swoon'd away for spite  Clarinda's hand the glittering pageant grac'd  With which she led the beaux and men of taste  Discarded Myra saw the envied prize  She sawand curst it with her heart and eyes  So even at church if some new dress arrive  The blazing meteor galls the female hive  Each eye arrested on the fashion glotes  And every woman imprecates and doats  The clerk's proud wife neglects her husband's song  And comminations fly from every tongue  A fan the mighty cause of Myra's care  For beauties envy trifles light as air  The fashion dawn'd from madam Pompadour  Newly imported to the British shore  Clarinda to improve her magazine  Of charmshad lately at the toyshop been  Searching for trinkets she the bawble found  And seiz'd the product of a foreign ground  Resolving to transplant it to the court  She bought and paid a hundred guineas for't  Arm'd with this bright umbrella she appear'd  And wafted by its gales to conquest steer'd  A hecatomb of hearts were soon resign'd  To young Clarinda's eyes intrench'd behind  While stars and garters emulating strove  Which should croud foremost to present his love  His vows thro' this gay medium to enhance  Such are thy fashionable toolsoh France  While thus Clarinda's innovating pride  From Myra's charms drew dukes and lords aside  Like a discarded statesman in disgrace  The fair one to the victor left the place  Thus like a beaten general forc'd to yield  She quits the glories of the longfought field  In sullen discontent she seeks the gloom  To meditate revenge within her room  At length to Venus with uplifted eyes  And fervent prayer the baffled maid applies  " Oh Venus by thy myrtles and thy doves  " And every symbol of the Paphian groves  " By all thy bright regalia I implore  " Oh grant one favour to thy Myra more  " Let not Clarinda such a conquest boast  " Nor lead of nobles thus her shining host  " For lo what stars like silver Cynthia's train  " Attend her triumph and support her reign  " See how each garter like the Zodiac vies  " To grace the blue horizon of her eyes  " Debase her trinket her newfangled toy  " And crush the infant dawning of her joy  " Give me by some rich implement to win  " The mentho' 'twere a diamondheaded pin  " Then shall a thousand hearts a thousand days  " With sweetest incense on thy altars blaze  " Then for each lover which thy gift imparts  " A hymn shall carol to the God of Hearts"  Propitious Venus heard the maiden's prayer  And sent a pleasing dream to sooth her care  Fair to her raptur'd fancy there arose  A crimson orb but richer far than those  Which stately cardinals in triumph wear  The boon and earnest of the papal chair  Its ample brim three rows of sapphires grac'd  The cestus as a ribband gave it taste  A thousand brilliants here and there display'd  With blushing rubies lent it light and shade  In emerald cut a king imperial sate  Beneath a golden canopy of state  Powder'd with hieroglyphics of his reign  As undisputed monarch of the main  The consort of his throne was seated nigh  In pearl and clearest crystal form'd each eye  Attending nobles the regalia bore  The crown and sceptre both of massy ore  In solemn order the procession moves  A prelate waits to crown their happy loves  Why should we here describe what all have seen  The coronation of a king and queen  Or why attempt in colours to display  That state when George and Charlotte blest the day  Dazzled with lustre Myra now awakes  And from the visionary model takes  A hat which soon eclips'd Clarinda's fan  Nor left the fair competitor a man  With this she claims Love's empire as her own  Reigns absolute nor envies George his throne  WOMAN'S AGE  BY THE SAME  WOman's age is seldom known  From fifteen to fiftyone  Still mendacious never certain  Still conceal'd behind the curtain  And tho' kind papa has wrote  Year and month and dayto note  Miss's age within the bible  The leaf she'll tear out as a libel  On her fame and reputation  Age can't bear examination  Tho' the crowfeet near her eyes  Prove she's older than she's wife  Tho' the wrinkles like a gnomon  Point her out a grave old woman  Still the matron hides the cheat  With sweet powder or a tète  Phillis confronted with grey hairs  Retrenches half a dozen years  While Chloe immature and green  Tells every one she's past nineteen  What are their different motives then  To cheat if possible the men  Sage Phillis knows her bloom is flitting  While Chloe fain would be thought fitting  This sets our teeth on edge and that  By being overripeis flat  Thus tho' they play a separate game  From the same view they take their aim  While neither boasts the pleasing flavour  Both study to attract our favour  Tho' this is verjuice that molasses  They'll cheat their very lookingglasses  Young Chloe like a watch too fast  Would antedate the hour not past  While Phillis like a clock that's down  Will never let the hour be known  Thus contradictory both move  Too little or too much for love  So have I seen to sell bad wines  A flying horse on painted signs  In seeming motion thro' the air  Ne'er quit his wooden hemisphere  THE BREACH OF THE RIVERS  BY THE SAME  Quae vos dementia cepit  VIRG  THE rivers once their union broke  For reasons like us English folk  Because they knew not why  The gentry took it in their head  To run no more but keep their bed  And let the sea go dry  For why forsooth should they be always going  To keep him full and humour his o'erflowing  They would support no more not they  His royal tidings twice a day  His tides of ebb and flood  The Danube swore it and the Rhine  Made oath upon his richest wine  To make the compact good  Nonohe truly did not understand  Why his imperial streams should brook command  And next appear'd the Ohio  With castles laden was his brow  By which he solemn swore  That if the Missisippi join'd  And was as well as he inclin'd  He'd go to sea no more  The Missisippi gave his oath that he  Would be as true and to the league agree  Next spoke the Severn's stately tide  " SirsI will curb old Ocean's pride  " Here do I daily pour  " Millions of tons for Ocean's use  " And truly he'll have no excuse  " He'll have 'em at the hour  " Now by the river gods and nymphs not I  " Let him draw bills on sight upon the sky  " Yes let the surlymouthed main  " Draw on his magazines of rain  " What say you brother Trent  " What says the Thames to this proposal  " Are we at this proud king's disposal  " To pay a high rackrent  " Whene'er he pleases to demand our treasure  " And lord it o'er us at his tyrant pleasure"  The flames are kindledCritics hold  You'll say th' allusion is too bold  Can flames in rivers burn  O yesSedition's voice can change  The blood and juices like the mange  And to corruption turn  The sweet and wholsome crasis of the blood  And so far Critics the allusion's good  Th' assembly fillsNorthumbrian Tyne  Swore by his salmon he would join  And by his sooty gods  That tho' all England starv'd with cold  He'd waft the coals no more for gold  He matter'd not the odds  What was't to him or his if he must creep  And cringe to do obeisance to the Deep  There was not even a tench or carp  That did not on the topic harp  Nonor a trout or eel  The meanest native of the stream  Could dwell upon the pleasing theme  To save the commonweal  The public good was now the general cry  Even in the mouths of the small salmonfry  Vox Populi Vox Dei loud  Was heard thro' all the finny croud  And all the rivers swore  By their respective nymphs that they  Would henceforth go no more to sea  Nor make a voyage more  The motion was unanimous agreed  From smoothwav'd Medway to the northern Tweed  What was the dreadful consequence  The waters broke o'er mound and fence  And overflow'd their banks  An inundation says my fable  O'erflow'd each farmer's barn and stable  And play'd a thousand pranks  A dismal sight indeed it was to see  The mad uproar of this wild anarchy  But soon the comedy was o'er  'Twas now a desolated shore  And every bed was dry  Too soon their dread mistake they found  For all the fish were run aground  Their spawn and progeny  They and their helpless families were left  To starveof Ocean's usual stores bereft  For unsupplied he must deny  His rich reciprocal supply  Whose wealth was what they gave  And since they stopt the natural source  He could make no return of course  Nor send his briny wave  To purify and cheer their gelid streams  Such is the fatal end of harsh extremes  How sweet the notes of treason sound  To faction's ear how quick are found  Smooth reasons to withdraw  Our due allegiance from the throne  We threaten while our heads are on  And set at nought the law  We curse this cess and damn that tax  But never dream of Tyburn or the axe  LABOUR IN VAIN A NEW SONG  IN pursuit of some lambs from my flocks that had stray'd  One morning I rang'd o'er the plain  But alas after all my researches were made  I perceiv'd that my labour was vain  At length growing hopeless my lambs to restore  I resolv'd to return back again  It was useless I thought to seek after them more  Since I found that my labour was vain  On this my return pretty Phebe I saw  And to love her I could not refrain  To solicit a kiss I approach'd her with awe  But she told me my labour was vain  Dear Phebe I cried to my suit lend an ear  And let me no longer complain  She replied with a frown and an aspect severe  Young Colin your labour's in vain  Then I eagerly clasp'd her quite close to my breast  And kiss'd her and kiss'd her again  O Colin she cried if you're rude I protest  That your labour shall still be in vain  At length by intreaties by kisses and vows  Compassion she took on my pain  She now has consented to make me her spouse  So no longer I labour in vain  TO A GENTLEMAN WHO DESIRED PROPER MATERIALS FOR A MONODY  FLowretswreathsthy banks

Reviving colour glow'd with broken light  The varied landscape dawn'd upon the sight  The lark's first song melodious floats on air  And Damon rises wak'd by Love and Care  Unpens the fold and o'er the glittering mead  With thoughtful steps conducts his fleecy breed  Near in rude majesty a mountain stood  Projecting far and brow'd with pendant wood  The foliage trembling as the breezes blow  Inverted trembled in a brook below  The mountain echoed every plaintive strain  The sighing breeze return'd his sighs again  The gliding brook remurmur'd to his grief  As thus from song the shepherd sought relief  " When late in rural sports I took my share  " Blithe as the blithest in the crouded fair  " What tho' from ten contending in the race  " I snatch'd the prize with yet unrivall'd pace  " What tho' in wrestling arduous to excell  " I stood the victor when each rival fell  " What tho' when Colin oft in combat crown'd  " The cudgel seiz'd and aw'd the circle round  " I boldly dar'd the champion of the green  " And from his head the trickling blood was seen  " What tho' in softer strife my rural song  " Won the loud plaudit of the listening throng  " Tho' every prize by every voice was mine  " And rival hands for me the chaplet twine  " On Robin's shoulders thro' the croud convey'd  " Of maids that blush'd and shepherds that huzza'd  " Vain all my strength activity and speed  " Vain all my skill to tune the vocal reed  " No joy the chaplet or the prize could give  " For Phillis frown'd the nymph for whom I live  " Phillis whose charms alone my wishes fir'd  " Whose charms ambition not my own inspir'd  " Who made my feet more swift my arm more strong  " My heart more dauntless and more sweet my song  " Love gave me conquest but denied me bliss  " When from her lips she wip'd the ravish'd kiss  " Cruel and coy she blasted all my pride  " And 'midst the transports of my friends I sigh'd  " Denied her love I'm poor with all the rest  " Indulg'd with that of more than all possess'd  " What giddy caprice rules a woman's mind  " As fate relentless and as fortune blind  " On vanquish'd Colin Phillis shed her smiles  " And all his sorrows and his pain beguiles  " She from the wound I gave with lenient care  " Wash'd the stiff gore and clipp'd the clotted hair  " The healing simples with soft touch applied  " Own'd and caress'd him spite of female pride  " Mourn'd his disgrace and now from future harms  " Perhaps she hides him in her circling arms  " O had kind heaven to me transferr'd his blow  " O had I own'd him a superior foe  " Fled from the general hiss with shame deprest  " To hide my blushes in her downy breast  " To him with rapture every prize I'd yield  " And all the tasteless honours of the field  " For each gay trifle with her love o'erpaid  " Blest tho' forgotten in the secret shade  " Vain wish to Colin is that bliss decreed  " Distracting thoughts distracting thoughts succeed  " May swift destruction seize the hated pair  " Or worse than swift destruction my despair  " Nomay the fruitless curse leave Phillis free  " But doubled Colin be fulfill'd in thee"  High on the neighbouring mountain's airy head  His browzing goats as happy Colin led  Pronounc'd with hasty rage he heard his name  And near the brow with still attention came  Too nearthe treacherous brink gives way and lo  He shrieks and plunges in the brook below  The sounding waters whitening as they rose  Now with subsiding murmurs round him close  Damon alarm'd his falling rival knew  And swift as lightning to his aid he flew  Prevailing virtue triumph'd in his breast  And pity love and enmity supprest  He saw him gasp emerging from the brook  And reach'd with generous haste his saving crook  Caught by the drowning wretch with both his hands  And grateful trembling on the bank he stands  Short recollection serv'd him thus to show  How much a friend he rose who fell a foe  " Born to subdue me and subdued to save  " Thine from this moment is the life you gave  " Here by the gods who sent thee to my aid  " I swear no more to see thy favourite maid  " By partial favour not by merit mine  " To thee more worthy Phillis I resign  " Go and my falshood to thy mistress plead  " Go and may heaven and love thy suit succeed  Thus soon with ardent looks with honest pride  And just disdain the kindling swain replied  ' What Damon's faithful love essay'd in vain  ' He scorns by Colin's broken vows to gain  ' Be thine the maid since fate ordains it so  ' And time and absence shall allay my woe  ' Friends from this hour forever let us live  ' My friendship's pledge this spotless ewe I give'  " And I yon kid than falling snow more white"  Glad Colin cried and mutual faith they plight  Thus busied Phillis unperceiv'd drew near  Foredoom'd her love now twice renounc'd to hear  " Take Damon" thus the blushing maid begins  " The hand the heart thy generous virtue wins  " Not Colin's broken vows but Damon's truth  " Now blends my fate with thine deserving youth  " To try thee O forgive if tried too far  " Was all I meant whate'er my actions were"  Her hand with sudden rapture Damon prest  The joyful pair consenting Colin blest  To Damon's cot they take the flowery way  With guiltless mirth to crown the happy day  SWEETWILLIAM OR VERSES OCCASIONED BY THE CHRISTENING OF MR WOOD'S SON WHO WAS NAMED SWEETWILLIAM APRIL XXVII MDCCLXIII  WIth song sweet babe we celebrate thy birth  And hail thee to the chequer'd scenes of earth  Thy smiles of innocence our hearts endear  When Spring now fairest paints the purple year  Promise of future fruit all nature blooms  Hills vales woods gardens send forth rich perfumes  Such beauty in etherial mildness reigns  We match our meadows with Idalian plains  And thee did not thine eyes our error prove  Thee we should deem a little smiling Love  SweetWilliam wellcome to the realms of day  O may'st thou bloom the sweetest flower of May  Thy lovely mother's gentle mind inherit  Thy father's honest heart and generous spirit  Yes Yes I see so strong prophetic power  An embryo genius in this rising flower  A hand that's valiant and a heart that's true  To serve his neighbours and his nation too  Thus in the acorn's little folds we see  An oak imperial in epitome  By slow degrees the leaves the boughs expand  Rise spread shade flourish and defend the land  TO THE REV MR LAYNG OCCASIONED BY HIS SERMON ON MUTUAL BENEVOLENCE PREACHED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE GOVERNORS OF THE NORTHAMPTON INFIRMARY  LET fools religion in opinion place  And call whim spleen and superstition grace  Put in mock'd Virtue's legal hand a reed  And on her throne vile idol rear a creed  While weeping Charity is doom'd to seel  The smarting scourge of unrelenting Zeal  And sainted Bigotry with impious pride  Claims all the sky and damns the world beside  O taught of heaven be thine the better part  With sacred love to touch the kindling heart  Still mild benevolence like Jesus preach  And spread the truths he liv'd and died to teach  Still build salvation on the Saviour's plan  And God's own glory on goodwill to man  So shall goodnature at thy voice refine  And what was moral shall be moredivine  Selflove shall learn to taste of social joy  And public works the miser's hands employ  Folly inform'd converted Vice shall own  That wisdom pleasure Virtue gives alone  Deists shall scorn the Christian name no more  And atheists God as love immense adore  LOVE ELEGY  WRITTEN AT COLLEGE OXFORD  THE solemn hand of sable suited night  Enwraps the silent earth with mantle drear  Thick murky clouds obscure Diana's light  Nor shines one star the dusky scene to cheer  O'er the sad mansion hid in awful gloom  The Aethiop darkness spreads her ebon sway  Save that alone from yonder studious room  The wasting taper sheds a feeble ray  Now while the tenants of this sacred dome  Turn the grave page or sink to soft repose  Along the Gothic cloisters let me roam  And deep in thought the lazy moments lose  Now breathes the whistling storm a mournful song  And pattering drops the drizzly tempest tell  Whilst Echo roves the lonely vaults among  Sadlyresponsive to the midnight bell  And hark the pensive owl with boding strain  Shrieks notes of terror from the learned grove  All horrid sounds full well ye sooth my pain  Full well your music greets despairing love  No longer now around the social bowl  I join the jocund laugh or cheerful lay  But pour in ceaseless groans my lovesick soul  'Till fades the lamp at bright Aurora's ray  How at the fragrant hour of rising morn  Would throbbing transport rush thro' every vein  To hear the swelling shout and echoing horn  Call the gay hunter to the sportive plain  But ah the sprightly joys of youth are fled  In sighs and tears my waining life I wear  So the pale lilly hangs its drooping head  When chilling hoarfrosts blast the vernal year  Philosophy thou guardian of the heart  Oh come in all thy rigid virtue drest  With manly precepts ease the killing smart  And drive this tyrant from my wounded breast  Oft would my eye disdaining balmy sleep  Thy form divine thro' every path explore  Fathom with restless toil each maxim deep  And hang incessant o'er thy awful lore  Alas oppos'd to Love how weak how frail  Are all the reasons of th' unfeeling sage  No dull advice can o'er his power prevail  Or the keen pangs his dart inflicts asswage  Yes tyrant yes thou must retain thy power  'Till my torn bosom yields to stronger death  Still must I love even in that fatal hour  And call on Delia with my latest breath  And when all pale my lifeless limbs extend  And Fate has seal'd th' irrevocable doom  May then my memory find a faithful friend  To write these numbers on my peaceful tomb  " Here rests a youth who love and sorrow's slave  " Gave up his early life to pining care  " 'Till worn with woe he sought in this calm grave  " A safe retreat from anguish and despair"  So when the stone lies o'er my claycold head  If chance fair Delia to the place drew near  With one sad sigh she may lament me dead  And bathe the senseless marble with a tear  ON THE FOLLY OF ATHEISM  HOW weak the Atheist's argument how odd  Who to be happy first denies a God  Then with too little faith truth to believe  Can show too much an error to conceive  So inconsistent and his folly such  He trusts too little while he trusts too much  A foe profess'd to God Almighty's laws  Yet a blind bigot in the Devil's cause  He from freethinking hopes to gain some light  Thinks free on every subject but the right  A hint there is a God raises a doubt  And Prejudice puts weaker Reason out  Of Reason proud by Passion rul'd alone  Because he'd have no God concludes there's none  Thinks chance with blind effect nice order brings  And harmony from wild confusion springs  Springs of itselffor all spontaneous grow  And the created are creators too  Then immortality he'll disbelieve  Yet starts to think he cannot always live  Dreading it true a future state denies  And while he laughs at death with fear he dies  Despairing launches to some future state  Repents his follybut repents too late  ADVICE TO AN AUTHOR  THou who art thirsty for a poet's name  Panting for perpetuity of fame  O tremble to increase the Muses tribe  'Till Mother Griffiths has receiv'd a bribe  If praise like hers can make thy piece go down  Th' insurance premium is but half a crown  And who can blame her for the bawd must pay  In ready cash the hirelings of a day  Else would the movement of the press stand still  And lowbred Scandal drop her venal quill  Yet sure one bard 'tis better to pursue  Thro' the black numbers of a dull Review  And maim a work without the skill to carve  Than that a whole Society should starve  GEMINI  {inverted ⁂} The Monthly Reviewers having taken upon them to assert that we plundered the poem called the Kite from the Gent Mag This is to assure the Public that assertion is false and malicious The Editors of the Poetical Calendar are possessed of three early editions of that poem the first is printed in the year the second at Oxford in and the third is in a collection of poems called the Flowerpiece printed in from which we copied it What fine criticisms may the world expect from such ignorant and malevolent writers  CONTENTS  THompson's hymn to May Page  Ode to May  Song
