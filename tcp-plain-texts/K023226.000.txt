 ADDRESS AND DECLARATION OF THE FRIEND'S OF UNIVERSAL  PEACE and LIBERTY  HELD AT THE THATCHED HOUSE TAVERN ST JAMES'S STREET August th  BY THOMAS PAINE  AUTHOR OF THE WORKS INTITLED COMMON SENSE AND THE RIGHTS OF MAN  TOGETHER WITH  SOME VERSES  By the same Author Which were printed in a PENSYLVANIAN Newspaper  Price TWO PENCE  second part of rights of man  ADDRESS AND DECLARATION  Friends and fellow Citizens  AT a moment like the present when wilful mis∣representations are industriously spread by the partizans of ar  ary power and the advocates of passive obedie  ce and CourtG  vernment we think it incumbent upon us to declare to the world our principles and the motives of our conduct  We rejoice at the glorious event of the  French Revol  tion  If it be askedWhat is the French Revolution to us  We answer as has been already answered in ano∣ther place  of the vol  teers of Be  a  t    It it much  Much to us as men Much to us as Englishmen  As men we rejoice in the freedom of twenty five millions of our fellow m  n We rejoice in the pros∣pect which such a magnificent example opens to the world We congratulate the French nation for ha∣ving laid the axe to the root of tyranny and for erecting Government on the sacred HEREDITARY Rights of MANRights which appertain to ALL and not to a yo  e more than to another We know of  o human authority superior to that of a whole nation a  d we profess and proclaim it as our prin∣ciple that every nation has at all times an inherent indefeasible right to constitute and establish such Go∣vernment for itself as best accords with its disposi∣tion interest and happiness  As Englishmen we also rejoice because we are  immediately  interested in the French Revolution  Without enquiring into the justice on either side of the reproachful charges of intrigue and ambition which the English and French Court have constant∣ly made on each other we confine ourselves to this observationThat if the Court of France only was in fault and the numerous wars which have distres∣ed both countries are chargeable to her alone that Court now exists no longer and the cause and the consequence must cease together The French therefore by the Revolution they have made have conquered for us as well as for themselves if it be true that their Court only was in fault and ours never  On this state of the case the French Revolution concerns us  immediately  We are oppressed with a heavy National debt a burthen of taxes and an expensive administration of Government beyond those of any people in the world We have also a very numerous poor and we hold that the moral obligation of providing for old age helpless infancy and poverty is far superior to that of supplying the invented wants of courtly extravagance ambition and intrigue  We believe there is no instance to be produced but in England of  seven  millions of inhabitants which make but little more than  one  million of families paying yearly SEVENTEEN MILIONS of taxes  As it has always been held out by all administra∣tions that the restless ambition of the Court of France rendered this expence necessary to us for our own defence we consequently rejoice as men deeply interested in the French Revolution for that Cour  as we have already said exists no longer and con∣sequently the same enormous expences need not continue to us  Thus rejoicing as we sincerely do both as men and Englishmen as lovers of universal peace and freedom and as friends to our own national prospe∣rity and a reduction of our public expences we cannot but express our astonishment that any part or any Members of our own Government should re∣probate the extinction of that very power in France or wish to see it restored to whose influence they formerly attributed whilst they appeared to lament the enormous increase of our own burthens and tax∣es What then Are they sorry that the pretence for new oppressive taxes and the occasion for continu∣ing many old taxes will be at an endIf so and if it is the policy of Courts and Court Government to prefer enemies to friends and a system of war to that of peace as affording more pretences for Pla∣ces Offices Pensions Revenue and Taxation it is high time for the people of every nation to look with circumspection to their own interest  Those who  pay  the expence and  not  those who  participate  in the emoluments arising from it are the persons immediately interested in enquiries of this kind We are a part of that National body on whom this annual expence of seventeen millions falls and we consider the present opportunity of the French Revolution as a most happy one for lessening the enormous load under which this nation groans If this be not done we shall then have reason to con∣clude that the cry of intrigue and ambition against  other  Courts is no more than the common cant of  all  Courts  We think it also necessary to express our astonish∣ment that a Government desirous of being called FREE should prefer connexions with the most des∣potic and arbitary powers in Europe We know of none more deserving this description than those of Turkey and Prussia and the whole combination of German despotsSeparated as we happily are by nature from the tumults of the Continent we repro∣bate all systems and intrigues which sacrifice and that too at a great expence the blessings of our natural si∣tuation Such systoms cannot have a national origin  If we are asked What Government isWe hold it to be nothing more than a NATIONAL ASSOCIATION and we hold that to be the best which secures to eve∣ry man his rights and promotes the greatest quantity of happiness with the  least expence  We live to improve or we live in vain and therefore we admit of no maxims of government or policy on the mere score of antiquity or other men's authority the  Old  Whigs or the  New  We will exercise the reason with which we are en∣dued or we possess it unworthily As reason is gi∣ven at all times it is for the purpose of being used at all times  Among the blessings which the French Revolution has produced to that nation we enumerate the abo∣lition of the feudal system of injustice and tyranny on the th of August Beneath the feudal system all Europe has long groaned and from it En∣gland is not yet free Gamelaws boroughtenures and tyrannical monopolies of numerous kinds still remain amongst us but rejoicing as we sincerely do in the freedom of others till we shall happily accom∣plish  our own we intended to commemorate this prelude to the universal extirpation of the feudal system by meeting on the anniversary of that day the th of August at the Crown and Anchor From this meeting we were prevented by the inter∣ference of certain  unnamed  and  sculking  persons with the Master of the Tavern who informed us that on  their  representations he could not receive usLet those who live by or countenance feudal oppressions take the reproach of this ineffectual meanness and cowardice to themselves They cannot stifle the pub∣lic declaration of our honest open and avowed opinions  These are our principles and these our sentiments They embrace the interest and happiness of the great body of the nation of which we are a part As to riots and tumults let those answer for them who by wilful misrepresentations endeav  ur to excite and promote them or who seek to  stun  the sense of the nation and lose the great cause of public good in the outrages of a misinformed mob We take our ground on principles that require no such riotous aid We have nothing to apprehend from the poor for we are pleading their cause And we fear not proud oppression for we have Truth on our side  We say and we repeat it that the French Revo∣lution opens to the world an opportunity in which all good citizens must rejoice that of promoting the general happiness of Man And that it more∣over offers to this country in particular an oppor∣tunity of reducing our enormous Taxes  These are our objects and we will pursue them  JOHN H  T  K  Cha  man  LINES c  By  THOMAS PAINE  THE Rain pours down the City looks forlorn  And gloomy subjects suit the howling morn  Close by my  e with door and window fast  And safely shelter'd from the driving blast  To gayer thoughts I bid a days adieu  To spend a scene of solitude with you  So oft has black Revenge engros'd the care  Of all the leisure hours man finds to spare  So oft has guilt in all her thousand dens  Call'd for the vengeance of chastising Pens  That while I fain would case my heart on you  No thought is left untold no passion new  From flight to flight the mental path appears  Worn with the steps of near six thousand years  And fill'd throughout with every scene of pain  From CAIN to G***** and back from G***** to CAIN  Alike in cruelty alike in hate  In guilt alike but more alike in fate  Both curs'd supremely for the blood they drew  Each from the rising world while each was new  Go second CAIN true likeness of the first  And strew thy blasted head with homely dust  In ashes sitin wretched sackcloth weep  And with unpitied sorrows cease t  lee  Go haunt the tombs and single out the place  Where earth itself shall suffer a disgrace  Go spell the letters on some mouldring urn  And ask if he who sleeps there can return  Go count the numbers that in silence lie  And learn by study what it is to die  For sure that heartif any heart you own  Conceits that man expires without a Groan  That he who lives receives from you a grace  Or death is nothing but a change of place  That peace is d  l  that  y from sorrow springs  And War the Royal ra  shew of things  Else wh  these scenes that wound the feeling mind  This sport of deaththis Cockpit of Mankind  Why sobs the widow in perpetual pain  Why cries the Orphan"Oh my Father's slain"  Why hangs the Sire his paralytic head  And nods with manly grief"My Son is dead"  Why drops the tears from off the sisters cheek  And sweetly tells the sorrows she would speak  Or why in lonely steps does pensive John  To all the neighbours tell "Poor masters gone"  Oh could I paint the passion I can feel  Or point a horror that would wound like steel  To thy unfeeling unrelenting mind  I'd send a torture and relieve mankind  Thou that art husband father brother all  The tender names which kindred learn to call  Yet like an image carv'd in massey stone  Th  bear'st the shape but sentiment has't none  Al  ied by dust and figure not by mind  Thou only herd'st but liv'st not with mankind  And prone to love like some outrageous ape  Thou know'st each class of beings by their shape  Since then no hopes to civilize remain  And all petitions have gone forth in vain  One prayer is left which dreads no proud reply  That  he  who made thee breath will make thee die  COMMON
