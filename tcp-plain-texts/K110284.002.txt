Saepe ego longos  Cantando puerum memini me condere soles  VIRG  IMITATION  Right well I call to mind  When yet a boy whole suns and lengthen'd days  I oft' employ'd in chanting sylvan lays  Yet while he woo'd the gentle throng  With liquid lay and melting song  The list'ning herd around him stray'd  In wanton frisk the lambkins play'd  And every Naiad ceas'd to lave  Her azure limbs amid the wave  The Graces danc'd the rosy band  Of Smiles and Loves went hand in hand  And purple Pleasures strew'd the way  With sweetest flow'rs and every ray  Of each fond Muse with rapture fir'd  To glowing thoughts his breast inspir'd  The hills rejoic'd the vallies rung  All Nature smil'd while SHENSTONE sung  VERSES by  VOL II  EDINBURG AT THE  Apollo Press  BY THE MARTINS  Anno    THE POETICAL WORKS OF WILLIAM SHENSTONE  VOL II  CONTAINING HIS ODES MORAL PIECES c c c  Ill was he skill'd to guide his wand'ring sheep  And unforeseen disaster thinn'd his fold  Yet at another's loss the swain would weep  And for his friend his very crook was sold  He lov'd the Muse she taught him to complain  He saw his tim'rous loves on her depend  He lov'd the Muse altho' she taught in vain  He lov'd the Muse for she was Virtue's friend  He wish'd for wealth for much he wish'd to give  He griev'd that virtue might not wealth obtain  Piteous of woes and hopeless to relieve  The pensive prospect sadden'd all his strain  I saw him faint I saw him sink to rest  Like one ordain'd to swell the vulgar throng  As tho' the Virtues had not warm'd his breast  As tho' the Muses not inspir'd his tongue  ELEGY III  EDINBURG AT THE  Apollo Press  BY THE MARTINS  Anno    ODES c  ODE TO HEALTH    O HEALTH capricious maid  Why dost thou shun my peaceful bow'r  Where I had hope to share thy pow'r  And bless thy lasting aid  Since thou alas art flown  It 'vails not whether Muse or Grace  With tempting smile frequent the place  I sigh for thee alone  Age not forbids thy stay  Thou yet might'st act the friendly part  Thou yet might'st raise this languid heart  Why speed so swift away  Thou scorn'st the cityair  I breathe fresh gales o'er furrow'd ground  Yet hast not thou my wishes crown'd  O false O partial Fair  I plunge into the wave  And tho' with purest hands I raise  A rural altar to thy praise  Thou wilt not deign to save  Amid my wellknown grove  Where mineral fountains vainly bear  Thy boasted name and titles fair  Why scorns thy foot to rove  Thou hear'st the sportsman's claim  Enabling him with idle noise  To drown the Muse's melting voice  And fright the tim'rous game  Is thought thy foe Adieu  Ye midnight lamps ye curious tomes  Mine eye o'er hills and vallies roams  And deals no more with you  Is it the clime you flee  Yet 'midst his unremitting snows  The poor Laponian's bosom glows  And shares bright rays from thee  There was there was a time  When tho' I scorn'd thy guardian care  Nor made a vow nor said a pray'r  I did not rue the crime  Who then more bless'd than I  When the glad schoolboy's task was done  And forth with jocund sprite I run  To freedom and to joy  How jovial then the day  What since have all my labours found  Thus climbing life to gaze around  That can thy loss repay  Wert thou alas but kind  Methinks no frown that Fortune wears  Nor lessen'd hopes nor growing cares  Could sink my cheerful mind  Whate'er my stars include  What other breasts convert to pain  My tow'ring mind should soon disdain  Should scornIngratitude  Repair this mould'ring cell  And bless'd with objects found at home  And envying none their fairer dome  How pleas'd my soul should dwell  Temperance should guard the doors  From room to room should Mem'ry stray  And ranging all in neat array  Enjoy her pleasing stores  There let them rest unknown  The types of many a pleasing scene  But to preserve them bright or clean  Is thine fair Queen alone  TO A LADY OF QUALITY FITTING UP HER LIBRARY    AH what is science what is art  Or what the pleasure these impart  Ye trophies which the learn'd pursue  Thro' endless fruitless toils adieu  What can the tedious tomes bestow  To sooth the miseries they show  What like the bliss for him decreed  Who tends his flock and tunes his reed  Say wretched Fancy thus refin'd  From all that glads the simplest hind  How rare that object which supplies  A charm for too discerning eyes  The polish'd bard of genius vain  Endures a deeper sense of pain  As each invading blast devours  The richest fruits the fairest flow'rs  Sages with irksome waste of time  The steep ascent of knowledge climb  Then from the tow'ring heights they scale  Behold Contentment rangethe vale  Yet why Asteria tell us why  We scorn the crowd when you are nigh  Why then does reason seem so fair  Why learning then deserve our care  Who can unpleas'd your shelves behold  While you so fair a proof unfold  What force the brightest genius draws  From polish'd wisdom's written laws  Where are our humbler tenets flown  What strange perfection bids us own  That Bliss with toilsome Science dwells  And happiest he who most excels  ANACREONTIC    'TWAS in a cool Aonian glade  The wanton Cupid spent with toil  Had sought refreshment from the shade  And stretch'd him on the mossy soil  A vagrant Muse drew nigh and found  The subtle traitor fast asleep  And is it thine to snore profound  She said yet leave the world to weep  But hushfrom this auspicious hour  The world I ween may rest in peace  And robb'd of darts and stript of pow'r  Thy peevish petulance decrease  Sleep on poor Child whilst I withdraw  And this thy vile artill'ry hide  When the Castalian fount she saw  And plung'd his arrows in the tide  That magic fountilljudging maid  Shall cause you soon to curse the day  You dar'd the shafts of Love invade  And gave his arms redoubled sway  For in a stream so wondrous clear  When angry Cupid searches round  Will not the radiant points appear  Will not the furtive spoils be found  Too soon they were and ev'ry dart  Dipp'd in the Muse's mystic spring  Acquir'd new force to wound the heart  And taught at once to love and sing  Then farewell ye Pierian quire  For who will now your altars throng  From love we learn to swell the lyre  And Echo asks no sweeter song  ODE Written    Urit spes animi credula mutui  HOR  IMITATION  Fond hope of a reciprocal desire  Inflames the breast  'TWAS not by Beauty's aid alone  That Love usurp'd his airy throne  His boasted pow'r display'd  'Tis kindness that secures his aim  'Tis hope that feeds the kindling flame  Which Beauty first convey'd  In Clara's eyes the lightnings view  Her lips with all the rose's hue  Have all its sweets combin'd  Yet vain the blush and faint the fire  Till lips at once and eyes conspire  To prove the charmer kind  Tho' wit might gild the tempting snare  With softest accent sweetest air  By Envy's self admir'd  If Lesbia's wit betray'd her scorn  In vain might ev'ry Grace adorn  What ev'ry Muse inspir'd  Thus airy Strephon tun'd his lyre  He scorn'd the pangs of wild desire  Which lovesick swains endure  Resolv'd to brave the keenest dart  Since frowns could never wound his heart  And smilesmust ever cure  But ah how false these maxims prove  How frail security from love  Experience hourly shows  Love can imagin'd smiles supply  On ev'ry charming lip and eye  Eternal sweets bestows  In vain we trust the fair one's eyes  In vain the sage explores the skies  To learn from stars his fate  Till led by fancy wide astray  He finds no planet mark his way  Convinc'd and wisetoo late  As partial to their words we prove  Then boldly join the lists of love  With tow'ring hopes supply'd  So heroes taught by doubtful shrines  Mistook their deity's designs  Then took the fieldand dy'd  UPON A VISIT TO A LADY OF QUALITY In winter    ON fair Asteria's blissful plains  Where everblooming Fancy reigns  How pleas'd we pass the winter's day  And charm the dulley'd Spleen away  No linnet from the leafless bough  Pours forth her note melodious now  But all admire Asteria's tongue  Nor wish the linnet's vernal song  No flow'rs emit their transient rays  Yet sure Asteria's wit displays  More various tints more glowing lines  And with perennial beauty shines  Tho' rifled groves and fetter'd streams  But ill befriend a poet's dreams  Asteria's presence wakes the lyre  And well supplies poetic fire  The fields have lost their lovely dye  No cheerful azure decks the sky  Yet still we bless the louring day  Asteria smilesand all is gay  Hence let the Muse no more presume  To blame the winter's dreary gloom  Accuse his loit'ring hours no more  But ah their envious haste deplore  For soon from Wit and Friendship's reign  The social hearth the sprightly vein  I goto meet the coming year  On savage plains and deserts drear  I goto feed on pleasures flown  Nor find the spring my loss atone  But 'mid the flow'ry sweets of May  With pride recall this winter's day  ODE TO MEMORY    O MEMORY celestial maid  Who glean'st the flow'rets cropt by time  And suffering not a leaf to fade  Preserv'st the blossoms of our prime  Bring bring those moments to my mind  When life was new and Lesbia kind  And bring that garland to my sight  With which my favour'd crook she bound  And bring that wreath of roses bright  Which then my festive temples crown'd  And to my raptur'd ear convey  The gentle things she deign'd to say  And sketch with care the Muse's bow'r  Where Isis rolls her silver tide  Nor yet omit one reed or flow'r  That shines on Cherwell's verdant side  If so thou may'st those hours prolong  When polish'd Lycon join'd my song  The song it 'vails not to recite  But sure to sooth our youthful dreams  Those banks and streams appear'd more bright  Than other banks than other streams  Or by thy soft'ning pencil shown  Assume they beauties not their own  And paint that sweetlyvacant scene  When all beneath the poplar bough  My spirits light my soul serene  I breath'd in verse one cordial vow  That nothing should my soul inspire  But friendship warm and love entire  Dull to the sense of new delight  On thee the drooping Muse attends  As some fond lover robb'd of sight  On thy expressive pow'r depends  Nor would exchange thy glowing lines  To live the lord of all that shines  But let me chase those vows away  Which at Ambition's shrine I made  Nor ever let thy skill display  Those anxious moments ill repaid  Oh from my breast that season rase  And bring my childhood in its place  Bring me the bells the rattle bring  And bring the hobby I bestrode  When pleas'd in many a sportive ring  Around the room I jovial rode  Ev'n let me bid my lyre adieu  And bring the whistle that I blew  Then will I muse and pensive say  Why did not these enjoyments last  How sweetly wasted I the day  While innocence allow'd to waste  Ambition's toils alike are vain  But ah for pleasure yield us pain  VERSES Written towards the close of the year    TO WILLIAM LYTTLETON ESQ  HOW blithly pass'd the summer's day  How bright was ev'ry flow'r  While friends arriv'd in circles gay  To visit Damon's bow'r  But now with silent step I range  Along some lonely shore  And Damon's bow'r alas the change  Is gay with friends no more  Away to crowds and cities borne  In quest of joy they steer  Whilst I alas am left forlorn  To weep the parting year  O pensive Autumn how I grieve  Thy sorrowing face to see  When languid suns are taking leave  Of ev'ry drooping tree  Ah let me not with heavy eye  This dying scene survey  Haste Winter haste usurp the sky  Complete my bow'r's decay  Ill can I bear the motley cast  Yon' sick'ning leaves retain  That speak at once of pleasure past  And bode approaching pain  At home unbless'd I gaze around  My distant scenes require  Where all in murky vapours drown'd  Are hamlet hill and spire  Tho' Thomson sweet descriptive bard  Inspiring Autumn sung  Yet how should we the months regard  That stopp'd his flowing tongue  Ah luckless months of all the rest  To whose hard share it fell  For sure he was the gentlest breast  That ever sung so well  And see the swallows now disown  The roofs they lov'd before  Each like his tuneful genius flown  To glad some happier shore  The woodnymph eyes with pale affright  The sportsman's frantic deed  While hounds and horns and yells unite  To drown the Muse's reed  Ye Fields with blighted herbage brown  Ye Skies no longer blue  Too much we feel from Fortune's frown  To bear these frowns from you  Where is the mead's unsully'd green  The zephyr's balmy gale  And where sweet Friendship's cordial mien  That brighten'd ev'ry vale  What tho' the vine disclose her dyes  And boast her purple store  Not all the vineyard's rich supplies  Can sooth our sorrows more  He he is gone whose moral strain  Could wit and mirth refine  He he is gone whose social vein  Surpass'd the pow'r of wine  Fast by the streams he deign'd to praise  In yon' sequester'd grove  To him a votive urn I raise  To him and friendly Love  Yes there my Friend forlorn and sad  I grave your Thomson's name  And there his lyre which Fate forbade  To sound your growing fame  There shall my plaintive song recount  Dark themes of hopeless woe  And faster than the dropping fount  I'll teach mine eyes to flow  There leaves in spite of Autumn green  Shall shade the hallow'd ground  And Spring will there again be seen  To call forth flow'rs around  But no kind suns will bid me share  Once more his social hour  Ah Spring thou never canst repair  This loss to Damon's bow'r  AN IRREGULAR ODE After sickness    Melius cum venerit ipsa canemus  IMITATION  His wish'dfor presence will improve the song  TOO long a stranger to repose  At length from Pain's abhorred couch I rose  And wander'd forth alone  To court once more the balmy breeze  And catch the verdure of the trees  Ere yet their charms were flown  'Twas from a bank with pansies gay  I hail'd once more the cheerful day  The sun's forgotten beams  O Sun how pleasing were thy rays  Reflected from the polish'd face  Of yon' refulgent streams  Rais'd by the scene my feeble tongue  Essay'd again the sweets of song  And thus in feeble strains and slow  The loit'ring numbers 'gan to flow  " Come gentle Air my languid limbs restore  " And bid me welcome from the Stygian shore  " For sure I heard the tender sighs  " I seem'd to join the plaintive cries  " Of hapless youths who thro' the myrtle grove  " Bewail for ever their unfinish'd love  " To that unjoyous clime  " Torn from the sight of these ethereal skies  " Debarr'd the lustre of their Delia's eyes  " And banish'd in their prime  " Come gentle Air and while the thickets bloom  " Convey the jasmine's breath divine  " Convey the woodbine's rich perfume  " Nor spare the sweetleaf'd eglantine  " And may'st thou shun the rugged storm  " Till Health her wonted charms explain  " With Rural Pleasure in her train  " To greet me in her fairest form  " While from this lofty mount I view  " The sons of Earth the vulgar crew  " Anxious for futile gains beneath me stray  " And seek with erring step Contentment's obvious way  " Come gentle Air and thou celestial Muse  " Thy genial flame infuse  " Enough to lend a pensive bosom aid  " And gild Retirement's gloomy shade  " Enough to rear such rustic lays  " As foes may slight but partial friends will praise"  The gentle Air allow'd my claim  And more to cheer my drooping frame  She mix'd the balm of op'ning flowers  Such as the bee with chymic powers  From Hybla's fragrant hills inhales  Or scents Sabea's blooming vales  But ah the nymphs that heal the pensive mind  By prescripts more refin'd  Neglect their vot'ry's anxious moan  Oh how should they relievethe Muses all were flown  By flow'ry plain or woodland shades  I fondly sought the charming maids  By woodland shades or flow'ry plain  I sought them faithless maids in vain  When lo in happier hour  I leave behind my native mead  To range where Zeal and Friendship lead  To visit L****'s honour'd bower  Ah foolish man to seek the tuneful maids  On other plains or near less verdant shades  Scarce have my footsteps press'd the favour'd ground  When sounds ethereal strike my ear  At once celestial forms appear  My fugitives are found  The Muses here attune their lyres  Ah partial with unwonted fires  Here hand in hand with careless mien  The sportive Graces trip the green  But whilst I wander'd o'er a scene so fair  Too well at one survey I trace  How ev'ry Muse and ev'ry Grace  Had long employ'd their care  Lurks not a stone enrich'd with lively stain  Blooms not a flower amid the vernal store  Falls not a plume on India's distant plain  Glows not a shell on Adria's rocky shore  But torn methought from native lands or seas  From their arrangement gain fresh pow'r to please  And some had bent the wild'ring maze  Bedeck'd with ev'ry shrub that blows  And some entwin'd the willing sprays  To shield th' illustrious dame's repose  Others had grac'd the sprightly dome  And taught the portrait where to glow  Others arrang'd the curious tome  Or 'mid the decorated space  Assign'd the laurell'd bust a place  And given to learning all the pomp of show  And now from ev'ry task withdrawn  They met and frisk'd it o'er the lawn  Ah woe is me said I  And ***'s hilly circuit heard my cry  Have I for this with labour strove  And lavish'd all my little store  To fence for you my shady grove  And scollop ev'ry winding shore  And fringe with ev'ry purple rose  The sapphire stream that down my valley flows  Ah lovely treach'rous maids  To quit unseen my votive shades  When pale Disease and tort'ring Pain  Had torn me from the breezy plain  And to a restless couch confin'd  Who ne'er your wonted tasks declin'd  She needs not your officious aid  To swell the song or plan the shade  By genuine Fancy fir'd  Her native genius guides her hand  And while she marks the sage command  More lovely scenes her skill shall raise  Her lyre resound with nobler rays  Than ever you inspir'd  Thus I my rage and grief display  But vainly blame and vainly mourn  Nor will a Grace or Muse return  Till Luxborough lead the way  RURAL ELEGANCE AN ODE TO THE LATE DUCHESS OF SOMERSET Written    WHILE orient skies restore the day  And dewdrops catch the lucid ray  Amid the sprightly scenes of morn  Will aught the Muse inspire  Oh peace to yonder clam'rous horn  That drowns the sacred lyre  Ye rural Thanes that o'er the mossy down  Some panting tim'rous hare pursue  Does Nature mean your joys alone to crown  Say does she smooth her lawns for you  For you does Echo bid the rocks reply  And urg'd by rude constraint resound the jovial cry  See from the neighb'ring hill forlorn  The wretched swain your sport survey  He finds his faithful fences torn  He finds his labour'd crops a prey  He sees his flockno more in circles feed  Haply beneath your ravage bleed  And with no random curses lwads the deed  Nor yet ye Swains conclude  That Nature smiles for you alone  Your bounded souls and your conceptions crude  The proud the selfish boast disown  Yours be the produce of the soil  O may it still reward your toil  Nor ever the defenceless train  Of clinging infants ask support in vain  But tho' the various harvest gild your plains  Does the mere landscape feast your eye  Or the warm hope of distant gains  Far other cause of glee supply  Is not the redstreak's future juice  The source of your delight profound  Where Ariconium pours her gems profuse  Purpling a whole horizon round  Athirst ye praise the limpid stream 'tis true  But tho' the pebbled shores among  It mimic no unpleasing song  The limpid fountain murmurs not for you  Unpleas'd ye see the thickets bloom  Unpleas'd the Spring her flow'ry robe resume  Unmov'd the mountain's airy pile  The dappled mead without a smile  O let a rural conscious Muse  For well she knows your froward sense accuse  Forth to the solemn oak you bring the square  And span the massy trunk before you cry 'Tis fair  Nor yet ye Learn'd nor yet ye Courtly Train  If haply from your haunts ye stray  To waste with us a summer's day  Exclude the taste of ev'ry swain  Nor our untutor'd sense disdain  'Tis Nature only gives exclusive right  To relish her supreme delight  She where she pleases kind or coy  Who furnishes the scene and forms us to enjoy  Then hither bring the fair ingenuous mind  By her auspicious aid refin'd  Lo not an hedgerow hawthorn blows  Or humble harebell paints the plain  Or valley winds or fountain flows  Or purple heath is ting'd in vain  For such the rivers dash the foaming tides  The mountain swells the dale subsides  Ev'n thriftless furze detains their wand'ring sight  And the rough barren rock grows pregnant with delight  With what suspicious fearful care  The sordid wretch secures his claim  If haply some luxurious heir  Should alienate the fields that wear his name  What scruples lest some future birth  Should litigate a span of earth  Bonds contracts feoffments names unmeet for prose  The tow'ring Muse endures not to disclose  Alas her unrevers'd decree  More comprehensive and more free  Her lavish charter taste appropriates all we see  Let gondolas their painted flags unfold  And be the solemn day enroll'd  When to confirm his lofty plea  In nuptial sort with bridal gold  The grave Venetian weds the sea  Each laughing Muse derides the vow  Ev'n Adria scorns the mock embrace  To some lone hermit on the mountain's brow  Allotted from his natal hour  With all her myrtle shores in dow'r  His breast to admiration prone  Enjoys the smile upon her face  Enjoys triumphant ev'ry grace  And finds her more his own  Fatigu'd with Form's oppressive laws  When Somerset avoids the great  When cloy'd with merited applause  She seeks the rural calm retreat  Does she not praise each mossy cell  And feel the truth my numbers tell  When deafen'd by the loud acclaim  Which genius grac'd with rank obtains  Could she not more delighted hear  Yon' throstle chant the rising year  Could she not spurn the wreaths of fame  To crop the primrose of the plains  Does she not sweets in each fair valley find  Lost to the sons of Pow'r unknown to half mankind  Ah can she covet there to see  The splendid slaves the reptile race  That oil the tongue and bow the knee  That slight her merit but adore her place  Far happier if aright I deem  When from gay throngs and gilded spires  To where the lonely halcyons play  Her philosophic step retires  While studious of the moral theme  She to some smooth sequester'd stream  Likens the swains' inglorious day  Pleas'd from the flow'ry margin to survey  How cool serene and clear the current glides away  O blind to truth to virtue blind  Who slight the sweetly pensive mind  On whose fair birth the Graces mild  And ev'ry Muse prophetic smil'd  Not that the poet's boasted fire  Should Fame's wideechoing trumpet swell  Or on the music of his lyre  Each future age with rapture dwell  The vaunted sweets of praise remove  Yet shall such bosoms claim a part  In all that glads the human heart  Yet these the spirits form'd to judge and prove  All Nature's charms immense and Heav'n's unbounded love  And oh the transport most ally'd to song  In some fair villa's peaceful bound  To catch soft hints from Nature's tongue  And bid Arcadia bloom around  Whether we fringe the sloping hill  Or smooth below the verdant mead  Whether we break the falling rill  Or thro' meand'ring mazes lead  Or in the horrid bramble's room  Bid careless groups of roses bloom  Or let some shelter'd lake serene  Reflect flow'rs woods and spires and brighten all the scene  O sweet disposal of the rural hour  O beauties never known to cloy  While Worth and Genius haunt the favour'd bow'r  And ev'ry gentle breast partakes the joy  While Charity at eve surveys the swain  Enabled by these toils to cheer  A train of helpless infants dear  Speed whistling home across the plain  See vagrant Luxury her handmaid grown  For half her graceless deeds atone  And hails the bounteous work and ranks it with her own  Why brand these pleasures with the name  Of soft unsocial toils of indolence and shame  Search but the garden or the wood  Let yon' admir'd carnation own  Not all was meant for raiment or for food  Not all for needful use alone  There while the seeds of future blossoms dwell  'Tis colour'd for the sight perfum'd to please the smell  Why knows the nightingale to sing  Why flows the pine's nectareous juice  Why shines with paint the linnet's wing  For sustenance alone for use  For preservation Ev'ry sphere  Shall bid fair Pleasure's rightful claim appear  And sure there seem of human kind  Some born to shun the solemn strife  Some for amusive tasks design'd  To sooth the certain ills of life  Grace its lone vales with many a budding rose  New founts of bliss disclose  Call forth refreshing shades and decorate repose  From plains and woodlands from the view  Of rural Nature's blooming face  Smit with the glare of rank and place  To courts the sons of Fancy flew  There long had Art ordain'd a rival seat  There had she lavish'd all her care  To form a scene more dazzling fair  And call'd them from their green retreat  To share her proud control  Had given the robe with grace to flow  Had taught exotic gems to glow  And emulous of Nature's pow'r  Mimic'd the plume the leaf the flow'r  Chang'd the complexion's native hue  Moulded each rustic limb anew  And warp'd the very soul  A while her magic strikes the novel eye  A while the fairy forms delight  And now aloof we seem to fly  On purple pinions thro' a purer sky  Where all is wondrous all is bright  Now landed on some spangled shore  A while each dazzled maniac roves  By sapphire lakes thro' em'rald groves  Paternal acres please no more  Adieu the simple the sincere delight  Th' habitual scene of hill and dale  The rural herds the vernal gale  The tangled vetch's purple bloom  The fragrance of the bean's perfume  Be theirs alone who cultivate the soil  And drink the cup of thirst and eat the bread of toil  But soon the pageant fades away  'Tis Nature only bears perpetual sway  We pierce the counterfeit delight  Fatigu'd with splendour's irksome beams  Fancy again demands the sight  Of native groves and wonted streams  Pants for the scenes that charm'd her youthful eyes  Where Truth maintains her court and banishes Disguise  Then hither oft' ye Senators retire  With Nature here high converse hold  For who like Stamford her delights admire  Like Stamford shall with scorn behold  Th' unequal bribes of pageantry and gold  Beneath the British oak's majestic shade  Shall see fair Truth immortal maid  Friendship in artless guise array'd  Honour and moral beauty shine  With more attractive charms with radiance more divine  Yes here alone did highest Heav'n ordain  The lasting magazine of charms  Whatever wins whatever warms  Whatever fancy seeks to share  The great the various and the fair  For ever should remain  Her impulse nothing may restrain  Or whence the joy 'mid columns tow'rs  'Midst all the city's artful trim  To rear some breathless vapid flow'rs  Or shrubs fuliginously grim  From rooms of silken foliage vain  To trace the dun far distant grove  Where smit with undissembled pain  The woodlark mourns her absent love  Borne to the dusty town from native air  To mimic rural life and sooth some vapour'd fair  But how must faithless Art prevail  Should all who taste our joy sincere  To virtue truth or science dear  Forego a court's alluring pale  For dimpled brook and leafy grove  For that rich luxury of thought they love  Ah no from these the public sphere requires  Example for its giddy bands  From these impartial Heav'n demands  To spread the flame itself inspires  To sift Opinion's mingled mass  Impress a nation's taste and bid the sterling pass  Happy thrice happy they  Whose graceful deeds have exemplary shone  Round the gay precincts of a throne  With mild effective beams  Who bands of fair ideas bring  By solemn grot or shady spring  To join their pleasing dreams  Theirs is the rural bliss without alloy  They only that deserve enjoy  What tho' nor fabled Dryad haunt their grove  Nor Naiad near their fountains rove  Yet all embody'd to the mental sight  A train of smiling Virtues bright  Shall there the wise retreat allow  Shall twine triumphant palms to deck the wand'rer's brow  And tho' by faithless friends alarm'd  Art have with Nature wag'd presumptuous war  By Seymour's winning influence charm'd  In whom their gifts united shine  No longer shall their councils jar  'Tis her's to mediate the peace  Near Percylodge with awestruck mien  The rebel seeks her lawful queen  And havoc and contention cease  I see the rival pow'rs combine  And aid each other's fair design  Nature exalt the mound where Art shall build  Art shape the gay alcove while Nature paints the field  Begin ye Songsters of the grove  O warble forth your noblest lay  Where Somerset vouchsafes to rove  Ye Lev'rets freely sport and play  Peace to the strepent horn  Let no harsh dissonance disturb the Morn  No sounds inelegant and rude  Her sacred solitudes profane  Unless her candour not exclude  The lowly shepherd's votive strain  Who tunes his reed amidst his rural cheer  Fearful yet not averse that Somerset should hear  ODE TO INDOLENCE    AH why for ever on the wing  Persists my weary'd soul to roam  Why ever cheated strives to bring  Or pleasure or contentment home  Thus the poor bird that draws his name  From Paradise's honour'd groves  Careless fatigues his little frame  Nor finds the resting place he loves  Lo on the rural mossy bed  My limbs with careless ease reclin'd  Ah gentle Sloth indulgent spread  The same soft bandage o'er my mind  For why should ling'ring thought invade  Yet ev'ry worldly prospect cloy  Lend me soft Sloth thy friendly aid  And give me peace debarr'd of joy  Lov'st thou yon' calm and silent flood  That never ebbs that never flows  Protected by the circling wood  From each tempestuous wind that blows  An altar on its bank shall rise  Where oft' thy vot'ry shall be sound  What time pale Autumn lulls the skies  And sick'ning verdure fades around  Ye busy Race ye factious Train  That haunt Ambition's guilty shrine  No more perplex the world in vain  But offer here your vows with mine  And thou puissant Queen be kind  If e'er I shar'd thy balmy pow'r  If e'er I sway'd my active mind  To weave for thee the rural bow'r  Dissolve in sleep each anxious care  Each unavailing sigh remove  And only let me wake to share  The sweets of friendship and of love  ODE TO A YOUNG LADY Somewhat too solicitous about her manner of expression  SURVEY my Fair that lucid stream  Adown the smiling valley stray  Would Art attempt or Fancy dream  To regulate its winding way  So pleas'd I view thy shining hair  In loose dishevell'd ringlets flow  Not all

meads resign their flow'rs  Let Art and Friendship's joint essay  Diffuse their flow'rets in her way  Not Nature can herself prepare  A worthy wreath for Lesbia's hair  Whose temper like her forehead smooth  Whose thoughts and accents form'd to sooth  Whose pleasing mien and make refin'd  Whose artless breast and polish'd mind  From all the nymphs of plain or grove  Deserv'd and won my Plymouth's love  THE DYING KID  Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi  Prima fugit  VIRG  IMITATION  Ah wretched mortals weour brightest days  On fleetest pinion fly  A TEAR bedews my Delia's eye  To think yon' playful Kid must die  From crystal spring and flow'ry mead  Must in his prime of life recede  Erewhile in sportive circles round  She saw him wheel and frisk and bound  From rock to rock pursue his way  And on the fearful margin play  Pleas'd on his various freaks to dwell  She saw him climb my rustic cell  Thence eye my lawns with verdure bright  And seem all ravish'd at the sight  She tells with what delight he stood  To trace his features in the flood  Then skipp'd aloof with quaint amaze  And then drew near again to gaze  She tells me how with eager speed  He flew to hear my vocal reed  And how with critic face profound  And stedfast ear devour'd the found  His ev'ry frolic light as air  Deserves the gentle Delia's care  And tears bedew her tender eye  To think the playful Kid must die  But knows my Delia timely wise  How soon this blameless era flies  While violence and craft succeed  Unfair design and ruthless deed  Soon would the vine his wounds deplore  And yield her purple gifts no more  Ah soon eras'd from ev'ry grove  Were Delia's name and Strephon's love  No more those bow'rs might Strephon see  Where first he fondly gaz'd on thee  No more those beds of flow'rets find  Which for thy charming brows he twin'd  Each wayward passion soon would tear  His bosom now so void of care  And when they left his ebbing vein  What but insipid age remain  Then mourn not the decrees of Fate  That gave his life so short a date  And I will join my tend'rest sighs  To think that youth so swiftly flies  ODE  SO dear my Lucio is to me  So well our minds and tempers blend  That seasons may for ever flee  And ne'er divide me from my friend  But let the favour'd boy forbear  To tempt with love my only fair  O Lycon born when ev'ry Muse  When ev'ry Grace benignant smil'd  With all a parent's breast could chuse  To bless her lov'd her only child  'Tis thine so richly grac'd to prove  More noble cares than cares of love  Together we from early youth  Have trod the flow'ry tracks of time  Together mus'd in search of truth  O'er learned sage or bard sublime  And well thy cultur'd breast I know  What wondrous treasure it can show  Come then resume thy charming lyre  And sing some patriot's worth sublime  Whilst I in fields of soft desire  Consume my fair and fruitless prime  Whose reed aspires but to display  The flame that burns me night and day  O come the Dryads of the woods  Shall daily sooth thy studious mind  The blueey'd nymphs of yonder floods  Shall meet and court thee to be kind  And Fame sits list'ning for thy lays  To swell her trump with Lucio's praise  Like me the plover fondly tries  To lure the sportsman from her nest  And flutt'ring on with anxious cries  Too plainly shews her tortur'd breast  O let him conscious of her care  Pity her pains and learn to spare  ODE To be performed by Dr Brettle and a chorus of Hales Owen citizens The instrumental part a Viol d'Amour  AIR BY THE DOCTOR  AWAKE I say awake good people  And be for once alive and gay  Come let's be merry stir the tipple  How can you sleep  Whilst I do play How can you sleep  c  CHORUS OF CITIZENS  Pardon O pardon great Musician  On drowsy souls some

ambitious thought resigning  Foe to riches pomp and sway  While the nymphs and swains delighted  Tripp'd around in all their pride  Envying joys by others slighted  Thus the royal maiden cry'd  " Bred on plains or born in vallies  " Who would bid those scenes adieu  " Stranger to the arts of malice  " Who would ever courts pursue  " Malice never taught to treasure  " Censure never taught to bear  " Love is all the shepherd's pleasure  " Love is all the damsel's care  " How can they of humble station  " Vainly blame the powers above  " Or accuse the dispensation  " Which allows them all to love  " Love like air is widely giv'n  " Pow'r nor Chance can these restrain  " Truest noblest gifts of Heav'n  " Only purest on the plain  " Peers can no such charms discover  " All in stars and garters drest  " As on Sundays does the lover  " With his nosegay on his breast  " Pinks and roses in profusion  " Said to fade when Chloe's near  " Fops may use the same allusion  " But the shepherd is sincere  " Hark to yonder milkmaid singing  " Cheerly o'er the brimming pail  " Cowslips all around her springing  " Sweetly paint the golden vale  " Never yet did courtly maiden  " Move so sprightly look so fair  " Never breast with jewels laden  " Pour a song so void of care  " Would indulgent Heav'n had granted  " Me some rural damsel's part  " All the empire I had wanted  " Then had been my shepherd's heart  " Then with him o'er hills and mountains  " Free from fetters might I rove  " Fearless taste the crystal fountains  " Peaceful sleep beneath the grove  " Rustics had been more forgiving  " Partial to my virgin bloom  " None had envy'd me when living  " None had triumph'd o'er my tomb"  NANCY OF THE VALE A BALLAD  Nerine Galatea thymo mihi dulcior Hyblae  Candidior cygnis hedera formosior alba  IMITATION  O Galatea Nereus' blooming child  More sweet than thyme by Hybla  Hyblaa mountain in Sicily famous for producing the finest honey  bees exhal'd  Fairer than swans more beauteous to behold  Than ivy's purest white  THE western sky was purpled o'er  With ev'ry pleasing ray  And flocks reviving felt no more  The sultry heats of day  When from an hazel's artless bower  Soft warbled Strephon's tongue  He bless'd the scene he bless'd the hour  While Nancy's praise he sung  " Let fops with fickle falsehood range  " The paths of wanton love  " While weeping maids lament their change  " And sadden ev'ry grove  " But endless blessings crown the day  " I saw fair Esham's dale  " And ev'ry blessing find its way  " To Nancy of the Vale  " 'Twas from Avona's banks the maid  " Diffus'd her lovely beams  " And ev'ry shining glance display'd  " The Naiad of the streams  " Soft as the wildduck's tender young  " That flote on Avon's tide  " Bright as the waterlily sprung  " And glitt'ring near its side  " Fresh as the bord'ring flowers her bloom  " Her eye all mild to view  " The little halcyon's azure plume  " Was never half so blue  " Her shape was like the reed so sleek  " So taper straight and fair  " Her dimpled smile her blushing cheek  " How charming sweet they were  " Far in the winding Vale retir'd  " This peerless bud I found  " And shadowing rocks and woods conspir'd  " To fence her beauties round  " That Nature in so lone a dell  " Should form a nymph so sweet  " Or Fortune to her secret cell  " Conduct my wand'ring feet  " Gay lordlings sought her for their bride  " But she would ne'er incline"  " Prove to your equals true" she cry'd  " As I will prove to mine  " 'Tis Strephon on the mountain's brow  " Has won my right good will  " To him I gave my plighted vow  " With him I'll climb the hill"  " Struck with her charms and gentle truth  " I clasp'd the constant fair  " To her alone I gave my youth  " And vow my future care  " And when this vow shall faithless prove  " Or I those charms forego  " The stream that saw our tender love  " That stream shall cease to flow  THE RAPE OF THE TRAP A BALLAD    'TWAS in a land of learning  The Muses' fav'rite city  Such pranks of late  Were play'd by a rat  Astempt one to be witty  All in a college study  Where books were in great plenty  This rat would devour  More sense in an hour  Than I could writein twenty  Corporeal food 'tis granted  Serves vermine less refin'd Sir  But this a rat of taste  All other rats surpass'd  And he prey'd on the food of the mind Sir  His breakfast half the morning  He constantly attended  And when the bell rung  For ev'ning song  His dinner scarce was ended  He spar'd not ev'n heroics  On which we poets pride us  And would make no more  Of King Arthurs  By Blackmore  by the score  Thanall the world beside does  In books of geography  He made the maps to flutter  A river or a sea  Was to him a dish of tea  And a kingdom bread and butter  But if some mawkish potion  Might chance to overdose him  To check its rage  He took a page  Of logicto compose him  A Trap in haste and anger  Was bought you need not doubt on't  And such was the gin  Were a lion once got in  He could not I think get out on't  With cheese not books 'twas bated  The factI'll not belie it  Since noneI tell you that  Whether scholar or rat  Minds books when he has other diet  But more of Trap and bait Sir  Why should I sing or either  Since the rat who knew the sleight  Came in the dead of night  And dragg'd 'em away together  Both Trap and bait were vanish'd  Thro' a fracture in the flooring  Which tho' so trim  It now may seem  Had thena dozen or more in  Then answer this ye Sages  Nor deem I mean to wrong ye  Had the rat which thus did seize on  The Trap less claim to reason  Than many a scull among ye  Dan Prior's Mice I own it  Were vermine of condition  But this rat who merely learn'd  What rats alone concern'd  Was the greater politician  That England's topsyturvy  Is clear from these mishaps Sir  Since Traps we may determine  Will no longer take our vermine  But vermine  Written at the time of the Spanish depredations  take our Traps Sir  Let sophs by rats infested  Then trust in cats to catch 'em  Lest they grow as learn'd as we  In our studies where d'ye see  No mortal sits to watch 'em  Good luck betide our captains  Good luck betide our cats Sir  And grant that the one  May quell the Spanish Don  And the other destroy our rats Sir  JEMMY DAWSON A BALLAD Written about the time of his execution in the year    COME listen to my mournful tale  Ye tender hearts and lovers dear  Nor will you scorn to heave a sigh  Nor need you blush to shed a tear  And thou dear Kitty peerless maid  Do thou a pensive ear incline  For thou canst weep at ev'ry woe  And pity ev'ry plaintbut mine  Young Dawson was a gallant boy  A brighter never trod the plain  And well he lov'd one charming maid  And dearly was he lov'd again  One tender maid she lov'd him dear  Of gentle blood the damsel came  And faultless was her beauteous form  And spotless was her virgin fame  But curse on party's hateful strife  That led the favour'd youth astray  The day the rebel clans appear'd  O had he never seen that day  Their colours and their sash he wore  And in the fatal dress was found  And now he must that death endure  Which gives the brave the keenest wound  How pale was then his truelove's cheek  When Jemmy's sentence reach'd her ear  For never yet did Alpine snows  So pale or yet so chill appear  With falt'ring voice she weeping said  " O Dawson monarch of my heart  " Think not thy death shall end our loves  " For thou and I will never part  " Yet might sweet mercy find a place  " And bring relief to Jemmy's woes  " O George without a pray'r for thee  " My orisons should never close  " The gracious prince that gave him life  " Would crown a neverdying flame  " And ev'ry tender babe I bore  " Should learn to lisp the giver's name  " But tho' he should be dragg'd in scorn  " To yonder ignominious tree  " He shall not want one constant friend  " To share the cruel Fates' decree"  O then her mourning coach was call'd  The sledge mov'd slowly on before  Tho' borne in a triumphal car  She had not lov'd her fav'rite more  She follow'd him prepar'd to view  The terrible behests of law  And the last scene of Jemmy's woes  With calm and stedfast eye she saw  Distorted was that blooming face  Which she had fondly lov'd so long  And stifled was that tuneful breath  Which in her praise had sweetly sung  And sever'd was that beauteous neck  Round which her arms had fondly clos'd  And mangled was that beauteous breast  On which her lovesick head repos'd  And ravish'd was that constant heart  She did to ev'ry heart prefer  For tho' it could its king forget  'Twas true and loyal still to her  Amid those unrelenting flames  She bore this constant heart to see  But when 'twas moulder'd into dust  " Yet yet" she cry'd "I follow thee  " My death my death alone can shew  " The pure the lasting love I bore  " Accept O Heav'n of woes like ours  " And let us let us weep no more"  The dismal scene was o'er and past  The lover's mournful herse retir'd  The maid drew back her languid head  And sighing forth his name expir'd  Tho' justice ever must prevail  The tear my Kitty sheds is due  For seldom shall she hear a tale  So sad so tender yet so true  A BALLAD  Trahit sua quemque voluptas  HOR  PROVERBIALIZ'D  Every one to his liking  FROM Lincoln to London rode forth our young squire  To bring down a wife whom the swains might admire  But in spite of whatever the mortal could say  The goddess objected the length of the way  To give up the op'ra the Park and the ball  For to view the stag's horns in an old country hall  To have neither China nor India to see  Nor a laceman to plague in a morningnot she  To forsake the dear playhouse Quin Garrick and Clive  Who by dint of mere humour had kept her alive  To forego the full box for his lonesome abode  O Heav'ns she should faint she should die on the road  To forget the gay fashions and gestures of France  And to leave dear Auguste in the midst of the dance  And Harlequin too'twas in vain to require it  And she wonder'd how folks had the face to desireit  She might yield to resign the sweet singers of Ruckholt  Where the citizen matron seduces her cuckold  But Ranelagh soon would her footsteps recall  And the music the lamps and the glare of Vauxhall  To be sure she could breathe no where else than in Town  Thus she talk'd like a wit and he look'd like a clown  But the while honest Harry despair'd to succeed  A coach with a coronet trail'd her to Tweed  SONG  The following Songs were written chiefly between the year    and      I TOLD my nymph I told her true  My fields were small my flocks were few  While falt'ring accents spoke my fear  That Flavia might not prove sincere  Of crops destroy'd by vernal cold  And vagrant sheep that left my fold  Of these she heard yet bore to hear  And is not Flavia then sincere  How chang'd by Fortune's fickle wind  The friends I lov'd became unkind  She heard and shed a gen'rous tear  And is not Flavia then sincere  How if she deign'd my love to bless  My Flavia must not hope for dress  This too she heard and smil'd to hear  And Flavia sure must be sincere  Go shear your flocks ye jovial Swains  Go reap the plenty of your plains  Despoil'd of all which you revere  I know my Flavia's love sincere  SONG THE LANDSCAPE  HOW pleas'd within my native bow'rs  Erewhile I pass'd the day  Was ever scene so deck'd with flow'rs  Were ever flow'rs so gay  How sweetly smil'd the hill the vale  And all the Landscape round  The river gliding down the dale  The hill with beeches crown'd  But now when urg'd by tender woes  I speed to meet my dear  That hill and stream my zeal oppose  And check my fond career  No more since Daphne was my theme  Their wonted charms I see  That verdant hill and silver stream  Divide my love and me  SONG  YE gentle Nymphs and gen'rous Dames  That rule o'er ev'ry British mind  Be sure ye sooth their am'rous flames  Be sure your laws are not unkind  For hard it is to wear their bloom  In unremitting sighs away  To mourn the night's oppressive gloom  And faintly bless the rising day  And cruel 'twere a freeborn swain  A British youth should vainly moan  Who scornful of a tyrant's chain  Submits to your's and your's alone  Nor pointed spear nor links of steel  Could e'er those gallant minds subdue  Who Beauty's wounds with pleasure feel  And boast the fetters wrought by you  SONG THE SKYLARK  GO tuneful Bird that gladd'st the skies  To Daphne's window speed thy way  And there on quiv'ring pinions rise  And there thy vocal art display  And if she deign thy notes to hear  And if she praise thy matin song  Tell her the sounds that sooth her ear  To Damon's native plains belong  Tell her in livelier plumes array'd  The bird from Indian groves may shine  But ask the lovely partial maid  What are his notes compar'd to thine  Then bid her treat yon' witless beau  And all his flaunting race with scorn  And lend an ear to Damon's woe  Who sings her praise and sings forlorn  SONG  Ah ego non aliter tristes evincere morbos  Optarem quam te sic quoque velle putem  IMITATION  Why should I wish to banish sore disease  Unless returning health my Delia please  ON ev'ry tree in ev'ry plain  I trace the jovial spring in vain  A sickly languor veils mine eyes  And fast my waning vigour flies  Nor flow'ry plain nor budding tree  That smile on others smile on me  Mine eyes from death shall court repose  Nor shed a tear before they close  What bliss to me can seasons bring  Or what the needless pride of spring  The cypress bough that suits the bier  Retains its verdure all the year  'Tis true my vine so fresh and fair  Might claim a while my wonted care  My rural store some pleasure yield  So white a flock so green a field  My friends that each in kindness vie  Might well expect one parting sigh  Might well demand one tender tear  For when was Damon unsincere  But ere I ask once more to view  Yon' setting sun his race renew  Inform me Swains my Friends declare  Will pitying Delia join the prayer  SONG The attribute of Venus  YES Fulvia is like Venus fair  Has all her bloom and shape and air  But still to perfect ev'ry grace  She wantsthe smile upon her face  The crown majestic Juno wore  And Cynthia's brow the crescent bore  An helmet mark'd Minerva's mien  But smiles distinguish'd Beauty's queen  Her train was form'd of Smiles and Loves  Her chariot drawn by gentlest doves  And from her zone the nymph may find  'Tis Beauty's province to be kind  Then smile my Fair and all whose aim  Aspires to paint the Cyprian dame  Or bid her breathe in living stone  Shall take their forms from you alone  SONG    WHEN bright Roxana treads the green  In all the pride of dress and mien  Averse to freedom love and play  The dazzling rival of the day  None other beauty strikes mine eye  The lilies droop the roses die  But when disclaiming art the fair  Assumes a soft engaging air  Mild as the op'ning morn of May  Familiar friendly free and gay  The scene improves where'er she goes  More sweetly smile the pink and rose  O lovely Maid propitious hear  Nor deem thy shepherd insincere  Pity a wild illusive flame  That varies objects still the same  And let their very changes prove  The nevervary'd force of love  SONG VALENTINE'S DAY    'TIS said that under distant skies  Nor you the fact deny  What first attracts an Indian's eyes  Becomes his deity  Perhaps a lily or a rose  That shares the morning's ray  May to the waking swain disclose  The regent of the day  Perhaps a plant in yonder grove  Enrich'd with fragrant pow'r  May tempt his vagrant eyes to rove  Where blooms the sov'reign flow'r  Perch'd on the cedar's topmost bough  And gay with gilded wings  Perchance the patron of his vow  Some artless linnet sings  The swain surveys her pleas'd afraid  Then low to earth he bends  And owns upon her friendly aid  His health his life depends  Vain futile idols bird or flow'r  To tempt a vot'ry's pray'r  How would his humble homage tow'r  Should he behold my fair  Yesmight the Pagan's waking eyes  O'er Flavia's beauty range  He there would fix his lasting choice  Nor dare nor wish to change  SONG    THE fatal hours are wondrous near  That from these fountains bear my dear  A little space is giv'n in vain  She robs my sight and shuns the plain  A little space for me to prove  My boundless flame my endless love  And like the train of vulgar hours  Invidious Time that space devours  Near yonder beach is Delia's way  On that I gaze the livelong day  No eastern monarch's dazzling pride  Should draw my longing eyes aside  The chief that knows of succours nigh  And sees his mangled legions die  Casts not a more impatient glance  To see the loit'ring aids advance  Not more the schoolboy that expires  Far from his native home requires  To see some friend's familiar face  Or meet a parent's last embrace  She comesbut ah what crowds of beaus  In radiant bands my fair enclose  Oh better hadst thou shunn'd the green  Oh Delia better far unseen  Methinks by all my tender fears  By all my sighs by all my tears  I might from torture now be free  'Tis more than death to part from thee  SONG    THE lovely Delia smiles again  That killing frown has left her brow  Can she forgive my jealous pain  And give me back my angry vow  Love is an April's doubtful day  A while we see the tempest low'r  Anon the radiant heav'n survey  And quite forget the flitting show'r  The flow'rs that hung their languid head  Are burnish'd by the transient rains  The vines their wonted tendrils spread  And double verdure gilds the plains  The sprightly birds that droop'd no less  Beneath the pow'r of rain and wind  In ev'ry raptur'd note express  The joy I feelwhen thou art kind  SONG    PERHAPS it is not love said I  That melts my soul when Flavia's nigh  Where wit and sense like her's agree  One may be pleas'd and yet be free  The beauties of her polish'd mind  It needs no lover's eye to find  The hermit freezing in his cell  Might wish the gentle Flavia well  It is not loveaverse to bear  The servile chain that lovers wear  Let let me all my fears remove  My doubts dispelit is not love  Oh when did wit so brightly shine  In any form less fair than thine  It isit is love's subtle fire  And under friendship lurks desire  SONG    O'ER desert plains and rushy meers  And wither'd heaths I rove  Where tree nor spire nor cot appears  I pass to meet my love  But tho' my path were damask'd o'er  With beauties e'er so fine  My busy thoughts would fly before  To fix aloneon thine  No fircrown'd hills could give delight  No palace please mine eye  No pyramid's aërial height  Where mould'ring monarchs lie  Unmov'd should Eastern kings advance  Could I the pageant see  Splendour might catch one scornful glance  Not steal one thought from thee  SONG WINTER    No more ye warbling Birds rejoice  Of all that cheer'd the plain  Echo alone preserves her voice  And sherepeats my pain  Where'er my lovesick limbs I lay  To shun the rushing wind  Its busy murmur seems to say  " She never will be kind"  The Naiads o'er their frozen urns  In icy chains repine  And each in sullen silence mourns  Her freedom lost like mine  Soon will the sun's returning rays  The cheerless frost control  When will relenting Delia chase  The winter of my soul  SONG THE SCHOLAR'S RELAPSE  BY the side of a grove at the foot of a hill  Where whisper'd the beech and where murmur'd the rill  I vow'd to the Muses my time and my care  Since neither could win me the smiles of my fair  Free I rang'd like the birds like the birds free I sung  And Delia's lov'd name scarce escap'd from my tongue  But if once a smooth accent delighted my ear  I should wish unawares that my Delia might hear  With fairest ideas my bosom I stor'd  Allusive to none but the nymph I ador'd  And the more I with study my fancy refin'd  The deeper impression she made on my mind  So long as of Nature the charms I pursue  I still must my Delia's dear image renew  The Graces have yielded with Delia to rove  And the Muses are all in alliance with Love  SONG THE ROSEBUD  " SEE Daphne see" Florelio cry'd  " And learn the sad effects of pride  " Yon' shelter'd Rose how safe conceal'd  " How quickly blasted when reveal'd  " The sun with warm attractive rays  " Tempts it to wanton in the blaze  " A gale succeeds from eastern skies  " And all its blushing radiance dies  " So you my Fair of charms divine  " Will quit the plains too fond to shine  " Where Fame's transporting rays allure  " Tho' here more happy more secure  " The breath of some neglected maid  " Shall make you sigh you left the shade  " A breath to beauty's bloom unkind  " As to the Rose an eastern wind"  The nymph reply'd"You first my Swain  " Confine your sonnets to the plain  " One envious tongue alike disarms  " You of your wit me of my charms  " What is unknown the poet's skill  " Or what unheard the tuneful thrill  " What unadmir'd a charming mien  " Or what the Rose's blush unseen  SONG DAPHNE'S VISIT  YE Birds for whom I rear'd the grove  With melting lay salute my love  My Daphne with your notes detain  Or I have rear'd my grove in vain  Ye Flow'rs before her footsteps rise  Display at once your brightest dyes  That she your op'ning charms may see  Or what were all your charms to me  Kind Zephyr brush each fragrant flow'r  And shed its odours round my bow'r  Or never more O gentle Wind  Shall I from thee refreshment find  Ye Streams if e'er your banks I lov'd  If e'er your native sounds improv'd  May each soft murmur sooth my fair  Or oh 'twill deepen my despair  And thou my Grot whose lonely bounds  The melancholy pine surrounds  May Daphne praise thy peaceful gloom  Or thou shalt prove her Damon's tomb  SONG Written in a Collection of Bacchanalian Songs  ADIEU ye jovial Youths who join  To plunge Old Care in floods of wine  And as your dazzled eyeballs roll  Discern him struggling in the bowl  Nor yet is hope so wholly flown  Nor yet is thought so tedious grown  But limpid stream and shady tree  Retain as yet some sweets for me  And see thro' yonder silent grove  See yonder does my Daphne rove  With pride her footsteps I pursue  And bid your frantic joys adieu  The sole confusion I admire  Is that my Daphne's eyes inspire  I scorn the madness you approve  And value reason next to love  SONG Imitated from the French  YES these are the scenes where with Iris I stray'd  But short was her sway for so lovely a maid  In the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run  In the bloom of her graces too fair for a nun  Illgrounded no doubt a devotion must prove  So fatal to beauty so killing to love  Yes these are the meadows the shrubs and the plains  Once the scene of my pleasures the scene of my pains  How many soft moments I spent in this grove  How fair was my nymph and how fervent my love  Be still tho' my Heart thine emotion give o'er  Remember the season of love is no more  With her how I stray'd amid fountains and bow'rs  Or loiter'd behind and collected the flow'rs  Then breathless with ardour my fair one pursu'd  And to think with what kindness my garland she view'd  But be still my fond Heart this emotion give o'er  Fain wouldst thou forget thou must love her no more  SONG  WHEN bright Ophelia treads the green  In all the pride of dress and mien  Averse to freedom mirth and play  The lofty rival of the day  Methinks to my enchanted eye  The lilies droop the roses die  But when disdaining art the fair  Assumes a soft engaging air  Mild as the opening morn of May  And as the feather'd warblers gay  The scene improves where'er she goes  More sweetly smiles the pink and rose  " O lovely maid propitious hear  " Nor think thy Damon insincere  " Pity my wild delusive flame  " For tho' the flow'rs are still the same  " To me they languish or improve  " And plainly tell me that I love"  SONG  WHEN first Philander first I came  Where Avon rolls his winding stream  The nymphshow brisk the swainshow gay  To see Asteria queen of May  The parsons round her praises sung  The steeples with her praises rung  I thoughtno sight that e'er was seen  Could match the fight of Barel's Green  But now since old Eugenio dy'd  The chief of poets and the pride  Now meaner bards in vain aspire  To raise their voice to tune their lyre  Their lovely season now is o'er  Thy notes Florelio please no more  No more Asteria's smiles are seen  Adieuthe sweets of Barel's Green  THE HALCYON  WHY o'er the verdant banks of ooze  Does yonder Halcyon speed so fast  'Tis all because she would not lose  Her fav'rite calm that will not last  The sun with azure paints the skies  The stream reflects each flow'ry spray  And frugal of her time she flies  To take her fill of love and play  See her when rugged Boreas blows  Warm in some rocky cell remain  To seek for pleasure well she knows  Would only then enhance the pain  " Descend" she cries "thou hated show'r  " Deform my limpid waves today  " For I have chose a fairer hour  " To take my fill of love and play"  You too my Silvia sure will own  Life's azure seasons swiftly roll  And when our youth or health is flown  To think of love but shocks the soul  Could Damon but deserve thy charms  As thou art Damon's only theme  He'd fly as quick to Delia's arms  As yonder Halcyon skims the stream  MORAL PIECES  THE JUDGMENT OF HERCULES  WHILE blooming Spring descends from genial skies  By whose mild influence instant wonders rise  From whose soft breath Elysian beauties flow  The sweets of Hagley or the pride of Stowe  Will Lyttleton the rural landscape range  Leave noisy fame and not regret the change  Pleas'd will he tread the garden's early scenes  And learn a moral from the rising greens  There warm'd alike by Sol's enliv'ning pow'r  The weed aspiring emulates the flow'r  The drooping flow'r its fairer charms display'd  Invites from grateful hands their gen'rous aid  Soon if none check th' invasive foe's designs  The lively lustre of these scenes declines  'Tis thus the spring of youth the morn of life  Rears in our minds the rival seeds of strife  Then passion riots reason then contends  And on the conquest ev'ry bliss depends  Life from the nice decision takes its hue  And bless'd those judges who decide like you  On worth like theirs shall ev'ry bliss attend  The world their fav'rite and the world their friend  There are who blind to Thought's fatiguing ray  As Fortune gives examples urge their way  Not Virtue's foes tho' they her paths decline  And scarce her friends tho' with her friends they join  In her's or Vice's casual road advance  Thoughtless the sinners or the saints of Chance  Yet some more nobly scorn the vulgar voice  With judgment fix with zeal pursue their choice  When ripen'd thought when reason born to reign  Checks the wild tumults of the youthful vein  While passion's lawless tides at their command  Glide thro' more useful tracts and bless the land  Happiest of these is he whose matchless mind  By learning strengthen'd and by taste refin'd  In Virtue's cause essay'd its earliest pow'rs  Chose Virtue's paths and strewed her paths with flow'rs  The first alarm'd if Freedom waves her wings  The fittest to adorn each art she brings  Lov'd by that prince whom ev'ry virtue fires  Prais'd by that bard whom ev'ry Muse inspires  Bless'd in the tuneful art the social flame  In all that wins in all that merits fame  'Twas youth's perplexing stage his doubts inspir'd  When great Alcides to a grove retir'd  Thro' the lone windings of a devious glade  Resign'd to thought with ling'ring steps he stray'd  Blest with a mind to taste sincerer joys  Arm'd with a heart each false one to despise  Dubious he stray'd with wav'ring thoughts possest  Alternate passions struggling shar'd his breast  The various arts which human cares divide  In deep attention all his mind employ'd  Anxious if Fame an equal bliss secur'd  Or silent Ease with softer charms allur'd  The sylvan choir whose numbers sweetly flow'd  The fount that murmur'd and the flow'rs that blow'd  The silver flood that in meanders led  His glitt'ring streams along th' enliven'd mead  The soothing breeze and all those beauties join'd  Which whilst they please effeminate the mind  In vain while distant on a summit rais'd  Th' imperial tow'rs of Fame attractive blaz'd  While thus he trac'd thro' Fancy's puzzling maze  The sep'rate sweets of pleasure and of praise  Sudden the wind a fragrant gale convey'd  And a new lustre gain'd upon the shade  At once before his wond'ring eyes were seen  Two female forms of more than mortal mien  Various their charms and in their dress and face  Each seem'd to vie with some peculiar grace  This whose attire less clogg'd with art appear'd  The simple sweets of innocence endear'd  Her sprightly bloom her quick sagacious eye  Shew'd native merit mix'd with modesty  Her air diffus'd a mild yet awful ray  Severely sweet and innocently gay  Such the chaste image of the martial maid  In artless folds of virgin white array'd  She let no borrow'd rose her cheeks adorn  Her blushing cheeks that sham'd the purple morn  Her charms nor had nor wanted artful foils  Or study'd gestures or wellpractis'd smiles  She scorn'd the toys which render beauty less  She prov'd th' engaging chastity of dress  And while she chose in native charms to shine  Ev'n thus she seem'd nay more than seem'd divine  One modest em'rald clasp'd the robe she wore  And in her hand th' imperial sword she bore  Sublime her height majestic was her pace  And match'd the awful honours of her face  The shrubs the flow'rs that deck'd the verdant ground  Seem'd where she trod with rising lustre crown'd  Still her approach with stronger influence warm'd  She pleas'd while distant but when near she charm'd  So strikes the gazer's eye the silver gleam  That glitt'ring quivers o'er a distant stream  But from its banks we see new beauties rise  And in its crystal bosom trace the skies  With other charms the rival vision glow'd  And from her dress her tinsel beauties flow'd  A flutt'ring robe her pamper'd shape conceal'd  And seem'd to shade the charms it best reveal'd  Its form contriv'd her faulty size to grace  Its hue to give fresh lustre to her face  Her plaited hair disguis'd with brilliants glar'd  Her cheeks the ruby's neighb'ring lustre shar'd  The gaudy topaz lent its gay supplies  And ev'ry gem that strikes less curious eyes  Expos'd her breast with foreign sweets perfum'd  And round her brow a roseate garland bloom'd  Soft smiling blushing lips conceal'd her wiles  Yet ah the blushes artful as the smiles  Oft' gazing on her shade th' enraptur'd fair  Decreed the substance well deserv'd her care  Her thoughts to others' charms malignly blind  Centred in that and were to that confin'd  And if on others' eyes a glance were thrown  'Twas but to watch the influence of her own  Much like her guardian fair Cythera's queen  When for her warrior she refines her mien  Or when to bless her Delian fav'rite's arms  The radiant fair invigorates her charms  Much like her pupil Egypt's sportive dame  Her dress expressive and her air the same  When her gay bark o'er silver Cydnos roll'd  And all th' emblazon'd streamers wav'd in gold  Such shone the vision nor forebore to move  The fond contagious airs of lawless love  Each wanton eye deluding glances fir'd  And am'rous dimples on each cheek conspir'd  Lifeless her gait and slow with seeming pain  She dragg'd her loit'ring limbs along the plain  Yet made some faint efforts and first approach'd the swain  So glaring draughts with tawdry lustre bright  Spring to the view and rush upon the sight  More slowly charms a Raphael's chaster air  Waits the calm search and pays the searcher's care  Wrapp'd in a pleas'd suspense the youth survey'd  The various charms of each attractive maid  Alternate each he view'd and each admir'd  And found alternate varying flames inspir'd  Quick o'er their forms his eyes with pleasure ran  When she who first approach'd him first began  " Hither dear Boy direct thy wand'ring eyes  " 'Tis here the lovely Vale of Pleasure lies  " Debate no more to me thy life resign  " Each sweet which Nature can diffuse is mine  " For me the nymph diversifies her pow'r  " Springs in a tree or blossoms in a flow'r  " To please my ear she tunes the linnet's strains  " To please my eye with lilies paints the plains  " To form my couch in mossy beds she grows  " To gratify my smell perfumes the rose  " Reveals the fair the fertile scene you see  " And swells the vegetable world for me  " Let the gull'd fool the toils of war pursue  " Where bleed the many to enrich the few  " Where Chance from Courage claims the boasted prize  " Where tho' she give your country oft' denies  " Industrious thou shalt Cupid's wars maintain  " And ever gently fight his soft campaign  " His darts alone shalt wield his wounds endure  " Yet only suffer to enjoy the cure  " Yield but to mea choir of nymphs shall rise  " And fire thy breast and bless thy ravish'd eyes  " Their beauteous cheeks a fairer rose shall wear  " A brighter lily on their necks appear  " Where fondly thou thy favour'd head shalt rest  " Soft as the down that swells the eygnet's nest  " While Philomel in each soft voice complains  " And gently lulls thee with mellifluous strains  " Whilst with each accent sweetest odours flow  " And spicy gums round ev'ry bosom glow  " Not the fam'd bird Arabian climes admire  " Shall in such luxury of sweets expire  " At Sloth let War's victorious sons exclaim  " In vain for Pleasure is my real name  " Nor envy thou the head with bays o'ergrown  " No seek thou roses to adorn thy own  " For well each op'ning scene that claims my care  " Suits and deserves the beauteous crown I wear  " Let others prune the vine the genial bowl  " Shall crown thy table and enlarge thy soul  " Let vulgar hands explore the brilliant mine  " So the gay produce glitter still on thine  " Indulgent Bacchus loads his lab'ring tree  " And guarding gives its clust'ring sweets to me  " For my lov'd train Apollo's piercing beam  " Darts thro' the passive glebe and frames the gem  " See in my cause consenting gods employ'd  " Nor slight these gods their blessings unenjoy'd  " For thee the poplar shall its amber drain  " For thee in clouded beauty spring the cane  " Some costly tribute ev'ry clime shall pay  " Some charming treasure ev'ry wind convey  " Each object round some pleasing scene shall vield  " Art build thy dome while Nature decks thy field  " Of Corinth's Order shall the structure rise  " The spiring turrets glitter thro' the skies  " Thy costly robe shall glow with Tyrian rays  " Thy vase shall sparkle and thy car shall blaze  " Yet thou whatever pomp the sun display  " Shalt own the am'rous night exceeds the day  " When melting flutes and sweetlysounding lyres  " Wake the gay Loves and cite the young Desires  " Or in th' Ionian dance some fav'rite maid  " Improves the flame her sparkling eyes convey'd  " Think can'st thou quit a glowing Delia's arms  " To feed on Virtue's visionary charms  " Or slight the joys which wit and youth engage  " For the faint honour of a frozen sage  " To find dull envy ev'n that hope deface  " And where you toil'd for glory reap disgrace  " O think that beauty waits on thy decree  " And thy lov'd loveliest charmer pleads with me  " She whose soft smile or gentler glance to move  " You vow'd the wild extremities of love  " In whose endearments years like moments flew  " For whose endearments millions seem'd too few  " She she implores she bids thee seize the prime  " And tread with her the flow'ry tracts of time  " Nor thus her lovely bloom of life bestow  " On some cold lover or insulting foe  " Think if against that tongue thou canst rebel  " Where love yet dwelt and reason seem'd to dwell  " What strong persuasion arms her softer sighs  " What full conviction sparkles in her eyes  " See Nature smiles and birds salute the shade  " Where breathing jasmine screens the sleeping maid  " And such her charms as to the vain may prove  " Ambition seeks more humble joys than Love  " There busy toil shall ne'er invade thy reign  " Nor sciences perplex thy lab'ring brain  " Or none but what with equal sweets invite  " Nor other arts but to prolong delight  " Sometimes thy fancy prune her tender wing  " To praise a pendant or to grace a ring  " To fix the dress that suits each varying mien  " To shew where best the clust'ring gems are seen  " To sigh soft strains along the vocal grove  " And tell the charms the sweet effects of love  " Nor fear to find a coy disdainful Muse  " Nor think the Sisters will their aid refuse  " Cool grots and tinkling rills or silent shades  " Soft scenes of leisure suit th' harmonious maids  " And all the wise and all the grave decree  " Some of that sacred train ally'd to me  " But if more specious ease thy wishes claim  " And thy breast glow with faint desire of fame  " Some softer science shall thy thoughts amuse  " And learning's name a solemn sound diffuse  " To thee all Nature's curious stores I'll bring  " Explain the beauties of an insect's wing  " The plant which Nature less diffusely kind  " Has to few climes with partial care confin'd  " The shell she scatters with more careless air  " And in her frolics seems supremely fair  " The worth that dazzles in the tulip's stains  " Or lurks beneath a pebble's various veins  " Sleep's downy god averse to war's alarms  " Shall o'er thy head diffuse his softest charms  " Ere anxious thought thy dear repose assail  " Or care my most destructive foe prevail  " The wat'ry nymphs shall tune the vocal vales  " And gentle zephyrs harmonize their gales  " For thy repose inform with rival joy  " Their streams to murmur and their winds to sigh  " Thus shalt thou spend the sweetlyflowing day  " Till lost in bliss thou breathe thy soul away  " Till she t' Elysian bow'rs of joy repair  " Nor find my charming scenes exceeded there"  She ceas'd and on a lily'd bank reclin'd  Her flowing robe wav'd wanton with the wind  One tender hand her drooping head sustains  One points expressive to the flow'ry plains  Soon the fond youth perceiv'd her influence roll  Deep in his breast to melt his manly soul  As when Favonius joins the solar blaze  And each fair fabric of the frost decays  Soon to his breast the soft harangue convey'd  Resolves too partial to the specious maid  He sigh'd he gaz'd so sweetly smil'd the dame  Yet sighing gazing seem'd to scorn his flame  And oft' as Virtue caught his wand'ring eye  A crimson blush condemn'd the rising sigh  'Twas such the ling'ring Trojan's shame betray'd  When Maia's son the frown of Jove display'd  When wealth fame empire could no balance prove  For the soft reign of Dido and of love  Thus ill with arduous glory love conspires  Soft tender flames with bold impetuous fires  Some hov'ring doubts his anxious bosom mov'd  And Virtue zealous fair those doubts improv'd  " Fly fly fond Youth the too indulgent maid  " Nor err by such fantastic scenes betray'd  " Tho' in my path the rugged thorn be seen  " And the dry turf disclose a fainter green  " Tho' no gay rose or flow'ry product shine  " The barren surface still conceals the mine  " Each thorn that threatens ev'n the weed that grows  " In Virtue's path superior sweets bestows  " Yet should those boasted specious toys allure  " Whence could fond Sloth the flatt'ring gifts procure  " The various wealth that tempts thy fond desire  " 'Tis I alone her greatest foe acquire  " I from old Ocean rob the treasur'd store  " I thro' each region latent gems explore  " 'Twas I the rugged brilliant first reveal'd  " By num'rous strata deep in earth conceal'd  " 'Tis I the surface yet refine and show  " The modest gem's intrinsic charms to glow  " Nor swells the grape nor spires its feeble tree  " Without the firm supports of industry  " But grant we Sloth the scene herself has drawn  " The mossy grotto and the flow'ry lawn  " Let Philomela tune th' harmonious gale  " And with each breeze eternal sweets exhale  " Let gay Pomona slight the plains around  " And chuse for fairest fruits the favour'd ground  " To bless the fertile vale should Virtue cease  " Nor mossy grots nor flow'ry lawns could please  " Nor gay Pomona's luscious gifts avail  " The sound harmonious or the spicy gale  " Seest thou yon' rocks in dreadful pomp arise  " Whose rugged cliffs deform th' encircling skies  " Those fields whence Phoebus all their moisture drains  " And too profusely fond disrobes the plains  " When I vouchsafe to tread the barren soil  " Those rocks seem lovely and those deserts smile  " The form thou view'st to ev'ry scene with ease  " Transfers its charms and ev'ry scene can please  " When I have on those pathless wilds appear'd  " And the lone wand'rerwith my presence cheer'd  " Those cliffs the exile has with pleasure view'd  " And call'd that desert Blissful Solitude  " Nor I alone to such extend my care  " Fairblooming Health surveys her altars there  " Brown Exercise will lead thee where she reigns  " And with reflected lustre gild the plains  " With her in flow'r of youth and beauty's pride  " Her offspring calm Content and Peace reside  " One ready off'ring suits each neighb'ring shrine  " And all obey their laws who practise mine  " But Health averse from Sloth's smooth region flies  " And in her absence Pleasure droops and dies  " Her bright companions Mirth Delight Repose  " Smile where she smiles and sicken when she goes  " A galaxy of pow'rs whose forms appear  " For ever beauteous and for ever near  " Nor will soft Sleep to Sloth's request incline  " He from her couches flies unbid to mine  " Vain is the sparkling bowl the warbling strain  " Th' incentive song the labour'd viand vain  " Where she relentless reigns without control  " And checks each gay excursion of the soul  " Unmov'd tho' Beauty deck'd in all its charms  " Grace the rich couch and spread the softest arms  " Till joyless indolence suggests desires  " Or drugs are sought to furnish languid fires  " Such languid fires as on the vitals prey  " Barren of bliss but fertile of decay  " As artful heats apply'd to thirsty lands  " Produce no flow'rs and but debase the sands  " But let fair Health her cheering smiles impart  " How sweet is Nature how superfluous Art  " 'Tis she the fountain's ready draught commends  " And smooths the flinty couch which Fortune lends  " And when my hero from his toils retires  " Fills his gay bosom with unusual fires  " And while no checks th' unbounded joy reprove  " Aids and refines the genuine sweets of love  " His fairest prospect rising trophies frame  " His sweetest music is the voice of Fame  " Pleasures to Sloth unknown she never found  " How fair the prospect or how sweet the sound  " See Fame's gay structure from yon'summit charms  " And fires the manly breast to arts or arms  " Nor dread the steep ascent by which you rise  " From grov'lling vales to tow'rs which reach theskies  " Love fame esteem 'tis labour must acquire  " The smiling offspring of a rigid sire  " To fix the friend your service must be shown  " All ere they lov'd your merit lov'd their own  " That wond'ring Greece your portrait may admire  " That tuneful bards may string for you their lyre  " That books may praise or coins record your name  " Such such rewards 'tis toil alone can claim  " And the same column which displays to view  " The conqu'ror's name displays the conquest too  " 'Twas slow Experience tedious mistress taught  " All that e'er nobly spoke or bravely fought  " 'Twas she the patriot she the bard refin'd  " In arts that serve protect or please mankind  " Not the vain visions of inactive schools  " Not Fancy's maxims not Opinion's rules  " E'er form'd the man whose gen'rous warmth extends  " T' enrich his country or to serve his friends  " On active worth the laurel War bestows  " Peace rears her olive for industrious brows  " Nor earth uncultur'd yields its kind supplies  " Nor heav'n its show'rs without a sacrifice  " See far below such grov'lling scenes of shame  " As lull to rest Ignavia's slumb'ring dame  " Her friends from all the toils of Fame secure  " Alas inglorious greater toils endure  " Doom'd all to mourn who in her cause engage  " A youth enervate and a painful age  " A sickly sapless mass if Reason flies  " And if she linger impotently wise  " A thoughtless train who pamper'd sleek and gay  " Invite old age and revel youth away  " From life's fresh vigour move the load of care  " And idly place it where they least can bear  " When to the mind diseas'd for aid they fly  " What kind reflection shall the mind supply  " When with lost health what should the loss allay  " Peace peace is lost a comfortless decay  " But to my friends when youth when pleasure flies  " And earth's dim beauties fade before their eyes  " Thro' death's dark vista flow'ry tracts are seen  " Elysian plains and groves for ever green  " If o'er their lives a refluent glance they cast  " Their's is the present who can praise the past  " Life has its bliss for these when past its bloom  " As wither'd roses yield a late perfume  " Serene and safe from passion's stormy rage  " How calm they glide into the port of Age  " Of the rude voyage less depriv'd than eas'd  " More tir'd than pain'd and weaken'd than diseas'd  " For health on age 'tis temp'rance must bestow  " And peace from piety alone can flow  " And all the incense bounteous Jove requires  " Has sweets for him who feeds the sacred fires  " Sloth views the tow'rs of Fame with envious eyes  " Desirous still still impotent to rise  " Oft' when resolv'd to gain those blissful tow'rs  " The pensive queen the dir  ascent explores  " Comes onward wafted by the balmy trees  " Some sylvan music or some scented breeze  " She turns her head her own gay realm she spies  " And all the shortliv'd resolution dies  " Thus some sond insect's falt'ring pinions wave  " Clasp'd in its fav'rite sweets a lasting slave  " And thus in vain these charming visions please  " The wretch of glory and the slave of ease  " Doom'd ever in ignoble state to pine  " Boast her own scenes and languish after mine  " But shun her snares nor let the world exclaim  " Thy birth which was thy glory prov'd thy shame  " With early hope thine infant actions fir'd  " Let manhood crown what infancy inspir'd  " Let gen'rous toils reward with health thy days  " Prolong thy prime and eternize thy praise  " The bold exploit that charms th' attesting age  " To latest times shall gen'rous hearts engage  " And with that myrtle shall thy shrine be crown'd  " With which alive thy graceful brows were bound  " Till Time shall bid thy virtues freely bloom  " And raise a temple where it found a tomb  " Then in their feasts thy name shall Grecians join  " Shall pour the sparkling juice to Jove's and thine  " Thine us'd in war shall raise their native fire  " Thine us'd in peace their mutual faith inspire  " Dulness perhaps thro' want of sight may blame  " And Spleen with odious industry defame  " And that the honours giv'n with wonder view  " And this in secret sadness own them due  " Contempt and Envy were by Fate design'd  " The rival tyrants which divide mankind  " Contempt which none but who deserve can bear  " While Envy's wounds the smiles of Fame repair  " For know the gen'rous thine exploits shall fire  " Thine ev'ry friend it suits thee to require  " Lov'd by the gods and till their seats I show  " Lov'd by the good their images below"  " Cease lovely Maid fair daughter of the Skies  " My guide my queen" th' ecstatic youth replies  " In thee I trace a form design'd for sway  " Which chiefs may court and kings with pride obey  " And by thy bright immortal friends I swear  " Thy fair idea shall no toils impair  " Lead me O lead me where whole hosts of foes  " Thy form depreciate and thy friends oppose  " Welcome all toils th' inequal Fates decree  " While toils endear thy faithful charge to thee  " Such be my cares to bind th' oppressive hand  " And crush the fetters of an injur'd land  " To see the monster's noxious life resign'd  " And tyrants quell'd the monsters of mankind  " Nature shall smile to view the vanquish'd brood  " And none but Envy riot unsubdu'd  " In cloister'd state let selfish sages dwell  " Proud that their heart is narrow as their cell  " And boast their mazy labyrinth of rules  " Far less the friends of Virtue than the fools  " Yet such in vain thy fav'ring smiles pretend  " For he is thine who proves his country's friend  " Thus when my life wellspent the good enjoy  " And the mean envious labour to destroy  " When strongly lur'd by Fame's contiguous shrine  " I yet devote my choicer vows to thine  " If all my toils thy promis'd favour claim  " O lead thy fav'rite thro' the gates of Fame"  He ceas'd his vows and with disdainful air  He turn'd to blast the late exulting fair  But vanish'd fled to some more friendly shore  The conscious phantom's beauty pleas'd no more  Convinc'd her spurious charms of dress and face  Claim'd a quick conquest or a sure disgrace  Fantastic Pow'r whose transient charms allur'd  While Error's mist the reas'ning mind obscur'd  Not such the vict'ress Virtue's constant queen  Endur'd the test of truth and dar'd be seen  Her bright'ning form and features seem'd to own  'Twas all her wish her int'rest to be known  And when his longing view the fair declin'd  Left a full image of her charms behind  Thus reigns the moon with furtive splendour crown'd  While glooms oppress us and thick shades surround  But let the source of light its beams display  Languid and faint the mimic flames decay  And all the sick'ning splendour fades away  THE PROGRESS OF TASTE OR THE FATE OF DELICACY  A poem on the temper and studies of the Author and how great a misfortune it is for a man of small estate to have much taste  PART THE FIRST  PERHAPS some cloud eclips'd the day  When thus I tun'd my pensive lay  " The ship is launch'dwe catch the gale  " On life's extended ocean sail  " For happiness our course we bend  " Our ardent cry our general end  " Yet ah the scenes which tempt our care  " Are like the forms dispers'd in air  " Still dancing near disorder'd eyes  " And weakest his who best descries"  Yet let me not my birthright barter  For wishing is the poet's charter  All bards have leave to wish what's wanted  Tho' few e'er found their wishes granted  Extensive field where poets pride them  In singing all that is deny'd them  For humble ease ye Pow'rs I pray  That plain warm suit for ev'ry day  And pleasure and brocade bestow  To flaunt itonce a month or so  The first for constant wear we want  The first ye Pow'rs for ever grant  But constant wear the last bespatters  And turns the tissue into tatters  Where'er my vagrant course I bend  Let me secure one faithful friend  Let me in public scenes request  A friend of wit and taste well dress'd  And if I must not hope such favour  A friend of wit and taste however  Alas that Wisdom ever shuns  To congregate her scatter'd sons  Whose nervous forces well combin'd  Would win the field and sway mankind  The fool will squeeze from morn to night  To fix his follies full in sight  The note he strikes the plume he shows  Attract whole flights of fops and beaus  And kindredfools who ne'er had known him  Flock at the sight caress and own him  But illstarr'd Sense nor gay nor loud  Steals soft on tiptoe thro' the crowd  Conveys his meagre form between  And slides like pervious air unseen  Contracts his known tenuity  As tho' 'twere ev'n a crime to be  Nor ev'n permits his eyes to stray  And win acquaintance in their way  In company so mean his air  You scarce are conscious he is there  Till from some nook like sharpen'd steel  Occurs his face's thin profile  Still seeming from the gazer's eye  Like Venus newly bath'd to fly  Yet while reluctant he displays  His real gems before the blaze  The fool hath in its centre plac'd  His tawdry stock of painted paste  Disus'd to speak he tries his skill  Speaks coldly and succeeds but ill  His pensive manner dulness deem'd  His modesty reserve esteem'd  His wit unknown his learning vain  He wins not one of all the train  And those who mutually known  In friendship's fairest list had shone  Less prone than pebbles to unite  Retire to shades from public sight  Grow savage quit their social nature  And starve to study mutual satire  But friends and fav'rites to chagrin them  Find counties countries seas between them  Meet once ayear then part and then  Retiring wish to meet again  Sick of the thought let me provide  Some human form to grace my side  At hand where'er I shape my course  An useful pliant stalkinghorse  No gesture free from some grimace  No seam without its share of lace  But mark'd with gold or silver either  Hint where his coat was piec'd together  His legs be lengthen'd I advise  And stockings roll'd abridge his thighs  What tho' Vandyck had other rules  What had Vandyck to do with fools  Be nothing wanting but his mind  Before a solit  ire behind  A twisted ribbon like the track  Which Nature gives an ass's back  Silent as midnight pity 'twere  His wisdom's slender wealth to share  And whilst in flocks our fancies stray  To wish the poor man's lamb away  This form attracting ev'ry eye  I stroll all unregarded by  This wards the jokes of ev'ry kind  As an umbrella sun or wind  Or like a spunge absorbs the sallies  And pestilential fumes of malice  Or like a splendid shield is fit  To screen the Templar's random wit  Or what some gentler cit lets fall  As woolpacks quash the leaden ball  Aliusions these of weaker force  And apter still the stalkinghorse  O let me wander all unseen  Beneath the sanction of his mien  As lilies soft as roses fair  Empty as airpumps drain'd of air  With steady eye and pace remark  The speckled flock that haunts the Park  St James's    Level my pen with wondrous heed  At follies flocking there to feed  And as my satire bursts amain  See feather'd fopp'ry strew the plain  But when I seek my rural grove  And share the peaceful haunts I love  Let none of this unhallow'd train  My sweet sequester'd paths profane  Oft' may some polish'd virtuous friend  To these softwinding vales descend  And love with me inglorious things  And scorn with me the pomp of kings  And check me when my bosom burns  For statues paintings coins and urns  For I in Damon's pray'r could join  And Damon's wish might now be mine  But all dispers'd the wish the pray'r  Are driv'n to mix with common air  PART THE SECOND  How happy once was Damon's lot  While yet romantic schemes were not  Ere yet he sent his weakly eyes  To plan frail castles in the skies  Forsaking pleasures cheap and common  To court a blaze still flitting from one  Ah happy Damon thrice and more  Had Taste ne'er touch'd thy tranquil shore  Oh days when to a girdle ty'd  The couples jingled at his side  And Damon swore he would not barter  The sportsman's girdle for a garter  Whoever came to kill an hour  Found easy Damon in their pow'r  Pure social Nature all his guide  " Damon had not a grain of pride"  He wish'd not to elude the snares  Which Knav'ry plans and Crast prepares  But rather wealth to crown their wiles  And win their universal smiles  For who are cheerful who at ease  But they who cheat us as they please  He wink'd at many a gross design  The newfall'n calf might countermine  Thus ev'ry fool allow'd his merit  " Yes Damon had a gen'rous spirit"  A coxcomb's jest however vile  Was sure at least of Damon's smile  That coxcomb ne'er deny'd him sense  For why it prov'd his own pretence  All own'd were modesty away  Damon could shine as much as they  When wine and folly came in season  Damon ne'er strove to save his reason  Obnoxious to the mad uproar  A spy upon a hostile shore  'Twas this his company endear'd  Mirth never came till he appear'd  His lodgingsev'ry draw'r could show 'em  The slave was kick'd who did not know 'em  Thus Damon studious of his ease  And pleasing all whom mirth could please  Defy'd the world like idle Colley  To shew a softer word than folly  Since Wisdom's gorgonshield was known  To stare the gazer into stone  He chose to trust in Folly's charm  To keep his breast alive and warm  At length grave Learning's sober train  Remark'd the trifler with disdain  The sons of Taste contemn'd his ways  And rank'd him with the brutes that graze  While they to nobler heights aspir'd  And grew belov'd esteem'd admir'd  Hence with our youth not void of spirit  His old companions lost their merit  And ev'ry kind wellnatur'd sot  Seem'd a dull play without a plot  Where ev'ry yawning guest agrees  The willing creature strives to please  But temper never could amuse  It barely led us to excuse  'Twas true conversing they averr'd  All they had seen or felt or heard  Talents of weight for wights like these  The law might chuse for witnesses  But sure th' attesting dry narration  Ill suits a judge of conversation  What were their freedoms  Boisterous mirth  mere excuses  To vent ill manners blows and bruises  Yet freedom gallant freedom hailing  At form at form incessant railing  Would they examine each offence  Its latent cause its known pretence  Punctilio ne'er was known to breed 'em  So sure as fond prolific freedom  Their courage but a loaded gun  Machine the wise would wish to shun  Its guard unsafe its lock an ill one  Where accident might fire and kill one  In short disgusted out of measure  Thro' much contempt and slender pleasure  His sense of dignity returns  With native pride his bosom burns  He seeks respectbut how to gain it  Wit social mirth could ne'er obtain it  And laughter where it reigns uncheck'd  Discards and dissipates respect  The man who gravely bows enjoys it  But shaking hands at once destroys it  Precarious plant which fresh and gay  Shrinks at the touch and fades away  Come then Reserve yet from thy train  Banish Contempt and curs'd Disdain  Teach me he cry'd thy magic art  To act the decent distant part  To husband well my complaisance  Nor let ev'n Wit too far advance  But chuse calm Reason for my theme  In these her royal realms supreme  And o'er her charms with caution shown  Be still a graceful umbrage thrown  And each abrupter period crown'd  With nods and winks and smiles prosound  Till rescu'd from the crowd beneath  No more with pain to move or breathe  I rise with head elate to share  Salubrious draughts of purer air  Respect is won by grave pretence  And silence surer ev'n than sense  'Tis hence the sacred grandeur springs  Of Easternand of other kings  Or whence this awe to virtue due  While Virtue's distant as Peru  The sheathless sword the guard displays  Which round emits its dazzling rays  The stately fort the turrets tall  Portcullis'd gate and battled wall  Less screens the body than controls  And wards contempt from royal souls  The crowns they wear but check the eye  Before it fondly pierce too nigh  That dazzled crowds may be employ'd  Around the surface ofthe void  O 'tis the statesman's craft profound  To scatter his amusements round  To tempt us from their conscious breast  Where fullfledg'd crimes enjoy their nest  Nor awes us ev'ry worth reveal'd  So deeply as each vice conceal'd  The lordly log dispatch'd of yore  That the frog people might adore  With guards to keep them at a distance  Had reign'd nor wanted Wit's assistance  Nayhad addresses from his nation  In praise of logadministration  PART THE THIRD  THE buoyant fires of youth were o'er  And same and finery pleas'd no more  Productive of that gen'ral stare  Which cool reflection ill can bear  And crowds commencing mere vexation  Retirement sent its invitation  Romantic scenes of pendent hills  And verdant vales and falling rills  And mossy banks the fields adorn  Where Damon simple Swain was born  The Dryads rear'd a shady grove  Where such as think and such as love  May safely sigh their summer's day  Or muse their silent hours away  The Oreads lik'd the climate well  And taught the level plain to swell  In verdant mounds from whence the eye  Might all their larger works descry  The Naiads pour'd their urns around  From nodding rocks o'er vales profound  They form'd their streams to please the view  And bade them wind as serpents do  And having shewn them where to stray  Threw little pebbles in their way  These Fancy allsagacious maid  Had at their several tasks survey'd  She saw and smil'd and oft' would lead  Our Damon's foot o'er hill and mead  There with descriptive finger trace  The genuine beauties of the place  And when she all its charms had shown  Prescribe improvements of her own  " See yonder hill so green so round  " Its brow with ambient beeches crown'd  " 'Twould well become thy gentle care  " To raise a dome to Venus there  " Pleas'd would the nymphs thy zeal survey  " And Venus in their arms repay  " 'Twas such a shade and such a nook  " In such a vale near such a brook  " From such a rocky fragment springing  " That fam'd Apollo chose to sing in  " There let an altar wrought with art  " Engage thy tuneful patron's heart  " How charming there to muse and warble  " Beneath his bust of breathing marble  " With laurel wreath and mimic lyre  " That crown a poet's vast desire  " Then near it scoop the vaulted cell  " Where Music's charming maids  The Muses  may dwell  " Prone to indulge thy tender passion  " And make thee many' an assignation  " Deep in the grove's obscure retreat  " Be plac'd Minerva's sacred seat  " There let her awful turrets rise  " For Wisdom flies from vulgar eyes  " There her calm dictates shalt thou hear  " Distinctly strike thy list'ning ear  " And who would shun the pleasing labour  " To have Minerva for his neighbour"  In short so charm'd each wild suggestion  Its truth was little call'd in question  And Damon dream'd he saw the Fauns  And Nymphs distinctly skim the lawns  Now trac'd amid the trees and then  Lost in the circling shades again  With leer oblique their lover viewing  And Cupidpantingand pursuing  " Fancy enchanting Fair" he cry'd  " Be thou my goddess thou my guide  " For thy bright visions I despise  " What foes may think or friends advise  " The feign'd concern when folks survey  " Expense time study cast away  " The real spleen with which they see  " I please myself and follow thee"  Thus glow'd his breast by Fancy warm'd  And thus the fairy landscape charm'd  But most he hop'd his constant care  Might win the favour of the fair  And wand'ring late thro' yonder glade  He thus the soft design betray'd  " Ye Doves for whom I rear'd the grove  " With melting lays salute my love  " My Delia with your notes detain  " Or I have rear'd the grove in vain  " Ye Flow'rs which early spring supplies  " Display at once your brightest dyes  " That she your op'ning charms may see  " Or what were else your charms to me  " Kind Zephyr brush each fragrant flow'r  " And shed its odours round my bow'r  " Or ne'er again O gentle Wind  " Shall I in thee refreshment find  " Ye Streams if e'er your banks I lov'd  " If e'er your native sounds improv'd  " May each soft murmur sooth my fair  " Or oh 'twill deepen my despair  " Be sure ye Willows you be seen  " Array'd in liveliest robes of green  " Or I will tear your slighted boughs  " And let them fade around my brows  " And thou my Grott whose lonely bounds  " The melancholy pine surrounds  " May she admire thy peaceful gloom  " Or thou shalt prove her lover's tomb"  And now the lofty domes were rear'd  Loud laugh'd the squires the rabble star'd  " See Neighbours what our Damon's doing  " I think some folks are fond of ruin  " I saw his sheep at random stray  " But he has thrown his crook away  " And builds such huts as in foul weather  " Are fit for sheep nor shepherd neither"  Whence came the sober swain misled  Why Phoebus put it in his head  Phoebus befriends him we are told  And Phoebus coins bright tuns of gold  'Twere prudent not to be so vain on't  I think he'll never touch a grain on't  And if from Phoebus and his Muse  Mere earthly laziness ensues  'Tis plain for aught that I can say  The dev'l inspires as well as they  So theywhile fools of grosser kind  Less weeting what our bard design'd  Impute his schemes to real evil  That in these haunts he met the devil  He own'd tho' their advice was vain  It suited wights who trod the plain  For dulnesstho' he might abhor it  In them he made allowance for it  Nor wonder'd if beholding mottoes  And urns and domes and cells and grottoes  Folks little dreaming of the Muses  Were plagu'd to guess their proper uses  But did the Muses haunt his cell  Or in his dome did Venus dwell  Did Pallas in his counsels share  The Delian god reward his pray'r  Or did his zeal engage the fair  When all the structure shone complete  Not much convenient wondrous neat  Adorn'd with gilding painting planting  And the fair guests alone were wanting  Ah me 'twas Damon's own confession  Came Poverty and took possession  PART THE FOURTH  WHY droops my Damon whilst he roves  Thro' ornamented meads and groves  Near columns obelisks and spires  Which ev'ry critic eye admires  'Tis Poverty detested maid  Sole tenant of their ample shade  'Tis she that robs him of his ease  And bids their very charms displease  But now by Fancy long controll'd  And with the sons of Taste enroll'd  He deem'd it shameful to commence  First minister to Commonsense  Far more elated to pursue  The lowest talk of dear vertû  And now behold his lofty soul  That whilome flew from pole to pole  Settle on some elab'rate flow'r  And like a bee the sweets devour  Now of a rose enamour'd prove  The wild solicitudes of love  Now in a lily's cup enshrin'd  Forego the commerce of mankind  As in these toils he wore away  The calm remainder of his day  Conducting sun and shade and show'r  As most might glad the newborn flow'r  So Fate ordain'dbefore his eye  Starts up the longsought butterfly  While flutt'ring round her plumes unfold  Celestial crimson dropp'd with gold  Adieu ye bands of flow'rets fair  The living beauty claims his care  For this he stripsnor bolt nor chain  Could Damon's warm pursuit restrain  See him o'er hill morass or mound  Where'er the speckled game is found  Tho' bent with age with zeal pursue  And totter tow'rds the prey in view  Nor rock nor stream his steps retard  Intent upon the bless'd reward  One vassal fly repays the chase  A wing a film rewards the race  Rewards him tho' disease attend  And in a fatal surfeit end  So fierce Camilla skimm'd the plain  Smit with the purple's pleasing stain  She ey'd intent the glitt'ring stranger  And knew alas nor fear nor danger  Till deep within her panting heart  Malicious Fate impell'd the dart  How studious he what fav'rite food  Regales Dame Nature's tiny brood  What junkets fat the filmy people  And what liqueurs they chuse to tipple  Behold him at some crise prescribe  And raise with drugs the sick'ning tribe  Or haply when their spirits fau'ter  Sprinkling my Lord of Cloyne's tarwater  When Nature's brood of insects dies  See how he pimps for am'rous flies  See him the timely succour lend her  And help the wantons to engender  Or see him

Wilks See his very expensive proposals  what poet's loftiest lays  Can match thy labours and thy praise  Immortal Sage by Fate decreed  To guard the moth's illustrious breed  Till flutt'ring swarms on

'Tis time more social joys to prove  'Twere now your nobler taskto love  Let ***'s eyes more deeply warm  Nor slighting Nature's fairest form  The bias of your souls determine  Tow'rds the mean love of Nature's vermine  But ah how wondrous few have known  To give each stage of life its own  'Tis the pretexta's utmost bound  With radiant purple edg'd around  To please the child whose glowing dyes  Too long delight maturer eyes  And few but with regret assume  The plainwrought labours of the loom  Ah let not me by fancy steer  When life's antumnal clouds appear  Nor ev'n in learning's long delays  Consume my fairest fruitless days  Like him who should in armour spend  The sums that armour should defend  A while in Pleasure's myrtle bow'r  We share her smiles and bless her pow'r  But

her smile  Nor scorn whatever wits may say  The footpath road the king's highway  No more the scrup'lous charmer teaze  But seek the roofs of honest Ease  The rival fair no more pursu'd  Shall there with forward pace intrude  Shall there her ev'ry art essay  To win you to her slighted sway  And grant your scorn a glance more fair  Than e'er she gave your fondest pray'r  But would you happiness pursue  Partake both ease and pleasure too  Would you thro' all your days dispense  The joys of reason and of sense  Or give to life the most you can  Let social virtue shape the plan  For does not to the virtuous deed  A train of pleasing sweets succeed  Or like the sweets of wild desire  Did social pleasures ever tire  Yet midst the group be some preferr'd  Be some abhorr'dfor Damon err'd  And such there areof fair address  As 'twere unsocial to caress  O learn by Reason's equal rule  To shun the praise of knave or fool  Then tho' you deem it better still  To gain some rustic 'squire's good will  And souls however mean or vile  Like features brighten by a smile  Yet Reason holds it for a crime  The trivial breast should share thy time  And Virtue with reluctant eyes  Beholds this human sacrifice  Thro' deep reserve and air erect  Mistaken Damon won respect  But could the specious homage pass  With any creature but an ass  If conscious they who fear'd the skin  Would scorn the sluggish brute within  What awestruck slaves the tow'rs enclose  Where Persian monarchs eat and doze  What prostrate rev'rence all agree  To pay a prince they never see  Mere vassals of a royal throne  The Sophi's virtues must be shown  To make the reverence his own  As for Thaliawouldst thou make her  Thy bride without a portiontake her  She will with duteous care attend  And all thy pensive hours befriend  Will swell thy joys will share thy pain  With thee rejoice with thee complain  Will smooth thy pillow plait thy bow'rs  And bind thine aching head with flow'rs  But be this previous maxim known  If thou canst feed on Love alone  If bless'd with her thou canst sustain  Contempt and poverty and pain  If sothen rifle all her graces  And fruitful be your fond embraces  Too soon by caitiffspleen inspir'd  Sage Damon to his groves retir'd  The path disclaim'd by sober reason  Retirement claims a later season  Ere active youth and warm desires  Have quite withdrawn their ling'ring fires  With the warm bosom ill agree  Or limpid stream or shady tree  Love lurks within the rosy bow'r  And claims the speculative hour  Ambition finds his calm retreat  And bids his pulse too fiercely beat  Ev'n social Friendship duns his ear  And cites him to the public sphere  Does he resist their genuine force  His temper takes some froward course  Till passion misdirected sighs  For weeds or shells or grubs or flies  Far happiest he whose early days  Spent in the social paths of praise  Leave fairly printed on his mind  A train of virtuous deeds behind  From this rich fund the mem'ry draws  The lasting meed of selfapplause  Such fair ideas lend their aid  To people the sequester'd shade  Such are the Naiads Nymphs and Fauns  That haunt his floods or cheer his lawns  If where his devious ramble strays  He Virtue's radiant form surveys  She seems no longer now to wear  The rigid mien the frown severe  Alluding toThe allegory in Cebes's Tablet    To shew him her remote

invasive damp  Breath'd thro' the pores of earth from Stygian caves  Destroys the lamp of mirth the lamp which we  Its flamens boast to guard we know not how  But at thy sight the fading flame assumes  A ghastly blue and in a stench expires  True thou seem'st chang'd all sainted all ensky'd  The trembling tears that charge thy melting eyes  Say thou art honest and of gentle kind  But all is false an intermitting sigh  Condemns each hour each moment giv'n to smiles  And deems those only lost thou dost not lose  Ev'n for a demigroat this open'd soul  This boon companion this elastic breast

Ah never never may th' harmonious mind  Endure the worldly Poets ever void  Of guile distrustless scorn the treasur'd gold  And spurn the miser spurn his deity  Balanc'd with friendship in the poet's

 Implore his envious aid and meet his frown  But 'tis not Gomez 'tis not he whose heart  Is crusted o'er with dross whose callous mind  Is senseless as his gold the slighted Muse  Intensely loathes Tis sure no equal task  To pardon him who lavishes his wealth  On racer foxhound hawk or spaniel all  But human merit who with gold essays  All but the noblest pleasure to remove  The wants of Genius

and my soul entire  " Thus will I think averse to listen more  " To intricate discussion prone to stray  " Perhaps my reason may but ill defend  " My settled faith my mind with age impair'd  " Too sure its own infirmities declare  " But I am arm'd by caution studious youth  " And early foresight now the winds may rise  " The tempest whistle and the billows roar  " My pinnace rides in port despoil'd and worn  " Shatter'd by time and storms but while it shuns  " Th' inequal conflict and declines the deep  " Sees the strong vessel fluctuate less secure"  Thus while he strays a thousand rural scenes  Suggest instruction and instructing please  And see betwixt the grove's extended arms  An Abbey's rude remains attract thy view  Gilt by the midday sun with ling'ring step  Produce thine axe for aiming to destroy  Tree branch or shade for never shall thy breast  Too long deliberate with tim'rous hand  Remove th' obstructive bough nor yet refuse  Tho' sighing to destroy that fav'rite pine  Rais'd by thine hand in its luxuriant prime  Of beauty fair that screens the vast remains  Aggriev'd but constant as the Roman sire  The rigid Manlius when his conqu'ring son  Bled by a parent's

With pensive scenes thy philosophic mind  These were thy haunts thy opulent abodes  O Superstition hence the dire disease  Balanc'd with which the fam'd Athenian pest  Were a short headach were the trivial pain  Of transient indigestion seiz'd mankind  Long time she rag'd and scarce a southern gale  Warm'd our chill air unloaded with the threats  Of tyrant Rome but futile all till she  Rome's abler legate magnify'd their pow'r  And in a thousand horrid forms attir'd  Where then was truth to sanctify the page  Of British annals if a foe expir'd  The perjur'd monk suborn'd infernal shrieks  And fiends to snatch at the departing soul  With hellish emulation if a friend  High o'er his roof exultant angels tune  Their golden lyres and waft him to the skies  What then were vows were oaths were plighted faith  The sovereign's just the subject's loyal pact  To cherish mutual good annull'd and vain  By Roman magic grew an idle scroll  Ere the frail sanction of the wax was cold  With thee Plantagenet  Henry II  from civil broils  The land a while respir'd and all was peace  Then Becket rose and impotent of mind  From regal courts with lawless fury march'd  The church's bloodstain'd

on his vacant throne  While haughty Longchamp  Bishop of Ely Lord Chancellor  'mid his liv'ry'd files  Of wanton vassals spoil'd his faithful realm  Battling in foreign fields collecting wide  A laurel harvest for a pillag'd land  Oh dearbought trophies when a prince deserts  His drooping realm to pluck the barren sprays  When faithless John usurp'd the sully'd crown  What ample tyranny the groaning land  Deem'd earth deem'd heav'n its soe Six tedious years  Our helpless fathers in despair obey'd  The papal interdict and who obey'd  The sov'reign plunder'd O inglorious days  When the French tyrant by the futile grant  Of papal rescript claim'd Britannia's throne  And durst invade be such inglorious days  Or hence forgot or not recall'd in vain  Scarce had the tortur'd ear dejected heard  Rome's loud anathema but heartless dead  To ev'ry purpose men nor wish'd to live  Nor dar'd to die The poor laborious hind  Heard the dire curse and from his trembling hand  Fell the neglected crook that rul'd the plain  Thence journeying home in ev'ry cloud he sees  A vengeful angel in whose waving scroll  He reads damnation sees its sable train  Of grim attendants pencil'd by Despair  The weary pilgrim from remoter climes  By painful steps arriv'd his home his friends  His offspring left to lavish on the shrine  Of some farhonour'd saint his costly stores  Inverts his footstep sickens at the sight  Of the barr'd fane and silent sheds his tear  The wretch whose hope by stern Oppression chas'd  From ev'ry earthly bliss still as it saw  Triumphant wrong took wing and flew to heav'n  And rested there now mourn'd his refuge lost  And wonted peace The sacred fane was barr'd  And the lone altar where the mourners throng'd  To supplicate remission smok'd no more  While the green weed luxuriant round uprose  Some from their deathbed whose delirious faith  Thro' ev'ry stage of life to Rome's decrees  Obsequious humbly hop'd to die in peace  Now saw the ghastly king approach begirt  In tenfold terrors now expiring heard  The last loud clarion sound and Heav'n's decree  With unremitting vengeance bar the skies  Nor light the grief by Superstition weigh'd  That their dishonour'd corse shut from the verge  Of hallow'd earth or tutelary fane  Must sleep with brutes their vassals on the field  Unneath some path in marle unexorcis'd  No solemn bell extort a neighbour's tear  No tongue of priest pronounce their soul secure  Nor fondest friend assure their peace obtain'd  The priest alas so boundless was the ill  He like the flock he pillag'd pin'd forlorn  The vivid vermeil fled his fady cheek  And his big paunch distended with the spoils  Of half his flock emaciate groan'd beneath  Superior pride and mightier lust of pow'r  'Twas now Rome's fondest friend whose meagre hand  Told to the midnight lamp his holy beads  With nice precision felt the deeper wound  As his gull'd soul rever'd the conclave more  Whom did the ruin spare for wealth for pow'r  Birth honour

John return'd  And breath'd defiance loud Alas too soon  Allegiance sick'ning saw its sov'reign yield  An angry prey to scruples not his own  The loyal soldier girt around with strength  Who stole from mirth and wine his blooming years  And seiz'd the fauchion resolute to guard  His sovereign's right impalsy'd at the news  Finds the firm bias of his soul revers'd  For foul desertion drops the lifted steel  And quits Fame's noble harvest to expire  The death of monks of surfeit and of sloth  At length fatigu'd with wrongs the servile king  Drain'd from his land its small remaining stores  To buy remission But could these obtain  No resolute in wrongs the priest obdur'd  Till crawling base to Rome's deputed slave  His fame his people and his crown he gave  Mean monarch slighted brav'd abhorr'd before  And now appeas'd by delegated sway  The wily pontiff scorns not to recall  His interdictions Now the sacred doors  Admit repentant multitudes prepar'd  To buy deceit admit obsequious tribes  Of satraps princes crawling to the shrine  Of sainted villany the pompous tomb  Dazzling with gems and gold or in a cloud  Of incense wreath'd amidst a drooping land  That sigh'd for bread

Iberian realm  Could boast no purer breast no sprightlier mind  No race more splendent and no form so fair  Such was the chance of war this peerless maid  In life's luxuriant bloom enrich'd the spoil  Of British victors vict'ry's noblest pride  She she alone amid the wailful train  Of captive maids assign'd to Henry's care  Lord of her life her fortune and her fame  He gen'rous youth with no

some dim fort by foreign rule restrain'd  Far from the haunts of men or eye of day  Sometimes to cheat her bosom of its cares  Her kind protector number'd o'er the toils  Himself had worn the frowns

lute he gave she not averse  Nor destitute of skill with willing hand  Call'd forth angelic strains the sacred debt  Of gratitude she said whose just commands  Still might her hand with equal pride obey  Nor to the melting sounds the nymph refus'd  Her vocal art harmonious as the strain  Of some imprison'd lark who daily cheer'd  By guardian cares repays them with a song  Nor droops nor deems sweet liberty resign'd  The song not artless had she fram'd to paint  Disastrous passion how by tyrant laws  Of idiot custom sway'd some softey'd fair  Lov'd only one nor dar'd that love reveal  How the soft anguish banish'd from her cheek  The damask rose fullblown a fever came  And from her bosom forc'd the plaintive tale  Then swift as light he sought the lovelorn maid  But vainly sought her torn by swifter fate  To join the tenants of the myrtle shade  Love's mournful victims on the plains below  Sometimes as Fancy spoke the pleasing task  She taught her artful needle to display  The various pride of spring then swift upsprung  Thickets of myrtle eglantine and rose  There might you see on gentle toils intent  A train of busy Loves some pluck the flow'r  Some twine the garland some

panted to convey  But fir'd in vain Ah what was his amaze  His fond distress when o'er her pallid face  Dejection reign'd and from her lifeless hand  Down dropt the myrtle's fair unfinish'd flow'r  Speechless she stood at length with accents faint  " Well may my native shore" she said "resound  " Thy monarch's praise and ere Elvira prove  " Of thine forgetful flow'rs shall cease to feel  " The fost'ring breeze and Nature change her laws"  And now the grateful edict wide alarm'd  The British host Around the smiling youths  Call'd to their native scenes with willing haste  Their fleet unmoor impatient of the love  That weds each bosom to its native soil  The patriot passion strong in ev'ry clime  How justly their who find no foreign sweets  To dissipate their loves or match their own  Not so Elvira she disastrous maid  Was doubly captive pow'r nor chance could loose  The subtle bands she lov'd her gen'rous foe  She where her Henry dwelt her Henry smil'd  Could term her native shore her native shore  By him deserted some unfriendly strand  Strange bleak forlorn a desert waste and wild  The fleet careen'd the wind propitious fill'd  The swelling sails the glitt'ring transports wav'd  Their pennants gay and halcyons' azure wing  With flight auspicious skimm'd the placid main  On her lone couch in tears Elvira lay  And chid th' officious wind the tempting sea  And wish'd a storm as merciless as tore  Her lab'ring bosom Fondly now she strove  To banish passion now the vassal days  The captive moments that so smoothly past  By many an art recall'd now from her lute  With trembling fingers call'd the fav'rite sounds  Which Henry deign'd to praise and now essay'd  With mimic chains of silken fillets wove  To paint her captive state if any fraud  Might to her love the pleasing scenes prolong  And with the dear idea feast the soul  But now the chief return'd prepar'd to launch  On Ocean's willing breast and bid adieu  To his fair pris'ner She soon as she heard  His hated errand now no more conceal'd  The raging flame but with a spreading blush  And rising sigh the latent pang disclos'd  " Yes gen'rous youth I see thy bosom glow  " With virtuous transport that the task is thine  " To solve my chains and to my weeping friends  " And ev'ry longing relative restore  " A softey'd maid a mild offenceless prey  " But know my Soldier never youthful mind  " Torn from the lavish joys of wild expense  " By him he loath'd and in a dungeon bound  " To languish out his bloom could match the pains  " This illstarr'd freedom gives my tortur'd mind  " What call I freedom is it that these limbs  " From rigid bolts secure may wander far  " From him I love Alas ere I may boast  " That sacred blessing some superior pow'r  " To mortal kings to sublunary thrones  " Must loose my passion must unchain my soul  " Ev'n that I loathe all liberty I loathe  " But most the joyless privilege to gaze  " With cold indiff'rence where desert is love  " True I was born an alien to those eyes  " I ask alone to please my fortune's crime  " And ah this flatter'd form by dress endear'd  " To Spanish eyes by dress may thine offend  " Whilst I illfated maid ordain'd to strive  " With custom's load beneath its weight expire  " Yet Henry's beauties knew in foreign garb  " To vanquish me his form howe'er disguis'd  " To me were fatal no fantastic robe  " That e'er Caprice invented Custom wore  " Or Folly smil'd on could eclipse thy charms  " Perhaps by birth decreed by Fortune plac'd  " Thy country's foe Elvira's warmest plea  " Seems but the subtler accent fraud inspires  " My tend'rest glances but the specious flow'rs  " That shade the viper while she plots her wound  " And can the trembling candidate of love  " Awake thy fears and can a female breast  " By ties of grateful duty bound ensnare  " Is there no brighter mien no softer smile  " For Love to wear to dark Deceit unknown  " Heav'n search my soul and if thro' all its cells  " Lurk the pernicious drop of pois'nous guile  " Full on my senceless head its phial'd wrath  " May Fate exhaust and for my happiest hour  " Exalt the vengeance I prepare for thee  " Ah me nor Henry's nor his country's foe  " On thee I gaz'd and Reason soon dispell'd  " Dim Error's gloom and to thy favour'd isle  " Assign'd its total merit unrestrain'd  " Oh lovely region to the candid eye  " 'Twas there my fancy saw the Virtues dwell  " The Loves the Graces play and bless'd the soil  " That nurtur'd thee for sure the Virtues form'd  " Thy gen'rous breast the Loves the Graces plann'd  " Thy shapely limbs Relation birth essay'd  " Their partial pow'r in vain again I gaz'd  " And Albion's isle appear'd amidst a tract  " Of savage wastes the darling of the skies  " And thou by Nature form'd by Fate assign'd  " To paint the genius of thy native shore  " 'Tis true with flow'rs with many a dazzling scene  " Of burnish'd plants to lure a female eye  " Iberia glows but ah the genial sun  " That gilds the lemon's fruit or scents the flow'r  " On Spanish minds a nation's nobler boast  " Beams forth ungentle influences There  " Sits Jealousy enthron'd and at each ray  " Exultant lights his slowconsuming fires  " Not such thy charming region long before  " My sweet experience taught me to decide  " Of English worth the sound had pleas'd mine ear  " Is there that savage coast that rude sojourn  " Stranger to British worth the worth which forms  " The kindest friends the most tremendous foes  " First best supports of liberty and love  " No let subjected India while she throws  " O'er Spanish deeds the veil your praise resound  " Long as I heard or ere in story read  " Of English fame my bias'd partial breast  " Wish'd them success and happiest she I cry'd  " Of women happiest she who shares the love  " The fame the virtues of an English lord  " And now what shall I say Bless'd be the hour  " Your fairbuilt vessels touch'd th' Iberian shores  " Bless'd did I say the time if I may bless  " That lov'd event let Henry's smiles declare  " Our hearts and cities won will Henry's youth  " Forego its nobler conquest will he slight  " The soft endearments of the lovelier spoil  " And yet Iberia's sons with ev'ry vow  " Of lasting faith have sworn these humble charms  " Were not excell'd the source of all their pains  " And love her just desert who sues for love  " But sues to thee while natives sigh in vain  " Perhaps in Henry's eye for vulgar minds  " Dissent from his it spreads an hateful stain  " On honest Fame amid his train to bear  " A female friend Then learn my gentle youth  " Not Love himself with all the pointed pains  " That store his quiver shall seduce my soul  " From honour's laws Elvira once deny'd  " A consort's name more swift than lightning flies  " When elements discordant vex the sky  " Shall blushing from the form she loves retire  " Yet if the specious wish the vulgar voice  " Has titled Prudence sways a soul like thine  " In gems or gold what proud Iberian dame  " Eclipses me Nor paint the dreary storms  " Or hairbreadth 'scapes that haunt the boundless  " And force from tender eyes the silent tear  " When Mem'ry to the pensive maid suggests deep  " In full contrast the safe domestic scene  " For these resign'd Beyond the frantic rage  " Of conqu'ring heroes brave the female mind  " When steel'd by love in Love's most horrid way  " Beholds not danger or beholding scorns  " Heav'n take my life but let it crown my love"  She ceas'd and ere his words her fate decreed  Impatient watch'd the language of his eye  There Pity dwelt and from its tender sphere  Sent looks of love and faithless hopes inspir'd  " Forgive me gen'rous maid" the youth return'd  " If by thy accents charm'd thus long I bore  " To let such sweetness plead alas in vain  " Thy virtue merits more than crowns can yield  " Of solid bliss or happiest love bestow  " But ere from native shores I plough'd the main  " To one dear maid by virtue and by charms  " Alone endear'd my plighted vows I gave  " To guard my faith whatever chance should wait  " My warring sword if conquest fame and spoil  " Grac'd my return before her feet to pour  " The glitt'ring treasure and the laurel wreath  " Enjoying conquest then and fame and spoil  " If Fortune frown'd adverse and Death forbade  " The blissful union with my latest breath  " To dwell on Medway's and Maria's name  " This ardent vow deeprooted from my soul  " No dangers tore this vow my bosom fir'd  " To conquer danger and the spoil enjoy  " Her shall I leave with fair events elate  " Who crown'd mine humblest fortune with her love  " Her shall I leave who now perchance alone  " Climbs the proud cliff and chides my slow return  " And shall that vessel whose approaching sails  " Shall swell her breast with ecstasies convey  " Death to her hopes and anguish to her soul  " No may the deep my villain corse devour  " If all the wealth Iberian mines conceal  " If all the charms Iberian maids disclose  " If thine Elvira thine uniting all  " Thus far prevailnor can thy virtuous breast  " Demand what honour faith and love denies"  " Oh happy she" rejoin'd the pensive maid  " Who shares thy fame thy virtue and thy love  " And be she happy thy distinguish'd choice  " Declares her worth and vindicates her claim  " Farewell my luckless hopes my flatt'ring dreams  " Of rapt'rous days my guilty suit farewell  " Yet fond howe'er my plea or deep the wound  " That waits my fame let not the random shaft  " Of Censure pieree with me th' Iberian dames  " They love with caution and with happier stars  " And oh by pity mov'd restrain the taunts  " Of levity nor brand Elvira's flame  " By merit rais'd by gratitude approv'd  " By hope confirm'd with artless truth reveal'd  " Let let me say but for one matchle  s maid  " Of happier birth with mutual ardour crown'd  " These radiant gems which burnish Happiness  " But mock Misfortune to thy fav'rite's hand  " With care convey and well may such adorn  " Her cheerful front who finds in thee alone  " The source of ev'ry transport but disgrace  " My pensive breast which doom'd to lasting woe  " In thee the source of ev'ry bliss resign  " And now farewell thou darling youth the gem  " Of English merit Peace content and joy  " And tender hopes and young desires farewell  " Attend ye smiling Train this gallant mind  " Back to his native shores there sweetly smooth  " His ev'ning pillow dance around his groves  " And where he treads with vi'lets paint his way  " But leave Elvira leave her now no more  " Your frail companion in the sacred cells  " Of some lone cloister let me shroud my shame  " There to the matin bell obsequious pour  " My constant orisons The wanton Loves  " And gay Desires shall spy the glimm'ring tow'rs  " And wing their flight aloof but rest confirm'd  " That never shall Elvira's tongue conclude  " Her shortest pray'r ere Henry's dear success  " The warmest accent of her zeal employ"  Thus spoke the weeping fair whose artless mind  Impartial scorn'd to model her esteem  By native customs dress and face and air  And manners less nor yet resolv'd in vain  He bound by prior love the solemn vow  Giv'n and receiv'd to soft compassion gave  A tender tear then with that kind adieu  Esteem could warrant weary'd Heav'n with pray'rs  To shield that tender breast he left forlorn  He ceas'd and to the cloister's pensive scene  Elvira shap'd her solitary way  THE SCHOOLMISTRESS IN IMITATION OF SPENSER  Auditae voces vagitus et ingens  Infantumque animae flentes in limine primo  VIRG  IMITATION  And mingled sounds and infant plaints we hear  That pierce the entrance shrill and wound the tender ear  Advertisement  What particulars in Spenser were imagined most proper for the Author's imitation on this occasion are his language his simplicity his manner of description and a peculiar tenderness of sentiment remarkable throughout his works  I  AH me full sorely is my heart forlorn  To think how modest worth neglected lies  While partial Fame doth with her blasts adorn  Such deeds alone as pride and pomp disguise  Deeds of ill sort and mischievous emprize  Lend me thy clarion Goddess let me try  To sound the praise of Merit ere it dies  Such as I oft' have chaunced to espy  Lost in the dreary shades of dull obscurity  II  In ev'ry village mark'd with little spire  Embow'r'd in trees and hardly known to fame  There dwells in lowly shed and mean attire  A matron old whom we Schoolmistress name  Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame  They grieven sore in piteous durance pent  Aw'd by the pow'r of this relentless dame  And ofttimes on vagaries idly bent  For unkempt hair or task unconn'd are sorely shent  III  And all in sight doth rise a birchen tree  Which Learning near her little dome did stowe  Whilom a twig of small regard to see  Tho' now so wide its waving branches flow  And work the simple vassals mickle woe  For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew  But their limbs shudder'd and their pulse beat low  And as they look'd they found their horror grew  And shap'd it into rods and tingled at the view  IV  So have I seen who has not may conceive  A lifeless phantom near a garden plac'd  So doth it wanton birds of peace bereave  Of sport of song of pleasure of repast  They start they stare they wheel they look aghast  Sad servitude such comfortless annoy  May no bold Briton's riper age e'er taste  N  superstition clog his dance of joy  N  vision empty vain his native bliss destroy  V  Near to this dome is found a patch so green  On which the tribe their gambols do display  And at the door impris'ning board is seen  Lest weakly wights of smaller size should stray  Eager perdie to bask in sunny day  The noises intermix'd which thence resound  Do Learning's little tenement betray  Where sits the dame disguis'd in look profound  And eyes her Fairy throng and turns her wheel around  VI  Her cap far whiter than the driven snowe  Emblem right meet of decency does yield  Her apron dy'd in grain as blue I trowe  As is the harebell that adorns the field  And in her hand for scepter she does wield  Tway birchen sprays with anxious fear entwin'd  With dark distrust and sad repentance fill'd  And stedfast hate and sharp affliction join'd  And fury uncontroul'd and chastisement unkind  VII  Few but have kenn'd in semblance meet pourtray'd  The childish faces of old Aeol's train  Libs Notus Auster  The southwest wind south c c  these in frowns array'd  How then would fare or earth or sky or main  Were the stern god to give his slaves the rein  And were not she rebellious breasts to quell  And were not she her statutes to maintain  The cot no more I ween were deem'd the cell  Where comely Peace of Mind and decent Order dwell  VIII  A russet stole was o'er her shoulders thrown  A russet kirtle fenc'd the nipping air  'Twas simple russet but it was her own  'Twas her own country bred the flock so fair  'Twas her own labour did the fleece prepare  And sooth to say her pupils rang'd around  Thro' pious awe did term it passing rare  For they in gaping wonderment abound  And think no doubt she been the greatest wight on ground  IX  Albeit ne flatt'ry did corrupt her truth  Ne pompous title did debauch her ear  Goody goodwoman gossip n'aunt forsooth  Or dame the sole additions she did hear  Yet these she challeng'd these she held right dear  Ne would esteem him act as mought behove  Who should not honour'd eld with these revere  For never title yet so mean could prove  But there was eke a mind which did that title love  X  One ancient hen she took delight to feed  The plodding pattern of the busy dame  Which ever and anon impell'd by need  Into her school begirt with chickens came  Such favour did her past deportment claim  And if neglect had lavish'd on the ground  Fragment of bread she would collect the same  For well she knew and quaintly could expound  What sin it were to waste the smallest crumb she found  XI  Herbs too she knew and well of each could speak  That in her garden sipp'd the silv'ry dew  Where no vain flow'r disclos'd a gaudy streak  But herbs for use and physic not a few  Of gray renown within those borders grew  The tufted basil punprovoking thyme  Fresh baum and marygold of cheerful hue  The lowly gill that never dares to climb  And more I fain would sing disdaining here to rhyme  XII  Yet euphrasy may not be left unsung  That gives dim eyes to wander leagues around  And pungent radish biting infant's tongue  And plantain ribb'd that heals the reaper's wound  And marj'ram sweet in shepherd's posie found  And lavender whose spikes of azure bloom  Shall be erewhile in arid bundles bound  To lurk amidst the labours of her loom  And crown her kerchiefs clean with mickle rare perfume  XIII  And here tri  rosemarine that whilom crown'd  The daintiest garden of the proudest peer  Ere driv'n from its envy'd site it found  A sacred shelter for its branches here  Where edg'd with gold its glitt'ring skirts appear  Oh wassel days O customs meet and well  Ere this was banish'd from its lofty sphere  Simplicity then sought this humble cell  Nor ever would she more with thane and lordling dwell  XIV  Here oft' the dame on Sabbath's decent eve  Hymned such psalms as Sternhold forth did mete  If winter 'twere she to her hearth did cleave  But in her garden found a summerseat  Sweet melody to hear her then repeat  How Israel's sons beneath a foreign king  While taunting foemen did a song entreat  All for the nonce untuning ev'ry string  Uphung their useless lyressmall heart had they to sing  XV  For she was just and friend to virtuous lore  And pass'd much time in truly virtuous deed  And in those elfins' ears would oft' deplore  The times when Truth by Popish rage did bleed  And tortious death was true Devotion's meed  And simple Faith in iron chains did mourn  That nould on wooden image place her creed  And lawny saints in smould'ring flames did burn  Ah dearest Lord forefend thilk days should e'er return  XVI  In elbow chair like that of Scottish stem  By the sharp tooth of cank'ring Eld defac'd  In which when he receives his diadem  Our sov'reign prince and liefest liege is plac'd  The matron sate and some with rank she grac'd  The source of children's and of courtier's pride  Redress'd affronts for vile affronts there pass'd  And warn'd them not the fretful to deride  But love each other dear whatever them betide  XVII  Right well she knew each temper to descry  To thwart the proud and the submiss to raise  Some with vile copper prize exalt on high  And some entice with pittance small of praise  And other some with baleful sprig she 'frays  Ev'n absent she the reins of pow'r doth hold  While with quaint arts the giddy crowd she sways  Forewarn'd if little bird their pranks behold  'Twill whisper in her ear and all the scene unfold  XVIII  Lo now with state she utters the command  Eftsoons the urchins to their tasks repair  Their books of stature small they take in hand  Which with pellucid horn secured are  To save from finger wet the letters fair  The work so gay that on their back is seen  St George's high atchievements does declare  On which thilk wight that has ygazing been  Kens the forthcoming rod unpleasing sight I ween  XIX  Ah luckless he and born beneath the beam  Of evil star it irks me whilst I write  As erst the bard  Spenser  by Mulla's silver stream  Oft' as he told of deadly dolorous plight  Sigh'd as he sung and did in tears indite  For brandishing the rod she doth begin  To loose the brogues the stripling's late delight  And down they drop appears his dainty skin  Fair as the furry coat of whitest ermilin  XX  O ruthful scene when from a nook obscure  His little sister doth his peril see  All playful as she sate she grows demure  She finds full soon her wonted spirits flee  She meditates a pray'r to set him free  Nor gentle pardon could this dame deny  If gentle pardon could with dames agree  To her sad grief that swells in either eye  And wrings her so that all for pity she could die  XXI  No longer can she now her shrieks command  And hardly she forbears thro' awful fear  To rushen forth and with presumptuous hand  To stay harsh justice in its mid career  On thee she calls on thee her parent dear  Ah too remote to ward the shameful blow  She sees no kind domestic visage near  And soon a flood of tears begins to flow  And gives a loose at last to unavailing woe  XXII  But ah what pen his piteous plight may trace  Or what device his loud laments explain  The form uncouth of his disguised face  The pallid hue that dyes his looks amain  The plenteous show'r that does his cheek distain  When he in abject wise implores the dame  Ne hopeth aught of sweet reprieve to gain  Or when from high she levels well her aim  And thro' the thatch his cries each falling stroke proclaim  XXIII  The other tribe aghast with sore dismay  Attend and conn their tasks with mickle care  By turns astony'd ev'ry twig survey  And from their fellows' hateful wounds beware  Knowing I wist how each the same may share  Till fear has taught them a performance meet  And to the wellknown chest the dame repair  Whence oft' with sugar'd cates she doth 'em greet  And gingerbread yrare now certes doubly sweet  XXIV  See to their seats they hye with merry glee  And in beseemly order sitten there  All but the wight of bum ygalled he  Abhorreth bench and stool and fourm and chair  This hand in mouth yfix'd that rends his hair  And eke with snubs prosound and heaving breast  Convulsions intermitting does declare  His grievous wrong his dame's unjust behest  And scorns her offer'd love and shuns to be caress'd  XXV  His face besprent with liquid crystal shines  His blooming face that seems a purple flow'r  Which low to earth its drooping head declines  All smear'd and sully'd by a vernal show'r  O the hard bosoms of despotic Pow'r  All all but she the author of his shame  All all but she regret this mournful hour  Yet hence the youth and hence the flow'r shall claim  If so I deem aright transcending worth and fame  XXVI  Behind some door in melancholy thought  Mindless of food he dreary caitiff pines  Ne for his fellows' joyaunce careth aught  But to the wind all merriment resigns  And deems it shame if he to peace inclines  And many a sullen look askaunce is sent  Which for his dame's annoyance he designs  And still the more to pleasure him she's bent  The more doth he perverse her 'haviour past resent  XXVII  Ah me how much I fear lest pride it be  But if that pride it be which thus inspires  Beware ye dames with nice discernment see  Ye quench not too the sparks of nobler fires  Ah better far than all the Muses' lyres  All coward arts is valour's gen'rous heat  The firm fixt breast which fit and right requires  Like Vernon's patriot soul more justly great  Than craft that pimps for ill or flow'ry false deceit  XXVIII  Yet nurs'd with skill what dazzling fruits appear  Ev'n now sagacious foresight points to show  A little bench of heedless bishops here  And there a chancellour in embryo  Or bard sublime if bard may e'er be so  As Milton Shakespeare names that ne'er shall die  Tho' now he crawl along the ground so low  Nor weeting how the Muse should soar on high  Wisheth poor starv'lling elf his paper kite may fly  XXIX  And this perhaps who cens'ring the design  Low lays the house which that of cards doth build  Shall Dennis be if rigid Fates incline  And many an epic to his rage shall yield  And many a poet quit th'Aonian field  And sour'd by age profound he shall appear  As he who now with 'sdainful fury thrill'd  Surveys mine work and levels many a sneer  And furls his wrinkly front and cries "What stuff is here"  XXX  But now Dan Phoebus gains the middle skie  And Liberty unbars her prisondoor  And like a rushing torrent out they fly  And now the grassy cirque han cover'd o'er  With boist'rous revelrout and wild uproar  A thousand ways in wanton rings they run  Heav'n shield their shortliv'd pastimes I implore  For well may freedom erst so dearly won  Appear to British elf more gladsome than the sun  XXXI  Enjoy poor imps enjoy your sportive trade  And chase gay flies and cull the fairest flow'rs  For when my bones in grassgreen sods are laid  For never may ye taste more careless hours  In knightly castles or in ladies bow'rs  O vain to seek delight in earthly thing  But most in courts where proud Ambition tow'rs  Deluded wight who weens fair peace can spring  Beneath the pompous dome of kesar or of king  XXXII  See in each sprite some various bent appear  These rudely carol most incondite lay  Those saunt'ring on the green with jocund leer  Salute the stranger passing on his way  Some builden fragile tenements of clay  Some to the standing lake their courses bend  With pebbles smooth at duck and drake to play  Thilk to the huxter's sav'ry cottage tend  In pastry kings and queens th' allotted mite to spend  XXXIII  Here as each season yields a different store  Each season's stores in order ranged been  Apples with cabbagenet ycover'd o'er  Galling full sore th' unmoney'd wight are seen  And gooseb'rie clad in liv'ry red or green  And here of lovely dye the Cath'rine pear  Fine pear as lovely for thy juice I ween  O may no wight e'er pennyless come there  Lest smit with ardent love he pine with hopeless care  XXXIV  See cherries here ere cherries yet abound  With thread so white in tempting posies ty'd  Scatt'ring like blooming maid their glances round  With pamper'd look draw little eyes aside  And must be bought tho' penury betide  The plum all azure and the nut all brown  And here each season do those cakes abide  Whose honour'd names th' inventive city own  Rend'ring thro' Britain's isle Salopia's praises known  Shrewsbury cakes    XXXV  Admir'd Salopia that with venial pride  Eyes her bright form in Severn's ambient wave  Fam'd for her loyal cares in perils try'd  Her daughters lovely and her striplings brave  Ah midst the rest may flowers adorn his grave  Whose art did first these dulcet cates display  A motive fair to Learning's imps he gave  Who cheerless o'er her darkling region stray  Till Reason's morn arise and light them on their way  CONTENTS  ODES c  ODE to Health Page  To a Lady of Quality fitting up
