   YE TrueBorn  Englishmen  proceed  Our trifling Crimes detect  Let the Poor starve Religion bleed  The  Dutch  be damn'd the  French  succeed  And all by your Neglect    Your actions all the World disgust  The  French  are only glad  Your friends your honesty distrust  And while you think you're wise and just  The Nation thinks you mad    Are these the ways your wisdom take  To raise our reputation  To quarrel at a few mistakes  Whilst  France  their own advantage makes  And Laughs at all the Nation    You are the People who of old  The Nations Troops disbanded  And now you should your Friends uphold  Your Friends and you are bought and sold  As always was intended    There's none but Fools in time to come  Will Trust the  English  Nation  For if they do they know their doome  That we'l be falling out at home  And baulk their Expectation    You are the Nations grand defence  Against Illegal power  And yet against both Law and Sence  And sometimes too without pretence  You send folk to the  Tower    Some Lords your anger have incurr'd  For Treaty of Partition  But if you'l take the Nations word  Most People think it was absurd  And empty of discretion    if that Treaty as 'tis fam'd  Gave part of  Spain  to  Gaul  Why should those Gentlemen be blam'd  When you your selves are not  To let them take it all    Bribes and ill practices you found  And some few felt your power  But soon you run your selves aground  For had you push'd the matter round  You all had gone to th'  Tower    Some Reformation hath from you  In vain been long expected  But when you shou'd the business do  Your private quarrels you pursue  And th' Nation lies neglelcted    Long has the Kingdom born the weight  Of your deficient Funds  That Parliamentary publique cheat  Pray where's the difference of that  And Plundering with Dragoons    Are you the People that complain  Of Arbitrary Power  Then shew the Nation if you can  Where Kings have been since Kings began  Such Tyrants as you are    When Kings with right and Law dispence  And set up Power despotick  It has been counted Law and sence  To take up Arms against our Prince  And call in aids Exotick    But you although your Powers depend  On every Plowman's Vote  Beyond the Law that Power extend  To ruine those you should defend  And sell the Power you bought    The King Religion did Commend  To you his  LawExplainors  We know not what you may intend  Nor how you should Religion mend  Unless you will your Manners    You are the Nations darling Sons  The abstract of our Mobb  For City Knights and Wealthy Clowns  Stock Jobbers Statesmen and Buffoons  You may defye the Globe    Toland  insults the Holy Ghost  Brib'd  Sr  bribes accuses  Good Manners and Religion's lost  The King who was your Lord of Host  The Raskal  Hw  abuses    Your Statesman  Glle  with intent  To Cultivate with care  The dignity of Parliament  Plyes closely at the Dancing tent  And manages  May  Fair    The TrueBorn Heroes diligence  For publique good appears  There he refines his Wit and Sense  That the next day in our defence  May fill Committee Chairs    The limitation of the Crown  Is your Immediate care  If your  Wise Articles  go down  Your Power will be so Lawless grown  'Tis no matter who's the Heir    Did we for this depose our Prince  And Liberty assume  That you should with our Laws dispense  Commit Mankind without Offence  And Govern in his room    You shou'd find out some other word  To give the Crowns  Accepter  To call him King wou'd be absurd  For tho' he'l seem to wear the Sword  'Tis You have got the Scepter    And now your wrath is smoaking hot  Against the  Kent  Petition  No man alive can tell for what  But telling Truths which pleas'd you not  And taxing your Discretion    If you those Gentlemen detain  By your unbounded Power  'Tis hop'd you'l never more complain  Of Bishops in King  James  's Reign  Sent blindly to the  Tower    A strange Memorial too there came  Your Members to affront  Which told you Truths you dare not name  And so the Paper scap'd the Flame  Or else it had been burnt    Some said the Language was severe  And into Passion flew  Some too began to curse and swear  And call'd the Author  Mutineere  But all men said 'Twas True    But oh the Consternation now  In which you all appear  'Tis plain from whence your terrours flew  For had your guilt been less you knew  So would have been your fear    In Fifteen Articles you're told  You have our Rights betray'd  Banter'd the Nation bought and sold  The Liberties you shou'd uphold  No wonder you're afraid    And now to make your selves appear  The more Impertinent  A wise Address you do prepare  To have his Majesty take care  Rebellion  to prevent    No doubt his Majesty will please  To take your Cause in hand  Besides the work is done with ease  Full  Seven Thousand Men  he has  The Nation to defend    One hundred Thousand Heroes more  Do our Train'd Bands compose  If foraign Forces shou'd come or're  Plant them and you upon the Shoar  How bravely you'l oppose    Then blush ye Senators to see  How all men stand dismay'd  The Nation shou'd so patient be  To bear with all your Villany  And see themselves betray'd    It was our Freedom to defend  That  We the People  chose you  And  We the People  do pretend  Our power of Choosing may extend  To punish and depose you    For since in vain our Hopes and Fears  Petitions too are vain  No Remedy but this appears  To pull the House about your Ears  And send you home again    These are the Nations Discontents  The Causes are too true  The Ploughman now his Choice repents  For tho he values Parliaments  He's out of Love with  You    When to be chose with Caps in hand  You courted every Voice  You were our Servants at command  By which it seems you understand  Untill we made our Choice    If that be True we let you know  Upon that very score  You'd best your present Hours bestow  In all the Mischiefs you can do  For We'l ne're choose you more  FINIS
