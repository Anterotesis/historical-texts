Qualifications appear with a Lustre most beautiful and distinguishing  IF I had a Talent at Panegyrick I should never desire a better Opportunity to exert it since all who have the Happiness of Your Acquaintance would unanimously join in the largest Encomiums that the richest Fancy raised by the noblest Subject could incessantly produce  IN an Age wherein many who affect to be thought Persons of uncommon Wit and peculiar Penetration take an unnatural Pleasure in ridiculing the Sacred Mysteries and despising the pure Doctrines of our Holy Religion You have accounted it an Honour to be devoted to officiate in Divine Services and consecrated in a solemn Manner to Almighty God those shining Parts and  Accomplishments which could not probably have failed of advancing You to some glittering Station which the modish and unthinking Part of Mankind would infinitely have preferred to the Exercise of the Ministerial Function  TO attempt a Display of Your Compassion and Affability were as unnecessary as the  Philosopher  's reading a Lecture of  Warlike Discipline  in the Presence of  HANNIBAL  so very diffusive so delightfully conspicuous have they flowed that Multitudes have been

Gentleman    THAT well known Generosity and Hospitality which never fail of giving the most pleasing Air to the whole of Your Conversation will doubtless incline You kindly to receive a Guest who is  likely to be the more agreeable by the Humanity of his Disposition and the evident Similitude of Manners and Inclinations  I am    SIR  Your most Obliged and Most Obedient Servant THOMAS FOXTON  NewYear'sDay  THE CHARACTER OF A Fine GENTLEMAN  _THERE is nothing reflects a darker Shade on all the Glories Earth can boast of than the serious Consideration of their transitory Nature How do their richest Beauties fade as the Colours of a Rainbow And vanish like the gaudy Images of a deluding Vision The sweetest Pleasures which charm Mankind that warble so agreeably on the Senses and surprizingly captivate the Imagination glide away in a Moment and are often succeeded by the most melancholy Sentiments Such an easy Transition is there from the Mirth of a Festival to the Gloom of a Funeral that we cannot but admire the Wisdom  of those Antients who mingled the Emblems of Mortality with the brightest and gayest Scenes of Nature and thought the glowing Crimson of a Rose and the Virgin Whiteness of the Lilly less ornamental to their Gardens than the awful Monuments and venerable Urns of their departed Ancestors All Conditions of Life are open to the Strokes of Fortune whose violent and unrelenting Storms will rend alike the Hermitage the Cottage and the Palace Tho' the greater part of Mankind delight in Mirth and flee from Sorrow as from the Horrors of a Midnight Apparition yet it frequently overtakes them and often pierces the very Soul of the dullest Peasant of the most airy Wit of the most consummate Politician Dishonour and Grief have many times soiled the Royal Purple and stained the triumphant Lustre of Imperial Ensigns What Favourite of Nature what Darling of Fortune can then promise himself with Security a long Continuance of Felicity Had young  Philindus  well attended to such Thoughts as these had not his ungoverned Fancy raised imaginary Scenes and drest them in fairy Beauties his Disappointment would not have been so great nor the Tide of his Sorrows so considerable and impetuous Indeed when first he began to converse with the World and make a publick Appearance 'twas with so much advantage that perhaps a more solid Genius than his would have  promised himself not a little Happiness from such an agreeable Prospect The Comeliness of his Person the Sweetness of his Temper the Brightness of his Parts and the Lustre of his Fortune conspire to distinguish him as a Person born for some noble End in whose future Behaviour one might hope distinctly to trace the Christian the Patriot and the Gentleman yet alas this blooming Youth enchanted with the Musick of the  Syrens  and seduced by Flattery and Voluptuousness lost his Innocence his Friends and his Fortune After which he would often take a solitary Walk round the neighbouring Fields and there lament like  Eve  when she left her Nuptial Bower and surveyed with streaming Eyes the departing Beauties of  Eden  One Morning in particular he rose very early and being full of Meditations and intensely pursuing a long Train of Thought he wandered much farther than usual whilst the Verdure of the Fields and the Musick of the Woods entertained his Senses in the most agreeable manner Thus roved the unfortunate  Philindus  till the Heat of the Sun obliged him to stop at a little Grove in the most retired part of which he found a pretty Arbour and there he sat down to rest him At that instant he was oppressed with a Torrent of Grief and the unhappy Youth cry'd out in the greatest Agony of Spirit  "Assist me most merciful Redeemer and send some tender  GuardianAngel to support my fainting Spirits and help an Imagination which bleeds a fresh at every momentary Reflection Oh the fatal Errors of my past Life Were I Master of the  Eastern  Magnificence or Lord of the Stars I would with Transport resign all for the happy Opportunity of correcting them but the Months that are gone are fled for ever"  He had proceeded in his Soliloquy had not he been hindered by the Approach of a young Clergyman who was coming to that Arbour which he almost daily visited It is a common Observation that when Persons of Learning and Politeness meet together though Strangers to each other they soon fall into an easy graceful and familiar Air and converse in some measure like intimate Acquaintance This was the Case before us The Clergyman after some little time began in an obliging manner to enquire what Adventure had brought him thither  "For  says he  I do not remember to have seen any here before except those who came from our Family and no wonder since there is no common Path lies any way near it"  Philindus  told him  "It was his Custom to walk round the Fields and there sooth a melancholy Softness incident to him that he had wander'd far beyond his usual Limits and at last by Accident found out that Place of Ease and Refreshment"  "The Chaplain for such it seems he was gave him to understand  "That he lived about a Mile off in the House of a great Gentleman  And then added with a Sigh  Our Family has this Morning met with the sharpest Affliction imaginable in the Death of that inestimable Person O dear  Serino  how dismal is the Sound of thy Death to every distressed Neighbour Whilst each Person laments as though he had lost the Darling of his Hopes and Family and the Women were preparing their Firstborn for the Funeral Even this delightful Retirement has now lost its Beauty and I find 'twas his endearing Conversation and reviving Presence that gave the Grove its richest Charms How many thousand Eyes will then overflow with Tears when he shall be carried to his Grave whose Bounty and Compassion have rescued many from it However he will be laid to Rest with Honour and his unstained Ashes shrined in immortal Urns whose Gold no Rust can canker not Malice nor Envy itself did once attempt to defame him living much less will they offer to violate his peaceful Marble"  Here he paused and  Philindus  desired he would be pleased to favour him with some Account of that Gentleman whose Virtues were so conspicuous  "Indeed  continu'd he  I have heard of many noble Actions of the brave  Serino  but since you had the Honour and Happiness to be intimate with him I may reasonably expect something more entertaining and particular And since we are thus by Accident met together I should be very glad to spend some time in free and serious Converse which may perhaps prove of more advantage to us than if we had indulged ourselves in melancholy and solitary Meditations which I perceive is what we both proposed at our walking out And for my part I cannot but think the many tedious Steps I have this Morning taken sufficiently recompensed by my meeting in this Place a Gentleman whose Aspect and obliging Address promise so much agreeable Entertainment"  The Chaplain reply'd  "That nothing could be more grateful to him than such a Proposal"  And then immediately began after this manner to give an Account of  Serino    AS Religion is certainly the chief Concern and greatest Ornament of Mankind which adds fresh Lustre to the Jewels of a Crown and adorns with a new Grace the noblest Scepters 'twas always  Serino  's Opinion That the sincere Practice of it did much more recommend a Gentleman to the Esteem of his Contemporaries than the most stately Buildings the most delicious Gardens or the most shining Equipage  As well knowing and considering that all this Pomp and Beauty would soon be lost in Silence and Obscurity whilst Vertue reserves for her Votaries Rewards which are unknown and eternal Indeed of late Years some who would be thought Men of uncommon Parts and set up for Wits of the first Rank are of a quite different Opinion and whilst they are industriously propagating their Atheistical Notions make no Scruple of bantering the most aweful Mysteries of Religion But He always thought there was so much Absurdity and Contradiction in their impious Schemes as was sufficient to hinder any wise Man from embracing them I believe I shall never forget those Conferences which I have had with him on this weighty Subject the Substance of which I shall be very ready to impart to You provided you will be so free as sometimes to relieve me by intermingling such Observations as shall appear most natural and proper  Philindus  I shall be very glad if I can say any thing which may deserve to be joined to the refined Thoughts of  Serino  or even with your own agreeable Sentiments Therefore pray Sir go on  Chaplain  His Reasonings upon this Head were after this manner That there is a Supreme Being of infinite Perfection and Glory is a Notion which the Mind of every Man is apt to assent to as soon as 'tis proposed And some  Great Men  Cicero  in particular carry the Matter much farther and represent this Notion of a God as an innate Idea which is Born with us and interwoven with our Constitution Now that such an Almighty Being does really exist is evident from divers Considerations As  st  From natural Effects which are observable by every Man  The Heavens  says the Royal Psalmist  declare the Glory of God and the Firmament sheweth his Handywork Day unto Day uttereth Speech and Night unto Night sheweth Knowledge There is no Speech nor Language where their Voice is not heard their Sound is gone out into all Lands and their Words unto the Ends of the World    The Polite and Judicious Mr  Addison  has obliged us with a curious Ode on these sublime Thoughts of King  David  I'm confident you will not think it loss of time to hear it repeated  I  The spacious Firmament on high  With all the blue Ethereal Sky  And spangled Heavens a shining Frame  Their great Original proclaim  Th' unweary'd Sun from Day to Day  Does his Creator's Power display  And publishes to every Land  The Work of an Almighty Hand  II  Soon as the Evening Shades prevail  The Moon takes up the wond'rous Tale  And Nightly to the list'ning Earth  Repeats the Story of her Birth  Whilst all the Stars that round Her burn  And all the Planets in their turn  Confirm the Tidings as they roll  And spread the Truth from Pole to Pole  III  What tho' in solemn Silence all  Move round the dark Terrestrial Ball  What tho' no real Voice nor Sound  Amidst their radiant Orbs be found  In Reason's Ear they all rejoice  And utter forth a glorious Voice  For ever Singing as they Shine  The Hand that made us is Divine  How exactly is the Sun placed at such a due Distance from the Earth that he may by just Degrees give his Heat both by Sea and Land For suppose it in a remoter Place of the Aether how exquisite a Scene of Desolation had our Globe been and unsufferable Winter had defaced its blooming Charms We could have had then no gentle Zephyrs rich with the Spoils of balmy Flowers but must have been oppressed with piercing Tempests and buried under Pyramids  of Snow On the other hand had it been nearer his fiery Beams would have burnt up every Beauty of Nature and made this World an universal sandy Desart How wonderful are the Motions of other heavenly Bodies How clear an Argument of stupendous Art and perfect Prudence if we descend from the Skies where so many thousand Gems glister round the Azure Ring of Heaven and take a serious View of the Earth which is to us the most observable Part of the Universe We shall there find the clearest Demonstrations of Almighty Goodness Wisdom and Power This is very well represented by the admirable Dr  Barrow  in his  Exposition of the Creed    "That this Earth was designed for the Accommodation of living Creatures which are upon it and principally of Man we cannot be ignorant or doubtful if we be not so negligent or stupid as to let pass unobserved those innumerable Signs and Arguments that shew it If we look upon the Frame of the Animals themselves what a Number of admirable Contrivances in each of them do appear for the Sustenance for the Safety for the Pleasure for the Propagation for Grace and Ornament for all imaginable Convenience suitable to the Kind and Station of each If we look about them what Variety and Abundance of convenient Provisions offer themselves even to a careless View answerable  to all their Needs and all their Desires wholesome and pleasant Food to maintain their Lives yea to gratify all their Senses fit Shelter from Offence and safe Refuge from Danger All these Things provided in sufficient Plenty and commodiously disposed for such a vast Number of Creatures not the least most silly weak or contemptible Creature but we may see some Care has been had for its Nourishment and Comfort What wonderful Instincts are they endued with for procuring and distinguishing their Food for guarding themselves and their Young from Danger But for Man especially a most liberal Provision has been made to supply all his Needs to please all his Appetites to exercise with Profit and Satisfaction all his Faculties to content I might say his utmost Curiosity  Neque enim Necessitatibus tantummodo nostris provisum est usque in delicias amatur  says  Seneca  All Things about him do minister or may do so if he will use the natural Powers and Instruments given him to his Preservation Ease and Delight The Bowels of the Earth yield him Treasures of Metals and Minerals Quarries of Stone and Coals serviceable to him for various Uses The vilest and commonest Stones he treadeth upon are not unprofitable The Surface of the Earth what Variety of delicate Fruits Herbs and Grains doth it  afford to nourish our Bodies and chear our Spirits to please our Tastes and remedy our Diseases How many fragrant Flowers most beautiful and goodly in Colour and Shape for the Comfort of our Smell and Delight of our Eyes Neither can our Ears complain since every Wood has a Choir of natural Musicians to entertain them with their sprightful Melody Every Wood did I say yes too the Woods adorned with stately Trees yield pleasant Spectacles to our Sight shelter from Offences of Weather and Sun Fewel for our Fires Materials for our Buildings our Houses and Shipping and other needful Utensils Even the barren Mountains send us down fresh Streams of Water so necessary for the Support of our Lives so profitable for the Fructification of our Grounds so commodious for Conveyance and maintaining of Intercourse among us Even the wide Seas themselves serve us many ways they are commodious for our Traffick and Commerce they supply the Bottles of Heaven with Water to refresh the Earth they are inexhaustable Cisterns from whence our Springs and Rivers are derived they yield Stores of good Fish and other Conveniencies of Life The very rude and disorderly Winds do us no little Service in brushing and cleansing the Air for our Health in driving forward our Ships in scattering  and spreading about the Clouds those Clouds which drop Fatness on our Grounds As for our Subjects the Animals 'tis not possible to reckon the manifold Utilities we receive from them how many Ways they supply our Needs with pleasant Food and convenient Clothing how they ease our Labour and how they promote even our Sport and Recreation And are we not only very stupid but very ungrateful if we do not discern abundance of Wisdom and Goodness in the contrivance and ordering of all these Things so as thus to conspire for our Good Is it not reasonable that we devoutly cry out with the Psalmist  O Lord how manifold are thy Works In Wisdom hast thou made them all the Earth is full of thy Riches So is the wide and great Sea The Eyes of all wait upon thee and thou givest them their Meat in due Season    "  Philind  Pray Sir before you proceed give me leave to mention one grand Objection which is brought in behalf of Infidelity and that is this That we can have no Idea of God and therefore can have no Evidence of his Existence And some atheistical Persons argue after this manner The Notion of a Deity which is commonly entertain'd is nothing but a Bundle of Incomprehensibles Inconceivables and Impossibles it being only a Compilement of all imaginable Attributes of Honour Courtship and Compliment which the confounded Fear  and Astonishment of Men's Minds make them huddle up together without any Sense or Philosophical Truth This seems to be intimated by a modern Writer in these Words  "The Attributes of God signify not true nor false nor any Opinion of our Brain but the Reverence and Devotion of our Hearts and therefore they are not sufficient Premises to infer Truth or convince Falshood"  And the same Thing again is farther set out with no small Pretence to Wit after this manner They that venture to dispute philosophically or reason of God's Nature from these Attributes of Honour losing their Understanding in the very first Attempt fall from one Inconvenience into another without End and without Number in the same manner as when one ignorant of the Ceremonies of the Court coming into the Presence of a greater Person than he is used to speak to and stumbling at his Entrance to save himself from falling lets slip his Cloak to recover his Cloak lets fall his Hat and with one Disorder after another discovers his Astonishment and Rusticity  Chapl  To affirm that there is no Idea of God is all one as to affirm that there is no Conception of the Mind answering to that Word or Name And indeed the modern Atheists stick not to maintain That the Word GOD has no Signification and that there is no other Idea or Conception in Men's Minds  answering thereunto besides the mere Phantasm of the Sound And since as the learned Dr  Cudworth  observes there are different Words for GOD in several Languages and Men have the same Notion or Conception in their Minds answering to them all it must needs be granted that they have some other Idea or Conception belonging to those Words besides the Phantasms of their several Sounds And indeed it can be nothing else but either monstrous Sottishness and Stupidity of Mind or else prodigious Impudence in these Atheists to deny that there is any Idea of God at all in the Minds of Men or that the Word hath any Signification But whatever these Atheists deny in Words it is notwithstanding evident that even themselves have an Idea or Conception in their Minds answering to the Word GOD when they deny his Existence because otherwise they would deny the Existence of nothing And then as to his being absolutely perfect and of infinite Power the PaganTheists did acknowledge it as might be proved from vast Numbers of Passages in their Writings Thus  Virgil    At Pater Anchises Oculos ad Sydera laetus  Extulit Coelo palmas cum Voce tetendit  Jupiter Omnipotens Precibus si flecteris ullis  Philind  This seems very natural as does also your last Inference from the Beauty and Harmony  of the Universe and yet so very unreasonable are the Atheists that they will not allow even of this but find fault with the Creation and pretend to spy out many considerable Defects in the Frame of Nature and Constitution of the Heavens For instance the Disposition of the Equator and Ecliptick intersecting each other in an Angle of twentythree Degrees and upwards whereby as they say the terrestrial Globe is rendered much more uninhabitable than otherwise it might be Again they remark that Part of the Earth lies deformed and inhospitable either by burning Heat or freezing Cold they likewise take notice of the Variety of those savage Beasts which terrify Mankind and thence with  Lucretius  conclude that these Things are not under the Conduct of a wise and merciful Being  Chapl  As to their Notion of the Equator it is built upon a false Supposition of the Antients That the Torrid Zone or all between the Tropicks was utterly uninhabitable by reason of the Extremity of the Heat and it is certain that there is nothing which doth more demonstrate a Providence than this very thing it being the most convenient Site or Disposition that could be devised as will appear if the Inconveniences of other Dispositions be considered especially these three If the Axis of these Circles should be parallel and their Plaries coincident If they should intersect each  other in right Angles And which is a Middle betwixt both if they should cut one another in an Angle of fortyfive Degrees for it is evident that each of these Dispositions would be attended with far greater Inconveniences to the terrestrial Inhabitants in respect of the Length of Days and Nights Heat and Cold And that these two Circles should continue thus to keep the same angular Intersection when physical and mechanical Causes would bring them still nearer together this is a farther Evidence of a Providence also And then as to the savage Animals as we are assured by Revelation that they were not originally noxious to Mankind but became so by Sin so even now they are of some Use and Service to them  Philind  Let us Sir if you please proceed to some farther Arguments in Defence of this great Truth  Chapl  That there is a God is proved by the general Consent of Mankind concerning it by that  Testimonium  as  Lactantius  speaks  Populorum atque Gentium in una hac re non dissidentium    "That unanimous Testimony of all People and Nations not disagreeing in this only Point"  If the Authority of some particular Men agreeing in Vote of one City of one Nation doth pass for an Argument and shews the Thing probable how can we decline or contemn the common Suffrage of Mankind Another Argument of God's Existence which gave great  Satisfaction to  Serino  is drawn from the Discoveries of a Divine Power in Works that cannot be ascribed to any other Cause visible or natural such are the Prediction of future Events especially such as are contingent and depend upon Man's free Choice curing the Sick of great chronical Distempers without any medicinal Applications restoring Limbs to Persons maimed Sight to the Blind and raising the Dead to Life a thing which  Pliny  deemed impossible to God himself To this Head belong those Opinions and Testimonies of Mankind concerning Apparitions Inchantments and Consederacy with bad Spirits  Phil  As to the general Opinion of Mankind the Atheist would make us believe that this Apprehension of a God doth spring from an infinite Jealousy in the Mind of Man and an endless Fear of the worst that may happen according to that divine Saying of the Poet which he can never sufficiently admire  Primus in orbe DEOS fecit TIMOR  FEAR first made GODS  So that it is granted on both Sides that the Fear of a Deity doth universally possess the Minds of Men  "Now the Question is says the learned Archbishop  Tillotson  whether it be more likely that the Existence of a God should be the  Cause of this Fear or that this Fear should be the Cause why Men imagine there is a God If there be a God who hath impressed this Image of himself upon the Mind of Man there is great reason why all Men should stand in awe of him but if there be no God it is not easy to conceive how Fear should create an universal Confidence and Assurance in Men that there is one For whence should this Fear come It must be either from without from the Suggestion of others who first tell us there is such a Being and then our Fear believes it or else it must arise from within from the Nature of Man which is apt to fancy dreadful and terrible Things If from the Suggestions of others who tell us so the Question returns Who told them so And will never be satisfied till the first Author of this Report be found out But if it be said that this Fear ariseth from within from the Nature of Man which is apt to imagine dreadful Things this likewise is liable to inexplicable Difficulties For first the proper Object of Fear is something that is dreadful that is something that threatens Men with Harm or Danger and that in God must be either Power or Justice and such an Object as this Fear indeed may create but Goodness and Mercy are essential to the Notion of a God as well as Power and Justice Now  how should Fear put Men upon fancying a Being that is infinitely good and merciful"  Indeed as that great Prelate just now mentioned observes if a Man had Arguments sufficient to persuade him that there is no God as there is infinite Reason to the contrary yet the Belief of a God is so necessary to the Comfort and Happiness of our Lives that a wise Man could not but be heartily troubled to quit so pleasant an Error and to part with a Delusion which is apt to yield such an unspeakable Satisfaction to the Mind of Man Did Men but consider the true Notion of God he would appear to be so lovely a Being and so full of Goodness and all desirable Perfections that even those very Persons who are of such irregular Understandings as not to believe there is a God yet could not if they understood themselves refrain from wishing with all their Hearts that there were one For is it not really desirable to every Man that there should be such a Being in the World as takes care of the Frame of it that it do not run into Confusion and in that Disorder ruin Mankind That there should be such a Being as takes particular care of every one of us and loves us and delights to do us good as understands all our Wants and is able and willing to relieve us in our greatest Straits when nothing else can to preserve us in our greatest Dangers to assist us against our worst Enemies and to comfort us under  our sharpest Sufferings when all other Things set themselves against us  Chapl  It is really so very plain and evident that I shall go farther on this Subject after having taken notice that the  Epicurean  Account of the Original of the World as expressed by  Lucretius  is most intolerably romantic and ridiculous for how is it any Ways possible that Chance should make this great Volume of the World which can never produce the least Book How long might a Man be in sprinkling Colours upon Canvass with a careless Hand before they would happen to make the exact Picture of a Man And is a Man easier made by Chance than his Picture  Phil  I think there is one considerable Objection of the Atheists which as yet we have not touched upon I should therefore be glad if you would a little consider it before we dismiss this Subject  Chapl  Pray what is that  Phil  The seeming Confusion of Human Affairs That all Things fall alike to all the Innocent and the Guilty the Pious and the Impious the Religious and the Profane Nay that many times the worser Causes and Men prevail against the better as is intimated in that Passage of  Lucan  tho' in the Person of a Theist  Victrix Causa Diis placuit sed Victa Catoni  And that the Unjust and Ungodly often flourish in the greatest Prosperity whilst the innocent and devout Worshippers of the Deity all their Lives long struggle with Adversity Whereas were there a God and Providence as they conceive profane and irreligious Persons would be presently thunderstruck from Heaven or otherwise made remarkable Objects of divine Vengeance as also the Pious miraculously protected and rescued from Evils and Harms  Chapl  It must indeed be granted that this Consideration hath too much puzzled and staggered weak Minds in all Ages  "Because Sentence against an evil Work is not executed speedily therefore is the Heart of the Sons of Men fully set in them to do Evil"  And the Psalmist himself was sometimes much perplexed with this  Phenomenon  the Prosperity of the Ungodly who set their Mouths against Heaven and whose Tongue walketh thro' the Earth So that he was tempted to think  "He had cleansed his Heart in vain and washed his Hands in Innocency"  Till at length entring into the Sanctuary of God his Mind became illuminated and his Soul fixed in a firm Trust and Confidence upon divine Providence  Whom  says he  have I in Heaven but thee  c  My Flesh and my Heart faileth but God is the Strength of my Heart and my Portion for ever  For as some will be apt from hence to infer  that there is no God but that blind Chance and Fortune steer all  The Fool hath said in his Heart there is no God  so will others conclude that tho' there be a God yet he either does not know Things done here below  How does God know and is there Knowledge in the most High  or else will not so far humble himself or disturb his own Ease and Quiet as to concern himself in our low human Affairs First of all therefore we here say that it is altogether unreasonable to require that divine Providence should miraculously interpose upon every Turn in punishing the Ungodly and preserving the Pious and thus perpetually interrupt the Course of Nature which would look but like a Botch or Bungle and a violent Business but rather carry Things on in a still and silent Path and shew his Art and Skill in making Things of themselves fairly unwind and clear up at last into a satisfactory Close Passion and SelfInterest are blind or shortsighted but that which steers the whole World is no fond pettish impatient and passionate Thing but an impartial disinterested and uncaptivated Nature Nevertheless it is certain that sometimes we have not wanted Instances in Cases extraordinary of a  God appearing as it were miraculously upon the Stage and manifesting himself in taking immediate Vengeance upon notorious Malefactors or delivering his faithful Servants from imminent Dangers or  Evils threatned as the same is often done also by a secret and undiscerned Overruling of the Things of Nature But it must be granted that it is not always thus but the Periods of divine Providence here in this World are commonly longer and the Evolutions thereof slower which proceeds not from Slackness and Remissness in the Deity but either from his Patience and Longsuffering being willing that Men should repent or else to teach us Patience by his Example They therefore who because Judgment is not presently executed upon the Ungodly blame the Management of Things as faulty and Providence as defective are like such Spectators of a Dramatic Poem as when wicked and injurious Persons are brought upon the Stage for a while swaggering and triumphing impatiently cry out against the Dramatist and presently condemn the Plot Whereas if they would but expect the winding up of Things and stay till the last Clap they should then see them come off with sufficient Shame and Punishment  Phil  It is indeed most absurd for such weak and ignorant Creatures as Mortals are to presume to pronounce rashly of the Divine Government But pray Sir go on in your Account of  Serino  's Sentiments as to Religion  Chapl  He thought it no less evident that we ought to worship this God and to pay him our most solemn Adoration The Beauties of  Nature so warm'd the Breasts of the Heathens that in those Groves where they had so oft enjoy'd the soft Delights of the refreshing Breeze and the flowery Shade there they perform'd religious Rites and each retired Grotto became a sacred Temple Now it  s very natural to conceive that Almighty God should make some Discovery of his Will to his Creatures by remarkable and distinct Revelations and not permit the devout Soul whom the Glories of the Creation has raised to a sacred Extasy to offer up his Sacrifice to an unknown Deity Is it not absurd to suppose that the King of Heaven should give to Men his Subjects no certain Rule for their Conduct of Life but leave every one to act according to what he imagines most agreeable to the Laws of Nature and Honour Uncertain Guides into what various and opposite Paths do you lead your wandering Followers Whilst one Man thinks that Action natural and honourable which another perhaps of more Wisdom reckons base and unnatural from such an uncertain Sound who can prepare himself to the Battle  Phil  And yet the Deists insist upon it That Reason alone is an unerring Guide in Matters of Religion and sufficient to make us happy which say they is as much as we need desire About which Mr  Clifford  thus expresses himself  "Being resolv'd according to the  Duty of every private Person to make a Search into the Nature and Quality of my Religion and according to my Interest in Human Society to communicate the Effects of that Search to others if I shall believe it profitable for them I am in the first place to consider of the Choice of some Guide for so long and dangerous a Journey where I shall sometimes meet with no Track or Path at all and sometimes with so many and those so contrary in the Appearance of their first Entry that the Variety will confound me more than the Want especially there being so many Mists cast before me by the Errors and Deceits of others that one had great need of a better Eyesight than is left us by the Fall of our first Forefather And this Consideration after a long and serious Debate thereof brings no other Guide to me but my own Reason which if it take such Directions as it ought and may do before it sets forth and pursue those Directions with Care and Constancy tho' it may possibly lead me into Errors yet will bring me at last even through them to the proposed End of my Journey which is Happiness"  Chapl  Notwithstanding what these Gentlemen assert it is certain that natural Religion without revealed is not sufficient because it wants Clearness and Authority especially concerning  those two great Articles of Forgiveness of Sins and a Future State  Phil  As to these Points I remember Mr  Blount  the great Champion of the Deists in his  Oracles of Reason  makes these brief Observations  "Whatsoever is adorable amiable and imitable by Mankind is in one Supreme Infinite and perfect Being who is to be worshiped not by an Image Sacrifice or Mediator but by an inviolable Adherence in our Lives to all the Things  by an Imitation of God in all his imitable Perfections and believing magnificently of it"  And then he goes on speaking of a Future State  "A Man that is endued with the same Virtues we have beforemention'd need not fear to trust his Soul with God after Death for  st  no Creature could be made with a malevolent Intent the first Good who is also the first Principle of all Beings hath but one Affection or Property and that is Love which was long before there was any such thing as Sin  dly  At Death he gives to God one and the same Being who in his own Nature for the Sins of the Penitent hath as well an Inclination to Pity as Justice and there is nothing dreadful in the whole Nature of God but his Justice no Attribute else being terrible  dly  Infinite Power is ever safe and needs not Revenge for SelfPreservation    thly  However  verisimile est similem Deo a Deo non negligi  "  Chapl  After they have said all they can natural Religion without revealed is not a solid Foundation of Happiness besides there never was any Age or Nation in the World when or where such a pure natural Religion as they talk of without any manner of rituous Worship was ever practised I know not what secret Histories these Gentlemen may have of the Golden Age but as for us dull Believers we can't see one word in all the ancient Books we meet withal that gives us the least Hint of such a naked natural Religion as you speak of If we have Recourse to the Poets to whom we are beholden for all that is known of these Golden Ages when these brave Men lived they make Religion as ritual as it is now and altogether as full of Sacrifices and Revelations Nay the Account we have of the Goddess  Astraea  which is a principal Part of the poetical History of the Golden Age is that she was a  Numen  sent from Heaven to converse with Men on Earth to inspire them with Justice and Sobriety and to teach them Vertue and a good Life Which Fable is but an antient Tradition of the Frequency of God's conversing with holy Men in the first Ages of the World Neither do we see any of the antient poetical Heroes your  Hercules  's and  Pollux  's your brave NaturalReligion Men but they frequent  Sacrifices as much as other People as we see by the Examples of  Priam Æ²lysses Achilles  and  Aeneas  of  Cadmus Perseus Theseus  and all the  Argonauts  in  Apollonius  and other Poets So that we cannot but conclude that the Story which the Deists tell us of the antient Universality of pure Natural Religion is all philosophical Romance and never had any Being but in the Brains of the Gentlemen of their Persuasion and those of some SystemMakers and Preachers of late drawn from the scatter'd Sayings and Books of Philosophers  Phil  If Natural Religion then proves so insufficient we must consult Revealed which I suppose was practised by  Serino    Chapl  Undoubtedly Concerning which Method  Serino  would express himself after this Manner  "The next thing which a considering Man has to do after he has discover'd the Insufficiency of Reason without Revelation to make a Man happy is to enquire into the Nature of those Religions that lay claim to a divine Authority If we take a steddy View of the  Pagan  Scheme we shall find it so overrun with Ignorance Barbarity and monstrous Fiction that any Person of tolerable Parts might soon draw a better and more rational Plan in which there is little tending to the Reverence of God or the good of Man to the promoting Virtue and Goodness in Human Conversation to the  breeding Love and Goodwill in Men towards one another Their Worship that of the supreme Lord being neglected is directed towards Objects most improper and unbecoming to the Ghosts of dead Men Men in their Lives if we may trust the Reports of their devoutest Adorers famous for nothing so much as for vicious Enormities for Thefts and Rapine for Murders and Parricides for horrid Lusts and Adulteries Rapes and Incests And such Persons alive or dead what wise and good Man would not rather loath than worship and respect If we consult the  Alcoran  of  Mahomet  that notorious Antichrist and vile Impostor we shall reap but little Benefit from a silly Rhapsody of Lewdness and Cruelty Indeed  Mahometism  in respect to its Age and the Port it bears in the World demands some Consideration for to speak in the Words of a great Man of our Church it hath continued a long Time and hath vastly overspread the Earth Neither is it more formidable in its Looks than peremptory in its Words vaunting itself to be a compleat general and ultimate Declaration of God  s Pleasure cancelling all those that have gone before But examining both the Substance and Circumstances thereof considering the Quality of the Instruments by whom of the Times when it was introduced of the Places where  of the People who first or afterwards did receive it the Manner of its Rise Progress and Continuance as also the Matter it teaches we shall not find stampt on it the genuine Characters of a divine Original but have great Reason to deem it a Brood of most lewd and impudent Couzenage in Times of great Disturbance and Confusion when barbarous Nations like Torrents did overflow the World and turned all Things upside down in Times of general Corruption and Disorder in Men's Minds and Manners when even among Christians Ignorance and Superstition Dissension and Uncharitableness Impiety and Iniquity did greatly prevail In a very blind and obscure Corner of the Earth among a Crew of wild Thieves and Runagates such have those  Arabians  been always famed and known to be this Sect had its Birth and Fosterage among those fierce and savage Overrunners of the World it got its Growth and Stature Into this Sort of People being indeed in its Constitution well accommodated to that Humour and Genius it was partly insinuated by jugling Tricks and partly driven by seditious Violence the first Author hereof being a Person according to the Description given of him in their own Legends of no honest or honourable Qualities but having all the Marks of an Impostor rebellious and persidious inhuman and  cruel lewd and lascivious of a base Education of a fraudulent and turbulent Disposition of a vicious Life pretending to Enthusiasm and working of Wonders but these such as were in their Nature most absurd and incredible At such a Season and in such a Soil by such Means and by such a Person was this Religion first planted and afterwards carried on by the Sword Now that divine Wisdom should chuse those black and boisterous Times to publish his Will is as if the King should purposely order his Proclamations to be made in a tempestuous Night when no Man scarce dares to stir out nor could well see what was done or hear what was said much fitter surely to that Purpose were a serene and calm Day a Time of general Civility and Peace like that of  Augustus Caesar  That the Declaration of God's Mind should issue from the Desarts of  Arabia  that Den of Robbers is as if the King should cause his Edicts to be set up in the blindest and dirtiest Nook of the Suburbs the MarketCross surely or the Exchange the Place of most general and ordinary Concourse such as in respect to the World was the flourishing Empire of  Rome  were more convenient and wisely chosen for that purpose That passing over the more gentle and tractable Part of his People a Prince should send his Laws to a Rabble of  Banditti should pick out for his Messenger a most dissolute Varlet attended with a Crew of desperate Ruffians resolved to buffet and rifle all they met Were an odd Way of proceeding to communicate his Pleasure to the better and more orderly sort of his People such as were the Subjects of that wellgovern'd Empire by Persons of good Meaning mild Disposition and innocent Behaviour such as were the Apostles of our Lord in a quiet and gentle manner such as these only used would surely better become a wise Prince Thus even the exterior Circumstances of  Mahometism  are strong Presumptions against its Divinity but farther if we look into the Frame and Matter of it we shall find it a Mass of absurd Opinions odd Stories and uncouth Ceremonies compounded chiefly of the Dregs of Christian Heresy together with some Ingredients of  Judaism  and  Paganism  confusedly jumbled"  Such Considerations as these seem sufficient to demonstrate that Religion not to be of a divine Extraction  Phil  But then as to the  Jewish  Religion we must acknowledge it had its Birth from the Revelation and Appointment of God  Chapl  Its Truth and its Goodness we do not call in question but yet looking into it we shall find it in many Respects defective For  st  this Revelation was not general but peculiarly  intended for the Benefit of a small Nation  "He shewed his Word to  Jacob  his Statutes and his Judgments to  Israel  he hath not dealt so with any Nation and as for his Judgments they have not known them"  We may also observe that as the Laws and Rites of this Religion were design'd only for the People of  Israel  so they were only suited to their Inclinations and Capacities their Inclinations which were very stubborn and perverse their Capacities which were very low and gross as their own Prophets do upon many Occasions affirm and complain being repugnant to the common Humour and Genius of Mankind  dly  As it was particular so it was also partial as God did not by it speak his Mind to all so did he not therein speak out all his Mind Our Apostle to the  Hebrews  charges it with Blameableness  "If the first Covenant had been blameless  c  with Imperfection Weakness and Unprofitableness there is made an Abolition of the precedent Commandment for the Weakness and Unprofitableness thereof"  For the Law was nothing perfect neither does this lay any misbeseeming Imputation upon God the Author of that Religion for a Dawning of Light more became that Morning of Times than a Meridian Brightness  dly  It was not designed for perpetual Obligation and Use the Glory of that Institution is long since departed and the miserable  Jews  labour under the  Weight of the most dismal Curses They are now more outrageous Enemies to the Doctrine of the Cross than the blasphemous  Turk  or the barbarous  Pagan  In the Christian Religion that deserves the serious Regard of a considering Mind 'tis this alone appears most worthy of a God and by its radiant Appearance discovers itself to be celestial It would be endless to reckon up all the distinct Beauties that are so conspicuous in this venerable Institution I shall but just touch on some few which fully convinc'd  Serino  of its Certainty and Excellency First It gives us a lovely and clear Idea of our Creator and sets his infinite Perfections before us in a true and amiable Light the Benefit of which will be more evident to us if we consider into what wretched Notions the blinded  Pagans  were led for want of such a great Advantage Their Gods were represented as cruel indigent and lustful subject to the meanest Passions of Human Nature nay sometimes to the lowest Inclinations of Brutes What noble Objects of Adoration must here be What admirable Patterns of Sanctity and good Behaviour But Christians are taught from the holy Scriptures to believe that God is a Being of infinite Purity and Mercy A second great Excellency peculiar to the Christian Institution is this That it faithfully informs us concerning ourselves concerning our Nature our Original our End all our State past present  and final Points about which otherwise by no Reason no History no Experience we could be well resolved or satisfied It is also a peculiar Excellency of our Religion that it prescribes an accurate Rule of Life most congruous to Reason and suitable to our Nature it sets before us a living Copy and visible Standard of good Practice it frees us from a tedious Observance of numerous external Rites and superficial Formalities and builds our Duty upon most solid Grounds presses it with most valid Inducements draweth it from the best Principles and driveth it to the best End and farther which no other Law or Doctrine so much as pretends to provides sufficient Help and Ability to practise its Commandments In a word it alone can appease and satisfy a Man's Conscience breeding therein a wellgrounded Hope and a solid Comfort healing the Wounds of bitter Remorse and anxious Fear and so appears manifestly to be the true and direct Way to eternal Happiness It is observable also that the sacred Oracles furnish us with the most awful Descriptions of God's Power and Majesty quite different from that Tinsel Pageantry which so glitters in the Machines of the Heathen Poets How bright is the Colouring of the Royal Psalmist how lofty and refined his Diction when he celebrates the Honour of his God  Bless the Lord O my Soul O Lord my God thou art very great thou art cloathed with  Honour and Majesty who coverest thyself with Light as with a Garment who stretchest out the Heavens like a Curtain who layeth the Beams of his Chambers in the Waters who maketh the Clouds his Chariot who walketh upon the Wings of the Wind who maketh his Angels Spirits his Ministers a Flame of Fire  Psal civ  The Book of Psalms is full of such divine and magnificent Images as are also many of the Writings of the Prophets especially  Isaiah  who apparently excels the most celebrated of the  Grecian  or  Roman  Orators Many such Observations did the dear  Serino  make  Phil  I think these Heads of Argument very just and sufficient to give a solid and inward Satisfaction to every Man who will give himself leave seriously to attend the Consequences of them And if we add to these the numerous Miracles wrought in Confirmation of these Doctrines by our Saviour and his Apostles the wonderful and speedy Propagation of the Gospel under seemingly insuperable Difficulties the magnanimous Sufferings of the noble Army of Martyrs who when they were tortured would not accept of Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection the Fierceness of the raging Flames could not shock their Faith or remove their Constancy because they well knew that when our Saviour had  overcome the Sharpness of Death he opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers  If we consider all these things  we must own that none but Christians deserve the honourable Name of FreeThinkers and their dull Adversaries oppose these sublime Truths from a certain Narrowness of Mind Meanness of Thought and Contractedness of Soul that tamely submits to vulgar Prejudices and not being able to rise to the Contemplation of Eternal Joys dreads so vast an Idea as that of Immortality But pray proceed  Chapl  Serino  being thus fixed in the Principles of Religion resolved to act accordingly and not to omit any Duty out of compliment to the prevailing Humour of a degenerate Age And tho' now in great Families it is reckoned unfashionable to beg a Blessing upon our daily Bread he thought it proper to have Prayers read twice a Day in a little Chapel adjoining to his House at which all his menial Servants were obliged to be present He would by no means allow of the least Tincture of Profaneness in his Family yet being himself of a most gay and airy Temper he would in a particular manner encourage all innocent Mirth Diversion and Recreations  Phil  I have indeed observed that few things are more prejudicial to Religion than the too melancholy and rigid Deportment of some of its Votaries  Chapl  I have very good Reason to believe that a virtuous Course of Life has seldom in our Days been better recommended than by  the beautiful Example of  Serino  who was the real Friend and powerful Patron of the Orphan and Defenceless at his Gates You might daily see Crowds of indigent Persons or at least those who appeared so who were all supplied with a free and promiscuous Bounty for he did not relish those Maxims which tend to cut off any tho' the least Branch of Charity  "It may be would he often say many who come to my Gates for Relief are Cheats and Impostors What then Did I certainly know who these Wretches were that thus impose on Goodnature and Compassion the noblest Ornaments of Human Nature I surely would not throw any thing away upon them but as I do not I intend to give so long as 'tis in my Power to all that ask because to me they appear to be in Want And since Almighty God has been so very liberal to me I cannot but think it will be wellpleasing to Him to see me vigorously endeavouring to imitate his glorious Example"  Such in this Case were the Sentiments of  Serino  and I must confess to me they appear exceeding just and delicate And were Gentlemen but duly sensible of that refined and ravishing Pleasure which constantly attends Actions of true Beneficence they could not but perform them with more Frequency and Readiness How faint are the Delights of the most luxurious Entertainments How dull the Sentiments which spring from  surveying a vast Mass of Riches if compared with the permanent Joys that rise from the Reflection of our having brought a seasonable Relief to the distressed Unhappy  Serino  had various other Ways of exercising that Heroic Passion of universal Benevolence which ran so visibly thro' all his Actions and gave an inconceivable Grace to his whole Conversation He was the Founder of a large CharitySchool in a neighbouring Town and the chief Supporter of it besides he liberally contributed to the Maintenance of divers others He observed that among all the melancholy Symptoms of declining Piety it was very comfortable to a pious Mind to see one very eminent Sign of the Reverse that is the flourishing of CharitySchools in this Kingdom the Design of which is so very excellent that it cannot but be highly pleasing to the Divine Majesty and draw down many Blessings on the Place where they are encouraged  Phil  All good Christians must certainly highly approve of and to the utmost of their Power encourage those useful Nurseries of Learning and Piety which are of the greatest Service for forming the Minds and Manners of Youth and by which many poor Children have happily been rescued from Poverty Ignorance and Profaneness  Chapl  So intent was he on doing good that he used to give his Steward Orders to enquire  after poor HouseKeepers who had large Families or were disabled from Work by Sickness or any other Casualty To these he was liberal in such a manner as even sometimes gave them a Temptation to be glad at those Misfortunes which were the Occasion of their receiving such uncommon Supplies He used often to employ me and another Gentleman who attended on him in finding out such as were reduced from favourable Circumstances to great Necessity and fallen from the Hopes of a good Fortune and liberal Education to the unspeakable Sorrows of a melancholy Despondency Such Persons have many times been unexpectedly relieved by his Bounty which has quite changed the Scene and dressed the gloomy NightPiece in the softest Airs of the Morning  Phil  This Branch of Charity is not the least considerable in my Opinion For surely if we reflect on the sad Condition of those who are fallen from Plenty to Poverty and from a soft and easy Life exposed to all the Hardships of tempestuous Storms if we have Pity in our Breasts we cannot but drop a Tear at the Consideration of such piercing Misfortunes But I fear I shall by my Digressions hinder myself of hearing such a full Account of  Serino  as I desire  Chapl  Not at all Without those what a great Part of the Entertainment and Profit of our Converse must be lost and the Time  seem to move heavily But to go on So great was his Zeal for the Honour of God so warm his Passion for the Beauties of Holiness that he not only contributed largely towards the Rebuilding divers decayed Churches but also erected a most stately One in his own Parish upon which he would look with much more Pleasure than upon that antient and stately Structure in which he dwelt He has more than once expressed his Approbation of the Conduct of the  Romanists  in this Particular That they spare no Costs to adorn their Churches which however weak Minds may call a useless Pageantry yet seems very agreeable to those Notions which both Nature and Revelation give us of the Divine Majesty There is no Person of Distinction among us but is willing to have his House beautiful and stately nay Men of an inferior Rank will be at considerable Charges to render their Apartments neat and pleasant And does it then become us to think that Cost and Labour misemploy'd which is spent in adorning the Sacred Temples 'Tis true the primitive Christians sometimes worshiped God in Caves in Fields and the meanest Rooms you can imagine and I fear to better Purpose and with greater Ardour of Devotion than most Christians nowadays in magnificent Churches yet this was not of Choice but Necessity For let some Men think and say what they please the noble  Beauty and solemn Ornaments of a Temple serve to excite Reverence and raise Devotion though at the same time it must be confessed that sincere Worship performed in the poorest Place when no better can be obtained is as grateful to our Creator as the most tuneful Anthems that resound in gilded Roofs and lofty Arches  Phil  I have heard that  Serino  had one of the finest private Libraries in  England  and I cannot but imagine that a Gentleman of such peculiar Accomplishments must have had a more than ordinary Taste of the politer Parts of Learning and therefore should be very glad to hear something of his Fancy as to this Matter and who were his favourite Authors  Chapl  He had indeed a large and wellchosen Library filled with the best Writers on all Subjects there was his chief Delight and when he had been out a few Hours a Hunting or upon some other Diversion would return to his Study with the greatest Pleasure He was a very great Admirer of the antient Fathers and did by no Means approve of the Opinion of some modern Divines otherwise Men of good Judgment who set too light by those venerable Remains of pious Antiquity He seemed in a more particular manner to be delighted with the Writings of  Origen  and St  Chrysostom  tho' divers Authors very injuriously place the former in their Catalogues of  Hereticks yet he shines with distinguished Rays amongst the brightest of his Contemporaries As to the subtle Volumes of  Aquinas Scotus Durandus  and the rest of the Schoolmen he was no great Admirer of them yet thought the Study of them sometimes necessary He had with the utmost Care examined the Controversy between us and the Church of  Rome  and tho' he could not but admire the Learning and smart Turns of Cardinal  Bellarmin  and others of their ablest Champions yet he was so well assured of the Agreeableness of the Protestant Faith to the Holy Scriptures that there was no more Probability of his relinquishing it than of forsaking the first Principles of Natural Religion Since he always looked upon the former to be a direct Opposition to the Gospel both by its superstitious Doctrines and bloody Maxims about which he would sometimes thus express himself when speaking of the goodnatured Church of  Rome  "We cannot but take Notice of such a disagreeable Image where the Features are so very grim and its Garments deeper died with Blood than Paint where Human Gore hides all the softer Crimson A strange and monstrous Spectacle which at once appears gay and horrible glittering and terrifying dressed in the beauteous Smiles of an Angel their gilded Chapels their dazling Ornaments their solemn and pompous Processions  and cursed with the ghastly Snakes of a persecuting Fury No Person of common Humanity can hear of those Barbarities which the furious Bigots of  Rome  have committed without being shocked to the last Degree and feeling a fresh Pain at the Reflection on those Cruelties which were no more than Sport to the inhuman Actors But how contrary is this to the Christian Religion which is made up of Love and Sweetness As is evident from the Divine Anthem which the joyful Angels sung at our Redeemer's Incarnation  Glory be to God on High on Earth Peace Goodwill towards Men  "  Phil  Pray Sir what were  Serino  's Sentiments concerning  Socinus  and his Followers for if I don't Mistake I have heard him represented by some as a Favourer of the  Racovian  Divinity  Chapl  This shows what little Regard is due to flying Reports that are often dispersed without the least Foundation For as to  Socinus  's Notions concerning our blessed Lord's Divinity none could be a greater Adversary to them than  Serino  He has often lamented with the greatest Earnestness that a Person of such Learning Parts and Morality should make such desperate Essays to dethrone the Great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ who is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords He  wondered how he durst presume to represent him as a mere Man  Whose Goingsforth have been of Old from the Days of Eternity and by whom were all Things created that are in Heaven and that are in Earth Visible and Invisible whether they be Thrones or Dominions or Principalities or Powers  Col i  To him throughout the Sacred Writings the Ensigns divinely Royal are every where ascribed  When he brings his Firstbegotten into the World he saith  And let all the Angels of God worship him  And unto the Son he saith  Thy Throne O God is for ever  Heb i  Indeed he used to read some Part of  Socinus  's Works with great Pleasure wherein he defends the Liberty of the Will and the Doctrine of Universal Redemption and explodes the stoical and absurd Opinion of the rigid Predestinarians But in these Points  Socinus  agrees intirely with the Primitive Writers with the whole Body of the Remonstrants and even with the most celebrated Divines of our Church That he was conversant in the Works of  Crellius Volkelius  and others of that Clan was not with any Design to fall into their Scheme but only to furnish himself with some valuable Flowers that were dispersed among numerous Weeds I cannot say the same as to his Judgment of the  Remonstrants  for he seemed to go very much into their Scheme and used to declare that he thought them a Set of Christians whose professed  Doctrines were as agreeable to the Apostolical and Primitive Rules as any whatever and was particularly pleased with that charming Air of Meekness and Charity which usually adorns even their Polemical Writings He admired the Profoundness of  Arminius  the Sublimeness of  Episcopius  the Clearness of  Limborch  and the Modesty and Learning of  Curcellaeus  who were indeed among the foremost of his favourite Authors And well he might since even a  Tillotson  a  Scott  a  Sherlock  have not disdained in many Points to imitate their Manner of Thinking  Phil  In this I have the honour exactly to agree with  Serino  and have often perused the Writings of those Great Men you just now mentioned with inexpressible Satisfaction and once I remember Night came upon me unawares whilst I was reading a little posthumous Volume of  Curcellaeus  's in Answer to  Maresius    Chapl  I remember likewise he was wont to speak of the learned  Castalio  with great Respect and Pity that so worthy a Man should be exposed to so much Want and even expire amidst Neglect and Indigence but in this as  Serino  well observed he did but follow the Steps of his Great Lord and Master who had not where to lay his Head and left the World under Circumstances of Grief and Contempt Atheistical Wits very often complain of the Meanness of the Style of Holy Writ let them  read the Bible either in the Original or in  Castalio  's elegant Version and they cannot possibly without blushing mention any more such groundless Objections Another favourite Author of my dear Friend's was the admired  Grotius  He had also in his Library a compleat Set of  Calvin  's Works in which sometimes he would spend an Hour or two but those harsh Positions and unscriptural Assertions which he there frequently met with concerning God's Decrees made him only consult them occasionally and not with that Pleasure which otherwise he might have found in the Writings of a Divine who was very considerable in many other Respects He thought his Doctrine of absolute Reprobation wholly inconsistent with all the Attributes of God and labouring under monstrous Absurdities Is it possible that the God of infinite Mercy should resolve from all Eternity upon the Destruction of the far greater Part of Mankind and yet call upon them with the most moving Tenderness to accept of Happiness He that believes this Doctrine and yet scruples to admit the Doctrine of Transubstantiation may in some Sense be said to strain at a Knat and swallow a Camel for the latter absurd as it is yet is not loaded with those dismal Consequences as is that of the horrible Decree which like the Tail of a Dragon draws after it a long Train of Darkness and Terror Insomuch that Bishop  Latimer  in his Sermon on  Septuagesima  was so offended at such kind of Doctrines that he tells us according to his own Plainness and that of the Times  "That it is as needful to beware of such Reasonings and Expositions of the Scripture as it is to beware of the Devil himself"  And in his Sermon on the following d  Sunday  after  Trinity  he expressly asserts  "That Christ shed as much Blood for  Judas  as he did for  Peter  "  So that we see the Orthodox Doctrine of Universal Redemption was then taught in the Church of  England  by those who resisted unto Blood striving against the Corruptions of the Church of  Rome    Phil  Pray Sir who were his chief Favourites among our  English  Divines  Chapl  Bp  Taylor  Archbp  Tillotson  and Dr  Barrow  in whose Writings there appears a rich Variety of Divine Thoughts dressed in the beautiful Colours of a charming Diction Not but that he was frequent in the Perusal of all those Great Men of our Church who have obliged us with their Writings such as Bishop  Stilling fleet  Dr  Sherlock  the Author of  The Whole Duty of Man  c but I think the Three I mentioned were as it were his Daily Companions He was in constant Communion with the Church of  England  and thought it his Duty to comply with her Injunctions and thereby obey the lawful Commands of his Superiours  This Dr  Barrow  had taught him in his  Discourse of Obedience to our Spiritual Guides and Governours  where he thus speaks  "Consider Obedience what it is whence it springs and what it produceth each of these Respects will engage us to it It is in itself a thing very good and acceptable to God very just and equal very wise very comely and pleasant It cannot but be grateful to God who is the God of Love of Order and Peace to see Men do their Duty in the Respect perform'd to his own Ministers It is also a comely and amiable thing yielding much Grace procuring great Honour to the Church highly adorning and crediting Religion"  The whole Discourse deserves to be written in Letters of Gold but I shall repeat no more of it at present since I find the Time will not permit us to stay much longer  Phil  I cannot without Regret leave such agreeable Conversation but since it must be I should be very glad if you would please to favour me with a few more miscellaneous Hints concerning this worthy Gentleman  Chapl  I shall readily comply with your Request provided you will excuse my want of Connection and Regularity It was his Custom every Morning and Evening to sing a Divine Hymn accompanied not only with several fine Voices but also with the choicest Instruments  Particularly every Sunday Morning the following one of the Excellent Mr  Addison  was sung in his Family and the Harmony improved with the Musick of a curious Organ  I  When all thy Mercies O my God  My rising Soul surveys  Transported with the View I'm lost  In Wonder Love and Praise  II  O how shall Words with equal Warmth  The Gratitude declare  That glows within my ravish'd Heart  But thou canst read it there  III  Thy Providence my Life sustain'd  And all my Wants redrest  When in the silent Womb I lay  And hung upon the Breast  IV  To all my weak Complaints and Cries  Thy Mercy lent an Ear  E'er yet my feeble Thoughts had learnt  To form themselves in Prayer  V  Æ²nnumber'd Comforts to my Soul  Thy tender Care bestow'd  Before my Infant Heart conceiv'd  From whence these Comforts flow'd  VI  When in the slippery Paths of Youth  With heedless Steps I ran  Thine Arm unseen convey'd me safe  And led me up to Man  VII  Thro' hidden Dangers Toils and Death  It gently clear'd my Way  And thro' the pleasing Snares of Vice  More to be fear'd than they  VIII  When worn with Sickness oft hast Thou  With Health renew'd my Face  And when in Sins and Sorrows sunk  Reviv'd my Soul with Grace  IX  Thy bounteous Hand with worldly Bliss  Has made my Cup run o'er  And in a kind and faithful Friend  Hast doubled all my Store  X  Ten Thousand Thousand precious Gifts  My daily Thanks employ  Nor is the least a chearful Heart  That tastes those Gifts with Joy  XI  Thro' every Period of my Life  Thy Goodness I'll pursue  And after Death in distant Worlds  The glorious Theme renew  XII  When Nature fails and Day and Night  Divide thy Works no more  My evergrateful Heart O Lord  Thy Mercy shall adore  XIII  Thro' all Eternity to Thee  A joyful Song I'll raise  For O Eternity's too short  To utter all thy Praise  This Exercise he thought was exceeding refreshing to the Spirits and gave the Thoughts a very agreeable Turn He was indeed very fond of Musick and looked upon it to be in its highest Use when employed to celebrate the Praises of our Creator not but that sometimes he would be diverted with Compositions of another Nature and smile at the Beauties of a Moral Politick or Amorous Song He was so great an Admirer of Poetry even in his tenderest Years that I remember I have heard him say that when he was at the GrammarSchool he wrote out all  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  very fair so exceedingly was he delighted with it He would very often take it with him into the Fields and by reading it enjoy a pleasant Serenity something like that which the Grove of  Eden  afforded to its blissful Inhabitants He was much pleased with  Spenser  's  FairyQueen  notwithstanding the bestnatured Critick must own  it is too Allegorical yet the Variety of amusing Images that adorn his Writings cannot fail of delighting a Poetical Genius He always spake of Mr  Cowley  as a polite and fine Gentleman who seemed as well turned for an Orator as a Poet He thought Mr  Dryden  's Fables much the brightest of all his Performances tho' his Translation of  Virgil  is very Smooth and Musical and some of his Tragedies very Entertaining I shall leave this Head of Poetry when I have taken Notice that  Serino  amongst all other Divine Poems in which he was very much conversant approved of none more  Milton  excepted than Sir  Richard Blackmore  's  Creation  Mr  Watts's Horae Lyricae  and Dr  Young  's Poem on the  Last Day  It was remarkable in  Serino  that he was always so sensible of the Advantages of a Country Life above that in the Town that he would never stay there above a Month in the Year But when something extraordinary has called him from his beloved Seat he has made all imaginable haste to return and was of  Claudian  's Mind in the agreeable Description he has given us of the  old Man  of  Verona    Faelix qui propriis Aevum transegit in Arvis  c  Happy the Man who his whole Time doth bound  Within th' Enclosure of his little Ground  Happy the Man whom the same humble Place  Th' HereditaryCottage of his Race  From his first rising Infancy has known  And by Degrees sees gently bending down  With natural Propension to that Earth  Which both preserv'd his Life and gave him Birth  Him no false distant Lights by Fortune set  Could ever into foolish Wand'rings get  He never Dangers either saw or fear'd  The dreadful Storms at Sea he never heard  He never heard the shrill Alarms of War  Or the worse Noises of the Lawyer's Bar  No change of Consuls marks to him the Year  The change of Seasons is his Calendar  The Cold and Heat Winter and Summer shows  Autumn by Fruits and Spring by Flow'rs he knows  He measures Time by Landmarks and has found  For the whole Day the Dial of his Ground  A neighb'ring Wood born with himself he sees  And loves his old Contemporary Trees  H' has only heard of near  Verona  's Name  And knows it like the  Indies  but by Fame  Does with a like Concernment notice take  Of the RedSea and of  Benacus'  Lake  Thus Health and Strength he t'a third Age enjoys  And sees a long Posterity of Boys  About the spacious World let others roam  The VoyageLife is longest made at Home  Cowley  He would take Notice that the Country was so empty that a true  Englishman  could not look into it without a great deal of just Pity and Concern it being a very ungrateful Spectacle to see so many noble Houses mouldring into Ruin and dropping down for want of Inhabitants He has often wondered at some Gentlemen of  his Acquaintance who used almost to drown those laudable Qualities they were Masters of in Floods of Wine and spent a great deal of Time in excessive Drinking which Vice has very fatal Effects on the Mind of the Person who is devoted to it not to say that it also wastes his Body and dissipates his Fortune  "For as a polite Gentleman very well observes  See a  Spectator  of Mr  Addison  's  as to the Mind Drunkenness discovers every Flaw in it The sober Man by the Strength of Reason may keep under and subdue every Vice or Folly to which he is most inclined but Wine makes every latent Seed sprout up in the Soul and shew itself It gives Fury to the Passions and Force to those Objects which are apt to produce them When a young Fellow complained to an old Philosopher that his Wife was not handsome  "  Put less Water in your Wine  says the Philosopher  and you will quickly make her so    Wine heightens Indifference into Love Love into Jealousy and Jealousy into Madness it often turns the goodnatured Man into an Ideot and the Cholerick into an Assassin it gives Bitterness to Resentment it makes Vanity insupportable and displays every little Spot of the Soul in its utmost Deformity Nor does  this Vice only betray the hidden Faults of a Man and shew them in the most odious Colours but often occasions Faults to which he is not naturally subject There is more of Turn than of Truth in a Saying of  Seneca  That Drunkenness does not produce but discover Faults common Experience teaches us the contrary Wine throws a Man out of himself and infuses Qualities into the Mind which she is a Stranger to in her sober Moments The Person you converse with after the third Bottle is not the same Man who at first sat down at Table with you Upon this Maxim is founded a pretty Saying of  Publius Syrus    Qui ebrium ludificat laedit absentem  He who jests upon a Man who is drunk injures the Absent Thus does Drunkenness act in direct Contradiction to Reason whose Business it is to clear the Mind of every Vice which is crept into it and to guard it against all the Approaches of any that Endeavours to make its Entrance But besides these ill Effects which this Vice produces in the Person who is actually under its Dominion it has also a bad Influence on the Mind even in its sober Moments as it insensibly weakens the Understanding impairs the Memory and makes those Faults habitual which are produced by frequent Excesses"  Serino  was well aware of this and therefore strictly guarded  against all Excesses of this kind Another prevailing Vice of the Age which he kept at a Distance from and was extreamly uneasy when in any Company where it was practised was the modish Rant of Oaths and Imprecations it being an ungenteel Dialect as well as unchristian and clashes both with the Rules of Breeding and the Gospel The Folly of them is thus admirably described by a considerable Master of Learning and Language  "Custom indeed  says he  has made them fashionable but neither civil nor lawful for Vice can never plead Prescription I know it lies under the Protection of Numbers and Quality but ill Things have no Right to Sanctuary Because Vermin swarm must they be permitted to Increase Shall the Number of Felons plead for Pardon No no the Customariness of ill Things makes them worse and the more they must be discountenanced and taught Discipline In a word whatever jars with Religion and cuts upon good Breeding is below a Gentleman and therefore in spight of Example and Practice I must caution young Gentlemen against some Parts of  English  Civility for though they go for Consent in the  English  Dominions they will not bear the Test of other Nations For Example  Damn ye  says one  I am glad to see you  Is not this a quaint Salutation first to pack me away to Hell and  then protest he is glad to see me so conveniently lodged What Provision will these Blades make for their Enemies if they place their Friends so untowardly Certainly they fancy Hell is a fine Seat and that the Damned are in a fair Way of Promotion  Damn ye ye Dog how dost do  Cries another This feat Compliment implies Damnation and Transformation too it's a Compound of Curse and Raillery I am plunged into Hell dashed out of the List of Rationals and then with a Taunt asked how I do Why a Man in Fire and Brimstone is not altogether at his Ease and a reasonable Creature curst into a Dog not very fond of the Metamorphosis A third very ungenteelly accosts a Friend he has not perhaps seen of a Twelvemonth  Ye Son of a Whore where have you been  This is an  English  Address to a tittle it is a kind of Staple Commodity of the Nation and like our Wooll must not be transported under Pain of Confiscation But surely we need not lay so severe an Embargo on the Ware for 'tis ten to one 'twill never find vent in any other Nation on this Side of the  Canaries  a handful of Dirt well applied is as civil a Compliment though not quite so cleanly  Son of a Whore  There is Abundance of Freedom in the Expression but not a Grain of Breeding unless you measure Behaviour by the  Dialect of  Billingsgate  and the  BearGarden  Certainly these Gentlemen are Admirers of Charity why else do they dignify Whoredom For Whore stands for a Mark of Quality a distinguishing Character otherwise the Salutation would appear coarse and homely But by their leave few are in Love with Crossbars and to be Brother to a Byeblow is to be a Bastard once removed I know we fling a Veil on these Expressions and wash over their Foulness with fair Pretences  Damn ye  says one and  Son of a Whore  stand merely for Cyphers or only serve to enliven a Period and to make the Expression more blustering I confess Whore and Damnation are near akin and often go together but for all that the Silliness of the Excuse can't stifle the monstrous Incivility of the Compliment for though it signifies nothing to him who receives it in good time it will signify much to him who spoke it for though a Friend may let such Curses fall to the Ground God will put them to Account and though they stand for Cyphers in  England  they may purchase Eternal Torments in Hell They are says another Marks of  English  Familiarity pure Sallies of Kindness and Demonstrations of Friendship No doubt to deliver over to  Satan  an old Acquaintance without asking his Consent to the Conveyance is Freedom  with a Vengeance but at which End of the Compliment is his Kindness In short such Expressions grate the Organ and turn the very Faculty of Hearing into a Burthen they are high Symptoms of a lewd Inclination and of a depraved Complexion for when the Breath smells rank the Stomach is infected In short such a Jargon is a Breach of Civility it is a rustick Cant an uncredirable Dialect nor is the whole Posse of Bullies able to enoble it"  Persons of great Fortunes are tempted to Pride and Haughtiness therefore  Serino  laboured by all Means to obtain that excellent Virtue of Humility And was so happy as not to miss of his Design nor lose his Labour for I believe no Man in his Circumstances was ever of a more meek and humble Spirit There is an admirable Sentence in Holy Writ which says that  Pride was not made for Man  There is not indeed any single View of Human Nature under its present Condition which is not sufficient to extinguish in us all the secret Seeds of Pride and on the contrary to sink the Soul into the lowest State of Humility and what the Schoolmen call SelfAnnihilation There is nothing in his Understanding his Will or in his present Condition that can tempt any considerate Creature to Pride or Vanity and yet the very Reasons why he should not be proud are notwithstanding the Reasons  why he is so Were he not a sinful Creature he would not be subject to a Passion which rises from the Depravity of his Nature were he not an ignorant Creature he would see he has nothing to be proud of And were not the whole Species miserable he would not have those wretched Objects of Comparison before his Eyes which are the Occasions of this Passion and make one Man value himself more than another But methinks the Instability of Human Affairs the Turns and Vicissitudes of Fortune and the sudden Falls from the most swoln Ambition are Subjects which ought to discountenance Pride  Shakespeare  has an admirable Passage on this Head spoken by  Wolsey  in  Henry  VIII which  Serino  used often to repeat  Farewel a long Farewel to all my Greatness  This is the State of Man today he puts forth  The tender Leaves of Hope tomorrow blossoms  And bears his blushing Honours thick upon him  The third Day comes a Frost a killing Frost  And when he thinks good easy Man full surely  His Greatness is a ripening nips his Root  And then he falls as I do I have ventur'd  Like little wanton Boys that swim on Bladders  This many a Summer in a Sea of Glory  But far beyond my Depth my highblown Pride  At length broke under me and now has left me  Weary and old with Service to the Mercy  Of a rude Stream that must for ever hide me  He had improved his natural Parts which were indeed extraordinary not only by hard Studies but also by his Travels Upon his return from which he often with an inexpressible Pleasure would repeat the following Ode for which the polite World is obliged to the incomparable Mr  Addison    I  How are thy Servants blest O Lord  How sure is their Defence  Eternal Wisdom is their Guide  Their Help Omnipotence  II  In foreign Realms and Lands remote  Supported by thy Care  Thro' burning Climes I pass'd unhurt  And breath'd in Tainted Air  III  Thy Mercy sweeten'd every Soil  Made every Region please  The hoary  Alpine  Hills it warm'd  And smooth'd the  Tyrrhene  Seas  IV  Think O my Soul devoutly think  How with affrighted Eyes  Thou saw'st the wide extended Deep  In all its Horrors rise  V  Confusion dwelt in every Face  And Fear in every Heart  When Waves on Waves and Gulphs on Gulphs  O'ercame the Pilot's Art  VI  Yet then from all My Griefs O Lord  Thy Mercy set me free  Whilst in the Confidence of Prayer  My Soul took hold on Thee  VII  For tho' in dreadful Whirles we hung  High on the broken Wave  I knew thou wert not slow to hear  Nor impotent to save  VIII  The Storm was laid the Winds retir'd  Obedient to thy Will  The Sea that roar'd at thy Command  At thy Command was still  IX  In midst of Dangers Fears and Death  Thy Goodness I'll adore  And praise Thee for thy Mercies past  And humbly hope for more  X  My Life if thou preserv'st my Life  Thy Sacrifice shall be  And Death if Death must be my Doom  Shall join my Soul to Thee  In fine  Serino  was a Person in whom united Virtues shone with promiscuous Beauty His Fortitude his Chastity his Prudence were as remarkable as his Temperance and Humility but above all Charity was the Virtue that constantly shone with superiour Brightness and gave a charming Lustre to all his Actions A few Weeks before his Death he sent a Thousand Guineas to the Society for propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts which Design he always looked upon as most Noble and Excellent At the same time he observed that the scandalous Divisions of Christians was a great Hindrance to that good Work  "How pernicious is it would he often say to hear such a Variety of contrary Opinions maintained in  Christendom  and the Belief of most of them imposed on us by their zealous Propagators under Pain of Eternal Damnation Should a poor  Indian  desirous to be instructed in the Mysteries of the Gospel make his Application to one of the  Society of Jesus  as the most proper Person to give him Information in those weighty Matters since he not only goes under the common Name of a Christian but as one peculiarly devoted to the Service of his Great Master is stiled a Jesuit a Servant of the Blessed Jesus we will suppose the Jesuit to acquaint him with the Dignity and Glory of the  Roman  Catholick Church and particularly of his Holiness the  Pope  who as St  Peter  's Successor is as he tells him appointed by Christ whose Vicegerent and Representative he is to be the infallible Head of the Christian World and Center of GospelUnity that all are bound to obey him and Disobedience to his Injunctions is no less a Crime than a Rebellion against the Authority of Heaven He farther informs him of that inconceivable Mystery of Transubstantiation and assures him that in the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar he may eat the real Flesh of his Redeemer and swallow down the Deity he is about to adore He will doubtless give him some Instructions concerning the Adoration of Saints and Angels and the Veneration due to Images and Reliques The New Convert may likewise hear the Doctrines of Purgatory Auricular Confession and Indulgences repeated to him with great Earnestness and Solemnity The poor Man having thus patiently attended to a long Discourse of the Christian Religion goes away rejoicing and blesses the happy Moment in which he became acquainted with such sublime and charming Mysteries and was made sensible of the Darkness and Ignorance of his former State in which he had been so often debased by the most stupid and idolatrous Practices But supposing this Convert to fall into the Company of some learned Protestants  and hear them Dispute of Matters of Faith how very much surprized must he needs be to find that a great Part of those Doctrines which he had so eagerly and joyfully embraced were not indeed the Dictates of Christ or his Followers but the wretched and empty Contrivances of crafty Politicians That the beauteous and lovely System which he viewed with the deepest Pleasure and Admiration dissolves and is lost in Air and he can see no more the transient Beauties of his glorious Vision Now what shall this Man do Continue in his present Faith he cannot with any Satisfaction since he has heard such evident Reasons against it and suppose he resolves to forsake his first Scheme and attend to the Instructions of a Protestant Guide there are such various Opinions even amongst them that he is in doubt which Party to apply himself to whilst with trembling he hears them loudly condemning each other"  Serino  did not take Notice of this with any Design to favour a sceptical Humour or a certain awkard Method of ranging one's Thoughts which is newly called by an evident  Catechresis    FreeThinking  his Aim was only to know the dismal Effects of Divisions in the Church of Christ which as they proceed from a scandalous Neglect of the plainest Rules of the Gospel so  might they be effectually cured would Christians but read and consider those earnest Exhortations to Meekness and Unity with half that Calmness in which they were delivered by the Glorious Author of our Salvation Could they but once be persuaded to lay aside their furious and inordinate Passions to quit their corrupt and sinister Designs would they but make themselves so happy as to resolve to value a plain Direction of our Blessed Lord before a thousand quaint Glosses and needless Injunctions Then would Joy and Peace abound and everblooming Beauties adorn the Sacred Temple The Winter being thus happily past and the Rain over and gone the Time of SingingBirds would soon commence and every Christian be refreshed with the charming Musick of the Turtle But the Circumstances of our mourning Family call for my Presence I can therefore only add that when he was apprehensive of approaching Death instead of sinking in Sorrow he entertained himself with recounting the many Mercies he had received through his whole Life and called me to him to read a Hymn composed by the inimitable Mr  Addison  under an Indisposition And when I came to this Verse  O how shall Words with equal Warmth  The Gratitude declare  That glows within my ravish'd Heart  But thou canst read it there  He desired me to repeat it and seemed transported with the Fervours of grateful Devotion He was also then well pleased to hear me read the whole to him  I  When rising from the Bed of Death  O'erwhelm'd with Guilt and Fear  I see my Maker Face to Face  O how shall I appear  II  If yet while Pardon may be found  And Mercy may be sought  My Heart with inward Horror shrinks  And trembles at the Thought  III  When thou O Lord shalt stand disclos'd  In Majesty severe  And sit in Judgment on my Soul  O how shall I appear  IV  But Thou hast told the troubled Soul  Who does her Sins lament  The timely Tribute of her Tears  Shall endless Woe prevent  V  Then see the Sorrows of my Heart  E'er yet it be too late  And add my Saviour's dying Groans  To give those Sorrows weight  VI  For never shall my Soul despair  Her Pardon to procure  Who knows Thy Only Son has dy'd  To make that Pardon sure  In a word he lived as I fain would live and he died as I fain would die By his last Will he left abundance of charitable Legacies and has given the Bulk of his Estate to a young Gentleman whose Misfortunes had been represented to him as very particular and though he was not acquainted with him yet reflected with Pleasure some Days before he died on the agreeable Surprize which the young Gentleman would be in at the hearing such welcome News  Phil  Pray Sir whereabouts dwells the Gentleman who is thus unexpectedly Master of so considerable an Estate  Chapl  In a little Village about twelve Miles off His Name is  Philindus    Phil  Are you sure of that Sir  Chapl  Yes one of our Family is gone this Morning to acquaint him with it  Phil  He will not find him at Home for according to your Description I must be the very Man I do earnestly desire you to continue with me as you did with  Serino  and if at any time you see me acting contrary to his bright Example be so kind as to give me those severe Reproofs which are due to Negligence and Ingratitude And now since after all my Trouble and Sorrow there begins to rise a new and brighter Scene I hope always to retain the most tender and grateful Sentiments of the Divine Compassion and cannot forbear expressing myself in the beautiful Expressions of the Royal Psalmist as Paraphrased by Mr  Addison  to whom we owe all the Poetick Beauties that have ran through our Discourse  I  The Lord my Pasture shall prepare  And feed me with a Shepherd's Care  His Presence shall my Wants supply  And guard me with a watchful Eye  My Noonday Walks he shall attend  And all my Midnight Hours defend  II  When in the sultry Glebe I faint  Or on the thirsty Mountain pant  To fertile Vales and dewy Meads  My weary wand'ring Steps he leads  Where peaceful Rivers soft and slow  Amid the verdant Landscape flow  III  Tho' in the Paths of Death I tread  With gloomy Horrors overspread  My stedfast Heart shall fear no Ill  For thou O Lord art with me still  Thy friendly Crook shall give me Aid  And guide me thro' the dreadful Shade  IV  Tho' in a bare and rugged Way  Thro' devious lonely Wilds I stray  Thy Bounty shall my Wants beguile  Thy barren Wilderness shall smile  With sudden Greens and Herbage crown'd  And Streams shall murmur all around  FINIS
