 THE DRAMATIC PUFFERS A PRELUDE AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLEY FLEETSTREET and E MACKLEW in the HAYMARKET MDCCLXXXII  CHARACTERS  ZEPHYR  Mr EDWIN  BREEZE  Mr ROBSON  AUTHOR  Mr LEE LEWES  THE DRAMATIC PUFFERS  SCENE The Stage  Enter ZEPHYR and BREEZE meeting  ZEPHYR  BY this light but it isWhat Bill Breeze  BREEZE  Ah my gentle Zephyr  shaking hands  Why where have you hid yourselfBut I beg pardon  ZEPHYR  Oh I make no secret of my situations I've been obliged to lodge for a few weeks on the other side of the water it was forcibly recommended to me by a doctor well skilled in consumptive cases  quaintly  BREEZE  And you find yourself the better for it  ZEPHYR  Amazingly for I've now got rid of all those lurking symptoms which are the too frequent attendants on genius and lettersSo I find they have had some flogging work over both courses in my absence the different studs have been run hard eh  BREEZE  Hard  puff'd  all roundscarce a leg to stand on  ZEPHYR  As the knowing ones have been taken in you touch'd a little Breeze I hope  BREEZE  Not a ducatNo Zephyr all my prospects fell with the  coalition  at the beginning of the season indeed I offered my services  here  but I was delicately toldthat authors nowadays took upon themselves the disagreeable task of  criticizing  their own pieces and at as to the ordinary business of the theatre a gentleman of established reputation had undertaken to do the whole upon a standing contract  ZEPHYR  Ay I suppose I should have met with similar neglect on the other side of the way if it had not been for my new invented playhouse machine  BREEZE  Playhouse machine a kind of theatrical  Buzaglo  I suppose occasionally to keep the house warm  ZEPHYR  Conceitedly  Oh no you'll never guess itwill you promise me the most profound secrecy  BREEZE  'Pon my honour  ZEPHYR  Half whispering  Why then you must know I call it and I think rather aptlyI call itan  Applauder  BREEZE  An Applauder  ZEPHYR  Yes an  Applauder  a mechanical improvement on the vulgar art of manucussion by which one man with the simple winch of a barrelorgan shall give a more mark'd and judicious applause than can possibly be derived from any stationary band of hireling clappers  BREEZE  Egad that  is  a happy inventionbut pray Zephyr wont it tend in some measure to counteract the  real  plaudits of an impartial audience  ZEPHYR  Oh quite the contrary for as clapping like gaping is nothing more than an involuntary accordance of muscular motion I will engage my dear Breezebarring rheumatic and gouty casesto carry every hand on any particular occasion in unison with my Applauder  BREEZE  A very capital idea upon my soul  ZEPHYR  Besides I don't see why the benefit of it may not be extended to the performers then you know the actors and actresses of a certain  natural diffidence  need not so often be laid up by the chilling damps of  silent  admiration  BREEZE  Certainly my dear friendBut when will it come out Zephyr  ZEPHYR  Almost immediately the first essay was to have been made on a late  musical occasion  but the author and composer not being able to settle which of the parts deserved the "  most decisive bursts  of  universal applause  " the machine was laid by and the matter left as usual to the decision of hands  BREEZE  And so you are come here I suppose to offer it also to this House  ZEPHYR  Oh no I have convey'd away the  copyright  and the managers of both Theatres are now contending for an exclusive patent  BREEZE  Ha ha ha Do you do any thing in the  parliatary  way now Zephyr  ZEPHYR  Not a  metaphor  that branch fell to nothing when gentlemen first submitted to the fatigue of carrying their  own  FLOWERS to  market  No having a little  leisure upon my hands the prompter said he would recommend me as diurnal colourist to the young author of this night's piece  BREEZE  That's droll enough why I am waiting here myself in hopes of procuring a similar employ  ZEPHYR  Indeed why then if that's the case suppose we conduct the matter jointly and share the profits  BREEZE  With all my heartso if you'll undertake to waft him through the pacific ocean of the mininisterial prints I'll engagebut soft here I fancy comes the young authorand a  martial  one I see by his appearance  Enter AUTHOR in an officer's uniform  looking round  AUTHOR  It's strange I should never be able to catch those scenepainting gentry  Wild  said they would meet me here at half past five  looking at his watch  I fear we shall not arrange the scene for the last act before the piece begins  they advance  Oh gentlemen I'm glad we've met at last  ZEPHYR  Mr Wild Sir I take it for granted  AUTHOR  Yes but he says we've not a moment to lose  BREEZE  True Sir I thought you'd be in a hurry so we took care to be prepared  AUTHOR  I'm glad of it and how do you intend  ZEPHYR  Why Sir as it's a first attempt and times are ticklish I don't think it adviseable to give any thing too highly colour'd at present and therefore I have sketch'd something in the oblique way which I conceive however will have a fine effect  AUTHOR  I understand you in the  side wing  way but in that case how shall we display the performers to advantage  ZEPHYR  Oh dear Sir never fear them they are able and willing enough to take care of themselves  BREEZE  Well for my part I think there is nothing like a good bold outline at once to take in the  flats  AUTHOR  Well gentlemen I'm indifferent whether the scene be a  flat  or an  oblique  one provided its effect be strikingly convey'd to the galleries  BREEZE  Oh lud Sir make yourself perfectly easy on that scoremy designs  pulling out his papers  are calculated for all classes  gives him one  there Sir just run your eye over that I think that will reach the  Gods  or the  Devil  's in it  AUTHOR  Reads  "A new constellation of resplendent brilliancy illumin'd the theatrical hemisphere last night the dramatic magi"  in amazement  What am I to understand by this  ZEPHYR  Giving one of his papers  Probably Sir you'll like that better from the delicacy of the  keeping  AUTHOR  Reads  "The genius of comedy perhaps never was so illustriously display'd"Why what the devil is all this gentlemen  BREEZE  Lud Sir don't you know why  puffs  to be surepuffs and as good as any  home made ones  that you'll find in the circle of your dramatic friends depend on't  AUTHOR  Puffs  ZEPHYR  Yes  puffs  Sir an airy insinuating kind of system which though generally despis'd is more generally practis'd that has the address to baffle the whole  five senses  and carry all its points in spite of conviction  AUTHOR  Indeed is that the case  BREEZE  To be sure Sir  ZEPHYR  No doubt Sirit's what may be emphatically termed the  foilstone of fame  which like the mock jewel of the stage never fails to outglare the modest sparkling diamond  AUTHOR  And pray gentlemen to whom am I indebted for these singular obligationsYour name if you please  BREEZE  My name Breeze Sir I'm not asham'd of my name  pertly  Billy Breeze No at the  brass knocker Air  street Piccadilly  AUTHOR  And your's worthy Sir  ZEPHYR  Zephyr Sir at your service  AUTHOR  And are not you Messrs Zephyr and Breeze a cogenial couple of pitiful parasites  BREEZE  Lud Sir  AUTHOR  Fly hence ye rascally retailers of ill founded reputation and by that means save your boneshowhowever humble my genius may prove know that it scorns to soar upon the wretched pinion of Grubstreet Prostitution  ZEPHYR  Sir This is no place Sirno placebut we'll find one depend on't  BREEZE  Yes Sirwe'll tickle  He drives them out  Enter PROMPTER's BOY  BOY  The scene for the last act is settled so if you please Sir we'll ring in  AUTHOR  By all means  Exit Boy  The author steps forward to speak the Prologue  THE PROLOGUE  THE PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr LEE LEWES  CALL'D forth Thalia's standard to display  And here maintain her sov'reign comic sway  As ChiefI'll reconnoitre well the ground  To learn what hostile lines are drawn around    Surveys the House with a Glass  That's not a dark defile in yonder glade  For shou'd it prove a treach'rous ambuscade  No  puffing  miners have I here in pay  To sap their works or turn their covertway  No mercenary band who have been wont  To hack and hew like pioneers in front  With flying shells our engineers shall try  That well mann'd battlement which tow'rs so high    Pointing to the Upper Gallery  Beneath our pointblankshot will surely reach  And in yon halfmoon batt'ry make a breach    To the Second Gallery  Those lovely breastworks that adorn the field  To nature's gentle summons soon must yield    Side Boxes c  This post advanc'd the piquet guard to keep  And that reserve who are entrench'd chindeep  We hope to carry by a bold exertion  At least amuse with some well plann'd diversion    To the Pit  My troops are vet'ransit has been their lot  To form in front of service hissing hot  Who when their ranks are gall'd or put to flight  Are sure to rally and renew the fight  Unlessand then no light dragoons scour fleeter  Their powder fails for want of true saltpetre  Our plan's avow'd it is from this firm station  To gain the heights of public approbation  THE END
