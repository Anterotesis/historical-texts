command both  The principal building and from which it has its name is the great white square Tower in the middle 'Tis a regular strong lofty structure and the oldest within the walls being built by William the Conqueror in the year  There are besides several  other considerable buildings that have been added to this grand fortress at divers times since of which I shall speak hereafter the whole is encompassed with a strong wall and that surrounded with a broad deep ditch supplied with water out of the Thames  The entrances into the Tower are over two bridges one at the west end for carts coaches footpassengers  c  the other over a drawbridge from the wharf on the south side facing the Thames for footpassengers only It has besides a passage from the river call'd Traitor'sbridge because formerly all persons committed to the Tower for treason were brought thro' it in boats  The government of this important place being of  high honour as well as of great trust is generally committed to a peer of the realm who is ftiled  Constable of the Tower  He has a deputy governor and many other officers under him  CHAP II  Of the Lions and other wild beasts in the Tower  WHen you have passed the two soldiers called  the spurguard  who stand without the first gate you will see the figure of a Lion against the keeper's house right before you and another over the door on your right hand where you are to enter to  see the curiosities  Here each person pays  Threepence  for admittance  The wild creatures that are there shewn are all kept in strong dens so that you need not be under any fear of danger from them Don't venture too near and you may view them very safely  The dens are made in the form the pictures represent in which are  two rooms the lower has strong thick bars of wood the upper iron in one of which the keeper secures the creature whilst the other is clean'd  c  And there are some spare dens in which are no wild beasts at present  You first see a fine  Maiden Lioness  which was a present from the consul of Algiers she is about fourteen years old Her name is  Jenny  Second another  Lioness  from Africa whose name is  Phillis  Third a he  Lion  nam'd  Marco  consort to Phillis He has majesty in his countenance that strikes an awe in the beholders a graceful mane of thick long shagg'd hair ornaments his strong neck and shoulders He has a huge head and a prodigious wide mouth with frightful teeth this  LION  eyes are red fiery and sunk deep into his head his nose is very large with wide nostrils both his sight and smelling are very sharp his bigsinew'd legs and thighs are strong like bars of iron and his claws like hooks five of which he has upon each foot before and four on those behind sheath'd like a cat's with which lie strikes and catches his prey like that animal  His roaring voice is so terrible that it not only strikes mankind with fear but all creatures with such surprize that they dare not stir he may therefore with these properties he justly stil'd the  king of beasts  Marco and Phillis are both from the same country as Jenny and were likewise a present from the consul of Algiers each of them is about nine years old  This royal pair have bred several times in the Tower they have a young  prince  of two years old nam'd  Nero  now to be seen there besides three young ones which were brought forth on the th day of June whom we shall pay our court to before we go  LIONESS  The  Lioness  is lesser than the Lion and has no mane her body being smoother and sleeker the colour of them both are the same which is a dun inclining to a pale yellow with a darkish cast on the surface  The fourth animal is a he  Leopard  from the EastIndies about seven years old This is a very beautiful  LEOPARD  creature of a yellow colour finely mark'd with black spots It is much smaller than any of the Lions or Tigers that are here nor does it seem so fierce his name is  Will  Now you pass to another yard where you see  The fifth which is a she  Panther  call'd  Jenny  the hair of this creature is short and mossy and of a bright yellow beautifully mark'd  with round black spots like the Leopard's but not quite so full 'Tis in size shape and colour so much like the Leopard that when asunder their difference is not easily distinguish'd and when together only by nicely observing their spots Therefore we need not give its figure  The person who shews these creatures tells us that the Panther is produced  from the coupling of the Lion and Leopard others say 'tis the he Panther and Lioness which beget the Leopard but the most probable opinion is that the Leopard is the male and the Panther the female of one and the same species  The Panther is said to be of a fierce nature than the Leopard more greedy of blood very swift and  catches her prey by leaping upon it suddenly  Sixth and seventh are a he and she  Tiger  from the South Sea they are kept together in one den and have had several litters of whelps They have been in the Tower about ten years their names are  Will  and  Phillis  and they have a son whose name is  Dick  who was bred in the Tower and is now about  six years old He had a brother whelp'd with him who liv'd but a little while Dick is a beautiful mark'd creature and finely shaped but stoops a little in his shoulders occasion'd by the fall of a table upon his back when he was at nurse  The two old ones Will and Phillis are mark'd with round spots like the Leopard whereas those  TWO TIGERS  found in the EastIndies are streak'd all down their sides  c  instead of spots  The Tiger is shap'd very much like the Lioness only somewhat lesser and has a shorter neck but is bigger than either Leopard or Panther Its colour and spots resemble the Leopard's but they have not near so many nor are they so bright and beautiful  The Tiger is of a very  wild and fierce nature exceeding ravenous and of a prodigious swiftness He spares neither man nor beast but if he can satisfy his hunger with the flesh of beasts he will not attack mankind It is said that this creature is seldom taken but in defence of its young These two in the Tower sport and play very wantonly together The female is now big with young  The eighth animal is a  Racoon  chain'd in the yard where it has a wooden hutch or box like a Fox's to run into when it is minded It is about the size of the Fox has a thick fur on his back sides  c  of a dark grizly colour with a thick bushy tail It feeds on flesh fish or roots like the Fox and seems to partake much of  RACOON  the nature of that crafty creature  The next are two  Vultures  in separate woonden cages the first has been in the Tower twenty years the second about six They are both of a colour which is like that of the Dove and their size is equal likewise which is bigger than the Eagle Their beaks are large and crooked at the end their necks for  VULTURE  the most part bare of feathers The craw of the Vulture hangs down like a bag before the stomach or breast under the throat it has a space of about an hand breadth cloathed rather with hairs like to those of a calf than feathers and the inside of the wings are cover'd with a soft fleece of down which is peculiar to the Vulture alone among birds of prey  It is said that Vultures have an excellent sense of smelling above all other birds so that they can perceive the savour of dead carcasses from afar And that from their devouring of dead bodies they were call'd  living tombs  They are said to follow armies because in their marches a great many men horses  c  fall here and there by the way Job has the  like description of the Eagle  and where the slain are there is she  chap xxxix  The antients have delivered that the Vulture is content only with dead carcasses abstaining from the ravin  and slaughter of living animals but some moderns affirm that it preys upon living birds fawns hares kids lambs  c  EAGLE  The last are  two Eagles  in separate cages they have been in the Tower about thirty years They are of a dark brown colour almost black unless on the top of their heads pinnions of their wings  c  which are of a bright reddish brown and are therefore called  the brown Eagles  For another  Threepence  you see the following  First young  prince Nero  of two years old whom we just mentioned son of Marco and Phillis bred in the Tower he has a fine shock'd mane and is really a beautiful creature and exceedingly well educated for upon my expressing a desire of visiting his lodging at a word speaking he march'd down with great condescension from his upper into his  lower apartment and gave me the opportunity of entering his den where having satisfied my curiosity in viewing his dining room kitchen and bedchamber his manner of living particular ceremony in eating drinking  c  at my departure from thence he would fain have took me by the hand But our acquaintance being but slender I declin'd accepting  so great a mark of his friendship till I knew him better  Upon the keeper's putting into his den a piece of lights he seemingly took very little notice of it but couch'd down on his belly with his forefeet out like a cat that is going to leap at a mouse and in an instant gave a sudden spring from the farthest side of the den and seiz'd  it with amazing fierceness  My young readers will excuse my not giving them the picture of prince Nero because he is so like his papa whose royal visage you may see in page that it would appear almost the same  Second a  Lioness  thirteen years old bred likewise in the Tower from a former pair that are now  dead This is the fiercest beast in the Tower her name is  Nanny  Third the young he  Tiger  nam'd  Dick  son of Will and Phillis described in pag  Fourth a  Porcupine  in an iron cage This is one of the strangest animals in the world its back sides and tail are guarded with strong quills each a foot and half long all pointed  PORCUPINE  as sharp as needles and spotted with black and white these the creature draws up all together that they look like so many halfpikes and stand so distinct that the skin of the beast may be seen between each and then suddenly strikes them all back with great force as if they went with a strong spring turning her self about at the same time every way  Snake to all which tribe 'tis an utter enemy  Whatever its antipathy may be to the snake kind to man it seems a very inconsiderable enemy it is neither very swift nor fierce and though it is so well armed 'tis rather for its own defence than offence to any other animal  Its flesh in those countries where 'tis found is esteem'd by the natives as  good foot This in the Tower is fed with bread roots and fruit It was brought from the EastIndies  Fifth in the same room is a large old  Ape  which at command does several diverting trickes  Sixth an uncommon large beautiful  Bird  called  Warwoven  or  King  of the  Vawous  It was brought to the Tower in September  The  APE  last and was a present from his grace the Duke of Mountagu It is somewhat lesser than the Eagle These kind of birds are found in some parts of the EastIndies  Lastly you are shewn the  three young Lions  which were  help'd on the th day of  June  At five weeks old and likewise at ten I had them in my lap they were then  WARWOVEN  very innocent and might as safely be handled as ladies lapdogs They were indeed somewhat bigger and not quite so finely shaped excepting their colour they were not much unlike young lambs  Their hair was soft like fine wool their colour nearly the same as the old Lions They are kept in A neat clean room and for some time fed with warm  THREE YOUNG LIONS  milk and are brought to the eating of flesh by degrees One is a male whose name is  Pompey  the other two are females one named  Priscilla  the other  Nell  CHAP IV  Histories and Observations on the Lions in the Tower  c  LIons Tigers Panthers and Leopards are fed  with sheeps heads and plucks twice a day of which a Lion eats four or five in a day but Leopards Panthers and Tigers are much fonder of raw dogsflesh They are always separated when they eat or they would quarrel The wild Lions of Africa are said to prey chiefly upon wild Boars which sometimes prove so hard to conquer that both  have been found dead together in their gore They drink as often as they drink as often as they please usually several times in a day each having a stone trought in his den  The Lion being an animal of a hot and thirsty nature was by the antients represented as an emblem or symbol of sultry weather  The Tower has been a place for keeping of wild  beasts in above five hundred years  On Sunday the th of August a Lioness named  Elizabeth  brought forth a young Lion in the Tower which young one died the next day This was the first Lion whelp'd in that place and probably in England  The th of February following the same Lioness brought forth another  young Lion which by command of King James was taken from the dam as soon as whelp'd and nursed by hand but this also died in about sixteen days  The greatest age any Lions have been known to live in the Tower is about twenty years  The Lion in the day times seems to be a very sluggish heavy animal that hates to be rous'd and is  no sooner up but if suffer'd will immediately slap down again Perhaps in the night they may be otherwise it being more natural to them to seek their prey in The holy Psalmist hath the like observation  Thou makest darnkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth The young Lions roar after their prey and seek their  meat from God The su  ariseth they gather them selves together and lay them down in their dens  Psal civ  The Lioness goes with young exactly four months None were ever known to have more than three at a litter They are whelp'd with their eyes open and are taken from the dam immediately or they would perish  They are very tender and require a great deal of care in nursing it being exceedingly difficult to bring up a young Lion and so it is Tigers  c  They often die in breeding their teeth sometimes in strong convulsions The same is observ'd by the people of Barbary to happen to the young wild Lions of that country or they would be much more  numerous than they are in those parts  Young Lions are kept about twelve months in a warm room before they are put into dens but before they come to that age are chain'd and are always separated when they eat their victuals Their savage nature comes on gradually as they grow up and they are three years a coming to their full growth  It has been the common opinion that the Lion is afraid of fire their keepers deny that they are so One of them who now attends the wild beasts in the Tower going one night in the last hard winter to the den of the old Lion with a lighted candle held his hand near the bars to see if the creature was come down into the lower apartment  when suddenly he put out his paw and wounded the man so dangerously in the back of his hand that he very narrowly escap'd losing it And this he brings as an instance to shew that they are not afraid of fire  The Lion often sleeps and snores with his eyes open and likewise with them shut  King James the first being  minded to make trial of the nature and courage of the Lion and some other wild beasts went to the Tower attended by several of the nobility where he ordered a Lion and Lioness to be turned out of their dens and a Cock to be cast to them which they presently killed and suck'd its blood  Next a Lamb was ordered to be put to them  which the Lions out of their generosity never offer'd to touch although it went close up to them  Then two Mastiffs were let loose upon a single Lion which they presently seized and turn'd upon his back and tho' the Lion was superior to them in strength yet they were his match in courage  Some time after a Lion was turned out of his den  to a Bear which had kill'd a child but the Lion would not attack the Bear  They try'd several other single Lions and at length two together but all fled from him and wanted rather to get into their dens  A Stonehorse was put into the yard with the first Lion and the Bear the Horse after a little while fell to grazing between them which they never  offer'd to touch Afterwards six Dogs were let in who flew upon the Horse most in sight at their first entrance and would soon have worried him to death had not three stout fellows enter'd in who rescu'd the Horse and brought away the Dogs while the Lion and Bear stood staring upon them At this sight were present King James  the first the Queen Prince and divers of the nobility  And though the Bear which kill'd the child escap'd at this time he was afterwards by command of the King baited to death with Dogs upon a stage  There was a Spaniel Dog for some offence cast into the Lion's den but the Lion did not attempt to hurt him and this  Dog continued in the den with the Lion several years and there died  The End of the first Book  BOOK II  CHAP I INTRODUCTION  FRom the Lions Tower you pass on over the bridge right before  you when presently you will come to the Warders who are upon duty at their ward or gate  They are easily known by their peculiar dress Upon their heads they wear slta crown'd caps of black velvet with a band of ribbons of divers colours Their coats are scarlet laced with gold round their skirts sleeves and up their sides and  round their wastes a broad laced belt with the king's badge of silver gilt with gold upon their breasts and backs representing the Thistle Rose and Crown and G R in capitals  There are forty Warders belonging to the Tower ten of whom are upon duty at a time These gentlemen have authority to examine all persons  coming into the Tower and one of them will attend such as are going to see the Curiosities to shew and explain them without whose assistance it would be difficult to find them out or to understand them rightly For this service when you dismiss the Warder it is customary to give him a gratuity according to your own generosity  The chief Curiosities after you have seen the Lions  c  which costs  Sixpence  each are  The  Spanish Armada  price Twopence each  The  small Armoury  price Threepence each  The  Train of Artillery  price Twopence each  The  Horse Armoury  price Twopence each  The  Crown  and the rest  of  His Majesty's Regalia  price One Shilling each  Note  If any person goes singly he pays  Eighteenpence  to see the Regalia and to see any of the others he pays double of the common prices No person is oblig'd to see all but only so many of them as he pleases  Lastly the  Royal Mint  where all the gold silver  and copper coins and medals are struck To see this there is no price demanded but what you please to give the workmen This curiosity cannot at all times be shewn the workmen are not at work or the favour is not granted at least to see some part of it  c  CHAP II  Of the invincible  Spanish Armada  of Philip  II  King of Spain  IT may not be improper to inform my young readers that in the year Philip II King of Spain having prepared a powerful navy which consisted of One hundred and thirty ships with  which he design'd to invade and conquer England thought himself so sure of victory that his fleet was christen'd by the Pope  The Invincible Armada  which signifies a strength that could not be overcome  The great Queen Elizabeth hearing of this vast armament instead of being dismay'd like a valiant Princess order'd a strong  fleet to be fitted out with all possible expedition and gave the command of it to Sir Francis Drake and other great and valiant commanders And notwithstanding the enemy was greatly superior in number and strength of ships the English engag'd the Spanish fleet upon our own coasts and after nine or ten days fight gain'd a most glorious victory taking  SPANISH ARMADA  burning and sinking eighty of their ships in which were killed thirteen thousand five hundred of their men and above two thousand were taken prisoners  At this ever memorable victory were taken various instruments of war with which the Spaniards intended to have tortured the poor English had they been so unfortunate as to  have been overcome by that haughty and cruel nation  And they are here treasured up as a noble trophy of old English valour and are a constant lesson from generation to generation to Britain's sons of what their forefathers did to defend their country against Spanish bondage and stir them up to emulation  CHAP III  Of the Arms  c  taken from the Spaniards in Queen Elizabeth's time    and other curiosities  YOU are first shewn a number of  pikes  each six yards long with velvet holdings about their middle the steel points were gilt with gold upon some  of which the gilding is still visible The Spanish Dons were so sure of conquest that they spared no cost in equipping themselves because they intended the English should pay for all  Over head hangs a large number of Spanish  pistols  and  targets  which were the only firearems they had then in use and which were discharg'd with a match One of these lies  in a window below for the curious to examine  Next you see a parcel of Spanish  launces  of a prodigious size with which those polite people designed after they had conquered the English to have bled them with to prevent their falling into fevers Queen Elizabeth being always tender of her subjects thought those instruments would make too  large an orifice therefore order'd them to be disarm'd of such dangerous tools which was quickly perform'd by her gallant captains  Near to the last are a great many frightful weapons resembling billhooks but a great deal larger  Next a parcel of Spanish  poleaxes  with three or four tangs at one end  at the other a sharp point  Then you are shewn a small train of  Artillery  consisting of about ten pretty little  cannon  in carriages all ranged inn beautiful order They were a present from the city of London to King Charles the first when he was a child for him to learn the art of war by  Two of the  Danes clubs  each six foot long desperate  rate weapons These we are told are of great antiquity and that they have been in the Tower ever since it was built The people whose custody they are now in call them the  womens weapons  because they say in those times above eight hundred years ago the women conspired against the Danes and destroy'd thirty thousand by cutting their throats  c  for which reason they tell you the women have ever since had the wall of the man the upper end of the table and the first cut  Next a cruel instrument called a  Spanish cravat  with which those people design'd to torture the English In this their necks hands and feet were to be confin'd in such a barbarous manner that the poor sufferers must have undergone  the most exquisite tortures till either they were starv'd to death or expir'd thro' pain of their great torment  Near to the last stands a  shield  made of the skin of a Rhinoceros which was a present from the great Mogul to King Henry the seventh  Three antient Spanish  spados  or  swords  of different sizes  Some of the first chainshot said to be invented by Admiral Drake for tearing of rigging  c  Here is likewise shewn an ill shap'd old  axe  the same with which Anne of Bullen was beheaded by order of King Henry the eighth She was mother to Queen Elizabeth And with the same axe the Earl of Essex was beheaded in Queen Elizabeth's time
