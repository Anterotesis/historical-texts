 MEMOIRS OF T WILKINSON  VOL I  MEMOIRS OF HIS OWN LIFE BY TATE WILKINSON  PATENTEE OF THE THEATRESROYAL YORK HULL  IN FOUR VOLUMES  IF I HAD HELD MY PEN BUT HALF AS WELL AS I HAVE HELD MY BOTTLEWHAT A CHARMING HAND I SHOULD HAVE WROTE BY THIS TIME  VOL I  YORK  PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR By WILSON SPENCE and MAWMAN And sold by G G J and J ROBINSON PaternosterRow and T and J EGERTON Whitehall London  Anno    TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF NORFOLK  MY LORD DUKE  TO a patron of the Muses this would indeed be an intrusive and contemptible offering as I cannot claim even the most distant relationship with the Sister Arts and if I were to assume only a familiar and easy acquaintance I should be instantly detected as a silly though  not  an  artful  impostor I must therefore slide imperceptibly into your Grace's presence under the fallacious and specious pretext of being a dangling twigcousin of the alluring theatres to which your Grace is a wellknown avowed friend  amateur  and protector as they evidently are honoured with your Grace's neverfailing tribute and supportTherefore under the guardian shades of Melpomene and Thalia I am emboldened  by Hope  to cast my defenceless work at your Grace's feet imploring mercy and pity for my lack of skill and nonacquaintance with the Muses The work indeed is a true picture of its master being as destitute of wit as wealthThe concurring evils of  its poverty and want of natural brilliant endowments preclude I fear every possible chance of good fortune for preserving its life with the world's approbation unless when they behold with wonder your Grace's condescension in raising the supplicating mendicant from the ground and crowning its insignificance with your good wishes which must be ever regarded as an honoured and gracious fostering And who knows by being thus adorned with the Duke of Norfolk's name in its front but it may make so brilliant an appearance as to obtain a passport into the presence of the most noble and worthy and by such unmerited good fortune its sickly life may not only be preserved from instant perishing but prolonged even after its insignificant parent shall inevitably be obliterated from the smallest traces of memory as your Grace's goodness wit and understanding will live for ages and perhaps occasionally be the means of restoring a faint gli  mering in theatrical dark passages of him who during his life has ever been with true gratitude and respectful homage  Your Grace's much honoured highly obliged and obedient humble servant TATE WILKINSON  YORK  OCTOBER  PREFACE  GOOD READER  BE kind courteous merciful and forgiving for how would you be if  HE  who is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are Oh think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made  This confused motley incoherent medleythis something or this nothing of a work was undertaken without any premeditation or note whatever and finished heedlessly during a severe painful and tedious illness occasioned by a dreadful fractured legthe time greatly interfered upon with the constant and unavoidable vexations disappointments and accidents that will ever be the natural attendants on the conductor of a theatre as the difficulty of pleasing before and behind the curtain  requires at least  no  common share  of  wit  but as I was unable to move and was ever addicted to the witching time of night it helped to alleviate many distressed hours  As to wit I profess it not yet here and there it will start unexpectedly as the quotations are so variously sprinkled and either witness for or against me but  I may surely be permitted to quote as the ablest and most ingenious men do the same no matter how elevated in rank and station and are frequently heard by the Lords and Commons and even at the learned bar on the most serious occasions neither is the holy pulpit entirely exempt from this practice The esteemed Samuel Whyte  Esq  of Dublin remarks that  "every class of life has its pedants those of a theatrical turn shew their predilection in their use of theatrical allusions and citations from plays on every occasion happily exemplified in the character of the Apprentice here the writer takes  eave once for all to acknowledge that he has studiously imitated the turn of expression and adopted a favourite phrase from any passage alluded to in other writers without particularizing it by any mark or intimation deeming it superfluous to the learned reader who needs no monitor to recognise an old acquaintance and may be pleased to meet it in a novel and unexpected situation To the less learned it would be empty parade and disfigure the page to no end Our most eminent poets have freely indulged themselves in this practicePope especiallybut as he resorted to the ancients and works not commonly known it has not been generally noticed and by most who have observed it esteemed a beauty"  As a stage chronologer I  flatter myself this work besides its authenticity possesses stage materials and many whimsical situtions that in the hands of a Mr Mu p  y might have been so pleasingly dre  ed as to have sustained the being viewed and examined But I fear like Bayes I have a kna  k of making myself not understoodI mean it a  a kind of register for all persons attached to the theatres and who wish for information relative to the London and Dublin stages It may r  eve an heavy hour on a rainy day and to th  atrical pro  essors I think I may recommend it as containing as impartial and true an account of the progress of the principal events of playhou  es as any book I  an recollect on the subje  t and at the same time truly lament its thousand deficiencies and improprieties which I am sensible will be insuperab  e bars to its prosperity  However I wrap myself in one idea which is I think it will not cannot be on examination more indifferently and contemptuously estimated than all my frien  s and  ven my foes combined I dare suppose expect it to be and I as freely declare on the perusal it is better with all its prolixity than I ever expected it would or could be But I must in its behalf request my readers to observe as a strict truth that the printers to their incessant fatigue can testify there never has been  one regular  sheet  or  a legible  one and though a strange assertion it is  incontrovertibly true  the incorrectness of what I had  scratched  down  from one corner to the other  was not intelligible even to myself the day following and therefore it was next to impossible to properly divine the meaning consequently many passages and words have been misconstrued and unavoidably retained and printed and hence several of my  wise  observations and informations from  absolute necessity  have been entirely obliterated or not properly inserted frequently from my own splashings and alterations as I so bewildered the printers that they declared it incomprehensible and impossible to proceedthat they never had such a job in their lives and heartily prayed they never might have such anotherHowever the press after groaning has produced to light the mishapen deformity Indeed it may with propriety be observed as matter of surprise all circumstances considered that my truly good friend in the ful  est sense of the word Mr WILSON has accomplished a work in ten months in spight of the several insurmountable obstacles and striking impediments which obstructed its ever gliding smoothly into the road of either credit or fame All this considered will easily gain kind allowance why its delay need not be wondered at and my lameness apologize for tardy steps for  when I  first  printed the proposals I had at that time only begun the toilsome task I had set myself and though  brevity  is the first word I fear  tautology  would with justice seize the eldership and right  The Tablet being an afterthought rendered some repetition requisite and several anecdotes are omitted there as a reference to the first and second volumes will supply many deficienciesThe reader will allow for the different dates I have mentioned when writing and not allude to the year of perusal For an account of Mrs Baker whose letters conclude Vol IV See Vol III page Mentioning London performers in a future publication intitled "The Wandering Patentee" is to be understood as meant not to extend beyond those who have favoured the York Theatre with their services not to the performers at large as that would be taking too great a liberty  But notwithstanding its ricketty origin be it known to all men that there is a secret pride which however I would endeavour to conceal will burst out when I perceive  four volumes  in print  By  TATE WILKINSON I re  on it with astonishment and look with wonder at my patience and perseverance as  philosophy  and  steadiness  I dare assert rarely attend my hobbing morning or evening walks Every one will readily admit the materials to be the genuine spinning from my own brain and allow me like Touchstone to be contented with my own illfavoured thing which no one else will claim I must observe it has been a tedious collection from memory  not having a single note except the interspersed genuine letters and ancient playbills which have been preserved merely by accident not design from the ruins of time and snatched from the blaze of hundreds  Except two printed playbills one of the other as inserted in the Memoirs I am not possessed of one prior to all the others are actually from memory  If my ability equalled my inclination it would be as elegant and heartfelt an offering as real genius ever presented to a discerning public Such as it is I submissively request their acceptance of it and like goodwilled Francis's pennyworth of sugar can only lament it is not betterNow earnestly wishing for more friends without the need and their every prosperity  I am their highly indebted much obliged and respectful humble servant c TATE WILKINSON  YORK  OCTOBER  NB  To Mr SWALWELL I look on myself as much indebted for the business could never have proceeded but from his incessant exertions and indefatigable perseverance  SUBSCRIBERS' NAMES  A  Ailesbury the Rt Hon the

as the Law directs  MEMOIRS OF TATE WILKINSON  BREVITY is the soul of WITI am sorry for my own sake as well as for those who have the patience and good nature to peruse this motley work to observe that it will be dreadfully deficient in both these material articlesHowever that the reader may not be kept in suspense and then complain that the  mountain  after a  tedious labour  has at length  brought forth only a mouse  I will without further ceremony proceed  I  Tate Wilkinson  whose various stage adventures and  sparrings  have been permitted and favoured with acceptance more or less in almost every principal theatre in the three kingdoms as DruryLane CoventGarden HayMarketSmockAlley and CrowStreet DublinBath Edinburgh Portsmouth Winchester Maidstone  Birmingham Chester Bristol Norwich York Shrewsbury Richmond in Surry Exeter Glasgow Newcastle Leeds Lynn Pontefract Halifax Doncaster Hull Wakefield cam the son of the late Rev Dr John Wilkinson who was educated at St Bees in Cumberland and finished his studies at the university of Oxford and who suffered transportation under the well remembered Marriage Act in He was his Majesty's chaplain of the Savoy also chaplain to his late Royal Highness Frederic Prince of Wales rector of Coyty in the county of Glamorgan and stipendarycurate of Wise in the county of KentThe late Lord Galway with whom he was particularly acquainted presented him with a gift which yielded a right to open plaisterpits in the honour of Pontefract The original grant was to Robert Monkton late of Hoderoyde in the county of York father to the aforesaid Lord Galway The right from the Duchyoffice was in Those plaisterpits were sold to a Mr Jenkinson near Ferrybridge but how they turned out it never lay in my way to get informationGrace Wilkinson his wife was daughter of William Tate  Esq  who was for many years one of the aldermen of the city of Carlisle and often chosen mayor of that ancient corporation for above forty years patent searcher of his Majesty's customs there and at the port of  Whitehavena gentleman of undoubted loyalty The said Grace Wilkinson when she intermarried with the Rev John Wilkinson brought him two thousand pounds at that time judged a very genteel fortuneDr Wilkinson's affairs having been for many years greatly embarrassed not only hers but all his own acquisitions were entirely exhausted to satisfy the demands of his own creditors and those of others for whom he had become indiscreetly engaged  I Tate Wilkinson son to the said John and Grace was born October and by my father's sentence of transportation was likely to have been irretrievably ruined I was at that critical period at the age of seventeennot brought up to any business or professionof a very indifferent constitutionand neither mother nor son had the least independency  Previous to this unfortunate event my father and mother had been connected with the most leading families and were universally acquainted in London the consequence most fortunately for myself as will appear hereafter was that from the intercourse of visiting they formed intimate connexions with several leading persons of the kingdom of Ireland which was the foundation of the happiest future consequences to me as will in the narrative be verifiedSeveral of these families  every year resorted to London where they ever found hospitality and a cheerful welcome at our mansion in the SavoyAmongst our various visitors were Lord and Lady Forbes from the sister kingdom They were so attached to my father and mother as to be almost inseparable That intimacy subsisted on so strong a basis and formed so firm a friendship that they used to call me their  own boy Tate  and their  dear George's only particular friend  They promised to fix me genteelly in life and were certain if George lived to be Earl of Granard  Tate  would be well provided forAiry castles too often gain belief and dependence when of a sudden they disappear and wake the deluded dreamer from his transitory vision and in lieu present a true mirror in which he views his actual stateNot that I mean these promises in all probability would not have been performed but the wheel of Fate is so uncertain perplexing and various as evinces the truth of Shakspeare  We all know what we are but know not what we may be  This intimacy with the Forbes' family was carried on more like a modern novel than a common acquaintance Young George Forbes was born April I was not permitted to wear breeches until the same day appointed for George the d of April Lady Forbes  notwithstanding title and great expectations in life was not without many of her days being embitteredHer heart and mind were softened by the too often experiencing humiliating events disappointments and afflictions She was related to Lord Blessington and Lady Tyrawley and was niece to Lady Granard and bred up under her care Her eldest son young Lord Forbes as he ripened into manhood by frequent intercourse with his lovely relation soon became a willing slave to the irresistible qualities of his captivating cousin She gave him grace for grace and love for love yielded to his entreaties and they were privately married  The maid that loves  Goes out to sea upon a shatter'd plank  And puts her trust in miracles for safety  trusting as many young couples do when the irrevocable knot was tied that submission and intreaty with a promise of forgiveness  This once and I will do so no more  But age on these occasions is either soon softened or like the everlasting flint is hard and obdurate and in that instance was so to such a degree as rendered supplication tears and remonstrance only incentives to increase instead of lessening the vengeance denouncedThat steeled character on that occasion was exemplified in the severest degree and  executed with a Roman strictnessFor the Earl of Granard not only banished his son Lord Forbes from his presence for ever but on the cruel supposition that Lady Granard had connived at the match he in the most stern and sudden manner separated himself from her Ladyship and never after saw or spoke to her all m  diation of families no matter of what rank were vainIn this he was fixed and acted as resolutely as our stage Count of Narbonne  Lady Granard to prove her disapprobation of the match and to regain the affections of her Lord instead of consolation and comfort to her niece Lady Forbes in her then calamitous situation vowed never to behold her more and in this determination she was as resolute as a Roman matron and proved she possessed as steeled a mind as her inexorable LordIn one point only the female breast gave way to natural feelingYoung George she saw cherished and adored and often had him while young at her house in Argyle Buildings near SohosquareBut the grandfather never yielded to the ties of affinityhe lived chiefly retired at his own seat of Castle Forbes in Ireland  Lord Forbes was generally with his regiment at Gibraltar or with the regiment on its return to IrelandHe had a house in Stephen'sGreen  Dublin and occasionally made a secret excursion to England to visit his wife and son who chiefly resided at her house in Richmond Buildings Deanstreet Soho The son was at or before seven years old put to a Mr Black's boardingschool at Chiswick where I was often taken as a visitorWhen turned of eleven her Ladyship and son received orders to repair to Dublin On this occasion her Ladyship took with her a carpet for her drawingroom esteemed beautiful the work of my mother and I dare say it is in the family to this day with several elegant worked skreens in tent stitch executed by the same good ingenious hand  About the age of thirteen he was brought back to England to finish his education and then to be placed in his Majesty's Guards Our meeting on his arrival in England as may be imagined was very joyous he was placed under the care of a Mr Gibson a rigid Scotchman also under the eye of his uncle Admiral Forbes He was soon sent to Harrowschool I was eager to follow him and in another year that wish was accomplished of which a particular account will occur in the Theatrical History and it will claim a short attention  But of the young hero I am now speaking when about sixteen he was in possession of his Majesty's colours and often on guard at the  Savoy he grew very dissipated while under the direction of a Mr Durel when not on duty at his academy in King'sstreet Goldensquare but as he could not be kept within bounds Lady Forbes from the accounts transmitted to Ireland being greatly alarmed and fearful he should incur the displeasure of his father intreated his Lordship to grant her the inspection and guardianship of her son in London till he grew nearer a proper time of life to be trusted to the care of himself this point was settled and an house once more taken in the old spot Richmond Buildings  At first all seemed to promise fair and a Mrs Wilson who had for many years been companion to Lady Forbes a sister of Mrs Kelly wife of honest old Cornelius Kelly now living in Dublin was the person appointed to hint any private displeasure to our young Captain The fond mother seemed intoxicated with the prospect of happiness before her delighted imagination but of a sudden on the nonappearance of George for a few days she experienced the most alarming anxiety which after fruitless enquiries was at last cleared up by a young couple from Gretna Green imploring her blessing Her fortitude forsook her and her exclamations of grief surprise and terror for the consequences with Lord Forbes and the dread of every horrid indignation from the old  Earl overwhelmed her with the most poignant distress for she well foresaw that every ill that fatally occurred would be attributed to her needless assumption of residing in Londonand instead of preventing would be accused of encouraging her son in every false step Nor had she presence of mind nor fortitude sufficient at the first shock to enquire who this daughter was but as soon as Reason could resume its seat dreading an increasing tale of woe yet obliged to require information which being truly given mitigated her uneasiness and was most happily relieved on being pleasingly informed he had married a daughter of Sir Nicholas Baily tho' her expectations of fortune on enquiring were but small She proved a young lady of promise fit to adorn any exalted station in life Matters were ill received in Ireland but by degrees his Lordship became better reconciled than could be expectedBy this amiable young lady the family were blessed with the present Earl of Granard now in Dublin but she soon after fell into a decay and like a lily drooping died It was during this part of their history the reader will suppose when I hereafter speak of Lady Forbes that young gentleman's mother that I received such favours when first acting in London  Soon after the death of that amiable young lady the Earl of Granard died but not before  he was reconciled at the last to his son and grandson then become Lord Forbes and his father of course the Earl of Granard The young Lord married a lady of quality in London Soon after his second marriage he became Earl of Granard but from modern fashions was separated from his LadyHe went to Ireland his mother went with him but being then in possession of all his wishes in point of rank and fortune I am truly grieved to add he grew dissipated and of course so very rapidly involved as inevitably lost him all consequence and esteem amongst those where his rank entitled him to every respect and increase of popularity and dignity To close my account of a gentleman so much my superior and for whom I had the strongest attachments and every reason to expect friendship and lasting regard if promises and professions may be supposed to allow a claim added to the intercourse of many years I will finish this portrait by mentioning when I was last in Dublin in he was constantly with me by ten o'clock in a morning and I often passed the evening with him at his house in Myrionstreet near Myrionsquare But three nights before my return to England my company on Thursday June was particularly desired to meet Mr Lee attorney at law on urgent business It was our last meeting The mighty business was to be a witness  to his will which he Mr Lee now living in Dublin drew upNo not even a ring to his memorynor at my benefit which was on the th of May did he so much as take a box or even a box ticketbut was there in personSo much for friendshipso much for dependenceBut I must not omit that whenever I paid my respects in Myrionstreet there was plentynay even a profusion of half pints of Claret Burgundy c Had he regarded himself more I might perhaps have profited by our strong intimacy imbibed from childhood  Let this be a lesson to place as much as possible our chief dependence on ourselves rather than rely on ideal hopes or promises from superiorsHow did I retire home to my lodging that evening is a natural questionWhy good reader whoever thou art I assure you not unhappilyI reflected that had the Earl felt for his own welfare he would in all probability have retained some portion of feeling and humanity for his oldhis intimate friendand when reclined on my pillow found myself at that moment possessed of every supply for my wants with health and spirits to support those wants I felt myself comparatively the greatest man of the two He did not live many years after the Spring The young Lady Granard of whom I have not  the least knowledge I believe is married in IrelandThe Lady Dowager Granard was ever my staunch friend she retired to England and died within these few years at her villa some miles from London  The present Lord Granard I am told bears his blushing honours thick upon him pray God he may have no frost to nip them but restore his family laurels to their pristine health and vigour and with many years enjoy that felicity long wanting to his predecessorsHe is spoke of in the warmest terms by all that know him as a distinguished nobleman and a finished gentlemanI never saw him but feel an attachment from my knowledge of and favours conferred by his family in a course of years  This little history I hope will not be found tiresome to the reader particularly if perused by a native of Ireland and flatter myself it will pass without censure for besides being authentic I mean as I pursue my historical journal to mix various anecdotes and occurrences without making it merely a languid stage repetition several little traits of the same complexion and degree will be introduced which I hope the reader will honour me with patience to endure as they will in some measure prove relieving explanatory entertaining and indeed are absolutely necessary as a key to the whole  But to return to my Savoy historyAdded to the noble family lately recurred to were Mr and Mrs William Chaigneau from Dublin He was agent to most of the regiments on the Irish establishment a gentleman universally known and whose memory is greatly respected He wrote for his amusement the novel in two volumes called  Jack Connor  Mrs Chaigneau was a lady who attracted the good opinion of every one They had only one daughter whom they termed their  Darling Peggy  This lovely pledge they could not part with on their excursions from Ireland to England indeed so careful were they  "They permitted not the winds of heaven to visit her face too roughly"  Mrs Teague Mrs Chaigneau's sister an intimate of my mother's honoured me by standing as my godmother at my baptism and in the chit chat and want of matter for conversation when all were convened a few years after at the friendly fireside they proposed a wedding between Master Tate Wilkinson and Miss Peggy Chaigneau This was agreed to and my father actually performed the ceremony and we were afterwards jokingly called  man and wife  I believe I might be at this mock marriage six or sevenyoung Peggy about five or six But to the lasting grief of Mr and Mrs Chaigneau they lost the idol of  their heart in two or three years afterwards and I was left a disconsolate young widower I mention this childish incident as it leads to more serious matter hereafter in this journal of  "events and momentous history"  Alderman Forbes and his Ladythe well known ancient Cornelius Kelly and his wifeand many others made up a convivial Irish party at our cheerful board My father being more attentive to the pleasures than the cares of the world I was sometimes at a boardingschool sometimes not perhaps six months in the year at Chelsea with a Mr Bellas in Churchlane there the other six at home the next six months at Mr Tempest's near Wandsworth then again at home particularly if the winter was severe Some time afterwards I had tutors at home then I went to Harrow School but that I shall hereafter have occasion to mention as introductory to something historical and whimsical  It will here easily be perceived I was a great pet which too often produces ignorance and stupidity and ends in misfortunes in short the best part of my little education may be chiefly attributed to the cares and observations of a truly sensible worthy affectionate and amiable mother whose conduct was such as not only to attract but preserve the esteem of all who knew her nor is her  name ever mentioned to this hour by any person who retains the least recollection of her but it is followed by the sigh of affection and true regard and this equally from superiors or inferiors  My idle hours however were not bestowed on marbles cricket or mixing with intimates of my own age and complexionfor except my friend George Forbes I had but few playmatesFor lo a prayerbook was ever in my handthe whole day was employed in reading exhortations and every part of the churchservice So great a proficient was I in repeating it that I was often invited to many families to read prayers This early serious turn gave rise to the particular notice of Mrs Townsend wife of Mr Richard Townsend who lived at the corner of Durhamyard near the west end of the since built Adelphi This lady was remarkable for exemplary piety accompanied with cheerfulness and good humour from which occurred many acts of charity and benevolence My father had such attraction as a preacher that she would not have missed the Savoychurch on a Sunday on any account no slight indisposition could keep her away though from a bad state of health the Savoychurch was the only place she visited unless on some particular occasion not to be dispensed withThis good old lady was  own sister to the late Jonas Hanway a gentleman universally known and esteemed for his many benevolent acts With this said sister Mr Jonas Hanway  ived many years He had been a friend of my father's continued his good will to me and was indefatigable in the Spring in removing the objections started by Lord Sondes in regard to my obtaining acts of Parliament for the York and Hull patents For unless Mr Jonas Hanway's influence and perseverance had prevailed on his Lordship to withdraw his opposition which at that time from his situation and consequence in the House had great weight it would have prevented in all probability my having acquired the honour and credit of either Captain Hanway the brother of Jonas was married by my father to Miss Stowe the then reigning toast of NewarkuponTrent  Besides the Townsends' constant attendance to their religious duties at the Savoy amongst my father's pious admirers as a preacher I remember Mrs Graham late Mrs Yates never missed her pew near the pulpit Mr Yates now living was a frequent attendant and can and will testify that Dr Wilkinson's manner of reading and preaching commanded respect and admiration His discourses were excellent his voice clear strong and sonorous and his person graceful and handsome  The few remaining persons who knew him then will now verify what I advance for though only resident six weeks at Wakefield and that not less than fortyfive years ago yet his manner of preaching and forcible oratory c had such strong effects as to be well recollected at that place to this hour and was often mentioned by the late Sir Michael Pilkington who was at that time his intimate  I being forcibly struck with my father's manner in the several church services was never easy unless I had an old surplice thrown over my shoulders and my whole delight was in praying▪ preaching burials c I was generally locked up in a room supposing it a church and in a large chair the bottom taken out went through the morning or evening service as it happened to occur in the course of the day then replacing the chair bottom and throwing off the old surplice of my father's that had just before occupied my shoulders I mounted and leaned over the back of the said chair and with mighty authority proceeded with the sermon several of which discourses were my father's  My father was much pleased with this preaching turn and on his hearing from Mrs Townsend my mother and several others how remarkably well I read prayers and by all universally allowed  to be the father's own son in voice manner energy c he pronounced Tate would make a great figure if brought up to the church  As it occurs to me this moment so I am certain it will to my reader who will ask How could you Mr Tate so audibly go on with this practice of preaching and praying aloud under the same roof with your father and without his knowledge That is easily answeredFor know good Sir or Madam the house we then occupied was large enough for three modern ones old double stone staircases and were truly the apartments of King John of France  See the History of the Savoy  when he was prisoner in England So I had always apartments which I called my own and they were in consequence appropriated to my religious rites  My father on the intelligence he had received of my pious inclinations importuned me to read prayers the litany c by way of sample to corroborate what he had heard from Mrs Townsend my mother and others I cheerfully complied and on hearing me he much approved and said he judged my seeing plays might aid my strong inclination as well as contribute and assist me in the mode of public speaking Now reader don't suppose this fond father and mother  were wicked playgoersI do not remember ever hearing of their being at three plays in their whole lives Most probably had that been the case a playhouse would have been familiarized to my ear Not that I mean to convey they had a dislike to plays indeed quite the reverse But my father's affairs were generally in an embarrassed state and my mother's pocket too much deranged to allow money for such an entertainment consequently tho' she admired and approved of a good play she was contented with the reading instead of seeing it However they both wished to have Tate see a play But having been when five years old with my father at a puppetshew at BartholemewFair which I thought a play I there saw a sea fight and a most terrible battle which determined me never to see one againtherefore all proposals to go to the Theatre were in vain  When about eight years old chance threw a Mr Page in my way He was then Housekeeper of CoventGarden Theatre known at that time only by  "Which house do you go to this eveningthe New House or the Old"  Drury Lane Mr Page wished for some place then in the power of Lord Cholmondley with whom my father was intimate and to ingratiate himself the more finding neither Dr Wilkinson nor his wife visited  either old or new house he observed it was a pity Master Tate should not enjoy the diversions of the theatreWhen I heard this conversation I felt an inconceivable objection and dreaded the being forced into so terrible a place My mother observed that Tate would think of prayers only and could not be persuaded to set his foot in a theatre but on afterreflection they observed at what an easy rate from the civility of Mr Page this entertainment could be procured they determined to conquer my obstinacy by force So after my repeated refusals my reverend dad at last grew really angry and insisted on my going there with this conditional salvo that if I was not pleased he pledged his honour he would never urge me to see another I choked with grief assented to this cruelty as I really thought it was and when from the Savoy I had with slow steps arrived at Southamptonstreet I grew sulky and the servant to whom I was intrusted had actually to drag me to CoventGarden Theatre On seeing Mr Page the man being in livery Master Tate could not be let into the boxes or pit this I esteemed a lucky circumstance to favour my return indeed had I been left to myself soon would I have saluted the Savoy steps but the man wishing to see the play during this new started difficulty kept me fast as his prisoner I was  conveyed with him and safely stowed in the upper gallery instead of receiving pleasure sighs and sobs employed my time in this terrible place Neither the noble theatre nor the music had any charms for me the whistling of the gods and other noises of the gallery only added to my disgust and terror The play I well remember was the Busy Body with Mr Foote's TeaBut O reader of what materials are we composedscarcely had the first act finished before I imagined I was in the elysium I had been praying for the charms of the church which the day before were so attractive and sublime were dissolved  And like the baseless fabric of a Vision  Left not a wreck behind  The theatre from that time banished all my servent piety and my whole thoughts were occupied with the fascinating charms of the playhouse actors and actresses My fatherO wicked man says one of the mock saints was pleased with the change and said he was sure it would be the means of making me a better preacher I now reversed my late tabernacleand employed my evenings in lighting pieces of candle dressing in any fantastical attire and repeated as well as I could recollect parts in plays I had seen which that Spring were nine in number From early in January to March I took  great care to visit Mr Page every morning for play bills and was a constant attendant by permission at the morning rehearsals In March I was sent to Mr Tempest's school near Wandsworth where a nephew and two sons of Mr Page's were placed and I saw no more plays till the Winter following  At the time I have now mentioned seeing plays at CoventGarden Theatre Mr Quin had retired to Bath from whence he wrote the following laconic note in November  I am at Bath  Yours JAMES QUIN  Which note was as laconically answered  Stay there and be damn'd  Yours JOHN RICH  Every actor of consequence was engaged by Mr Garrick for DruryLane except the Mr Quin just mentioned This was Garrick's first year a  manager At Covent Garden▪ in the mont  of February they only acted three times in the week and frequently dismissed and were in truth a wretched company and low in public estimation Mr Foote's Tea which he had given as an entertainment at CoventGarden Theatre in February he had first acted in at the  Hay Market it was then called The Diversions of the Morning attended with great good fortune and every success his most sanguine wishes could suggest but this being noticed by the Patentees of DruryLane and CoventGarden as an entertainment started in defiance of the severe act about that time passed when Lord Chesterfield had observed in the House of Lords  "How cruel it was to lay a tax on so scarce a commodity as wit""Wit" continues Lord Chesterfield "is a sort of property of those that have it and too often the only property they have to depend onIt is indeed but a precarious dependenceThank God we my Lords have a dependence of another kind"  Mr Foote had in this moment not only alarmed the treasury of the royal theatres but from his mimicry had roused the indignation and resentment of all the performers Application was made in consequence to the Lord Chamberlain who sent to the justices of that district and the new raised troops were put to flight by a superior force of constables entering the theatre in terrible array The audience was dismissedand the laughing Aristophanes left leaning towards Melpomene in doleful soliloquy  After many days anxiety from suffering this disgrace a lucky thought occurred to himBeing  certain of the good will of the Town he advertised  "Mr Foote's compliments to his friends and the public desiring them to drink Tea at the Little Theatre at the HayMarket every morning at the playhouse prices"  The joke succeededthe house was crowdedand he advanced before the curtainbeing privately assured of protection his friends having been previously convened and informed of his intention and saidThat while the Tea was preparing as he was then training some young actors for the stage he would with their permission proceed with his instructions This manoeuvre was highly relished and it became the universal fashion every noon to drink a dish of Mr Foote's Tea and for two or three years he termed pieces of imitation  giving of Tea  And thence arose the puzzle which often happened to myself some years after on my giving Tea and it frequently started difficulties and chagrin to a country audience  The run of this morning's diversion occasioned the actors one and all to exclaim they should be ruined by his mimicry therefore Mr Foote very pleasantly said Since that was the case it was his duty to provide a situation for each lady and gentleman so circumstanced and that instead of murdering blank verse and assuming the characters of Kings and Queens Lords and Ladies  for which their abilities were far from being suitable he would place them where their talents and behaviour could with more propriety be employed  Mr QUINfrom his sonorous voice and weighty manner he appointed  a Watchman  AS THUS  "Past twelve o'clock and a cloudy morning"  Mr DELANEwas supposed to have but one eye therefore he fixed him as  a Beggar Man in St Paul's Churchyard  "Would you bestow your pity on a poor blind man"  Mr RYANwhose voice for oddity and shrillness was remarkable  a Razor Grinder  "Razors to grind scissars to grind penknives to grind"  Mrs WOFFINGTONthough beautiful to a degree had a most unpleasant squeaking pipe  an Orange Woman to the Playhouse  "Would you have some orangeshave some orange chips ladies and gentlemenwould you have some nonpareilswould you have a bill of the play"  Mr WOODWARDhe was puzzled to find any trade he was fit for therefore spoke the following speech in his voice and manner from Sir Fopling Flutter  "Wherever I go there goes a gentlemanupon my life a gentleman and when you have said a gentleman why O  here Foote dropt Woodward's voice and manner  you have said more than is true"  He was also very severe on GARRICK who was apt to hesitate in his dying scenes in particular as in the character of Lothario  "adorns my fall and cheacheacheacheacheachears my heart in dydydying"  Foote's Tea remembered by me so well from that time when I became advanced in life made it seem strange that almost every person two hundred miles from the metropolis was not as well acquainted with it as myself who had lived in London without considering my long residence there had stamped a stronger remembrance on me than on three parts out of four of the rest of the inhabitants of that city  To elucidate this matter I need only instance Mr Foote's pieces even of modern date most of  them strongly pointed animated and bold in the drawing not destitute of great wit in the composition and pleasing to a degree in the representationyet being local and at the same time merely drawn for reflections on the follies of the day their merit and claim to support cannot prevent their posting to oblivion while for years to come we shall behold pieces of inferior merit only aided by flimsy insipid mediocrity proceed with dulness and make their exit with a natural decay Elizabeth Canning Mary Squires the gipsey and Miss Blandy were such universal topics in that you would have supposed it the business of mankind to talk only of them yet now in ask a young man of twentyfive or thirty a question relative to these extraordinary personages and he will be puzzled to answer and will say  "What mean you by enquiringI do not understand you"  The following lines from Mr Foote's prologue of will prove how occurences are remembered or forgotten  The many various objects that amuse  T is busy curious time by way of news  Are pl  ys▪ elections murders lott'ries Jews  All these com  unded fly throughout the nation  And set t  e whole in one great fermentation  T  ue Bri  sh  earts the same high spirits show  Be they to damn a farce or fight a foe  One day for liberty the Briton fires  The next he flamesfor Canning or for Squires  In like extremes your laughing humour flows  Have you not roar'd from pit to upper rows  And all the jest waswhata fiddler's nose  "The person here in  ended is Mons Cervetti engag  d at DruryLane many years before the trial of Elizabeth Canning who has been a standing joke with the uppergallery for a long time past on account of the length of his nose but as I am informed that no features of his mind are out of proportion unless it be that his good qualities are extraordinary I take this opportunity to mention that it is cruel to render him uneasy in the business in which he is eminent and by which he must get a livelihood"  Note  Foote's Prologue    Pursue your mirth each night the joke grows stronger  For as you fret the man his nose looks longer  And strange to add that  Nosey  from the use of being loudly called for in is still retained by the galleries particularly at present in the York circuit where without compliment the leader is a man of great professional merit but has a nose as much too long as the manager's is too short  The Tea of mine for two or three years after I first went on the stage I judged would be an encrease of lasting success although the season when Mr Foote was at CoventGarden giving his Tea proved that though a blazing comet two years before all attraction was over the wonder had ceased and no longer brought grist  to his mill Now let the tide be ever so strong yet those ladies or gentlemen whether favoured by Melpomene or Thalia if they flatter themselves with thinking like Alonzo  Seen for ever yet for ever new  will find themselves deceived and will fail in two points unless they attend to prudence and oeconomy and by those means secure an independence which will greatly add to the continuance of fashion beyond its natural flirtation And as a weak constitution is often prolonged by strict attention to preservativesso the performer who is secure in purse may look big and frighten the folks with a threat of  "I will leave the stage"  Besides what a happiness it is to have a reserve against  The thousand ills that flesh is heir to  In the early part of the winter I was brought from Wandsworth to keep my birthday on the th of October and again after Christmas to see two plays then again at Whitsuntide to see Mrs Woffington in Sir Harry Wildair and Apollo and Daphneand Harlequin get into a quart bottle being the year of the Bottle Conjuror I complained of great severity indeed as my father and mother had been so cruel as to keep me nine months out of the twelve at school  This season was much superior to the former one  at CoventGarden as Mr Quin returned from his Bath retirementMr Delane and Mr Luke Sparks from DruryLanealso Mrs Woffingtonand from Dublin Mrs Ward and Mifs Bellamy who made her first appearance in BelvideraThe following bill will give an idea of the company  By the COMPANY of COMEDIANS  At the  THEATREROYAL in  CoventGarden    This present Monday being the th of

Curtain is drawn up  PLACES for the BOXES to be taken of Mr PAGE at the Stagedoor of the THEATRE  N B These Persons were  then  in their Prime but are all  since  dead  When in town every morning by Mr Page's permission I attended the rehearsal There the desire to become an actor at only ten years of age appeared very conspicuous and will fully prove and clear an error conceived by Mr Churchill who was afterwards convinced to the contrary that Mr Foote instructed me in the art of imitation which was neither truth nor within the bounds of possibility My frequent morning's admittance at the theatre for two years intoxicated my brain and when I returned from that to me most luxurious treat my mind was solely employed with acting and studying plays particularly those I had seen and which had made the deepest impression I formed a mad idea thus early that I was certainly a manager of a theatre and when locked up in a room I there supposed myself by turns the different persons I had observed This rehearsing frenzy increased to such a degree that at last I fitted up a room in a theatrical manner as a proof I have now several hundred of my playbills in fullsized paper wrote in red and black and could at this instant as easily tell what plays farces and pantomimes were performed at my theatre in the Savoy with a knowledge of all the performers whether married single old or young and what they played as if all the vision had been realizedThe bills I have often produced  not as a proof of my sense but insanity or theatrical influenza  The rehearsals that year were very regular at CoventGarden The scenes for Volpone Henry IV and their stock plays for at that house they seldom acted new ones or revived old ones were regularly changedand all was awful silenceMr Quin was sole monarch and had a manner most terrible to the under performers carpenters c if he spied me within two yards of the wings  "Get away boy"  and struck his cane with such violence as made me tremble  Mrs Woffington had that year left David Garrick for more reasons than oneFirst she had before he proved a false swain lived with the charming Garrick who wrote a favourite song called  Lovely Peggy    Once more I'll tune the vocal shell  O'er hills and dales my passion tell c  She was mortified at his marriage for she lost the reigning sway she expected to have had in sharing the cares of monarchyMrs Pritchard's division of characters hurt her and Mrs Clive who was superior to fear was a constant thorn So much has been said of Mrs Woffington that it is needless to mention her Lady Townly Lady Betty cAn elegant figure in breechesshe looked and acted Sir Harry Wildair with such spirit  and deportment that she gave flat contradiction to what Farquhar assertedThat when Wilks died Sir Harry Wildair might go to the Jubileeand yet so far has his prophecy been fully verified no male performer even Garrick or Woodward succeeded but all have failed in that part she repeated it with never ceasing applause for several years Her ex  ellence when at DruryLane occasioned the following joke which I do not give as new but hope it will bear the repeating  Dame Clive and that lady were ever at variance Mrs Woffington coming into the greenroom after a favourite scene in Sir Harry in high spirits exultingly said to Mrs CliveShe had got so much applause that by the living God she believed one half of the audience took her for a man  "O"says Clive  archly  "do not be uneasy as you are satisfied the other half know the contrary"  The early part of this season I had been at a correct rehearsal of the Careless HusbandLord Foppington Mr Cibber Sir Charles Easy Mr Ryan Lord Morelove Mr Delane Lady Easy Mrs Ward Lady Graveairs Mrs Hale Edging Mrs Ridout Lady Betty Modish Mrs Woffingtonafter which I hastened home to repeat what I could recollect My mother observing me so particular stood at the room door to listen as she thought she heard a talking and  hearing me pronounce in a strange voice  "My Lord Foppington give me my snuffbox"  She after dinner desired to know what I was talking of when shut up by myself I was rather perplexed and saidI had fancied all that day I was sometimes Mr Cibber but oftener Mrs Woffington as she had acted Lady Betty delightfully On this she sent for the play and I studied different parts of it and also the first scene of Sir John and Lady Brute which I had seen that winter I was then I believe very like Mr Quin and Mrs Woffington nay am certain I was as I can repeat the same at this instant in like manner a proof what force first impressions make in the days of our youth  This soon produced when I was visiting abroad or when we had company at home an intreaty for Master Tate to act Mr Quin and Mrs Woffington The applause of the company added fuel to the flameDruryLane Theatre I did not see till the season and strange to tell did not wish to go there so strongly was I attached to sweet CoventGardenand a something like hallowed ground to this moment occasions reverence and awe for the steps and avenues of that theatre A full house at CoventGarden then was pleasing intelligenceThe preference and success  f Garrick and DruryLane I could not relish  This employment I pursued with unremitting slavery even to the prejudice of health  In September I had an ague and fever which could not be conquered but kept me confined all the winter except being permitted to see three plays Lady Jane Grey was one and to this moment I recollect Quin saying in Gardiner  "I hold no speech with hereticks and traitors"  September was the remarkable year Barry and Cibber joined forces with Quin and Woffington at CoventGarden as also Macklin On seeing Mr Barry and Mrs Cibber lessened in my opinion the merit I had alone allowed to my first favorites Mr Quin and Mrs Woffington The run of Romeo and Juliet was that season when the famous controversy happened between the two houses on account of this play and which commenced at both Theatres on Friday the th of September The following is an exact bill of the CoventGarden play  By the COMPANY of COMEDIANS  At the  THEATREROYAL in  CoventGarden  This present Friday being the th of Sept will be presented a Play call'd  ROMEO AND JULIET  The Part of  Romeo  to be  performed By Mr BARRY  Being the first Time of his Appearing on that Stage

saw at DruryLane was that yearit was the Mourning BrideOsmyn Mr Garrick Zara Mrs Pritchard Almeria Miss BellamyGarrick was not in my secret opinion so enchanting as BarryMiss Bellamy very inferior indeed to Mrs Cibberbut Mrs Pritchard's Zara struck me with admiration The farce was Lethe in which the characters were so inimitably performed by Woodward Yates Shuter Blakes Miss Minors and Mrs Clive that I felt actually angry at myself for being so pleased with the performers of the Old House when in a comparative view with my favorites of the New I mention this as an instance of the force of obstinate and headstrong partiality whether we are young or old and am sorry to observe that conviction or reason will not conquer our prejudices as we grow old any more than prevail over the sentiments of waxen youth  The Winter of I saw several plays and for fear of being tainted with the prevailing powers of DruryLane entered not that fashionable p  ace of resort The end of the season Mr Quin left the stage the opening play in the September following was the Recruiting Officer at CoventGarden Mrs Woffington's name was inserted for Sylvia but on some sudden  disagreement she went off for Ireland and a Mrs Vincent performed the part  In October was Mr Mossop's and Mr Ross's first appearance at DruryLane in the characters of Richard and young Bevil I passed my time as the preceding season only with this difference that I attended both Theatres they closed as usualIn the Autumn what I had ardently wished for two years before came to pass as my being sent to Harrow School was put into real practice by my coming to the age of thirteen the ensuing th of Nov being the year of the New Style This when at a distance I thought pleasing but for a Manager a Critic to be sent to school was a stroke of real grief and horror my pride prevented me from owning the truth for I had sometime before petitioned for this indulgence therefore would not let my veracity or resolution be called in questionSo O woeful day to Harrow School I was conveyed by my mother where on seeing my friend George Forbes I endeavoured to compose myself and submit to slavery He introduced me to the Duke of Gordon and his brother Lord Adam Gordon also at that school which was then second only to Eaton in this kingdom were Lord Downe Sir John Russiate and the Capt Dives's to whom I have been much obliged But  instead of the place becoming more easy by habit the manager rose strongly in my heated imaginationStudying a play was the employment of a man but going to school the God of Idleness convinced me was intolerableI therefore resolved on a retreat not doubting but if I related to my mother that I had seen three boys whipt she would relent and receive me home again and soften all resentment from my father who humoured me to a greater degree than she did herself but when he was in a passion which thank God was but seldom it was dreadful To execute with wisdom and discretion such a dangerous undertaking the good the unfortunate Andrée used not more precautionI waited for a public holiday and loading my pockets with oranges and gingerbread the night before got up at six in the morning and proceeded down HarrowHill unfortunately not being accustomed to the road I turned to the right and every now and then looked up to spy if any one was pursuing me so strong is guilt  Suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind  The thief doth fear each bush an officer  Having walked for some time I read on a stone  "One mile to Partington"  or some such name I was alarmed and hastened back to my old  ground the bottom of the hill If I looked behind and saw a man on horseback I was sure he was in pursuit of me I soon reached the fifth milestone where some men were at work on the roads here I was again puzzled by a separation of two broad carriageways and fearing a second blunder said  "Pray good men which is the road to London" "Why" says one of them"to the left but I am afraid young gentleman you have run away from school""No indeed" says I and to convince him he was wrong took the only method to prove him quite in the right by immediately taking to my heels The men laughed a  d cried "Catch himstop him"  I was truly a frightened hare After stumbling running c at last I was obliged from sickness and great fatigue to stop but finding no pursuers in about ten minutes I continued my journey and got safe into London When advanced beyond the purlieus I stopped at a coffeehouse and breakfasted One danger being over I now began when hunger was satisfied to feel other qualms which were the approach of home I walked very slow and got to the Savoy just as the bell was ringing for prayers I sauntered till it ceased well knowing that my father was then secure and for fear of mistake took a peep to be certain that he read the prayers That point being settled to my satisfaction  I rapped at the door and soon with perfect ease asked my mother how she didHer surprise was greatall my relation of cruelties and whipping the little boys would not avail she expostulated on the great expence of the entrance to the masters as Dr Thackerey Mr Prior csaid she would soften the matter as well as she couldbut back I must goI was ordered to retire and on so doing my reflections were by no means the most pleasant When commanded into the presence of my father I was conditionally pardoned but after a bit of dinner for which I had not the least appetite a chaise was ordered and a servant sent with me who was to stop the carriage at the bottom of Harrow Hill in order if possible that my difgrace of running away might be a secret This I was obliged to submit to and I arrived at the fatal spot like a culprit prepared for execution but when I came to the borders of the village I soon heard the warhoop of Indians and perceived almost the whole school assembled and ready to tar and feather me for my flight  From many tokens of intelligence and searching enquiries I was soon discovered to have been more than merely out of bounds I therefore like a poor deserter wanted no more than handcuffs to make my appearance and contrition truly  in character when like a god my friend George Forbes appeared who was held in great respect and esteem drew me from my disagreeable situation and under his arm conveyed me safe to Mr Reeves's the writing master house where I was boarded and delivered me from the hands of the Philistines Mr and Mrs Reeves were of a a genteel turn and what do you think good reader better than thatthey were critics and fond of plays and what was better still Mrs Reeves's sister then on a visit was play and romance mad but at this time of distress I was not acquainted with those delightful circumstances however they were kind not austere upon my disgrace and Mr Reeves interfered to prevent the deserter's corporal punishment but the adventure reached the ear of Admiral Forbes who fearing my bad example might have an ill effect on his newphew over whom he judged I had great influence which might occasion his taking a trip over to Dublin to see  his mamma  insisted on my being made an example of terror by way of prevention  Dr Thackerey was as benign and humane a man as ever was placed at the head of such an unruly community as a public school but the Reverend Prior loved to lift his arm up for the awful flogging better than Fielding's Parson Thwackum and judged himself robbed of his  rights when he was prevented from putting in force his love of torture he was in truth a despicable severe and disagreeable tyrant But on the hint being given while he went out of the great schoolroom I believe I might be speaking a little too loud when the head scholar ordered me to stand before the throne and am sorry to say except from my friend George Forbes I perceived universal exultation for the lad that runs away is looked on like the cowardly soldier who retires on the day of battle Soon entered Governor Prior who with exulting features ordered me to be prepared and brought immediately to the block and to strike terror desired attention to his skill on the occasion and as what must be must  e I patiently resigned to my cruel fate He never acted the barbarian better  The blood did follow where the rod was driven  The flesh did quiver where the birchen tore  But that was foreign to the soul  Not all his strokes or energetic arm  Cou'd force a gr  an away that he might guess at  This proved in fact a most lucky adventureas misfortunes past prove stories of delight for when school was over I was generally saluted and applauded for my heroism and from that time was on good terms with all the scholars My boardinghouse became every day more satisfactory  for my fond mother to keep me easy under my bondage after such a life of indulgence as I had been accustomed to was even near in her family expences and denied herself what was absolutely necessary in order to send Tate luxuries such as tea sugar nice chickens bottles of wine pound cake c with the playbills of the week those presents I gave to Mrs Reeves which occasioned an intimacy and my sitting up to supper this brought on stage conversation and from that I was asked whenever they had company to act plays So considering myself as a manager in distress the time passed tolerably pleasant till December We had only one dispute which was Mr Reeves's pronouncing Garrick not only the best actor but what was more intolerable the best Romeo to which I must have yielded had not the wife declared entirely on my side of the argument and wondered her husband could make such a comparisonthe sister avowed the same and they both agreed that Barry was a charming man and made love like an angel to which I assented and significantly said It was not worth contending for it really was not every one that saw a play who was a perfect judge of acting  It may not be improper to observe how necessary it is to make every one a wellwisher instead of an enemyFriends are happy circumstances  they are the foundationstone of human greatness from the highest to the lowestcivility is worth the preserving for if offended a Star and Garter may find himself hurt by the rudeness of a blackguard Therefore as many friends as possible it is our interest to procure provided they can be gained without descending to meannessA few insignificant enemies are not amiss they rouse the spirits to action and vigour while the kindness of friends and selflove are so far from improving the mental faculties that they only act on the understanding as laudanum and all real genius is lulled into lethargy and sluggishness  From my civility to Mrs Reeves's sister I was not only made of some little consequence at Harrow but the sequel will prove it led to an  important  part of my future life  While at Mr Reeves's a theatrical fête was to be given before the Christmas holidays in the great schoolroom as the custom had been for some years to act three nights before that period to which all the families from Stanmore and the adjacent villages were invited the room was very commodious for such a purpose Shapes were borrowed from Mr Rich who it seems always obliged the school on such occasions Dr Thackerey the good governor fixed on the Roman Father for the leading scholars to enact  The first night the play was presented I was an auditor but Mrs Reeves and her sister were stung to the quick their pride was hurt to think their favourite boarder and such a promising actor had not a chance for fame and a share of the applause at this public time  Mrs Reeves's sister felt herself so unhappy on this trivial matter that she waited on Dr Thackerey with me in her hand and requested I might reh  arse Lord and Lady Townly which the Doctor goodnaturedly assented to and I instantly performed Lord Townly  alamode  BarryLady Townly  alamode  Woffington which actually broke through the buckram of the college and the Doctor's accustomed solemnity and he and his good woman laughed very heartily for though he never saw more than three or four plays in a year and that during the Christmas recess the transition of voice and manner from Barry to Woffington pleased the Doctor so much that he actually sent for his eldest son Frederick and desired him to study the first scene of Lord Townly and ordered it to precede the Roman Father the next playnight to which Mr Frederick like a good son acquiesced promised to be perfect bowed retired and kept his word Mrs Reeves's sister and I returned in triumph and after congratulations of success on our embassy much consultation was necessary  for the equipment and the attire of Lady Townly as if a matter of the utmost importance What they could not furnish me with was borrowed from their connexions in the neighbourhood and with infinite pains attended to the manner and taste they were to shew on the  entree  of the new performer  After not less than three hours in the equipment a chair which I wonder at in so small a place was to be hired to convey me to HarrowTheatre and not I assure you without some emotion not that my first acting seemed distressing nor was it particular my playing Lady Townly as two young gentlemen of family personated Horatia and Valeria and as to dress my English attire as much surpassed the Roman ladies on this occasion as Mrs Bellamy's new Parisdress is asserted by her to have outshone Mrs Woffington's when they acted the Rival Queens However not having in reality played before any number of persons fit to be termed an audience it gave me a tremor natural to all young actors My performance was so much superior and so infinitely more like a theatrical one than that of the young gentlemen who acted in the Roman Father that I bore away the palm notwithstanding Publius was represented by a Lord Nor is it to be wondered at as they played only from an  established custom of the school therefore merely judged it a pleasing relief as by so doing for ten or twelve days they relinquished the dryer studies of Greek and Latin but no more likely to make a figure as actors without the possession of the God than those young persons were who are related to have acted with Garrick when he was a child at Litchfield for they as his playmates performed merely from civility and compliance to his will whilst we may venture to pronounce  his  whole soul was in agitation  The effect of my Lady Townly was surprising indeed so much so that every one of the audience spoke to me with marks of attention and an universal request was made the next night the last of playing that I would not only oblige them with Lady Townly but some other part to try my skill in contrastfor they were pleased to add that every one was delighted and those phrases are not to be wondered at as the speeches of parents and neighbours at a school play I do not imagine any one night of real success when even attended with the  pe  unia  ever gave me more exquisite pleasurejoy without measure to feel myself on such a public occasion the first mark of attention as a theatrical performer at a place of such consequence as Harrow School  The request of the additional performance the  ensuing playnight which had my secret and eager wishes of compliance Dr Thackerey not only assented to but gave his approbation I being attached to Mr Barry's acting fixed on the gardenscene in Romeo and Juliet to precede the Roman Father and Lady Townly after the play But here a difficulty started which was no less than the want of a Juliet for though Mr Frederick Thackerey had consented to be Lord Townly he would not submit to be my Juliet This occasioned a demur but Sir John Russiate on hearing of the obstacle removed all inconvenience by obligingly offering himself for Juliet and this mighty matter was immediately concluded and as speedily put into practice but as I did not suppose a man of quality could be so good a performer as myself I therefore managerlike taught Sir John some of Mrs Cibber's striking manner in the particular passageswhich did not a little add to my selfopinion The third night finished to the extent of my ambitionI  looked talked walked  and  felt  myself a great actorSuch Things Were Such Things Are and Such Things may be yet to come as must decide whether my play of life will end with All in the Right or All in the Wrong If All in the Right I shall then conclude like Panglos  "That All has been for the Best"  On my return to supper at Mr Reeves's they were as proud and pleased as if their own son had met with the same approbation Indeed my thanks were due to themfor this little esteem which I acquired at the school c certainly was owing not only to their thought but they had even gone lengths beyond their situation in accomplishing a matter that required some degree of difficulty and address Every one who turns over these leaves will reflect how fortunate it was for me to be boarded with a family that would condescend to humour me had I been placed in a morose boardinghouse bred up as I had been  or rather not bred at all I must have led the life of a sulky Negro slaveBut better things thank God were in store  I cannot quit Harrow for the Christmas recess without recollecting that my stage success as I then termed it at that place occasioned serious reflections from the wise directors For my exhibition from the peculiarity of what I attempted was the groundwork of public conversation in the circle of Harrow critics it was therefore judged truly necessary to convene a cabinet council which was directly summoned where it was agreed on mature deliberation  nemine  tradicente  not in future to have any more plays  cted by the young gentlemen at Harrow School The annual custom was therefore abolished and I  am told that law has been strictly adhered to from that time to this as they feared it might get the appellation of and an idle report be circulated in the world that it was a school for breeding up actors in lieu of scholars Though without doubt since that period private plays having been so very fashionable many changes of opinion must have occurred for the improvement of that little state since my happy acting there in Dec but I judge had the ancient custom been revived and tolerated the newspapers or some chance intelligence would have before this fully informed me Adieu to HarrowHill and hey for the Christmas holidays Savoy and Plays  I was received at home as usual with fondness and partiality even to a fault If asked a question relative to the progress I had made in my learning I quickly answered it with relating the fine play we had performed and that was sufficient but more so when I assured them I was the leading actor and father and mother were so pleased they determined Tate should not be disappointed of his darling amusement I visited as soon as possible my favourite palaces of DruryLane and CoventGarden and if money was ever so shor  at home it was raised by some means no matte  how difficult  I particularly recollect seeing on Saturday th th of December the Siege of DamascusPhocyas  Barry  Eumenes  Ryan  Caled  Sparks  Abudah  Ridout  Eudocia Mrs  Cibber  with the dances of  Il Pastore  and  Il Morlaco  by Signor  Maranesi  and Signora  Bugiani  two excellent dancersby the bye the dances at that time were greatly supported very different from what they are at the Theatres now  Cooke  and  Hilliard  both in a first degree were added to the  Maranesi  and the  Bugiani  The entertainment was Apollo and Daphne by command of his Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales who seldom went to DruryLane what were the reasons to have occasioned a disgust I cannot give or even guess atHad it been out of compliment to old Quin who had the instruction of his present Majesty in his youth it might in some measure have accounted for it as Quin often exclaimed on being told that his Majesty delivered his maiden speech with gracefulness and precision  "Ay I knew it would be sofor  I  taught the boy to speak"  But in that cause had ceased as Quin had retired in the spring to Bath and quitted the stage but the Prince's partiality continued  On Monday January Mr Smith made his first  entr  e  in the character of Theodosius or the Force of LoveVaranes Barry Athenaïs Mrs Cibber it was repeated the Tuesday Wednesday  and Thursday following Mr Smith's first benefit was on Saturday April the Siege of Damascus  When the drum beat for marching orders to the camp at Harrow I feigned sickness very well and by continuing at home I was at the height of bliss Mr and Mrs Reeves were on account of their civilities to me at Harrow constant visitors at my father's during the recess Mr Wier gentleman to Sir Francis Delaval was smitten with my friend Mrs Reeves's sister  the Lass of the Hill  and Dr Wilkinson was appointed to perform the holy ritesI was father on the occasion and gave her awayI remember it was a cheerful evening with us all and a genteel supper was ordered by Sir Francis Delaval and so ended the marriage with the usual ceremony  My attention to the stage was truly unremittingit was my daymy lifeand it is not to be wondered at that my imitations when really produced on the stage were thought superior to Mr Garrick's or Mr Foote's For those particular actors and actresses whose manner and voice I so strongly presented to the public were taken on the truest ground that of feeling myself at the time the person I imitated and not exaggerated into buffooneryand this was my work my toil my constant practice for some years before I played in  London My mode was that as ideal manager I appointed myself to act Lord Townly Now except Lady Townly Lady Grace and Mr Manly for I played all the parts had each a different voice and manner it did not please the buildings of my fancy unless that I had performers supposed to be under my command as thus  Lord Townly as Mr Barry  Going out so soon after dinner Madam  Lady Townly as Mrs Woffington  Lard my Lord what can I possibly do at home  Manly as Mr Sparks  Yes Madam in rather turning myself out of doors than her  Lady Grace as Mrs Elmy  Don't you think that would be going too far  Manly as Mr Sparks  I don't know but it might Madamfor in strict justice I think she ought rather to go than I c  A stranger on those occasions to have been at the door would have thought that four or five persons were gathered together and were rehearsing a play I had so habituated myself to this fluctuation of voice and to move and change my features to those of the actors and actresses I judged myself personating that from impulsive enthusiasm for I cannot think of another word I felt as if each individual I spoke and acted like were at that instant under the restrictions and reverence  due to a real audience of the most collected and fashionable consequence and  My fiction and dream of passion  Did work my soul up to its own conceit  That from its fancy all my visage warm'd  My whole function  uiting  With forms to my conceit  When this thought is supported by an applauding audience it becomes more truly relished than an auditor or reader can suppose For the best actor that ever trode the stage as Betterton Booth Wilks Cibber Quin Garrick Barry or Kemble if not supported by encouragement would still have remained himself  not  the character he represented unless happily thrown off his guard by the smiles and applause of the public which bestowed  "On silken wings sublime he cuts the air"  and is in reality the monarch he then represents The same aid the same comfort makes the comedian as well as the tragedian but not in so great a degree as circumstances differ widelya smile only will cheer a drooping comedian but the  ame smile is immediate death to the tragic hero  At the end of the season May Mrs Cibber left CoventGarden and Barry lost his Juliet but s  on provided himself anotherA Miss Nossiter made her first appearance in that character on Wednesday the th of October▪  Miss Bellamy returned to CoventGarden but her first appearance was very different from what she relates in her memoirs  I will put a stop for the present to Theatrical Anecdotes as well as of my family and self and must here intreat leave to introduce a little history of  LADY CORNWALLIS'S FATHER  a year before its real date that it may not intervene too much with that part of my life which on reflection from that hour to my last will be truly interesting to my feelings and I doubt not but it will claim and obtain the tear of pity Amongst the variety of our acquaintance and visitors my mother's most constant intimate was a Mrs Jones wife of Captain James Jones of his Majesty's third regiment of guards who lived in the house allotted for the superintendant officer in the SavoySquare and not above two hundred yards from ou  dwelling As a private family history this tale might be thought intruding tiresome and impertinent but when I announce Capt James Jones as the father of the  late Lady Cornwallis  I hope I shall be permitted to proceed and be honoured with attention nor will his Lordship I trust be offended with any matter I shall here insert for I pronounce that it is the pen of Truth which writes this relation of all my various and historical  events and I would rather burn the book than let it be stained with slander What I here respectfully and with diffidence relate I assure myself his Lordship will notcannot be offended at but th  contrary  Curst be the lines howe'er so well they flow  If they but make one single man my foe  At the time I give this short detail of change and chances in Life's  ickle dance I must notice I have been for many years thrown so distant from my ancient friends and patrons and my visits of late when in London were so limited that I know not whether Mrs Jones motherinlaw to Lord Cornwallis is living or dead However if that good Lady is now in our earthly region I take the liberty to mention that the material part such as the grand change in Captain Jones's latter fortune I had from her own lips or rather my mother was honoured with the relation  Captain Jones was of a most accomplished turn of mind to which was added every requisite to constitute the true gentlemana strong understanding wit vivacity and generosity his person well made smart elegant but not handsome I cannot ascertain Capt Jones and his Lady's mode and manners better than by referring the reader  o Fielding's "Capt Booth and his Amelia"  I could suppose Mrs Jones the Amelia in every respect and have my doubts whether Fielding did not take exact measure and actually founded that novel on his knowledge of those two personsNay I could almost swear it for I never can believe that Captain Jones and his Lady would have been so very complaisant as to have studied their very foibles and rush into scenes of distress merely to imitate characters drawn by a novelist  To these worthy persons the world was obliged for a son and daughterThe son Mr James Jones is still living near Whitehaven his estate being in that part of the kingdom Miss Jones the daughter was when a child of a remarkably quick genius and possessed a theatrical turn at eight years old could repeat all the speeches of Juliet with the utmost precision and her father's judgment and attention made her quite correct But Dame Fortune will have her frolics and like a naughty woman makes no scruple of introducing her daughter  Miss  on every occasionNay so abandoned is she that she forces her into the worst as well as the best company and what is truly lamentable no living mortal will ever hear of her death for the wicked jade will live and triumph while the world is a world and she too often from her whims by being an universal  plague obliged Captain Jones to make the verge of the Court his most frequented walksand of course being often weary in body and mind in such walks of recreation and the reflections on this noon lounge he would frequently sit down in a reverie on one of the benches in St James's Park Mrs Chance not her daughter met him one morning and suggested his resting himself on the same bench with General Skelton who was then an entire stranger to him of an ill tempered morose turn like old Rueful in the Natural Son This happened often and by these interviews and chit chat they of course became mutually acquainted as Parkfrequenters to create an appetite for dinner but no more for the General never once asked him to his house or formed any further intercourse In the variety of ups and downs which Capt Jones's spirit and humour occasioned that hydraheaded monster Gaming the origin of most human ills precipitately urged him to the brink of ruin His affairs grew so embarrassed that he found it necessary to have a secret retirement about eight miles from the metropolis near Mortlake upon the Thames and by art and disguise he found means to see his family Some time elapsed when after a long absence he was obliged to appear at St James'sbeing in a hurry to reach that place of royal protection fearing  every instant a rude fisted bailiff he was posting with the eyes of Argus to get within the sacred verge when he was suddenly called on by an audible voice which he took to be that of an acquaintance He did not wish to be near therefore made the best of his way the other continuing in full speed after our Captain fear did not add wings on this occasion for he looked on this fatal demon as one that would so far prove a devil as to plunge him into ruin and irretrieveable distress Finding it impossible to gain the wished for asylum he determined to face his enemy and wheeled about as in a posture of defenceThis short pause soon brought the parties to a state of parley Jones on looking stedfastly on his supposed enemy knew him to be a gentleman of the law and of reputation therefore said  "What is the reason Sir you hazard my resentment by treating me in this rude and contemptible manner""Why" says the lawyer "damn it Jemmy what are you afraid ofI am Mr Brown the  ttorney and have had the pleasure of knowing you for some time""True" said the Captain "but you are not at present one of the most pleasant acquaintance I could wish to meet in my present circumstances"  Mr Brown  "Dear Jones you never were in a greater error for before we part I will make  you confess I am not only equal but superior to any friend you ever had in your life"  Captain Jones  "Indeed"  Mr Brown  "I will prove my assertion therefore without apprehension or surprise let you and I adjourn to the next tavern and the mystery shall be made perfectly clear"  The reader cannot doubt but on this mixture of alarm doubt fear and apprehension Jones's heart beat as quickly from curiosity as it had within a short space done with fear In silence they entered the first house of public invitation that offeredhaving procured a room c after three or four hems stirring the fire and the lawyer guessing at the other's eagerness he for once in his life omitted the law's delay and proceeded to business  Brown  "My dear Sir to ease your suspense and bring the extraordinary cause of our meeting to that conclusion which tends to promote the success and happiness of your life there is an unknown friend anxious for your prosperity and for the welfare of your worthy wife and family therefore let me know the amount that will make your affairs easy and I have authority to assure you it shall be immediately done"  Jones  "I declare Sir  here his features brightened  it is a surprising as well as unexpected  proposal but as I have dipt into fatal debts of honour which I cannot as a gentleman screen I fear when they are known I shall forfeit all the noble intentions of my concealed patron"  Brown  "Fear not even that for your patron's scrutinizing eye has made him well acquainted with every part of your misconduct as well as your nobler and deserving qualities and the latter in his judgment weighs so much superior as to kick the beam with your errors and I feel the happiness at this instant to have it in my power to convince you that you may be free from all terror or inconvenience during life"  Jones  "Good God who can this paragon of friendship beor am I in a dream"  Brown  Term it a dreamand though a very pleasing one you shall wake to the realityBut now let me inform youthat General Skelton has done you this favour"  Jones  "General SkeltonWhy except my chance meetings and conversations in the Park I have little or no acquaintance with him"  Brown  "However it is true"  Jones  "Let me fly this instant to the General to express my rapture acknowledgments and gratitude"  Brown  Not so fast Captainthe General will never speak to you again"  Jones  "Good God this is more incomprehensible than all the rest"  Brown  "Not at all strange as he died last night"  Jones  "Last night It is a romancean Arabian tale"  Brown  "Ay or a Mother Shipton's prophecy and it needs not only your credibility but moreall the fortitude reason and philosophy you can summon to your aid for you must of necessity comply with not a request only but a demand"  Jones  "I hope after this act of unexpected generosity no tie is annexed to expect any compliance that may be a disgrace and oblige me to refuse the benevolence he has honoured me with"  Brown  "Of that you must be the judge and to be plain he had taken a great dislike to the name of Jones and has ordered you to change it"  Jones  "If that be all I will consent to be called any name he may have pleased to appoint or that may have struck his fancybut as Jones is my real name I must be obliged in all transactions to retain it still"  Brown  "Even that may be settled without difficulty as acts of parliament can remove greater obstacles and as you have borne the first surprise like a soldier know my dear friend I made his will and have for some time known the General's secret intentions and with sincere pleasure congratulate  you on being truly and  bona side  left sole heir to all his ample possessions only in return as he had not a son that you by authority resign the name of Jones for Skelton"  Here the joy the rapture of our captain may be imagined much easier than expressed yet what follows will too fully prove how transitory are all human events and the extraordinary fact plead with the feeling heart a sufficient excuse for my insertion of it  Jones immediately with his good genius the honest attorney hastened to Mrs Jones and after the forms of necessary preparation informed her of the glad tidingsThe fortunate Captain and his Lady went with Brown to view the New Palace in Henrietta Street from which place her impatience made her elope to see her friend Mrs Wilkinson in Little BedfordStreet to inform her of these wonderful and delightful particulars  Miss Chudleigh the late Duchess of Kingston at that time a toast in the fashionable circles and who absolutely appeared as a naked Venus at a masquerade given some years since at Somersethouse was a near relation of General Skelton's Being apprized of his death she immediately ordered her carriage and entered the housesecure in her sanguine expectations that not only part but the whole of his estates were left at her will and disposal When the time came for the usual  form of opening the will and Jones was pronounced sole executor the disappointment of Miss Chudleigh burst out in terms exceeding all bounds of delicacyHer rage was excessiveand indeed few would be found who would rejoice at the good fortune of another when opposed to their own loss of election in short unless being too violent from extreme of passion her feelings must be allowed as the result of Natureshe ironically declared the General was an old fool and in his dotage and that Jones and his wife were impudent low upstarts beneath her noticereturned to her coach with a scornful quality toss and was drove furiously home to sigh fume and fret at leisureThis was the exit of that ambitious haughty dame  Here with pleasure we behold after the storms of adversity a serene sky and this accomplished amiable couple surrounded with every prospect of unbounded happiness and promised addition of joys even as their days did grow with a son and daughter possessed of every endowment to make their mutual felicity complete  The house in HenriettaStreet after the solemn and respectful interment of General Skelton was soon new decked they remained there till the summer had made some approach it was then judged necessary on account of business pleasure and inclination to visit his estates left by the  General in Cumberland The son was at school and the Captain his Lady and daughter set off with that kind of selfsatisfaction which such a journey would naturally inspire they safely arrived and for about three weeks seemed not only in an enchanted spot but a paradise and O delightful that paradise their own Unfortunately the Captain wilfully and against the persuasion of his friends would be let down to view a leadmine from which indeed he did return but was instantaneously seized with a disorder of the most malignant and fatal kind which in a few days baffled all skill and he died in the arms of as sensible and endearing a wife as ever blessed a husband or honoured the world Her feelings on this occasion were poignant indeed but by degrees her strength of mind rose superior to her griefher loss was great and irrevocable Fate had signed the warrant and the dreadful stroke had been sustained She curbed the sudden throbs and impulse of her heartNature had claimed her rights and she had been obeyed Mrs Jones reflected that though she had lost her husband her protector yet not many months before had this melancholy event happened in her book of fate she had been left destitute without friends or means of support and that a son and daughter who would now attain rank and affluence would then have been obliged to submit for their  existence to means below their birth talents and education  Mrs Jones's first cares were employed in the further improvement of her daughter's education adding every accomplishment of art to those blessings Nature had bestowed with a profuse and bountiful hand on her darling child a few years completed the pleasing task when the mother introduced her bewitching and attractive daughter under her matron  ing into the more elegant and polished scenes of life Mrs Jones was of a most lively and entertaining disposition when once more returned to mix with the world she was willingly visited by the gay the good and the great amongst her round of acquaintance was the brave the present Lord Cornwallis He soon felt an impression not to be effaced by the frequent conversations he had the happiness to enjoy with the lovely Miss Jones nor was the young Lady less pleased with the great attention his Lordship honoured her with His Lordship made proposals which the mother's good sense approved and her daughter's inclination and duty obeyed Their souls were congenial  And to his valour and his valiant parts  Did she her soul and body consecrate  The match soon took place to the joy and credit of all parties Never did wedded felicity promise more lasting happiness  One day past by and nothing saw but love  Another came and still 'twas only love  The suns were wearied out with looking on▪  And he untired with loving  He saw her ev'ry day and all the day  And ev'ry day was still but as the first  So eager was he still to see her more  When lo the dreadful the unfortunate war with America appeared and to her Ladyship indeed a view of horror His Lordship though all the lover and affectionate husband would not suffer his honour to forget that he was a soldier and eager to hazard blood and life for his king and country he entreated not to be an idle spectator in the time of danger if his services could be rendered acceptable which was immediately granted and his Majesty conferred particular command and honors on his Lordshipwhose regiment was ordered into immediate service Lady Cornwallis struck deep with grief urged every plea that affection reason intreaty and endearment could suggest to win his Lordship from his purpose but there he proved inexorablehe was indeed a Hector but she could not sustain the difficult firmness of an Andromache She even ventured to try her influence over an high personage a near relation of his Lordship's  The Abp of Ctrby  who moved with her heartfelt affliction begged her to be comforted with every assurance to accomplish if practicable  Lord Cornwallis's continued residence in England This exalted person waited on the King and painted her Ladyship's agony in such terms that his Majesty could not refuse a request to such an incontestible proof of connubial love and relinquished his intentions of Lord Cornwallis's going to America Her Ladyship now felt secure of all her wishes but how vain how unsubstantial is human blissfor the instant he heard an item of what was done and the source from whence it sprung  e flew like lightning to the throne judged his honor duty was at stake and his fame would be for ever tarnished should he suffer such a weak womanish motive however affectionate to over balance superior duty His Majesty was convinced of the propriety and nobleness of his sentiments and therefore his command was continuedto America he wentAs to the hour of seperation turn your light inwardeye behold and picturehe relied on her Ladyship's strength of mind and pride for his honour to reconcile her poignancy of sorrow  But love almighty love reigned in her distracted bosomWith horror she sunk beneath the weight of griefher eager heart followed her other selfo'er leaped its boundsand beckoned by the attending spirit her soul departed to the angels sure and left her precious image deeply engraven in his Lordship's heart  Here let me pause and with truth declare I could not relate this tragical event of the lady by me so well remembered without paying the tribute of a tear to her lovely and virtuous memory Here arises an awful and an useful lesson for reflection as it evinces that no rank whatever is exempt from misfortunesThe gilded carriage too often carries a heavy mind withinWhere we have feared death we have borne life away and where we would be safe  we perish  Since I wrote the foregoing history I have been honoured with a letter from James Jones Skelton  Esq  of Pap Castle near Cockermouth in Cumberland son to the Capt Jones before mentionedI conjecture Pap Castle to have been the  eat of good old General Skelton  The season at CoventGarden in closed on Saturday May the th with Romeo and Juliet the last time Mrs Cibber ever performed with her first Romeo Mr Barry as she engaged at Drury Lane the season following When Mr Barry tutored and introduced Miss Nossiter Wednesday Oct th as before mentioned in the character of Juliet to the public she was most favourably received His occasional prologue that night con  ained the following compliment to

Sheridan resumed his throne after an abdication of two years and continued till the end of the season June  These little anecdotes of the theatres I have merely given a place to fill up the chasm of my life from Christmas nor would I have offered these notes here as I intend a regular account of the success of every performer their seasons c in a publication that will not only contain much information but be of real service to every young candidate for the sock or buskin whether lady or gentleman with the terms advantages and disadvantages of all the principal playhouses and circuits in the three kingdoms and the particulars of my own theatres from my commencing manager to the present date but without any idea of another subscription therefore this little sketch is only done by way of supply for my sameness of life till November being entirely at home  In my father began the dreadful experiment of exerting his supposed rights as minister o  the Savoy and my constant attendance at th  theatres was aided by a pocket full of money▪ for soon after the  fatal  Marriage Act as I ma  truly  term it took place my father judged h  had a right to grant licences as usual and that i was a privilege annexed to the Savoy as bein extraparochial Those marriages brought in  profusion of cashand instead of thinking of a rainy day all was  rat tat tat  at the streetdoor and a variety of companyMr Fox's popularity was then arrived at such an height from the opposition he made to the Marriage Act that his chariot was dragged along the streets by the populace for several days togetherI have known as much crowding to hear my father preach a condemned sermon as to get admittance on a fashionable night into a theatre  The famous Doctor Killigrew who had been many years minister of the Savoy and all my father's predecessors had ever retained the power and right of granting licences for marrying from their own authority and being extraparochial my father judged himself secure and not within the reach of that severe act The temple of Hymen being so seasonably opened for the relief of distressed lovers marriage begot marriageEaster Day was crowded from eight till twelveSo many pairs were for the indissoluble knot being tied that he might have made a fortune had he been blessed with patience and prudence and been contented with publishing the bans of marriage only Many persons came on a Sunday out of curiosity to hear such a long list of spinsters announced all females of spirit engaging for the public good The Parisian dames were not less  fearless on their late march to Versailles Had he stuck to the bans only he had puzzled the minister who framed the act  And  "Wisely and slow they stumble that run fast"  might have been my father's motto Debts that had been the plague of our house were now almost unknown and I must say in justice to Government from my own knowledge he had hints of the terrible consequences that would certainly ensue and they wished him to drop a practice that must inevitably end in unavoidable ruin he supposed those hints proceeded from their fears of his undoubted right and that was the real cause of their lenity without keeping in mind that had it been so  "Might will overcome Right"  So it proved for the laws were put into immediate execution  There was then and I suppose there is still a regular walk over the leads at the Savoy through the kitchen of the prison to a private door into the chapel where the condemned deserters were taken to hear service the Sunday before they were to be shot and that road he took for the purpose of evading the King's messengers supposed to be at times on the watch One fatal Sunday morning a sudden alarm came that the officers were in the churchA general panic ensued in our little familyMy father sent word he was suddenly taken  illnay actually wanted me to read prayers in the clerk's desk and fearing that a forcible attack would be made on our territories from the the said gentlemen not meeting him in the church he went down the garden to a gate that op  ned on the banks of the Thames the tide happened to be lowhis person unluckily was weighty and he was aged about fiftyfourthe ste  s were oldhis foot slipped and he fell very  eavily against some logs of wood such as are frequently seen floating on that river He recovered himself and kept close to the shore which  as very muddy and not public till he got to Somersetstairs and there he immediately took a boat and by one manoeuvre or another got into Kent For had he been seized he must not only have suffered immediate confinement but our marriage temple would inevitably have been at an end therefore in Kent he engaged one Mr Grierson a clergyman to perform the marriages as his curate but the licences he granted himself thinking that Mr Grierson could not suffer for what he in his authority as minister of the Savoy was to be responsible for but he was again in error I must here take occasion to observe that those marriages were not privately conducted as through fear but quite the contrary for my father publickly advertised his authority for so doing  Mr Vernon of DruryLane Theatre was at that time married by Mr Grierson to Miss Poitier of the same stage and this circumstance has occasioned a thousand ill founded storiesWe all know stories beget stories but then we  make 'em  and  when made  we  tell 'em  Mr Vernon was banished the stage by the audience in London as an informer in September The fact was simply thisMr David Garrick ever loved to be meddling and though the Marriage Act concerned him not half so much aswhether the Emperor of Morocco's Sultana was the daughter of an Irish oyster woman or notyet still he would be busyMr George Garrick attorney at law his brother had wedded a daughter of Mr Carrington's the King's messenger and lived at Somerset House▪ on hearing of Mr Vernon's being married he Mr George Garrick judged it a glorious opportunity to prove his vigilance and Mr Carrington's diligence in the service of Government therefore they summoned Mr Vernon to appear and to give King David a satisfactory account of his marriage as to the where and the when For as to the tale of Vernon's being immediately after marriage tired of his Lady it is merely a fictitious story  Consent if mutual saves the lawyer's fee  Consent is law enough to set you free  Infidelity was so demonstrative on both sides that the archbishop's licence would have had very l  tle force in tying faster the marriage nooseThe lady liked a variety of husbands and the gentleman a plurality of wives They frequently changed their mates till at last in Dublin he became acquainted with Miss Macartney who was wellbred sensible and handsome She fixed the rambling rover and with that amiable woman he lived happily till death robbed the public of one at least of the most pleasing singers the stage or Vauxhall could ever boast ofHe had a great advantage added to his taste and expression as a singer as he possessed what seldom accompanies vocal performers strong abilities as an actor which aided by a pleasing person gave united force to his performances on every occasion Mr Vernon's assertion as to his being really married at the Savoy to Miss Poitier Mr David Garrick affected not to believe but asked who married themif it was Doctor Wilkinson Mr Vernon replied  "Nothe clergyman's name was Grierson"  Mr David Garrick still seemed not convinced but insisted on seeing the certificate which Mr Vernon immediately obtained from Mr Grierson and gave it to Mr David Garrick who delivered it to Mr Carrington and Mr Grierson was in consequence forced  out of his lodgings in open day and committed to Newgate tried and condemned to transportation for fourteen yearsMr Vernon was subpoened to the trial and was obliged to appear when called on Mr Grierson had a iarge family in great want of subsistencehad no living and nothing but the name of a poor clergyman for his support In circumstances so desperate he was glad to lay hold of any decent means for their support and if the worst came to the worst and the law should make a clergyman's joining people in wedlock a crime which for ages had been a ceremony held in the first estimation in the minds of men why he would reconcile himself to the consequence well knowing that whatever land he should be thrown upon it could not be worse than this After he was sentenced a subscription was raised but I have been informed he died on the voyagehis family were with him but my knowledge of him was so trifling never having seen him except in those few months that he was engaged as the marrying clergyman at the Savoy that it is not likely I should be fully acquainted with particulars relative to that unfortunate clergyman  My father in the intervening space supplied by Grierson had so arranged his matters as in his opinion would carry all before the wind it  was not four weeks before he returned home Mr Brooks was his attorney and the Reverend Mr Brooks brother to the attorney who lately died at Norwich was my father's curate for the public duties of the church He was husband to Mrs Brooks the authoress who favoured the world with  Rosina Marian  c A perpetual round of company went on but the family strongpurse was waining into a sudden decay with feasting the counsellors and lawyers who were to support his cause and one and all assured him over the flowing bowl that victory was certainbut the event of war no mortal knows Mr Brooks being my father's officiate an acquaintance with his family naturally occurred Mrs Brooks was his second wifeher mind was good but her person much the contraryshe then had a literary turn and her agreeable sensible remarks observations and instructions were given with affability and proved to me of great advantage  At her house I frequently met with Mr Quin who was using his interest with Mr Rich to produce Mrs Brooks's Tragedy of Virginia which was very properly rejected as it was not only a very poor play but one on the same subject by Crofts at DruryLane and another by Moncrief at CoventGarden had been performed in  and and neither of them attended with success but Crofts's was by much the best  Mrs Woffington and Mrs Elmy were also her visitors Mrs Elmy knowing my inclination for the stage corrected many of my faults her understanding was allowed by all to be very extensive She is still living and now must be greatly in the vale of years and I beg leave to assure her that wheresoever she dwells I have not forgot her lessons on pronunciation manners and characters Nor can her merit in Octavia Lady Grace or Mrs Marwood be ever erazed from my mind Mrs Cholmondley sister to Mrs Woffington was often there but hearing I had dared at that time to imitate Mrs Woffington Mrs Brooks never had influence to get me into any degree of favour with either of those ladies I twice or thrice visited Mrs Woffington in Yorkbuildings with Dr and Mrs Brooks but it was a forced civility in compliance to them  Mrs Woffington had conceived a disgust not to be removed and it was rooted even to hatred as will hereafter appear It must be observed that thirty years ago mimicking of the performers had not been attempted at the theatres except by Mr Garrick and that when he was at Goodman's Fields and by Mr Foote at the HayMarket For  when Mr Foote acted at CoventGarden he left out that part of his performance and the HayMarket was the spot for him to be the hero of each tale and where he shone in a conspicuous light to every advantage His mimickry at CoventGarden consisted of a whimsical teaching of stage pupils the Puppetsthe Chevalier Taylor and a Doctor Heberden two very public characters and well known by every body  I was the first that ever gave an entertainment of that kind at DruryLane or CoventGarden Theatres since which it has been so often well and ill attempted that though the actors and actresses naturally do not approve of the practice nor admire the talents of such an exhibitor yet it does not by any means create the spleen and unhappiness it did formerly for the frequent exertion of such comic powers certainly have taken off that edge which thirty years ago was judged most cutting and not to be endured The peculiarities of Mr Delane an actor of the first rank were so severely pointed out by Mr Garrick in the character of Bayes that it is said to have actually occasioned Mr Delane's flying to the bottle for relief to his hurt mind he continued to use it with such excess that he never was himself again  In other men we faults can spy  And blame the mote that dims their eye  Each little speck and blemish find  To our own stronger errors blind"  Mr Delane is mentioned as a gentleman of family in Ireland of liberal education and great qualifications for the stage  Mr Garrick at the sollicitation of his friendsremonstrances of the actors without whose assistance he could not live for what avails a general without an army and from full conviction his own merit required not such aid as mimickry as it was merely a trifling feather in his cap of fame he for once in his life did a generous action and gave up what he no longer wanted  But to return again to my father who was at home fairing most sumptuously every day on the gleanings of the marriage harvest but with very little attention or anxiety paid to the evil hour and I was in my glory full of feasting company personating a hero at night in my own playhouse or visiting one of the theatres and sometimes both If I did reflect it was very brieflyI argued thus that if the worst should happen I could be a great a  or in time and did not doubt but that I should be a manager in reality  O glorious thought I did enjoy it  Tho' but in fancy  But after sunshine comes a storm  My father having persisted in the pursuit of his  golden vision and being of an intrepid spirit and as he thought secure of victory on the day of trial The week previous to it in July he visited several of his friends and on the Sunday evening attended by two or three of his intimates took an affectionate leave of my mother and myself and delivered himself up at Newgate as he had given notice that he was ready to abide trial the next sessions which was to begin on the Monday following and on the Friday in the same week came on his dreadful daya dreadful day indeed was it to my disconsolate mother whose features indicated a mind replete with woe The trial of my father was not a scene for me to be present at but I remember to have heard he urged in his defence that he  "had been pursued with unrelenting vengeance"  As he was chaplain to his Majesty had they been determined on no other act of severity they certainly for his hostile demeanor in defiance of Government would have taken his place of chaplain from him However it is too well known whatever he might think as to his rights and privileges that the court found him guilty of the offence and it is as well known that though the public at large wished him well and detested the act in force yet most of his reasonable friends thought he would at last suffer the consequences announced  by law by which he was sentenced to fourteen years transportation  This was a stroke he most severely felt for it struck at his affections his pride and his false dependence which was the most mortifying of all for the condolence of what we suffer from consequent effects and causes clears in some degree the rugged paths of Misfortune but what our own wisdom fails in when in opposition to the opinion of wiser heads makes the disappointment terribly mortifyingand distressing indeedThe general or admiral who on a great undertaking does not prove victor however able in judgment and valour seldom or ever escapes censure My father therefore fell an unfortunate victim to the memorable Marriage Act His purse was drained to the last for the purchase of being promisecrammed by the alluring and flattering hopes given him by the gentlemen of the law  It now became an act of necessity for the public and his friends to be stretched to the extent of their humanity to equip and support him as a gentleman for his voyage to America His connections were considerable consequently his recommendations were such as would doubtless have placed him in a light of admiration as a man of the gospel had he arrived and lived in that country His qualifications as a scholar and as  an orator with the extraordinary law that had occasioned his removal there must in all probability have made amends for his sufferings and  ave raised him to the highest estimation It was after some consultation determined as soon as he was well and happily situated in America that my mother and myself should go after him  The following petition which I now present to the reader from his own hand writing was delivered by my mother herself to his Majesty King George the Second but without effect or notice The Secretary of State would not assistPetitions were hackneyed then as now and deemed troublesome intrusions on the time of a politician  It is seldom the  fortified breastwork  of the Minister is the friend of Affliction and where pale Poverty is the supplicant I fear too often his  heart  is callous and proof against every attack that may  e attempted by the feeble efforts of Mercy or Charity therefore to trace entrance there for a needle's point to pierce its feelings is barely possible  TO THE King's most Excellent Majesty THE HUMBLE PETITION OF JOHN WILKINSON MOST HUMBLY SHEWETH  THAT so long since as the year your petitioner hath been minister of your Majesty's royal precinct of the Savoy  That your petitioner always apprehending and believing the Savoy to be a Royal Exempt and as such not subject to the ordinary of the diocese so he hath occasionally during the time of his being minister of the Savoy solemnized marriages in the chapel there by virtue of his own licences  That in the th year of your Majesty's reign an act was passed to prevent clandestine marriages it enacts  "  That if any person shall solemnize marriages without publication of bans unless licence of marriage be first had and obtained from some person or persons having authority to grant the same every person knowingly and wilfully so offending shall be deemed and adjudged to be gui  ty of felony and be subject to be transported for fourteen years  "  That your Majesty's petitioner from the hopes that his mistake was not criminal voluntarily surrendered himself to take his trial upon a charge of having acted against that statute but having been convicted at the last Sessions is liable to be transported for the term of fourteen years and by this conviction has been deprived of that office in the Savoy and his wife and family thereby now in the utmost distress  That your Majesty's petitioner as he innocently pursued the example of his predecessors so from your Majesty's paternal goodness he humbly supplicates your Majesty's pardon to prevent a clergyman of the church of England who for more than thirty years has enjoyed other preferments in the church from being banished his native country and who has been universally confessed to be a faithful loyal and useful subject  And your Majesty's petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray JOHN WILKINSON  The time for his departure was early in March and the last meeting between father mother and son was in that most dreadful of all places Newgate We who had for so many years moved in a different sphere and who were more than commonly uniteda description of it  must here be omitted but if the sensible feeling mind will take a short pause and honour the ashes of the dead with a moment's reflection and a tear of pity it will be only paying a tribute due to humanity and mercy and from whence ideas will flow in painting the result of such a tragical affecting scene as imagination will easily describe much stronger than any words can possibly express For Apelles when he placed his hero in an agony of grief cast a mantle over his face thereby indicating that strong passions were more naturally supplied from the glow of ideas than from the pencil of the artist however fine or excellent  My dear benevolent indulgent gracious and loving parent farewell May your last blessing procure me at least a small portion of your wishes for my short remains of life  My father with every comfortable necessary as a gentlemanall his valuables clothes his writings his bureau cash with recommendatory letters c set sail for America but was previously obliged to pay thirty pounds as a perquisite for freedoma tax on misfortuneas a tribute to the hungry commanders of such vessels But it seemed as if the Almighty arm had purposely interfered to prevent the disgrace of any one of his Holy Servants here on earth landing as a banished  criminal in a foreign clime for only performing that ceremony instituted in his Holy Writ as a sacred band of unity between those whom inclination had led to his sacred altar therein obeying the impulse of nature ordained and sanct  ed by GOD himself  When they reached the Downs they could not proceed the winds would not permit them from thence we received a letter containing an account of my father being but very indifferent as the gout had made a severe attack in his stomach a complaint with which he was every year more or less afflicted in that dangerous seat of its residence They were driven by stress of weather into Plymouth where his enemy  the gout  assisted by the severity of the elements seized this dreadful opportunity to league with Death and v  olently assaulted a mind and body already l  ded with anguish affection and affliction and by finding himself bereft of that assistance and tenderness from those he sighed for but sighed in  in  the merciless invaders proved too mighty for his fortitudethe noble cordage cracked and broke Grim Death sat triumphant over his conquered manes  Then my father's soul might smilingly exult after all his sufferings here on earth and as  to his God rejoicingly cry out  "O Death  where is thy stingO Grave where is thy victory  Before the end of this tragical story I must relate that the Captain of the vessel had my father privately interred at Plymouth from whence as fatality seemed to pervade the whole mysterious event on the Captain's returning to his ship his boat was overset by a rough sea the crew were saved but the Captain perished  With one Winter's brush  Thus was I left open bare  For every storm that blow'd  Me to bear that  Who never knew but betterwas some burthen  When the Marriage Act took place in the Duchy of the Savoy certainly was in a lawless state as acts of parliament have passed within these fifteen years to put it under the power of Government I recollect several instancestwo will explain as well as five hundred From the Savoysteps in the Strand on to DuchyLane which is the  last  turning before you come to SomersetHouse down to the waterside and next the water on to Somersetstairs that used to be for watermen is all the Savoy precincts I remember that a Mr Wood a timbermerchant purchased the house next door to ours near the Savoy watergate and placed in it one Pugh who belonged to  CoventGarden Theatre to take care of it but Wood neglecting at the time to put furniture into the premises when he Wood wanted his house Pugh not only refused but kept possession of it for himself and Wood could not get any remedy at law The reason I do suppose was that no original right could be proved by him Pugh after living in this house for some years sold it to one Meredith a Welchman and Taffy well knowing how to turn the penny even stripped the lead off the roof of the house which he afterwards covered with boards and  arred them over The lead I believe was the property of Government for it reached over that a part of my father's house and some of the Savoy prison  A man whose name was Waller kept a public house near the Savoysquare he heard of a house being empty next the Savoy watergate where Mrs Porter a celebrated actress in Cibber's time had lived The house had been left and stripped of all the furnitureBreaking a lock was a service of danger therefore this Waller who kept the suttlinghouse near the barracks with a ladder fixed against it from a lighter mounted and got in with ease at the old balcony and by the same means in the might conveyed chairs c into the house took off the lock on the inside and became so dexterous thereby as to be firm  y established in  the possession of itFor while furniture was in the house and that furniture  his  the house was also his property as long as he dwelt in it or had his goods thereSuch was the unruly state of the Savoy  Waller was still more luckyfor one Burdet a very rich old German I dare say near eighty years of age who walked the streets in rags and was a picture of misery equal to Otway's Witch for  "his eyes with burning rheum were scald and red and went about picking up dry sticks and mumbling"  would not allow himself the necessaries of lifewas filthy in every sense of the word This man purchased for a very trifling sum of money this same house of Waller and which the old man expected to sell for a good round sum in comparison to what he had given but first he had placed in it a broken bedstead  chair c More luxuries he needed not as th  cold earth was often his bed and water his draugh  of refreshment  He had been missing for several days at la  Waller was the lucky man to obtain the hous  once more for after repeated rappings at the door he burst it open and found this old unaccountabl  character this poor  good  miserable extraordinar  being for tho' he grudged himself food and ra  ment yet he  ad a heart open to another's misery I have known him do great acts of kindness for m  father laying dead and by appearance had been so for some days and in all probability for want of common cheer and a little assistance Now Waller was so lucky by this accident as again to become the possessor and the house since that time about went gradually down from tenant to tenant according to the Savoy law and was burnt to the ground the very week before I went to London in the summer The house above it which I mentioned before as having fallen into the hands of one Meredith suffered by the conflagration All the large shops in the Strand from the Surry steps to Somersetgate were all sold or taken by surprize time out of mind Any old person in that district will confirm what I relate as the words of truth though they may seem bordering on the marvellous  The melancholy account of my father's death was soon conveyed to us and was submitted to with resignation then to think of means for subsistence for my afflicted mother and myself No restoration of the effects which my father died possessed off could ever be had As the following lines in a letter some time after from my mother so long as January will elucidate  "Hearing the vessel was returned from AmericaI sent Mr Philips a clerk of your father's to the Captain of the ship who was  astonished at the demand upon him for effects which he plainly demonstrated to be left in MarylandThis enquiry cost me ten shillings and sixpenceAll I can now do is to get a letter conveyed to the merchants abroad to undertake a restitution"  Which application ended in fruitless and additional expence  Yet in this destitute forlorn and miserable state was she left to support and maintain not only herself but me It was in the time of the war with FranceCaptain Jones immediately offered to procure me a commission in the armyLord Forbes the same but my own wise head led to higher viewsno less than Monarchy itself In short the stage was my throne of adulation I therefore rejected their offers which to my mother gave a heart felt pang as we were really reduced to live by the sale of such articles of remaining luxury as could produce subsistence and which enabled us to continue an appearance fit to be received at those tables we were invited to and here let me remark that a Lord may dine in a dingy dress and it is genteel fashionable and elegant but let the needy man set down to table and a Lord by chance should come into the room the master and mistress of the ceremony do not know how to help or look at the poor guest for  fear of disgracing themselves yet at the same time wish to convey an idea to every one present that they are amiable and beneficent and that really they have put themselves out of their way in order to support the pauper by giving him a meal  My mother's friends were capable and willing to afford every support to enable her to keep up a decent appearance both at home and abroad by a respectable assistance which when so bestowed will ever gladden the oppressed mind but not when offered as a supercilious giftas who should say  "I am Sir Oracle""How good I am"  Lear  " Take physick Pomp  " Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel  " That thou may'st cast the superflux to them  " And shew the heav'ns more just"  These kindnesses assisted by our false crippled friend  Hope  who leads astray the old the young▪ the gay the lively the rich and the poor with her delusions lulled us for a while into a stupid lethargy At length we were suddenly aroused by its being seriously pointed out by Mr Jonas Hanway and others that they could not help being angry that a lad between seventeen and eighteen not bred to any business and whose education had been shamefully neglected should by his having been accustomed to indulge his own selfwill and pleasure refuse to receive a commission especially  as I ought to have rejoiced and have been ready to have accepted of a genteel competency instead of idly preferring hanging on a mother for subsistence who was herself dependent on others for her support These hints to a young selfconceited mind are always received by such unfortunate pets as the effects of insolent authority and impertinence  As I had not then actually experienced the rod of affliction or necessity I did not or would not perceive the rapid strides I was taking for my destruction There are many situations such as Conway Sands Lincoln Marsh c where on a summer's eve it may be pleasant to walk and view the prospects round but if thoughtlessly the proper time for returning is neglectedwhat had the minute before appeared pleasing and delightful is surrounded with wateringulfed and swallowed up reflection then comes too lateThis is exemplified by a passage in King John  " For in a night the best part of my power  " As I upon advantage did remove  " Were in the washes all unwarily  " Devoured by the unexpected flood"  From my then situation may youths take a lesson and  " Learn to be wise from other's harm  " And they will do full well"  Though I had not seemingly attended to Mr  Jonas Hanway's authoritative lecture and remonstrance yet conviction inwardly and sullenly told me that something must be done The stage my thoughts had not forgot though I dared not avow my inclination for it fearing my patrons and mother would not prefer my being a player to that of an officer and what I dreaded still more was my hearing a mean opinion delivered of my education and want of capability as a servant of the muses However unknown to them I plucked up courage and waited on Mr Rich and after rehearsing several speeches from Richard III he behaved very familiarly and desired me to hear HIM  act Richard III  and his acting over I was without loss of time enrolled on the list of his pupils After some time he taught me a trumpery speech for to make my appearance as one of the three Ambassadors in the Humourous Lieutenant but after the honour of attending his levees having free admission behind the scenes and receiving a few lessons from him he  my astonishment declared I was incapable of becoming an actor But whether the fault lay in the preceptor or in the stupidity of the pupil is difficult to determine but so it wasand my only consolation was constantly attending behind the scenes where I by mere accident grew familiarly  acquainted with Mr Shuter the only one who took the least notice of me  I lived on hopes however that Mr Rich would ere long perceive my genius which I assured myself was beyond compare and soon after on my repeating the first speech of Richard III one morning in the exact tone and manner of old Rich he seemed delighted and I judged all would soon terminate in the accomplishment of my wishes but the following odd accident frustrated all my hopes and I innocently incurred the fixed displeasure of Mr RichMy ideal opinion of greatness ouzed away and what sense I had formerly possessed was now returning with a melancholy prospect before meeven that of existence stared at me with an aspect that struck with every mortifying and humiliating sensation This total overthrow to all my expectations was occasioned by Mrs  offington The cause was as followsOne day my old friend Captain Forbes had invited me to dine with him at the Bedford Arms and after a choice dinner with plenty of good wine c the Captain said  "Tate we will go to the play and added that he wished to go behind the scenes"  But as I went there only on sufferance I told him it was not in my power to oblige him  "If so" said my friend George we will not separate for I will treat you to the boxes"  Being jolly with the bottle I assented and when arrived at the theatre I could not prevail on him to sit any where but in the stagebox He was in full guard regimentalsmyself by no means dressed fit to appear as his companion but as he persisted and led the wayI followed and in the front of his Majesty's stagebox we were seated and no more strange than true the lower sides exhibited a beggarly account of empty boxes and only a few persons were scattered in the front ones not an extraordinary circumstance to relate then of an unfashionable night at CoventGarden Theatre The play was The Con  ederacy  Being in such a conspicuous situation the eyes of the performers from behind the scenes were instantaneously attracted on beholding a poor young lada mere dependentskulking nightly behind the curtain placed in a stage boxthey were therefore astonished at my audacity in usurping and possessing such a particular seat of distinctionand a creature too that was destitute and soliciting for bread they naturally concluded I had gained admittance by an order and taken such a place by way of ignorant and impudent bravado the which deserved chastisementthey sent and spoke to Mr Rich and it was agreed that Wilkinson should be instantly ordered from  his improper situation A messenger was sent to put this mandate from Mr Rich in full forcethe boxkeeper came to me and Captain Forbes warm with his wine and the insult offered to his friend soon convinced the official messenger of his mistake and the boxkeeper was sent back to assure Mr Rich that Mr Wilkinson was seated there by proper authority as Captain Forbes who was well known by being a constant box attendant at their theatre had paid ten shillings for admittance This I was well informed caused a general greenroom laugh of contempt at the expence of the poor povertystruck gentleman in the stage box But unfortunately Mrs Woffington who acted Clarissa having been frequently told that I was remarkable for  taking her off  as the phrase was and is came close to the stagebox finishing her speech with such a sarcastic sneer at me as actually made me draw backMy unfortunate star sure was then predominant for at that moment a woman of the town in the balcony above where I was seated repeated some words in a remarkable shrill tone which occasioned a general laugh like electricity it caught Mrs Woffington's ear whose voice was far from being enchanting on perceiving the pipe squeek on her right hand and being conscious of the insult she had then given apparently to me it struck her comprehension  so forcibly that she immediately concluded I had given the retort upon her in that open and audacious manner to render her acting and tone ridiculous to the audience as returning contempt for her devilish sneer She again turned and darted her lovely eyes tho' assisted by the furies which made me look confounded and sheepish all which only served to confirm my condemnation When the scene was finished and she had reached the greenroomshe related my insolence in such terms as rendered me a subject of abuse contempt and hatred with all the company but of that circumstance I was quite ignorantat the instant I had it is true observed to my mortification Mrs Woffington looked angry but could not divine the real cause  The noon following when I attended Mr Rich's levee I was kept in waiting a considerable time but as that was and is the too common fate of distressed dependencePatience was my friend and companionat last Mrs Woffington passed through the room where I was thus humiliated and without a word curtsey or bow of her head proceeded on to her sedan from which she as haughtily returned and advancing towards me with queenlike steps and viewing me most contem  uously said  "Mr Wilkinson I have made a visit this morning to Mr Rich to command  and to insist on his not giving you any engagement whateverno not of the most menial kind in the theatreMerit you have nonecharity you deserve notfor if you did my purse should give you a dinneryour impudence to me last night where you had with such assurance placed yourself is one proof of your ignorance added to that I heard you echo my voice when I was acting and I sincerely hope in whatever bam you are suffered as an unworthy stroller that you will fully experience the same contempt you dared last night to offer me"  With a flounce and enraged features without waiting or permitting me to reply she darted once more into her chair I really was so astonished frightened and bewildered that I knew not how to act or think but was relieved from longer suspense and tedious waiting by a message from Rich intimating that he could not see me at his levee either that day or in future or listen to any engagement whatever for my behaviour was too gross and rude to be justified and I must immediately depart but the person added I might continue the liberty of the scenes during the season with this proviso that I should not on any account take the freedom to speak to Mr RichI wished not nor had the power to make an answer  Provisions were short at homemy good mother's  poverty increasedOne good advantage this distress produced was that what I should have devoured  that  day with my noddle full of vanity was reserved for the  next  my stomach being quite satisfied with grief shame and vexation poverty pursuing my steps My mother of course execrated Rich and Woffingtonwept over her darling boy and flew to that Refuge which she often declared always afforded her support and had never forsaken her even when sinking under the greatest affliction and that Refuge was a constant address to the Deity and a trust in his Divine mercy However I would not give up the play that night nor in a pet resign my permission of being behind the scenes but the theatre was no longer that earthly paradise I had formed for the mist was removed and I saw actors actresses and myself in a different mirror which convinced me what we all really were  When I went into the greenroom an universal laugh of contempt ensu  dWoffington the queen bee of the hive was thereI had disturbed and offended her Majesty and therefore all her faithful servants beelike joined to sting me except Mr Shuter who saw my distress and good naturedly took me by the handled me to his dressingroom and desired me not to be cast down but observed I must not enter the greenroom  again as they were one and all determined on my banishment In such a situation it will naturally be conceived I had a claim to pity and some little protection and that players must of course be the most cruel of all people  But I must in justice clear them from that imputation as they are in general benevolent and always ready to relieve the unfortunate but I had in their opinion then forfeited all title to commiseration and assistance as they felt themselves much hurt with the constant accounts they heard of my rendering most of the leaders in their profession ridiculous by my freedom of mimicry and the open and audacious affront which they believed and assured themselves I had given to Mrs Woffington which could not be removed or palliated Mrs Woffington being generous familiar and friendly to the comedians it was not surprising that they should obey her mandate which added to their own supposed wrongs agreed with their inclinations therefore as a common cause they all concluded such treatment to me was only inflicting strict justice on an ignorant pretending upstart  I own I often at that time practised this said talent and had frequently set the table in a roar but that without any design or intention of injury to any one The fact lies plainly herewe can all laugh  at each other's foibles and peculiarities but think our own are not perceived or if perceived should be overlookedIf to do were as easy as to say what ought to be done and such a mode was adopted adieu all murdering of reputations and private peace that gorgeous meal for Malignity I confess as a joker to have been free but never stabbed in the dark and I do also profess I kindly set down my own satire as harmless and  rom my heart most nobly and truly have forgiven injuries but  fear  I shall never bring myself to esteem those who ignorantly and wickedly have presented me in colours most disgustful and that in a point wherein they were so bewildered and  egregiously  mistaken that the true foundation of the story so far from shame or disgrace had  honour  and real humanity for its supporters At my last moments if able to articulate I shall not even in the agony of death deviate from this solemn oath and awful asseveration I have not inserted this on  my own account  but as incumbent on myself to c  ear the aspersed the unfortunate and miserable and I could wish my avowal recorded in the golden letters of truth over my grave  Where nothingno nothing can touch me further  It is too often demonstrative and much to be lamented that persons of distinguished rank and pride can forget their true dignity and instigated  by the appetite for scandal yield and mingle with the vulgar herd and on a bare supposition meanly stoop to throw poisoned arrows on the defenceless who if they themselves at that moment were reminded of the crimes and misdemeanors of their own families would shudder and shrink appalledGo bid them laugh at that  Verily we all can ken many of such description but as they are numerous there is not any occasion for any one to put on the cap  unless it fits  He who cannot rise superior to calumny may be a good man but never a contented one I will quit this intrusive matter and calmly observe to anonymous vipers  "Malice scorned puts out itselfbut argued gives a kind of credit to a false accusation"  But I must return to Mrs Woffington and be her theatrical herald and faithful chronologer She ever had a train of admirers she possessed wit vivacity c but never permitted her love of pleasure and conviviality to occasion the least defect in her duty to the public as a performer Six nights in the week has been often her appointed lot for playing without murmuring she was ever ready at the call of the audience and though in the possession of all the first line of characters yet she never thought it improper or a degradation of her  consequence to constantly play the Queen in Hamlet Lady Ann in Richard III and Lady Percy in Henry IV Parts which are mentioned as insults in the country if offered to a lady of consequence  Read this ye heroes and heroinesShe also cheerfully acted Hermione or Andromache Lady Pliant or Lady Touchwood Lady Sadlife or Lady Dainty Angelica or Mrs Frail and several others alternately as best suited the interest of her manager  At nine years old I became acquainted with Mrs Barrington of CoventGarden Theatre by being at the same school at Wandsworth with Mr T Hale her son by her first husband Mr Hale the actor I had for some years been kindly received by her and annually at the time of her benefit traversed from St Paul's to Westminster to dispose of tickets which canvass generally proved productive but now the child of sorrow and having incurred the hatred of Mrs Woffington to whom Mrs Barrington was a close intimate even to adulation she withdrew her courtly smile glance or nod from poor Tate who she was once proud of acknowledging  One evening some few weeks after my late mentioned disgrace Mrs Woffington was acting Lady Dainty in the Double GallantMrs Barrington  Sylvia Mrs Vincent Clarinda I ventured after much hesitation to say to Mrs Barrington I thought Mrs Woffington looked beautifulMrs Barrington tossed up her head and said That was no news as she looked so every night at which she and Mrs Vincent laughedthis occasioned Mrs Woffington to turn her head and condescendingly ask What they were smiling at Mrs Barrington replied that the young man was saying that Lady Dainty looked beautiful that night and added she had told him there needed not that information as she always looked soMrs Woffington viewing me disdainfully cried Poor CreatureO God says I what shall I do for breadI had better exhibit in a barn but am not sure if I can even get that situationMy only comfort was my acquaintance with the facetious Ned Shuter it grew soon to a strong friendship for he took me to all his parties and that made my time glide more pleasantly I mentioned his kindness to my confidant Captain Forbes and also informed him what excellent company Shuter wasHe said he looked upon his civility shewn to me as an obligation to himself He was then appointed on the command of the Savoy Guard and he desired▪ I would constantly be with him and present a general invitation to Mr Shuter the compliment Shuter seemed highly pleased with accepted  of the favour offered him and went with me there very often  We had many pleasant parties Captain Forbes and Shuter grew very intimate Shuter's talents were wonderfully shrewd quick sensible and to a degree highly entertainingHe was no man's enemy but his own One evening over our bottle Shuter told me that his benefit was to be on the th of March and he would  get up  never performed at CoventGarden the farce of Lethe and would play Mr Garrick's character of Lord Chalkstone and I should represent the Fine Gentleman a difficult part for any actor and at that time playing by Woodward at DruryLane who was in his zenith and was certainly the most improper character for  me  of any in the whole round of the drama But most young actors think if it be a principal one the business is done for it is a rule fixed in the theatrical corps that parts make the actornot the actor the parts They will also urge that managers can always by such partial means and subterfuge create as many great performers as they please but a very little reflection would evidently contradict it to the mortification of most of them because at that rate the loss of a grand actor or actress could always be supplied by the managers so if their doctrine be true the favourites of the public should not at any place  trifle with the manager as according to that supposition the performer may foolishly and wantonly quit a good situation and the manager from his own creative quality as the carpenter of genius could mould and chisel any block to supply such a loss but true genius will shew itself in the flightest character Nor did Shakespear ever write a Westmoreland or Northumberland without strict attention to their true quality Now and then actors nay even the ladies mistake their tatalents nor was Mr Garrick exempt who acted Lord Townly and Sir Harry Wildair Othello Lord Foppington Pierre c all unfit for him and they were judged so by the TownMr Mossop the West Indian Mr Ryan Varanes Mrs Cibber Lady Townly and Lady Brute Mr Barry Richard Mrs Clive Zara Quin Chamont and Young Bevil and all this by their own choice therefore if such persons of judgment and experience were led away by their performing characters unfit for them it is not to be wondered at that I young and inexperienced should attempt the Fine Gentleman  However advertised for it I was and away went Shuter and myself to Monmouth Street where for two guineas I was equipped with the loan of a heavy rich glaring spangled embroidered velvet suit of clothes and in this full dress fit for the King  in Hamlet with my hair in papers did I advance with timid steps through crowds of people for Shuter's popularity had brought the whole London world A large amphitheatre was built on the stage numbers were lying on the ground and only one entrance on each side to get on the stage and that was with great difficulty obtained however at last I was produced on the centre of CoventGarden boards as a performerand O grief of griefs as a  Fine Gentleman  A great number of my late father's friends were assembled The prepossession in favour of his sufferingsthe public clamour and pity of the audience on my known destitute situation gained me such a reception as might have misled a wiser head than mine as audiences every where but at London in particular are ever considerate and encouraging to a young performer I do not mean to insinuate here that I possessed the Promethean heat but it gave me courage to proceed for it was a perpetual applause I endeavoured to copy Woodward but with aukwardness and having no knowledge of the stage c it certainly was a dreadful performance not but that some of my friends thought from the great approbation that was given and having no opinion of their own I had done wonders  I was so highly satisfied with myself that as soon  as the scene was over and not having patience to wait till I was summoned with the other characters by Mercury at the end of the farce I took a chair to Mrs Townsend's where my mother was sitting and entered amongst the astonished circle of old ladies assembled togetherall glittering with my fine dress and quite elevated with the applause and my own conceit myself being the harbinger of the joyful news The partial mother seeing her son so fine and fully persuaded he had acted well could not restrain the glistening tear no doubt prognosticating in her mind that she beheld in her offspring a second GarrickMy ignorance was so great that I had intended also to have obliged the town with the Frenchman in the same farce but was luckily persuaded from it for if that had really happened it must not only have deprived me of that happy night but have made it one of horror and irretrievable damnation  Friday April the th was fixed for the benefit of Mr Bencraft and Mr Costollo at CoventGarden the play was Alexander and the part of Alexander by Mr Barry they applied to me for to study Don Quixote in England and I readily agreed to it but thanks for once to my stupidity I was under the necessity of giving it up as I could not by any means drive the words into my  pate and if I had it must have proved an unfortunate attempt therefore that Quixote scheme being abandoned Lethe was again substituted and they requested of me to act the Fine Gentleman which I consented to not but that I inwardly thought  my  Alexander would have done as much for their interest as Mr Barry's However as that was not their opinion why hey for the river Styx once more and I surely that night needed a draught of Lethean waters to forget my cares  A dress was to seek for Bencraft and Costollo would not pay so extravagantly as Shuter had for the hire of the grand velvet suit therefore the wardrobe of the theatre was to furnish me but all the decent modern clothes were appropriated to the principal actors and on inspecting the grand repository Mr Whitfield the wardrobekeeper produced a very short old suit of clothes with a black velvet ground and broad gold flowers as dingy as the twenty four letters on a piece of gilded gingerbreadthis apparel had not been brought t  li  t since the first year Garrick played Lothario at that theatre in when Quin acted Horatio which was the last character that he performed in the last week of May as an engaged actor though he played twice after that his favourite character of Falstaff for his friend Ryan's benefits  and  The suit being Garrick's I with eagerness snatched at it Bedecked in that sable array for the modern Fine Gentleman and to make that appearance complete I added an old red surtout trimmed with a dirty white fur and a deep skinned cape of the same hue honoured by old Giffard I was informed at Lincoln's InnFields theatre to exhibit King Lear in This grand dress with an old stock muff used for the Gentleman Usher in the Rehearsal my hair in papers as on my first curious exhibition gave the  tout ensemble  to my all accomplished figure that when quite equipt had it not been for the whimsical contradiction of my large paper curls Lord Chalkstone's motley Nephew of delicate notions might have passed in a barn for a strolling Sciolto No sooner had I made my  entrée  than an involuntary fit of laughter seized the whole house from below to above and from above to below for such a contrast to the name or idea of a Fine Gentleman sure never was till then beheld the preposterous figure was heightened in absurdity by Woodward's appearing every week in that character with infinite credit His acting was assisted by every elegance that whim dress fancy judgment and fashion could bestow whilst poor Pilgarli  k chose to finish the curious appearance by quitting Woodward's manner entirely and spoke in my own voice  which is naturally deep so that my tones were drowned with the excessive laughter and when I made my exit as the Fine Gentleman whether the peals of mirth or the universal hisses were the strongest seemed difficult to distinguish I would not appear again at the conclusion of the piece but flew to Shuter's dressingroom to tear of my pomp and know myself but wanted not a sedan to convey me as before to Mrs Townsend's The next day's reflection presented fresh difficulties and approaching ruin  Unfit for the stage what could I do My mother's existence was procured by the sale or pawning every trifle that could raise a few shillings and she trembling to view the darkened prospect when the last resources were expended compelled me to wait on Mr Rich once more and solicit him to retain me on any trifling salary for the ensuing year but I received a short and peremptory  "NO You are unfit for the stage Muster Whittington and I won't larn youyou may go Muster Whittington"  and he stroked his favourite cat  Summer did not promise me better than the winter had done for with my bad reception I could not get a recommendation or a probability of any engagement whatever even in the country Monday May As You Like It was acted at CoventGarden for the benefit of Mr  Anderson Mr Wignel and a Mad Gondou I was standing near the wing as Mrs Woffington in Rosalind and Mrs Vincent in Celia were going on the stage in the first act Mrs Woffington ironically said she was glad to have that opportunity of congratulating me on my stage success and did not doubt but such merit would insure me an engagement the following winter I bowed but made her no answerI knew her dislike to me and was humiliated sufficiently and needed not any slight to sink me lower For then and not till then adversity had taught me to know myself She went through Rosalind for four acts without my perceiving she was in the least disordered but in the fifth she complained of great indisposition I offered her my arm the which she graciously accepted I thought she looked softened in her behaviour and had less of the  hauteur  When she came off at the quick change of dress she again complained of being ill but got accoutred and returned to finish the part and pronounced in the epilogue speech  "If it be true that good wine needs no bushit is as true that a good play needs no epilogue" c c  But when arrived at  "If I were among you I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me"  her voice broke she faultered endeavoured to go on but could not proceedthen in a voice of  tremor screamed O God O God tottered to the stage door speechless where she was caught The audience of course applauded till she was  ut of sight and then sunk into awful looks of astonishment both young and old before and behind the curtain to see one of the most handsome women of the age a favourite principal actress and who had for several seasons given high entertainment struck so suddenly by the hand of death in such a situation of time and place and in her prime of life being then about fortyfour She was given over that night and for several days but so far recovered as to linger till near the year  but existed as a mere skeleton  sans  teeth  sans  eyes  sans  taste  sans  every thingVain is Beauty's gaud y flower  She died in rich circumstances Colonel Caesar of the guards was by agreement to have received all her possessions it having been settled between the Colonel and Mrs Woffington that which of the two was the survivor should inherit all that the other possessed and this was signed by a will by each party But the generous Colonel was deceived for she secretly made an after will while her Colonel was engaged out at a dinner and left every article whatever to her sister Mrs Cholmondeley I don't believe even the  shilling  was bequeathed him and her sister not chusing to omit or let any infringement prevent her from faithfully  executing the will of the dead demanded all Mrs Woffington's paraphernalia from Mrs Barrington with whom all her stage jewels were lef  in trust and from their long acquaintance she expected to enjoy them in their full lustre with  good legacy added to cheer her woe on the occasion but to her great surprise mortification and disappointment the whole even to the minutest article was demanded and Mrs Barrington was unwillingly compelled to resign her crown her coronet and all the marks of royal distinction belonging to the late Queen Margaret  This profusion of stage pomp and grandeur the most rich and elegant of the kind and all of them set in silver in the hands of an actress was a property of great consequence looked most splendid and would have descended from Queen to Queen from Phoedra to Cleopatra from Hermione to the Grecian Daughter in due tragical willprogression but in the hands of a lady of fashion only a few of them could with propriety be worn and as what profit could arise from the sale of them must be indeed contemptible I wonder she had not the pleasure of making a genteel gift to an old friend and acquaintance of her sister's particularly as Mrs Cholmondeley was secure of all the real jewels c  Having so often mentioned Mrs Woffington I  naturally apprehend many persons who have not had the pleasure of seeing her would like a short description of that celebrated actress and having related so many particulars concerning that lady and pronounced authoritatively how much I was thought a strong caricature of her stage manner it might be judged that I could give some ideas as to a similitude which indeed I can with the strongest traits and at the same time compliment the present age on their possessing an actress in a first polished character in the arch and attractive  Miss Farren  Such parts as Lady Townly Maria Millamant c now represented by her were formerly thought Mrs Woffington's best line of acting Miss Farren is to a certainty very like Mrs Woffington in some points and enchantingly superior in others Miss Farren as to every intrinsic quality may bid the world look on scrutinize and envy while on the opposite side we are compelled to place comparatively Mrs Woffington who also had her share of praiseworthy qualities yet a veil will be sometimes necessary to shade the frailties too often prevalent over the human disposition  SCALE OF MERIT  Their complexions and features much alikeMiss Farren will be more like ten years hence before which time I hope she will be distinguished by some other appellation  MRS WOFFINGTON  MISS FARREN  Mrs Woffington was tall  So is Miss Farren  Mrs Woffington was beautiful  So is Miss Farren  Mrs Woffington was elegant  So is Miss Farren  Mrs Woffington was well bred  So is Miss Farren  Mrs Woffington had wit  So has Miss Farren  Mrs Woffington had a harsh broken and discordant voice  Miss Farren's musical and bewitching  Mrs Woffington  could be  rude and vulgar  Miss Farren  never  So undoubtedly Miss Farren seizes the wreath of Fame with security as she adds to her perfections in the Scale of Merit virtue modesty reverence to a parent and every other endearing quality therefore with propriety and for the credit of the Drama let me hurl my cap and cry  Long live THE FARREN  So my dear agreeable Miss Farren for the present adieuand now let me inform the reader that on the night of Mrs Woffington's fatal illness Mr Wignell an under actor at CoventGarden was enlisting troops to form a party at Maidstone in Kent where it was said there had not been a company of comedians for some years and that one from London would of course do wonders I asked Mrs Barrington to intercede for me but she refused any interference I therefore waited on Mr Wignell who told me he was erecting a wooden booth at Maidstone and that Mr and Mrs Barrington who usually went to Bristol were disappointed that year on account of some dispute with the mayor and he should find in them his cousins a tower of strength  Mr Barrington was not a very good comedian but yet was in low Irishmen Mr Moody indeed excepted the best I ever sawsuch as the Teagues in the Committee Twin Rivals c but would have been a bad Major O'Flaharty as he was in  fact a very indifferent Sir Callaghan Miss Hallam was to be there niece to Mrs Barrington and had been bred under her with the utmost care and reared to be an accomplished actress as the reader will allow when I announce that Miss Hallam is the present Mrs Mattocks for whom I have and shall ever retain the highest regard and am indebted to both Mr and Mrs Mattocks for repeated acts of kindness and friendship  I was from the emergency of Mr Wignell's company not being filled to my delight accepted as a sharer and enrolled one of their commonwealth The performers collected for this Kentish expedition wereMr Wignell Mr Barrington Mr Morgan Mr Smith Mr Haughton Mr Clough Mr Jones Mr Wilkinson Mr Buck Mr CastleMrs Barrington Miss Morrison now Mrs Hull Miss Bradshaw Mrs Roberts Mrs Wignell Mrs Haughton and Miss Hallam  I got home and judged that I had for once done something like a transaction of business and also found I had the interest of a great friend of my mother's who I have the honour at this day to call a relation and to whom I am and have been greatly obligedthe Lady's name was Wardale she lived at Carlisle To those who  knew her I need not add praise those who did not may regret that they had not the pleasure of being acquainted with such an agreeable sensible well bred woman  This Mrs Wardale anxious for my situation and welfare had prevailed on the Honourable Miss Foley sister to Lord Foley to ask the favour of a letter of recommendation from her intimate friend Lord Mansfield to Mr Garrick which his Lordship immediately complied with so with those credentials I was to proceed on a visit the next day and which I assure the reader seemed to me to require more than common fortitude I marched up and down Southampton street three or four times before I dared rap at this great man's door as fearing instant dismission might follow or what appeared to me almost as dreadful if graciously admitted how I should be able to walk move or speak before him However the rap was at last given and the deed was done past all retreating  "Is Mr Garrick at home""Yes"  Then delivering the letter from Miss Foley with an enclosed one from Lord Mansfield and after waiting in a parlour for about ten minutes I was ordered to approach Mr Garrick glanced his scrutinizing eye first at me then at the letter and so alternately at last  "Well SirHeyWhat now you are a stage  candidate Well Sir let me have a taste of your quality"  I distilled almost to jelly with my fear attempted a speech from Richard and another from Essex which he encouraged by observing I was so much frightened that he could not form any judgment of my abilities but assured me it was not a bad omen as fear was by no means a sign of want of merit but often the contrary We then chatted for a few minutes and I felt myself more easy and requested leave to repeat a few speeches in imitation of the then principal stage representatives  "Naynow" says Garrick "Sir you must take care of this for I used to call myself the first at this business"  I luckily began with an imitation of Foote It is difficult here to determine whether Garrick hated or feared Foote the most sometimes one sometimes the other was predominant but from the attention of a few minutes his looks brightenedthe glow of his countenance transfused to mine and he eagerly desired a repetition of the same speech I was animatedforgot Garrick was present and spoke at perfect ease  "Hey now Nowwhatall"says Garrick "Howreally thisthisiswith his usual hesitation and repetition of wordsWhywellwellDo call on me again on Monday at eleven and you may depend upon every assistance in my power I will  see my brother manager Mr Lacey today and let you know the result  I now really thought Fortune had done with tormenting me Honoured not only with the approbation but friendship of that great man I was elated into a degree of rapture I had not experienced for a long time and in truth I fancied that should the infallible Pope Garrick quit the stage either by death choice or accident I should in a few seasons be able to supply the vacant chair So light is vanity I did not walk but flew to my lodgings where my poor anxious mother sat trembling for the eventthe noise I made in running up the stairs and my countenance on entering the room denoted in full evidence that she was to receive goodnot bad news On my relating to her Mr Garrick's kind behaviour and his assurance of serving me she concluded her son Tate's fortune was made She blessed Garrick she blessed me and we were both for that day perfectly happy Something may be said in savour of my belief at that time as I was unacquainted with managers actors theatres and the world Not that I mean to insinuate that every manager is a devilI know the contrary That managers are men and have their faults and sometimes act wrong is natural and a spice of the devil in the composition is absolutely necessary or  what would become of a manager at times when surrounded by agitated fiends  Mine and my mother's dinner that day the th of May was most luxuriant and I can affirm that neither his Majesty nor any of his subjects dined with better appetite or greater happinessnot even my old  friend  Mrs  Bellamy  See her Apology vol v page  who describes as she sat on the bottom step of Westminster Bridge where she remained for several minutes watching the gently swelling tide and blaming its tardy approach but thinking better of it she changed her cold situation and chose to return home where she found her maid to her great surprise had provided a good supper and declares that even in the most elevated situation she ever was in and when her table has been spread with dainties that she never made a more pleasing meal So  The King of France with twenty thousand men  March'd up the hill and then march'd down again  Shakspeare remarks  "If the man go to the water and drown himself it is will he nill he he goes mark you that but if the water come to him and drown him he drowns not himself"  On the Monday I negligently slid up Southamptonstreet not with the tottering attendant fear of the preceeding week I was spruced out  knocked at the door with a degree of assurance was instantly admitted and not only found Mr Garrick alone but as soon as he saw me he expressed a wish of impatience for my promised visit said he had heard a most favourable account of my mother of whom he had made an enquiry and  hould be glad for the sake of so deserving a woman to assist me to the utmost of his powerThis was a cordial to my heart and I believe it may be made a certain observation that whenever young or old wait on a superior as a dependent character he or she is anxiously tremulous until satisfied whether the grant can be obtained or not But now all appeared to me in a happy trainMr Garrick said  "Young Gentleman I have seen Mr Lacey and we have determined to put you on the books at thirty shillings per week the ensuing seasonI will think of some line of characters for you to perform on the stagemy time is short and not at my disposal this morning as I must be at▪ Hampton to dinner therefore as I am on the wing do oblige me with a repetition of what you recited last Saturday  I readily complied and executed it with spiritFrom the imitation of Foote I proceeded with great alacrity to several others and when I came to those of Mr Barry and Mrs Woffington as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth I was obliged to  stop he seemed so truly entertained I thought it very comical and that the joke might not be lost I laughed too but on the merriment ceasing I perceived a concealed third laugherthe Lady Teazle behind the screen which greatly puzzled me when on a sudden a green cloth double door flew open which I found led to a little breakfast parlour and discovered a most elegant ladyno less a personage than Mrs Garrick who had it seems been purposely posted there for her secret opinion of my imitations of Foote as Mr Garrrick always affected to pay great compliment to her judgment and opinion and I really believe not all acted complaisance but founded on real esteemBut like his brethren mortals had his frailties  Mrs Garrick apologized for her rudeness and intrusionconfessed she had taken possession of that snug spot unobserved at the desire of Mr Garrick as from his account of my imitations on the Saturday she expected to be much gratified but when she heard the tones of Mrs Woffington the ridicule was so strongly pointed that it was not in her power to restrain from laughter by the pleasure and great satisfaction she had received If it had happened otherwise Mrs Mouse would not have appeared but kept snug in her holePerhaps female prejudice here might operate  in my favour as Mr Garrick had previous to his marriage with Madam Violette paid his devoirs to Mrs Woffington  Before I took my leave I acquainted our Ro  cius with my intention relative to Maidstone which he approved and said practice would acquire me freedom and ease on the stageit was what he had done previous to his public appearance in London But the chief lesson he would give to a young man trying his fortune on the stage was  sobriety  and above allin a great character or in an inferior one however trifling it might be always to be perfect For that he observed was the groundwork for excellence in every walk of the drama and by attention to the author a novice would soon find from the feelings of his audience his natural bent as without being master of the words no actor could comprehend or execute the character or so far forget himself as to assume the being another person whether a king or a cobbler Actors he said often mistook their talents by following their inclinations in lieu of their real genius but if always perfect a lucky hit might set them right and perhaps in the very characters they expected to fail  in  Here ended Garrick's lesson I made my bow and departed not doubting but when the autumn approached I should read my name  in the newspapers and as the Apprentice says stuck in large capitals  The part of OTHELLO by a Young Gentleman  But"Hope thou hast told me lies from day to day"  In a week my expedition to Maidstone commenced My mother with much difficulty equipped me with five guineas Capt Forbes gave me a flaming purple satin waistcoat profusely trimmed with silver such was the fashion of those times which I reserved for Sundays and visiting days  I stepped into the Gravesend boat and for one shilling sailed with a fair wind and arrived at the end of my voyage safe but sick and from Gravesend a stagecoach conveyed me to Chathem and the next day in a chaise I arrived at Maidstone It seemed to me a very long journey for going once with my father to Sheerness when about the age of fourteen on some election business for a Mr Taffe of Ireland was my extent of travelling and Richmond Hampton Court and Greenwich what I called going into the country and Cockneylike thought my being once with Captain Forbes to Windsor a tedious journey The country about Maidstone seemed delightful but now it is almost past my remembrance  Mr Garrick had unknown to me spoke to  Miss Bradshaw then of his theatre but now no more to keep me as much as possible under petticoat government and to be one of her party at tea cards c and to observe how I went on and to send him  minute  information In consequence of his request I was admitted like  P  tulant  or  Witwoud  into the female club on first subscribing the proper allotment stated for tea coffee sugar c The quartette consisted of Mrs Bradshaw Mrs Roberts Miss Morrison and myself This brought on not only an acquaintance but a lasting friendship and high esteem between Mrs Hull and me If riches immense could be added to her other good qualities my praise here would not be neglected but read with pleasure The latter part of the season brought Mr Hull she introduced me to that gentleman and with whom good fellowship and good will has from that time and ever will I hope remain between us  Were I to expatiate on the kindnesses I have experienced from Mr and Mrs Hull I should make such a digression as might not be excused and therefore will conclude with thanks and truly wishing them every happiness and prosperity  We opened at Maidstone with the Beaux StratagemArcher Mr Wignell Aimwell Mr Wilkinson Foigard Mr Barrington Dorinda  Mrs Barrington Mrs Sullen Miss MorrisonNot more than five pounds in the house I was much frightened  very imperfect  and more alarmed than when I first sported my figure in the Fine Gentleman the play except as to myself was got through decently The little motley troop from London certainly deserved more attention and encouragement than was bestowed  Mrs Barrington had an excellent wardrobe of her own and being the intimate of Mrs Woffington had the entire treasure of her tragedy jewels which at that time Mrs Barrington eyed as her own property by having nine parts of the law in her favourpossession Her royal train should alone have been sufficient to have allured the country Bumpkins Added to the tragedy diamonds Mr and Mrs Barrington amazed the eyes and ears of the little streets with a very handsome onehorse chair and every noon took a genteel airing they were wellbred sensible and behaved properly to every body there living with oeconomy and every decency which could cause them to be esteemed and respected and were a credit to their profession Our houses were shockingly attended though even I was the Romeo Barnwell Shore Orestes and the Douglas In Douglas without a joke I was very well received but not even my Orestes nor Mrs Barrington's  Andromache could attract a sufficient audience Those who attended we were obliged to dismiss from our booth The consequence was great grumbling great poverty and infinite uneasinesssome weeks not sharing six shillings and what was as badWignell my manager acted Lord Townly and made me perform a Constable a Drawer c which much offended my dignity an error most young actors and actresses are apt to fall into If the performers do not approve of the parts allotted them they will against observation decency and common sense ever take pains to be ridiculous rude and absurd by which behaviour they are certain every judicious thinking spectator bestows the censure on them which such conduct deservesbe it in a village a barn or theatre  A performer will never convert an audience to the belief of finding him worthy of being trusted with a thousand lines if he does not speak  six  with great care attention and propriety What leads actors in some measure into this unfortunate and illconceived practice for their future welfare is listening to idle dissipated companions who too often are termed their friends and encourage them in such behaviour while they are laughing on the stage because they do not know three lines of their damned parts as they term them and  instead of joining the hiss for reformation to make them know themselves and feel the insult they have given the audience applaud them for it and are the occasion of leading the performers next day into what Colley Cibber justly remarks  "A jolly negligence of rehearsals and teach them to become dupes to their own folly"  Players should one and all weekly repeat Shakspeare's advice He is the great masterly explanatorhis single short lesson conveys the whole art and says more to the purpose than any laborious writer could cram into the largest folio  Mr Quin by proper conception of character made his first impression on the public by his respectful manner when acting the Lieutenant of the Tower But had Mr Quin treated it with contempt as I did the Constable he might have missed the happy tide of Fortune and continued in obscurity to the loss of his own future fame and the public would never have seen him as that excellent actor he ever after remained  Mr Quin had wit generosity and a strong understanding and by never forgetting his own dignity he was never forgot by others He obtained the respect and esteem of all his death was as much lamented by all ranks at Bath where he resided as if the first man of quality there had departed this life and possessed of the same good  talents and qualitiesDoctor Mushett now in York will testify my assertion relative to Mr Quin as he attended him to the last and was for years intimately acquainted with him  I have had the pleasure of hearing and seeing that gentleman within these few years at General St Leger's introduce Mr Quin's character in such a manner as to be a striking portrait of that celebrated man A demonstrative proof that however the illiberal the ignorant the malevolent the envious and the enthusiast the conceited or the vain may treat stage professors yet where talents are graced with virtues the actor will be acceptable at any table It is galling to remark but it is a truth that it is the actor which disgraces the stage and not the stage the actor and the vulgar not knowing how to distinguish indiscriminately throw the good and the bad in the same dirty reservoir of disgrace To prove th  assertion true many actresses by the help of natural genius only the gift of God himself have arrived at the summit of fame and fashionas Mrs Oldfield Bracegirdle Cibber Woffington B  ilamy Crawford c But if persons of rank and fortune could offer such respect to stage talents only what difference must they think and  eel when paying that polite tribute where superior talents adorned by virtue are combined in th  name of SIDDONS her example as a wife and mother the greatest need not blush to follow and those who from misfortune labour in a degraded and middling line may be proud to admire and imitate  Mrs Siddons's private worth deserves regard the credit of the stage may always wish it to be preserved and never struck from its annals Mrs Cibber is the only actress my remembrance can compare with Mrs Siddons and Mrs Cibber in five or six parts might be if on the boards and in equal bloom able to occasion the odds but it would be a contest of a confined nature as Mrs Siddons's Lady Macbeth Zara in the Mourning Bride c were characters Mrs Cibber could not have attempted with any degree of comparison and Mrs Siddons in a theatrical lottery would certainly obtain fifteen prizes out of twenty No bad compliment to Mrs Siddons for if her predecessors are to be considered by her admirers as people who knew nothing of the matter her praise must be less on a comparative struggle for victory Certainly where disdain contempt pride or indignation are to be expressed it may safely be affirmed she there stands unrivalled and is herself alone In one passage she always reminds me of Mrs Cibber in voice manner and features where in Isabella she pronounces  "Now I defy younow I laugh at you ye tyrants murderers"  I do not mean to insinuate Mrs Siddons has  ot foibles or faultsI can only say if she has I am not acquainted with them  "But" says  llnature "I am sure she does so and so"  And why so much pains anxiety and labour to insinuate that Mrs Siddons is not a  l perfection Let th  accusers take the same pa  ns to look at their own faults and pluck the beam from their own eye and then fairly make the comparison and let them ever keep in mind  Men's evil manners live in brass their virtues  We write in water  I will conclude Mrs Siddons's panegyric with this wish that every lady on the stage may follow her example in private life and with proper emulation endeavour to surpass or equal her in her public character  Having taken the liberty to be so free with my opinion as to the several stage favorites and having  entioned Mrs Cibber only as competitor with Mrs Siddons I cannot but in justice and gratit  de also with shame recollect I had forgot Mrs Yates's merit not to mention her attractive p  rson Her Margaret of Anjou stands as much u  rivalled as does Mrs Siddons's Zara her Epilogue to that play must not be forgot nor her elegance and various excellencies or Mrs Crawford's  fifth act of Lady Randolph I fancy myself jogged by some Old Critic  "O for shame not to recollect Mrs Pritchard"  Indeed I doher manner and person were clumsy her face not delicate but open and agreeable yet with that large figure she in comedy nay even in the  Fine Ladies  threw all competitors at a distance Her Lady Betty Modish Mrs Sullen Maria and Beatrice were wonderful and her Clarinda was so easy so natural so spirited and vivacio  that in the third act her comic powers were such as to cast all other actresses at so great a distance as made the beautiful Woffington shrink under her superior and combined excellence In tragedy Lady Macbeth was by much her best partand good acting it was but she was not so finely collected throughout as Mrs Siddons is in that character Mr Garrick assured me he did not approve of her tragedy for her scenes of grief were tiresomely blubbering in no part more remarkably so than in the last scene of Volumnia in Coriolanus I had forgot to mention Mrs Cibber though very indifferent indeed as a comic actress but to which she foolishly gave the preference She spoke an epilogue equal if not superior to any lady I remember  To say those Ladies had merit is the true compliment to those of the present day for what modern  performers insinuate that the late actors did  t understand the art of playing is paying themselves a very bad compliment As I observed be  ore if Mrs Cibber had been comparatively an indifferent actress where is the wonder that Mrs Siddons should be superior I urge it is Mrs Cibber's great excellence raises Mrs Siddons's reputation  Indeed were snarlers to advance that music  peras theatres singers and splendid scenery to plays in the present aera were not on a par with the magnificence of the year then indeed all credit might with propriety be rendered doubtful and the names of Barry Cibber or even a Garrick's reputation would require caution and consideration as to the belief  Most undoubtedly the improvements are wonderful but beyond the mark of profit for managers were thirty years ago gentlemen of more than ideal property but now in all the three kingdoms produce me an independent one I wish there were many contradictions to this assertion and myself included in the number  I have made such a digression on stage matters that I have left myself acting the Constable c far behind like the prisoner at large so must return to Maidstone duty where the business was so bad that we were obliged to begin the benefits in hopes  that what our good acting could not produce ye  regard for individuals would soften their hearts and fill the houseI had the Distressed Mother the amount only three poundsmy profit on the expences being deducted was actually  one shilling and sixpence and two pieces of candle  a dismal banquet for Prince OrestesI was reduced to two shillings consequently under the necessity of asking leave of absence like a boy at school for not being a Constable on the Monday and I would return on the Wednesday which being granted I resolved on a long walk being then much more convenient than the stagecoach to Gravesend from thence in the Gravesend boat arrived in London and drained three guineas more from my affectionate motherNecessity has no law Thus replenished I returned back and got to Maidstone on Tuesday night  I had not exposed my poverty to the troop if I had they were neither able nor willing to have relieved meavowed poverty would have lowered me immediately and my five guineas when I first went to Maidstone had enabled me to appear in a genteel decent manner On this my first tour I was grasping for great parts but from timidity and not having time to be perfect my prospect was not the most favourableMiss Bradshaw's secret account a toad eater  the spawn of Adulation did not lead Mr Garrick to any favourable expectations A curious letter of my own to Mr Garrick blotted badly spelt and very incoherent confirmed his then growing ill opinion of me and he had declared from the Maidstone accounts which he relied on that nothing could be done with me Wilkinson was a stupid lad and he had for once deceived his judgment on a sudden surprise  The business grew worse and worsebenefits instead of improving▪ or giving hopes of an approaching harvest overshadowed us with clouds and darkness We were all poor and sulkyneither to be led nor drove  " Soldiers unpaid who hardly did their duty"  The manager by paying his bills c and being what they termed a good stroller who understood well the art of application and solicitation was certain of a good benefit Mr and Mrs Barrington from their dignity carriage and divers marks of distinction also expected the same nay seemed assured of it Now  we  the said soldiers and our lasses did not approve of this determined distinction intended by the inhabitants of Maidstone to feed the rich and let us poor be the marks for Scorn to point its slowly moving finger at The consequence was a conspiracywhich soon burst out and flamed into an open rebellion  a memorial of dissentients was signed and presented  "That as the playhouse in the Star Yard Maidstone was so ill attended and as there were so many sufferers they could not  would not proceed  or act any more in that Booth for the emolument of two or three persons As to continue a fortnight longer would plunge all in the utmost penury and want"  Alluded to numerous inconveniencies therefore unless they were mutual gainers they would not undergo difficulties and distress for the advantage of  the Trio▪  and themselves in want of means for existence This was immediately assented to signed and sealed by the manager and Mr and Mrs Barrington or a revolt the next day was determined This demand cannot be justified on honest grounds because had any one of us four weeks before that been blessed with a crowded house that one would have judged it a robbery to have been compelled by the rest who had failed to have shared the profit amongst them however if poverty is a plea for an act of injustice that point we could prove and swear to with safe consciencesAs we thought Wignell and the Barringtons getting such an amazing sum as nineteen or twenty pounds was too luxurious a prospect while we were in so barren and dreary a state The result was that with the assize week and the two  benefits equally divided matters closed with such brilliancy that on my return to London I was enabled to restore two guineas back to my mother in part of payment for the three she had obtained for me with difficulty and it was a double gift as the received it from that welcome visitor her son  Early in September DruryLane opened and I attended as being then enrolled on the royal list of his Majesty's company of comedians Mr Garrick acted early in Octoberhis second character was Romeo and without having looked or spoke to me or even affording me an opportunity of addressing him when I saw him On the rehearsal of Romeo and Juliet I was summoned on the stage by Cross the prompter who said he had orders from Mr Garrick that I should wait as a Torch Bearer in the last act and also as a Waiting Gentleman in every play On which Mr Garrick advanced and before the company said aloud  "This Sir is my commandand if not complied with I shall take your coat off and do the business myself and you Sir will immediately be dismissed my theatre"  There certainly was a severity in this for though I stood astonished grieved and petrified at this sudden appointment I had not refused and therefore the pointed manner in which he spoke was tyranny in a degree I never then had seen exercised without  provocation I cannot but at the present moment think this unprovoked behaviour in my then situation was cruelty to the extreme What secret pique he had for such sudden treatment I never could learn but he really made me truly miserableand if he aimed at that as an act to gratify ambition he accomplished his purpose  The theatre being for the first month opened three nights in a week my salary was only fifteen shillings as playhouse pay and when got to four nights merely twenty shillings but that pittance was too material an object for me to think of relinquishing I waited as it is termed in the Mourning Bridethe Funeral Procession in Romeo and JulietMacbeth and twice rode a hobby horse in the Field of Battle when Garrick acted Bayes Early in the season Mr Foote was to play Cadwallader in the Author▪ which farce had been produced the winter before and acted with great success Foote was to perform six nights then go to Dublin and return in January and revive the same farce againTh  Author was at that time so fashionable tha  Beckymy dear Becky  was a constant phra  from all ranks of people both high and low  they walked the streets of London I have ev  been supposed a pupil of Mr Foote'sthe fo    wing  circumstance will prove the contrary for on my word of honour I had never seen Mr Foote till that very season behind the scenes exc  pt as a performer on the stagehad I met him  n the street or seen him in a room I do not be  e  e I should have known him The last week of Mr Foote's playing in DruryLane previous  o his intended trip to Ireland he was accidentally with Garrick after his performance of Kitely as was Mr Holland and others The conversation  s I was informed by chance turned on imita  onGarrick said  "Egad Foote there is a young fellow engaged with me who I really think is superior to either of us at mimicryI used to think myself well at it but I actually g  ve him the preference He has tried to resemble me but that will not do though Mrs Garrick sa  s she is sure he will be like me"    "Damn  t" says Foote "I should like to hear him"  Holland with Garrick's approbation came imme  ately to inquire for me I was soon found a the greenroom and escorted to th  a  ager's cabinet assuring me that Mr Garrick  anted to see me on particular business My  art panted with fear doubt and hope on this  expected summons after an awkward entrance  d a silence of a few minutes my suspense was  ed by Mr Garrick very good naturedly saying  that he had spoke well of me to Mr Foote and desired I would satisfy that gentleman with a taste of my quality such as first struck my fancy adding that he expected I would do my best in order to convince his  good  friend Mr Foote that his assertions of my merit were not exaggerated I complied and as the phrase is  took off  s  veral performersBarry Sparks Wossington Ridout Sheridan creceived high encomiums and thanksmade my bow and retired from the august assembly Mr On now living not then on the stage can testify all these parti  ulars  The next day my friend Mr On who was intimate with Foote waited on me with tha  gentleman's compliments intimating that he wa  going to Dublin for a few weeks in five or si  days timeHe had observed Mr Garrick though  me only fit f  r his Hobby Horse in the Rehearsal and if I  ished to be released from such tyranny he would be glad of my company to Ireland  his own  and he would fix me on genteel  erms with Mr Sheridanthat I should appear in Othello and he would act Iago Th  was a cheering cordial elixir to my droopi  spirits and to my still more drooping pocket turned over in my mind several of the Irish f  milies mentioned in the early part of this work  d that was one inducementanother was my situation might be bettered but it could not be worse and on a short reflection I desired my re  pe  tful compliments with my mother's appro  on to Mr Foote and was apprehensive I  ight incur Mr Garrick's displeasure and if I sh  uld be so unfortunate as not to meet with a fa  urable reception in Ireland I should in consequence thereof be greatly involved on my return to England if I should be expelled from Drurv  ane theatre for though the pittance I then re  ed was small yet trifling as it was it was my only support but if Mr Foote could obtain Mr Garrick's permission I would gladly embrace the offer begging that Mr On on the delivering my message would not omit my sense of Mr Foote's kindness and good opinion Mr On und  rtook this embassy most cheerfully and ex  c  t  d  t with friendship and punctuality Mr  te without loss of time waited on Mr Garrick t  at very day and acquainted him with what ha  pa  s  d and obtained my leave of absence for  weeks  On the evening I met my Master Garrick at  th  atre who consirmed the above treaty and  he was glad of an opportunity to serve me  h  ped it would turn out advant  geous but  s it was probable as well as possible the expedition  might fail and I might not meet with success he had from his motives of tenderness fo  me consulted with Mr Lacey his brother manager and that I might not want an asylum  n case of failure and disappointments he had ordered an article to be drawn up for two years from that day the th of October to the end of the season  The managers giving me their consent for an absence of six weeks with Mr Foote I dared not object to the proposal and indeed thought his reasons friendly and afforded a prospect of bread for two years by which time I hoped that warmer days might come The article of course was prepared and signed My equipment was poorly providedmy old black was my only suit a small pair of bags easily contained my wardrobe My mother dreaded this long voyage and being used to vexation and crossesexperience made her give me but little hopes from Irish hospitality or the appearance of a shabby distressed lad soliciting favours  For friends will fly you in the time of need  From lodging livelihood and support al  that my mother could spare to give me to supply my empty purse with was six shillings bu  luckily Mrs Wardale the lady of Carlisle beforementioned hearing of my journey an  knowing mine and my mother's inability presented me with two guineas I took leave of my affe  tionate parentmet Mr Foote at the Bed  rd Arms and in one hour after set off with  im in a post chaise and his servant on horseb  k We only travelled that night to his little  ttage at Elstree in Hertfordshire Two days a  ter that we dined at Kitty Keney's at West Chester and the following day went with Captain Bonfoy who was then commander of the Royal Yacht for ParkGate as the Captain said he would sail that afternoonhere we were detained  th se  eral persons of fashion who had been impatiently attending on the caprice of the wind Mr Hill an elderly gentleman Lord Macartney Mr Leeson now Lord Milltown and several others we all went on board but all returned as the wind continued obstinate We all messed together for Foote's company as he was well acq  ainted with each was the only treat that truly dreary place ParkGate could afford Our patien  e being exhausted it was unanimously agreed that we should proceed to Holyhead horses were hiredthis was early in November and was not pleasing to me who had never rode twenty miles on horseback in my life however there was no alternative as I was become a dependent traveller and must submit to follow I though  we were all to have set off togetherthey went at seven o'clock in the morning requesting Foote's company at each house they stopped at but Foote and myself remained behind and on my asking him the reason of his delay he answered that it was a rule of his and worth my observationthat whenever he met with persons of distinction and fortune on the road travelling to small inns as was and is the case on the Welch roads he made it a rule always to be half a day behind or before them as with all their politeness they expected the best accommodations or if they were so kind as to offer you a preference you could not in policy or good manners accept such an offer therefore you never could on such a journey be well suited or attended unless by being the stage at least before or after them and if going to another inn the landlady of the neglected house would pique herself on her behaviour to convince her guests they had paid the compliment of preference not to her only but for their own comfort and advantage  I performed this journey on horseback better than I expected and was truly struck with wonder on passing the stupendous mountains of Penmanmeaur and Penmenbough Indeed Penmanmeaur then not only from its astonishing height but from its perilous and immediate drop into the  roaring deep gave every idea of horror which the P  ets pen could describe It is not so tremendous now for though that mountain still  its lofty head above the clouds yet a  read is at present cut for a carriage which  was not and instead of falling from the pr  pi  e into the deep if your horse stumbled t  re is a friendly wall to secure you from such  dangerHolyhead in Wales is about  tytwo miles from West Chester there we  e detained again some days and strange but true the high living with the persons at that place and a severe cold had kept me ill in bed most p  t of that day the wind changed but it changed to a violent storm  Will Fortune never come with both hands full  And at nine at night all dark and dismal did we roll in the boat belonging to the Pacquet over waves most dreary to behold for the whiten  ss of the breakers shone double from the darkness of the night When handed into the pacquet I asked for a bed but they were all secured not even one for Mr Footeas plenty of cash from the great people had made that request  possible to be complied with The cabin was  edged like the blackhole at Calcutta The  multuous moving of the ship soon made my  inquiries after a bed of down quite needless for I sunk on the boards where my poverty bags were my only pillow and there I lay tossed in the most convulsive sickness that can be imagined I have seen many suffer by this sea malady but never I verily think such an object of commiseration as myself The storm increased but the wind was fair for Irelandas to death I was so truly sick that I was very indifferent whether I sunk or swam Mr Foote was tolerably well and walking most of the night from place to place  Thank God we arrived safe in Dublin Bay about twelve o'clock and by one was taken in a Dunlarey hoy to Dublin Quay a coach conveyed us to a tavern in CollegeGreen where we were regaled I say we though I continued very sick and much out of order Indeed my stomach was ever inflated and disturbed with a bilious complaint which may be called hereditary and that added to my irregular mode of living and neglect of healthful exercise should make me thankful it has not yet entirely overthrown me In about an hour Mr Foote went to the lodgings provided for him and left me to take care of myself I inquired for a hotel and was directed to one on Essex Quay to which place I took coach where overpowered with illness sickness and fatigue I went to bed and lay till Monday noon  but in a comfortless state I rung the bell for breakfast but it did not afford relief and about four o'clock in the afternoon crawled to the house I remembered to have left the day before in CollegeGreen where I had some soup chicken and wine and after sitting full two hours fancied myself better owing to the momentary spirits the wine had given me Paying for my repast I inquired of the waiter where Mrs Chaigneau  ved he replied just over the way This was agreeable intelligence as indeed that was the  amily the reader I hope will kindly recollect I so particularly mentioned in the first part of my historyThen my fluttering heart hoped welcome to the poor the orphan and the stranger next the apprehension of a rebuff occurred but distress of situation pushed me on and to the house as directed I wentWhen I advanced with trembling and tottering steps to the corner palace and enquiring if Mrs Chaigneau was at home I was answered with an affirmativeI desired the servant to acquaint his mistress that a person from England requested to speak with her and after waiting a few minutes which my impatience doubled a thin looking lady entered the room but I could not recollect a feature or any likeness to resemble the form I expected to  ehold but supposed time or illness might have  made heavy inroads on the brittle framewith the utmost agitation I presumed to inquire if her name was Chaigneau The lady answeredYes I then ventured to pronounce Madam I flatter myself you recollect me when you was in England my name is Wilkinson son of the late Doctor Wilkinson of the Savoy She answered indeed Sir you are mistaken This was a thunder stroke as my fears interpreted it a wilful disclaiming of her knowledge of me but I was after a pause relieved by her looking serious and repeating to herself  ilkinson Wilkinsonand suddenly said O young gentleman I beg your pardon believe I can now clear up this mistake in which we both are at present involvedI have often heard your father and mother mentioned in terms of the highest regard by my brother and sister ChaigneauYou as a stranger have made a mistake as to the house I am married to Mr John Chaigneau brother to Mr William Chaigneau and to whose house you have been wrongly directedthey live in AbbeyStreet I not knowing the way she requested her servant might call a coach for me which was instantly done as there was then and always is a stand of coaches in CollegeGreen I took my leaveapologized for the trouble I had given was drove to Abbey Street and on my road over Essex Bridge was  va  tly pleased at seeing the number of lamps sedan chairs carriages hackney coaches footmen with flambeaux c as it appeared to resemble another London When arrived at Abbey Street and the awful rap was given I was not only from frequent misfortunes and disappointments all flutter but found myself not well yet I gave myself the comfort to attribute it to  ancied illness proceeding from anxiety distress and unaccustomed fatigue and therefore hoped  t would go off The first answer to my inquiry at Mr William Chaigneau's door from the servant was that he could not tell whether either his master or mistress were at home or not but woul  go and see he soon returned with an answer more potent than the first That they were both at home and what was more fortunate they were without company I had no sooner entered the room where they were sitting thenthen whatwhy to proceed requires the  best  of novel pens to present fulfil and do service to the seene that followed This generous Mr William Chaigneau and wife were on the list of the few instances where  Mutual temper with unclouded ray  Could make to morrow welcome as to day  Their pleasures were the sametheir affections were the same Their instantaneous recollection  of methe great intimacy between the familiesmy father's death and calamities being so lately public and now refreshed to their memory revived the idea of their own distress from the loss of their darling child the infantmarriage between me and that daughter my present assured unfortunate helpless situation with a look of desponding hope dependent on their feelings all collected rushed on their alternate sudden thoughts with such quick transitions as made them all combined too mighty for Mrs Chaigneau's tender spirits indeed so powerfully that the fictitious distress of Lady Randolph on the stage was by no means equal to her poignant sense of my misery and situation and it was actually sometime before she could recover herself with any degree of composure to inquire what had brought me there or what could be done to serve me Mr Chaigneau was also greatly agitated but not to so extravagant a degree as my good benefactress as she afterwards proved to the utmost extent After a little composure and my full relation of what had happened to my mother and myself since the fatal marriage act passed a comfortable supper was set on the table After which pleasing ceremony they assured me that every exertion in their power and all their friends and connexions I might as much depend  upon as if the welfare of their own son was the person whose interest they were to plead for  During a short interval I felt elated beyond myself the transition was so wonderful but alas how fleeting are human joys as to pain hope or sorrow For soon after this pleasing unforeseen sensation of rapture I suddenly sunk into an heavy  everish languor not in my power to uphold Mrs Chaigneau exclaimed  "My God Tate is ill"  Her words were propheticI wished and tried to shake it off but all in vaindisorder and de  rium grew too powerful my head felt dreadfully deranged My real friends in every sense of the word were alarmed Mrs Chaigneau declared the co  ld not permit me by any means to return to the hotel in such a state of apparent illness as I then seemed to labour under They sent to the next door engaged a comfortable lodging for me and provided me with hockwine whey and  ch accommodations as they thought imme  iately necessary The ensuing day instead of finding myself relieved I was seized most dangero  sly by an outrageous miliary fever I had  rom their wonderful attention and regard the attendance of one of the first physicians then in Dublin Doctor Lucas and their own apothe  ary with a constant careful nurse Mrs Chaigneau preferred waiting on Tate to the luxury o  company She and her cousin Mrs Carty during the day were seldom from my bedside A stranger to have seen Mrs Chaigneau weeping over me must have supposed it her own dying son she was lamenting I have often heard her repeat that except the death of her dearly beloved daughter she never suffered such distress and said it awakened so strongly the remembrance of the sudden loss of her only child ever by her to be lamented that it excited her feelings beyond the power of restraining them and recollection brought fresh to her memory her long intimacy with my worthy mother and knowing her life of almost perpetual sorrow by affliction heaped on affliction and viewing in every light my helpless situation these all conjoined was too much for her spirits to support  In that outrageous fever did I continue and in a truly lamentable state with a complication of distraction and agony for near three weeks blisters on my ancles and every physical torture to increase my miseries Mr Chaigneau often used to joke and say what an expensive guest I was to him for his old hock the quantity I drank in whey by his account was incredible However Providence aiding my youth brought me once more into the world and here I must not omit my sincere and grateful acknowledgments to God  For good reader will you believe it that all this time of my severe suffering notwithstanding Mr Foote must have heard I had left the hotel and  ern with evident marks of indisposition he ne  er once to the disgrace of Christianity be it asserted▪ made inquiry whether I was living or dead or if living whether I had decent necessaries  d with regret I am obliged to relate that had I  left dependent on his care though such an  ect of compassion I had never from the dictates of his feelings or pity his honesty or honour  to give this relation of my illness and I  ould have remained for him truly destitute  ng no mother or friend that he knew of in I  eland  o close my eyes but God raised me friends therefore I have indeed reason to rejoice and praise my Maker  Before I was able to go abroad or even to leave my apartment I sent my compliments to Mr  ote to acquaint him where I was for Mr and Mrs Chaigneau were so offended at such brutality of behaviour towards me that neither of them  ad  ven him any intelligence concerning me  r Foote on my information waited on Mr  ig  eau and by way of apology said he could  s  e me for three or four days for fear of  ching the infection from the feverprofessed  imself anxious to supply my wants which he  was informed was at that time quite unnecessary After that he waited on me as my most  anxious  friendand in about three weeks I recovered so fast by the help of my good nurses that I dined every day with my preserving angels at the next door was attended every noon with jellies c and what was more extraordinary had my chariot every morning at the door to take my daily a  ringO gemini a coach  The scene was changed  Was alter'd quite  And indeed it was as sudden and unexpected a metamorphose as that of the Cobbler's Wife in the Devil to Pay  As soon as I was able to be taken by my patrons a visiting an elegant suit of clothes was provided for me that I might be a credit and  not  by my threadbare appearance disgrace either my friends or myself Mr and Mrs Chaigneau introduced me to all their acquaintance nor could they be pleased more than by any act of kindness that was bestowed on me Their connections were particularly numerous Mr William Chaigneau being principal agent to most of the regiments on the Irish establishment and was consequently universally known and likewise respected  All the families in Ireland with whom my father and mother had formerly been intimate in  London proved by innumerable acts of genero  ty and true zeal for my welfare that friendship i  sometimes more than a name Their deeds and actions to me gave full evidence of their part  lity nor do I in this account deceive the reader with the smallest particle that is erroneous for there are those that are living who can attest it  inutely Yet were I now to land in this said Dublin where I was thirtytwo years ago univer  ly acquainted the theatres excepted I do  t know one house I could with propriety approachSuch quick and certain havock does that said voracious monster Death make with mankind On my visiting abroad I was soon in  ed to Lord Forbes's in Stephen's Green also to the Kellys Alderman and Mrs Forbes Achesons Callages John Chaigneau's Coates's Hamiltons c and received particular favours from those persons as well as from Lord Clambrasil Lo  d Bellamont Lord Milltown Mr Hill Miss Knoxes c c At each of the above families in the full meaning of the word I had a home and I never received a cool look unless for staying away though a favour may be bestowed with an ill gra  e and I will beg leave here to give an instance Lord Forbes I had been used to see frequently in London even from the time of my wearing  ro  ks and I am certain his invitations in Dublin  were intended most friendly and his will was ever to serve me but one day on dining with his Lordship when several persons of quality were invitedthe bottle our sun of the table after dinner moved quickly round and as the wine circulated not feeling any restraint and his Lordship not being a  ranger to me I very heartily sm  cked my lips and said  "O my Lord this is excellent wine"  On which he paused and looking f  ll at me by which means he drew the attention of the whole company said with a satirical smile  "Pray Tate what or who has made you a judge of wine Never give your judgement in company as to wine for in a young man like you it is not becoming or proper"  This effectually silenced me nay it did worse than that for it made me feel my inferiority and I  as abashed and unhappy till released that evening from the company of the great and which two hours before had greatly ela  ed me Nor do I think it excusable in any rank whatever by any speech or look to lessen the guest in  ted in the presence of others for bread and cheese at home is preferable though the dependent's dinner may be termed an honourFrom such honour with  s  ch behaviour  heaven defend meThat Lord  orbes had a more than common right to give his free sentiments to me is cert  in  and beyond doubt meant it well is as certain but time and place in many things make  ch material difference as the same actions suit not all men alike for had his Lordship privately r  primanded me it would have been an obligation but in the manner he did itI to this moment  ink it was cruel and ill bred It made such an i  pression that notwithstanding after that I had a general invitation from him which I could not  r  m duty and policy avoid accepting yet I always w  hed the hour of visiting his Lordship was over  This leads me to a like anecdote which suddenly and impulsively bursts on my recollection A  st es  eemed gentleman in the spacious county of York whose polished understanding and manners were universally acknowledged and admired even to the extent of popularity in the great world  me few years since desired to patronise a pla  I sent my treasurer with the catalogue as is usual on such occasions to any leading person but on looking over the list of tragedies comedies and  rc  s he declared he could not determine and desired Mr Wilkinson would attend him and his party after dinner at the inn where he then for a few days resided Which mandate I obey  and without being arrogant in my idea  s his Majesty's patentee undoubtedly exp  ted being favoured with fitting at the cheerful  board and holding some chit chat relative to the play and farce that he intended to sanction Instead of such usual and indeed common civility after waiting a considerable time in the bar I was at length ushered into the room where the company had dined when Sir beckoned me to approach him at the upper end of the table where I impertinently expected to have sat down but neither found a vacancy or the waiter even ordered to produce me a chair Sir discoursed relative to the playthen of York city graciously observed I had acted Bayes so as to merit his approbation and to heighten the compliment remarked he was no judge as he seldom visited the theatre either in London or elsewhere At length he condescendingly asked me to drink a glass of wine which I begged to decline but he requested a worthy and respectable gentleman now living to give a glass the which he handed as if I had been a common porter waiting for a message For I actually stood all the while at the backs of their chairs I was most truly happy to depart and from that day lost all anxiety or ray of inclination to pay my devoirs or wait on that great man who was then termed the  Grandison  of the age  I would attribute this to want of thought at the time but I do not see how that could be the  c  se for so long a space where sense and good breeding were by all allowed to be the characteristic qualities of that gentleman I am aware I  hall be blamed by particular persons for mentioning the above but in order to disarm  unfair  angerfive minutes pause and a little allowance may save my condemnation If I restrained my  e  f from relating little matters which have pleased  r vexed meI should by such a rule be depriv  of the liberty of expressing my thoughts when  erently affected I dare say although it is a  ct which I have related it will be argued it night have been omitted I subscribe to that  pinion but then let every feeling mind con  d  r that if I am allowed the freedom to express my being hurt by a person of quality in Ireland a  d to whom I was so greatly obliged I cert  inly have a right to mention the other in  ngland for unless respect due to his rank and character obligations I had none and in con  usion it was only a speck upon Ermine  But his present Grace the Duke of Norfolk's be  a  iour to me is as great a contrast I could fill a  olume with encomiums but that would offend  mand he is so universally known and beloved that what I could say would be only superfluous  " To grace a title that was rich before  " To gild refined gold  " Is wasteful and ridiculous excess"  His Grace of Norfolk is plain in his attire possesses wit accompanied with infinite understanding that leads his natural temper which is gracious and condescending in his manner friendly and honourable and is ever endeavouring to promote the cheerfulness and happiness of others▪ Yet let not that easy manner betray Ignorance into the error of being too familiar for though his Grace's strong sense and good nature may smile and pardon yet that person will find himself egregiously wrong who supposes that the first of his Majesty's subjects in the kingdom of Great Britain  ever  forgets  he is the Duke of Norfolk  Therefore let inferiors out of regard to themselves bridle their familiarity and always remember that every deference is justly due  Permit my Lord Duke to sink his own rank to render himself still more agreeable and bestow heartfelt joy at the sprightly board but Ignorance  beware of too much encroachment lest such impolicy incur his secret contempt and like Macbeth's vaul  ing ambition you o'erleap yourself and fall on the other side To those who are honoured with the acquaintance of his Grace of Norfolk or to those who are strangers I would pourtray my ideas of that nobleman in the words of Home That  In his eye  Sits Observation in each glance of thought  Decision follows as the thunderb  lt  Pursues the flash  But having carried myself into Yorkshire as I l  e travelling let me now return to my station in Dublin Near Christmas I began to think of making my appearance on the stag  Mr Chaigneau invited Mr Sheridan the manager Mr Victor and Mr Foote to dinner Mr Foote's  me of acting drew near an expiration he had played Cadwallader in particular with great suc  e  Lord Foppington Sir Paul Plyant Bayes F  ndlewife Buck c He said to Mr Chaig  u at dinner that he thought it necessary for Mr Wilkinson to make his appearance on the Dublin stage before he departed all joined in the  me opinion Mr Chaigneau wished me to see the theatre Mr Victor was to dine with him the next day in a familyway and to take me t  reMr Sheridan was all politeness The first  aw was in the lattices with Mr Victor which  are what is called in London the  the play was the Recruiting OfficerMr  first appearance in that kingdom in the  a  ter of Captain Plume he has since given  rsal satisfaction both as manager and actor  Ireland and his merit is now well known and  confirmed in England Foote acted Brazen Isaac Sparks Kite Sylvia by a Miss Kennedy who soon retired well provided for by the generosity of Mr L Gardener  It was appointed for me to appear the Monday following in Mr Foote's  Tea  in the character o  a pupil under Mr Puzzle the supposed directo  of a rehearsalMr Puzzle by Mr Foote H  sent me a part called Bounce but which I begged as the time was so short to decline and as I did no attend any rehearsal it was agreed that I shoul  appear as Mr Wilkinson his pupil when calle  upon and repeat just what I could select to pleas  myselfnot any regular character  When the night came Lord Forbes Mr Chaigneau and all my friends went to encourag and support me and engaged all they knew  o the same purpose One lucky circumstance wa  my not being known as a performer therefore had their wishes and pity in a high degreebu great fear of my not being able to succeed Th story of my distressed situationthe blazoned marriageactmy being a young gentlemanmy illness c c were become topics of public conversation As to intelligence requested by critics fro  the players relative to myself they neither did n  could pronounce with knowledge either good  ill But I will rather suppose five out of six spo  my disadvantage from the too general depra  ty of human nature as persons listen to satire  ther than praise It is more descriptive displays  e tripping tongue and suits conversation much  etter it gives energy to the informant and  ears to the languidThe bill ran thus  After the PLAY  Mr FOOTE will give TEA  Mr PUZZLE the Instructor Mr FOOTE  First PUPIL by a YOUNG GENTLEMAN  Who never appeared on any Stage before  By eight in the evening I was in full dress behind the scenes I had never been there before the company were all strangers to me I not knowing how to enter into conversation with the per  ormers and being announced as a pupil of Mr Foote's I did not receive any civility from them  or if I was a blockhead I was not worth their  o  ce and if an impudent imitator or mimic of  heir profession bred by Mr Foote in the same  rthy art I was in their opinions a despicable  tr  der I could conceive all this and certain  my situation on this critical night was not to be  as their sentiments though not avowed  re the result of nature I on  eflection soon  w weary of my so  itary seat in the greenroom  alone in a crowd and between the play and farce looked through a hole in the curtain and beheld an awful pleasing sighta crowded splendid audiencesuch as might strike the boldest with dismay  The farce began and Mr Foote gained great applause and roars of laughter succeeded In the second act my time of trial drew near in about ten minutes I was called  "Mr Wilkinson Mr Wilkinson"  Had I obeyed a natural impulse I was really so alarmed that I should have run away But honour pricked me onthere was no alternativemy brain was a chaos but on I went and must have made a very sheepish timid appearance as from fear late illness and apprehension I trembled like a frighted clown in a pantomime which Foote perceiving good naturedly took me by the hand and led me for  ard when the burst of applause was wonderful and apparently that of kindness and true benevolence but it could not instantly remove my timidity and I had no prompter to trust to as all  ep  n  ed on myself  Foote p  rceiving I was not fit for action said to his two friends on the stage seated like Smith and Johnson in the Rehearsal  "This young gentleman is merely a novice on the stage he has not yet been properly drilled But come my  young friend walk across the stage breath  yourself and shew your figure"  I did so the walk encouraged me and another loud applause  cceeded I felt a glow which seemed to say  "What have you to fear Now or  never  This is the night that either makes you or undoes  quite"  And on the applause being repeated  to myself that is as loud as any I have heard  to Mr Garrick I mustered up  and began with Mr Luke Sparks of Lon  brother to Isaac Sparks then in Dublin in t  e character of Capulet Most of the gent  men in the boxes knew all the London p  ayers and no play in London was so familiar t  e  as Romeo and Juliet They were universal  y struck with the forcible manner of the speaking and the striking resemblance of the features a particular excellence in my mode of mimicry A gentleman cried out  "Sparks of London Sparks of London"  The applause resounded  n to my astonishment and the audience were equally amazed as they found  something  where t  ey in fact expected  nothing  Next speech was their favourite Barry in Alexander universally known and as universally felt I now found myself vastly elated and clever Fear was vanished and joy and pleasure succeeded a proof what ba  met  rs we are how soon elated and how soon  depressedWhen quite at ease I began with Mrs Woffington in Lady Macbeth and Barry in Macbeth The laughter which is the strongest applause on a  comic  occasion was so loud and incessant that I could not proceed This was a minute of luxury I was then in the region of bliss I was encored yet that lady had declared in London on hearing I was to go with Foote to Ireland  "Take me off a puppyIf he dare attempt it by the living Gd he will be stoned to death"  Here the lady was mistaken for on repeating the part the second applause was stronger than the preceding A sudden thought occurred I felt all hardyall alertall nerveand immediately advanced six steps and before I spoke I received the full testimony of "true imitation" My master as he was called sat on the stage at the same time I repeated twelve or fourteen lines of the very prologue he had spoke that night being called for to the Author and he had almost every night repeated I before Mr Foote presented his other self the audience from repetition were as perfect as I was his manner his voice his oddities I so exactly hit that the pleasure the glee it gave may easily be conceived to see and hear the mimic mimicked and it really gave me a complete victory over Mr Foote for the suddenness of the action tripped up his  dacity so much that he with all his effrontery sat foolish wishing to appear equally pleased with the audience but knew not how to play that difficult part he was unprepared the surprise and satisfaction was such that without any conclu  on the curtain was obliged to drop with re  terated bursts of applause They are remarkable in Dublin  when pleased  to continue applauding  ill the curtain falls often not suffering the play to finish This was a compliment frequently paid to Mr Sheridan  Foote once said to that gentleman very seriously  "My dear Sheridan I wish you would relieve yourself of a great deal of labour and trouble"  "In what manner" says Sheridan "do inform me and I shall be obliged to you"  "Why" says Foote "instead of Richard the Third act King Henry in that tragedy"  "Good God Mr Foote why should I relinquish Richard where you are a witness I get such universal applauseGive me your reason"  "O" says Foote "the best reason in the world for if you will perform Henry instead of Richard the play will finish in the first act and the players may all go home in good time to supper"  When the farce called Tea was concluded I had great congratulations paid seriously and ironically Mr Foote affected to be vastly pleased  but in truth it was merely affectation so differently do we feel for ourselves when ridicule is pointed at us but he said it was perfectly well judged to make free with him yet he did not think it very like himself for it certainly was my  worst  imitation but he rejoiced at my good fortune In truth Mr Foote got the cas  not me what I did was for him as he acted on shares and the fuller the house the greater was his profit He was piqued and chagrined▪ but as he had kept within no bounds himself and made free with all characters whatever stage pulpit bar public and private peculiarities benefactors patrons friends as well as foes he could not with any degree of sense appear displeased or censure me for what I had done but kept his resentment locked up for a more proper and convenient opportunity as he considered the repetition of himself in my imitations was to his advantage by the evident partiality the public had shewn me he made himself therefore tolerably easy and may be truly said to have  pocketted  the affront  The conversation the next day particularly of all my eager partial friends was an universal cry of  "Foote outdone Foote outdone the pupil the master"  and this was greatly assisted by their agreeable disappointment for I do not believe any one of them however warm they might have  been in their wishes for my welfare but trembled for the event they felt unhappy lest I should make a despicable attempt and be universally disapproved and then reflected within themselves  "Good Heaven what is to become of this poor youth what can he do for a subsistence"  After my performance from the success I had met with I could neither eat drink or sleep that night pleasant dreams I needed not my waking thoughts were so much superior  The  Tea  was acted in regular succession several nights nay it was commanded by the Duke and Duchess of Bedford his Grace was at that time Lord Lieutenant  The  Rehearsal  was repeated in which I performed the Princess Chloris Being well dressed  y likeness and serious acting  alamode  Woffington procured me great applause though in so  a part Let it be here considered that the  itation was universally felt above and below as Mrs Woffington lad played three years in  her salary not less than  l per  season and  benefits She was also very conspicuous at  he head of the court party with which she had certainly no business to interfere but as Scrub  "It must be a plot because there was a woman in it"  and that party increased the heat of  he patriots and in the end though it made her  more public it all ended in the destruction of the theatre and the banishment of the manager who relied on something better and secretly expected from courtiers' promises that his greatness would rise from his destructionBut plays without his own learning might have taught him betterAlas▪ who wants not teaching  Mrs Woffington being so well known to all ranks and degrees was of infinite assistance to me as an imitator After the first night of my performance Mr Sheridan appointed me a salary of three guineas per week and requested with my approbation which was readily obtained that Mr Foote would write to Mr Garrick to grant permission for my continuance in Dublin till the end of February Foote was oblige  to go to England with all speed as he had staid beyond his time but I was left behind waiting for Mr Garrick's answer to Mr Sheridan's request but which soon arrived and granted the petition requested by Mr Foote  Before January expired I played Cadwallader spoke the prologue and acted Othello with much applause and credit to myself the latter was certainly a very bold attempt for by the bye Barry had performed that his favourite character repeatedly two winters before Mr King performed Iago and Miss G Philips Mrs Jordan's mother Desdemona Here it would be  unjust and ungrateful in me not to reflect with pleasure on the great civilities and kindnesses which I received from Mr and Mrs King in that early stage of life There are different kinds of memories a good memory a bad memory and a convenient memory What I am going to re  elate requires a bad memory as not proper to be retained but I insert it to please myself and being a  sweet  story will with it refresh the memory of my friend Mr King  This said Mr Thomas King had set his heart on well preparing a new pantomime in order to give his manager Mr Sheridan a lift and it was advertised for the Thursday but it was not fit for preparation on the Wednesday It was called the Whim or Harlequin Villager As Mr King is and ever was indefatigable he was determined to be at the theatre the whole Wednesday night that he might be a spur to industry and observe that the painters carpenters c were strictly at their duty and to make the time pass more pleasantly in his dreary mansion for a large theatre certainly is so when only lighted with three or four pieces of candle and being a spot where murders of various kinds are weekly committed and where ghosts undoubtedly are known to stalk he therefore to cheer his spirits desired Mrs King and myself to be with him  in the greenroom we agreed but I made it conditional which was provided we had something to eat as well as to drink as muttonchops or beefsteaks He assented and Mrs King agreed to cook them and I was to assist her About ten o'clock wine rum and oranges entered the room and the muttonchops properly sprinkled with pepper and salt were placed in order on the wellrubbed gridiron which a servant set close to the fender waiting for further orders I complained of cold and the only seat in the greenroom was as usual benched round and immoveable Chairs were called fortwo were immediately broughtI answered for procuring a third for myselfand recollecting Mrs Fitzhenry's dressing apartment was adjoining to the greenroom where I had seen an elbowchair and Mrs Fitzhenry as Hermione sitting in her royal robes I went in the dark seized the chair by the elbows but when I brought it near the fireside by a sudden jerk off flew the bottom and O ye powers by the violence of the shock the regalia the treasures of Queen Elizabeth and Cleopatra rushed like a golden tide over our muttonchops and bright gridiron Reader turn the leaf and guess the rest or do not guess at all just which suits your fancy However for one hour it cured all complaints of cold or hunger While we retired the servants of the theatre  had the disagreeable trouble to assist to put the room in order which indeed required some patience and care to accomplish When the stable was cleansed eating was out of the question we had an excellent bowl of punch which proved salutary palatable and restored us to harmony and we passed two or three very cheerful friendly hours  Early in February I received the following letter from my mother it may not be thought worthy attention to readers in general but every parent will be pleased with the genuine language of Nature I shall therefore occasionally introduce a few letters as they occurred from a pattern of  arental goodness  To Mr WILKINSON  Abbeystreet Dublin  MY DEAR TATE  I reckoned every day and hour until I heard how you got over so daring a part as that of Othello is said to be which by the information of yesterday's letter from Ireland I find you have executed beyond my expectation My wishes for all the joy pleasure and advantage in that way of life with unsullied reputation you may be assured of with the same from Mr Townsend's where the account of this great character was as impatiently wished for as by myself It gives me great pleasure to hear  you are looked upon as so considerable a person in Dublin and am of your opinion that in all respects you will never find the stage again so much suited to your own humour  I dined yesterday in Deanstreet with Lady Forbes the two Miss Wilsons there and the Captain just come home We had a very good dinner and were all in good humour and very merry I got home by day to meet your letter then to Mrs Townsend's with the contents  You don't say one word of Mr and Mrs Chaigneau nor the Kellys I take for granted they are all well and went to see Othello The house at Covent Garden is quite forsaken and Rich gives away his box tickets by the dozen  Mrs Davis has wrote that she will send snuff by you to Lady Forbes I would have you pay your respects there now and then as I believe his Lordship to be what he professes Beg you would present my most sincere and grateful respects in Abbeystreet wishing a long continuance of good spirits and lasting satisfaction  I am your most affectionate mother G WILKINSON  London  January  PS  An IMPROMPTU by Miss JONES Upon hearing that you played the part of  Cadwallader  in the style of FOOTE who was then acting the same part at DruryLane  " ONE night when sleepless in my bed  Garrick ran strangely in my head  His legs so handsometho' they're short  The man's just form'd for play and sport  Hear a new wonder in his praise  Beyond a Lear or matchless Bayes  Wide is the space by sea and land  From Drury's House to Dublin's Strand  Yet in one instant I'll engage  A FOOT he'll place upon each stage"  It had not at this time been usual to have plays acted on Saturday nights as they never had turned out beneficial or fashionable though put into practice when Woodward and Barry opened at Crowstreet and from use soon became as good a night as any other for the manager but not I believe to this day as a benefitThe prevalence of custom is astronishinga Lady in London will go to a known bad opera on the Saturday and though she professes being an amateur in music will not go on the Tuesday though a good opera because it  is  Tuesday A Lady will go to the theatre at Edinburgh Bath and York though to the most indifferent play and as indifferently  acted on the Saturday  because  it is Saturday yet the best acted comedy shall be offered to the public at either of those three theatres on any other night and be totally neglected unless it is hinted that the night is to be fashionable which alters the case At Hull the house would not even be a decent one to whatever play might be performed if it  was  a Saturday unless the fashion At Doncaster and Wakefield there is not any material distinction as to nights  I am led to these observations by recollecting when in Dublin on this my first excursion I judged it necessary early in February to wait upon Mr Sheridan in order to appoint a night for my benefit which had been stipulated to be in that month in consequence of my continuing with him Mr Sheridan observed that my being a young man and a stranger it could never answer for me to venture on the expences of the theatre the charge being forty pounds but at present sixty or seventy pounds per night But he had an expedient to serve me more effectually which was to permit me the privilege of disposing of tickets dividing the sum taken for those tickets between us and he would himself play and secure its being serviceable to me In fa  t this secret service of his playing he thought would make my strenuous friends pour in tickets and he  ap great advantage by them and by his playing a great favour on a benefit make himself appear in an advantageous light and as generous humane and full of pityHis throne again  the necessity of a second abdication from  he towering walls of CrowStreet  in terrorem  ly rearing their lofty heads in stately    To this act of liberality I objected and with  re degree of spirit abided by my express engagement though  verbal  and referred him to the  of my friends He now plainly perceived  would make him appear in a mercenary and  o  n light therefore he gave up the point but  the same time observed Mr Wilkinson I cannot g  e you a night in February unless you will  ake a Saturday and to this proposal from necessity I consented That article being settled he complained that I was not studied in farce parts to b  of service to him which indeed was true and further observed that instead of the performers whom I had taken the liberty to bring into company where they were not he judged it would  ave a better effect if I would exhibit the  of the performers where they actually were  introduce imitations of such as were at that very time acting in Dublin I observed to him that I had not had leisure to have paid a sufficient  attention to that company as objects for imitation it could not be the work of a week or a month besides were I capable if I should take that freedom they would most likely not only insult me but make it a plea to refuse acting for my benefit That argument seemed with Mr Sheridan to have but little weight he persisted angrily I then intimated that if I complied I hoped he would not have any objection to my using his name and that I did not do it of my own accord but had his express command for that purpose and further urged Surely Sir will they not think it unkind of the manager that he should order a satirical performance on them which they must feel and term a cruelty in their governor to inflict Mr Sheridan seemed much vexed said that what he had asked me to do was to get me applause and to serve  me  not  himself  but he should by no means consent to my exposing the peculiarities of his actors and actresses under the sanction of his desire and approbation he wished it to come before the audience as a sudden surprise and as my own voluntary act and after that had been done he would have taken care to have had it so called for by the audience as to prevent a possibility of the performers' anger being of weight sufficient to prevent its repetition and the more it vexed the actors and actresses the greater  relish it would give the audience that I believe was too true  However I continued my objection but at last like a fool in the knowledge of mankind and the human heart a lucky bright thought as I judged  r▪ occurred to me and I said my good Mr Sheridan I have hit upon the very thing to establish myself as a favourite with you and the town He seemed all impatience to know what it could be My dear Sir a thought has just entered my pate which I think will draw money and be of infinite service to myself What is it What is it says Sheridan with the utmost eagernessWhy Sir says I your rank in the theatre and a gentleman so well known in Dublin on and off the stage must naturally occasion any striking imitation of yourself to have a wonderful effect I have paid great attention to your whole mode of acting not only since I have been in Dublin but two years before when you played the whole season at CoventGarden theatre and do actually think I can do a great deal on your stage with you  alone  without interfering with any other actor's manner whatever  Hogarth's pencil could not testify more astonishmenthe turned pale and red alternatelyhis lips quiveredI instantaneously perceived I was in the wrong box it was some time before he could  speakhe took a candle from off the table and shewing me the room doorwhen at last his words found utterancesaid he never was so insulted What to be taken off by a buffoon upon his own stage And as to mimicry what is it Why a proceeding which he never could countenance that he even despised Garrick and Foote for having introduced so mean an art and he then very politely desired me to walk down stairs This was truly on the second not the first floor it being more convenient for his communication with the theatre from that part of his dwelling house I was obliged to march and really felt petrified with my bright thought which had turned out so contrary from what I had ignorantly expected Mr Sheridan held the candle for me only till I got to the first landing and then hastily removed it grumbling and squeaking to himself and leaving me to feel my way in the dark down a pair and a half of steep stairs▪ and to guess my road in hopes of finding the street door  Mr Sheridan's voice was deep and as oppositely sharp and I should not have disliked then to have put in practice what I proposed had he given leave for I was really perfect and ready To a reader this may appear insipid but any person who can well recollect Mr Sheridan's manner  ould be entertained to hear me in the proper vein relate it as much depends on that for there is a great deal in being in spirits  After that fracas he neither permitted me to play or spoke to me during my stay in Ireland  ny own night excepted I fixed on Jane Shore and Tom Thumb for my play and farce on the night allotted me Saturday February    Mr Chaigneau himself waited on Mrs Fitzhenry to request her powerful assistance in Alicia to which request she kindly assented Hastings by Mr Wilkinson Shore by Mr DexterJane Shore by Miss Philips Alicia by Mrs Fitzhenry Queen Dollalolla by Mr Wilkinson H  neamunca by Miss G Philips  At the bottom of the bill tickets were to be had of Mr Wilkinson at  his house  in Big Strand Street for be it known that in three or four weeks after my recovering from my illness when in AbbeyStreet my good cheer round of friends and company occasioned me to keep very late  uts The  then  Bishop of Lantaff lodged during the winter on the floor under mine the  I made on coming home and the added rumbling when got into my own apartment with  d acting singing c made the Bishop's lodging very uncomfortable to him He sent for  the landlord and informed him my rehearsing in the day and the greater noise I made at night rendered him so uneasy that he was under the necessity of insisting on the young actor's instantly quitting the lodgings or he would for he really had tried his patience to the utmost and could no longer submit to it The landlord per force waited on his next door neighbours Mr and Mrs Chaigneau and informed them in full of this unfortunate alledgement of his Grace and humbly hoped they would not be offended at his not continuing Mr Wilkinson as a lodger as he could not permit it without sustaining the loss of his good and generous Bishop Mr and Mrs Chaigneau laughed very heartily at the complaint agreed in opinion with the landlord allowed that he and the Bishop were both right the latter having just cause for his stated objections At dinner at my good home where I actually was the king of the table Mrs Chaigneau with an assumed anger a humour peculiar to the Irish only  "My God Tate I am mighty angry with you and faith you do not mind meI can tell you  illy Chaigneau is angry with you tooUpon my conscience I do not think you care whether we are or not but come my dear Tate I will not make you uneasywe are both joking"  So after explaining the landlord's visit with an ex  aordinary  bottle for me and the good Mr William Chaigneau and passing a happy afternoon with them and three or four intimates I concurred  n thinking it right to settle about my disgraceful departure from my lodgings and neighbourhood when Mrs Chaigneau's bright thought far super or to mine with Mr Sheridan was first to save Tate's money and next not to inconvenience themselves She said  "If you will not discredit our house as you have the Bishop's we have one in Big Strand Street not let this winter and there is a man and a woman servant live in it  is decently furnished and it is kept well aired  ur own house which we live in you know is your eating house we look on you as our sonyou cannot want any thing but tea for breakfast  d such trifles This is Friday I will send immediately all necessaries such as sheets table linen c c and all shall be comfortable by tomor  night Quit your lodging and do not by any means fail in leaving a respectful card to the Bishop as I am certain you have been very troublesome to him or he would not have alledged such complaints against you for he declares he is not angry but you are a plague to him"  These orders I obeyedcalled at MY HOUSE the sound of which pleased me much on Saturday noon and was highly delighted and told the  servant pompously I should not be at home till late as I was engaged to dinner and for the evening at Mr George Hamilton's in Henry Street with a large party We dined at five observe reader that the custom of dining in Dublin was and  is  much later than in London very few if any person or persons in established trade there ever dine till three o'clock but in general at four I kept my appointment at Mr Hamilton's and a happy day and evening I had I got home about three o'clock in the morning proud and satisfied was I when conveyed in a chair to my new mansion where all seemed to be conducted with the utmost care and made comfortable for my reception  A merry day and plenty of good things had prepared me for sleep The diningroom was spacious the bedchamber large the bed excellent and I laid myself down expecting a delicious repose to repair the fatigues of luxury To relate what follows may seem superfluous I need not add with a mind at ease I soon had the blessing of a sound sleep which to prince or peasant is most delicious  "Well" says techy Impatience "sleep and be dd What's that to me"  Why my waspish friend if you in any one point smatter of  antipathy  here bestow your pity on me I ask it as a charitable boon to my sufferings tho'  it is possible you may laugh at me and I beg you will make some little allowance for what you do not feel but if you do smatter of the like sensation I am certain of your bounty I can be astonished how any man woman or child can faint at seeing a cat because a cat I am partial to and like as a companion another will faint at the smell of cheese a lady will shudder at a leg of mutton not being cut to please her and a thousand instances might be given of the weakness of human nature in such trifling matters Yet they are in truth terrible to the persons who labour under the like unhappy prejudices and too often laughed at by the observers which is cruelty in the extreme for how can I reconcile to myself in conscience the being pleased with the terrors of  ther on seeing a cat where I feel no uneasiness but on the contrary pleasure And yet I should be very angry indeed at any one's laughing at my horror if a rat was near me Yet so composed are we all at what does not affect ourselves that it is  lamentable truth to say and we must all be sensible that these things are unavoidably so  That these unfortunate prejudices should be  en  ed in their progress is an indispensable duty and lesson which it is true ought to be inculcated for our own sakes and the repose of others That antipathies are dreadful I think I can warrant  prove and explain For a sword or pistol at my breast I do not think would prove so great an alarm to me as a rat would in my pocket or bed▪ my distress on such an accidental misfortune would be attended not only with agonizing sensations▪ but I verily believe immediate danger  To prove that fear is the result of nature I will observe that by my living on the banks o  the Thames in London for many years rats were as familiar as kittens to my sight nay more so for where I saw one cat I must have seen twenty rats at low water about the logs of wood lighters c On a fine day they swarmed and towards evening it was their grand rendezvous My mother had the same prejudice I have heard her mention repeatedly that when she was near her time with me one day when dressed to dine out with company being near the top of the stairs a rat passed suddenly between her legs which alarm caused her immediately to fall from the top to the bottom and instead of visiting was put to bed extremely ill and judged to b  in imminent danger Whether that might b  the original cause to ground these fears in me I cannot decide but am certain I am so  To return to my house in BigStrandStreet where I left myself fast asleep and thank God▪ that sleep continued till within an hour of daylight  but that hour seemed to me the longest and most painful I had ever experienced the fever and blisters on my ancles not forgot indeed we generally feel our present woes as the worst I was waked by a lump falling on my breast My first conjecture was that a thief was in the room and had placed his hand there I then thought by no more moving it might be a cat which ref  ection was of great comfort and consolation and next like Richard the Third concluded it was but a dream and possessed heroism sufficient to start myself up in the bed and like our stage Harry the Eighth to cry out  Hough hough  which act of valour was no sooner performed than I was immediately saluted with the squeaking of vermin and their running up and down the curtains and over the  d and under the bed I distilled almost to  ly with my fears lay covered over head and ears not daring to call for assistance or feel for t  e string of the bell or even to move a limbThe rats I am convinced must have made that  oom their constant nightly residence not having been used I suppose for above twelve months On my suddenly calling out and striking the bed those devils by such an unexpected alarm of danger must have been almost as much terrified for their preservation as I was for mine For had they as I have been told they will made an attack  they would soon have conquered me their petrified foe What resistance immediate danger might have enabled me to perform I know not but as I feel at this moment on the relation I am certain the bribe must be enormous that could prevail on me to touch a living rat  When daylight had befriended me and the gentry had retired to thei  secret apartments I found the bell and couragiously rung and called for the servants At last a lazy dirty figure made his appearance to whom I related my woeful tale but did not find it made any impression or called forth the falling tear of pity for all my nightly sufferings and when the dingy Wowski his wife made her  entree  and had heard the particulars from her darling Trudge they both laughed and thought it a very good joke the dusky lady only uttered  "O faith I wish I had been with these varmant cratures by my shoul I would have made sport for them by cutting them pace male"  However though it was Sunday I got the upholsterer where I had lodged in Abbeystreet to oblige me with a man to take the bed down and search even the ticken to see if any rats had taken refuge where a flea might have security or lodging I had all the apparatus moved into the diningroom and a large cat from Mrs Chaigneau's was sent to be as a guard  All holes and crannies whatever were stopped and as a proof of my politeness to the  nhabitants I never even at noonday entered that fatal chamber without a previous knocking  This childish story will be condemned by all  xcept such as unfortunately are liable to such un  onquerable aversionsnor would I here have  nserted it but from one motiveto engage as  r as possible some pity and allowance from those who are so happy as not to be liable to such di  agreeable sensations however trifling they may  thought for if a dungeon was my lot my first idea would be the ratholes  Some men there are love not a gaping pig  me who are mad when they behold a cat  Masterless passions sway us to the mood  Of what we like or lothe  I have frequently heard of a pet cat but never yet of a pet ratI once conquered prejudice so  ar as to have familiarized mysel  to a pet squirrel which certainl  bears some resemblance though it is paying the frolicksome squirrel a shabby comp  ment A pet m  use has at times been happ  cherished in a lady's pocket but never so particul  rly described or authenticated for its  r  en  ly and uncommon attachments as by the  renowned General Baron Trenck in his late Prussian Romance printed within these three years and universally readSo now farewell to rats and mice and such  small deer  and I hope for ever Antipathies are as unconquerable as unanswerable John Bull loves beef and pudding the Frenchman soup the Dutchman butter the Scotchman haggess the Irishman potatoes the Welchman leeks and kid the Italian macaroni and a  urk what we find poison laudanumIt would unavoidably occasion inconceivable trouble to invite a guest of every tribe and nation to one table and possibly contrive the means to provide a  avourite dish for every separate visitant's palate for there are as particular and fixed aversions to our eatables as to different speci  sI like cheese yet the friend at  y elbow perhaps strong in constitution and naturally robust and spirited might faint at its being produced on the t  ble I can a  er that cream sauce to a turkey with all my precaution and determination to a certainty sp  i  s my dinnerIt is a feast that takes away my stomach  As I was lately speaking of my Strandstreet s  tuation▪ I will proceed with giving information that the approaching th of  ebruar  seemed to pro  ise being most prosperous fro  the ex  rtions of Mr Chaigneau Lord Forbes and my long list of more than common friends my boxes  were rapidly taken and for want of places in that circle no less than seven rows of the pit were added and railed in at box prices which are the  ame as in London indeed more as every shilling goes in Ireland as thirteen pence Mr Chaigneau paid me forty guineas for tickets the  hole receipt of the house not then so large as it w  s made by Mossop after that time was l  d an overflow from every part of the theatre Gold tickets to a considerable amount not only f  om my friends and some persons of distinction but particularly from the gentlemen of the army over whom Mr Chaigneau's situation as principal agent gave him great sway and he paid personal  sits eve  y where for the purpose of serving me  Jane Shore has been already stated as the play on this memorable night but I have omitted the mentioning my own performance at that period Lord Hastings I believe was not much graced or honoured by my assuming his chamberlainship together with his star and garter which did not receive from me any additional lustre that could be possibly handed down to his successors with honour However I cannot blame my manager for not being well dressed the wardrobe it is true was not equal to equip a number of persons of fashion fit to appear at court on a royal birthday But with the manager's consent and Mr  Dexter's approbation I wore Mr Dexter's grand suit for particular occasions which was a new blue satin richly trimmed with silver looked very elegant and what was better fitted me exactly  Mr Dexter was the gentleman who appeared at DruryLane in in Oroonoko with more than common expectation of great success and was in noted as a leading actor in the heroes and fine gentlemen on SmockAlley stage I must say in justice to myself that I was perfect to the line if not to the letter consequently the play went smoothly on and I obtained applause of course from so numerous a set of friends Mrs Fitzhenry in Alicia gave as was usual great satisfaction as I did to an extravagant degree when magnificently arrayed for Queen Dollalolla in Tom Thumb which obtained a continued roar as I played it as Woffington and I certainly may be allowed to say the steadiness and earnestness of the imitation was at least equal to any modern professor's attempt  The rapid step from my late illness extreme poverty and friendless situation had taken such a turn that with my coach tableacquaintance presents and great benefit I thought my fortune made and early in March with true felt gratitude not from  that day week or month but never effaced to the present moment now including above thirtytwo years I took leave of my good friends in possession of two valuable gifts health and wealthIndeed to the wonderful care of these good and undescribable persons can I only attribute my existence and also my wealth as from that time till encumbered with the cares of my present unpromising and perplexed state I never knew in the course of several years the want of cash which state of happiness my after frequent visits to Dub  n made me as a young man in a kind of independence  Early in life I envied theatrical monarchy and like most things when obtained I soon experienced like the wisest man  "That all was and is vanity and vexation of spirit"  and as Gay says  Life's but a jest and all things shew it  I thought so once but now I know it  With now l in that pocket which a very few months before contained only two guineas and which I  then  termed a treasurebut good God what a changelike a ten thousand pound prize to a cobbler the contrast nearly the same  only with this difference the cobbler might have been in health and happy but I had been ill very ill and a povertystruck youthI sailed from Ireland with a fair wind attended by the waft of numberless good wishes for my safe arrival in Old England  At Chester I met young Mr Bagnal a gentleman of family in Ireland and as I was become a man of fortune we travelled post like gentlemen and arrived safe in the metropolis I felt my  elf in step air and mind a very different per  on from what I was when I left London  Soon after my arrival I took leave of Mr Bagnal and presented myself with as much duty as pleasure to my dear mother as every son should and ought to do and am certain the return was overpaid by her Her joy surprise and a thousand  etceteras  which may be supposed and only affectionate and good mothers can feel such heavenly sensations I do not speak from supposition but can aver that though there  was is  and  ever will be  good parents yet mine was really sprung from the tree called the  Nonpareil  and I can with truth boast I possessed one truly praiseworthy quality and that was being one of the best sons not from any merit as a duty from myself due to my mother but because I loved and revered her worth and conversed with my  true  friend  And what might be termed coldly that of duty did not create the groundwork only of my esteem for all I did sprung solely from selflove as making her happy was my inclination pleasure and delight nor do I mean by these protestations to convey merit in any extraordinary degree to myself for had she not been a sensible and an endearing mother I doubt whether my good behaviour had been conspicuous beyond mediocrity The giving to her an account of my riches and my friends in Ireland was a feast and my producing the l bill was a dazzling sight indeed though only in black and white letters  Soon after my arrival I paid a visit to Mr Garrick who wished me joy though not in a joyful manner I gave him an account of my benefit c and thanked him for his leave of absence The second Saturday after my being in London as I had staid in Ireland by permission only I went to the treasurer's office for my weekly stipend of thirty shillings as stipulated in my article but which at that time would only have been twenty shillings as the season of Lent was not expired  On my asking for my salary Mr Pritchard first treasurer and Mr Wood subtreasurer informed me that as they had not received any orders from Mr Garrick or Mr Lacey they dared  not pay me and I could not as they apprehended have any right to it but would inquire what they were to do when they saw either of the managers I argued my right of payment was undoubtable by my article but of course was obliged to depart as I came neither richer nor poorer  A few days after I met Mr Garrick in Bridgestreet who on seeing me instantly with upbraiding and severe terms accosted me for my being so audacious as he termed it to call at his office for money He added in a supercilious manner that I had met with a little accidental success in Ireland a circumstance that never could happen again and he had from motives of  charity  obtained me a retreat to secure me from want of bread and I repaid his kindness with impudent assurance and ingratitude This sudden attack really alarmed me as I had still formed great hopes for my future success on Mr Garrick's power and friendship from what he had so often professed though not yet put into practice In my defence I urged with the aid of truth that I had only been absent upon furlow and by his permission had only continued on the same granted authority not having presumed to stay in Dublin though a severe and dangerous illness had intervened but under the sanction of that grant and having an article for that and the following  year I esteemed myself much obliged to him But  inwardly  presuming on my right of article I could not in word manner or obedience in duty to myself give up a point I had so far engaged in with that great monarch but persisted that on my return to London and his theatre I was every way entitled to my salary  He austerely answered had I returned as he exexpected I should in great distress his own goodness and feelings would have allowed me the salary but as I asserted a falsehood and was not in want my insolence deserved punishment for there was not any such agreement subsisting between us I all security and full of open conviction against him in the face of day not only asserted my right but hastily produced my bond which was worded thus on the back  "Articles of agreement between David Garrick and James Lacey Esquires and Tate Wilkinson Gentleman for two years from October "  Here I concluded myself quite sure and of course felt as elate as any plaintiff on the gaining a verdict in his favour When after a look of disdain and a sneer of ineffable contempt Mr Garrick said  "Thou foolish pert boy go home to thy  Mamma  she can read though you cannot  ook carefully over the contents of your article and you will there find that on the inside it does  not commence till September "  I of course had no occasion to ejaculate  "O upright Judge"  but hung down my head and sneaked home to my mother when to both our astonishments it was really and truly as Mr Garrick had said This shews how careful people should be to read every thing before they sign and never to trust the seeming generosity and good nature of others The contents of the inside of this great and mighty article did not take place till the September following How he could think it worth his notice to treat so insignificant an object as he termed me some months before in so mean so artful and so ungentlemanlike a manner I from that time to this could never devise unless through fear of my talents as an imitator he held me in a contemptuous light yet still ever watchful and careful in regard to himself he might perhaps think me worth retaining for a trifling salary as an exotic for his hothouse for he always used to term me his exotic therefore he chose to  ock me up like a wild beast to prevent my distracting his repose or his consequence Thus without salary was I obliged to remain and have recourse to my philosophy and sit down contented but being a man of fortune as I  then  thought myself I went on a visit to a new spot the fashionable city of Bath to drink the waters having had an  invitation from my friend Mr Hull My intimacy with that gentleman and Miss Morrison now Mrs Hull was fixed from our first acquaintance the summer before at Maidstone from that time to the present I have ever been favoured with their study to oblige and serve me which I have never yet had it in my power to return according to my wishes This acknowledgment I offer as a debt of honour and though not substantial my gratitude and good opinion could not let slip this opportunity of paying a tributary compliment to the merit of those particular and worthy friends  My first appearance at Bath was on Monday the th of May for Miss Morrison's benefit Othello Mr Wilkinson from the theatreroyal Dublin also Mr Wilkinson will treat Mr  Foote  with a Dish of his own Tea I was kindly received Mr Quin was at the play the imitations were well received but from my not being known on the stage and not having had the sanction of a London audience the applause was very different from what I had been honoured with in Dublin and what I afterwards gained  at Bath  when I had become more used to the stage by a variety of playing and the praises and applause of London had wreathed my brow with that all powerful phrase termed  the fashion  so prevalent  is that word that even the Siddons and the Jordan bow to its shrine But a fickle jade is Fashion and the first actress that thinks she is secure will at times find Mrs Fashion a shallow and inconstant friend  I gave Tea for Mr Hull on Wednesday the th of May and acted Essex for the first time with Cadwallader in the farce of the Author for Miss Ibbott In the interim the families of the Townsends and the Hanways in London were all wellwishers for my mother's and my welfare and were ever devising ways and means to advance and establish my future success their tables when I was in London were my constant welcome places of resort While I was figuring away at Bath for my own diversion from May without any engagement till September following at DruryLane they were deliberating for my real prosperity much more than I could myself The Townsends had at that very juncture Major Strode and his lady from Portsmouth at their house on a visit Major Strode was the first in command at the Portsmouth garrison at the same time there were a Mrs Arnold and Miss Arnolds her daughters from Portsmouth also on a visit in London they were distant relations to the Hanways My mother who was a frequent and a welcome visitor and indeed a desirable guest being at dinner at the  Townsends on a grand gala day and where the above ladies and gentlemen were present the good old lady Mrs Townsend with her genuine marks of benevolence and kindness desired a glass round to the health of her young friend and pupil for prayers Tate Wilkinson which was of course immediately assented to and complied with according to her wish This gave my truly good mother an opportunity to inform the worthy circle that after all the afflictions and misfortunes that had unremittingly pursued her through life she was she thanked the great Being blessed with a son who made it his study to support her and to bestow every assistance in his power to render her latter days comfortable and easy They all agreed that being so good a son as my mother had described I deserved every praise and every encouragementMr Jonas Hanway confirmed what my mother had related and they all joined in wishes for my success and a continuance of regard and duty being paid to her allowed worth After a short silence Mrs Strode broke out in the following exclamation  "Good God Mr Hanway a thought strikes me swift as lightning whereby we can with pleasure and ease to ourselves be of infinite service to Tate"  My mother of course bowed and gave eager attention as did e  ery one at the hospitable table Mrs Strode  proceeded with observing it was then a time of war between France and England May and we have at Portsmouth added she a glorious fleet for the honour of Old England and the terror of France in consequence of which ou  little garrison town is full of soldiers and sailors and all with plenty of money in their pockets which they cannot bear the thoughts of keeping thereas sailors in particular are never careful for the morrowwe have every year at Portsmouth a company of players who travel also to Plymouth and Exeter A Mr Kennedy an elderly man is the manager of the company and he always makes Portsmouth his summer place of residence the Major herself and family should return there in a few days and when arrived at home would send for the manager and then make a point of her friend and old acquaintance Mrs Wilkinson's son being engaged for the summer season she also added her house should be my ordinary and from her intimacy with Mrs Wilkinson and her friend Mrs Townsend she would introduce Tate to all her acquaintance and f  attered herself she could answer that his jaunt to Portsmouth by her contrivance and management should be profitable and pleasant with every reason for his satisfaction and none to occasion regret The party assembled added every assurance of patronage  and support to the theatre and had no apprehensions that my friends and merit could do so well as in Dublin but they should prove a sample at Portsmouth in a comparative view likewise to b  ast of This was no sooner said than done by Mrs Strode  All these wonderful and agreeable particulars it may be supposed were by the next post transmitted to me at Bath with all the joy and heartfelt satisfaction and partiality of a fond mother I returned on the wing to her in London and got equipped with what I thought necessary for a  ung gentleman not omitting a laced suit of  thes which in those days were all the fashion and a rich gold laced Kevenhuller hat and waited with impatience for my return of the Portsmouth l  ttery ticket which proved no blank but a prize for Mrs Strode and the Arnolds finished the business they had undertaken not like that of the law's delay for on their arrival at home it was no sooner mentioned than accomplished as when the theatrical troop arrived the manager was summoned to attend them and he was commanded  n  t  intreated under peril of their authority and the severe law in force to comply with Mrs Strode's mandate for that company of players did not want or approve of interlopers either to act the characters they possessed or to give any  encouragement to strangers fearing if they did grant permission they might lead the inclination or the town into temptation and create an appetite for the London actors during their vacation for many London performers at such a critical time would not have disliked such a pleasant trip it being only seventytwo miles from the great city for health and profitand they would have been refreshed with delightful sea breezes and the Londoners once admitted would have diminished the fame as well as the profit of the Devonshire and and Hampshire candidates of the sock and buskin who basked in the sunshine of wealth at Plymouth and Portsmouth during  the glorious war  so called by the poor players like Mr Cumberland's Jew who says  "The plague is a blessed circumstance"  and both for the same motiveselfinterest It was agreed I was to have a share as there was no distinction of emolument from Romeo to the Apothecary all received an equal portion likewise a clear benefit whenever I chose to appoint and was to act from Friday the th of June until August the th as often as called upon by the manager My being represented to him as a gentleman whom a large party of people of fashion were determined to support and not being sufficiently established as a performer to cause any grounds for jealousy in point of fame prevented  any opposition from the company to hinder the manager's compliance with the offer proposed for the noviciate therefore as it conveyed an idea of aiding their interests and a refusal would have occasioned much displeasure the preliminaries were agreed to and Mrs Strode wrote to Mr Jonas Hanway an account of her success and summoned me immediately to Portsmouth I received a letter of invitation couched in genteel terms from the manager and on this expected and wishedfor intelligence I set off with eager curiosity for the new scene of pleasure and what rendered it more enchanting to my youthful mind was a corrobroation of such happy events sudden  springing up and snatching me from the brink of hopeless poverty and despair and all within the  pace of seven months and as in a dream or enchantment was known and engaged in not only a polite circle of acquaintance but welcomed and  eceived with such flattering aspect from every benign and friendly countenance that a stranger to have entered the room would really have supposed I had been a person of consequence in an enviable  rcle Happy happy minds that shed such sun  hine and genial rays on the sons and daughters of affliction And as happy are those young ladies and gentlemen who are favoured with such rays from superiors as to make them observant of not  only manners but of what is really good Youth of both sexes when treated so kindly are too apt to attribute it as a compliment to their own self superiority instead of truly feeling where the gratitude is justly due Indeed I have seen so much of supercilious behaviour on granting a favour and so many instances of affectation and selfsufficiency on receiving that I truly think and believe it would have been a difficult matter for one possessed of real genius to distinguish on which side lay the greatest absurdity  I arrived safe at the garrison but not without inquiries at each gate and drawbridge for my name and what was my business as the road from Hillsey Barracks to Portsmouth is a continued chain of drawbridges c I had not been housed three hours in this well guarded town when a Capt Chambers brother to Sir Charles Chambers an old friend and intimate of my father's and well acquainted with Captain James Jones formerly mentioned of the FootGuards and a Captain Scott of Chester with three or four other officers came not only to welcome me but Capt Chambers as my late father's friend in the name of all his brother officers gave me an invitation to constantly dine and sup with them at their mess I of course accepted of it and made a decent acknowledgment for the favour  conferred but my heart felt much more man my tongue could express In short from the introduction of the Strodes the Arnolds and the officers my father having been universally known and I may add beloved by the gentlemen of the army I had such a general acquaintance that there actually were few houses in Portsmouth but where I was received on the same footing as when in Dublin and from my universal intimacy the streets seemed to become a part of my own fancied property  On Friday June the th I appeared in Othello which part I had founded as Mr  Hitchcock  observes in his history of the Irish Stage on the manner c I had observed and caught from Mr Barry and also gave  Tea  The theatre was crowded to a degree and had my performance been bad instead of tolerable it would have been attended with applause the Tea of course was received with much approbation but I was fond of undertaking too much at one time either to serve my reputation as an actor or to the preservation of my health as a man for my constitution was never one of the strongest being racked at times from my youth to this day with a dreadful bilious complaint and an irregular life has encouraged that enemy every week to convince me of its pitiless power which  pushes my feeble steps downward before my time from the pinnacle of fifty I must remark that as my reception was secure from my friends being present I should have consulted my own ease and have had patience to have studied better for my  own  advantage by giving more satisfaction to the audience and less trouble to myself but young performers have an idea of striking the observers with their various powers which is a wrong and dangerous experiment For instance it would have been more prudent for me to have acted  Othello  only as a test of my abilities and reserved my  Tea  to another night for the refreshment of my acquaintance  When I look over and recollect some of the nightswork I have gone through on the stage to my infinite fatigue it is wonderful I am existing to relate the particulars the study the labour and the bad hours I have ever kept considered Indeed at this instant I feel my stomach painful which makes the observation occur that perhaps could I provide a better leg in exchange for my broken one I should not be surprised if in high spirits the following week I was to laugh at my own reflections and gravity So true is Lord Chesterfield's remarks on our courage and our fears with every other sensation according to our habit of health custom and exercise From the same  ought I imagine arises the saying ascribed by our soldiers of the Americans  "They did not  l bold on such a day"  However from my  rst stage success I certainly was bit by a theatrical tarantula for my appetite for acting was insa  ble Illness unless verv severe never was a restraint for if able to crawl out of bed I have  ten gone to the theatre much disordered and if m  performance has been received with applause  ave returned home recovered and perfe  tly well On the contrary I do not know a more mortifying or disagreeable situation than to act to a poor  indisposed in health and to be only in  fferently received yet these unpleasing circum  tances have happened to every performer from the  i  hest to lowest at particular timesit is the una  idable lot of human li  e in all its stages If an a  t  r or actress be really  l those who are well  uld lend every assistance in their power on such a  emergency to serve the royal till and pre  erve the audience in temper Not any thing sours a con  regated assemblage of persons so much as frec  e  t apologies nay the manager is often blamed  m the pettishness of the audience because the  erf  rmer is sick and I am sorry to say▪ I be  ieve  on such sudden disappointments is of  ref  ed not so much from ill nature in the disp  sit  n of the actor or actre  s as fear in the  player of not being well received by the persons assembled together and besides yielding to a false pride and fancied selfimportance in the one so fixed on to supply the place of the sick performer which indeed might often be prevented if the audience would good naturedly support the actor or actress who in such a predicament undertakes the part however inferior his or her situation may be in a theatre and they may by such kind assistance draw forth sparks of future greatness which may have been obscured by not having had an opportunity of displaying them and of receiving the sanction of the public  But let me crablike get back to Portsmouth from which place I had not any right to have strayed But I fancy myself in these remarks and incidents as if I was speaking to some particular friend and if I cannot obtain great lenity pray in compassion to yourself good reader as well as to me close and drop the book for I neither possess wit or talents nor profess any such gifts as to furnish me with hopes of entertaining any one as a writer indeed I never had an idea or attempted any thing of the kind So I stand like Hope wishing patience to be granted to every reader sprinkled with a few grains of good humour If any one ask Why I now take this liberty I will honestly and frankly own that confinement  occasioned by a broken limb has made the year very  tedious wearisome  and heavy therefore I sit and recall past joys and misfortunes to mv mind and as I know they are various I think they may please both friends and enemies for any hour that may hang heavy on their hands and though time is allowed as precious yet the wise people sometimes throw an hour away not to be bought back again at any price Next I value myself on the authenticity of what I relate and p  edge my truth and honour for the whole being a recitation of strict matters of fact only Mrs Bellamy averred the same but she took such pains to be untrue in her accounts that it could not be the effect of a bad memory as she hints but on the contrary labour and study to dress things so widely different from what they really were I would have set her right then and she mentions it in her sixth volume but she there acknowledges she is a bad chronologist  From what I have mentioned of my Portsmouth visit it may be easily conjectured I was naturally not a little vain of my pleasant situation I played an extensive list of characters and it would seem incredible if not accounted for by my long regu  ar study and practice as a lad when mockmana  r Some I acted with merit and can truly say  all  with applause such is the happiness of  being secure of the good will of superiors and obtaining a general kind opinion Nay am certain at that time my youth and inexperience gained me such a partia  ity from the families I was intimately acquainted with that they really fancied as I was a favourite among them that I was clever where indeed I was not and when glaringly wrong or imperfect would readily frame an excuse for me even against my own conviction of error  List of characters at Portsmouth acted by Mr Wilkinson from June till August  Othello  twice  * Romeo  twice  * Hotspur  * Lord Townly  * Richard III  times  * Castalio  * Osmyn in the Mourning Bride  * Horatio  Hastings  Essex  *  Lear  four times  * Hamlet  twice  Orestes  twice  FARCES  Cadwallader  six times  * Ld Chalkstone  twice  * Petruchio  Tea  ten times  NB Those marked with a * I had not acted before but it proves my industry to make myself well used to the stage  During my residence here I wished for a nearer view of the Isle of Wight for it had a  tempting and beautiful effect from Portsmouth ramparts The Bath company were there at that time with them I had nearly engaged myself on the late trip to Bath had not Mrs Strode's lucky thought intervened and put a stop to the business and a fortunate preventative it wa  That and another escape of the same kind some years after makes it always recur to my mind as the peculiar care of Providence Indeed the Portsmouth engagement was a lucky golden drop of Madam Fortune's in every respect  The Bath comedians were induced to the Isle of Wight by the self same bait that at one time or the other seduces all mankind that is the love of lucre and which great ministers as well as great players ever have in view The Bath company hearing from the clatter and the din of arms throughout the kingdom that an encampment of consequence was to be established for the summer and the ladies of that theatre short legged and thick legged having a prediliction in favour of the knapsack all voted to pack up their tatters and follow the drum to the Isle of Wight Nor are theatrical ladies singular in that particular indeed there needs no ghost to inform the world that females of all degrees to use a common expression  set their caps at a red coat  Their theatrical Bath majesties therefore ordered  a baggage waggon well loaded with armour foils truncheons spears daggers and all the implements of war were carefully packed up in case of danger to repel the French in their flatbottomed boats as well as to prove to the regiments how ably the female warriors were prepared to face the enemy The waggon was intrusted not only with all the theatrical wardrobe but with all their own private geer and that seriously speaking was a property of real value consisting of linen clothes jewels regalia c to represent kings and queens of France and England Spain Portugal c also emperours and empresses that never were or ever will be all these treasures and necessaries were safely stowed not forgetting the bones appertaining to Hamlet Calista c Their all was intrusted to the protection of a rude boorish Wiltshire waggoner thunder and lightning not omitted but left to the care of the stagekeeper who undertook and said  "He was perfectly competent from constant practice to conduct and guide such troublesome and dangerous elements"  Thunder and lightning attended by a wonderful eclipse seldom pleases even on the stage except in the Duke of Buckingham's Rehearsal where it always raises a laugh instead of a storm But lo the  whole  was destroyed by f  re the first night of the waggon's journey on Salisbury plain this is  not more strange than true Mr Keasberry now manager of the Bath theatre can testify the fact It was not occasioned by the elements above nor yet by the stage thunder and lightning but by the waggoner's inattention and not endeavouring to save any part of the goods when the machine had taken fire and consequently as no water or any assistance was to be had all the property to a considerable amount was consumed  The distressed and harrassed troops mustered at Newport where Queen  Ibbot  verified her favourite Shakspeare's words  " A clout upon that head  " Where late a diadem stood"  They prepared as well as they possibly could to open their small theatre in the little town of Newport for then the players argument was too mournful to admit much talk  There were four or five regiments if not more encamped there the gentlemen of the army are in general theatrical and generous and these qualities never were more necessary than after that un  ortunate fire The gentlemen expressed an universal desire to make a compensation for their distress and indeed it might be reckoned incumbent on them so to have promised and acted as due to a debt of honour to make good their losses  which happened in consequence of their desire to give these gentlemen enterta  nment who were so cooped up from their usual round of diversions and certainly so established a company as those of the Bath theatre to undertake so hazardous and so long a journey had a right to expect support and respect I went to pay my devoirs to them by taking a boat with only one man to row me across the arm of the sea which seperates Hampshire from that charming romantic spot the Isle of Wight The afternoon was fine and serene I stayed with them two days and was highly satisfied with its rural beauties but on my return the sea ran very high and the wind blew a hurricane which alarmed me so much that I was really rejoiced when I got into  ortsmouth and was greatly surprised when several gentlemen of the navy told me it was a very dangerous expedition and what not  ne of them would have attempted except on necessity and duty but not on any means by way of a frolick  "As one woe treads upon another's heels"  as Shakspeare observes so did another misfortune happen to my good friends Mr Keasberry and Mr Griffith for they had scarcely got their necessary repairs after the dreadful conflagration when as Mrs Inchbald's epilogue expresses  "Down came an order to suspend the ball"  or in plain English  they had been there but a very short time when orders came for the whole camp to break up and march for Cowes and immediately embark on bo  rd the shipping prepared for them at St Helens and sail on a secret expedition against the French and as the town of Newport could not without the assistance of the army provide  or or by any means support the Bath company so the players packed up their little  all  and sailed for  outhampton and from thence repaired to Reading in Berkshire where they continued till the season for the u  ual opening of the  ath theatre  My benefit at Portsmouth was  n Monday the th of July the  rovoked Husband with Tea and the part of Cadwallader not  ing under full pri  e and by desire the gallery and pit all made one price A great house was of course expected Indeed that season I do not remember there was a bad one tnerefore no need of the traveller's talent to make it a wonder that mine was a great one  But will not the reader stare at such a piece of uncommon luck to happen and to come on a sudden burst for the command of the army was conducted so well and so secretly that we had not a notion or even a whisper of the kind of any such expectations on the Wednesday  but on the Friday and Saturday the town was crowded with officers cThis occasioned a great house on the Saturday July not an usual night of playing and on Sunday his Royal Highness the Duke of York arrived and honoured me with his company at the play on the Monday where he favoured me with much notice and as the saying is the  whole world  was there all at Wilkinson's benefit Whoever remembers that expedition planned against Cherbourgh will know this account tallies to the day and the hour The theatre and stage were so crowded that it was difficult to perform Part of the regiment of his Majesty's guards with naval officers and those of several regiments and strangers innumerable with the marines c all combined could easily have filled a London theatre  The magnificent and powerful fleet added to every other brilliancy made the whole a glorious sight not that any ship pleased me more however gaudily dressed at Spithead than our theatrical frigate so nobly adorned on my benefit night and to mark my singular good luck in three days they were all embarked the wind was fair and away they sailed for the glory of Old England  My  Tea  the night of my benefit was of great  service not only there but was remembered and related as a matter of merit in the  little village  called London  Colonel Caesar of the guards Mrs Woffington's defender and protector was at the play and saw and felt the force of my imitation of that lady  I was introduced to several gentlemen with whom afterwards I was very intimateIt was at that time my acquaintance first commenced with the late General St Leger which continued till the year of his death he honoured me with being my particularly attached and intimate friend as all my Yorkshire acquaintance can testify The last dinner he had at his own house at ParkHill I was with him by particular invitation as also Capt Smelt who accompanied him to Dublin where death snatched away my friend and patron With the truly accomplished nephew of General St Leger an intimacy I cannot boast but can exultingly mention the honour of many favours and acts of kindnessnot paid to my own deserts but by a compliment which originated from his certain knowledge that his uncle the late General St Leger was not only my patron but honoured me with his friendshipOne of the blessings I long for during my short remainder of life is that I may see that gentleman situated in rank  and affluence equal to the Prince's friend and his own most sanguine expectations accompanied with many years to enjoy that prosperity with health spirits and increasing happiness let my situation be what it will I shall always rejoice at never  ading la  rels circling the brows of Colonel St Leger  Colonel Thornton of the Yorkshire Blues was also on the Cherbourg expedition and wit  whom I could boast the honour of continued friendship in London till I lost him as I did my General for death sweeps all Colonel Thornton was one of the most lively tavern friends I ever knew  After the combined circumstances of luck at Portsmouth I returned with a full pocket all elated to London not having in the least a contemptible opinion of my own abilities Success makes people vain and in truth without a touch of vanity  "little worthy would be re  olved or done"  Without a spice of this said vanity performers would not have courage to sustain the shock and proceedFor at the  best  the stage has its bitters mingled with its sweets which cannot be known till tasted and experienced for surely no other profession can be so fi  kle and precarious Indeed I know of no comparison compatible but a  similitude to the most splendid situation in this world which is the court For notwithstanding the jump of difference and the seeming impertinence of the assertion it is certain that the  ins  and  outs  of courts with many  etceteras  leave no doubt of the resemblance being striking strong and apposite  My time in London till the house opened in September being only three weeks was very pleasant and I was  hiefly employed in relating my Portsmouth adventures with a description of guns and drums and the wonders I had seen performed by the army and navy I had all the great names as familiar in my mouth as household words When by reflection my conceit was a little cooled I waited on my master Garrick once more in a frock trimmed with goldlace which made him dart his eyes through my weak brain My first words after my salutation were  "Sir what am I to make my first appearance in and when"  for now I was not so timid and afraid of this lord of lords and ruler of princes as I was the year before when I acted as his groom and rode his hobbyhorse He was on this easy question so full of hums and has and hey why now y s they now really I thinkthat finding nothing could come from nothing I very soon obliged him by retiring as I was certain he wished  my absence and having pleased my youthful vanity by not having presented myself before him in such poverty▪struck habilaments as I formerly had done I may be allowed at that time to pronounce my conduct excuseable as it was boyish for I was not nineteen till the th of November followingIndeed he told me that day as he often had done that he hated exotics and  I  was oneBut in a few days he sent me Prince Volscius in the Rehearsal which I relished very well as I thought the run of the verse and the situation would fit in a striking manner for me to exhibit a likeness of Barry and that I could make it have a sudden and entertaining effect on the audience but Garrick certainly was in hopes I would return it as not thinking it of consequence and afford him an opportunity for anger which would have kept me at a distance and prevented my daring to be troublesome  On the morning the play of the Rehearsal was called I was convinced the above conjecture of mine was right  "Why hey now Wilkinson" says Garrick"Hey now what heyaI think now that youWhy Crossnow now here you you have sent this part now to this lad I must not trust him with this▪ Volscius you know I must have some steady person to depend onPacker now hey Packerfor if  Wilkinson does it he will be at some of his dd tricks and be taking off or some dd thing or anotherDo Cross take the part back from Wilkinson and I will think of something else for him"  Volscius was of course taken from me and I retired amidst the sneers and laughter of his Majesty's company of comedians with Garrick saying to them all  "Did you ever now see such a dd exotic he would have destroyed my whole play of the Rehearsal and be dd to him"  Here my greatness received a stab tho' not deservedly as it must be granted my ambition had not been insolent when contented with Prince Volscius for a first appearance as Mr  Somebody  on a London stage and what a falling off was it to have such contempt thrown upon the Portsmouth RosciusIndeed I was not ordered to wait in plays as in the preceding season but was quite unemployed yet I received my weekly stipend of thirty shillings regularly  Early in October I met Lord Robert Manners who was crossing Jamesstreet Covent Garden and whom I had forgot to mention as one of our party at ParkGate and Holyhead on my journey the year before to Ireland In Dublin he was very kind to me and whenever we met in the park or in the street he always stopped or walked with me for eight or ten minutes chat  When I solicited Lord Harcourt some few years ago to intercede with his Majesty for a renewal of my York and Hull patents I was highly favoured by my fellow traveller Lord Robert Manners for the permission he gave me of his name to Lord Harcourt He saw me twice in his  ittingroom below stairs in Grosvenorsquare he declared he could chat but he could not write he was a picture of reverence and decay for he had dignity to the last but death seemed entirely to have full and fast hold he assured me he saw no visitors therefore this permission was the more kind he complained of excruciating agony and in a very  short time  after that worthy friendly brave s  ldier and nobleman departed this life  On Lord Robert Manners stopping to speak to me in Jamesstreet after one of our usual chats he wished my success in London might equal that of Dublin and we parted but he had no soon  r left me than as I was pursuing my walk a strong voice issued from a  iningroom window with great vehemence calling out  "Wilkinson Wilkinson Wilkinson'  I looked round and soon spied my Master Foote as he was termedHis having treated me so very inhumanly during my illness in Ireland and not having heard he was  then  engaged at Drury Lane had determined me from the time he quitted  Dublin never to trouble myself as to any future intimacy or acquaintance with him but life's chapter of accidents is so various and hangs by such nice threads that there is no directing being directed or advised for the best It would certainly have appeared very rude not to have complied with so smiling and earnest a summons and after ten minutes conversation all my slights and wrongs were forgot and forgiven and sure if ever  one  person possessed the talents of pleasing more than another Mr Foote was certainly the man I can aver in all my observations that I never met with his equal Mr Garrick whom I have dined and supped with was far inferior to him in wit or repartee as indeed were persons of rank and degree for Nature bestows not  all her graces  on the great or the opulent Mr Foote was not confined to any particular topic he was equal in all religion law politics manners of this or any age and the stage of course Indeed a polished stranger would find it rare to meet with so many agreeable qualities for the conviviality of any company so combined as in a society with Mr Foote This is not the tribute of flattery to his memory but a piece of justice my own impartiality demands for it would be despicable indeed to point out his foibles and not be ready to attest his good qualities As a wit he is too well  remembered and far beyond my abilities to describe As a blemish to his entertaining and improving qualities I must as a relater of truth remark that all these shining talents did not dazzle or answer the eager expectation unless he himself was the sole object of every directed eye for if a man of genius I will suppose a Murphy or a Henderson had slipt in a good story or had given any entertaining information and thereby gained the approbation and merit of the flowing souls Foote not only immediately felt lessened but could not easily recover his chagrin and jealousy and the instant the guest had taken his leave and departed he could not help expressing himself with great contempt and asking the person or persons remaining if they had ever heard such dd nonsence as that man had been uttering and added expressions of wonder why the hounds at table should be entertained with such absurdity But indeed to give the just picture I must add as a true historianhad the company left him in the best humour those very spirits were only reserved for the exposure of each person's failure or particular manner and which most people more or less have as a certain appendage tagged to human nature nor did that happen in a less but even in a stronger degree to himself for his own peculiarities were more extravagant than any person's  whose gait or gesture or history he might choose to record or divert himself with and if not given immediate credit for what he asserted against the absentee he would vigorously fly to his happy reserve of neverfailing fiction which was veiled under such an appearance of truth aided by wi  humour and great vivacity that he generally made converts who from irresistible impulse obeyed his laughing mandates It was policy to defer as long as possible quitting the room where he was monarch as it was certain the instant of any one's exit without loss of time to be served up raw or roasted to the next comer and that without mercy although the person had on the hour of his adieu conferred on Mr Foote an obligation of the utmost necessary service This idea cannot be better exemplified than by Mr Murphy in his excellent and entertaining comedy of Know your own MindThe speech runs thus  " Could not you stay till my back was fairly turn'd"  My trait of Mr Foote is true and I think I may assert when Mr Murphy wrote that line he wrote it as if Foote had at that instant been at his elbow  Mr Foote possessed with all these foibles mingled excellencies generosity and humanity but vast  ostentation was annexed to them His table was open  e loved company at that table and if they pronounced his wine had a superior flavour you could not have drank too much or could he himself  ave been gratified till he had produced his cla  t of the best vintage  ow Garrick was always on a fidget eager for  tion and adulation and when he thought  free and adored woul  prattle such stuff  s  ould disgrace a child of eight years old in conversation with its admiring and doting grandmamma His hesitation and never giving a direct answer arose from two cause  affe  tation and a fear of being led into promises which he never meant to perform and therefore  "Bynaywhynow if you will notwhy I cannot say but I may settle that matter and as I shall see you on Tue  day why thenHev you know thatBut Mrs Garrick is waitingand you nowI say n  wheynow Tuesday You will remember  ues  ay"  As to money he seldom w  en walking the streets had any therefore could only lament his inability to give to a distressed supplicant but if greatly touched  "Why Holland" or any other person that was with him "Cannot you now advance halfacrown and be dd to you"  which if Holland did was a very good joke and for fear of spoiling the jest he never paid Holland  again As to his vulgar vein of humour which really deserves no other epithet when I was to perform the part of Bajazet I shall in time and place take the liberty to relate one strong proof though I confess I think it too gross to mention and therefore it requires an apology and if it falls into a fair lady's hand I give a long warning no less than twelve months and request she will take Sir Clement Flint's advice in the Heiress and skip over the leaf I would wish to avoid meanness abuse or falsehood and give an exact and candid trait of Mr Garrick and Mr Foote with their shades but by no means to obscure their lights and good qualities and hope I shall prove my words on the examination of the sum total and that my readers will say my accounts are given in like a just steward and with those gentlemen and myself the reckoning shall be fairly balanced  I must beg pardon for having left Mr Foote so long a time waiting in his diningroom in Jamesstreet he eagerly repeated his astonishment at not having seen or ever heard from me he was quite anxious to know what I had been doi  g since he last saw me in Ireland and what and when I was to appear at DruryLane not having a doubt of my success let the chara  er be what it would He had the repeated pleasure of  meeting with his friend Colonel Thornton since his return from the late expedition against Cherbourgh who told him that he was acquainted with me at Portsmouth and had been much entertained with my performances at that theatre Mr Foote insisted on my staying dinner which invitation I could not refuse after dinner and while the glass was circulating he intimated a wish I would make my first appearance at DruryLane as his pupil in a farce he had newly furbished up and titled the Diversions of the Morning and added  "You must Wilkinson plainly see and be convinced that dirty hound Garrick does not mean to do you any service or wish you success but on the contrary he is a secret enemy and if he can prevent your doing well be assured he will I know his heart so well that if you give me permission to ask for your first attempt on his stage and to be in my piece the hound will refuse the moment I mention it and though his little soul would rejoice to act Richard III in the Dog Days before the hotest kitchen fire for a sop in the pan yet I know his mean soul so perfectly that if on his refusal I with a grave face tell him I have his figure exactly made and dressed as a puppet in my closet ready for public admiration the fellow will not only consent to your acting but  what is more  extraordinary his abject fears will  lend me money if I should say I want it"  This I must own seems a severe picture but the traits are from the life and a true delineation of character from which a person who had not been acquainted with Mr Garrick might be led to suppose he was a weak man but it was far from being really the case for his understanding and quickness of comprehension with fire and vivacity were infinite yet at repartee Foote having the advantage he sunk in comparison but his real penetration far exceeded Mr Foote's and his great caution had brought on the  "Heynowwhat" c  But reader I shall be in a better humour with him by and bye and he with me where of course I shall think he appears to more advantage however that bask of sunshine did not last but changed like April and was inconstant as the wind Foote never was in awe of Garrick but ever treated him with the most cutting satire and well knew the way to profit from Garrick was by always acting on his fears Mr Murphy used frequently to treat Garrick in the same manner if he expected to obtain justice when connected on matters of theatrical business and indeed Mr Murphy continued a teaser to the Roscius till the year of his death whenever he met him in company If I have uttered a falsehood I beg Mr  Murphy will correct me whom I have not seen since February at which time he conferred an obligation and related a whimsical story of their meeting in a mixed company where Mrs Garrick and Miss Moore the authoress were of the party However strange it may appear tho' Garrick made avarice his idol yet fear was so predominant to preserve his fame so all alive that his own shadow if he thought it obscured his greatness would be sufficient to alarm and distu  his night's repose  With very little thought I assented to Mr Foote's proposal which I just now mentioned of playing in his farce and verily believe if I had not that I never should have had an opportunity of appearing on DruryLane stage unless in some part totally unfit for me when Mr Garrick would have said and published he had really out of charity done all he could to serve me but found it was impossible to make any thing to the purpose of such a blockhead I should then have been discarded and what would have been more fatal Pope Garrick's denouncing damnation would of course have rendered all my struggling for fame in vain for as Sancho says  "  Give a dog an ill name and hang him  "  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
