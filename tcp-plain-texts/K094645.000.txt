 SYMPATHY OR A SKETCH OF THE SOCIAL PASSION  A POEM  THE THIRD EDITION  LONDON  PRINTED FOR T CADELL  M DCC LXXXI  INTRODUCTION  THE Reader is requested to consider the following Poem as nothing more than what a part of its titlepage expressesa SKETCH and only a sketch of the Social Passion or Sympathetic Principle applied first to the Author's particular situation and thence extended more generally as influencing the whole animal creation  Upon visiting the Villa of a friend and finding it deserted by a family extremely dear to the Author he experienced precisely the sensations he has endeavoured  to describe It was natural for him to pass beyond his own case and contemplate that of others under similar circumstances The fairest productions of animated nature were before him They occupied the same spot He was seated in the midst of them His heart dilated If as seems to be admitted a virtuous enthusiasm be necessary to the proper enjoyment of such scenery the Critic of Nature will hardly know how to be offended should he find that here and there have been indulged effusions which if closely examined when the mind is cold may be sound not altogether in strict connection  It were easy to have thrown out from the argumentative parts some sentiments not quite in keeping with the theme but zealous to prove the powers of Universal  Sympathy the writer felt the sollicitudes of an author united with those of a philanthropist Of course the idea of obliterating what had any chance of cementing the social affections was too painful to be adopted  If therefore candour should urge that in stepping occasionally out of his path his intention has been rather to gather flowers than weeds he will be forgiven The poetical licence becomes a matter rather of right than of courtesy when an author pleads his privilege in the cause of Benevolence He pretends not to have preserved an exact correspondence between the several members  Immethodical however as the poem confessedly is the  lucidus ordo  of composition has not been by any means  wantonly discarded nor ought the Author to conceal what it is indeed his chief pride to acknowledge the obligations he is under to some of the first and greatest writers in this country for many valuable hints of which he has availed himself in the course of the performance  SYMPATHY  BOOK  I  OE'R you fair lawn where oft in various talk  The fav'ring Muses join'd our evening walk  Up yonder hill that rears its crest sublime  Where we were wont with gradual steps to climb  To woo the dewbath'd zephirs on the wing  And hear the Lark her earliest matin sing  Fast by you shed of roots and verdure made  Where we have paus'd companions of the shade  In yonder cot just seated on the brow  Whence unobserv'd we view'd the world below  Whence oft we cull'd fit objects for our song  From land or ocean largely stretch'd along  The morning vapours passing through the vale  The distant turret or the lessening sail  The pointed cliff which overhangs the main  The breezy upland or the opening plain  Or down yon footway saunter'd by the stream  Whose little rills ran tinkling to the theme  More softly touch'd the woe in Hammond's lay  Or laps'd responsive to the lyre of Gray  O'er these dear bounds like one forlorn I roam  O'er these dear bounds I fondly call'd my home  And yet to touch me various powers combine  Here summer revels with a warmth divine  The bloomy season every charm supplies  From earth's rich harvest crown'd with cloudless skies  Or future plenty bursting through the grain  From golden sheaves that circle round the swain  Here as I stop beneath Eliza's tree  Far oh belov'd associate far from thee  Some little CHANGE thy absence to declare  I pray to find and friendship forms the pray'r  Less bright the sunbeams or less soft the show'rs  Some essence wanting to the fruits or flow'rs  Those fruits and flow'rs alas more ripe appear  And the lawn smiles as though my friend were here  From the soft myrtle brighter blossoms spring  In mellower notes the plumy people sing  Near yonder church where we retir'd to pray  The good man's modest cottage I survey  The pious Pastor who each sabbath taught  The listening rustic's noblest reach of thought  That modest cottage and its garden still  Seek the soft shelter of the friendly hill  The column'd smoke still curls its wreathes around  And not one lessen'd beauty marks the bound  As near you bow'r with pensive steps I go  To view the shrubs your culture taught to grow  The fair exotics boast a happier bloom  Than when their patron shar'd the rich perfume  The orange still its tawny lustre shews  The late rose reddens and the balsam blows  While roving o'er the hedge the woodbine fair  Embalms with heaven's own essence heaven's own air  Not softer and not sweeter flew the gale  When we together trod this blooming vale  When far beyond the busy world's controul  Nature our guide we open'd all the soul  Whence this neglect say in thy lov'd domain  Where all the virtues in thy presence reign  Where gathering round thee youth and age conspire  While some as brother court thee some as sire  Where all the social passions softly blend  To give the similing neighbourhood a friend  Where somewhat of thy gentle heart is seen  A grace or goodness adding to the green  Where the babe lisps thy mercies on the knee  And second childhood leans it's crutch on thee  Whence this neglect Ingratitude retreat  Go and in shades less sacred fix thy seat  Go to the treach'rous world thy proper sphere  But oh forbear to scatter poisons here  About this dwelling and these harmless bounds  Friendship and Love alone should take their rounds  Fair as the blossoms which the walls sustain  Rich as the fruits and generous as the grain  Secure as yonder warblers nesting near  Like Honour steady and like Faith sincere  But soft my friend tho' shrubs and bow'rs remain  The fix'd productions of th' unconscious plain  Though these no gentle sympathies can know  But as the planter bends them learn to grow  To higher parts as nature lifts her plan  The kinder creatures haply feel for man  The tame domestics which attend his board  Haply partake the fortune of their lord  His presence hail his absence long deplore  Droop as he droops and die when he's no more  Pleas'd at the thought still onward let me tread  Where flocks and herds diversify the mead  Where breathing odours winnow'd by the gale  Fan the soft bosom of the smiling vale  Behind the rooks their brawling councils hold  And the proud peacock trails his train of gold  Around the doves their purple plumage shew  And clucking poultry saunter pleas'd below  While there the housedog with accustom'd glee  Fawns on the hindand ne'er remembers thee  These crop the food those press the flow'ry bed  Nor weep the absent nor bewail the dead  Their stinted feelings seem but half awake  Dull as you steer now slumbering in the brake  Whence then the gloom that gathers in the sky  Whence the warm tear now starting to the eye  Whence then th' apparent change when friends depart  'Tis FANCY striking on the feeling heart  'Tis varied Fancy whose aetherial wand  Bids plastic nature move to her command  Oh should I follow where  she  leads the way  What magic meteors to her touch would play  Far far from thee this sun which gilds my brow  In deep eclipse would darken all below  The herds though now plain reason sees them feed  Smit by her touch would languish in the mead  The breeze which now disports with yonder spray  The flocks which pant beneath the heats of day  The pendent copse in passing shadows drest  The scanty herbage on the mountain's crest  The balmy pow'rs that essence ev'ry gale  The glassy lakes that fertilize the dale  Struck by  her  mystic sceptre all would fade  And sudden sadness brood along the shade  Thus Chloe weds but  she  the garland twines  Thus Bacchus revels but  she  twists the vines  Thus falls a friend but  she  around the grave  Bids willows whisper and the cypress wave  As poets sing thus Fancy takes her range  Whose fairy fables can the system change  Soon as the gen'rous master leaves his home  Behold how thick the alterations come  Soon as the muchlov'd mistress quits the scene  The earth be sure no longer smiles in green  In solemn sable ev'ry flow'r appears  And skies relent in sympathizing tears  Scarce had the Bard of Leasowes' lov'd domain  Clos'd his dimm'd eye upon the conscious plain  Ere birds and beasts and hills and dales 'tis said  Mourn'd his sad fate and funeral honours paid  His gay parterres a serious habit wore  His larks wou'd sing his lambs wou'd frisk no more  A deeper cadence murmur'd from the floods  And elegiac sorrow shook his woods  A solemn dirge the sable raven sung  The muses wept their lyres were all unstrung  But chief his bowers their verdant honours shed  And ev'ry laurel knew that he was dead  Yet separate facts from fairy scenes like these  Nature we find still keeps her first decrees  The order due which at her birth was giv'n  Still forms th' unchanging law of earth and heav'n  In one fair tenor  on  the circle goes  And no obstruction no confusion knows  When Shenstone nay when Shakespeare press'd the tomb  The shrubs that saw their fate maintain'd their bloom  Clear ran the streams to their accustom'd shore  Nor gave one bubble less one murmur more  Nor did a single leaf a simple flower  Or fade or fall to mark their mortal hour  But is it Fancy ALL what no reserve  From one dull point can nature never swerve  Is change of seasons all the change she knows  From autumn's sickly heats to winter snows  From chilling spring to summer's dogstar rage  From boy to man from man to crawling age  These her transitions ling'ring sad and slow  Whence then embrac'd by flowers my bosom's woe  Ah is it fancy that with silent pace  Impels me thus to range from place to place  On ev'ry side to see an harvest bend  Yet look on ev'ry side to find my friend  Or is it fancy makes the village train  For now 'tis evening sport around in vain  That plighted pairs amidst the hazel boughs  To me unseen impart their tender vows  While unsuspicious of a witness near  They mix with nature's language nature's tear  That twilight's gentle grey which now comes on  To wait a sober handmaid on the sun  To watch his parting tinge his soften'd fires  Then blush with maiden grace as he retires  The crescent moon which now ascended high  Her silver mantle throws across the sky  The still serene that seems to lull the breeze  Soft in a leafy cradle 'midst the trees  The lessen'd sound of yonder requiem bell  With resignation in each mournful knell  The dropping dew that settles on my cheek  The frugal lights that from each cottage break  The justdropp'd latch the little lattice clos'd  To shield from eve's damp air the babe repos'd  And note the hour when temperance and health  Give the pale vigils of the night to wealth  Say is it Fancy's vision works the charm  When these blest objects lose their power to warm  Ah no from other sources springs the smart  Its source is here hard pressing on my heart  Yes 'tis the heart which rules the roving eye  And turns a gloomy to a cloudless sky  The soft magician governs every scene  Blossoms the rock or desolates the green  Along the heath bids fancied roses blow  And sunshine rise upon a world of snow  Yes 'tis the heart endears each smiling plain  Or to his native mountain binds the swain  His native mountain where his cottage stands  More lov'd more fair than all the neighb'ring lands  For though the blast be keen the soil be bare  His friends his wife his little ones are there  Oh had the brother of  my  heart been nigh  When morning threw her mantle o'er the sky  Or when gay noon a gaudier robe display'd  Or modest ev'ning took her softest shade  Then had each shrub breath'd forth its full perfume  And like the flow'rs the feelings been in bloom  For still to prove the natal bias right  The senses with the season must unite  The bias SOCIAL man with men must share  The varied benefits of earth and air  The leading law of life which governs all  To some in large degrees to some in small  To lowest insects highest pow'rs a part  Wisely dispens'd to ev'ry beating heart  To every creature just proportion's giv'n  From the mole's mansion to the seraph's heav'n  See the wing'd legions which at noontide play  Together clust'ring in the solar ray  There sports the social passion see and own  That not an atom takes its flight alone  Th' unwieldy monsters of the pregnant deep  The savage troops that through the forest sweep  The viewless tribes that populate the air  The milder creatures of domestic care  The rooks which rock their infants on the tree  The race which dip their pinions in the sea  The feather'd train gay tenants of the bush  The glossy blackbird and the echoing thrush  The gaudy goldfinch which salutes the spring  Winnowing the thistle with his burnish'd wing  Jove's eagle soaring to you orb of light  Aurora's lark and Cynthia's bird of night  All these the laws of Sympathy declare  And chorus heav'n's first maxim BORN TO SHARE  Instinct or Sympathy or what you will  The social principle is active still  Of every element it glows the soul  Touches pervades and animates the whole  Floats in the gale surrounds earth's wide domain  Ascends with fire and dives into the main  Whilst dull or bright the affections know to play  As full or feebly darts this social ray  Dimly it gleams on insect fish and fowl  But spreads broad sunshine o'er man's favour'd soul  Man's favour'd soul then trace through every state  And see it fitted for a social fate  Behold how nature to connection tends  Each seeks from each his relatives and friends  You spacious dome which earth and sea commands  Where Titus dresses his paternal lands  Where water gushes and where wood extends  To share each beauty Titus calls his friends  A naked waste till they adorn his flow'rs  A desert scene till they partake his bow'rs  Nor this though sweet the greatest bliss he feels  That greatest bliss his modesty conceals  Pass the green slope which bounds his fair domain  And seek the valley dropping from the plain  There in a blossom'd nook by pomp unseen  An aged couple lead a life serene  And there behind those elms a sickly pair  Exchange their labours for a softer care  'Twas Titus gave to sickness this repose  And plac'd life's second cradle near the rose  In his own hall though louder joys prevail  A dearer transport whispers from the vale  Though mirth and frolic echo through the dome  In those small cots his bosom finds a home  Fame fortune friends can providence give more  Go ask of heav'n the blessings of the poor  A greater comfort would you still supply  Then wipe the tear from sorrow's streaming eye  For social kindness to another shewn  Expands the bliss to make it more your own  Lo the rude savage naked and untaught  Shares with his mate what arts and arms have caught  When winter darkness clouds his long long night  See how he strives to find the social light  His woodland wife his forest children dear  Smooth the bleak storms that sadden half his year  For them he tracks the monster in the snow  For them he hurls his sling and twangs his bow  Nor scorching sunshine nor the driving show'r  The vollied thunder nor the light'ning's pow'r  Nor climes where sickness pants in every breeze  Nor worlds of ice where nature seems to freeze  Checks the fair principle which bursts away  Like Sol when clouds attempt his noontide ray  Hence ever lean the feeble on the strong  As tender sires their children lead along  While by degrees as transient life declines  And florid youth to withering age resigns  The social passion shifts with place and time  And tender sires are led by sons in prime  The guide becomes the guided in his turn  While child and parent different duties learn  Not then from fancy only from the heart  Pours the keen anguish on th' immortal part  And truth herself destroys the bloom of May  When death or fortune tears a friend away  From virtuous passion virtuous feeling flows  The grief that dims the lilly and the rose  Drops a soft sorrow for a friend in dust  There truth and fancy both may rear the bust  While one pours forth the tribute of the heart  The other plies her visionary art  Potent she calls her airy spectres round  And bids them instant consecrate the ground  In magic circles lo the illusions come  To shroud the earth in monumental gloom  Fancy presides as sov'reign of the scene  And dark is every leaf of every green  Whilst reason loves to mix with her's the tear  And the fair mourners form a league sincere  Her airy visions fancy may impart  And reason listen to the charmer's art  In life's fair morn I knew an aged seer  Who sad and lonely past his joyless year  Betray'd heartbroken from the world he ran  And shunn'd oh dire extreme the face of man  Humbly he rear'd his hut within the wood  Hermit his beard a hermit's was his food  Nitch'd in some corner where the gelid caves  With chilling drops the rugged rockstone laves  Hour after hour the melancholy sage  Drop after drop to reckon would engage  The ling'ring day and trickling as they fell  A tear went with them to the narrow well  Then thus he moraliz'd as slow it past  "This brings me nearer Lucia than the last  "And this now streaming from the eye" said he  "Oh my lov'd child will bring me nearer thee"  When first he roam'd his dog with anxious care  His wandring's watch'd as emulous to share  In vain the faithful brute was bid to go  Vain sought the sage a solitary woe  The pilgrim paus'd th' attendant dog was near  Slept at his feet and caught the falling tear  Up rose the pilgrim up the dog would rise  And every way to win a master tries  "Then be it so Come faithful fool" he said  One pat encourag'd and they sought the shade  An unfrequented thicket soon they found  And both repos'd upon the leafy ground  Mellifluous murm'rings told the fountains nigh  Fountains which well a pilgrim's drink supply  And thence by many a labyrinth it led  Where ev'ry tree bestow'd an evening bed  Skill'd in the chace the faithful creature brought  Whate'er at morn or moonlight course he caught  But softest pity gave the sage to all  Nor saw unwept his dumb associates fall  He was in sooth the gentlest of his kind  And though a hermit had a social mind  "And why said he must man subsist by prey  "Why stop you melting music on the spray  "Why when assail'd by hounds and hunter's cry  "Must half the harmless race in terror fly  "Why must we work of innocence the woe  "Still shall this bosom throb these eyes o'erflow  "A heart too tender here from man retires  "A heart that aches if but a wren expires"  Thus liv'd the master good the servant true  Till to its God the master's spirit flew  Beside a fount which daily water gave  Stooping to drink the pilgrim found a grave  All in the running stream his garments spread  And dark damp verdure ill conceal'd his head  Crouch'd in the water the survivor stood  Sick'ning with sorrow and rejecting food  The faithful servant from that fatal day  Watch'd the lov'd corpse and piteous pin'd away  Five nights he fill'd the forest with his moan  Five nights he join'd the passing spectre's groan  At length the screechowl flapping boded death  And soon the servant yielded up his breath  His head upon his master's cheek was found  While the obstructed waters mourn'd around  But sordid souls are ever in distress  To bless himself each must a second bless  Then kindle on till he the world embrace  And in love's Caestus gird the human race  Thus social grief can finer joys impart  Than the dull pleasures of a miser heart  Thus with more force can melancholy warm  Than wild ambition's solitary charm  And oh just heav'n what gift canst thou bestow  What gem so precious as a tear for woe  A tear more full of thee oh power divine  Than all the dross that ripens in the mine  As man with man with creature creature keeps  In summer feeds in view in winter creeps  More close but take the lamb apart  From its lov'd mother then the social heart  Plains in its voice while sad the dam around  Bleats o'er the theft and leaves uncropt the ground  In yonder huts at this profound of night  The twelfth hour striking as these lines I write  In yonder scatt'ring huts now ev'ry swain  With ev'ry maid and matron of the plain  In sleep's soft arms on wholsome pallets prest  Breathe forth the social passion as they rest  But should dire fate the father make its prey  Or snatch untimely one lov'd child away  Should the fair damsel sicken in her bloom  Or bear the faithful housewife to the tomb  No aid from fancy seeks the sorrowing heart  But truth with force unborrow'd points the dart  For me as weary of myself I rise  To seek the rest which wakeful thought denies  O'er the long mansion as I lonely range  Condemn'd at ev'ry step to feel the change  Through each apartment where so oft my heart  Hath shar'd each grace of nature and of art  Where mem'ry marks each object that I see  And fills the bosom oh my friend with thee  Through each apartment as I pass along  Pause for relief and then pursue my song  For me who now with midnight taper go  In sleep to soothe a solitary's woe  No greater good my closing thoughts can bless  Ere this remember'd little couch I press  Than the sweet hope that at this sacred hour  My friend enjoys kind nature's balmy power  Than the soft wish that on my bended knee  I offer up Eliza warm for thee  Wife of my friend alike my faithful care  Alike the object of each gentle pray'r  Far distant though thou art thy worth is near  And my heart seals its blessing with a tear  END OF THE FIRST BOOK  BOOK  II  AND now again 'tis morn the orient sun  Prepares once more his radiant course to run  O'er you tall trees I see his glories rise  Tinge their green tops and gain upon the skies  The SOCIAL PRINCIPLE resumes the shade  Basks on the banks or glides along the glade  See how it pants my friend in yonder throng  Where half a village bear thy sheaves along  Low stoops the swain to dress his native soil  And here the housewife comes to soothe his toil  While heav'n's warm beams upon her bosom dart  She strains her wedded husband to her heart  Or from his brow the labour'd drop removes  And dares to shew with what a force she loves  Where'er the mother moves her race attend  And often cull the corn and often bend  Or bear the scrip or tug the rake along  Or catch the burthen of the reaper's song  Or shrinking from the sickle's crescent blade  Cling to the gown half pleas'd and half afraid  While he who gave them life looks on the while  And views his little houshold with a smile  Imprints the kiss then blessing ev'ry birth  Carols his joy and cultivates the earth  But not to scenes of peasantry confin'd  Though haply those more free and unconfin'd  Not to this spot the object of thy care  Nor to the neighb'ring greens that checquer fair  The views which stretch beyond the western main  And mark the district of a diff'rent plain  Not circumscrib'd to these the social plan  Which more extends as more pursu'd by man  Just as you pathway winding through the mead  Grows broad and broader by perpetual tread  The social passion turns the foot aside  And prompts the swains to travel side by side  Both edge by turns upon the bord'ring sod  And the path widens as the grass is trod  In cities thus though trade's tumultuous train  Spurn at the homely maxims of the plain  Not all the toss of rank the trick of art  Can chase the social passion from the heart  Nay more a larger circle it must take  Where men embodying larger int'rests make  And each perforce round each more closely twine  Where thousands lean their weight upon the line  As slow to yonder eminence I bend  Gradual the views of social life extend  Where benches soften the ascent I stray  And stop at each to take a just survey  At ev'ry step as sinks the vale behind  A wider prospect opens on mankind  Far to the lest where those blue hills arise  And bathe their swelling bosoms in the skies  The barks of commerce set the flapping sail  And the dark seaboy sues the busy gale  There the deep warehouse shews its native store  And there flame riches of a foreign shore  Thick swarm the sons of trade on every hand  And either India breathes along the strand  Gold give me gold each bustler cries aloud  As hope or fear alternate seize the croud  To careless eyes the love of pelf alone  Seems to drain off the golden tide for one  But closer view'd a various course it takes  And wide meanderings in its passage makes  Through many a social channel see it run  And carry plenty down from sire to son  From thence in many a mazy stream it flows  And feels no ebb nor dull stagnation knows  Gain pleasure passion property induce  Each single man to study general use  Thus nature and necessity agree  The social chain to stretch from land to sea  Thus e'en the miser opes his sordid soul  Loves but himself and yet befriends the whole  Ask you a stronger proof Place wealth alone  With some hard niggard lock up all his own  Pile bills and bags and bonds upon his shelf  And a close prisoner chain him to his pelf  Unhappy man from family and friends  From all which heav'n in soft compassion sends  From touch of kindred tune of tender speech  And exil'd from the social passion's reach  How would he sigh his station to regain  And buy a glance at man with half his gain  How at some chink or crevice would he ply  And envy each poor beggar limping by  Far happier he who breasting ev'ry wind  Lives on the common mercy of his kind  Who roams the world to tell his piteous case  And dies at last amidst the human race  Ye friends to self ye worshippers of gold  Who deem a passion lavish'd if unsold  Who farm the principles with statesman's art  And like a us'rer traffick with the heart  Who to that idol in its nich confine  The holy incense due at nature's shrine  Say can your sordid merchandize deny  The sacred force of heav'nborn Sympathy  Ah no the gen'rous spirit takes a part  As goodness glory pity move the heart  Else why at ev'ry virtue do we glow  Else why at sorrow do the eyes o'erflow  Why with the fabled hero do we bleed  And scorn the base and love the gen'rous deed  Why ev'ry turn of fortune do we share  As with old Homer's chiefs we rush to war  Why with the wife of Hector do we mourn  Weep with poor Priam with Achilles burn  Attentive hear Apollo's priest complain  Or join our griefs for good Patroclus slain  Spite of your arts the sympathies arise  And aid the cause of all the brave and wise  Spite of your little selves when virtue charms  To nature true the social passion warms  Vain to resist imperial nature still  Asserts her claim and bends us to her will  Hence the great principle to all expands  Thaws Lapland's ice and glows on India's sands  Above below its genial splendours play  Where'er an human footstep marks the way  "Oh for one trace of man upon the snow  "The track of sweet society to shew  "Oh for one print on swarthy Afric's shore"  Thus prays the wanderer scap'd from ocean's roar  In every clime is felt the throb divine  By land by water here and at the Line  Nor Climates only for each Age imparts  The kindly bias to our social hearts  See the swath'd infant cling to the embrance  And feel instinctive fondness for its race  See it ascending strengthen as it grows  Till ripe and riper the affection glows  Then view the child its toys and trinkets share  With some lov'd partner of its little care  Behold the man a firmer bond requires  For him the passion kindles all its fires  Next see his numerous offspring twining near  Now move the smile and now excite the tear  Terror and transport in his bosom reign  Succession sweet of pleasure and of pain  As Age advances some sensations cease  Some lingering leave the heart while some increase  Thus when life's vigorous passions are no more  Selflove creeps closest to the social power  The stooping veteran of the silver hair  Crawls to the blazing hearth and wicker chair  There huddled close he fondly hopes to spy  His goodly sons and daughters standing by  To the lisp'd tale he bends the greedy ear  And o'er his children's children drops a tear  Or every friend surviv'd himself half dead  Frail nature still demands her board her bed  And these some kindred spirit shall bestow  His wants supply or mitigate his woe  Still Symphathy shall watch his fleeting breath  And gently lead him to the gates of death  Yet more e'en WAR the scourge of human kind  But serves more close the social links to bind  Confederate courage forms the embattled line  Firm on each side connecting passions join  'Tis social danger either troop inspires  'Tis social honour either army fires  'Tis social glory burnishes the van  'Tis social faith spreads on from man to man  These all combining agitate the breath  Stake life on life and hazard death for death  As front to front the warring parties meet  For social ends they dare the martial feat  As breast to breast and eye to eye they fix  For social ends they separate or mix  King country parents children prompt the fight  For these alone they bleed resist unite  And haply first hostilities arose  From nice distinctions made of friends and foes  Some scornful slight where nature most can smart  Some stinging insult sorest to the heart  Some wrong detected forfeited some trust  A treaty broken or a barrier burst  Bade Sympathy call Justice to her aid  Till laws were fashion'd and till wars were made  Affection sought from Power the wish'd relief  To smite the assassin and to hang the thief  And over those who faith's fair league invade  To wield the battleaxe or lift the blade  Or from the spoiler's hand to fence the flowers  That sweetly blossom round life's private bowers  'Tis thus the steady eye of Reason finds  What seems to snap the chain more closely binds  And thus each peril like each pleasure try'd  Unites the rosy bonds on either side  But less do arms than ARTS assist the plan  If those defend 'tis these embellish man  These softly draw him nearer to his kind  And mark distinct his seraph form of mind  Lo in firm compact hand and head and heart  To aid the system take a helping part  Their various powers by various modes they lend  And serve in union as one common friend  Hence by consent men clear the unthrifty wood  New model earth and navigate the flood  And hamlets grow into the city's pride  While the soul opens like the talents wide  By social pleasure profit passion sway'd  Some soar to learning and some stoop to trade  Studious to gain the love of human kind  The social sage at midnight stores his mind  Robs weary nature of her just repose  Nor drinks the dew that bathes the morning rose  Nor when the sun to Cynthia gives the night  Eyes the soft blessing of her tender light  But o'er the taper leans his pensive head  And for the Living communes with the Dead  The dusky artizan his effort made  Asserts his rights and leaves the sickly shade  At eve he quits the spot where glooms annoy  And seeks the bosom of domestic joy  The social faggot and the light repast  Await to chear him when his toils are past  Hence too each class of Elegant and Great  Art decks the dome and commerce crouds the street  The heav'nborn Muse impetuous wings her way  When her lov'd Seward seeks the realms of day  The painter hence his magic pencil plies  And Reynolds bids a new creation rise  Fair Kauffman sketches life's lov'd forms anew  And holds the mirror of past times to view  Restores each grace that mark'd the Grecian age  And draws her lovely comment on the page  And still to chear the solitary hour  For this has  A very ingenious and rising artist who has painted for the author an admirable portrait of the gentleman to whom this poem is inscribed Mr Beach now resides at Bath where he is gaining that celebrity which is due to uncommon genius and which nothing but uncommon modesty could so long have impeded  Beach display'd his happiest power  When far from thee I hail his generous art  And bless the hand which thus relieves my heart  I see my friend upon the canvas glow  And feel the smile that lightens every woe  All SYMPATHY is thine th' Immortal strung  For thee that more than golden harp the Tongue  The spheres' best music taught it to impart  And bade each soft vibration strike the heart  Thine too the varied fruitage of the fields  The clustering crops which yonder valley yields  The mossy down which feeds a thousand sheep  The bowers umbrageous and the cultur'd steep  The still smooth joys that bloom o'er life's serene  And all the bustle of the public scene  These several efforts slow or rapid rise  As men are good or bad or weak or wise  Here quick there slow the impulse but the whole  Points to this centre Sympathy of Soul  Nor think the dull cold reasoner can disprove  These varied powers of sympathetic love  Nor hope ye cynics sedulous to find  From partial spots a flaw in human kind  As well the panther might you charge with sin  And call each streak a blemish on his skin  Allow to self the broadest scope you can  Still breathes the social principle in man  Oft when pride whispers that he stands alone  His strength proceeds from other than his own  Oft when he seems to walk the world apart  Another's interest twines about his heart  And call his project rash his effort vain  Still social pleasure is the END to gain  Or say this builds for pomp that digs for bread  This shews you pictures that a pompous bed  This toils a niggard at his lonely trade  That rears the bower but asks not to its shade  Say for himself this bids the arches bend  Or that directs the column to ascend  This through his grot commands the streams to glide  As that for Avarice braves the tossing tide  That this for Vanity his wealth displays  As that for Pride unravels learning's maze  Trace but their PURPOSE to one general end  You see it work the good of wife or friend  Parent or child their privilege still claim  And social comfort springs from what we blame  Frailty itself our sympathy may spare  A graceful weakness when no vice is there  Who hopes perfection breaks down nature's fence  And spurns the modest bounds of sober sense  When strawlike errours lean  In the former Edition printed  leap  very improperly  to virtue's side  Ah check ye bigots check your furious pride  Some venial faults like clouds at peep of day  Blush as they pass and but a moment stay  Those venial faults from sordid bosoms start  And spring up only in the generous heart  As florid weeds elude the labourer's toil  From too much warmth or richness of the soil  While meaner souls like Zembla's hills of snow  Too barren prove for weeds or flowers to grow  This then is clear while human kind exist  The social principle must still subsist  In strict dependency of one on all  As run the binding links from great to small  Man born for Man some friendly aid requires  The contract strengthening till the soul retires  Nor then ev'n then it breaks for still we pay  A brother's homage to the breathless clay  Jealous of destiny the heart would save  Its favour'd object from the closing grave  Its favour'd object chosen from the rest  In grief in joy the monarch of the breast  To earth we trust what fondness would retain  And leave the corpse to visit it again  Or unconsin'd by partial ties of blood  Brave sternest peril for a stranger's good  Once and no second stroke of fancy this  A truth too tender for the heart to miss  Once and not far from these lov'd feats serene  Just where you white huts peep the copse between  A damsel languish'd all her kin were gone  For God who lent resum'd them one by one  Disease and penury in cruel strife  Had ravish'd all the decent means of life  E'en the mark'd crown her lover's gift she gave  In filial duty for a father's grave  That so the honour'd clay which caus'd her birth  Might slumber peaceful in the sacred earth  Chim'd to its grassgreen home with pious peal  While hallow'd dirges hymn the last farewell  At length these searching woes her sense invade  And lone and long the hapless wanderer stray'd  O'er the bleak heath around th' unmeasur'd wood  Up the huge precipice or near the flood  Or mount the rock at midnight's awful hour  Enjoy the gloom and idly mock the shower  Now scorn her fate now patient bend the knee  And call on every star to set her free  Then starting wilder think those stars her foes  Now smite her breast now laugh amidst her woes  Or childlike chace the bee or braid the grass  Or crop the hedgeflower or disorder'd pass  Else would she loiter in the midway mead  Sing to the birds at roost the lambs at feed  Or if a nest she found the brakes among  No hand of her's destroy'd the promis'd young  And when kind nature brought the balmy sleep  Too soon she woke to wander and to weep  Across her breast the tangled tresses flew  And frenzied glances all around she threw  Th' unsettled soul those frenzied glances speak  And tears of terror hurry down her cheek  Yet still that eye was bright that cheek was fair  Though pale the rose the lilly blossom'd there  A pilgrim swain the beauteous Maniac found  Her woes wild warbling to the rocks around  A river roll'd beside aghast she ran  Her vain fears starting at the sight of man  And save me God my father's ghost she cry'd  Then headlong plung'd into the sparkling tide  The pilgrim follows strikes each eager limb  But these alas his first essays to swim  Attempt how vain full wild the waters rose  And o'er their heads in circling surges close  He grasps the damsel struggling with the wave  Till both untimely find a wat'ry grave  And lives the man oh Nature tell me where  Whose rebel bosom knows no triumph here  Whose coward cheek no tinge of honour feels  Flush'd with no pride at what the Muse reveals  Lives there who all unconscious could have stood  To see the victim buffet with the flood  If such a man if such a wretch there be  Thanks to this aching heart I am not he  Hail lovely griefs in tender mercy giv'n  And hail ye tears like dewdrops fresh from heav'n  Hail balmy breath of unaffected sighs  More sweet than airs that ventilate the skies  Hail sacred source of sympathies divine  Thine ev'ry social pulse each fibre thine  Hail symbols of the God to whom we owe  The nerves that vibrate and the hearts that glow  Love's tender tumult friendship's holy fires  And all which beauty all which worth inspires  The joy that lights the hopeillumin'd eye  The bliss supreme that melts in pity's sigh  Affection's bloom quick rushing to the face  The choice acknowledg'd and the warm embrace  Oh power of powers whose magic thus can draw  Earth air and ocean by one central law  Join bird to bird to insect insect link  From those which grovel up to those which think  Oh ever blest whose bounties opening wide  Fill the vast globe for mortals to divide  Whose heavenly favours stretch from pole to pole  Encircle earth and rivet soul to soul  Cease then to wonder these lov'd scenes impart  No more the usual transport to my heart  Though modest Twilight visit Eve again  At whose soft summons homeward steps the swain  Though from the breath of oxen in the vale  I catch the spirit of the balmy gale  And from the brakes the answering thrushes sing  While the grey owl sails by on solemn wing  Nor wonder if when morning blooms again  In discontent I quit the flowery plain  Thus the poor mariner his traffick o'er  Crouds ev'ry sail to reach his native shore  With smiles he marks the pennons stream to port  And climbs the topmost mast to eye the fort  Dim through the mist the distant land appears  And far he slopes to hail it with his tears  From foreign regions foreign faces come  Anxious he seeks his muchlov'd friends at home  Warm and more warm the social passion glows  As near and nearer to the place he goes  Quick beats his heart as pressing on he sees  His own fair cottage canopy'd with trees  For there in blessed health he hopes to find  His wife and cradled infant left behind  Panting he plucks the latch that guards the door  But finds his wife his cradled babe no more  Like some sad ghost he wanders o'er the green  Droops on the blossom'd waste and loaths the scene  Yet haply you by SYMPATHY may know  That here awhile I paus'd to paint my woe  For sure if ever Silph or Silphid bore  One true friend's message to a distant shore  If ever spirit whisper'd gentle deed  In such an absence most its aid we need  Perhaps for now let fancy take her flight  My friend like me may wander through the night  Amidst a different scenery may roam  And many a gentle sigh address to home  Ev'n now where moonbeams tremble on the wave  And circling seagulls their long pinions lave  Where anchor'd vessels in the harbour ride  To wait the flux of the returning tide  Where the salt billow beats against the strand  My friend may take his solitary stand  Or on the rock projecting to the main  May sit him down to mark the social strain  Along the frothing beach may bend his way  And suit like me his sorrows to his lay  FAREWELL my hour approaches with the dawn  And up I spring to leave the flowery lawn  The pain increases as I stay to trace  Another sunshine rising o'er the place  Adieu then balmy shrubs and shades adieu  This passing incense o'er your leaves I strew  Adieu thou dear and hillscreen'd cottage fair  Adieu thou decent dome of Sunday prayer  To each to all adieu your lonely guest  Retires The SOCIAL PASSION speaks the rest  THE END
