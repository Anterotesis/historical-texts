 The Vauxhall Affray OR THE MACARONIES DEFEATED BEING A Compilation of all the LETTERS SQUIBS c on both Sides of that Dispute  WITH AN INTRODUCTORY DEDICATION TO THE Hon THO LYTTLETON  Esq  He that

Esq  SIR  AS I would not insult your singular countenance with any thing like the appearance of a blush I inform you that the following pages are not sacrificed to you as a compliment but entirely due to you as a most distinguished character The position I believe will stand uncontroverted that there is not another man so circumstanced in the three kingdoms on whom they would not sit aukward Whatever consequences we derive from an effect the primary cause should neither be neglected nor forgotten Immortal deeds I own have been atchieved by the executive sinews of military veterans but an acquisition of empire or honours we rather owe to the wisdom of the  Minister  than the mechanical prowess of the Troops  The actions of your life previous to the AFFRAY in point have given you that rank in the Annals of  Modern  HEROISM which your generalship had it been fortunate in this instance could scarcely elevate  Human policy however circumspect is subject to disasters and therefore we  wonder not that this your last undertaking although truly meritorious and momentous has fatally miscarried But I am no mercenary sycophant and can therefore accost the great man with honest panegyric tho' success keep not equal pace with his merits Be it my business therefore in this offering to proclaim  That whereever  LYTTLETON  the  II d  failed it was neither from ignorance nor inattention but some overruling necessity    I have the vanity to imagine that these sheets will find their way to all those various places on the continent which having once known you will eagerly snatch the future anecdotes of a man rendered a glaring phaenomenon throughout Europe The shades of  Hagley  I could wish sacred from their approach For the muses will fly abashed their wonted grovesthe

approaching his aged sire with the tattered garb of every studied and possible deformity  I have the honour to be Sir Yours  c  The COMPILER  THE VAUXHALL AFFRAY OR MACARONIES DEFEATED  THE following paragraph appearing in the MORNING CHRONICLE of  Tuesday July  opened the literary campaign in which the Macaroni forces have so fatally suffered  "THAT the public may not be misinformed by the news collectors of an affray and its consequences which happened at  Vauxhall  last  Friday  night the following is declared to be the truth of the wholeMrs  Hartley  the celebrated actress being in company with others among whom was the Rev Mr  Bate  and Mr  Colman  was put out of countenance by what she deemed the impudent looks of four or five gentlemen who purposely placed themselves directly opposite to her which obliged her to appeal to Mr  Bate  on the occasion who observing as she did arose and seated himself between her and these rudelooking gentlemen who taking offence at this  got up one by one and reconnoitred him with all possible contempt telling him the said  Bate  that he looked like a stout tightmade fellow and capable no doubt of bruising to which Mr  Bate  replied They were four impertinent puppies and could not be gentlemen for their behaviour to Mrs  Hartley  c This brought on a general dispute which was divided into  three acts  till at last a gentleman one Captain  Crofts  addressed himself to Mr  Bate  and asked him Whether he meant any thing against him who was answered No however Capt  Crofts  perhaps imprudently made himself a principal with the rest and after much ill language had passed brought upon himself an expression of anger from Mr  Bate  that he would wring him by the nose addresses were then given very scurrilous language was received by Mr  Bate  afterwards in the Gardens a challenge was sent to him the next morning and an appointment made in the afternoon at the Turk's Head Coffeehouse Strand where Mr  Bate  with a friend Mr  Dawes  waited with punctuality for near an hour when Captain  Crofts  in company with the honourable Mr  Lyttleton  came in a short recapitulation began between Mr  Bate  and Capt  Crofts  who were interrupted by Mr  Lyttleton  as second to the latter by desiring that a crisis should be made without words that Mr  Bate  should ask the Captain's pardon in the papers or name his weapon and go with him in half an hour Mr  Bate  in a very manly way refused begging pardon where no offence was given but after expatiating on the impropriety of his deciding the difference as a clergyman in a military manner waved a remembrance of his profession in defence of his honour and agreed to adjourn with Captain  Crofts  to such  place as should be appointed by the seconds Mr  Dawes  for Mr  Bate  and Mr  Lyttleton  for the Captain who after exerting every thing in their power to prevent any ill consequences reduced the causes of quarrel and defence to writing the better to understand what ground they were to stand upon as friends to the combatants Mr  Bate  being the whole time as impatient for decision as any man living who had conceived himself injured but just as Mr  Lyttleton  and Mr  Dawes  were going out to chuse their pistols the Hon Mr  FitzGerall  broke in with apparent anger and demanded satisfaction of Mr  Bate  for his friend Capt  Miles  but Mr  Lyttleton  and Mr  Bate  remonstrated with him on the great inconsistency of giving that satisfaction when Mr  Bate  and Capt  Crofts  were then going out yet he insisted on his friend's having satisfaction first to which Capt  Crofts  replied in a way that did him honour that he was highly offended at the mode of Mr  FitzGerall  's calling on Mr  Bate  after they had agreed to go out on one and the same quarrel and said that he never understood that one man was bound to fight a whole company where the supposed offence was given in gross and not in particular Mr  FitzGerall  however continued his anger saying that his friend could not wait and he was determined Mr  Bate  should not go out with Capt  Crofts  till his affair was settled From this circumstance Mr  Lyttleton  and Mr  Dawes  then thinking from the particulars they had heard on both sides a trifling acknowledgment that each was wrong would be best recommended it to the parties who with some difficulty complied and were made friends Thus ended matters relative to Capt  Crofts  and with respect to Mr  FitzGerall  he declared that had Capt  Crofts  Mr  Bate  and their seconds Mr  Dawes  and Mr  Lyttleton  gone out he would have prevented a duel by putting the former under an arrest The former matter being thus settled Mr  Bate  desired Mr  FitzGerall  to introduce his friend who he alledged was injured He answered that it would be better without for that he was a hotheaded man and might come to blows without ceremony Mr  Bate  however insisted on seeing him observing that he could not receive any violence from him being conscious he had never offended him On being introduced he said unless Mr  Bate  would box him he would beat him in every public place he met him Mr  Bate  then said if he did he would defend himself for though he was capable of boxing he never chose to decide any differences that way but with those from whom he could have no other satisfaction still as Capt  Miles  triumphed in this refusal Mr  Bate  with very great reluctance consented to meet him on his own terms and accordingly a long room was fixed on and Mr  Dawes  and Mr  FitzGerall  were to second the bruisers who immediately prepared themselves for battle in the presence of Mr  Lyttleton  Mr  FitzGerall  and another At first the advantage seemed against Mr  Bate  but a fair setto for about twenty minutes convinced the company but particularly Capt  Miles  that Mr  Bate  though inferior in size was victorious who never received one blow that he felt Capt  Miles  was sent home in a coach with his face a perfect jelly and Mr  Bate  was invited to dine with the Hon Mr  Lyttleton  on the morrow as a proof of the applause he highly merited A greater instance of true courage never  appeared in man than in Mr  Bate  who according to the proverb  etiam quos contra statuit equos placatosque demisit  enforced the applause of his adversaries"  In consequence of the foregoing imperfect account the following appeared in the MORNING POST of  Friday July    To the  EDITOR  of the  MORNING POST  LETTER I  SIR  I SHOULD hold it an insult to the world if this public appeal on a late dispute was grounded simply on injuries I had received individually Society at large is however so far connected with it as to render it a matter of some importance a misrepresentation of facts cannot therefore be permitted without a manifest partiality to that indecorum my situation compelled me to correct  There will not be wanting those even amongst my own fraternity rigid enough to censure my conduct in a  professional  point of view however commendable it may appear to them in any other For these I have no other answer than  I was neither born a Philosophernor bred a Pharisee  The candid however from similar feelings with my own will acknowledge that during the outrage I complain of the formalities of my profession might slumber without any glaring injustice to decency or religionI mean no contempt to the natural laws of gallantry when waving their sanction I appeal to the more serious one of humanity where an helpless  woman was wantonly and repeatedly insulted by a set of poltroons the most wretched and contemptible  The CASE  BEING at  Vauxhall Gardens  on Friday evening last I saw Mrs  Hartley  in company with Mr  Hartley  Mr  Colman  and Mr  Tateham  seated on a bench not very far distant from the orchestra Having the pleasure of her acquaintance I joined the party and their conversation when we presently observed two gentlemen pass by and look at her in a manner not altogether genteel however as custom has in some measure ridiculously indulged our fine gentlemen in these familiarities  en passant  little or no notice was taken of it Not satisfied with this indulgence these gentlemen presently returned with two or three others of a military  appearance  who all seated themselves at a table directly opposite to her and began an attack in form resolutely determined to stare her out of countenance Situated in the middle of her company she bore this treatment for some minutes before she even complained to Mr  Hartley  of her distress Imagining that their triumph was near complete he begged her to continue her seat till the conclusion of the Cantata then singing after which we would all retire These gallant heroes however still continuing the siege she found herself under the disagreeable necessity of addressing her friends generally telling us  "  That the behaviour of these Gentlemen was so uncommonly rude she could bear it no longer  "  On this I turned my head and discovered four of these pretty beings staring at her  with that kind of  petit maitre  audacity which no language but the modern French can possibly describe and triumphing over those female distresses which their prowess had nobly occasioned  To be a silent spectator of such insolence would be tacitly to countenance it loudly therefore in order that they might hear it I observed to her  "that I begged she would not be distressed as I would prevent any future insult of that nature"  In consequence of which I immediately placed myself on a seat directly between them and Mrs  Hartley  This was an intimation that their behaviour was generally remarked and I expected to find it at least productive of the end intended instead of which I became now the subject of their loud horselaughs and wise remarks Thus unpleasantly circumstanced I thought it better to face these desperadoes and therefore turned about and looked them in my turn full in the face in consequence of which some distortions of features I believe passed on both sides  Mrs  Hartley  during this latter transaction rose up and made for the walk observing which I followed her with the rest of the company first justly remarking as I quitted the scene  "  that they were four impertinent puppies  "  A gentleman instantly followed me whom I afterwards found to be Capt  Crofts  of Burgoyne's light dragoons and asked me  "  Whether I addressed myself in that speech to him  "  To which I replied  "  Certainly not as I did not recollect to have seen him in the party  "  Not satisfied with this answer he again demanded  "  Whether I called him a puppy  "  To which I rejoined as before adding however  "  That the only way to  be perfectly convinced in this particular was to tell me whether he was one of the four or more who formed the party and then the application would come home for that I said and still persistedthe Gentlemen who so meanly and scandalously distressed the Lady with whom I was in company were four dirty impertinent puppies  "  After this answer Capt  Crofts  observed  that I look'd very big upon the occasion  surveyed me with a supercilious kind of air from head to foot and then remarked  "  You are indeed a good tight fellow and therefore mean to intimidate me I suppose because you are a boxer  "  To this he received for reply  "  that boxing was by no means my plan however as he seemed determined not to be satisfied but continued to follow me if he spoke three more impertinent words to me I would wring his nose off his face  "  On this he demanded my name and address which was instantly given him I then drew off to my company imagining that the affair would at least stand peaceably over till the morrow  Previous to our leaving the Gardens which we intended to do immediately we were under the necessity of walking round in search of one of our company when at the further end of the walk we discovered our former assailants now made doubly formidable by a considerable augmentationNo sooner did we approach than they began a fresh attack with redoubled insolence interlarding their loud sallies of pleasantry with  "  Twig the Curate  c"  Submitting to this as long as human nature could do at last I stopp'd short with a view of knocking down the first man that insulted me when Capt  Crofts  touched me on the shoulder called me by name and  begged to speak another word with me which I complied with by going back with him he observed  "That he had forgotten my address which was the cause of this second application on that subject"  I immediately told him again  "No  Clifford'sInn  but desired that he would now make sure of it by getting pen and ink from one of the waiters and take it down"  which he did accordingly  During this transaction a little effeminate being whom I afterwards found to be a Mr  FitzGerall  came up to me dressed  a la Macaroni  and impertinently asked me  "Whether any man had not a right to look at a fine woman"  After getting over my first surprize at this wanton interference of a man who was not even present at the dispute I answered  "Most certainly and that I despised the man who did not look at a fine woman however I begged leave to observe that there were two distinct ways of looking at herwith  admiration  and with  unauthorized contempt  that the conduct I censured was strongly of the latter kind and on that I founded my opinion that the offenders were  four dirty impertinent puppies  "  On this he consequentially remarked  "That even  he himself  had been served thus when  he  look'd at a fine woman"  To which I answered  "That I had not the least doubt but that he merited any observation which might be made to him on that head"  On this he  greatly  answered  "That he would knock the rascal down who dared to say so"  and  nobly  put his hand to his sword  This  interesting  conference was for the moment interrupted by Capt  Crofts  who observed that he supposed I was a Clergyman Receiving an answer in the affirmative he said  "Perhaps then you will  take the advantage of your profession and not give me the satisfaction I shall demand"  To which I replied That he never should find I availed myself of that to act in any manner derogatory from the character of the GentlemanMr  FitzGerall  now became abundantly pleasant on this discovery of my profession which I parried as well as I was able and in return began to hold up this  creature of all creatures  to public derision The dress hat and featherminiature picture pendant at his snowwhite bosom and a variety of other delicate appendages to this  man of fashion  were naturally seized upon by me and set off to the best advantageHere however as the laugh grew warm against him I was attacked by a  branspan  new face another redhot Hibernian who was scarcely intelligible His ignorance of our language I believe preserved me from that insolence which his savage countenance strongly menaced Him however I soon cut short by observing  "that the affair could by no means concern him and that therefore he was an  impertinent fellow  for his pains"  The company who assembled round us on this occasion being desirous of knowing the cause of the dispute I told it them in a few words and then appealed whether I had not done as much as could be expected of me even if wrong in the first instance by giving my name and addressAnd whether Mr  FitzGerall  or any indifferent person had a right thus wantonly to interfere in a matter in which he was by no means concernedSo far sensible of the impropriety of his conduct he was generally hooted by the whole company and jostled into the middle of the Gardens where I left him to lament his folly and immediately took coach and returned with Mrs  Hartley  c to town  For a confirmation of these several particulars I beg leave to refer to the Gentlemen above mentioned The very extraordinary consequences of this transaction you will receive in order to lay before your readers tomorrow  Your's c HEN BATE  No  Clifford'sInn  July    The succeeding Day  Saturday July  the following appeared in the same paper  To the  EDITOR  of the  MORNING POST  LETTER II  SIR  ABOUT two o'clock in the morning my servant came to my bedside and awaked me in order to deliver the following laconic epistle which he said he had that instant received from a man who had the appearance of a waiter and was then in my chambers expecting an answer  COPY  SIR  WHEREAS you insulted me last night in a manner not to be suffered by a man much less by a gentleman I am determined to have satisfaction and as boxing is the exercise you seem to pride yourself upon and the only one that I apprehend you will partake of with me  this is to give you notice that if you will appoint your time and place I will meet you upon your own terms and if you do refuse to give me the satisfaction I require I will hunt you up and down London till I find you and will then  pull your nosespit in your face  and  pull your black coat off your back  A CROFTS  To the Rev Mr Bate MA  Though in expectation of some interview on the preceding night's  fracas  and perhaps a recapitulation of circumstances yet I must confess the style of this letterthe bearerthe timeand mode of its delivery staggered me not a little However I ordered my servant to tell the man who waited without  "  That having some little business to settle in the morning I must defer seeing the Gentleman till two o'clock in the afternoon at which time I would expect him  "  Contemplation naturally arose with me in the morning when the impropriety of this intended meeting struck me having no friend on my part to be privy to any transaction that might succeed I resolved therefore to adjourn the  ecclaircissement  of this matter to a place less exceptionable than my own chambers and in the mean time prevail upon some friend to be present at the interview Accordingly I wrote the following which I delivered to my servant with strict injunctions not to leave the chambers on any pretence whatever that if any Gentleman of the name of  Crofts  or any Gentleman who said he came from Mr  Crofts  should call to deliver it to either of them  To Captain CROFTS  SIR  I WAS in hopes that a moment's reflection would have convinced you of the general impropriety of that conduct last night I was under the necessity of remarking However from a letter the most extraordinary which I received in bed at near two o'clock this morning by the hands I suppose of a waiter without any date or address I am sorry to find that you mean a justification of the measures of your associates and further insist upon satisfaction from me for my just censure of themThe unseasonable hour was the cause of your receiving a verbal answer  that I should be at home precisely at two o'clock and expect you  However upon more serious consideration I find myself under the necessity of begging you to meet me at the Turk's Head Coffeehouse in the Strand that I may avail myself of a friend's presence at our interview lest our conversation be misrepresentedI shall wait for you till fourViolent measures are in every point of view disagreeable to me but when I wish to avoid them it cannot be expected that it should be done at the expence of my honour I heartily wish our meeting may be different from what your threats seem to denounce for you must take some pains to bring  me  to extremities However sensible that the cause I espouse was strictly a  just one I am determined neither to be shaken from it by menaces nor intimidated by any of your most desperate resolutions  I am Sir Your most obedient Servant H BATE  No  Clifford'sInn Saturday  Morning  July    Immediately upon this I repaired in search of and soon found Mr  Tateham  a gentleman who was present at the affray in the Gardens and who readily accompanied me to dinner to the Turk's Head Coffeehouse in the Strand On our arrival here I gave orders to the waiters that if any gentlemen inquired for me to shew them to our room In the course of our dinner Mr  Dawes  a young gentleman of the law and a friend of mine hearing of the nature of the dispute and of my being there sent in his name and begged to attend me through it to this I willingly consented as Mr  Tateham  was under the necessity of going out of town that evening and I knew not at a certainty when the matter might be finally decided  Not long after this Capt  Crofts  attended by his friend whom I afterwards found to be the Honourable Mr  Lyttleton  arrived who were immediately shewn in After some customary civilities on each side Capt  Crofts  addressed me by observing  "  That he supposed I knew the nature of his visit  "  To which I answered  "  I certainly did if that letter which I had then in my hand was written by him and contained his sentiments  "  He rejoined in the affirmative to both  on which I remarked that it was not possible then we could go out upon the terms he might require until he had put some of his threats in execution  Mr  Lyttleton  on this warmly interfered and observed  "  that this was not the time to recapitulate particulars the matter being simply reduced to one point which as Capt  Crofts  's friend he was deputed to ask me  viz  Whether I chose to ask Capt  Crofts  's pardon in all the public papers for saying I would wring his nose off his face or go out with him in half an hour  "  To this peremptory demand I directly replied  "  That being sensible of no impropriety in this instance I should not make any concession at all nor did I think myself justified after the treatment I had received in Capt  Crofts  's letter to go out with him till he had executed one of his threats after which I would certainly attend him  "    Mr  Lyttleton  on this begged leave to reduce the substance of the question and answer to writing which was done by him and me in words nearly as aboveAfter this he asked me  "  Whether I was not now wrong in urging Capt  Crofts  to strike me as from his situation in a military capacity nothing but the life of one of us could atone for it  "  To this I answered  "  That having been in the army myself I was not to be informed of the etiquette thereof in this particular and was therefore apprized of the grounds on which I stood  "  On this Mr  Lyttleton  observed  "  that he must beg then I would go over to France lest the consequence might prove fatal to his friend  "  This new expedition however I begged leave to wave by informing him  "That sensible of the propriety of my conduct I would by no means leave England be the event what it would"  Here Capt  Crofts  interposed  and said  "The matter might be settled without such an excursion for as a misrepresentation of my character had been the cause of his sending me the above letter and being now convinced that the reverse of the report was the fact he apologized for the error and acquainted me that he now looked upon me as a gentleman in every respect"  Immediately upon this I took him by the hand confessed his behaviour to be manly and told him  "That as we could now go out as gentlemen I was ready to attend him according to his request"  Then turning to Mr  Dawes  begged he would provide a case of pistols and any other necessaries that might be wanting The Ring in Hyde Park being proposed as the ground I objected to it for fear of interruption and therefore recommended to Mr  Lyttleton  and Mr  Dawes  our seconds to provide a more private place at the same time intimating a desire that we might have a gentleman of the faculty near us in case either of us should unfortunately stand in need of his assistanceHere Mr  Lyttleton  observed that the afternoon was rather an unusual time for these matters and therefore urged it might stand over till Sunday morning four o'clock  To this I answered  "That the affair was disagreeable enough at present in every point of view to me and therefore I would not on any account suffer it to hang another night upon my mind"  This with Mr  Dawes  's citing the case of Lords  Townshend  and  Bellamont  to prove that it was not so very unusual as was represented produced an unanimous agreement that we should therefore instantly take a post coach and four with a surgeon drive down to RichmondPark and there finally determine the whole difference  At the instant we were about to quit the room Mr  FitzGerall  abruptly broke in upon us with his hat on and in the most insolent tone of voice demanded satisfaction of me  "in the name of  his friend Capt Miles  who was without in the Coffeeroom waiting with the utmost impatience"  Haying recovered from the surprize I answered  "That he came rather  mal a propos  as I was going out that moment to settle a point of honour with Capt  Crofts  which I hoped would rectify the whole matter"  To this he replied  "That his friend insisted upon satisfaction first and therefore I should not go out with any other man until he had received it and that even after this there were  three  or  four others  who insisted upon the same"  I now appealed to Mr  Lyttleton  and Capt  Crofts  to know in what manner I should act telling them I could fight but one at a time and therefore would be directed by them my second frequently interrupting with similar observationsI begged leave that Mr  FitzGerall  would introduce his friend Capt  Miles  that I might see this man whom I was assured I could not have offended  He replied  "he could not do that as Capt  Miles  was so enraged against me that probably he might beat me"  I observed That I fancied myself in the company of Gentlemen and even at the worst I could defend myself and therefore begged he might be introducedHe now informed me  "That Capt  Miles  only came  to fight me my own way and therefore if I  did not box him immediately he would knock me down wherever he saw me in public"  Mr  Lyttleton  Capt  Crofts  and Mr  Dawes  now interposed by observing That I had behaved in every respect like the gentleman that from my present  conduct my character must have been totally misrepresented and therefore begged this matter might drop and Capt  Crofts  and I go out to settle our pointThis however Mr  FitzGerall  flatly refused but while I was in conversation with him Mr  Lyttleton  Capt  Crofts  and Mr  Dawes  consulted together and agreed that with my consent the affair between Capt  Crofts  and me might be adjusted if some concessions were made on either side to which I immediately assented if it could possibly be done consistent with my honour Capt  Crofts  therefore first declared  "That Mrs  Hartley  having been ungenteelly treated Mr  Bate  acted with great spirit and propriety in defending her"  To which I readily replied  "That point being granted I begged Mr  Crofts  's pardon for any unguarded expression which arose from a misunderstanding on both sides"  Thus far being amicably settled we returned to the former subject and on Capt  Crofts  's retiring Captain  Miles  was introduced Addressing myself to him I acquainted him  "That I had never seen his face before and therefore was ignorant how I could offend him"  I therefore begg'd leave to ask him Whether he was the person who took Mr  FitzGerall  's part in VauxhallGardens To which he confusedly answered  "Yes and he now came to take the part of his friend Mr  FitzGerall  "  I told him  "That he would be disappointed of the satisfaction he intended himself for that I never boxed with a gentleman nor ever would but if he had a violent inclination to box and nothing would satisfy him without it I would send for two chairmen give them a guinea apiece and beat or be beaten by them"  Mr  FitzGerall  now said  "It did not signify talking any more about it for that if I did not fight him now Capt  Miles  was determined to beat me at Vauxhall or any where he next saw me"  To which I answered  "I should be there every night next week and would certainly defend myself"  Here the congress broke up Mess  Lyttleton FitzGerall  and Capt  Miles  going out Not willing they should enjoy any thing like the shadow of a triumph I run instantly after them into the street perhaps indeed imprudently and overtaking them on the pavement opposite Catharinestreet I told the  Captain  "That rather than receive any public insults if he would fix an hour on Monday morning and bring either of the gentlemen then with him I would meet him and give him the satisfaction he required"  I received no other answer than  "  Damn ye now Sir  "  Not able to contain myself any longer I beckoned him into the passage of the Spread Eagle Tavern where we went into the front diningroom attended by our friends as before I again addressed him and begged he would not insist upon this porterlike business or that he would tell me how I had offended him intimating to him at the same time that I shrewdly suspected I could beat him Not being able to pacify him with words we stripped and previous to the onset I addressed Mr  Lyttleton  "to testify how disagreeable it was to me and if there could be a propriety in such an exercise which I much doubted begged it might be here observed on both sides"  These proper preliminaries being settled the  Captain  received in about fifteen minutes the  satisfaction  he required not being able to discern a single ray of light by which to find his way home  Three Irish Chairmen I have this instant learnt were hired to attend the meeting according to their own confession to Mr English Hosier in CatharineStreet  "  to see their little Tommy  Capt Miles  had fair play  "  and if it came to a riot in the street that they might lend a friendly hand to carry the point of an infamous assassin  This  ungentlemanlike  business being however settled we all returned to the Turk's Head except the unfortunate Capt  Miles  when my conduct was in general highly commended and Mr  Lyttleton  on his leaving us begged I would oblige him with my company to dinner the next day Sunday  On their departure Mr  Dawes  and I began to collect together some circumstances which led us to suspect that this Capt  Miles  was an hired bruiserHis most amazingly confused address the manner in which his friends treated him and his new awkward vestments all conspired to convince us he was a  madeup gentleman  for the business Determined however to act with caution in the investigation of the matter the next day when I dined with Mr  Lyttleton  I asked him in the drawingroom apart  "Whether he knew Capt  Miles  "  To which he answered with a shrug of the shoulders  "He did not"  Not a word more on the subject passed the whole day though Capt  Crofts  and Mr  FitzGerall  were of the party  On the Monday morning I was informed that  his vanquished friend  Capt  Miles  was Mr  FitzGerall  's own footman In consequence of this intelligence which was a confirmation of my own suspicions I sent the following note to Mr  Lyttleton  COPY  Clifford'sInn  Monday July  MR  Bate  's compliments to the Honourable Mr  Lyttleton  and requests he would favour him with the address of Mr  FitzGerall  Every thing having been settled of the late  fracas  to Mr  Bate  's entire satisfaction except the affair of Mr  FitzGerall's friend  the  boxing Capt Miles  he wishes to have that single point which appears at present mysterious cleared up to complete the general  ecclaircissement  To the Hon  Tho Lyttleton Gerrardstreet  To this I could get no answer till Tuesday which was then but a verbal one with  "his compliments and that Mr  FitzGerall  was to be found always at dinner at the Cocoatree"  I now immediately wrote and sent the following  COPY  Clifford'sInn  Tuesday July  MR  Bate  's compliments to Mr  FitzGerall  and having a small matter of business to settle with  his friend  Capt  Miles  requests the favour of his address or the name of the place at which he is most likely to be met with  To  FitzGerrall  Esq  Cocoatree PallMall  From sending repeatedly after him I received the following concise message at twelve o'clock at night  "That  there was no answer  "  On the Wednesday I therefore wrote thus to him  COPY  Clifford'sInn  Wednesday  MR  Bate  's compliments to Mr  FitzGerall  and is sorry to inform him that the message he has received in answer to his note gives him strong reason to apprehend that there are some grounds for the report that  his friend  Capt  Miles  was no other than his own footman However not willing to condemn him without the fullest conviction he gives him by this intimation an opportunity of confirming the truth or falsity of such report  To FitzGerrall  Esq  Cocoatree PallMall  To this I have not been able to procure the least answer whatever even to the present hour  This is a strict and nearly literal recapitulation of the various occurences which have attended this dispute and is now presented to the public for their conclusions From the tenor of the whole I hope it will be at least observable that wherever I erred it was from judgment only and not from principle The reader will discover that I have been particularly attentive to the darkest hero of the piece whose principal shades have ever owed their height of colouring to the distresses he could force upon an individual or his daring outrages on society at large This intimation will therefore be sufficient to prevent the public interposition should such a wretch be severely cudgelled by the man he has now so grossly insulted  who means only by so friendly an act to prevent his making a more general atonement at the hands of a common executioner  I am SIR Yours c H BATE  No  Clifford'sInn  July    In consequence of an unseasonable visit from Mr  FitzGerall  to Mr  Bate  at his chambers on  Sunday  morning the following was published in  Monday  's MORNING POST  LETTER III  To FITZGERALL Esq  SIR  THE honour of your visit to me this morning at one o'clock was of so singular a nature that a public acknowledgement of it cannot be chargeable with any violent improprietyIt will save us both an infinity of trouble The curious will be informed of the circumstances on both sides without the tedious formalities of separate narrations  In the late infamous affray from whence I derived the melancholy consequence of your acquaintance it is I believe generally understood that I acquitted myself with a tolerable degree of prudence and fortitude The voice of candour has therefore upon that event prescribed a solemn distance  between us for ever you will perhaps think it too rigid since it will now scarce permit me to look down upon or lament the situation of a wretch since that wretch is the wanton selfcreated outcast of society Yet premeditated Villainy must not go unpunished However dark and secret his footsteps I will industriously trace the monster till public atonement be made or he hide his savage head eternally in oblivion  I would fain attribute your dark attempt of last night or rather this morning to those Bacchanalian sallies which have regularly preceded you to the chair of Infamy But it savours too much of deliberate villainy to be less than the machination of some daemon of revengeI own my situation was somewhat unpleasant when four armed gentlemen attended by two others came to my chambers in the dead of night knocked up my servant and endeavoured under a feigned voice and other specious pretences to allure me from my bed the instant I had entered amongst you in the dark I doubt not but your triumph had been complete The summons of a known poltroon I never obey and therefore I escaped for Mr  FitzGerall  I believe was the only one who had even a pretence for speaking with me I honour the impudence of that man who knowing he has too far degraded himself below the dignity of a gentleman ever to be seen in that light again now talks of nothing but  Bullets and Bagshot  Before my knowledge of  your friend  Captain  Miles  you could tamely submit to be called an  impertinent meddling puppy  in the midst of Vauxhall Gardens a phrase that would have called forth the resentment of a grocer's apprentice but when you and the world are informed of the mode of chastisement I have  laid out for you and which is the only one I can now condescend to bestow upon you we hear of nothing but  Slugs in a Sawpit  Think not young gentleman that the humours of last night however oft repeated will shake me from my resolve I have zeal in some instances which may surmount the resolution of an assassin Should you continue to watch each pale moon to her chambers of retirement through the circling year and then steal out when darkness reigns propitious to your design still as long as I can escape the stiletto the ruffian shall be dragged forth however reluctant to public view where as his designs were dark and horrid his punishment shall be proportionably ignominious  I am Sir Yours c H BATE  Clifford's Inn  Sunday noon Aug    The day after  Tuesday Aug  the following was published in the GAZETTEER  LETTER IV  To the Rev Mr HENRY BATE  SIR  THE unwarrantable freedom you have taken with my character in your narrative of the Vauxhall transactions and the little regard you have paid to truth and candour constrain me to lay before the public a  true  and  impartial  account of that affair so far as I had any concerns in it directly or indirectly Nor can I entertain the least doubt but that upon a fair hearing my conduct from the beginning to the end will bear the common sterling stamp of the gentleman the man of honour and if rightly considered by Mr  Bate  himself the  real friend  To begin then my justification even you yourself Mr  Bate  will do me the justice to acknowledge I was not present when the pretended rudeness you so much complain of was offered to Mrs Hartley In fact I was in another part of the gardens But the rumour being instantaneously spread over the whole place that Capt  Crofts  had been insulted with the grossest abuse and foulest language by a gentleman then unknown I own Sir I made what expedition I could to find my friend in order if possible to prevent any fatal consequences When I found Capt  Crofts  Sir you was in conference with him words had run very high between you both and the cause of all this  fracas  it seems was that  "Mrs  Hartley  had been looked at in a manner as you say not altogether genteel"  This being the ground of the quarrel I thought there was room to qualify the supposed affront that had unintentionally been given to this lady and I observed that certainly every man had a right to look at a  fine woman  I flattered myself that by giving Mrs  Hartley  that epithet which so justly is her due I should receive at least a decent if not a polite answer more especially as I declared to you that I only came to  mediate  the affair Sir I am now appealing to the tribunal of the public and upon my honour I solemnly declare I had no other intentions when I accosted you but to mediate the affair between Capt  Crofts  and  you The one I knew to be a gentleman the other by his dress  appeared  to be so and I was in hopes of reconciling you both But Sir what opinion must the public have of your veracity in telling your own tale when instead of thanking or at least meeting me half way in my endeavours to  mediate  you abruptly answered in these very words  "  Damn you for your mediation  you are an impertinent puppy for your pains"  This answer of yours Sir you have not only jesuitically withheld from the public but you are pleased to tell them another story and add  "that on this I  greatly  answered I would knock the rascal down who dared to say so and nobly put my hand to my sword"  Sir you know in your own conscience I never mentioned the word rascal nor did I tell you that I would knock any man down who dared to say so Nature Sir has not cast me in an athletic mould nor has the science of bruising had any share in my gymnastic education It is true indeed when you gave me the ungentlemanlike answer I have mentioned above I observed to you that you had no sword but that you might easily borrow one and that we had better retire than make any noise in so public a place I declare Sir upon my honour that at the time I gave you this whisper in the ear I was an utter stranger to your profession nor from your preceding behaviour could I possibly divine that you were in  holy orders  much less could I dream of any such thing by the answer you gave me which was that you did not chuse to encounter me  that way  but that if I had a mind to try my skill at bruising you was entirely at my service Thus Sir stood the  demelé  I had with you when Capt  Crofts  gave me to understand that you was a PARSON Upon this ecclaircissement you are pleased to say that  "I became abundantly pleasant  and witty upon your ecclesiastical character"  The real truth is and I will not disguise it I replied That I was ashamed of your behaviour and that you ought to have your gown publicly stripped from off your shoulders and from that moment I determined Sir even though your conduct towards me had been a thousand times more reprehensible than it really was and though you had sworn a thousand more oaths than I am sorry to say you did I determined within my own mind to pay every possible respect to your cloth and treat you as a man who if not out of his senses was at least within the sacred pale and protection of the church For Sir I had a character at stake which I might have endangered had I applied either my sword or my cane knowing you to be a clergyman But Sir notwithstanding the lenity and prudence I manifested on this occasion I cannot help repeating that I think you deserve to have your cassock pulled over your ears I may however be erroneous in my judgment as no person is a proper judge in his own cause but if you think my judgment in the wrong Sir I am very willing to submit the censure I thus pass upon your public conduct to the decision and final adjudication of your own Diocesan who I understand is the Bishop of London and whom all the world must allow to be a competent arbitrator  GEOROB FITZGERALL  The succeeding day this answer came out in the MORNING POST  LETTER V  To GEOROBERT FITZGERALL Esq  SIR  WHEN villainy has wrought the human mind to a certain degree of deformity the phaenomenon attracting our admiration may influence the weakest of our passionsHaving confessed the originality of your character and even now astonished at such a wonderwork of Providence considering the frailty of human nature I wish our dealings hereafter to be as limited as possible I own that you have betrayed me into a weakness by forcing me for a moment to dispute the rectitude of the universal system But doubtless the same extensive Wisdom who gave being to the  bloodenveloped housebreaker  and  assassinating footpad  found it necessary in his mysterious operations to create a being in whom should center the deformities of both The man impatient of violent injuries may here be rather innocently led to arraign the Divine Justice but I am thankful that reflection has weight enough with me to banish such melancholy ideas and rejoice from thence to find that a sacred  ne plus  is assigned even to the most refined degeneracy If we could ever be led to doubt the position your letter of this day must convince us  that the vicious ignorance of the darkest profligate betrays itself in language and that his vices are therefore seldom or never contagious but from a personal intercourse  Being now in no danger of becoming a convert to the creed of libertinism and treachery from the impotence of those arguments dealt out for their support by niggard Nature a distant correspondence of this kind I will never refuse you If such condescension can at all amuse in this your disgraceful state of exile from society I have that Christian charity which will not let me withhold it from youForlorn and wretched as you really are I will give you a temporary relief from the pangs of selfconviction by enticing your feeble talents ever and anon into their diminutive kind of exertion  Dragged forth with horrible reluctance ten days being elapsed you make a miserable entrance in this day's  Gazetteer  and after the example of every selfconvicted culprit unwilling to plead  guilty  you make a contemptible appeal to the public in the nature of a defence Generously giving  you  credit for its masterly formation I apprehend the whole burden of it to be strictly this  That your interposition was that of a mediatorthat I damn'd you for your mediation and called you an impertinent puppy for your painsthat you told me I had no sword on but that I might borrow oneand that I replied I did not chuse to engage you that way but that if you had a mind to try your skill at bruising I was entirely at your service    Unfortunately for you my gentle  Paris  not a shadow of truth rests on either of these assertions except that indeed of your being  "  an impertinent puppy for your pains  "  which I acknowledged in my letter of yesterday to have said to you nor need you therefore have taken such an infinity of pains to enforce what is already so strongly impressed on my mind and on that of the public  Rescued from the danger as a naked man I cannot now but laugh at your savage notions of a mediatorbut my wonder ceases when I recollect to have read of two gentlemen going out to fight one of whom was shot through the head by a mediatorial friend in order to prevent the consequence of a triumph on either sideI fancy Capt  Crofts  cannot but recollect the mode of your first address and therefore I will not enforce the evidence of  my friends  till that gentleman or some other will step forth in public and bear  you  witness As far as respects the sword business it is entirely either the effect of a phrensied and distempered brain or the paltry forged evasion of an equivocating reptile To one and the same cause must I assign the origin of the  bruising  since I repeatedly and studiously told you all THAT  was never my plan  Nay had it beenwhat could tempt me to it when Mr  FitzGerall  was the tiny object of my resentment I appeal to your friend Capt  Crofts  whether I did not repeatedly disown such a mode to  him  and if I waved it here where some triumph might have been the consequence how could I condescend to think of such an operation when your little presence of aerial divinity courted my thoughts from manhood to a silent contemplation of the progressive beauties of the pigmy system  No my dear little whimseyformed being let no such rude forebodings disturb thy pretty peace in future Terrific as my strides appear to such silphs and silphids I have long forgotten that schoolboy pleasure of  breaking butterflies on the wheel  nor would I now crush a noxious reptile had it not attempted to sting the foot that meant not to disturb it  I cannot take leave of you without acknowledging your political merit in referring the nature of our  dispute to the arbitration of the  Bishop of London  I will not accuse  you  with the thought notwithstanding its excellenceCandid as it may appear I must however decline it tho' no man esteems this illustrious prelate more than I do I know his worth as a man his excellence as a christian yet his decree must be in some respect opposite to the feelings of humanity You know not perhaps the motto of the reverend bench  "  If a man smite thee on the right cheek turn unto him thy left also  "  This I own is an excellent system accompanied with lawn sleeves these pious appendages have a soporific quality depriving the wearers of any other than a theorical knowledge of it However point me not out to their Lordships as an heretic in this instance for I have no objection to fall into their notions upon similar terms  The fiery taper of youth will naturally burn less and less glaring as Time with frigid hand shall call forth his hoary emblems on our head The mitre then adorns the reverend brow the holy crosier guards its  single  priest from violenceIn this calm standstill of life the hour may come when I shall wish for such sacred protections and without an abundance of miracles time might vouchsafe to work me to the sacred purposeThen being free from the wanton attacks of libertinism my rightreverend feelings would be reduced to a narrow and peaceable compassthen could I perhaps declaim in favour of that nonresistance which my youthful impetuosity pointed out as no virtue and even being smitten by Mr  FitzGerall  on the right cheek might from a fortitude truly religious  turn unto him my left also  I am SIR Your's c HENRY BATE  Clifford'sInn  Aug    Mr FITZGERALL's LETTER to the Rev Mr HENRY BATE concluded in  Thursday's  GAZETTEER  August    LETTER VI  To the Rev Mr HENRY BATE  SIR  THE letter I addressed to you Sir in  Monday  's Gazetteer I flatter myself hath fully convinced the impartial Public my conduct throughout this transaction hath been that of the gentleman and the man of honour  of the gentleman  by my treating you as such so long as I took you to be a LAYMAN  Of the man of honour  by ceasing to demand satisfaction the very moment I knew you to be in  holy orders  It now remains that I convince the same impartial Public that I also acted to you as a real friend I say  real friend  Sir because if I see a Clergyman of the Church of England scandalously exposing himself in public and can possibly make him feel his folly so as to prevent a return of a similar paroxysm I think Sir even in your own opinion I must be allowed to be doing that Clergyman an act of real friendship If you grant me this position then my reply is  "Nathan thou art the man"  For I appeal to the whole company who were that night at  Vauxhall  whether they did not deem you as a man lost to all sense of public shame public character and public decorum  Desperate as your  disorder  was I did not despair to cure it The only doubt with me was the  modus curandi  To have consigned you over to  Lord Mansfield  's tipstaff might possibly have had a temporary effect  but it would not have gone to the root of the disorder and a relapse in such a calenture as yours seemed to me to be death unavoidable  On the other hand had I taken this matter up seriously had I attempted to convince you that the fate of nations is not nowadays decided by bodily strength or muscular adroitness but by the fusil bayonet and cannon and that consequently in a political point of view the science of bruising so far as it relates to gentlemen who are born to command fleets and armies can be of no service and therefore contemned by them as a thing of no value nay had I even acknowledged that I approved of this  bruising science  when confined to the lower class of people because I think the national habits of vulgar courage ought never to be checked I say Sir had I attempted to have reasoned with you in this manner I should only have added fuel to fire The only method then I could make use of with any hopes of success was to hold up to you the mirror of ridicule not doubting but that I should find with the poet Horace  Ridiculum Aeri  Fortius ac Melius magnas plerumque secat res  On this plan Sir I will not conceal from you that my first intention was to have borrowed one of  Foote  's wooden heroes strip him stark naked put him in a true Broughtonian attitude and have told you that he insisted upon your fighting him It was objected that you must certainly see through the game that was going to be played upon you I was indeed of a different opinion and I observed that if the Knight of La Manch who in every respect that of  frantic courage  excepted was an excellent scholar  and an accomplished gentleman could seriously encounter a windmill or a barber's bason your disorder being similar to his you would easily fall into a similar deception  specie recti  However Sir to comply with my friends I suffered my opinion to be overruled yet unwilling to leave you uncured I dressed one of my servants introduced you to him as a person you greatly affronted and a pitched battle ensued between you both to the great diversion of the few byestanders who were privy to the secret which hath been pompously recorded by your own pen in the Morning Post But there is one little circumstance which out of charity I now tell you and that is I gave my servant strict orders not to beat you unmercifully and when we thought he had given you a sufficient dose we not only interposed and parted you but we highly commended your bravery and made you believe that you had sealed up both the peepers of the redoubtable Capt  Miles  The good intention I had in playing the risible farce upon you was that when you should come to the denouement of the plot you might see  quasi in speculo  into what an infinite number of absurdities embarrassments and vulgarisms your  unclassical  propensity for bruising must  as a Clergyman  unavoidably betray you for a man not absolutely bereft of reason to see his error is to be half cured of it and I had flattered myself indeed that I had happily made this halfway progress and was determined to be an autoptical witness of the real fact With this intent I went last  Saturday  to your chambers in  Clifford'sInn  Mr  Montague  Mr  Lyttleton  and Mr  Storer  were so obliging as to accompany me It was nearly eleven o'clock at night when I pleased myself with thinking that cool reason would have resumed her empire and  that I should have found you preparing yourself for the next morning's function of your holy office and that consequently all rancour animosity and illwill was buried for ever in oblivion But Sir how greatly were my hopes crestfallen when after gently knocking at your door I found it barricadoed against me though I repeatedly told you my name and the real purport of my visit In return for this my care and attention all the satisfaction I could obtain was to hear myself called  "an assassin"  with reiterated assurances from your own lips that the first time you should meet me either in the Mall Vauxhall Ranelagh or the Pantheon you would break every bone in my skin Sir it is an easy matter to talk of breaking bones but if you are not  incurably gone  I now caution you not to attempt putting your menaces into execution For if I must be serious with you Mr  Bate  you ought to know that the gentleman who can respect the protection of your cloth to a certain degree will beyond that degree protect himself And I must further observe to you that if in the defence of my person any  fatal consequence  should happen either to you or myself the blame will now lie at the door of your Diocesan and not at that of  Your humble servant GEORGE ROBERT FITZGERALL  Mr BATE's Answer in the MORNING POST of  Friday August    LETTER VII  To GEOROB FITZGERALL Esq  SIR  THE thread of inconsistent villainy being this day reunited I have now before me the whole contemptible defence of the most daring yet ridiculous disturber of the public peaceIt has been observed that my former letters soared too far above the narrow limits of your puny understanding I admit in part the propriety of the remark and therefore in this reply I shall studiously confine myself to that simplicity of language which is found the abler advocate in the cause of virtue  Pardon me if here I breathe a digressive sigh for some noble and worthy personages who till the fatal conclusion of your letter had comforted themselves with a flattering idea that their kinsman was rather vicious from accident than from principle or fatal necessity The tears of penitence young man are a grateful and efficacious offering even to despairing friends winning them as it were by enchantment almost to our own terms of remissionbut from your example we are taught not to wonder that a wanton and stubborn perseverance alarms the dignity of their fortitude and bids them renounce for ever the villain they could not reclaim  I have hitherto Mr  FitzGerall  in this correspondence with you trifled with my own consequence  rather pursuing the delusive flights of imagination than standing forth simply your accuser as the injured man However a just and public sacrifice can never be out of season and therefore I will now pin you down to that public stake of infamy from which the extravagance of your conduct will never let you rise Behold me therefore literally a rigid accuser no longer wishing to trifle with the despondency of a criminal or the patience of the public his appointed judgeIf shame will permit you to look up you may now see how truly formidable is an injured individual rationally collected and inspired with a strong but temperate fortitude the powerful staff ordained to support himThe public Sir are impatient for the decision and therefore no  hired  evasions will longer avail you The following black indictment courts your dejected eyes and truly dismal is such a scroll which bears the stamp of unshaken authenticity  CHARGES Against GEORGE ROBERT FITZGERALL Esq  I I have all along accused you and now more solemnly accuse you of being a wanton leader of the second attack against me in VauxhallGardensof being an impertinent meddler in my dispute with Capt  Crofts  to whom I had previously given my name and address averring that the mode of your  mediatorial  interposition was audacious and presuming  II I accuse you of publickly sporting with my profession of putting your hand to your sword against  me as a naked man without the least intimation  at any time  of your desiring satisfaction of me for the extorted ridicule you received from me in the Gardens  III I accuse you of breaking into a  It remains to be answeredHow Mr  FitzGerall  came to know of this place of meeting except from Capt  Crofts  or Mr  Lyttleton  as Mr  FitzGerall  never called at Mr  Bate  's chambers nor did even Capt  Crofts  and his second Mr  Lyttleton  know it was to be at the Turk'sHead until the receipt of Mr  Bate  's letter to Capt  Crofts  a few minutes before their arrival there  private room the next morning in the most insolent manner just at that instant when Capt  Crofts  and I were going out to terminate our difference and ruffianlike prevented it by insisting that your  friend  Capt  Miles  should have satisfaction  first  IV I accuse you of introducing your own servant to me as  a gentleman  and  an officer  and of persisting in my  boxing  with this savage notwithstanding the interposition of Mr  Lyttleton  and Capt  Crofts  who repeatedly told you  "  that my character had been misconceived and that I had acted in every respect like the gentleman and man of honour  "  V I accuse you likewise of hiring three other Irish ruffians and planting them at the door of Mr  English  the corner of Catharinestreet in order to aid and assist in your infamous project should it be necessary to  enforce  it in the street  VI I accuse you of totally  misrepresenting  the  consequences  of the  boxing business  since  your friend  was beat stoneblind in reality and I did not receive a single blow  VII I accuse you of  misrepresenting  the time of your intended assassination at my chambers on the Sunday morning it being more than a  quarter after one o'clock  as can be testified if necessary by the affidavit of the porter of the Inn  This dark catalogue of positive charges I solemnly lay at your door and defy your every exertion to remove them The fact on which they are grounded I shall conceive as admitted even by your own partizans who were present at the transactions except one or more of them step publicly forth and confute them I now leave you for the present despicable in the eyes of this vast metropolis and even condemned alas by the generous natives of your own kingdom whose notions of honour though sometimes too chimerical will not permit them even to rank with a countryman who harsh as it may sound stands convicted as An INCENDIARYa LYARand a POLTROON  Yours c H BATE  Clifford'sInn  Thursday Aug    The following appeared in the GAZETTEER of Monday August  LETTER VIII  To the Rev Mr  BATE  BY seeing this letter in the paper do not think I mean to continue a literary correspondence with you Sir who thrive by scandal and live upon defamation I therefore declare that as this is the first so it shall be the last time I will publish any thing concerning the late affair at Vauxhall I had indeed imagined that you and I Sir had finally settled all our differences but as I find you have revived the subject by your letters in the Morning Post it is incumbent upon me to set the misinformed public right in some particulars which you have grossly falsified  You publicly call upon me to certify the truth of your having declined boxing during the whole course of your proceedings Now Sir I as publicly declare that so far from declining you long insisted upon it refusing me the satisfaction I required and calling upon me to put my threats into execution which you said you would resent with your fist and your fist only and it was in consequence of Mr  Lyttleton  's assuring you that the issue of the affair must then of necessity be fatal that you condescended to  "wave your privilege"  and for the first time in your life put yourself upon the footing of a gentleman  Again Sir in your letter to Mr  FitzGerall  you assert that I said  "Mrs  Hartley  having been ungenteelly treated Mr  Bate  acted with great spirit and propriety in defending her"  This Sir as I  never thought I never said the concluding words that passed between us were as follows I confessed that you would have acted properly in protecting a lady who had in your company been publicly affronted but that I did not think Mrs  Hartley  came under that predicament and as to myself I neither intended nor offered her an insult In answer to which you replied  "I am sorry my passion forced improper words from me and I ask your pardon"  These Sir were your words and as they were much attended to they must have been heard and remembered by every gentleman present I little thought the affair would have terminated thus amicably as I was far from imagining that there would have been any stop put to my determined resolution of chastising your insolence  Now Sir I take my leave of you advertising you that I have heard of your  terrific  threats and denunciations of revenge These I look upon as the ravings of a lunatic and the frantic workings of a distempered brain If however you have coolly concerted schemes of meditated vengeance I shall not Sir appeal to the mediation of your diocesan or the interposition of Justice Fielding I Sir am a soldier and look equally with an eye of contempt at the mischief of a monkey and the malice of a monk  W CROFTES  Richmond  August    Mr BATE'S Answer on Tuesday August in the MORNING POST  LETTER IX  To  W CROFTES  Esq  SIR  AS a man truly sensible of your situation I cannot but pity your misfortunesYou must at last I think discover the fatality of your league with an abandoned and despicable associate who will not let you now enjoy that retreat from an extravagant imprudence which your penitentials and my sympathy had happily wrought for you Convicted himselfafter the most candid and dispassionate hearing he seems divested of that savage kind of clemency which has dignified the robber and assassin who bear individually the vengeance of society rather than involve the partner of their guilt in the horrors of their punishment This was the  etiquette  of heroic villainy but now lost in the dastard refinements introduced by our modern  fine gentlemen  for Mr  FitzGerall  has hauled you forth ere the conscious blush of guilt had lost its empire o'er your cheek insisting that you shall make a similar atonement with him and that on the same public and disgraceful scaffold  With what a becoming diffidence do you face the world Mr  Croftes  in this day's  Gazetteer  Your anticipations are so melancholy and well founded that I could as far as respects myself let them die away contemptibly with the jargon and nonsense of the dayWe lament the distresses of the wretched culprit mariner who declares with aching heart that if he weathers but the perils of his present voyage he ne'er  will tempt the watery main againYet Society has its sacred claims on culprits of every denomination on that account though you studiously wish to preclude my reply I cannot let you fall a slow and miserable sacrifice to your own wretched feelings and falsehoods when one friendly crush may annihilate you for ever  After a lethargy of three tedious summer weeks you are roused from your somnolency and  now  attempt to invalidate a simple narration of facts which your silence and the public candour have solemnly confirmed However apparently insignificant its orbit that little fiery meteor  FitzGerall  has its influence I perceive on certain  pliant  bodies forcing the timid into that disgraceful service in which he himself has been so shamefully defeated The servile awe with which the whole  petit maitre  tribe look up to this gilded phantom of prowess is a justification of your prudence I jump with you in opinion that an experimentary insult on a peaceable clergyman who fights not but from necessity is less hazardous than even a difference in opinion with another whose valour is founded on  This was one amongst others of Mr  Lyttleton  's observations to me perhaps  in terr  at the Turk's Head It seems not to tally however with an anecdote now circulating at  Stuart  's in Bondstreet where a case of pistols are said to be still hanging as disgraceful  mementos  of Mr  F's  forgetfulness  "  his having fought eleven duels  "  and whose principal beauty arises from having lost the roof of his skull by a pistol shot  The world Sir are already convinced of your folly and my circumspectionI will not therefore now dispute with you myself on the two facts the subject of your letters which you have so totally misrepresented The candid will be satisfied without it and even the incredulous shall be eased of any doubts and  scruples about it by the public testimony of those Gentlemen who were present at the discussion  I cannot however but remind you of this aukward introduction of yourself to the publicYou acknowledge to stand forth on my appealNow Sir if my memory serves me the appeal was to prove  "that I observed to you repeatedly at  Vauxhall  that boxing was by no means my plan and therefore if I refused to  you  where some honour might succeed a bruising conquest how could I in  Vauxhall  observe think of such a mode with the tiny  FitzGerall  "  Your masterly reply admitting it true for the moment is  "That I insisted upon your putting the threats of your letter in execution c c  the next day at the Turk's Head Coffeehouse  "  This is a mode of advancing so truly  Hibernian  that nothing but Mr  FitzGerall  having a mechanical command of you could possibly have occasioned  I believe I have worked myself up into that philosophical contempt for complicated vice and folly to be able to  hear  any thing you can advance however false and atrocious without the least emotion Since your own  passive  disposition and the wellconcerted interposition of an  Irish renegado  and his attendant ruffians prevented the proof positive of my courage I will not sigh for a fresh opportunity of displaying it but rather be thankful that  my  honour has been preserved without the loss of blood on either sideYou may now indulge yourself young man with paroxysms of rage and vengeance since neither  my  necessities nor vices are so pressing as seriously to demand my forfeit lifesince I never mean to befriend that most abject of all beings who has not spirit enough to disengage  himself  from his miseries but  cowardly courts another's hand to drive him from existence  As a proof that I never vowed the least vengeance against  you  whatever I will even consent that all your anxieties shall cease in futureYou shall be a man of  gallantry  but it must only be in those politer regions  where beaux plume themselves on distressing the fair sex  You shall be a  man of honour  in that country where they ask a public and an ignominious acknowledgment of a supposed offender or his blood in half an hour and yet after that  blush not to make the first concession  You shall be a man of  cool  tho'  resolute courage  where danger is happily precluded by  the known interposition of some generous friends  You shall be a man of  strict veracity  where after having been mean in one instance they get over it by  honestly denying the fact  in another  Nay come back from  Richmond  for however offensive to Colonel  Burgoyne  you shall even be a SOLDIER stillBut it must be in that arduous service where FORTS and ARMIES own your friend  FitzGerall  's hereditary government where they fight with scented quil popguns loaded with  bleu mange  whose armour is composed of miniature pictures and chicken gloveswho escape the severities of a noxious climate by an artificial atmosphere of ambrosial essences  H BATE  Clifford'sInn  Aug    THE FOLLOWING Occasional LETTERS and SQUIBS By

excels in all thingsHe was certainly a party in that entertaining  fracas  which he has immortalized by his pen and from his description of  Coly  's fear seems entirely to understand that sensation and its effectsThe public must be delighted with his proposal to write a farce on the occasion I have no doubt it will be an admirable performance  but a more suitable name might be found Suppose it was to be called  "The Sham Captain thresh'd or the Feather in disgrace"  PeepoMalico knows what I mean by the Feathera fitter subject for a farce could never have been chosen for what can be imagined more truly laughable than to see FIVE Heroes all men of the swordmen whose very looks might strike terrorpicking a quarrel with one poor Parson and after having each of them challenged him and sworn  "If all his hairs were lives their great revenge had stomach for them all"  what I say could be a worthier subject of dramatic ridicule than their hiring a footman and dressing him as a gentleman to stand their champion in this noble cause  The piece if PeepoMalico does justice to the story will have an excellence not often met with in such compositions it will convey some useful lessonsthe  Macaroni  tribe may learn from it  "That they should be cautious of hunting a prig lest they should happen to catch a Tartar"  and  "that a man of spirit in a just cause is superior to a little army of bullies whether in livery or in lace"  I am Mr Printer I assure you equally unknown to all the parties of this famous Vauxhall affray but a much diverted spectator last Friday evening and  Your very humble servant Q  To the Printer of the MORNING CHRONICLE  Aug    SIR  THE public has been lately much obliged to the literary talents of a Reverend Gentleman for investigating a difference between himself and an other founded on a political cause they are now entertained with one something similar and equally as important to the world but formed on a voluptuous one for what Sir can we style a party at  Vauxhall  an intimate acquaintance with a Lady in a public character and a display of knighterrantry in her defence but an offering to the shrine of Pleasure Our young Clergy convinced of the ill effects of theological disputes are contriving some means to soften the austerity of religion sensible how disgustful subjects of that nature are become to this polite age they have changed the tedious disquisitions of the fathers to the more gentle topicks of gallantry and honour 'Tis true their intention is humane and charitable worthy the applause of the present rewarders of merit but methinks to please the generality of mankind the transition is rather too rapid Though Mr  Bate  did not contemplate like  Harvey  the calm delights of a garden he might have shunned the tumultuous reverse he might have enjoyed the social converse of a friend without making himself the partizan of a quarrel he could have noticed an insult to a Lady without particularizing himself in an affair which her husband thought uninteresting Perhaps he was impelled by a warmer motive and had a deeper sense of her distress than the other gentlemen present but still he should have considered the badge of his profession and stifled his resentment to some  degree of stoicism The world is too apt to judge from such appearance that priests are juggling with their consciences that their own example shews the decency and ceremony of religion is nothing more than a cheat upon them Great changes are brought about slowly and imperceptibly men of pleasure will admire the spirit of Mr  Bate  but those who are wont to approach a pulpit will reflect that the old precepts of obedience and humility are violated by the very hand and tongue that enforced them they will appeal to their own understandings and despise the man who attempts to pay so ill a tribute to their memories and by losing the good opinion of a few may fail of their salutary designs in general  These Sir are my thoughts upon the subject which if you please you may communicate to the Public that those who are engaged in Mr  Bate  's laudable plan may avoid those indiscretions he has been guilty of and by a  "cunning working of the scene"  descend gradually to a new mode of religion May they retain the exalted courage of that gentleman but endeavour to improve on his conduct is the wish of  Your constant reader VERITAS  For the MORNING CHRONICLE  To the Reverend Mr  HENRY BATE  Aug    SIR  I AM sorry to see in your letter of today that you have allowed Mr  FitzGerall  any degree of literary reputation I would not have any man pluck a  single bayleaf that does not belong to him therefore I inform you that Mr  FitzGerall  writes as well as fights by proxy His literary substitute is Mr Bk Attorney General to the Gazetteer  I honour your spirit as a man equally with your abilities as a writer At the same time I cannot help informing you that your letters particularly the last are generally censured as too florid and declamatory This kind of dress is calculated to hide flaws and varnish over defects and therefore should properly belong to your antagonist Yours should be the stern voice of rigid Truth founded upon stubborn facts Your case is a good one and should be enveloped as little as possible Truth is always painted naked having no defects to hide and would make but an

Coffeehouse  Monday  My dear Bobby FitzGerall  YOU have been after getting into the wrong box do you see now with this same clargyman for not satisfied with terrifying you with his bodily strength for a little peaceable nonsense and sweating at Vauxhall he now is eternally lapping you with his damn'd great English goosequillBut I'll give you a word of advice my honey be after stealing a march as soon as you can and since you may be a little puzzled to answer some of his damn'd logic which as a gentleman you need not be after understanding why do you see me get Capt  Miles  to swear himself an Irish gentleman and hire over again  Paddy Murphy Teddy Bughlin  and  Murd O'Shochlin  who waited in the street to get at the parson's coat to swear it is all a lie about their being hired and so you'll get out of this damn'd nasty scrape  From your's to the bottom A MILESIAN  For the MORNING POST  To Mr FITZGERALL  A CARD  AN Officer desires a simple answer to these questions Whether Mr  FitzGerall  's conduct is not too infamous for justification even upon his own grounds in his letter of yesterday  Whether he would have been tempted to a defence but from the generous intimation of Lord  Bristol  and the  Harvey  family who peremptorily refuse to see him in future except the principal of the accusation be proved erroneous  Whether all the Gentlemen at the Cocoatree and St James's coffeehouse have not on this occasion turned their backs upon him  Whether he has invalidated a tittle of Mr  Bate  's evidence on the contrary whether he does not still appear what he was termed by that spirited gentleman  an impertinent meddling puppy  and the whole of his after conduct savour much of the  poltroon  and assassin  To the EDITOR of the MORNING POST  Mr EDITOR  By inserting the following you will oblige a constant Reader  To the Rev HENRY BATE  SIR  IN reading your l  tter to Mr  FitzGerall  on Monday the d of August I there find a phrase  which I cannot altogether agree with you in you say to Mr  FitzGerall  "That he tamely submitted to be called an impertinent meddling Puppy in the middle of VauxhallGardens a phrase that would have called forth the resentment of a Grocer's Apprentice"  Now Sir as I have been an admirer of your conduct throughout the whole affray at Vauxhall you will excuse me as being in trade of taking the present liberty as I imagine you address the public in generalTherefore Mr  Bate  do you imagine that a Grocer's APPRENTICE or any mechanical person has not the same passions the same spirit and the same resentment as you or any other person in a higher sphere of life and I must acquaint you Sir that had you or any other gentleman used the former expression to me I should most certainly have used a proper and becoming spirit on the occasion Now Sir if in your next letter to the Morning Post you will allow that a mechanical person or Grocer's Apprentice has the same feelings as you or any of those Gentlemen concerned in the above affray you will make me still remain what I already am an admirer of your conduct  A Grocer's Apprentice  Piccadilly  Tuesday Evening Seven o'Clock  For the MORNING POST  To the  Petit Maitré a la Macaroni  SIR  IF truth belies me not you are  "  an impertinent meddling puppy  "  Heaven forbid I should merit  that reproachful epithet or stigma much less take courage to resent it though justly bestowed You will not be easy Mr  Kickshaw  till you get yourself into bad bread and what will you do then Your premeditated malignant villainous and dastardly conduct must by no means pass off with impunity Mr  Bate  would be highly culpable as a duty he owes to himself and to society in permitting it His declared resentment the offspring of a just indignation must be put in force to make you remember how you wantonly abuse any society in future It is indispensibly necessary that your Bacchanalian brethren may take warning by the Parson's exemplary punishmentBecause you have a fortune you are licenced to do as you please and indulge your wanton and vicious disposition in every thing be it ever so wicked and opposite to the laws of God and man If these are your ideas and this your temper the sooner you are out of this world the better I wish reformation to you and your comrades but at the same time am sorry to say that when the branch of a young tree begins to bend it is a difficult matter for it to be streightened when it grows old  Your's c A LAYMAN  Clifford'sInn Coffeehouse  August    For the MORNING POST  Friday Aug    Mr EDITOR  AS the late altercations between the Rev Mr  Bate  and some gentlemen of the laity at  Vauxhall  have prepossessed the Public to know who is the most censurable I cannot help as I happened to be a spectator giving an impartial and candid account so far as I saw and heard which was as follows viz  As Mr and Mrs  Hartley  the Rev Mr  Bate  with another gentleman or two were innocently enjoying themselves over a few Vauxhall  slices  while their auricular faculties were ravish'd with the melodious strains from the orchestra suddenly a violent  squall  of some descendants of Adam whose occupations might be in the manufactory of  wigs  for what I can tell as I never saw any of them before overset their tranquillity and entirely sunk for that night their pleasures to the bottom The Mariners however exerted all their efforts to weather the storm which I'm afraid they would not have accomplish'd had not Mr  Bate  plied his  oar  in so judicious a manner as fairly kept them above water though he rowed into the very nose of the  squall  But to be concisethose gentlemen the inconsistencies of whose behaviour the Rev Mr  Bate  so sensibly delineated in my opinion were highly reprehensible if some open remarks and long impertinent starings to discover the exact symmetry of every feature in Mrs  Hartley  's face in that situation are to be deem'd so One of the Macaroni  Antiloguists  not quite six feet ten inches high but uncommonly full of garrulity with a look that would have intimidated a butterfly thus addressed Mr  Bate  "  Parson Bate Parson Bate as you are a souldriver it would much redound to my dishonour to box you and as I believe you wou'd thrash me were you to try I will not attempt it but you may be assured I shall procure one who will wallop you to your heart's content the first time he meets you  "  By this request Mr  Bate  gave them directions where he was to be  found and as to the result he has candidly laid it open to the public in this paper before it would therefore be necessary to quote it again  Upon the whole I hope every impartial person will acquiesce with me that the Rev Mr  Bate  acted the part of a  man  by heroically frustrating the designs of those that certainly attempted to break a very material part of the Tenth Commandment  An Impartial Spectator  To the EDITOR of the MORNING POST  Aug    SIR  MR BATE having this day published a narrative of the affray at Vauxhall the public therefore have a right to make their remarks on it I shall observe then that I don't in the least doubt the veracity of it in any one particular for these reasons first it is attested with his name and an appeal to the parties concerned secondly the signature wears the name of a man who has acted  nobly  in shewing a nice sense of honour and a man of nice honour  scorns a lie  Having so far premised what must we think of the  military gentlemen  in drawing up their  brazen artillery  to attack a  woman  and  stare  her out of countenance The answer is plain that for their  rude behaviour  to our  theatrical Shore  they are undeserving of the name of Gentlemen  in poorly daring to insult a woman  Mr BATE like a  Dumont  protected her and every man of honour must applaud him for the part he acted He was ready to give them either  gentleman or ungentlemanlike satisfaction  and to shew there was a  poetical  justice  in the conclusion of this piece the person who was himself  no gentleman the boxing Capt Miles  met with  ungentlemanlike satisfaction  I am only sorry that the servant received the wages which were so properly  due to the master  and that the master was beat by  proxy  But there is one point particularly wants clearing up and the  worthy triumvirate  are  publicly  called upon to answer these questions Was not Capt  Miles a counterfeit man of war and no soldier  as Brainworm says or in plain English was he not either Mr  FitzGerall  's servant or a person employed to fight for him and the party Did not Capt  Crofts  challenge Mr  Bate  at the coffeehouse to  try his courage  with an intent if he was found wanting therein to  expose him as a coward  And lastly was not the introducing of the supposed  Capt Miles  at the same time peremptorily insisting that Mr  Bate  should fight him first a scheme planned to  secure a retreat to Capt Crofts  if Mr  Bate  accepted his challenge Should this be the case it is making courage as it were a game at  Brag  and the Captain was bragging with  Pam in hand  for there was a knave secured in his favour being determined not to  sleep with his forefathers  but to  sleep in a whole skin  An answer therefore is necessary to remove a stigma which silence on this head will construe in the affirmative  Your's AN OCCASIONAL WRITER  PS  I am an entire stranger to Mr  Bate  but will advise him as a clergyman against duelling in future though in my opinion when he is insulted he has a right to make use of those weapons which Nature that is to say the God of Nature has armed him with  To the EDITOR of the MORNING POST  August    SIR  THE conclusion of  FitzGerall  's reply having made its appearance in this day's Gazetteer I will venture to say that it is the weakest defence I ever saw and had a premium been offered for the most foolish production of the daily papers the Gazetteer would have carried off the prize  nem con  To prove this what can be more weak and ridiculous than his tale about Mr  Foote  's poppets or more infamous than that a man pardon the  misnomer  who bears a commission under the king should even bribe his footman to do that which he was afraid to do himself that is fight Mr  Bate  This was not only an affront to that gentleman by putting his footman on a level with him but to the army in general in equipping a man with military vestments cockade c that was a disgrace to it and could be equalled in infamy only by his master But to return to Mr  Foote  's poppetsThough it is well known that Mr  Foote  does not love fighting himself I am of opinion he admires that spirit so much in others he would not even keep a poppet in his pay that would turn his back on Mr  FitzGerall  whom for his pusillanimous behaviour in this affair I shall characterise as a kind of  mandrake  tottering under the mighty load of a cockade like the poppy percharged with the morning dew I shall only say Mr  FitzGerall  in both his letters seems very desirous of having the  Bishop of London  for his second as well knowing that the sword pistol and hammer of death form no part of his Lordship's  camp equipage  and should Mr  Bate  make his appearance that he could squat entrenched behind his  Grace's  Church Bible  But I am afraid he will meet with very little relief from this quarterfor his crime is of so atrocious a nature that it is not entitled to the  Benefit of clergy  SCOURGE  For the MORNING POST  To the insignificant Mr FitzGerall  August    SIR  IN the preamble to your defence you intimate that the impartial public will find that your conduct to Mr  Bate  in the late  fracas  has been not only that of a  Gentleman  and  Man of Honour  but of a  Real Friend  Now Sir as I cannot trace the least glimpse of any one of those characters through your whole narrative I'm apt to conceive some errata have been committed to the press  I have therefore taken the liberty to read for  a Gentlemana noisy coxcomb  for  a Man of Honouran Assassin  and for  a Real Friend  ob mon Dieu  a Villain  Indeed Master  Bobby  you have discovered so infamous an heart that the philosophic eye cannot but drop a pitying tear for the depravity of human nature Thanks to the Rev Clergyman for having put his mark upon you The unwary may now avoid you as a noxious reptile and the discerning despise you as an infamous scoundrel There is little doubt but the  bastinado  would be of service to you and as I've your amendment much at heart the first time you give me a gentlemanlike opportunity I will serve you as my grandfather did Capt Bobadil  I will wait for no ecclarcissement of the matter  A Blow and a Word  is my motto  YOUNG DOWNRIGHT  St James's Coffeehouse  To the PRINTER of the MORNING CHRONICLE  Aug    SIR  SINCE I have had a douse of the chops given me by a satirical rogue in your paper of last Tuesday pray give me room while my blood is up to take a fair knock at him in return he shall have it dn me in the true Batenian style Oh oh Mr  Q  in the Corner you've taken it into your head to shew your tail at last I have often heard of  Q  in the corner and was always told it was an ugly thing with a long tail but you are a plaguy fool for shewing your head and opening your mouth any body may see it is but a  block  head a mere mechanical  wooden  head and I dare say the first knock that I shall hit it 'twill sound like an empty pumpkin brainless and lightand so you are in the  queue  for writing eh have at you then and see if I don't set you upon your headthere take thatthere's a cross buttock for you  Q  I told you I could turn you topsyturvy in a minute What a contemptible figure you cut now  Coly  looked not worse when he  peep'd thro' the pocket hole  nor the Parson when he was popp'd in the pond and pelted from the purlieus of Prittlewell in Essex You say you know him not that is another proof of your having a  wooden  head for who but a  block  head would have exposed his tail in defence of a superficial paragraphmaker one that has been scribbling these seven years in oblivion writing  abuse for the sake of popularity and has often been about to hang himself that he never could extort an answerWithout a blush he has addressed the Muses too but they with indignation turned their backs Apollo refused to beam one ray upon him and Pegasus would have kicked his brains out for daring to ride had not Hercules interfered and snatched him from despair advised him to lay down his pen take up his fist fix upon the first coward he could meet with and  that way  fight his way to fame and  that way  the parson has succeeded And so Mr  Q  you would advise me to change the title of my farce but when you know me better you will find me a man who never takes a fool's advice I shall give it you under the title I have proposed  The Vauxhall Fray  or  A Peep through the Pocket Hole  I am about the last scene and you shall have it forthwith till when I am your's  PEEPOMALICO  The following was seen in the MORNING POST of the same day  A CORRESPONDENT informs us that the Hon Mr Littleton and Mr FitzGerall are preparing for their travels the former going to make further  discoveries  if possible on the continent the latter returning for the  benefit of his health  to his native country  And this in the St JAMES'S CHRONICLE of the same Evening  IT is supposed that the Macaronies who occasioned the Vauxhall squabble were deluded into that scrape by the notion that Mr Bate was a wonderful  bruiser they should not otherwise have acted the cowardly part which their conduct discovers The loss of an eye or a foretooth or a bruise in the face is worse than death to a Macaroni but in an excursion to  Bagshot  or an adventure in a  sawpit  none are more ready for not one of the whole fraternity ever feared in a quarrel that you should blow out his  brains  To the EDITOR of the MORNING POST  Aug    SIR  MR FITZGERALL being convicted yesterday on his own confession in the public papers of  infamously  employing his footman to fight Mr Bate under the disguise of a gentleman in the army Mr Lyttleton for I will not call him the Honourable till this point is determined and Capt Crofts are  publicly called upon  to answer this question Were they or were they not separately or collectively privy to the above  disgraceful  scheme It lies particularly on Capt Crofts to make a reply or it will confirm the opinion of the town that when he gave a challenge to Mr Bate he had taken care to secure his own person by providing a  substitute to fight for him  Their answer will enable the public to bestow on them their proper epithets and their silence deemed a testimony of their guilt  JUSTITIA  The same Day these Paragraphs appeared in the same  A CORRESPONDENT informs us that the  Macaroni Club  have had a meeting on the piteous situation  of their brother member Mr FitzGerall and have unanimously resolved to advise that unfortunate  petit maitre  to appear  only  in petticoats at Vauxhall for the remainder of the season as the most likely method of escaping the chastisement due for his late unmanly and senseless conduct The pretty creature  his snowwhite bosom decorated with the miniature resemblance of his own sweet person  may then tread in perfect security the delightful walks of that enchanting spot in company with his equally gallant associates Capt MILES Capt  Crofts  and Mr  Lyttleton  c  A Correspondent thinks it would not be entirely unnecessary to insert the following short sketch lest those who do not much resort to public places should be ignorant of the  manly  personage of Mr FitzGerall He may be easily distinguished from the rest of the noble  order  by the following extraordinary piece of  Macaroniship  Sweet  Fitz  wears two watchesSweet  Fitz  has nine seals to eachHeavens what could not such a sweet creature perform  The Paragraph beneath is taken from the LONDON PACKET of the same evening  A CORRESPONDENT says that Capt Crofts' letter in yesterday's  Gazetteer  breathes an air of harshness which the military are but too apt to assume in the room of candour and gentlemanlike civility When an officer talks or writes to a clergyman or indeed any man of a civil profession he should surely aim at a placid inoffensive style and forget the haughty language of a young ensign to a corporal in a garrison To tell a clergyman that his agreeing to fight a man with a cockade in his hat was the first instance of his gentlemanlike behaviour is a very gross insult to the dignity of the cloth in general the clerical gown is  supposed to be of itself an infallible token of the gentility of the person who wears it The bravado at the conclusion of the letter in the words  "I Sir am a soldier and look equally with an eye of contempt at the mischief of a monkey and the malice of a monk"  is equally  Bobadilian  and paradoxical Does Capt Crofts mean his friend FitzGerall by the monkey since the Papers have said he dresses so like one of those animals whose mischievous qualities he seems fully to possess It is evident that Mr Bate acts openly if he acts absurdly he has neither the malice of a  Monk  nor the frigid caution which characterizes that order  To the EDITOR of the MORNING POST  SIR  By inserting the following letter you will very much oblige a constant reader  To GEOROBERT FITZGERALL and WILLIAM CROFTS Esqrs  GENTLEMEN  YOUR behaviour concerning the Vauxhall affray has not only made you more contemptible in the eyes of the public than you really were before but has likewise shown a meanness in you which I think impossible to be paralleled You Mr FitzGerall I principally address as having acted inconsistent both with the character of a soldier and a man of honour Your behaviour Sir was more like that of an assassin than of a gentleman to come to a person's chambers at the dead of night armed and along with a set of ruffians who no doubt if you could have drawn  Mr  Bate  from his bed with feigned pretences were to have assisted you in your black purposeYour bringing your own footman in the habit of a military gentleman and imposing him as such upon Mr  Bate  under a feigned pretence that he was affronted by Mr  Bate  at Vauxhall will  that  Mr FitzGerall as you express in your letter bear the uniform stamp of the gentleman or the man of honour and if rightly considered by Mr  Bate  himself the real friendNo Sir it will only bear the uniform stamp of a villain and in no other light can I look on the man who because he was afraid to vindicate the cause he had unjustly espoused brought his own footman to undergo the chastisement he himself so justly merited You Mr  Crofts  and Mr  Lyttleton  must have been acquainted with the whole it must have been a concerted scheme for after you found Mr  Bate  had spirit enough to give you the satisfaction you required you meanly while Mr  Bate  was engaged in a talk with Mr  Fitz Gerall  and  his friend  Captain  Miles  only fit for each other's company retired to a corner of the room and proposed making up the affair amicably how far different this behaviour was to the letter you sent at two o'clock in the morning I leave the public to the reference of the Morning Post forNeither could I was I Mr  Bate  have sat down tacitly and not have called you both to account both being privy to it although the former affair was amicably cancelled and how Mr  Lyttleton  could have the effrontery to ask Mr  Bate  home to dinner with him being sensible as he certainly must that he had acted to a man of honour with such impropriety is to me most astonishingIf Mr  FitzGerall  or any of the Gentlemen concerned can vindicate themselves against the above charges I shall be quite happy to find I have been mistaken in their real characters  W  Piccadilly  For the PUBLIC LEDGER  To Mr  FITZGERALL  Monday Aug    SIR  YOU and your reverend adversary have appealed to the Public as if they were interested in your disputes or as if a quarrel between two obscure individuals of little consequence to society and not very respectable was an event of importance to the whole human race  Such vanity I can easily pardon but when it is accompanied with an impudent and avowed insult with a violation of that decency and respect which are due to the military I hold it deserving of the severest censure and since you have submitted your conduct to the tribunal of the Public I shall examine it with great freedom but not I assure you without candour  As to the Priest I shall leave him to contemplate the disgraceful consequences of an impertinent and officious interposition The husband of the woman who by the bye appears to have been too squeamish considering her station in life  only  was obligated to take cognizance of your rudeness and in  his  absence her two friends who accompanied her to Vauxhall were the properest persons to chastise your insolence but Priests in all ages and of every community have been distinguished and despised for their officiousness and the conduct of this Reverend Gentlemen affords me a sufficient reason why I should leave him to his reflections  Your giving the rank of  Captain  to your livery servant is the occasion of this letter and though  you may possibly find an excuse for every other part of your behaviour I am fully persuaded Sir you will not be able to justify the liberty which you have taken with the Gentlemen of the army upon this occasion  The military will not thank you for reducing them to a level with your domestic and after declaring that your respect for the Church prevented  your  punishing your adversary it is somewhat extraordinary that the only instance you give of your respect for religion was the greatest indignity you could possibly offer to it This circumstance I protest is rather unlucky It is a certificate of your country but neither a proof of your courage nor humanity  How unfortunate it is that in almost every transaction you prove yourself a native of Hibernia Let us now Sir proceed to particularsYou became engaged in a riot at Vauxhall but not principally The parties who were immediately concerned agreed to meet and that meeting was at a Coffeehouse While they attended by their seconds were settling the dispute your servant with an assumed name and rank demanded satisfaction for a pretended insult and upon this occasion you acted in your favourite character of a  Mediator  by assuring the Parson that Capt  Miles  was so passionate that if he was admitted he might beat him with uncommon fury I will pass over the indignity offered to the army and leave the Military to correct your insolence they are very capable of doing it and I have no doubt but they will take notice of the favour you have done them I come now Sir to consider you in the character of a Gentleman When you officiously entered the room at the Coffeehouse to inform Mr  Bate  that  Capt  Miles  whom he had insulted was below did it not occur to you that you was guilty of a premeditated falsehood at all times unworthy of a Gentleman and particularly in this instance And was it from that confusion of ideas so common to your countrymen that you blended the character of an  Officer  with that of a  Bravo  Shame upon such baseness By your letter of today you speak of Gentlemen that are BORN  to command fleets and armies  BORN  to command fleets and armies  Good Heavens  I presume Sir you imagine the ranks of Admiral and General are hereditary and that the son of either must succeed to the honours of the father though it is very possible this son might be an arrant Coward and a consummate Blockhead The fate of a Nation so unfortunately circumstanced would be as precarious as if you was at the head of a Fleet or ArmyA misfortune which I trust to God will never happen to us I have one more remark to make viz the impropriety of a drunken man going at one o'clock in the morning to reason with his antagonist attended by three more The late hour and your different situations amount Sir to a presumption that with this auxiliary aid you meant to accomplish what your servant was on trial found incapable of To me your intentions appear to have been hostile and the difficulty not to say impossibility of proving yourself a Gentleman and a man of honour is manifest in the confusion and perplexity which appear throughout the whole of a laborious defence neither plausible nor free from grammatical errors As to Capt  Crofts  was I not assured he had been in the army I should have concluded by his letter to Mr  Bate  that he was the Editor of the Gazette or that a  Statute of Bankruptcy had lately been issued against him and if he was in the secret as you assert he was of giving the title of Captain to a Bravo I shall yet doubt the reality of his Military character  As to Mr  Lyttleton  out of respect to his venerable and virtuous father I shall remain silent I will not add to the anxiety of an aged and unhappy father already depressed with grief and sorrow for the Vices of a dissipated Son  ALCIBIADES  For the MORNING POST  To Mr FOOTE  August    SIR  YOU surely cannot suffer such indignity to be offered with impunity to your wooden bantlingstheir creation caused you pleasureand their first symptoms of animation were employed in begging for their Papatheir legitimacy never can be questioned Who can doubt of their belonging to the  timbertoe  familyAnd now Mr  Foote  will you permit poor  Punch  after the fatigues of his campaign to be pulled from his dormitory and exposed to the fury of the  Church Militant  St Patrick's cross now  "mocks the air with idle state"  and not Jerusalem but the Haymarket is to be the scene of holy confusion and pious murder I reflect that similar contests have heretofore shook the thrones of Asiatick Princesrely not on the strength of manthe valour of gigantick mightor the light troops of the immortal  Bayes  even though they were led on by the  redoubted Capt  Crofts  Reject the  Shilelah  alliance unworthy of your  English Oak  and adhere to those truly Machiavalian principles of sound politicksno money to be returned after the curtain is drawn upnor any person upon any account to be admitted behind the scenesBeware Sir nothing however extraordinary is impossible to a man of Mr  Lyttleton  's abilities if he gains  entrance  be not surprised at finding  Piety in Pattens with a px  and  Punch  with a bloody nosereflect on the personages who have dared to sport with your familyMr  Ln  the disgrace of English nobility the foetid sink of vice purveys for the debauches of this select setMr  FitzGerall  that essence of nothingthat expatriated wasphas already been depicted by  Captain Doctor Bate  and poor  Bubble Crofts  who lugged into the company for the sake of his l note and into the quarrel for his Captainship narrowly escaped the sire in procuring a chesnut for the amiable Mr  Lyttleton  Such a triplet can you tell  Where to meet on this side Hell  Such is the respectable triumvirate which after proclaiming open war with decency and setting all morality at defiance attacks your innocent family and resolves on the pollution and contusion beyond the skill of the most able carpenter of your harmless defenceless Mr BATE  I have just learned that in case you preserve neutrality the junto have for want of  puppets  hired  blockheads  and engaged the Captains  O'Byrne  and  O'Fagan  two gentlemen of approved courage and abilities as succedaneums for Mr  Punch  and  Bob  the  Butler  And Mr  FitzGerall  has bespoke  another pair of cestused pair of Vauxhall gloves  for their armament  AMATEUR DE MARRIONETTES CocoaTree  To the  EDITOR  of the  MORNING POST  SIR  I AM one of that impartial Public who so heartily concur in applauding Mr  Bate  for the great spirit and propriety with which he has conducted himself towards those insolent Macaronics who dared to offend him in the face of the world in a manner so diametrically opposite to every sentiment of honour and honesty It is not my present purpose to canvass this matter the investigation it has already gone through sufficiently evinces Mr  Bate  to be really the gentleman and the man of honour and that his greatest misfortune has been having to do with persons so totally devoid of every quality requisite to the constituting either of those charactersNothing remains to be said on this subject that can increase Mr  Bate's  merit or the infamy and disgrace of his opponents I defy either his or any other pen to add to that universal odium which they have so effectually procured to themselves and therefore I hope and doubt not Mr  Bate  will treat the letter addressed to him in a paper of this day by Mr  Croftes  with that silent contempt so justly due to it  " For where no honour's to be gain'd  " 'Tis thrown away by being maintain'd"  And as to punishing these myrmidons  A name sufficiently applicable considering the  very seasonable visit  paid Mr  B  by them  with words it is not possible we must of necessity conclude them  long since lost to every feeling of humanity or they never could with that unparalleled effrontery have made a public avowal of the scandalous and unwarrantable imposture put upon Mr  Bate  at the Turk'shead Coffeehouse for which however it seems he has an argument in store that will convince the facetious gentleman who makes his boast of it of his error  "for boys and brutes are only taught by blows"  and I make no doubt but this  doughty  gentleman's back will be found upon the application of a cane to enjoy a more delicate sensation than his heart  I am Sir Your constant reader and  A  DESPISER  of  POLTROONS  Richmond CoffeeHouse  Monday night Aug    The Paragraphs following came forth in the MORNING CHRONICLE of  Wednesday August    IT is strongly reported that a friendship which will probably be of duration has commenced between a certain foppish Knight now invested with an office of some consequence to the city of London and county of Middlesex and the fribbling parsonfearing Mr  FitzGerall  founded on a fellowfeeling for each other The Knight is beyond conception rejoiced that there is in the creation as abject a coward as himself has therefore communicated to Mr  F  his readiness to accompany the Rev Mr  Bate  to Tyburn in his public character if the said  B  should be convicted of maiming and defacing with an intention to kill before his shrievalty expires  Now we see the  denouement  of the petit piece of Vauxhall which had like to have turned out a deep Tragedy if not to the great actress to the reverend sensible and spirited actor under her and to some of the spectators we surely cannot be at a loss to determine that the Parson behaved well as a  bruiser  and defender of the fair but ill as a  parson  and lecturer of others as parsons like coblers should not go beyond their  last  or text  For if Coblerlike the Parson will fight or get drunk  Worth makes the man and want of it the fellow  The rest is all nothing but leather and Prunella  It is therefore hoped this will be a lesson to all parsons to stick to their texts and not ramble again to public places not even with gods or goddesses either of the stage pit or gallery  To the EDITOR of the MORNING POST  To the OFFICERS of MARCHINGREGIMENTS  only  GENTLEMEN  Your answering the following questions impartially will oblige the Public and it is hoped be of no prejudice to the respectable part of the army in which you serve  IF any commissioned officer whatever belonging to any of his Majesty's marching regiments had been privy to and suffered any of his acquaintance to introduce  a liveryservant under the title of  gentleman and an officer  to act as a bravo  Would the gentlemen serving in the same corps have done duty or ranked with him after such behaviour  Would they not have insisted on his being tried by a CourtMartial for ungentlemanlike behaviour  Would not all of you if you knew the man and had been informed of his having acted as above have shunned and despised him and thought it a disgrace to be seen in his company  NO SOLDIER  Aug    For the MORNING POST  A CARD  SEVERAL Gentlemen of the Army present their compliments to Capt  Crofts  the  Soldier  and  request  to know whether he really is one or not because they have heard that he was REQUESTED to leave the army for fear it should hurt his constitution But if that is as great a lie as his having any intention of fighting Mr  Bate  they now REQUEST he would  resign  as they are determined never to rank in the army with him in future  BOBADIL and Co  To the EDITOR of the MORNING POST  SIR  I HAVE sent you a SKETCH as under of a late affair which if well executed would pay the artist for his trouble and meet with a ready sale I hope therefore the PENCIL will follow the traces of the PEN

that you mean to carry a stick for the correction of Mr  FitzGerall  being naturally very humane I would entreat you to alter the  mode of your correction and instead of a stick to carry a good birch rod as I think that by much the fittest implement for Mr  FitzGerall  and what I am sure his friend Mr  Lyttleton  will recommend HE being particularly acquainted with the virtue of it as can by proved by most of the w***** on this town  I am Sir An Admirer of your Spirit LE FOUET  To the  EDITOR  of the  MORNING POST  August    SURRY to wit  SIR  IN your paper some few days since there appeared a letter under the signature of GEORGEROBERT FITZGERALL addressed to the Rev Mr HENRY BATEWe have never heard of any  such  person as GEORGEROBERT FITZGERALLif you mean GEORGEROBERT FITZGERALD who continued but a short time with us after his retreat from his apartments in the borough of Southwark  we have heard enough of  HIM  Yours c NO ASSASSIN  For the MORNING POST  A CARD  MR BATE's compliments to the EDITOR and begs leave through the channel of the  Morning Post  to inform the Public whose patience he is afraid he has already tired in this dispute that the moment Mess  Tateham  and  Dawes  come to town who were present at the dastardly meeting at the Turk's Head Coffeehouse in which the  Captains  CROFTES and FITSGERALL cut so capital a figure their distinct evidence will be given in this Paper in direct opposition to those scandalously FALSE and childish evasions made use of by the contemptible Mr  Croftes  in yesterday's  Gazetteer  Clifford'sInn  Thursday Aug    {inverted ⁂}  The impatience of the Public has been such that the publication of this pamphlet could not be retarded in order to wait for the testimony of the gentlemen mentioned in Mr  BATE  's card However as we suppose it can only be a confirmation of his own candid narrative already universally admitted the omission of it here we hope will not be judged of any very material consequence  THE END
