of the Roman pos∣session of this territory and to collect into a separate chronological class the state of regal authority therein under the Saxon heptarchy  The kingdom of  Northumberland  as established in the reign of  Aelle  compre∣hended the two British provinces of  Bernicia  and  Deira  and extended from the rivers Mersey and Humber on the south to Liddisdale Cheviot Hills and the river Tweed on the north and from east to west from the German Ocean to the Irish Channel  The etymologies given by Camden of the name of  Northumberland  are from the Saxon Norƿanhumbra ric the kingdom of Northumberland and Norƿan∣humberlond lands north of Humber  Et regiones omnes quae trans Humbrum aestuarium ad septentriones jacent Saxonico nomine Norƿan Humbra ric i e Nordanhumbrorum regnum vocari caeperunt  Camden Brit p    The provincial name of  Bernicia  the same author derives from the British appellation given to the inhabitants of Guir Brinaich Mountaineers  Inde cum regnum Berniciorum quas Brittanni GuiraBrinaich ed est quasi Montanos dicunt  Camden Brit p  The scene of my attention in this work is that part only of this extensive territory which retains the name  Northumberland  bounded towards the east by the German Ocean towards the west by the county of Cumberland to∣wards the north by the river Tweed and the shire of Roxborough and towards the south by the county palatine of Durham  This district at the time the  Romans  first entered it was inhabited by the  Otadini  towards the east and the  Gadeni  on the western and maintainous parts It is presumed these invaders had not advanced so far northward as Northum∣berland before the third year of  Agricola  's command in Britain According to Tacitus's account he came over in the character of Legate in the year when the summer was far advanced that this dignity was conferred upon him immediately after his Consulship which by the  Fasti Consulares  appears to have been in the year so that the reduction of Northumberland by the Roman ar  s happened in the year The Romans did not totally desert this island  till the middle of the fifth century and they possessed several stations is Nor∣thumberland to the last consequently their continuance there was for a series of near years  Horsley Brit Rom lib I cha  Agricola  it is well known in his recession from the business of warfare studied to introduce the Roman habit and luxury among the Britons as a good Poli∣tician conceiving that whilst these pleasures fascinated they also enervated and relaxed rendering the natives less ferocious and easier to be conciliated or sub∣dued and would also promote the future wealth of a  province  of which he had the honour to compleat the conquest by urging the inhabitants to extend their trade pleasures and luxuries introduce artificial wants which arts manufac∣tures commerce and navigation must supply  These new enjoyments were of a short existence for in the course of the fourth century after  Agricola  's command the natives were left exposed to the ravages of barbarous nations no longer kept in awe by the Roman arms  The unhappy estate of the northern inhabitants after they were totally de∣serted by the Romans is easily conceived the perils and miseries to which they were frequently exposed by the incursions of tribes of Picts and Sco  s na∣turally induces a belief that the principal part of those who were possessed of riches merchandise flocks and herds would immediately retire and seek for safer and more peaceful habitations in the southern parts of the land The ravagers still advanced and the wretchedness of the Britons was so greatly in∣creased that they were driven to seek refuge in the mountains and conceal themselves in their forests and caverns Such was the deplorable situation of the natives in the year when they implored the assistance of the  Saxons  a brave and warlike people inured to arms  Our Historians with a disgraceful partiality have stigmatized the  Saxons  with the epithets of cruelty and injustice in order to extenuate the errors of the Britons or to palliate their despicable impotence  It manifestly appears that under the protection of the Romans the Britons had sunk into supineness and depravity public virtues were extinguished and an abjectness of spirit universally prevailed They sent Embassadors to the  Saxons  thus commissioned  Most noble  Saxons  We the wretched and distressed  Britons  worn our by the constant incursions of our cruel and merciless enemies and because we have heard of the fame of those glorious victories which by your valour you have obtained therefore have we sent our humble suppliants to you to im∣plore  your kind assistance We have large and plentiful possessions abound∣ing with every necessary these with ourselves we submit to your disposal if you will generously lend us your succour against our inveterate foes Long have we enjoyed the sweets of peace under the powerful protection of the Roman arms and now we know none second in glory to them but your∣selves therefore to you we lift up our hands for assistance and in return are willing to abide whatever service you shall impose upon us  Witichindus Gest Sax lib I  Some authors say the Saxons were not invited over by the Britons but being exiled from their own country landed here But Mannius in particular does not shew any proof for this assertion from the situation of the German states in that aera  Verstigan from the authority of Pomarius says Saxons came over Hector Boethius says they were in number and were transported in ships  Why should we discredit this Historian when the former petitions made to the Roman state were equally as abject  To  Aetius  thrice Consul The groans of the  Britains  The  Barbarians  drive us to the sea the sea forces us back again upon the Barbarians in these dreadful extremities death awaits us equally on both sides either we must fall by the hands of our enemies or else be drowned in the swelling waves  The Isle of  Thanet  was allotted to these new allies and it was not long before they rendered signal services to the Britons The northern ravagers with a mighty band were advanced into Lincolnshire the  Saxons  with alacrity took the field Historians agree the victory obtained over the invaders near  Stamford  was only to be attributed to the military prowess and skilful dispositions of the  Saxons  A people recovering from a state of despair are apt to advance to excess in their love and gratitude towards their redeemers After the ravagers were thus discomfited and had retired into the north the  Saxons  were looked upon with the highest veneration and in order effectually to repress the northern nations an additional band of  Saxons  were petitioned for and a greater extent of terri∣tory granted for their residence  The Scotch writers say this reinforcement consisted of men  So happy were the Britons in their new alli∣ance that  Vortergern  their Prince espoused  Rowena  the daughter of  Hengist  the Saxon General  The circumstances evidently prove the  Saxons  were invited hither to partake the land and become settlers as it doth not appear from any admissible autho∣rity that any other gratuity  Bede  and  Ethelwerd  are silent as to any promises of submission made by the natives  Gildas  says their first pretence of quarrelling was for a greater  allowance  The expression in  Gildas  is  epimenia a Roman team for the pay of a soldier  In  Bede  it is  a  ionae  which is construed  the produce of lands pro∣visions of corn  c From thence the editor of Camden determines they were merely  mercenaries  was stipulated for their services The  Saxons  were not applied to till the country was almost totally lost or become d  sert  so that providing them settlements was giving even what the fugitive Britons could not hold The county of  Kent  was the second establishment granted to these allies  So peculiarly frail and instable by nature were the dispositions of mind pos∣sessed by the natives that no sooner were they relieved from the most abject state and deplorable calamities and distresses than in the moment of ease they began to regard those who had rescued them with jealousy to be discontented with their former resolutions to imagine future evils and to devise projects of the grossest ingratitude The heroic  Saxons  received the intelligence with contempt and looked upon the ingratitude with abhorrence The most abject mind the soonest conceives ingratitude there is a baseness and illiberality in grovelling souls which detests a sense of obligations the meanest peasant hath the most ungenerous sentiments distrust and jealousy are the issue of vicious hearts selfishness is brutal and characteristic of ignorance On the other hand hero  c minds are fired with virtues for courage and fortitude are the result of principle The angry  Saxons  no sooner beheld the instability of British faith and affection than they began to devise the means of taking the reigns of go∣vernment out of the hands of impotence The name of  King  was yet unknown among the  Saxons  who in emergencies of state chose an Heretogen or  General  who  e power and dignity subsided with the occasion of his election They knew no obligation to Sovereigns their liberty was uncontaminated with the appen∣dages of supremacy The royal dignity of  Vortergein  was by them esteemed of little importance and of much less utility  The abjectness of the Britons was despicable and the  Saxons  contemplated it with contempt The land before their arrival was ravaged by barbarous tribes even the southern provinces were desolated and the natives driven to the fo∣rests and mountains they were no longer able to retain or worthy to rule so fertile a country Such were the causes which induced the  Saxons  to devise means of g  ing the government  Authors who impeach the  Saxons  of breach of public faith overlook the terms on which they were invited hither and the indignities and injuries they sustained before they turned their arms against the natives Had they from the first intended to make themselves masters of the country it was foolishly impo∣l  to strengthen the Britons by the repulsion of the Picts and Scots The c  mm  incidents of war are shocking to humanity and horrid in their detail the  were barbarous and the dispositions of men savage the miserable scenes in the re  procation of such warfare looks terrible indeed in the narra∣tive of the Historian but men were not more peculiarly brutal and inhuman in these conflicts than in other countries in the same aera or among equally barbarous  in later centuries Authors in the warmth of accusation neglect the consideration of the advantages we finally derived from the Saxons no less than THE MAXIMS OF OUR COMMON LAW AND THE ORI∣GINAL  PRINCIPLES OF OUR INESTIMABLE CONSTITUTION If we inherit any thing from the Britons it consists of their  ferocity instability  and  ingratitude  Without the Saxon arms this island like the regions of the east would have been overrun and desolated by a banditti worse than Tartars and become a den of thieves pirates and robbers  The British Prince still lived in a state of confidence and esteem with his new ally every one but  Vortergern  could discern the countenance of amity which  Hengist  now assumed was a superficial mask which covered his resentment through which insincerity was easily discovered and that protection was at length become his most distant object The Britons conceived that from the time of  Rowena  's espousal the  Saxons  put on an insolent and contemptuous car∣riage which increased their natural jealousy against them  On the other hand the  Saxons  observed the government was involved in anarchy and confusion the British states were distracted by factions and ca∣bals and each individual overwhelmed in despondency and relaxed from all warlike disposition  Hengist  foresaw that if he should withdraw his troops this fine fertile land must become a desert under the ravages of those barbarians who were irresistible by British force the depopulation of the northern territo∣ries favoured an intention he had formed as he conceived the possession of  Northumberland  would facilitate his subjugation of the Britons In order to ef∣fect this purpose as he possessed the ear of the Prince he expatiated on the ra∣vages constantly made by the northern nations who though lately repressed were again advancing to the interior parts of the country he proposed that a reinforcement of his countrymen should be invited to settle in those desolated districts at once to subdue the ferocious bands of robbers and form a safe∣guard for the southern provinces The plausibility of the project the imbecility of  Vortergern  's political judgment the abjectness of spirit which possessed the British councils and the wretchedness of the people groaning under distress and the miseries consequent to war together with the implicit confidence with which the Prince listened to the admonitions of his confident promising a safe and indolent reign under such protection all concurred to promote the plan  Octa  the brother of  Hengist  and  Ebussa  his son after receiving the summons with the utmost alacrity prepared to collect their adherents and soon passed over from Germany with a chosen band of warlike  Saxons  taking possession of  Northumberland  in the year of our Lord  The new colony had not settled long in this district before  Hengist  no longer able to endure the indignities put upon him and his people and the infringe∣ments repeatedly made on the lands granted them on their arrival in Britain brought his troops into the field and began hostilities  Be very in the people is seldom observed under an impotent commander courage is intimately connected with confidence and where the leader doth not  possess the good opinion of his troops they act with timidity and reluctance It was the case with the Britons when  Hengist  shewed his hostile intentions and threw off disguise the subjects of  Vortergern  regarded him with shame their councils were full of confusion and they were seized with a panic almost bor∣dering upon despair the resistance they made was weak and fruitless and at length they fled before the Saxon veterans to their former places of conceal∣ment in the wildernesses and mountains  The northern band regarding  Hengiss's  proceedings as a signal for them to take the field immediately rose in arms  I should advance into too large a field should I follow the Saxon arms through all the conflicts I am confined to their northern colony and restrained within the limits of  Northumberland  must forsake a general for a partial view of their actions  Some modern authors have accused the  Northumbrian Saxons  of a confederacy with the Picts and Scots a charge I do not find supported by any valuable authority The struggles during the course of fifty years and upwards were many and various the events the Britons remained unsubdued and the Saxons unexpelled At length in the year  Ida  with twelve sons and a large reinforcement landed at Flamborough  Chron SaxEthelward Malms c  where they were received by their countrymen with acclamations of joy In a short time they drove the Britons totally from the province of  Bernicia  Inde cum regnum Berniciorum constutum esset quod a tesi ad Scoticum fretum pertigit pars ejus optima fuit paruitque Nordanhumbrorum regib  s quidum fuam periodum confecissent quicquid ultra Tuedam erat in Scoticum nomen cessit c  Camden Brit  the natives on every hand flying from their superior power  From the authority of the Scala Chronica  Scha Caron lib  it appears that after  Hengist  had settled in  Kent Octa  and his successors assumed the title of  Dukes  until the  Northumbrian Saxons  following the example of those of  Kent  elected a Sovereign who yet remained subject to the supreme authority of the Kentish King They are named in the following order  Hiring  that begat  Wodnam  that begat  Wite∣glas  of whom came  H  rs  the King that begat  Uppa  that begat  Heppa  that begat  Hermeger  that begat  Bernack  all which were before the noble King  Ida  and the gestes of them before  Ida  be little known by chroniques  The above account stands alone and unsupported our best authorities all concurring that  Ida  was the first who assumed the name of King over the Northrumbrian colony  The success and safety of the colony being chiefly derived from  Ida  no doubt influenced the people to give him the name of King and from the power of the Hererogen to advance him to that of Sovereignty What induced the Saxons to forsake their old constitutional maxims and give  Ida  this new authority ancient authors by their silence leave us only conjectures It is probable they were desirous of imitating the British customs in order to conci∣liate the natives to their government  IDA having ascended the throne of  Bernicia  made  Beddanborough  Now called Bambrough  the place of his residence By some he is supposed to be the original founder of the castle by others that he repaired and enlarged the outworks and having removed the palisadoes enclosed the whole with a wall  Chron Sax Ethelwerd Malms Huntington c  all authors agree that it was his chief fortress He held his crown independent of Kent or any other Potentate of the heptarchy His reign was full of warfare for the Britons were conti∣nually harrassing his frontiers issuing from their places of concealment when an opportunity offered to distress the  Saxons Ida  reigned twelve years during which time the Britons never gained any considerable advantage against his people  He had issue by his Queen six sons  Adda Ethelric Theodoric Edric Osmer  and  Theofredum  and by his Concubines six  Alric Ogga Ecca Osbald Segora  Duodecem namque filios

Bernicia  in the year of our Lord and reigned seven years during which period  Aelle  one of the Chieftains who came over with  Ida  by some said to be his nephew conducted the Saxons against the province of  Deira  from whence having expelled the Britons he assumed the sovereignty thereof and settled there with his adherents  GLAPPA a kinsman of  Ida  succeeded to the scepter of  Bernicia  in the year he lived to reign only five years and of his actions Historians are silent In his advance∣ment to the throne we see an example of the ancient elective power of the  Saxons who regarded not any pretensions to hereditary right as there were living at that time many of the sons of  Ida  THEODWALD brother to  Glappa  ascended the throne in the year and reigned but one year of his transactions Historians are silent He was succeeded by FRETHULF a second brother to  Glappa  who assumed the scepter in the year and reigned seven years Of the transactions of the northern Saxons in this period Historians are silent  Math Westm  On his demise THEODORIC the third son of  Ida  ascended the throne and reigned seven years Here we have a second example of the elective power being retained and one more striking than the former as therein was a preference of  Theodoric  to his elder brother  Ethelric  who was then living Of the transactions of this reign Histo∣rians are silent  AELLE who had reigned in the province of  Deira  with great reputation for twentyseven years on the death of  Theodoric  was elected to the sovereignty of  Bernicia  the two provinces under him thus becoming united obtained the name of  the kingdom of Northumberland  As by his valour and sage conduct he had secured his territories whilst King of  Deira  so the united provinces under his govern∣ment enjoyed an uninterrupted peace His reign as King of  Northumberland  commenced in the year and continued only three years He had issue  Edwine  who rose to the throne of  Northumberland  and  Acca  who was the Queen of  Ethelfrith  Ibid  After the death of  Aelle  ETHELRIC the second son of  Ida  succeeded to the sovereignty of the united provinces in the year he had spent the greatest part of his life in retirement and was not called forth to rule before he was far advanced in years He reigned five years in uninterrupted peace and left issue two sons  Ethelfrith  who succeeded to the scepter and  Tedbald  who in his brother's reign was slain in a battle against the Scots at a place called  Daegstane  Chron Sax Malms Hunt c  ETHELFRITH who from his disposition was

his territories and acquired much honour his arms were deemed irre∣sistible and many of the natives submitted themselves to his government He is said to have extended his conquests further and reaped more laurels than any of his predecessors  Bede lib I H Hunt lib II  As his fame increased and his dominions were enlarged his neighbours the  Scots  began to look on him with a jealous eye and regard his power as advanc∣ing to too great eminence for their security they seized the first plausible pre∣text for drawing their forces into the field and led on by  Aegthan  their King approached the frontiers and prepared to give the  Saxons  battle  Ethelfrith  with all his powers met them at a place called  Daegstane  where after a bloody conflict victory declared for the  Saxons  The  Scots  sustained so great a loss that they were rendered incapable of renewing the war for a considerable time The joy of victory was greatly damped by the death of the King's brother  Tedbald  a heroic youth who commanded a large body of  Saxons  in the engagement  Perceiving the  Scots  for four years after this signal victory shewed no hostile intentions in the year he carried his arms against the  Britons  who were again harrassing the borders of his dominions a battle was fought near  Caerleon  where he overthrew his adversaries with a mighty slaughter As the armies prepared to engage the  Saxon  King perceiving a great assembly of religious putting up their fervent prayers for the Britons and esteeming them as essen∣tial enemies as those who bore arms against him gave orders for their destruc∣tion and stained his arms with the infamous slaughter of twelve hundred naked and defenceless men Monks of the monastery of  Bangor  fifty only of the whole religious assembly surviving who saved themselves by flight  Bede Chron Sax  His important conquests made him so much the terror of the adjoining states that he remained for some time undisturbed During the interval of peace he regarded with a jealous eye the growing virtues of  Edwine  the brother of his Queen and observed his increasing popularity with so much anxiety that at length he meditated his death presuming that was the only means to secure the province of  Deira  to his crown as  Edwine  had a natural claim thereto The young Prince either from a change in the King's conduct towards him or by some intimations of the danger he was in thought it expedient to fly from the dominions of  Ethelfrith  and seek refuge in the court of  Redwald  King of the East Angles  Ethelfrith  disappointed in his project burnt with resentment against  Red∣wald  and immediately sent messengers to demand the fugitive to be delivered up as a traitor or on refusal to denounce war against the state  Redwald  con∣sidering  the power of the Northumbrian King would have resigned the Prince but through the entreaties of his Queen who represented in the most forcible language the disgrace such an action would bring upon him and prevailed with him not only to continue the protection he had heretofore granted but also to levy an army and instantly march against  Northumberland  to reprehend the imperious Prince for his insolence  These measures were pursued with such expedition that  Redwald  with his army was on the frontiers before the Northumbrian Monarch received the re∣turning Embassadors Alarmed at the sudden danger he raised such forces as the emergency allowed means to collect and hastily advanced to stop the rapid progress of his enemies The armies joined battle on the banks of the river  Idle  near to  Nottingham  where  Ethelfrith  was slain and his forces were routed This victory though eminently fortunate for  Edwine  as it opened his accession to the throne was unhappy to  Redwald  whose glory was pur∣chased by the death of his son  Regenhere  The sons of  Ethelfrith  hearing of this great overthrow and the death of their father fled the kingdom in terror of the wrath of  Edwine  leaving him no com∣petitor for the crown  Ethelfrith  reigned twentyfour years He left issue by his Queen seven sons  Eanfred Oswald Oswine Oslac Oswid Ossa  and  Offa  also two daughters  Oswitha  and  Ebba  who were canonized  Ma  W  m  By a concubine he had one son named  Oswe    Speed  EDWINE supported by the arms of  Redwald  entered the capital of  Northumberland  and in the year assumed the  Diadem  having just attained his age of twentythree years he possessed a noble and intrepid spirit and conducted his military operations with that skill and fortitude that in a short time he not only re∣lieved the frontiers of his kingdom from the intrusions of the adjoining nations but extended his dominions by conquest even as far as the  Orchades  and  Meva∣man Islands  now called the  Hebrides  Bede's Eccles Hist lib II Malms lib I  His wife  Cwenburga  the daughter of  Ceorl  King of  Mercia  did not live to see him mount the throne He had not been settled thereon above eight years when he thought of a second espousal the eminent virtues and beauty of  Ethel∣burga  daughter of the King of  Kent  had reached his ear and he sent Embas∣sador  to require her in marriage She had embraced the Christian faith but he still retained his national principles so that conditions were stipulated for the free exercise of her religion and that she should retain the necessary ministers to officiate therein These preliminaries being settled the marriage was cele∣brated  the year  At this time  Cwichelm  in conjunction with his father  Cynegils  ruled over the kingdom of  Wessex  a Prince of a dark and jealous mind who had regarded the growing power and exalted glory of  Edwine  with envy and conceiving his intrepid spirit might induce him to disturb the lesser kingdoms of the heptar∣chy of which  Wessex  was then one of the weakest he determined to take  Edwine  off by treachery and by assassination to remove the object of his terror and envy for this purpose he employed one  Eumer  of whom Historians have retained nothing previous to this plot  Edwine  's court being then held on the banks of Derwent the assassin approached him in the character of an Embas∣sador and being admitted to audience as he was delivering a feigned address the specious purport of which claimed the King's particular attention the vil∣lain suddenly drew a poisoned dagger from under his cloak and attempted to plunge it in  Edwine  's bosom but  Lilla  a faithful servant of the King seeing his danger instantly rushed forward and in his loyal breast received the fatal blow designed upon his Sovereign With such resolution the pass was made that the poinard pierced through the body of  Lilla  and wounded the King The desperate assassin surrounded by the King's guards was cut to pieces but not before he had slain another of the attendants in his resolute defence  Bede  The wound the King received was of little consequence in the end though at the instant from the poison of the weapon alarming This was a proper occasion for  Paulinus  who was one of the Queen's ministers to exhort the King to renounce the errors of his religion the pious example and love of  Ethelburga  contributed to move his mind and render him more susceptible of the arguments which were used for his conversion at length with the solem∣nity of a vow he declared  That if the Deity which the Christians served and whom they called the God of Justice would enable him to punish this violator of the laws of nature nations and kings who had sent forth unprovoked the murderer against him he would from thenceforth confess his divinity and worship none other Gods but him  As a pledge of his vow he delivered into the hands of  Pau∣linus  his infant daughter  Eanfled  who was brought into the world the evening of the day on which the horrid attempt was made against his life to be bap∣tized  Bede lib IShe was the first Christian baptized in Northumberland  As soon as his health permitted he arrayed his troops and went forth against the  West Saxons  whom he overthrew in his first battle and put to the sword all those who had devised his death by  Eumer  the assassin  Historians do not mention whether he made any political advantages to his kingdom by this war or sat down satisfied with the issue of his revenge  In the succeeding year A D with great solemnity and pomp during the festival of Easter he embraced the christian faith and was baptized by the hands of  Paulinus  multitudes of his subjects following his pious example  Bede Chron Sax  Such was the excellence of his government that acts of injustice were sel∣dom heard of among his subjects national enemies forbore to provoke his arms and an uninterrupted peace blessed his people for several years During this interval the internal policy was his chief object the roads were rendered safe and commodious and even so minutely that every spring by the way side was preserved and provided with a dish for the refreshment of travellers He frequently perambulated the provinces of his kingdom putting salutary laws in execution and dispensing justice so that no injured person lingered long with∣out redress  Bede  Penda  the King of the  Mercians

Caswallon  King of  Cumberland  a tributary British Prince who ruled over one of the districts sub∣dued by  Edwine  and under promise of joining him with all his forces induced  Cedwell  to shake off his allegiance The restless Britons were easily provoked to insurrection against their conquerors and the infatuating name of  Liberty  fired them with enthusiasm though its possession was impossible and the shaking off subjection to  Edwine  could only give commencement to a subjuga∣tion by some less worthy ruler and a vassalage more severe  Cedwell  calling to arms all those whom the name of Freedom could animate or delude took the field and began with cruelty and devastation to make his progress in the fron∣tier districts  Edwine  prepared to oppose the rebels whilst  Penda  in consequence of his compact joined his forces with the Britons and at a place called  Hethfield  waited the approach of the Northumbrians to give them battle  The conflict was dreadful  Edwine  and his eldest son  Osfrid  with many chiefs were slain the loss of their leaders struck the army with a panic and they turned their backs upon the invaders Victory dipt her wings in blood the pur∣suit was prosecuted with the utmost cruelty  In Case Edwine's first wife was the granddaughter of Crida as Malms Hunt and others alledge  P  nda was ma  g  r against his brotherinlaw  Egfrid  another of

Paulinus  under the care of  Bassus  a faith∣ful chief fled by sea to the kingdom of  Kent  then governed by  Eadbald  the brother of  Ethelburga  She founded a Monastery at a place called Lymming on the happy shore where she found refuge and therein spent the remainder of her life in acts of piety  Edwine  was slain in the month of October A D in the th year of his age having reigned sixteen years By  Cwenburga  his first wife he had issue two sons  Osfrid  and  Egfrid  who both fell in the fatal battle of  Hethfield  By  Ethelburga  he had issue two sons and two daughters  Ethelm  the eldest died in his youth  Ulkfren  was sent by his mother to the court of France where he died  Enfleda  the firstborn whose nativity was singularly marked by the day of  Edwine  's assassination became the Queen of  Oswy  King of  Northumberland Ethelrida  the youngest daughter died in her infancy  The calamities of the Northumbrians did not cease till the inhuman ravagers withdrew their forces covered with blood and overloaden with spoils On their retreat  Eanfrid  the eldest son of  Ethelfrith  and  Osric  the son of  Elfric  and uncle of  Edwine  came from their retreat in Scotland and EANFRID assumed the reigns of government in the year in the province of  Bernicia  and OSRIC in the province of  Deira  During the time  Eanfrid  and  Osric  resided among the Scots they had be∣come Christians but no sooner were they settled on their respective thrones than they renounced their new religion persecuted the Christians and conse∣crated altars and high places to the old idolatry of the Saxons  Cedwell  though not able to retain the great territories he had subdued or rather ravaged assisted by the Mercian arms was yet jealous of the recovery of those states and holding an inviolable inveteracy against the Saxon name levied a great army and entered the province of  Deira  Some authors would cover the infamous actions of the Briton with the delusive countenance of re∣ligious zeal and insinuate that his wrath against these Princes was kindled by their apostacy but his actions prove the principles by which he was agitated  Osric  not able to oppose the torrent was slain his city  The corruption of the name Durham from Deiraham is so easily conceived that it renders the conjecture probable this was the capital of Deira In the neighbourhood of that city is a place called Old Durham the reason of which name I cannot more plausibly attribute than to the Deiraham of the Saxons  was sacked and his subjects were plundered  The victorious tyrant overran  Deira  not like a  generous warrior who amidst his conquests would remember mercy but like a ruthless savage whose sole delight was blood and carnage  Strutt's Chron p    Such is the character drawn by a modern writer of this British hero in the midst of his glory contrary indeed to the general bias of his pen  Eanfrid  terrified at the horrid massacre committed in the adjoining province and unable in the feeble state of his new empire to raise forces to oppose the progress of the tyrant who came upon him like the whirlwind with destruction in its wings he determined to approach  Cedwell  with submission and taking only twelve soldiers with him as a guard he entered the Britons camp un∣armed and bent himself at the tyrant's feet but unmoved with the humiliation of a King uninfluenced by justice clemency and mercy and against the com∣mon faith of nations even among savages he rejoiced himself in the slaughter of those who kneeled for his protection  Bede Eccl Hist  I would instantly turn from the name of this detested savage did not the accession of the glorious  Oswald  render it necessary to be retained to distinguish the following reign  The inhabitants would have continued to fly before  Cedwell  and in the end have totally deserted the country had not OSWALD the son of  Ethelfrith  and brother of  Eanfrid  stepped forth from the place of his retirement to head the disconcerted Northumbrians The attempt was ar∣duous and few could be brought to enlist under a banner which was displayed even by the very hands of despair for so powerful was the British tyrant and so tremendous in his cruelties that few could be found who had courage to withstand him  Oswald  possessed an excellent knowledge of the art of war which he had made his study as a science he had gathered together a select band and in a fortified situation waited the approach of  Cedwell  who fell in the conflict and his army was totally routed  A more particular account of this battle see title St Oswald's p  The Northumbrians thus relieved from a savage enemy raised  Oswald  to the throne in the year with joyful acclamations a jealousy which reigned between the provinces of  Deira  and  Bernicia  he conciliated and made them equally happy under his wise government When peace was restored he em∣ployed himself in reforming the manners of his subjects and most especially he laboured in their conversion to Christianity He sent for a teacher from the religious seminary of  Mailross  to preach to his people and founded the Episco∣pacy of  Lindi  farn  as is treated of at large in the course of the following work  The glory of his arms was not more eminent than the fame of his wisdom his lenity and benevolence were in that age proverbial the neighbouring na∣tions regarded him with reverence and his people obeyed him with love  These excellencies together with the fate of  Cedwell  irritated the wicked heart of  Penda  the Mercian and he levied an army to make war upon  Northum∣berland Oswald  being informed of these military preparations with alacrity collected his troops and met his adversary at  Maserfield  in  Shropshire  on the th day of August where after a long and bloody conflict victory de∣clared for  Penda Oswald  being among the slain The inhuman conqueror caused the limbs of the deceased King after being horridly mangled to be sus∣pended on a pole like a common traitor or infamous malefactor which caused the name of  Maserfield  to be changed to that of  Oswald's Tree  After the departure of Penda the remains of Oswald at the command of Osfrida Penda's Queen and daughter of Oswine were carefully taken away from the field of battle and interred in the mo∣nastery of Bradney in Lincolnshire but were afterwards removed to Gloucester and interred on the north side of the choir of the cathedral church there  Bede lib III  "Cujus vitam cum multa laude venerabilis Beda prosecutus esset "ut multa inquit breviter

 whom he married in the third year of his reign he had an only child a son named  Ethelwald  OSWEO the son of  Ethelfrith  by his concubine surnamed the  Fierce  mounted the throne of  Bernicia  in the year whilst  Oswin  the son of  Osric  the last King of  Deira  seized the scepter of that province  OSWINE of a mild disposition governed his subjects with lenity and contenting himself with his own dominions sought only to preserve peace to his subjects  Osweo  of a turbulent and ambitious temper eager for extent of dominion and impa∣tient of a rivalship in empire sought frequent occasions to disturb  Oswin  and at length an open rupture took place Both Kings took the field but  Osweo  's military disposition and passion for arms had occasioned him to train and disci∣pline his troops even in times of peace whilst  Oswin  supinely negligent of all such measures only cultivated those arts among his people which flourished under the auspices of peace  Osweo  's army was abundantly more numerous and better arrayed than the forces of  Oswin  when this was made known to him willing to spare the effusion of blood he declined coming to an engage∣ment and when his people urged him to try the event of battle he retired from the army and concealed himself in the house of one  Humwald  his friend where he conceived he might abide in safety and clude the search of his subjects  The army of  Deira  forsaken of their leader disbanded themselves and re∣tired leaving the country open to be possessed by  Osweo Humwald  with whom  Oswin  was in concealment in hope of reward from  Osweo  betrayed his trust and delivered up the fugitive King who was immediately put to death This tragical event happened on the d day of September A D in the ninth year of  Oswin  's reign  When  Osweo  had thus removed the obstacle which prevented his uniting the two provinces he took possession of  Deira  but his government had not been established above two years before  Ethelwald  the son of  Oswald  appeared having attained the age of years and taking possession of the malecontents in  Deira  declared himself a competitor for that crown against his uncle The people of the province were glad to embrace an opportunity of shaking off the detestable yoke  Osweo  had subjected them to as they regarded the man with inveteracy who had polluted his hands in the innocent blood of  Oswin  whose memory they revered  Osweo  with all his power was not able to dispossess him though re∣peated struggles were made which constantly concluded in  Ethelwald  's favour  But these matters were scarce ended or  Osweo  had reconciled himself to sit down contented with the loss of the province of  Deira  before  Penda  renewed hostilities against the Northrumbrians in  Bernicia  and  Osweo  by the invader's success was soon reduced to extremities The offers of peace which he made were rejected for nothing but destruction and extent of empire could satisfy the Mercian  Ethelwald  also brought his forces into the field professing himself  Penda  's ally The desperate circumstances which attended  Osweo  urged him in the moments of despair to try the event of battle for in submission he saw certain destruction awaited him He collected a few faithful troops in whom he could place his confidence and together with his son  Al  fred  led forth the little army trusting only for success in  Him  in whose hand alone is the event of war The month of December was already advanced when near to  Loidis  according to Camden now  Leeds  on the banks of the river then called  Winwed  the armies engaged during the heat of the battle a sudden inundation happened the river  overflowed its banks and swept away mulitudes of the Mercian troops The circumstance struck the armies with dismay the Mercians were thrown into confusion  Penda  was slain and the  Bernicians  triumphed against an host of foes who were said to exceed them thirty times in number  Ethelwald  escaped and returned to his capital with disgrace  Bede lib III  Osweo  pursued his success and subjugated the kingdom of  Mercia  He en∣tertained  Peada  the son of  Penda  with great friendship and discovering in him singular virtues on his consenting to become a Christian gave him his daughter  Alofleda  whom he had by his concubine in marriage resigning to him the government of the southern parts of  Mercia  The blood of  Oswin  continually hung upon his conscience to expiate which he vowed to make a pilgrimage to Rome but falling sick Death fru∣strated his project He reigned years and departed this life on the th day of February in the year aged years  Historians are silent as to the fate of  Ethelwald  it is probable that he was deposed by  Osweo  after the battle of  Loidis  and  Deira  again united with  Ber∣nicia  for such union appears upon the opening of the succeeding reign  Osweo  had by  Eanfled  his Queen two sons and one daughter  Egfrid  his eldest son succeeded to his crown  Elswin  the youngest only lived to the age of being slain in battle  Elfleda  his daughter in consequence of her father's vow before the battle with  Penda  took on her the veil and was accordingly com∣mitted to the care of the Abbess  Hilda  in the monastery of  Stainslatch  now  Whitby  where she succeeded to be Abbess  Eanfled  after  Osweo  's decease retired to the same monastery where she spent the remainder of her life and where were interred her remains with those of  Osweo  and  Elfleda  Osweo  had by his concubines two children  Alcfrid  who succeeded his bro∣ther  Egfrid  on the throne and  Alkfleda  who was married to  Peada Penda  's son  EGFRID being released from his confinement in  Mercia  where he was held as an hos∣tage returned with his father's victorious army to  Northumberland  and on the decease of  Osweo  ascended the throne in the year and in the th year of his age ruling over the united provinces  From his turbulent disposition a war broke out between the Northumbrians and Mercians which was so far fruitless that by the interposition of  Theodore  the  Bishop peace was made without either party making any acquisitions through the bloodshed they had occasioned for on the borders of Trent the armies came to an engagement in which  Elfwin  the Northumbrian King's brother with many other valiant chiefs and vast hosts were slain  Elfwin  was equally lamented by both nations as well for his excellent qualities as his alliance with both Princes he having married  Osfrida  the sister of the King of  Mercia  Egfrid  not satisfied to reign in peace in the year sent his forces against the  Irish  who were represented by Bede as a mild and inoffensive people con∣stantly desirous of maintaining peace with Britain In this expedition much slaughter ensued from whence the character of  Egfrid  became odious  Restless and disposed to mischief he turned his arms against the  Picts  who bordered on  Northumberland  contrary to the earnest solicitations of  Cuthbert  then Bishop of  Lindisfern  and marching into their country in the month of June he fell into a defile among the mountains where the enemy lay in ambush and was slain  Bede lib IV  At Rex E  gfridus

the united States of the  Heptarchy  The modes of government being settled and each province recon∣ciled to his authority he disbanded his army and during seven years peace promoted the cultivation of those arts and sciences which should increase the general happiness and wealth of his people  In the thirtysecond year of this reign the  Danes  made their first descent upon this island To trace all the ravages those Barbarians  committed would lead to descriptions tedious and painful many parts of  Northumberland  retain memorials of their hostilities and such in the course of this work will necessarily be attended to  It appears that under  Alfred  the  Danes  held the sole possession of  Northumberland  but whether as tributaries or conquerors is not clearly ascertained  Alfredus postea Danis permisit quos Athelstanus pauculos post annos exturbavit  Camden Brit  Athelstan  obtained many signal victories over them and at length effected their expulsion from this territory  From this period we find the government of Northumberland reposed in nominees of the Crown who assumed the titles of Earls of Northum∣berland many of whom are named by our Historians and their pe∣culiar actions so far as they are relative to the immediate objects of my attention in this work are recounted  Amongst whom these are reckoned up in order in our historiesOsulfe Oslake Edulph Waldeof the Elder Uchtred Adulph Alred Siward Tostie Edwin Morcar Osculph and that right valiant Siward as he lived in arms so would he die armedThen this earl∣dom and these parts were given unto Tostie the brother of Earl Harold but the earldoms of Northampton and Huntingdon with other lands of his were assigned to the noble Earl Waldeof his son and heir I will add what I have read in an old manuscript in the library of John Stowe an Antiquary of the city of LondonCopso being made Earl of Northum∣berland by William the Conqueror expelled Osculph who soon after flew him Osculph did not long survive this revenge he being killed by a javelin from the hands of a robber After this Gospatrick purchased this earldom of the Conqueror but was soon after deposed Waldeof the son of Siward succeeded him and he in a short time lost his head Then Walcher Bishop of Durham had the earldom and was slain at a riotous assembly of the people Ro∣bert Mowbray attained these honours which he forfeited by treasonable attempts to depose King William Rufus in favour of Stephen Earl of Albemarle King Stephen gave this earl∣dom to Henry son of David the Scotch King and William his son afterwards King of Scotland assumed the title claiming it from his mother of the family of Earls Warren as appears by the book of Brinkburn Abbey After some time elapsed Richard the First sold this earldom to Hugh Pudsey Bishop of Durham for life ceriding him in his title as having transmigrated an old Bishop into a young Earl But when the King was a prisoner to the Emperor in his return from the Holy Land Hugh having contributed for his ransom only pounds of silver which the King resenting esteeming it but a trifling sum for one who had amassed immense riches he divested him of this dignity after which time the title of Earldom of Northumberland lay dormant about years At length it was revived in the family of Piercys  Camden Brit  In this county innumerable monuments of antiquity and natural beau∣ties exist to excite a traveller's curiosity The possession of the Romans and in after times the conflicts with the Saxons Danes and Scots  render it truly historical groundMany of the present inhabitants are derived from a race of heroes who purchased immortal honours in the annals of their country  On this tour I visited ALDSTON in the county of Cumberland to have access to Northumberland at the southwest point  ALDSTON  is a small market town meanly built hanging on the declivity of a steep hill inhabited by miners The fatigue of passing bad roads in a mountainous barren and inhospitable country was in no wise alle∣viated by the scene which presented itself here Pent in a narrow val∣ley over which mountains frowned with a melancholy sterility and nakedness the wind tempestuous impending clouds stretching forth a dark and disconsolate curtain over the face of morning rain beating vehemently against the windows which were not able to resist the storm a few trees standing near the Inn tossed by the heavy blasts which howled down the valley whilst the accommodations within doors were even comfortless rendered such a frontispiece to a pursuit of pleasure as would have given a check to any thing but insatiable curiosity  We were under the influence of the highest lands in this part of the island and could not avail ourselves of the name of summer against such a climate for I presume two fair days together are seldom known in this country  We passed over the south branch of the river Tyne by a stone bridge and entered the county of Northumberland on the Maiden Way a Roman military road near  WHITLEY  which bears at present the name of WHITLEY CASTLE though only the remains of the Roman station called in Dean Gales Antoninus  Alione  H  er p  situate on the brook of Gilderdale the southern boundary of this part of Northumberland  Whitley lays on an irregular descent inclining to the east is an ob∣long square with obtuse angles paces from east to west and from north to south the ground falls swiftly from the eastern side of this station but to the west the hills over look it from whence it was easily assailedIn order to fortify it on this weak quarter it is slanked on the northwest and southwest angles with several trenches and breastworks of earth and on the west with seven several trenches and breastworks running out to a kind of semicircle the entrance is on the south As a sketch of Whitley will give the reader a general idea of those stations I visited in this county I have subjoined an Etching  It is  Mr H  rsley should represent this station so all in his platesit is delineated as being  to the no  nded by three trenches and v  lums or rampiers and on all the  by four with an e  ance on each side  The Maiden Way before spoken of extends from a small fort called Maiden Castle on Stainmore by Kirby Thore in Westmoreland and Whitley to Caer Voran in this county guarded by a chain of stations This military road was repaired by part of the twentieth legion as is denoted by a centurial stone discovered thereon inscribed VEXILLATIO  LEGIONIS VICESIMAE V V REFICIT  CXI  Vexillatio legionis vicesimae valentis victricis refecit  This and the three following belong to the Roman station which has been at Whitley Castle near Kirkhaugh in the southwest corner of the county of Northumberland It is only the old Roman station that goes by the name of the Castle This station is upon the military way usually called the maiden way and this inscription is in the custody of Mr Henry Wallace of Whitley the proprietor of the ground in which the station has been The stone is manifestly of that sort that are usually inserted in the face of the walls or other works built or rebuilt by the soldiers and nothing more can be inferred from this inscription but that a vexillation of the th legion had rebuilt this station or somewhat about it  Horsley p  The Notitia places at Alione the third cohort of the Nervii In Mr Horsley's B Romana  CXII  Maximo Germanico pontifici maximo tribunitiae potestatis decimum nonum consuli quartum patri patriaemilites cohortis tertiae nerviorum  This inscription is in a house that stands just at the south entry of the station and is called Castle Nook It is a great pity it should be so imperfect and broken since probably it has been much of the same nature with that of which Camden has given us the original and which I shall next describe I have set the reading under this inscription which I take to be right I know not whether the character like a Greek Φ in the third line be only an ornamental stop or designed for Pio or that the P has been effaced and this put only for  accord∣ing to the like contraction in the inscription now in the library at Edinburgh Nor am I able to determine whether the first letters in the th line can have been P R for Proconsul a title that Caracalla also assumed or for Praefectus the name of the commander having been at the end of the preceding line  Horsley p  we find two altars inscribed to the Emperor Caracalla which prove this matter It is contended by some that Alione was held up and garrisoned by the Romans to the latest date of their abode in this country This was a wretched place for the subsistence of a cohort cultivation even in this age has only crept down the skirts of the valleys and hung upon the margins of the rivers even where her steps have imprinted the narrow shores corn has not hitherto blessed the labour of the husbandman  Mr Camden says that  Whitley Castle retained the marks of a great and antient town enclosed towards the north with a fourfold rampier  This description convinces me Camden never visited the place it is so inconsistent with the true state of it He gives us one of the inscriptions discovered there in the following form being one of those in Mr Horsley's B Romana  IMP CAES  Lucii Septimi Severi Ara  BICI ADIABENICI PARTHICI  MAX FIL DIVI ANTONINI Pii  Germanici

posuit  Sir Robert Cotton would doubtless have procured and removed this stone if possible what∣ever  now become of it for it is not to be seen at Conington There is yet remaining at App  eby in Westmoreland what I at first supposed had been the original There is at this place another copy or two cut out as this on stone the originals of which I know are at Con  ngton which increases my jealousy about this as does likewise a memorandum at the bottom of the stone on which this inscription is cut namely  de Astonmore  signifying the p  ace from whence it came which is undoubtedly modern though this might be added when the stone was removed to Appleby and so the Roman inscription notwithstanding be gen  ne However from this and Camden  s copy diligently compared I have given such a reading to it as appeared to me the most probable Camden tells us "that the inscription was imperfect and compendiously written with the letters linked one in another" yet he has given it only in plain Roman capitals but by the help of the stone at Appleby I have brought it nearer to the true form The inscription is manifestly to Caracalla and the titles given to his predecessors are agreeable to the Roman history All that Camden says in relation to it by way of explication is "that the third cohort of the Nervii built a temple here to Antoninus the Emperor the son of Severus"But in order to make some se  e of the latter part of the inscription we must consider it more nicely In the ninth line there have been most probably some numeral letters after IMP and more after TR POT and these may be determined by consulting history and the inscriptions on coins in order to know how oft he en  oyed the tribunitial power and been saluted Imperator when he was the fourth time Consul which was the second year after his father's death and his leaving Britain I find one Roman coin which seems to determine the whole in which we have TR P XVI IMP II COS IIII so that the ninth line has probably been the like as above 'Tis true he had often during the same consulate the tribunitial power and was oftener saluted Imperator but the vacant spaces seem not to admit any larger numbers The P P at the end of the line is  Patri Patriae  In the next line I apprehend there is only an X wanting before Voto thus AED EX VOTO  adem ex Voto  c PR PR for Propraetor seems also to be effaced in the last line but one But I am apt to think there has been nothing more in the last line and that no letters are wanting between the M and G though so represented in Camden as if there were and that we are to read  Genio Romae Posuit  So that if this temple has been erected to Caracalla it has been dedicated to him as the Genius of Rome or of the Roman people a flattering compliment too often paid by the Roman people to their Emperors Perhaps the name of the Propraetor has been designedly struck out but who he was cannot be known from any other inscriptions and as for the Roman historians they are entirely silent with respect to any affairs in Britain at this time and for a great while after To remove the difficulty that may seem to arise from Caracalla's being called the grandson of M Aurelius Antoninus to whom his father Severus was no ways related nor ever adopted by him it may not be amiss to repeat what I observed before from X  philine "that after the death of Albinus Severus called himself the son of Marcus and brother of Commodus hence his son Caracalla is called the grandson of Marcus Antoninus But there is another difficulty in the words of the inscription and that is how Caracalla could be adnepos or atnepos both to Trajan and Nerva for if he was so to the former as the regular series of the preceding Emperors requires he must have been trinepos to Nerva Perhaps therefore the word et in the sixth line should be fil and we ought to read  Divi Tra∣jani Parthici filii divi Nervae adnepoti  This will make the genealogy consistent and the manner of expression is not improper and in effect the same as  Trajani adnepoti Nervae tri∣nepoti  " This inscription was erected in the year when Caracalla was the fourth time Consul I have described and explained it next to number CXII because I think these two are somewhat of a like nature  Horsley p  IMP CAES LV  BIG ADIA  M  FIL  V ANTONINI  SARM  P  V  TONI P  ON  DIVI HA  AB NEP  V TRAIA  N    PARTH ET  V N  DNEP

edifice  On the opposite side of the Tyne as we passed down the valley we had a view of KIRKHAUGH When Mr Horsley visited the place he found in the churchyard a Roman altar inscribed DEAE MINERVAE  ET HERCVLI VICTORI  CXIV  D  Minervae et Herculi victori  This altar is now in the churchyard of Kirkhaugh 'Tis erected to Minerva and Hercules Victor but by whom or on what occasion does not appear The Greek writers call those de  es who were worshipped together at the same altar  and these two Minerva and Hercules might perhaps be joined on this altar to intimate that the Roman arms were conducted with equal skill and fortitude  Horsley p  but on enquiry we were informed it was lately removed  We passed down the vale a wild and uncultivated scene till we ap∣proached  KNARESDALE  where some narrow inclosures by the brink of the river cheered the eye which for some miles had laboured over a sameness of unpleasing objects with languor Here the meads and some little woods which hang upon the declivities were contrasted by the brown heath and grey rocks of the mountains and made the landskip picturesque  As I now leave the Maiden Way or Roman military road and found in this uncultivated country the most perfect remains I ever saw to give the reader a general idea it may not be improper to introduce a description of this as it is to be presumed all the Roman roads bore a similarity thereto in their construction though not in their breadth The Maiden Way  In the Gentleman's Magazine of the year the origin of the name  Maiden Way  is learned∣ly defined by the great antiquary Mr Pegg  under his feigned signiture of P Gemsege particularly he says  to  que a conjecture upon a p  so obscure perhaps it may come from the British word  a  p  er  or beautiful hence possibly may come the Anglo Saxon word Mai  o and Ma  en  virgo  which in that case answers exactly to our present expressions  a fair one  and  a sense undoubtedly very well accommodated to all the three places  h to the road and the two fortifications  Maiden Castle Maiden Way and Maiden Hold  is near six yards wide the sides are formed by lines of very large pebbles from whence in an easy bow the interior pavement rises to a crown Where the road lays down steep descents the pavement is formed of flat thin stones placed on their edges and laid transversely It passes many brooks and I examined whether any bridges of mason work had been thrown over them but could find no remains of such which leads me to deter∣mine that these places were passed by means of platforms formed of  timber or trunks of trees The rocks to which the pavement adjoined would certainly have retained some testimony of mason work if any had been used  KNARESDALE HALL  is ruinous and neglected It was the seat of one of the Prats in the reign of Edward I who forfeited the same after which it was granted to Sir Robert de Swinburn it came to Wallace of Copeland Castle by marriage of Eleanor second daughter of John Swinburn of Edlingham and Ralph Wallace his descendant sold it to Mr Alderman Stephenson of Newcastle upon Tyne  We passed by a stone bridge over the river Tyne below Knaresdale and from the opposite heights had a view of  LAMBLEY  now consisting of a small chapel with a few scattered cottages Here was formerly a house founded for Benedictine Nuns dedicated to God St Mary and St Patrick Authors differ touching the foundation Speed and Camden attribute it to the Lucys Tanner to Adam de Tyne∣dale and others to King John By deed of confirmation of the second year of King John  Johannes Dei gratia c Dat per Manum S Wellensis Archidiaconi apud Hextoldesham XIV die Februarii regni nostri anno Secundo  certain endowments made by Adam de Tynedale and others of that family were confirmed to this religious house At the suppression it consisted of six Nuns and was valued at l s d The scite of the convent is not now to be discovered in Camden's day  it was for the most part undermined by the floodings of the Tyne and fallen down  John Duke of Northumberland had Lambley by the grant of Edward VI it was afterwards in the Featherstonhaughs of Featherston Castle and now is the estate of Sir Lancelot Allgood This place suffered in an incursion of the Scots in the reign of Edward I AD when passing down Redesdale and Tindale burning and laying waste the country and committing horrid cruelties on the inha∣bitants they destroyed Corbridge burnt the town monastry and church of Hexham and also this small nunnery The wretched nuns suffering the common fate of captives in those savage invasions torture and ravishment  The river being rough and the fords not known to us we left the vale and traversing the heights approached  FEATHERSTON CASTLE  which lays in a little sequestered valley concealed by the surrounding hills From the eminence over which we travelled we could command a view for several miles on every hand but almost the whole scene was one vast expanse of waste and barrenness hill arising beyond hill in dreary succession of broken crags or brown heath at the feet of the mountains here and there a little verdure was perceived a narrow valley and a solitary cottage The inhabitants are shepherds and lan∣guish out a life of indigence and laziness As we descended into the vale where the castle stands some pretty plains of meadow ground on the margin of Tyne were revealed to us which whilst we remained on the heights lay concealed from our view  The castle is little more than a square tower calculated for defence against those tribes of robbers the Moss Troopers Every chief man∣sion in the county of Northumberland in former times was obliged to be thus defended so that the number of those small castles is very great Featherston tower hath two exploratory turrets it is vaulted underneath for the purpose of securing flocks and herds in the time of assault  The family of Featherstonhaugh possessed this place for several ages the first upon record is Thomas de Featherstonhaugh in the first year  of Edward I who held it as a member of the barony of Tynedale  Excheat Edward I  after whom it remained in that family till the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth it afterwards was sold to Lord Carlisle and is now the possession of Sir Matthew Featherstonhaugh  Mr Wallis who wrote the Antiquities of Northumberland with infinite industry acquired genealogical tables of almost all the Northumbrian familiesFrom his publication I will make extracts as the best authority extant from whence I can lay before the reader an account of those antient houses this county boasts  Thomas de Featherston Haugh King Edward I King Edward II  Alexander King Edward III  Thomas same  Sir Albany High Sheriff of Northumb Queen Elizabeth  Alexander High Sheriff of Northumb same  The prospects from the tower are narrow composed of some culti∣vated lands on the skirts of the hills little groves hanging over the brink of the river grassy plains forming the depth of the vale through which the Tyne rushes and a few scattered cottages over which so∣lemn and gloomy mountains on every hand impend  We pursued our way to Bellister Castle by a winding road on the banks of Tyne the vale widening as we proceeded and the progress of cultivation encreasing upon usa most happy change to a traveller  The situation of  BELLISTER CASTLE  is beautiful a rich vale intervenes between it and the river at the time of our passage covered with an abundant crop of wheat The Tyne here a formidable stream shews many broad canals as it winds down the valley the banks are wooded and the rising grounds on every side are rich and well cultivatedThe town of Haltwezell is a great ornament to the landskip as it is seen hanging on the opposite eminence  This castle is a rude structure of an irregular form as it now lays in ruins placed on an artificial mount defended by a moat the whole a ragged and confused pile of mouldering walls without any ornament or beauty and rendered more gloomy by the branches of large oaks  which have surmounted the building and shade great part of its re∣mains  This was the seat of the Blenkinsops  Them  erkinsop  ner of  e  stor King Edward VI  George Queen Elizabeth  Wallis  Wallis says a younger branch of the family of Blenkinsop Castle It is now the property of John Blenkinsop Coulson  Esq  of Jesmond but the manor appertains to the Ellisons of Parkhouse  We proceeded towards Haltwezell in hopes to pass the river by the ferryboat but the boatman who thinks himself a competent judge of the necessity there is for his attendance was not to be found and we were obliged to pass the ford which is broad and deep with a bottom of very large stones over which a horse breast deep in the water un∣accustomed to the passage incessantly faulters or stumbles Those cir∣cumstances would have been greatly aggravated by our ignorance of the place had we not met with a person to conduct usInstances of well applied charity characterize this age it would not be one of the least to give a stipend to an attendant at such fords as these by which many valuable lives would be savedIs it not shocking that a traveller should be exposed to infinite perils by the stupidity or folly of a boatman who presumes to determine on a matter of such moment as the fate of his fellow creature a wretch whose character perhaps is one of those humiliating subjects which serve to reduce selfestimation and human vanity by shewing how near man in the lowest class is to the brute creation  HALTWEZELL  is a pleasant village holding a market on Thursdays the situation is lofty the churchyard on the south side of the town commands a fine prospect over the vale where Tyne flowing in meanders shews it∣self variously upon the Landskip which is bounded by Bellister Castle and the adjoining woods on the one hand and extends to Haydon bridge on the other at the instant of our view varied with all the rich temts of summer and the happy effects of cultivation  The church contains little that is remarkable within the altar rails is the tombstone of an ecclesiastic sculptured with a crosier of excellent  work and highly ornamented a pilgrim's scrip and staff with a coat armour party per fesse and three garbs the personage interred not known  The following rude epitaph marks one of the Riddle family  John Redel  That sum  tim did be  then Laird of the Walton  Gon is he out of this val of Mesre  His bons lies under this stons    A mutilated effigy of a knight templar who had made the crusade lays here his legs across and hands elevated said to be one of the Blenkinsops of Blenkinsop Castle  The Scots plundered this place in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth but being pursued by the then Lord Warden of the Middle Marches they suffered severely for their temerityHere is an infant manufactory of coarse baize to which the situation promises prosperityA small en∣dowment was made by Lady Capel for a master to teach reading and writing  At the east end of the town is an eminence called Castle Banks of an oval figure in the centre of which is a fine spring On the east and west end four distinct terraces bankings or gradations are cut arising one above another The crown of the hill is defended by a breastwork of earth towards the town and on the south by an inac∣cessible precipice at whose foot the river runs To what people this fortification belonged is not known no memorable action having made it remarkable in history Mr Wallis's opinion appears to be a very just one that these eminences thus terraced were occupied by the militia when an enemy had penetrated the country where they not only had a powerful appearance in such arrangement but also could fight with great advantage when an attack was made upon them  This county bears innumerable memorials of warfare several of which are not now to be ascribed to any particular people either from their form materials or construction It was the mode of all contend∣ing  parties in ancient times to entrench and throw up breastworks which were frequently formed to suit the situation without regard to any singular model common to themselves This was the practice only in times of immediate emergency the permanent camps or stations were fortified in a mode peculiar to each people Such as are remark∣able will be particularly noticed in the following pages  From Haltwezell we proceeded to  CARRVORAN  a Roman station situate on a declivity which descends swiftly to∣wards the southwest about a hundred yards distant from the Picts Wall of a square figure with obtuse angles each side being paces The Pretorium is very distinguishable about seven paces from the southern side commanding a very extensive prospect Mr Carrick who farms the ground is raising the foundations of the Pretorium and will no doubt discover some valuable antiquities I procured here a fine silver coin of Antoninus Pius well preserved which was found on this station  In Warburton's Vallum Romanum this station is numbered eleven his treatise beginning at Segedunum With Mr Horsley he presumes there is no doubt but this was the ancient Magna where the  Cohors Se∣cunda Dalmatarum  was quartered according to the Notitia Whether the ancient name Magna was British or purely Roman is difficult to determine  Horsley's Br Ro p  Mr Horsley's description is chiefly that CarrVoran is placed about or chains to the south of both the walls which are here very near to each other and has a peat moss before it This may both be the reason of the modern name and why the walls approach no nearer to it The ramparts round this fort are very conspicuous and the whole ditch remains distinguishable the buildings without the fort have been on the south and west sides on the descent to∣wards the river Tippal This is one of the forts entirely within Ha∣drian's Vallum The military way called Maiden Way passes through this place and as is said goes to Beau Castle which is about six miles  from it and the other military way which comes from Walwick Ches∣ters passes a little to the south of this fort or enters and terminates in the Roman town here It is very visible upon the moor southeast of and not far from CarrVoran  A small altar was formerly found here dedicated to Vitirinaeus a tutelar God  Camden  DEO  VITI  RINE  LIMEO  In consequence of a vow  ROV  Posuit libens merito  P L M  A small brass image of one of the Laresa ring engraven with the fi∣gure of Victory on a rough corneliana curious effigy in relief of a Roman soldier on a white rag stone were found here in the year  Wallis  The figure is about inches in height is helmetted cloathed in a pallium or light robe flowing to his feet clasped on the breast with a fibula in his right hand he is armed with the hasta and rests his left on a parma or shield supported on a pedestal above his shoul∣der are the figures of a stag seized by a lion Abundance of stags' horns have been dug up here the bones and ashes of animals and many millstones  Mr Horsley has the following inscriptions in his Brit Rom  LXVI Solvit libentissime merito  This I found lying in the court before the house it is an altar and has a praesericulum on one side and a patera with a crocked handle on the other but I could discern no letters at all on the face of the altar though the four on the base were visible  LXVII Deo Vitiri Menius Dada votum solvit libens merito  Abundance of antiquities of various sorts have been dug up in this Roman station and town When I was last there I purchased a Roman ring with a Victory on a cornelian but coarse as also a small altar lately found with the above very plain inscription upon it dedicated by one Menius Dada to the God Vitires  LXVIII DIS Manibus Aurelia Pubeo Voma vixit annos Aurelius Pubeo Naso Pientis∣simae filiae dicat  These stones are used for two steps in the stairs of a house the letters are very visible but part of them especially on one of the stones is covered by the next step above which rests upon this I soon perceived that both of them must have originally belonged to one and the same stone The whole stone appears plainly to have been a funeral monument erected by  Aurelius Pubeo Naso  for his daughter  Aurelia Pubeo Voma  Neither this nor the  preceding stones have been published before unless a small altar in Mr Warburton's Map of Northumberland with the same letters SLLM on the base of No LXVI though there is little resemblance between the two draughts  LXIX Dirus Vitirious Deccius votum solvit libens merito  This is a small altar found here by Mr Gordon and presented by him to Baron Clerk in whose collection it now is Mr Gordon supposes it to be the same with that which was dis∣covered by Mr Camden dedicated to the tutelar God  Vitorinus  but according to his own representation it must be  Dirus Vitirieus Deccius  though what this gentleman took for an E is a B in the original so that the name is  Vitiribus  and so it was read to me by the learned Baron himself besides it is quite different from that in Camden It seems plain from other inscriptions that  Vitires  and not  Vitirinus  was the name of the tutelar God for we meet with  Vitir  in the dative  Dirus Vitiribus Deccius  is evidently the name of the person who erected this altar it founds more like the name of a foreigner than a Roman and therefore this person was probably among the auxiliaries by whom these stations upon the wall were garrisoned  N B On one side of this altar a Dolphin is delineated  The learned Baron has observes with relation to the Dolphin that this was a figure much in use about the time that the Roman walls were made in Britain and even before the ancients denoted by it dispatch of business and Vespasian who was very fond of the proverb used by Augustus Caesar Fe  ina lente ordered on some of his coins a Dolphin to be represented twisting about an anchor importing both Tarditas and Festinatio the Dol∣phin was likewise accounted  by Plutarch and others it is probable that some such thing was understood by the erector of this altar There is a Boar on the other side of th  s altar which is frequently to be met with on ancient sculptures in Britain  S  h from this station at less than a mile distance stands Blenkinsop Castle near the side of the river T  ppal at which place was formerly the following inscription  LXX De  hus Nymphis Vetia mansueta et Claudia Turbivella filia votum solverunt libentes  The late Dr Ca  of Newcastle sent a copy of this inscription to the late Mr Thoresby of Leeds who published it in the Transactions It is also in Camden's Britannia No doubt it had been found some way hereabouts and probably near the river it is now at Dryburn Haugh near the Spittle fixed at the stable door Who these nymphs were may be difficult to determine because they were of various sorts and supposed to reside almost in all places both by land and water  There is a fine address to the water nymphs in Virgil  "Nymphae Laurentes Nymphae genus amnibus unde est  "Tuque O Tybri tuo genitor cum flumine sancto  "Acc  pite Aeneam et tandem arcete periclis"  Mr Warburton has published in his Map of Northumberland two small altars On the face of one is Veteres and on the base of the other DM for  Dis Manibus  on the base of an altar These Mr Warburton says were at Thirlwell Castle or near it but I could not find the originals  LXXI Imperatori Caesari Flavio Valerio Constantino Pio Nobilissimo Caesari  This was also found here and carried from hence by Mr Warburton but has come since into my possession Mr Warburton takes some notice of it in his Map of Northumberland the only place I know of wherein it has ever been published before The inscription is cu  i∣cus and needs no explanation It has been erected to the honour of Constantine the Great  The letters in the name Constantino are crowded for want of room on the stone The repe∣tition of the word Caesari at the beginning and end renders it very curious and perhaps sin∣gular in its kind Spanheim takes notice of the like on two coins one of Carinus and the other of Numerinus but represents them as peculiar and contrary to the usual custom In the letters IMR at the beginning the R which is very plain on the stone is either a mistake for P or else a designed contraction of IMPER for Imperatori so we have NBL for Nobi∣lis and CS for Caesar as likewise CT for Caput or Civitas as Manutius reads them with several others of the like nature which if attended to may in some cases remove the suspi∣cion of an error in the Workmen This monument must have been erected to Constantine after the death of his father Constantius who died in Britain for the title of Imperator was not given him till then As to the title Nobilis or Nobilissimus Caesar it was sometimes as∣sumed by the Emperors themselves and usually given to their sons  LXXII DuStireuBetro  At Wall End just by Thirlwell Castle I discovered this inscription it is upon a frag∣ment of a stone and so imperfect that it is very difficult to make any thing of it The stone is coarse but the letters that remain fair and well enough cut By the shape and ornament of the stone I incline to think it has been sepulchral DVI put me in mind of the God Dui in a Yorkshire inscription If this should be so sepulchral I know not but the last word may have been  Bretonum  that is  Cohors quarta Bretonum  and then the word in the second line  Stireus  may be the name of a soldier or commander of this cohort but this is only conjecture  LXXIII Jovi Optimo Maximo  This is now a trough in a stable at Thirlwell It seems plainly to have been the body of an altar the capital and base being struck off erected to Jupiter Optimus Maximus but by whom cannot now be discovered  LXXIIII Centurio Munax solvit Votum  At Glenwhelt which is about a quarter of a mile south of CarrVoran I saw a centu∣rial inscription which reads Centurio Munax solvit Votum The V that was joined to the M was turned somewhat round at the bottom The stone is very long and tapering almost py∣ramidal and only square in that face which bears the inscription An old man here remem∣bered it was brought from the face of the wall near Thirlwall Castle which very well agrees with the figure of it  LXXV Cohortis Primae Centurio Libonius Posuit  This is now in the fore wall of a barn at Greenfoot which is just on the other side of the water overagainst Glenwhelt it is centurial too and needs no explicat  on  LXXV Centuria Munatii Maximi  Under this number are

broken Effigies Millstones and other things a bench is raised at the door of the house and covered with a  large flat stone on which a small altar is cut in relief with the inscrip∣tion shewn in the plate In the yard lays another fragment which I conceive is inscribed to Numerianus and in the aperture left to admit  the light into a hayloft are two fragments of inscriptions one re∣versed and rendered not legible the other represented in the plate to∣gether with some small inscriptions built up in the walls of the outhouses and which have never before been published  Camden says he could not discover the ancient name of this station no lights being given thereto either by inscriptions or otherwise  We passed down by Glenwelt to  BLENKINSOP CASTLE  situate on the southern banks of the brook Tippal By the remains it appears this Castle has consisted of a square tower built on an artificial  mount surrounded by an outward wall at the distance only of four paces of equal height with the interior building defended towards the north by a very deep ditch and outward mound The out wall towards the west has been removed of late years and lays the tower open on that side Three vaults support the building one of which is feet wide This Castle is the property of J Blenkinsop Coulson  Esq  has been in the family of Blenkinsops for many centuries  Ralph de Blenkinsop K Edward I  Thomas K Edward III  William Queen Elizabeth  Wallis  and held of the Manor of Langley  A general account of the  PICTS WALL  the most remarkable piece of Roman Antiquity in this country may not be disagreeable in this place before we enter on the more populous parts of the county It was built as a barrier against the incursions of the northern inhabitants who were continually harrassing the Ro∣mans by attacking them in sundry places at one time or by small bodies of ravagers who swept away the cattle and flocks of the coun∣try The Romans called it Vallum Barbaricum Pretentatura and Clausura Hadrian's vallum was constructed of earth and bears date about the year of the christian aera Severus's is supposed by many to be of masonry and built about the year  Spartian p calls Severus's work a Stone Wall  but of the mate∣rials it was constructed the Roman authorities are very vague and doubtful Bede says  Severus having been victorious at home in the civil war which was attended with many dangers was drawn into Britain upon an almost general revolt of the allies there where after many conflicts having recovered part of the island he thought it ex∣pedient to sever it from the barbarous states not with a wall as some think but with a rampier for a wall is made of stone but a ram∣pier whereby camps are fortified to repel the force of an enemy is made of turfs cut out of the earth and raised in the manner of a wall so that there be a ditch or trench in front whereout the turfs are gotten upon which were pitched piles of very strong timber And so Severus cast a great ditch and raised a most strong rampier  strengthened with many turrets thereupon from sea to sea  Here we have a perfect description of one of the Roman fortifications which Bede by mistake attributes to Severusan outward ditch a rampier of earth fortified with a strong palisado and guarded by turrets from whence with missile weapons the defenders could flank the vallum and command the ditch upon an assault The third and last vallum is by many authors said to be the work of the Britons aided by the Ro∣mans under the third consulate of Aetius about the year who upon receiving a second embassy complaining of the hardships they laboured under from the frequent inroads and invasions of the nor∣thern nations and their inability to resist them a legion was sent into Britain who with the assistance of the natives built or rather rebuilt and reinstated the wall of stone in length miles from the point of land at Boulness on Solway Firth to the mouth of the Tyne Gildas says  the Romans erected a wall after their usual manner of building not like unto the other meaning the vallum of earth or turf or at the common charge of the empire but aided by the poor and mise∣rable natives this was carried from sea to sea between the cities which were placed there as fortifications against the enemy  Bede adds  which wall that was heretofore famous and conspicuous they with public and private cost having with them the helping hand of the Britons built eight feet broad and twelve feet high in a direct line from east to west"  The  auth  have a  uted the  to wrong personages it being allowed by the most learned  that the  was the w  rk of Severus which opinion is sounded on  Severus was a  ded in the work by the Bri∣  in  pplies of necessaries for the artificers in the progress of it  Camden says "it had many towers or fortresses each about a mile distant which are called Castlesteeds and within little fenced towns in these days called Chesters Also turrets standing between these from whence the soldiers might dis∣cover the approach of an enemy at a considerable distance wherein the Areani might have their stations  These Areani were spies and men swift of foot to give alarms upon approaching danger Camden says in his time there was a traditionary tale that a brazen trumpet ran through the wall by which an alarm might be communicated from tower to tower This report he reconciles by an ancient service attendant on the border lands OF CORNAGE for which to this day a money payment issues out of many of the Northumbrian estates This service of Cornage was a kind of tenure in grand serjeantry the nature  of which was to alarm the country by the sound of a horn when any invasion of the Scots was perceived The wall then was a formidable defence feet high guarded by castles and exploratory turrets  Whereas the Roman Empire by the providence of Dioclesian was in the most distant marches securely fortified with towns castles and burghs All the military forces were stationed there so that the barbarous nations could not enter the country without op∣position at every pass Constantine abolishing this order of garrison removed his troops from the marches to cities and towns not needful of armed force so that he left the marches open to the barbarians ungarrisoned and distressed the cities with the maintenance of troops where there was a settled peace The frontier stations became desolate the sol∣diers addicted to theatrical entertainments and other pleasures became debauched In a word he it was who brought the first cause of ruin to the empire  Zosimus  I examined the foundations of some of those castlesteads with attention where the military roads approached the wall and they appeared to me the remains of gateways over which perhaps there were towers for their defence No other apertures are seen in the wall but at the sta∣tions which is singular as the Romans when they found it necessary to scour the outward frontiers or make a sally on a sudden attack had no sallyports or other means to depart their own fortification than by descending the wall or making an egress at one of these stations or military ways which indeed seems strangely inconsistent It is very probable that the Chesters were defended in the same manner as the wall described by Bede and perhaps the vallum was surmounted with a palisado of which the Corona Vallaris I presume is a model not to be denied The obtuse angles of the stations encourage an apprehen∣sion that they were guarded by exploratory turrets  The highest part of the wall now standing is near CarrVoran where it runs upon the brink of a cliff to the summit of some emi∣nences it is there near nine feet high the outward facing of free stone not totally removed Where the foundation was not good or the wall had to pass a morass it is built on piles of oak the interstice between the two facings of the wall is filled with broad thin stones placed ob∣liquely and filled with run lime Camden says the wall near CarrVoran in his time was feet high and feet thick built on both sides of foursquare ashler stones which greatly exceeds Bede's descrip∣tion At some little distance from Walwick the remains of the turf or earth fence are to be seen in three distinct bankings or rampiers the principal one about the height of feet and feet at the base at the distance of feet to the south is a trench feet wide from the  southern brink of which arises a rampier of earth about feet at its base and feet in height feet distant from this is another rampier of equal height and feet at its base these two last on the south side of the trench forming a perfect covered way in breadth feet The most northern of these rampiers in this part is distant from the stone wall paces the present military road passing between them  The particular description of these fortifications of the Romans given by Mr Horsley in his Brit Rom and Mr Warburton in his Vallum Rom would be too tedious to be inserted here and inconsistent with my plan Their more general observations together with my own must suffice  It is evident there have been three different Praetenturae erected here at different times and by different persons the first of which was a se∣ries of stations or forts placed quite cross the country and this it is presumed was done chiefly by Julius Agricola and is the most ancient of the three Next to this was erected Hadrian's vallum and its ap∣purtenances after which the aforesaid stations might probably go by the name of  Stationes  per  Liniam Valli  The last and strongest fence of all was as most learned antiquaries agree built by Severus which is a stone wall that lays north of the rampiers of earth  Hadrian's vallum was the second Praetentatura and seems rather to have given the former the name of Stations per  Liniam Valli  than the wall of Severus What Bede says of the wall's being rebuilt afterwards by the Romans is applicable to this  that it is carried on from town to town much in a strait line  What belongs to this work is the Vallum on the brink of the ditch having the ditch on the north ano∣ther Vallum southward distant from the former about feet and a large Vallum on the north of the ditch The south Vallum has either been made for an inner defence in case the enemy might beat them from any part of the principal vallum or to protect the soldiers against a sudden attack from the provincial Britons These four works keep all the way a constant regular parallelism one to another The third Praetentatura was Severus's stone wall We have the express testimony of some ancient writers concerning this Emperor's building a wall cross our island which will be explained hereafter To this work be∣longs  a paved military way which has attended the wall on the south side though it be not always parallel to it It sometimes coincides with Hadrian's north vallum but whenever this is too distant or perhaps has been too ruinous or in any other respect inconvenient the new mili∣tary way which is a reparation of the old Roman road made by order of government always accompanies Severus's wall and comes up near to every Castellum upon it and therefore it is to be presumed the Ro∣man military road has been a work cotemporary with the wall and directly for its service It is apprehended there has been also a lesser military way near to the wall for the convenience of small parties passing from turret to turret There is also belonging to this work a large ditch on the north side of the wall but there are no remains to prove that there was any breastwork or Agger of earth on its northern brink Upon this wall certain castles and turrets have been regularly placed and at proper distances one from another and in order to form a general idea of the wall and its original state it will be neces∣sary to have some knowledge of these  All these castles except one near Harlow Hill which may have been built before the wall are feet square the wall itself falling in with and forming the north side of them The intervals between these cas∣tles are not always exactly the same but excepting two or three at the east end of the wall always less than a mile that is from six furlongs and a half to seven They are constantly called castles or castlesteads by the country people which seems to make it probable that the latin word has been castellum and by the form and use of them seem to have been a smaller sort of a castle for a small garrison So likewise they call the Castra Stativa or Aestiva usually Chesters from the Latin and this is a usual criterion whereby to discover a Roman encampment or station These Castella seem to have stood closest where the stations are widest and are by some modern authors called mile castles or mil∣liary Castella In the last edition of Camden they are through mistake said to be of a very different shape and size Perhaps the remaining ruins of two or three castlesteads that do not join the walls and of one that does which are all plainly of another sort have occasioned this error It is not improbable that there may also have been some exploratory castles belonging to Hadrian's work though there be little appearance of such at present unless the small remains at Chapel Hou∣ses near Newburn and those near Heddon on the Wall which are CastleSteads be of this sort But be that as it will in relation to  Hadrian's vallum above twothirds of these castella are yet very visible upon the wall of Severus and for a long way together especially about the middle of the wall they have their distinct vestiges remaining without interruption But the original number and situation of these castella may be best known by the following table taken from Mr Warburton's Vall Rom and Mr Horsley's Brit Rom  Castles coinciding with the stations  Castles whose remains are visible  Castles quite destroyed  Sum total of castles

Boulness                         The small turrets in Latin Turres have been more generally and entirely ruined than the Castella so that it is hard to find three of them any where together with certainty The distance between two where it was thought surest was measured and found to be near chains or yards It therefore seems most probable that there have been four of these between every two Castella at equal distances from the Castella and one another for thus five intervals will be found between every two Castella each consisting of chains which five intervals will just amount to furlongs the usual or mean distance between the Castella And this scheme answers with a good deal of exactness to the situation of all the turrets that have yet been discovered These ex∣ploratory turrets or watch towers seem to have been only about four yards square at the bottom and by placing centinels at each of these who must have been within call of one another the communication quite along the wall might be kept up without having recourse to the fiction of a sounding trumpet or pipes laid under ground from one end of the wall to the other though this seems to be credited by Mr Echard and others  There have also been several larger forts or stations upon the wall or near it whose distances from each other will be particularly shewn hereafter and may be seen in the foregoing table  Whilst I am giving a general view of the ancient state of the wall it may not be improper to observe that there have been of these sta∣tions upon it with intervals between them the wall is in length miles and three furlongs this divided by gives the mean distance which is very little more than four miles but the stations are much closer and thicker at each end and in the middle than in the interme∣diate spaces between the middle and the extremities which is not disagreeable to reason or the usual rules of fortification Besides if according to the common tradition the inroads of the enemy were in or near the middle it was necessary to make it stronger and guard it more especially since the advanced stations were fewest if any where those upon the wall were closest  This wall runs generally upon the top or ridge of the higher ground keeping a descent on the north or enemy's side and hath thereby both a greater strength and better prospect for the sake of which it often forms an angle In Hadrian's vallum it is different but both in the  main seem to have been carried on pretty much in a straight line from station to station there is indeed now and then a gentle turn in crossing a rivulet or at a station and sometimes too in passing a height but this last happens usually at coming within sight of a station and per∣haps in order to reach it Hadrian's vallum keeps more in a straight line than Severus's wall as much as the nature of the ground and other circumstances would admit It is plain a military way has constantly attended Severus's wall and no doubt was made at the same time with it this always keeps nigh to the wall and never coincides with the north vallum of Hadrian but when the two works approach one another When they part and go at a distance one from the other the way leaves the vallum to accompany the stone wall but where the wall passes along the brink of precipices the way does not fol∣low every little turn but in these lesser windings is like the string of a bow and keeps upon the sides of the hill in order to avoid as much as possible the sudden ascent or descent in passing from hill to hill and yet so as at the same time never to be at a great distance from the wall The rule therefore by which this way seems to have been conducted is in general by keeping pretty close to the wall and and at the same time going on a line from Castellum to Castellum and shunning the ascent of hills as much as possible And as the smaller military way went from turret to turret close by the wall so this greater way attended the Castella falling in with Hadrian's north vallum which Mr Warburton conceives was the old military way though north of the ditch vallums and covered way when that did not take too much out of the road or was not too ruinous to be made use of The old military way as Mr Warburton calls it has been the best and most direct passage from station to station and when the line of the stations fetched a compass another distinct military way and shorter was laid not from one station to the next but between two stations more remote  This was certainly done in Northumberland from Walwick to CarrVoran and I have reason to apprehend the like was done also in Cum∣berland from CarrVoran or at least from Cambeck to Stanwicks The military way of Severus seems to have been well paved but not raised so high as what Mr Warburton calls the old military way  Mr Warburton says he was not able to discover any gates in this wall or passes through it except just in the stations or where the  grand military roads have crossed it where the Erminstreet not the Watlingstreet as Mr Horsley calls it passes the wall near Halton there is a visible track of a square gate and the ditch belonging to the wall manifestly goes about the half of it the inner half not being now so visible This gate seems to be much of the same size with one of the Castella feet square only these are wholly within the wall and the gate half within and half without Mr Warburton says he expected to have found some other gates of the same form or some passes through the wall in the Castella but could not The other two military ways which cross the wall seem to have passed at the stations of CarrVoran and Stanwicks  What the several dimensions of the walls ditches Vallums and mi∣litary ways have originally been may not be easy to determine with exactness but the length of Severus's wall is certainly known it hav∣ing been three times measured of late once by Mr Gordon a second time by order of Mr Warburton and a third by the Board of Ordnance A D and as there is little difference between the three measures it is a proof there is no material mistake in either Mr Gordon gives a summary account of his work in these words  The number of sta∣tions taken in my actual survey from sea to sea were in all wherein I made Severus's wall the principal line of the said stationary distances the total amount of which was Roman paces equal to Roman miles and Roman paces equal to English miles and paces  The number of stations or places of observation upon the same principal stationary line in the survey Mr Warburton ordered to be made were the length of the wall miles and furlongs in∣cluding the length of the stations at each end In this account English measured miles and furlongs are retained in order to make it more plain and intelligible It is easy to reduce an English mile to a Roman one by considering that Roman paces that is Roman feet make a Roman mile and allowing for the inequality between the Ro∣man foot and the English an English mile is nearly equal to a Roman mile and onethirtieth so that English miles will be much about Roman  From what has been said it appears to be a mistake to suppose Ha∣drian's vallum longer than Severus's wall as Mr Gordon seems to have  done It is certain the former has gone more in a right line than the latter and it seems probable that Severus's wall has at each end been carried further than Hadrian's so that the very exact agreement which Mr Gordon supposes between  the actual survey of the wall and the account given of it by the Romans themselves  is in a great measure imaginary For according to Spartian Hadrian's vallum was Ro∣man miles long but the actual mensuration cannot stretch Severus's wall up to and Hadrian's vallum is certainly two or three miles shorter upon account of its being straighter There had just been milliary Castella upon Severus's wall and consequently just intervals between the castella So that if the Romans in a general way called every interval a mile one with another and Hadrian's vallum was near the same length with Severus's this might be looked upon as a plausible reason why the historian should say it was miles long  According to Bede the wall was eight feet in breadth and twelve feet in height as probably there was a parapet or palisado at the top so this would first go to ruin Bede's measure is most likely to be exclusive of these the thickness of Severus's wall has been measured several times of late and by several persons without any great variation and by the measures taken in different parts it seems not to have been every where equal Near Harlowhill it measured seven feet four inches near the foundation and at another place where the wall is two yards high it was at that height about seven feet thick which shews that the usual breadth near the foundation was a Roman pace and an half Near Boulness on the Solway Firth at a place called Kirklands it measures near nine feet and there seems to be an obvious reason why it should be stronger here for at full sea the water has certainly flowed up to it  The breadth of Hadrian's ditch at a limestone quarry west of Harlowhill where the original breadth and depth is apparent and may be ex∣actly ascertained it measured near nine feet deep and eleven feet over it was wider at the top than at the bottom the sides being sloping The ditch belonging to Severus's wall was in all places both wider and deeper than that which belonged to Hadrian's vallum  The distances between the several parts of these works seem some of them to have all the way been constantly the same others of them vary Among these variable distances is that between the two walls which sometimes come very near within a chain of each other but at  other times are at chains distance The distance also between Se∣verus's wall and the military way belonging to it is as I have said not always the same though generally about two or three chains upon some particular occasions it may run at the distance of five or six chains from it or considerably more as between the two Castella west of Shewen Sheels where the distance of the military way from the wall is at one part chains or more but the distance between Hadrian's Val∣lum ditch and north mound are every where the same and so are constantly parallel one to the other The north mound is about feet on a medium from the ditch and of the two mounds of the Vallum one arises on the very brink of the ditch and the other is about the distance of feet The materials of which these fortifications were constructed are certainly known Hadrian's is of earth though some∣times mixed with stone but I could discover no appearance of timber Severus's was of free stone as is certain from what is yet visible of it in some places where the foundation was not good they seem to have made use of oaken piles The inner part of this wall is filled after a remarkable manner the filling stones are generally pretty large and mostly broad and thin These are always set edgeways and usually not erect but obliquely upon these the running mortar or cement has been poured and by this contrivance together with the great strength of their cement in most places the whole has been bound as firm as a rock People are much at a loss to know from whence the Romans had the stones which they used in building the wall in several parts and for other occasions In some places particularly in Cumber∣land no free stone is to be had but from a very great distance and in other places where some might have been had the Romans seem not to have used it but stone of a very different grit This appears more particularly in the station at the end of the wall near Cousins House where the Roman stone is of a very coarse grit so as to be easily distin∣guished from others and both the learned authors before me say they were assured that there was no such stone nor any quarry of such a grit in the neighbourhood The devil's arrows at Boroughbridge in Yorkshire are yet of a coarser nature and seem to be artificial stone  The composition of the devil's arrows prove them to be artificial pieces of brick being in∣termixed with the small pebbles and granules of spar They appear to have been formed in a mould the tops of the columns being channelled as the flowing in of the liquidated composi∣tion might be conceived to occasion  Some particular places from whence they were furnished with stone  may be guessed at with probability Such for instance are the rocks between Walwick and Carraw through part of which Hadrian's ditch was cut and in the late edition of Camden it is supposed that stones were got at Hellbeck Scar on the Gelt and Leugh Cragg the truth of which Mr Horsley proves in his remarks on the inscriptions there  Some have wondered how this work could be carried on in the face of the enemy supposing the wall to be the very boundary at the time it was built but there appears no reason to entertain this opinion for when the Romans had advanced their conquests in Scotland beyond the Firth of Tay they only fortified the other isthmus between Forth and Clyde which might be miles or more south from the utmost extent of their conquest as appears from Tacitus's account of that mat∣ter so that they kept their Pretenturae or series of fortifications cross the country a good way within the bounds of their conquest and pro∣bably when the walls were erected here the Romans were possessed of part of the country beyond them and of son  advanced stations there as may be concluded from the inscriptions yet extant so that this wall might probably not be built till Severus had driven the enemy so far to the north as to render them incapable of giving any interruption to the Romans when carrying on the work  At which end they began the several Pretenturae may be another enquiry The Pretentura of stations was most probably begun from the west because Julius Agricola first conquered the western parts of the northern country and Hadrian I believe in erecting his vallum began there too as seems probable from the inscriptions Severus it is likely did so too with his wall which is much confirmed by the situation of the Castella that are at a regular distance if we begin our reckoning from the west but if we begin to reckon from the east end of the wall the first Castellum appears within less than three furlongs of the Station there  It is the opinion of some ingenious persons that both the walls with all their appurtenances and the Stations upon them were the work of the same time and the same person and that the one is only an inte∣rior Vallum or foss to the other But that this was not the original de∣sign of the Vallum though it might be so used by Severus appears plain from the testimonies of the Roman historians nor does this no∣tion suit the circumstances of the work itself as they yet appear The  coincidence of Severus's military way with the north Vallum without the ditch the exact parallelism of all the parts of Hadrian's work and the very unequal distances that are between the two walls themselves are convincing arguments that the walls have been erected at different times It is also the opinion of some to whose judgment I pay a great regard that Severus's wall was built upon the same foundation with Hadrian's principal Vallum This conjecture is supported by plausible reasons for if the north eminence or line has been an old military way the supposition of a rampart and ditch to the north of that way would remove the difficulty of the soldiers being exposed to the enemy whilst they were on their march since then the way would have been defended on both sides Again the stations too as well as this sup∣posed military way are generally though not always included be∣tween the two walls and ditches or between the works of Severus and Hadrian as they are now called the stone wall of Severus frequently falling in within the north rampart of the station as the turf wall of Hadrian does with the southern  Besides this the advantageous ground is often left on the north side of Hadrian's Vallum which in one place near Halton Chesters is just carried round the south skirt of a tumulus or small hill making a sudden turn seemingly with a design to avoid passing over it Now if this was intended to be the most northerly fortification and to be a fence against the northern enemies this conduct seems to offend against right reason as well as against the rule of Vigetius  that care should be taken to have no neighbouring hill higher than the fortification which being seized by the enemy might be of ill consequence  And it must be owned that the southern prospect of Hadrian's work and the defence on that side is generally better than on the north whereas the northern prospect and defence have been principally or solely taken care of in the wall of Severus Such considerations as these have in¦duced some to believe that what now goes by the name of Hadrian's work was originally designed for a fence against any sudden insurrec∣tion of the provincial Britons and particularly of the Brigantes whilst others look upon it as a Fossa Interior for the soldiers to retreat to after they had been beaten off by the northern enemy from their principal Vallum Both agree in this that Hadrian must have built a more nor∣therly Vallum than those which now bear his name and that this must have stood upon the same track where Severus afterwards erected his wall This according to their opinion would render the whole  fortification rational and regular whereas without this it must have been in many places very weak and open to the inroads of the Cale∣donians But on the other hand plausible conjectures and speculative arguments must give way to stronger proofs on the contrary side though at this distance of time we cannot see into the designs of the Romans nor account for every particular part of their conduct in this affair Mr Horsley conceives that what is now called Hadrian's north Agger or Vallum was the most ancient military way leading from Sta∣tion to Station and that Hadrian's work after this was guided and limited by it as it keeps a constant parallelism to it The north Agger considered as a military way is conducted according to the Roman art and rules in every part of it It is carried on in the shortest line from Station to Station and this without doubt is the true reason why it runs so much upon the southern skirts of the northern hills the shortest line leading that way This is particularly remarkable in the small hill near Halton Chesters before observed The direct line of the way would have lead over the hill but to avoid climbing it a small turn is made to carry it round the skirt and it passes on the south side ra∣ther than the north because this is the shorter and more convenient way to the Station to which it is tending The other parts of Hadrian's work keep their due distance and parallelism bending exactly in the same manner as the north Agger or Vallum does and so running at a few yards distance to the south of the hill In a word the north Val∣lum or as Mr Horsley terms it the old military way keeps just such a course and runs through such grounds as one would expect such a Roman way should do And if it was determined that Hadrian's work should strictly accompany this and keep all along an exact pa∣rallelism to it they must then by this rule be tied down to these seem∣ing irregularities and misconduct which appear in this work It may be said that they might at least have made the fortification on the north side of the military way if there was no other more northerly fence but to this it is replied that it was scarce practicable to carry on the work on the north side of the way so as to be near and parallel to it and such is the situation of the ground that if they had done so it would have been generally weaker than it is running along the very sides of the hills unless they had made it where Severus's wall stands and where as has been said some suppose Hadrian's principal Vallum to have stood but that in fact Hadrian had no Vallum here and that the whole of his work was comprehended in what still goes by his name appears most probable from the following considerations  Among all the historians that mention the building of such a wall by Severus there is not the least hint to be met with of his building it upon the same foundation with Hadrian's Vallum The expression of Spartian "apud Vallum" looks the likest it of any but it is cer∣tainly more agreeable to this expression to suppose it to be only near the Vallum and not directly upon it and to build a stone wall upon the foundation of an earth one does not appear very probable If I am not greatly mistaken it would be more laborious and expensive to build such a wall upon the ruinous Vallum than to erect it upon ground that was entirely clear and there is not at present the least evidence of such a Vallum yet it seems hard to suppose that the mound of earth has been every where so entirely removed as to leave no visible remains of it any where along the whole tract of the wall Again Se∣verus's wall passes over large spaces where the erecting of an earthen rampart seems almost impracticable in some places it passes for a con∣siderable way along the tops of precipices and sometimes down the steep declivities of a bare rock and in these places there is no ditch In one place too the wall is carried through a small morass near Blea∣tarn in Cumberland Here it is presumed the foundation is formed by piles of wood but Hadrian's work shuns it and runs at ten chains distance from the wall of Severus No circumstances appear in the two works of Severus's wall and Hadrian's Vallum that argue them to be done at the same time or to have any necessary relation one to the other The constant parallelism of the north Vallum the ditch and the two southern Vallums of Hadrian's work is a shrewd argument of their mutual relation but this parallelism does not hold in the wall of Severus Where they are most distant there are no visible branches of any military way leading from one to the other whereby the com∣munication between them might be more easily preserved In some places there is a morass between the two walls which must make a retreat from one wall to the other inconvenient and is improper for a body of men to stand on The military way that now attends Severus's wall is agreed to have been made at the same time with the wall itself if then Hadrian's principal Vallum was on the same ground where the wall of Severus has stood how comes it to pass that there has been no military way accompanying it If Hadrian's work is supposed to have been designed for a defence against an attack from the south dif∣ficulties of the same kind will arise perhaps not easy to be removed for sometimes the advantageous ground is left on the south where it might easily have been otherwise ordered if their design had been only  to secure themselves against assailants from the south and the course of their fortification had not been previously determined by some other rule In one place the Vallum runs between higher ground on each side Besides if it was designed against an enemy from the south the ditch is on the wrong side being to the north of two ramparts and why may we not suppose the most southerly rampart to have been either a slight fence against an attack from the south or an interior defence to retreat to if the ditch should be carried by an assault from the north There was no occasion to draw such a line of defence in order to pre∣vent their making an attack upon the Stations for they are stronger on all sides than this Vallum It is to be observed that at each end of the wall Severus's work is continued beyond Hadrian's This part then of Severus's wall at least was not erected upon Hadrian's Vallum and yet Mr Horsley says he see no difference between the appearance of this work here and in the other parts of it  The legionary soldiers were the persons employed in building this wall as they were generally in all considerable works of this nature and that the three Legions which were at that time in Britain built Antoninus's wall in Scotland is clear from a great number of inscrip∣tions found in that wall which expressly declare it The th Legion had no concern in building the wall of Severus it was wholly done by the other two namely the  Legio Secunda Augusta  and  Legio Sexta Victrix  for these Legions only as far as appears erected the inscriptions which will be given in the course of this work If therefore Cohorts the number in two Legions built the whole wall it will be easy to deter∣mine the share which belonged to each Cohort for there being Cas∣tella upon the whole wall and so milliary intervals just four of these intervals would fall to the share of every cohort It may not be amiss to try how far we can find out the several Cohorts belonging to the respective Legions and on what part of the wall each Legion and Cohort seems to have been employed  If we divide the wall into four equal parts the st and d quarters reckoning from the east seem to have been built by the  Legio Secunda Augusta  and the d and last by the  Legio Sexta Victrix  for at the east end of the wall we have express mention of the  Legio Secunda Augusta  in the stone at Denton which is about six miles from the end of it and we have six if not seven Cohorts of this Legion mentioned in those centurial stones found in this quarter  viz  I II III V VIII IX besides there  is a seeming appearance of the th at Wallbottle This quarter reaches near to Halton Sheels or to the next Castellum east of it which is above two miles east of Halton Chesters In the second quarter which reaches from hence to the second Castellum west of the Housesteeds we have the  Legio Sexta Victrix  on a centurial stone about four or five miles from the beginning of this quarter and at Housesteeds and Little Chesters just at the end of it the same legion is mentioned upon two altars and two bricks but the  Legio Secunda Augusta  does not occur in this space at least not on any stone that can be relied on There are no Cohorts upon any stones in this place distinct and visible except the th and th but no doubt several others have been mentioned upon the many stones found here though the numbers are now quite effaced In the third quarter which reaches to Old Wall near Watch Cross in the county of Cumberland we have  Legio Secunda Augusta  mentioned again several times Indeed the  Legio Sexta Victrix  occurs upon a stone in Cambeck fort but probably it has been inserted in the face of that fort when it was repaired upon some other occasion The Cohorts of this space are the st th th and th which I believe have all be∣longed to the  Legio Secunda Augusta  In the last quarter which I believe was built by the  Legio Sexta Victrix  I meet with no centurial stones except one at Drawdikes which seems to have belonged to a cohort of another kind The  Legio Sexta Victrix  is upon fine stone at Carlisle but no particular Cohorts appear in this space  Julius Caesar when he made his first descent upon Britain brought over only two Legions with him which were the th and th This latter was his favourite legion and both together made but an army of foot at the most The horse belonging to these legions never reached this island and the foot the same year were transported back again to Gaul  The next year when Caesar made his second descent he brought over five Legions with him and horse which seem to be all the horse that belonged to these Legions There is nothing in the history whereby it can be known what Legions these were except the th which is mentioned by Caesar These likewise returned back again to Gaul the same year in which they came over as the two Legions had done the year before  During the three succeeding reigns of Augustus Tiberius and Cali∣gula it is plain the Romans had no footing in Britain  Under Claudius who applied himself in good earnest to the reduction of Britain a considerable army was sent to this island the Emperor himself afterwards coming over in person This army consisted of Ro∣man Legions and other Auxiliaries though the historians have not told us expressly what they were either as to their number or names but considering the small success of Julius Caesar before and the much greater conquests this army made it is highly reasonable to suppose it was superior in number to the greater of Caesar's which consisted if the Legions were compleat of above men It is presumed that the army sent over by Claudius consisted of four Legions with their proper auxilia and the usual number of horse belonging both to one and the other and this army so composed would amount to more than men Any conjecture as to the number or names of the auxi∣liary Cohorts must be uncertain and doubtful but both the number and names of the Legions may be certainly collected from some inci∣dental passages of Tacitus They were the second called Augusta the th th and the th usually called Valens Victrix each of which are mentioned in the inscriptions inserted in this work  As we have no evidence from history that any new Legions were transported by Nero but that the same continued which had been sent over at first by Claudius so it is plain from the relation of the battle with Queen Boadicea that the four Legions last mentioned were here under Nero in whose reign this battle happened for according to Ta∣citus's account of this matter the th Legion was surprized and de∣stroyed by this Queen The th and the Vexillarii of the th were in the battle and the second though in Britain was absent from the fight through the fault of  Poenius Posthumus  their Commander who fell upon his own sword when he heard of the glory the troops had acquired in that engagement  Of these four Legions one continued very late and another to the last The Legio XX VV though it continued very long here yet it seems to have been recalled before the Romans had entirely abandoned the island for it is not mentioned in the Notitia The  Legio Secunda Augusta  is mentioned there and so seems to have continued here to the last and to have been the only one that was kept here during the whole time for though the  Legio Sexta Victrix  did also continue to the last yet this came not over till the reign of the Emperor Hadrian The ninth  Legion seems to have dwindled away entirely or else the small remains of it were incorporated with the Legion sent over by Hadrian  It is remarkable that the Legions which continued long in Britain seem for the most part to have been jointly employed in carrying on the most considerable works or wars that have been in this island Thus they were jointly engaged in building the wall in Scotland and most or all of them in erecting those in the north of England and the Le∣gions and legionary Cohorts seem to have been the only soldiers who were employed usually in erecting forts or raising fences Auxiliary Cohorts appear by inscriptions to have been concerned in some other buildings but forts and fences seem to have been the province of the Legionaries agreeable to that passage in Tacitus  the Praefectus Castro∣rum and legionary Cohorts who had been left among the Silures for erecting fortifications  Thus among all the inscriptions found upon the Roman wall in Scotland there is but one that mentions any aux∣iliary Cohort as having a hand in the work but always either a Legion or a Vexillation of a Legion And I take it for granted that all the centurial inscriptions upon the face of the wall in the north of England and which probably were inserted there at the time of building it re∣spect only the Legions and legionary Cohorts and yet the Stations upon the wall as well as most of them elsewhere were garrisoned by the Auxiliaries The  Legio Secunda Augusta  came into Britain in the reign of Claudius under the command of Vespasian and continued in it as long as the Romans had the least footing here In Hadrian's time this Le∣gion was in Cumberland at Netherby and Beaucastle and in the western side of Northumberland and so probably had their share in the work of Hadrian's Vallum or when in the advanced Stations of Ne∣therby and Beaucastle they might be posted there to secure those who were employed in that work In the beginning of the reign of Anto∣ninus Pius they were most probably upon the eastern part of the Roman wall in Northumberland In Severus's time it is very probable they were employed upon the wall that goes by his name  The  Legio Sexta Victrix  is usually thus expressed LEG VI V to which is often added P F that is Pia fidelis for that it is to be read so rather than Pia felix It is certain from a great number of inscrip∣tions and other testimonies that this Legion was a long time in Britain and it is equally certain that it came not over so soon as the others The account of this Legion whilst in Britain must be taken chiefly from  such hints as ancient inscriptions afford us I do not find it is men∣tioned in any inscription belonging to the southern parts of this island It is probable that they made no stop in the south but marched directly by the usual rout to the west end of the Vallum and had their share in raising that work We have several inscriptions on the wall and near it in Northumberland and Cumberland wherein this Legion is mentioned as at Stanwicks Cambeck fort Burdoswald Little Chesters Housesteeds and other places some of which from the character and other circumstances may be supposed as ancient as Hadrian's reign the most of them do certainly belong to the time of Severus In the former part of the reign of Antoninus Pius they were in Scotland and had their share in building the wall there Probably they marched along our Watlingstreet in the north either to Scotland or from it or both and in their march the sepulchral inscription might be erected for a sol∣dier of this Legion which was found near Richester in Northumberland Whether this Legion had taken up its stated quarters at York before the reign of Antoninus Pius and continued there between the time of building the Vallum and their march into Scotland I cannot certainly determine however after their return from Scotland and about the middle of Antoninus Pius's reign they were settled at York for Pto∣lemy places them there and there I believe they statedly quartered till the very last though they marched at a distance from this place upon special occasions Thus for instance this Legion was certainly em∣ployed upon the stone wall of Severus as appears from several of the centurial inscriptions found on that wall which bear the name of this Legion perhaps several of its Cohorts might be dispersed into some neighbouring Stations though York was still the place of its stated quar∣ters Thus according to Mr Gale's conjecture by the  Legio Gordiana  in the inscriptions at Lanchester in the county of Durham we are to understand the  Legio Sexta Victrix  The first Cohort of this Legion must then in all probability have been detached at that time from the Legion at York to assist in building the works mentioned in these inscriptions This was in the reign of Gordian and so after this Legion was settled at York  The Legion called Valeria or Valeriana according to some or Valens Victrix according to most is another of these Legions which were at the first sent over into Britain by Claudius In the Roman inscriptions it is thus expressed LEG XX VV but Critics and Antiquaries are not well agreed in reading the former V some will have it to stand for Valens  and others for Valeria or Valeriana The motions and employments of this Legion seem to have been much the same with the  Legio Secunda Augusta  It is probable they were jointly concerned in erecting Ha∣drian's Vallum though we have no inscriptions to prove it That this Legion was employed in building the Roman wall in Scotland under Antoninus Pius is clear from several inscriptions found on the wall mentioning this Legion or their Vexillatio and the quantity of the wall which they built If the altar found at Benwell fort was erected by a Centurion of this Legion at the same time as the other was by a Centu∣rion of the  Legio Secunda Augusta  this legion must probably have been thereabout in the former part of Antoninus Pius's reign either doing somewhat upon Hadrian's Vallum or in their march against the Cale∣donians  One would expect that this Legion bore its part in building Seve∣rus's wall but among all the centurial inscriptions upon the face of this wall there is not one of this Legion or of any Cohort said to be∣long to it and yet it appears by an inscription that this Legion was employed in some work at the Station at Whitley Castle the ancient Alone or Alione  In the beginning of the fifth century about the year Theodosius the Second when but two years old was made Emperor and joined to Arcadius and Honorius This Theodosius reigned half a century and it is evident that in his reign the Romans quite abandoned this island It must have been much about this time those usurpers started up in Britain Echard says  the inhabitants and troops that were quartered in Britain fearing least the Vandals should pass over the sea and subdue them with the rest revolted from their obedience to Honorius and set up one Mark whom they declared Emperor but they soon deprived him of his life and dignity and placed Gratian in his room who was a countryman of their own Within four months they murdered him too and conferred the sovereignty upon one Constantine not so much in respect to his courage or quality for he was a very inconsiderable man in the army but in regard to his name which they looked on as fortunate hoping he would do as much as Constantine the Great had done who was of the same name and had been advanced to the imperial dignity in the same island This new prince immediately after his promotion passed over into Gaul and taking with him the very flower of the British  youth so utterly exhausted the military force of the island that it was wholly broken and the island left naked to new invaders  Britain being thus drained and exhausted both of the Roman soldiers and its own youth was according to Gildas and Bede after him much harrassed by the Picts and Scots and other invaders upon which they applied to the Romans for help who sent a Legion to their assist∣ance But the last certain account of the Romans' footing in Britain I believe is in the Notitia if it hold true that this part of it which re∣lates to Britain was wrote before the middle of the fifth century or under the reign of Theodosius the Second at which time the Roman force was much abated though their soldiers were not yet finally with∣drawn from Britain for besides a considerable number of auxiliary forces there were yet two Legions at least remaining in this island and the Romans seem still to have been in possession of that part of the island which lays to the South of Severus's wall though of no part beyond it The Stations upon the wall were well garrisoned at that time but ex∣cepting the Kentish coast and the northern frontiers the garrisons in the other parts of Britain were very thin and widely dispersed and the rest of England was entirely naked On the other hand it is certain to use Echard's words that under the reign of Valentinian the Third  Africk Spain Great Britain and almost all Gaul Germany and Illyricum were dismembered from the western Empire  Now Valen∣tinian the Third began to reign with Theodosius about the year and died in so that we may safely affirm that in the beginning of the fifth century the Roman Power was become low in Britain and near the middle of that century the Romans had entirely quitted the island  I have dwelt long on this subject Mr Warburton in his preface says  All antiquaries that I have conversed with who have made the ac∣customed tour of Europe allow the Picts Wall to be the most superb remains of Roman grandeur that is now to be seen on this side the Alps" And he adds "The venerable remains of Monasteries and Castles with other Monuments of Antiquity are not to be equalled in any nation or country whatsoever  From the Manuscripts of the late Roger Gale  Esq  Extract of a Letter from  Mr John Horsley  to  Roger Gale  Esq  th March  Had we an accurate  Map of England  and a faithful and impartial account of matter of fact where there are stations and military ways and where there are

at a loss  This was the method I took in the  northern counties  first to be well assured from occular demonstration where there were any visible remains or certain proofs of Roman settlements and

you my hearty thanks for it I am sorry that you who have so many af∣fairs upon your hands should give yourself the least concern to make a speedy return to mine I only beg leave to communicate to you any thing that occurs and that you would at any time honour me with a line or two at your convenience and leisure  I have nothing more to add with relation to the  antiquated Cup  unless it be to beg leave to ask whether the size shape and loose bottom if any at all  The bottom which had been of thinner metal than the rest was con∣sumed and worn out by time and rust  R G  favour its being a common  Patera  If it be admitted a  Pa∣tera  I despair of seeing any conjecture more plausible and ingenious than your own  I have sent you inclosed a hasty sketch of my scheme concerning  the Stations ad Lineam Valli  that you may better understand what I have said with respect to the places mentioned on this scale your great candour will excuse any marks of haste and inadvertence I take the stations rigorously upon the line of the wall to end with  Tunocellum  and other five to have been a kind of secondary series proceeding regularly from east to west viz  Glanoventa  Lanchester  Alone  Whitley Castle confirmed by an old inscription  Brementuracum  Bramp∣ton if not Old Perith  Olenacum  Old Carlisle and  Virosidum  Elenborough or if we sup∣pose a transposition of the two last places then  Virosidum  may be Old Carlisle upon the river  Wiza  and  Olenacum  Elenborough upon the river  Elen  I hope to get all the stones that have been discovered at  Riechester  into my possession and then I shall reexamine them all with the greatest care and attention I can and if I discover any thing more I shall be sure to acquaint you with it  You must be right with respect to the  Vardii  and therefore I thank you again for having been my Apollo  The altar with the inscription DEAE SYRIAE is yet at  Connington  but the latter part of the inscription together with the upper stratum of the stone is quite gone I guessed it might be  Gallorum  but  Vardiorum  will suit the vacant interval better if that can be relied on as exactly represented  My representation of the inscription at  Lanchester  was not in my last so just as it ought to be  VARDIOR REQ  I cannot find the copy though I have sought for it and therefore may not be exact in the position of the letters but the upper line which goes before in the inscription is upon one piece of an  altar  and the lower line with the following part on another piece that was lying se∣parate from the other when I put them together they tallied with so much seeming exact∣ness that I concluded they had made one and the same  altar  but if we suppose them to have been fragments of two different  altars  the difficulty you mention will entirely vanish  I am much obliged to you for your account of the  Military Ways  if I can make any im∣provements upon it I shall presume to communicate them to you  Salmon  I have but found it was not safe to follow or trust him too far  I think it was in the  Monthly Atlas  that I read of a Roman inscription at  St John's chapel at Shattesbury  in the wall but though I use that author as

temporary defence cast up for a small force of modern date and in no wise resembling those which fortified an ancient camp  THIRLWALL CASTLE  is seated on the edge of a rock above the little river Tippal a dark and melancholy fortress much in ruin It may be called with pro∣priety the stronghold rather than seat of the family of Thirlwalls  John de Thirlwall King Edward III  Robert Queen Elizabeth  Eleanora married Matthew Swinburn  Esq  Wallis  It was vaulted within and defended by a strong wall without The  THRILWALL CASTLE  floor of one of the apartments was lately cleared and discovered to be of singular construction consisting of three tiers of flags laid upon stratas of sand Some of the walls are nine feet thick the casing in many places has been taken away to erect the adjoining tenements The builder has even been afraid of the light for the apertures are no larger than those in the staircases of ancient castles The whole carries the appearance of a horrid gloomy dungeon where its ancient tyrants dealt in deeds of darkness The last of the Thirlwall family Eleanora sold this castle with its demesnes to the Earl of Carlisle  Under the south front of this castle the Roman wall crosses the Tip∣pal and stretches up the opposite eminences The name of Thirlwall by some authors has been derived from those breaches made in the wall by the Scots in their incursions  Spelman's calculation of the Roman forces stationed on the wall makes them amount to the number allowing to a cohort exclusive of a whole legion and detachments of horse and foot on other stations and attendants on the Emperor Constantine created an officer stiled "Comes Spectabilis Litoris Saxonici" who commanded seven companies of foot two troops of horse the second legion and a cohort to guard the coasts In the reign of Nero some authors alledge the Roman army in Britain consisted of  Ph Trans No  In passing down the road below Thirlwall Castle we perceived a large stone lay in the way which bore marks of the sculptor We had curiosity to examine it and found it the head of a Colossian statue measuring in circumference near five feet cut on a ragstone It seemed to appertain to some statue of Jupiter and probably was rolled down the steeps from CarrVoran and lodged in the river Tippal  A mile from Thirlwall lays  WARDREW  famous for its Spaw The waters have been analized and require not my pen to repeat their virtues so well known to the public The con∣veniences for a few visitors are narrow but commodious enough the situation is retired not much of the romantic the walks are solemn and the whole scene befits a mind that carries its ideas and meditations  to distant regions for there are few objects present which either ele∣vate or entertain Calmness and tranquillity are the effects such same∣ness of subject insinuates to the mind and indolence with that degree of ease stiled negligence succeed to take the place of pleasure  We now proceeded by the military road and made a little excursion to the left to  WALLTOWN  formerly the seat of the Ridleys part of the ruins of the old castle re∣maining Travellers are shewn a well among the cliffs where it is said Paulinus baptized King Egbert  Wallis  but it is more probable it was Edwin King of Northumberland Such spectacles gratify the religious enthu∣siast who would be in transports on viewing this hallowed font  From thence to  GREAT CHESTERS  is little more than a mile the Vallum of this station is very distin∣guishable of an oblong square near the dimensions of CarrVoran the interior parts rugged from the ruins of many buildings In the course of the Notitia this station is called Aesica It was garrisoned by the Cohors Prima Astorum but no inscriptions have been found here that mention this or any other cohort  Great Chesters must be reckoned Mr Horsley says among the forts that have been well preserved the ramparts about it are very visible some part of the original stone wall is standing a good height the ditch is also to be seen on all sides but towards the east where it is somewhat flat On the west side there is a double Agger and ditch The ruins of the rampart on this side are very high several regular courses of stones are to be seen in this side of the rampart where the ruins have been cleared out The Praetorium is very visible being about yards from east to west and from north to south To this is joined another parallelogram at the east end of the same breadth with the Praetorium and yards from east to west This I take to have been the Questorum On the north side of the Praetorium are large ruins of some considerable building which probably was a temple On the south side of the fort has been a regular entry Part of the jambs and some other stones are remaining entire which may shew for what purpose such stones must have been which are found in other  Roman forts Some pieces of an iron gate and hinges have been found in the ruins not long ago From this gate there goes a paved military way to Hadrian's Vallum which is distant about chains which way is also continued till it joins the other military way The outbuildings are most considerable on the south side though there are also some on the east There are vast ruins of buildings in this field which as usual has a gentle descent and is open to the south  The distance between this station and Little Chesters the next in my rout is about three miles and three quarters and here again all the Castella are visible being four in number besides one more which seems to have fallen in with the station at Great Chesters The interval here again between the Castella is seven furlongs  A little to the west of Great Chesters near a house called Cockmount Hill the Picts wall begins again to ascend the rocks From Great Chesters to this place the ditch is but faint except for two or three chains where it is distinct  A little to the west of Walltown and between that and CarrVoran there is a part of the wall which is in the greatest perfection of any now remaining in the whole track it is about three yards high as I before observed has about regular courses and at one part of the facing stones entire  As for Hadrian's Vallum it is visible all the way till it comes near CarrVoran It passes near Low Town just on the south of it and particularly the vallum or rampart on the south brink of the ditch is here very visible Mr Horsley says he was informed there were the ruins of some Roman works at Low Town but upon viewing them nothing like it appeared They look he says somewhat like the houses of Moss Troopers which seems confirmed by what Camden says  that he durst venture no further this way for fear of them  He mentions CarrVoran on the one side and Carraw on the other so that the two Ches∣ters and the Housesteads must have been the stations that he was afraid to visit  The distance between Great Chesters and CarrVoran is almost two miles and a quarter In this space there are three Castella and all of them visible  The remains of broken altars and some effigies are scattered on the eastern side of this station but of no significance to the antiquary as the inscriptions are totally obliteratedThe following fragment was dug up here and is thus given in Camden  I  CAS M AVR SEVE  RVS MECANDER PFE  AUG HORREVM VETV  STATE CO  AR SVMM  COH II ASTVRVM SA  A SOLO RESTITVERI

the same manner but his draw∣ing of the stone has a man's head above the inscription This might be sunk in the earth as the stone now serves for a gatepost and is reversed Dis manibus Aelio Mercuriali Corniculario Vacia soror fecit This is a funeral monument erected for Aelis Mercurialis by his sister Vacia A Cornicularius was an inferior officer under the Tribune Mention is made of the Cornicularius by M Laetorius Mergus the Tri∣bune by Valerius Maximus and Suetonius speaking of Orbilius the grammarian says "In Macedonio Corniculo mox equo meruit" The name of this officer is upon several monuments in Gruter and occurs frequently in the Notitia he was a kind of a clerk or secretary and in the lower times of the empire he was rather of higher rank or quality than before  Camden says this was the second Station of the Dalmatians called in the old book of Notices MAGNA and that Sir Robert Cotton took from hence the two following inscriptions  PRO SALUTE  DESIDIENIAE  LIANI PRE  ET SVA S  POSVIT VOT  AO SOLVIT LIBE  NS TVSCO ET BASSO  COSS  From these consular names the date of this inscription is in the christian aera  DEAE SVRI  AE SVB CALP  VRNIO AG  ICOLA LEG AVG  PR PR A LICINIVS  LEMENS PRAEF  IIIAIOR  This by some antiquaries is supposed to be dedicated to the Syrian goddess Astarte Mr Horsley has objected to Camden's reading but Dr Stukeley in his Carausius thinks it is con∣firmed by the altar in Mr Graham  s collection at Netherby inscribed to that goddess in the Greek character and language  Cohortis primae Hamiorum  Camden gives the following reading Deae Suriae sub Calphurnio Agricola Legato Augusti Propretore Licinius Clemens Prefect Unto the goddess Suria under Calphurinus Agricola Lieutenant of Augustus and Propraetor Licinius Clemens the Captain This Calphurinus Agri∣cola was sent by Antoninus philosopher against the Britons about the year of our Lord at which time some cohort under his command erected this altar Mr Horsley has treated of this inscription as being found at Little Chesters under which head I have inserted it in the notes Lucian describes the goddess Suria with a turretted crown on her head a tabor in her hand set in a car drawn by lions This was the favourite divinity of Nero till he grew so weary of his devo∣tions that as the translator of Camden has it  he defiled her with his urine  Besides the inscriptions before mentioned Mr Horsley's work contains the following  LXI Dis man  bus dicatum Sabinae Hinae Regulus Duilius  The inscription itself is thought to be sepulchral and I have given a reading of it suitable to this opinion But I must own that the seemingly plain appearance of an O at the first rather than a D and the manifest deficiency in the stone and inscription at the beginning of the lines have raised a strong jealousy in me that it has been I O M D for Jovi Optimo Max  mo dicatum though i  this be the truth I know not why the following name Sabini or Sab  ae should be in the ge  ive The last word is uncertain and very probably the greater part of the inscription is broken off for otherwise the plane of the altar does not seem to bear any  proportion to the capital The figures at the top are so much defaced that I know not what to make of them The first looks almost like a toad which we find upon another altar or two in this collection the other perhaps is a dog or wolf but very obscure Mr Wa  b  rtes imagining this inscription to have some reference to the Ae  Sabinia  because of the word Sabin  e as I suppose concludes this  ce to be Hunnum  Now in the Dean and Chapter's Library at Durham  LXIII  Not far from Great Chesters near a wicket or hatch at Cockmount Hill lies a curious sculpture exposed to all the injuries of the weather by which and barbarous hands it has suffered too much already Mr Gordon was the first I believe who discovered or took any notice of it but his draught has several defects in it the most considerable of which is the omission of the two eagles on whose wings the victories stand that support the vexillum each eagle rests upon the branch of a tree and the boar on the right plainly appears to take hold of the stock of the tree on that side as if he endeavoured to tear it up the other boar at∣tacks the vexillum and lays hold of the tree on which the other eagle is perched with both his feet I think there can be no doubt but the boars and trees were designed to repre∣sent this wild and woody country as it then was and the Roman ensigns often signify a Roman settlement this sculpture therefore plainly denotes the Roman conquest of this coun∣try their victories over the inhabitants and their making a settlement here in opposition to all the attempts of their enemies The heads of the eagles are both broken off but the rest of them is very distinct  LXIV Centuria cohortis Septimae Maximiana posuit  Under this number are expressed two centurial stones now placed in the sore wall of a cowhouse adjoining to a house called Allaley almost half way between Great Chesters and CarrVoran One has the centurial mark and the number of the cohort tolerably plain the name of the century is obscure but it must I think been Maximiana Nothing more is certain about the other but that it has been erected by some cohort or century  LXIV Centuria Valerii Maximi  This is of the common centurial kind and has nothing remarkable in it it was found at a small rivulet called Haltwhistle Burn near Great Chesters  An urn was also found at this mill  We passed a monument on the left hand placed on a hill consisting of three large erect stones or pillars two of which seem broken off in the midst They are called the Mare and her Foals appearing to be monuments of some memorable action and not druidical as has been conjectured their figure and position in no wise corresponding with any monuments of the Druids  At a little distance from the Chesters and ne  the th mile stone are four Tumuli placed in a square figure which Mr Wallis says were cut through by one Curry a dissenting minister whose curiosity dis∣turbed the ashes of the dead reaping nothing but the Salina which had consecrated the remains of the interred without being able from this undertaking to discover to what age or people these monuments ap∣pertained  Mr Wallis has the following remarks on the Interment of the Antients  The Romans were not very careful to separate the human ashes from the rest but some∣times put coals and other things into the urn Their urns were of gold silver and other metal of glass stone and marble but most generally of potters earth Trajan's was of gold They were of all figures but commonly round and bellied those of metal generally  embellished with sculpture and bass relief Urns for persons of distinction were either set under marble monuments or in niches of sepulchral chambers Severus provided his be∣fore his death it is said to have been of porphyry or of alabaster The ashes of persons of quality were usually sprinkled with wine before they were collected into an urn  Postquam collapsi cineres et flamma quievit  Riliquias vino et bibulam lavere favillam  Assaque lecta cado texit Chorinaeus aheno  Virg Aen  Soon as the pile subsiding flames no more  With wine the heap they sprinkled o'er  Then Chorinaeus took the charge to place  The bones selected in a brazen vase  Pitt  Salt was used in their solemn sacrifices as well as in urn burial  Dant fruges manibus salsas  Virg Aen  Urn burial is not so ancient as the present mode of interment burning the dead is first attributed to the Greeks and Herculus is said to be the first of the Greeks who used it This he did to free himself from the obligation of an oath He had sworn to bring back a youth to his father from the siege of Troy and he had no way of doing it but by presenting him with his ashes From the Greeks this custom passed to the Romans but it was not general among them From the authority of Pliny it appears that it was not used in many families and that Sylla the Dictator was the first of the Cornelii whose body was burnt which is the reason assigned by Antiquaries why we find Roman bones both burnt and unburnt It was the choice of some because they would preserve their bodies from the resentment of their enemies Th  s probably was Sylla's motive It is supposed the Gauls had it from the Ro∣mans the Celtics or ancient Brito  s from the Gauls but it is not so easily accounted for how the Danes and other nations called Juli and Angli Saxons and Germans came by it It is believed they had it from the Graecian customs and learning and that they all laid it aside on the introduction of Christianity  To distinguish which are Roman Danish or British Tumuli has been observed to be diffi∣cult Some Antiquaries pretend to fix them from their shape but that is reckoned guesswork unless inscriptions arms or coins be found in them the latter of gold silver or copper but neither of them of brass Instruments and coins of that metal belonging to the northern nations and where they are found in Tumuli unquestionably Roman they are sup∣posed to have been taken from the enemy and thrown into it in honour of the deceased The Roman Tumuli were cespititious or mounts of earth like those here Such was Hector's  viridi cespite  Virg Such was Dercennus's "terreno ex aggere bustom" Virg Such was that made by Aeneas  "Pius Aeneas ingenti mole sepulchrum  "Imponet suaque arma viro remumque tubamque  "Monte sub aërio"  Virg  No greater misfortune could happen to a Roman than to be denied the "Hono  Tumuli" the "Solamen Humandi" The Atheist Mezentius could not die in peace without begging it of his enemy with his last breath  Corpus humo patiaro legi  Et me consortem nati concede sepulchro  Virg  If a vanquish'd foe this grace may crave  Oh let me find the refuge of a grave  guard my coarse and lay me by my son  Grant grant that pleasure ere I yield my breath  To share this dear society in Death  Pitt  WILLIMOTESWICK  laying at a little distance induces the traveller to quit his direct road This was the ancient house of the Ridleys from whence descended many eminent men amongst whom was Nicholas Ridley Bishop of London who suffered at Oxford with Bishop Latimer Oct also Lancelot Ridley D D Fellow of King's Hall Cambridge and the great Civilian Sir Thomas Ridley Knt L L D  From thence we passed to  LITTLE CHESTERS  a small Roman station laying on the western side of Bardon Burn now called the Bowers on account of the trees which cover it It doth not contain above three acres of land in its inclosure the Vallum of which is very distinguishable forming an oblong square with obtuse angles  The Via Vacinalis from CarrVoran to Walwick Chesters passeth close by its northern side near which a Roman military guide stone is stand∣ing and at a mile west another and again another mile further west a third in a direct line These stones are cylindrical six feet four inches in circumference and near six feet above ground On one of these is the following inscription BONO REIpVBLICAE NATO the letters large and coarse No doubt this was a compliment to the Emperor then reigning and not an uncommon one  Little Chesters was the Vindolana of the Romans where the Legio Sexta Victrix kept garrison as also the Cohors Quarta Gallorum as the inscriptions found here prove  Mr Horsley's description of this station is as follows  This station is south from both the walls near a mile and three quarters but stands on the military way before mentioned which is very visible for a considerable space from this station so that Little Chesters must be reckoned among those which belong to the wall it being in this rout and the only military way which belongs to it coming from the wall and returning to it  There are two or three Forts more as CarrVoran and Cambeck Fort detached to the south of the wall though none so far as this yet this is not above half a mile from Hadrian's Vallum  This is one of the least Stations on the wall It is only seven chains long from north to south and four broad from east to west The ramparts are visible quite round and very large but the ditch is near filled up The town or outbuildings here have been chiefly to the west and southwest of the fort there being a small brook to the southeast and a descent from the Station to it The Praetorium may be distinguished and there seems to have been some towers at the corners of the fort and perhaps two in the sides of the ramparts  Severus's wall which keeps upon the precipices all the way is al∣most at a mile distant from this Station  The Royal Society received a few years ago some Roman Sandals found here A Roman Hypocaustum or Sudatory was discovered here of which Dr Hunter gave the following description  It was a square room vaulted above and paved with large square stones set in lime under which was a lower apartment supported by rows of square pil∣lars about half a yard highthe upper room had flues in the walls then open and appearing as niches the pavement and roof were tinged with smoak  These sudatories from this description were certainly heated by flues in the wall like the modern stoves Mr Horsley speaking of it says it looks very like a Balneum with the Hy∣pocaustum below it and somewhat of this nature I saw at Lanchester and Risingham at the latter place it was not far from the Praetorium An engraving is given by Mr Horsley of a sculpture found here the principal figure of which represents Mercury He gives the following description of it Mercury is represented with his  caduceus  in his left hand and  purse  in his right Above his right arm is somewhat like a  petasus  or perhaps a cap of liberty The head of the figure and upper part of the stone is broken and confused so that we cannot be certain whether or no Mercury has had his  petasus  on If we could be sure that he was here represented as wearing his  petasus  on his head I should then have thought it more probable that this other figure was the cap of liberty Mercury's loose and flying  chlamys  is visible and beside him an altar with this inscription upon it DEO  MERCVRIO A Camillus lays the incense on the altar Mercury is usually represented with a juvenile briskness according to the poet's description  Omnia Mercurio similis vocemque coloremque  Et crines flavos et membra decora juvente  Virg Aen IV  It is well known what sort of people were peculiarly devoted to Mer∣cury "Callidum quicquid placuit jocoso condere furto" Hor Carm Whether the ancient inhabitants of this part had the same disposition with their posterity who dwelt hereabouts in Camden's time and to whom we owe the good laws for preventing of theft upon the northern borders I shall not determine  Mr Warburton presented this stone to the Royal Society in whose Musaeum it now is  It is observable that the trading inhabitants of this country held a solemn festival to Mercury on the th of October  A centurial stone now at Ridley Hall was found at this Station inscribed  IMP CAES TRAIAN  HADRIANI AVG  LEG II AVG  A PLATORIO NEPOTE LEG PR PR  A large stone lately found here now placed in a field at Archy Flat as a rubbingstone for cattle is rudely sculptured with the figure of a deer under the shade of a tree with two fauns at his feet This seems to have been an ornament to some small temple of Diana which per∣haps stood near this place as pilasters and capitals of the Doric order were dug up some few years ago with multitudes of stags horns the remains of the sacrifices to that goddess on the th of August when the hunters held their festival and offered the devoted stag  Besides the inscriptions already mentioned Mr Horsley's Work has the several following ones  LII Gallorum vota numini ejus Principis Optimi turribus fundamenta posuerunt sub Claudio Xenophonte Legato Augustali Propraetore curante  Great numbers of inscriptions have been found here but most of them are now lost or de∣stroyed there is one which seems to have been the most curious and useful the inscription whereof is now quite destroyed This stone was some years ago removed from Little Chesters to Beltingham where the masons wrought it up for a gravestone and utterly destroyed the inscription  Dr Hunter published the inscription in the Philosophical Transactions No from the orig  al  the inscription is curious and useful upon a double account both as it has probably contained the name of the C  hors Quarta Gallorum and so proves this place to be Vindolana and al  o it seems to me to mention a new Propraetor Claudius Xenophon whose name I re∣member not to have met with elsewhere either in the inscriptions or history for I am per∣suaded that the three last words in the fifth line have been LEG AVG PR PR and what is wanting in the last l  ne has been the name of the person who took care of the work The to  rs here mentioned might be some of those upon the ramparts of the Station which are still very v  sible Dr Hunter says the field where this inscription was found goes by the name of the Bower The title Optimo Principi together with the name of a new Legate who does not occur in any hi  tory would incline me to ascribe the monument to Trajan during whose reign the Roman historians are silent as to Britain but as there is nothing in this inconsistent with several of the succeeding reigns and it is doubted whether the Romans had any consi∣derable footing here in Trajan's time we cannot fix the date of this inscription with any certainty  The two following inscriptions Camden places at Great Chesters In these notes I follow Mr Horsley's course and numbers for the sake of the reader's readier reference to his works  LIII Deae Su  suo Calpornio Agricola Legato Augustali Propraetore Aulus Licinius Cle∣mens Praefectus C  hortis Primae Hamiorum vel Cohortis Quartae Gallorum  It is plain from Camden's own account of his journey that he went no further along the wall eastward than a little beyond CarrVoran The altar now before us was erected to the Syrian goddess Lucian among the ancients and Selden among the moderns have professedly treated on the subject of this deity and Sir Isaac Newton says it is one of the names of Venus It is very certain that what is physically the same is often represented by several deities and the same deity has several names considered under different relations or as confering different benefits Thus Cybele Ceres Ve  ta Rhea and Tellus all signify the earth and Dea Syria is only another of Cybele  s names who is usually called the mother of the gods The like may be said of Apollo and several others As for the inscription the letters in the first line and CALP in the second and part of the AG in the third are yet very plain and distinct though the rest of it s  ce Camden's time is entirely gone together with the outer or upper Stratum of this part of the stone deeper than the cut of the letters which obliges me to take most of the inscription from Camden  s copy and this I have observed to happen frequently when the inscription is cut along the plane of the Stratum but when it is cut across or through the several Strata the letters are more lasting and much better secured and thus the Romans u  y cut their inscriptions There is at the end of the first line something like a cross which Camden has omitted but with what design this was done I am unable to say Calphurnius Ag  was Propraetor or Lieutenant here under Marcus Aurelius The inscription confirms and il  u  trates the historian's testimony  Adversus Brittannos quidem Calphurnius Agricola m  ssus e  t  Capitol in Vet Script Hist Aug p as this determines the time or at least the reign under which this altar was erected What Cohort this Licinius Clemens com∣manded is not so clear to me from the inscription I know some read it Cohors Prima Hami∣orum at large and have so represented it but this I doubt has been mere conjecture it is plain that the letters in the last line are not placed at a due distance and that the letters on each side  should be farther removed from the four and the same room which is sufficient for Harniorum will do as well or better for Gallorum and I cannot but suspect this to be the true reading The former inscription favours this conjecture and so I read it at first sight of the copy with∣out considering where it was found If this conjecture should be admitted this inscription does further confirm the Station at Little Chesters to be Vindolana  LIV Pro salute Desidieni Aeliani Praefecti et sua sacrum posuit voto solvit lib  ns Tusco Basso Consulibus  This after the authority of Camden I also presented to the reader as belonging to Great Chesters  It is an altar erected by some person whose name is not expressed for the safety of Desidienus Aelianus the Praefect and for his own  The letters are but meanly cut and of the later and ruder form There is a small break in the right side of the altar whereby a letter or two is defaced but the rest still continues legible I think voto in the fifth line must be ex voto as usual and then there is no difficulty as to the meaning The writing part of the word libens upon the plane of the altar and part upon the base is observable but the S for sacrum in the end of the fourth line is not uncommon The express date of this inscrip∣tion adds to its value namely when Tuscus and Bassus were Consuls that is according to Camden in the year but in the Fasti Consulares where the former name is Fuscus instead of Tuscus  LV Fortunae Populi Romani Caius Julius Raticus Centurio Legionis Sextae Victricis  To this place also belongs as I suppose that noble altar erected to the fortune of the Roman people by Cajus Julius I find no centurial mark in the inscription unless the C at the begin∣ning of the last line which Mr Gordon overlooked be supposed to stand for Centurio or else the mark before LEG through mistake turned the wrong way But I rather take this to be only a stop and the C to be the Praenomen of the person There is nothing very peculiar in manner of this inscription unless it be the humour of making the size of the letters in the diffe∣rent lines so very unequal  This altar is deposited in the Dean and Chapter's Library at Durham  LVI Legio Sexta Victrix  This is the impression of the Legio Sexta Victrix in the usual manner upon two Roman bricks which were found here  LVII Antoni Pio  This is an imperfect inscription upon the fragment of a very curious and beautiful stone the nature and grit of which is finer than usual and the remaining letters very fair and well cut I can only guess that the inscription may have been to the honour of one Antonines and that the word in the second line may have been Pio and perhaps Pra in the last for Praesectus  LX This is a small but fine stone and a curious sculpture It came from Little Chesters but is now in the jamb of a door at Ramshaw Field a single house about a mile or more southwest from this station It has not been observed or published before though it very well deserves a place in such a collection The sculpture manifestly represents a Roman Verillum with a Pegasus on one side and a Seagoat on the other and in the Vexillum an inscription in very small letters  III CH  VEXI  as I have given it The first line except the cross stroke of the H was very visible Vegetius tells us it was the ancient custom of the Romans to put the number of the Cohort or Cen∣tury upon the Vexillum which was a square piece of cloth fastened upon a transverse piece of wood This after Constantine had the name of Labarum  The reader will pardon a short digression which the subject of Roman Sacrifices necessarily leads me to When we read of piles of stags horns bones of sacrificed animals and such remains of religious acts or of  hecatombs and mighty slaughters which stained the altars of Roman devotees we might conceive the country abounded in cattle or the havoc and waste of such a profuse gift to the gods would endanger a famine The first impressions of the unlettered reader on these acts of devotion would mislead him into an idea that these sacrifices were only  a lavish destruction of animal beings under the irrational presumption that the gods delighted in the service of burning carcasses but by at∣tending to the ceremony we are relieved from this mistake and acquit this learned and polished people of such an error against common sense From national prejudices they had assigned persons to the attributes of the Great Creator whom they universally confessed and presumed to depict them as being distinct emanations from the supreme by the figures of Apollo Bacchus Pallas Ceres and all the multitude of their divine personages yet by the intelligent and wise the religious services paid to the images of those attributes were in fact and from the heart addressed to the God of Nature Seneca says  'tis of very little con∣sequence by what name you call  the first Nature  and the  Divine Rea∣son  which presides over the universe and fills all the parts of it he is still the same God He is called Jupiter Stator not as historians say because he stopped the flying armies of the Romans but because he is the constant support of all beingsthey call him Fate because he is the first Cause on which all others depend We Stoics sometimes call him Father Bacchus because he is the universal Life that animates natureHercules because his Power is invincibleMercury be∣cause he is the eternal Wisdom Order and Reasonyou may give him as many names as you please provided you allow  but one sole Principle  every where present  Thus if the Roman devotee peti∣tioned for success in war he resorted to the temple of Mars or raised to him an altar and so on through the chain of those images with which their pantheon was crowded  This error arose very early in the world and before letters commu∣nicated wisdom and science it is no wonder it prevailed almost univer∣sally among mankindthe eye carries images to the mind most imme∣diatelythe mind thus impressed was warmed into an energy which nothing but outward objects could convey to the ignorant Besides we find those personages who had rendered themselves important to their country and by their superior talents and virtues won the love of the people in commemoration of such their excellencies had their images erected and became representatives of the divine attributes Here we trace a strong influence to promote devotion the love borne to the very person whose image was so erected The danger to religion among the vulgar is obvious and was proved in the event the great architype was forgotten and the smoaky and inanimate statue became the idol of the vulgar worship  Let us now examine the sacrificial ritesThe altars which remain in Britain are chiefly formed of one stone like the pedestal of a column above the cornice are two rolls commonly called the horns of the altar the centre rises in a conical figure in which is an aperture wherein was placed the charcoal and embers for the ceremony These altars were fixed before the statue of the God to whom the devotee paid his rites or at the Ostium of the temple which during the time had its gates thrown open or otherwise they were erected in groves conse∣crated to the Divinity the Priest together with the devotee dressed in white garments emblematical of purity and innocence characteristics presumed most acceptable to heaven went foremost in the procession The animal ordered for sacrifice had its horns gilt or its forehead bound with white fillets decked with garlands and crowned with the leaves of that tree which it was supposed the Deity most affected but in fact that which was esteemed emblematical of the peculiar virtue of the Deity then addressed Several attendants walked in the procession amongst whom were the public Crier the Musicians the Aruspex or Diviner and all those whose office it was to slaughter and dress the animal As soon as the Victim was brought the Priest laying one hand on the horns of the altar began the ceremony with a most solemn and devout prayer either for the public weal or the private prosperity of the devotee offering sacrifice as the occasion required The sacred fire being placed in the aperture of the altar the Priest strewed corn and frankincense meal and salt upon the head of the animal then taking the Patera a shallow bason in which was contained the wine he touched it with his lips and after giving it to those who stood near him to do the same poured it between the horns of the beast then plucking some hair from between them he cast it into the fire and turning his face to the east drew his knife along the animal's spine from head to tail as the ensign or mark of consecration after which the inferior officers performed the slaughter The carcass being opened the Aruspex examined the intestines and if deformed deficient or dis∣eased he pronounced the omens inauspicious if on the contrary healthy and vigorous the heart large and the animal parts strong the in∣dications were propitious After this ceremony particular small parts were placed on the embers to occasion a pleasant savour and the rest was dressed for a solemn festival Here we view the ceremony in its proper light the sacrificial rites were no more than a public exhibition of the cattle given on some singular occasion when they were presented  before heaven with prayers the Priest imploring a blessing It is a doubt with me whether by men of enlightened minds whose un∣derstanding overlooked the idol and whose religion spiritually addressed the only true God these were not acts of piety and fervent devotion equal to most we find in this age  T  more places than  contemplating with amazement the  the  te and the  even of th  so that him  It could  of the military princi∣  all other people  The  the Gauls more strong truly  way they  be more vic  than o  nations but that they  re    D S  y's Ca  p  We have avoided Scylla and sunk in Charybdis To reform the abuses of the heathen world we have too much abolished ceremony and from fervour have fallen into a slovenly lethargic indolence which comprehends so little of piety that men often find their minds even during the act of kneeling abstracted from the Divinity and wandering in worldly occupations We have taken away the idol which betrayed the vulgar but have left them in such jeopardy that few even remember there is a God Religious rites warm the mind pure and sentimental devotion only befits the most enligh∣tened and most learned ceremonies catch attention as it were in wiles and those who would think little of prayer may sometimes be induced thereto almost involuntarily by joining in or being present at religious rites The soul full of wisdom worships in silence but wayward minds soon sink away from such spiritual service The contemplation of the Deity by the enlightened and wise is so replete with wonder and in∣spires such reverence that silence becomes it best but the ignorant mind conceives little more than its wants and the God of miracles with such is concluded in the God of daily bread I reverence the Roman in his sacrifice it was a noble exhibition of piety an august mode of supplicating the Deity The solemnity of craving a grace on the appointed festival in these rites was strikingly devout In this boasted age of christianity where is the devotion attendant on the hecatombs of a Lord Mayor's Feast The hecatombs of the Ancients were festivals on great and memorable events and were preceded by the most solemn rites of consecrationa commencement of festivity worthy the imita∣tion of the most enlightened nations  Dr Stukeley in his Carausius says  In reading the Roman history we see such a spirit of Religion breathing in general upon every  occasion through all they did as a nation as is no where else to be found in the least comparable To enumerate particulars would make an agreeable volume I can only take notice that it makes a great part of their story So honest so warm so grateful was their zeal to heaven at every public act that providence could not but look favourably upon them wink at what they were ignorant of as the the Apostle professes Acts xvii and prosper them accordingly Every single person of any note had a part of his house consecrated like as our private chapels called the Lararium Upon every success we read of their vowing temples On occasion of misfortune pesti∣lence floods thunder and the like they consult the oracles order public lustrations supplications and sacrifices Even their theatrical spectacles began with an act of religion many altars in their circs and places of games They never began or ended a war took up the military standards every morning without an act of religion a liba∣tion of incense In their kalendar most days in the year have some religious solemnity Look into their sculptures and monuments and observe the extravagant expence and pomp of their religious proces∣sions even their coins are countersigned with some Deity and in∣numerable sculptures of their Emperors sacrificing incensing They never began their harvest their vintage without a sacrifice without the  Flamen Dialis  gathering the first bunch The genius of the peo∣ple and city were ever represented with a Patera in its hand before an altar incensing In short religion makes the greatest part of the history the greatest part of those authors that write of their customs the greatest part of the monuments coins and sculptures which are now come to our hands of this truly magnanimous and virtuous people And if we read Polybius particularly we obtain a just idea of the noble spirit the honour and uprightness of the Roman senate which made them courted by all the world Religion cannot be se∣parated from Roman history because in  their  way they were the most religious of all people and for that reason Providence gave them the Empire of the World  To returnIn the wall of Mr Smith's house at the west end of the Station of Little Chesters an altar is preserved inscribed  MARTI VICTORI  COH III NERVIORVM  PRAEFECT I CANINVS  I have seen a brass coin struck in honour of the festival of Mars held on the st of MarchMr Wallis says the late Rev Mr Walton was possessed of one upon which was the figure of Mars armed and helmeted a shield on his left arm and a sprig of olive in his right hand  The distance between the Stations of Great and Little Chesters is about three miles and three quarters in that space there are four Cas∣tella visible and one which seems to have fallen in with the Station at Great Chesters the interval between each is seven furlongs  From the Manuscripts of the late Roger Gale  Esq  Extract of a Letter from  Mr John Warburton  to  Roger Gale  Esq  st Nov  I cannot possibly recover your essay upon the four great Roman roads unless you think fit to favour me with it It is strange there should be but four recorded when there are such numbers of them and more that the greatest of them all should want a name  This is the Erningstreet  R G  viz that which comes from the  Roman Wall  near  Dunbritt  Fryth  in Scotland to  Rochester  in Northumberland where  Antoninus  begins his first journey and from thence continues its course by  Corbridge E  chester Langchester Binchester Piersbridge Caterick Aldborough  and I believe might be thence traced directly forward through  London  to  Dover  and this without interfering with any of the four great roads mentioned except where they cross or accompany it for a few miles  It is well if  Higden  or whoever was the first describer of these ways was not mistaken in his placing the  Watlingstreet  The course he hath taken for it seems too short and out of the way and I rather agree with  Talbott  who thinks that  Antoninus's  second journey was along it viz from the west end of the  Picts Wall  to  Southampton  which I think much more probable as it enters this county on  Gatherley Moor  I was surprized to see so visible a  Roman Station  in the Yorkshire Dales as that of  Ethel∣burg  l  near  A  rigg  and for some time could not imagine what it had been but now be∣gin to have hopes of proving it to be the fourth Station of  Antonine's  th  Iter Bremetonacis  and that it stands on the military way I discovered in Northumberland called the  Devil's Ca  s  way  I have observed a military way to range along the road from  Thirst  to  Eafingwold  but where it should come from or lead to  It comes from Cataractonium and leads through Thirsk Easing∣wo  d Aldby  Der  and Wigh¦ton  Delg    to Brough overagainst Wintringham upon the Humber  R G  am yet at a loss but look upon it to have been the direct road from  Cataractonium  to  Eboracum  without going by  Isurium  and seems to be more entire and of a newer form than the others I have observed in the north as if it had been erected nearer the declension of the Empire  I have below given you the sketch of an altar which some workmen found in a vault as they were lately digging by my order in the platform of a  Roman Castrum  by the  Picts Wall  which as it is the beautifullest and most entire I have ever seen am thinking to present it to the King to be set up in St James's Gardens Mr Wanley my Lord Oxford's Librarykeeper was treating with me about it and several others in my possession in order to have them placed in the new Library at Wimple but we could not agree about the price  Found at Chester in the Wood FORTUNAIE P R C IVL RAT LE VI VV Alt p  Lab p  ½  Fortunae Populi Romani Coius Julius Ra∣tionalis Legionis  VI  Valentis Victricis  This altar I have since seen at Durham and a print of it is in Mr Gordon's Iter Septentrionale by both which it appears that the third word in the last line is RAET and therefore should read Caius Jul Raticus  R G  I am well assured the third word in the last line is  Rat  but as it is in Northumberland I have not had an opportunity of a strict examination as you desired me to make The place where I dug it up is by  Mr Camden  called  Magna  but by the Vulgar  Chester in the Wood  its situation is on a very entire raised military way that runs from  CarrVeran  to  Newbrugh  on the inside of the  Picts Wall  but for the most part at two miles distant from it My work∣men had not dug above two yards in the  area  of the platform before they struck into a  cault  of a very irregular figure three quarters of a yard in height and three or four in breadth and length all blacked on the inside with smoke and at the first opening smelt like burnt straw this great altar lay with its face downwards and by it another of the same size but broke in pieces and the inscription imperfect  Bedale  st Nov  J WARBURTON  The  vault  wherein the above mentioned altar was found seems to have been made originally for receiving the offal of the sacrifices and sweepings of the altar the smoke with which it was blacked proceeding from the hot ashes that had been thrown into it as did also the smell like that of burnt straw I was told when I was at  Cirencester  of much such another vault with ashes and burnt bones in it When the Romans were forced to quit this country they might very probably throw these two altars into the vault and cover them up to preserve them from being prophaned by the Barbarians that possessed themselves of it upon their retreat and they were effectually concealed from them by their lying bid so many hundred years as they did  There is nothing difficult in the inscription the word  Rationalis  is not very common it being more usual to stile an  Accemptant  the officer here denoted a  Rationibus  It proves also by the VI V V that the  Legio Sexta  was called  Valens Victras  as well as the  Vicefima  R G  Returning to the military road we passed a Tumulus of considerable magnitude  There are several Laws Barrows or Tumuli near the military way particularly four where the way goes off to Great Chesters called the Four Laws  it has been called an exploratory Mount but its situation contradicts this appellation as it commands no extensive country or important pass  The Roman Station now called  HOUSESTEADS  presents itself in a confusion of ruins laying on an easy descentThis was the Borcovicus of the Romans  The first Cohort of Tungrians appears by several inscriptions under different Prefects to have been stationed here Some inscriptions prove this Cohort was also in other places but the number and variety of  monuments erected here plainly shew that their settled quarters were at this place and continued here the latest  Mr Horsley says  I cannot say that Hadrian's Vallum has made the south rampart of this Station but I think it has passed not much to the south and seems to have made a small turn just at the brook in order to come near if not up to it The southern boundary of this Station is uncertain though the other limits are distinct The ditch about the Station is also flat and obscure Severus's wall makes the north rampart From south to north it is about five chains and from east to west about seven The area of the most northerly part of the Station is nearly plain but the south part is more upon a de∣scent than any other Station that I remember I think the Praetorium is visible and the ruins of a temple near it The vast ruins of the Roman Station and Town are truly wonderful and a great number of inscriptions and sculptures have been found and many yet remain at this place The town or outbuildings have stood upon a gentle declivity to the south and southeast of the Station where there are streets or somewhat that looks like terrasses  The best view of the walls and the greatest variety is between Walwick and Housesteads  From this Station there seems to have gone a military way to Little Chesters some faint vestiges of which I thought I observed but was not certain As such a military way might be of service for march∣ing forces from one of these Stations to the other so it might also be further useful for a more convenient passage from Housesteads to CarrVoran or to any other Stations along the wall more westerly Near to this way and to that part of Housesteads where a temple is supposed to have stood are some old wrought quarries now grown over with grass  The distance between Little Chesters and Housesteads is about a mile and three quarters and the distance between Housesteads and that part of the wall which is directly opposite to Little Chesters is about a mile and three furlongs and in this space there are two vi∣sible Castella the interval between which seems to be just about six furlongs This is the least interval between any two Castella upon the whole track of the wall the reason of which may be the distance of the Station at Little Chesters from the wall  The headless effigies of the Deae Matres remain on the spot they are said to be the tutelary Deities of the Forest of Lowes are represented attired in a short robe to the knee each holding something circular be∣tween their hands supposed to be the work of the Thracian or Syrian Auxiliaries and are of rude and illproportioned sculpture Mr Wallis says on Chapel Hill a place not far distant the Romans had a temple on the eminence where fragments of Doric capitals were found not many years ago one consisting of two torusses plain and many broken columns  Mr Horsley's work contains the following Inscriptions and Sculptures found at this Station  XXXVI Jovi Optimo Maximo et Numinibus Augusti Cohors Prima Tungrorum militum cui praeest Quintus Virius Superstes Praefectus  This and the following altars were dug up at a place now called the Chapel Hill supposed to be the ruins of a considerable temple The inscriptions were not long after the discovery of them published in the Philosophical Transactions by Dr Hunter by Mr Warburton and lately again by Mr Gordon they are also in Camden's Britannia The unusual shape of the I in the capital is remarkable the Tungri mentioned in this and the following inscriptions were a people of Belgic Gaul The next thing which deserves consideration is what we are to understand by Numina Augusti in this and other inscriptions where those words occur Wri∣ters are not agreed as to this and probably it has not always the same meaning here and in some other instances it should seem as if those Deities were meant to which the Emperor was peculiarly devoted and that they who erected the altars complimented the Emperor by pay∣ing honour and professing their devotion to the same Deities We find several inscriptions in Gruter that are consecrated Numinibus Augusti and one like this I O M et Numinibus Augusti and that addresses were made to the Gods in behalf of the Emperors notwithstanding they were often complimented as Deities themselves is likewise evident from many of their coins on which we have Jovi Apollini Marti Mercurio consevatori Augusti with several others of a like nature however some have thought that if this interpretation should be ad∣mitted Jupiter Optimus Maximus would be excluded from the number of the Emperors Deities but in answer to this it may be said that either the words may be so understood as if it had been expressed Jovi Optimo Maximo et ceteris Numinibus Augusti or else that Jupiter is by way of eminency distinguished from the Lares or tutelar Gods of the Emperor which were often many in number and made up partly of deceased persons as well as other fictitious Deities So Flavius Vopiscus in his life of Aurelius speaking of his going into the temple of Helioga∣balus says  There he found that image of the Deity which he saw favouring him in the war  and Julius Capitolinus in the life of Aurelius addressed to the Emperor Dioclesian says  The statues of Marcus Antoninus are to this day set up in many houses among the fa∣mily Deities  and soon after  He is to this time esteemed a God as you always thought and do think most sacred Emperor Dioclesian who worship him among your Deities not as the rest but in a peculiar manner  But in some other inscriptions the word Numina in the plural is applied to a particular Deity so we have Numina Dianae in Horace and in Virgil Numina Phoebi and what comes nearer to our purpose the same poet when speaking of Augustus himself and by his sordid flattery ranking him among the Gods but uncertain where to place him uses these words  Au Deus immensi venias maris actua nautae  Numina sola colant  On the other hand Numen in the singular is sometimes joined to a plurality of Deities as in Virgil  Non haec sine Numine deorum eveniunt  XXXVII Jovi Optimo Maximo et Numinibus Augusti Cohors Prima Tungrorum cui praeest Quintus Julius Maximus Praefectus  It is plain by the tenor of this inscription the I O M Jovi Optimo Maximo was placed in the capital as well as it appears to be in that of the former though nothing of this nature appears in any of the copies which have been published before but upon a close view of the original I plainly discovered the I but could not perceive neither O nor M This however inclines me to charge this defect rather on time and the weather than upon the workmen but without these letters it is evident that the sense of the inscription is not compleat the ET with which it beg as on the plane of the altar necessarily supposing somewhat on the capital On one side of this altar is a Praefericulum and on the other a Patera each included in a waved ornament I dare not venture positively to say these inscriptions are as old as Antoninus Pius though I know of no other in this form but these here at Housesteads and one upon the altar at Benwell which last expressly mentions this Emperor nor do I think that any objection against this antiquity of them can be taken from the cut of the letters or the numeral stroke above the I which have nothing in them that favours the lower times I only add that some gentlemen choose to read these inscriptions Cohortis Primae Tungrorum Milites  XXXVIII  This is a large and very fine altar but the inscription entirely gone I have given a re∣presentation of one side of it because the Patera and ornaments about it seemed to be sin∣gular perhaps the circle and cross line at the bottom may represent the place of the Patera in the temple Mr Gordon says there were five or six altars within the ruins of this temple I saw no more here but the two preceding the rest which that gentleman describes with a good many more sculptures and altars lying at the bottom of a field southeast of the Station in which field remain the visible ruins of streets and buildings  XXXIX Jovi Optimo Maximo et Numinibus Augusti Cohors Prima Tungrorum cui praeest Quintus Ju  s Maximus Praef  ctus  Th  s w  th the nine follow  ng inscriptions and sculptures were lying as I said before at the foot of the field where the Roman town stood and most of them were also erected by the same Cohort of the Tungrians and this in particular when under the same Praefect or at least one of the same name as No Quintus Julius Maximus The letters I O M at the top were obscure and have been overlooked by Mr Gordon The VS in the fifth line were visible enough and no doubt are the last letters in the word Maximus and probably the word Prae∣fect  has followed but this is effaced The letters are not so large or so well cut as in the  o  er inscriptions  XL Deo Ma  i  Quintus Flav  s Maternus Praefectus Cohortis Primae Tungrorum votum so  ens merito  This is erected to the God  by Quintus Florius Matermus Praefect of the same Cohort  The globe on the base of the altar is remarkable and the letter A is without a transverse The inscription is well cut and has nothing of the lower Empire in it  XLI Herculi Cohors Prima Tungrorum Militum cui praeest Publius Aelius Modestus Prae∣fectus  Probably this may be later than the former it is dedicated to Hercules by the same Co∣hort under a new Commander Publius Aelius Modestus Nothing more is remarkable in it  XLII Matribus Cohors Prima Tungrorum  This is to the Deae Matres The name of the Cohort is very plain and distinct and part of the word Matribus but the rest is obliterated only half of a V appears in the under line which I take to be the V in the last syllable of Tungrorum but the Commander's name if it ever has been mentioned is not now visible These Matres are supposed to have been local Deities and worshipped at this place  XLIII Jovi Optimo Maximo and at the bottom Praefectus  This is another fine altar here erected to Jupiter Optimus Maximus and I believe by the same Cohort though the names both of the Commander and Cohort are now destroyed by the weather and only part of the word Praefectus left visible upon the plane of the stone I cannot find that this altar has been published before  Mr Warburton has given us a funeral inscription at this place in his Map of Northumber∣land which I could no where meet with upon the strictest enquiry According to his repre∣sentation it is thus  DM  HVRMIO  LE VBASNI  MIL CoH I  TVNGROR  BE PRAEF  CAPURIS  HER E C  This copy is without doubt incorrect though the main design is obvious enough The same Cohort of the Tungrians is plainly mentioned and enough beside to shew that it was now under a different Commander from any of those whose names occur in the former inscriptions I imagine we must read it  D  s manibus Hurmio Leubasinus miles Cohortis Primae Tungrorum cui praeest  perhaps  Capurnus  or  Capurnius haeredes secerunt  It is plain that this may justly be reckoned among the inscriptions in which the name of this Cohort distinctly appears under five different Commanders besides two or three more which are doubtful by reason of their being defaced These inscriptions strongly prove this place to be  Borcovius  the station upon the wall where according to the  Notitia  this Cohort was in garrison  XLIV Centurio Legionis Sextae Victricis Piae Fidelis votum solvit libentissime merito  This inscription is upon a piece of an altar the upper part being broken off and lost It has been published in the Philos Transactions by Dr Hunter and more lately by Mr Gordon But in both the remains of two imperfect letters in the break at the top are neglected and yet I take these to be material because the last is plainly the half of an inverted C the usual mark  of a Century or Centurion But the name of this Centurion of the th Legion and the God to whom the altar was dedicated are gone The inscription as to that part of the form of it may be compared to the altars and inscriptions upon them at Benwell I read LL liben∣tissime because it is supported by the best authorities and seems also the most easy and na∣tural Some chuse to read Libens Lubens as the words occur at length in some inscriptions and others read Libens Laetus from the expression of Cloanthus in his vow  Di quibus imperium pelagi quorum aequora curro  Vobis Laetus ego hoc candentem in littore Taurum  Constituam ante aras voti reus  But I keep to the usual reading Sometimes we have MM which must be read Meritissimo  XLV  At this place also are several curious sculptures most of which are described by Mr Gordon and in the main very justly But the account we have of them in Camden's Britannia seems to me not so exact For what is there called a Mercury is plainly a Victory And we are told of the statues of Jupiter Bacchus and a Flamen which by all I can possibly discern are only the figures of two Roman soldiers and three female figures supposed to be the Deae Ma∣tres or Campestres The first is a Victory standing upon a globe on the right foot the left being cast behind in the attitude of alighting or of taking flight On her head is a cap of a Conic figure she is naked to the waist from a girdle a vest hangs in plaits to near the knee and from thence a flowing robe open before which shews the right leg the arms are broken off by the wrists the wings are half elevated The sculpture is good in alto relievo and the figure is placed in a nich  XLVI  This is also in alto relie  o being the figure of a Roman soldier at length in the usual mi∣litary dress his bow in his left resting one end on the ground and his poinard in his right his sword hung by his side at his girdle and his quiver with arrows behind his right shoulder This figure also stands within a n  ch  XLVII  This is the figure of another soldier in his accoutrements but somewhat imperfect His two belts are vis  le crossing each other agreeable to the description of Ajax's armour in Homer The broader belt over the right shoulder must have been that of the shield as we learn from the same poet  XLVIII  These are three female figures seated The draught given by Mr Horsley he says was taken from the originals They are naked to the waist and their legs naked up to the knees and therefore he says I know not the reason why Mr Gordon who published them before has drawn them with their legs covered down to the ancles The figures have lost their heads These are not improbably supposed to be local Goddesses or the Deae Matres or Cam∣pestres We have three female figures represented together at two other places in this Roman Station which I shall describe in their order The vessels which these three have in their hands appear not unlike the Colathus or Modius on the heads of Sorapis and Fortune and oft upon the heads of the Roman Emperors which may favour the opinion of their being the Deae Campestres who in these parts had the care of corn and country affairs and were supposed to give plenty Whether these vessels be of that sort or whether they represent those in which the sortes or lo  s were cast which also might be a proper attribute of the Deae Matres and  whether there being three in number has any relation to the number of the Parcae I shall leave to others to explain Perhaps their savage dress may have some reference to that madness which was always ascribed to the Matres or ancient Prophetesses  XLIX  About a furlong or less to the east near the side of a brook and close to a hedge are three other female figures seated each in a separate chair Mr Gordon takes notice of two only but a third was also lying near the others covered with grass and bushes The heads and hands are broken off from all the three and the drapery is somewhat different in all of them They are intended to be represented as sitting The first in the plate is naked to the waist her vest makes several folds above the knee and falls about half way down to her ancles the rest of the legs covered with a kind of stockings The second is naked to the waist the gar∣ment also forms many folds about the knees and falls about half way down the legs which are naked to the feet The chair in which this figure is placed has two side feet and a center foot round which a cord is twisted passing thrice round each leg as binding the figure to the chair The third figure has its vest up so as to conceal the breasts the robe descends a little below the knees from whence the lower parts of the legs are naked Mr Ward subjoins  I am inclined to think these six figures were originally placed in some temple built in the Ro∣man town adjoining to this Station together with the three following whom I do not take to be Deities but rather Priestesses two of which hold some sort of vessel in their right hands as a symbol of their office The difference of their habit seems to favour this opinion like∣wise that of their posture for they are standing which is the posture of attendants but the others sit which was always esteemed a posture of Majesty  At this place there lies a broken altar of the largest size but no visible letters upon it  L  In the Station itself and against a hedge were three other female figures but standing which are published likewise by Mr Gordon The Sea Goat and two fishes above must pro∣bably have some reference to Britain's being an island The Sea Goat occurs in some other sculptures found in the north  The vessels which these hold in their hands do not appear like the Patera They may possi∣bly be intended for Vases of the same sort with those in the hands of the three sitting only in another position If they are vessels into which the Sortes were put these figures may repre∣sent the action of throwing them out It may not be amiss to observe here that Virgil in the Prophecy of Helenus uses the expression sortiri fata for the decrees of heaven  "Sic fata deum Rex  "Sortitur"  In the sculpture inscribed Deabus Mairabus in Montsaucon the Goddesses are represented standing in an attitude not very unlike these The middle figure there holds fruit either in a vessel or in the folding of her garment the figure on the right hand holds a vessel he calls a Patera and she on the left holds a branch downwards That great Antiquary observes that the Ancients usually made three of those Goddesses that were worshipped in the plural number whether good or bad as the Gorgons the Graeae the daughters of Phorcus as also the Parcae the Sirenes the Harpyies the Hesperides the Stymphalides the Graces nay even the Sibyls and the Muses according to the most ancient authors  LI  Mr Gordon when upon the spot with Baron Clark dog up from the ruins of the Roman town here a small statue of a soldier in the Roman military habit holding a spear in his right hand and resting with his left upon a shield This is now in the Baron's collection  There are also in the same honourable person's collection two other small altars found here but as they have no inscriptions or any thing remarkable about them I have not given the draughts  Besides all these there are likewise several other pieces of sculptures altars pedestals and pillars scattered here and there and one piece of a fine channelled pillar lying in the midst of the Station There may be two or three other Stations in Britain as Burdoswald Elenbo∣rough and Lanchester that exceed this in number of inscriptions but none I think equal it as to the extent of the ruins of the town or the number variety and curiosity of the sculp∣tures which yet remain here  There is one inscription more which belongs to this place that was published in the Transac∣tions by Dr Hunter several years ago The Doctor says the stone lay against a hedge at about a quarter of a m  le distance I myself saw a stone in a hedge which I believe to have had a sepulchral inscription upon it and at nearly this distance but there was not one letter visible upon it The inscription was imperfect when the Doctor saw it who gave it thus  NI VENORI  G OFERSIONIS  ROMVLO ALIMAHI  MANSVETIO SINICIONI  REVINCE QVARTIONIS  ERESI PROCVRAVIT DELF  VS RAVTIONIS EX G S  ni Venotrionis filio  g Osersionis  Romulo Alimabionis  Mansuatio Senecionis  Revincio Quartionis  Erigi Procuravit Delfius  Rautionis ex gratia sua  I imagine th  to have been a sepulchral monument erected for several persons whose fathers  ended  as well perhaps as some of their own I am apt to think these remaining I  spand  have been read as above Mr Ward disliking the expression ex Gratia sua chooses  Germ  a S  peri    Dr S  had the  suppose of the common sepulchral kindly which he saw at this  to be found  The next remarkable place we arrived at was  SHEWINGSHEELS  between the military road and the wall near the th milestone the remains of a Roman Station about sixty yards square which Camden concludes was Hunnum where the Notitia places the wing Sabiniani Mr Horsley thinks it belonged to Hadrian's Vallum and became use∣less when Severus's wall was built  We advanced to  CARRAWBROUGH  near the th milestone the Roman Station Procolitia garrisoned by the first Cohort of the Batavians Severus's military way appears to enter the east gate of the fort and go out at the west A great part of  the rampart here still continues very entire especially on the east side and Severus's wall which forms the north rampart is in good preser∣vation The ditch is most visible on the west Here it may plainly be seen that the corners of the forts were not strictly angular but turned off in a quarter of a circle  According to Mr Horsley the buildings without this fort have been chiefly on the west side where some years ago a well was discovered with a good spring the receptacle for the water is about seven feet square within and built on all sides with hewn stone it is now almost filled up with rubbish There had also been a wall about it or a house built over it  From this fort to the village of Carraw Hadrian's Vallum and ditch are not very conspicuous but Severus's wall is very visible though the ditch is obscure About half a mile southwest from Carraw upon a high ground is a square fort now called Broomdykes it is as large as the fort of Carrawbrough and probably has been for exploration or for the Aestiva of this fort About halfway between Carraw and Thropfellhouse there seems to be some vestiges of the smaller military way supposed to have gone close by Severus's wall from turret to turret  For about a mile the walls keep near to each other and for that space are themselves and all their members very large and conspicuous se∣veral of the regular stones appear in Severus's wall and the united mi∣litary way is very noble After this the walls part and take different courses The north Agger of Hadrian's fortification continues after the  separation large and high is mixed with stones though no regular pavement appears whereas Severus's military way after this parting appears little raised but regularly paved Hadrian's Vallum keeps the low ground all the way whilst Severus's runs along the brink of the precipices which in some places seem to have been made steeper by art in order to render them more inaccessable For this reason Severus's wall is for this space very crooked whilst Hadrian's in the main is pretty straight They have made no ditch to Severus's work when they had the advantage of a precipice nor was there the least occasion but in these intervals between the rocks they have often drawn a ditch and in these places usually erected their Castella  After their separation Severus's military way accompanies the wall pretty closely and is generally for the whole space that the walls con∣tinue so far parted visible and distinct yet the way does not follow every smaller winding of the wall upon the tops of the precipices but generally takes a shorter course and passes along the slope of the hill from Castellum to Castellum in the shortest and most convenient line that it can this is very remarkable at the first great turn of the wall after it enters upon the precipices The wall itself is almost all this way visible in an eminent degree and sometimes it only wants the battle∣ments as near Busy Gap which is an aperture or pass between the hills so called where there is an opportunity of crossing the wall on horseback Thus it passes by Shewingsheels Houses leaving Shewingsheels Castle on the north Mr Horsley further observes that this Castle or something else near it is called a square Roman Castle in the new edition of Camden and Camden himself thought this was the Station of Hunnum but he says he saw nothing that was Roman about it The Castle itself in ruins and the Moats about it are undoubtedly of a much later date And he adds I observed several trenches there∣abouts particularly a large and long one which reaches from Busy Gap cross the passes between the mountains But these are all on the north side of the wall and must certainly have been made in later times for securing the neighbouring passes Probably they are no older than the times of our famous Moss Troopers who might conveniently shelter themselves among these hideous mountains and mosses The height of one of these rocks is near forty yards perpendicular  Warburton p Horsley's Brit Rom  but in other parts  they are considerably higher As such steep rocks are a sufficient fence of themselves the wall has not in these parts had either strength or thickness equal to what it has had in others The remains here are not so considerable though it seems very improbable that any of the stones especially in some places could have been removed In the hol∣lows between the rocks besides the addition of the ditch and a Castel∣lum here and there the wall itself seems to have been stronger and thicker Where there is a small break of the precipice inward the wall forms an internal angle fetching a compass In other cases it passes directly from one rock to another and then is usually continued down the side of the one and up the side of the other except where the descent is almost perpendicular in which case it is only carried close to the side of the rock beginning again at  which was all that was needful or practicable  The distance between Housesteads and Carrawbrough is somewhat more than four miles and five furlongs All the Castella between these two Stations are very visible being five in number but their distances are a little unequal The two first intervals from Carrawbrough are just seven furlongs but the next is only six There is a turret near Busy Gap the distance of which from the nearest Castellum is I find just onefifth of the interval between that and the next Castellum  An altar found here and deposited in the Dean and Chapter's Li∣brary at Durham has the following inscription  FORTVNE  CoH I BATAVOR  CVI PRAEST  MELACCINVS  MARCELLVS PREF  Fortunae Cohors Prima Batavorum cui praeest Melaccinus Marcellus Praefectus This altar dedicated to the Goddess Fortune is most cu∣rious and valuable because by mentioning the Cohors Prima Batavorum it confirms the Station to be Procolitia The altar is still entire and the inscription easy enough to be read Mr Horsley reads the Com∣mander's name Melaccinus as it had been read before Dr Hunter reads it Marcus Flaccinus but on a review Mr Horsley still thought the se∣cond  letter in the last line but one to be rather an E  In Mr Horsley's work we have the following sculpture and inscriptions  XXXIII  Mr Warburton in his Map of Northumberland gave a drawing of a curious altar and in∣scription being a sepulchral stone or an altar without any focus at the top erected to the Dii Manes by Tranquilla Severa for her and her's The inscription is read thus Dis Manibus dicatum Tranquila Severa pro se et suis votum solvit Libens Merito This is deposited in the Dean and Chapter's Library at Durham The principal curiosity in the form or manner of the letters is the expression of the V and I together like a Y though it is only placing the V above the I as is very evident both from the original and the draught I have given of it for in the fourth line there is a visible distance or separation between them though it is not so in the second which with some other small matters has been overlooked in the copies published before the letters are strong and well cut though involved and connected The name Tran∣quila I find in this and other inscriptions with a single L  XXXIV  This stone contains only a human figure which Mr Gordon supposes to represent a man but to me the face appeared rather to be a female I took the stone to have been sepulchral and the image may possibly have been the abovementioned Tranquila Severa  XXXV Centuria Alexandri Posuit  This is an inscription of the centurial sort that has not been regarded before it is upon a broken stone lying at the door of one of the houses at Carrawbrough  It is remark∣able that this altar has no focus  We searched for the sculpture which Mr Wallis says was found at this Station and is built up in a gable of the house at Car  aw he de∣scribes it as a curious representation of Neptune with his trident The stone on which this effigy is cut is placed so high that it is difficult to come near it is almost square about inches on the longest side and has so imperfect a resemblance of Neptune that I should not have known what it was had I not seen Mr Wallis's description  We arrived at  WALWICK  the country through which we had passed from Walton to Carraw was dreary and had not our minds been engaged with objects of antiquity would have proved wearisome In some parts we had distant prospects various in their beauties and rendered more striking by the barrenness over which we looked upon them When we came within five miles of Chollerford the vales of North and South Tyne opened upon us and the scene was filled with all that pleasing variety which arises from cul∣tivation receiving additional beauties from the incidents of the season Verdant meads dotted or patched over as it were with the hay that  stood in  pikes  The improvidence of the people in Northumberland touching their hay is singular it is put together in several heaps or as they are called there pikes in the field where it is won and stands in that form for many weeks before it is gathered into the mowe or stack by which negligence much is wasted in the bottoms and outsides of the pikes  mixed with rich fields of corn some cut and others ready for the sickle interspersed with woodlands and stately trees formed the Landskip where several gentlemen's seats and wellbuilt farmholds were dispersed the whole graced with the winding streams of Tynethe claybuilt cottage and nakedfooted poverty were no where in view  In Walwick the Roman wall is in good preservation From the seat of Thomas Dixon  Esq  the prospect is filled with the most agreeable subjectsto the left Houghton and Swinburn Castles are seen with the villages of Hunshaw and Chollertonthe north branch of the Tyne with a fine stone bridge of five arches at Chollerford ornament the front groundand to the right a wide cultivated country terminated by the town of Hexham  The seat of Henry Tulip  Esq  also commands a beautiful prospect over this valley  The Inn at Chollerford tempted our stay a spacious room built for the resort of the neighbouring gentlemen afforded us a pleasing view upon the river whilst excellent accommodations indulged us with that degree of satisfaction which truly constitutes the traveller's ease  We visited  WALWICK CHESTERS  situate near the elegant newerected Mansion of John Errington  Esq  This was the Cilurnum of the Romans  Camden cal  it Gallana  where as some authors assert the  Cohors Prima Vangionum  was stationed but according to Mr Horsley it was garrisoned by the  Ala Secunda Astorum  It is placed on an in∣clining plain near the banks of North Tyne the Vallum forms an ob∣long square with obtuse angles in length from east to west paces and in width paces In Mr Warburton's plan it is set out as being feet long and feet broad The scite of the Praetorium at the  eastern end is very distinguishable with two entrances through the Vallum answering to each side of the Praetorium and a road leading down to the river The ground within the Vallum is crowded with the ruins of stone buildings which appear to have stood in lineal directions forming streets two on the south side and two on the north intersected in the middle by a cross street from north to south On the south side without the Vallum and Foss many ruins of buildings appear and some on the north I remember on a tour in Cumberland I found Caerleud near Wigton crowded with ruins  This being the first Station in my tour where the direct appearance of regular streets was observed I thought it the properest place to intro∣duce the following remarks  The Roman manner of encamping a large army according to  Poly∣hius  and other ancient writers is thus represented  Fig The  Praetorium  a square plot every side containing feet for the  General's lodging and his train  the ground so chosen as might be fittest both for prospect and direction  Fig A  street  feet broad leading from the midst of the  Praetorium  to the  gate  fig  Fig A  street  directly opposite to the former of the same breadth lead∣ing from the  Praetorium  to the  gate  fig on the right hand of which street was lodged one  Legion  with her  Auxilia  and another on the left Now from the  Praetorium  towards the  gate  measuring out feet employed to uses hereafter specified we are there to begin the lodging of the common soldiers  Fig A row of  lodgings  for the  horsemen  of the first  legion  divided into partitions according to the number of  Turmae  in Polybius's Le∣gion which consisted of horse and foot the first  Turma  being quartered in the lodging nearest to the  Praetorium  and the rest in order toward the  gate  These lodgings lay length∣ways and open upon the street each side being feet so that to one horseman they allowed a standing equal to a square a little exceeding feet every way Next comes the lodgings of the  Decem Ordines Triariorum  lodgings for the  Ordines  or  Manipuli Triariorum Primae Legionis  with their Centurions and under officers joining back to back with the lodgings of the  Equites  and opening into the  street  of feet broad  Primus Pilus  being quartered next to the  Praetorium  and so in consequence towards the gate where all the  Decemi Ordines  do lodge Every one of these lodgings in length feet in breadth feet lodged  Triarii  and a rateable part of the  Velites  which considering the proportion that one of the  Or∣dines Triariorum  bore to one of the  Ordines Principium  and  Hastatorum  and the number of  Velites  in  Polybius's Legion  falleth out to be persons according to which reckoning to one footman they allowed a standing equal to a square somewhat more than eight feet every way  On the other side of the  street  the lodgings of the  Decem Ordines Principium Primae Legionis  and at their backs the lodgings of the  Decem Ordines Hastatorum  opening the one into the street and the other into the street being also feet broad Each of these lodgings  was square every side containing feet and lodged  Sui Ordinis  and  Velites  beside proportionably as in  Tabernaculis Triariorum  there was for half as many men half as much ground  On the other side of the  street  are the lodgings of the  Auxiliares Equites in Dextro Cornu  and at their backs the lodgings of the  Auxiliares Pedites in Dextro Cornu  the horse opening into the street the foot into the  void place  between the lodgings and the trenches of which fur∣ther notice will be taken Now the  Equites Auxiliares  of a  Legion  the extraordinary band being deducted amounting according to  Polybius  to horse allowing to legionary horse lodgings of feet every way we are to allow to these following the same proportion lodgings each feet in length and in breadth to quarter the one as conveniently as the other Likewise the  footmen  after the deduction of the extraordinary band being that is persons for every lodging  Upon the left hand of the  street  are the lodgings of the second Legion with her  Auxilia  in the same proportion and order in all points with the first and so we have the breadth of the camp from the ut∣most auxiliary footmen of the one legion to the like of the other feet or paces accounting five feet for a pace  AA The  Via Quintana  feet broad passing from side to side through the whole breadth of the lodgings so named  á Quintis Ordinibus  which quarter all upon it In this street as being in the middle of the soldiers quarters and therefore the best adapted to that purpose was holden a market  Forum rerum utensilium  BB Of the space of feet between the soldiers quarters and the  Prae∣torium  feet was employed in the  Via Principalis  especial care was taken to beautify this street and keep it clean as being the usual place of resort for the soldiers in the daytime In the other feet toward the  Praetorium  was a row of lodgings open∣ing upon  Via Principalis  each lodging bearing every way feet for the  Tribuni  and  Praefecti Socio  um  their train horses and carriages are the lodgings of the six  Tribunes  of the first Legion the first lodging answering directly to the legionary horsemen's quarter and the last to the street with passages feet wide between each c c c c c c are the lodgings of the  Praefecti  answering exactly to the breadth of the Auxiliaryquarter with a void space of feet between the third  and fourth tent and so on the other side for those of the other Legion  D D A cross  street  feet broad before the  Praetorium  where I pre∣sume was held the watch mentioned by  Polybius  e e e e Here were lodged the  Extraordinarii Equites  and  Extraordinarii Pedites  the plot was feet by feet answering the  Quaesto∣rium  and part of the  Praetorium  for the extraordinary band of the  Auxilia Primae Legionis  consisting of horse and foot the footmen quartered toward the  trenches  and the horse to∣ward the  street  and so on the other side for the other Legion  f f f f A plot of the same length and in breadth feet for the  fo∣reign Aids  such as by occasion came in  G G A plot feet by feet where the  Selecti ac Voluntarii Equites Pedites  were quartered being chosen men of the extraordinary band of the  Auxilia Primae Legionis  the foot quartered toward the  trenches  the horse toward the  Praetorium  and so on the other side for the other Legion There was a reserve therein for Vo∣luntarymen who from kindred or friendship or on other re∣spects attended the General These  Selecti  and  Voluntarii  did not only saith  Polybius  quarter near the General but also in march∣ing and all other times of service were continually attendant upon the General and the Quaestor in the nature of a  Cohors Praetoria  H The  Quaestorium  a plot feet by feet for the  Quaestor  and his train with their treasure and provision for the Pioneers Car∣penters Smiths Armourers c with their tools and officers There was also the  Auguraculum  and peradventure the public prison  I The  Forum  a plot equal in dimensions to the  Quaestorium  This was the place of all public assemblies and the tribunal with the seat of estate Here were probably those seats of which Josephus makes mention on which the Tribunes and Centurions sat in judgment to decide the controversies happening between the soldiers Here were placed the eagles and ensigns of the Legions with the bearers  Aquiliferi  and  Signiferi  certain images of the Gods and in later times of the Prince and his children and sometimes of his great  favourites Tacitus describing a solemn assembly in that place says  Inde Eques hinc agmina Legionum stetere fulgentibus aquilis signisque simulacris Deúm in modum Templi Medio Tribunal sedem curulem sedes effigiem Neronis sustinebat  the  Eagles  were placed in little chapels Dio lib says  In all the Roman armies there is a little chapel and in it a golden eagle doth stand  The ensigns were placed  sub dio  as indeed being certain long spears co∣vered with silver with the Prince's image hanging upon them they could hardly be placed under a tent  K K K A void space feet broad between the lodgings and the trench calculated for the easy issuing of the troops and to prevent the enemy throwing fire upon the quarters also used for lodging the cattle  L The  Vallum  in the summer camps composed of earth defended by a palisado of large stakes bound together these were carried by the common soldiers  usque ad septenos Vallos  says Livy In the  Vallum  were contrived platforms like turrets where the engines were placed the  Balistae  and  Catapultae  Without the Vallum was a ditch six feet in depth at least  There were four gates in the campthe  Porta Praetoria  the chief gate placed opposite to the enemy the backgate opposite to the for∣mer placed for the convenience of water and foragethe other sides had each a gate opening to the  Via Principalis  This camp was calculated for two of  Polybius  's ordinary Legions with their  Auxilia  which was the ordinary army of one Consul  The General Officer over the camp was named  Praefectus Castrorum  who ordered the staking out the camp its being kept regular and clean to order the trenches and ditch and to quarter the soldiersTo keep in order the Smith Carpenter Engineers and Artificers was an Officer named  Praefectus Fabrûm  The ruins which appear at Walwick camp must necessarily induce an enquiry from the traveller in the first place what number of men were stationed thereBy every monument remaining to us one single  Cohort  only appears to have held each of these Stations on the wall  Manipuli made Centuries or Ordines Manipuli Cohort Cohorts Legion Legio Romuli Legio Plutarchi Legio Freestate Legio War with Hani∣bal Legio Polybii    Stations defended by a stonebuilt Vallum were the permanent ones and winter quarters the encampments in summer were defended by a rampier of turf with a palisado of which as I mentioned before I pre∣sume the  Corona Vallaris  was a pattern composed of pointed stakes and an outward ditch Few if any remains are left us of such to ascertain their situation or magnitude In a square of paces by there ap∣pears room sufficient for a  Cohort  when lodged in tents or hovels of wood but when in that square you have allotted room for the  Praetorium  with the apartments of the chief officers what kind of tenements of masonwork must there be erected in streets which should contain that number of people with their accoutrements wives families and house∣hold stuffI should conceive the excellent discipline of the Roman army would not admit the women within the wall of the camp except only in time of imminent peril but that they were lodged in the suburbs The enquiry naturally brings on this result that those edifices whose remains now appear in some of the Roman Stations for they are not in all are of more modern date were built after the Romans forsook this island by the Britons or their Saxon allies and arose in that Aera in which the appellation of  Caer  or City was given to many of them The Britons in their dispirited situation on the final retreat of the Ro∣mans would necessarily resort to those barriers and strongholds which the Romans had filled I am induced to believe that no castle of any considerable magnitude was erected by the Romans in this country the  Castellum  or Turret on the walls was not worthy the appellation of Castle being as I before observed most probably no more than a tower to guard the gate or no better than a mere bastion to command the Vallum Our castles of which such noble remains appear at this day are of much more modern date and derived from the Saxon and Nor∣man visiters The strongest fortifications of the ancient Britons were formed of piles of loose stones heaped to a ridge and reduced into a circle or a square Such a  Vallum  was difficult to be surmounted by assailants The  Vallum  of the Roman permanent Station was built of hewn stone inside and out those which I have seen most perfect among which Lanchester in the county of Durham is one were formed of stones about inches long and inches deep of rough ashlerwork the outside of the wall was perpendicular and might in its original strength be or feet high and eight feet thick at the foot but thining or decreasing on the inside towards the top by steps and grada∣tions at the distance of about inches and the summit covered with a broad flat cape having a parapet or palisado in front Lanchester has  four of those steps or gradations now remaining The interstice be∣tween the inward and outward casing of ashlerwork was filled with flat stones in an inclining position run full of lime mixed with small pebbles and rough gravel so that the cement is more impenetrable than the stone itself the angles were obtuse to suit the superstructure of an exploratory turret or to give greater power to the garrison upon an assault in annoying the enemy on their flanks The gradations allowed them not only a power of ascending the wall readily but of lining it several ranks deep those at the top were at liberty to manage their se∣veral weapons and engines those below to use the bow and the soldiers engaged during an assault were easily relieved when fatigued or wounded  Some of the Stations had an entrance on each side defended by a gate but whether with a tower or not it is difficult to ascertain tho' it may reasonably be conjectured  I apprehend a Roman Station in Britain when in the occupation of its proper people would greatly resemble the following imaginary drawing  At Walwick Chesters Severus's wall falls in upon the middle of the camp on the east and west sides and Hadrian's Vallum falls in with the south side of it Severus's wall and ditch being never continued through a Station are here as in all the like cases supplied by the north rampart and ditch of the fort and they are both very conspi∣cuous  From this Station a military way  Horsley's Brit Rom Warburton's Val Rom  has gone directly west by  Little Chesters  to  CarrVoran  it is very visible for the greatest part of the way and paved with large stones In its eastern course it seems to have passed through this Station and crossed the river North Tyne just below it by a bridge and at the distance of three miles and a half from thence falls in with the great Erminstreet way by the country people called Wat∣lingstreet in its course between the south and north parts of Britain which military way crosses and soon after coincides with another Ro∣man way called the Devil's Causeway which enters into Scotland near to Berwick upon Tweed Mr Warburton says in his opinion this is though contrary to the sentiments both of Mr Horsley and Mr Gordon the true course of the Roman road called the Maiden Way which they supposed to have terminated at  CarrVoran  or to have entered Scot∣land by a shorter direction  From  Walwick Chesters  to the village of  Walwick  Severus's wall and ditch are very observable but Hadrian's Vallum with what belongs to it is more obscure From hence all the way to  Carrawbrough  both the walls and their ditches are very conspicuous and for most part of the way several regular courses of the original facing stone are to be seen in Severus's wall the two works keep pretty close together and nearly parallel one to the other the military way is within a chain or two of the wall Taking all the works together they are no where in the whole tract more conspicuous and magnificent than they are here at least for so long a space  Near  Towertay  there are five or six regular courses of the facing stones of the wall and a little west from thence are large remains of a Cas∣tellum detached about a yard from the wall the reason of which is not very obvious  There are for a small space heaps of rubbish laying on the north side of Hadrian's ditch at a place where the ditch passes through some rocks which looks as if stones had been wrought there for the use of the wall There are also in this part of the north Agger several breaks as if they had been made for the passage of carriages which I also ob∣served in other parts none such are observable in those places where the military ways are united And both the rubbish upon the north Agger and the breaches in it are where Severus's military way leaves it to go off to a Castellum  The distance between  Walwick Chesters  and  Carrawbrough Fort  is almost three measured miles and a quarter and in this space there are three visible Castella The fourth has either been very near the Station at  Carrawbrough  or just fallen in with it  We passed down to  WALWICKGRANGE  the former residence of the Errington family The situation of the house is romantic and retired  Anthony Errington  Esq  Edward VI  William High Sheriff of Northumberland  John now of Walwick Chesters  Wallis  Here we found a monumental stone  having the figure of a woman to the waist surrounded with a wreath the inscription totally obliterated from its laying as a bridgestone over a waterdrain for the passage of cattle to the sta∣bleit is represented in the plate The inscription was communicated to me by Mr Collier of Newcastle and by him extracted from a manuscript at Mr Er∣rington's  Mr Horsley reads this inscription thus  XXIII Dis manibus Ursae sorori Juliae conjugi Carrioni filio Furio Germano  The figure on the top of the stone is no doubt one of the women deceased the fourth line is reversed The first letter in the last line is represented as it appeared upon washing the stone It is plainly an F though Mr Gordon has made VA of it and VAVRIO of the name This person was brother to the party who erected the monument as is intimated by the word Ger∣manus  The next plate is the sculp∣ture  described by Mr Wallis  as an altar with a female Deity supposed by him to be Cybele adjoining to which is the figure of a Lion raising the head of a man who lays prostrate the drawing is taken with accuracy This with the others at the Grange appear to be merely monumental and we were informed they were found to the east of the camp not far distant from the Vallum The sculpture I apprehend was dedicated to the manes of some deceased personage of note The lion is boldly relieved his left foot is placed upon the head of a human figure naked to the waist the hands cast forward in the position of one fallen Separated from these by a moulding on the left hand of the stone is a human figure robed to the feet a spear rest∣ing on the left arm a small altar at the right knee and in the right hand what seems to be a blazing torch The construction I put upon the whole when I saw it though contrary to the conjectures of others is that it was erected to the memory of one who was slain in battle and that the figure to the left was in the act of incensing and perform∣ing the rites and honours of the dead The Romans on their monu∣ments expressed particular nations or people by some animal so the lion may denote some noble enemy Scotch expeditions are by some authors said to be distinguished by the figure of a boar  Mr Horsley represents this monument somewhat different he makes the Lion turning his face from the person on whose head he rests his foot and the standing figure holds a key in his handHe gives the following thoughts upon it  This is but a coarse though I think a curious sculpture which has never as I know of been published before I first imagined it to have been sepulchral as most of the other in∣scriptions and sculptures are which belong to this place But if it be the mother of the Gods who is here represented or any other principal Deity the stone has probably been of a more public nature There is a broken stone with an imperfect sculpture upon it at Cor∣bridge which I take to be of the same nature The sculpture before us represents a female seated holding a key in her right hand and I think a thyrsus or hasta in her left and on the other part of the stone a human figure lying along and a lion with one of his paws gently raising up the head The lion respects Cybele the mother Goddess and the thyrsus and hasta are her common symbols and sometimes the key And I am of opinion that this is the figure of Cybele the Syrian Goddess for as Montfaucon observes  Dea Syria was one of the most celebrated names of Cybele and she was so called because much or chiefly wor∣shipped in Syria The symbols were the same a towered head Lions a Tympanum Thyrsus c  This sculpture then may very probably represent Cybele for both the key and the thyrsus were her symbols by one of which was represented the opening of the earth and by the other the producing of wine And as we have an altar at Little Chesters devoted to her this may still render it more probable and if it be Cybele who is here represented the lion that is gently raising up the head of the human figure may signify the revival of man by the spring and produce of the earth or by the wine and fruits it affords the lion does not seem to be in a devouring posture but rather guarding or cherishing In the sculpture at Corbridge the reviving figure has not been human but some other animal and the pro∣duce of the earth restores and cherishes both man and beast  In the wall of the same barn in which the last described sculpture is now placed is a monumental inscription to which we could not pay so much atten∣tion as it required to make it out it being grown full of moss and  much obliterated and indeed inscriptions of that class are in general of very little value The following inscriptions are also in the same wall  MAVR  IANVAR  SEMERITVS  COH V  CAECILI  PROCVL  COH X  MAEFLLF  VRSI  In a wall as we approached the house is the effigy of a man on horseback cut in relief weilding a javelin or sword Un∣derneath  is a monumental inscription de∣faced beginning in the usual manner D M The inscription as in the plate was transmitted to me by Mr Collier  In Mr Horsley's work this inscription is different to that given on the plate  XXIV Dis Manibus M Suillus victor vixit annos  The letters D M prove this also to be a sepulchral monument and the figure shews that the deceased belonged to the horse and therefore probably was one of the Ala Secunda Astorum which in the low Empire kept garrison at Cilurnum as the Notitia informs us Suillus is among the Consular names M Suillus Rupes was Consul in the year according to the Fasti C  nsulares It is therefore very probable that this name may have been designed for Marcus Su  lus Victor The sword in the right hand of the image seems to be of the Dac  an form In copying both these monuments I was obliged in some things to differ from Mr Cor∣don's representation They were found as I was told in a field called the Oxclose between Walwick Grange and the Chesters  Mr Horsley's work also contains the following inscriptions found here  XXV Jovi Optimo Maximo  This is a fine altar but the inscription by being exposed to the weather is so defaced that only I O M at the top are legible whereby it appears to have been dedicated to Jupiter Op∣timus Maximus  XXVI Dis Manibus sacrum Fabiae Honoratae Fabius Honoratus Tribunus Cohortis Primae Vangionum et Aurelia Egleciane fecerunt filiae Dulcissimae  This altar was also at the same place but is now deposited in the Durham Library It has also been published before in Mr Warburton's Map of Northumberland I take it to have been erected to the D  Manes by Fabius Honoratus and Aurelia Egleciane the parents of Fabia Honoratae deceased I suppose the letter E is wanting at the beginning of the sixth line Eg∣le  ane has been of Grecian extract  Three centurial stones imperfect No and  XXX Cohortis Sextae Centuria Deliviana  This was in the face of the Roman wall about a furlong west from Towerlaw and near an exploratory turret It is one of those which have been published in the Transactions by Dr Hunter  XXXI Cohortis Sextae Logus suavis posuit  This is built up in the inner wall of the cottage at Towerlaw I perceive that it must be the same which was published by Dr Hunter in the Transactions being a small monument erected by the sixth Cohort in that Loco Suavi as the Doctor reads and explains it who observed to me also the peculiarity of connecting the O and C together I once suspected that it might be Laus Suavis the original favours the other reading but I rather incline to Mr Ward's opi∣nion that it is to be read Logus Suavis both which names occur several times in Gruter When the Doctor copied this it was with the others in the face of the wall  Dr Hunter has given more of these inscriptions but Mr Horsley could not find the originals Two of them are thus according to his description  COH X  IVNRV  COH VI  LIRE  M S  These must have been erected by the Centuries or Centurions of the th and th Cohorts though the names of them are not compleat and therefore uncertain  The Doctor has added two more consisting each of a line ELIVLIANI and  CVSINIO I think there is no doubt but these also must have been the names of Centurions the former is the genitive and the latter is the nominative case both which are usual I suppose the first had the centurial mark prefixed to it though then effaced or else overlooked by the Doctor and I think his name must have been Flavius Julianus  At a little distance from the Grange is the fragment of a cross with a sheathed sword cut on it as the token of a treaty of peace but to what event it relates is not known  Before I quit the Chesters I must remark a Consular Medallion of Hadrian's found there four inches in circumference with the head in bold relief the legend  Hadriano Aug Caesari  with a lauriated border or civic garland on the reverse and this legend  S P Q R Optimo Prin∣cipi S C  Senat Popul  RomanCives Servator or Senatus Consulto  The Consuls entering on their office on the st of January  a day sacred to Janus it was observed with great solemnity as pre∣paratory to the felicity of the new year and the Cusular coins were then minted  Below the Chesters the foundations of a bridge are apparent at low water supposed to be of Roman construction and it is said cramps of iron have been observed in the work  We passed over Chollerford Bridge in our way to Hexham Walter Skirlaw Bishop of Durham in the th year of the reign of King Richard II granted a release from penance for days to all such as should contribute by labour or money to the repairs of this bridge  To all christian people to whom these presents shall come Walter Bishop of Durham Health in our Lord Everlasting  Whereas the Bridge at Chollerford as we hear is decayed by the innudation of the waters by which there used to be a frequent passage and now wants repair We therefore confiding in the mercy of Almighty God and the sufferings of his Holy Mother and all the Saints do release unto all our parishioners and those in our diocese where this indulgence shall be re∣ceived days of their injoined penance upon condition they lend a helping hand to the re∣pairing of the said bridge or contribute their pious charity thereto These presents after three years nothing availing Given at Chester the th Kal of August of our pontificate the th year  Walter was translated from Bath to the See of Durham d April  As we approached Hexham the prospect opened upon us in a beautiful manner the cultivated vale was painted with all the happy assemblage of woods meadows and corn lands through which flows the Tyne the northern and southern streams having united forming upon the valley various broad canals by its winding course At the conflux of the rivers lays the sweet retirement of NETHERWARDEN defended from the northwest by lofty eminences and facing the vale towards the east hallowed to the churchmen as being the retirement of St John of Beverley a Bishop of Hexham in so distant an age as A little further and opposite to Hexham on an eminence stands the church of ST JOHN LEE beneath whose scite the banks for near a mile are laid out in agreeable walks formed in a happy taste appertaining to the mansion of the Jurin family a modern building seated at the foot of the descent and fronting towards Hexham having a rich lawn of meads between it and the river This place is called the HERMITAGE  its situation favours the title but from whom it was derived is not known  This was the estate of Dr James Jurin a Physician of eminence in London Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge He was editor of Varenius's Geography and author of many learned dissertations He was Fellow of the College of Physicians and of the Royal Society is st  ed by Voltaire in his Journal  de Scavans  "the famous Jurin"  Wallis  Mr Pennant says St John of Beverley made the adjacent woods his retreat from the world which gave name to the place  A Tour to Scotland part p  From what authority this is asserted I do not know it seems to be supported by the name of Mr Jurin's House only  From thence the vale extends itself in Breadth and is termi∣nated with the town of Corbridge the hills which arise gradually from the plain on every hand are well cultivated and own the seats of many distinguished families Over this pleasing scene Hexham from an eminence looks like a gracious Princess on the opulence of her depen∣dants rejoicing in their prosperity and peace  HEXHAM  is a place of great antiquity Bede called it Hangustald by the old English Saxons it was named Hextolderham and some authors parti∣cularly Camden say it is the  Axelodunum  of the Romans that name implying its high situation by the application of the old British name  Dunum  a hill by  Hextol  a little rivulet so called which washes its western foot  Richard a Prior of Hexham who flourished near years ago writes  Not far from the river Tyne southward there standeth a town in these days of no great magnitude and thinly inhabited but in times past as the remains of antiquity bear witness very large and stately This place is named  He  tolde  ham  from a little rivulet which runs near it Ethel∣dreda wife of King Egfrid gave it to St Wilfrid that it might be created an Episcopal See about the year He built a church here which for its beauty and excellent archi∣tecture exceeded all the Ministers in England  William of Malmsbury writes  This was crown land when Wilfrid obtained it of Queen Etheldreda in Exchange It was wonderful to see what buildings were erected there with mighty high walls and how they were set out and contrived with divers turnings in and out by winding stairs all polished and garnished by the curious workmanship of Masons and  Pargetters  whom the hope of his liberality had allured from Rome So that these buildings carried the shew of the Romish magnificence and stood very strong struggling with time  Most of our Antiquaries believe the origin of Hexham to be derived from the Romans Camden says the first Cohort of the Spaniards had  their Station here but Horsley contradicts Camden's name of  Axelo∣dunum  and conjectures it was  Epiacum  placing the  Cohors Prima His∣paniorum  at  Burgh  on Sands in Cumberland  In the reign of Egfrid King of Northumberland A D it was made an Episcopal See by St Wilfrid then Archbishop of York who through the enthusiastic fervour of Etheldrida  Etheldrida was daughter to Anna King of the East Angles and was first married to Ton∣beret a Grandee in her father's court with whom she lived a virgin three years She lived with Egfrid years still preserving her virginity By unceasing importunities she prevailed with the King to permit her to retire to a nunnery She received the veil from Finam Bishop of Lindisfern in the abbey of Coldingham then under the government of Ebba the King's aunt Bede L Rich Hagul c Dugdale Monast vol  Egfrid's Queen which that skilful Ecclesiastic knew how to possess the territory of Hexham∣shire was granted to the church of St Andrew which he had founded The church was raised by workmen brought from Italy and by Histo∣rians of that time said to exceed in beauty and elegance every other edifice in the land  On Chad's retiring Wilfrid became sole Bishop of Northumberland that is of all King Osway's dominions which extended from the Humber to the Firth of Forth and had been in∣creased by the conquest he had lately made of Lincolnshire which was then part of the Mercian dominions on the south of Humber Besides this vast diocese Wilfrid had the government of nine abbies and being ever ready to accept and also to solicit the most extravagant dona∣tives which the ignorant superstition of the age prompted the great ones to bestow he built and adorned in the most sumptuous manner his churches and abbies employing in those works the most skilful artists he could procure from France and Italy His magnificence in other re∣spects was in no wise inferior for in his family the sons of many of the Northumbrian Nobles resided for their education his attendants were numerous his furniture splendid and at his table he is said to have been served in gold Bede L R Hagulst c Edd c  His principal works were the reparation of the cathedral of York the roof of which he co∣vered with lead and glazed its windows A D and the building of the two magnificent churches of Ripon and Hexham Eddius describes him as attended in his progresses when performing his episcopal functions not only by his fingers of whom Eddius himself was one but by masons and artists of almost every kind Ed c Wilfrid's adversity was derived from an aversion the King took against him apprehending the Bishop had influenced the Queen to turn Nun Which aversion was not a little increased by the Bishop's immoderate wealth and ambition Bede L He died at his monastry of Oundle in Northamptonshire and was buried in the church of St Peter at Ripon Bede gives his Epitaph as follows  Wilfridus hic magnus requiescit corpore presul  Hanc

of Northumberland into three dioceses York Lindisfarn and Hexham thereby dismembring Hexham of great part of its territories  Eata soon afterwards being translated to Lindisfarn was succeeded at Hexham by Tumbert A D This Bishop was deposed by a Council held at Twiford near the river Alne A D at which King Egfrid was present with Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury at whose instance this Convocation was held for the intent of examining Tumbert's denial of his jurisdiction as Provincial over the churches  St Cuthbert a Monk of Lindisfarn then an Anchorite on Farn Island was elected to Hexham and with great reluctance received the Episco∣pacy he was translated to Lindisfarn and Eata returned to Hexham  John de Beverley  Miracles were not the least of the merits for canonization St John of Beverley was of noble birth and a man of great learning Venerable Bede was educated by him and Bede admits he received his order of priesthood from him  Now though John Baptist did none yet John of Beverley is said to have done many miracles By making the sign of the cross on a dumb youth with a scalled head not only restored to speech and a head of hair but eloquent discourse and brave curled locks Some years before his death he quitted his arch∣bishoprick and retired to his monastry at Beverley where he died and which afterwards King Athelstan made I will not call it a sanctuary because unhallowed by the largeness of the liberties allowed thereunto but a place of refuge for murderers and malefactors So that the  freed Stool  in Beverley became the seat of the scornful and such heinous offenders as could recover the same did therein securely defy all legal prosecution against them  Fuller's Ch Hist  He spent the rest of his time in his monastry of Beverley and died there in May and was buried in the church porch He was famous for working miracles both living and dead Malmsbury Westminister and Higded report one very strange thing which continued to their time

hampered with cords with several strong men to drag them along who as soon as they entered the church yard in Beverley dropped their fierce and formidable nature and were as came as if they had been metamorphosed into sheep And the people were so well assured of their inoffensiveness that they used to turn them loose and play with them  Collier's Eccl Hist  was the next Bishop of Hexham and

restoration and repair of this church a curious inscription on square pieces of wood originally unnoticed by most visiters is represented in the annexed plate I did not discover it on my first visit

read Orate pro anima Dni Thomae S Pater hujus  Ecclesiae  Qui fecit hoc  Opus  The Italicks supply the parts of the inscription now lost  Mr Pennant has given the reading of this inscription in the second part of his Tour in Scotland having had the same communicated to him by my fellowtraveller Mr Bailey but therein he introduces the word  Prior  for  Pater  Hexham having suffered great distress under an incursion of the Scots in the reign of Edward the First A D when the priory and part of the cathedral were burnt in the th year of that reign  soon after this devastation an inquisition was taken of the pos∣sessions of the church dated at Newcastle on Tyne July in which the particulars of the revenue were set forth too tedi∣ous to be inserted here and of little consequence to the traveller  I will extract the names of Benefactors from Mr Wallis's book as it may gratify the cu∣riosity of the reader  Thomas Archbishop of York gave to this priory founded by him the church with

grant of confirmation  The whole at the dissolution was valued at l s d according to Dugdale and l s d as it is set forth in Speed There were then Religious in the abbey Edward Tay Prior  This church possessed that ignominious privilege called Sanctuary till taken away by Henry VIII in on which the disqualifying statute fixes an everlasting stigma by enacting  that gross offenders against the laws taking sanctuary at the altar or any consecrated place should be out of the protection of churches  implying that such pollutions had rendered obnoxious even the most sacred places  The famous TRIDSTOL or Stool of Peace is still preserved here Whoever took possession of it was sure of remission  The like in Beverley  This place had the privilege of a sanctuary which was not merely confined to the church but extended a mile four ways  Steven's Cont Dugdale II  and the limits each way marked by a cross Heavy penalties were levied on those who dared to violate this sanctuary by seizing on any criminal within the prescribed bounds but if they presumed to take him out of the  stool  Richard of Hexham as quoted by Stavely Hist Ch  the offence was not redeemable by any sum it was esteemed  botoless  beyond the power of pecuniary amends and the offenders were left to the utmost severity of the church and suffered excommu∣nication in old times the most terrible of punishments  Pennant's Tour in Scotland part II  In Hexham were two Hospitals one for Lepers the other for the Sick both well endowed  The Archbishop of York enjoyed great privileges here to enquire of which a Quo Warranto was issued in the st year of the reign of King Edward I to shew  by what authority he claimed to have all  Capitulas  of the Crown delivered to his Bailiff to be pleaded by Jus∣tices whom he should assign for that purpose concerning all things arising within his manor of Hextoldersham and that all pleas as well of the Crown as other pleas be pleaded by his writs and his Justices in his said manor to take and have the issues and profits arising thereby and to do and execute by his officers all things per∣taining to the office of Sheriff and Coroner and that no Bailiff of the King do enter into the said manor to execute any office And to have the custody of prisoners and make delivery of them at his will And to have market gallows chattels of fugitives and felons con∣demned in the said manor without leave of the King and his proge∣nitors which things do pertain to the King's crown and dignity  To which the Bishop pleaded his claim from ancient time and usage from time immemorialin consequence of which these privileges of a Palatine were confirmed by the King and Council In the th year of the reign of King Edward III Hexham had Jura Regalia confirmed and the right of levying Tenths and Fifteenths  In the second year of Henry the Fifth's reign Hexham was stripped of those privileges as being an asylum of thieves and robbers  The tenants within this manor as subjects of a Palatinate were ex∣empt from all other public subsidies than those raised by their Palatine  Hexham came to the Crown under Archbishop Holgate who ex∣changed this manor for some abbey lands in the th year of the reign  of Henry VIII retaining nothing but the special jurisdiction In the th year of Queen Elizabeth it was annexed to the county of Nor∣thumberland and the manor being soon after sold devolved on the late Sir Walter Calverly Blackett  The remains of this ancient cathedral bear innumerable marks of magnificence Many ancient tombs are here within the quire is the recumbent effigy of an Ecclesiastic hooded on a table monument of black marble in relief at the foot a shield with uncommon arms or rather an emblematical device to denote mortality being the resemblance of cross bones The people who keep the doors say it is the tomb of Prior Richard an Historian of the th century He was some time a Monk here and occurs Prior A D The device on the shield if it is presumed to be the tomb of Richard will then appear to be the letters  ri  placed one over the other Mr Wallis's Antiquities which I have frequent occasion to quote says  these arms are argent a saltier gules and that contiguous to this tomb an helmet is fixed denoting that this personage before he was an Ecclesiastic was of some mili∣tary order  He also supposes he was Prior hereIf it were not for the ample field of imagination and inexhaustable conjectures the em∣ployment of Antiquaries would be dull indeedI cannot forbear dis∣senting from this learned visiter Immediately adjoining this tomb stands a shrine  In the choir is a beautiful Oratory of stone below and wood above most exquisitely carved now converted into a pew Near that is the tomb of a Religious probably a Prior Above in a shield are in Saxon characters the letters RI these being in many parts of the building are probably the initials of some of the pious benefactors  Pennant's Tour in Scotland part II  of woodwork after the ancient form supported on pillars canopied and ornamented with tabernaclework such as in the early ages of the church distinguished the place where the remains of great personages or saints were deposited this is surrounded with stonework having figures in various niches which by reason of the stalls built against them I could not make out At the eastern end of this shrine within is an altar above which are painted the sufferings of our Lord On the canopy or roof are the arms on a shield very fresh  Azure  the saltier if it is such  Or  Behind the high altar and in other parts of the church I perceived the same arms and also in the walls of the priory from whence I am led to believe this is the tomb of one of the Priors a great benefactor to the church and the  Insignia  a cross of the dedicatory St Andrew formed of the two first letters of the Prior's name  The Religious of the Order of St Austin were hooded  I observed under a seat near adjoining two effigies each about inches high cut in alto relievo in niches on a grit stone  In a square hole in a corner of the Oratory is an uncouth head of Jupiter and in the inside a Hare the emblem of watchfulness Against a pillar is a ridiculous figure of a bare∣footed man with a great club perhaps a pilgrim  Pennant's Tour in Scotland part II  It in no wise represents a Pilgrim he carries no scrip and wears a cap or helmet  the one  fig IIII I conceive represents Silenus large eared fitting resting his head on his hand his elbow supported on his knee  The other fig I I apprehend is designed for Jupiter And near the altar stands a figure of stone about three feet eight inches high sup∣porting himself on a staff on his head something that appears like a helmet or a cap and plume and round his ancles three wreaths or fet∣ters This fig III I apprehend is the figure of Pan It is reasonable to conjecture they have been saved from the ruins when the Roman re∣mains in the vaults were obtained Some travellers have concluded these were the works of monkish times The effigies are accurately re∣presented in the annexed plates and the reader will from thence deter∣mine according to his own judgment  The tomb of Umfrevill one of the family of the Earls of Angus mentioned by Camden  Within the quire is to be seen a tomb of a nobleman of that warlike family Umfrevills with his legs across and his escutcheon of arms at his side after which fashion in those days were they only interred who took upon them the cross and were marked with the badge of the cross for sacred warfare to recover the Holy Land from the Mahomedans and Turks  Camd Brit  remains in the south aile not much mutilated This family were benefactors to the church of Hexham  A little below in the same aile is the tomb of Sir Robert Ogle with the arms of Bertram and Ogles quartered and an inscription in brass dated These were ancient families in Northumberland the Ogles owned seven Lords and thirty Knights of their race having large pos∣sessions before the conquest  In the north aile is a monument in the wall of such a form as usu∣ally designed at the building of churches for founders or great bene∣factors but to what personage this belongs is not known no insignia or inscription remaining It is supposed to be the tomb of Alfwold King of Northumberland who was assassinated at Cilchester by Sigga a factious Lord of his Court on the d of September A D I measured an effigy which lays near this tomb and found it answering exactly in length The tomb is formed in an aperture made through the wall by an elegant piece of arched work The effigy represents an Ecclesiastic with his hood thrown back to his forehead his hands ele∣vated and robed to the feet the folds of the drapery thrown into ex∣cellent order easy and elegant  On the screen at the entrance of the quire are some strange monastic paintings vulgarly stiled  Death's Dance  a ludicrous representation of the universal influence of that insatiable tyrant over all ranks of men beginning with the fullchested Cardinal and triply coronated Pope and leading into his mazes the Prince and Peasant but I am so dis∣gusted with the church paintings I have seen in other places that I had not patience to attend to this defilement of the tabernacle There are some grim and lionlike Saints painted in the ailes among whom stands St John of Beverley of hideous aspect  In the pavement of the cross aile are several monuments one in∣scribed  "Hic Jacet Thomas de Devilston"  and ornamented with a crosier another with a crosier and chalice inscribed  "Johannes Dew"  with the usual legendary prayer in the margin  Orate per anima  c  In a part behind the north door is the recumbent effigy of a Knight which Mr Wallis says represents Henry Beaufort Duke of Somerset taken prisoner and beheaded at Hexham by King Edward the Fourth his shield  Or  bearing a  fesse az  with  three garbs proper  I think it im∣probable this monument was erected for a traitor who died an ignomi∣nious  death besides it cannot be any of the Beaufort family as they quartered the arms of England I rather conceive this was one of the Aydens of Ayden Castle the arms assumed by the Edens of the North at this day being greatly similar The male line of the family of Aydens of Ayden Castle was extinct in Edward the First's time and Emma the heiress and relict of that family was by him as a royal ward given in marriage to Wallis  The interior architecture of this church is highly finished in the mixed Gothic order the pillars are clustered supporting Gothic arches the members of the archings and the pilasters finely proportioned The quire is roofed with wood covered with lead and the side ailes are arched with stone a double gallery runs round the whole opening with Saxon arches each opening is composed of three arches the centre circular the side ones pointed of which the workmanship is very fine and the pillars light The principal pillars of this structure in general are rather disproportionate and heavy an error seen in most of the Saxon churches  The Mercers Company in London under the will of Richard Fish∣born  Esq  about the year founded a Lectureship here which they endowed by a purchase of tithes Sir Walter Calverly Blackett gave several valuable gifts for the augmentation of the living and many charities have been left for the relief of the poor It is a doubt with me whether these donations to the poor do not induce indigent and impotent persons to crowd a town and in effect encourage idleness Had the donors disposed the same sums for instituting and supporting a manufactory the encouragement to industry would have brought with it opulence instead of crowds of mendicants  Mr Gale and Dr Stukeley in the year visited the vaults of this church now used as a private burialplace What will not Curiosity attempt They have given two inscriptions discovered there the one containing a new name of a  Legatus Augusti  viz  Q Calpurnius concessinius  and that of a body of horse at Corchester called  Equites Caesarienses  or  Caesariani Coronotatae  not mentioned either in the  Notitia Imperii  or else∣where The other of  Lucius Septimus Severus  by them said to be of the best sculpture the letters large but the inscription imperfect The cu∣riosity remarked by these Antiquaries consists in this monument having  so distinctly the name of that Emperor and its being the only genuine one found so near the wall with his name on it  Mr Horsley gives the first of these inscriptions in the following manner  LEG A  Q CALPVRNVS  CONCESSINI  VS PRAEF EQ  CAESA OORI  ONOTOTAR  VM MANVPR  AESENTISSIMI  NVMINVS DEVS  Legato Augustati Propraetore Quintus Calpurnius Concessinius Praefectus equitum Caesariensium Coronototarum manu Praesentissimi Numinis dei votum solvit  To this reading he adds the following remarks  The Rev Mr Andrews of Hexham obliged a friend of mine with a copy of the same inscriptions which he had taken This inscrip∣tion is upon a Roman altar I had leave to descend into the vault and view the inscriptions I spent some time in examining every par∣ticular and have here represented them as I found them with the greatest impartiality Every word and letter that remains in this is so plain as to leave no room for any doubt The not taking notice that the altar and inscription are both of them imperfect at the top is the only material defect in the former representation I look upon it as certain that the letters which have filled up the deficient part of the line have been VG PR PR for thus the number of letters in this line will answer to the number in the others I think also there have been two or three lines above which are broken off these have probably contained the name of the Legate and of the God to whom the altar had been inscribed The conjectures in the letters in Mr Gordon's appendix are very ingenious and the arguments used in support of them very learned and curious The author supposes that here is the name of a new Legate as also of a new body of horse called  Equites Caesarienses  or  Caesariani Corionototae  the name  Equites  Caesarienses  is there justified by a parallel instance in Gruter and the name  Corionototae  that gentleman supposes to be a corruption of the Roman name of a people in these parts perhaps  Curia  or  Coria Otodinor  and that Corbridge was the place The rest of the inscription he ju∣diciously explains to be a flattering acknowledgment of this person that he was promoted by the immediate hand of the Emperor it be∣ing no new thing to call the Emperors Gods and erect altars to them But in a matter so entirely conjectural it is very excusable to suspend one's assent and the more explanations are offered it is the more probable that the truth will be found out If  Q Calpurnius Concessinius  was the Imperial Legate I scarce think that he would in the same in∣scription stile himself  Praefect of Horse  I rather believe as I hinted before that the name of the Legate has been above and is broken off Perhaps it has been  sub Legato Augustali  or  pro saluti Legati Au∣gustalis  As to the word  Corionototarum  Extract of a Letter from  Sir John Clerk  to  R Gale  Esq  As to your inscription from Hexham it is evident the artificer has been very unsuccessful and that his chisel has stammered into more syllabus than were necessary in the word Corio∣nototarum I humbly think it ought to have been Coriatarum and that the people of Cor∣chester were called Coriatae as the Spartans of old were called Spartiatae or Spartietas much used by Herodotus  I rather suppose that Pto∣lemy's  Coria  or  Curia  was a town of the  Gadeni  than of the  Otadini  Ptolemy's  Coritani  are a people of one of the  Provinciae Caesarienses  in Britain and possibly from hence these horse might have the name of  Caesarienses Coritani Coriotiotar  in the anonymous  Ravenuas  is not unlike this name I suppose it may have been mistaken by some tran∣scriber for  Coriotiotae  or  Corionototae  the shape of the Gothic  E  is not unfavourale to this but it seems more probable to me that it was from some more distant country than any part of Britain that these troops had the name of  Caesarienses Corionototae  or  Caesarienses Corionoto∣tarum  The  Crotoniatae  inhabitants of  Croton  a city in Greece are celebrated by  Strabo  according to whom 'the last of these was equal to the first of the other Greeks' Possibly this name may have been designed for  Crotoniatarum  if this be admitted we may more easily account for the Greek inscriptions at Corbridge and Lanchester and for the more evidences of Grecian Auxiliaries that appear in the neighbourhood The explication of the rest of the inscription by the same learned gentleman whom I mentioned above is certainly just that  Praesentissimum Numen dei  signifies the Emperor and  manu  inti∣mates that  Q Calpurnius  was advanced to his post by the immediate  From the Manuscripts of the late Roger Gale  Esq  hand of this Emperor supposed to be  Commodus  who least deserved such titles and yet most insisted on them I find  Numini Praesenti  in an inscription to  Caracalla  The word  Praesenti  seems to be used in a different sense in these cases from that of Horace  Praesenti tibi maturos largimur honores  Jurandasque tuum per Numen ponimus aras  And again in his Ode concerning Regulus  Praesens divus habebitur  Augustus adjectis Britannis  Imperio  To what particular Emperor this inscription must be referred is hard to determine with certainty  Our curiosity urged us at the distance of years after those learned visiters had inspected the vaults to see the antiquities they mention perhaps they had entered into open cells then unused for sepulture our descent was more solemn These vaults have for several years past been used as a private burialplace and the entrance is covered with a table of marble of prodigious size which is not usually moved but at the denunciation of mortality The massive  Claustrum  was heaved from the mouth of the vault by iron crows and rollers at which the ground trembled over the archesby a ladder we descended about feet into the regions of the dead where avaricious curiosity making an anxious research after the objects of its desire so compleatly occupied the mind that scarce one reflection was agitated for those over whose ashes we wantonly trampled These vaults which anciently were within the west end of the cross have been built of the stones of a Roman station many cornices mouldings and ornaments with fragments of inscrip∣tions are scattered through the walls We found the preceding in∣scription correspond exactly with the plate in Mr Horsley's works The narrow vault on the left hand is roofed over with flat stones on the furthest of which the following inscription is preserved but from its situation and the stone being reversed rendered difficult to be read My companion and I took it with great attention both in the letters as reversed and as well as we could see them direct Our copies exactly corresponded with each other and yet they differ from Mr Horsley's in whose plates it is thus represented  IMP CAES L SEP  PERT  AXET IMP C  AVRANTONIN  VSII  HORT  VEXILLATION  FERVNT  Imperator Caesar Lucius Septimius Pertinax et Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius Felix Augustus et Geta Caesar Cohortium Vex∣illationes fecerunt  To this reading he adds  There can be no great doubt with relation to the former part of it which is not unlike the inscription at Burgh in Richmondshire a copy of which was long ago published by Mr Camden and runs thus Imperatori Caesari Marco Antonino Pio Aurelio Felici Augusto c Then follows a space where the name of Geta has been erased Just so in this inscription at Hexham after much the same names and titles given to Severus and Caracalla there fol∣lows a small space where it is manifest the words have been design∣edly erased with a tool I suppose the Vexillatio Legionis was made up of the several Vexillations of the particular Cohorts and perhaps they might retain the name of Vexillationes Cohortium when the Vexillations of all the Cohorts of the Legion that is the whole Vex∣illation of the Legion itself was not present These then might be the Vexillations of some Cohorts of one of the Legions which were employed in building the wall that might be occasionally at Hex∣ham and erect this inscription Some of the inscription facing the right hand is covered in the wall on which the inscribed stone rests The lower part of the stone is also fixed in the end wall of one of the passages into the vault but not so as to hinder the lowest line from being read though not without difficulty The letters FERVNT are distinct and certain and as much room is between the E and R as will contain CE so that beyond all question it has been fecerunt which compleats the inscription The stone has had a raised bordering which was spoiled and made level with the rest of the stone when it was built up in this place  It is with the utmost diffidence I offer to the public remarks upon this inscription where they do not agree with the very learned Anti∣quaries  who before copied it The beginning of the inscription seems to be IMP CAES SEV but the line is imperfect and broken off I could not discover the L in this line The second line appeared to be VERON AXEL IMPO And the beginning of the third line an AA mixed  An inscription in the Cottonian collection found at Bowes in York∣shire mentions the Vettones as follows  VIRIVS LVPVS  LEG AVG PR PR  Propraetor under Severus  BALINEVM VI  IGNIS EXVST  VM COH I THR  ACVM REST  ITVIT  CVRAN  TE VAL FRON  TONE PRAEF  EQ ALAE VETTO    These people were sometimes stiled Verones and at other times Vet∣tones  Verones a people of Spain so called from the river which washed their borders Sil sed alii codd habent VettonesVettones bordering on Celtiberia Sil  Ainsworth  Camden says a Cohort of Spaniards were stationed at Hexham The inscription by having one side lodged in the wall may now ap∣pear with a great diminution I would not have offered my observa∣tions but that they may induce some future visiter to reconcile these differences I own it difficult to give a reasonable conjecture how the names of  Severus  and  Antoninus  could be mixed in this inscription  S Imp A D  A  Before I quit the subject of these inscriptions I must add that Mr Horsley says  these stones and inscriptions argue Hexham to have been a Roman Station for the plenty of free stone so near makes it im∣probable that in the modern buildings or those later than Roman they would have fetched any stones either from the Roman Wall or from Corbridge And this might have been a town in the Roman times and yet not be mentioned in the Itinerary nor continue so late as  till the writing of the Notitia I know not what name to give it un∣less we suppose it to have been Ptolemy's Epiacum The situation of this does by no means answer but it is plain from Vinovium and Galatum that Ptolemy is here in confusion and the mutual dis∣tances between these three places are not so far wrong as their si∣tuation  I have elsewhere proved that it is not Axelodunum though it has long been possessed of that name  At the west end of the church are the remains of the priory It was a spacious building with an adjoining cloister The refectory is yet entire and serves as a room of entertainment at public times is very spacious with a roof of oak work What remains of the cloisters shews they were of excellent workmanship the tabernacle work and pilasters above the seats are elegant the door case opposite which formerly was an entrance into the church is richly wrought

This place is not very populous the inhabitants being computed at souls the streets are narrow and ill built The Marketplace near the centre of the town is a spacious square in which is a conve∣nient piazza for the butchermeat the stalls being moveable The town is supplied by a fluent fountain of water in the Marketplace Two markets are held here in the week on Thursday and Saturday and there are two annual fairs  Leading to the priory is a gateway of very ancient architecture the arches form a semicircle and are moulded in a stile which denotes their antiquity to be much greater than any part of the priory or ca∣thedral There is nothing similar to this work in proportion of mem∣bers about the church or any thing in Hexham I could discover that appeared cotemporary The roof of the gateway is of ribbed arching meeting in the centre the interstices filled with thin stones or bricks such as are seen in Roman works The passage is divided into a large gateway for horsemen or carriages and a narrow one for foot passen∣gers The superstructure is in ruins Mr Pennant says this gate  is of the old Saxon architecture and perhaps part of the labours of the great Wilfrid  There are two ancient towers in the town the one used as a Court or Sessionshouse anciently an exploratory tower belonging to the Bishops and Priors of Hexham the other situated on the top of the hill towards the Tyne of remarkable architecture being square containing very small apertures to admit the light and having a course of corbels pro∣jecting a long way from the top which seem to have supported a hang∣ing gallery and bespeak the tower at present not near its original height The founders of these places are not known Camden says "he heard they appertained to the Archbishop of York" This lastmentioned tower having two dreadful dungeons within it doubtless has been the chief fortress of the place and was used as a prison when the Bishops of Hexham possessed their palatine jurisdiction  In one of the chambers remaining in this tower is the inscription on the plate Mr Bailey who was my companion was informed of it on a late visit to Hexham and did me the favour to communicate it He describes it as cut with a knife on the oak lintle of the chimney which remains rough and uneven The room is of a considerable size but appears to have had no windows or any lights but what was re∣ceived through loopholes in the walls The Gaoler now uses the apart∣ment for a hayloft The inscription seems to be the labour of some Scotch prisoner and by the character is of no very distant antiquity By the two letters at the beginning of the inscription I apprehend it was done in the reign of one of the James's and give it the greatest antiquity under the Scotch royal line of that name it will only carry it to the beginning of the th century Notwithstanding I am obliged  to confess I do not understand it I thought it necessary to insert it and shall be obliged to the reader for an explanation which may ap∣pear in some future edition of this work  This place has owned several learned men John de Hexham and Richard de Hexham both Superiors of this religious house and great Historians The Addenda to

and benefactors to the churches poor and free schools in Tyndale ward to which is added a brief account and description of the parish and parish church of Hex∣ham with an abstract of Queen Elizabeth's patent for the free school and the statutes thereof  In the Marketplace on the front of an old house are three coats of armour in plaisterwork opinions are various what they denominate the most probable is that the dexter arms is that of the Dean and Chap∣ter of York the centre the cross of St Andrew to whom the church was dedicated and the sinister one being one of the  Arm  Cantantia  or

in civil bloodshed the slaughter made by the NorthRiding Yorkshire Militia on the Miners in their insur∣rection is remembered with horror No troops in the world could have stood with greater steadiness and military propriety than they did sustaining the insults of an enraged crew of subterranean Savages whilst the tim'rous Magistrates delayed their command for defence till the arms of the

of antiquity mentioned in the letters given in the notes  From the Manuscripts of the late Roger Gale  Esq  Extract of a Letter from  Roger Gale  Esq  to  Mr John Warburton  Somerset Herald F R S  London  August th  SIR  I shall endeavour to procure you what you mention in your last to me out of the  Aliena∣tion Office  as soon as I can and transmit it to you Among the books you tell me you are master of I find  Doomsday  to be one pray let me know what it is you have of that for I cannot think it is an entire copy of what is lodged in the Exchequer though I could heartily with it were as also what you call  Bede's Albinus Anglus  for I do not remember any thing among Bede's works under that title The MS volume of  Leland  in my study touches a little upon the North Riding of Yorkshire but I fear will be of little service to you he treats of  gain in another of the printed volumes but what he gives you of it is there also very thin and trivial I have ordered a copy of my  E  sa  to be transcribed here by the printed one with some corrections I have made to it and shall send it you by the next return of  Mr P  ing  and hope it may be of some service to you You will find in it that I have taken notice of five great Ways instead of four according to the general account of our Historians who only copied from one another and have pointed out their several courses more exactly than has been done by any body else The reason they have given you an account but of four I take to be their notion that there were no more of them which can cross the island from sea to sea and that I believe is true but that there were others in great numbers is unquestion∣able The great Way you mention that comes from  Dunbritton Frith  to  Rochester  in  Nor∣  and  falls into or may be a continuation of the  Ermin street  which you will find in the Essay I have traced from  Arundell  in  Suffex  to  Gatherley Moor  in your neighbourhood and there followed two branches of it one to  Carli  le  and the other to  Tynmouth  but I  was wholly ignorant of this third discovered since by you I shall not here give you the reasons why this is the  Erminstreet  but refer you to the Essay for them and in the mean time only further add that the  Watling street  is the truliest described by  Higden  of any of them but it did not terminate at  Cardigan  as he says but at  West Chester  and that the course of it is very visible almost every where that he mentions it and that I have myself one time or other travelled upon the greatest part of it and found it seldom or never loses its name I fancy the country people calling that which you suspect to be the  Watlingstreet  in  Northumberland  by that name has been the chief motive for your opinion but I could give you several in∣stances of old Ways sometimes called  Watlingstreet  and sometimes the  Fosse Way  by the vulgar in counties where it is certain those Ways never came so that nothing is to be built upon that  Antoninus's  second journey indeed takes in the whole length of it but not till it falls into it at  Deva  or  Chester  The Roman Station at  Ethelburgh  is taken notice of by  Camden  who makes it more than probable from an inscription there dug up that it was called  Bruchium  To confirm this opinion I will give you a conjecture of mine taken from the  Monasticon Anglicanum  vol I p where in an old deed this very place is named  Enthelbert  as I believe from  Enchelberi  the word  Enchel  in  Welsh  signifying an  Arm brachium  the very name in Latin and British thus corresponding Besides I cannot but be of opinion that  Brementonacis  was at  Overborough  on the edge of  Lancashire  it lying in the direct way be∣tween  Gallacum Whellop Castle  and  Coccium Ribblechester  from which latter place it keeps the just distance allotted it by  Antoninus  and tho' the copies of that  Itinerary  place it from the former instead of miles upon a little consideration you will find the mistake might be easily occasioned by the transcribers turning the third X into V I do not know whether you have seen the edition of  Antoninus  published by me some years ago if you have not my brother at  Scruton  can lend it you it may perhaps be diverting to you though I must own I have since the publication of it found reason to make several alterations in it as I have done upon my own book that I have here by me and among others I must acknow∣ledge it that your Map has fully convinced me that  Glanoventa  and  Gallana  in the  tenth Itinerary  are at  Thornton  and  Portgate  and not where my unacquaintedness with the coun∣try had induced me to place them but  Alone  I take to be  Whitley Castle  in  Alondale  as well from the better agreement of the miles as from an inscription there left by the  Cohors Tertia Nerviorum  which the  Notitia Imperii  quarters at  Alone  I am pretty much of your mind that the military way from  Easingwould  to  Thirst  came from  York  towards  Caturactonium  or rather into that which went from  Caturactonium  towards  Gatherley Moor  because I am very much mistaken if there is not a military way running along the northern bank of  Swale  from  Catterick Bridge  eastward towards  Bolton  Now I take the course of this road to have gone by  Thornton in the Street  to  Thornbrough  and by  Romandby  near  Northallerton  which I doubt not has been a Roman Station by the name of it and you will find great works cast up about the  Castle Hills  there which are very evidently far larger and beyond the con∣fines of the modern castle I have also been told of a Roman Way some where about  Ro∣mandby  though I could never well understand where it was To this I shall add that I hardly ever met with a place named  Thornbrough  or  Thornton  that was not near some old Station such a one you have by  Catterick  another called  Thornton  and  Thornaldby  near  Ethelbury Thornton  where  Glanoventa  stood in  Northumberland Thornbrough  near  Nostre∣field Moor  and just by the  Via Vicinalis  that led from  Ethelbury  over that Moor into  Leeming∣lane  part of the  Erminstreet  and not far from  Well  where any of the inhabitants can shew  you  a Roman te  lated pavement  Having made so much use of this word I shall only add that these towns take not their names as most people imagine from  Thorns  that might grow there but from the Saxon Ðorn i e  Turris  a plain indication of their having found some such building hereabouts but which way it went from  Romandby  till it came where I told you above upon the very edge of  Swale  I must leave to your discovery neither can I so much as guess what might be the Roman name of the Station near  Northallerton  but these have brought into my mind what I had like to have passed over and that is the deriva∣tion of the name  Glan  enta  which assuredly comes from the British or Welsh  Glenwent  i e  Ripa Ventae  the  bank  of the  river Went  or  Wentsbeck  The works upon  Nostrefield Moor  consisted of  a square intrenchment  as I remember and  a small round intrenchment  with  two entrances  into it one on the southwest and the other on the northeast side of it but what is most remarkable is the  ditch  or graft which is  within the Agger  it  es or paces to the north of the square one just by the road side if I do not forget there were three or four  Tumult  thrown up within the square one and six or seven more over the hedge of the field that lies on the west side of it The military way or  Via Vicinalis  mentioned on the other side to come from  Ethelbury  runs very near these intrenchments and falls into  Leeming∣lane  not far from  Wath  and I think another ancient way seems to cross the road between  Exelby  and  Cathorp  towards the same line I am afraid Antiquities are not so much in vogue at  Court  as to obtain that reception for your  Altar  there as it really merits and perhaps after all the trouble and charge you may be at in sending it thither  his Majesty  may never see it or be so much as acquainted with your dutiful intentions I do not mention this to dis∣courage you but only that you should not meet with too great a disappointment if you meet not with the returns you may expect for it I should be glad to know what  Mr Wanley  of∣fered you for it for though the altar is so very beautiful and intire as you represent it yet the inscription contains little or no instruction it being to be read as I take it  Fortunae Po∣p  Rom  Caius Julius Rationalis Legionis Sextae Virtricis vocit  I have indeed some doubt as to the letters RAT having seen at  Durham  an altar dedicated to  Fortune  whereon the initial letters of the word  Prafectus  were wrote RAEF the P and R being both included in the first or same letter I desire you therefore to look a little closer upon your inscription when you have an opportunity to see if you cannot trace the initials of  Praefectus  it being much more usual for  the Commanding Officers of Legions  to erect  altars  than their  Accomptants  and indeed I do not remember I ever met with the  Rationalis of a Legion  in an inscription be∣fore but this will make yours the more valuable if it appears to be undoubtedly RAT for  Rationalis  Pray let me know also the name of the place where you got it dug up  I am yours c R GALE  Extract of a Letter from  Mr John Warburton  to  Roger Gale  Esq  about some of the Roman Roads  st November  I have read your Essay  Printed in the th Vol of Leland Itinerary pub∣lished by Mr Hear  e at Oxford  p  towards recovery of the four great Roman Ways over and over with greater pleasure than I ever read any thing in my life I am fully convinced that the courses you have taken for those ancient roads are perfectly right excepting that you loose the stem of the Ermin∣street upon Gatherley Moor and follow only two branches of it that go directly to  Tinmonth  and  Boulnesse  the two extremes of the Picts Wall whilst the main street proceeds northward almost in a straight line and an uninter∣rupted ridge from Piercebridge close by a small village called  Denton  where there are many  remains of antiquity and from thence continues its course by  Bolham Houghton St Helen's Auckland  and soon after crosses the Wear to  Binchester Vinovium  where are to be seen the Vestigia of a Roman Fort several broken Altars in the possession of Farrer Wren  Esq  the Lord of the Soil and a great number of Roman Coins dug up there From this place its course is generally over moorish grounds to  Langchester  where most of those altars and in∣scriptions in Durham Library were found  See Philos Transactions No  and at six miles further to  Ebchester  where it crosses the  River Derwent  and enters  Northum∣berland  from which place my Map will shew its course into  Scotland  But before I leave  Ebchester  which is inferior to no place I have mentioned for Antiquities I cannot but acquaint you that I look upon it to have been the  Vindomora  of  Antoninus  and not  Wall's End  where that Station hath hitherto been fixed since it exactly answers the dis∣tances between  Corstopitum  and  Vinovium  the second and fourth Stations in the first Iter viz nine miles from the first of them and nineteen from the latter and this in a direct line along one of the most entire regular and large ways I ever saw the ridge being for the most part two yards in height full eight yards broad and all paved with stone that it is at pre∣sent as even as if new laid whereas from  Corstopitum  or  Corbridge  to  Wall's End  the third Station in the first Iter it is twenty miles directly east and from thence back to  Vinovium  the fourth Station twentyfive miles to the westward so that we are carried eighteen miles about along a road that hath no appearance of a military way except just where it touches the  Picts Wall  and hath the river  Tyne  to pass in a part where it never could be crossed without boats which are difficulties I think the Romans would never subject themselves to  I have your edition of  Antoninus  which I frequently read and value beyond any thing of that nature but cannot yet absolutely agree with you in placing  Alone  at  Whitley Castle  not but that it appears plainly to have been a Roman Station from the greatness of its ruins and it having the Roman road called the  Maiden Way  running through its center and from the inscription left by the  Cohors Tertia Neeciorum  that  Mr Camden  gives us it is not to be doubted that they were quartered thereabouts but when I consider that the distance which the Itinerary gives betwixt  Gallana Portgate  and  Alone  if at  Whitley Castle  is but twelve miles and the real distance is twenty and on the other hand that  Old Town  in  Alondale  exactly answers the distance allotted it by  Antoninus  hath a portway seven yards broad all paved with stone ranging between them its situation on an eminence on the very brink of the river  Alon  and of a square figure intrenched and if we may give credit to the author of the additions to Camden's Britannia hath produced several Roman antiquities I am per∣suaded that Station is to be placed here besides I begin to think myself wrong in joining this Roman road which I am speaking of with that called the  Maiden Way  at  Whitley Castle  and am partly of opinion that it did not go so far west but rather struck over by the head of the river  Teys  to  Ethelburgh  in Yorkshire and from thence went by  Coccuim  to  Mancunium  and that  Whelp Castle  and  Overburrough  if Roman Stations are either in the military way that comes from  Ambleside  towards  Kendale  which perhaps unites with it at  Coccium Ribblechester  or on that called the  Maiden Way  which goes by  Whitley Castle  This opinion is very much strengthened by a new discovered military way of the very same dimensions and work with that on which  Glanoventa  stands and  Galana  and which runs from  Ethelburgh  full north over a moor called  Windgate  and at a small village called  Crackpot  crosses the river  Swale  and soon after enters another named  Feetham  where I must leave it at present on account of the season At my parting with it it seemed to point at  Barnard Castle  See Mr Warburton's Map of Yorkshire which shews it to have gone northward to Barnard Cas∣tle and to Overburrough southwestward  and if so probably  Stratford  near that place was where it crossed the river  Tees  both on account of its name and being in a direct line to  Old Town  in  Alondale  where I have chose to place  Alone  As a further proof of  Old Town  's being  Alone  it may not be improper to acquaint you that  Mr Camden  is wrong in placing  Whitley Castle  upon  the river  Alo    for it is six miles distant from any part of it There is indeed about a mile from it a small stream called  Yal  which empties itself into  Tynt  but I think this argues but little for it neither can I believe that the inscription left by the  Cobors  III  Nerviorum  is a certain proof of its being  Alone  for I have often observed altars set up by one and the same Cohors in places several miles distant as for instance at the  Housesteads  where I place  Bor    at  Willeford  and other places along the  Picts Wall  I find altars erected by the  Cohors  I  Tungrerum  and as  Old Town  on the river  Alon  in  Alondule  is but eight miles distant from  Whitley Castle  I do not see but they may have both been the habitation of the  Cohors  III  Nerticrum  The military way that comes from  E  singwold  to  Thor  aldby  shews itself very plainly in the village of  Romandby  from which place it goes to  Yafford Langton Bolton  upon Swale  Brunton  and by the north side of the  friery wall in Richmond  to the top of  Richmond Moor  where I loose it but believe it shoots north west and meets with that which goes north from  Ethelburgh  some where about  Barnard Castle  This Roman read comes from  Br  upon  Ham  er  perhaps the  Praetorium of Antoninus  to  Delgo  itio  Wigton  De  cu  A  dby and so to  Easi  wa  Thi  Rom  Bolton  upon Swale the north end of  Catterick Bridge  and so to  Richmond  c  R G  The observation you make upon such places as bear the name of  Thornton  The observation above mentioned  such tow  have the word  Thorn  in their names as  Thornton Townb  gh  are not so called from the word  Thorn  but from the Saxon Ðorn  Terris Castellum  and are generally seated near some old Roman Station as  Thorn  ugh  near  Catterick Bridge  and another near  Roman  Th  y  near  Oldbury  in Gloucestershire the  Projectors of Antoninus ThorntonRust  not far from  Ethelburgh  c  R G  is very good and daily proves serviceable to me I have traced the Roman way that comes from  Ethelburgh  into  Leeminglane  and find that it passes through  Thornton Asgarth Bolton Park Middleham  to  Ulshawbridge  where it crosses the  Ure  and continues its course by  Danby ThorntonSteward Watlass Church  and over  Wa  Moor  where there are several  Tumuli  of different sizes to the west side of  Causick Part  thence it goes by  Thornbrough  to  MiddletonQuernhow  and enters  Leeming  Lane about half a mile southeast of the last place  Bedal    st November  J WARBURTON  Extract of a Letter from  Roger Gale  Esq

Albinus  or as others will have his name  Alcuinus  composed a poem  De  et Sanctis Ecclesiae Eboracensis  all which is taken from  Bede's  History but h  w  his name came to be prefixed to your  Bede  if it is  Bede  I cannot imagine You must not think it strange if my  Essay  upon the Roman ways is not compleat I only call it an  Essay  some parts of those roads I have occasionally observed in my travels others and as I must acknowledge by far the greatest part I have only travelled in maps or picked out of au∣thors as I was upon other subjects so that it is no wonder if I cannot help omitting large  tracts of them in some places and leaving them short in others as I have done in the mid∣dle branch of that on  Gatherley Moor  which I believe you we now satisfied is the  Er  in∣street  as that I was  Ehchester  is  Vindemora  upon my first fight of your excellent Map of  Nor∣thumberland  which likewise obliged me to change my opinion as to the situation of  Glano∣venta  which my addition of  Antoninus  had placed upon the river  Bowent  in  Glendale  for though the distances between  Glanoventa  and  Gallava Thornton  and  Portgate  do not exactly agree with the numbers in that  Itinerary  yet they are not so wide as the number of miles between  Anterchester  upon  Bowent  and  Portgate  which is thirtyfour but if we six  Gla  o  a  at  Thornton Gallava  at  Walwick  as I have done in  Antoninus  and  Alone  at  Old Town  all these distances will agree pretty well with the  Itinerary  Another argument for  Glanove  a's  being placed at  Thornton  may be deduced from the name itself you very well know that  Wentsheck  the name of the little river upon or near which  Thornton  is situated is the same thing as  Wentsluviolus Glen  or  Glan  in  British  is  Ripa  so that  Gl  went Gl  ta  is  Ripa Wentae  a town upon the  bank of Went  The  Notiti  Imperii  also places  Gla  be  am ad Li∣neam Valli  which though not strictly true is much nearer the truth at  Thornton  than at  Anterchester  As I remember in my last letter to you I did not found my conjecture of  Alona  being at  Whitley Castle  so much upon the inscription found there as upon the due distance it would then obtain in respect to  Brementonacis  and only made the inscription a concurrent argument Now as the distance between  Walwick  and  Old Town  holds as good as that other between  Whitley Castle  and  Overburrough Bre  to  is  so the argument is equally strong for  Alone  being at  Old Town  and I really give up my former opinion to you as the rightest I should have mentioned  Galacum Whell  p Castle  as lying between  Alone  and  Bre∣met  nacis  or  Brementonacis  as some copies have it the distance allotted it by  Antoninus  is nineteen miles from  Alone  which also agrees better with  Old Town  than  Whitley Castle  but the distance between  Whellop Castle  in that  Itinerary  and  Brementoncis  agrees well with neither  Overburrough  nor  Ethelburrough  the former being thirtytwo and the latter but twentyfour miles instead of twentyseven however I was and am still inclined to fix it at the former it lying more directly in the road to  Coccium  Ribblechester the distance agree∣ing better being about twentytwo whereas it is thirtysix miles betwixt  Rehelburgh  and  Ribblechester  and as for the thirtytwo between it and  Gallacum  the mistake may have easily been committed by a transcriber's making an X for a V if you turn the third X in to V the numbers will be and correspond to those of  Antoninus  however I shall suspend giving up myself entirely to my opinion till I hear whether you find reason to alter yours about this Roman road's joining with the  Maiden Way  at  Whitley Castle  or that it came by the head of  Teys  to  Ethelburgh  and from thence to  Coceium  the latter part I believe you will hardly prove to do so because I am pretty certain you will trace it from  Ethelburgh  over  Nostrefield Moor  into  Leeminglane  except two ways lead from it and then perhaps one of them might lead to  Coccium  this way you say goes directly by its pointing upon  Barnard Castle  to  Old Town  now if we could discover any Station that might prove to be  Gallacum  upon it between  Old Town  and  Ethelburgh  at a due distance from them both according to the  Itinerary  it would put the matter out of dispute but I cannot think of any such and if it passed the  Teys  at  Statford  as there seems to be no great doubt it did it points a little too much eastward for  Alone  Old Town and rather inclines to fall into the great Roman road at or near to  Vinonium  Binchester I have been very long upon this subject therefore shall only add that the miles I reckon by are shorter than those you make your computation from for as  Antoninus  is my chief guide I make an allowance for the difference between the  Roman  and  English mi  e  which is as to I do not know whether I mentioned the Roman road from  Romanby  c running by  Bolton  on the north side of  Swale  to you but I find you have observed it If you have leisure at any time when you are at  Northallerton  to view the  Castle Hills  there between that  town  and  Romanby  you will find great works and trenches out of the limits and beyond the ditch of the  modern Castle  westward and southward which I dare say were Roman and gave name to the neighbouring village though what was the an∣cient appellation of it is now entirely lost As for the name of  Allerton  it is very hard to tell whence it came the  Saxon Kings  generally built on or near the ruins of ancient and decayed  Roman towns  and as we have no memorials that contradict my conjecture I am apt to think this town might be built here by  King Alfred  who restored many places that had been de∣stroyed by the  Danes  or else by  Guthrum the Dane  to whom upon his being baptized he gave all the kingdom on the north side of  Watlingstreet  who might call it  Alvertun  or  Al∣sreton  for that is the ancientest name it occurs by in honour of his godfather and benefactor this I think is more probable than that it should be so called from  aller trees  as some have fa  cied since the ancient writing of the name makes for it  I am much obliged to you for your kind offer of your  Coins  but I am unwilling to rob you of them having most of them already as for the  Altar  found at  Elsdon  I should be very thankful for that and desire you when opportunity serves to get it conveyed to  Scru∣ton  where I hope to see it next summer but the carriage must be at my charge The cir∣cumstances of your finding the altar at  Chester in the Wood  are very odd I cannot suppose that vault to have been the place where the altar was primarily erected and used since they only sacrificed under ground to the  infernal Gods  and  Fortune  was not one of them it seems most probably to have been concealed there by the  Romans  or  Roman Britons  when they were drove from those Stations by the  P  cts  to prevent its profanation by those barbarous enemies and that other which accompanied it may have been accidentally broken in the burying but then as to the smoaky smell it will be a little difficult to form any conjecture I was once at  C  rencester  in  Clocestershire  shewn the top of much such a vault as you de∣scribe in a garden there but the ground all over and about it being sown I could not per∣suade the Gardener to give me admittance into it but he assured me it was filled near three feet deep with burnt bones and ashes this made me conclude some altar might have stood near it and that this vault was the receptacle of what was swept from the altar and why may not the vault at  Chester in the Wood  have been for the same purpose and thence con∣tracted its smell I think you were much in the right not to part with it and the rest to the Lord you mention upon general promises I dare say all the gratification you would have had from him would have been the honour done you of erecting marble pedestals to set them on  I am Sir your c R GALE  ALLENDALE TOWN  is situate on an eminence on East Allen is chiefly inhabited by Miners In the neighbourhood is a Free School founded in and endowed  several liberal benefactions  See Ritschel's account thereof  We passed from thence to Allenheads a part of the county barren and mountainous inhabited only by Miners  and Shepherds the scene on every hand is dark and deplorable the Mines only inducing inhabitants to this desolate spot Near Allenheads  is a place called Shorngate where the Scots made their re∣treat from Stanhope Park in the reign of King Edward III A D  They passed a morass as some authors say by cutting through the mossy earth to the rock or by laying a road with stones  This retreat is said to be conducted by the address of Lord Douglas who in a dark night led the Scotch army over a morass two miles broad formerly deemed impassable by the help of  flakes  made of branches cut from the wood in the neighbourhood of their last encampment and which casting before them into the broken parts of the bog as they advanced through it they led their horses over those parts  Ridpath's Border Hist  This is the most probable accounthe quotes Barber and Carte for this account  Flake  is a Scotch word implying a hurdle twigs of hazels woven together of which great use is made in Scotland and the Borders they serving as doors to hovels where their cows and other cattle stand and for gates to stackgarths c  an asto∣nishing act in the perils of a retreat  By a disagreeable road in a desolate country we travelled to  BLANCHLAND  seated in a narrow deep vale on the river Derwent a few strips of meadow ground lay along the margin of the stream and some cultivated lands skirt the feet of the hills whose summits are covered with heath This is a very different situation from others I have seen chosen by the Religious for the foundation of their houses the country around is  barren and mountainous the narrow vale in which the abbey is placed seems in nowife suited to the maintenance of its former inhabitants poverty for ages past has reigned over the face of the adjacent country The scites of religious houses are generally in wellsheltered and warm situations where the retirements are surrounded with rich lands This place looks truly like the realm of mortification  This abbey was founded by Walter de Bolbeck in dedicated to the blessed Virgin for twelve Premonstratensian Canons having li∣berty to exceed that number with the consent of the Bishop of Durham Part of his donation was twelve fishes for their table out of his fishery of Stiford in lieu of tithes of fish The Abbot was summoned to par∣liament King Edward I At the suppression here were fourteen Canons the annual revenue of the house according to Dugdale being l s d and l s d according to Speed After passing from the Crown by sale it became the possession of the Fosters and was for∣feited in by Thomas Forster  Esq  after which it was purchased by Lord Crew and by him left to charitable uses  The west end and tower of the church and the south aile of the cross remain the latter neatly fitted up for parochial duty The gate∣way entering into the square where formerly the houses of the Canons stood still remains the towers on each hand converted into alehouses the buildings which are standing are now inhabited by poor people who are perhaps employed in the leadworks the distress and ragged appearance of the whole conventual buildings being most deplorable no one relique of church pomp remaining To compensate for the dis∣agreeable review of cells of poverty we walked in the levels adjoining the church when it happened to be the time of divine service the psalm of the congregation at our distance had a degree of solemn har∣mony which inspired serious though pleasing reflections sentiments and ideas succeeded which dignify the mind of man and give him competition with angels  Near Blanchland lays the Barony of  BOLBECK  the ancient baronial inheritance of John de Bolbeck in the reign of King Henry III  John de BolbeckTemp King Henry III  Hugh de

Barons of MonFitchet  Camden's Brit  It is now the estate of George Baker  Esq  of Elle∣more in the county of Durham  We passed from Blanchland by a woody declivity to Acton Mill a smelting mill for lead where in vast heaps of ore the wealth of the late Sir Walter Caverley Blackett was displayed the road from thence to Prudhoe was harrowed up by lead carriages and in innumerable places the name of Blackett struck our eye on the lead which lay on the road We passed by  MINSTER ACRES  where the advances of cultivation gives a most pleasing countenance to the decreasing desert  The country in general is heathy and naked near these new and beautiful inclosures where planting succeeds admirablyat length we gained a distant view of Tynedale coloured with the happy teints of corn and meadow we hastened from the dreary country which had detained us too long from scenes of pleasure  When we had gained the summit of the hill above Hedley we had a good prospect of Tyne towards the northwest the river by its wind∣ing course formed seven distinct canals one of them near a mile in length the foreground of this landskip is enriched with the village of Bywell surmounted by Mr Fenwick's elegant mansion and deco∣rated with plantations and garden grounds so disposed to the eye as to retain all the ease and inartificiality of nature the water brightened by a western sun appeared through the trees as if the mansion and pleasure grounds were insulated the rising ground to the right is crowned with a gloomy ruin once the fortress of the vale held by the Baliols and after them by the Earls of Westmoreland now con∣trasting beautifully with the modern and excellent taste of Mr Paine of whose mode of architecture the mansionhouse of Bywell is con∣structed to the left extensive woods filled the landskip  Behind the town of Bywell grounds in high cultivation interspersed with wood ascend gradually from the river in one part terminated by heathy eminences and in another by distant lands stretching away through an extended valley towards Hexham where the distinction of objects was lost to the eye in the blue vapours which covered the extremity of the vale  We descended through a woody passage to  PRUDHOE  which though situate on a very lofty eminence near the banks of Tyne is much inferior to the hills by which we advanced towards it  The Castle of Prudhoe stands on the summit of a vast rocky promon∣tary which communicates with the adjoining grounds by a narrow neck and pass towards the south the ground on which the fortress stands forming seven parts of a circle on an octagonal section It is guarded by an outward wall towards the Tyne built on the brink of the cliffs in this part not less than sixty perpendicular feet in height above the plain which intervenes between the castle and the river this wall at inter∣vals is defended by square bastions The entrance to the castle is from the south on our approach the whole structure was viewed from the heights and made a very noble and formidable appearance The nar∣row neck of land leading to the entrance was formerly cut through by  a deep ditch over which a draw bridge has given access to the out∣ward gate the water which anciently supplied the ditch is now col∣lected by a reservoir before the gate and serves a mill the outward gate was originally defended by several outworks and a tower as ap∣pears by their ruins From the situation in which I drew my view of this place I could overlook the top of the first gate and the eye pene∣trated the inner gateway the superstructure of which is a lofty em∣battled square tower about sixty feet high now so mantled with ivy that the windows loopholes and apertures are almost wholly con∣cealed I will describe the whole from the station I occupied on that occasion To the right the outward wall extended to some distance terminated by a turret or exploratory mount the wall of which is em∣battled and there the landskip was closed by a fine grove of stately trees The outward wall to the left from the inner gateway extends to a considerable distance without any turret or bastion over which several interior buildings and among them the remains of the chapel were discovered in all the confusion of ruin mingled chimneys win∣dows buttresses columns and walls in that wildness of irregularity which constitutes much picturesque beauty in scenes of this kind above all which objects a square tower the Keep of the Fortress on the side towards me almost perfect twentyfive yards in height and eighteen in breadth but without ornament or windows with an exploratory tower on the southwest corner overlooked the castle with that gloomy and sullen majesty which characterizes the age in which it had its rise The wall still extending to the left on its angle is defended by a square bastion with broken loopholes from whence it turns northward and is terminated by a broken circular tower situate on the brink of the cliff whose inner recess the eye sufficiently penetrated to mark the dis∣traction of its interior works The fine levels between the castle and the river opened to the left the Tyne in view with the town of Oving∣ham hanging on the opposite shore  In Mr Grose's Addenda we have the following survey of Prudhoe Castle taken the th of August  There is an old ruinous castle walled about and in form not much unlike to a shield hanging with one point upward scituate upon a high moate of earth with ditches in some places all wrought with mans hands as it seemeth and is of content all the scite of with a little garden plat and the bankes by estimacon sc acr  The said castle hath the entrey on the south where it hath had two gates the uttermost now in decay and without the same is a little turnepyke and on the west parte a large gate roome where there hath been a passage into the lodgings there scituate without the castle as is supposed or to the chappell there standing and between the gates is a strong wall there on both sydes and as it appeareth hath been a draw bridge and without the same before it come to the utter gate a turnepyke for defence of the bridge The gate is a tower all massy worke on both sides to the top of the vault Above the vault is the chep∣pel and above the cheppel a chamber which is called the wardrobe it is covered with lead but in great ruin both in lead and timber it is in length ten yeards and in breadth six yeards or thereabouts  There is opposite to the said gatehouse tower joining to the north wall of the said castle one hall of eighteen yeards in length and nine yeards in breadth or thereabouts within the walls covered also with lead albeit the timber and lead in some decay  Between the said gatehouse tower and hall on the left hand at your entrey in at the gate is a house of ij  o  ▪ house height of length xxiiij yeards in breadth yeards or thereabouts divided into two chambers covered with slate the lower house hath a great room to pass out of the court thro that house to the great tower and the south end a chamber called the parlour and in the north end a little buttery In the house is two chambers called the utter chamber and inner chamber out of the utter chamber is a passage to the great tower by a little gallery on the other side a passage down to the buttery Out of the inner cham∣ber is a passage to the chappel and on the other side a passage to a house called the nursery  On the west parte of the said house is another little house standing east and west upon the south wall called the nursery in length ten yeards and in breadth six yeards or there∣abouts of two house height covered also with slate  At the southwest corner is a house standing north and south called the garner adjoining to the west wall in length ten yeards in breadth yeards or thereabouts of ij  o  house height the under house a stable the upper house a garner covered also with slate  At the northwest corner of the said castle is a little tower called the west tower of three house height round on the outside in length seven yeards or thereabouts covered with lead but in decay both in lead and timber  Joyned to the said tower is another house of two house height in length nine yeards in breadth six yeards or thereabouts covered with slate but much in decay  In the middle of these houses by itself standeth the great tower one way yeards ano∣ther way xij yeards north and south of storyes onely and of height xv yeards or there∣abouts besides the battlements It hath no vault of stone in it it is covered with lead but in some decay of lead and timber but necessary to be repaired and a toofall or a little house adjoining thereunto in utter decay  At the east end of the hall is a house called the kitchen of one house height in length xij yeards in breadth six yeards or thereabouts covered with slate  In the east end as it were at the lower point of the shield is a little square tower in length vij yeards in breadth  yeards or thereabouts covered with lead but in utter ruine and decay both in timber and lead  Adjoining to the same is a house called the brewhouse in length viij yeards and in breadth vij yeards covered with slate  There is within the scyte and without the walls an elder chappell which hath been very fair and covered with slate In the tyme that diverse dwellers were on the demesnes one dwelled in the said chappell and made it his dwelling house and byers for his cattle and by that means defaced saving the timber walls and greate parte of slate remayneth  There was an orchard set with all fruit trees now all spoyled and an old house wherein the keeper of the orchard did dwell  We advanced by a narrow path on the side of the reservoir to the first gateway which is formed by a circular arch by the fragments and broken walls it evidently appears this gate was originally flanked with various outworks and had a tower This gate gives admittance to a covered way leading to the inner gate about paces in length a sallyport opening on each side to flank the walls and defend the  ditch There is no appearance of a portcullice in either gateway The second gateway is also formed by a circular arch above which is a high tower the windows shewing that it contained three tiers of apart∣ments A lattice or open gate still remains jointed with studs of iron The roof of the gateway is arched in semicircles with an aperture in the centre from whence those in the upper chamber might annoy an enemy who had forced the gate From thence you enter an area now so blocked up by the buildings of a farmyard and tenement that it is not possible to form any idea of its original magnitude though it ap∣pears by the other parts that an open area had surrounded the great tower which doth not shew any remains of communication with the outworks but seems to have stood apart on an eminence in the centre The outward wall was defended on the angle to the south west by a large square bastion with loopholes to the northwest by a circular tower containing several tiers of low chambers singular in their form and height and such as I never observed before in any ancient castle the inhabitants could not stand erect in them at the time of defence To∣wards the river and northward the wall is guarded by several small square bastions and towards the southeast a small mount placed within the walls overlooks the ditch which guards the southern side and ter∣minates at the brink of the cliffs The large tower is in ruins only the the southern wall now standing and not one bastion remains entire they being all in ruins towards the area A passage runs in the centre of the wall from bastion to bastion Steps ascend from the area to the top of the wall in several places which is broad enough to allow the armed men of the garrison to pass each other covered by a parapet  Camden conjectures this was the Prodolita of the Romans and the Station of the first band of Batavians It was the possession of the Umfrevills This family came into England with the Conqueror who bestowed on  Robert  with the Beard the Lordship of Redesdale to be held for ever by the service of defending the country against thieves and wolves with the same sword with which William entered Northum∣berland and also the Barony of Prudhoe by the service of two Knights fees and a half  Dugdale's Baronage  This castle was famous in the reign of King Henry II for the opposition it gave to William King of Scotland in his incursion and the gallant defence it then made he being obliged to raise the siege It was the possession of Robert or as some authors say of  Rogerus de Umfrevile  Rogerus de Umf  evile King Henry I  He had the Forest of Reedsdale and the Castles of Otter∣burn and Harbottle c  Odonel King Henry II  Richard King Henry III  Gilbert King

anto∣cessores sui à tempore Henrici I  Regis Angliae  Lel Collect V p  in the reign of King Henry I as appears by the escheats of that reign  Sir William Dugdale in his Barony says  According to the Monk of Tynmouth in the th of Henry II Odonel greatly oppressed and plundered his neighbours in order to repair the roof of his castle of Prudhow presuming on his own eminence and the interest he was possessed of by having married his daughter to one high in the King's favour  In the th of King John Richard de Umfrevill delivered up his four sons and his castle of Brudhow as pledges for his fidelity notwithstanding which he put himself in arms among the B  ro  s in the th of the same reign The consequence of which was that the castle and lands were given to Hugh de Baliol But in the reign of Henry III he obtained a restitution but never had the confidence of that King who was offended at and distrusted him on account of his fortifying his castle of Harbottle He gave one toft and eight acres of land in the town of Prudhow to the Monks of Hexham His son Gilbert succeeded to this Barony and dying the th of Henry III was succeeded by  Gilbert the second who was stiled the famous Baron the Flower and Keeper of the northern parts of England  Gilbert the third was by King Edward I made Earl of Angus in Scotland and under that title summoned to parliament AD The Lawers at first refused to acknowledge him as an Earl because Angus was not of this kingdom but submitted on sight of the King's writ wherein he was summoned by that title  Gilbert the fourth in the th of Edward III exhibited a petition to the King and his Council assembled in parliament setting forth that he and his ancestors time out of mind used to have custody of all prisoners taken within the liberty of Reedsdale to be kept in his prison of Harbottle Castle which being so ruined by the Scots wars that it was insufficient to retain them he desired he might have leave to keep all such prisoners in his Castle of Prudhow till his Castle of Harbottle could be properly repaired The King being satisfied that the fact al∣ledged in his petition was true and considering that the ruinous state of Harbottle Castle did not arise from neglect granted him leave to keep such prisoners in his castle of Prudhoe for ten years  This Earl Gilbert died without issue in having had by his wife Maude daughter and heir of Thomas Lord Lucy a son named Robert who although he died before his father had been married to Margaret daughter of Henry the second Lord Percy of Alnwick but with∣out issue It seems to have been in consequence of the settlement made on this marriage that the Castle and Barony of Prudhow descended to the Percies for it appears among the pleas in the King's Bench King Henry VI and Rol on a traverse then tendered by Henry Earl of Northumberland  that John Hawborough and John Pykeworth A  o  King Edward III gave to Gilbert Hamfervile and to Mawde his wife and to their heirs lawfully begotten the said Castle and Barony and the Manor of Ovingham and for lack of such issue the said Castle Manor and Barony to remain to Henry Lord Percy and to his heirs for ever  In consequence of this disposition after the death of Earl Gilbert his widow the Countess Maude enjoyed it for her life She married to her second husband Henry Percy first Earl of Northumberland who after her death entered into full possession of the Castle and Barony with its appendages and the same continued in his posterity without any other interruption except what was occasioned by the attenders in different periods Thus on the forfeiture of the said first Earl of Northumberland and his son Hotspur in the reign of King Henry IV the Castle and Lordship of Prudhow were bestowed by the said King King Henry IV on his son John afterwards Duke of Bedford and Regent of France who appears to have held them till his death except for a short time viz Henry VI when Ralph Earl of Westmoreland was pos∣sessed of the Mano  of Prudhow So again King Henry VI the Castle of Prudhow was in possession of Sir John Bertram Knt but afterwards the whole reverted to the Percies till they underwent another attainder for their adherence to the House of Lancaster in the th of King Edward IV The Castle of Prudhow was given to Sir William Bertram Knt in the th year of that King's reign After the restoration of Henry the fourth Earl of Northumberland this Castle and Barony were again given back to the Percies and though their possession of it suf∣fered again some short interruptions from future attaintures in the reigns of King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth yet the Castle and Barony of Prudhow have constantly descended with their other great possessions through the succeeding Earls of Northumberland down to their illustrious representatives the present Duke and his late Duchess  Grose's Antiq  He was succeeded by Odonel de Umfrevile who with Barnard de Haliol and others took

from whence we had a fine view of the Castle of Prudhoe the river beneath us washed the margin of a level of corn land above which arose the precipitous cliffs on which the castle is erected in the form of a halfmoon crowned with the remains of the fortress of an aspect awfully majestic over these the rising grounds behind cloathed with woods and the thick groves on each flank seemed to cast a solemn mantle The scene struck me with the image of mourning royalty weeping in ashes for the dissolution of Empire and lamenting the cruel vicissitudes of For∣tune in which all its honours are extinguished and nothing but me∣morials of calamity left behind  OVINGHAM  had heretofore a religious house of Black Canons subordinate to Hex∣ham founded and endowed by one of the Umfreviles Barons

Horsley of the Romans where the Cohors Prima Frixagorum kept garrison Camden calls it Vindolana and by some authors it is said to be the frontier station of the fourth Cohort of the Gauls Severus's wall runs upon the middle of the east rampart but is not continued through the station Hadrian's Vallum passes about the distance of a chain to the south of it This fort has been very considerable and the ruins of it at present are remarkable on the north side there have been six turrets one at each corner one on each side the gate and one between each corner and those adjoining to the gate On the east and west sides there is also a tower between the gate and the angle in that part of the fort that is on the north of the wall but it is doubtful whether there has been the same number of towers in that part that lays within the wall The ramparts are still very visible If there has been a town without which there can scarce be any doubt of it has been as usual on the south where the village of Rutchester now stands and covers its ruins  To the northwest of Rutchester is a place called Whitchester some∣times Outchester in Camden it is called Old Winchester or Vindolana  and there are said to be some remains of a fort here but all this seems to be a mistake There is somewhat like the remains of an earthen rampart which added to the name may make it probable that here were the Castra Aestiva of the garrison of Rutchester and perhaps it was called the Outer Chesters  Between Whitchester and Harlow Hill is a round hill with a trench about it which seems to have been exploratory and by the situation one would judge it had been as ancient as the time of the Romans  It is curious to observe the passage of Hadrian's ditch near Harlow Hill where it passes through a limestone quarry though nothing is to be discerned on the surface yet below it the exact dimensions of the ditch may be taken because that part of the quarry through which the ditch has been carried on is now filled up with earth only so that the shape and measure here are very plain It is made sloping the depth between eight and nine feet and about eleven feet broad At this place a Castellum has stood the foundations yet appear It has had a high situation and commanded an extensive prospect  At the usual distance from Harlow Hill a Castellum is visible and about a furlong west from this the walls approach very near to each other being not above a chain distance Again at the usual distance another Castellum appears but somewhat obscure and of an uncommon shape two of the sides those which lay east and west being about double the usual length and the south side of it reaches very near the north Agger of Hadrian's work Mr Horsley was of opinion this was one of Hadrian's exploratory Castella but the north side of it falling in exactly with the line of Severus's wall it has been used also as a Cas∣tellum by him Severus's wall in part of this tract has four courses of the original stone appearing  From Rutchester to Halton Chesters is little more than seven mea∣sured miles there are nine Castella between these two stations and all of them visible the interval between every two of them being near upon six furlongs and an half and it is remarkable that as the interval be∣tween these two stations is the greatest of any upon the whole line of the wall so the intervals between the Castella are the least of any ex∣cept in one single instance  Many Roman Antiquities have been gained here besides those men∣tioned by Mr Horsley viz an Effigy of Hercules some years ago was removed from hence by Mr Duane two Fibulae of silver Roman Bricks marked LVIV and Coins of the low Empire were lately discovered but the most valuable acquisition gained from hence was an Urn found in containing gold and silver Coins in the possession of the late William Archdeacon  Esq  in which it is said is a compleat series of those of the higher Empire In the same year was discovered a Coffin cut in the rock twelve feet in length containing many bones teeth and vertebree or joints supposed to belong to animals sacrificed to Her∣cules whose festival was observed on the third day of June  Mr Horsley's Work contains the following Inscriptions found here  XIII Centuria Voconii Cohortis Posuit  This is a centurial inscription in the usual form the Centurion's name Voconius is visible but the number of the Cohort is effaced  XIV Cohors Nona Posuit  This contains the number of the Cohort which might probably be one of those that car∣ried on the work of the wall from Walbottle hither It is remarkable that though we have all the intermediate numbers from one to ten yet ten is never exceeded on such stones this confirms them to be the numbers of the Legionary Cohorts  XVII Centuria Turriai Prisci  This was found near this place it appeared at first fight to be plainly centurial and of the usual form but the implication of the letters is very odd part of the letters of both the names being thrown together in the same cypher in which no fewer than four or five letters are united The name Priscus is in another centurial inscription at Cousins House and two in Cumberland  Near this station stands Rutchester Tower the possession of the family de Rutchesters in the reign of King Edward I The county of Nor∣thumberland as was before observed contains the remains of a multi∣tude of such towers apparently calculated for a family defence against the Moss Troopers and Scotch Ravagers  CHEESBURN GRANGE  lays to the north The manor belonged to the priory of Hexham after∣wards to the Widdringtons and now is the possession of Ralph Riddle  Esq  But I must return to the banks of Tyne to speak more fully of  BYWELL  The reader hitherto has only had my distant view from Hedley Hill  I cannot forbear taking notice of a public grievance which is so very notorious in the county of Northumberland that every traveller expe∣riences it When I entered this county I was prejudiced in its favour and had not the least apprehension that any matter necessary for the public weal could be neglected The resolutions of the Magistrates given to the public will transmit their virtues to posterity Merchandize has occasioned within the last century such an influx of wealth to this county that it proves Trade is advanced by good roads for carriages and an easy communication with the portshow then in the midst of such professed virtues and such public conviction can it arise that the plain directions of the law touching the highways are totally ne∣glected or overlooked There is scarce one Guidepost to mitigate the grievances of travelling erected through the whole county except in the neighbourhood of Wallington and some of those are obliterated On the public road from Newcastle to Hexham and on the wilds of Wooler the traveller is equally embarrassed  As you look upon Bywell from the most pleasing point of view the landskip lays in the following orderFrom the road near the brink of the river the ruined piers of a bridge become the front ob∣jects behind which in a regular cascade the whole river falls over a wear extended from Bank to Bank in height about eight perpendi∣cular feet a mill on the right hand a salmon lock on the left the town and two churches stretch along the banks of the upper bason of the river with a fine curvature the solemn ruins of the ancient castle of the Baliols lift their towers above the trees on the right and make an agreeable contrast with the adjoining mansionhouse the whole back ground of the landskip appears covered with wood  There is a tradition that two sisters quarrelling about precedency one of them founded a church of her own from whence she excluded her sister which was the occasion of two churches in this small town Both are served at present by one Clergyman who does duty in the morning at one and in the evening at the other  Bywell was the Barony of the Baliol family for many generations Guy de Baliol being invested therewith by William Rufus  Dugdale's Baron  Hugh de  Baliol possessed it in the reign of King Henry III  Dugdale's Baron  Camden says he held it by the service of thirty Knights fees  Hugh de Balliolo tenet Baroniam de Biwelle cum pertinentiis per servitium quinque mili∣tum et tamen debet ad wardam Novi Castelli super tinam milites ut antecessores sui tenue∣runt a tempore Gul Rufi Regis qui eum feofavit de feodo illo  Lel Collect V p  to the ward of Newcastle And after him it passed to John de Baliol King Edward I  Hugh de Baliol Sheriff of Northumberland for successive years  John de Baliol one of the Lords chosen by the Barons to treat in the three parlia∣ments of Henry III to save the charges of attendance  Wallis  It be∣came the possession of the Nevils Lords of Raby  A survey was taken of the forfeited estates by her Majesty's Commissioner Sir William Humberston in the th year of her reign  Bywell and Bolbeck are two ancient Baronies and are situate on the extream south part of Northumberland To the Barony of Bywell belongeth a forest of red deer Within the barony are many gentlemen and freeholders who hold their lands of the said barony by ser∣vices and are always attendants upon the Lords in time of service when they shall be thereto commanded  In the wastes are divers woods and very fair coursing with greyhounds  The town of Bywell is builded in length all of one street upon the river or water of Tyne is divided into two several parishes and inhabited by handicraftmen whose trade is in ironwork for the horsemen and borderers of that country They are subject to the incursions of the thieves of Tynedale and compelled winter and summer to bring all their cattle and sheep into the street in the night season and watch both ends of the street and when the enemy approacheth to raise hue and cry  To the barony there belongeth a fishery of salmon in the river Tyne three miles in length with a dam or bay over the river for preserving the fish  In Bywell town the ancestors of the Earl of Westmoreland built a fair tower or gatehouse all of stone and covered with lead meaning to have proceeded further as appears by the walls the height of a man left unfinished  The Barony of Bywell comprehendeth Bywell St Peter Bywell St Andrew Acomb New∣ton Ovington Mickley Bromley Newlands Ridley Nova Styford Sheryden and Easinghope inhabited by men of good service and have very good farms and able to keep much cattle and get plenty of corn and hay were it not for the continual robberies and incursions of the thieves of Tynedale which so continually assault them in the night as they can keep no more cattle than they are able to lodge either in house or like safety in the night  The Lord of the said Baronies hath the leet within all the limits of the same and all waives estrays fellons goods and amerciaments and all other royalties casualties and profits arising or growing by reason of the leet  and by the attainder of Charles Earl of Westmoreland was forfeited to the Crown in the year with his other large possessions  In the Life of Lord Keeper Guildford we have an account of a cus∣tom held here As this country was perilous to travellers the tenants of each manor were bound to guard the Judge through their respective precincts Lord Chief Justice North describes his attendants with long  beards short cloaks long baskethilted broad swords hanging from broad belts and mounted on little horses so that their legs and swords touched the ground at every turning The Sheriff presented his train with arms viz a dagger knife penknife and fork  By the two piers yet remaining in the river it appears there was an ancient bridge over Tyne here but as it is remarked by workmen that the piers have not had a spring of arches it is evident the superstructure was of wood The ruins of the chapel appertaining to Bywell Castle are situate on the southern banks of the river  I cannot quit this delightful scene without making a comparison be∣tween the aera of and the present agethe record I have given in my note affords a deplorable evidence of the circumstances attending the inhabitants of Tyne when they were obliged to guard their cattle every night and to cultivate no more lands than in proportion to the places of defence they had to secure their crops living in a state of perpetual warfare and jeopardy And even these calamities which arose from a vicinity of thieves and robbers were trifling when com∣pared to the devastation and ruin which marked the incursions of the Scots These were only the incidental grievances of the times but there was one which was continuedthe vassalage and misery of a feodal tenure by which genius was kept in fetters and industry was distinguished only by the name of slavery What then was the estate of this opulent and beautiful county of Northumberland when com∣pared to the present time What blessings have flowed in upon this land from the union of the kingdoms and the excellent police of the age The ferocity of the inhabitants is subdued traffic arts sciences manufactories and navigation have taken place of the brutal warfare which is extinguished Cultivation with all the comeliness of Plenty laughs in the valleys the streams are taught to labour in mechanic systems to aid the manufacturer every Creek and Bay is thronged with Ships the gloomy Tower that frowned defiance from each Emi∣nence sinks in the dust whilst a Palace receives the descendants of her Lord with all the bounties of Opulence and Peace Desert plains stained with Slaughter and track'd with the progress of Rapine and Violence formerly spread forth an extensive scene of desolation where now rising woods inclosed farms villages and hamlets are disposed under the smiles of Prosperity The original naked inhabitants savage from hunger and necessity lurking in dens and in the mountains  prowling as wolves subsisting in perpetual jeopardy on robbery and rapine has furnished the land with a race who at the time they enjoy the comforts of life reap the fruits of industry and the profits of genius and thereby are progressively advancing their families towards opulence Happy reverseBut to return from this digression  In the year an angler found in the river near Bywell a small silver cup of Roman work with a motto engraven on the bottom Desideri vivas  The custom of wishing health or prosperity at the time of drinking is very ancientit is not possible to trace it to its source we have testimonies of it among the customs of most of the ancient nations it was used as a religious ceremony with many the wine was offered in the sacred vessel and the Deity invoked after which a little was spilt on the altar and the public prayer being made the petitioner put his lips to the cup  It would afford great astonishment to a foreigner in whose country no such custom has gained acceptation to be brought into a company of Englishmen where jollity and convivial mirth had begun to take place we will presume the visitant by his interpreter is introduced to a know∣ledge of the characters before him in order that we may heighten the lines of his surprizehow would he be amazed to hear a man who in common life and conversation expresses no religion morality prin∣ciples or public virtue praying with all the vehemence of an Enthu∣siast on his knees before he drinks to the prosperity of the object of his wishes who is perhaps no other than some factious wretch and rebellious disturber of the commonweal whilst the circle of communi∣cants standing around like Canibals at some horrid festival or Daemons at an infernal convocation in every distortion of body and countenance which can express an agitated soul and an inflamed mind halloo with all the ardour of unlimited licentiousness in the hideous yells of Hot∣tentotsWhen such a visiter returned to his native land should re∣late the scene and tell his astonished countrymen that with the polished Britons this was jollity and public spirit could he be believedWould he not like Mandeville on his visit to the vale of Devils to save his credit be obliged to add "Men sayen for I hav' not seyen" As to my part I think a vehement Partizan in the ardent act of drinking a constitutional Toast as he would term it is as odious and ridiculous an Animal as Nature can exhibit  Returning to the wall  STAMFORDHAM  claims my attention consisting of one street only it has three annual fairs on the th of April Holy Thursday and Thursday succeeding the th of August Here is a free school founded by Sir Thomas Widdrington in the year well endowed The vicarage house is pleasantly situated  About a mile from thence is  FENWICK TOWER  now in ruins in a low situation the seat of Thomas de Fenwick  Thomas de Fenwick King Henry III  Robert King Edward I  John High Sheriff of Northumberland King Richard II  Sir John Fenwick King William III  Wallis  in the reign of King Henry III It continued for several generations in that family till it came by sale in the reign of King William III to Sir William Blacker In pulling down pan of this tower since I visited it a treasure was found by one of the workmen of the broad gold coin of King Edward I as fresh as if new from the mintage The poor wretch elate with his success exceeded those limits of discretion necessary to secure his wealth by launching out into extravagance he alarmed an envious neighbour and the simple man was soon left to his original poverty by a claim from the owner of the tower  WEST MATFEN  in the neighbourhood of Fenwick Tower next attracted our notice In the reigns of King John and King Henry III it was the manor of Philip de Ulcote who held it by Grand Sergeancy on keeping the pleas of the Crown He was joined in commission with Hugh de Baliol King John A D to hold the castle and town of Berwick upon Tweed against the Barons It afterwards became the inheritance of the Feltons till by marriage it devolved on Sir Edward de Hastings In the reign of Queen Elizabeth it was in the possession of Sir Ra Lawson and after changing its owners several times from that period is now the estate of Sir Edward Blacket whose mansionhouse is seated on a  fine eminence shielded by extensive woods above the river Pont with a vista of considerable extent opening upon the military road The house and pleasure grounds are highly pleasing though not pompous there is that elegance which perfect neatness constitutes to be discerned in the whole  Adjoining to the east side of the vista is a rude stone Column nine feet high near which lately stood a Tumulus which on account of building a farmhouse has been destroyed the people living near it say it was near yards in circumference at the foot but as no re∣mains were left for me to make my observations upon I will give the description found in Mr Wallis's book verbatim  In a field on the east side of the vista about three quarters of a mile from the house is a circular Mount with a round cavity in the middle of the form of the Celtic Tumuli or Temples an upright stone pillar standing by it of a great size nine feet high above ground with flat sides three feet broad and a foot and a half thick The mount is com∣posed of earth and numerous masses of stone of the coarse rag kind many of which have been digged up for the use of this farm and among them were discovered two stone chests or coffins consisting of four flags set edgeways with a bottom stone and a stone cover con∣taining the ashes of the dead appearing like a white dust  From this description I apprehend it was one of the most curious pieces of antiquity of the Tumuli order that was in this county or perhaps the north of England I humbly conceive it was not a Celtic Temple as Mr Wallis calls it being evidently appropriated to the se∣pulture of the dead a defilement at no time permitted by the Druids in their holy places Its distant antiquity is proved by the mode of sepulture the burning of the deceased after the manner of the Ro∣mans was not attended with the mode distinguished herein interment the Danes used burning the deceased but we have no evidence in what manner they practised it in England From the cavity on the crown of the mount similar to some of the Druids monuments I have seen I am induced to apprehend this was the mausoleum of the Druid tribe and of the remotest antiquity and that such cavity was adapted to rites paid to the manes of the deceased Pillars and other memorials of se∣pulture were originally devised as mementos to the passenger of the precariousness of our existence and by remembrance of the virtues of the dead to promote our emulation The custom of burning the re∣mains  of men of rank or power gained an acceptation in very early ages it was consistent with the general ideas of those who held the Amonian rites the spirit or human soul was esteemed to be a spark of etherial fire an emanation of the Deity who made his throne in the orbit of the sun to which they looked up in worship which divine essence in this life was cased up in members of mortality during a pilgrimage allotted to it in a terrestrial state to restore to that element again this offspring of heavenly light they reduced even the loathsome memorials of its bondage that nothing should remain which might cause it to linger on earth But I will add no further to this subject than by way of note to give the reader the quotations and reflections of Mr Wallis  Temples and funeral memorials like this with cepititious or stone altars and an upright pillar untouched by the chisel are the most ancient of any in the world were raised in Judea and all over the Holy Land by the eastern Princes and Patriarchs by whom they were called Bethels and Elbethels The manner of consecration was with oil poured on the pillarOne of these pillars was erected by Jacob and he called is the house of God  Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it And he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of that city was called Luz at the first And he said this stone which I have set up for a pillar shall be God's house Jacob came to Luz which is in the land of Canaan that is Bethel he and all the people that were with him And he built there an altar and called the place Elbethel And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with God even a pillar of stone and he poured a drinkoffering thereon and he poured oil thereon And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him Bethel  The making of altars of earth or of natural stone as formed in the earth was by the direc∣tion of God to Moses  An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it  These temples were generally erected on the higher ground such as were most conspicuous and obvious to fight The one was built by Moses and another by Joshua on Mount Ebal composed of whole natural stones or pillars plaistered with plaister whereon they wrote the divine laws in a great and general assembly of all Israel of all the princes great officers judges and people of every rank and quality strangers and others old and young  Single pillars were also erected by these holy men over the graves of the illustrious dead by some public and much frequented road to have their memories preserved and to put the tra∣veller in mind of their exemplary virtue and piety of his own short continuance on the stage of life and to fit and make himself worthy of such another honourable memorial at his death and of an eternal diadem Thus Jacob buried Rachel the solace and partner of his cares who died with the birth of their son Benjamin "Rachel died and was buried in the way to Ephrah which is Bethlehem And Jacob set a pillar on her grave that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day"  Persons of inferior condition and figure were buried under the shady oaks that flourished at the bottom of the mounts on which the bethels or temples stood They were called the oaks of weeping  Deborah Rebekah's nurse died and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak and the name of it was called Allon Backuth  Heaps of stones rudely cast together were the tombs they assigned to infidel enemies after execution even crowned heads in avenues and places of great concourse to be warnings to the rest of mankind how they rose up against the God of Israel and dishonoured his bethel or holy temple Such a memorial had the King of Ai executed by Joshua  As soon as the sun was down Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree and cast it on the entring of the gate of the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth to this day  Such a memorial likewise had Achan and his family whose bodies were first burnt to ashes with all their treasure and wealth  Hence the open temples the pillars the obelisks the consecrated groves of oak the heaps of stones reared by the Pagans to their false Gods and to the memory of the dead Hence the Egyptian pyramid hence the fair column of the Greeks the Romans and of the several na∣tions taught and ruled by the Druids the primitive religious rites accompanying mankind upon their grand dispersion at the tower of Babel about the th year after the flood according to the Samaritan computation  Wallis  Returning to the military road between the th and th mile stone is a view of  WELTON TOWER  situate on a rising ground adjoining a small village There is no∣thing singular in the structure On entering Northumberland my companion the ingenious Mr Bailey assisted me to draw views of many towers but such a sameness reigned through the whole and they mul∣tiplied upon us so fast we were obliged to desist from further prosecu∣tion of so wearisome and unprofitable a workWe trod the hallowed ground where Finan as Bede tells us then Bishop of Lindisfarn bap∣tized Sigebert King of the East Saxons and Penda King of the Mer∣cians with a numerous train of nobles and adherents This was the ancient seat of the Weltons  Simon de Welton King Henry IV  Thomas King Henry VI  Simon King Edward IV  Michael King Charles I  Wallis  of Simon de Welton in the reign of King Henry IV and continued in that family till the reign of King Charles I  At a little distance from thence stands  HALTON TOWER  There is nothing remarkable in this structure It appertained to the ancient family of Haltons and was possessed in the reign of King  Henry III by John de Halton  John de Halton King Henry III  William of Denum King Edward I  High Sheriff of Northumberland th of that reign  Margaret married Robert de Lowther  married Carnaby  The whole vested in the Carnabys King Richard II  William Carnaby King Henry IV  High Sheriff of Northumberland  Sir John King Henry VI  Sir Reginold King Henry VIII  High Sheriff of Northumberland  Sir Cuthbert Queen Elizabeth  High Sheriff  Sir William King James I  Member of Parliament for Morpeth  In the reign of Charles I Member for Northumberland and High Sheriff  Wallis  Joannes de Hawelton tenet in capite de Domino Rege Halton Lel Col V p  It afterwards descended to two co∣heiresses through whom one moiety came to the family of Lowthers and the other to that of the Carnabys In the reign of King Henry IV the whole possession was in the Carnaby family with whom it conti∣nued for many generations one of whom Sir William Carnaby being a loyalist at the battle of Marsdon Moor in the Northumberland regi∣ment commanded by the Marquis of Newcastle was obliged to fly the land  Here is preserved a sword of the Carnabys inches long one of those illproportioned instruments which was decisive at one blow or left its owner at the mercy of his adversary unable to recover his wea∣pon for a second attack  Such swords as these were used by the Gauls in their wars with the Romans as a defence against which the Roman General Camillus contrived a shield or buckler of iron of the Parma kind of a round form and adorned with studs of brass Mars Bellator of Gradivus is usually described with such a shield It was part of the Armatura Equitum and borne on the left arm  Wallis  It was difficult to be wielded with any ef∣fect by a footman and undoubtedly appertained to the horse service  Mr Wallis gives the following anecdote of one of the Carnaby family "At the time that this country was infested with those thieves called Moss Troopers one of this family had a com∣mission to apprehend and try them Whilst he was deeply engaged on the trial of some of them a very notorious and desperate villain was seized by his son who asked his father what he should do with him Do with him said the father why hang him As soon as the trial was ended he ordered the man to be brought before him but was told he was hanged instantly according to his order On complaint being made to the Crown a fine of l per annum was laid on the Halton e  tate which is still paid"  Wallis  A similar story is told of Lord William Howard at Nawarth in Cumberland  the shield devised by the Romans as a defence against the same was borne by the horsemen  Halton was purchased by John Douglas  Esq  He rebuilt the old parochial chapel there which was then in ruins for the case of his te∣nants though at no great distance from the mother church The Vicar of Corbridge officiates here every third Sunday in the forenoon and at C  rbridge the parish church in the after∣noon  of Newcastle in the year and by marriage has become the possession of Sir Edward Blackett  Within view from the tower is  HALTON CHESTERS  the Hunnum of the Romans situate on an easy descent the remains of the Vallum not perfectly to be tracedThis station is the next fort that appears upon the wall between Rutchester and Walwick Chesters and comes at a due distance and in proper order for the ancient Hun∣num the fifth station in the series of the Notitia garrisoned by the Ala Saviniana  Mr Gordon omitting the station at Halton makes Walwick Chesters to be Hunnum and supposes Cilurnum the next station in the Notitia to have been between Walwick Chesters and Precolitia or Carrawbrugh but now entirely demolished This cannot hold for the walls and their appurtenances are here in the greatest perfection how then should a fort on that part of the wall be entirely ruined so as not to have the least vestige remaining Besides the great distance between Rutchester and Walwick which is above twelve miles shews that there must have been at least one station between them and on the other hand the small distance between Walwick Chesters and Carrawbrugh which is little more than three measured miles renders it most unlikely that there ever should have been another station between them  Hadrian's Vallum seems to have fallen in with the south rampart of this fort and Severus's wall with the north line of the inner part There seems to have been an aqueduct to convey water to this station from a spring on the higher ground near Watlingstreetgate when Mr Horsley passed that way he says he was shewn a part of it by a countryman who said it was what the speaking trumpet was lodged in of this matter I have treated before  The ruins of the outbuildings are to the south and southeast of the fort Near about a furlong to the east of Watlingstreetgate is a vi∣sible Castellum and at the gate there has been a square Castellum half within the wall and half without  Mr Horsley remarks that Severus's military way appears very distinct for the small spaces where it is separated from Hadrian's north Vallum regularly paved but not much raised above the level of the ground When the two are united they make a military way very beautiful and magnificent and the rest both of Severus's and Hadrian's works are ample and conspicuous all this way As for the course of Severus's military way and its coinciding with Hadrian's north Vallum and go∣ing off from it again at every Castellum it seems very curious and it is remarkable that it has not been more observed  From St Oswalds to the river of North Tyne some parts or appur∣tenances of the walls become more faint and obscure and some not vi∣sible at all but yet Severus's wall the ditch and Hadrian's Vallum and ditch are very apparent After the wall has crossed the Tyne it goes to Walwick as before described the distance from whence to Hal∣ton Chesters is near five measured miles and a quarter and in this in∣terval there are five visible Castella besides one that must have stood near the river Tyne but is now entirely lost The constant distance between these Castella seems to have been seven furlongs  Dr Hunter Mr Smith and others take notice of some remains at Portgate or near it within a mile of the Chesters and in the new edition of Camden it is observed that  there is at Portgate a square old tower still standing and great ruins of old buildings  But it was Mr Horsley's opinion this tower had nothing in it that was Roman being of the same form with a multitude of others that are in the north and of a much later date The ruins are at Halton before spoken of  Besides the inscriptions mentioned by Mr Horsley the following were found here  A centurial stone now in the custody of Sir Edward Blackett with a civic garland rudely sculptured and a figure of the Roman Eagle inscribed  LEG II AVG  E  At the same time was found an Extispicia of wood the instrument used by the Auspices in examining the Entrails of sacrificed animals Another centurial stone was also found here inscribed  LEG XX VV  HORTENS  PROCVL  Urns have been dug up here with some Coins of Nero and Constan∣tine and also some of Magnentius and Decentius the remains of sa∣crifices have also been discovered here This Legion according to Dr Stukely after harvest held a solemn festival dedicated to Ceres and Ops the usual victim was a boar  Mr Horsley treats of the following inscription found here  XX Cohortis Se  ae Centuria Statii Solonis Posuit  This was in the w  of an inclosure not far from Portgate Castle it was erected by the Cen∣tury of Statius S  l  a a Centurion of the sixth Cohort probably of the sixth Legion called Victorious which Legion erected th  s inscription  At a C  ll  m were found some Ur  coarse and whitish  We approached  AYDEN CASTLE  now greatly in decay the situation is formidable and from the solem∣nity of its ruins is at this time strikingly august It is placed on the west side of a deep gill on the brink of a precipice at whose foot runs a little brook By the traces remaining of this edifice it appears to have been of considerable extent and strength encompassed by an out∣ward wall in which the loopholes remain One thing remarkable here is a stable with an arched roof of stone without any wood in its structure the mangers being formed of stone troughs It seems con∣structed for the preservation of cattle at the time of assault  The precipice is famous for a Lover's Leap an exploit in amour to∣tally neglected in our degenerate days and incompatible with the silken softness of modern gallants who court the hand of destruction by modes more truly French when despair ruffles their plumes This custom is truly British the influenza of our heavy and gloomy atmospherewe read of no such thing in antiquity or the manners of other nations Jack who made his leap here has immortalized his name but we are deprived of that of his Dulcinea whose frowns had such power over  his forlorn heart Intercourse with polite nations has introduced many changes in our manners most Suicides nowadays are in despair of getting a separation from the sex and not their possession  The prospect from hence is delightful comprehending the vale over which Hexham with imperial looks smiles graciously the river is seen in various meanderings and the opposite banks are graced with the ele∣gant mansion of Beaufront flanked with its extensive plantations  Ayden Castle was the inheritance of the family of Aydens  Emma de Ayden King Edward I Escheats of that reign  for se∣veral generations it appertained to Emma de Ayden a rich heiress in the reign of King Edward I he gave her in marriage to Peter de Wallis whose name is said to be local and derived from Wallis in France and that he was of the same race of the Scotch patriot Wallis whose ancestor came into Britain with the Conqueror Ayden after∣wards became the inheritance of the Raymes  William de Raymes King Edward III High Sheriff  Edward King Henry VI  Robert Queen Elizabeth High Sheriff  Henry King Charles I  Wallis  of Bolham and was in that family from the reign of King Edward III to that of King Charles I A part of the Ayden estate is said to have been in the family of the Carnabys  Camden says near this place was dug up an ancient monument on which the effigy of a man was cut resting on his left arm upon a couch in the attitude used by the Romans his right hand laid upon his right knee with the following inscription    NORICI AN XXX  ESSORIVS MAGNVS  FRATER EIVS  DVPL ALE  SABINIANE  which may be read thus Norici annorum triginta Messorius Magnus Frater ejus duplaris alae Sabinianae This is a curious and useful in∣scription  as it confirms this place to be the Station of Hunnum The cut of the letters is neither very good nor exact nor are they very re∣gular as to their magnitude or distances one from another and the the whole favours of the lower Empire The original is at Conington Norricus is a Roman name that occurs several times in Gruter and the name Messorius is found also in an inscription at Risingham in this county The mark at the bottom looked like a part of a letter as if this stone had been parted from another upon which there was some in∣scription Camden supposes that Sabina Hadrian's wife gave the name to this Ala but it was thought more probable by Mr Horsley that it was taken from Sabinia the wife of the Emperor Gordian to whose time this inscription much better agrees  Also the following inscription is mentioned by Camden  M MARI  VS VELLI  A LONG  VS AQVI  S HANC  POSVIT  V S L M  M Marius Vellia Longus Aquis hanc Posuit V S L M Mr Horsley presumed that Aquis here is for Eques so Equis for Eques we meet with in other instances and perhaps an A for an E has been the error of the transcriber This horseman might also belong to the Ala Sabiniana  We descended to  CORBRIDGE  Though the town makes

and definition now extant have been communi∣cated to me among the manuscripts of the late Roger Gale  Esq  and I do not doubt the curious reader will readily pardon my inserting the papers at length which relate thereto  From the Manuscripts of the late  Roger Gale  Esq  Extract from the Newcastle Newspaper with an account of an ancient Silver Plate found near Corbridge in Northumberland  "A few days since near the Roman wall in Northumberland was found by a smith's daughter in Corbridge an ancient piece of silver in shape like a teaboard inches long and broad hollowed about an inch deep with a flat brim an inch and a quarter broad neatly flowered with a vine full of grapes cOn the right hand is a figure of  Apollo  with the bow in his left hand and a physical herb in his right under a canopy supported by two Corinthian pillars near his left leg is a  Tyre  under it an  Helistrope  and at his feet a  Python  near the right hand pillar is another of a different form with a sun for its capital against this sits a  Priestess  on a tripod who looks over her shoulder at  Apollo  under her feet is an altar near which lies a stag on his backThe next figure to the Priestess is another female her head unveiled with a spear or wand in her left hand on the top of which is a ball and near her is  Minerva  with a helmet on her head a spear in her left hand pointing with her right to a man supposed an Hunter on the other side of a large tree on Minerva's breast is a  Medusa's head  under her feet an altar and near it a wolf looking up to a man who has a bow in his left and an arrow in his right hand below him at one corner of the plate is a rock with an urn in the midst of it from which flows a stream The figures are raised large and well proportioned and castwork without the least sign of a graver upon it There are a few scratches of a punch or chisel on the back of it the three first are I PX but the rest is very unintelligible It had under the middle of it a low frame about inches long broad and one and an half deep but this was broken off by the smith though once all of a piece It was found by a little brook or watercourse near the abovementioned place and weighing about ounces was bought by Mr Cookson a gold∣smith of Newcastle who values it at a high rate It has been described by several  Virtuosi  to the Royal Society that of the Antiquarians and others who esteem it a valuable relique of antiquity"  Letter from  Mr Robert Cay  with an account of the Corbridge Silver Plate March  "SIR  "My fondness to antiquity is revived and with it the memory of my obligations to you by a Silver Table that has lately fallen into the hands of Mr Isaac Cookson a goldsmith in this town It was found near Corbridge by some ignorant poor people who have cut off the feet in such a vile barbarous manner that they have broke two holes through the table and a small piece off one of the corners too It is inches and ½ long and broad the feet ½ long and ½ broad and about one inch high it weighs about ounces I imagine it to have been cast all in one piece most of the work is in basse relief the rest engraved It represents a sacrifice to  Apollo  whose image stands in a small temple by two Corinthian pillars against one of them seems to be a pile of some square blocks and close to it sits a Priestess upon a stool that shews but two feet behind her is a column with a globe upon it I suppose to represent the sun though had it been alone I should not have thought so near her stands another in the same habit and a third that seems to have the attributes of  Pallas  particularly the headpiece Near the last is a man  This figure is Diana not a manR G  with a bow in his left hand and an arrow in his right before him is an altar and a dog I think a grey∣hound near him behind him is a large spreading tree with an eagle parched upon it there are also several small birds about it but these are only engraved In the lower corner next the man on the left hand as you look at it there is a rocky hill and on the side of it lies an urn with a stream of water running out perhaps designed to represent the river Tyne The two standing women hold each of them a staff of their own height Afore the temple is another altar on one side of which lies a griffin and on the other side next the man a buck which seems to be killed for a sacrifice near the buck grow two ears of corn tyed together and near the griffin a shrub of three or four branches that has at the end of each branch somewhat formed like a fan There is a border raised round the whole higher than the plain which is adorned with a vine the branch is engraved but the grapes and leaves are in basse relief I am Sir yours c  ROBERT CAY  Newcastle  March  "I heartily wish this table was in the hands of some curious gentle∣man well able to make such purchases for I find Mr Cookson will expect  profit though I hope he will not be unreasonable I should have taken notice that the workmanship appears in all respects to be of the lower Empire"  Another Letter from  Mr Cay  on the Corbridge Silver Plate  March  "SIR  "Soon after the post was gone from hence I received yours of the th This morning I went to the goldsmith who soon convinced me of my error in saying the birds c were engraved and that all which I thought to be engraved was struck with the chisel and punch so that I must own your suspicions were well grounded Mr Cookson's father happens to be here now I take him to be well versed in the art of casting of metals he shewed me several marks near one end in the middle of which end there is a crack which marks and crack he says are proofs that it was cast in one piece  "I enquired again about the price but Mr Cookson waved saying any thing different from what I mentioned to you yesterday which was that he hoped it would produce him about guineas  "As to the place where it was found he says he can tell me no more than that it was somewhere near Corbridge He apprehends the person who sold it to him was afraid to name the particular place or to confess in whose manor it was discovered as fearing a claim from the Lord of the Manor  "Since writing the above I am told a kind of a claim has been made on behalf of the Duke of Somerset though neither his Grace's officer nor the goldsmith know in whose manor it was found  "On the back of the table there is a kind of inscription which I cannot pretend to read but will endeavour to represent it below  I am Sir yours c ROBERT CAY  "P S I am told two other pieces of antique plate have been since found in the same place One of them was sold to a gentleman in Cumberland and the other to a goldsmith in this town who thinking it much damaged had melted it down before I heard of it  R C"  Letter from  Sir John Clerk  in answer to one from  Mr Gale  giving an account of the Corbridge Silver Plate  "The account you have sent me of the silver table found near Cor∣bridge is very surprizing How happy had Mr Gorden and I been when we were hunting for Roman Antiquities in that country if this valuable curiosity had fallen into our hands As to the use of it I make no question of its being a  tabula votiva  and that it has been hung up or kept in a temple at Corbridge dedicated perhaps to  Apollo  or  Ceres  No doubt the Roman officer who commanded in these northern parts of Britain thought himself very happy to find good meat and drink in a country where he expected to find nothing but famine and bar∣barity and therefore in gratitude made this present to the God of the place  "I cannot help since I am in this way of thinking to reflect a little upon what I observed in a church called  Notre Dame de Halle  about miles from Brussels the walls were hung round with silver legs and arms cups and several other things in silver as tokens of gratitude to the blessed Virgin for having by her means and intercession been reco∣vered from infirmities and distempers  "Among other things I could not but take notice of a Silver Pen which old doating  Justus Lipsius  had sent thither some years before out of gratitude as an inscription told us for that by the assistance of the Virgin Mary he had been enabled with so much eloquence c to write a Treatise  de Miraculis B Virginis Hallensis  I called to mind upon that occasion passages very agreeable to your Silver Table and

of engraving yet they did what was next to it for they were used to cut some remarkable laws and edicts in brass tables as they used to make inscriptions in marble or stone I have seen some of these parti∣cularly at Lyons which at that time made me reflect on the dulness of the Romans and all mankind besides that by means of these brass plates they had not fallen upon the art of printing for if these had been daubed over with any sort of colour and clapt upon the paper or parchment they would soon have introduced that art but there are many plain things that mankind cannot see into all of a sudden and which are reserved for posterity I'd be glad to hear from you after you have seen this fine plate 'tis well the goldsmith did not melt it down as some modern Goths of this trade have frequently done  I am ever Sir  Pennycink  th March  Your most faithful humble servant JOHN CLERK  "By way of corollary I must add to what I have said above that if search was made in the very place

account of the Corbridge Silver Plate c  d May  "SIR  "It was with much pleasure I received and communicated to our little fraternity your very obliging and ingenious account of the Cor∣bridge Silver Table which honour I am commanded to return you thanks for and for your very kind promise of continuing to us the most valuable favour of your ever entertaining judicious and improving correspondence On reading your account of that massy piece some of us thought it might have been part of an  Acerra  or sacred coffer wherein incense and odours were preserved for the service of the altar or salt c for some sorts of sacrifices others have perhaps with more reason conceived it to be a stand salver or sort of waiter to set such things on or even the  Acerra  or perhaps for domestick uses for we are too apt to apply every relique of antiquity as being venerable to  sacred purposes The Society next succeeding which was the st of last month we had much the like account but the dimensions a little different and the figures or characters on the back said to be I P X with the unintelligible traces of more to us they are so  "Our friend and brother member Mr Bogdani in a letter I lately

of which people as we have fewer remains in the arts of designing when they are said to have been in a great mea∣sure lost I should be glad if this shewed us somewhat of their ceremo∣nies or customs

I remember to have read in  Verstegan  or elsewhere of the Saxons I cannot apply any part of this design peculiarly to any piece of their sacred or civil history from the coins even of their latest Princes they seem to me to have had less notions of designing after nature and to have done their work in a much worse taste than our old British ancestors of whom I am satisfied I have seen several coins or medals in every one of the three metals not imitating or borrowed from the Romans or made by Roman workmen and of these some by the extraordinary boldness of the relief and all by their convexity more in the manner of some of the eastern people than the Romans to whom the manner of chariotfighting seemed strange though very cus∣tomary with the eastern nations whose strength for the battle was fre∣quently calculated or estimated by the number of their chariots and horsemen and I cannot say I ever saw a fair piece of old convex coin found in England but had on it some design of a horse horseman cha∣riot or wheels and sometimes with more things with them Notwith∣standing what has been advanced against the judgment of Sir Robert Cotton Selden Speed Camden c I cannot but think that in the main they give us rational conjectures about the British coins or medals if we should not allow them to be current coin for which yet I see not any reason unless we are bound to take all for truth and fact which the Romans relate and admit also that they told the whole truth and all that was really fact of those brave polite and honest people whom they so gloried in annoying and

relating the Corbridge Silver Plate  "SIR  "I had yours of the st instant in due time but since you was to go down to Cambridge I delayed giving you any trouble till now I am very much obliged to you for the particular account you have been pleased to send me of the Silver Table I am sorry that you think it not ancient and yet by the figures it should seem so still I humbly think that if these figures relate to any known piece of history among the ancients they may be modern but if they relate to nothing of this kind they may be ancient still at least of the lower Empire or the Greek In  Father Mabillon's Diplomata  there are several engravings which one would believe to be modern and yet are of the th th th th and th centuries The argument I now would draw from these is only this

the Silver Table you think it ancient This was always the notion I conceived of it for I could not imagine any modern Sculptor could get into his head so much ancient imagery without any foundation from ancient history or fable I am indifferent who gets the better in the lawsuit  Duke of Somerset against Mr Cookson  but I hope it will be preserved and kept in the country I fancy with myself you will be able to discover some piece of our history from it for I make not the least question but it has been a present from some of the Roman Emperors and alludes to some memorable affairs at the time The table has served I believe for an oblation of fruits or corn on some remarkable altar near the wall erected to the honour of perhaps  Diana Ceres  or  Bacchus  and that it has afterwards been hung up in the temple dedicated to one of these Deities An Irishman would perhaps discover the antiquity of Ireland from the Harp and I believe you will be inclined to think one of the figures is a representation of Britain I am c  August  JOHN CLERK"  Letter from  Roger Gale  Esq  to Mr  Robert Cay  upon the Silver Plate found at Corbridge  "When I wrote last I had only time to return you thanks for the favour you procured me from Mr Cookson of taking a draught of his most curious Silver Table being to go out of town next morning Since I came back upon perusing the letters I received from you on that occasion I find in one of them a desire of knowing my thoughts upon that subject which I cannot refuse to a gentleman who has laid me under so many obligations and to whom the pleasure and enter∣tainment I have received from the frequent views of that uncommon and valuable piece of antiquity are entirely due and the less because the accounts hitherto published of it seem to me not a little erroneous  "I shall begin to describe it from the right hand to the left as you look upon the face of the plate where  Apollo  the principal figure in the whole piece is placed in a  fanum  or small temple the roof of which is supported by two wreathed columns with flowered capitals almost naked having only a  pallium  hanging down from his left shoulder over his  back in the same hand is his bow which he holds up towards the top of the column on the same side his right hand is extended down∣wards with a branch in it perhaps of laurel cross that pillar against which almost to the middle of it rises a pyramidical pile of pieces for what it is intended I must confess my ignorance  See the plate  "Against the basis of the left hand column rests a lyre whose form is truly antique and beneath it grows a plant with three spreading flowers at its three extremities designed as I suppose for an  Heliotrope  close by it couches a  Griffin  with its wings elevated over its back The Ancients had so high an opinion of the sagacity of this fictitious animal that they consecrated it to the God of Wisdom  Begerus  gives us a medal of  Commodus  the reverse whereof is  Apollo  in a chariot drawn by two  Griffins  and the poet  Claudian  alludes to this manner of his riding in the following distich  Ac si Phoebus adest et fraenis Grypha jugalem  Riphaeo tripodas repetens detorsit ab axis c  Claudian VI Cons Honorii  "Against the right hand column and this pyramidical pile sits a woman upon a square fourfooted stool though no more than two of its legs are visible she looks backward over her left shoulder towards  Apollo  and is wrapped up in a long garment or stola from head to foot and veiled By this attire and the altar which was brought from Troy with the eternal fire burning upon it just by her I take her to be  Vesta  Manibus vittas vestamque potentem  Aeternumque adytis effert penetralibus ignem  Virgil  Et vos Virgineâ lucentes semper in arâ  Laomidontiae Trojana altaria flammae  Sil Hal  Her left hand is reposed upon her breast and in her right which rests upon the same thigh she holds a little bundle bound about with a ribbon perhaps of wool  "Below her lies a buck dead on one side turning up his belly and behind her rises a tall pillar with a globe upon it probably to de∣note the earth of which she was Goddess  "The next is a woman erect her hair gathered up and tied with a knot behind upon her forehead rises a  Tutulus  and she is habited in a  Stola  from her shoulders to the ground her right arm is wrapped up cross her breast in her garb only the hand appearing out of it in her  left she holds a spear the shaft twisted the iron of it something obtuse This seems to be the only human figure in the company but a very learned gentleman  Mr Blackwall author of the Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer  of my acquaintance thinks it may be designed for  Juno  who is often thus accoutred with a spear if so it must be the effigies of  Juno curis  or  Juno hastata  we have it from Ovid  " Quod hasta curis priscis est dicta sabinis"  She was the same with  Juno pronuba  Celebri hasta nubentis caput co∣mebatur vel quia  Junonis curitis  in tutelâ esset vel ut fortes viros ominaretur  but as there is no peacock nor any other attribute of her divinity attending her and her appearance no ways majestick or adequate to the  Divum regina Jovisque  Et soror et conjux  I cannot be entirely of his opinion especially as she seems by her posture and attitude to be a follower and attendant of the next figure which is plainly  "PallasGaleá effulgens et Gorgone saevá"  the head of that monster as usual being fixt upon her breast In her left hand she holds a sharppointed spear her right is extended towards  Diana  with whom she seems engaged in a very earnest discourse to which also that Goddess seems very attentive she is the last figure in the group though called a man in all the accounts I have seen of this table and repre∣sented here as the  Diana venatrix  by the  coif  and feminine dress of her head tuck'd up with a knot behind like the hair of the third figure as well as by the bow in her left and arrow in her right hand Her short  Tunica  which reaches down little more than to the middle of her thighs and her buskins that come up no higher than the calf of her legs has occasioned this mistake of her sex but Ovid tells us  "Talia succincta pinguntur crura  Dianae  "Cum sequitur fortes fortior ipsa feras"  Between the two figures of  Pallas  and  Diana  rises a tall slender tree with a crooked waving stem the branches of which are displayed al∣most over twothirds of the top of the plate On the main branch is perch'd an eagle with one wing expanded as if going to take a flight this is of raised solid work like the rest of the figures but there are several small birds sitting among the boughs that are only punch'd or cut in with a tool as are also several festoons hanging down from the  tree and many other little shrubs and flowers interspersed all over the area of the table The great bird sitting directly over the head of  Pallas  made me conclude at first that it was her owl till I had seen the ori∣ginal which convinced me that it can be designed for nothing but an eagle  "Under this tree stands an altar and so close to  Diana  that she holds her left hand and bow over it It is but little and has nothing upon it except a small globular body perhaps a mass of the  Libamina ex farre melle et oleo  "I should have told you that below the feet of  Pallas  grows a plant which seems to bear two ears of corn upon the same stalk but cannot say what it is or how it belongs to her Beneath the tree and the little altar stands a thingutted dog like a greyhound his nose turned up in a howling or barking posture as often exhibited with this God∣dess on medals and in other representations of her some  Acutae vocis Hyclator  Aut substricta gerens Sicyonius Ilia Ludon  Ovid  Under her in the very corner of the plate rises a rock upon which she sets her left foot and against the side of it lies an  urn  with the mouth downwards discharging a plentiful stream of water As she stands upon this rock or hill and so near to this spreading tree I cannot but think of Horace's address to her  "Montium custos Nemorumque Virgo"  The whole table is encompassed with a border raised near an inch high and ornamented with a creeping vine whose grapes and leaves are in  relievo  but the stalk only tooled  "The work of this curious piece is neither of the best or worst of times the figure of  Vesta  particularly is extremely well executed the posture free the drapery soft and easy and what is very remarkable the  instita  or border an ornament of the  stola  appropriated to the Ro∣man ladies of quality  "Quarum subsuta talos tegit instita veste"  Horace  is neatly worked all round this of our  Vesta  and those of the other female Deities nor is the next figure much inferior I cannot nor has any body else who has seen it discover that the plan has any relation to any story in the  Heathen Mythology  but seems only an assemblage of the Deities it re∣presents this may be some argument of its antiquity  See Sir John Clerk's Letter th August  for had a mo∣dern workman had the designing of it he would in all probability have taken some known piece of history for his subject to which I may add all the symbols are genuine and truly adapted to their owners  "I was once of opinion that it might have been the cover of an  Acerra  but the foot which supported it puts an end to the surmise We don't well know what the  Anclabris  was the definition of it is in  Festus  as follows  Anclabris mensa divinis ministeriis apta dicebantur autem an∣clabria et Anclabris ab anculare quod erat ministrare  This is big enough to contain the  Exta  of a sheep or other small victims which seems to me to be the likeliest employment for it and that it was one of these sacrificing utensils that Virgil more than once calls  Lances  "Lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus Exta  Virg G v  " Lancesque et Liba feremus  Virg G v  "Dona ferunt cumulántque oneratis Lancibus Aras"  Virg Aen v  These  Lances  were both round and square but the  Discus  used for the same purpose seems to have been always round  "If you have the patience to read this over you will have reason to think me not a little impertinent in giving you so minute a descrip∣tion of what you had seen so often and so long before it came under my view but as I chance to have some notions different from what appeared to you and as I could not well explain my thoughts upon it without entering into the particulars I hope you will excuse me My service to Mr Cookson if he is desirous of seeing this he may command it but pray let no copy be taken of it  I am Your most obedient humble servant R GALE  London  d Aug  "NB Letters to the same purport though not so full were wrote to Mr

there at his banishment or since He might purchase it in his travels in France or at Rome I take them to have been to adorn the sideboards of the Romans upon festivals  "I have drawn lately Abbot

Diodora  Hercules was the symbol of the sun Julian informs us that magnificent sports were cele∣brated at the conclusion of the year to the invincible sun And the inscription Soli invicto is found upon the medals of many of the Roman Emperors Divine honours were paid to him in open temples and groves  Wallis  The Corbridge altars have been learnedly wrote on by several ingenious persons besides those quoted which are published in the st volume of the Archaeologia V p but the best explanation has been given by the Hon Danies Barrington in the th volume of that work from whence the following extracts are made  Both inscriptions if read at length make two regular hexameters viz    Which conjecture has been confirmed by Mr Graham of Netherby who says there are still traces of the cross stroke forming the top of the Π which is the first letter in the name of the person who consecrates the altar    Mr Wallis if not an error of his printer seems to be more mistaken than Dr Todd in his opi∣nion of this altar supposing it to be an altar in honour of Tyrian Hercules dedicated to Diodora the Priestess V p  There are some singular circumstances attending these altars which may perhaps be deemed companionsThey furnish the only Greek inscriptions which were ever found in Great Bri∣tain they both consist of a single hexameter they are inscribed to Syrian Deities and they are discovered in the same parish of Corbridge It is not extraordinary that Greek inscriptions should be scarce in England it is rather necessary to account why any such should have been discovered Though the Romans most commonly used their own language and characters yet some of them must have been born under circumstances which made the Greek tongue more fa∣miliar to them we need therefore only suppose that  Pulcher  and  Diodora  who dedicate these two altars were the son and daughter of a Roman officer quartered in Greece or some neighbour∣ing province and who died soon after he had children by a Grecian wife the Greek language would certainly be more familiar than the Latin to a Roman with such an education They both consisting of hexameters seem to prove they were dedicated about the same time and and that they were intended to be companions especially as their outward form is very similar as well as the characters made use of The greater difficulty seems to be why both altars should be inscribed to the Syrian Deities  Astarte  and  Tyrian Hercules  This however it seems may be accounted for to ways Pulcher and Diodora might possibly have either resided or been born in Syria and had perhaps received some good fortune which they might ascribe at least to these Deities It is conceived that wherever a Roman continued for anytime he probably worshipped the local Deities when there were not temples at hand which were erected to the Gods adored at Rome Such Romans therefore might continue their veneration for Astarte and Tyrian Hercules when removed from Syria to Britain But possibly it is not necessary that Pulcher and Diodora should have been at all in that province There is one difficulty however still remaining with regard to the altar dedicated to Tyrian Hercules which is that it is inscribed by a Woman and Archpriestess At first it strikes that she must have been Arch∣priestess to such a God and I believe there are few instances of women having this dignity in the temples of male Deities at the same time that there would be a particular indelicacy if they devoted themselves to Hercules  As for these altars being found at Corbridge it is easily accounted for if the above conjec∣tures are allowed in other respects because it is known to have been a considerable station and near to the Roman wall The inscription on the altar to the Tyrian Hercules hath already been four times engraved and may perhaps be matter of curiosity to compare the different co∣pies as the stone is soft and seems to have suffered within these years some of the charac∣ters being  e  ff  edThat the inscription is not more ancient than the time I ascribe it to may be proved if it was necessary by the  inscribed in the last word APXIEPE'A Though I have no less authority however than that of Montfaucon for this remark yet it may not be improper to observe that Se  o Masfe  denies that any arguments drawn merely from the form of characters can be at all conclusive  Extract of a Letter from  Mr John Horsley  to  Roger Gale  Esq  th April  SIR  I am honoured with yours of the d instant which this morning came safe to hand I was not willing to loose the find opportunity of returning an answer and though I am upon this account obliged to write the more hastily yet I hope you will excuse it and attribute it to the true cause my zeal to serve you in every thing that lies in my power  There is no inscription in Britain which I can better answer for than the Greek one at  C  bridge  I have several times seen and examined it myself with all the nicety and care I  could at first sight I discerned a manifest difference in some things between the original and copies that had been published in the  Ph Tr No p  Philosophical Transactions and was more and more confirmed in my opinion when I re∣examined it with a particular view to this difference However being very diffident of my∣self when I happen to differ from others I prevailed with a curious gentleman to go on purpose to take an impartial account of it I got also another to do the same and all our three copies agreed with a surprizing exactness I have turned over all my papers this morn∣ing in quest of the first copy but can by no means find it the other I have met with and sent you inclosed My own is in the hands of the Engraver at London and the plate containing this inscription is ready and I believe wrought off I take the plain meaning of this inscrip∣tion to be no more than that this altar was erected  to Hercules by Diadora the Archpriestess  if it be to the  Tyrian Hercules  the d letter in the d line must have been a double Rho thus Φ so as that it is  Tirrio  for  Tyrio  There is a flaw in the stone at the head of this let∣ter so as that it may have been closed at the top but by that part of the letter left in the breach I am very certain that there was no Y in the inscription The word in the d line may be  Tirrio Tiphio  or  Tipsio  probably a topical name but  Tyrio  I am sure it is not  I discovered another Greek inscription at  Lanchester  which by the way I believe to be  Glanoventa  and Old Town  Galana  but it is so imperfect that I could scarce be sure it was Greek if it will be acceptable I will transmit a copy of it to you The last time I saw the  altar  erected by  Diodora  it was in the  churchyard  of  Corbridge  The church of Durham had formed a design to remove it thither but failed in their attempt I should be glad if they had made a second with better success  Doctor Hunter  told me pleasantly he would threaten the people of  Corbridge  with a prosecution from the Spiritual Court for keeping a  Pagan altar  in their  church yard  I asked him then what he would have done to those of  Bowes  who according to  Camden  had used a Heathen stone for their communion table  I am c JOHN HORSLEY"  Extract of a Letter to  Mr Horsley  from  Roger Gale  Esq  th April  SIR  I am much obliged to you for the quick return you made to my first letter and the most accurate copy of the Greek inscription that you sent with it It was at the desire of  Mr Mat∣tatre  that I wrote to you and both he and I are of your opinion that the second word could never have been  but then it is very difficult to unriddle the word  That gentleman has been very busy for some time in giving us a new edition of  Dr Prideaux's Marmora Arundeliana  sheets are already printed off and as he is a person of the greatest learning industry and accuracy we may expect a performance equal to all those qualifica∣tions Since the other Greek inscription at  Langchester  is so much obliterated that you can scarcely discern whether it is in that language or not you may excuse yourself the trouble of sending it to me but I make no doubt of your taking notice of it in your great work if it is only to shew us that there has been one more inscription in that tongue found in this island where indeed it is very strange that we should have any at all  As for the inscription DEO HERCVLENTI lately discovered at  Riechester  I take it to be the very same as if it had been  Deo Herculi  and the termination ENTI to be only a  metap lasmus  after the Greek manner as in the words  c Something like it you may see in other inscriptions as  Chryseti  for  Chrysae  in Reinesius's Syntagma Inser p  ROGER GALE"  the Priestess of the Tyrian Hercules three feet four inches and a quarter in height      Mr Horsley published this inscription and esteemed it one of the greatest curiosities in Britain It is now in the possession of the Duke of Nor∣thumberland  Mr Horsley gives the following reading and remarks upon it  h e Herculi Tirrio Diodora Princeps Sacerdos It has been twice published in the Transactions by Dr Hunter and Dr  Todd The differences between their copies and this will appear upon comparing them one with another This copy was taken after the original had been thrice visited and examined with care and  every variation in the former copies diligently marked Dr Todd's delineation is different both from Dr Hunter's and mine He trans∣lates it Herculi Tyrio divina dona archisacerdotalia vel per summum Sacerdotem offerenda but he offers no reason to confirm this transla∣tion Dr Hunter's copy has been taken with more exactness but not without some little variations from the original nor has he translated or explained the inscription but the most material difference be∣tween the other copies and the original is in the second letter of the second line which they represent as  though it is plainly  The next letter in the same line is very distinct as to the greatest part of it but towards the top is a flaw in the stone If no stroke or part of the letter is lost in this flaw the letter must be  if this break be supposed to contain a part of the letter which is most probable then it may either be  or rather a double  with one face back∣ward as the double  is frequently expressed upon Latin inscriptions If this be admitted the word will be Tirrio probably for Tyrio and the whole may then as I apprehend be translated as in the reading  Several ancient writers take notice of the peculiar regard and wor∣ship paid to Hercules by the Tyrians Arrian says his temple in that city was the oldest upon record Diodora the Archpriestess men∣tioned in this inscription might perhaps be devoted to his service That this was an office of great dignity and not below persons of the first rank appears from another inscription produced by Mont∣faucon which is  "Caracylaea Arch priestess descended from Kings"  We have likewise an inscription in the Marmora Oxoniensis where one Aurelia Fausta has this title given her that inscription having been erected at Smyrna the learned Editor supposes the Lady was Archpriestess to Diana and among other reasons he assigns this because Priestess ministered only to female Deities Now if this observation was universally true it would destroy the supposition above men∣tioned relating to Diodora But there is an inscription in Gruter ATERIA SACER DATIS PA which I think can mean no∣thing else but  Ateria Priestess of Pluto  And Pausanias says expressly that it was customary for a virgin to officiate as Priestess in the tem∣ple of Neptune in Calaurea It appears therefore by these in∣stances that women were not wholly excluded from the priesthood of male Deities Caracylaea in the inscription of Montfaucon is said presently after to have been wife to C Julius Severus the same as  Montfaucon thinks who according to the Fasti Consulares was Con∣sul in the year And why may we not suppose that Diodora was married to some commander of the Roman forces who brought her hither where she erected this altar in honour of the Deity to whose service she had been particularly devoted And the like may be said with respect to other Grecian Deities whose altars are found here in Britain as Jupiter Dolichenus and Dea Syria which might be set up by persons originally of those countries where these Deities were more particularly worshipped  The other altar is dedicated to Astarte  Astarte was the symbol of the moon being worshipped by moonlight in open temples and groves first with pure and afterwards with impure rights In the sacred writings Judges iii Reg xi she it stiled Ashtaroth also the Deity and Abomination of the Sidonians The prophet complains that Solomon went after Ashtaroth the Goddess of the Sidonians Jezabel first paid her divine honours in Israel the most ancient temple that of Ascalon prophets serving therein  Wallis  With these in troop  Came Ashtoreth whom the Phoenicians call'd  Astarte Queen of Heaven with crescent horns  To whose bright image c  Milton's Par Lost B l  N B Hiram King of Tyre and contemporary with Solomon built two temples which he dedicated to Astarte and Tyrian HerculesSee Josephus lib c  The observations made on this altar in the st volume of the Archeologis by the Rev Dr Pettingal and Dr Adee may also be agreeable to the reader in this place  The person who communicated this inscription to the Society a few years ago informed us that it was found about Corbridge  near the wall  where as there were many Roman Legions particularly the Legio Secunda Augusta Vicesima Victrix ordered thither the first from Isca Silurum the other from Deva or Chester in order to keep the wall in order and defend it we can make no doubt of its being Roman notwithstanding it is written in Greek charac∣ters for this manner of writing inscriptions was an affectation frequently to be met with in the lower Empire or after the time of Constantine and was sometimes carried so far that when the language was entirely Latin the character was Greek and vice versa examples of which are to be found in Fabretti Inscrip p and  I read the first word ACITHC which I suppose relative to the collective body of Ala Prima Astorum of which we read the first was stationed at  Condurco  the last at Cilurno per Lineam Valli Condurco is called by Mr Camden Chesterlestreet and Cilurno Walwick  These Asti we are told in the Notitia came from Asta Colonia Ligurum now Asti in Piedmont the portion of lands that in the Agrarian division fell to the Asti lay hereabouts I mention this because it may perhaps throw light upon the particular ΒΩΜΟΝ ΜΕʗΟΡ which I am inclined to think stands for  from whence it will appear that this monumental altar was also an Ara Terminalis for  signifies a boundary between lands of different property and perhaps here between the allotments of the different companies of the soldiers  The word  does not stand here in a religious sense for an altar whereon they were to sacrifice or make libations to any God but signified the same as Ara in the Latin inscrip∣tions  What was the use of this  when it was  and erected on the bounds of lands we may learn from the Agrarian laws the placing them on the bounds of their lands or mili∣tary a  ments as meers or bounds to  property for which reason they are called by Dolobella Fines Sepul  rii C  riti and seem to be confined merely to the partition of conquered lands among the soldiers The law of Tiberius ordered Cum Ager divisus m  traderetur extremis a compag  nantibus agris limitibus monumenta sepulchrave sacra∣rentur that when l  ds were to be divided among the soldiers the monuments or sepul∣chres should always be in the bounds Again Forum igitur sepulchrorum sequenda est con∣  tio qua extre  fimbus c  nc  rrentes plu  agrorum cursa spectant that the same law about sepulchres should continue and  which they were appointed as limits between adjoining lands By which I conceive  meant that all the lands inward from that sepul∣chre did belong to the troop or b  d of which the deceased whose monument that was had been a part as for instance all the land inward from that monument to another that bounded it on the other side did being to the A    Probably this was monumental boundary on the lands of the Asti who were stationed whereabout  ted by the N  a  The custom of burying on the extreme limits of their lands was very ancient and derived most probably from the east In the last chapter of Joshua we read that he was buried in the border of his inheritance  The date of the inscription before us seems to be between the years and of the christian  a for the Not  ia which was written after the time of Arcadius and Honorius as appears by the words of the title Ultra Arcad  Honorii tempora speaks of the Asti settled ad lineam vall  at the time of writing it which was after the time of the death of Arcadius and years after A D the Romans totally deserted Britain So that this inscription is to be placed between the death of Arcadius and the final departure of the Romans  Pettingal May th  Inscriptions in general Greek ones particularly are accompanied with great embarrasments  ng to their shortness the ignorance of carvers and the inaccuracy of transcribers and publishers Few copies are fac  miles though this inscription may be looked upon as such apprehend nothing can make grammar or sense of it but reading it in this manner  Here the three most necessary companions in a votive inscription are expresly declared the Goddess to whom it was dedicated  the thing dedicated  and the donor  It must be observed that  always governs a dative case of the person other expressed or understood instances of which in inscriptions are innumerable Hence  must be read    S Adee  a Syrian Goddess and is now in the possession of the Rev Mr Graham of Netherby The en∣graving  is copied from an elegant one given in the Archaeologia Dr Stukeley gives the following reading of it  Marcus Egorast the son of  Acherm dedicates this altar to Astarte  Dr Stukeley seems never to have been more unhappy in his conjectures than when he in∣terprets these words as above  The names he presumes are Syriac Arabic or Punic and the adoption of Marcus proceeds from the Roman connection  This altar supposed to be inscribed by the Priest is attributed to a Marine Legion raised by Hadrian in Syria called the Ulpian Legion which followed Carausius in the time of Maximian  The following short Anecdotes of Carausius may not be disagreeable  The Emperor Carausius is represented as a graceful person He was descended of British parents The British Empire by sea is attributed to him Constantine instituted the office of Comes Litoris Saxonici which Carausius filled with immortal honour the Saxons in that age sending forth a set of daring pirates who distressed the British coast Under Maximian he held the office of Admiral of the Roman navy He advanced to such a height in the esteem of the people that he was induced to throw off the Roman authority and assume the Imperial power in Britain Maximian with the whole naval force of Rome approached the British coast to chastise him for his temerity and his associates for their defection He withstood them near the Isle of Wight with the British navy he sought and conquered and from that time held the supreme authority independent of Rome superior to all its power But such is the precarious∣ness of human glory such the instability of sublunary things this hero fell by the hands of an assassin in his palace at York slain by the traiterous sword of an insiduous wretch under the specious character of a friendThere is not in human life a more happy acquisition than a friend where we can find "the feculence of falshood long thrown down" giving all the mind to benevolence and generosity but on the other hand there is not so pernicious an enemy as he who under a specious character insinuates himself into the bosom of a generous and open∣minded man and there like Milton's toad "poisoning the animal spirits" carries on the operations of the Devil If the regions of the damned are permitted to send forth the tribes of Lucifer to torment mankind those of superior diabolic and infernal talents must take upon them this most accomplished of hellish characters  Camden conjectures Corbridge was the Curia Ottodinorum of the Romans noted by Ptolomy and the Corstopitum of Antonine He has this singular remarkthat here King John searched for hidden trea∣sures of the ancients but was deceived no less than Nero when he sought for the hidden wealth of Dido at Carthage  Leland p  From my view of the extensive ruins at Corchester near this place I should conceive it was the chief Roman city in this part of Britain Leland says in his time the names of divers streets remained and great tokens of old foundations  At a little distance from Corbridge is  CORCHESTER  where are the remains of a Roman Station it is unnoticed in the No∣titia and is conjectured was abandoned at the time of taking that ac∣count of the Roman Empire in Britain It is not larger than those stations near the wall before described the remains of the Pretorium are yet very conspicuous This station stands on the tongue of land formed by the stream of Cor at its conflux with the Tyne Nothing curious remains at this time but the foundations of a bridge visible at low water believed to be of Roman construction  Dr Todd in the Philosophical Transactions supposes the name to have been originally Herculcester i e Castra Herculis What led him to this opinion is the altar with the Greek inscription dedicated to the Tyrian Hercules Mr Horsley was of opinion  that as Corstopidum had been generally so it is very justly placed at the station near Cor∣bridge This place has generally been taken for Ptolomy's Curia Ota∣denorum because there seems to be some affinity between the names and because the Otadini must certainly be placed hereabouts  but he differs in opinion concerning this matter and concludes that Corsto∣pidum and Curia were different names and altogether different places  The Erminstreet way having crossed the Tyne proceeds towards Ebchester in the bishoprick of Durham and continues its course almost in a meridian line to Dover in Kent as may be seen in Antoninus's Itinerary Another military way passes from this place southwest through Dilston Park over Hexham Fell to Old Town in Alondale and meets with the Maiden Way at Whitley Castle as is set out in Mr Warburton's Map of Northumberland  The Romans were excellent architects and by all the descriptions given of their bridges  Phil Transactions  in Britain testified their geometrical knowledge their arch was semicircular their pillars multangular with a sharp angle to the stream like the prow of a ship The foundations of the piers were constructed of an horizontal arch made of stones in the form of a wedge as appears by the remains here In situations subject  to rapid floods a small arch was formed in the pier to receive the water when it began to reach the bow of the arch  Many Roman Antiques have been found here such as coins seals c but most of them of the lower Empire  Many Seals of Roman work were found at Corchester Greek and Roman Antiques were always of the most exquisite workmanship engravings on gems pebbles and stones of the first order for beauty and luster The beril the chalcedony the emerald hyacinth the topaz or modern chrysolite and the garnet were favourites The chrystal pebble and the amathyst were also esteemed They also used the onyx the sardonyx the agate onyx the jasper the haemachates or bloodstone which they valued for cameos Other kinds were not used by the Romans till the lower Empire when the arts were upon the decline then camelians and stones of an inferior class were introduced Of this order and species are the intaglios found at our Roman Stations The Greek masters excelled the Romans in the art of sculpture and en∣graving who resigned their genius more to oeconomical and political refinements  Wallis  In Mr Horsley's Works we have the following inscriptions and sculptures  No C ImperatoriMarco Aurelio Antonino tribunitiae potestatis  This is in the fore wall of a house in Corbridge on the right hand as you enter the village from the east it has no doubt been a curious inscription and is twice taken notice of in the Philosophical Transactions by Dr Hunter and Dr Todd I do not understand Dr Todd's ac∣count who says  there I saw altars inscribed one Imp M Aurelioanother Leg II Aug Coh IIII  But this and the following stone which he refers to are honorary monuments not altars and neither of the inscriptions are exactly represented as appers from the copies I have given which are taken from the originals This stone is broken both on the left side and at the bottom so that although the inscription belongs to one of the Antoninus's yet whe∣ther to Marcus Aurelius Commodus or Caracalla may be a question  CI Legionis Secundae Augustae Cohors Quarta Fecit  This is in the church wall and no doubt must be the same with that which Dr Todd men∣tions It is of the same sort with those which have frequently been erected by the Legions and legionary Cohorts when they were employed in building any work and I believe usually set in the face of it The O and H are imperfect part of the upper stratum of the stone being gone off  CII  BISI VAL    This inscription is more imperfect than either of the former it is broken at the top and at one end and is now fixed in the corner of a house in the town The letters which remain are very fair but one cannot tell how much is wanting I was told that this stone was found not many years ago and that there were more letters upon it when discovered which were after∣wards broken off by the workmen when they put it into the wall If we suppose the word in the lower line to have been Vallum or Valli and C is in the preceding line to have expressed the number of paces we have still more reason to regret the loss of the rest of it I could not be sure that the last imperfect stroke was the top of an I though the situation of it so high makes it probable The leaf before the word Val does not favour the antiquity of it  CIII The sculpture represented is in the front of an old house The victory is curious and entire being winged with the usual drapery and attitude What she takes hold of seems to have been the ornamental part of a stone on which there has been an inscription The only peculiarity is that she seems to set each foot on a ball or globe  CIV The lesser of these stones is in the jamb of a door and the larger lies at the door of another house in the town The people call this latter a horse I have placed them both under the same number as believing them to be of the same kind The latter appears to be a lion with some other animals under him the head of which is broken off In the other the heads of both animals are gone The lion does not seem to be devouring or destroying the other ani∣mal but rather desending it and I believe it is of the same nature with the sculpture at Wal∣w  ck Grange The larger of these figures is very coarse and much defaced  CV The market cross stands on an altar on which there has been an inscription but now defaced On the sides of the altar are the figures described below They were half covered under the ground or under the steps of the cross but the earth and steps being removed they appeared at full length and are pl  ly two human figures in one hand of each nothing can be discovered One of the figures seemed to be in a posture of motion with a lyre or harp in his hand which made me suspect it might be Bacchus and the other holding a bow unstrung like Apollo unless both may be supposed to represent Apollo There was a faint stroke went up from the end of the bow which possibly may have been the string or an arrow which Apollo he  d together with the bow  We passed the Tyne by a fine bridge of seven arches  DILSTON  next attracted our notice The Mansionhouse is now in ruins Its situation is fine on the brink of a steep hill cloathed with wood de∣scending to the brook of Devil's Water The approach we made was romantic the rivulet at its conflux with the Tyne flows out of a deep dell forming a grand natural cascade after having passed a bridge of a single arch which leads to the mansion through this arch a mill is seen over which are lofty and impending cliffs the whole embowered by trees extending their branches from each side of the dell and spread∣ing out a leafy canopy at least an hundred feet in height shadowing the lower objects with a solemn gloom  We approached the mansion now consisting of disconsolate and ragged ruinsthe hollow halls hanging stairs and painted chambers

them with solemn beauties an inspection of castles and strongholds in ruins gives the traveller pleasure historic facts arising on his mind fraught with images of the tyranny and oppression of feodal powers now extin∣guished he rejoices that the vassalage and cruelty which marked those times are no more he regards such monuments as the broken prisons where tyrants held in chains those whom their avarice and love of rapine characterized with the epithet of enemy He looks upon them as the mementos of days of distress when every man formed his great∣ness by the number of fellowcreatures he could harness to minister to his pride and contribute to his crimes as dens of savages and ani∣mals of prey who like the wolves of the forest held warfare with all the creatures of the earth and worse than wolves employed the powers of rationality to render them more rapacious more cruel and more bloodthirsty than mere animal instinct could insinuate to the heart even cruelty bloodthirstiness and rapacity against their fellowcreatures of which wolves are not accused He looks upon them as monuments of sepultured oppression over which the olives of peace are woven by the hand of liberty He regards them as the hallowed records of all those inestimable jewels which beset the British diadem and enrich the Bri∣tish constitution whose luster strikes the eye of the whole observing world with envy admiration and astonishment  But Dilston gives the observer other sentiments tears arise upon the eye for the crimes of men who in opposition to salutary laws for good effects stamp the law with the character of propriety through mistaken principles imbrue their hands in civil discord It is the mistake in prin∣ciples gives the tears to flow resolute wickedness extinguishes all pity  but humanity feels for man's hallucinations for the errors of judgment for such pity is even divine  Another disagreeable reflection wrestles for a place in the contem∣plative mind on such a viewstrange is the rapacity of men who are ready to take possession of the moment of overthrow and with greedy hands seek to share the spoil even of him for whom once they fought of him whom they had loved had served had fearedtheir pa∣tron protector and friend The lower class of mankind have but few estimates to govern their actions whilst prosperity attends you are served you are beloved you are adored take away that and the wretches return to their original ferocity and each endeavours to gain what he can from the ruins  From Dilston we made a short ride on the banks of Devil's Water where there are many fine sylvan scenes we gained the western emi∣nence above  NUNSBROUGH  where lays the most picturesque though confined landskip the whole county of Northumberland exhibits We ascended to the brink of the precipice near feet high from whence we looked down upon a se∣questered vale almoss insulated by the brook consisting of a fine level plot of corn land of about eight acres in the exact form of a horse∣shoe the brook passing over a rugged rocky bottom under the shadow of lofty hills in various broken streams was seen on each hand foam∣ing from fall to fall which gave a beautiful contrast to the deep hue of the groves From the brook the hills to the left arise precipitous cloathed with a fine hanging wood then glowing with a full sunshine to the right the steeps laying from the sun and in the deep shade were broken and scattered over in wild irregularity with brushwood and here and there a grotesque and knotty tree presented itself impend∣ing from the precipice in front a fine eminence of brown rock lifted its rugged brow and closed the circle dividing the waters with a pro∣montory a few yards wide In the clefts and on the little levels of the rock some shrubs grow on its crown stood ripened corn margined with hedgerow trees through which a cottage was discovered and by its foot a winding road soon escaped the eye in intercepting woods the rays of light fell happily upon the cliffs and brightened their co∣louring To the right and left the more distant brook shewed itself in  deep and rocky dells embowered by lofty oaks To the right hand the hill which surmounts the wood is topped with a plain of grass ground on whose brink stands a farmhold accessable by a narrow path winding up the steep from whence the woods make a beautiful curvi∣ture the distant back ground is composed of heath lands On the left woodlands were seen on the circus winding on the mazy channel of the brook here and there intercepted by heathy eminences the back ground very distant and tinged with a misty azure To grace the little enchanted vale reapers were busy with the harvest in some parts the furrows looked like waving gold in others they were embossed with upset sheafs This is the finest natural theatre I ever saw the circle is almost geometrically just the plain would have suited those exhibitions of which we read with an anxious curiosity in the histories of the An∣cients they would have given it life taken away the rusticity and made it noble When we descended to the vale below it appeared only to want some of the sacred rites to improve its solemnity and com∣pound the idea of hallowedness with greatness One possessed of a true taste for natural beauties is apt to be wound up to a pitch of enthu∣siastic rapture at such scenes as these where every subject that can compose a rural prospect are thus fortunately adjusted and disposed It is not possible for me to write with temperance on such a subject  We again returned to Hexham an agreeable retreat after our little excursions  From the Manuscripts of the late  Roger Gale  Esq  Letter from Mr  Robert Cay  to  Mr Gale  of another Piece of Plate found near Hexham  July  SIR  One

and plainly  "I  SV BAB  WINF  T ADRAT"  On our next ramble we visited  BEAUFRONT  an elegant situation on the north banks of Tyne commanding a beau∣tiful  prospect of Hexham plains I have already given a description of this vale therefore to enlarge upon it though tempted by various points of view where its beauties are differently disposed would be∣come wearisome to the reader it must suffice to add that from Beau∣front the river is seen in several canals and Hexham appears crowning the opposite eminence with singular beauty The house is upon an extensive modern plan but as we had not access to it I cannot say any thing of its convenience or taste  Mr Wallis derives Beaufront from Bellus Locus but for what reason is not shewn This was the seat of the Carnabys so late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth It is now the possession of the family of Erringtons of Errington north of the Roman wall  William de Errington High Sheriff King Edward III  Sir Thomas de Errington one of the

had a view of  LITTLE BAVINGTON  the seat of the Shaftoes in the time of King Edward I in whose family  it has continued since that aera  William Shaftoe King Edward I  William King Edward III

Northumberland obtained a singular victory over the British usurper  Cedwall  or as Camden has his name  Caswallon  King of Cumberland  Cedwell  flushed with his success over  Anfred  King of  Bernicia  whose army he had lately routed and proud of victory approached  Oswald  with contempt who had gathered together a small body of faithful adherents and lay in a fortified camp prepared to oppose the invader  Oswald  beheld the numerous army of his enemies with astonishment when he compared them to the little band on whose arms he must con∣fide He perceived that was his dependance alone on man the fate of his troops was obvious they would be overwhelmed by the num∣bers of his foes The propriety and justice of his cause gave him a degree of fervour which denied dismay and over his hitherto unen∣lightened soul a new spirit of confidence was diffused as he cast up his eyes towards heaven and rejected the idols in whom he had been taught vainly to trust He erected a cross in the front of his army and bending to the earth called upon the name of Christ beseeching his mediation with the Father of all in whose hand alone is the event of battle that he would establish justice on the face of the earth As inspired he arose and called aloud to his troops as Bede writes  Let us all kneel down and beseech the Almighty the living and true  God of his mercy to defend us against this proud and cruel enemy  Bede says  No sign do we find of the christian faith no church no altar through the whole kingdom of Northumberland to have been erected before this noble leader and con∣ductor of an army directed thereto by faithful devotion did raise the ensign of the cross when he was preparing to fight against a savage and bloody enemy When Oswald per∣ceived in his battle the divine aid which he had so earnestly implored he became a professed christian and sent for Alden of Scotland to catechise and instruct his people in the christian religionThe place of victory was called Heavenfield  In Camden we have the following ancient Dystich  Quis fuit Alcydes' quis Caesar Julius aut quis  Magnus Alexander' Alcydes se superasse  Fertur Alexander mundum sed Julius hostem  Se simul Oswaldus mundum vicit hostem  After this prayer he put his little army in battle array his troops be∣ing warmed with that energy which devotion gives and which prompts to intrepid actions  Cedwall  advanced arrogantly confident in his numbers and insolent from his victories assuring himself of venge∣ance on his opposer whom he sought with contempt He attacked the intrenchments and mounted the ramparts in person when a fatal shaft pierced his bosom and laid him in the dust His followers dismayed at the fall of their leader halteda panic seized themtheir swords stayed from assault and as if perplexed by inconsistent commands they began to retire in confusion Oswald perceiving the change took ad∣vantage of the occasion and instantly rushing upon the enemy in a dreadful onset put them to flight the carnage became horrid the number of slain was incredible and those who escaped the sword were totally dispersed It seemed more than the human hand could effect to obtain so compleat a victory had not the interposition of celestial powers confounded Oswald's foes  Oswaldus erat namque filius potentissimi Regis Ethelfridi cujus pater Ethelricus Rex cujus pater Ida Rex a

abovementioned church was built with the  head of St Oswald which was used for a long time by the convent of Durham as their common seal in honour of his memory  There is an engraving of this seal in the appendix to Dr Smith's edition of Bede's Church History  In our way to Chollerton we viewed a place called  HANGING SHAWS  an exploratory mount around whose sides are flights of terraces where the people in arms might at once shew their force to an approaching enemy rank above rank and also advantageously defend themselves upon an assault  From thence we had a view of the village of Halyton and  HALYTON MESNES  the seat of Christopher Soulsby  Esq  This place it is said was stained with the blood of Ethwald King of Northumberland who fell by the treachery of Syga a nobleman of his court  We proceeded by Chollerton having a view of the house of Erring∣ton with the adjoining tower as we passed up the river on one hand and on the other  HAUGHTON CASTLE  situate on the western banks of North Tyne formerly the possession of the Swinburns and Widdringtons  This castle is chiefly dismantled some few apartments only remain∣ing habitable among which is one made in an aperture in the wall whose thickness affords a chamber capable of receiving a bed and some other furniture This has been an extensive fabric immensely strong in its structure but now no otherwise remarkable than for those cir∣cumstances mentioned and the fine grove in which it stands em∣bowered  We passed the modern seat of Mr Riddle  Dukentinus de Riddell  Patricius  Walter  Sir Jurian de Riddell King Edward I  Sir William High Sheriff King Edward II  William  Hugh  Sir William de Riddell of this family who lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth was one of the Lessees in trust for the Corporation of Newcastle upon Tyne of the manors of Gates∣head and Whycam in the bishoprick of Durham worth l per annum by Dr Cradock's computation His seat was the Abbey of St Edmund in Gateshead  Wallis  Sir Thomas of this family was a loyalist in the civil wars of Charles I and so formidable an enemy to the Oliverians that they offered l for his head He narrowly escaped them from Berwick on Tweed  He was great great grandfather of the present Mr Riddle  which arose from the ruins of  SWINBURN CASTLE  an elegant stone building covered with woods Nothing can be more agreeable to the traveller than to observe the improvements of a coun∣try and the advances of cultivation Mr Riddle's house commands an extensive view but it is over an open and illfenced tract He is making rapid progress in the cure of this defect and multitudes of quick fences and plantations are arising which in a few years will extinguish the disagreeable traces of that hostility and devastation which before the union marked this country with the melancholy memorials of war∣fare and in their place give to the eye all the charms of rural opulence  In the reign of King Edward I it was the possession of Peter de Gun∣nerton  Escheat Edward I  as a member of the Barony of Bywell held under the service of two Knights fees In the reign of King Edward II it was the pro∣perty of Adam de Swynburn  Escheat Edward II and th Queen

advanced to  WARK  a small town on the river Tyne which has nothing remarkable but an exploratory mount called the Mote Hill and the ruins of a house of the Ratcliffs It was granted in the reign of King James I to Howard Earl of Suffolk and came by sale to the Earl of Derwentwater and is now part of the possessions appropriated to Greenwich Hospital  We now prepared to leave the beauties of Tynedale the cultivated vale narrowed and we approached to those wild and barren heights  which mark the Highlands of Northumberland with all the characteristics of a Scottish desert As we advanced to Risingham we passed within view of  BELLINGHAM  a town seated on the eastern banks of North Tyne the estate of the ancient family of Bellingham  Robert de Bellingham King Richard II and King Henry IV  Richard King Henry VI  The family arms three hunters horns sable stringed gules  Two parts of the manor belonged to the Archbishop of York as appears by the escheats of King Henry V  whose castle now in ruins is near adjoining to the village At Hareshaw Linn a little way north of Bel∣lingham is a fine waterfall breaking through a rugged channel di∣vided by several rocks the whole tufted with grass and shrubs the land on each hand is lofty and shews many shelving rocks and pro∣jecting cliffs rendered highly picturesque by impending trees which give infinite beauties to the landskip On the opposite side of the river to Bellingham lays  HEZLEYSIDE  on an eminence cloathed with wood the seat of the Charltons  William Charlton  Esq  King Edward VI  William King Charles I  Sir Edward King Charles I  A loyalist and his estate sequestered by parliament in this reign  William Charlton  Esq    Edward the present owner who married Teresa sister to Sir Edward Swinburn of Cap∣heaton Bart  Wllis  com∣manding a view of the town of Bellingham and a mountainous off∣scape varied with verdent sheepwalks rocks and wood  We entered Redesdale which by the Testa de Neville is said to be the dominion of the Umfrevills who held it by the service of repelling thieves and robbers Pleasing prospects were no longer the temptations to our progress we were led only by the love of antiquity  RISINGHAM  was the habitancum of the Romans and lays upon the Watlingstreet It is not mentioned in the Itinerary of Antonine yet must have been a  Roman Station about the time of Aurelius Antoninus by the inscrip∣tions and coins found there It is situate on the banks of Reed and contains within the Vallum three acres three roods and twentysix perches of land It is presumed the Itinerary was composed in the time of Caracalla before which this station might have been deserted Near Risingham was standing some few years ago a milestone with∣out any inscription Dr Hunter communicated a coin found here the reverse struck with the figure of a wolf the legends totally defaced ex∣cept the words Augustus Pius  Horsley  Camden says Risingham implies the Giants habitation It is remark∣able that in the darkness of antiquity we find innumerable traditions of powerful persons and mighty atchievements under the characters of Giants which at this time according to Mr Bryant's most excellent work denote some great temple the character of some powerful people some mighty Ruler or miserable Tyrant Camden relates that the inhabitants in his time had a traditional tale of the God Magon who defended himself here and maintained his fortress against a certain Sol∣dain or Heathen Prince This relation he says is authenticated as to the reality of such a personage as Magon in the ages of antiquity by two Roman inscriptions found in the river there From our utmost endea∣vours we could not trace any remembrance legendary tale or heroic song touching such person as Magon now remaining  The inscriptions given by Camden are as follow  DEO  MOGONTI CAD  ET N DN AVG  M C SECVNDINVS  BF CO HABITA  NCI PRIMASTA  PRO SE ET SVIS POSVIT  Deo Mogonti Cadenorum Numini Domini Nostri Augusti Marcus Caius Secundinus Beneficiarius Consulis Habitanci Primas tam pro se et suis posuitMr Horsley reads the latter part of this inscription "Prima Statione pro se et suis posuit" The altar on which this in∣scription is cut was taken out of the river Reed which runs near this  station He says  this altar Camden justly supposes to have been erected to the topical God  Magon  worshipped by the  Cadeni  or  Gadeni  a neighbouring people of the  Otadini  and to the Deity of the Em∣peror by one  Secundinus  a  Beneficiarius  of the Consul Reading the two last words of the fifth line PRIMASTA for Prima Statione makes the sense natural and easy Risingham is an advanced station beyond the wall and for ought that appears to the contrary might at the time when this altar was erected be the most northerly station of any The name  Secundinus  frequently occurs in  Gruter  DEO  MAVNO CAD  INVENTVS DO  V S  This altar was also taken out of the river Mr Horsley says  ac∣cording to this copy it appears to have been erected to another to∣pical and tutelar God of the  Cadeni  It is a question whether  Mounus  may have been the same with  Matunus  to whom an altar was erected at Elsdon a few miles from this place or perhaps the same Deity is here designed as in the former The third line in the inscription has no doubt contained the name of the person who erected this vo∣tive altar We find the name  Inventus  in  Gruter  I must leave the Roman line and attend to more remote antiquity to define if possible the name of Magon I presume Mr Bryant has thrown such happy lights upon the ancient mythology and has proved his principles by such testimonies that with implicit confidence I may adopt his maxims I shall have several occasions to resort to his work in the progress of my journey through the mountainous part of this county for etymologies of those ancient names which without his di∣rections I should have passed over as incomprehensible and so lost in the mists of antiquity as to remain without solutionAs it is little doubted fireworship was once the accepted religion of this island in∣troduced by eastern visitants and professed and practised by the Druids in these wild and uncultivated parts it is most probable the strongest evidence thereof would remain to this age I find in Mr Bryant's ra∣dicals as he terms them that the word ΩON was one of the titles  of the Sun among the Amonians  Gen chap xli ver Exod chap i ver  and was often in combination with other epithets used by the Syrians Cretans and Canaanites He also therein speaks of the word Macar as a sacred title given by the Amonians to their Deity and was frequently compounded Macaron from whence a people were donominated  Macarones and places were called  Macron The corruption of a name received from the pronunciation of unlettered and ignorant inhabitants who had handed it down traditionally for ages is not to be wondered at from Macron to Magon is a simple and easy corruption From the in∣accuracy of these rude inscriptions as appears in the second even in the name of the invoked Deity it is not to be wondered that G took place of CR or from the obliterations in them through age and time the transcriber might mistake  for G a small letter being frequently introduced in the middle of a word Take Mr Bryant's arguments on traditions of the like nature and the whole relation given by Camden is resolved into an historic factthat the worshippers and priests of  On  who held here their religious rites in the temple of the Sun were a formidable society powerful in their numbers and their learning  That the eastern religion and rites were introduced to this island is certain that the Romans in many instances are known to have adop∣ted the topical Gods they also from an error in etymology gave to persons names which were relative to places and when in Britain they either introduced their own manner of worship or otherwise adopted the British Deities or rather the Amonian titles which they found there and gave them persons as Divinities To prove this I shall quote the inscription before spoken of in the Cottonian collection found at Great Chesters page  Bryant  Sur being a title of the Sun  Syria being deno∣minated from thence is at this day called Souria from Sur and Sehor the Sun That Suria was not merely a provincial title is plain from the Surya Dea being worshipped at Eryx in Sicily and from an inscription to her at Rome  The Romans had an aversion to the Druids who suffered no idols to be set up they took infinite pains to extirpate them and destroy their monuments Here then we find the remainder of Camden's tradition that the priests of On the worshippers of the Sun at Risingham long withstood the Roman arms to pacify the people and incite them to  mix in their worship the Romans erected their Altars on the sacred mount and inscribed them with the Amonian titles  If I may be allowed to make another conjecture that the topical Deities to whom these altars were dedicated prove the worshippers of the  Sun  held here the  Amonian Rites  and that from thence was derived the tradition mentioned by Camden I would presume this latter in∣scription was either incorrectly copied having in the original an A and M mixed thus  or the first letter in the name of the Deity was omit∣ted by the Sculptor or intentionally neglected by the Dedicator as ap∣pears in many other instances and that properly it should have been AMOUNO  Amoun  being a Grecian mode of expressing AMON I have before shewn from Mr  Horsley's  authorities that the Grecian expression is used in many Roman inscriptions yet extant This altar would then appear to be dedicated to  Ammon  the topical Deity of  Risingham  at the time of the accession of the Romans For the sake of impartiality it it is necessary to admit that the dedication to  Ammon  might be from Grecian auxiliaries as  Plutarch  says  that of all the Egyptian names which seemed to have correspondence with the  Zeus  of Greece  Amoun  or  Ammon  was the most peculiar and adequate  And from  Herodotus  we learn that  almost all the names of the Gods in Greece were ad∣ventitious having been brought thither from Egypt  Camden says so much we may gather from these inscriptions as to ascertain the name of the place  Habitancum  and that he who made the first inscription was  Beneficiarius  to a Consul and Primate of the place The  Beneficiarius  was either by promotion or arising from exemption of military service by dispensation they attended the chief officers of the army they seem to have been somewhat like those we now call  Cadets  Horsley  and the  Primaes  as appears by the  Codex Theodosii  were chief magistrates of cities towns or castles Camden leaves us in the dark as to  Magon  not even determining whether he was esteemed the tutelar God of the  Gadeni  whom Ptolomy placed next the  Ottodini  The following Inscriptions found at Chester Hope near Risingham have been communicated to me  D M  AMELIANVS  ANNORVM  X  D  IVLIONA  NI FILIA VIXIT  ANNS XVI M XI  DIXIIII  The following is walled up in a house upon the station and reversed It is cut on a stone about inches square  DOLOCHENO  C IVL PVBL  PIVS TRIB  V S L M  Mr Horsley gives the following reading and remarks upon it  Jovi Optimo Maximo Dolocheno Julius Publius Pius Tribunus votum solvit libens merito  This was published some years ago by Dr Hunter in the Philosophical Transactions I am of opinion it has been the body or plane of an altar having met with several parallel instances where the capital and bases have been struck off from altars in order to fit them for walls or such other uses The appearance of the stone fa∣vours this conjecture and upon this supposition I believe the altar has been inscribed to Jupiter Optimus Maximus Dolochenus and that the letters I O M have either been at the top of the plane and struck off with the capital or else upon the capital itself The word Dolocheno is very plain upon this inscription but in all other in∣scriptions and writers who mention this Deity the name is spelt with an I or Y in the second syllable excepting one which though it be so likewise in  Gruter  yet in  Petrus Apianus  who had published it before it is writ as  Montfaucon  observes with an O in the second syllable like this Possibly the letters PVBL in the second line may not be another name of the person but stand for Publitia the name of the tribe to which this  Caius Julius  belonged This tribe is often mentioned in  Gruter  As to the Divinity Dolochenus I shall have  occasion to quote Mr Horsley very fully on an inscription which occurs at Benwell  Besides the sculptures and inscriptions here noticed in Mr Horsley's work we find the following appertaining to this station  LXXXIV Marti Victori Julius Publius Pius Tribunus votum solvit libens merito  This Mr Horsley says remains at the station though I could not discover it and presume it has been moved since his time There are effigies of Mars and Victory on the capital and an o  s head on the base of the altar Mars has his usual dress and symbols a shield in his left hand and a spear in his right The Victory in her usual drapery holds a globe in her right hand and a palm branch in her left The figures and inscription Marti Victori explain and illustrate each other  LXXXVI Militum cui praeest Marcus Peregrinus Superstes Tribunus  The original I found placed for a seat at the back door of a house at Chesterhope The first word may have been Militum and the other letter a C in CVI and as the Cohors Prima Tungtorum has Militum annexed I once suspected that this altar rather belonged to the Tun∣grian than the Vangiones from the inscriptions at the Housesteads in one of which we also meet with the name Superstis The altar is of a hard reddish stone but finer than usual  LXXXIX Cui praeest Nonnuis Aurelius Castus Vetustate Conlabium  This seems to be the broken inscription given in Camden and before mentioned It is very evident it was erected on the repairing or rebuilding some public edifice that through age had gone to ruin for so much does the usual expression Vetustate Conlabsum imply Aurelius Castus seems to have been the name of the Praesect but what Cohort he commanded that was im∣ployed in this work is not to be known by the inscription I can imagine no resemblance be∣tween the first letters in the inscription and those in Gallorum or Vangionum and yet there is no evidence from any inscription of any other Cohort being there The N in the word Con∣labsum is silent as it often is in the middle of a word before another consonant and so is frequently omitted by the workmen who usually wrote as they were accustomed to pronounce  XCI Dis Manibusv  it annis  Of which little more can be known than that it has been sepulchral  XCII There is nothing more worth our notice within the station but the following sculp∣ture Three human figures are on one side and a man holding a horse on the other side of the same stone which is of a cu  ical form these figures are much effaced The man who holds the horse on his left hand appears to be in somewhat like an Armenian dress with a hasta in his other hand Two of the other figures are leaning upon pillars one of which has a staff in his right hand with two serpents twisted about it the symbol of  Esculapius  whose image I take it to be And the short figure which stands next exactly agrees to  Telesphorus  the God of Recovery who is always represented in this manner with a cloak covering both his arms and is often placed between  Esculapius  and his daughter  Hygicia  and sometimes standing by  Esculapius  alone in both cases he appears like a boy He stands with  Esculapius  alone in a medal of  Caraca  la  and between him and  H  gieia  in the medals of  Lucius Verus  and  Philip  the younger as also in a sculpture of Montfaucon The God and Goddess of Physick and Health and the God of Recovery are proper companions one of another The third figure here may be  Hygieta  with the cal  thus about her head the drapery is very doubtful and the serpent her usual symbol does not appear in which the sculpture agrees with that of Montfaucon A man holding a horse may be an emblem of victory peace or security In a medal of  Commodus  with  Fortunae mane  ts  on the reverse  Fortune  sits holding a horse by the bridle There is so great a resemblace between this fourth figure and that of  Castor  upon some coins that it has created an opinion in me that it may have been intended for  Castor  or  Geta  under that figure holding his  lla  us  in his hand If the habit be set aside which is very obscure how ex∣actly does th  s answer to  Vise  as  's account of a coin of  Getas  where he is represented in the fi∣gure of  Castor  in a military dress holding a spear in his left hand and leading a horse by the bridle with his right The figure here indeed holds the spear in his right hand and the horse in his left but that is no material difference  Castor  is usually distinguished from his brother by a horse according to Horace  Castor gaudet equis ovo prognatus eodem  Pugnis  But  Montfaucon  has given us a sculpture of Castor and Pollux together each holding a horse and a spear  Two inscriptions in Mr Warburton's Map of Northumberland whose originals I could not find are thus represented  FORTVNA  AVG  AEL  PROCVLIN  V S  Fortunae  Augusti  Aelius  Proculinus  Votum solvit  I suppose this has been an altar The E at the end of the first line I fancy has been overlooked The copy of the other is more confused and unintelligible All we can ascertain is it has been dedicated Marti Victori  MARTI  VICTOR  RRON  AVEINV  TRIB AV  About half a mile north from Risingham close by Watlingstreet lies an altar much of the same size and shape with that at Risingham which stands in the gate of the station It has a Praefericulum and Patera on one side and a garland on the other There has no doubt been an inscription upon it though now not the least sign of a letter appears I think this cannot well be the same altar which with the inscription upon it Dr Hunter has described in the Phi∣losophical Transactions for the Doctor says he found that near Riechester The inscription the Doctor has given us runs thus  D M  C IVL FL  INGEN    MILEG  VIV F  Dis Manibus  Caius Julius Florus or Flavia Triba  Ingenuus    Miles Legionis  Sextae Victricis Piae Fidelis  According to some there is another instance of four names for the same person and where Caius Julius make two of them Though Mr Ward there also chooses to refer one of the names rather to the tribe  In Camden we find the following inscriptions  AVR ANTONI  NI PII AVG M  MESSORIVS  DILIGENS TRI  BVNVS SACRVM  Mr Horsley's reading and remarks on this inscription are as follow  Aurelii Antonini Pii Augusti Marcus Messorius Diligens Tribunus sacrum  The original was removed by Sir Robert Cotton for it still continues at Con  gton the upper part has been broken off and the first line now remaining is partly covered by being built up in the wall of the summerhouse the rest is yet very plain There is no doubt but  Pro Salutae Imperatoris M  has gone before and perhaps the altar has been to  Jupiter Optimus Maximus  or to Jupiter and the  Numina Augusti  It is not easy to determine to which of the Antonines this inscription belongs If this station was in ruins as some think in the reign of  Caracalla  the supposed author of the Itinerary then the inscription could not be to him besides the titles  Felix  c are usually added to him and in our British inscriptions he is often joined with  Severus  after whose death he immediately left the island  M Aurelius Antoninus  called  Philosophus  had wars here and his Legate  Calpurnius Agricola  is named in an inscription or two in these parts and I am apt to think that both this inscription and some others in the north belong to that Emperor  NVMINIB  AVGVSTOR  COH IIII GAL  EQ  FEC  Of this Mr Horsley gives the following reading and remarks  Numi∣nibus Angustorum Cohors Quarta Gallorum Equitum fecit  The original of this is also at Conington and placed above the summerhouse door The sculpture has suffered by the weather but the inscription is still very legible The Emperors in honour of whom it has been erected I take to be  Severus and Caracalla  who were much hereabout and I believe were possessed of this very station This Cohort seems to have been like a flying squadron for by inscriptions we find them in several places The inscription is included in a kind of  corona  or rather an octagon circumscribed by a square moulding There are ornaments of eagles heads on each side above which is the appear∣ance of two faces probably designed for those of the Emperors re∣ferred to by the inscription Mars and Victory in their usual dress and appearance are set in a nich one at each end of the stone The other ornaments seem only to be such as pleased the fancy of the Sculp∣tor The Victory treads on a globe and no doubt the general mean∣ing is that the Emperors had warred successfully and gained a vic∣tory over the whole world  DEAE TER  TIANAE SA  CRVM AEL  TIMOTHEA P  V S LL M  Of this inscription Mr Horsley gives the following reading and remarks  Camden has given us the name of another topical Goddess in an in∣scription the original of which is lost namely  Tertiana  which a learned friend conjectured to be the  Tertian Ague  and it is well known the Goddess  Febris  was worshipped among the Romans  DEO INVICTO  HERCVLI SACR  LAE  L SALV  NVS  TR  COH I VANGI  V S P M  On this inscription Mr Horsley gives the following reading and remarks  Deo invicto Herculi sacrum Lucius Aemilius Salvianus Tribunus Cohortis Primae Vaugionum votum solvens posuit merito  The  Cohors Prima Vau∣gionum  a people of  Gallia Belgica  on the Rhine seem to have been in garrison here the latest and longest though neither this Station nor Cohort are mentioned in the  Notitia  A Tribune of this Cohort is mentioned in a funeral inscription at Walwick Chesters This is a very stately altar erected to the invincible  Hercules  it remains yet at Conington very entire and is I think one of the largest altars I have seen that are so beautiful On one side is an ox in  basso relievo  on the other an ornament not unlike a curtain for I could not say it was a festoon and it is rather too large for a priest's veil I imagined it to represent the  aulaeum  that separated the  adytum  or some such thing  COH  VANG  FECIT CVRANTE  IVL PAVLLO TRIB  Mr Horsley's reading and remarks on the above are  Cohors Prima Vaugionum fecit curante Julio Paullo Tribuno  The original is also at Conington  Paullus  is here with a double LL and the F in  fecit  looks like the lower Empire  HERCV  LI IVL  PAVLLVS  TRIB  VS  Mr Horsley's reading and remarks on this are  Herculi Julius Paullus Tribunus votum solvit  This altar stands instead of a gatepost in the side of what was once the south gate of the station but is now used as a gate for the field When I was informed of this altar I was told that a great many more letters were formerly visible upon it It has been a fine altar but is now turned upsidedown so that the capital was hid in the ground It is not improbable that the inscriptions and altars dedicated to  Hercules  have been designed as a compliment to the Emperor  Commodus  who as it is well known was called  Her∣cules Romanus  Besides this  Julius Paullus  I find three other  Tribunes  who commanded this Cohort of the  Vangiones  D M  BLESCIVS  DIOVICVS  FILIE  SVE  VIXIT  AN I ET  DIES XXI  Mr Horsley says  this inscription has in its manner so much the

This station was certainly gone to decay before the reign of  Caracalla  and afterwards was restored and this opinion is favoured by the last  imperfect inscription found at this place from whence it appears that somewhat had been repaired which had gone to ruin through age  The remarkable effigy of  Robin of Risingham  as it is called by the country people next claims my attention I will in the first place give Mr Horsley's description and then offer some few remarks of my own  The remarkable figure which usually goes by the name of  Robin of Risinghom  or  Robin of Redsdale  is cut upon the face of a huge piece of rock that has fallen off from the main one It is on the side of a hill or rock near the park head and about half a mile from the sta∣tion at Risingham The image is in  basso relievo  and both the sculp∣ture and stone very coarse I take it by the drapery and symbols to be certainly Roman though some from the rudeness of the sculp∣ture have thought it British and probably it is the Emperor  Commo∣dus  represented under the figure of  Hercules  The square stone beside him must I suppose be an altar and what he carries in his left arm a club on his left shoulder are distinctly seen a quiver and arrows and in his right hand a bow which agree with the character given him by  Herodian  who celebrates him as a most excellent archer What he wears on his head looks like a helmet Every body knows that  Commodus  affected to be called the  Roman Hercules  and to be wor∣shipped as such We have his coins with  Herculi Romano Augusto Herculi Romano Conditori  c This figure then might represent the Roman  Hercules  triumphant and victorious after things had been set∣tled in Britain by  Pertinax  and  Commodus  assumed the name of  Brit∣tanicus  The face of the whole piece of rock on which the image is cut is an irregular figure of five sides the side which rests in the ground is six feet and an half the perpendicular from the  vertex  to this side eight feet the two sides to the right of this perpendicular each of them five feet the uppermost side to the left seven and the lower four and the stone is just about six feet thick The figure stands upright  The doubts which I entertain that this is Roman work are founded upon the following circumstances The vest in which the figure is ha∣bited is open from the waist to the knee round the waist is a belt buckled before the loose garment on the shoulders leaving the right arm bare and at liberty is put on in the manner of the Scotch plaid the cap is not similar to any one I remember to have seen in Roman sculptures the bow is in the right hand But that the reader may pass his own judgment upon this sculpture I have given an etching of it  If we descend to modern times we will find several personages dis∣tinguished by the name of Robin of Redesdale One of the Umfranviles had that appellation and in the time of Edward the Fourth we find one Hilliard of the Lancastrian party thus denominated  From Ban∣bury the northern men under the conduct of Robbin of Riddesdale  Hist England A D  hastened to the manor of Grafton where the Queen's father then lay whom with his son John they

North Tyne I did not view the place the description together with a  drawing was communicated to me by my friend at Newcastle It stands within the Lordship of Tarset and has the name of Tarset Castle Camden says it was a castle of the Comins The area is of an oblong square in length about yards defended by a deep foss near yards in breadth on the north west and south sides the east laying on a

to engage in the labyrinths and wilds of such a country  ELSDEN  is a small town of antiquity supposed to have its date from the time of M Aurelius Antoninus two Roman altars were found inscribed to that Emperor in a hill called the Mote Hill  Mr Horsley gives us the following inscriptions found here  BONOGENERIS  HVMAN IMPE  RANTE CALPVR  NIO AGRICOLA  AVG PR PR POSVIT  AC DEDICAVIT  C A ACILIVS  This was removed to Durham where it now is It is very curious and the remark is just which the ingenious Dr Harle made when the altar was first dug up that the lines which are wanting had been evidently struck out with a tool which is usually observed to have been practised on revolutions in the Empire or upon the persons falling into disgrace who is men∣tioned in the inscription This particularly is thought to have been done with relation to  Geta  by the order of his brother  Caracalla  in some other inscriptions in Britain though I cannot think that the name of  Geta  has been upon this altar for this neither agrees with the letter C yet very plain and visible nor with the sequel of the inscription which is very clear and distinct  Bono generis Humani Imperante Calparato Agric  la Legato Augustali Propraetore posuit ac dedicavit C  ius A  l  s Acilius  The first words in the filth line are undoubtedly  Augustali Propraetore  which makes it certain that  Legato  and the name of the Lieutenant have gone before ac∣cording to the usual form If we suppose  Calparuius Agricola  to be the name that has been designedly erased I believe that as the letters will exactly fill up the empty space so that sup∣ply will suit very well both with what goes before and what follows  Imperante Calpurnio Agricola  I take to be the same with  s  Calpurnio Agricola  or perhaps  fussu Calpurnii Agricola  which so frequently occurs in such sort of subscriptions There is some difficulty in forming a notion of the meaning of an altar erected  Bono generis humani  but this may seem as intelligible as an altar erected  Bono sato Bono event  i  c and perhaps has much the same meaning There are coins with  Salus Generis humani  upon them If the conjecture concerning  Calpurnius Agri∣cola  be admitted it will then follow that this inscription belongs to the time of  M Aurelius Antoninus  whose Legate this  Agricola  was and consequently that the Romans were in his time possessed of this station  Having given my own sentiments of this inscription I must acknowledge that a different conjecture has occurred which several of my friends incline to prefer and that is that the following fragment and this may have been originally but one stone and that the whole in∣scription has run thus  DEO MATVNO  PRO SALVT ET    BONO GENERIS  HVMAN IMPE  RANTE GETA AVG  SVB LEG

do not think it probable upon reviewing them that both the fragments have been parts of the same stone  We have here the local Deity  Matunus  concerning whom I can learn nothing more than his name

when the stones were removed they discovered at the bottom a large stone rough and undressed la  d upon the ground in form of a gravestone with smaller stones wedged in between it and the ground wherever there were any interstices When this was taken off there appeared  the ground a cavity in form of a grave about two yards long and four feet broad at the top about a foot and a half deep was some very fine mould next to that some ashes  aid in fine white sand the sand was above two feet thick the whole depth of the cavity or grave being near four feet There were mixt with ashes what they took for small pieces of burnt bones very black but no entire bones There were several pieces of burnt wood like charcoal I have not yet seen the place myself but I have this account from an

invade the borders in the th year of that reign with about men under the command of Sir William Douglas by some authors stiled Earl Douglas They were attacked in their camp on the th of August by a body of English forces commanded by the Earl of Northumberland and his two sons Henry Percy and Ralph Percy young men of martial spirit at Otterburn  R  path's B  rder History▪ "An army almost thrice as numerous as that of the Scots" I know not by what authority this is asserted  The armies engaged by moon light a season when battle would have redoubled horrors especially where the conflict was hand to hand when each combatant met his opponent in trial of skill and strength this mode of fighting must render the business and confusion of the conflict dreadful beyond description Douglas ambitious of laurels and desiring some distinguished atchievement sought for young Henry  Percy who for his intrepidity and martial prowess was surnamed Hotspur He met him in the hottest of the battle insolently braved the young hero to engage and Douglas fell beneath his valorous sword The ru∣mour of their leader's overthrow ran through the Scottish lines they were intimidated and began to fly but at the instant the panic was becoming general and the English were advancing in hopes of victory the Earl of Dunbar came up with a large reinforcement and the Scots rallied Now overpowered by numbers and faint with the fatigues and bloodshed of the fight the English gave way and the invaders were victorious yet so powerfully and with such gallant resolution did the English maintain the battle against superior force that the loss on each side was said to be nearly equal The English left dead upon the field Among the prisoners were Lord Percy and his brother Sir Robert Heron Sir Robert Ogle Sir John Lilburn Sir John Colwell and many other valiant men of Northumberland  A circumstance attended this day as unfortunate to the Northum∣brians as shameful to their allies the Durham militia was approach∣ing but did not come up in time to support the English before they had left the field to the victors the Scottish leader not willing to hazard any more of his troops thought it expedient to use stratagem and ac∣cordingly assailed the reinforcement in a mode totally new and hap∣pily prevalent he caused all his soldiers to blow the horns which were used to sound an alarm the stilness of the night the echo from the hills and the terrors which the overthrow of the Northumbrians had impressed upon their minds wrought so powerfully that the militia were seized with a panic and put to flight without seeing an enemy vanquished solely by the tremendous idea of thousands approaching flushed with success  Replete with melancholy reflections arising from such a scene and retrospection

public place preeminence and distinction Then it was I took as it were the other hand into consideration a review of the modes of the world and thence proceeded to compare my determined principles

Hispanorum Eq  I think we have not met with any for∣mer instances of the title  Aelia  ascribed to this Cohort Mr Horsley page conjectures that the  Cohoris Prima Hispanorum Equit  might be part of the  Ala Herculea  but I believe Sir if he had met with this inscription he would have thought otherwise In the  Notitia  as he ob∣serves p we do not meet with the expression  Cohors Equitum  but as in many parts of that book the place of the officer's residence seems chiefly to be intended I know not whether we ought always to suppose that the whole body under his command was in the same place there∣fore I am more surprized that we never meet with  Tribunus Coh Equitum  Among the stations  per lineam V  li  there is none said to be commanded by a  Praefectus Alae  which appears to have been much larger than some of those where  Tribunes of Cohorts  are placed and I know no instance of a Commander of an  Ala  stiled  Tribunus  I would therefore suppose that an  Equ  strian Cohort  consisted of  two Alae  though it might not be very common to mention them as  Cohorts  and perhaps the  Ala Prima Herculea  and the  Ala Vettonum  might compose this  Co∣hort  Sir  yours c ROBERT CAY  An Answer to the preceding Letter by  Mr Gale  London  th December  Mr Horsley's  reason for supposing the  Cohors Prima Hispanorum  to have been part of the  Ala Herculea  is their being quartered nearly together the first at  Elenborough  and the other at  Old Carlisle  as appears by inscriptions found at those places  I believe this Cohort arrived in Britain with the  Emperor Hadrian  and continued there till the  Romans  quitted the  island  and in a series of about years it must have made several marches and counter marches from one camp to another My reason for thinking it came hither with that Emperor is from its appellation  Aelia  and its country  Spain  the latter of which might prevail with him who was a Spaniard by birth to dignify it with one of his own names and when he transported the  Legio VI Victrix  into  Britain  he might bring this  Cohort  among the  Auxiliaries  that were joined to it this also inclines me to think it was part of one of the  Alae  belonging to that Legion which seems always to have been employed in the North and to have had its head quarters at  York  The legionary  Alae  consisted of several Cohorts of foreign Auxiliaries though of how many is uncertain sometimes we are told they were equal in numbers of men to the  Legion  and sometimes that they exceeded it it is therefore probable that both the  Alae  of a Legion might contain  ten Cohorts  the number of those that constituted a  Legion  when compleat  I cannot therefore agree that the  Cohors Prima Hispanorum  was composed of two  Alae  the  •    Herculea  and the  Ala Vettonum  since  Alae  were formed of  Cohorts  and not  Cohorts of Alae  Ala  also imported a large independent body of horse and of this sort seems to have been the  Ala Vettonum  and the  Ala Prima Asturum  the  Ala Sarmatarum  c all which carry the the names of the countries they originally came from  The  Legio VI Victrix  was in  Britain  when the  Notitia Imperii  was compiled as were all those  Ala  it is not therefore unlikely that the  Ala I Herculea  and the  Ala Sabiniana  were the wings properly appertaining to it one so called from the Emperor  Maximianus Herculeus  the other retaining the name of the Empress  Sabina  or  Sabinia  either the wife of the Emperor  Hadrian  that brought this Legion into  Britain  or of the Emperor  Gordian the Third  who ho∣noured the other wing of it with his own name which is most probable because from the name  Sabina  the appellative adjective  Sabinia  would be properly formed and from the name  Sabinia  wh  Empress as appears from her medals the true formation of the adjective thou  e  Sa  mara  When the  titia  as it now stands was wrote the  Legio Secunda Augusta  was withdrawn from  Wales its long and ancient quarters to  Richburrough  in  K  nt  and the  A  iane  that composed the wings of it were in all probability the forces that garrisoned the stations upon that coast against the  Saxons  as the wings of the Vlth  The horse of a Legion was in the  A  ae  the body  so that the wings were the properest to  the country  whi  the main body lay in    defended the northen borders against the  Scots  and  ts  while the main body of that Legion lay in its head quarters at  York  The  Britons  when the  Romans  abandoned this island and for many years before were entirely friends with them united in the same interest and almost the same people so that they had no occasion to keep any troops upon the borders of Wales but rather to withdraw them  ad lineam Va  i  to defend their friends and confederates against the  Barbarians  on that side and to the  on the other to protect them from the depredations of those  for a  that time they were no more It is very strange I must own that no  have been found in any of these eastern and southern station and so many of them in the northern I can impute it only to the long residence of the Roman forces in the north with many  peace and  ase which gave them leisure to erect  temple altars  and  glandeur there and to a short stay upon the Saxon coast in coast in continual a  arms that gave them time to think of nothing but the defence of themselves and country and all the remain of their  fications and castles in th  se parts speak them to have been of the lowest Empire  Upon this occasion give me leave to observe that the  Notitia Imperit  has given you the state of the Roman government and forces in Britain not as they really were when that ac∣count of them is supposed have been compiled at the latter end of  Tho  s the Second's  reign about the year but as they stood in the year or when the aforesaid Le∣gions were  t  it is evident they had been recalled before that time When the  Legis Secu  da  g  ta  left  not so  but I think we may safely determine that the  Legio VI V  forsook us when  St  drew together all the forces of the Empire to his assistance against  Alari  the  which was about the year from the following verses of the poet  Gla    Ve  a  extremis Legio praetenta Britannis  Qur Sente dat fraena T  uci ferro notatas  Pe  eras res picta moriente figuras  Which is such a defer  of this Le  n and its employment that I think it puts what I have conjectured upon its departure out of doubt As we have no mention at that time of the second Legion nor afterwards it was probably reca  ed before the sixth so that what the  N  titia  gives us of the Romans in Britain seems to be copied from an account taken at a time when they had a flourishing civil power and a good army residing here and not to relate to the latter end of  T  dosius the Second  a time of the utmost confusion and disorder when they were not able to defend their own  and their  Ro  a Eterna  against the ravages of the  Goth  But to return The Commanders of both sorts of  alae  were  led  Praefecti  the same title as Commanders of Legions were honoured with and to be a  Praefectus Alae  more interest was made than to be a  Praefectus Legionis  as being more profitable and sooner attained by rising quarter t  t through the several degrees of military promotion But the proper title belonging to the Commander of a  Co  ort  seems to have been  Tribanus  the  Notitia Imperis  constantly  l  ng them so though that title is not always observed in the inscriptions where we find fre∣quently  The true name was probably  Tribunus  and  Praesectus  as a title of a greater dignity only a compliment to the officer as we call all our Lieutenants and Ensigns at this time Captains  Cohors  was properly a company of foot

Centur X c Vide Hyginum de Ca∣stramet et schelii Commen∣taria in Io X  o  Thes Rom Antiq Graevii  like the Cap∣tain of a Cohort  Vegettus  a late author and who lived a little be∣fore the Notitia was compiled tells us that the  first Cohort  of a Legion was called  Milliaria  that it consisted of foot soldiers and horse that the other  Cohorts  had only foot and horse that the Commander of the  first Cohort  had the title of  Tribunus  and that those of the other Cohorts were stiled either  Tribuni  or  Praepositi  at the Em∣peror's pleasure Other authors differ as to the number of men in a Cohort and I never met with a  Praepositus Cohortis  in any book else or inscription perhaps it was a late distinction and but just brought into fashion when Vegetius wrote  However in imitation of the  first legionary Cohort  it is not improbable that the  first aux∣iliary Cohort  consisted likewise of above men and the rest of more than the th and th it is said were above whence they were called  Quingenariae  as the first was  Mil∣liarta▪  and I think the inscription you sent is a strong proof of this conjecture the note ∞ there being the character of in number and consequently the last words of it are to be read  Tribunus Cohort  s Primae Aeliae Hispanorum Milliariae Equitatae  and not  Equestris  or  Equitum  as used by  Pliny  and other polite writers  Equitata  being the camp word and not denoting a  Co∣hort  consisting entirely of horse but a  Cohort  formed partly of foot and partly of horse as is evident from  Hyginas de castrametatione  who wrote expresly upon that subject and in the mi∣litary style  Sir  yours c ROGER GALE  Extract of a Letter from  Sir John Clerk  to  R Gale  Esq  Edinburgh  th October  I know very well that the first Cohort of a Legion used some times to be called Milliaria for so Rosinus and Vegetius and before them Modestus had taught me I know it consisted both of horse and foot but I thought it a tautology to add after prima Cohors these letters  EQ wherefore I imagined that there was more intended viz directly to signify that the whole Cohors consisted of horse in number or that there was belonging to the Cohors horse who were quartered at Netherby but what was of greater weight with me was that I believed that in the latter times of the Roman Empire there were Cohorts entirely of horse Pliny in the tenth book of his Epistles and I think the th Epistle furnished me with a direct proof of this for he expresly mentions the Sexta Cohors Equestris There was another proof occurred to me from the th chapter of Suetonius in Vita Claudii where Co∣ho  s is mentioned inter Equestres Milites In the main I thought it would do as well to read the letters  EQ Mille Equitum as to call the Cohort Prima Milliaria I pleased my∣self also with the fancy that if the old Lipsius had seen this altar he had acquiesced in the above cited words of Suetonius and not have read them Semestres Militias Some of your editions of that author will direct you to a squabble amongst the Critics upon the reading of those words which in my apprehension this very altar at Netherby may decide but be the reading what it will it pleases me to think that there were Spanish horse amongst us in former times which perhaps contributed not a little to that breed of horses which is in those parts to this day I believe the Jock  es will not approve of this conjecture we generally attribute our breed of galloways to Spanish horses though we carry their origin no farther back than the Spanish invasion in and the ships which were cast away on our coasts but this is an epi∣sode I can easily pass by  I have only now to add a conjecture of mine as to the apparent streets in the town of Ne∣therby viz that they were stables for horses and of this very kind there are several in the station at Middleby nothing was fitter than horse to defend them against my old countrymen the Fugaces Caledonii  I am c J CLERK  Extract of a

you'll be found a true one even in this I have been at the expence of bringing the altar to  Morpetò  on which the inscription is to which I refer this has given me in opportunity of setting the one broken piece of it on the other and examining the whole Inscription with the greatest nicety and care by this means I have discovered the re∣mains of a letter or two which had escaped me before and now I read it  Jovi Optimo Maximo Vexil  at  C  tio  perhaps Primae  Vardulorum Equitum  or Equestris  votum solvit libentissime merito  this reading which seems to lye pretty much out of the way I have found out by the help of another lucky discovery I mean a stone found not long ago at  Riechester  which I have also got into my own poss  ssion a draught of which and the fair and beautiful inscription upon it I have sent you inclosed as also a copy of that at  Lanchester  I suppose  S  t  at the end of the find line to be  Socio  and to mean the same as  Comiti  The three last lines I read  Tribu  s Colortis Primae Vardulorum cum Commilitonibus Crancis Votum Deo Templum a S  l  extractum  The remains at the end of the th line will suit an  n  as well as an  m  which made me also think of  Contabernalibus  or some such thing The  Varduli Cranei  though this latter name be usually wrote with a  G  at the beginning are two neighbouring peo∣ple in  Spain  The form of the expression in the  Lanchester  inscription I suppose to be parallel to the  Biturix C  s  in one at  York  I see no reason why  Varduli Cranei  may not pass as cur∣rent as  Cubi Bitur  ges  which we have both in  Pliny  and the aforesaid inscription I think  Tem∣plam  or  Temple  and  Sol  t  or some such words are most likely to be those which are wanting at the end of the two last lines  I am Sir  urs c JOHN HORSLEY  An Answer to the preceding Letter by  Roger Gale  Esq  SIR  st December  A letter from you is always extremely acceptable since it never fails of bringing its enter∣tainment along with it I never pretended  Ex Tripode loqui  and if I should my responses would have no more weight than those of the oracles always dubious oftener false than true I am much afraid what you charge me with in your last will come out wrong though your conjectures are very ingenious As you have communicated them to me I doubt not but you will give me leave freely to send you my thoughts upon them  As for the O M they can have been nothing but the remains of  Jovi Optimo Maximo  and perhaps what follows is the remains of  Vexillatio  though I am not without my scruples as to that In the first place I do not remember I ever met with such an inscription as  Vexillatio Cohortis  or  Cohortium  though frequently with  Vexillatio Legionis  which I take to imply a de∣tachment sent off from the Legion under a  Vexillum  where we meet with those  Vexillationes Leg  II VI XX upon the wall in  Scotland  Secondly  Vexillatio Equitum  is generally taken for  Cohors Equitum  but as there might be a detachment from a  Cohors  upon occasion as well as from a  Legion  I will not insist upon that  Vardulorum  is very plain upon this altar though a name hitherto unknown in  Britain  I wish the  Cran  orum  was as much out of dispute for though the  Or  that follow  Vardul  are the initials of that word yet I cannot think they belong to  Vardulorum  as you read them because we find but one nation of the  Varduli  in  Spain  and consequently no occasion of the additional  Cranei  to distinguish them from any of their neighbours that might have the same appellation  Pomponius Mela  expresly says the  Varduli Gens Una  in  France  were two nations of the  Bituriges  the one therefore was called the  Bituriges Cubi  the other the  Bituriges Vi  isci  As for the  Cranei  upon  the  Riechester  ne  I shall shew you by and by that it is quite another thing to this I am ob∣liged to add that I cannot find among my old Geographers such a people as the  Cranei  or  Granei  in  Spain  or any where else therefore should be glad to know where you met with them  In the  Riechester  Inscription which is indeed very beautiful the word  Soc  in the first line is certainly  pro  ecio Gruter  p XXII gives us an inscription DIM et  Soli Socio  which is read  Deo In  to Mat  rae et Soli Socio  the compliment is paid to the Emperor in yours by giving him the Sua for his companion as that associates him with the God  Mithras  and is he appears upon the medals of  Constantine the Great  and others with the legend of  S  li Invicto Co∣mit    There is no further difficulty in it till we come to the sixth line where the  Cohors Prima Vardu  rum  shews  beyond exception the  Cum Con  I read with the beginning of the seventh line  C  m Cons    a word not very common but you have it in  Julius Capi  linus's  Life of  Gora    ch    Sacrati Co  nes im etiam  Con  ecra  c  that is  jusdem Sacra∣ment  M  tar Parti  e  than which nothing can be more apposite and leaves no room for the  Cranes  The re  t I take to have been V DE SVO the fragment after the letter E seem∣ing to be rather the top of an S than the side of an O besides which the repetition of  Deo  the first word in the inscription would have been an unnecessary tautology or as the letter  De suo  are not enough to fill up the remainder of the line they may have been  de sua imp  n    or  de sua pec de sua impe  ta  or  de sua pecuma  both of which do frequently occur in inscriptions Or it the reliques of the last letter are part of a C it may have been DEC PVBL  Decreto Publico  and what is lost in the last line EXTRVCTVM DE DIC  E  tructum De  t  and nothing less than a  Temple  built that had been vowed for the health and safety of the  Emperor  I enquired the other day of  Mr Ward  after your  Britannia

victimas  Edemque votitam mene  nto  No  humilem seriemus agnam  I ask pardon for haste and confusion and am Sir c JOHN HORSLEY  Answer to the same by  Mr Gale  SIR  London  th January  The  a  were a small people situated at the mouth of the river  Minius  now called  M  in  Spain  upon the great western ocean at least miles from the confines of the  Var∣duli  now the province of  Cu  puscea  in the bottom of the  Bay of Biscay  in the very eastern  parts of  Spain  with several nations interjacent so that they cannot be said to be people not far distan one from the other and I never imagined they were your  Cranei  till the receipt of your last letter These  Cranei  never have as yet occurred in any inscription more than my  Conse∣crani    but that is warranted by  Julius Capitolinus  a good author and by a just and proper signification of the word concurring I believe you cannot produce any phrase in author or inscription▪ parallel to  Tribunus Cohortis I Vardulorum cum Commilitonibus Craneis suis  allow∣ing even  Cranei  to have been the name of a people whereas the other reading is plain and easy and though  Julius Capitolinus  lived after the age of this inscription several years that is no proof that the word  Consecran  i  was not in use before he wrote it was a  military expression  and little used perhaps out of the  camp  I hope you will pardon the freedom that has been extorted from me by a conviction of my being in the right as to this criticism and am  Sir c R GALE  Mr Horsley  to  Roger Gale  Esq  SIR  Morpeth  d January      My absence from home was longer than I designed and since my return have been pre∣vented examining originals till this morning this has occasioned a delay of the fuller answer I intended and promised I received the  Riechester  inscription just before the press came to the other inscriptions belonging to the same place and having no great fondness for an appendix I immediately dispatched to London some short observations on it in order to their being printed and inserted in their proper place so that before I received your first letter it was too late to make any alteration there however I must beg leave to take notice of your conjecture either in the preface or some other proper place  Mr Ward  intends a letter to me by way of review of all the observations and there is a proper space left for that letter in order to its being in∣serted at the end of the observations on the second Book of the  Bri∣tannia Romana  This letter will be instead of an appendix  There is no notice taken of this in Mr Ward's letter but Mr Horsley in all proba∣bility reprinted his observa∣tions on this inscription See his Brit Rom p  R G  and any new discoveries and thoughts will I believe be there inserted I shall communicate yours to him on this occasion unless you rather chuse to speak to him yourself though I have not wholly abandoned my first conjecture yet I have a good opinion of yours and no doubt considering how natural it is to have a partial regard for our own offspring yours will have the preference much more in the esteem of others  I have carefully and impartially examined all the letters on the stone and am convinced that the last visible though imperfect letter in the th line has been an N which favours your opinion I have with my compasses compared the breadth of this letter with that of all the M's and N's on the stone and find that it agrees pretty well with the stated or usual breadth of the N but always falls sensibly short of the breadth of the M This ought to have been re∣garded in the copy though whether it be or not with sufficient accuracy is more than I am sure of The addition of SE at the end of the line would bring it to an equal length with most of the rest nor have I in this review observed any thing on the stone which is in the least unfavourable to your opinion On the whole I strongly incline to think you must be in the right and that my own conjecture must have the honour to be overthrown by so good a hand as your own and the  Lanchester  inscription reduced to its primitive state of confusion and darkness  The remains of the letter at the end of the last line but one may be those of a C but are likest those of an O the shape and position will by no means allow it to be the top of an S it is thus DEC but more perfectly round than I have here drawn it I have compared it care∣fully with the S the C and the O in the inscription and find that it suits the last best may do for the second but not at all for the first  To save the seeming unnecessary repetition of the word  Deo  I was at first sight thinking of  De  ones  and believe have mentioned that conjecture in my ob∣servants but how it may answer or please I know not  Not mentioned in the printed observ    R G  The stone is only regular and dressed on the face a  no doubt has been in∣serted in the wall of the  Aedes Vo  i  a  o  Ca    occ  I return you hearty

which supported the upper floor The altar before mentioned to be preserved in  Elsden  church was found here  This station takes its name of  Bremenium  as is presumed from being  Castrum in Rupe  which is the true description of its scite it being placed  on the brow of a steep and rocky hill or rather as Camden calls it a rocky mountain commanding the pass of Reedsdale On every hand  the prospect is horrible except the narrow valley watered by the Reed which is looked down upon from this rugged eminenceHow little  improvement this country has experienced since the union notwithstand∣ing the great advances husbandry hath made northward  Be  des the several Roman Antiquities noticed in the text in Mr Horsley's Works the fol∣lowing are    XCIV A  H  ag  Honoratus Tribu

Optatus Tribunus Cohortis Primae Vardulorum cum conse∣crantis votum deo Templum  solo extructum  The stone with this  r and curious inscription was dug up at  Riechester  The back part of it is rude and undressed which manifestly shews it to have been built up in some wall perhaps of a temple On the face of the stone where the inscription is cut there appears in two or three places the plain marks of fire the same appearance which I observed on another of these stones found in this place The letters of the inscription are well cut and all of them that remain are still very fair and distinct only a piece of stone is broken off at one corner which cannot yet be retrieved and with it a small part of the inscription is lost the addition of  Socio  to  In  cto Soli  deserves a remark  Soli Comitt  is frequent on medals and I imagine  Soli socio  to have much the same meaning The  Antonine  for whose safety this was vowed must have been either  Commodus  or  Caracalla Commodus  was the first who assumed the conjoined titles of  Pius  and  F  li    but then in inscriptions to him there is usually some other distinguishing title whereas the form of the names here is such as is usually ascribed to  Caracalla  This suits well enough with the conjecture of his being the Author of the  Itinerary  and with the assign∣ed Roman limits at the peace of  Severus  and  Caracalla  since it appears from hence that  Riechester  the undoubted  Bremenium  was possessed by the Romans in the reign of  Caracalla  and by the erecting this new Temple that they had no apprehensions of being soon dislodged from this station though probably it was then the boundary The inscription was erected by  Luctus Caecilius Optatus  Tribune of the first Cohort of the  Varduli  The great distance be∣tween the G and the L in the fifth line that is between the last letter of the Emperor's name and the first of the Tribune's is very remarkable The  Varduli  were a people of  Hispania Citerior  situated not far from the west end of the  Pyrenaean Mountains  There are another people in  Hispanta Citertor  usually named  Grovi  or sometimes  Gronii  At the first sight of this inscrip∣tion I concluded that  Graneis  must be the name of the same people for C and G are often in∣terchanged and  Granei  or  Granii  looked like the name  Grovis  or  Gronii  and as I apprehended bid fair to be truer than either I therefore read  cum commilitonibus  or  contubernalibus Gra∣ne  s  but I now with pleasure resign this conjecture for a better of the learned and sagacious Mr Gale which he imparted to me "In the Riechester Inscription says he which is indeed very beautiful the letters  SOC  in the first line are certainly for  Socio Gruter  p xxii gives us an inscription D I M ET SOLI SOCIO which is read  Deo in  icto Mithrae et Soli Socio  In the  Riechester  inscription the complement is paid to the Emperor by given him the  Sun  for his companion as this in Gruter associates him with the God  Mithras  and as he appears upon the medals of  Constantine  and others with the legend  Soli invicto Comiti  there is no further difficulty till we come at the sixth line where the  Cohors Prima Varduloram  shews itself beyond exception The  Cum Con  I read with the beginning of the seventh line  Cum Consecraneis  The word  Consecranei  Devoted to the same service or engaged in the same cause  is not very common but we have in  Julius Capit  nus Gord  c  Sacrati comm  tone  mo etiam Cors  cranei  i e  ejusdem Sacramenti Militaris participes  than which nothing can be more apposite Since the receipt of this letter from Mr Gale I have reexa∣mined the original and am convinced that it has been an N at the end of the sixth line for the breadth of the letter which may certainly be determined from the visible tops of both the vertical strokes is exactly the same with the breadth of the other N's in this inscription but sensibly less than the breadth of any M in the whole The imperfect letter at the end of the seventh line seems to have been an O though the repetition of the word  Deo  appears harsh and uncommon If we could suppose it to have been a C Mr Gale would read DECR PVB for  decreto Publico  As it is probable that last line has concluded with the usual S L M so  unless we suppose  Temp  for  Templum  with which  votum  agrees to have stood at the end of the seventh line there will be no room for it at all Temples were frequently vowed as well as Altars and we have one remarkable instance more in this collection of a Temple  Pro satute domni divinae  This inscription also gives us a certain discovery of a new  auxiliary Cohort  in Britain and either this or an  Equestrian Cohort  of the same people seems to be mentioned in a  Du  inscription  XCIV E This is a small and monstrous rude figure of  Silvanus  lately found at the same place The breasts are two rude circular lines and the eyes two such holes The nose and mouth are expressed on the stone by three cross cuts he seems to have a  Patera  in his left hand though figures in a sacrificing posture generally hold it in the right  XCVI  Silvano Pan  eo pro  Ra  ni Tribuni et Laculae e  us Ey  chus libertus Consulis Vo∣tum S  likens Merit    This and the following inscription together with several coins have been lately dug up at  Riechester  This altar was found near the northwest corner of the fort with the face downward The first words in it are plainly  Sivano Pantheo  It is common now to give the name of  Pantheus  to the figure of any God who has the Symbols of other Gods joined with his own and in some inscriptions  Panthe  is spoken of a particular God Thus we have in Gruter  Signum Panthei Testaments feri    and  Signum Pantheum sua Pecunia D D  As also  Panthe  Aug  likewise  Hereculi Mercurio et Silva  rum et o  Pantheo  and  Dion  informs us that  Dr  illa  was called  Parthea  from the variety of divine honours that her brother  Caligula  ordered to be paid to her after her death A late ingenious friend conjectured that the expression  Silvano Pantheo  might denote the whole groupe of Silvan deities  Faunique Satyrique et menticelae Silvani  F  conque deos umbosaque Silva feranque  Ru  Ha  et  The altar has been erected for the safety of  Rufinus  the  Tribuni  and his wife  Lucilla  by  Ethy∣ch  a freedman of the Consul This  Rufinus  no doubt had at that time the command of the garrison here and  s different both from the Tribune mentioned in a forgoing inscription and in that which follows  A conjecture arises that  Pantheos  is compounded with the Latin name Pan and  Theos  Greek  De    and this is in some degree supported by the Grecian declensions used in the fore∣going inscriptions  XCVII  Pa  Ae  Fra  nu  Tribanus  This inscription resembles the centurial kind and contains nothing material in it but the name of the Tribune  Era  s  It was found near the western rampart of the station not far from the spot where the foregoing altar was dug up  Several of the coins found lately at this station were of  Marcus Aurelius  This confirms to us that the Romans were about that time possessed of this and the neighbouring stations and makes it more probable that the  Artonine  mentioned in an inscription at  Risingham  might be  Mar  us Aurelius  and that  Calparnius Agr  a  his  Legate  was the person whose names have been erased out of the inscription found at  E  sdon  It is the observation of the great  Mr A  a  n  "that one finds as many figures of the excellent Emperor  Marcus Aurelius  as of all the  est together"  will appear  by comparing the description given of it by Camden two centuries ago with its present state  There are hills hard by so boggy and standing  with water on their summits that no horsemen are able to ride through them  And again  Mountainous desert and impossable such as this tract is  Camden preserves this Inscription  D R S  DVPL N EXPLOR

solverunt libenter merito  Mr Horsley's remarks on this altar are as follow  The original was removed to Connington The plain and distinct mention of Bremenium upon this large altar does strongly argue Riechester to be the place The implication and proper cut of the letters which is neglected in Camden I have endeavoured to supply from the original No body that I know of has given a satisfactory explication of the D R S at the top I think it plain that they are to be read  Deae Romae sacrum  That they made a Goddess of Rome and erected altars and temples to her needs no proof to those who have any acquaintance with medals and other Roman Antiquities There is a curious altar at Elenborough erected  Genio Loci Fortunae Reduci Romae Aeterne  c I once thought of  Diis Romanis sacrum  but this suits not with  Numini ejus  in the body of the inscription for which reason the learned Dr Gales reading  Deabus Rumabus Sacrum  cannot be admitted The altar then is sacred to the Goddess  Rome  erected by a  Duplares  of a detachment of  Exploratores  or scouts at  Bremenium  under the command of  Caius Caepio Charitinus  the Tribune Caepio is a consular name and we read in the Notitiae of a  Prae∣fectus Numeri exploratorum Lavatris  Whether they were the same with these I will not undertake to determine The  Duplares  were soldiers who had a double allowance of corn of which a part of the Roman soldiers pay consisted The  Exploratores  were like our scouts sent out to discover the enemy or their country When they were in garrison it is probable they were generally placed in the more advanced stations or such as were most con∣veniently situated for prospect and discovering the first approach of the enemy as also for guarding the passes against their inroads  Camden adds  that Ptolomy speaking of Bremenium places it in this very scite and part of the country and from thence Antonine begins his first journey in Britain as from the utmost limit of the Roman province at that time When the barbarous nations had broken through the wall of Antoninus Pius and would in conse∣quence hurry over and lay waste all the country before them the wall of Hadrian laying neglected to the time of Severus we may ne∣cessarily admit that this station was regarded as the limit of the Em∣pire from whence the old  Itinerary  which bears the title of Anto∣nine's began viz  a Limitis  The construction given it to imply  a Vallo  is only a gloss put on it by the transcriber  Mr Collier communicated to me the drawing of the following Sculp∣ture and Inscription lately found at this station and now in the pos∣session of the Rev Mr Jolly It never was published He informed me it was found near the eastern entrance into the station is about four feet nine inches in length and two feet three inches in breadth  Mr Wallis says  there is nothing more worthy of remark by the alpine streams of Reed and North Tyne  I wish I could have been as readily transported from Riechester to Wark as I transmit the reader on the feathers of the grey goose wing we did not pursue the Reed any further northward though informed that near to  Bridhope Crag  a little above  Riechester  there are two large square entrenchments with two openings on every side each defended by an outward  mole  of an oblong form at the distance of six yards from the aperture the description given of them shews they are similar to the large entrenchment on Stainmore at  Roy Cross  Vide Excursions to the Lakes in Westmoreland and Cumberland where a plate of that entrenchment is given  which is attributed to the English under William the Conqueror on the defection of Cumberland and Northum∣berland who were supported by the Scotch Monarch  NUNWICK  the seat of Sir Lancelot Allgood

the Bran∣don White House family  Wallis  from the eastern terrace a delightful prospect opens commanding a fine view of Chipchase on the one hand and the variegated vale of Symondburn on the other the banks of the stream are romantic and wild and the wastes which terminate the prospect are at an agreeable distance  Near Nunwick some years ago were the remains of a monument by most writers termed British consisting of five natural stone pillars placed in circular order near eight feet in height and twenty feet in girt the area which they formed was ninety feet in circumference Whether the interstices were heretofore filled up with stones of a smaller size to compose a circle which on the advance of cultivation were re∣moved we have no evidence Bishop Gibson only speaks of them as in the state described I have great doubt whether this was a temple or place of convocation of the Druids or not I am rather inclined to be∣lieve such as are composed of a small number of stones are Danish mo∣numents and memorials of some public act of that people Where the  circle is uniform the column to which it is conceived the victims were bound is perfect or to be distinguished and the recess forming the  Sanctus  or place of the altar is remaining like those in Cumberland and Angl  sea it is not to be doubted the Druids were their construc∣tors that they were their places of convocation and as every public act of those Lawgivers was preceded by holy rites and sacrifice it may with propriety be said they were places formed for a mixed appropria∣tion for acts civil and

way but the inscription was obliterated at one end occasioned as one may suppose by the workmen's tools either when they built or pulled down the kitchen The letters are three inches long It may possibly be in the possession of Dr Scot the present Rector as it was in that of Mr Wastell the late Rector in Mr Horsley takes notice of VLPIVS and SABINVS two Roman Lieutenants sent against the Britains but says he never heard of any inscriptions found relating either of them  In the Monasticon we are told King Edward taking displeasure at Anthony Beck then Bishop of Durham dismembered this church from that See It was afterwards in the possession of the D'Arcys in the reign of King Edward III John D'Arcy at his death left it to Queen Phi∣lippa who gave it to Windsor College  Mr Wallis speaks of a remarkable Scull dug up within the walls of the church  On the back part of it was the figure of a large scal∣lop shell at one of the auditories the figure of a torcular shell like a screw  It is surprizing no Naturalist has attended to this wonder∣ful phaenomenon Mr Wallis himself I should have apprehended would not have left this great curiosity so slightly treated of He doth not even say whether these impressions were sculptured or adhesions of petrified matter In either case it would have gratified the virtuoso to have had a perfect description We read of that degree of wanton∣ness and inhumanity that the sculls of enemies at public festivals were used for drinking Cups Was this ornamented with sculpture it would lead to an apprehension it was once employed in such unhallowed rites If these were petrifactions it would still be more wonderful  This introduces to my mind a hasty idea of petrifactions being es∣teemed a testimony of an universal deluge It has been insisted upon by many learned men but the discoveries hitherto made in that branch are in no wise convincing Moses had his learning from the Egyptians Mr Bryant has amply displayed their knowledge of that great event I dare not make strictures on that learned work but opinion is fond of liberty All the petrifactions I have seen in the various collections do not prevail to fix my judgment in favour of such testimony In the first chapter of Genesis we see the grand work of creation classed in six progressive orders In the figures of Eastern language it is given under a diurnal arrangement By such expression I presume we are not to be confined in our idea of the work to those short periods the works of Providence are wonderful to the highest degree in a course of na∣ture  why should we render them still more miraculous and less cre∣dible by holding to the very letter of the book of Genesis without giving a latitude to the expression So much of miracle and so little of reason in modern dissertations occasions much infidelity We see plainly the work of the divine Architect was progressive let us presume each day means an age in which by a natural and progressive course "the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself" might arrive to its maturity from the original stamina the great Creator ordained in the beginning It was not till the third aera that the dry land appeared all before was deluged Here is a period then in which all those substances which we find have left their testimony in petrifac∣tion might rest upon the highest hills when at the command of their God the mountains heaved themselves up from the bosom of the deep The shifting of vast sands the falling of mighty precipices rent by earthquakes mining in various countries and eruptions of volcanoes have brought to light those materials which are lodged very deep in the earth and yet none of them have produced any evidence of the destruc∣tion of the human race by petrifactions of parts peculiar to mankind their implements or utensils of which gold would not decay erections or other memorials of their antediluvian existence To enter at large into this disquisition would lead to a separate work it shall suffice at this time to say that if there were no other testimonies existing than petri∣factions to prove this great event we should still depend upon implicit faith concerning it To return  The church of Symondburn has two dependant chapels Bellingham and Falston the parish is between thirty and forty miles in length ex∣tending to Liddesdale in Scotland There is within this district be∣tween Falston and the extreme boundary an extensive tract of country where till within the last century conversion had scarce reached or the benefits of religion and the rites of the English church been pro∣mulged except in the collection of tithes  Symondburn Castle was demolished by the country people in vain researches for treasure a small part was lately repaired with two an∣gular turrets as an ornamental object on the landskip  We now took the road to Rothbury the first object that attracted our attention after passing the seat of Mr Riddle was a tower on a lofty eminence commanding an extensive prospect appertaining to Mr Delaval's estate of Bavington the edifice ugly to a degree  We approached  BAVINGTON  the ancient Familyhouse of the Shaftoes  William Shaftoe King Edward I  William King Edward III  William King Richard II  Alexander King Henry V  William King Edward IV  John King Edward VI  William King Charles I  William King George I  Wallis  now the seat of George Shaftoe Delaval  Esq  situate on a rising ground and commanding a southern prospect in which a fine canal with rising plantations are the chief ornaments Nature has given but few beauties to the landskip  CAPHEATON  was the next place we visited the ancient possession of the Swinburns  Sir Thomas Swinburn King Henry IV  He with Lord Berkley and Henry May  Esq  took ships belonging the French carrying provisions to Milford harbour  Sir William Swinburn King Henry VI  Sir John King Edward IV  Sir John Member for Northumberland Queen Mary  Sir Thomas Queen Elizabeth  High Sheriff King Charles I  William Swinburn  Esq  King Charles I  His estate sequestered by Parliament  Sir John created a Baronet Charles II  Sir John married Mary the daughter of Anthony Englefield  Sir John his son died unmarried  Sir Edward his brother present possessor  Wallis  and now the seat of Sir Edward Swinburn This mansion was formerly of the castle form and Leland says was a fair building moted round The present house is built in the taste which prevailed in the time of the Charles's the pleasure grounds are laid out in an agreeable man∣ner the tufts of trees which are scattered over the lands give a singular beauty to the scene Sir John the ancestor of the present Sir Ed∣ward married the daughter of Sir Henry Lawson of Brough in York∣shire and had by her  thirty children  of whom eighteen arrived at maturity  Wallis page  Many Roman antiquities have been discovered here of which Mr Wallis gives a particular account  A sympullum silver oz This was a cup used in sacrifices  Bottoms of three others  Handles of three with beautiful figures in relief Upon one the bust of an  Emperor  two smaller figures one a  Shepherd  holding a crook in his left hand with sheep by his side the other a poor man looking towards the Emperor in a supplicating attitude his body bending and resting on a staff with both hands on his back a burthen In the middle of the handle is a winged  Mercury  sitting with a  caduceus  in his right hand his left grasping a ball inclining on the seat a cock under him crowing At the bottom  Diana  in a loose robe a spear in her right hand her left rested on her hip a dog looking up to her  Silenus  naked to the feet holding a bunch of grapes in his right hand and a  nymphaea  or water lily in his left with a  canthera  or jolly flagon by him swelling to the brim with the juice of the grape On another handle a lion a stag and a wild boar slain for sacrifice On the third a Priestess before the altar sacrificing holding incense in her right hand and a  thyrsus  in the left above her head the bust of an Emperor bearded  Part of a handle whereon is the figure of  Mars  in armour a  Flamin  before the altar of a temple in a grove sacrificing  A figure of  Hercules  and  Antaeus  wrestling finely executed the lion's skin and club laying by them  A  Neptune  naked to the waist in a reclining posture holding a trident in his right hand and an anchor in his left  In the time of Agricola the Romans wore beards not customary from the th year of the city till the Emperor Hadrian  Wallis  He says they were found about a mile from the Roman causeway and seem by the workmanship to be as ancient as the time of  Agricola  Within view of Capheaton are the cliffs of  HARNHAM  This place takes its name from the Hermanstreet or military road It was a strong fortress defended by nature on one hand with rocks of vast height and on the other by a morass there was no approach to it but by a narrow pass on the north defended by an iron gate easily maintained Part of the present Mansion consists of the re∣mains of the old Castle and stands on the brink of a vast precipice This was the mansion of the Babingtons a family as ancient in Britain as the conquest and of Colonel Babington in the reign of Charles II Governor of Berwick His first wife Catherine  She was the widow of Colonel George Fenwick of Brinkburn and eldest daughter of Sir Arthur Hezelrigge of Nosely in Leicestershire Bart by Dorothy Greenville sister to Robert Lord Brook  On a pane of glass in the middle window of the house is wrote with a diamond  Philip Babington Sept    K Babington Sep    And on another pane  How vain is the help of man K Babington Omnia vanitas June th    Wallis  was under excom∣munication  for contempt of an ecclesiastical sentence on which ac∣count she was not intitled to sepulture in consecrated ground To prepare for her interment a cave was hewn in the rocks of Harnham below the foundations of the castle where her remains now lay in a leaden coffinIt is a disgrace to a polished and enlightened nation that such a Court has existence but to a state professing the rights and religious tenets and enjoying the liberty of Britain it is infamy A Court where in despight of the right of trial by Juries property is dis∣posed by arbitrary sentence and where the grossest acts of inquisitorial Iniquity are daily practised such as private examination of witnesses and suppression of evidence and yet this scab upon the constitution re∣mains uneradicated  Sir John Babington of the Harnham family acquired the crest and motto of his coatarmour by a desperate service under King Henry IV in France on his own petition he was one of six young Knights sent on this duty and on his leaving the royal presence he brandished his sword and exclaimed "Foy est tous"  The crest a dragon's head from the mouth the words  Foy est tous  proceeding The Pul∣leines of Carlton in Yorkshire intermarried with this family and at Carlton Hall is a pedi∣gree beautifully illuminated  BELSAY CASTLE  the seat of Sir William Middleton was next in view it is built on an eminence part of the old castle remaining This was part of the family possessions in the time of King Edward II The boast of pedigree and honourable connections appertains to the Middletons but it is not pertinent to my work as that of an Itinerant to enter upon the field of the Herald otherwise in this family and that of the Babingtons there is sufficient matter to blazon an hundred pages  Sir John de Middleton King Edward II  He forfeited Belsay for being in league with the Scots  Sir John to whom the forfeited estates were restored King Henry V  Sir John King Henry VI  Sir John High Sheriff King Edward IV  Representative in Parliament for the county in the th year of the same reign  Thomas King Edward VI  A Commissioner for Inclosures upon the Middle Marches  Robert Queen Elizabeth  Thomas King Charles I  One of the Parliament's Commissioners for sequestering Lands in Northumberland  Sir William Middleton created Baronet King Charles II  Sir John High Sheriff Queen Anne  Sir William Member for Northumberland in six Parliaments  Sir John Lambart Middleton  Sir William the present possessor  Wallis  The Lambarts with whom this family had alliance were of an illustrious race and derived royal blood from King William I  Mr Wallis in his notes gives several letters from King Henry VIII to one of this family on public duties but none of them afford any light to history or import any special matter of consequence  On our gaining the summit of the eminence the country opened upon us beautifully we now looked down upon the rich vale where Wallington stands extending towards the southeast to a great distance terminated by a view of the sea The country before we gained this situation was for some miles unpleasant little planted and ill cul∣tivated but this prospect recompensed all the fatigue the eye had en∣dured in the sameness of the preceding passage On the left hand  LITTLE HARLE  the seat of Gawen Aynsley  Esq  presented itself surrounded with wood This was one of the Manors of the Barony of Prudhoe and appertained to the Fenwicks  King Edward VI  By the escheats of the th of Queen Elizabeth it appears then to have become the possession of the Aynsleys of Shaftoe In the depth of the vale we passed  KIRK HARLE  the seat of Sir William Loraine a pleasant retirement It was one of the Manors of the Barony of Bolbeck and the possession of Sir Robert de Harle in the reign of Edward III but soon after became the pro∣perty of the family of Loraines  From a little pamphlet printed at Newcastle being "an account of the Genealogy" of this family it appears that  Robert  the first of this family in England came over with Wil∣liam the Conqueror For his services in that expedition and in the incursion of  Malcolm King of Scotland  in the sixth year of the reign of  William Rufus  he was rewarded with several large estates in Ufferton East Middle and West Harrington in the county of Durham and free fisheries in the river Were He was a distinguished scholar and was the author of some learned works  The descendants of Robert resided in the county of Durham until the reign of King Henry the Fifth when William Lorrain by marriage of Johanna the eldest daughter and one of the three coheiresses of William Del Strother of Kirkharle Tower became possessed of the Manor and ancient Mansionhouse of Kirkharle from which time the family residence has constantly been at this place From William Lorraine by Johanna his wife descended  Edwardmarried Elizabeth daughter of John Harding  Esq  of Hallinside in the county of Durham and died in the reign of King Richard III  Robert his sonmarried Margaret daughter of Robert Bowes  Esq  of the county of Dur∣ham He was slain by the Moss Troopers  William his sonmarried Agnes daughter of Sir William Waters Knt of the county of York  Thomas his sonmarried Thomasin daughter of Thomas Walter of Whitwell in the county of Durham Gentleman He died in the th year of the reign of King James I  Thomas his sonmarried the widow of Thomas Bewick  Esq  of Close House in Northum∣berland He was a distinguished scholar being a great proficient in the Latin Greek and Hebrew tongues  Thomas his sonmarried Grace the daughter of Sir William Fenwick Bart of Wallington in the county of Northumberland He was created a Baronet in the th year of the reign of King Charles II and died in January  Sir William his son was educated to the Law in Lincoln's Inn where he took his degree of Barrister He married to his first wife Elizabeth daughter of Sir John Laurence Knt of the city of London Alderman by whom he had no issue To his second wife Anne daughter of Richard Smith  Esq  of Preston in the county of Bucks  Sir Charles his younger son succeeded to his title and estates He married Margaret the sister of Henry Lambton  Esq  of Lambton in the county of Durham  Sir William his son  One of this house Robert Loraine  was slain by the Moss Troopers near his own mansion in memory of which a pillar was erected  We advanced to  WALLINGTON  the seat of the late Sir Walter Calverley Blackett Bart and now of Sir John Trevelyan his nephew and heir This was one of the Ma∣nors of the Barony of Bolbeck and the ancient possession of the Greys In the reign of Edward II it was held by one of that family called John usually stiled John de Wallington it afterwards became the inheritance of the Strothers by marriage of the heiress of Robert de Wallington from the Strothers it came to the Fenwicks by the mar∣riage of John Fenwick of Fenwick Tower with Maria the third daugh∣ter and one of the coheiresses of William Del Strother and remained in  that family from the reign of King Henry IV till Sir John Fenwick sold it to Sir William Blackett in the reign of King William III  Sir John de Fenwick King Henry IV  Sir John King Henry VI  Sir Henry King Henry VI  Sir John King Henry VIII  Sir William High Sheriff of Northumberland Q Elizabeth  Sir John High Sheriff King James I  Created a Baronet th of June King Charles I  Member of Parliament for the county of Northumberland King Charles I  His son John was slain at the battle of Marston Moor  Sir William King Charles II  Representative in Parliament for the county of Northumberland  Sir John executed on Tower Hill King William III  Wallington House is a handsome stone structure but from the mode of architecture doth not seem to take its date in this century Before the south front is a pretty pasture ground inclining to the brook of Wansbeck at the east front is the grand approach having a circular coach road with a beautiful green plot parterres and flowering shrubs plantations and covered walks close it to the north and conceal the offices the gardens seem well disposed on a warm inclination and the whole makes a pleasing rural appearance without any intrusion of costly ornaments and laboured works In the whole composition there is a degree of taste mixed with a countenance of rusticity which characte∣rizes an agreeable retirement Nothing is so displeasing to the eye as temples pagodas columns pyramids Gothic banquettinghouses and modern ruins jumbled into a few acres with that confusion and want of taste which overloaded opulence often disgorges round a modern villa True taste is attached to nature so intimately that each disposi∣tion by art must be made to heighten her beauties not to distort her and overburthen the scene with a progeny adopted from all the quar∣ters of the earth A bad situation cannot be changed nay it is not even improved by gorgeous works a load of edifices is only like finery on a deformed objectbut dispose the works of art in a just adaption to the situation and in the mode pointed out by nature and they grow into elegance  The nearer prospect from Wallington over the vale is rich to the southeast the view is extensive though not much variegated in a clear atmosphere the sea is visible from thence at the extream of a level not less than twenty miles in length  In entering these demesnes the benevolent character of the late owner instantly occurred to my mind What dreadful instruments are great∣ness riches and power in the hands of tyranny and malevolence but what blessings do they not pour forth from the good and wise How detestable is authority under some characters which it would be invi∣dious to name but how lovely is power in the possession of others Such characteristicks have marked the life of this man as will immor∣talize his memory and as he eminently possessed whilst living so will Fame transmit to futurity his name and virtues accompanied with THE UNIVERSAL LOVE OF MANKIND  He died in the th year of his age without issue The title is extinct He represented the town of Newcastle in seven succeeding parliaments viz and and served the office of Mayor in and was the oldest Member of the House of Commons  The Inn beyond Wallington on the Rothbury road at  CAMBO  commands a fine view of the vale we had passed The ascent for more than a mile is gradual and the road in a direct line from Wallington so that the hedge rows form a vista terminated by the dome of the offices which has an agreeable effect The prospect here is extensive and noble some coalworks to the right deform the nearer ground but all beyond is of that happy composition which cultivation mixing with natural woods and fanciful plantations give the landskip object decreasing after object and stretching from the eye till mingled in the azure of the atmosphere in which all the horizon lay softened and blended  Cambo  The name derived from the camp or sort on the hillWallis  was the seat of Sir Robert de Camhoe in the time of King Henry III  The way from thence to Rothbury is very crooked and by cross roads rendered perplexed About Wallington we saw some guideposts but in few other places in the country and several of those having been painted were obliterated and only mocked our anxiety Many bridges give easy passage over the brooks but their flanks are suffered to be walled up or closed so that the traveller is deprived of the necessary  refreshment for his cattle The carts were passing unmarked and their drivers insolent to a high degree  We had a view of  Rothbury Castle  at the distance of some miles the situation appeared rugged and uncommon On the side which then pre∣sented itself we could discern distinctly no more than the square tower and part of its flankings placed on a considerable eminence of a rocky and barren aspect By not taking the proper road we were led almost round this edifice which we viewed with no small degree of impatiency When we came to look upon the northern front our curiosity was some∣what slackened but nevertheless we passed down the road about half a mile and having climbed the fence ascended the steep to the building The fatigue was but ill recompensed for we found this object of our anxious curiosity no other than an ornamental structure composed of a square tower flanked with a curvated wall embattled and pierced with loopholes and each wing terminated with a bastion the situation romantick on the brink of a broken precipice The sides of this hill to the west and south present a shaken and tremendous rocky steep rent into vast impending columns and massive tables the stones of enormous bulk in many places hang on each other in such loose posi∣tions as if ready to fall into the vale forming caverns and recesses and rude heaps of rocks of a most wild and grotesque appearance To decorate I presume this noble scene the awkward images of a goat and a staring stag delight the passing childrenOn resorting to my book of notes I find they carry the countenance of peevishness but as they are just I will transcribe them The southern front opens on a small plain naturally of a circular form scattered over with huge heads of griffins broken cornices and ensigns of Calverly the lamb and flag of Grace sculptured on white freestone in the midst of which stand two preposterous effigies representative of no known dress personage or people And to give the coup de grace to this composition enormous ribs jawbones and members of a whale are fastened to the walls for decorations We entered the tower in which by way of tables are three large rude unhewed stones one in the center and one in each re∣cess at the sides benched with similar stones pretty enough for the reception of Thomas of Hickathrift or Jack the Giantkiller  We had from this plot one of the most extensive views in Northum∣berland Eastward we overlooked the vale which opened upon us at Wal∣lington on which many gentlemen's seats were scattered mingled with  woody plotsvery remote objects give little pleasure to the eye except what it derives from the diversity of colouringthe sea formed the dis∣tant horizon To the southward we had a view of Cambo and the hills beyond Wallington with Mr Delaval's tower the deformity of which might now be forgot for the agreeable obelisk it gave to the prospect from hence The western view was more confined but wholly culti∣vated and the north frowned in rocks mountains and barren heath In descending the hill a curvated canal presented itself margined with young plantations on whose border a tent was pitched This was one of Sir Walter's retreats The family being there we did not visit  Rothly House  We passed  Codgey Crag  a stupendous cliff crowned with another un∣couth ornament in the stile of the former  It is remarkable in this passage to  Rothbury  in many parts where we could view a tract country for the distance of three or four miles all consisting of cultivated land the farmhouses were so very distant and the inhabitants few that for miles we did not perceive a human being in the whole circle The fields did not engage people in tillage and the roads were almost without passengers so that a stranger at mid∣day might wander far from the way leading to the place of his destination before he could correct his mistake Where tillage is ne∣glected and large farms are thrown into grass it must be the case the country is depopulated the industrious labourer cannot procure bread and an engrossing farmer in a state of indolence grows opulent by his herds c at the loss to community of those members of the common∣wealth in whom the strength of the nation consists who are by a de∣plorable necessity driven to emigrate an event which will at once sap the state and impoverish the subject Boys who would otherwise have been employed in husbandry are bound out to manufactories our ma∣nufacturers are grown more numerous than trade can maintain the husbandman's labour is not wanted his hands are shifted to a different employ and the hardy race of Britons are sunk into a state of imbecil∣lity and reduced to the languid and meagre shadows of men who hang upon the loom The difficulty of recruiting the army and manning the navy will every day increasethe resources are taken away Not onefourth part of the number of families are employed in husbandry in the north there was forty years ago This was a nursery for the army and the fleet The enlarging farms and  reducing the tillage is a capital error which though slow in its con∣sequences yet is as sure as fate Substituting the horse for the ox in husbandry is a mistaken maxim which for a temporary profit has crept in upon us the ox was advancing in value and increasing the supply of the market as he laboured the horse takes twice the maintenance consuming a vast portion of grain and his price is sink∣ing yearly into nothing Not exposing the necessaries of life in open market is another matter that prejudices the poor by increasing prices an artificial scarcity is thereby much easier to be effected I am bold to say that if a law was made to oblige plowing by oxen and to enforce every article of the farmer to be brought to open market to be sold within a limitted time we should experience much greater plenty Of my own knowledge wheat when s d the Winchester bushel in immense quantities has been kept up till spoiled and made fit for no∣thing but hogs I cannot avoid adopting Mr Pennant's sentiments on a view of the like kind Speaking of his entry into Northumberland at Cornhill he says  All this country is open destitute of trees and al∣most even of hedges for hedges are in their infancy in these parts as it is not above seven or eight years since they have been introduced the land is fertile swells into gentle risings and is rich in corn It is miserably depopulated a few great farmhouses and hamlets ap∣pear rarely scattered over the vast tracts There are few farms of less value than l a year They are generally three four or five hun∣dred and I heard of one possessed by a single family that even reached twentyfive hundred in this was a single field of acres and which took bolls of seed wheat of six Winchester bushels each A humour fatal to the commonwealth prevails over many parts of the north of flinging numbers of small tenements into a large one in order to save the expence of building or perhaps to avoid the multiplicity of receipts lay a whole country into a sheep walk These devour poor men's houses and expel the ancient inha∣bitants from their firesides to seek their bread in a strange land I have heard of a character I forgot the spot it curses that is too bar∣barous and infamous to be overlooked which has so little feeling as to depopulate a village of souls and to level their houses to the ground to destroy eight or ten farmhouses on an estate of l a year for the sake of turning almost the whole into a sheep walk There he lives and there he may long live his own tormentor detest∣ing detested by all mankind Wark and Learmouth once consi∣derable  places are now scarcely inhabited The last formerly a great market town is now reduced to a single farmhouse The inhabitants have long since been dispersed forced to exchange the wholsome the vigorous the innocent lives of the rural oeconomists for the sickly shortlived employs of manufacturers in Birmingham and other great towns where disease and often corrupted morals cause double the consumption of people as would happen were they permitted to enjoy their ancient seats The want of labourers begins to be sensibly felt As a proof they are retained by the year and policy dictates to their employers the affording them good wages each has his cottage a a piece of land gratis and a shilling a day in summer and tenpence in winter I call this good pay in a country which ought to be very cheap if not what are the fine effects of the great improve∣ments The Spectator speaks much of the deserts of the man that raises two ears of corn where one grew before But who will point out the man who has the soul to make his poor brethren feel the happy effects of his art I believe that at present there are numbers who have raised ten for one that were known a few years ago It would be natural to suppose that plenty would introduce cheapness but till the providential plenty of the present year corn was exactly double the value of what it was years past Yet the plenty of money has not been found doubled by the poor manufacturer or la∣bourer The land owner in the north hath taken full care of himself A farm of l per annum years ago has been lately set for l Another of l will be soon set for l per annum An estate was bought in for l it consisted of acres of which have been sold for l and all these improvements result from the unprincipled and iniquitous notion of making the buyer of the produce pay not only to satisfy the demand of the landlord but to enable the farmer to make a princely fortune and to live with a luxury the shame of the times They have lost the respectable cha∣racter of the Old English Yeomanry by too close an imitation of the extravagant follies of their betters  The oxen of these parts are very fine a pair has been sold for l the weight of one was stone The mountain sheep are sold for half a guinea a piece the lowland ewes for a guinea the weathers for a guinea and a half the best wool from to s the stone of pounds and a half  We now approached  ROTHBURY  the whole country in view consisting of rocky steeps lofty hills crowned with heath and others composed of nothing but naked stones a moun∣tainous and rugged prospect dreary and desolate The breez which broke up the vale from the northwest afforded us the true effect which under the descriptive phrase of "howling in the wilderness" had here∣tofore conveyed to my mind an image rather poetically extravagant than true but here it was justly descriptive for as it passed over the naked steeps and rugged cliffs its sound could not be described by any other expression  We descended into this desolate vale down a very steep and stony road barrenness and rocks on every hand but on passing a little projecting eminence were agreeably surprized by the opening of the hills and it was not long before we had a sight of Whitton Tower and soon after Rothbury presented itself seated in the neck of a nar∣row cultivated glen a situation perfectly sequestered and secure from storms some pretty fields opening to the southwest where the valley is enlarged  This is a small irregular town on the river Coquet without any thing remarkable but its situation  The pedestal of the font in the church at Rothbury is worthy observation  The stone is not exactly square at the bottom where it appears intended to be fixed into some foundation stone two opposite sides are inches in breadth the other inches but where the sculpture begins the edges of the stone are taken off The work in bass relief on the west side is about inches long and inches broad and I presume represents our Lord sitting in judgment The principal figure has lost its head but holds a scrol in the left hand On each side is the figure of an angel kneeling and below them a crowd of heads lifted up some hands clasping books others elevated or laid upon the breast The other sides contain rich ornamental sculpture of fancy figures interwoven with foliage such as are seen upon the obelisk in Bewcastle churchyard in Cumberland From their similarity some people have presumed they were works of the same date  it has a market on Thursdays and three annual fairs on WhitMonday st September and Thursday preceding Allhallows day This was the Barony of Roger FitzRoger Baron of Warkworth and Clavering in the reign of King John with which he held a free forest with all its appendages except the goods of felons which at that time was so beneficial a perquisite as to merit a reservation in the royal grant It remained in that family till the  last Lord Clavering granted it to the Crown in the reign of King Edward I King Edward III gave it to Henry Lord Percy and it is now part of the possessions of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland  We were led to view a natural curiosity as it is termed called the Thrumb which is almost a mile from the towna cut formed by na∣ture in the rocks of the river's channel where the stream for about yards is pent in such narrow bounds that a man may leap overnot at all curious or worthy our attention little preferable to a millrace But here we had the misfortune to meet with an impertinent drunken Innkeeper whose overofficiousness and loquacity led us out of the way  Another remarkable circumstance befel us here on obtaining change for a piece of gold from a neighbouring shop the money was so lately and so unskilfully prepared that on turning it over the quicksilver stood in globules upon it the metal was chiefly copperWe set for∣ward for Wooler having our minds furnished with disagreeable ideas which our fellowcreatures too often excite Vices and frauds have ac∣cess to the most sequestered vales for such were first inhabited by out∣laws and robbers  In the neighbourhood of Rothbury to the east is a circular en∣trenchment called Old Rothbury formed on an eminence with a dou∣ble trench and rampier of earth one of those strongholds to which the inhabitants were obliged to retire on the incursions of the Scots  Used as guardhills on the establishment of a night watch before the union of the two kingdoms  Wallis  About three miles up Coquet is  HEPPLE  the Barony of Iva Tailbois in the reign of King Henry III in whose fa∣mily it continued till the reign of King Edward III when it became the possession of the Ogles of Ogle Castle It is now the estate of his Grace the Duke of Portland  To the north about two miles is  CARTINGTON  an old tower once the possession of the Ratcliffs and after them of the Widdringtons now the estate of Mr Alcock of Newcastle  Further up the Coquet is  HALY STONE  where Paulinus is said to have converted and baptized many thousands of the Saxons A small priory for about eight Benedictine Nuns stood here founded by one of the Humfranvils of Harbottle Castle by whom it was endowed  The villa impropriation and advowson of Halyston  Alice de Alneto gave thereto a croft in Etherston  Roger Bertram the whole waste of Baldwinswood with liberty of the mills of Mitford mul∣turefree and pasture on the commons of Newton and Throphill These gifts were confirmed in by King Henry III  Corsonhope and Sintile were part of the possessions with acres of land at Kestron  The impropriation and advowson of Allerton also belonged thereto where was an hospital  The advowson and impropriation of Carsonside and  The advowson of Harbottle chapel  Together with four houses in Newcastle  Its revenues were increased by Roger Bertram Baron of Mitford The two livings of Carsonside and Harbottle were consolo∣dated by Richard Kelloe Bishop of Durham by his deed dated Nono die Februarii Anno Domini at the desire of Lord Richard Un∣franvill who entering into holy orders had the cure thereof There are no remarkable remains of the priory at the dissolution the revenue of the house was valued at l s d by Dugdale and l s d by Speed  HARBOTTLE CASTLE  lays about a mile to the westward in the year it was demolished by the Scots but aftewards restored This was part of the possessions of the Unfranvills of Pruddowe  They held Harbottle by the service of keeping Reedsdale free from thieves and wolves under which they also held the Castle and Manor of Otterburn as appears by the Testa de Nevill This service was adjudged to be in Great Serjeantry and in the th year of King Henry IV upon an Escheator's inquisition it was found of the yearly value of l s d Rol Mich King Henry VI Madox's Baron Angl p  On the attainder of Sir William Tailbois  After the battle of Hexham Levels  to whom the inheritance of Unfranvills descended this castle came to the Crown and now belongs Percival Clennel  Esq  It stands upon the banks of Coquet and in the time of King Edward I was a formidable fortress sustaining a desperate attack from the whole body of Scots on their incursion in the year who after laying before it two days were obliged to raise the siege It

grandmother to King James the Sixth of Scotland and First of England  Queen Dowager of Scotland his sister on her mar∣riage with the Earl of Angus Lady Mary Douglas her daughter was born here This castle at present is totally in ruinsWe now returned to Rothbury and took the road to Whittingham  Four miles of our way lay through as barren a country as I have yet seen in this tract there was neither human or brute animal to be observed sheep or goats if such there were hid themselves in the dells which ever way the eye was cast mountains bogs rocks and heath composed the prospect the road was rough and full of stones the ground on each hand broken and grown with heath and the waters which ran in a thousand channels were red with their metalick quality A lassitude and impatiency took possession of the mind and we travelled with displeasure but happily for us the vale of  WHITTINGHAM  lay in our way an extensive rich cultivated valley where every object was highly pleasing after the sad contrast nature had cast in our pas∣sage the fields are well fenced with quicksets the soil luxuriant the crops of corn standing in sheafs were rich to the highest degree the meadows finely verdant the houses well built and roofed with tyle the roads open the sheep and cattle of a large breed and every object wore the countenance of opulence On Inquiry we were surprized to find s an acre per annum was the average price for land there the husban∣dry we remarked was modern and improved This happy vale was near four miles wide in the part we crossed it in our way to Wooler  Before we descended to Whittingham we visited  CALLALEY  the ancient house of the Claverings  Roger Fitz Roger Baron of Warkworth and Clavering King Henry III  Roger de Clavering King Edward I  Alan his younger

Ralph the present possessor  Wallis  In the reign of King Henry III  Gilbert de Callaley being seized of these demesnes granted them to Robert Fitz Roger Baron of Warkworth and Clavering from whom it has descended to the present owner Ralph Clavering  Esq  How long it was the possession of the Callaleys is not known  The house stands on the south side of the brook Callaley in a low situation and retains part of the old structure There is a pretty grove adjoining in a whimsical figure called the Star being octagonal Near to Callaley is a high hill called Castle Hill with a circular intrench∣ment one of those exploratory mounts so frequently seen on the bor∣ders from whence a very extensive prospect is had of the vales of Co∣quet Whittingham and Glendale  About two miles to the east of Whittingham road near where we turned off to Callaley is  LEMINGTON  the seat of the Fenwicks  Nicholas Fenwick Representative in Parliament for Newcastle many years  Robert the present owner

place retains no singular marks of antiquity  From the village of Whittingham about a mile to the west is  ESLINGTON  the seat of Henry Lord Ravensworth Baron of Ravensworth in the county of Durham It was formerly the possession of Eslingtons and of Allan de Eslington in the time of King Henry III it passed to the Hasleriggs and after them to the Collingwoods in whose family it con∣tinued from the

the brink of the river which forms a fine canal the opposite risings are ornamented with a shrubbery  From the walk above the plantations there is a most excellent prospect of cultivated scenes finely terminated the vale of Whitting∣ham with all its rural richness is extended in front surmounted by the grove of Callaley and its conic mount called Castle Hill to the eastward Lemington with its rising plantations Bolton Park and Broom Park are in view to the north Glanton Titlington and the woods of Shawdon the whole forming an extensive circus shut in on every side  by heathy mountains and rocky steeps disposed at an agreeable distance and contrasting in a beautiful manner with the nearer objects  LITTLE RYLE and UNTHANK  estates of the Collingwoods lay within the distance of a mile the Man∣sionhouse at Ryle now totally in ruins To the west is  BITTLESDON  the ancient seat of the Selbys and of Sir Walter Selbye in the reign of King Edward III who lost his head for maintaining with great bravery the Castle of Lidell against David King of Scotland who besieged it with an immense army  This army is said to have consisted of men a considerable part of it formed of militia from whose inexperience they obtained the name of Hoblers  It is now the Mansion of Thomas Selby  Esq  has a romantic situation and commands a view of the Coquet river At  BOLTON  about two miles from Whittingham was an Hospital founded by Ro∣bert de Ross who was Baron of Wark before the year for a Master three Chaplains Lepers and other lay brethren and was dedicated to St Thomas the Martyr or the

discovered three feet in length and two feet in breadth with urns of ordinary pottery con∣taining ashes charcoal and remains of scorched human bones and not far distant was lately found a Celt  I need not enlarge upon the account given of this instrument by Mr Wallis to afford the reader a competent idea of it  Few instruments have more exercised the thoughts of Anti∣quaries than this some contending for its being a weapon of war  R  M  A  Plot  Staff  d  l  re p    Mr Hearre fancies it to be a Roman chife  used in making their  ggers and that it was preferred to iron from the reputed sacredness of the metal of which it was made From there being no mention of it by  na  Monsieur de Chausse or by Spon and no vestiges of it among the Roman arms on the  an or Anti  ne p  or among the ruins of Herculaneum the ingenious Cornish A  y Mr Bo  e is in  ed to think it not of Transmarine origin but the work of  Romans or art  t  ht by them for an offensive missive weapon According to the late  Dr S  C  sius vol p  it was used by the Druid priesthood in their sacra  net  to the end of a stuff with which they cut the misletoe for Yuletide our  and  as  their festival of the au  nnal equinox equinox  Wallis  These sepultures are of the remotest antiquity  At the village of  EGLINGHAM  is a Seat of a branch of the Ogle family  Luke C  F  Queen Elizabeth  H  of the Se  of Lands in

fighting bravely for Henry VI whom he espoused his dying words were  I have saved the bird in my breast  meaning his faith to his party On the pillar are the arms of Percy and Lucy  To the west of the road is  RODHAM  possessed by the family of that name for many ages We find them in the escheats of King Henry III  Wiliam de Rodham King Henry III  William married the daughter and heiress of Thomas

the present possessor  Wallis  The Mansionhouse is modern  On Rosedean Edge in this neigh∣bourhood is a large square intrench∣ment from whence at the distance of three miles you view Bewick Hill a semicircular intrenchment with a dou∣ble Foss and Vallum defended to the west by a steep precipice The entrance on the south is formed by a hollow way defended by large stones placed with their edges in the earth so as to make a strong breastwork  A little to the north of Hedgehope near the Threestone Burn is  a Druidical Monument  now consisting of ten large stones in a circular  form from east to west yards in diameter and yards from north to south Several of the stones are thrown down and some are so sunk in the earth that the original number cannot be ascertained There are three larger than the rest which I presume gave the present name to the burn near which this monument stands  In this neighbourhood is a Cataract called  LINHOPE SPOUT  falling perpendicular feet which passing over several pointed rocks makes a fine white sheet of foam The rock from which the stream precipitates is naked and hath none of those picturesque beauties which grace the waterfall at Hareshaw Linn near Bellingham  On a hill a mile west of Alnham is a semicircular incampment the points of the crescent facing the east seem to have formed the en∣trance It is defended by two high outward rampiers and a deep foss and an inner circle of stones which appear uncemented The interior area about yards diameter shews many remains of buildings  At the village of  ILDERTON  on the west of the road is the ancient Seat of the family of Ildertons We find them possessors of this place in the reign of King Edward I as appears by the escheats of that time The present owner Thomas Ilderton  Esq  Henry de

seats of Henry Collingwood of Cornhill  Esq  The ancient Tower and Mansion of the Lilburns is in ruins  CHILLINGHAM CASTLE  in the next place engaged our attention the Seat of the Earl of Tan∣kerville This was the ancient Seat and Manor of the heroic race of Greys of Wark one of whom lays entombed in the church under an elegant monument ornamented richly and having the recumbent effigies of a Knight and his Lady  The Castle situate on an eminence is of the order of building used in the reign of Queen Elizabeth it has an open area in the center from whence you ascend by many steps into a ballustrade ornamented with the effigies of British warriors armed cut in stone The apartments are awkward and small and the communications irregular Here are several good portraits a full length of Lord Chancellor Bacon another of Lord Treasurer Burleigh a gaudy painting of Buckingham in a white sattin gilded vest gold and white striped breeches effeminate and fantastical a good portrait of King Charles a picture of James II of the most unhappy countenance  In one of the apartments Mr Wallis says is a marble chimneypiece in sawing which from the block a live toad was discovered therein The nidus where the animal lodged as it was disagreeable to the eye by order of the late Earl was filled with cement We enquired after this curiosity but the housekeeper knew nothing of it We saw a painting of this phaenomenon subscribed to which were the Latin stanzas given in the notes  Heus Stagyrita  Tuo si velis quod mirabilius Euripo  Huc ve  to  F  ant re  art  e Maria et sit Lunaticus  Qui c  num ipeliat  re  En  q  d quod non portat Africa  Nec f  o is N  lus aren's  Ignem flammamque puram  Aera tamen vitali cassam  Coeco recessa sciff quod vides sa  i  Obit  s lucem Lithote ni dedere manus  Vivo Bafom  The toad if as large as represented in the painting was wonderful indeed for size as well as its existence being near as big as a hat crown It is not possible to look upon this object without giving passage to some reflections of the following orderHow wonderful are all the works of Providence but how incomprehensible is the existence of this animalshut up in the bosom of a mountain cased in a rock of marble perhaps an hundred feet from the surface living without air or such only as should pervade the veins of this stone existing without other diet than the dews which might pass through the texture of marble deprived of animal consolations without light without liberty without an associate of its kind  In the Newspapers of  I recollect to have read the following paragraph  A letter from Su  er and says a few days ago in a coalmine near this place a large Toad was found a  a solid coal near  feet under ground on being exposed to the air it instantly died  It deposited here when the  matter which inclosed it was soft and before it gained its consistency as marble how many ages ought we to number in its life for multi∣tudes of years must have passed to reduce any soft substance in a course of nature to the state of this stone One may ask why did it not perish in the universal wreck of animal existence and at what age of the world were these mountains of marble first formed The in∣quiry leads to a maze of perplexity like the ingenious Mr Brydon's inspection of the stratas of Etnaean Lava all adopted chronology sinks in the view and years are extended on the age of creation beyond every thing but Chinese calculation  In Chillingham Park are still preserved a breed of wild cattle called the White Scottish Bison it is said they cannot be tamed having so re∣markable a fierceness in their nature Mr Penant in his Tour in Scot∣land and Voyage to the Hebrides p under the title  Drumlanrig  gives the following description of them "In my walks about the park see the white breed of wild cattle derived from the native race of the country and still retain the primaeval savageness and ferocity of their ancestors were more shy than any deer ran away on the appearance of any of the human species and even set off at full gallop on the least noise so that I was under the necessity of going very softly under the shelter of trees or bushes to get a near view of them during summer they keep apart from all other cattle but in severe weather hunger will compel them to visit the outhouses in search of food The keepers are obliged to shoot them if any are wanted if the beast is not killed on the spot it runs at the person who gave the wound and who is forced in order to save himself to fly for safety to the intervention of some tree  "These cattle are of a middle size have very long legs and the cows are fine horned the orbits of the eyes and the tips of the noses are black but the bulls have lost the manes attributed to them by Boethius"  Near Chillingham are two circular intrenchments and at New Town a mile to the westward of Chillingham is a stone cross twelve feet high called the  Hurle Stone  of which I could procure no account  A little northward from Chillingham is the village of  FOWBURY  the possession of the Fowburys in the reign of King Edward I after∣wards  of the family of the Strothers and now of Sir Francis Blake of Twizell A mile from thence is  HORTON CASTLE  the estate of the Greys of Howick formerly the Seat of a younger branch of the Greys of Heton  Thomas Grey King Henry VI  Sir Ralph Grey High Sheriff King Henry VII  Sir Thomas Grey Member of Parliament for Northumberland Queen Mary  High Sheriff King Edward VI  Sir Ralph High Sheriff King James I  Nevil Grey  Esq  King George I  Wallis  This is a deplorable part of the country for a stranger to be benighted in the heavy vapours which frequently envelope the hills the whole day as frequently attend the advance of night into the vale as it happened to us and brings on a darkness truly to be felt whilst there there is no house inhabitant or passenger for miles to direct your way  We were thankful when we gained sight of the Inn at Wooler Haugh the courtyard which we descended into from the road was crowded indeed with waggons and carriages and the lights in the stables shewed there were several guests in the house but of what quality and denomina∣tion we could not divine When we alighted the hostler looked to be in some confusion but we did not devise the reason being willing not to premise any thing to our disadvantage at that time of night in the rain and in a country not known to any of us We were met by a jolly hostess at the door who desired us with all the courtesy of a civil publican to walk in We were introduced to the kitchen and required to air our cloaths till the people got lights and prepared a room It was now time to consider the scene the kitchen smelled rank of cooking for there was as much bustle as if they were preparing a hecatomb the room was populous to a degree for the mistress and two jolly nymphs her daughters stickled in the cookery whilst there went backward and forward in and out hostlers livery servants car∣riers and savages of various denominations in the utmost confusion carrying seeking fetching or calling for innumerable matters like the confusion of Babel in the greatest agitation and emergency When  we had leisure to think we were at a loss to conceive what had occa∣sioned this hurricane in which we had so awkwardly involved our∣selves at this little house under a hill in the wilds of Wooler but outward objects embarrassed all thinking to that degree that our minds remained overwhelmed in what the eye communicated or what distracted the ear and like fellows that were fascinated we forbore to make our escape The table was covered with mangled joints of victuals above us before us on this hand and on that was the noise of tumultuous companies creating that discordance of sounds which distracts an Inn at a fairhallowing laughing ringing of bells beating on tables menaces oaths female titterations and music were in the composition My companion in a whisper says "Where the devil have we got to" I would have told him if it had been in my power I found myself to∣tally embarrassed till at length this horrid discordance rouzed me and on expressing uneasiness at not being shewn to our apartment we were told the room was clearing of its present possessors who were going to bed Startled at such intelligence we began to doubt what would be our accommodations and that we might have occasion to displace the same race of visitants a second time before we could possess any beds in defiance of the weather a night as dark as Erebus and a road unknown we thought it more prudent to set forward for Wooler town distant near two miles and accordingly left this place to the sportsmen who occupied it on their moor shooting parties and to the carriers and horrid wretches who barricadoed it without  At the Black Bull Inn in Wooler we ended the anxieties of the even∣ing in comfortable lodgings and every accommodation a traveller could hope for  WOOLER  is a considerable town holding a weekly market on Thursday and two annual fairs on the th of April and th of October  Mr Handyside who had a premium of l s from the Society for the encouragement of Arts for the second best painting in Enamel exhibited in March was a native of this town  Wallis  it was the ancient Barony of the Muschamps as appears by the escheats of King Henry III afterwards it came to the Greys of Wark and is now the property of the Earl of Tankerville On a circular mount near the  town are the remains of a tower apparently as ancient as the time of the Muschamps By the escheats of the reign of King Richard II it appears there was an Hospital here dedicated to Mary Magdalen In the neighbourhood of Wooler are several intrenchments and kairns one at a place called Cattle Well which has the name of Maiden Castle and another a very considerable one at Trodden Gares  Wooler is situate to the east of Cheviots in an ill cultivated country under the influence of vast mountains from whence it is subject to im∣petuous rains It is a place of great resort in the summer months for invalids to drink goats milk or whey The church is placed on a fine eminence and having been lately rebuilt is commodious It is said the mother church was at Fenton on the east side of the river Till now totally in ruins  Our amusement in the succeeding morning was among such hills as have seldom been thought accessable by parties of pleasure By Humbledon Burn on an easy inclination is an intrenchment called Green Castle and on Humbledon Hugh about a mile to the north∣west of Wooler is a circular intrenchment with a large kairn The side of the hill is cut in various terraces rising above each other This seems to have been calculated for a temporary fort and the mode gene∣rally practised in ancient times in this part of the country Many of those terraces are formed with great exactness about feet in breadth In some places there are three of those flights or terraces in others I observed five placed in regular gradations one above the other These were outworks of an important nature to defend a body of Chiefs or a valuable booty which occupied the crown of a hill The original mode I presume was Danish though those works are properly attri∣buted to the Scotch and English before the battle in The summit of a hill being levelled I conceive received the officers of highest rank and the most valuable effects of the camp to which the platforms rising above each other and encircling the hill when filled with troops would make a powerful defence  In the plain beneath is a stone pillar denoting the ground where of the Scots under Earl Douglas in the reign of King Henry IV on Holyroodday had a great overthrow by Henry Lord Percy and George Earl of March Douglas's forces had possessed the emi∣nence but his passage into Scotland being intercepted by Earl Percy  he was obliged to engage on this plain the battle was so bloody that the lands gained the name of Redriggs from the slaughter with which they were stained According to Hollingshead among the prisoners were the Earls of Fife Murray Angus Athol Orkney and Monteath the Lords Montgomery and Erskine and about Knights Douglas received five wounds and lost an eye Being hotly pursued in the flight Scots were drowned in Tweed the most of their army on this fatal day dying or being prisoners  The disposition of the English was chiefly on an opposite mount to that occupied by the Scotch except their archers who were arranged on the plain The Scots were so galled by the flights of arrows to which we may presume they were extremely exposed if marshalled on those terraces before described that they grew impatient of restraint and with their whole force descended into the plain to come to closer battle The English also advanced their archers retiring in well compacted bodies to admit the other troops into the line at the same time discharging such flights of arrows as no armour could resist and thereby the Scots were soon broken and thrown into confusion Sir John Swinton and Adam Gordon several times rallied flying parties and renewed the battle with the greatest bravery till they fell among the slain His∣torians mention no person of note on the side of the English who was slain that day the victory being entirely the work of the archers the other troops being said not to have engaged  We arrived at  YEVERING  now a mean village and little regarded by travellers though once a place of royal residence  Near this place the Scots were defeated on Magdalenday in the third year of the reign of King Henry V by Sir Robert Humfrevil then Commander of Roxburgh Castle and the Earl of Westmoreland then Lord Warden of the Marches The place of this action is denoted by a rude stone pillar feet high  Harding says that Sir Robert Umfranville who had at that time the keeping of Roxburgh Castle fought at Geterying this year with the Scots on Madelyn day d July Umfranville had but seven score spears and bows with which force he discomfited Scots and chaced them miles into their own land He took prisoners and slew  Hard c  In Bede we have the following passage "Paulinus coming with the King and Queen into a manor or house of the King's called AdGebrin at this day Yevering abode with them days employed wholly in ca∣techising and baptising during which time he did nothing from morn∣ing but instruct the people resorting to him in the saving word of Christ and being thus instructed he baptised them to the forgiveness of their sins in the river of Glen which was hard by This house was in the time of the succeeding Kings neglected and another made for it in a place called Melnim now Melfold"  Thus it appears this was a Manor of the Saxon Kings and was the re∣sidence of King Edwin and his Queen Ethelburga after his conversion by Paulinus This Edwin was afterwards slain by Penda and Cedwall two Tributaries Ethelburga escaped to her brother Eadbald King of Kent by whom Paulinus was made Bishop of Rochester There are not the least remains of any considerable structure here or any thing to denote that a royal palace once existed on the spot  The ancient name of AdGebrin through the assistance of Mr Bry∣ant's etymologies also leads me to determine this was a royal resi∣dence and had one of those high places consecrated to the worship of the Sun  Ad  being in use for a supreme title with which both Dei∣ties and Kings were honoured among all the eastern nations  Ad  was a peculiar title and was originally conferred upon the  Sun  and if we may credit  Macrobius  it signified  one  and was so interpreted by the Assyrians In short  Ad  and  Ada  signified  first  and in a more lax sense  a Prince or Ruler  Kings xi Gen xxxvi Kings xx Nicolaus Damase apud Josephum Antiq L c Sam viii  From thence and the evidence of Bede it is clear the Saxon Kings resided at this place during some part of the Heptarchy  A research into antiquity naturally produces this effect that we ob∣tain testimonies of the derivation of our customs and an early visita∣tion by eastern nations which latter circumstance has rather been treated by authors as a fabulous matter or so obscured by tradition that it was little credited  In Mr Bryant's introductory preface he says  It has been observed by many of the learned that some particular family betook them∣selves very early to different parts of the world in all which they introduced their rights and religion together with the customs of their country They represent them as very knowing and enterprizing and with good reason They were the first who ventured upon the seas and took long voyages They shewed their superiority and address in the numberless expeditions which they made and the difficulties which they surmounted Many have thought that they were colonies from Egypt or from Phoenicia having a regard only to the settle∣ments which they made in the west But I shall shew hereafter that colonies of the same people are to be found in the most extreme parts of the east where we may observe the same rites and ceremonies and the same traditional histories as are to be met with in their other settlements The country called Phoenicia could not have suf∣ficed for the effecting all that is attributed to these mighty adventu∣rers It is necessary for me to acquaint the reader that the wonder∣ful people to whom I allude were the the descendants of  Chus  and called  Cuthites  and  Cuseans  They stood their ground at the general migration of families but were at last scattered over the face of the earth They were the first apostates from the truth yet great in worldly wisdom They introduced where ever they came many use∣ful arts and were looked up to as a superior order of beings hence they were stiled  Heroes Daemons Heliadae Macarians  They were joined in their expeditions by other nations especially by the colateral branches of their family the  Mizraim Caphtorim  and the sons of  Canaan  These were all of the line of  Ham  who was held by his posterity in the highest veneration They called him  Amon  and having in process of time raised him to a divinity they worshipped him as the Sun and from this worship they were styled  Amonians  This therefore will be the title by which I shall choose to distinguish the people of whom I treat when I speak of them collectively for under this denomination are included all of this family whether they were  Egyptians  or  Syrians  of  Phoenicia  or of  Canaan  To this I will add what a celebrated French author treating of the rise and progress of arts and sciences says touching the migrations of these Easterns to attempt at least a colourable proposition touching the time Britain re∣ceived those visitants if not a conclusive one  When we speak of the  Phoenicians  we must distinguish the times with accuracy These peo∣ple possessed originally a large extent of countries comprised under  the name of the land of  Canaan  They lost the greatest part of it by the conquests of the  Israelites  under  Joshua  The lands which fell in division to the tribe of  Asher  extended to  Sidon  that city notwith∣standing was not subdued If the conquests of  Joshua  took from the  Phaenicians  a great part of their dominion they were well paid by the consequences of that event In effect the greatest part of the ancient inhabitants of  Palestine  seeing themselves threatened with entire de∣struction had recourse to flight to save themselves  Sidon  offered them an asylum By this eruption of the Hebrew people the  Sido∣nians  were enabled to send colonies where ever they thought proper  Sidon  lent them ships and made good use of these new inhabitants to extend their trade and form settlements From hence that great number of colonies which went from  Phoenicia  to spread themselves in all the countries of  Africa  and  Europe  We may date this event about the year of the world and years before Christ  Spain  was not the only country beyond the  pillars of Hercules  which the  Phaenicians  penetrated Being familiarized with the navigation of the ocean they extended themselves to the left of the Straits of  Cadiz  as well as to the right  Strabo  assures us that these people had gone over a part of the western coast of  Africa  a little time after the war of  Troy  We might perhaps determine their passage into  England  by a reflection which the reading of the writers of antiquity furnishes us with they are persuaded that all the  Tin  that was consumed in the known world came from the Isles of  Cassitorides  and there is no doubt those Isles were the  Sorlingues  and a part of  Cornwall  We see by the books of  Moses  that in his time  Tin  was known in  Palestine Homer  teaches us also that they made use of this metal in the heroic ages It should follow then that the  Phaenicians  had traded in  Britain  in very remote antiquity  After giving the reader these opinions of two au∣thors highly distinguished in the literary world I must proceed to the application  Near  Yevering  is a place known by the name of  Yevering Bell  a lofty mountain one of the northwest Cheviots of an oblong figure arising to a cone The name is supposed by the inhabitants of the country to be derived from the figure of the hill and consequently as appli∣cable to any other of like form as this of which there are many among the Cheviots We ascended the mountain from  Yevering  by winding round its side to the south and east the only means of climbing to the top which was not attained without great labour from the steepness of  the ascent the height of the  Bell  being upwards perpendicular feet taken from the plain at  Yevering  The summit of the mountain is almost level encinctured with the remains of a wall placed on the brink of the steep which when entire was of considerable strength as appears from the materials The wall has been built without mortar of large flat stones with which the country abounds This wall forms and incloses an area of paces in circumference the entrance is on the south side The breadth of the ruins of the wall on a medium is eight yards and by the stones on the surface it may be computed that there are about four fothers of stones to the yard It astonishes the spectator on viewing these remains when he computes that fo∣thers of stones at least were employed in this erection and those borne by human hands to a place totally inaccessable by carriages or cattle bearing burthens It may be alledged indeed that in a plot of ground paces in circumference many stones might be won but the crown of the hill doth in no wise encourage such a conjecture the ground wearing altogether a natural countenance no rocks or quarries appearing within the area to furnish such a vast quantity of stone and where the turf is broken a small gravel appears The eastern end of the area rises some few feet from the level of the plain Taking our course by the wall before described at a point almost due east a broad way appeared three paces wide in a straight direction as if formed by an even pavement extending about yards in ascent towards the crown of the hill We found this eminence surrounded by the remains of another wall but consisting of fewer materials in an exact circle paces in circumference with a ditch within Near the center of this inner area rather inclining to the east is a kairn of stones of no very great height arising about paces in an easy ascent from the level of the inner wall The center of the kairn is hollow like a bason six paces from brim to brim After removing the turf and soil for a little depth we found the stones reduced to a sort of  calx  and every where retaining a strong impression of fire The view from this moun∣tain is very extensive it affords a prospect of near miles north∣ward into Scotland and over Northumberland many miles to the south∣east an opening of the mountains on that side and an extensive plain to the northward giving it that great command of prospect As a beacon hill it was fortunately placed as a place of heathenish worship it was conspicuous from many points of view where the sacrificial rites might be discovered and thereby the people called to worship On the northern side of the mountain are the remains of a forest  or extensive grove of oaks a circumstance not to be found or at least not discovered by us on any of the hills within view from the summit of Yevering Bell On many parts of the sides of the hill are the remains of circular buildings but now so totally ruined and the stones so scattered that their former consequence or use are not to be discovered little more than the form of the foundations remaining Several of them I took to be no other than folds for enclosing a number of sheep or cattle the ruins not containing materials sufficient for any large erection  Mr Wallis a account of this remarkable place is loose and unsatisfactory  About two hundred yards west from this Column is a high hill called Yevering Bell from its belllike shape the top of an oblong figure a Kairn on the east side with a circular Trench many circular foundations of buildings upon the sides or slopes of both the whole encompassed with a Wall of Whinstone of a great breadth and length fallen down by age and tempests the work seemingly of the Pagan Danes for their Priestoood and Nobles to assemble on for legislation for devotion and sepulture  The works on this mount appear to me of very remote antiquity and in attempting to explain their nature I will consider them singly and furnish the reader with all the lights I have collected as I presume they are so singular as to attract the attention of travellers who may hereafter traverse this country in search of antiquities In the first place we will consider this object in the manner it would naturally call for a stranger's attention It cannot be conceived from the loftiness of the mountain the extreme difficulty of access the coldness of that high region and the inclemency of weather it is naturally subject to to have been used as a place of strength from these natural causes also it is not probable it should be used as a place for securing cattle and flocks against the incursions of an enemy it may reasonably from its very nature be admitted to be used for religious offices If used as a beacon only then whence the necessity of these circumvallations It has been conceived by some  Mr Wallis in his Antiquities of Northumberland  that it was possessed by the Danes and that these works appertained to that people who here held their civil and religious conventions Kairns placed on such immense eminences if marks of sepulture must denote the place of interment of remarkable personages and those too who did not die by the sword for the uni∣versal custom of the ancient inhabitants of this land who raised a tu∣mulus over the dead appears to have been that of interring them where they were slain The circular buildings if appropriations to the admi∣nistration of justice must have been adapted to several and separate ministers a thing scarcely probable If to the ministring of religious  rites or to sepulture then indeed the inconsistency ceases The interior circumvallation appears calculated for the exclusion of the vulgar from the principal scene of religious rites where the priests and chief perso∣nages only ministred The wall which forms the grand enclosure of the whole crown of the mountain includes acres and a half or very near it and would contain a prodigious number of people  In this wild and mountainous country the names and marks of an∣tiquity have escaped those changes which naturally follow cultiva∣tion and it is in such parts we are to search for the evidences of the most remote antiquity existing in this kingdom It is certain the Druids though they built temples and paid their adoration towards the Sun always retained such distinction in their worship that they looked up to the great Luminary as the Throne or as the symbol and archetype only of the Divinity which they confessed created and go∣verned the universe and was the sole spirit of existence It will not follow that this purity was retained by all the inhabitants of the same land or the same mode of worship gained an universal acceptation among them many appointed for themselves places for private adora∣tion and these eminences were most assuredly the chosen spots for de∣votees who paying their worship to the Sun might loss the symbolical character and confounded with ignorance and superstition forget the archetype for the object The name of  Bel  authorizes me to presume this place was sacred to the Sun it being derived from the  Chaldean  language and signifying the Sun Mr Bryant says  many worshipped upon hills and on the tops of high mountains imagining that they thereby obtained a nearer communication with heaven This prac∣tice in early times was almost universal and every mountain was esteemed holy The people who retired to eminences fancied that they were brought into the vicinity of the powers of the air and the Deity who resided in the higher regions But the chief excellence for which they were frequented was the  Omphi  the  Vox divina  being esteemed a particular revelation from heaven In short they looked upon them as the peculiar places where God delivered his oracles The word  Omphi  signifying the  Oracle of Ham  who according to the  Egygtian theology  was the same as the  Sun  or  Osiris  he was likewise revered as the chief Deity of the  Chaldeans  and by most of the nations of the East  Having thus shewn the choice made by the Ancients of high places for their adoration I will next consider the name of this place according to the  etymologies  laid down by Mr Bryant  Bel Bal  or  Baal  is a  Babylonish  title appropriated to the  Sun  and made use of by the  Amonians  in other countries particularly in  Syria  and  Canaan  It signified  or  Lord  and is often found compounded with other terms as  BelHamon  and also  BelShamaim  the  great Lord of the heavens  This was a title given by the  Syrians  to the  Sun  By  Gib  is meant an hill  Gibeon  was the hill of the  Sun Nadab  the son of  Jereboam  was slain at  GibEthon  of the  Philistines  Kings xv  So that BelGebrin is no forced reduction of the present name of  Yevering Bel  or according to the more ancient name  BeladGebron  and denominates  the mount of the Sun  As to the kairn which I mentioned to be situate on the eastern point of the area on the crown of the mount which is a conical pile termi∣nating obtusely and basoned as before described I presume its name to be derived from  Keren  which according to Mr Bryant signifies in its original sense  a Horn  but it was a title of the  Sun  himself for  Apollo  was named  Carneus  which was no other than  Cereneus  the  supreme Deity  the  Lord of Light  The Priest of  Cybele  in  Phrygia  was stiled  Carnas  which was a title of the Deity whom he served  Whence it is deducible that our  kairn  on the summit of this mount was the place of the altar where religious rites were performed in the fire worship And the like may be conceived of all those conical mounts called  kairns  they being a corruption of "  Kiron  the place of the  Sun  " In forming these  kairns  as well the present one as others we visited in this neighbourhood and one in particular on the crown of one of the highest mountains above  Newton  called  Newton West Tor  the stones must have been carried up by a multitude of hands with immense la∣bour Suppose by the dimensions of one of these  kairns  which mea∣sured near paces in circumference that there was contained therein carriage loads of pebbles we will find the computation of labour and hands to be immense for the construction thereof when all the materials must be borne two miles of steep ascent to this amazing accu∣mulation I was induced to believe I should discover some hearth stone or altar on the crown of some of the  kairns  but was disappointed Per∣haps time and the abhorrence which grew up with Conversion against the rites of the heathen had removed the superstructure if any such there had been There was not one of the  kairns  I visited had the re∣gular  hollow bason but that on the  Bell  which was exactly circular but composed of stones of a small size as far as I searched On my view I was immediately persuaded that all these accumulations called  kairns  situated on mountains and high places had not proceeded from a pas∣sion of honouring the dead but were formed by zealots who attending their worship carried with them progressively a burthen to add to the grandeur loftiness and immensity of the sacred place where they paid their adoration The  kairn  on  Yevering  is to the  east  an object regarded in the structures of the ancient Britons in the remotest antiquity and by the Easterns in erections of the like use These places have re∣tained their ancient forms and their first names uncorrupted by reason of the mountainous nature of the country Where cultivation cannot advance things of this sort must rest for ages unchanged it has been the case here Besides the inhabitants are few and those subsisting on the extreme verge of poverty hourly employed in procuring a scanty subsistence Add to this the depopulations which war for many ages occasioned would prevent those alterations which take place in times of peace Mr Bryant says  The people of  Cappadocia and Pontus  ob∣served the like method of worship and of all sacrifices whatever ex∣hibited upon high places none perhaps ever equalled in magnificence that which was offered by Mithridates upon his war with the Ro∣mans He followed the  Persic  modes of worship as well as the mixed rites of the  Chaldeans and Syrians  Hence he chose one of the highest mountains in his dominions upon the top of which he reared an immense pile equal in size to the summit on which it stood and there he sacrificed to the God of  Armies  The pile was raised by his vassal Princes and the offerings besides those customary were  wine honey oil  and every species of  aromatics  The fire is said to have been perceived at the distance of near a thousand stadia  So much must suffice on this point and in this place from innumerable in∣stances produced by this learned author  My next enquiry will be touching the circumvallation which appears on  Yevering Bell  to shew that this was a practice with the Ancients on their consecrated hills Mr Bryant says  The  Helladians  and the  Persians  were of the same family hence we find many similar rites subsisting among the two nations The latter adhered to the purer  Zabaism  which they maintained a long time They erected the same sacred  Tupha  or Tumulus as the  Grecians  and we may be assured of the original purpose for which these hills were raised from the use to  which they put them They were dedicated to  the great Fountain of Light  called by the  Persians Anait  and were set apart as  puratheia  for the celebration of the rites of  fire  This people after they had defeated the  Sacae  in  Cappadocia  raised an immense  Comah  in memo∣rial of their victory  Strabo  Lib p  who describes it very minutely tells us that they chose a convenient spot where they reared a  Petra  or  high place  by heaping up a vast mound of earth This they fashioned to  a conical figure  and then surrounded it  with a wall of stone  In this manner they founded a temple in honour of  Anait  I have men∣tioned that the  Egyptians  had hills of this nature and from them the custom was transmitted to  Greece  The circular buildings mentioned to appear on the sides of the mount will be the last objects which require my attention before I draw my general conclusion I confess they did not appear to me so remarkable as to require taking any admeasurement but they are spoken of by Mr Wallis as being very singular and as I did not traverse all the sides of the mountain perhaps those of greater consequence escaped my ob∣servation but conceiving that they may be marks of antiquity among other matters I will trespass upon the reader with descriptions of those circular buildings in the northern parts of this island which have been visited by learned travellers and perhaps some future visitor of the Cheviots may be induced to make a narrower search and more correct investigation But before I proceed thereto I will consider some others of Mr Bryant's opinions which relate generally to my subject of  Yever∣ing Bell  and particularly to the circular remains  Mr Bryant informs  that these mounts were not only in  Greece  but in  Egypt Syria  and most parts of the world They were ge∣nerally formed by art being composed of earth raised very high which was sloped gradually and with great exactness and the top of all was crowned with  a fair tower  The situation of these build∣ings made them be looked upon as places of great safety and the reverence in which they were held added to the security On these accounts they were the repositories of much wealth and treasure in times of peril they were crowded with things of value In  Assyria  was a temple named  Azara  which the  Parthian  plundered and is  said to have carried off ten thousand talents To such as these  Solomon  alludes when he makes his beloved say  'I am a wall and my breasts like towers'  Though the word  Cumah  or  Comah  be generally ren∣dered a wall yet I should think that in this place it signified the ground which the wall surrounded an inclosure sacred to  Cham  the  Sun  who was particularly worshipped in such places Another pas∣sage in  Solomon 'We have a little sister and she hath no breasts If she be a Comah we will build upon her a palace of silver'  What is then termed a wall was a  Comah  or  high place  which had been of old erected to the  Sun  by the  Jebusites  The ground set apart for such use was generally  oval  and towards one extremity of the long dia∣meter as it were in the focus were these  mounds and towers  erected For there were many of these  towers  where they taught  astronomy music  and other  sciences  These places were likewise  courts of judica∣ture  where justice was administred  In Mr Pennant's Voyage to the Hebrides we have the following ac∣counts of erections of this kind near Inverness  Visit the celebrated edifices attributed to the  Danes  the first is placed about two miles from the mouth of the valley of  Glen Elg  The more entire side ap∣pears of a most elegant taper form the present height is thirty feet six inches but in some Goth purloined from the top seven feet and a half under pretence of applying the materials to certain public buildings By the appearance of some ruins that now lie at the base and which have fallen off since that time I believe three feet more may be added to the height which will make the whole about fortyone feet  The whole is built with dry walls but the courses most beautifully disposed On one side is a breach of at least one quarter of the cir∣cumference The diameter within is thirtythree feet and a half taken at the distance of ten feet from the bottom the wall in that part is seven feet four inches thick but is formed thinner and thinner till it reaches the top whose breadth I forgot to cause to be measured The inside wall is quite perpendicular so that the inner diameter must have been equal from top to bottom but the exterior wall slopes increasing in thickness till it reaches the ground  In the thickness of the wall were two galleries one at the lower part about six feet two inches high and two feet five wide at the bot∣tom  narrowing to the top flagged and also covered over with great flat stones This gallery ran quite round and that horizontally but was divided into apartments in one place with six flags placed equidistant from each other and were accessible above by means of a hole from another gallery Into the lower were two entrances before the ruin of the other side there had been two others above each of these en∣trances were a row of holes running up to the top divided by flags appearing like shelves near the top was a circle of projecting stones which probably were intended to hold the beams that formed the roof above is another hole like the former None of these openings pass through for there is not the least appearance of window or open∣ing on the outside wall All these holes are square are too small to admit the human body so were probably designed to lodge arms and different other matters secure from wet or harm  Over the first gallery was another divided from it only by flags This also went round but was free from any separation the height was five feet six only twenty inches wide at bottom This was also covered with flags at top  At a distance above in the broken sides of the wall was another hole but it seemed too small for a gallery The ascent was not safe so could not venture up The height was taken by a little boy who scrambled to the top  The entrance was a square hole on the west side before it were the remains of some building with a narrow opening that led to the door Almost contiguous to this entrance or portico was a small circle formed of rude stones which was called the foundation of the Druids houses It probably was formed for some religious purpose I was told there were many others of this kind scattered over the valley  At less than a quarter of a mile distant from this stands the second tower on a little flat on the side of the hill The form is similar but the number of galleries differs here are three the lowest goes entirely round but at the east end is an aperture now of small depth but once of such extent that the goats which sheltered in it were often lost on that account the entrance was filled with stones This is six feet high four feet two inches broad and flagged above and below  A second gallery was of the same height but the breadth of the floor only three feet five  The third gallery was of such difficult access that I did not at∣tempt to get up it was so narrow and so low that it was with diffi∣culty that the child who climbed to it could creep through  The present height of this tower is only twentyfour feet five inches the diameter thirty the thickness of the lower part of the wall twelve feet four  I could not perceive any traces of the winding stairs mentioned by Mr Gordon but these buildings have suffered greatly since that gen∣tleman saw them I have no doubt of his accuracy  These were in all probability places of defence but it is difficult to say any thing on the subject of their origin or by what nation they were erected They are called here  Caisteal Teilbali  or the  Castle of Teilba  built by a mother for her four sons as tradition delivered in this translation of four Erse lines informs  "My four sons a fair clan  "I left in the straith of one Glen  "My Malcomb my lovely Conil  "My Telve my Troddan  There had been two others now totally demolished and each named after her children Mr Gordon mentions others of this kind one of which is called the  Dune  of  Dornadilla  from an imaginary Prince who reigned years before the christian aera  By a paragraph some time ago in Lloyd's Evening Post and from a note given by Mr Pennant which he says he had from the Edinburgh Magazine this place is described part of which I will transcribe as pertinent to my present object  The entrance is a very low and narrow door to pass through which one is obliged to stoop much but perhaps the ground may have been raised since the first erection When one is got in and placed in the center it is open over head All round the sides of the walls are ranged stone shelves one above another like the shelves in a circular  beaufet reaching from near the bottom to the top There is some remains of an awkward staircase Some years since I happened at an auction of books in London to look into a French book contain∣ing Gaulish Antiquities and there I saw a print of the remains of a Druidic temple in France which greatly resembles the tower I am speaking of having like shelves in it And reading a late pamphlet on the antiquity of the Irish language I think I can partly trace the origin of the name DornadillaDorn means a round stone so that Abdorn would mean the round stone of the priests na is of and Di is God ulla means a place of devotion so that Dornadiulla will signify the round stone place of the worship of God or perhaps it might allude to some round stone preserved within as a sacred em∣blem of Divinity  From the whole of these quotations I would determine that by the name of  Yevering Bell  or  BeladGebrin  is implied  a sacred mount  con∣secrated to the adoration of the  Sun  and used in fire worship Of this the  kairn  is a corroborating proof The circumvallation shews by its similarity to those spoken of that the persons who used this mount for their religious rites derived those rites from the same source as those quoted and fixes the antiquity of  Yevering Bell  to very remote ages It is a point not to be doubted that  Yevering  for some time was the resi∣dence of the  Saxon Kings  in the Heptarchy If we should carry the an∣tiquity of  Yevering Bell  no further we will find its appropriation then to religious offices as probable as in a more distant antiquity The Saxons brought with them many Eastern customs they worshipped the  Sun  had their  high places  and rites of  fire worship  and sacrifice As to my own judgment I should be inclined to fix the antiquity of this place to their aera The  Druid tribes  have left us such imperfect evi∣dence of their customs that it is impossible to fix any thing positively there It is even most probable this was of  Saxon origin  from its vi∣cinity to the royal residence and the greatness of the work The cir∣cular buildings have never been fixed to any particular people their constructors still remain undiscovered The circles of ruins on the sides of  Yevering Bell  may have been similar to those visited by Mr Pennant it is probable these circular erections were the towers of the priests who there taught the principles of their religion and the elements of natural philosophy and that there they stored up the treasures of the country in times of public danger which from the veneration paid by all peo∣ple to those sacred places were inviolable Besides they were well cal∣culated  for defence upon assault The circles formed by rude and un∣hewn stones found in many parts of the North have been regarded by all Antiquaries as places of public convocation where justice was dis∣pensed The number of stones might denote the tribes or districts un∣der the care of each Druid as the Israelites numbered their tribes by such columns at the passage of Jordan  At a little distance from the  Bell  to the southward is a large  kairn  of stones called  Tom Tallon's Grave  but who this personage was no his∣tory informs us  Some mountains near  Yevering  have the names of  Newton East and West Tor  On one of them is a  kairn  of stones also on the western point of  Cheviot  and on a mount called  Whitlau  all in view of each other These  Tors  are said by several authors to be held by the  Saxons  sacred to  Jupiter  Mr Bryant's remarks are  Tor  is an  hill  or  tower  They were called by the  Amonians  who first erected them  Tar  and  Tor  the same as the  of the  Chaldeans  which signified both a  hill  and  tower  The words  Tar Tor  and  Tarit  shew that they implied  temples  and dedications to the  Sun  He instances many facts to prove this position among which are  Toron  a place in  Macedonia  literally signifying the  tower of the Sun  Also  Tirit  of the same sig∣nification and  Torambi  the  oracular tower of Ham  He has in another place this sentence  I will therefore say so much in further∣ance of the  British Antiquarian  as to inform him that names of places especially of hills promontories and rivers are of long du∣ration and suffer little change The same may be said of every thing which was esteemed at all sacred such as temples towers and high mounds of earth which in early times were used for altars  And in another place  There was another name current among the  Amo∣nians  by which they called their  or  high places  This was  Taph  which at times was rendered  Tuph Toph  and  Taphos  The  Amonians  when they settled in  Greece  raised many  Tupha  in different parts but as it was usual in ancient times to bury persons of distinction under heaps of earth formed in this fashion these  Tapha  came to sig∣nify  tombs  and almost all the  sacred mounds  built for religious pur∣poses were looked upon as monuments of deceased heroes  of which he gives many instances  I have dwelt too long on this subject though an interesting one to those who may hereafter visit these places  I must not quit this country without remarking that as we advanced towards the boundary of the kingdoms the hills were cloathed with a singular verdure affording fine sheep walks and the flocks and herds were numerous The cottages of the lower class of people are deplorable composed of upright timbers fixed in the ground the interstices wattled and plaistered with mud the roofs some thatched and others covered with turf one little piece of glass to admit the beams of day and a hearth stone on the ground for the peat and turf fire Within there was ex∣hibited a scene to touch the feelings of the heart description sickens on the subject and a tear of pity blots out the moving line which strives to depict I wished for some of the discontented great ones who palled with luxury despise their palaces to change the scene for a little just time sufficient to gain conviction that the cottager and crowned head are both of one specie of animals and of one race The damp earth the naked rafters the breezedisturbed embers and distracted smoke that issues from the hearth moved by contrary blasts breaking through a thousand crannies the midday gloom the wretched couch the wooden utensils that scarce retain the name of convenience the do∣mestic beast that stalls with its master the disconsolate poultry that mourn on the rafters form a group of objects for a great man's con∣templation  The inhabitants are of abject countenance and miserably cloathed seeming to confess the lowest degree of poverty The employment of the men is in the field most of them are shepherds or herdsmen The corn land which is very little in quantity compared with the meadows and grazing grounds lays mingled with the other over the open faces of the vales without any fences to protect which many an indolent herdsman stands for hours wrapped up in his plaid hanging over a staff half animated or otherwise laying prostrate upon the ground During the time he is engaged in this duty if he had a spade put in his hand and was broke into the rules of industry he might be most usefully employed he could fence the ground which he tends in the time he spends in herding it but evil customs when they correspond with habitual indolence are as hard to be eradicated as to move a mountaina long series of applications and labour and the redoubled effects of example and experience must effect it In consequence of this stupid custom the farmer is necessarily obliged to keep a multitude of servants Their wages are paid in the products of the landgrain  wool maintenance of sheep and cattle very few money payments be∣ing used  From the openness of the country the traveller is consequently per∣plexed with cross roads where not a guidepost has been known since the creation to remedy this evil intelligence must be gained from one of these herds and it is remarkable that there is a ferocity and un∣cultivated fullenness of mind in those twolegged animals which scarce confesses civilization enough to direct a stranger on his way When you obtain instructions it is in a manner as he would chace a beast from trespass I cannot forbear comparing the countenance of the lower class of English in the northern counties with that of the ScotchI do not draw my remarks solely from my present tour but through observations made in many little pleasure jaunts in ScotlandThough you perceive the most abject poverty in the lowest rank of the Scotch peo∣ple yet even under those weeds of distress there is seen a singular open∣ness and benevolence of countenance By some it may be objected that this arises from their servility and these are no other than feigned looks of submission Arise from what it will such countenance carries more of the character of humanity than the proud sternness and brutal in∣solence which mark those who boast a savage liberty But it is to be observed that servility stamps the countenance with abject timidity which is not written on the Scotch featuresa generous nature and the liberality of a mind enlarged with education are rather the givers of such openness and benevolence of look Almost every Scotch village is blessed with a free school You will find shepherds on the Scotch hills familiar with the poets and historians of Rome and Greece such familiarity introduces an adoption of principles and sentiments and from thence we see in these poor people the maxims of mind which graced the illustrious names of old Can we wonder then at the despa∣rity there appears in the lower class of the two nationsBut there is another source from whence a part of this complaisancy and hospitality of the lower Scotch may be deduced they are strict in their religious principles they are punctual attendants on public worship they hold with great sacredness their observance of the Sabbath day most of their pastors are not only rigid in their example but arduous in their duty and administration amongst the people there is a just sense conceived even in the lowest minds of man's duty to his God The reverse is so con∣spicuous in the English that the comparison is scarce required So far from perceiving a religious principle in the lower classes some of them  have not even been informed of their Redeemer thousands have never entered a place of worship the Sabbath is distinguished only as a day of idleness in which gaming and drinking are pursued many of the teachers of the gospel with an indolence and aversion apparent in their whole carriage perform as a stale and stupid task the offices of the church Men are influenced by example evil example contaminates the most where the minds are most illiterate weak men take many of their vices by adoption if it were not for our new sectaries our ram∣bling preachers the name of God would not be promulged to onetenth part of England's inhabitants It is true they teach his laws as the laws of the God of terrors it is better they should administer to him with the horrors of hell than there be no ministry We have reformed the church till we have expelled the spirit of prayer we have refined the pulpit till nothing but the grace of declamation remains and our church manners are polished into that exquisite insipidity that if it were not for tithes the major part of the parish would forget the holy men of God  KIRK NEWTON  lay next in our way a small village one of the Manors of the Barony of Wark the ancient residence of the Strothers  Sir Henry Strother King Edward II  William Strother King Edward VI  Mark Strother High Sheriff King George I  Wallis  now the property of John Strother Ker  Esq  Opposite to Kirk Newton is  The CASTLE of COPELAND  now the possession of the Rev Dr Newton Ogle It was the ancient re∣sidence of the Wallaces  Edward Wallace King Edward II  William Queen Elizabeth  George King James I  Wallis  and was possessed by Edward Wallace in the reign of King Edward II in whose family it continued till of late years  Within a little distance of Copeland three remarkable battles were fought the one on the plains of  Milfield  where a body of the Scotch  were defeated before the battle of Branxton by  Sir William Bulmer of Brancepeth  who commanded the forces of the Bishoprick of Durham The Scots lay in ambush among the broom which then covered the plain  Milfield  now a little village was the residence of the Saxon Kings of  Bernicia  after the death of  Edwin  Another battle was fought at a place called  Haltwell Sweire  where  Sir Henry Percy  brother to the sixth Earl of Northumberland was de∣feated in the fifth year of the reign of Queen Mary by a troop of the Scots under the command of the  Earl of Bothwell  consisting of horse Percy's cavalry were thrown into confusion by a discharge of fire arms to which they were not well trained  The third battle was at Broomridge  The place of this battle is treated with great uncertainty by many authors the name used by  Fordun  is  Brunauburgh Camden  from its similarity fixes it at  Broomrigs  The many lines breastworks and intrenchments testify that this was the place of some great action  where a confusion of lines and intrenchments are yet to be seen Here  Athelstan  engaged the united forces of  Constantine  King of  Scotland Eugenius Oweine  or  Ewaine  King of  Cumberland  and  Anlap  the  Dane  in the year and gained a com∣pleat victory though with the loss of  Elwin  and  Athalstan  his kinsmen men of great valour  Constantine  escaped into Scotland  Anlaf  took re∣fuge in Dublin but what became of  Ewaine  is not mentioned It is presumed this  Ewaine  is interred in Penrith churchyard his sepulchre denoted by a very singular monument there This victory was greatly celebrated by Henry of Huntington William of Malmsbury and Ingulph  Mailross  being the seminary from whence sprang the first Bishop of the See of  Lindisfarn  which constitutes so material a part of the church antiquities of this county and as the great patron saint the holy  St Cuthbert  was educated there and from thence brought to  Lindisfarn  it seemed of consequence that I should view the seat from whence issued so much to exercise my attention in the remaining part of the tour I had thus far prosecuted I determined to visit  Mailross  and passed the village of  Paston  formerly belonging to the family of Selbys On an adjoining hill called the Harelaw the name implying the sta∣tion of an army is a circular intrenchment with a double rampier and  foss From thence there is a fine prospect of the vale where it gave us great pleasure to observe the new modes of husbandry taking place turnips cultivated in drill sowing with horse and hand hoeing prac∣tised There is a very great want of fences in this part of the coun∣try habit and custom are only to be subdued by time and example  After passing some few miles beyond the boundary of the kingdoms and gaining an eminence above  Tweeddale  we had a view of  Kelso  and the rich extensive vale which borders the river Having travelled near miles in the rude and mountainous country from  Wooler  where we seldom had in sight a cultivated valley or fertile tract of any conse∣quence except at  Paston  or the plain of  Milfield  but all the mighty scene was filled with stupendous mountains on whose summits rested an incessant gloom and driving rain and after climbing those lofty steeps in search of evidences of antiquity and traversing boundless wastes the present prospect gave us unusual pleasure The vale before us abounded in corn and the extended scene possessed all the variety that nature exhibits the distant grounds were lifted up in a wild arrangement of mountains By the margin of the river the yellow fields were so mixed with the meads as to resemble flowers of gold wrought on the green robe of happy Tweed Few fences subdivide the vale but here and there fine woods are scattered before us lay the delightful town of Kelso on the left hand a cultivated country through which the Tweed flows in meanders on whose banks Sir John Douglas's and the palace of the Duke of Roxburgh with their exten∣sive woodlands are beautifully disposed The Helton Mountains three fine conic eminences form obelisks at the distance of miles up the vale over which and on each side mountains behind mountains are seen not united but distinctly surging from little valleys which open around their bases then glowing with streams of yellow light This hue was delicately mellowed by the azure tinge of the hills which formed the horizon The same mountainous ground was in the distant prospect in front only differing in this that the eye penetrated the cul∣tivated vales at the feet of the hills which stand at a much greater distance from each other and did not appear thrown together as in the longer line of perspective To the right we viewed the seat of Dr Johnston embowered in thick woods Down the river the vale is more contracted and less distant prospect was taken in the town of Coldstream was distinctly viewed with a multitude of inferior villages above which the seat of Lord Hume with the rising plantations around  KELSOE ABBEY  it fill the inclining ground I never beheld a richer valley than we looked upon here the crops of corn were surprizingly great the whole being reaped stood in sheafs the meadows were luxuriant and every object wore the happy aspect of opulence  We constantly regretted the want of fences in this tour they would give a great grace to the banks of Tweed by intersecting the rich scene The advantage they would be of to the country is obvious they would check the severities of winter and resist that raking blast which when unopposed shears the extensive grounds wherever it passes in the spring of the year consequently they would forward the progress of summer  We descended to the town of  KELSO  which lays on the northern banks of Tweed and to which we had ac∣cess by a fine stone bridge of six arches  From the southern banks of the river the town with its invirons has the most picturesque appearance where I stood to observe its beauties I had the bridge on my right an excellent though plain structure of modern work stretching across a fine river of transparent water gently curling over a pebbly channel On the opposite shore which is banked in stands the modern and elegant Mansion of Mrs Dixon a widow Lady a square hewnstone structure placed in the midst of a garden opening to the river ornamented with a small Gothic temple a green∣house and stove with statues disposed on the grass plots which were intersected with gravel walks and flower knots Over this modern and fashionable scene an august pile in all the solemnity of ruin frowns majesticallyan old abbey stands near this mansion a lofty structure built in the heaviest of the Gothic ordertwo round towers of the south limb of the cross surmounted by a part of the center tower formed the aspect on which we looked the windows are small and the whole edifice gloomy  It is strange what dissimilar ideas sometimes strike the imagination as I gazed upon this scene I said to myself Thus Charactacus in the great reverse of his fortune looked with contempt on the pageantry and pomp of his Roman conquerors There could not be a finer contrast  than in these two structures The town of Kelso crowded the back ground of our prospect To the left the view opened upon the vale terminated by the noble woods which adjoin the seat of the Duke of Roxburgh to the right through the arches of the bridge were seen fine perpen∣dicular rocks crowned with stately trees on the river's brink  We entered Kelso which is clean and well built Mr Pennant says it is much after the manner of a Flemish town It hath a spacious square marketplace with a townhouse piazza'd beneath for the con∣venience of the market the number of inhabitants about the weekly market considerable vast quantities of corn being sold here though chiefly by sample The Inn was elegant the people obliging and the attendants particularly alert and condescending  Kelso is a borough of the Duke of Roxburgh and is governed by his Bailiff It is not remarkable for any great manufactory or trade but appears to be the place of residence of many people of easy fortune Some part of the great stocks of wool furnished by this country is ma∣nufactured here into cloths called plains but dressed in England There is also a manufacture of white leather for the Edinburgh market  The monastery here was founded by King David During his brother Alexander's reign he had brought over from Tyrone in France cer∣tain Monks of a reformed order founded by Bernard d'Abbeville a man of high reputation for sanctity and severity of life these he settled first at Selkirk with an ample revenue afterwards making Roxburgh his residence he removed his favourite Monks thither and when he came to the Crown built for them the abbey and monastery of Kelso and fixed them there on the d of May having dedicated the church to the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist Bernard the founder of this order was a disciple of Robert d'Arbrisser founder of the order of Fontevraud which by a constitution almost peculiar to it∣self consisted of both Monks and Nuns and had an Abbess to govern the society Bernard founded the monastery of Tyrone in the year from which place his disciples derived their name The habit of the Tyronensian Monks was a light grey but was afterwards changed to black Fordun positively says these Monks settled at Selkirk in but Symeon of Durham that they were not placed there till and remained fifteen years According to Fordun the succession of Abbots was as follows Ralph one of the Monks brought over from France  was the first Abbot but on the death of Bernard returned to succeed him in the Abbacy of Tyrone William succeeded to Selkirk and on the death of Ralph also returned to Tyrone as successor to that Ab∣bacy Herbert succeeded William and was the first Abbot of Kelso It is presumed that David who was a lover of the fine arts as well as a patron of every national improvement had in view on his importing this colony from France not only the advancement of religion but also that of arts and sciences of which his subjects were in great need of cultivation their only occupations from the remotest ages having been the duty of shepherds and the service of the sword In the History of the Monastic Orders we find that Bernard the founder of the Tyro∣nensians would have all sorts of handicrafts practised in his monastery as well to prevent the growth of idleness which he esteemed the mother of vice as to procure necessaries for the support of life Accordingly in this body were painters carvers joiners smiths masons vinedressers and husbandmen who were under the command of an Elder and what they earned was put into a common stock for the mainte∣nance of the house Kelso afterwards sent forth colonies to the foun∣dations of Lismahago Kilwinning Aberbrothick and Lindores  This abbey was demolished in  Leslie lib p Monasteria Dunfernlingense Melrosense Kelsorum miseris

hitherto always appeared in the form of a zealot full of fanatic fury with violence subduing but through madness creating almost as many mischiefs in its oversights as it overthrew errors in its pursuit Reli∣gion has received a greater shock by the present struggle to repress some formularies and save some scruples than it ever did by the growth of superstition She now bleeds inwardly thinking men are driven into confusion and the unthinking turn infidelsthese are the glorious works of modern fanaticism  The abbey of Kelso was built in the form of a Greek cross the nave and quire are totally demolished the north and south ailes remain standing being each about paces in length The walls are orna∣mented with false round arches intersecting each other the remains of the eastern end shew a part of a fine open gallery Two sides of the  center tower are standing now near feet high but have been much more lofty it is galleried within the pillars are clustered the arches circular with few members and without any great ornament The  north and south ends have an uniformity bearing each two round towers the centers rising sharp to the roof the north door way is formed by a circular arch with various members falling behind each other sup∣ported on pilasters the windows and work above very plain Three bells now hang in the uppermost windows this part of the nave having lately been used for divine service We did but just look into it all pomp was utterly eradicated and every degree of pageantry defaced The windows of this abbey are of circular arches and remarkably small the whole mode of architecture singular and unlike any structure I re∣member to have seen in England the walls are thick and every where ponderous There is a Gothic gloominess throughout the whole that carries the appearance of a prison rather than a house of prayer and yet these ruins have a countenance of sullen solemnity which mingling with the beautiful scene around has a grand effect  The revenues of this religious house amounted to l per annum Scots and arose in money payments the Abbot was allowed to wear a mitre and pontifical robes to be exempt from episcopal jurisdiction and permitted to be present in all general councils It was at first under the Bishoprick of St Andrews but afterwards made a member of the See of Glasgow it had several immunities and the Abbot and Monks had liberty to receive ordination and the other sacraments of the church from any Bishop they pleased in Scotia or Cumbria  By Innes's Critical Essay this Camb  ia is construed to be the See of Glasgow for reasons too tedious to insert here  King Malcolm in granted a confirmatory charter to this abbey the witnesses to which are remarkable  "The three Bishops of Glascow Murray and Dunkeld

week These are founded not on the sordid principles of gaming or dissipation or fraud but on the beautiful basis of benevolence and with the amiable view of conciliating the affections of two nations where the good and the bad common to every place are only divided by a rill scarcely to be distinguished but prejudice for a time could find no merit but within its own narrow bourn Some enlarged minds however deter∣mined to break the fascination of erroneous opinion to mix with their fellow subjects and to instruct both the great vulgar and the small that the northern and southern bounders of

a Percy and a Dou∣glas may now be seen hand in hand the example of charity spreads and may it spread with all its sweet influences to the remotest corner of our island  What pleasing times to those

mistress of a castle has presented her sons with their spurs to remind them that their larder was  empty and that by a  forray  they must supply it at the expence of the borderers when every evening the sheep were taken from the hills and the cattle from their pasture to be secured in the lower floor from robbers prowling like wolves of prey and the disappointed thief found all in safety from the

England and King Robert III of Scotland A D a truce was concluded here which was of consi∣derable duration by the Commissioners of both realms  In King James III of Scotland was crowned at Kelso when the nobles paid their homage and swore fealty to the new Sovereign  In the English in a sudden incursion pillaged and burnt Kelso but were soon repelled by the forces of Mers and Tiviotdale This  spoil is attributed to Lord Dacres and some authors say he burnt villages in that expedition and overthrew stone built towers with all their bulwarks  In the reign of King Henry VIII A D the Duke of Norfolk advancing to the Scotch borders burnt and levelled with the ground places of considerable note in Scotland among which was Kelso with its abbey  In Sir Ralph Eure carried fire and sword to the banks of Tweed and destroyed the tenements in Kelso which had been reedified since the former devastation  The detail of mutual cruelties and savage spoil is horriblethey were a disgrace to human nature  There was a convent of  Red Friars  at the mouth of Tiviot near Kelso but who was its founder or what was its revenue is not known  Spotswood's History of the Church of Scotland  As I have had occasion to speak of the Scotch church and as church tyranny south of the Tweed is exclaimed against with violence and in∣dignation it may not be disagreeable to the reader to see how our neighbours the Scotch are in that matter amidst all their boasted puri∣tanism In my notes I shall give a short state of facts which came to a solemn hearing before the Presbytery this present year  The case arose between a Dr John Wotherspoon and some gentlemen of the town of Paisley These gentlemen had passed a few hours together in a private room over a social glass It hap∣pened that this was the day preceding the celebration of the sacrament which gave a handle to the Doctor to take offence He accordingly called them before his Kirk Session but in place of libelling them for drunkenness he accused them of some scandalous indecencies ap∣proaching even to prophanity and while this action was pendent and before any proof was heard and even before some of the gentlemen accused had appeared before the Session he thought proper to mount his pulpit and issue forth in the shape of a sermon a most dreadful f  l  ination in which he adjured his bearers by the most solemn ties to have no communica∣tion or fellowship with such pointed them out as objects of popular resentment and concluded with the Apostle's advice to his followers  Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them  He next proceeded to make proofs before the Sessions which did not at all appear to support the accusation However a majority of the Session con∣curred in a sentence  ordering the gentlemen to appear before the face of the congregation to receive his public rebuke and referred to the Presbytery what public censure should be in∣flicted  The gentlemen did not choose  o submit to this public discipline especially from their violent persecutor but appealed to the Presbytery who after full hearing and great deli∣beration unanimously reversed the sentence ordering the gentlemen to be dismissed with a re∣buke from the bar on which they declared their sorrow for having met on that particular day if it gave offence Dr Wotherspoon ill brooking the moderation of the Presbytery in∣stantly threatened if the Presbytery did not affirm the sentence of his Session and also inflict a more severe censure  to print his sermon prefix the gentlemens names to it and either bring them to the submission he wished or brand their names with infamy and disgrace through the British dominions  And immediately after the Presbytery's sentence he did publish his ser∣mon with a narrative prefixed accusing the gentlemen by name of all the crimes he had laid to their charge but of which the Presbytery had unanimously acquitted them and it was ad∣vertised to be sold in every corner of Scotland where any of the gentlemen had any connections Paisley Glasgow Edinburgh Sterling c The Doctor also entered an appeal to the Ge∣neral Assembly which he afterwards thought proper to withdraw The gentlemen brought their action before the Court of Session complaining very loud of the injuries they had suffered and which they said had been attended with very bad consequences to them The Court ex∣pressed the highest indignation against Dr Wotherspoon's conduct gave l damages with costs to a considerable amount Behold a Scotch Cardinal Woolseyare such ministers a be∣nefit to true religion the religion of the mind that dwells with peace  We now pursued our journey crossed the river  Tiviot  at the  Mill Ford  and travelled up the southern banks of Tweed to  Mailross  the three  Helton Mountains  being our point of direction  Mailross  laying behind them and they a landmark constantly in view  We passed  Sir John Douglas's  on our left an elegant little mansion of hewn stone the walks and pleasure grounds around it neat to a degree of exactness the lands rich and the woods disposed at a proper dis∣tance On the opposite side of  Tweed  the  Palace  of the  Duke of Rox∣burgh  presented its extensive front flanked with immense woods For three miles the banks of the river as we passed were cloathed with a fine forest In some places the road leading along the summit of lofty cliffs from whence we looked down upon the river and opposite rocks whose brows were crowned with noble trees  We arrived at  ROXBURGH CASTLE  at present consisting of little more than a lofty eminence of an oblong figure elevated above the plain about perpendicular feet chiefly na∣tural on the brink of which are the remains of a wall the outward defence of the ancient castle the interior part is now planted with trees This mount is defended at the foot on the north and west sides by a deep moat and outward rampier of earth a fine plain intervening be∣tween these outworks of the castle and the river The dimensions within the walls where the interior fortress stood we could not obtain  for the trees and thickets The western point is guarded by an out∣work and mound of earth which is severed from the chief part of the castle by a moat but included in the outward works the foss and ram∣pier before described The foss or moat was supplied with water by a dam which crossed the river Tiviot in an oblique direction the remains of which still appear The south and east sides are defended by an in∣accessible precipice at whose foot the river runs with a rapid current  Camden says  this castle was anciently called Marchidun from its standing on the Marches and for natural situation and towered fortifications was in times past exceeding strong The fortress hav∣ing been surprized by the English James II of Scotland whilst he laid siege to it with a vast army to recover it was slain by the burst∣ing of a large piece of ordnance As for the castle it was surren∣dered and then raised It is now in a manner quite vanished and its ancient grandeur totally defaced  Mr Pennant says  the first mention I find of it is in when a treaty was concluded here on the part of King Stephen by Thurstan Archbishop of York between him and King David I  But in Symeon Dunelm we are informed that John Cardinal of Crima Legate  Pervenit apud flavium Tu  dam qui Northumbriam Loidam determinat in loco qui Ro∣cheburch vocatur It is told to the eternal disgrace of this Legate that in a Council at Lon∣don having declaimed bitterly against the sin of a Priest who had risen from the side of an Harlot to consecrate the Host he was found himself the following night in bed with an Harlot  of Pope Honorius came to the Scottish King at Roxburgh in the year to determine the controversy touching the Primacy of York over the Scottish church In King David returning from the Court of England was attended to Roxburgh by Thurstan Archbishop of York Ralph Bishop of Durham and Algar Prior of St Cuthbert's convent in Durham  Smith's Appendage to Bede p  King David I made this the place of his residence during the reign of his brother Alexander Hither he brought his favourite Monks of Tyrone from Selkirk before he placed them at Kelso and built the ab∣bey there He added to the strength of the place increased its fortifi∣cations and made it one of the chief bulwarks of his kingdom  Malcolm Macbeth who pretended to be the son of Earl Angus and was in arms against his Sovereign King David in was imprisoned in the Tower of Roxburgh  By the Chronicle of Mailross it appears that the church of St James at Roxburgh was dedicated the th of April  King David was the great patron of every national improvement he observed the example of Lewis le Gros in civil and commercial establish∣ments and granted many charters of incorporation to his cities and burghs The burgh laws he caused to be framed from the remarks made by learned men sent by him for the purpose into foreign states to reap the spirit and efficacy of each constitution It is probable that Roxburgh was one of the first of those communities in Scotland for in an ancient manuscript copy of the burgh laws of which David was the undoubted author the title prefixed declares them to be the laws and customs of the four burghs viz Berwick Roxburgh Edinburgh and Sterling A further evidence that these were the first royal burghs is in the court kept by the King's Chamberlain where his office appears to give him jurisdiction over all the King's burghs the court being called  the court of the four burghs  and consisted of Delegates from the burghs above mentioned three or four from each burgh who by virtue of the Chamberlain's summons assembled annually at Haddington where all appeals from the peculiar courts of each single burgh were heard and finally determined  The confirmatory charter of King Malcolm to Kelso dated was given at Roxburgh It appears by this charter that the King made Roxburgh his residence as he frequently attended divine service at the church at Kelso for he confirms to that church all the offerings made by himself and his attendants whensoever on solemnities or other days he heard the service of God in that church The populousness of Rox∣burgh and the country in the neighbourhood may be inferred from the mention of churches in that place granted to the Kelso convent as freely as they had been held by Acceline the Archdeacon and which churches seem distinct from the then lately erected church of St James The same appears from the grant of chalders partly corn and partly meal inter farinam frumentum to be paid out of the Roxburgh mills which probably was the estimate of the amount of the seventh part of the mills granted in David's charter to the abbey of Selkirk Mention is also made of a new town of Roxburgh  In the rebellious Harold Earl of Caithness was confined in Roxburgh This perfidious Earl having delivered Torphin his son as  an hostage for his future fidelity by his repeated treasons occasioned him to become a sacrifice to the resentment of his King who in his wrath being devoid of humanity gave the innocent youth up to the most dreadful tortures and excruciating death  His eyes were bored out and his genitals torn off  In William the Lion assembled a great army at Roxburgh to oppose King John who had approached the borders and lay at Nor∣ham but hostilities were prevented by a timely convention and a truce  In King John incensed against the northern Barons for their doing homage to King Alexander II at Felton marched northward in the middle of winter and laid the country waste with fire and sword exercising the greatest cruelties on the distracted inhabitants He burnt the towns of Milford Morpeth Alnwick Wark and Roxburgh in this horrid expedition  In Roxburgh appears to have been restored for here King Alexander II celebrated his marriage on the th of March in that year with the daughter of Ingelram de Conci and on the th of September the Queen brought forth a son here Alexander who succeeded to the Crown of Scotland  In Roxburgh was the place of refuge for King Alexander III and his young Queen who had been prohibited consummation of their marriage by the guardians of the kingdom of which complaint had been sent to King Henry III her father wherein she set forth the hard∣ships she underwent from the guardians who held her in strict confine∣ment refused her the attendants and maids she chose and debarred her from the embraces of her husband The Earl of Gloucester with others sent by King Henry assisted by the Earl of Dunbar and his ad∣herents surprized the Castle of Edinburgh and taking possession of the persons of the King and Queen conveyed them under a strong guard to Roxburgh where the Queen's distresses were relieved although her royal spouse was then only years of age  Prince Edward son to Henry III when on an expedition against the northern rebels who were in combination with John de Vescy after his forfeiture of Alnwick proceeded to Roxburgh in the year where he was received with the greatest demonstrations of joy by the King  and Queen of Scotland attended on that occasion by a numerous body of the Scotch nobility  The marriage of Alexander Prince of Scotland to the daughter of the Earl of Flanders was celebrated here on the th of April the nuptial feast being continued for days with the greatest magnificence  King Edward I in reduced the Castle of Roxburgh where he continued several days with his army during which time he was rein∣forced with fresh troops from Wales  In the succeeding year Edward having mustered his forces at New∣castle with an army of heavy armed horse light horse and foot proceeded to the Scotch border The Scotch army which for a considerable time had laid before Roxburgh in hopes of restoring to his liberty the Bishop of Glasgow who was prisoner there hearing of so great an army advancing raised the siege The relief brought by the English to the garrison of Roxburgh Castle was highly seasonable for they were already reduced to great hardships and the inhabitants of the town from the circumvallation formed by the Scotch were brought to great distress for want of provisions  On Shrove Tuesday in the year the garrison of Roxburgh in∣dulging themselves on that festival in an impolitick security were given up to riot and dissipation when they were surprized by Sir James Dou∣glas with a resolute band who having approached in disguise mounted the walls by ladders of ropes The name of Douglas echoed through the place and roused the English from their festivity and drunkenness many of them falling under the sword of the assailants The Governor retired into the great tower with a few of his men where after two days resistance having received a wound in his face by an arrow he surrendered the fortress King Robert Bruce on receiving intelligence of this exploit sent his brother Edward to demolish the fortifications which he effected with great labour  King Edward III in having come to Newcastle in quality of Supreme of Scotland received the homage of Edward Baliol in a public and solemn manner at which time Baliol as a recompence for the ex∣pences King Edward had sustained in recovering and restoring to him his inheritance by letters patent alienated to him amongst other things  the town castle and county of Roxburgh to be annexed to and incor∣porated with the Crown of England for ever  In we find Roxburgh again in the possession of the Scotch havbeen recovered by Sir Alexander Ramsay for King David Bruce  King Edward III in received from Baliol a formal surrender of his right to the Crown of Scotland This he performed by the cere∣mony of delivering his Crown with some of the soil of Scotland at Roxburgh where Edward resided some days This King twice cele∣brated his birthday in this castle  In George Dunbar Earl of March accompanied by his brother the Earl of Murray with a large body of their dependants entered Rox∣burgh at the time of the annual fair and in revenge of the death of one of their followers who was slain the preceding year in an affray slew all the English they found in the town plundered it of the great quan∣tities of merchandize and goods which were collected there on the above occasion and reduced the town to ashes  King James II of Scotland availing himself of a neglect in the Eng∣lish of attending a proposed convention for continuing the truce in raised an army with great expedition with which he advanced against Roxburgh At the first assault he took the town and levelled it to the ground A regular siege was laid to the castle Here the Scotch King was joined by great reinforcements among which was the Earl of Huntley with his followers The King for former services desirous of honouring Huntley shewed him every mark of esteem and royal fa∣vour he conducted him to the trenches to observe the discharge of his artillery one of which was remarkable for its size and had the name of the Lion The King took delight in attending these operations in which he shewed a distinguished intrepidity but in the end lost his life thereby one of his pieces of ordnance in this siege to which he had approached too near burst in discharging whereby the Earl of Angus who stood near the King was much wounded at the instant that a splinter broke the King's thigh and struck him dead This is the tragical circumstance before quoted from Camden The Queen with her eldest son then a boy about seven years of age is said to have been in the camp at the time of this dreadful catastrophe She sustained the shock with heroic firmness exhorted the Chiefs to desist from unavail∣ing  lamentations and to testify their reverence for their King's memory by carrying on the siege with redoubled vigour Her exhortations had the desired effect the besiegers exerted their utmost efforts The garri∣son finding themselves reduced to extremities surrendered the fortress and as Redpath in his Border History says  that the place which the English had held for more than years might thenceforth cease to be a center of rapine and violence or a cause of future strife be∣tween the nations the victors reduced it to a heap of ruins  We do not find that the fortress was restored or that any repairs were made to it to render it tenable until when the English army led by the Protector passing the Tweed after the battle of Musselbrough encamped on the plain overagainst Kelso between the ruins of the an∣cient Castle of Roxburgh and the confluence of Tweed and Tiviot The Protector observing the strong and convenient situation of this ruined fortress determined to make it tenable The breaches in part of the ancient walls were filled with bankings of turf he having reduced the fortress in size by casting up deep trenches on the east and west ends within and fortified them with a wall Patten's account of these re∣pairs is in the following terms  That one great ditch of feet broad with depth accordingly and a wall of like breadth depth and height should be made cross within the castle from the one side wall to the other and foot from the west end and that a like trench and wall should also be cast atraverse within about a coit's cast from the east end and hereto that the castle walls on either side where need was should be mended with turf and made with loop∣holes as well for shooting directly forwards as for flanking at hand  So intent was the Protector on this work that he laboured at it with his own hands two hours every day whilst it was going on and his example was followed by most of the principal men of his army The place was made defensible in six days and there was left in it a garrison of soldiers and pioneers under Sir Ralph Bulmer  Mr Pennant says  a large holly surrounded by a wall marks the spot where James II fell  but it was not noted to me when I visited the place  Near to the scite of Roxburgh are the confused foundations of build∣ings and one gateway of excellent workmanship which denote the place where stood a house of Franciscans  It is not possible to tread this ground without the most serious re∣flections the vicissitudes of human life here so remarkably experienced furnish the traveller with a crowd of ideas producing melancholy de∣terminations Here where this turf now painted with flowers is browsed by the flocks once stood a town flourishing in trade where festivity and mirth often engaged the wealthy inhabitants where the royal presence was encircled with the nobility of the land where the splendour of a court was displayed where the royal nuptials and the birth of Princes made a kingdom joyful where peace brought her olives to crown felicityand in reverse of circumstances where these cattle graze armed troops have held their deadly conflicts the soil has drank in the blood of heroes and nobles even royalty has bled upon these plains the shoots of victory or the cries of distress have often distracted these now peaceful echoes which make responses to the bleating sheep cannon have rent the confused atmosphere and the clangour of marshal instruments hath filled the gale which now breathes music in the mur∣muring groves revenge rapine and innumerable crimes have cursed the ground I tread with every human sin Avenging Providence at length hath razed the walls conscious of such iniquity the haughty towers are levelled with the earth the ploughshare hath gone over the paths of wicked ages and all but the name of Roxburgh is clean done out  As Roxburgh fell so have empires fallen and though it is a reflec∣tion which brings with it the acutest sorrow yet it must be admitted that when the accomplishment of time is come other empires must sink into oblivion Power and magnificence are periodical we know not which will be the next that yields in the succession Heaven grant that Britain by her virtues may merit the divine protection and that her empire may survive to the latest ages full of honour  It is very remarkable that not the least traces remain to mark the place where so large a town once stood a place so eminent and of so great resort for trade the residence of Kings and the seat of such con∣ventions  The adjoining territory from the old castle and town is called the Sheriffdom of Roxburgh of which the Douglas's are Hereditary She∣riffs and usually denominated Sheriffs of Tiviotdale  Our road on the banks of Tweed led through a cultivated country but ill fenced and the modes of husbandry gradually growing worse as we proceeded We passed the house of Colonel Mac Dougle situate on the north banks of Tweed a handsome Mansion on the brink of a steep descent in the front a terrace and grass slopes laid out with taste and well kept the house sheltered by plantations to the north and west  Further up the river the house of Mr Scot is seen a pretty square building surrounded with trees On that side of the river which we passed stood a large exploratory mount which seemed to have been originally encircled by three or four several bankings or terraces ascend∣ing above each other The crown is now planted with young trees and forms a pretty object from the gentlemen's seats on the opposite side of Tweed  Within some little distance further up the river we viewed a cir∣cular fort which as it remains the most entire of any we saw on this tour and will give a full idea of those which we passed similar in form though less perfect I have given a kind of birdeye view of it  This camp or rather fort hath been formed from a natural emi∣nence the crown is exactly circular and level with a rampier of earth on the verge having an aperture or entrance towards the east of the width of paces the rampier rises about six perpendicular feet from the level of the interior plain from the foot of which rampier the plain is near paces diameter I paced the top of this rampier and found the whole circle to be near paces In the interior plain not ex∣actly in the center but inclining to the southwest is the foundation of a stone wall forming a square of equal sides paces each This probably was the apartment of the General or other officers or a storehouse for arms and valuable effects The height from the top of the upper rampier to the next level is nearly perpendicular feet and as steep as soil or turf can possibly be supposed to lay The level here for it can scarce be termed a foss the rampier on its edge only forming a breastwork is nine paces wide This second rampier only makes a part of a circle its points terminating on the brink of a very high pre∣cipice overhanging the river the top of this rampier extends paces The height from the top of the second rampier to the next level is about perpendicular feet of as steep an ascent as the former This level or foss is only six paces wide the lowest or third rampier only forming a breastwork to the interior level but from the common plain is six feet in height composed of stones without any mortar its points also terminate on the edge of the precipice and its top measures paces so that the whole mount appears about perpendicular feet high The form of this fortification renders it probable that the chief persons of the army who lay here with their valuables were placed on the crown of the eminence and that the lower trenches were occupied by the troops according to the nature of their arms the heavyarmed soldiers in the lower intrenchment those armed with missile weapons on the second and third levels by which position on an attack the garrison could fight as from a theatre stage above stage and when forced from the lower trenches could still retreat to a station of supe∣riority These are improperly called camps they seem not calculated for encampment but as forts for a secure resort  I presume this fortification was originally Danish but to what part of the dark history of those times it may belong I am totally igno∣rant  When we had arrived within about four miles of Mailross we had a prospect of the ruins of  DRYBURGH ABBEY  seated on a promontory on the banks of Tweed under a lofty hill which defends it from the north We did not approach nearer to it than the opposite shore from whence it made a good appearance emerging from a thick wood The principal part now standing is sup∣ported by fine clustered pillars Mr Pennant who crossed the ferry to view it says  On the northern side of Tweed in the deep gloom of a wood are the remains of the Abbey of Dryburgh founded by Hugh Morvill Constable of Scotland in the time of King David I and Beatrix de Campo Bello his wife There are scarce any reliques of the church but much of the convent the refectory supported by  two pillars several vaults and other offices part of the cloister walls and a fine radiated window of stonework These remains are not inelegant but unadorned This was inhabited by Praemonstratentian Monks who stiled the Irish Abbies of Druin le Crox and Woodburn their daughters At the reformation King James VI bestowed Dry∣burgh on Henry Erskine second son of the Earl of Mar whose house as Commendator is still inhabited  In the reign of Edward II the English on their return from an incursion in which they had penetrated the country as far as Edin∣burgh burnt Dryburgh having first pillaged it of its wealth  The country as we approached Mailross shewed a gradual decrease of proper husbandry as well as an inferior quality of soil We arrived at the town of  MAILROSS  seated in a deep valley in which the abbey was concealed from the eye till we were just upon it but when through the trees we gained a view of its east window the elegance of the structure astonished us  We hastened to the Inn and with all the impatience of curiosity approached the sacred pile on the southern side The view from the entrance into the churchyard is noble This church is in the form of a cross the south end of the transept presented itself in front the arch∣ing of the doorway is composed of a semicircle with various members of the most delicate work falling behind each other supported on light and wellproportioned pilasters on each side is a projection of rich ta∣bernaclework The corners of this end of the structure are com∣posed of angular buttresses terminated by spires of tabernaclework These buttresses are pierced with niches for statues the pedestals and canopies of which are of the lightest Gothic order and ornamented with garlands of flowers in piercedwork  From the Manuscripts of the late  Roger Gale  Esq  The following account was communicated to  Roger Gale  Esq  by  Mr Francis Drake  of  York  Norham  th July  SIR  I could heartily wish that some judicious brother of your Antiquarian Society was but to see a Gothic rarity that is in this neighbourhood viz the beauteous ruins of the Abbey of Mail∣ross which I shall take upon me to say has been the most exquisite structure of its kind in either kingdom I wont say but other abbies have been larger such as St Albans and some conventual churches more august as Beverley but this of Mailross is extravagantly rich in its imagery niches and all sorts of carving by the best hands that Europe could produce at that time nay there is such a profusion of nice chiselwork in foliage and flowers at the very top of the steeple that it cannot be seen from the ground without the help of a glass The capital of every pillar that supports the arches of the church and the doors are all hollowed with a small tool being wreathedwork of all sorts of flowers such as you have at the entrance of your chapterhouse at York Every brother has had a stall in the cloister now much demolished which have been variously adorned with the leaves of fern oak palm holly or some other kind of trees  The building from the steeple to the east end is entire in the walls but the roof which has been of stone and carved is much decayed  The quire is but small but has a noble east window the glass all out therein lies a marble stone without any inscription half a hexagon tapering smaller at the foot of a bright green colour and powdered full of white feathers  The whole structure is in the form of a St John of Jerusalem's cross the north and south ailes pretty compleat at the north side of which is a staircase that has led into the Prior's house  From the steeple westward remain six arches of the nave in which is the present kirk that takes up about three of them but how much further the ancient church has extended I be∣lieve will be hard to know  In every arch of the nave both north and south has run a cross wall into the two side ailes making so many sacella each with an altar and holywater pot  The windows are of an equal dimension but variously figured and carved  The cloister has been on the north side of the church which opened into a garden that led to the Tweed that is there of a good breadth and there was another garden on the opposite side of the river Our neighbours are not wanting in the faculty of amplifying but this thing does really exceed all their exaggerations of praise By this you'll sneer and say I have lived too long here and am become as vain as they however I stand to my assertion  There is printed an upright of this abbey that is ill done I could wish there was not only an exact whole plate but also a view of the east end with a distinct draught of the doors co∣lumns capitals and some of the finest images which are so well finished to the life that Dr King of Oxford who has been lately to see it wished they were taken down and preserved from the weather the whole building is of a fine stone  I could wish also there was an exact Ichnography drawn of the whole The Minister is a good sensible man a lover of this kind of antiquity and is daily studying the walls of this church He shewed me some of the glass of the windows which is of an uncommon thickness not stained through but painted upon  If by this mean effort your society could be prevailed upon to take this structure into their consideration I know not how far the Scotch gentlemen are engaged in their Monasticon Sco∣ticum I have gained my end especially if you will vouchsafe me the favour of an answer to this who am dear cousin  Yours affectionately F DRAKE  P S You know our St Cuthbert was educated at this abbey Over a door is a date of the work and the name of the Architect Mr BrowneWillis has had an account of this abbey sent him  Above the south gate are several  MELROSS ABBEY  niches for statues decreasing in height as the arch rises in which some mutilated effigies remain many in standing positions others sitting said to represent the Apostles but by their apparel I conceived they were re∣presentations of the patrons of the church In the center are the arms  of Scotland a Lion rampant in reverse with a double tressure above which is the effigy of John the Baptist to the waist suspended on a cloud casting his looks upward and bearing on his bosom a fillet in∣scribed  "Ecce filius Dei"  This is of very delicate sculpture and in good preservation On the buttress east of the door is the effigy of a Monk suspended in the like manner supporting on his shoulders the pedestal of the nich above in his hands a fillet is extended on which is inscribed  "Passus e q ipe voluit"  Read "Passus est quia ipse voluit"  On the western buttress is the like effigy bearing a fillet inscribed  "Cu venit Jesi seq cessabit umbra"  "Cum venit Jesus sequitur cessabit umbra"  These two sculptures are of excellent workmanship To the westward of this last effigy is the figure of a cripple on the shoulders of one that is blind well executed under which you read  "Uncte Dei"  Above the south door is an elegant window divided by four principal bars or mullions terminating in a pointed arch the tracery light and col∣lected at the summit into a wheel the stonework of the whole window yet remaining perfect This window is feet in height within the arch and in breadth the mouldings of the arch contain many mem∣bers graced with a filleting of foliage the outward member runs into a point of pinnaclework and encloses a nich highly ornamented which it is said contained the figure of our Lord There are eight niches which sink gradually on the sides of the arch formerly appropriated to receive the statues of the Apostles The whole south end rises to a point to form the roof garnished with an upper moulding which is orna∣mented with a fillet of excellent rosework the center is terminated by a square tower  It will suffice to remark in this place that the pedestals for statues in general are composed of five members of cornice supported by palm boughs or some other rich wrought foliage and terminating at the foot in a point with a triple roll The caps or canopies of the niches are composed of delicate tabernaclework the spires ornamented with mouldings and a fillet of rosework and the suspended skirts graced with flowers the interior of the canopy is of ribbedwork terminating in a suspended knot in the center This description will do to carry the reader's idea to every particular nich without my running into the tediousness of repetition  At the junction of the south and west members of the cross a hexa∣gon tower arises terminating in a pinnacle roofed with stone highly ornamented from thence the aile is extended so as to receive three large windows whose arches are pointed each divided by three up∣right bars or mullions the tracery various and light some in wheels and others in the windings of foliage These windows are separated by buttresses ornamented with niches Here are sculptured the arms of several of the Abbots and that also of the Abbacy  "a Mail rose"  These buttresses support pinnacles of the finest tabernaclework From the feet of these last pinnacles are extended bows or open arches composed of the quarter division of a circle abutting to the bottoms of another race of buttresses which arise on the side wall of the nave each of these last buttresses also supporting an elegant pinnacle of taber∣naclework are ornamented with niches in two of which statues re∣main one of St Andrew the other of the Holy Virgin the side ailes are slated but the nave is covered with an arched roof of hewn stone From the west end of the church is continued a row of buildings con∣taining five windows divided by the like buttresses the tracery of two of the windows remaining the rest open Each of these windows ap∣pertained to a separate chapel appropriated and dedicated to distinct personages and services the places of the altars and the fonts or holywater basons still remaining At the western extremity of this structure on the last buttress are the arms of Scotland supported by Unicorns collared and chained the motto above broken the letters EGIS only remaining On one side is the letter I on the other Q and a date which was the second year of the marriage of King James IV a mar∣riage concerted at this abbey between the King in person and Richard Fox then Bishop of Durham  In the fury of reformation still existing the elegant statues which ornamented this place were most sacrilegiously demolished A tradition prevails here that one of the persons so employed on striking at the babe in the Virgin's arms received a contusion which disabled him for ever from such useless occupation and struck such a panic on his associates that they fled and left the mischievous business unperfected  In Spotswood's History of the Church of Scotland  Page  we find these works of fanatical fury thus mentioned  An act was passed for demo∣lishing  cloisters and abbey churches such as were not as yet pulled down the execution whereof was for the west parts committed to the Earls of Arrane Argile and Glencarn for the north to Lord James and for the incountries to some Barons that were held most zealous  Thereupon issued a pitiful vastation of churches and church build∣ings throughout all the parts of the realm for every one made bold to put to their hands the meaner sort imitating the ensample of the greater and those who were in authority No difference was made but all the churches either defaced or pulled to the ground The holy vessels and whatsoever else men could make gain of as timber lead and bells were put to sale The very sepulchres of the dead were not spared The registers of the church and biblio∣thekes cast into the fire I award all was ruined and what escaped in the time of the first tumult did now undergo the common cala∣mity which was so much the worse that the violences committed at this time were coloured with the warrant of public authority Some illadvised preachers did likewise animate people in these their bar∣barous proceedings crying out "  that the places where idols had been worshipped ought by the law of God to be destroyed and that the sparing of them was the reserving of things execrable  as if the commandment given to Israel for destroying the place where the Canaanites did worship their false Gods had been a warrant for them to do the like The report also went that  John Knox  whose sayings were by many esteemed as oracles should in one of his sermons say  that the sure way to banish the Rooks was to pull down their nests  which words if any such did escape him were to be understood of the cloisters of Monks and Friars only according to the act passed in the council But popular fury once armed can keep no measure nor do any thing with advice and judgment  The east end of the church is composed of the choir with a small aile on each side which appear to have been open to the high altar This part is lighted by three windows towards the east and two side windows in the aile the center window is divided by four upright bars or mullions the traceries are of various figures but chiefly crosses which support a large complicated cross that forms the center the arching is pointed and part of the tracery here is broken the side lights are near as high as the center but very narrow divided by three  upright bars or mullions the mouldings of the window arches are small and delicate yet ornamented with a fillet of foliage On each side of the great window are niches for statues and at the top there appear the effigies of an old man sitting with a globe in his left hand rested on his knee with a young man on his right over their heads an open crown is suspended These figures I presume represent the di∣vine personages The buttresses at this end terminate in pinnacles of tabernaclework the mouldings and sculptures are elegantly wrought  The north end of the cross aile of this abbey is not much ornamented without it having adjoined to the cloister and other buildings The door which leads to the scite of the cloister the building being demo∣lished is a semicircular arch of many members the fillet of foliage and flowers is of the highest finishing that can be conceived to be exe∣cuted in freestone the same being pierced the flowers and leaves se∣parated from the stone behind and suspended in a twisted garland In the mouldings pinnaclework and foliage of the seats which remain of the cloister I may be bold to say there is as great excellence to be found as in any stonework in Europe for lightness ease and dispo∣sition Nature is studied through the whole and the flowers and plants are represented as accurately as under the pencil In this fabric there are the finest lessons and the greatest variety of Gothic ornaments that the island affords take all the religious structures together  The west side of the center tower is yet standing it appears to have supported a spire a loss to the dignity and beauty of the present remains to be regretted by every visitant the balconywork is beauti∣ful being formed of open rosework the present height of the tower wall is feet  The length of this edifice from east to west is feet the cross aile feet and the whole contents of its Ichnography feet  We entered at the south door and no expression can convey an idea of the solemn magnificence which struck the eye the roof of the north and south ends of the transept remains supported by intersecting groins in various directions of the lightest order the joinings ornamented with knots some sculptured with figures and others of piercedwork in flowers and foliage the arching of the interstices constructed of thin  stones closely jointed over the choir part of the roof of like work∣manship still remains The side ailes are formed by light clustered pil∣lars richly capitalled with garlands of flowers and foliage disposed delicately in the mouldings in some the figures of animals are inter∣spersed The pillars which supported the tower towards the east are gone so that three sides of it are down leaving a chasm through which you look up towards the remaining quarter  The north aile is lighted by a circular window representing a crown of thorns which makes an uncommon appearance Here are the effi∣gies of Peter and Paul one on each side the tower but of inferior sculpture  It is said Alexander II King of Scotland lays buried at the high altar and that an inscription denoted his tomb  Ecclesiae clypeus pax plebis dux miserorum  Rex rectus rigidus sapiens consultus honestus  Rex pius rex fortis rex optimus rex opulentus  Nominis istius ipse secundus erat  Annis ter denis quinis rex fuit ipse  Insula quae carneri dicitur hunc rapuit  Spiritus alta petit caelestibus associatus  Sed Melrossensis ossa sepulta tenet  but no such inscrip∣tion is now to be found There is a marble tomb the form of a coffin on the south side of the high altar but it bears no inscription and is supposed to be that of Waldevus the second Abbot who was canonized The Chronicle of Mailross contains this anecdote  That Ingerim Bishop of Glasgow and four Abbots came to Mailross to open the grave after years interment when they found the body of Wal∣devus uncorrupted on which with religious rapsody they exclaimed  Vere hic homo Dei est  They afterwards placed a marble monument over the remains  Many of the noble line of Douglas lay here among whom is James the son of William Earl of Douglas who was slain at the battle of Ot∣terburn and interred with all military honours Lord Liddisdale who was stiled the flower of chivalry  He fell a victim to the jealousy of William the first Earl of Douglas and was assassinated His eulogy in the life of the Douglasses p stiles him  terrible and fearful in arms meek mild and gentle in peace the scourge of England and sure buckler and wall of Scotland whom neither hard success could make slack nor prosperous slothful  de Valoniis Vauxs Somervils Balfours and many other men of note lay in the chapterhouse  Upon the wall on the left as you enter the south aile two inscrip∣tions strike the eye cut in the old English letter over one of which a compass is extended They are as follow  I  So gayes the compass ev'n about  So truth and laute do but doubt  Behald to the endIohn Murdo  II  Iohn Murdo sum tym callit was I  And born

Iohn keey this haly kirk from skaith  Whilst my companion was drawing his view I wandered in this hallowed spot till decline of day the evening advanced with an un∣usual solemnity the clouds which were struck with crimson reflected the beams of the setting sun into the interior parts of the building and made the whole glow with a purple ray the idea struck me that ce∣lestial ministers apparelled suitable to the weakness of the human eye accompanied me to walk the ruined aile the thought was sufficient to inspire a contemplative traveller with meditations as serious as the hu∣man mind is susceptible of To add to this disposition the wind blew a brisk gale and gave a mournful melody every object was solemn and every thought devout who could forbear exclaiming  Thy ministers incessantly accompany us they involve us as with this ray of light they penetrate the eye and read the images of the mind before they have utterance they bear witness of our frailties and rejoice in our virtues perhaps by so exquisite a touch that human sense cannot dis∣tinguish it they carry on their operations by those propensities for which we are unable to account and influence our resolves and struggle with our proneness to evil that we may not deviate from thy laws  "Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth  "Unseen both when we wake and when we sleep  "How often from the steep  "Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard  "Celestial voices to the midnight air  "Soleor responsive each to other's note  "Singing their great Creator Oft in bands  "While they keep watch or nightly rounding walk  "With heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds  "In full harmonic number join'd their songs  "Divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven"  These sad remains of human glory how are their beauties defaced thus pass away the mighty things of the earth To the eye of him to whom ten thousand years are as one day what vanity is the magni∣ficence of men here forgotten of the world lay in the dust princes and nobles whose titles authority and power are vanished as the  baseless fabric of a vision  If spirits visit their terrestrial abodes for  it is not the will of  our  father which is in heaven that one of these should perish  here perhaps wander heroes who languish over their unex∣piated crimes men of religious orders who mourn the depravity of the human race and the desolation of their temple where once all human energy was breathed in prayer If spirits visit their terrestrial walks and leave for a time that ineffable beatitude proclaimed to us  that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of  our  father which is in heaven  perhapsalas it is too true I lost a friend perhaps his expanded essence fills this ray that penetrates the gloom rejoices in the thoughts which rise upon my mind conveys my prayer to the divine propitiatory prompts each virtuous fervour and subverts all rising impropriety perhaps with that pure affection which he pos∣sessed when living on earth he looks upon my countenance commi∣serates the darkness of my faculties that here are labouring for plea∣sure or for knowledge  My eyes grew full of tears my heart heaved in tumult my hands were grasped through energy of thought and I stood as a statue when the approaching foot of my companion roused me preserving my mind from a growing extravagance of imagination which was already re∣plete with the most affecting images  In the morning at sunrise we again returned to these splendid ruins which had even occupied the visions of our sleep we yet had to take a survey of the nave of the church which is now used for wor∣ship On opening the door it is not to be expressed the disagreeable scene which presented itself this place is filled with stalls in the dispo∣sition of which irregularity alone seems to have been studied some  are raised on upright beams as scaffolds tier above tier others sup∣ported against the walls and pillars no two are alike in form height or magnitude the same confusion of little and great high and low covers the floor with pews the lights are so obstructed that the place is as dark as a vault the floor is nothing but the damp earth nastiness and irregularity possess the whole scene The fine workmanship of the pillars whose capitals for flowers and foliage exceed all the rest of the building the ribs of the arches and the ornaments of their intersec∣tions are scarce to be seen in the horrid gloom which possesses the place  What idea concomitant to religion can dictate filthiness and con∣fusion in a house of worship I know not by magnificence and splen∣dour the eye may be diverted but in that elegant simplicity in which cleanness and plainness are associates the mind abstracted from atten∣tion to worldly things will be yielded to uninterrupted devotion All reformation has been attended with extravagance bigotry grows up into passion and from one extreme the zealot rushes into another When the pomp of Romish worship was to be corrected the Scotch sunk into the deepest reverse Many of the old churches in Scotland which I have seen are filthy and foul one of the allotments of the Cathedral of St Andrews in the city of Glasgow appropriated to parochial duty is even in the burial vaults in the foundation of the structure without light but what issues through little loopholes near to the pulpit where the minister sits to teach his parishioners who are lodged in outer dark∣ness but for uncleanness and irregularity this place exceeds them all I have had dreams of confusion in my youth but never formed even a diseased idea like this It looks like the house of lunatics it is unpa∣rallelled and defies all language to give it a description superior to every thing but the incongruities of a Bedlamite's disordered fancy  But to more moderate matters Here are several tombs of eminent personages on the north wall is inscribed under a coat armour  Here lies the race of the house of Zair  Many altars basons for holy water and other remains of separate chapels appear in the ailes among which are those of St Mary and St Waldave  The sentiments which arose to me whilst I walked or rather staggered about in this strange scene were much to this effect I premised that true Religion consisted of that devout fervour of mind which gives its  ideas to the Divinity full of gratitude for his benevolence and longsufferings full of admiration of that majesty and mightiness which are displayed through all his works and from a true consciousness of man's demerits and the imperfections of his judgment full of patience hu∣mility and resignation When a man who is possessed of such disposi∣tion of mind puts up a prayer it is only for mercy and protection In whatever class of religious men we find these premised principles best preserved we may determine with justice that there the true devotee is distinguished Modes of religion are its corruption the acceptations of a country or the prescriptions of a peculiar set of men may be sa∣lutary to the community in general but in no wise conducive to the de∣votion of the individual Religion has its essence from the liberty of the mind formularies maxims modes or dictions are disguises which in the robe confound the spirit are fetters that bind down the fervour of the mind If the truly devout heart breathe out "Lord have mercy on me a sinner" there is more religion in that short sentence so uttered than in ten thousand Ave Marys a million of liturgies and the frip∣pery of establishment Charity is as unbounded as the regions of hea∣ven and beset with as many gems as the galaxy Charity says the truly religious of every age nation custom profession and mode are acceptable to the Divinity for it is not the mode but the spirit that approacheth the regions of life When I tread the walk of antiquity I venerate the pious works of the heathen the servant of the Deity is to be revered let his service differ never so wide from the establishment of which I am a member it is the essence of the act that I sever from the defilements of custom we judge and may be judged we think we are right so did the Ancients the Druid the Amonian in his acts of piety is to be regarded without the errors of his sunshine services he worshipped the Deity under the symbol of the sun an object in nature the most reasonably adopted as the image of the Creator or as the throne of his majesty  The Roman scattering salt and meal on the crackling coals and making his libations to the Divinity under the type of some of his at∣tributes is also worthy of our reverence the errors his modes admit∣ted through charity are exempt from judgment and his real piety is estimated divested of defilements which were contracted from the errors of the age  The Jewish pomp and ceremony the tumultuous and noisy sacrifice the greasy services and bloodbespattered altars are all forgotten when we trace the religion of the mind and the piety of the devotee  The magnificent rites of modern Rome loose their pageantry and sink upon our estimate when we compare them to the cell of humilia∣tion where piety leaving the eye of men retires to solitudes and the Recluse confessing the frailties of nature with purity of soul a∣vows all the religious confidence of faith we at once turn from the echoing dome and the acclamations of a choir of eunuchs to seek this holy devotee the man who communes secretly with his own soul who puts off the formulary and presents in his solitary cell a genuine confession and the spirit of prayer before his God whose presence is universal  The Reformist protesting against the errors of others like the scrip∣tural image of imperfection plucks not the beam from his own eye though less pompous in his service yet he remains as ceremonious  Our reformed church of England has retained too much of the Popish spirit and custom which tends to the destruction of rational piety and true christian worship  Monthly Review Sept page  all attitudes are admitted to his devotion by intervals except the original one the eastern attitude that prostration which expresses the utmost hu∣miliation his liturgy is filled with repetition whilst there is surely no want of subject for supplication When many supposed Mediators were to be addressed repetition was attended with some reason these are taken away but the reiteration continues When the reformist breathes the sighing of a contrite heart he gains with the devotee of every de∣nomination an acceptation which depends not upon modes  The Presbyterian avoids much form but admits much slovenliness much indolence and more negligence yet the inward spirit which would have been devout in any other class of religious is the same worthy devotee in this apparel  The silent Quaker sits meditative his mind unoccupied by fashion or form is open to nature's dictates in all their simplicity he perceives the glow of devotion the moving spirit warms his soul and the heart  conceives what the Divinity accepts though unuttered by the lips The Fanatic would in the utmost agitation be in action the Bramin be in torture but this Religious brings offerings of peace his God is the God of tranquillity It is the service of the spirit is acceptable the offices of the body are appropriated to corruption to fashion and the follies of the world  The canting Hypocrite who goes about announcing wretchedness and breathing anathemas on mankind is to be treated with pity and an apothecary  Religion is replete with pleasures and not burthened with terrors she bringeth forth the most placid hope and her hope is accompanied with inexhaustible images of joy Pope's distich as to modes of faith is infallibly true  "His sure is best whose life is in the right"  Religion is in the manners and not in modes of prayer  But to return to my subjectIn one of the ailes of this part of the church is an inscription cut in a fair letter but of what import I can∣not discover  NUNAM KATINE  THOME PAULI GUTHB  TE S PETR K ETIGIN  The ancient monastery of Mailross is said to have stood originally a mile from the present ruins but by whom founded is uncertainOne house marks the place  on a lofty promontory peninsulated by the Tweed a most beautiful scene the banks lofty and wooded varied with perpendicular rocks jutting like buttresses from top to bottom This was the scite of the ancient abbey of Culdees mentioned by Bede to have existed in in the reign of the Saxon Oswy This place was as celebrated for the austerities of Diricthelmus  Dryethelme had a cell assigned him in the most retired part of the convent that he might be less disturbed in his continual devotions And the place itself being situated on the bank of the river he used often for the sake of mortifying his body to go down into it and plunge in the stream There he continued praying and singing psalms as long as he could the water sometimes coming up to his loins and sometimes as far as his neck and when he came out from it he never thought of casting off his wet and cold garments but wore them till they grew dry and warm on his body In the winter when encompassed with crusts of ice he continued this mortification sometimes breaking the ice to make room for his standing or dipping  Bede lib c  as ever  Finchal was for those of St Godric The first was restored to life after being dead for an entire night During that space he passed through purgatory and hell had the beatific vision and got very near to the confines of heaven His angelic guide gave him an useful lesson on the efficacy of prayer alms fasting and particularly masses of holy men infallible means to relieve the souls of friends and rela∣tions from the place of torment  Pennant  The Scotch who are ambitious of antiquity attribute it to Columbus some more moderate say its original patron was Aidan Bede says it was seated on the banks of Tweed that the churches at that time were built of oak thatched with reeds and that the religious of this house maintained themselves a long time against the canons and ordinances of the Romish councils On a peninsula formed by the river you are shewn the scite of old Mailross with the foundations of the wall the porter's lodge the chapel know and many other places appertaining to that house together with the remains of a bridge over Tweed Nen∣nius who lived as some authors assert in but according to others in speaks of this monastery as a place of great note and probably it was destroyed by the Danes when they ravaged this country Bede gives the names of some Abbots here  Eata  the first he was succeeded by  Boisil  who according to Dempster died in  St Cuthbert  succeeded  Boisil  but afterwards quitted this monastery and went to  Lindisfarne  he was succeeded by  Etholwold  This is all I can collect of old Mail∣ross The house of which these celebrated ruins are the remains was founded by David King of Scotland in the year it was endowed with large revenues and many immunities as appears by the charters granted to the Abbot and Convent by the Kings of Scotland In a manuscript said to be deposited in the Colbertine Library giving an account of the several religious houses founded by King David it is mentioned  Sed Melrossensum praecipue inter omnes ecclesias fideliter defen∣sabat dulciter diligebat suis opibus exornabat  Mr Hay says it is re∣corded in the book of taxes of the Apostolic Chamber that King David bestowed thereon florins The original charter of foundation was  confirmed by his son Prince Henry and intimates that he gave to this abbey the whole lands of Mailross Eldun of Dernewie Galtownside Galtownside Haugh and Galtownside Wood and many privileges in the forests of Selkirk and Traquair particularly betwixt Galla and Leeder The charter also expresses that these lands had been peram∣bulated by the King in person accompanied by Prince Henry with Richard the first Abbot The date of this charter is the second year after Stephen of Boloign King of England was taken prisoner which must be in the year The witnesses are Hogo de Moreville Wil∣liam de Somerville Gervasus Riddel c  The date of the foundation appears in this monkish distich  "Anno Milleno centeno terquoque deno  "Et sexto Christi Melrose fundita fuisti"  By the foundation charter the dedication appears to be  Deo sanctae Mariae de Mailross Monachis ibidem deo servientibus de Riavallis c  of the Cistercian order yet the church was not dedicated till the year  Richard  the first Abbot was installed in the year the year of foundation he was succeeded by  Walterus  or  Waldevus  a son of King David who was afterwards elected Bishop of St Andrews but refused Episcopacy To him many miracles were attributed to relate one will suffice  In a great famine about poor people came to the con∣vent of Mailross for relief whom Waldeve the Abbot pitying he went with his cellarer or butler Tyna to his grange at Heldwii and then to Gattonside and having put in the staff which he carried in his hand among the corn it was increased through the sign of the cross both for the supply of the convent and all these numerous poor  He received canonization and many rich offerings were made at his tomb  Joceline a man of great learning was Abbot here he was after∣wards made Bishop of Glasgow but chose Mailross for the place of his interment One Laurentius was a succeeding Abbot also Ranulph in who by the Legate of Pope Innocent III was made Bishop of Down in Ireland  We find this monastery like all others very busy and warm in se∣cular matters The pious Legate was at Mailross to determine a dis∣pute between this Abbey and Calehow and to his dishonour it is said he  took the fee of office and left the case undetermined and in the Abbot and a great many of the society and dependents of this monastery were excommunicated by a Council held at Perth for an affray with the men of Wedale in which a Clergyman was slain and many persons wounded  In William the th Abbot of Mailross died This was the th year after the death of St Waldeve William was equally esteemed for his sanctity and on his death it was resolved that their bodies should be laid together As the workmen were preparing William's grave brother Robert who was a Mason  A Lay Brother  by the incitement of some of his associates but not without reluctance and much religious horror raised the cover of Waldeve's tomb when there issued a fragrance as if the grave had been filled with spices Being in the gloom of the evening he brought a candle to the aperture all who were present beheld the sacred body entire and all the vestments as fresh and beautiful as when first put on There were six Monks and as many Laybrothers who had the happiness of gratifying their pious though presumptuous cu∣riosity  Fordun l c  In the year the bones of the Abbots of Mailross that lay in the entrance of the chapterhouse were taken up and more decently buried in the eastern part of the same chapterhouse all excepting the bones of St Waldeve whose sepulchre was opened and his body found at last crumbled into dust Those who were present carried off some of the small bones leaving the rest to repose in peace One of the com∣pany was William son to the Earl of Dunbar and nephew to the King a Knight of great fame He begged and obtained a tooth of the saint by which he is said to have wrought many cures  In one Patrick then Abbot swore fealty to King Edward I  Robert of Kindalach a Monk and Abbot of Dunfermline and Chan∣cellor of Scotland was Abbot here Also  John Foggo Confessor to King James I of Scotland and  Andrew Hunter Lord High Treasurer and Confessor to King James II of Scotland  Duroys and Foggos appear in the same list and also James Stuart eldest natural son to King James I he was Abbot of Kelso and also of Mailross and died about the year After him Cardinal de Guise was nominated but never installed  This monastery suffered many injuries in the wars between Scotland and England In the year it was pillaged by the troops of King Edward II whose inglorious expedition was marked with disgrace by the burning this and Dryburgh Abbey and murdering a company of Monks King Robert Bruce for its restoration gave in the year l sterling with many forfeited estates King Richard II again burnt this monastery and in the reign of King Henry VIII it was pil∣laged and laid waste Sir Ralph Ivers and Sir Bryan Layton having obtained a grant of Merse and Tiviotdale on their coming to take pos∣session were opposed by Archibald the th Earl of Angus at Ancrum Moor and suffered a shameful defeat The ground where this battle was fought is called Lilliards Edge from the singular valour of a woman who was on the side of the Scotch Over her place of interment was erected a monument with this inscription  Fair maiden Lilliard lies under this stane  Little was her stature but great her fame  On the English lads she laid many thumps  And when her legs were off she fought upon her stumps  Mailross was a mother church to all of the Cistercian order in Scot∣land The Monks wrote a chronicle of this house beginning at and continued down to It had many endowments besides those of King David particularly by King Alexander II the family of Stuarts and others In the year the revenue appeared by the account then taken to be as follows  In Money l per annum  Wheat chalders bolls  Bear chalders bolls  Meal chalders bolls firlot  Aittes chalders bolls  Capons  Poultry  Butter stone  Salt chalders paid out of Preston Pans  Peats loads  Carriages  Mr Hay in his Scotia Sacra gives the following account  In charta visitationis    invenio Monachos ibi fuisse    anno    anno        conversos quibus dabantur modia frumenti annuatim    cervisiae dolia    ad missarum solemnia vini dolia    ad hospites suspi∣ciendos dolia vini    cervisiae    frumenti modia    infirmis nutriendis    lb Turon tonsori lib    Pono monasterium omnium erat in Scotia pulcherimum opulentissimum  After the reformation the abbey of Mailross was granted by Queen Mary to James Earl of Bothwell who forfeited the same It then came to the family of Douglas one of whom was created Earl of Mortan under whose hands all the evidences of this abbey's possessions were preserved and are now in the custody of that family A grant was made of it to John Ramsay by King James VI and confirmed by par∣liament as a reward for preserving the King against a traiterous at∣tempt by Lord Gowry He was created Lord Haddington and after∣wards made a peer of England by the title of Earl of Holdernesse It came afterwards to Sir Thomas Hamilton who was created Earl of Mailross in and assumed on that occasion three roses in his coat armour he afterwards took the title of Haddington The abbey with its demesnes were lately purchased by the family of Buccleugh  Many large buildings have stood within the walls of the monastery whose remains yet appear  In returning from Mailross we passed  NEWSTEAD  a little village at the distance of about a mile from the abbey noted for a lodge of Free Masons whose antiquity is believed to be cotemporary with the monastery at least but some presume to trace it to a much greater distance from its vicinity to the Helton Mountains which en∣tertained a Druid tribe whose traces are evident to this day Here are the foundations and remains of a house belonging to the Knights Tem∣plars called Red Abbey Stead  The name of a peculiar spot on the middle Helton Mountain with a traditional account that it was sacred to  Jupiter  and was a possession of the  Druids  induced us to visit these lofty hills We advanced to the  summit of the center hill a rise of about a mile and half the place called  Aborjo  of which there is such tradition engaged us some time our guide said that in former times it was girt with a grove of oaks and fenced with a trench and vallum of earth The vestiges of the trench remain but the grove is no more  Abor  was a name given by the  Amonians  to the great luminary and signifies  the parent of light  In Mr Bryant's work we have the following definition  This luminary was also called Abor the parent of light and his temple Choabor Of this name both a city and river were to be found in Gauzaintis as well as in Susiaria and other parts    Aborjo  is an easy corruption of  Aborcho  being a mere transposition of the titles  On the top of the northeast mountain are the traces of a large en∣campment Mr Pennant says on one of these hills  is a Roman camp and that he had been informed of others with military ways to be traced in various places  I am apt to conjecture Mr Pennant took this account from a little pamphlet sold at Mailross describing that place and its environs and did not visit it himself The place hath not the form or appearance of a Roman camp it has been an occasional for∣tification not a permanent one the climate and exposure of the situation will not allow a conjecture that it was designed for a continued stronghold The breastworks are of earth defended by moles at irregular distances a mode not practised by the Romans In the beginning of  Ethelwold  's reign  Oswin  who claimed the crown as his right of inheritance levied forces to recover it This was the scene of a decisive engagement  Oswin  having fortified himself strongly at length determined to put his claim to the issue of battle the fight conti∣nued for three successive days beginning on the th of August but the event was fatal to  Oswin  and his adherents  Oswin  dying in the field It is most probable these fortifications were of the above date when the disposition of the crown of Northumberland was deter∣mined by the event I have mentioned  King Alexander III levied a great army in which rendez∣voused at  Mailross  where the King continued some time There is scarce an eminence on these borders but what bears the marks of warfare From the northeast eminence there is a most extensive and beautiful prospect commanding all the vale of Tweed down to Berwick a fine though distant view of Tiviotdale the northern and western views are rugged and mountainous  After repassing Kelso we arrived at  COLDSTREAM  having kept the northern side of Tweed The views on this ride were open and beautiful we passed the seat of Dr Johnston finely covered with wood also the seat of Lord Hume around which extensive plan∣tations of young firs are arising and already have an excellent effect upon the landskip The elegant house of Mr Majoribanks by Cold∣stream loses half its beauty in want of wood  End of the First Part  APPENDIX Anno decimo quarto Elizabethae cap An Act for annexing Exam and Examshire to the County of Northum∣berland  WHereas for the space of diverse years last
