KEMBLE" c  DRURYLANE PLAYBILL  I had as lieve the TownCrier had spoke my Lines"  SHAKESPEARE  DUBLIN  PRINTED BY THOMAS BURNSIDE  FOR P WOGAN J RICE AND G FOLINGSBY  PREFACE  HAVING been for some time a labourer in the Drama and finding it necessary to continue my labours I cannot help endeavouring to guard the past from misrepresentation lest my supineness may injure the future Conscious that a prejudice has been created against the Play which I now submit to the Reader and conscious how far I am innocent of raising it it were stupid to sit down in silence and thus tacitly acknowledge myself guilty of dulness dumbly confess I have been deficient in the knowledge of my trade damn myself for a bungling workman and fix a disrepute upon every article which may hereafter come from my hands  Thanks to you Ladies and Gentlemen you have been kind customers to me and I am proud to say that you have stamped a fashion upon my goods Base indeed and ungrateful were the attempt after your favours so long received and continued to impose upon you  a clumsy commodity and boast it to be ware of the best quality that I ever put up to sale No on the word of an honest man I have bestowed no small pains upon this  Iron Chest  which I offer you Inspect it examine it you see the maker's name is upon it I do not say it is perfect I do not pretend to tell you it is of the highest polish there is no occasion for that many of my brethren have presented you with mere  linings for chests  and you have been contentbut I trust you will find that my  Iron Chest  will hold together that it is tolerably sound and fit for all the purposes for which it was intended  Then how came it to fall to pieces after four days wearI will explain thatbut alas alas my heart doth yearn when I think on the task which circumstance has thrust upon me  Now by the Spirit of Peace I Swear were I not doomed to explore the rugged windings of the Drama I would wrap myself in mute philosophy and repose calmly under the dark shade of my grievance rather than endure the pain and trouble of this explanation I cannot however cry "Let the world slide" I must pursue my journey and be active to clear away the obstacles that impede my progress  I am too callous now to be annoyed by those innumerable gnats and insects who daily dart their impotent stings on the literary traveller and too knowing to dismount and waste my time in whipping grasshoppersbut here is a scowling sullen black Bull right athwart my roada monster of magnitude of the Boeotian breed perplexing me in my wanderings through the entangled labyrinth of Drury  he stands sulkily before me with sides seemingly impenetrable to any lash and tougher than the Dun Cow of WarwickHis front outfronting the brazen bull of PerillusHe has bellowed Gentlemen Yea he hath bellowed a dismal sound A hollow unvaried tone heaved from his very midriff and striking the listener with torporWould I could pass the animal quietly for my own sakeand for his by Jupiter I repeat it I would not willingly harm the BullI delight not in baiting himI would jog as gently by him as by the ass that grazes on the common but he has obstinately blocked up my wayhe has already tossed and gored me severelyI must make an effort or he batters me down and leaves me to bite the dust  The weapon I must use is not of that brilliant and keen quality which in a skilful hand neatly cuts up the subject to the delight and admiration of the byestanders It is a homely cudgel of Narrative a blunt batoon of Matter of fact affording little display of art in the wielder and so heavy in its nature that it can merely claim the merit of being appropriate to the opponent at whom it is levelled  Pray stand clearfor I shall handle this club vilely and if any one come in my way he may chance to get a rap which I did not intend to bestow upon him Good venal and venomous gentlemen who dabble in ink for pay or from pique and who have dubbed yourselves  Criticks  keep your distance now Run home to your garretsFools ye are but  Ephemera  at best and will die soon enough in the paltry course of your insignificant natures without thrusting  your ears if there be any left you into the heat of this perilous actionA vauntwell well stay if ye are bent upon it and be pert and busyyour folly to me is of no moment  Ye who impartially and conscientiously sit in diurnal judgment upon modern dramatists apply not this to yourselves It aims only at the malevolent the mean and the ignorant who are the disgrace of your order  I hasten now to my Narrative  I agreed to write the following Play at the instance of the chief Proprietor of DruryLane Theatre who unconditionally agreed to pay me a certain sum for my labourand this certain sum being much larger than any I believe hitherto offered on similar occasions created no small jealousy among the Parnassian  Sans Culottes  several of whom have of late been vapidly industrious to level to the muddy surface of their own Castalian ditch so  AristocraticoDramatick  a bargainer The Play as fast as written piecemeal was put into rehearsal But let it here be noted gentle reader that a rehearsal in DruryLane I mean as far as relates to this Iron Chest is  lucus à  non  lucendo  They yclep it a rehearsal I conjecture because  they do  NOT  rehearse  I call the loved shade of Garrick to witness nay I call the less loved presence of the  then  acting Manager to avowthat there never was one fair rehearsal of the PlayNever one rehearsal wherein one or two or more of the Performers very essential to the piece were not absent and  all  the rehearsals which I attended so slovenly and irregular that the ragged master of a theatrical Barn might have blushed for  the want of discipline in the pompous Director of His Majesty's Servants at the vast and astonishing newerected TheatreRoyal in DruryLane  It is well known to those conversant with the business of the stage that no perfect judgment can be formed of the length of a Play apparent to the spectator nor of the general  effect  intended to be produced until the private repetitions among the actors have reduced the business into something like  lucidus ordo  then comes the time for the judicious author to take up his pruningknife or handle his hatchet Then he goes lustily to work my masters upon his curtailments or additions his transpositions his loppings his parings trimmings dockings c c c As in the writing so in the rehearsal  "Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus aut ego fallor"  "Ut jam nunc dicat jam nunc debentia dici"  "Pleraque differat et praesens in tempus omittat"  "Hoc amet hoc spernat promissi carminis Auctor"  But woe is me while I was patiently waiting the expected crisis a circumstance occurred which compelled me to watch a crisis of a less agreeable nature A fever attacked me as I sat beneath the damp dome of Drury and drove me  malgrè moi  to bed where I lay during a week till three hours before the Play was exhibited In addition to the unavoidable injury arising from the author's absence Mr KEMBLE the actingmanager and principal performer in the piece was and had been for a few days previous to my own illness confined  to his chamber by indisposition I lay little stress indeed upon his temporary incapacity to perform his managerical duty his mode of discharging it hitherto was productive of little benefit to meStill it was  some  drawback for were a mere Log thrown amidst a Thespian community and nominated its dull and ponderous Ruler still the block while in its place would carry some sway with itbut his nonattendance as an actor so much engaged in the Play was particularly detrimental  Nay even the Composer of the musick and here let me breathe a sigh to the memory of departed worth and genius as I write the name of STORAGEeven he could not preside in his department He was preparing an early flight to that abode of harmony where choirs of Angels swell the note of welcome to an honest and congenial spirit  Here then was a direct stop to the business No such thing The Troops proceeded without leaders In the dark  Messieur"Sans  eyes  Sans  every thing" The Prompter it is true a kind of noncommissioned officer headed the Corps and a curious march was made of it  But lo two days or three I forget which previous to the public representation up rose King KEMBLE like Somnus from his ebon bed to distribute his dozing directions among his subjects  "Tardâ gravitate jacentes"  "Vix oculus tollens"  "Summaque percutiens nutanti pictora mento"  "Excussit tandem sibi se cubitoque levatus" c  He came saw and pronounced the Piece to be ripe for exhibition It was ordered to be performed immediately News was brought to me in my sickness of the mighty  Fiat  and although I was told officially that due care had been taken to render it worthy of public attention I submitted with doubt and trembling to the decree My doubts too of this boasted care were not a little increased by a note which I received from the Prompter written by the Manager's order  three hours only  before the first representation of the Playwherein at this late period my consent was abruptly requested to a transposition of two of the most material scenes in the second act and the reason given for this curious proposal was that the present stage of Drurywhere the Architect and Machinist with the judgment and ingenuity of a Politician and a Wit to assist them had combined to outdo all former theatrical outdoingswas so bunglingly constructed that there was not time for the carpenters to place the lumbering framework on which an Abbey was painted behind the representation of a Library without having a chasm of ten minutes in the action of the Play and that in the middle of an actSuch was the fabrication of that New Stage whose  "extent  and  powers"  have been so vauntingly advertised under the classick management of Mr KEMBLE in the edifying exhibition of Pantomimes Processions Pageants Triumphal Cars Milk white Horses and Elephants  As I did not chuse to alter the construction of my Play without deliberation merely to skreen the illconstruction of the House I would  not listen to the modest and  well timed  demand of turning the progress of my fable  topsy turvy    Very ill and very weak from the effects of the fever which ha  not yet left me I made an effort and went to the Theatre to witness the performance I found Mr KEMBLE in his dressingroom a short time before the curtain was drawn up taking  Opium Pills  and nobody who is acquainted with that gentleman will doubt me when I assert that they are a medicine which he has long been in the habit of swallowing He appeared to me very unwell and seemed indeed to have imbibed  "Poppy and Mandragora"  "And all the drowsy syrups of the world"  The Play began and all went smoothly till a trifling disapprobation was shewn to the character personated by Mr DODDthe scene in which he was engaged being much  too long  A proof of the neglect of those whose business it was to have informed me in my unavoidable absence from the Theatre that it appea  ed in the  last rehearsals  to want curtailment I considered this however to be of no great moment  Mr KEMBLE was to appear immediately in a sub  quent scene and much was expected from his execution of a part written expressly for his powers  And here let me describe the requisites for the character which I have attempted to draw that the world may judge whether I have taken a wrong measure of the personage whom I proposed to fit premising that I have worked for him before with success and therefore it  may be presumed that I am somewhat acquainted with the dimensions of his qualifications I required then a man  "Of a tall stature and of sable hue"  "Much like the son of Kish that lofty Jew"  A man of whom it might be said  "There's something in his soul"  "O'er which his melancholy sits and broods"  Look at the actorand will any body do him the injustice to declare that he is deficient in these qualifications It would puzzle any author in any time or country from Aeschylus down even to the Translator of  Lodoiska  and really gentlemen I can go no lowerto find a figure and face better suited to the purpose I have endeavour'd moreover to pourtray  Sir Edward Mortimer  as a man stately in his deportment reserved in his temper mysterious cold and impenetrable in his manner and the candid observers I trust will allow that Mr KEMBLE is thouroughly adequate to such a personation  To complete my requisitions I demanded a performer who could enter into the spirit of a character proceeding upon romantic halfwitted principles abstracted in his opinions sophisticated in his reasonings and who is thrown into situations where his mind and conduct stand tiptoe on the extremest verge of probability Here surely I have not mistaken my man for if I am able to form any opinion of him as an Actorand my opinion I know is far from  singularhis chief excellence almost approaches that style which the learned denominate  Caricature  Possibility on the stretch passion overleaping it's customary bound movements of the soul sullen or violent very rarely seen in the common course of things yet still  may  be seen in these is his element As our language is said to have sunk under the vast conception of MILTON so does the modesty of nature suffer a depression beneath the unwieldy imaginings of Mr KEMBLE He seldom deigns to accompany the Goddess in her ordinary walks when she decently paces the regular path with a sober step and a straight person but he kindly assists her when she is doubtless in need of assistance when she appears out of her way crazy and crooked  The arrogant fault of being more refined than Refinement more proper than Propriety more sensible than Sense which nine times in ten will disgust the spectator becomes frequently an advantage to him in characters of the above description  In short Mr KEMELE is a paragonrepresentative of the  Lusus Naturae  and were Mr KEMBLE sewed up in a skin to act a hog in a pantomime he would act a hog with six legs better than a hog with four  If any one ask why I chose to sketch a  Lusus Naturae  when it might better become an author to be chaste in his delineation I can only reply that I did so to obtain the assistance of Mr KEMBLE in his best manner and that now I do most heartily repent me for never sure did man place the main strength of his building upon so rotten a prop  Well the great actor was discovered as  Sir Edward Mortimer  in his library Gloom and desolation sat upon his brow and he was habited from the wig to the shoestring with the most studied exactness Had one of King CHARLES the First's portraits walked from its frame upon the boards of the Theatre it could not have afforded a truer representation of ancient and melancholy dignity  The picture could not have looked better but in justice to the picture it must also be added that the picture could scarcely have acted worse  The spectators who gaped with expectation at his first appearance yawned with lassitude before his first  exit  It seemed however that illness had totally incapacitated him from performing the business he had undertaken For his mere illness he was entitled to pity for his conduct under it he undoubtedly deserved censure  How can Mr KEMBLE as a Manager and an Actor justify his thrusting himself forward in a new Play the material interest of which rested upon his own powers at a moment when he must be conscious that he had no powers at allMr KEMELE owes a duty to the publick to his employer and to an author writing for his employer's house How does he treat the claimants upon his service in this instance Exactly thushe insults the understanding of the first and injures the interests of the two last by calling in a crowd to an entertainment which he knows he must mar  I requested him at the end of the first act to order an apology to be made for his indisposition  lest the uninformed or malicious might attribute the ponderosity of the performer to the heaviness of the author I was anxious to disavow all right and title to those pigs of lead which did not belong to me and of which Mr KEMBLE was the just proprietor But nohe peremptorily declared he would not suffer an apology to be made It should have been made if at all before the play beganThen why was it not madeHe did not  then  imagine that illness would have disabled himSo then a man quits his chamber after an attack which has evidently weakened him extremely and he has no bodily feel no internal monitor to whisper to him that he is feeble and that he has not recovered sufficient strength to make a violent exertionThis mode of reasoning adopted by Mr KEMBLE is much in the spirit of that clown's who did not know whether he could play on the fiddle 'till he tried Be it noted also that Mr KEMBLE was swallowing his opium pills  before  the play began  because he was ill  but opium causes strange oblivious effects and these pills must have occasioned so sudden a lapse in Mr KEMBLE's memory that he forgot when he took them why he took them or that he had taken them at allThe dose must have been very powerfulStill for the reasons already stated I pressed for an apology still Mr KEMBLE continued obstinate in opposing it His indisposition he said was evident he had coughed very much upon the stage and an apology would make him  "look like a fool"  Goodnature in excess becomes weakness but I never yet found in the confined course of  my reading that goodnature and folly would bear the same definition Mr KEMBLE it should seem and he produced at least managerical  authority  for it considered the terms to be synonimous Freely however forgiving him for his unkindness in refusing to gratify a poor devil of an authorwho very anxious for his reputation was very moderate in his requestI do in all christian charity most sincerely wish that Mr KEMBLE may never find greater cause to  look like a fool  than an apology for his indisposition  At length by dint of perseverance I gained my point A proprietor of the Theatre was called in upon the occasion whose mediation in my favour carried more weight with the Acting Manager than a hapless Dramatist's entreaty and the apology was in due form delivered to the audience  One third of the Play only was yet performed and I was now to make up my mind like an unfortunate traveller to pursue my painful journey through two stages more upon a brokendown Poster car whose back lay all the baggage for my expedition Miserably and most heavily in hand did the Poster proceedHe groaned he lagged he coughed he winced he weezedNever was seen so sorry a jade The audience grew completely soured and once completely soured every thing naturally went wrong They recurred to their disapprobation of poor DODDand observe what this produced I must relate it  Mr KEMBLE had just plodded through a scene regardless of those loud and manifest tokens that the Criticks delight not in the  "drowsy hums"  with which he  rang night's "yawning peal"  when DODD appeared to him on the Stage at whose entrance the clamour was renewed Then and  not till then  did the Acting Manager who had been deaf as any post to the supplications of the author for an apologythen did he appear suddenly seized with a fit of good nature He voluntarily came forward  "to look like a fool"  and beg the indulgence of the town He feared he was the unhappy cause of their disapprobation he entreated their patience and hoped he should shortly gain strength to enable them to judge on a future night what he handsomely termed the  merits  of the Play Here was friendship Here was adroitness While the Publick were testifying their disgust at the Piece through the medium of poor DODD Mr KEMBLE with unexampled generosity took the whole blame upon his own shoulders and heroically saved the author by so timely an interposition I was charmed with this masterstroke and at the impulse of the moment I thanked him But alas how narrow is the soul of man how distrustful in its movements how scanty in its acknowledgments how perplexing to itself in its combinations Had I afterwards looked on the thing simply and nakedly by itself why the thing is a goodnatured thing but I must be putting other circumstances by the side of it with a plague to me I must be puzzling myself to see if all fits if all is of a piece And what is the resultMiserable that I am I have lost the pleasure of evincing a gratitude which I thought I owed because I no longer feel myself a debtor Had I abandoned my mind  to that placid negligence that luxurious confidence which the inconsiderate enjoy it had never occurred to me that Mr KEMBLE foreseeing perhaps that an aggrieved author might not be totally silentsteped forward with this speech to the publick as a kind of  salvo  should a statement be made for his rigidity in the first instance It had never occurred to me that Mr KEMBLE was sufficiently hissed yawned at laughed at and coughed down to have made his apology  before  Mr DODD appeared It had never occurred to me that his making his apology at a previous moment would have answered the same purpose to  me  and not to  him  It had never occurred in short that there is such a thing as ostentatious humility and a politick act of kindness and that I should have waited the sequel of a man's conduct before I thanked him for one instance of seeming good will close upon the heels of stubborn illnature and in the midst of existing and palpable injury The sequel will shew that I was premature in my acknowledgmentbut before I come to the sequel a word or two I will be brief to close my account of this the first night's eventful history The Piece was concluded and  given out  for a second performance with much opposition  Friends who never heard the Play read shook their heads Friends who  had  heard it read scarcely knew it again Several I doubt not of the impartial who chose to be active actively condemned and enemies of course rejoiced in an opportunity of joining them  No opportunity could be fairer The Play was at least a full hour too long and had  Job  himself sat to hear it he must have lost his patience But if gentle reader thou possessest  Job's  quality and hast followed me thus far in my Narrative it will appear to thee for I doubt not thy retention and combination that I was unable to curtail it effectually at the proper timethe last rehearsals I was then laid flat my dear friend as you remember I have told you by a fever The Acting Manager did attend the last rehearsals and suffered the piece to be produced  uncut  to "drag its slow length along" surcharged with all his own incapacity and all his opium  How then do I stand indebted according to the articles of this night's statement I owe to Mr KEMBLE  For his illness  COMPASSION  For his conduct under it  CENSURE  For his refusing to make an apology  A SMILE  For his making an apology  A SNEER  For his mismanagement  A GROAN  For his acting  A HISS  This account is somewhat like the Tavern bill picked from Falstaff's pocket when he is snorting behind the arras There is but one halfpenny worth of compassion to this intolerable deal of blame  Now for the sequelI have shewn I think that Mr KEMBLE in the first instance undertook a duty which he  could  not perform I have now to affirm with all the difficulty of proving a negative full in my face that he afterwards made a mockery of discharging a duty which he  would  not perform  After a week's interval to give him time to recruit his strength and the Author time to curtail and alter the Play for the impression which the MisManager and Actor had contrived to stamp rendered alteration necessary it was a second time represented  I must here let the uninformed reader into a secretbut I must go to Newmarket to make him understand meNo Epsom will do as well and that is nearer homeIt often happens at a Race that a known Horse from whom good sport is expected disappoints the crowd by  walking over the course  He does not miss an inch of the ground but affords not one jot of diversion unless some pleasure is received in contemplating his figure Now an actor can do the very same thing He can  walk over his part  He can miss no more of his words than the Horse does of his way he can be as dull and as tedious and as goodlooking as the Horse in his progressThe only difference between the two animals isthat the Horse brings in him who bets upon him a gainer but the luckless wight who has a large stake depending upon the actor is decidedly certain to lose There is a trick too that the Jockies practise which is called I think  playing booty  This consists in appearing to use their utmost endeavour to reach the winningpost first when they are already determined to come in the last The consequence is that all except the knowing ones attribute no fault to the Jockey but damn the Horse for a sluggardAn actor can  play booty  if he chuseshe can pretend to whip and spur and do his best when the Connoisseur knows all the while he is shirkingbut  Sluggard is the unmerited appellation given by the majority to the innocent author  Mr KEMBLE chiefly chose to be Horse and  walked over the ground  Every now and then but scarcely enough to save appearances he gave a slight touch of the Jockey and  played booty    Whether the language which is put into the mouth of  Sir Edward Mortimer  be above mediocrity or below contempt is not to the present purpose but the words he is made to utter certainly convey a meaning and the circumstances of the scenes afford an opportunity to the Performer of playing off his mimick emotions his transitions of passion his starts and all the trickeries of his trade The devil a trick did Mr KEMBLE play but a very scurvy one His emotions and passions were so rare and so feeble that they seasoned his general insipidity like a single grain of wretched pepper thrown into the largest dose of watergruel that ever was administered to an invalid For the most part he toiled on line after line in a dull current of undiversified sound which stole upon the ear far more drowsily than the distant murmurings of Lethe with no attempt to break the lulling stream or check its sleepinviting course  Frogs in a marsh flies in a bottle wind in a crevice a preacher in a field the drone of a bagpipe all all yielded to the inimitable and soporific monotony of Mr KEMBLE  The very best Dramatick writing where passion is expressed if delivered languidly by the Actor will fail in it's intended effect and I will be bold enough to say that were the  Curse in King Lear  new to an audience and they heard  it uttered for the first time in a croak fainter than a crow's in a consumption it would pass unnoticed or appear vapid to the million  If I raise a critical clatter about my ears by this assertion which some may twist into a profanation of Shakspeare I leave it to Horace who can fight battles better than I to defend me  "Si dicentis erunt fortunis absona dicta"  "Romani tollent pedites equitesque cachinnum"  That Mr KEMBLE did not misconceive the Part is certain for he told me some time before the Play was acted that he feared the exertions requisite in  Sir Edward Mortimer  would strain his lungs more than  Octavian  in the  Mountaineers    That he can strain his lungs to good purpose in  Octavian  is well known and after this his own intimation how will he escape the charge of wilful and direct delinquency when with such a conception of the Part and with health recovered he came forward in the true spirit of  Bottom  and  "aggravated his voice so that he roared you as gentle as any sucking dove"  Mr KEMBLE informed me previous to the second representation of the Play that he felt himself capable of exertion  He insulted the Town and injured his Employer and the Author sufficiently in the first instance in the second he added to the insult and injury an hundredfold and as often as he mangled the Character three or four times I am uncertain which after the first night's performance he heaped aggravation upon aggravation  The most miserable mummer that ever disgraced the walls of a Theatre could not have been a stronger drawback than Mr KEMBLE He was not only dull in himself but the cause of dulness in others Like the baleful  Upas of Java  his pestiferous influence infected all around him When two Actors come forward to keep up the Shuttle cock of scenickfiction if one plays slovenly the other cannot maintain his game Poor BANNISTER Jun would he speak out but I have never pressed him and never shall press him to say a word upon the subject could bear ample testimony to the truth of this remark He suffered like a man under the cruelty of  M  zentius  All alive himself he was tied to a corpse which he was fated to drag about with him scene after scene which weighed him down and depressed his vigour Miss FARREN too who might animate any thing but a soul of lead and a face of iron experienced the same fate  I could proceed and argue and reason and discuss and tire the reader as I have tired myself it is now my good friend one o'clock in the morning to prove further that Mr KEMBLE was unsound in my cause and that he ruined my PlayBut I will desist here I think I have  prosed  enough to manifest that my arguments are not unfounded  They who are experienced in  Dramaticks  will I trust see that I have made a fair  extenuation  of myselfthey who are impartial will I hope be convinced that I have set down  nought in malice    The only question that may arise to shake materially the credit of all I have said is  "How is it probable that Mr KEMBLE should injure you thus without provocation Is it in nature Is it in man" I can merely answer that I am unconscious of having given him cause for provocation that if I have given him cause he has taken a bad mode of revenge that Mr KEMBLE's nature has frequently puzzled me in my observation upon it and that I think him a very  extraordinary man    But let him take this with him should this crudely written Preface ever fall in his way I have committed it to paper  currente calamo  I mean no allusion no epithet to apply to him as a private individual As a private individual I give him not that notice which it might here be impertinent to bestowbut I have an undoubted right to discuss his merits or demerits in his publick capacities of Manager and Actor and my cause of complaint gives me a good reason as well as right His want of conduct his neglect his injustice his oppression his finesse his person his face are in this point of view all open to my animadversion  "He is my goods my chattlels"  "My Horse my Ox my Ass my any thing"  And I would animadvert still further did I not think I had already said sufficient to gain the object of guarding my own reputation That object has solely swayed me in dwelling so long upon a "plain tale" encumbered with so fatiguing a Hero as JOHN KEMBLE  ADVERTISEMENT  TO THE READER  I AM indebted for the groundwork of this Play to a Novel entitled  "Things as they are or the Adventures of Caleb Williams written by William Godwin"  Much of Mr GODWIN's story I have omitted much which I have adopted I have compressed much I have added and much I have taken the liberty to alter  All this I did that I might fit it in the best of my judgment to the stage  I have cautiously avoided all tendency to that which vulgarly and wrongly in many instances is termed Politicks with which many have told me  Caleb Williams  teems  The stage has now no business with Politicks and should a Dramatick Author endeavour to dabble in them it is the Lord Chamberlain's office to check his attempts before they meet the eye of the Publick I perused Mr GODWIN's book as a tale replete with interesting incident ingenious in its arrangement  masterly in its delineation of character and forcible in its language I considered it as right of Common and by a title which custom has given to Dramatists I enclosed it within my theatrical paling However I may have tilled the l  nd I trust he discovers no intentional injury to him in my proceeding  To all the Performers excepting Mr KEMBLE I offer my hearty thanks for their exertions which would have served me more had not an actor  "dark as Erebus"  cast a gloom upon them which none of their efforts however brilliant could entirely disperse  But this does not diminish my obligations to themso much indeed I owe to them that when the Play was last performed it was rising spite of  Erebus  in favour with the Town It was then advertised day after day at the bottom of the Playbills for repetition till the promissory advertisement became laughable and at length the Advertisement and the Play were dropt together  If after the foregoing Preface I should at a future period bring the Play forward in the Haymarket Theatre I am fully aware of the numbers who from party and pique may now oppose it I am aware too of the weight which a first impression leaves upon the minds of the most candidStill so strong is my confidence in the genuine decision of a London audience who have a fair opportunity of exercising their judgment and feelings which they have not had yet in respect to this Play that I believe I shall venture an appeal  The Piece is now printed as it was acted on the  first night  that they who peruse it may  decide whether even in that shape with all the misfortunes before enumerated with which it was doomed to struggle it should be for ever consigned to moulder on the shelf  The Songs Duets and Chorusses are intended merely as vehicles for musical effect Some criticks have pompously called them  Lyrick Poetry  that by raising them to dignity they may more effectually degrade them as men lift a stone very high before they let it fall when they would completely dash it to pieces  I now leave the gentle reader to the perusal of the Playand lest my Father's memory may be injured by mistakes and in the confusion of aftertimes the  Translator of Terence  and the  Author  of  The Jealous Wife  be supposed guilty of the  Iron Chest  I shall were I to reach the Patriarchal longevity of Methusaleh continue in all my Dramatick

I make trial of thee  Sams  No will you  Helen  Nineteen in twenty might question my prudence for thisbut whatever loss I may suffer from thy roguery the thought of having open'd a path to lead a

Blanch Will he be here to day  Blanch  A little breath madam and I will answer all duly  Helen  O fie up in thee wench  These interrogatories should be answered  Quicker than breath can utter them  Blanch  That's impossible lady  Helen  Thou would'st not say so hadst thou ever lov'd  Love has a fleeter messenger than speech  To tell love's meaning His expresses post  Upon the orbs of vision ere the tongue  Can shape them into words A lover's look  Is his heart's Mercury O the Eye's eloquence  Twinborn with thought outstrips the tardy voice  Far swifter than the nimble lightning's flash  The sluggish thunderpeal that follows it  Blanch  I am not skill'd in eyetalking madam I have been used to let my discourse ride upon my tongue and I have been told 'twill trot at a good round pace upon occasion  Helen  Then let it gallop now beseech you wench  And bring me news of Mortimer  Blanch  Then madam I saw Sir Edward in his library and deliver'd your letter He will be here either in the evening or on the morrow 'tis uncertain whichfor his brother Capt Fitzharding is arrived on a visit to him  Helen  Is hewell that may somewhat raise his spirits  That soldier has a pleasant harmless

winter's evening  Blanch  Why who are you  Sam  I'm your fellowservantthe new comer The last footman cast his skin in the pantry this morning and I have crept into it  Blanch  Why sure it cannot beNow I look upon you again you are Samson Rawboldold Rawbold's son of the forest here  Sam  The same I am not like some upstarts When I am prosperous I do not turn my back on my poor relations  Blanch  What has my lady hired thee  Sam  She has taken me like a pad nag upon trial  Blanch  I suspect you will play her a jade's trick and stumble in your probation You have been caught tripping ere now  Sam  An I do not give content 'tis none of my fault A man's qualities cannot come out all at once I wish you would teach me a little how to lay a cloth  Blanch  You are well qualified for your office

so We had little order in our family  Blanch  Well I will instruct you  Sam  That's kind I will be grateful They tell me I have learnt nothing but wickedness yet but I will instruct you in any thing I know in return  Blanch  There I have no mind to become your scholar But be steady in your service and you may outlive your beggary and grow into respect  Sam  Nay an riches rain upon me respect will grow of course I never knew a rich man yet who wanted followers to pull off their caps to him  SAMSON  SONG  I  A traveller stopt at a widow's gate  She kept an Inn and he wanted to bait  But the landlady slighted her guest  For when Nature was making an ugly race  She certainly moulded this traveller's face  As a sample for all the rest  II  The chambermaid's sides they were ready to crack  When she saw his queer nose and the hump at his back  A hump is'nt handsome no doubt  And though 'tis confess'd that the prejudice goes  Very strongly in favour of wearing a nose  Yet a nose should'nt look like a snout  III  A bag full of gold on the table he laid  'T had a wond'rous effect on the widow and maid  And they quickly grew marvellous civil  The money immediately alter'd the case  They were charm'd with his hump and his snout and his face  Tho' he still might have frighted the devil  IV  He paid like a princegave the widow a smack  Then stop'd on his horse at the door like a sack  While the landlady touching the chink  Cried"Sir should you travel this country again  "I heartily hope that the sweetest of men  "Will stop at the widow's to drink"  Exeunt  SCENE IV  The  LIBRARY

The knowledge  Has he then breathedCarries within his breast  What does he know  Hel  His own ingratitude  Mort  O very true  Helen  Then leave him to his Conscience  It is a scorpion sent by Heaven itself  To fix on hidden crimes a flow still stream  Of moulten lead kept dropping on the heart  To scald and weigh it down Believe me love  There is no earthly punishment so great  To scourge an evil

Would your worship stoop  To parley with a rogue  Fitz  Friend I will stoop  To prop a sinking man that's call'd a rogue  And count him innocent 'till he's found guilty  I learn'd it from our English laws where mercy  Models the weights that fill the scales of Justice  And Charity when Wisdom gives her sentence  Stands by to prompt her 'Till detection comes  I side with the accused  Sams  Would I

you ample warning Caution'd you  When many might have scourged and even now  While I stand here to crush youaye to crush you  My heart bleeds drops of pity for your youth  Whose rashness plucks the red destruction down  And pulls the bolt upon you  Wilf  You know best  The movements of your heart sir Man is blind  And cannot read them but there is a Judge  To whose all seeing eye our inmost

reward or punishment  Fitz  Now to the point I pray you  Mort  Thus it is then  I do suspectBy heaven the story lingers  Like poison on my tonguebut he will force it  Fitz  What is it you suspect  Mort  That he has rob'd me  Wilf  Rob'd I O horrible  Fitz  Not yetnot yet  Pray tell me brotherI will be impartial  But I am somewhat movedPray tell me brother  How ground you this suspicion  Mort  Briefly thus  You may have noticed in my library  A chest  Wilford starts  You see he changes at the word  Wilf  And well I may  aside  Mort  Where I have told you brother  The writings which concern our family  With jewels cash and other articles  Of no mean value were deposited  Fitz  You oftentimes have said so  Mort  Yesterday  Chance call'd me suddenly away I left  The key in'tbut as suddenly return'd  And found this Wilford this young man whose state  Whose orphan state met pity in my house  'Till pity grew to friendshiphim I found  Fix'd o'er the chest upon his knees intent  As now I think on plunder tinging theft  Still blacker with ingratitude and rifling  The easy fool who shelter'd him Confusion  Shook his young joints as he let fall the lid  And gave me back the key  Fitz  Did you not search  Your papers on the instant  Mort  Nofor first  Habit so long had fix'd my confidence  I deem'd it boyish curiosity  But told him this would meet my further question  And at that moment came a servant in  To say you were arrived He must have mark'd  Our mix'd emotion  Fitz  Is that servant here  Servant  'Twas I Sir  Mort  Was it you Well saw you aught  To challenge your attention  Servant  Sir I did  Wilford was pale and trembling and our master  Gave him a look as if 'twould pierce him through  And cried "Remember"Then he trembled more  And we both quitted him  Mort  When first we met  You found me somewhat ruffled  Fitz  'Tis most true  Mort  But somewhat more when afterwards I saw  Wilford conversing with youlike a snake  Sun'd by your looks and basking in your favour  I bade him quit the room with indignation  And wait my coming in the library  Fitz  I witness'd that with wonder  Mort  O good brother  You little thought while you so gently school'd me  In the full flow of your benevolence  For my harsh bearing tow'rd him on what ground  That harshness rested I had made my search  In the brief interval of absence from you  And found my property had vanish'd  Fitz  We'll  You met him in the library  Mort  O never  Can he forget that solemn interview  Wilf  Aye speak to thatit was a solemn interview  Mort  Observe he does acknowledge that we met▪  Guilt was my themehe cannot now deny it  Wilf  It was a theme ofNo  checking himself  Mort  He pleaded innocence  While every word he spake belied his features  And mock'd his protestation I restrain'd  The chastisement he fear'd nor wou'd I blazon  The wrong I could not fix and subject thus  By general inquiry all the guiltless  To foul suspicion That suspicion lay  Most heavily on him but the big cloud  Of anger he had gather'd burst not on him  In vengeance to o'erwhelm him chill it drop'd  But kindly as the dew in admonition  Like tears of fathers o'er a wayward child  When love enforces them to ruggedness  Fitz  What said you to him  Mort  "Regulate your life  "In future better I now spare your youth  "But dare not to proceed All I exact  "'Tis a soft penancethat you tarry here  "My eye your guard my house your gentle prison  "My bounty be your chains Attempt not flight  "Flight ripens all my doubt to certainty  "And justice to the world unlocks my tongue"  He fled and I arraign him  Fitz  Trust me brother  This charge is staggering Yet accidents  Sometimes combine to cast a shade of doubt  Upon the innocent May it be so here  Here is his trunk 'twas brought here at my order  'Tis fit that it be search'd  Mort  O that were needless  He were a shallow villain that would trust  His freight of plunder to so frail a bottom  Schoolboys who strip the orchard of its fruit  Conceal their thievery better  Fitz  Yet 'tis found  Such negligence is often link'd with guilt  Take notI say not yet that he is guilty  But scarce heard of crafty villain yet  Who did not make some blot in his foul game  That lookerson have thought him blind and mad  It was so palpable'Tis rarely otherwise  Heaven's hand is in it brother Providence  Marks guilt as 'twere with a fatuity  Adam do you inspect it  to Winterton  Wilf  Here's the key  E'en take it freelyYou'll find little there  I value save a locket which my mother  Gave me upon her deathbed and she added  Her blessing

Did he not menace in his pride of power  To blast my name and crush my innocence  Fitz  What do you answer Sir  Mort  I answerNo  More were superflous when a criminal  Opposes empty volubility  To circumstantial charge A stedfast brow  Repels not fact nor can invalidate  These dumb but damning witnesses before him  pointing to the trunk  Wilf  By the just Pow'r that rules us I am ignorant  How
