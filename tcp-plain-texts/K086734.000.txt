 THOMAS AND SALLY OR The Sailor's Return  PRICE ONE SHILLING  THOMAS AND SALLY OR The Sailor's Return A MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT As it is performed at the Theatre Royal in CoventGarden The MUSIC composed by DOCTOR ARNE  LONDON Printed for G KEARSLY at the Golden Lion in Ludgatestreet and J COOTE at the King's Arms in Paternoster Row MDCCLXI  PREFACE  THE public has made so little difficulty hitherto in swallowing nauseous or at best insipid verses when they have been wrapped up in agreeable music that to offer a word either by way of defence or apology for the following trifle seems altogether unnecessary  IT will be easily believed that the author did not write it with a view to acquire the reputation of a genius he must be a simpleton indeed who hopes to give people an idea of his wealth by shewing them a handful of farthings He wrote it merely to comply with the request of a theatrical person whom he had an inclination to oblige it was designed  and finished in somewhat less than a fortnight and his excuse for now suffering it to appear in print and he really thinks such an excuse necessary must be the nature of a musical entertainment which requires that the words should be put into the hands of the audience who would otherwise find it impossible to accompany the performers in what they sing upon the stage  HE is no stranger to the whimsical prejudice which inclines most people to measure the worth of dramatic pieces by their length and because a musical entertainment is unavoidably the shortest of any makes them for that reason deny its being capable of any degree of merit at all But though what he here ventures into the world is neither a Tragedy a Comedy or even so much as a Comedy of two acts he flatters himself there are some few who will not condemn it merely because it is not what it was not  designed for he hopes they will consider that when he sat down to write it he sat down to write a musical entertainment and that a certain poet and critic who is allowed to have been a tolerable judge in such matters has told us no author can compass more than he intends  IF after this any persons have an inclination to find fault with it they are heartily welcome nay he will so far subscribe to their opinion as to confess there are some as bad lines in it as the worst dablers in singsong ever were guilty of but he thought it needless to correct them as every thing of this kind must be castrated in order to make it perfectly musical and stretched and altered to fit the shape of the stage However he would certainly point out the exceptionable lines to shew he is not ignorant of them but that he takes it for granted there will be people enough ready to save him that trouble  THUS far by way of Preface which the author has written only because he is assured there is nothing so acceptable to the purchasers of any thing in the form of a book now adays as a reasonable pennyworth in print and paper and he had a mind to avail himself of the advantages attending an additional halfsheet  FOR the same reason too he might possibly have attempted a Dedication but unfortunately the only personages likely to patronize his performance are united in a particular society and he was at a loss in what manner to order their titles so as to make a proper blazon at the head of a page However in this place he would be understood to inscribe the following rhimes to those vagrant choiresters who like the bards of old sing verses about the public streets and if when they  have thought proper to advance the following ballads to a place in the  Chimneysweeper's Garland  the  Sweetheart's Delight  or any other of their ingenious collections they should thro' their novelty and the prevailing argument of playhouse tunes be the means of rendering more reasonable in their demands those grinders of the muses who have the conscience to expect six and thirty pretty songs in one book for a halfpenny he shall think the time and pains they cost him in composing very well bestowed  TO conclude The author thinks there is no doubt on account of the music which is admirable and the performance which will be excellent but this little piece must come off well upon the stage but after having been acquitted there he foresees some busy people will be for bringing it before the judges in the court of criticism Now he applies himself  to the said judges requiring them to consider all such proceedings as arbitrary at least if not unprecedented He desires that they will suffer the insignificancy of this piece to screen it from their cognizance and that they will not attempt to break a butterfly upon a wheel  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  The 'SQUIRE  Mr BEARD  THOMAS  Mr MATTOCKS  WOMEN  SALLY  Miss BRENT  DORCAS  Mrs VERNON  SCENE The

morning is up and the cry of the hounds  Upbraids our too tedious delay  What pleasure we find in pursuing the fox  O'er hill and o'er valley he flies  Then follow we'll soon overtake him huzza  The traitor is seiz'd on and dies  Triumphant returning at night with the spoil  Like Bacchanals shouting and gay  How sweet with a bottle and lass to refresh  And loose the fatigues of the day  With sport love and wine fickle fortune defy  Dull wisdom all happiness sours  Since life is no more than a passage at best  Let's strew the way over with flow'rs  SCENE II A Cottage  SALLY discovered spinning at the door  RECITATIVE  SALLY  In vain I strive my sorrows to amuse  Stubborn they are and all relief refuse  What med'cine shall I fly to or what art  Is there no cure for a distemper'd heart  AIR  My former time how brisk how gay  Oh blith I was as blith could be  But now I'm sad ah welladay  For my true love is gone to sea  The lads pursue I strive to shun  Though all their arts are lost on me  For I to death can love but one  And he alas is gone to sea  As droop the flow'rs till light's return  As mourns the dove its absent she  So will I droop so will I mourn  'Till my true love returns from sea  SCENE III E  DORCAS  DORCAS  What will you never quit this idle trade  Still still in tears ah you foolish maid  In time have prudence your own int'rest see  Youth lasts not always be advis'd by me  AIR  That Mayday of life is for pleasure  For singing for dancing and show  Then why will you waste such a treasure  In sighing and crying heigho  Let's copy the bird in the meadows  By her tune your pipe when 'tis low  Fly round and coquet it as she does  And never be crying heigho  Though when in the arms of a lover  It sometimes may happen I know  That e'er all our toying is over  We cannot help crying heigho  In age ev'ry one a new part takes  I find to my sorrow 'tis so  When old you may cry till your heart achs  But no one will mind you heigho  SALLY  RECITATIVE  Leave me  DORCAS  Go to I came to make you glad  Odsooks what's here this folly makes me mad  You're grieving and for whom 'tis pretty sport  For one that gets a wife at ev'ry port  SALLY

peevish and so froward still  He'll make your fortune let him have his will  SALLY  AIR  Were I as poor as wretch can be  As great as any monarch he  Ere on such terms I'd mount his throne  I'd work my fingers to the bone  Grant me ye pow'rs I ask not wealth  Grant me but innocence and health  Ah what is grandeur link'd to vice  'Tis only virtue gives it price  Exit  DORCAS  RECITATIVE  Well go your ways I cannot chuse but smile  Wou'd I were young again alas the while  But what are wishes wishes will not do  One cannot eat one's cake and have it too  AIR  When I was a young one what girl was like me  So wanton so airy and brisk as a bee  I tattled I rambled I laugh'd and where'er  A fiddle was heard to b  ure I was there  To all that came near I had something to say  'Twas this Sir and that Sir but scarce ever nay  And Sundays dress'd out in my silks and my lace  I warrant I stood by the best in the place  At twenty I got me a husband poor man  Well rest him we all are as good as we can  Yet he was soo peevish he'd quarrel for straws  And jealous though truly I gave him some cause  He snubb'd me and huff'd me but let me alone  Egad I've a tongue and I paid him his own  Ye wives take the hint and when spouse is untow'rd  Stand firm to our charter and have the last word  But now I'm quite alter'd the more to my woe  I'm not what I was forty summers ago  This time's a sore foe there's no shunning his dart  However I keep up a pretty good heart  Grown old yet I hate to be sitting mumchance  I still love a tune though unable to dance  And books of devotion laid by on my shelf  I teach that to others I once did myself  SCENE IV A Wood  Enter 'SQUIRE  'SQUIRE  AIR  Life's a garden rich in treasure  Bury'd like the seeds in earth  There lie joy contentment pleasure

wander'd o'er the plain  From nymph to nymph I strove in vain  My wild desires to rally  But now they're of themselves come home  And strange no longer seek to roam  They centre all in  Sally    Yet she unkind one damps my joy  And cries I court but to destroy  Can love with ruin tally  By those dear lips those eyes I swear  I would all deaths all torments bear  Rather than injure  Sally    Come then Oh come thou sweeter far  Than jessamine and roses are  Or lillies of the valley  O follow love and quit your fear  He'll guide you to these arms my dear  And make me blest in  Sally    SALLY  RECITATIVE  Sir you demean yourself and to be free  Some lady you should chuse of fit degree  I am too low too vulgar  'SQUIRE  Rather say  There's some more favour'd rival in the way  Some happy sweetheart in your thoughts takes place  For him you keep your favours that's the case  SALLY  Well if it be 'tis neither shame nor sin  An honest lad he is of honest kin  No higher than my equal I pretend  You have your answer Sir and there's an end  'SQUIRE  AIR  Come come my dear girl I must not be deny'd  Fine cloathes you shall flash in and rant it away  I'll give you this purse too and heark you beside  We'll kiss and we'll toy all the long summer's day  SALLY  Of kissing and toying you soon would be tir'd  Oh should hapless  Sally  consent to be naught  Besides Sir believe me I scorn to be hir'd  The heart's not worth gaining which is to be bought  'SQUIRE  Perhaps you're afraid of the world's busy tongue  But know above scandal you then shall be put  And laugh as you roll in your chariot along  At draggletail chastity walking a foot  SALLY  If only thro' fear of the world I was shy  My coyness and modesty were but ill shown  Its pardon 'twere easy with money to buy  But how tell me how I shou'd purchase my own  'SQUIRE  Leave morals to greybeards those lips were design'd  For better employment  SALLY  I'll not be a whore  'SQUIRE  Oh fye child love bids you be

aside your nonsensical jars  Your damn'd party and idle contest  Then let all your strife be like us honest tars  Who shall fight for his country the best  A seafaring spark if the maids can affect  Bid the simpering gypsies look to't  Sound bottoms they'll find us in ev'ry respect  And our pockets well laden to boot  The landsmen mayhap in the way of discourse  Have more art to persuade and the like  But 'ware those false colours for better for worse  Is the bargain we're willing to strike  Now long live the king may he prosperous reign  Of no power no faction afraid  May  Britain  's proud

anchor of liberty fail  Exeunt  SCENE II A Meadow  Enter the 'SQUIRE and DORCAS  'SQUIRE  In vain I've ev'ry wily art essay'd  Nor promises can tempt nor vows persuade  No prospect of success is left

place and so prevail  AIR  All you who would wish to succeed with a lass  Learn how the affair's to be done  For if you stand fooling and shy like an ass  You'll loose her as sure as a gun  With whining and sighing and vows and all that  As far as you please you may run  She'll hear you and jeer you and give you a pat  But jilt you as sure as a gun  To worship and call her bright goddess is fine  But mark you the consequence mun  The baggage will think herself really divine  And scorn you as sure as a gun  But be with a maiden bold frolic and stout  And no opportunity shun  She'll tell you she hates you and swear she'll cry out  But mum she's as sure as a gun  'SQUIRE  RECITATIVE  This way she comes a milking hence begone  Exit  Dorcas  Oh love assist me you that drive me on  The

SALLY  RECITATIVE  HOW cruel those who with ungen'rous aim  Strive to seduce and bring poor maids to shame  That brutish squire but wherefore should I fear  I ne'er can turn falsehearted to my dear  No when he came his last farewel to take  He bid me wear this token for his sake  He shall not prove me fickle and unkind  Or say that out of sight was out of mind  AIR  Auspicious spirits guard my love  In time of danger near him bide  With outspread wings around him move  And turn each random ball aside  And you his foes though hearts of steel  Oh may you then with me accord  A sympathetick passion feel  Behold his face and drop the sword  Ye winds your blust'ring fury leave  Like airs that o'er the garden sweep  Breathe soft in sighs and gently heave  The calm smooth bosom of the deep

thrush  Hard by in a bush  'Twould charm you to hear how he sings  SALLY  But hark pry'thee hark  Look yonder's a lark  It warbles and pleases me so  To hear the soft tale  O' th' sweet nightingale  I
