 Fashionable Levities A COMEDY  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  Fashionable Levities A COMEDY  IN FIVE ACTS  BY LEONARD MACNALLY ESQ  LONDON Printed for G G J and J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The Countess of SALISBURY  MY LADY  THE Attention with which you have protected the British Stage claims the Gratitude of every Dramatic Writer I therefore take the Liberty of dedicating this Comedy to your Ladyship and humbly entreat your Forgiveness for not previously soliciting your Permission  I have the Honour to be MY LADY  With the greatest Respect Your Ladyship's most obedient And most humble Servant LEONARD MAC NALLY  Temple  April    On seeing Miss YOUNGE in the Character of Lady FLIPPANT SAVAGE  THE two scenic Muses had long kept a distance  And scorn'd of each other to borrow assistance  THALIA was pert and MELPOMENE proud  And though of admirers they both had a croud  Not two rival beauties on earth could be seen  More tortur'd with jealousy envy and spleen  Till JOVE to whom all the celestials submit  In matters of WEIGHT or in matters of WIT  Interpos'd his command saying henceforth agree  United in friendship as Sisters should be  And grant as a pledge that your union's sincere  Your mutual pow'rs to some favourite fair  If one can be found amongst mortals below  Deserving the attributes you can bestow  The Sisters obey'd but unfix'd was their choice  Till MINERVA appearing with soulmoving voice  While in scales of suspense both their fancies were hung  Appeal'd to their senses and pointed to YOUNGE  To YOUNGE where the  smilestealing comic  we find  With the  soft  the  sublime  and the  graceful  combin'd  To YOUNGE who can each diff'rent passion impart  Who  pleases  the  judgement  but  conquers  the  heart  And  guided  by NATURE is  followed  by ART  PROLOGUE To FASHIONABLE LEVITIES  Written by  Mr CHALMERS  Spoken by  Mr WROUGHTON  IN Shakespeare's days we only play'd the fool  And men of fashion gavenot tookthe rule  Then Lords were grave and ladies graver still  And only  we  and clowns had wit at will  His mind rejected former classic lore  And drew from Nature's neverending store  But authors  now  we often prove the fact  Must fashion court to teach us how to act  Expose the follies which our statutes spare  And unprotected Virtue make their care  All nature  now  is  customcustom law    And here we bringnot what we thinkbut saw  Tis hard to vary your dramatic mirth  When every folly gives it likeness birth  Which though in life your laugh they may command  Will rather pall than please at second hand  'Tis harder still to suit the general mind  And all our audience in our int'rest bind  Honest John Bull vex'd with the cares of life  With heavy taxes and a scolding wife  Wishes some hours in hearing us to waste  And  galloping dreary Dun  is quite his taste  Sir Foppling too his brains with claret addle  Pronounces  Comedy  to be a  Twaddle    His Lordship by the privilege of folly  Is neither musical nor melancholy  Thinks every honest bard  a queer old Put    "Damme there's nothing in a play like  smut  The politician's allcommanding pate  Would have us dramatize th' affairs of state  Make whigs and tories fight here face to face  And teach the patriots  Unity of Place    Some cry for sentiment and some for wit  And yet our claim to either won't admit  The Critic Bench  Looking into the Pit  for which there's no appeal  Since for the town they judge and act and feel  Did you but know what pangs an author shares  How throbs his heart with anxious doubts and cares  Let past indulgence your attention keep  Though we be dull  Justice  should never  sleep  And if tonight no merit we can claim  The want of  power  not  will  deserves the blame  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN

bundle of letters on his table  Lady Flip  Then Muslin I leave his introduction to youshall be at home all the morning  Mus  Your ladyship's most obedientI leave the laces  going  Never saw a handsomer gentleman  Exit  Lady Flip  What a giddy creature am I but a body must kill timethen the fellow is so elegant  rises  and Sir Buzzard so peevishthe fatigue and apprehension which body and mind suffer after an unluckly run are insupportable my nerves are quite out of tune but Muslin has in some degree elevated my spirits  Enter  CHEATERLY  Cheat  I condole with your ladyship on your hard run last night the aces conspired against youRenounce brag the cunning of the game lies not injudgment of mind but in command of muscles  La Flip  To which I impute your uninterrupted series of good luck  Cheat  I am unfit for bragthe warmth of my heart particularly in your ladyship's presence  bows low  keeps my features in continual rebellionbut no person with a flexible countenance should touch brag the impenetrable looks of lady Frigid Midnight have established her an adept at the game  La Flip  And her nimble fingers give her command of the cards but she lost temper when I got the black knaves it was when you stood on my right and lord Lackacre on my left hand"I have got the black knaves" said I "Lady Frigid""I see you have" said she pointing to you and my lordthen as she puckered up her mouth in an affected smile down fell a few flakes of paint and her skin appeared under the fractures like  old  brick work peeping through the  new  invented composition  Cheat  Her countenance was once tolerable but a long run of ill luck has stamp'd that irrisible discordancy of hill and dale which marks her visage and prevents the smiles of fortune joy or good humour from unbending her to a laugh or the smallest semblage of the amiable    Hums a tune    There is a small matter between us for which I have a very pressing occasion  Lady Flip  Aside  I expected this Ha ha ha I cannot but laugh at your description of Lady Frigid  Cheat  For heav'n's sake say no more of herbut let me have the money  bows  Lady Flip  The money Psha You must have patience  Cheat  Patience for a debt of honour  Lady Flip  I have bills to paymy mercer milliner and mantuamaker are to be with me tomorrow and people of that class you know are rude and importunate  Cheat  But suppose I point out a mode of discharging this debt of honour without diminishing your ladyship's pursewhat say you  Lady Flip  If you have any thing to propose I can honourably receive speak out  Cheat  Your ladyship is not usually slow of apprehensionit is true I have not made an open declaration of my passion  Lady Flip  Sir  Cheat  But my eyes my looks have spoke the workings of my soul  Lady Flip  Goes from him confused  This I never suspected  Aside  Cheat  May I hope for your assistance towards my happiness I have long loved doated and despaired  Lady Flip  Long loved and doated I'm not surprized at that  Aside  Cheat  Sir Buzzard knows of and approves my passion  La Flip  Sir Buzzard approves it  Cheat  He doesand I cannot live  Lady Flip  Hold Sir  Aside  I'm astonish'd  Cheat  I cannot live without her  Lady Flip  Without her without whom  Cheat  Who but Constancedivine Constance  Lady Flip  Aside  Though I despise the fellowIIbut why should I be ruffled  Cheat  She thought I was making love to herself  Aside  Lady Flip  And wou'd you have me accessary to the ruin of a young creature  Cheat  There is no ruin intendedI have open'd my mind to the ladySir Buzzard is my friend and I only solicit your interest I would marry Constance  Lady Flip  No ruin intended could a greater curse befal a young creature than to marry youwho are you Sir  Cheat  Who am I madam a gentleman  Lady Flip  I don't mean to asperse your birth Sir but is not your ruling passion play your principal dependance cards and dice your most intimate connections jockies grooms gamecocks and racehorses I am surprized you could look up to her  Cheat  My fortune and family entitle me to look up to any woman  Lady Flip  Then it must be merely to look up you are no doubt one of Fortune's favourites and her favours follow youyou have large estates in expectancy and considerable rents in Bath Wells Scarborough Southampton and Margate nay more you have as many agents as the first landed gentleman in the country  Cheat  I don't understand this treatment  La Flip  Your connexions manners and conversation  would be perfectly agreeable to Constance's turn of mindher respect for religion her morality philosophy and knowledge of the belles lettres would exactly coincide with your studies in the arts and sciences of play  Cheat  Arts and sciences of play  La Flip  I insinuate nothing injurious to your profession the respect which professors of play receive in preference to all other professors proves it a profession the most l  beral as well as most profitable  ironically  Cheat  She will never forgive the insult of preferring another woman to herself  Aside  Your tradesmen's bills madam are unpaid your ladyship's mercer and millinerand people of that class are so importunate and rudeI do not solicit you to take an active part in my favour only promise not to be an enemy and the debt of honour is cancelled  Lady Flip  You say the debt of honour shall be cancelled Are you aware that Constance has bestowed her favours on young De Courcy of York  Cheat  Yes and that his passion for play was cooled at the last York races which obliged him to take a trip to France for the recovery of his finances  Lady Flip  And his losses she imputes to a conspiracy between you and those friends of yours who were the ostensible winners and to whom you introduced himI sear you have no chance  Cheat  Chanceleave me to thatI have often won with the odds against me then she is a beggar but my passion is disinterested  Lady Flip  And pray now how much of the  uncle's debt of honour is to be paid by this parental kindness to the nieceI see into the schemeand here comes the unfortunate sacrifice  Enter  CONSTANCE  Con  I understand your ladyship desired to speak with me  Lady Flip  To inform you my dear of some engagements but particular business calls me away for a few minutes so I leave you to entertain Mr Cheaterly  Exit  Lady Flippant  Cheat  Aside  Her modest blush puts even my impudence out of countenanceyour solicitude madam to avoid me so strongly indicates apathy to my addresses I almost dread the possibility of convincing you I am sinceredo not turn from me in scorn I may have some claim upon your gratitude though no interest in your heart  Con  Gratitude Oh Your absence Sir I must insist on I will not in future be persecuted by your presumption  Cheat  I acknowledge my weakness in pursuing the impulse of my passion reason checks me but such is the imperious violence of my affection that even your scorn increases my desires by making you lovely in the midst of anger and the blessing I sigh for appears still more valuable more worthy pursuit from the distant prospect you give me of the possession  Con  Prospect Sir  Cheat  Yes madam prospect  Con  You will be pleased Sir to withdraw  walks disconcerted  you are insolent  Cheat  Insolent a hard word madam to a man who prefers you to every other womanI may be bold madam but  Con  I repeat it you are insolent  walks from him  Cheat  I am calm madam I know the impediment to my happiness young lady and have spirit to remove itInsolent ha you prefer a clandestine correspondence with a bankrupt in fame and fortune to the generous addresses of a man honoured with your uncle's approbation and independent of the world  Con  The engagements of my heartbut I will not weep  wiping her eyes  Siryou have with a base and mean cowardice dared to traduce a generous unsuspecting youth whose fortune you have assisted to ruin but whose honour you can never tainta youth who if present you would not dare to look on withouttrembling  going  Enter  Sir BUZZARD SAVAGE  Sir Buz  What's the matter now  Con  Enquire of that gentleman Sir  Sir Buz  What a life I lead my mind kept in a continual fever you and your aunt are a perpetual ague to meher hot fits of levity and your cool fits of prudery operate alternately and I am tortured by you from morning till night  Con  I must tell you Sir that since your house cannot afford me protection I shall leave it and though destitute of fortune I know where to apply for an asylum  Ex  Constance  Sir Buz  "I know where to apply for an asylum"She cannot have a knowledge of our secret or I would suppose she meant the Chancery  a man must now pay as much attention to his ward as if she was his child  Cheat  True and what adds to the grievance if a young fellow marries an heiress he is obliged to settle her fortune on herself though perhaps her person was a secondary objectI shall never succeed here Sir Buzzard  Sir Buz  Pish why not succeed a hundred to one but all she has said is pretenceyou know nothing of women's subtilty they smile they frown they laugh they weep they move but to deceive us and lay a snare in every article of their dress  Cheat  De Courcy is the object of her choice  Sir Buz  Why afraid of De Courcy his friends at York races plucked the poor devil of a pigeon so bare they scarcely left him feathers to fly into France  Cheat  I was presentmay I depend on your assistance  Sir Buz  Is not our bargain concludedon the day of your marriage with my niece you return me my mortgages the bill of sale upon my horses and an acquittance of all demands  Cheat  Depend upon itI have pledg'd my honourassist me and I will pursue my game though she keeps me at bay every step  Sir Buz  Cheaterly I must look about me I came down here for the recovery of my health and am suffering under a precipitate consumption of my purse Do you think the young clergyman plays fair  Cheat  You mean parson Spruce could you suspect a divine  Sir Buz  Why yes I do suspect your divines  in their own hair and boots many of them I believe have thrown off morality with their wigs and kicked away religion with their shoes  Cheat  But Dr Spruce has three hundred a year in the churchhe won a cool fifty from me  Sir Buz  A fifty I lost more to him than would purchase four years of his income  Cheat  Do you want cash I can lend you a hundred here  gives him a note  with friends money should be a common commodity  Sir Buz  Why I lost this note to Parson Spruce last nighthe gave me a fifty and took it  Cheat  Aye Oh I had it from him he gave it to me for a bill on London  Sir Buz  Here comes Colonel Staff and old Ordeal yoked together very naturally as two asses should beI despise them both the Colonel never served abroad yet he prates as bold as if he had experienced half a dozen foreign campaigns  Cheat  And is poor and proud  Sir Buz  Yes but hopes to mend his fortune by marrying my sister I wish him success that they may mutually torment each other  Cheat  Mark Ordeal he is not a less extraordinary character than the Colonel the fellow was a foundling and never knew his parents but having acquired a fortune by trade impudently insults his betters by preaching what he calls generosity  Sir Buz  O confound his generosity he is always setting a bad example with his charities  relieving widows providing for orphans and portioning off young maidens though ignorant as a Hottentot he has got himself rank'd among the literati and sets up for a philosopherthe fellow has come into life through as many shapes as an Orkney Barnacle he was first a block then a worm and is now a goose  Enter Colonel  STAFF  and Mr  ORDEAL  Col  Ha ha ha I have been accusing Ordeal of avarice and he denies the charge  Ord  I do avarice though too often an attendant on age is a vice foreign to my nature no man can accuse me of accumulating money by unjust means or of hoarding it when in my possession whereas avarice is a dropsy of the minda disease that irritates and increases by the means used to assuage its thirst  Col  Have you not refused to lend me a mere trifle and being rich is not that a proof of avarice  Ord  Hear meI consider myself an agent bound to answer for the distribution of that wealth with which heaven has bless'd my industrythe charge of avarice is more applicable to the spendthrift than the prudent the spendthrift grasps at every man's property yet no man is accounted avaricious who conforms to the custom of dissipation though the spendthrift raises his rents and starves his tenantryborrows money and ruins his friend or runs in debt and makes bankrupts of his tradesmen if he drives a carriagekeeps a train of servants plays drinks and plunges into vice the world will call him a damn'd generous fellowI speak my mindthat's my way  Sir Buz  Well Colonel how goes on your affair with my fantastical sister She is a jilt ColonelI hate a jilt  Col  She will soon surrender I have got possession of the counterscarp▪ and shall shortly set up the standard of matrimony upon the crown of the  Sir Buz  Horn workEh  Cheat  The widow has a considerable share of the  toujours gai  in her composition  Sir Buz  Too much to promise constancy but then you old bachelors have such winning waysbut Colonel keep a centinel on my sistertime and possession are two dangerous pioneers the first moulders the cement by degrees and the other saps the foundation  Cheat  Then the widow is so frank degagé and good natured she may grant favors from charity and sensibility which other women would refuse from principle or the prejudice of education  Ord  What Mr Cheaterly has advanced contains profound gravity of judgment but my Clary shall have no modern education I have engaged a master to teach her the Classics to manure the soil by cultivating the seeds of virtueyes I will have Clary cultivated for she is innocence itself free from the bias of example she is guided only by the impulse of pure nature  Cheat  A young lady could not have a more dangerous preceptor the impulse of pure nature will produce every evil that can arise from the politest education  Ord  I am convinc'd she is delicate as the ermine  which would die to preserve the snowy whiteness of its fur  Col  Well said my old friend amorous as May though grey as December  Ord  Grey Nay let me tell you Colonel though snow has fallen upon the mountain there is sunshine in the valleyClara is an Aurora Borealis a blaze in the regions of frigidity  Sir Buz  Ordeal seriously now are you going to marry this ward of your's for love  Ord  Seriously I love the girl as I love my life but if I did not having no relations nor friends to whom I owe any obligation I am determined to make her my heir  Sir Buz  And no doubt she will bring you an heir in return and then bury you  Ord  Bury meGranted when I sleep peaceable under the green turf let her marry some honest young fellow and their children shall bear my name  Cheat  A good way this to raise a family without trouble  Ord  Family I understand your sneer I was a foundling it is true and cannot boast ancestry yet I have a heart susceptible of the tender feelings and sweet solicitudes of humanity Though I cannot claim relations of particular descriptions I know Adam and Eve were our primitive parents therefore consider the world one common family and hold myself bound to all mankind by ties of fraternal love  Sir Buz  And your family kindness is not confined to your brothers but extends to your sisters too  Ord  Clara's father was my friend we serv'd our apprenticeship together set up in the same  branch of trade he failed and died poor but I prosperedhe was a worthy soul and I never speak of him without tears  weeps  Cheat  Ah very good Sir Buzzard because the father was his juvenile friend he would marry the daughter in his old age  Sir Buz  A pretty excuse for a vicious appetite  Col  Hear hear  Ord  Clara's father when on his deathbed bequeathed her to me as a legacy it was a bequest of confidence and I esteem it more than if it had been a million he bequeathed her to me an infant without a mother without relations without friends without fortuneNow though rich in the liberal gifts of nature who hath endowed her with an exuberant hand yet being poor in worldly substance she hath but few attractions for a husband the knight errants of these days are Argonautsthis is the golden age and every thing is bought and sold  Sir Buz  Spoke in the true spirit of commerce my old merchant  Ord  Let me tell you Sir Knight the spirit of commerce is the best spirit in the nation we merchants live by barter and sale it is true but take this with you sir probity is our principle and our character nice as a lady's  Sir Buz  Here comes my moiety of mortalityhere comes the origin of two thirds of my complaints with my widow'd sister the Colonel's tormentor that is to besee they smile at some mischief in embryoAh candied ginger sugar on the outside fire within sweet on the palate biting on the tongue Ordeal keep a  strict eye upon pure nature the aloe is most bitter when green▪  going  Cheat  Nay stay Sir Buzzard  Sir Buz  Stay and my wife coming excuse me I avoid her as I would an epidemic complaint  Exit  Enter Lady  FLIPPANT SAVAGE  and Widow  VOLATILE  Wid  Are you here Colonel I follow you as the little bird does the cuckooMr Ordeal your most obedient how is pretty Clara and when are we to call her Mrs OrdealYou rear her quite a domestic animal she is never seen abroad  Lady Flip  Nor at home sister not even at the windows  Cheat  He fears the sun would spoil her complexion  Ord  She hath indeed a lovely complexion glowing and bright as the Tyrian dye not a modern local blush that hides shame instead of discovering it but ruddy health moving in varied tintsthe lily and the rose vying for preeminence on her cheekO she is pure nature  Wid  But when introduced to life those roses will blow those lilies will fade  Ord  She shall never get into any life but where they may blow and fade naturallyher real face shall never be concealed under a counterfeit some ladies coin complexions and should be punished for high treason in defacing beauty  Cheat  Bravo old Ordeal bravo  Ord  I reprobate imposition of charms a reverend bishop declared to me he was married  two years before he saw his wife's face and that was by accident  Lady Flip  I am astonished a gentleman of your age can be so scandalous so malicious but it is the nature of wasps to retain their buz after they have lost their sting  Wid  Our gaiety provokes their spleen these ancient gentlemen rail at women for speaking scandal yet resort in groupes to every place of public entertainment ogl'ng with their telescope eyes to discover blemishes on beautiful objectsnow here's a piece of antiquity  turning Ordeal round  Ord  I have not pretended to juvenality since the crow's feet appeared near my eyes nay don't bite your lips widow lines will appear in the skin after thirty and are the harbingers to wrinkles  Enter a Servant  Serv  The chocolate is ready my lady  Exit Serv  Lady Flip  Sister let us inMr Cheaterly  Cheat  I attend your ladyship  Ord  Can I pay my respects to Constance my old friend's daughter  Lady Flip  You will probably find her in the studypoor Constance takes the humbleness of her situation too much to heart  Exit L Flip Cheat and Wid  Ord  Colonel I knew the father of Constance intimately a stout fellow and served his country long and wellhe served abroad  Col  Hem  Ord  Strict honour was his principlebut alas he experienced that was not the medium  to promotionso finding carpet soldiers like you promoted over his head he went to India  Col  This widow of mine Ordeal hath a prolific flow of wit and spirits  Ord  Yes and egad I thought she struck you dumbshe has a prolific tongue too sharp as the arrow of a Bornean Indian and tipp'd with poison your union with her will be happyperfectly happythough I recollect she compared you to a cuckoo a bird of omen yes a cuckoo is a very ominous birdpray Colonel is the widow skilled in augury  Col  Damn your cuckoo but your speaking of augury reminds me of a circumstance at the siege of Praguea flock of rooks  Ord  I must go pay my compliments to Constance▪  Col  At the siege of Praguewhen the Prussian grenadiers advanced  holds Ordeal  Ord  Were you at the siege Colonel  Col  My regiment was thereI have served my country  Ord  Oh yes you have done great service to your countryat homeby censuring those who have fought for her abroad  Exit  End of the First Act  ACT II  SCENE I  A Chamber  Lady  FLIPPANT  and  WELFORD  seated  Lady Flip  SIR I must say you presume too far  Wel  I saw your ladyship and admired and if that be presumption who is free from it admiration naturally produced a more tender emotionI communicated my feelings to Mrs MuslinMrs Muslin reported them to your ladyship and your ladyship with a mind liberal as your person is elegant permits me to throw myself at your feet  Lady Flip  You have misconstrued the liberty I allowedmy house is always open to persons of fashion and as a visitor only I expected you  rises  Wel  Nay madam your privy counsellor informed me I should be admitted into the interior cabinet and your principal lady in waiting introduced me in form accordingly  Lady Flip  And shall I call her now sir to shew you the way back  aside  pleasant impudent fellow  Wel  You are not so cruelI see pardon beaming from your eye and frolic smiling on your cheek  Lady Flip  And should I pardon from that instant the servile suppliant now at my feet would lose all sense of obligation and from the mistress's slave aspire to be her tyrant  Wel  I neither desire to be slave or tyrant but to love upon equal termsyou consentI read it in your eyesand I am secret as the grave  Lady Flip  Secret you may be but it is not the mere colour of reputation can protect a woman's honorI might perhaps carry on an intrigue with secrecy but my mind  Wel  Upon my soul I have no design upon your ladyship's mind my heart is captivated and if I did not totally misunderstand my good friend and your ladyship's very good friend Mrs Muslin a certain person whom modesty will not permit me to name is not totally indifferent in your opinion  bowing  Sir Buz

fashionable life my mind is not devoid of sensibilityour education has been different  Con  It was my happiness to receive instruction from a pious and tender mother who early taught me the precepts

susceptible of the tenderest offices of friendshipand where there is feeling  Lady Flip  There is hope of reformationyou would have said soindeed Constance  there are sentiments here which often upbraid me but sure nothing has transpir'd injurious to my honour  Con  The world is censorious madam and those whose conversation is the most entertaining are often the most dangerous to simplicity

is to conquer ourselvesI have good news for Constanceher father is living  Lady Flip  Heav'nsare you serious  Ord  I have had letters from London and he returns by the next ships from Indianay morehe

embassy to the interior parts of the country and his letters were intercepted and destroyedBut seriously has your ladyship known nothing of this before  Lady Flip  Never  Ord  There is roguery on footan express was sent to your seat at York which not meeting the lady there was forwarded to this city and delivered at this house  Lady Flip  I see into it this accounts for the warm impetuous passion of Cheaterly the girl and her fortune were no doubt to be sacrificed between him and my worthy spouse Then you must assist me in persuading Constance to go to Welford it will produce an incident which will punish the young gentleman's passion for intrigue and give Constance an authority over him  going returns  but do you believe my repentance sincere  Ord  I hope sobut I believe nothing without proofthat is my waywhere there is levity the world will suspect and when the world has once cause to suspect a woman her character becomes as much the sport of its malice as if there

FINIS  EPILOGUE To FASHIONABLE LEVITIES  As spoken by Miss YOUNGE  OUR growing Levities too clearly show  That all our troubles from refinement flow  Two ages since we valu'd plain attire  Blueapron'd was the Dame straighthair'd the Squire  They call'd not houshold bus'ness vulgar cares  Nor deem'd it ungenteel to say their pray'rs  But arts improv'd new Levities arose  And Ladies chang'd the fashion of their clothes  Hoop'd petticoats in ev'ry town were seen  The snug rotunda pleas'd the virgin Queen  And beef for breakfast serv'd her Ladytrain  No wonder that her sailors baffled Spain  Yet still we've chiefs with love of glory fir'd  But so had Rome when liberty expired  "We've statesmen too who burn with patriots flame  "But so had Greece when Greece had lost her fame"  "We've admirals who plow the briny deep  "Through azure skies and rolling clouds they sweep  "Invade the Planets in an Air Balloon  "And fright from her propriety the Moon"  Bess was a man when danger call'd her pow'rs  She was a woman in her private hours  Few Levities few luxuries she knew  No cherries then in February grew  Maydukes in April on the bough hung green  And girls wore hangingsleeves till full eighteen  Few mothers teach their daughters grace or sense▪  But tell them taste in dress is excellence  Bid them the Levities of rank assume  And flaunt with spreading bow or nodding plume  Strut in a ridingdress to shew their shapes  Or stalk in boots and coats with tripple capes  Affecting ease but impudently free  The matron leans upon her cicisbee  While  cara sposa  snugly keeps his wench  Defies his duns and revels in the Bench  "Why this is vice not folly" I agree  But still this vice proceeds from Levity  Some souls there are which moral sense sublimes  A few blest spirits in the worst of times  One in whom birth and piety are join'd  Of native worth and truly royal mind  Who with benignant hand her blessings pours  Who knows no Levities but feels for yours  lines which are not marked with inverted commas  an epilogue written by Mr Norris for the author of the
