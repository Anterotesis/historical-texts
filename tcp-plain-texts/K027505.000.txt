 THE TEARS OF  AMARYLLIS  FOR  AMYNTAS  A PASTORAL Lamenting the DEATH of The late Lord Marquiss of  BLANFORD  Inscrib'd to the Right Honourable the Lord  GODOLPHIN  Lord HighTreasurer of  England  By Mr  CONGREVE  Qualis popule√¢ moerens Philomela sub umbra  Amissos queritur fetus  miserabile Carmen  Integrat moestis late loca quaestibus implet  Virg Geor  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  within  GraysInn Gate  next  GraysInn Lane    To the READER  THESE Verses had been Printed soon after they were written if they had not been design'd rather privately to Condole than publickly to Lament for it is not pretended that they are in any kind equal to the Subject But by some Accident many Copies of 'em have been dispersed and one I was informed had been shewn to a Bookseller So that it was high time for me to prevent their appearing with more Faults than their own which might probably have met with Encrease if not from the Malice or Ignorance at least from the Carelessness of an underhand Publisher  I have particularly Reason at this time to apprehend the disingenuous Proceeding of some such Person having lately seen some Verses Printed and Intitled  A Satyr against Love Revised and Corrected by Mr  Congreve who does assure the Reader he never saw or heard of any such Verses before they were so Printed  viz  without either the Name of the Author Bookseller or Printer being Publish'd after the manner of a Libel  THE TEARS OF  AMARYLLIS  FOR  AMYNTAS  A PASTORAL  'TWAS at the Time when new returning Light  With welcome Rays begins to chear the Sight  When grateful Birds prepare their Thanks to pay  And warble Hymns to hail the dawning Day  When woolly Flocks their bleating Cries renew  And from their fleecy Sides first shake the silver Dew  'Twas then that  Amaryllis  Heav'nly Fair  Wounded with Grief and wild with her Despair  Forsook her Myrtle Bow'r and Rosie Bed  To tell the Winds her Woes and mourn  Amyntas  dead  Who had a Heart so hard that heard her Cries  And did not weep Who such relentless Eyes  Tygers and Wolves their wonted Rage forego  And dumb Distress and new Compassion shew  As taught by her to taste of Human Woe  Nature her self attentive Silence kept  And Motion seem'd suspended while she wept  The rising Sun restrain'd his fiery Course  And rapid Rivers listen'd at their Source  Ev'n Eccho fear'd to catch the flying Sound  Lest Repetition should her Accents drown  The very Morning Wind withheld his Breeze  Nor fann'd with fragrant Wings the noiseless Trees  As if the gentle  Zephyr  had been dead  And in the Grave with lov'd  Amyntas  laid  No Voice no whisp'ring Sigh no murm'ring Groan  Presum'd to mingle with a Mother's Moan  Her Cries alone her Anguish could express  All other Mourning would have made it less  Hear me she cry'd ye Nymphs and Silvan Gods  Inhabitants of these once lov'd Abodes  Hear my Distress and lend a pitying Ear  Hear my Complaintyou would not hear my Pray'r  The Loss which you prevented not deplore  And mourn with me  Amyntas  now no more  Have I not Cause ye cruel Pow'rs to mourn  Lives there like me another Wretch forlorn  Tell me thou Sun that round the World dost shine  Hast thou beheld another Loss like mine  Ye Winds who on your Wings sad Accents bear  And catch the Sounds of Sorrow and Despair  Tell me if e'er your tender Pinions bore  Such weight of Woe such deadly Sighs before  Tell me thou Earth on whose widespreading Base  The wretched Load is laid of Human Race  Dost thou not feel thy self with me opprest  Lie all the Dead so heavy on thy Breast  When hoary Winter on thy shrinking Head  His lcy Cold depressing Hand has laid  Hast thou not felt less Chilness in thy Veins  Do I not pierce thee with more freezing Pains  But why to thee do I relate my Woe  Thou cruel Earth my most remorseless Foe  Within whose darksome Womb the Grave is made  Where all my Joys are with  Amyntas  laid  What is't to me tho' on thy naked Head  Eternal Winter should his Horror shed  Tho' all thy Nerves were numm'd with endless Frost  And all thy Hopes of future Spring were lost  To me what Comfort can the Spring afford  Can my  Amyntas  be with Spring restor'd  Can all the Rains that fall from weeping Skies  Unlock the Tomb where my  Amyntas  lies  No never neverSay then rigid Earth  What is to me thy everlasting Dearth  Tho' never Flow'r again its Head should rear  Tho' never Tree again should Blossom bear  Tho' never Grass should cloath the naked Ground  Nor ever healing Plant or wholesome Herb be found  None none were found when I bewail'd their Want  Nor wholesome Herb was found nor healing Plant  To ease  Amyntas  of his cruel Pains  In vain I search'd the Valleys Hills and Plains  But wither'd Leaves alone appear'd to view  Or pois'nous Weeds distilling deadly Dew  And if some naked Stalk not quite decay'd  To yield a fresh and friendly Bud essay'd  Soon as I reach'd to crop the tender Shoot  A shrieking Mandrake kill'd it at the Root  Witness to this ye Fawns of ev'ry Wood  Who at the Prodigy astonish'd stood  Well I remember what sad Signs ye made  What Show'rs of unavailing Tears ye shed  How each ran fearful to his mossie Cave  When the last Gasp the dear  Amyntas  gave  For then the Air was fill'd with dreadful Cries  And sudden Night o'erspread the darken'd Skies  Phantoms and Fiends and wand'ring Fires appear'd  And Skreams of illpresaging Birds were heard  The Forest shook and flinty Rocks were cleft  And frighted Streams their wonted Channels left  With frantick Grief o'erflowing fruitful Ground  Where many a Herd and harmeless Swain was drown'd  While I forlorn and desolate was left  Of ev'ry Help of ev'ry Hope bereft  To ev'ry Element expos'd I lay  And to my Griefs a more defenceless Prey  For thee  Amyntas  all these Pains were born  For thee these Hands were wrung these Hairs were torn  For thee my Soul to sigh shall never leave  These Eyes to weep this throbbing Heart to heave  To mourn thy Fall I'll fly the hated Light  And hide my Head in Shades of endless Night  For thou were Light and Life and Health to me  The Sun but thankless shines that shews not thee  Wert thou not Lovely Graceful Good and Young  The Joy of Sight the Talk of ev'ry Tongue  Did ever Branch so sweet a Blossom bear  Or ever early Fruit appear so fair  Did ever Youth so far his Years transcend  Did ever Life so immaturely end  For thee the tuneful Swains provided Lays  And ev'ry Muse prepar'd thy future Praise  For thee the busie Nymphs stripp'd ev'ry Grove  And Myrtle Wreaths and Flow'ry Chaplets wove  But now ah dismal Change the tuneful Throng  To loud Lamentings turn the chearful Song  Their pleasing Task the weeping Virgins leave  And with unfinish'd Garlands strew thy Grave  There let me fall there there lamenting lie  There grieving grow to Earth despair and die  This said her loud Complaint of force she ceas'd  Excess of Grief her faultring Speech suppress'd  Along the Ground her colder Limbs she laid  Where late the Grave was for  Amyntas  made  Then from her swimming Eyes began to pour  Of softly falling Rain a Silver Show'r  Her loosely flowing Hair all radiant bright  O'erspread the dewy Grass like Streams of Light  As if the Sun had of his Beams been shorn  And cast to Earth the Glories he had worn  A Sight so lovely sad such deep Distress  No Tongue can tell no Pencil can express  And now the Winds which had so long been still  Began the swelling Air with Sighs to fill  The WaterNymphs who motionless remain'd  Like Images of Ice while she complain'd  Now loos'd their Streams as when descending Rains  Roll the steep Torrents headlong o'er the Plains  The prone Creation who so long had gaz'd  Charm'd with her Cries and at her Griefs amaz'd  Began to roar and howl with horrid Yell  Dismal to hear and terrible to tell  Nothing but Groans and Sighs were heard around  And Eccho multiply'd each mournful Sound  When all at once an universal Pause  Of Grief was made as from some secret Cause  The Balmy Air with fragrant Scents was fill'd  As if each weeping Tree had Gums distill'd  Such if not sweeter was the rich Perfume  Which swift ascended from  Amyntas  's Tomb  As if th'  Arabian  Bird her Nest had fir'd  And on the spicy Pile were new expir'd  And now the Turf which late was naked seen  Was sudden spread with lively springing Green  And  Amaryllis  saw with wond'ring Eyes  A flow'ry Bed where she had wept arise  Thick as the pearly Drops the Fair had shed  The blowing Buds advanc'd their Purple Head  From ev'ry Tear that fell a Violet grew  And thence their Sweetness came and thence their mournful Hew  Remember this ye Nymphs and gentle Maids  When Solitude ye seek in gloomy Shades  Or walk on Banks where silent Waters flow  For there this lonely Flow'r will love to grow  Think on  Amyntas  oft as ye shall stoop  To crop the Stalks and take 'em softly up  When in your snowy Necks their Sweets you wear  Give a soft Sigh and drop a tender Tear  To lov'd  Amyntas  pay the Tribute due  And bless his peaceful Grave where first they grew  FINIS
