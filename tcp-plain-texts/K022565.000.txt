 THE PROGRESS of ENVY A POEM IN IMITATION of SPENSER  Occasioned by LAUDER'S Attack on the Character of MILTON  Inscribed to the Right Honourable THE EARL OF BATH  Odium bonorum sede me infaustâ extrahit  Diros scelestâ mente versantem dolos  GROTII Adamus Exsul  LONDON Printed for J NEWBERY at the Bible and Sun in St Paul's Churchyard MDCCLI  Price One Shilling  To the RIGHT HONORABLE THE EARL OF BATH PATRON OF MILTON AND HIS VINDICATORS  The following POEM is inscribed By his LORDSHIP'S most obedient humble Servant  THE AUTHOR  THE PREFACE  TO be studious of bringing Merit in Obscurity to Light is so strong an Instance of Benevolence that it has in all Ages been constantly attended with the highest Commendations while the Destroyer of a Man's Reputation in whatsoever it consisted has been accounted a more odious Criminal than even the Assassin of his Body On this Remark is founded one of the most beautiful Passages in  SHAKESPEARE  Who steals my Purse steals Trash  'Twas mine 'tis his and has been Slave to Thousands  But he that filches from me my good Name  Steals from me that which not enriches him  But makes me poor indeed  OTHELLO  This is so true an Observation that few I believe will doubt that  MILTON  was less offended at the low Price his inestimable Poem was rated at on its first Publication than he would have been at the late mean Attempts to subvert a Fame so well established  To view the Character of this  SON OF DARKNESS  in its most genuine Form let us contrast it with another no less eminent for its Splendor which is the properest I could chuse for my present Purpose as it is particularly so in relation to that  DIVINE AUTHOR  we have lately seen so well vindicated from the groundless Aspersions of almost his only Enemy  In the Course of the  Spectators  Mr  ADDISON  who was perhaps the most candid Critick that ever wrote without deviating from Impartiality took a particular Pleasure in producing latent unregarded Worth that he might show those Cavillers who were daily complaining of a Deartb of good Poetry what noble things of this Kind they neglected  Agreeably to this End is his Criticism on the  old English Ballad of ChevyChace  but his most glorious Works of this Kind are his Observations on the  PARADISE LOST  There is not a stronger Instance of Prejudice and the Force of Party than the Reception this Poem met with in the Author's Lifetime whose unhappy Attachment to wrong  Principles render'd all his Attempts at Fame while living fruitless His admirable Poem lay in Obscurity till Mr  ADDISON  removed those envious Clouds which had been suffered to obstruct its Splendor With what Pleasure does be discover its Excellencies and instruct an ordinary Reader to judge of its Beauties With what Regret does he speak of the sew Blemishes of that Divine Piece which says he  is like writing a Treatise upon the Spots of the Sun  These Remarks are so universally read and approved that I believe every body but  LAUDER  and his Friends if he has any will concur with me in the following Observation Had Mr  ADDISON  never wrote a Line but his Critique upon  MILTON  that would alone have been sufficient to have established his Reputation as a fine Writer and a good Man  If the Reader would view the exact Reverse of the above Character let him turn his Eyes on  LAUDER  A Being so utterly void of Candour and Benevolence that he has thought it worth his While to commit the grossest Forgeries to disturb if possible the Ashes of our Poet and has been more industrious to depreciate the  Paradise Lost  than the Writers in the Beginning of this Century were to heap Encomiums upon it The Inhumanity and amazing Impudence of these Proceedings have puzzled all to devise a likely Reason for so  strange a Piece of Malice The faint Excuses alledged for this Behaviour in  LAUDER'S Recantation  by no Means palliate his Crime notwithstanding the florid Dress he has cloathed them in Though I am far from being admitted into his secret Counsels I believe I may venture to mention one which out of his usual Regard to Truth he has purposely omitted It is very possible the same thing which has often made Poets tempted  LAUDER  to unmake one  viz  Poverty and the Hopes of a Subscription  These potent Arguments once induced him to commend with some Warmth the very same Poem he has lately been at so much Pains to brand as a Work of no Genius But as Honesty would no longer procure him a Dinner his Conscience did not prevent him from turning the Tables  Rem faciam Rem Si possim rectè si non quocunque modo Rem  But we will urge this no farther remembering that it is not right to speak Ill of the  Dead  PREFACES  are commonly intended for Discourses to the Reader on the Book he is entering upon but the Consideration of a Being quite divested of Modesty and Humanity naturally led me into the foregoing Reflections arising from the Subject of these Sheets  I shall not trouble the Reader with an Account of the Time I was employed in writing it or insipidly petition the Favour of the Criticks but commit it to the World  With all its Imperfections on its Head  An Attempt to overthrow the bold Assertions of  LAUDER  by Poetry till he had been foiled at his own Weapons would hardly have succeeded But when so invincible a Champion as Mr  DOUGLAS  had taken the Field and returned victorious the  MUSES  who were particularly interested in the Contest should adorn him with the Insignia of a Triumph  This Hint has already given Rise to the  Pandaemonium  and the following Stanzas in Imitation of  SPENSER  The Design of our several Pieces are so very different that it is almost impossible they should clash in point of Merit If we both meet with Success according to our various Models we need not be disheartened at any accidental Rivalship or absurd Comparison an injudicious Reader may draw between us  Mr  DRYDEN  in some Part of his Works has an Observation hinting at  Poetical Genealogy We have amongst us  says he  our Lines and Descents in as regular a manner as the noblest Families  In deducing the best  English  Writers from their poetick Original he observes that  MILTON  is the first Descendant from  SPENSER  This Remark of so great a Judge as Mr  DRYDEN  induced me to chuse  SPENSER  for my Model and to place him by the Side of  APOLLO  in my  Poem  imagining there was a peculiar Propriety in shielding the Son under the Protection of the Father  As I did not suppose that Imitations were bound to transcribe the Faults as well as Excellencies of their Original I made no Scruple of making a slight Alteration in  SPENSER'S Stanza  which is universally condemned for the Redundancy of its correspondent Rhimes The Difficulty I should have found in the Execution had perhaps some Share in this voluntary Omission Allowing this to be certain my judicious Reader will be so far from thinking it a Blemish that I am persuaded he will readily compound for the Loss of some of my Bells provided I can entertain him more rationally I have in general rather wished to fall into  SPENSER  'S Way of Thinking than his Manner of cloathing his Sentiments because I think his Imagery infinitely superior to his Stile I have however be  n so far from neglecting his Language that except those Places where I found the old Words express less than the modern I always gave them the Preference Whether I have transfused any of the divine Spirit of  SPENSER  into the following Stanzas and whether his Style is successfully imitated the Reader must judge for himself  The Mention I made of the slight Variation from  SPENSER  'S Stanza was meerly to prevent the Nibblers of the Age from imputing it to Ignorance These wouldbe Criticks take great Pains to pervert the Movements of the human Mind which certainly has more Pleasure in bestowing Commendations than Dispraise I beg Leave to show the Truth of this Assertion by an Instance drawn from myself as an Author Whatever Satisfaction it may have afforded me to stigmatize the Malice of  LAUDER  'S Proceedings nothing in the whole Course of this Work pleased me so much as celebrating Mr  DOUGLAS  If the following Trifle should meet with the Approbation of the Publick I hope that Gentleman will think it an acceptable Present to Himself  THE PROGRESS OF ENVY  I  AH me unhappy State of mortal Wight  Sith ENVY'S sure Attendant upon Fame  Ne doth she rest from rancorous Despight  Until she works him mickle Woe and Shame  Unhappy he whom ENVY thus doth spoil  Ne doth she check her ever restless Hate  Until she doth his Reputation foil  Ah luckless Imp is he whose Worth elate  Forces him pay this heavy Tax for being great  II  There stood an ancient Mount yclept  Parnass  The fair Domain of sacred Poesy  Which with fresh Odours everblooming was  Besprinkled with the Dew of  Castaly  Which now in soothing Murmurs whisp'ring glides  Wat'ring with genial Waves the fragrant Soil  Now rolls adown the Mountain's steepy Sides  Teaching the Vales full beauteously to smile  Dame NATURE'S handywork not form'd by lab'ring Toil  III  The MUSES fair these peaceful Shades among  With skilful Fingers sweep the trembling Strings  The Air in Silence listens to the Song  And TIME forgets to ply his lazy Wings  Palevisag'd CARE with foul unhallow'd Feet  Attempts the Summit of the Hill to gain  Ne can the Hag arrive the blissful Seat  Her unavailing Strength is spent in vain  CONTENT sits on the Top and mocks her empty Pain  IV  Oft PHOEBUS self left his divine Abode  And here enshrouded in a shady Bow'r  Regardless of his State lay'd by the God  And own'd sweet Music's more alluring Pow'r  On either Side was plac'd a peerless Wight  Whose Merit long had fill'd the Trump of FAME  This FANCY'S darling Child was SPENSER hight  Who pip'd full pleasing on the Banks of  Tame  That no less fam'd than He and MILTON was his Name  V  In these cool Bow'rs they live supinely calm  Now harmless talk now emulously sing  While VIRTUE pouring round her sacred Balm  Makes Happiness eternal as the Spring  Alternately they sung now SPENSER 'gan  Of Jousts and Tournaments and Champions strong  Now MILTON sung of disobedient Man  And  Eden  lost The Bards around them throng  Drawn by the wond'rous Magick of their Prince's Song  VI  Not far from these Dan CHAUCER antient Wight  A lofty Seat on Mount  Parnassus  held  Who long had been the MUSE'S chief Delight  His reverend Locks were silver'd over with Eld  Grave was his Visage and his Habit plain  And while he sung fair Nature he display'd  In Verse albeit uncouth and simple Strain  Ne mote he well be seen so thick the Shade  Which Elms and aged Oaks had all around him made  VII  Next SHAKESPEARE sat irregularly great  And in his Hand a magick Rod did hold  Which visionary Beings did create  And turn'd the foulest Dross to purest Gold  Whatever Spirits rove in Earth or Air  Or bad or good obey his dread Command  To his Behests these willingly repair  Those aw'd by Terrors of his magick Wand  The which not all their Pow'rs united might withstand  VIII  Beside the Bard there stood a beauteous Maid  Whose glittering Appearance dimm'd the Eyen  Her thinwrought Vesture various Tints display'd  FANCY her Name ysprong of Race divine  Her Mantle  Wimpled  A Word used by  Spenser  for  h  ng down  The Line inclosed within Comma's is one of  Fairfax  's in his Translation of  Tasso  wimpled low her silken Hair  Which loose adown her wellturn'd Shoulders stray'd  'She made a Net to catch the wanton Air'  Whose lovesick Breezes all around her play'd  And seem'd in Whispers soft to court the heav'nly Maid  IX  And ever and anon she wav'd in Air  A Sceptre fraught with allcreative Pow'r  She wav'd it round Eftsoons there did appear  Spirits and Witches Forms unknown before  Again she lifts her wonderworking Wand  Eftsoons upon the flow'ry Plain was seen  The gay Inhabitants of  Fairie  Land  And blithe Attendants upon MAB their Queen  In mystick Circles danc'd along th' inchanted Green  X  On th' other Side stood NATURE Goddess fair  A Matron seem'd she and of Manners staid  Beauteous her Form majestick was her Air  In loose Attire of purest White array'd  A potent Rod she bore whose Power was such  As from her Darling's Works may well be shown  That often with its soulenchanting Touch  She rais'd or Joy or caus'd the deepfelt Groan  And each Man's Passions made subservient to her own  XI  But lo thick Fogs from out the Earth arise  And murky Mists the buxom Air invade  Which with Contagion dire infect the Skies  And all around their baleful Influence shed  Th' infected Sky which whilom was so fair  With thick Cimmerian Darkness is o'erspread  The Sun which whilom shone without Compare  Muffles in pitchy Veil his radiant Head  And sore the Time soregrieving seeks his wat'ry Bed  XII  ENVY the Daughter of fell  Acheron  The Flood of deadly Hate and gloomy Night  Had left precipitate her  Stygian  Throne  And thro' the frighted Heavens wing'd her Flight  With careful Eye each Realm she did explore  Ne mote she ought of Happiness observe  For Happiness alas was now no more  Sith ev'ry one from Virtue's Paths did swerve  And trample on Religion base Designs to serve  XIII  At length on blest  Parnassus  seated high  Their Temples circled with a Laurel Crown  SPENSER and MILTON met her scowling Eye  And turn'd her horrid Grin unto a Frown  Full fast unto her Sister did she post  There to unload the Venom of her Breast  To tell how all her Happiness was crost  Sith others were of Happiness possest  Did never gloomy Hell send forth like ugly Pest  XIV  Within the Covert of a gloomy Wood  When fun'ral Cypress starproof Branches spread  O'ergrown with tangling Briers a Cavern stood  Fit Place for Melancholy  Dreary head  Gloominess  Drearyhead  Here a deformed Monster joy'd to won  Which on fell Rancour ever was ybent  All from the rising to the setting Sun  Her Heart pursued Spite with black Intent  Ne could her iron Mind at human Woes relent  XV  In flowing sable Stole she was yclad  Which with her Countenance did well accord  Forth from her Mouth like one thro' Grief gone mad  A frothy Sea of nauseous Foam was pour'd  A ghastly Grin and Eyes asquint display  The Rancour which her hellish Thoughts contain  And how when Man is blest she pines away  Burning to turn his Happiness to Pain  MALICE the Monster's Name a Foe to God and Man  XVI  Along the Floor black loathsome Toads do crawl  Their Gullets swell'd with Poison's mortal Bane  Which ever and anon they spit at all  Whom hapless Fortune leads too near her Den  Around her Waste in Place of silken Zone  A lifedevouring Viper rear'd his Head  Who no Distinction made 'twixt Friend and Foen  But Death on ey'ry Side fierce brandished  Fly reckless Mortals fly in vain is  Hardyhead  Courage  Hardyhead  XVII  Impatient ENVY thro' the aetherial Waste  With inward Venom fraught and deadly Spite  Unto this Cavern steer'd her panting Haste  Enshrouded in a darksome Veil of Night  Her inmost Heart burnt with impetuous Ire  And fell Destruction sparkled in her Look  Her ferret Eyes flash'd with revengeful Fire  A while contending Passions Utt'rance choke  At length the Fiend in furious Tone her Silence broke  XVIII  Sister arise See how our Pow'r decays  No more our Empire thou and I can boast  Sith mortal Man now gains immortal Praise  Sith Man is blest and thou and I are lost  See in what State  Parnassus  ' Hill appears  See PHOEBUS' self two happy Bards atween  See how the God their Song attentive hears  This SPENSER hight that MILTON well I ween  Who can behold unmov'd sike hearttormenting Scene  XIX  Sister arise ne let our Courage droop  Perforce we will compel these Mortals own  That mortal Force unto our Force shall stoop  ENVY and MALICE then shall reign alone  Thou best has known to file thy Tongue with Lies  And to deceive Mankind with specious Bait  Like TRUTH accoutred spreadest Forgeries  The Fountain of Contention and of Hate  Arise unite with me and be as whilom great  XX  The Fiend obey'd and with impatient Voice  Tremble ye Bards within that blissful Seat  MALICE and ENVY shall o'erthrow your Joys  Nor PHOEBUS self shall out Designs defeat  Shall we who under Friendship's feigned Veil  Prompted the bold Archangel to rebel  Shall we who under Show of sacred Zeal  Plung'd half the Pow'rs of Heav'n in lowest Hell  Such vile Disgrace of us no mortal Man shall tell  XXI  And now more hideous render'd to the Sight  By reason of her raging Cruelty  She burnt to go equipt in dreadful Plight  And find fit Engine for her Forgery  Her Eyes inflam'd did cast their Rays askance  While hellish Imps prepare the Monster's Car  In which she might cut thro' the wide Expanse  And find out Nations that extended far  When all was pitchy dark ne twinkled one bright Star  XXII  Black was her Chariot drawn by Dragons dire  And each fell Serpent had a double Tongue  Which ever and anon spit flaming Fire  The Regions of the tainted Air emong  A lofty Seat the Sistermonsters bore  In deadly Machinations close combin'd  Dull FOLLY drove with terrible Uproar  And cruel DISCORD follow'd fast behind  God help the Man 'gainst whom such Caitiff Foesare join'd  XXIII  Aloft in Air the rattling Chariot flies  While Thunder harshly grates upon its Wheels  Black pointed Spires of Smoke around them rise  The Air depress'd unusual Burthen feels  Detested Sight In terrible Array  They spur their fiery Dragons on amain  Ne mote their Anger suffer cold Delay  Until the wish'dfor Region they obtain  And land their dingy Car on  Caledonian  Plain  XXIV  Here elder Son of MALICE long had dwelt  A Wretch of all the Joys of Life forlorn  His Fame on double Falsities was built  Ah worthless Son of worthless Parent born  Under the Shew of Semblance fair he veil'd  The black Intentions of his hellish Breast  And by these guileful Means he more prevail'd  Than had he open Enmity profest  The Wolf more safely wounds when in Sheep's Cloathing drest  XXV  Him then themselves atween they joyful place  Sure Signs of Woe when such are pleas'd alas  Then measure back the Air with swifter Pace  Until they reach the Foot of Mount  Parnass  Hither in evil Hour the Monsters came  And with their new Companion did alight  Who long had lost all Sense of virtuous Shame  Beholding worth with poisonous Despight  On his Success depends their impious Delight  XXVI  Long burnt he sore the Summit to obtain  And spread his Venom o'er the blissful Seat  Long burnt he sore but still he burnt in vain  Mote none come then who come with impious Feet  At length at unawares he out doth spit  That Spite which else had to himself been Bane  The Venom on the Breast of  Milton  lit  And spread benumbing Death thro' every Vein  The Bard of Life bereft fell senseless on the Plain  XXVII  As at the Banquet of  Thyestes  old  The Sun is said t'have shut his radiant Eye  So did he now thro' Grief his Beams withhold  And Darkness to be felt o'erwhelm'd the Sky  Forth issued from their dismal dirk Abodes  The Birds attendant upon hideous Night  Shriekowls and Ravens whose fell croaking bodes  Approaching Death to miserable Wight  Did never Mind of Man behold sike dreadful Sight  XXVIII  APOLLO wails his Darling done to die  By foul Attempt of ENVY'S fatal Bane  The MUSES sprinkle him with Dew of  Castaly  And crown his Death with many a living Strain  Hoary PARNASSUS beats his aged Breast  Aged yet ne'er before did Sorrow know  The Flowers drooping their Despair attest  Th' aggrieved Rivers querulously flow  All Nature sudden groan'd with sympathetick Woe  XXIX  But lo the Sky a gayer Livery wears  The melting Clouds begin to fade apace  And now the Cloak of Darkness disappears  May Darkness ever thus to Light give Place  Erst griev'd APOLLO jocund Looks resumes  The Nine renew their whilom chearful Song  No Grief PARNASSUS' aged Breast consumes  Forth from the teeming Earth new Flowers sprong  The plenteous Rivers flow'd full peacefully along  XXX  The stricken Bard fresh vital Heat renews  Whose Blood erst stagnate rushes thro' his Veins  Life thro' each Pore her Spirit doth infuse  And FAME by MALICE inexpulsive reigns  And see a female Form all heav'nly bright  Upheld by one of mortal Progeny  A female Form yclad in snowy White  Ne half so fair at Distance seems as nigh  DOUGLAS and TRUTH appear ENVY and LAUDER die  FINIS
