 Love in a Village A COMIC OPERA As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  LONDON Printed by W GRIFFIN For J NEWBERY and W NICOLL in St Paul's ChurchYard G KEARSLY in LudgateStreet T DAVIES in RusselStreet CoventGarden and J WALTER at CharingCross MDCCLXIII  TO MR BEARD  SIR  IT is with great pleasure I embrace this opportunity to acknowledge the favours I have received from you Among others I would mention in particular the warmth with which you espoused this piece in its passage to the stage but that I am afraid it would be thought a compliment to your good na∣ture too much at the expence of your judge∣ment  If this Opera is considered merely as a piece of Dramatic writing it will certainly be found to have very little merit in that light no one can think more indifferently of it than I do myself but I believe I may venture to assert on your opinion that some of the songs are tollerable that the music is more pleasing than has hitherto appeared in any composition of this kind and the words better adapted considering the na∣ture of the airs which are not common bal∣lads than could be expected supposing any degree of poetry to be preserved in the ver∣sification More than this few people expect in an Opera and if some of the severer cri∣tics should be inclined to blame your indul∣gence to one of the first attempts of a young writer I am persuaded the Public in ge∣neral  will applaud your endeavour to pro∣vide them with something new in a species of entertainment in which the performers at your Theatre so eminently excel  You may perceive Sir that I yield a punc∣tual observance to the injunctions you laid upon me when I threatened you with this address and make it rather a preface than a dedication And yet I must confess I can hardly reconcile those formalities which ren∣der it indelicate to pay praises where all the world allows them to be due nor can I easily conceive why a man should be so studious to deserve what he does not desire But since you will not allow me to offer any panegy∣ric to you I must hasten to bestow one upon myself and let the public know which was my chief design in this intro∣duction that I have the honor to be  SIR  Your most obliged And most obedient servant The AUTHOR  Of the Publishers of this OPERA may be had Price One Shilling THOMAS and SALLY OR THE SAILOR'S RETURN A MUSICAL FARCE

with statues fountains and flowerpots Se∣veral arbours appear in the side scenes ROSSETTA and LUCINDA are discovered at work seated upon two garden chairs  AIR I  Rossetta  HOPE thou nurse of young desire  Fairy promiser of joy  Painted vapour glowworm fire  Temp'rate sweet that ne'er can cloy  Lucinda  Hope thou earnest of delight  Softest soother of the mind  Balmy cordial prospect bright  Surest friend the wretched find  Both  Kind deceiver flatter still  Deal out pleasures unpossest  With thy dreams my fancy fill  And in wishes make me blest  Lucin  HeighoRossetta  Ross  Well child what do you say  Lucin  'Tis a devilish thing to live in a village an hundred miles from the capital with a preposterous gouty father and a superannuated maiden auntI am heartily sick of my situation  Ross  And with reasonBut 'tis in a great mea∣sure your own fault Here is this Mr Eustace a man of character and family he likes you you like him you know one another's minds and yet you will not resolve to make yourself happy with him  AIR II  Whence can you inherit  So slavish a spirit  Confin'd thus and chain'd to a log  Now fondl'd now chid  Permitted forbid  'Tis leading the life of a dog  For shame you a lover  More firmness discover  Take courage nor here longer moap  Resist and be free  Run riot like me  And to perfect the picture elope  Lucin  And this is your advice  Ross  Positively  Lucin  Here's my hand positively I'll follow itI have already sent to my gentleman who is now in the country to let him know he may come hither this  day we will make use of the opportunity to settle all preliminariesAnd thenBut take notice when∣ever we decamp you march off along with us  Ross  Oh madam your servant I have no incli∣nation to be left behind I assure youBut you say you got acquainted with this spark while you were with your mother during her last illness at Bath so that your father has never seen him  Lucin  Never in his life my dear and I am confi∣dent he entertains not the least suspicion of my having any such connection my aunt indeed has her doubts and surmises but besides that my father will not allow any one to be wiser than himself it is an established maxim between these affectionate relations never to agree in any thing  Ross  Except being absurd you must allow they sympathize perfectly in thatBut now we are on the subject I desire to know what I am to do with this wicked old justice of peace this libidinous father of yours he follows me about the house like a tame goat  Lucin  Nay I'll assure you he has been a wag in his timeyou must have a care of yourself  Ross  Wretched me to fall into such hands who have been just forced to run away from my parents to avoid an odious marriageyou smile at that now and I know you think me whimsical as you have often told me but you must excuse my being a little overdelicate in this particular  AIR III  My heart's my own my will is free  And so shall be my voice  No mortal man shall wed with me  'Till first he's made my choice  Let parents rule cry nature's laws  And children still obey  And is there then no saving clause  Against tyrannic sway  Lucin  Well but my dear mad girl  Ross  Lucinda don't talk to meWas your father to go to London meet there by accident with an old fellow as wrong headed as himself and in a fit of absurd friendship agree to marry you to that old fel∣low's son whom you had never seen without consult∣ing your inclinations or allowing you a negative in case he should not prove agreeable  Lucin  Why I should think it a little hard I con∣fessyet when I see you in the character of a cham∣bermaid  Ross  It is the only character my dear in which I could hope to lie concealed and I can tell you I was reduced to the last extremity when in consequence of our old boardingschool friendship I applied to you to receive me in this capacity for we expected the par∣ties the very next week  Lucin  But had not you a message from your in∣tended spouse to let you know he was as little inclined to such illconcerted nuptials as you were  Ross  More than so he wrote to advise me by all means to contrive some method of breaking them off for he had rather return to his dear studies at Oxford and after that what hopes could I have of being hap∣py with him  Lucin  Then you are not at all uneasy at the strange rout you must have occasioned at home I warrant during this month that you have been absent  Ross  Oh don't mention it my dear I have had so many admirers since I commenced abigail that I am quite charmed with my situationBut hold who stalks yonder into the yard that the dogs are so glad to see  Lucin  Daddy Hawthorn as I live He is come to pay my father a visit and never more luckily for he always forces him abroad By the way what will you do with yourself while I step into the house to see after my trusty messenger Hodge  Ross  No matter I'll sit down in that arbour and lis∣ten to the singing of the birds you know I am fond of melancholy amusements  Lucin  So it seems indeed sure Rossetta none of your admirers have made a hole in your heart you are not in love I hope  Ross  In love that's pleasant who do you suppose I should be in love with pray  Lucin  Why let me seeWhat do you think of Thomas our gardiner there he is at the other end of the walkHe's a very pretty young man and the servants say he's always writing verses on you  Ross  Indeed Lucinda you are very silly  Lucin  Indeed Rossetta that blush makes you look very handsome  Ross  Blush I am sure I don't blush  Lucin  Ha ha ha  Ross  Pshaw Lucinda how can you be so ridiculous  Lucin  Well don't be angry and I have donebut suppose you did like him how could you help yourself  AIR IV  When once love's subtle poison gains  A passage to the female breast  Like lightning rushing through the veins  Each wish and ev'ry thought's possest  To heal the pangs our minds endure  Reason in vain its skill applies  Nought can afford the heart a cure  But what is pleasing to the eyes  SCENE II  Enter YOUNG MEADOWS  Y Meadows  Let me seeon the fifteenth of June at half an hour past five in the morning  having taken out a pocketbook  I left my father's house unknown to any one having made free with a coat and jacket of our gar∣dener's which fitted me by way of a disguiseso says my pocketbook and chance directing me to this village on the th of the same month I pro∣cured a recommendation to the worshipful justice  Woodcock  to be the superintendant of his pumpkins and cabbages because I would let my father see I chose to run any lengths rather than submit to what his obsti∣nacy would have forced me a marriage against my in∣clination  with a woman I never saw  puts up the book and takes a wateringpot  Here I have been three weeks and in that time I am as much altered as if I had changed my nature with my habit 'Sdeath to fall in love with a chambermaid And yet if I could forget that I am the son and heir of sir William MeadowsBut that's impossible  AIR V  Oh had I been by fate decreed  Some humble cottage swain  In fair Rossetta's sight to feed  My sheep upon the plain  What bliss had I been born to taste  Which now I ne'er must know  Ye envious pow'rs why have ye plac'd  My fair one's lot so low  Hah who was it I had a glimpse of as I past by that arbour was it not she sat reading there the trembling of my heart tells me my eyes were not mistakenHere she comes  SCENE III  YOUNG MEADOWS ROSSETTA  Ross  Lucinda was certainly in the right of it and yet I blush to own my weakness even to myselfMarry hang the fellow for not being a gentleman  Y Meadows  I am determined I won't speak to her  turning to a rose tree and plucking the flowers  Now or never is the time to conquer myself Besides I have some reason to believe the girl has no aversion to me  and as I wish not to do her an injury it would be cruel to fill her head with notions of what can never happen  hums a tune  Psha rot these roses how they prick one's fingers  Ross  He takes no notice of me but so much the better I'll be as indifferent as he is I am sure the poor lad likes me and if I was to give him any en∣couragement I suppose the next thing he talked of would be buying a ring and being asked in churchOh dear pride I thank you for that thought  Y Meadows  Hah going without a word a lookI can't bear thatMrs Rossetta I am ga∣thering a few roses here if you'll please to take them in with you  Ross  Thank you Mr Thomas but all my lady's flowerpots are full  Y Meadows  Will you accept of them for yourself then  catching hold of her  What's the matter you look as if you were angry with me  Ross  Pray let go my hand  Young Mead  Nay pr'ythee why is this you shan't go I have something to say to you  Ross  Well but I must go I will go I desire Mr Thomas  AIR VI  Gentle youth ah tell me why  Still you force me thus to fly  Cease oh cease to persevere  Speak not what I must not hear  To my heart it's ease restore  Go and never see me more  SCENE IV  YOUNG MEADOWS  This girl is a riddleThat she loves me I think there is no room to doubt she takes a thousand opportunities to let me see it and yet when I speak to her she will hardly give me an answer and if I attempt the smallest familiarity is gone in an instantI feel my passion for her grow every day more and more violentWell would I marry her would I make a mistress of her if I could Two things called prudence and honour forbid either What am I pursuing then a shadow Sure my evil genius laid this snare in my way However there is one comfort it is in my power to fly from it if so why do I hesitate I am dis∣tracted unable to determine any thing  AIR VII  Still in hopes to get the better  Of my stubborn flame I try  Swear this moment to forget her  And the next my oath deny  Now prepar'd with scorn to treat her  Ev'ry charm in thought I brave  Boast my freedom fly to meet her  And confess myself a slave  SCENE V  A hall in Justice WOODCOCK's house Enter HAW∣THORN with a fowling piece in his hand and a net with birds at his girdle and afterwards Justice WOODCOCK  AIR VIII  There was a jolly miller once  Lived on the river Dee  He work'd and sung from morn 'till night  No lark more blyth than he  And this the burthen of his song  For ever used to be  I eare for nobody not I  If no one cares for me  House here house what all gadding all abroad house I say hilli ho ho  J Woodcock  Here's a noise here's a racket  Wil∣liam Robert Hodge  why does not somebody answer Odds my life I believe the fellows have lost their hearing  Entering  Oh master  Hawthorn  I guessed it was some mad capAre you there  Hawth  Am I here yes and if you had been where I was three hours ago you would find the good effects of it by this time but you have got the lazy unwhol∣some London fashion of lying a bed in a morning and there's gout for youWhy Sir I have not been in bed five minutes after sunrise these thirty years am generally up before it and I never took a dose of phy∣sic but once in my life and that was in compliment to  a cousin of mine an apothecary that had just set up business  J Woodcock  Well but master  Hawthorn  let me tell you you know nothing of the matter for I say sleep is necessary for a man ay and I'll maintain it  Hawth  What when I maintain the contraryLook you neighbour  Woodcock  you are a rich man a man of worship a justice of peace and all that but learn to know the respect that is due to the sound from the infirm and allow me the superiority a good constitution gives me over youHealth is the great∣est of all possessions and 'tis a maxim with me that an hail cobler is a better man than a sick king  J Woodcock  Well well you are a sportsman  Hawth  And so would you too if you would take my advice A Sportsman quotha why there is nothing like it I would not exchange the satisfaction I feel while I am beating the lawns and thickets about my little farm for all the entertainments and pageantry in Chris∣tendom  AIR IX  Let gay ones and great  Make the most of their fate  From pleasure to pleasure they run  Well who cares a jot  I envy them not  While I have my dog and my gun  For exercise air  To the fields I repair  With spirits unclouded and light  The blisses I find  No stings leave behind  But health and diversion unite  SCENE VI  Justice WOODCOCK HAWTHORN HODGE  Hodge  Did your worship call Sir  J Woodcock  Call Sir where have you and the rest of those rascals been but I suppose I need not askYou must know there is a statute a fair for hiring ser∣vants held upon my green to day we have it usually at this season of the year and it never fails to put all the folks hereabout out of their senses  Hodge  Lord your honour look out and see what a nice shew they make yonder they had got pipers and fidlers and were dancing as I com'd along for dear lifeI never saw such a mortal throng in our village in all my born days again  Hawth  Why I like this now this is as it should be  J WOODCOCK  No no 'tis a very foolish piece of bu∣siness good for nothing but to promote idleness and the getting of bastards but I shall take measures for preventing it another year and I doubt whether I am not sufficiently authorized already For by an act pas∣sed  Anno undecimo Caroli primo  which impowers a justice of peace who is lord of the manor  Hawth  Come come never mind the act let me tell you this is a very proper a very useful meeting I want a servant or two myself I must go see what your market affordsand you shall go and the girls my little Lucy and the other young rogue and we'll make a day on't as well as the rest  J Woodcock  I wish master  Hawthorn  I cou'd teach you to be a little more sedate why wont you take pat∣tern by me and consider your dignityOdds heart I don't wonder you are not a rich man you laugh too much ever to be rich  Hawth  Right neighbour  Woodcock  health good humour and competence is my motto and if my exe∣cutors have a mind they are welcome to make it my epitaph  AIR X  The honest heart whose thoughts are clear  From fraud disguise and guile  Need neither fortune's frowning fear  Nor court the harlot's smile  The greatness that would make us grave  Is but an empty thing  What more than mirth wou'd mortals have  The chearful man's a king  SCENE VII  LUCINDA HODGE  Lucin  Hist hist  Hodge  Hodge  Who calls here am I  Lucin  Well have you been  Hodge  Been ay I ha been far enough an that be all you never knew any thing fall out so crossly in your born days  Lucin  Why what's the matter  Hodge  Why you know I dare not take a horse out of his worship's stables this morning for fear it should be missed and breed questions and our old nag at home was so cruelly beat i'th hoofs that poor beast it had not a foot to set to ground so I was fain to go to farmer Ploughshares at the Grainge to borrow the loan of his bald filly and wou'd you think it after walking all that wayde'el from me if the crossgrain'd tead did not deny me the favour  Lucin  Unlucky  Hodge  Well then I went my ways to the King's head in the village but all their cattle were at plough and I was as far to seek below at the turnpike so at last for want of a better I were forced to take up with dame Quicksets blind mare  Lucin  Oh then you have been  Hodge  Yes yes I ha' been  Lucin  Psha why did not you say so at once  Hodge  Ay but I have had a main tiresome jaunt on't for she is but a sorry jade at best  Lucin  Well well did you see Mr Eustace and what did he say to youcome quickhave you e'er a letter  Hodge  Yes he gave me a letter if I ha' na' lost it  Lucin  Lost it man  Hidge  Nay nay have a bit of patience adwawns you are always in such a hurry  rummaging his pockets  I put it somewhere in this waistcoat pocket Oh here it is  Lucin  So give it me  reads the letter to herself  Hodge  Lord a mercy how my arm achs with beating that plaguy beast I'll be hang'd if I won'na' rather ha'thrash'd half a day than ha' ridden her  Lucin  Well  Hodge  you have done your business very well  Hodge  Well have not I now  Lucin  Yes Mr Eustace tells me in this letter that he will be in the green lane at the other end of the vil∣lage by twelve o'clockYou know where he came before  Hodge  Ay ay  Lucin  Well you must go there and wait 'till he arrives and watch your opportunity to introduce him across the fields into the little summerhouse on the left side of the garden  Hodge  That's enough  Lucin  But take particular care that nobody sees you  Hodge  I warrant you  Lucin  Nor for your life drop a word of it to any mortal  Hodge  Never fear me  Lucin  And  Hodge    AIR XI  Hodge  Well well say no more  Sure you told me before  I know the full length of my tether  Do you think I'm a fool  That I need go to school  I can spell you and put you together  A word to the wise  Will always suffice  Addsnigers go talk to your parrot  I'm not such an elf  Though I say it myself  But I know a sheep's head from a carrot  SCENE VIII  LUCINDA  How severe is my case here am I obliged to carry on a clandestine correspondence with a man in all res∣pects my equal because the oddity of my father's tem∣per is such that I dare not tell him I have ever yet seen the person I should like to marryBut holdis not the blame his thenwhen princes are oppressive in their government subjects have a right to assert their libertyperhaps my father has quality in his eye and hopes one day or other as I am his only child to match me with an earl or a dukevain imagination  AIR XII  Cupid god of soft persuasion  Take the helpless lover's part  Seize oh seize some kind occasion  To reward a faithful heart  Justly those we tyrants call  Who the body would enthral  Tyrants of more cruel kind  Those who would enslave the mind  What is grandeur foe to rest  Childish mummery at best  Happy I in humble state  Catch ye fools the glitt'ring bait  SCENE IX  A field with a stile Enter HODGE followed by MAR∣GERY and in some time after enter young MEADOWS  Hodge

you keep your word  Hodge  Hodge  Why no I wont I tell you I have chang'd my mind  Marg  Nay but surely surelyConsider  Hodge  you are obligated in conscience to make me an honest woman  Hodge  Obligated in conscience how am I obligated  Marg  Because you are and none but the basest of rogues wou'd bring a poor girl to shame and after∣wards leave her to the wide world  Hodge  Bring you to shame don't make me speak  Madge  don't make me speak  Marg  Yes do speak your worst  Hodge  Why then if you go to that you were fain to leave your own village down in the West for a bas∣tard you had by the clerk of the parish and I'll bring the man shall say it to your face  Marg  No no  Hodge  'tis no such a thing 'tis a base lie of farmer  Ploughshare's  But I know what makes you false hearted to me that you may keep company with young madam's waiting woman and I am sure she's no fit body for a poor man's wife  Hodge  How shou'd you know what she's fit for she's fit for as much as you mayhap don't find fault with your betters  Madge  seeing young Meadows  Oh master  Thomas  I have a word or two to say to you pray did not you go down the village one day last week with a basket of somewhat upon your shoulder  Y Meadows  Well and what then  Hodge  Nay not much only the Ostler at the Green∣man was saying as how there was a passenger at their house as see'd you go by and said he know'd you and  a mort of questionsSo I thought I'd tell you  Y Meadaws  The devil ask questions about me I know nobody in this part of the country there must be some mistake in itCome hither  Hodge  They walk off discoursing  Marg  A nasty ungrateful fellow to use me at this rate after being to him as I haveWell well I wish all poor girls wou'd take warning by my mishap and never have nothing to say to none of them  AIR XIII  How happy were my days till now  I ne'er did sorrow feel  I rose with joy to milk my cow  Or take my spinning wheel  My heart was lighter than a fly  Like any bird I

adventurer to bring you into my father's house at noon∣day though to say the truth we are safer here than in the garden for there is not a human creature under the roof beside ourselves  Eust  Then why not put our scheme into execution this moment I have a postchaise ready  Lucin  Fie how can you talk so lightly I protest I am afraid to have any thing to do with you your passion seems too much founded on appetite and my aunt  Deborah  says  Eust  What by all the rapture my heart now feels  Luc  Oh to be sure promise and vow it sounds prettily and never fails to impose upon a fond female  AIR XVI  We women like weak indians trade  Whose judgment tinsel shew decoys  Dupes to our folly we are made  While artful man the gain enjoys  We give our treasure to be paid  A paltry poor return in toys  Eust  Well I see you have a mind to divert yourself with me but I wish I could prevail on you to be a little serious  Lucin  Seriously then what would you desire me to say I have promised to run away with you which is as great a concession as any reasonable lover can ex∣pect from his mistress  Eust  Yes but you dear provoking angel you have not told me when you will run away with me  Lucin  Why that I confess requires some considera∣tion  Eust  Yet remember while you are deliberating the season now so favourable to us may elapse never to return  AIR XVII  Think my fairest how delay  Danger ev'ry moment brings  Time flies swift and will away  Time that's ever on it's wings  Doubting and suspence at best  Lover's late repentance cost  Let us eager to be blest  Sieze occasion e'er

and give themselves as many airs as if they were people of qualityHark you friend I suppose you don't come within the vagrant act you have some settled habitationWhere do you live  Mrs Deb  It's an easy matter for him to tell you a wrong place  J Woodcock  Sister  Deborah  don't provoke me  Mrs Deb  I wish brother you would let me examine him a little  J Woodcock  You shan't say a word to him you shan't say a word to him  Mrs Deb  She says he was recommended here bro∣ther ask him by whom  J Woodcock  No I won't now because you desire it  Lucin  If my papa did ask the question aunt it would be very easily resolved  Mrs Deb  Who bid you speak Mrs Nimble Chops I suppose the man has a tongue in his head to answer for himself  J Woodcock  Will no body stop that prating old woman's mouth for me get out of the room  Mrs Deb  Well so I can brother I don't want to stay but remember I tell you you will make yourself ridiculous in this affair for through your own obstinacy you will have your daughter run away with before your face  J Woodcock  My daughter who will run away with my daughter  Mrs Deb  That fellow will  J Woodcock  Go go you are a wicked censorious woman  Lucin  Why sure madam you must think me very coming indeed  J Woodcock  Ay she judges of others by herself I remember when she was a girl her mother dare not trust her the length of her apron string she was clam∣bering upon every fellows back  Mrs Deb  I was not  J Woodcock  You were  Lucin  Well but why so violent  AIR XVII  Believe me dear aunt  If you rave thus and rant  You'll never a lover persuade  The men will all fly  And leave you to die  Oh terrible chance an old maid  How happy the lass  Must she come to this pass  Who antient virginity scapes  'Twere better on earth  Have five brats at a birth  Then in hell be a leader of apes  Mrs Deb  You are an impudent slut  SCENE III  Justice WOODCOCK LUCINDA EUSTACE  J Woodcock  Well done  Lucy  send her about her business a troublesome foolish creature does she think I want to be directed by herCome hither my lad you look tolerably honest  Eust  I hope sir I shall never give you cause to alter your opinion  J Woodcock  No no I am not easily deceived I am generally pretty right in my conjecturesYou must know I had once a little notion of music myself and learned upon the fiddle I could play the trumpet minuet and buttered pease and two or three tunes I  remember when I was in London about thirty years ago there was a song a great favourite at our club at Nando's coffeehouse Jack Pickle used to sing it for us a droll fish but 'tis an old thing I dare swear you have heard it often  AIR XVIII  When I followed a lass that was forward and shy  Oh I stuck to her stuff 'till I made her comply  Oh I took her so lovingly round the waist  And I smack'd her lips and I held her fast  When hugged and hall'd  She squealed and squall'd  But though she vow'd all I did was in vain  Yet I pleas'd her so well that she bore it again  Than hoity toity  Wisking firisking  Green was her gown upon the grass  Oh such were the joys of our dancing days  Eust  Very well sir upon my word  J Woodcock  No no I forget all those things now but I could do a little at them onceWell stay and eat your dinner and we'll talk about your teaching the girl  Lucy  take your master to your spinnet and shew him what you can doI must go and give some orders  "then hoity toity c  SCENE IV  LUCINDA EUSTACE  Lucin  My sweet pretty papa your most obedient humble servant hah hah hah was ever so whimsical an accident well sir what do you think of this  Eust  Think of it I am in a maze  Lucin  O your aukwardness I was frightened out of my wits lest you should not take the hint and if I had not turned matters so cleverly we should have been utterly undone  Eust  'Sdeath why would you bring me into the house we could expect nothing else besides since they did surprize us it would have been better to have dis∣covered the truth  Lucin  Yes and never have seen one another after∣wards I know my father better than you do he has taken it into his head I have no inclination for a husband and let me tell you that is our best security for if once he has said a thing he will not be easily per∣suaded to the contrary  Eust  And pray what am I to do now  Lucin  Why as I think all danger is pretty well over since he has invited you to dinner with him stay only be cautious of your behaviour and in the mean time I will consider what is next to be done  Eust  Had not I better go to your father  Lucin  Do so while I endeavour to recover myself a little out of the flurry this affair has put me in  Eust  Well but what sort of a parting is this with∣out so much as your servant or good by to you  No ceremony at all can you afford me no token to keep up my spirits 'till I see you again  Lucin  Ah childish  Eust  My angel  AIR XIX  Eust  Let rakes and libertines resign'd  To sensual pleasures range  Here all the sexes charms I find  And ne'er can cool or change  Lucin  Let vain coquets and prudes conceal  What most their hearts desire  With pride my passion I reveal  Oh may it ne'er expire  Both  The sun shall cease to spread it's light  The stars their orbits leave  And fair creation sink in night  When I my dear deceive  SCENE VI  Changes to the garden  Enter ROSSETTA musing  Ross  If ever poor creature was in a pitiable condition surely I am The devil take this fellow I cannot get him out of my head and yet I would fain persuade myself I don't care for him well but surely I am not in love let me examine my heart a little I saw him kissing one of the maids the other day I could have boxed his ears for it and have done nothing but find fault and quarrel with the girl ever since Why was I  uneasy at his toying with another woman what was it to me Then I dream of him almost every nightbut that may proceed from his being generally uppermost in my thoughts all dayOh worse and worseWell he is certainly a pretty lad he has something uncom∣mon about him considering his rank and now let me only put the case if he was not a servant would I or would I not prefer him to all the men I ever saw Why to be sure if he was not a servantIn short I'll ask myself no more questions for the farther I examine the less reason I shall have to be satisfied  AIR XX  How bless'd the maid whose bosom  No headstrong passion knows  Her days in joys she passes  Her nights in calm repose  Where e'er her fancy leads her  No pain no fear invades her  But pleasure  Without measure  From ev'ry object flows  SCENE VII  YOUNG MEADOWS and ROSSETTA  Y Meadows  Do you come into the garden Mrs  Rossetta  to put my lilies and roses out of countenance or to save me the trouble of watering my flowers by reviving them The sun seems to have hid himself a lit∣tle to give you an opportunity of supplying his place  Ross  Where could he get that now he never read it in the academy of compliments  Y Meadows  Come don't affect to treat me with contempt I can suffer any thing better than that in short I love you there is no more to be said I am an∣gry with myself for it and strive all I can against it but in spite of myself I love you  AIR XXI  In vain I ev'ry art assay  To pluck the venom'd shaft away  That wrankles in my heart  Deep in the centre fix'd and bound  My efforts but enlarge the wound  And fiercer make the smart  Ross  Really Mr  Thomas  this is very improper lan∣guage it is what I don't understand I can't suffer it and in short I don't like it  Y Meadows  Perhaps you don't like me  Ross  Well perhaps I don't  Y Meadows  Nay but 'tis not so come confess you love me  Ross  Confess indeed I shall confess no such thing besides to what purpose should I confess it  Y Meadows  Why as you say I don't know to what purpose only it would be a satisfaction to me to hear you say so that's all  Ross  Why if I did love you I can assure you you wou'd never be the better for itWomen are apt enough to be weak we cannot always an∣swer for our inclinations but it is in our power not to give way to them and if I was so silly I say if I  was so indiscreet which I hope I am not as to enter∣tain an improper regard when people's circumstances are quite unsuitable and there are obstacles in the way that cannot be surmounted  Y Meadows  Oh to be sure Mrs  Rossetta  to be sure you are entirely in the right of itIknow very well you and I can never come together  Ross  Well then since that is the case as I assure you it is I think we had better behave accordingly  Y Meadows  Suppose we make a bargain then never to speak to one another any more  Ross  With all my heart  Y Meadows  Nor look at nor if possible think of one another  Ross  I am very willing  Y Meadows  And as long as we stay in the house together after this day never to take any notice  Ross  It is the best way  Y Mead  Why I believe it isWell Mrs  Rossetta  AIR XXII  Ross  Be goneI agree  From this moment we're free  Already the matter I've sworn  Y Mead  Yet let me complain  Of the sates that ordain  A tryal so hard to be born  Ross  When things are but fit  We should calmly submit  No cure in reluctance we find  Y Mead  Then thus I obey  Tear your image away  And banish you quite from my mind  Ross  Well now I think I am somewhat easier I am glad I have come to this explanation with him be∣cause it puts an end to things at once  Y Meadows  Hold Mrs  Rossetta  pray stay a mo∣mentthe airs this girl gives herself are intolerable I find now the cause of her behaviour she despises the meanness of my condition thinking a gardener below the notice of a lady's waiting woman Sdeath I have a good mind to discover myself to her  Ross  He seems in a brown study poor wretch I believe he is heartily mortified but I must not pity him  Y Meadows  It shall be so I will discover myself to her and leave the house directlyMrs  Rossetta  starting back  Pox on it yonder's the justice come into the garden  Ross  Oh lord he will walk round this way pray go about your business I would not for the world he shou'd see us together  Y Meadows  The devil take him he's gone across the parterre and can't hobble here this halfhour I must and will have a little conversation with you  Ross  Some other time  Y Meadows  This evening in the greenhouse at the lower end of the canal I have some thing to communi∣cate to you of importance Will you meet me there  Ross  Meet you  Y Meadows  Ay I have a secret to tell you and I swear from that moment there shall be an end of every thing betwixt us  Ross  Well well pray leave me now  Y Meadows  You'll come then  Ross  I don't know perhaps I may  Y Meadows  Nay but promise  Ross  What signifies promising I may break my pro∣misebut I tell you I will  Y Meadows  EnoughYet before I leave you let me desire you to believe I love you more than ever man loved woman and that when I relinquish you I give up all that can make my life supportable  AIR XXIII  Oh how shall I in language weak  My ardent passion tell  Or form my falt'ring tongue to speak  That cruel word farewell  Farewellbut know tho' thus we part  My thoughts can never stray  Go where I will my constant heart  Must with my charmer stay  SCENE VIII  ROSSETTA Justice WOODCOCK  Ross  What can this be that he wants to tell me I have a strange curiosity to hear it me thinkswell  J Woodcock  Hem hem  Rossetta    Ross  So I thought the devil would throw him in my way now for a courtship of a different kind but I'll give him a surfeitdid you call me Sir  J Woodcock  Ay where are you running so fast  Ross  I was only going into the house Sir  J Woodcock  Well but come here come here I say  looking about  how do you do  Rossetta    Ross  Thank you Sir pretty well  J Woodcock  Why you look as fresh and bloomy to dayAdad you little slut I believe you are painted  Ross  Oh Sir you are pleased to compliment  J Woodcock  Adad I believe you arelet me try  Ross  Lord Sir  J Woodcock  What brings you into this garden so often  Rossetta  I hope you don't get eating green fruit and trash or have you a hankering after some lover in dowlas who spoils my trees by engraving truelovers knots on them with your horn and buckhandled knives I see your name written upon the cieling of the servants hall with the smoak of a candle and I suspect  Ross  Not me I hope SirNo Sir I am of ano∣ther guess mind I assure you for I have heard say men are so false and fickle  J Woodcock  Ay that's your flanting idle young fel∣lows so they are and they are so damm'd impudent I wonder a woman will have any thing to say to them besides all that they want is something to brag of and tell again  Ross  Why I own Sir if ever I was to make a slip it should be with an elderly gentlemanabout seventy or seventyfive years of age  J Woodcock  No child that's out of reason tho' I have known many a man turned of threescore with a hale constitution  Ross  Then sir he should be troubled with the gout have a good strong substantial winter coughand I should not like him the worseif he had a small of the rheumatism  J Woodcock  Pho pho  Rossetta  this is jesting  Ross  No sir every body has their taste and I have mine  J Woodcock  Well but  Rossetta  have you thought of what I was saying to you  Ross  What was it sir  J Woodcock  Ah you know you know well enough hussey  Ross  Dear sir consider my soul would you have me endanger my soul  J Woodcock  No noRepent  Ross  Besides sir consider what has a poor servant to depend on but her character And I have heard you gentlemen will talk one thing before and another after  J Woodcock  I tell you again these are the idle flashy young dogs but when you have to do with a staid sober man  Ross  And a magistrate sir  J Woodcock  Right it's quite a different thingWell shall we  Rosseta  shall we  Ross  Really sir I don't know what to say to it  AIR XXIV  Young I am and sore afraid  Wou'd you hurt a harmless maid  Lead an innocent astray  Tempt me not kind sir I pray  Men too often we believe  And shou'd you my faith deceive  Ruin first and then forsake  Sure my tender heart would break  J Woodcock  Why you silly girl I won't do you any harm  Ross  Won't you sir  J Woodcock  Not I  Ross  But won't you indeed sir  J Woodcock  Why I tell you I won't  Ross  Ha ha ha  J Woodcock  Hussey hussey  Ross  Ha ha haYour servant sir your servant  J Woodcock  Why you impudent audacious  SCENE IX  Justice WOODCOCK HAWTHORN  Hawth  So so justice at odds with gravity his worship playing a game at rompsYour servant sir  J Woodcock  Hah friend  Hawthorn  Hawth  I hope I don't spoil sport neighbour I thought I had the glympse of a petticoat as I came in here  J Woodcock  Oh the maid Ay she has been ga∣thering a salladBut come hither master  Hawthorn  and I'll shew you some alterations I intend to make in my garden how do you like my haha have not I brought the country finely in  Hawth  Pho pho I am no judge of itbesides I want to talk to you a little more about thisTell me sir justice were you helping your maid to gather a sallad here or consulting her taste in your improve∣ments ehHa ha haLet me see all among the roses egad I like your notion but you look a little blank upon it you are ashamed of the business then are you  AIR XXV  Oons neighbour ne'er blush for a trifle like this  What harm with a fair one to toy and to kiss  The greatest and gravesta truce with grimace  Would do the same thing were they in the same place  No age no profession no station is free  To sovereign beauty mankind bend the knee  That power resistless no strength can oppose  We all love a pretty girlunder the rose  J Woodcock  I profess master  Hawthorn  this is all Indian all Cherokee language to me I don't under∣stand a word of it  Hawth  No may be not well sir will you read this letter and try whether you can understand that it is just brought by a servant who stays for an answer  J Woodcock  A letter and to me  taking the letter  Yes it is to me and yet I am sure it comes from no correspondent Where are my spectacles not but I can see very well without them master  Hawthorn  but this seems to be a sort of a crabbed hand  reads the letter  SIR  I am ashamed of giving you this trouble partly but I am informed there is an unthinking boy a son of mine now disguised and in your service in the capacity of a gardener  Tom  is a little wild but an honest lad and no fool either tho' I am his father that say it  Tomoh this is  Thomas  our gardener I always thought that he was a better man's child than he appeared to be though I never mentioned it  Hawth  Well well sir pray let's hear the rest of the letter  J Woodcock  Stay where is the place  I am come in quest of my runaway and write this at an inn in your village while I am swallowing a morsel of dinner because not having the pleasure of your acquaintance I did not care to intrude without giving you notice  whoever this person is he understands good manners  I beg leave to wait on you sir but desire you would keep my arrival a secret particularly from the young man  WILLIAM MEADOWS  I'll assure you a very well worded civil letter Do you know any thing of the person who writes it neigh∣bour  Hawth  Let me consider  Meadows  By dad I be∣lieve it is sir  William Meadows  of  Northamptonshire  and now I remember I heard some time ago that the heir of that family had absconded on account of a marriage that was disagreeable to him It is a good many years since I have seen sir William but we were once well acquainted and if you please sir I will go and conduct him up to the house  J Woodcock  Do so master  Hawthorn  do soBut pray what sort of a man is this sir  William Mea∣dows  is he a wise man  Hawth  There is no occasion for a man that has five thousand pounds a year to be a conjurer but I suppose you ask that question because of this story about his son taking it for granted that wise parents make wise chil∣dren  J Woodcock  No doubt of it master  Hawthorn  no doubt of itI warrant we shall find now that this young rascal has fallen in love with some minx against his father's consentWhy sir if I had as many children as king Priam had that we read of at school in the destruction of Troy not one of them would serve me so  Hawth  Well well neighbour perhaps not but we should remember when we were young ourselves and I was as likely to play an old don such a trick in my day as e'er a spark in the hundred nay between you and me I had done it once had the wench been as willing as I  AIR XXVI  My  Dolly  was the fairest thing  Her breath disclos'd the sweets of spring  And if for summer you wou'd seek  'Twas painted in her eye her cheek  Her swelling bosom tempting ripe  Of fruitful autumn was the type  But when my tender tale I told  I found her heart was winter cold  J Woodcock  Ah you were always a scapegrace rattlecap  Hawth  Odds heart neighbour  Woodcock  don't tell me young fellows will be young fellows though we preach 'till we're hoarse again and so there's an end on't  SCENE X  Changes to justice Woodcock's hall  Enter LUCINDA followed by HODGE  Hodge  Mercy on usI wish I may be hanged if I had not like to drop down with the fright when I saw the gentleman in the parlour with my master I thought all the fat was in the fire and I should have lost my place that's for certain  Lucin  Well but  Hodge  things have fallen out more luckily and my papa is very well reconciled to the gentleman but does not suspect who he is so take care you don't blab it  Hodge  Blab it did I ever  Lucin  I don't accuse youAnd as I have often put confidence in you before I am now going to give you a fresh instance of my dependance on your fidelityI have just come to a resolution to leave the house with Mr  Eustace  this night  Hodge  What and his worship

Lucin  I dare swear I shall return soon again  Hodge  When my father finds that we are married and what's done cannot be undone you know  Hodge  Nay ecod you'll be of the sure side of the hedge then but have you any thing for me to do  Lucin  That you shall be told if you come into my chamber after dinner Mr  Eustace  will be thereAnd in the mean time as a reward for the services you have done us already there's somewhat  gives money  Hodge  Five guineasMayhap you think it's for the value of this nowWhy I'd go through fire and water for you by day or by night without ever a pennyBut if his worship should come to know that I have meddled or made  Lucin  Depend upon it  Hodge  I will insure you from all damagesBut where shall I find  Rossetta  to tell her of thisWell I am going to do a strange bold thing but I hope we shall be happy  AIR XXVII  Oh Hymen propitious receive in thy train  A pair unseduc'd by the selfish and vain  Whom neither ambition nor int'rest draws  But love

stronger as passion decays  SCENE XI  HODGE MARGERY  Hodge  So mistress who let you in  Marg  Why I let myself in  Hodge  Indeed Marry come up why then pray let yourself out again Times are come to a

You will  Marg  Yes that's what I will his worship shall be acquainted with all your pranks and see how you will like to be sent for a soldier  Hodge  There's the door take a friend's advice and go

Hodge  Here towzer  whistling  whu whu whu  AIR XXVIII  Was ever poor fellow so plaug'd with a vixen  Zawns Madge don't provoke me but mind what I say  You've chose a wrong parson for playing your tricks on  So pack up your alls and be trudging away  You'd better be quiet  And not breed a riot  S'blood must I stand prating with you here all day  I've got other matters to mind  May hap you may think me an ass  But to the contrary you'll find  A fine piece of a work by the mass  SCENE XII  ROSSETTA HODGE MARGERY  Ross  Sure I heard the voice of discord hereas I live an admirer of mine and if I mistake not a rivalI'll have some sport with themhow now fellow servant what's the matter  Hodge  Nothing Mrs  Rossetta  only this young woman wants to speak with his worship  Madge  follow me  Marg  No  Hodge  this is your fine madam but I am as good flesh and blood as she and have as clean a skin too tho'f I mayn't go so gay and now she's here I'll tell her a piece of my mind  Hodge  Hold your tongue will you  Marg  No I'll speak if I dye for it  Ross  What is the matter I say  Hodge  Why nothing I tell you  Madge    Marg  Yes but it is something it's all along of she and she may be ashamed of herself  Ross  Bless me child do you direct your discourse to me  Marg  Yes I do and to nobody else there was not a kinder soul breathing than he was 'till of late I had never a cross word from him till he kept you company but all the girls about say there's no such thing as keep∣ing a sweetheart for you  Ross  Do you hear this friend  Hodge  Hodge  Why you don't mind she I hope but if that vexes her I do like you I do my mind runs upon nothing else and if so be as you was agreeable to it I would marry you to night before to morrow  Marg  Oh you base rogue you deceitful fellow you are parjur'd you know you are and you deserve to have your eyes tore out  Hodge  Let me come at herI'll teach you to call names and abuse folk  Marg  Do strike me you a man  Ross  Hold holdwe shall have a battle here pre∣sently and I may chance to get my cap tore offNever exasperate a jealous woman 'tis taking a mad bull by the hornsLeave me to manage her  Hodge  You manage her I'll kick her  Ross  No

I am ready to burst I can't stay in the place any longer  Ross  Hold child come hither  Marg  Don't speak to me don't you  Ross  Well but I have something to say to you of consequence and that will be for your good I suppose this fellow promised you marriage  Marg  Ay or he should never have prevail'd upon me  Ross  Well now you see the ill consequence of trust∣ing to such promises when once a man hath cheated a  of her virtue she has no longer hold of him he despises her for wanting that which he hath robb'd her of and like a lawless conqueror triumphs in the ruin he hath occasioned  Marg  Nan  Ross  However I hope the experience you have got though somewhat dearly purchased will be of use to you for the future and as to any designs I have upon the heart of your lover you may make yourself easy for I assure you I shall be no dangerous rival so go your ways and be a good girl  Marg  YesI don't very well understand her talk but I suppose that's as much as to say she'll keep him herself well let her who cares I don't fear getting better nor he is any day of the year for the matter of that and I have a thought come into my head that may be will be more to my advantage  AIR XXX  Since Hodge proves ungrateful no farther I'll seek  But go up to town in the waggon next week  A service in London is no such disgrace  And register's office will get me a place  Bet Blossom went there and soon met with a friend  Folks say in her silks she's now standing an end  Then why should not I the same maxim pursue  And better my fortune as other girls do  SCENE XIV  Enter ROSSETTA and LUCINDA  Ross  Ha ha ha Oh admirable most delectibly rediculous And so your father is content he should be a music master and will have him such in spite of all your aunt can say to the contrary  Lucin  My father and he child are the best com∣panions you ever saw they have been singing together the most hideous duets bobbing joan and old sir simon the king heaven knows where  Eustace  could pick them up but he has gone through half the contents of pills to purge melancholy with him  Ross  And have you resolved to take wing tonight  Lucin  This very night my dear my swain will go from hence this evening but no farther than the inn where he has left his horses and at twelve precisely he will be with a postchaise at the little gate that opens from the lawn into the road where I have promised to meet him  Ross  Then depend upon it I'll bear you company  Lucin  We shall easily slip out when the family is a sleep and I have prepared  Hodge  already  Ross  Nay for that matter you need not have a more expert pilot than myself upon such an expedition but hark you  SCENE XV  ROSSETTA LUCINDA HAWTHORN  Hawth  Lucy  where are you  Lucin  Your pleasure Sir  Ross  Mr  Hawthorn  your servant  Hawth  What my little water wagtail the very cou∣ple I wished to meet come hither both of you  Ross  Now Sir what would you say to both of us  Hawth  Why let me look at you a littlehave you got on your best gowns and your best faces If not go and trick yourselves out directly for I'll tell you a secretthere will be a young batchelor in the house within these three hours that may fall to the share of one of you if you look sharpbut whether mistress or maid  Ross  Ay marry this is something but how do you know whether either mistress or maid will think him worth acceptance  Hawth  Follow me follow me I

William MEADOWS followed by HAW∣THORN  Sir Will  WELL this is excellent this is mighty good this is mighty merry faith ha ha ha was ever the like heard of that my boy  Tom  should run away from me for fear of being forced to marry a girl he never saw that she should scamper from her father for fear of being forced to marry him and that they should run into one another's arms this way in disguise by mere aocident against their con∣sents and without knowing it as a body may say may I never do an ill turn master  Hawthorn  if it is not one of the oddest adventures partly  Hawth  Why Sir  William  it is romance a novel a pleasanter history by half than the loves of  Dorastus  and  Faunia  we shall have ballads made of it within these two months setting forth how a young 'squire became a serving man of low degree and it will be stuck up with  Margret's  ghost and the Spanish lady against the walls of every cottage in the country  Sir Will  But what pleases me best of all master  Hawthorn  is the ingenuity of the girl May I never do an ill turn when I was called out of the room and the servant said she wanted to speak to me if I knew what  to make on't but when the little gypsey took me aside and told me her name and how matters stood I was quite astonish'd as a body may say and could not believe it partly till her young friend that she is with here assu∣red me of the truth on't Indeed at last I began to recol∣lect her face though I have not set eyes on her before since she was the height of a full grown greyhound  Hawth  Well Sir  William  your son as yet knows no∣thing of what has happen'd nor of your being come hi∣ther and if you'll follow my council we'll have some sport with himHe and his mistress were to meet in the garden this evening by appointment she's gone to dress herself in all her airs will you let me direct your proceedings in this affair  Sir Will  With all my heart master  Hawthorn  with all my heart do what you will with me say what you please for me I am so overjoy'd and so happyAnd may I never do an ill turn but I am very glad to see you too ay and partly as much pleased at that as any thing else for we have been merry together before now when we were some years younger Well and how has the world gone with you master  Hawthorn  since we saw one another last  Hawth  Why pretty well Sir  William  I have no reason to complain every one has a mixture of four with his sweets but in the main I believe I have done in a degree as tollerably as my neighbours  AIR XXXII  The world is a well furnish'd table  Where guests are promisc'ously set  We all fare as well as we're able  And scramble for what we can get  My simile bolds to a tittle  Some gorge while some scarce have a taste  But if I am content with a little  Enough is as good as a feast  SCENE II  Sir WILLIAM MEADOWS HAWTHORN ROSSETTA  Ross  Sir  William  I beg pardon for detaining you but I have had so much difficulty in adjusting my bor∣rowed plumes  Sir Will  May I never do an ill turn but they fit you to a T and you look very well so you do cockbones how your father will chuckle when he comes to hear thisHer father master  Hawthorn  is as worthy a man as lives by bread and has been almost out of his senses for the loss of herBut tell me hussey has not this been all a scheme a piece of conjuration between you and my son faith I am half persuaded it has it looks so like hocus pocus as a body may say  Ross  Upon my honour Sir  William  what has happen∣ed has been the mere effect of chance I came hither unknown to your son and he unknown to me I ne∣ver in the least suspected that  Thomas  the gardener was other than his appearance spoke him and least of all that he was a person with whom I had so close a connec∣tion  Mr  Hawthorn  can testify the astonishment I was in when he first informed me of it but I thought it was my duty to come to an immediate explanation with you  Sir Will  Is not she a neat wench master  Hawthorn  May I never do an ill turn but she isBut you little plaguy devil how came this love affair between you  Ross  I have told you the whole truth very ingenuously Sir since your son and I have been fellow servants as I may call it in this house I have had more than reason to suspect he had taken a liking to me and I will own with equal frankness had I not look'd upon him as a person so much below me I should have had no objec∣tion to receiving his courtship  Hawth  Well said by the lord Harry all above board fair and open  Ross  Perhaps I may be censured by some for this can∣did declaration but I love to speak my sentiments and I assure you Sir  William  in my own opinion I should prefer a gardener with your son's good qualities to a knight of the shire without them  AIR XXXIII  'Tis not wealth it is not birth  Can value to the soul convey  Minds possess superior worth  Which chance nor gives nor takes away  Like the sun true merit shows  By nature warm by nature bright  With inbred flames he nobly glows  Nor needs the aid of borrow'd light  Hawth  Well but Sir we lose timeis not this about the hour you appointed to meet in the garden  Ross  Pretty near it  Hawth  Oons then what do we stay for come my old friend come along and by the way we will consult how to manage your interview  Sir Will  Ay but I must speak a word or two to my man about the horses first  SCENE III  ROSSETTA HODGE  Ross

thing amiss that you came in so abrutly  Hodge  Amiss why there's ruination  Ross  How where  Hodge  Why with miss  Lucinda  her aunt has catch'd she and the gentleman above stairs and overheard all their love discourse  Ross  You don't say so  Hodge  Ecod I had like to have pop'd in among them this instant but by good luck I heard Mrs  Debo∣rah  's voice and ran down again as fast as ever my legs could carry me  Ross  Is your master in the house  Hodge  What his worship no no he is gone into the fields to talk with the reapers and people  Ross  Poor  Lucinda  I wish I could go up to her but I am so engaged with my own affairs  Hodge  Mrs  Rossetta  Ross  Well  Hodge  Odds bobs I must have one smack of your sweet lips  Ross  Oh stand off you know I never allow liberties  Hodge  Nay

moment by your leave yet as our sufferings have been mutual so shall our joys I already lose the remembrance of all former pains and anxieties  AIR XXXIV  The traveller benighted  And led thro' weary ways  The lamp of day new lighted  With joy the dawn surveys  The rising prospects viewing  Each look is forward cast  He smiles his course pursuing  Nor thinks of what is past  SCENE IV  HODGE Mrs

coming here ecod I'll get out of the wayMurrain take it this door is bolted nowSo so  Mrs Deb  Get along get along  driving in Lucinda before her  you are a scandal to the name of  Woodcock  but I was resolved to find you out for I have suspect∣ed you a great while though your father silly man will have you such a poor innocent  Lucin  What shall I do  Mrs Deb  I was determined to discover what you and your pretended music matter were about and lay in wait on purpose I believe he thought to escape me by slipping into the closet when I knocked at the door but I was even with him for now I have him under lock and key and please the fates there he shall remain till your father comes in I will convince him of his error whether he will or not  Lucin  You won't be so cruel I am sure you won't I thought I had made you my friend by telling you the truth  Mrs Del  Telling me the truth quotha did I not over∣hear your scheme of running away to night through the partition did not I find the very bundles packed up in the room with you ready for going off No brazen∣face I found out the truth by my own sagacity though  your father says I am a fool but now we'll be judged who is the greatestAnd

hold your tongue  Lucin  I own aunt I have been very faulty in this affair I don't pretend to excuse myself but we are all subject to frailties consider that and judge of me by yourself who were once young and inexperienced as I am  AIR XXXV  If ever a fond inclination  Rose in your bosom to rob you of rest  Reflect with a little compassion  On the soft pangs which prevail'd in my breast  Oh where where would you fly me  Can you deny me thus torn and distrest  Think when my lover was by me  Would I how cou'd I refuse his request  Kneeling before you let me implore you  Look on me sighing crying dying  Ah is there no language can move  If I have been too complying  Hard was the conflict 'twixt duty and love  Mrs Deb  This is mighty pretty romantick stuff but you learn it out of your play books and novels Girls in my time had other employments we work'd at our needles and kept ourselves from idle thoughts before I was your age I had finished with my own fingers a compleat set of chairs and a fire screen in tent stitch four counterpanes in Marsailles quilting and the creed and the ten commandments in the hair of our family it was framed and glazed and hung over the parlour chimney piece and your grandfather was prouder of it than of e'er a picture in his house I never looked into a book but when I said my prayers except it was the compleat housewife or the great family receipt book whereas you are always at your studies Ah I never knew a woman come to good that was fond of reading  Lucin  Well pray madam let me prevail on you to give me the key to let Mr  Eustace  out and I promise I never will proceed a step farther in this business with∣out your advice and approbation  Mrs Deb  Have not I told you already my resolutionWhere are my clogs and my bonnet I'll go out to my brother in the fields I'm a fool you know child now let's see what the wits will think of themselvesDon't hold me  Lucin  I'm not goingI have thought of a way to be even with you so you may do as you please  SCENE V  HODGE  Well I thought it would come to this I'll be shot if I didn'tSo here's a fine jobbBut what can they do to meThey can't send me to jail for carrying a letter seeing there was no treason in it and how was I obligated to know my master did not allow of their meetingsThe worst they can do is to turn me off and I am sure the place is no such great pur∣chaseindeed I shall be sorry to leave Mrs  Rossetta  seeing as how matters are so near being brought to an end betwixt us but she and I may keep company all as one and I finds  Madge  has been speaking with gaffer Broadwheels the waggoner about her carriage up to London so that I have got rid of she and I am sure I have reason to be main glad of it for she led me a wearysome lifeBut that's the way of them all  AIR XXXVI  A plague of those wenches they make such a pother  When once they have let'n a man have his will  They're always a whining for something or other  And cry he's unkind in his carriage  What tho'f he speaks them ne'er so fairly  Still they keep teazing teazing on  You cannot persuade 'em  'Till promise you've made 'em  And after they've got it  They tell youadd rot it  Their character's blasted they're ruin'd undone  And then to be sure sir  There is but one cure sir  And all the discourse is of marriage  SCENE VI  Changes to a Greenhouse  Enter Young MEADOWS  Y Meadows  I am glad I had the precaution to bring this suit of cloaths in my bundle though I hardly know myself in them again they appear so strange and feel so unwieldy However my gardener's jacket goes on no moreI wonder this girl does not come  looking at his watch  perhaps she won't comeWhy then I'll go into the village take a post chaise and depart with∣out any farther ceremony  AIR XXXVII  How much superior beauty awes  The coldest bosoms find  But with resistless force it draws  To sense and sweetness join'd  The casket where to outward show  The workman's art is seen  Is doubly valu'd when we know  It holds a gem

own I have been in a fault  Sir Will  In a fault to run away from me because I was going to do you goodMay I never do an ill turn master  Hawthorn  if I did not pick out as fine a girl for him partly as any in England and the rascal run away from me and came here and turn'd gardenerAnd pray what did you propose to yourself  Tom  I know you were always fond of Bottany as they call it did you intend to keep the trade going and advertise fruittrees and floweringshrubs to be had at  Meadows  's nursery  Hawth  No sir William I apprehend the young gentleman designed to lay by the profession for he has quitted the habit already  Y Meadows  I am so astonished to see you here sir that I don't know what to say but I assure you if you had not come I should have returned home to you directly Pray sir

not disposed  Hawth  Nay but young gentleman fair and softly you should pay some respect to your father in this matter  Sir Will  Respect master  Hawthorn  may I never do an ill turn but he shall marry her or I'll disinherit him there's once Look you  Tom  not to make any more words of the matter I have brought the lady here with me and I'll see you contracted before we part or you shall delve

choice shall be his and he shall consent to marry you before he sees you or not an acre of estatePray sir walk this way  Y Meadows  Sir I cannot help thinking your con∣duct a little extraordinary but since you urge me so closely I must tell you my affections are engaged  Sir Will  How  Tom  how  Y Meadows  I was determined sir to have got the better of my inclination and never have done a thing which I knew would be disagreeable to you  Sir Will  And pray sir who are your affections en∣gaged to let me know that  Y Meadows  To a person sir whose rank and for∣tune may be no recommendations to

his inclination  Y Meadows  You need not have taken this method sir to let me see you were acquainted with my folly whatever my inclinations are  Sir Will  Well but  Tom  suppose I give my consent to your marrying this young woman  Y Meadows  Your consent sir  Ross  Come sir  William  we have carried the jest far enough I see your son is in a kind of embarrassment and I don't wonder at it but this letter which I re∣ceived from him a few days before I left my father's house will I apprehend expound the riddleHe cannot be surprized that I ran away from a gentleman who expressed so much dislike to me and what has happened since chance brought us together in masque∣rade there is no occasion for me to inform him of  Y Meadows  What is all this pray don't make a jest of me  Sir Will  May I never do an ill turn  Tom  if it is not truth this is my friend's daughter  Y Meadows  Sir  Ross  Even so 'tis very true indeed In short you have not been a more whimsical gentleman than I have a gentlewoman but you see we were designed for one another 'tis plain  Y Meadows  I know not madam what I either hear or see a thousand things are crowding on my imagina∣tion while like one just wakened from a dream I doubt which is reality which delusion  Sir Will  Well then  Tom  come into the air a bit and recover yourself  Y Meadows  Nay dear sir have a little patience do yon give her to me  Sir

every thingI must intreat the good offices of Sir  William  and Mr  Hawthorn  immediately for I am in the utmost uneasiness about my poor friend  Lucinda  Hawth  Why what's the matter  Ross  I don't

thought so  Sir Will  What is there a lover in the case may I never do an ill turn but I am glad so I am for we'll make a double wedding and by way of celebrating it take a trip to  London  to shew
