 THE TOWN BEFORE YOU A COMEDY AS ACTED AT THE THEATREROYAL COVENTGARDEN  BY MRS COWLEY  LONDON PRINTED BY G WOODFALL FOR T N LONGMAN PATERNOSTERROW    TO MRS FRUSHARD CALCUTTA  MADAM  I SELDOM write Dedications Whenever I have written one it has been from an impulse of veneration or of tender gratitude THE BELLE's STRATAGEM I dedicated to  her Majesty  THE TOWN BEFORE YOU is dedicated to  you    The virtues which you practise in your elegant pavilions at GASSARY have  reach'd the British shores Their reputation now echoes back again to those of the Ganges and I would persuade myself that I may be the cause of extending it still farther Yes I would hope that this humble pen may speak to those of after times and tell them that you  quietly  perform such acts of graceful goodness as open a thousand mouths in your praise whilst you persuade yourself that all is secret and that no one finds you out to be more amiable and respected than the generality of human creatures  This self deception is a little help'd on by him to whom of all earthly beings you are bound to look up He  aids  your charming impositionshe  assists  you in fixing fetters of gratitude on all around you and then persuades himself and you that Heaven alone is privy to the deed But you could not hope always to go on  in this sort of concealmentat length you are unveil'd  I am unable to measure the extent of my private obligations to you but may this public acknowledgement of them convince you that they throb in my heart and that I must be  Ever MADAM Your faithfully devoted H COWLEY  PREFACE  THE following is rather the Comedy which the Public have chosen it to be than the Comedy which I intended Some things have been left out and some have been added since the first representation In short the Comedy has been  new class'd  it has been torn from its genus  It is hoped however that there may be found characters in THE TOWN BEFORE YOU to interest and situations to attach and that those events which were vivacity in the Theatre will not be dulness in the closet  But it must be noticed that the scene in the second act between TIPPY and his Landlady and that in the fifth act between TIPPY and the Bailiff were no part of my original design They were written during the illness of MRS POPE after the Piece had been played several nights Alas I am sorry to remark that no scenes in the Comedy to use the Stage idiom  go off  better  An acute Critic lately said in one of those assemblies where conversation though sometimes light is seldom without meaning "A Comedy to please in the present day must be  made  not written" It requires no great expanse of comprehension to perceive the meaning of this dogma the truth of which I am equally ready to acknowledge and to deplore But should it  want  illustration it may be found every week in a popular Piece where a great Actor holding a sword in his left hand and making aukward pushes with it charms the audience infinitely more than he could do by all the wit and observation which the ingenious Author might have given him and brings down such applauses as the bewitching dialogue of CIBBER and of FARQUHAR pants for in vain  The patient developement of character the repeated touches which colour it up to Nature and swell it into identity and existence and which gave celebrity to CONGREVE we have now no relish for The combinations of interest the strokes which are meant to reach the heart we are equally incapable of tasting LAUGH LAUGH LAUGH is the demand Not a word must be uttered that looks like instruction or a sentence which ought to be remembered  From a Stage in such a state it is time to withdraw but I call on my younger cotemporaries I invoke the rising generation to  correct  a taste which to be gratified demands neither genius or intellect which asks only a happy knack at inventing TRICK I adjure them to restore to the Drama SENSE OBSERVATION  WIT LESSON and to teach our Writers to respect their own talents  What mother can now lead her daughters to the great National School THE THEATRE in the confidence of their receiving either polish or improvement Should the luckless Bard stumble on a reflection or a sentiment the audience yawn and wait for the next tumble from a chair or a tripping up of the heels to put them into attention Surely I shall be forgiven for satirising myself I have  made  such things and I blush to have made them  O GENIUS of a polish'd age descendplant thy banners in our Theatres and bid ELEGANCE and FEELING take place of the  droll  and the  laugh  which formerly were found only in the Booths of  Bartlemy  Fair and were divided between  Flocton  and  Yates  With actors capable of giving force to all that is intellectual is it not  pity  to condemn them to such drudgery THEY are no longer necessary Let Sadler's Wells and the Circus empty themselves of their performers to furnish our Stage the expence to Managers will be less and their business will be carried on better The UNDERSTANDING DISCERNMENT and EDUCATION which distinguish our modern actors are useless to themstrong muscles are in greater repute and grimace has more powerful attraction  PROLOGUE  MRS MATTOCKS  AH ah you're here and comfortably tight  Well squeez'd and press'd I seefrom left to right  Waiting the moment when the curtain rises  Gasping for plots adventures and surprises  Were I a Poeta Dramatic Wit  And by the Stage Tarantula were bit  My Prologue shou'd as was the good old way  A word or two upon  the subject say    Hint a loose outline of the scene within  And let you guess the whole ere we begin  In present times the Prologue and its Play  Are as near kin as Michaelmas and May  Confin'd then not to say a word of  that    I'll tell a storyand I have one pat  A Boniface of late placed near his door  "Good larders here of genuine wines rich store"  In gold the gaudy invitation hung  And to the shifting Zephyrs gently swung  It chanc'd a traveller with stomach keen  Leapt from his Rozinante tir'd and lean  'Talk'd of his supper with an eager air  Resolved for once in no expence to spare  I'll have stewed carp he cried and chicken roast  And bring me of the Burgundy you boast  Yes Sir the staring curtfying Damsel said  And in a trice the tablecloth was laid  I am my own man he adds in accents bold  Nor shall I fear tonight my household scold  One hundred miles betwixt me and my dear  Odds bobs her shrill alarum can't reach here  At length came back the pretty simpering Kate  And plac'dtwo eggs upon his lonely plate  Our Traveller amazed the Landlord call'd  Host Host in angry accents loudly bawl'd  He cameWhere are your ducks your lobsters turkey hare  "Why there you have them  in the Bill of Fare    "There you have game and fowl and fish well drest  "And neat old Port to give the whole a zest  "My house affords no other Sir believe me  "I scorns I'm sure to go for to deceive ye"  The guest fatigued enraged the Inn forsook  And the road slowly to another took  There  without  promise all was neat and clean  His food was wholesome and his room not mean  Sonot to raise high hopes we cannot meet  We trust this night's  plain  fare is fresh and sweet  And shou'd you like the dressing we invite ye  To come as often as the dish delights ye  A hearty welcome you will always find  And to your wills our Host and House resign'd  PERSONS OF THE DRAMA  TIPPY  Mr Lewis  FANCOURT  Mr Munden  CONWAY  Mr Holman  ASGILL  Mr Pope  SIR ROBERT FLOYER  Mr Quick  SIR SIMON ASGILL  Mr Powell  HUMPHREY  Mr Faweett  PERKINS

sits readingMrs  FANCOURT  at work at some distance    FANCOURT  HOW well those fellows wrote those antients How finely they satirize the rich and what respect they have for virtue in rags My dear I will translate the passageoff hand now d'ye hear off hand  rises and reads  Poliarchus the rich Athenian wantoning in gluttony looks with contempt on the poor Cassander Cassander reposing on his bed of straw thanks the Gods that he has health and virtue and prays to be preserved from the misfortune of being rich like Poliarchus whose floors are stained with the wine of drunkenness and whose silver couch is constantly crowded by physicians  Mrs Fancourt  Are you sure that is a just translation Mr Fancourt  Mr Fancourt  What Madam do you doubt my knowledge of Greek Some people can hardly read English at sight I can translate at sight thanks to the milk I suck'd in at Oxford Doctor Johnson and I were both Oxford men I like to read that old Quiz he was so fond of us Oxford fellows But he had too much respect for richeshe liked rich people  Mrs Fancourt  To say truth I have a little of his way of thinking I had never much respect towards those Philosophers who are always throwing sarcasms on the rich  Fancourt  interrupting  I do maintain Madam that the rich are  the  vilest  Mrs Fancourt  Come come Mr Fancourt your extravagancies have rendered you poor and therefore you are always raving thus and pouring your philipics on people of fortuneas though vice and folly could only be found in palaces and virtue in garrets  Fancourt  Hey day Why Ma'amwhy  Mrs Fancourt  For my part I believe there is as much goodness amongst persons of fortune as amongst the poorand I do not see why the power of dressing elegantly and living in well educated society should debase the heart or weaken the understanding  Fancourt  You  do not see why you are the greatestthe most abominableupon my soul you are the most provoking fool that ever  Mrs Fancourt  My dear Sir I do not doubt ityou have repeated these opinions too often for me not to be convinced of their justice But really now between ourselves  rising and laying down her work  as opinion is nothing  without example I will take the liberty to quote yourself in support of mine  Fancourt  Me quote me  Mrs Fancourt  Even your great and mighty self Mr Fancourt when I married you you were not poornot so poor as you are now and I think at that time you had no particular vices but as dissipation has brought poverty upon you I have observed that by little and little your shallow virtues have disappeared till  Fancourt  impatiently  'Till what  Mrs Fancourt  Till you are capable of almost any action that will not endanger your neck Nay I no longer mind your threatening looksI am so convinced of what I have said that my heart feels horror  Fancourt  I'll make it feel something else  Mrs Fancourt  You cannot All  other  power over my heart is over you can afflict it no more But observe my deduction I state you to yourself as a proof that poverty is  sometimes  the source of wickedness and that squalid wretchedness is as capable of debasing the heart as affluence and splendor  Fancourt  Very well woman very well still the noise of that child there  going to the door  what an odious squaling it keeps  Mrs Fancourt  It is not easy Mr Fancourt to still the noise of children who are hungry Though they are the children of the  first  Mrs Fancourt it pierces my heart to hear them why will you not do something to get bread for them  Fancourt  What would you have me do I was not bred to stand behind a counter nor  to cry "  Chairs to mend  " in the streets You know all thatwhat did you marry me for  Mrs Fancourt  Alas because I loved you The sweetness of your manners disguised the emptiness of your heart and I romantically thought that poverty could never be an evil when two hearts fondly  shared  its difficulties But nowpermit me to ask why you married me  Fancourt  Because you had a modicum of a fortunea score of hundreds and I had not so many shillings  Mrs Fancourt  That little modicum might have been a bank if properly managed and  Fancourt  Pshawstuff I hate such cant What do  you  want  Enter a female Servant  Servant  A person left this parcel Sir and said there was no answer  Exit  Fancourt  Such abominable cant  untying the up parcel  I am as tired of it as I used to be of my Grandmother's spelling through Hannah Glass's Art of Cookery and I believe in my conscience the devil here is gold  Mrs Fancourt  Gold  Fancourt  Keep offyou are too good too pure to want such vile trash Twenty guineas by Jupiterah ah  shaking the purse  Mrs Fancourt  Here is a note dropt  takes it up and reads  Accept this purse Sir from one who is sorry to see such merit in confined circumstances and who was charmed with your delicate manner of revealing it  Fancourt  Who is it signed by  Mrs Fancourt  Robert Floyer  Fancourt  Ay  Sir  Robert Floyer a fine old Welchman who got himself made Sheriff then a Knightthose two dignities generally follow like the Old Bailey and a whipping I made the old blockhead believe that I was deeply versed in Welch antiquitiesthat Snowden was once a burning mountain and that the  Ap Morgans  and  Ap Shoneses  were lineally descended from King Priam You see I know how to turn my wits to accountI can make money though I can't make shoes  Mrs Fancourt  Yes and you see there is generosity where there is no poverty and that but for the beneficence of a man of fortune a  rich  man your children today wou'd have wanted a dinner  Fancourt  Psha what merit is there in the generosity of a rich man a fellow who takes out a handful of guineas from his store as you would dip a bucket into a well give me the virtue of the poor man who divides his last shillinghis last twopence with his friend who takes his pint of porter from his thirsty lips and shares it with his poorer neighbour  Mrs Fancourt  Ah here is your  poor  sister I will go and receive heryou can now assist her distresseswhat pleasure it will give you  Fancourt  None of your documentsif she is in distress let her pawn her superfluities as other poor people do  going out  There is some difference between sharing one's last twopence with a friend and one's last twenty guineas  Exit  Mrs Fancourt goes out on the opposite side with an air of abhorrence  SCENE II  A Square  Enter  HUMPHREY  searching his pockets    Humphrey  Rot et here be three caerds or noates or what the devil they be left after all Dang et I have delivered seventeenall the way from Manchestersquare

 Yes my ladPray which is Sir Robert Floyer's  Humphrey  Which is  bursting into a laugh  What don't you know Sir Robert's Why Sir Robert is as well known in Wales as the Monument in Lunnun or my Lord Mayor in his gilt coach  Buckram  Very likely But which is his house in this street  Humphrey  Why this house to be sure  takes off his hat  Why I live we'en Pray Sir what may be your business we'en  Buckram  I am the young lady's staymaker  Humphrey  Staymaker  puts on his hat  why I took you for a curnel or a coptain or a great knight belonging to a prince or some'at of that sort Why your coate

Apartment within    Enter Sir  ROBERT  followed by a Servant    Sir Robert  looking out  Humphrey Humphrey Where can this loitering rascal stay So you found Mr Fancourt's house  Servant  Yes Sir in one of the retired streets near Bloomsbury  Sir Robert  Well I am glad I sent him those few guineas Fancourt seems to be a lad of merit and when he opened his distresses to me  he did it in such a delicate modest way He is an excellent companion and he has a pretty taste for antiquitiesI like antiquities  Servant  So I guess'd Sir by the vast quantity of old wormeaten furniture you have at home which you never make any use of but to shew to strangers All from the old castles belonging to your forefathers Sir I take it  Sir Robert  Yes all from my forefathers castles Hum  aside  My grandfather was the first man of his family who ever went to bed or got up his own master  Servant  Two or three rooms of precious rotten furniture Sir give people a notion of the antiquity of your family  archly  Sir Robert  aside  I believe the dog has found me outit was for that very reason I bought it You may remember David the year that I was sheriffI say that year in which I was high sheriff for the countyHohere comes Humphrey  Enter  HUMPHREY  Where have you been you loitering westcountry booby these three hours  Humphrey  Three hours Why Sir 'tis my belief you wou'd have loitered six hours if you had seen what I have seen and heard what I have heard  Sir Robert  What hast thou seen and heard  Humphrey  Why in my way to Bishopsgatestreet I saw folks go into that old fashioned house where Gog and and Magog stand up to guard the mincepies whilst the Lord Mayor dines  Sir Robert  Guildhall  Humphrey  Yes Gilthallit is all over gilt and finery So I follow'd a gemman into a great chamber and thereO my eyes there I saw beautiful angels coming down through the clouds on purpose to hold up the glass candlesticks thus  stretching out his arm  Sir Robert  seriously  Gad I shou'd like to see them  Humphrey  And the gemmen were debating YesO my ears I heard a city debate and they called one another Mr Deputyand one of them with a fine red double chin got up and said  I am sorry to differ from Mr Deputy  speaking gruffly  but I contend that these innovations bode no good to our constitutions The hour for dining since my time was two it has been three four and six and I suspect shortly it may be eight hum I move therefore that a petition be presented to the Lord Mayorhum hum  On which a little squinting gentleman rose and said  in a shrill quick voice  I support the worthy Deputy who spoke last These late hours are ruinous to the body corporate On Lord Mayor's Day we dined so late that when I went afterwards to Fishmonger'shall to  supper  the turbots were gone nay the second course was demolished the sweetmeats were pocketed and nothing remained but cheese and pickles  Sir Robert  You are a pickle Get outhere is a great lady comingget out of her way go  Exit Humphrey  Enter Lady  CHARLOTTE  What Madam is your Ladyship going Has not my daughter had the honour to see you Lady Charlotte  Lady Charlotte  Yes and I have left her with a person of much greater consequenceshe is in deep consultation with her milliner To a girl of eighteen Sir Robert a milliner is of as much importance as an aidducamp to a general I knew my distance when she entered and immediately took leavePray Sir order my chair  to the first servant who goes off  Sir Robert  Madam forgive me if before you go I just  plump  one question What do you think of Mr Conway  Lady Charlotte  Ha ha ha Think of Mr Conway That he has all the advantages which belong to fashion without its vices He has certainly some vanity but more good sense His friends are well chosen he admires beauty he loves goodness and there  is  a young lady  archly  Adieu Sir Robert Your anxiety about Mr Conway I perfectly understand and I hope you are satisfied  Exit  Sir Robert  bowing repeatedly  What a thing it is to have a lady of quality so familiar with one  GEORGINA  enters hastily followed by  JENNY  Well Georgina what now What now  Georgina  O papa look at this capdid you ever see so bewitching a thing  Sir Robert  Pho you little fool  Georgina  Look at this bowlook at the tip of this scarlet feather Here Jenny put it away with great care  Jenny  Care  indeed  aside  it is pity my talents have not better employment than taking care of feathers and wiping bandboxes  Exit  Georgina  Good bye papa I am going to Lady Horatia Horton's I do love to go there And what do you think I long to be I long to be a sculptor  Sir Robert  I don't understand ye  Georgina  O Lady Horatia does look so charmingly whilst at her labours her sweet white hands appear like the very marble she is at work upon  Sir Robert  Did I hear right At work upon marble  Georgina  Bless me Why did I never tell you before that she is a sculptor She has a large room full of fine things of her own work O dear I wish she wou'd teach me her art I could spend my life amidst fine statues But pray papa when am I to be presented I am not in town till I am presented  Sir Robert  Not in town  Georgina  Nay indeed its true Lady Charlotte told me so I can't go any where in public nor be spoken to by a single creature till I have been presented I am not come out till then  Sir Robert  Not come out  Bless me Georgina my dear why then Saint James's has its slang as well as Saint Giles's  Georgina  Yes to be sure it has and we must make haste and get the  slang  or they will  find us out to be mere bumpkins When shall I be presented  Sir Robert  Have patience I am come to town about a little business of that sort myself Perhaps we shall be presented together  Georgina  How ha ha ha presented together Was ever such a thing heard of Miss and her papa presented together Then did  you  never  come out  till now papa  Sir Robert  Pshaw mine is quite a different business If I am put into a great office I must be presented in course  Georgina  Why what are you going to be  Sir Robert  That I cannot tell  Georgina  If they give you your choice pray be a duke O how I shou'd doat on your being a duke  Sir Robert  Why  Georgina  Then I shou'd be a ladyLady Georginadelightful Lady Georgina's name should fly about the town as though it were made with wings to it  Sir Robert  Nonsense You a duke's daughter indeed A pretty figure you'd make as a duke's daughter  Georgina  Figure Where the difficulty I can do it exactlyyou shall see nowWhen I was last at Lady Horatia Horton's a countess from the Opera came in thus  striding across and sitting down abruptly  Bless me Lady Horatia how cou'd you be at home tonight I gallopp'd sixty miles today have kill'd one coachhorse and spoiled another merely to hear the BantiO the Banti  Sir Robert  The bantling why whose bantling was it  Georgina  O her upper tonesand O her under tones whilst she was flying from B to C hanging upon G running into cantabile from E and sinking down by just gradations to D the whole house were magnetizedI saw a general fainta minister of state take out his smelling bottle and a prince of the blood blew his nose  Sir Robert  Blew his nose very affecting indeed and countesses are charming creatures But dear Georgina the warmth of thy imagination would disturb my peace did not thy extreme giddiness prevent its fastening on any one object for more than ten minutes together Hah take care of thyself my dear Georgina thou art treading upon mentraps and springguns Thy paths though seemingly covered with flowers are full of thorns prickles and adders  Georgina  Thorns prickles and adders law Papa why people never seem to feel them and I dare say I shall dance over them as lightly as my neighbours  Exit  Sir Robert  Yes DISSIPATION  thou  art the enemy of female honour It is on thy accursed altar that the peace of the wife the repose of the husband and the welfare of whole families are continually offer'd up O shield my child  lifting up his eyes and hands  from the corruption of DISSIPATION  Exit  SCENEASGILL's  Lodgings    CONWAY  enters preceded by a Servant    Servant  My master is engaged Sir but I will acquaint him that you are here  Exit  FANCOURT  runs in    Fancourt  Hah Conway I saw you come in so I follow'd you upI know you are  at home  in Asgill's lodgings  Conway  Are you acquainted with Mr Asgill  Fancourt  No notwithstanding he keeps good company and is nephew to a rich old Sir Simon in the City who between loans and lumber makes money faster than he tells lies but there are an odd sort of three corner'd mortals one can never  close  withthey present a point at every turn you may as easily come into contact with a porcupine I know all the people in town except himself and I came in on purpose to ask you to make us intimate  Conway  That will be impossible Pray Fancourt how do you get acquainted with every body forlet me say it in a whisperyour reputation is not of the very first water  not whispering  Fancourt  Pho what men are  diamonds  in the way of reputation French paste does as well and one is not so much afraid to damage it If I were such a fellow as you with a character of the true water I should be in eternal anxiety never dare to turn to the right or the left fearful of a speck here of a flaw there as it is I brush on through the worldmy French paste makes a shew and if I lose itwhy I lose a thing of no value  Conway  Amazing  Fancourt  Hang me if I would be troubled with a first rate character any more than with a first rate beautyit would only  create envy and my friends would never rest 'till they had robb'd me of it  Conway  O that talents should be thus enlisted in the service of vice  Fancourt  That I swear you learnt from our old oneeyed Proctor of Brazen NoseI remember the very words I have heard them fifty times whilst I stood on his blind side O that a man should thus live on the scraps of others all his life and never  dare  coin a principle for himself So you won't introduce me to Asgill  Conway shakes his head  very well very wellI'll introduce myself to an Archbishop before I am a week older and get myself made a Prebend in revenge  Exit  Enter  ASGILL  Conway  Asgill I am come to disengage myself from the hunt I cannot be with you tomorrow  Asgill  Very wellI shall not enquire your reasons nor shall I pretend to guess that there is a little Welch Diana in the way of the hunt you have not seen her I dare swear  Conway  Be not so daringI  have  seen her but I have only seen her She is as wild as one of the kids on her father's mountains  Asgill  Where have you met with her  Conway  At Lady Horatio Horton's but her volatility is so great that it wou'd be as easy to catch quicksilver  Asgill  I cannot say I think soshe does not want life but it is the sweet pensiveness of her character that charms mea thousand graces  hang about pensiveness which mere animal spirits destroy  Conway  I have not seen her in that humour  Asgill  And then her fine taste  Conway  Her taste is as fine as other people's I dare swear but she will bear a little polish  Asgill  She  bear polishha ha ha where will you find such a mind such an understanding  Conway  I have no doubt of its native excellence and I hope to have the pleasure of improving it  Asgill  You what do you mean Sir of whom are you speaking  Conway  Of whom do you speak  Asgill  Of Lady Horatia Hortondid you not name her  Conway  Ha ha ha so this is confidence by chance dear Asgill I have blundered on your secret very undesignedlyI was speaking of the daughter of Sir Robert Floyer  Asgill  But you mentioned Lady Horatia and the moment her idea is presented to me every other is swallowed up O Conway she engrosses my whole soulto see her is bliss and the sound of her voice is rapture  Conway  Heyday  Asgill  You  have  the secret by chance but you are welcome to it and I am prepared for all your jests on my passion for a woman who is devoted to sculpture  Conway  Faith I perceive no room for jests I think it must be charming to see a fine woman sit with a chissel and bring out of a block of marble a form as graceful as her own every feature glowing with animation beneath  her eye and every stroke of the mallet warming the cold mass into mind and expression  Asgill  smiling and catching his hand  I thank you but your eulogy is not compleat for the purity of my Horatia chastises the art she loves The subjects she selects Delicacy itself would paint out with an enchanting modesty she seeks for models only in the graces of her own sex the daughters of Britain and the matrons of Greece  Conway  Very well but you are a  Son  of Britaindoes Lady Horatia  Asgill  eagerly  YesnoI can not tell She treats me with rigour yet I think her heart has passion I sometimes fancy I see it shine like the sun in Novemberunwillingly and by starts  Conway  Why do you not lead to an explanation  Asgill  I cannot for she is rich and I am as you know dependent on the will of an Uncle  Conway  He has the reputation of being a Croesus  Asgill  True but a fortune whose basis is commerce may be doubled or dissolved in a month  Conway  Well Pray for me my dear Asgill that I may catch my little Welch fawn I have no prayers to make for  you  for I perceive your's is one of those sober passions that end as it may your mind will keep its equilibrium O how delightful it must be to love with so much good sense  Exit laughing  Asgill  O how he mistakes it is in souls like mine that love rages with all his fury  The gay the volatile can scarcely  maintain  a passion but in the serious and reflective mind love raises a despotic throne and like the burning sun of Africa he pours his chiefest ardors upon slaves  Enter  PERKINS  Perkins how now your looks alarm me What news from the City  Perkins  O Sir  Asgill  My good friend speak You very much distress me Something is amiss  Perkins  Would I could say your fears were unfounded Something is amiss your Uncle  Asgill  Nay speak at once I can bear any thing rather than suspence  Perkins  Then summon all your fortitude your Uncle the good Sir Simon has sent me to tell you thatheisundone  Asgill  Oh  pressing his forehead with his hand  undone did you say so Perkins did you  Perkins  The misfortunes which have shaken the trade of Europe have at last reached him He who lately ranked on Change a two hundred thousand pound man may not when his creditors are satisfied be able to command one thousand pound  Asgill  after a distressful silence  Your news is heavy very heavy leave me dear Perkins I want to ruminate on my misfortunes alone  Exit Perkins  Throws himself into a chair  My worthy my unhappy Uncle the tide of affliction must roll  heavy on him  Arises after a pause  It is determinedI see Lady Horatia no more Nonever more  sighing deeply  never shall her delicacy be insulted by seeing a  beggar  court her to his arms  Walks backwards and forwards  But what can I do bred to no profession knowing nothing ignorant of every art by which independence or even  bread  may be obtained I am thrown a vagabond upon the world O my too indulgent Uncle when you sent me to Cambridge had you placed me rather in a countinghouse I might now have been in a situation to have soften'd all your afflictionsinstead of whichO horror my soul sickensmy head is dizzyI sink to death  Goes off reeling  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  A Lodging House  TIPPY  walks hastily across the stage and almost goes offMrs

pronounce on Paintings and Tokayon Statues and Old Hock I know exactly the grapes from which the one was pressed and the age in which the other was chissell'dpsha man there requires little to be a connoisseur but impudence  Fancourt  Wellbut how do you live plainlyhow do you eat  Tippy  For the last three months I have eat on the strong likeness I bear to Lord Beechgrove  Fancourt  The resemblance is astonishing they call you his polygraph  Tippy  You are mistaken They call his Lordship  my  polygraph  Fancourt  I stand corrected But how have you lived on this resemblance has he taken you up for the sake of the likeness  Tippy  Taken me up you are curst unlucky in your phrases today No nohe has been useful to me without his knowledge for instance I pass'd one night through Portland Place and saw a great route I dash'd into the hall cursing the crowd of carriages which prevented  my chariot  from coming up The porter instantly knew me gave my nameand LORD  BEECHGROVE resounded all the way up the stairs The lady of the house received me placed me immediately at a Loo table and in two hours I brought off two hundred guineas  Fancourt  Lucky rascal  Tippy  I lately

ten days took my leave to visit my Cumberland estate and ordered the bill to be ready against my return  Fancourt  Gad I advise you to take his Lordship up and swear that he's an impostoryou may then  enjoy  his Cumberland estate  Tippy  I have taken a fancy to an estate in another county a better scheme my boy  slapping him on the shoulder  A plan which sometimes forces me to take shelter like

principality  Sir Robert  in a passion  Why Sir what do you mean They never had such a friend I spent more money to favour the cause than I care to own I was for ever on horseback there was not a cottager who could influence the sixteenth cousin of a voter whom I did not entertain and the fact is it was solely owing to me  Fancourt  What do you take me to be such a ninny as to plead your  services  You are a mere chicken Listen I say SNAPPER we must have him on our side  sips  The old scoundrel killed his set of coach greys and fifteen nags in riding about the country to oppose us  sips  He is a great fool but he is related to all the  ap Morgans  and the  ap Shoneses  in three counties  In short we must have himso here goes "the girl we love" Thus  I  swallow the girl  he  swallows the hint and the business is done Will you lend me the thousand pounds  Sir Robert  I willI understand this is what you call kicking a man up stairs  Fancourt  Only for a month  Sir Robert  Nay if it is for six weeks I shall not stand upon a fortnight  Fancourt  Thus it is to deal with men of generosity  Sir Robert  Call upon me after dinner I am hurried just now our member lives in the

about where Madam makes men and women all in marble  Maid  Perhaps you may get a peep at it There is company there at present It is called a school  Humphrey  School Zooks I am glad to hear great

I rejoice to see you They did not tell me you were here  Charlotte  I have been here a long while delighting myself with your charming works But how full of  labour  is the amusement you have chosen  Lady Horatia  I do not find it so  Lady Charlotte  So different from fashionable life  Lady Horatia  O the labour of a fashionable life wou'd kill me I should sink under it Chipping marble is playing with feathers compared to that  Lady Charlotte  How so  Lady Horatia  The discipline of a life in fashion is by no means of the mildest sort  smiling  Consider for instance the necessary vigils and abstinence of a gamester It is expedient  that she works hard and lives sparingly for if she does not keep her spirits perfectly cool instead of cheating her friend her friend may cheat her  This reflection is copied pretty nearly from the elegant Doctor Horne  My labours are less and more innocent than hers  Lady Charlotte  O I perceive you will be able to defend yourself  Lady Horatia  In the next place reflect on the toils of a  determined  beauty Whether she wakes or sleeps whatever she does whereever she goes it is all with relation to the one great object which engrosses her meditations After hours wasted murder'd in the  hard work  of the toilette away she springs Her wheels thunder rapidly through the streetsshe flies from assembly to assembly Does the music of the concert fascinate her No Does polish'd conversation interest her No Some other beauty has been the belle of the evening her heart has been torn with envy she returns home drags off her ornaments in disgust and throws herself on a sleepless bed in anguish Are  my  labours less pardonable than hers  Lady Charlotte  You will be too hard for me in argument so I drop your statues to talk of yourself Something I see is wrong What is it  tenderly  Come be explicit You will not speak In plain language when did you see Mr Asgill  Lady Horatia  Not this weeknonot for a whole week I will conceal nothing from you I find now that my tenderness more than equals his I have no joy leftthe chissel  drops from my hand the marble block is no longer moulded into flesh my taste has no employment and my heart is breaking  Lady Charlotte  How do you account for his absence  Lady Horatia  Tired with my haughty coldness he has forsaken me I die with jealousy and selfreproach He has found an object more amiable and more tender I knew he loved me and I gloried in my conquest  "Yet still I tried each fickle art  "Importunate and vain  "And whilst his passion touch'd my heart  "I triumph'd in his pain"  O Asgill thou art revenged  Lady Charlotte  What hearts we possess Always too cold or too feeling My dear Horatia stonify your's a little As you give spirit to marble transfuse the marble to your heart See here is your little Welch friend  Enter  GEORGINA  Georgina  O Lady Horatia I am so rejoiced Bless me you are weepingwhat has happened  Lady Charlotte  A favourite goldfinch has happened to die my dear  Georgina  And last night I lost a Canary bird I am sure I cried for half an hour Give me your goldfinch and we will bury them together O dear and you shall copy them in marble that will be a sweet task for you  Lady H takes her hand and smiles  You know what I have hurried here for  Lady Horatia  No  Georgina  No Why did not you tell me you wanted to give my form to the statue of AndromacheAndromache mourning for her husband that you have just began to chip out there you know  pointing to a block of marble  Lady Horatia  I did so but I am out of spirits today  Georgina  O I will not be disappointed Your favourite work will put you in spirits I have brought a dress for the purpose Humphrey bring it in  HUMPHREY  enters with the dress and shews marks of aukward wonder    I shall be sadly mortified if you send me away  Lady Charlotte  Come sit down Lady Horatia it will amuse you  Georgina  Yes do and 'tis very fortunate that I lost my Canary bird I'll think of that and then I shall look sad enough for Hector's widow  Lady Horatia  Pho you little chit Well stand on the pedestal and lean on the broken column now with proper pensiveness and grace  Georgina runs up steps behind the pedestal  Georgina  Yes I will be exactly the thing  tries to look very melancholy  O my poor Canary bird  Lady Horatia  Ha ha ha Come let us place your drapery in statue like order  she and Lady Charlotte place the folds  Now keep steady and think of your Canary bird  Enter Servant  Servant  Mr Conway  Lady Horatia  Who  Servant  Mr Conway  Georgina  starting  Dear Mr Conway

Grecian character  Tippy  What is this is this Lady Horatia's chissel    looking thro' his glass    Conway  Noit is by a greater artist  Tippy  An English one I'll be sworn    looking    Grecian indeed a mere blockchipper  Conway  Is it ill proportioned  Tippy  Pshaw nonsense talk of proportions to scale makers and carpenters the thought is mechanical a mere wax doll where are the inflexions a human figure made on this principle could never move Now I will convince  younothing like conviction observe the muscle of this foot  Georgina  shrieks  O do not touch me  leaps down  There Sir you see I can move and I can dance  dancing round him  Tippy seats himself in extreme confusion on the pedestal  Lady Charlotte  What  Mr Tippy the breathing form of beauty a wax doll the work of a block

Georgina  Georgina  Why  you  were the person whom I wanted to make a fool ofpray follow him  Conway  How is it possible for me to quit the spot where you  Georgina  I declare Mr Conway I will not hear you I have told you so twenty times And as to your kneeling one finds such things in novels but no man who really loves thinks of such fooleries  Conway  rising  How do you know that  Georgina  I am sure of it there was a young man who came down to Glamorganshire from College and almost broke his heart about me and he never knelt once  Conway  startled  O roses and carnations  aside  thendidhowhow I say were you sure that he loved you  Georgina  How O I was sure of it  Conway  Was he always telling you so  Georgina  He never told me so once He used to run away from me and at last he had a fever and in his ravings he talk'd of no one but me  Conway  Who told you so  Georgina  His sister told me so  Conway  And did you not pity him  Georgina  Yes I pitied him because I could not love him  Conway  O that saves my life  aside  And where is he now  Georgina  I don't know but I have heard he is recovered and makes a very great figure somewhere They always get over it  Conway  But if you should not love  me  I should die  Georgina  Love I wou'd not love for all the world Miss Gwatkin was in love once and she grew as pale as horseradish Foolish creature if she had kept her colour perhaps the Gentleman would have liked her  Conway  O let me teach you to love I see you are yet as ignorant of it as  Georgina  As that fine Mr Tippy was of sculpture ha ha teach me to love what teach me to be wretched to weep to be sleepless to lose my bloom O if I ever thought it possible that I could love you I should hate you beyond all bearingI would fly from you and never see you more  Runs off hastily  Conway  She flies O happy omen let her but dread me and I have advanced one step if she fears to love me the business is half compleated  Going off with an air of triumph

seized with a vertigo which is sometimes very troublesome  smothering a laugh  If I had a glass of hartshorn and water  Sir Robert  HereThomasHumphrey I'll go myself  Exit  Fancourt  Ha ha ha he has seen the  real  Lord Beechgrove O my back cracks like an old wainscot The thousand is gone like last year's moonshire if I can't  TIPPY  enters    O you devil out of the house  Tippy  What has happen'd  Fancourt  What has happen'd why old Taffy has seenout of the housedo not stay to ask questions he has seen your  polygraph  outouthere he comes  Tippy vanishes  SIR ROBERT  enters follow'd by a Servant with a glass    O this will be too much for me I fear at last Sir Robert you are very good  drinks  O bless me every spring and fail I am better now You were pleased to say something Sir about my friend Lord Beechgrove O I remember nowhe met you and did not recollect you  Sir Robert  That was very odd tho' and I saidsays I  My Lord the thousand pounds which Mr Fancourt spoke to me of  Fancourt  Did youdid you  coughs and laughs with his back turned  Well Sir Robert and what said my Lord  Sir Robert  Never a wordnever a word Stared as though I had been a new caught monster I had not changed  my  dress though he had changed his The difference of dress made me almost think once that I might be mistaken but on looking again I was sure of my man  Fancourt  Ayepray what was his dress Sir  Sir Robert  Regimentals  Fancourt  Regimentals a hint  significantly aside  O he had his regimentals onayehe is a Colonel in the Guards Rather odd not speaking I confess but a man whose head is stuff'd with the business of all Europe must be forgiven if a slight acquaintance slips out of it  Sir Robert  Why I can make allowances Mr Fancourt I remember myself when I was High Sheriff for the county I once passed an acqaintance but I made him an apology and Sir I shall expect an apology from my Lord for not returning my bow before I advance the thousand pounds A thousand pounds is money Mr Fancourt  Fancourt  It isit is Sir and the man who will not make a bow for a thousand pounds ought never to possess a thousand pence  laughs aside  I will go Sir and bring his Lordship here  going  He dines today at the Dutchess's in his own square but I'll engage to bring him away in spite of wit and beauty and champaigne  I'll be a match for thee yet old Taffy  aside  Exit  Sir Robert  I wish my Lord wou'd invite me to dine at a Dutchess's I never did dine with a Dutchess It must be very delightful I should go back to Glamorganshire and be able to amuse my neighbours with all her Grace's bons mots and repeat her Grace's toasts I would hold my assskin slily under the table and pencil down her good things 'Tis all the fashion now Many a man gets a dinner by being known to write down the wit of his host or hostess tho' after long watching he frequently brings away empty tablets  Exit  GEORGINA  enters laughing audibly followed by  JENNY  Jenny  Aye Miss you may laugh but for my part I doesn't see any thing in your alablaster statutesall of one colour like a duck's egg Give me a fine large picture with robes of red and blue and rich damask cartains  Georgina  Your taste is excellent  continuing to laugh  Jenny  But if you talk of statuary go to Mrs Silvertip's  Georgina  Who is she  Jenny  Why a lady who makes the finest statutes in the world all in wax There are generals and sailors and princesses and dukesand old women more natural than life Now if I can raise her curiosity to go there Jack's business is done  aside  Georgina  Dear Jenny how can I see them  Jenny  Why by going to her Exhibition on Fishstreethill  Georgina  Fishstreethillwhere is that  Jenny  Hang me if I know  aside  O Miss every body knows where that is 'Tis just by Grosvenor Square  Georgina  I wonder if she wou'd teach me her art  Jenny  Yes to be sure she wou'd All arts are to be learnt by those who have money except the art of being happy  Georgina  Then the first use I would make of it should be to imitate the features of Mr Conway in wax I then shou'd be able to look at him without blushing and even talk to him without his being a bit the wiser  Jenny  Mr Conway indeed  aside petulantly  Georgina  O dear yes I will I will learn the art I know his countenance so well that I shou'd be able to copy it without ever seeing him more And yet there is  one  look which  no  art can imitate  tenderly  Jenny  Devil take him  aside  Well Miss I'll carry you there tomorrow But Sir Robert must not know it  Georgina  O not for the world I will go I will goI will go  Runs off  Jenny  Yes so you shall but Mr Conway shall never be the better for it You have a large fortune my dear and are handsome my brother is handsome and has no fortunethe best reason for to bring you together  Enter  SIR ROBERT  Sir Robert  Where is my daughter  Jenny  Just gone to her dressingroom Sir  Sir Robert  Then I'll go and hear her on the harp a little She has a sweet finger aye and she is a sweet girl but my heart has a thousand aches about her and dearly as I love her I am ready sometimes to exclaim with the old song  "I wonder any man alive would ever have a daughter"  Jenny  O you old if you'd had wit enough for to have put a proper value on my charms I would have taken every care about your daughter off your handsbut I'll be revenged for all your tricks here I have been spending anxious days and sleepless nights for two yearsmaking up the smartest caps of wash'd gauze and dyed ribbonsbuying new braids of hair of a nice nut brownand all without being able to touch the old goose any more than if his heart was made of leather But I'll match you since you will not make  me  your wife I'll give your daughter a husband and if you should die of the mortification I know where to find a place to dance on  Exit  SCENE IVASGILL  's Lodgings    Enter  ASGILL  and  CONWAY  Asgill  O 'tis in vain never Conway will I sue for compassion from a proud beauty who  treated me with haughtiness even when she believed me heir to prosperity  Conway  Pride and loveliness ought to go together I dislike the vulgar railing against the haughtiness of conscious beauty She who  over  values herself will never sink too low and the lady of whom we speak perhaps loves you  Asgill  For that very reason I will not again appear before her  I  am too proud to raise a conflict in her bosom between her pride and her tenderness and to owe at length perhaps to her  compassion  the acceptance to which her love would never have acceded  Conway  You are very nice If my heart were not preoccupied and so fine a woman had an inclination to make me master of herself and fortune I would not quarrel with her about the motive I wou'd thank the pretty creature and give her all the love I could  Asgill  Yes but you are a man of fortune By this time I suppose people begin to talk of my distress'd state  Conway  I have heard it mentioned  Asgill  What has been said  Conway  A lady observed that it was pity a man so handsome shou'd be sunk so low and her husband said he was sorry because you were such a good kind of young man  Asgill    with contempt    Good kind of young man I am sorry I have incurr'd such an approbation    Conway seems surprised    No no do not imagine    smiling    that I wish for the reputation of a bad heart But the term "  Good kind of young man  " in our days is so  applied that I desire not to be honoured with it An idle fellow who hangs loose on society without merit or avocation or one who corrupts the sister of his friend or runs away with his daughter or does all those things which mankind ought to execrate is said in excuse to be  a good kind of young man  In short good kind of young man in the present acceptance may very fairly be translated  scoundrel    Enter Servant  Servant  Sir here is the person you ordered from Towerhill Slopseller I think he calls himself  Exit  Conway  Slopseller How do you translate that Apothecary I suppose  Asgill  Ha ha ha No I assure you A Towerhill slopseller does not deal in emulsions and syrups hebut you must excuse my telling you what he deals in    growing grave    My dear Conway adieu Often  think  of me and speak of me as I deserve but be sure you never suffer people to call me  a good kind of young man    Conway  Asgill though there is some pleasantry in your manner there is also a seriousness which shocks me What are you going to do  Asgill  What I ought to do What do you imagine I intend to stay at home to parade Bondstreet and make the circle of Piccadilly Saint James'sstreet and Pallmall No no my burning brain cannot be cooled by such expedients 'tis only the powerful voice of my country can regulate its distractionAsk no questionsmy resolution is fixedFarewell  Conway  What and is the frenzy of your brain regulated by the hope of serving your country Do all your  private  woes sink before that powerful principle O glorious effect of patriotic love Every selfish feeling vanishesto tear myself from you becomes a DUTY I godespise not this weaknessI venerate I pity you  Exit  Asgill  Friend of my heart He goes in tears Oh the drops which manly friendship forces from the eye are more precious than those collected in the groves of rich Arabia They sink into my heartthey  cherish  it Now come in Sir  Enter a Man with a bundle  Have you brought what I ordered  Man  Yes here are the things Sir    opens the bundle    Asgill  This then is the complete dress of an English sailor  Man  Complete    opening and displaying it    Asgill  O the sight of it warms my heart In this dress what heroes have bledwhat gallant acts have been atchieved Those who have worn it have given England all her gloryhave given her the boundless empire of the ocean  Man  Ay Sir it was your Raleighs and your Drakes and your Boscawens who did all that  Asgill  O whilst our grateful retrospection twines laurels around the heroes of departed days let us not forget what is due to those of our own Let us look with gratitude towards a HOWE and hang with tributary tears over  the names of MONTAGUE HARVEY and HUTT  Man  Ah the three last are gone  Asgill  But some remain There only wants occasion and  other  Montagues and  other  Harveys will start out like meteors and glide along the British sky blazing in glory    Goes out pressing the bundle to him    Man  Gad he's a fine fellow and will make a noble sailor but our fleets thank heaven are full of such  Exit  ASGILL  returns meeting a Servant    Asgill  There are still two bills unpaidgo and discharge them That purse contains sufficient  Exit Servant  Now all my debts paid and a few guineas in my pocket I quit my country but I quit her to serve her O may the boundless blessings of heaven descend upon her may  my  arm contribute to restore peace to her and may GLORY and MONARCHY be hers till time shall be no more  Exit  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  Lady  HORATIA's  Drawingroom    She enters with rapidity and disorder then turns and speaks  Lady Horatia  Yesorder the horses instantlyand yet noI shall not want them Go to his uncle in the city How strange that will be But can I hesitate on  decorums  when EXISTENCE is at stake Can I suffer Sidney Asgill to believe that Georgina's fooleries are my sentiments Can I suffer another to have the transport of lifting him from poverty whilst I am despised The thought breaks my heartstrings Ah Mr Conway  Enter  CONWAY  Conway  I flew the moment I received your commands  Lady Horatia  My commands Sir I only sent to askit was only with an intention to    much confused    Conway  Speak Lady Horatia    a pause    Do me the honour to repose confidence in me  Lady Horatia  Yes Sir I believe I can I believe I oughtbut shame weighs down my very soul In one moment what will you think of me  Conway  What I have always thought that you are one of the first of your sex  Lady Horatia    walks a little way in extreme agitation then returns    I must speak for the conflict is too great for me to endure You are the friend of Asgillthe friend of his youththe chosen of his heart    he bows    Permit me to then to ask even though your answer shou'd be a breach of confidence did you ever hear him mention any other lady as one as onewith whom he wished to unite his fate  Conway  O never You are the object of his adoration  Lady Horatia    with quickness    Then find him outpursue him What have I said My soul shrinks at the sound of the words I have uttered  Conway  Would my Asgill's ears could have received them Go on Madam  Lady Horatia  Go on Alas need I add another sentence You see thathumble me not too farI am proudHad Asgill continued the heir of splendid possessions perhaps my pride and coldness would never have abated but he is poor he is undone  Conway  Peerless woman  Lady Horatia  My fortune is hismy heart my soul  Conway  O suffer me to kneel for him For him I thank you adorable transcendent woman  Lady Horatia  I feel your kindness in endeavouring to abate my confusion The step I have taken I shou'd yesterday have thought less easy than to die Permit me to leave you nor  dare  to think    with resumed dignity    that because my passion is strong my conduct shall be  weak My reputation is in your hands preserve it as you wou'd your own life and honour  Exit  Conway  I accept the glorious deposit and I will deserve the trust What grace can dignity of soul bestow The very conduct which from a vulgar mind would disgust from such elegance and virtue becomes fascinating Now Asgill I will dare to seek thee and I will pour such transport on thy heart as shall make thee confess the hour of thy poverty the most blessed of thy life  Exit  SCENE II  Sir  ROBERT FLOYER's  Library    Enter Sir  ROBERT  in a hurry followed by a Servant    Sir Robert  Bring up his lordship and Mr Fancourt directlyfly downnever keep a lord in waiting  Exit Servant    Sits    No I won't receive his lordship

You found me sprawling at your feetit shews how devoted I am to your service  Tippy  Sir Robert I have often heard of the politeness of the Welch gentlemen and you really confirm all that has been said The year in which you were sheriff Sir Robert was such a year of splendour and magnificence as Glamorganshire will long remember We heard a vast deal of it at Saint James's it amused the Royal Circle for a month  Sir Robert  Why my lord I did my best on that occasion When I was high sheriff for the county I neither spared myself or my purse A hanging in the morning and an assembly at night giving the judges a dinner today and tomorrow consulting Jack Ketch about a new gallows Such a variety of business my lord demands a man's whole attention  Tippy  Certainly certainly A little thing happened this morning Sir Robert which has given me pain You addressed me in the Park I really was at that moment throwing over in my mind the compact between Russia and Poland In short I had almost determined to go to Saint Petersburgh ambassador myself for I think one or two points might be revised At that very moment Sir Robert just as I was  delivering my credentials to the Empress and receiving one of those  delicious  smiles which  Fancourt  You will go too far    twitching him    Tippy  I say just then Sir Robert you addressed me  Sir Robert  No wonder my lord that you overlooked  me  I am ashamed to have made a complaint of such a trifle  Fancourt  Pray my lord examine Sir Robert's shelves you will find them well stocked  Sir Robert  All dead stock my lord heavy dead stock  Tippy  Pardon me Sir pardon me Such stock is never dead You have here in calf'sskin and sheep'sskin the very souls of the authors Well chosen I dare say  Sir Robert  Why my lord as to the choice I left that to my broker He furnished the whole house from the kitchen to the garret the pots and the poets the fryingpans and the philosophers were all of his choosing  Fancourt  Now Sir Robert if you would do the thing genteely write the draft without his observing it and I'll present it to him after we have left the house Great men must not have services tendered them coarsely  Sir Robert  I understand you there is a nice way of doing things Pray my lord amuse yourself with a folio or two A certain delicateit shall be so    goes and writes    Tippy    taking up a book    "The debates of Leadenhallstreet" Pleasant readinglight pretty reading in a heavy morning  Fancourt  LeadenhallstreetA thought strikes me  Tippy  Then strike again  Fancourt  I say my lord as Sir Robert is a liberal man and fond of patronage suppose you give him by way of outset a place at the Board of Controul for Indian affairs just till a better thing offers    Sir Robert writes and listens by turns    Tippy  The thought was too obvious to be missedexactly suits his discernment and spirit    whispers then speaks audibly    The nabobs    whispers    the begums    whispers    muslins alaballas mulmuls and nansooks    whispers    Nankeen china    whispers    Patna rice    whispers    Sir Robert    runs up    O my lord my lord    slides the draft into Fancourt's hands    Not a wordmum    his finger to his lip      Fancourt holds up the draft to catch Tippy's eye    Tippy  Faith I had better go about it directlyno time to be lostlet us finish the business at once    looking significantly at Fancourt

distant imitation  Sir Simon  It is the first instance of his folly I ever heard I thought Sidney had been a different sort of a man  Lady Horatia  I suppose you have been employing  your  talents to

angrily    Sir not endure her why she is the most charming of her sex That lady Sir has more sweetness of disposition more playful innocence of heart and more beauty than half the women in the world  Sir Simon  I hope  I  may form a different opinion Mr Conway  Conway  No Sirno man shall form a different opinionor if he does he must take care to conceal it in my presence  Sir Simon  I shall take  no  care Sir I will use the freedom of an Englishman to speak all I think of you and of every man and of every woman too How dared she assume a character she was nothow dared she say such things of my nephew to my face  Conway  Sir whatever that lady says I make myself answerable for  Perkins  O Gentlemen let me entreat you you will both be sorryyou have been both too warm  Conway  I advise you to

Fancourt  Yes it was my devil I see clearly  aside  Georgina  This seeming lady is probably one of the two men I had notice of who introduced himself here to carry on designs which make me tremble

retrieve her errors before it be too late and like you take  shelter  in the arms of a fond and forgiving father    embracing her    My dear Georgina I wish thou hadst either a mother  or  a husband

always ready to make amends A little gipsey yesterday took your name and railed at Sidney I could not bear it  Lady Horatia  And was it therefore Sir that you insulted my art Was it therefore that you laughed at and abused my  Sir Simon  Your monsters Madam O keep clear of them whatever you do Don't talk of them  Lady Horatia  Why is this possible  Sir Simon  Madam this life is too short to squander time upon trisles so let us come to the point I am told that you have a great regard for my nephew and I love and admire you for it talk of him and we shall agree to the end of the chapter  Lady Horatia  The person who told you so Sir took an unwarrantable freedom  Sir Simon  Why you told me so yourself Would any lady fly into the city to talk to a cross old fellow about his nephew if she had not set her heart upon him Pho pho that spoke your sentiments pretty plainly  Lady Horatia  weeping with vexation  O dear I tell you I hate your nephew  Sir Simon  Do you O you woman You downright woman I see how it is When he was rich you loved him when you looked forward to fine equipage splendour and expence you acknowledged his merits but now that you have heard he is poor you despise him O woman woman  Lady Horatia    with heat    Sir it is false You injure me in every part of your opinion When he was rich he never knew that he had caused a tender thought in me it was only his poverty that made my passion break out without disguise It was his distress that made me feel and acknowledge I adore him  Sir Simon  What then you do love him  Lady Horatia    much confused    What have I said  Sir Simon  What you ought never to recal Speak on you now talk like a sensible woman  Lady Horatia  Well then receive my full confession You his second father Mr Asgill has twined himself into my soul his poverty has endeared him to me a thousand times Go Sir search him out bring him from his retreat and tell him that Horatia Horton knows no value in wealth but in the pleasure of dividing it with him  Sir Simon  Huzza huzza here's a woman for ye Madam he is not poor I'll put down for Asgill thousand for thousand as long as you please and when I die leave him a plumb  Lady Horatia  Sir  Sir Simon  It was all a sagacious trick of  mine I wanted to try if the dear lad really loved me and if he possessed real worth of soul Sentiments truly noble he often uttered but noble sentiments are uttered by scoundrels who do not possess one feeling which if brought to the touchstone would not disgrace humanity  Lady Horatia  Mr Asgill not poor    pausing    Nay then I understand the flimsy contrivance A pitiful plot to force me to reveal a secret which I chose to bury in the bottom of my heart Presuming    haughtily    Make  me  a dupe Now Sir know that your nephew rich and your nephew poor are two distinct persons I detest his art and recal all I have said The  rich  Mr Asgill I shall teach myself henceforward to despise  Exit  Sir Simon  Whu Why what's in the wind now Upon my soul I would rather cast up the most intricate account of compound interest than attempt to calculate what will please a woman Refuse a man because he is rich  Enter  PERKINS  Perkins  O Sir I followed you here without your permission my tidings are so good Mr Asgill is found  Sir Simon  Ah Perkins I saw it in thy eyes without a word Thou art an honest fellow Perkins    squeezing his hand

Mrs Fancourt  I do not understand you I never was at more than one masquerade nor ever formed a wish to repeat it  Fancourt  And the habit you then wore I remember was that of a Savoyard  Mrs Fancourt    starting    It was  Fancourt  And did you then tell fortunes too  Mrs Fancourt    aside    I die with fear Surely I am betrayed  Fancourt    seizing her hand    Come tell me Madam have you not lately repeated the scene of the Savoyard  Mrs Fancourt  Sir O he will have no mercy on me    trembling    Fancourt  But why need I ask I know you have That fortunetelling was a pretty thought my dear but did it occur to you to tell your own fortune Did you foretel to yourself your own fate on the discovery  Mrs Fancourt  Alas I know too well I must expect all that malice and revenge can inspire but if I have saved an innocent from destruction and turned away the arrow which was about to pierce the heart of her benevolent father I am resigned  Enter two Men  Fancourt  Who are you who enter

drawing forth another      st Man    Here is a coach waiting below with two of our companions so the quicker you are the better  Fancourt    pale and trembling    This sudden surprise has overpowered me On whose account do I see you    st Man    You'll know that in proper time I never likes to answer trogatories  Fancourt  Where am I going    d Man    You'll see when we arrive  Fancourt  Wherever it is I will not stir without this woman She shall accompany me wherever I go    d Man    Why you have a very fond husband Madam  Mrs Fancourt  Not so but he  is  my husband I therefore follow without

out and walks to the front He looks at her earnestly  Now art thou a woman or a griffin prithee tell me  Jenny  Dear Sir I can tell you no more than I have I have confess'd every thing and on  my bended knees I ask for mercy    kneeling    I am not a griffin Sir  Sir Robert  Get up your flummery of kneeling has no effect How far I shall have mercy on a wretch who plann'd the dishonour of my child I shall consider I have never met with so atrocious a jade since the year I was high sheriff for the county Retire Your brother my Lord Beechgrove approaches  Jenny    starting up    I care not

The foe is numerous but weak Conquest and pillage are our own  They go off  Sir Robert    looking after them    I am glad you are off These gentlemen have given me some amusement together with some experience and it has cost me only one thousand pounds a cheap bargain  Exit  SCENE  Lady  HORATIA's  Drawingroom    Lady  HORATIA  enters accompanied by Lady  CHARLOTTE  Lady Horatia  NonoAdieu to low spirits for ever My heart is as light as the feather in your hair I know all Mr Conway has told me every thing there was no plot on  me  No my Asgill has proved himself in the hour of trial as noble as delicate as brave as my fancy had always painted him  Lady Charlotte  Well happiness is a most becoming thing it gives fire and expression to every feature But can it be possible that Mr Asgill should design to  serve  as a sailor I thought the party with whom he  Lady Horatia  Mention  parties  at an hour like this O let such distinctions melt into air and be obliterated for ever Let every party join hand and heart to save this country and to cherish its BLESSED CONSTITUTION  Lady Charlotte  See here comes Georgina playing the little tyrant with her enamour'd Conway  Enter  CONWAY  leading  GEORGINA  Georgina  I protest I will not hear such things Mr Conway    snatches away her hand    Why will you teaze me thus Lady Horatia I beg you chide him for he has been talking nonsense to me all the way in your coach  Lady Horatia  It will give him more pleasure if you chide him Nay I will be more  malicious still spite of your frowns I absolutely will tell you  Georgina puts her hand to Lady Horatia's mouth  You do not hate him  Conway  O that sound is bliss to me  Georgina  Ah but I am sure I do not love him  Conway  How do you know angel  Georgina  Why I never keep wakeful about you nor ever dream about you And I do not grow pale like Miss Gwatkin and I eat my breakfast with pleasure and I dine very well and if I do not see you for a whole day together I only thinkwell tomorrow I shall be more lucky  Conway    in rapture    Enough enough more than I hoped On these terms I am content to bind my fate to yours Such artless candour renders you enchanting  Georgina  Well thenbut do not speak to my papa about it for whole week Bless me here's old Simon    runs to the top followed by Conway    Enter Sir  SIMON  with  ASGILL  in a sailor's dress    Sir Simon  Here Madam I have brought ye your sailor and if you do not receive him with kindness and welcome him back with your whole soul you are no woman for me  Asgill    rushing to her feet    Adored mistress of my heart am I welcome  Lady Horatia  Welcome O Asgill there are characters so high so noble that to be chained in by common decorums would be to have no taste for excellence and my heart  bounds with disdain from such frozen rules I who have hitherto treated you with coldness almost bordering on disdain now declare in the presence of my friends that I am proud to make you master of my fate that I feel exalted in having it in my power to confer happiness on you  Asgill    rising    O woman unequall'd Blessed be the hour in which you believed me poor and undone Sir Simon has been feeding my soul with exstacy  Lady Horatia  Mr Asgill you must indeed love Sir Simon but I know not how I shall set about doing so he hates the arts he thinks there is nothing dignified in sculpture he hears without veneration the names of Phidias and Michael Angelo  Sir Simon  Come come Madam throw away your chisel and your marble blocks and set about making a good wife That ART is the noblest pride of an Englishwoman  Lady Charlotte  Lady Horatia you are all smiles I declare I should not so easily have forgiven a man    looking on Asgill    who could fly from me to the boisterous ocean and prove such insensibility to beauty and love  Asgill  Misjudge me not I insensible to beauty and to love O my glowing soul confesses their force and adores their power Yet the enthusiasm which seized me when I trod the deck of the Victory can never be chill'd In the glorious tars around me valour intrepidity heroism shone forth with all their fires they flashed through my heart And I swear that should my country need my assistance I will again resume the trowsers  and sail before the mast wherever she bids her cannon roar or her proud pendants fly    Advancing forward    Ah repose on  us  And when you look on the gallant spirits who do honour to this habit let every fear subside for whilst the sea flows and English sailors are  themselves  ENGLAND MUST BE THE MISTRESS OF THE GLOBE  THE END  EPILOGUE MISS WALLIS  THROUGH five long Actsa pretty decent swing  I've been a giddy tender harmless thing  Light as a feather in the morn of May  Borne by the perfum'd breath of blueeyed day  Nor have I yet thrown by my  studied  part  GEORGINA still I am in garb and heart  GEORGINA humbly stands again before ye  Of gratitude so fullshe half adores ye  It puzzles me to guess when Conway's wife  On what sweet plan to form my married life  My heart beats high to think how I shall flash  Preeminent and bold like Lady Dash  Reflection ne'er to me shall be a damper  My curricle I'll driveon horseback scamper  Keep Pharo Bankstake the long odds at races  And know the knowing ones in all their paces  Lounge at Newmarket in the bettingrooms  And prate to Lady Harrietand my grooms  But whilst I thus blaze on in Folly's road  And profligate forsake my blest abode  Where is my husband's peacehis honourwhere  Who shall his lonely hours console and share  O the black prospect scares my trembling art  And from the headlong precipice I start  Dear  wedded happiness  my soul is thine  My pride shall be in thy mild paths to shine  My CONWAY's temperate joys I'll make my own  And  his  felicity my life shall crown  With  him  through Pleasure's paths I'll sometimes roam  But still my  first enjoyment  shall be HOME  The Household Gods ten thousand graces wear  Nor stoop to borrow tinsel'd  foreign  glare  Yet never shall your Household Deities frown  Though you should steal an hour to seeTHE TOWN
