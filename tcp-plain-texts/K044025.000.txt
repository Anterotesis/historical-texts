 REMARKS ON Mr  POPE  'S Rape of the LOCK  IN Several LETTERS to a FRIEND  With a PREFACE Occasion'd by the late Treatise on the PROFUND and the DUNCIAD  By Mr  DENNIS  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS at the  Oxford Arms  in  WarwickLane  Price s  To the Honourable  George Duckett    Esq  SIR  _AS soon as I had resolved to address the following Treatise to one of the Gentlemen who was abused together with myself in the late infamous Libel more than one Motive induced me to  make Choice of You For as no one was so flagrantly injur'd as Yourself the infamous Aspersion was so open and so manifest that there remained not the least Doubt who was the Person meant by it An Insinuation equally base and groundless which could have enter'd into the Head of no one who had either Sense Honour or Nature in him into the Head of no one but one whose Mind was equally out of Nature and equally crooked and deformed with his Body This base Insinuation was not only contrary to Truth and Justice but even contrary to common Fame for You are known  to have that Respect Esteem and Affection for the most beautiful Part of the Creation which God and Nature design'd we should have But You have Qualities to recommend You to them which have not been given to all as Truth Faith Honour Justice and a Conversation at the same time entertaining and instructing These are Qualities which have recommended You to a very fine Lady to whom You have been married many Years and by whom You have had Eight Children who are now living And these are Qualities which as they have gain'd You the Affections of the Fair Sex  have equally recommended You to the Esteem and Respect of Ours and more particularly of  SIR  Your most humble and most obedient Servant JOHN DENNIS  PREFACE  _IT was towards the latter End of the Reign of Queen ANNE that I wrote Remarks upon the first hundred Lines of the late Translation of  Homer  upon the  Windsor Forest  upon the  Rape of the Lock  and upon the infamous  Temple of Fame  provok'd and urg'd to it by the Folly the Pride and the Petulancy of that little Gentleman  A PE  Qualities which at that Time made me foresee and foretell that there was no Person whatever whom he apprehended to be above him whether by Station Power or Merit but he would come impudently one Day to fly in his Face if timely Care were not taken to chastise and correct his soaring Insolence  It was in the Beginning of the Reign of the late KING that I order'd three of the foremention'd Treatises to be publish'd  viz Remarks  on the  Translation of Homer  on  Windsor Forest  and on the  Temple of Fame  which was done with a Design to hold a faithful Glass to this little Gentleman and to cure him of his vain and his wretched Conceitedness by giving him a View of his Ignorance his Folly and his natural Impotence the undoubled Causes of so many Errors and so many Imperfections  But at the same Time that I order'd three of them to be publish'd I took care to keep back the ensuing Treatise purposely  in Terrorem  which had so good an Effect that he endeavour'd for a time to counterfeit Humility and a sincere Repentance And about that Time I receiv'd a Letter from him which I have still by me in which he acknowledg'd his Offences past and express'd an hypocritical Sorrow for them  But no sooner did he believe that Time had caus'd these Things to be forgot than he relaps'd into ten times the Folly and the Madness that ever he had shewn before He not only attack'd several Persons of far greater Merit than himself but like a mad  Indian  that runs a muck struck at every Thing that came in his Way without Distinction of Friend or Foe Acquaintance or Stranger Merit or Unworthiness Wisdom or Folly Vice or Virtue like a blind Beetle that in its blundering Flight bruises itself against every Object it meets and  does not fail to knock itself down by the impotent Blows which it gives to others  He has not only struck at very different Persons without any manner of Distinction but has thrown his rhetorical Flowers of Fool Dunce Blockhead Scoundrel promiscuously at them all as if he wisely thought that he was the only foulmouth'd Fellow in  England  or had so much of the Fool Blockhead Dunce Scoundrel within him that they have the same Effect on his Mind that Jaundice would have upon his Eyes and make every Thing without him be to him in Appearance what in Reality is within him  Nothing is more easy than to give foul Language which a Fool is more capable of giving to a wise Man than a wise Man to a Fool because nothing incapacitates a Man so much for it as good Sense good Nature good Breeding and common Discretion and nothing qualifies a Man more for it than his being a Clown a Fool a Barbarian and a Brute The calling a Man Fool Dunce Blockhead Scoundrel if it does not find him so it does by no means make him so But if it does not find him so it gives him who calls him so an unquestionable Title to those Terms himself As this is the Language of the Rabble of Mankind the more any one brings himself to use it the more he sets himself upon an infamous Level with the Scum and Offscouring of Things  Before I take my leave of this Subject I cannot help reminding this little Gentlemen  en passant  that tho' his Adversaries were as many Fools Blockheads Dunces as he is pleas'd in Hononr to them to call them yet is he most unjust and most ungrateful to reflect upon any Persons for their Want of Capacity since 'tis to People who want Understanding that he owes most of his little Fortune and all his little Reputation For I will venture to affirm that Mr  A PE  has no Admirers among those who have Capacity to discern to distinguish and judge and I will venture to foretell that Time will make this Affirmation good  Not but that I am oblig'd in Justice to own that there are several Persons of very great Merit who subscrib'd to his Translation of  Homer  but then they were Persons most of them who were induc'd to expect a very different Performance to what they found And some were importun'd and teaz'd into that Subscription some were drawn in by their Complaisance to their Friends and others sacrific'd their Judgment to their Interest  The calling a Man of the best Understanding Fool Dunce Blockhead is the easiest Thing in the World as we observ'd above to him who is really all this himself But for such a one to prove what he says is absolutely impossible Therefore in the Remarks abovemention'd upon the Translation of  Homer    upon  WindsorForest  upon the  Temple of Fame  I have given none of these Appellations to the little facetious Gentleman at whom those Pieces were levelled but then I have prov'd in them by convincing Reason and by undeniable Fact that he has a greater Right to the Possession and Property of them than any other Person in  Great Britain  whatever I have shewn that he was equally a Stranger to the Character the Language and the Meaning of  Homer  that nothing qualify'd him to enter the Lists against Sir  John Denham  but Impudence and Stupidity and that the  Temple of Fame  will as long as 'tis remember'd be to  A PE  the  Temple of Infamy  I propose to do the same Thing in the subsequent Remarks I shall call him neither Fool nor Dunce nor Blockhead but I shall prove that he is all these in a most egregious manner 'Tis justly observ'd by the Duke of  Rochfoucault    That a Man may be a very great Fool notwithstanding his  Wit  but that he never can be so if he has  Judgment  For  Imagination  is common to Man with Beasts but he enjoys  Reason  and  Judgment  in common with God and Angels  The impartial Reader who knows the  Rape of the Lock  and who will read the following  Remarks  will be able to determine whether  A PE  has shewn one Dram of Judgment either in the Choice of this trifling  Subject  or of his more senseless  Machinery  or in the  Manners  and  Behaviour  of his fine Lady who is so very rampant and so very a Termagant that a Lady in the Hundreds of  Drury  would be severely chastis'd if she had the Impudence in some Company to imitate her in some of her Actions The impartial Reader is to determine whether the  Sentiments  are not often exceeding poor and mean and sometimes ridiculous and whether the  Diction  is not often impure and ungrammatical  But if the Author has not shewn one Dram of Judgment in the Piece that has been so much applauded by Readers more light than the Subject what shall we say of the insipid  Profund  What shall we say of the fulsome  Dunciad  Were they not writ in perfect Spight to good Sense to Decency to Justice to Gratitude to Friendship to Modesty And can such a Creature as this be deserving of the noble Name of a POET the Name and the Function which he has so much blasphem'd Nay can he deserve even the Name of a Versifyer whose Ear is as injudicious and undistinguishing as the rest of his Head The Commendation which  Tasso  so justly and so judiciously gives to  Lucretius  is  Nobilissimo Versificatore  a  most noble Versifyer  For  Lucretius  knew all the Variety the Force and the Power of Numbers so that his Harmony in some Parts of him has never been surpass'd not even by  Virgil  himself But  A PE  has none of these distinguishing Talents nor  Variety nor Force nor Power of Numbers but an eternal Monotony His  Pegasus  is nothing but a batter'd  Kentish  Jade that neither ambles nor paces nor trots nor runs but is always upon the  Canterbury  and as he never mends never slackens his Pace but when he stumbles or falls So that having neither Judgment nor Numbers he is neither Poet nor Versifyer but only an eternal Rhimer a little conceited incorrigible Creature that like the Frog in the Fable swells and is angry because he is not allow'd to be as great as the Ox  But if Judgment Reason and Numbers are wanting to his Rhimes if we take a View of his prosaick Rhapsodies 'tis there a thousand times worse Not only Judgment and Reason are wanting there but Veracity Integrity Honour and Faith are wanting  A PE  sets up for a Knight of the Post a frank AffidavitMan of  Parnassus  falsifies Matter of Fact at Pleasure and invents the basest Calumnies to expose Men of Sense to Fools In the Height of his Professions of Friendship for Mr  Addison  he could not bear the Success of  Cato  but prevails upon  B L  to engage me to write and publish Remarks upon that Tragedy Which after I had done  A PE  the better to conceal himself from Mr  Addison  and his Friends writes and publishes a scandalous Pamphlet equally foolish and villainous in which he pretends that I was in the Hands  of a Quack who cures mad Men So weak is the Capacity of this little Gentleman that he did not know that he had done an odious Thing an Action detested even by those whom he fondly design'd to oblige by it For Mr  Addison  was so far from approving of it that he engag'd Sir  Richard Steele  to write to me and to assure me that he knew nothing of that Pamphlet till he saw it in Print that he was very sorry to see it and that whenever he should think fit to answer my Remarks on his Tragedy he would do it in a manner to which I should have no just Exception Thus Mr  Addison  acted like a Man of Honour and like one who foresaw what he himself had to expect from a Wretch who was capable of so much Baseness What he foresaw and expected happen'd  A PE  libell'd him in Manuscript while he liv'd and in Print after he died  'Tis a sure Sign that we live in a poor undiscerning degenerate World when one who has writ and acted as this little Gentleman has done has been able to delude it so long But as he got such Favours by ungenerous Arts he has work'd himself out of it by his Weakness and his Baseness by which he has made by a modest Computation a  Hundred Thousand  Enemies and rais'd Indignation and Disdain in the Breast of every generous and sensible Reader He has not only attack'd such Numbers of People at one Time as no one  before him ever did in any Nation or any Age but has grosly abus'd several very ingenious Men and some of them for no other Reason but because they had shewn an Understanding and Discernment and a Sagacity greatly superior to his own Among whom I am oblig'd in Justice to name Mr  Theobald  who by delivering  Shakespear  from the Injuries of Time and of lazy or ignorant and stupid Editors has oblig'd all who are concern'd for the Reputation of so great a Genius or for the Honour of  Great Britain  It was for no other Reason that he has libell'd Mr  Theobald  Mr  Phillips  and several others than that they have surpass'd him He has been so far from making that Distinction which he ought to have done that his Malice has been levell'd most at those who have most Merit which is a certain Proof that this little envious Creature knows nothing of the Nature of Satire which can never exist where the Censures are not just In that case the Versifyer instead of a Satirist is a Lampooner an infamous Libeller None of the antient Satirists neither  Horace  nor  Persius  nor  Juvenal  ever attack'd Merit And  Boileau  declares  That Merit is always precious to him and that he has a greater Esteem for  Patru  in the midst of Indigence than for one who has amass'd the greatest Treasure by base and unjustifiable Means  He did not only say this but shew'd by a very generous Action that it was his real  Sentiment  Patru  had a very noble Library consisting of a great Number of Volumes and all of them very well chosen He was reduc'd by his Circumstances to part with this Library in order to satisfy his Creditors  Boileau  hearing of this came and paid down the full Price for it and never remov'd a Volume but gave  Patru  the Enjoyment of the whole during the Remainder of his Life  But the little Gentleman who wrote the  Dunciad  and the  Profund  does not only with infinite Baseness reproach Authors with Poverty who have deserv'd a thousand times better both of their Country and the Commonwealth of Learning to both which he is an open and a mortal Enemy but he has the Impudence to infer their Want of Merit from their Want of Fortune At this rate  Spencer  the renowned Lord  Bacon    Butler  and  Otway  were Dunces and  A PE  and  Ned Howard  and two or three rich and noble Lords are Poets and great Wits At this rate  Horace  too was a Dunce because he was not only poor before  Augustus  and his first Minister cast a favourable Eye upon him but his Poverty made him a Poet Such is the Account that he gives of himself in the second  Epistle  of  Book  II  Quem dimisêre Philippi  Decisis humilem pennis inopémque paterni  Et laris fundi paupertas impulit audax  Ut versus facerem  If  Horace  was poor  Virgil  was not rich before the same magnanimous Prince and his wise and discerning Minister took him into their Protection Yet he was so far from contemning Poverty that he rather had a Contempt for Riches Witness what he makes  Evander  say to  Aeneas  in the th  Aeneid  when he introduces him into the homely Palace where  Hercules  had lain before  Ut ventum ad sedes haec inquit limina victor  Alcides subiit haec illum regia cepit  Aude hospes contemnere opes te quoque dignum  Finge Deo rebusque veni non asper egenis  And in his Praise of a CountryLife at the latter End of the second  Georgic  he seems to make Poverty the Foundation of the  Roman  Greatness  Agricola incurvo terram dimovit aratro  Hinc anni labor hinc patriam parvosque nepotes  Sustinet hinc armenta boum meritosque juvencos  Now what follows a little after this  Hanc olim veteres vitam coluere Sabini  Hanc Remus frater sic fortis Etruria crevit  Scilicet rerum facta est pulcherrima Roma  Which his Friend  Horace  seems to have done before him in the Ode to  Augustus  Lib I  Regulum Scauros animaeque magnae  Prodigum paulum superante poena  Dicam insigni referem Camoena  Fabriciumque  Hunc incomptis curium capillis  Utilem bello tulit Camillum  Saeva paupertas avitus apto  Cum cure fundus  This I will venture to say that there never was a great Poet in the World but he had a Contempt for Riches Of which Opinion likewise is  Horace  Vatis avarus  Non temere est animus versus amat hoc studet unum  And there never was a little Poetaster but he lov'd them valu'd himself upon the Possession of them and did base Things to acquire and to augment them  Nothing can shew any one more weak or more base than to prefer Fortune to Merit or vainly and vilely to endeavour to extol Fortune and to decry Merit God has given extraordinary Merit to few but he has subjected all to the Vicissitudes of human Affairs as well as to Diseases  and Death The greatest and most powerful of Monarchs are not exempted from the Power of Fortune that is from the unchangeable and irresistible Decrees of Providence Nay the greater and more powerful any one is the more deplorable Misfortunes is he subjected to And therefore the Calamities of the Great generally supply the fittest Subjects for so noble a Poem as Tragedy  Considering the Vicissitude of human Affairs Men of the greatest Fortune and Power ought not to value themselves upon either But for this little Gentleman to strut and be conceited upon his having a Hundred a Year to pretend to look down upon those whom he never had Capacity to look up to to call their good Sense and their Reasoning Railing because neither of them are his Talent to say he will answer what they urge against him when he is as much  in Debt  as they are at the same time that he owes his little Substance to a  vile Translation  of a  poor  but  excellent  Poet who if he was not  in Debt  it was because no Body would trust him To do all this entertains the Publick with the most ridiculous Farce in the World Notwithstanding this as long as he writes so scandalously as he has lately done in so degenerate an Age he will not be without Readers For all Fools are fond of Scandal because all Fools are Levellers But for the same Reasons that he has their Approbation he is contemn'd by Men of sound Understanding  And now I appeal to every impartial sensible Reader who shall have read this and the following Remarks and who has formerly read those upon  Homer    WindsorForest  and the  Temple of Fame  if I have not prov'd both by convincing Reason and by undeniable Fact That  A PE  has himself a just and indefeasible Right to all those noble Appellations and Titles which he so foolishly and so wrongfully to himself and Company squanders away upon others  REMARKS ON THE Rape of the Lock  In several LETTERS to a FRIEND  LETTER I  SIR  May  _I SHALL now according to my Promise send you some  Observations  upon the  Rape of the Lock  which is one of the last Imitations of the little mimicking Bard and one of the most impertinent to so high a Degree impertinent that I am afraid of being  accus'd of writing a  Satire  upon  Nothing  as my Lord  Rochester  wrote a  Panegyrick  The Faults of this ridiculous Poem begin at the TitlePage I will not insist upon the fantastical Composition of the Word  HeroiComical  but I desire Leave to dwell a little upon the Thing What can this Author mean by creating in his Readers an Expectation of Pleasantry when there is not so much as one Jest in his Book Of all Blockheads he is the most emphatically Dull who to an insipid tedious Tale prefixes this impertinent Prelude  Now Gentlemen expect a very good Jest Now my Masters prepare to laugh  Instead of  HeroiComical  it should have been  Heroi Tragical  since it seems there was a Necessity for a fantastical Word For there is a great deal of  Tragedy  in this Poem but not one Jot of  Comedy  But at the same Time there is nothing so  Tragical  in it as what the Author  designs  for  Comedy  For whenever he aims at a  Jest  'tis such sad deplorable Stuff that he never fails to move  Compassion  by it  But now Sir to pass from the  TitlePage  to the  Dedication  he need not have been at the Trouble of acquainting his fair Patroness that he publish'd what he calls his  Poem  before he had thought of what he calls his  Machinery  For the Book would have told her that without the Epistle For what he calls  his  Machinery  has no Manner of Influence upon what he calls his  Poem  not in the least promoting or preventing or retarding the Action of it as we shall shew more plainly when we come to treat of the  Machines  He has taken his  Machines  he tells us from the  Rosycrucians  and 'tis with them he tells his fair Patroness that he must bring her acquainted And how bring her acquainted Why he must tell her what the Count  de Gabalis  says of them who has given it seems the best Account that he knows of them If he had not too much Pride the natural necessary Consequence of his Capacity to be instructed for my Lord  Roscomon  is certainly in the Right when he tells us that  Pride of all others the most dang'rous Fault  Proceeds from Want of Sense or Want of Thought  I would direct him to a better Account of them which is to be found in a Writer of our own who is infinitely a better Judge both of Persons and Things than the fantastick Count  de Gabalis  and That is the most ingenious and most judicious Author of  Hudibras  who has given this short Account of the  Rosycrucians  in his Comment upon two Lines which are to be found in the Character of  Ralpho  the facetious Squire of  Hudibras    Canto  I  Part    and which two I have chosen for the Motto to these  Letters  In  Rosycrucian  Lore as learned  As he that  verè Adeptus  earned  The short Comment upon which is this  The Fraternity of the  Rosycrucians  is very like the Sect of the antient  Gnostici  who called themselves so from the excellent Learning they pretended to although they were really the most ridiculous Sots of all Mankind  And then upon the Words  Verè Adeptus  says he  Verè Adeptus  is one who has commenc'd in their Phanatick Extravagance  Thus if we will believe  Butler  who as we said before is an admirable Judge both of Books and of Mankind this judicious Author of the  Rape  has taken what he calls his  Machinery  from the  Phanatick Extravagance  of the most ridiculous of all modern Sots as their Predecessors the  Gnostici  were the most contemptible ones of all the Antient a Sect that is as becoming of this  merry little Gentleman  as it was of the facetious Squire of  Hudibras  And now tell me in good Earnest Sir is not the  Fair Lady  infinitely oblig'd to him for her new Acquaintance  an Acquaintance very  unbecoming Her  tho' very  becoming  of  Him  Thus Sir have I done with the  TitlePage  and the  Epistle  I shall proceed to Morrow upon the Body of the Book In the mean time I will assure you for your Comfort that you shall never have a Letter of above a Sheet of Paper at a Time upon this  impertinent Subject  I am Sir  Your most Humble and Faithful Servant JOHN DENNIS  LETTER II  SIR  May  I HOPE mine of the first of this Month came to your Hands which contain'd some Reflections upon the  Dedication  and  TitlePage  of the  Rape of the Lock  which latter creates an Expectation of  Pleasantry  in us when there is not so much as one  Jest  in the Book  Quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur ineptè  How much more judiciously does  Boileau  appear in the  TitlePage  of his  Lutrin  In a sottish Emulation of which  this  and several late  fantastick Poems  appear both to you and me to have been writ  Boileau  calls his  Lutrin  an  Heroick Poem  and he is so far from raising an  Expectation  of Laughter either in the  Title  or in the  Beginning of the Poem  that he tells Monsieur  de Lamoignon  to whom he addresses it that 'tis a  grave Subject  and must be read with a  grave Countenance  Garde toy de rire en ce grave sujet  Lutrin Chant I  Butler  modestly calls his  Poem  by the Name of his Hero  Hudibras  and without endeavouring to prepossess his Reader leaves the  Poem  itself to work its natural Effect upon him  But now Sir since I have said that the  Rape of the Lock  seems to be writ in Imitation of the  Lutrin  I mean so far in Imitation that the Author had a Mind to get Reputation by writing a great many Verses upon an  inconsiderable Subject  as  Boileau  appears to have done before him I believe it will not be disagreeable to you if I shew the Difference between the  Lutrin  and this  fantastick Poem  The  Rape of the Lock  is a very  empty Trifle  without any  Solidity  or  sensible Meaning  whereas the  Lutrin  is only a  Trifle  in  Appearance  but under that Appearance carries a very grave and very important Instruction For if that  Poem  were only what it appears to be  Boileau  would run counter to the  fam'd Rule  which he has prescrib'd to others  Auteurs prêtez l' oreille à mes instructions  Voulez vous faire aimer vos riches fictions  Qu' en sçavantes leçons votre muse fertile  Par tout joigne au plaisant le solide l' utile  Un lecteur sage fuit un vain amusement  Et veut mettre à profit son divertissement  And which  Horace  has given before him  Centuriae seniorum agitant expertia frugis  Celsi praetereunt austera poemata Ramnes  Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci  Lectorem delectando pariterque monendo  And the Rule which my Lord  Roscomon  has given for  Translations  is certainly more strong for  Originals  Take then a Subject proper to expound  But moral great and worth a Poet's Voice  For Men of Sense despise a trivial Choice  And such Applause it must expect to meet  As would some Painter busy'd in a Street  To copy Bulls and Bears and every Sign  That calls the staring Sots to nasty Wine  Now since 'tis impossible that so judicious an Author as  Boileau  should run counter to his own and to the Instructions of his Master  Horace  the  Lutrin  at the Bottom cannot be an  empty Trifle  'Tis indeed a noble and important satirical Poem upon the Luxury the Pride the Divisions and Animosities of the Popish Clergy 'Tis true indeed the  admirable Address  of the Poet has made it in Appearance a  Trifle  for otherwise it would not have been suffer'd in a bigotted Popish Country But yet  Boileau  in some Places seems to have given broad Hints at what was his real Meaning as in the following Passage  La Deesse en entrant qui voit la nappe mise  Admire un si bel ordre reconnoit l'eglise  Lutrin Chant I  And this other Passage is still more bold  Pour soutenir tes droits que le ciel autorise  Abime tout plutôt c' est l' esprit de l'eglise  Lutrin Chant I  As  the Rape of the Lock  is an  empty Trifle  it can have no  Fable  nor any  Moral  whereas the  Lutrin  has both  Fable  and  Moral  'Tis true indeed the  Allegory  under which that  Moral  is conceal'd is not so perspicuous as  Boileau  would have made it if it had not been for the Apprehension of provoking the  Clergy But on the other Side 'tis not so obscure but that a penetrating Reader may see through it The Moral is  That when Christians and especially the Clergy run into great Heats about religious Trifles their Animosity proceeds from the Want of that Religion which is the Pretence of their Quarrel  The Fable is this  Two Persons being deserted by true Piety are embroil'd about a religious Trifle to the Perplexity and Confusion of them and theirs Upon the Return of Piety they agree to set aside the Trifle about which they differ'd and are reconcil'd to the Quiet and Satisfaction both of themselves and their Partizans  If you will be pleased to compare the Beginning of the Sixth  Canto  with the rest of the Poem you will easily see that this Account which I have given of the  Lutrin  is not without Foundation But you know very well Sir that there is not the least Shadow of a Moral or Fable in the  Rape  As nothing could be more ridiculous than the writing a full an exact and a regular Criticism upon so empty a Business as this trifling Poem I will say but a Word or two concerning the  Incidents  and so have done with what relates immediately to the  Design  The Intention of the Author in writing this Poem as we find in the TitlePage is to raise the Mirth of the Reader and we find by the Effects which  Hudibras  and the  Lutrin  produce  in us that  Butler  and  Boileau  wrote with the same Intention Now you know very well Sir that in a Poem which is built upon an Action Mirth is chiefly to be rais'd by the  Incidents  For Laughter in  Comedy  is chiefly to be excited like Terror and Compassion in Tragedy by Surprize when Things spring from one another against our Expectation Now whereas there are  several  ridiculous Incidents in the  Lutrin  as The Owl in the Pulpit frighting the nocturnal Champions The Prelate's giving his Benediction to his Adversary by way of Revenge and Insult The Battle in the Bookseller's Shop c And whereas there are a thousand such in  Hudibras  There is not so much as  one  nor the  Shadow of one  in the  Rape of the Lock  Unless the Author's Friends will object here That his  perpetual Gravity  after the  Promise  of his Title makes the whole Poem one continued  Jest  I am Your's c  LETTER III  SIR  May  I COME now to the  Characters  and the  Machines  The Characters in the  Lutrin  are well mark'd They are the true Resemblances of Men of active Men who pursue earnestly what they are about But there is no such Thing as a Character in the  Rape of the Lock Belinda  who appears most in it is a Chimera and not a Character She is represented by the Author perfectly  beautiful  and  wellbred    modest  and  virtuous  Let us now see how he sustains these Qualities in her and then we shall discover what Taste he has of  Nature  and of  Decorum  First then he represents her perfectly  beautiful  Sol  thro' white Curtains did his Beams display  And op'd those Eyes which brighter shone than they  And thus in the next Page the Sylphs accost her  Fairest of Mortals thou distinguish'd Care  Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air  And yet in the latter End of this very  Canto  he makes her owe the greater Part of her Beauty to her Toilette  Unnumber'd Treasures ope at once and here  The various Offerings of the World appear  From each she nicely culls with curious Toil  And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring Spoil  This Casket  India  's glowing Gems unlocks  And all  Arabia  breathes from yonder Box  Now awful Beauty puts on all its Arms  The Fair each Moment rises in her Charms  Repairs her Smiles awakens every Grace  And calls forth all the Wonders of her Face  Sees by Degrees a purer Blush arise  And keener Lightnings quicken in her Eyes  Nay the very  favourite Lock  which is made the Subject for so many Verses is not shewn so desirable for its native Beauty as for the constant Artifice employ'd about it Witness what  Thalestris  says to  Belinda  just after she had lost it  Was it for this you took such constant Care  The Bodkin Comb and Essence to prepare  For this your Locks in Paper Durance bound  For this with torturing Irons wreath'd around  For this with Fillets strain'd your tender Head  And bravely bore the double Loads of Lead  Such Artifice must deface the Lustre of Locks which were naturally lovely and the Toilette must of Necessity detract from perfect Beauty The Toilette indeed may add to some who are call'd Beauties or to some who would be thought such A decay'd superannuated Beauty may receive Advantage from her Toilette may  rise  in her Charms and by the Help of  Spanish Red  a  purer Blush may arise  But her  counterfeit Charms  can please none who have a Taste of  Nature  according to that of  Tibullus  Heu serò revocatur amor seròque juventa  Cum vetus infecit cana senecta caput  Tum studium formae est coma tùm mutatur ut annos  Dissimulet viridis cortice tincta nucis  But for her who has Youth and Beauty  Illa placet quamvis inculto venerit ore  Nec nitidum tardâ compserit arte caput  Such a one wants neither  Flounce  nor  Furbelow  nor  torturing Irons  nor  Paper Durance  When God and Nature design a Face to please the Fairone on whom they bestow it can never add to Workmanship Divine She may spoil it indeed by Industry but can never improve it They who made it alone know the certain Ways of going to the Heart of Man and alone can give it those resistless inimitable Graces which Industry does but spoil and which Artifice does but hide  Horace  was as fond of his Mistress's Hair as any modern Lover can be Witness what he says to  Maecenas  in the twelfth Ode of the second Book  Num tu quae tenuit dives Achaemenes  Aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes  Permutare velis crine Licymniae  Plenas aut Arabum Domos  And yet as he and the rest of the antient Poets had an admirable Taste of Nature they had quite another Taste of Beauty than what this Author discovers and believ'd that the brightest Ornament either of the Hair or Face was Simplicity and a becoming Negligence  Cui flavam religas comam  Simplex munditiis  Says  Horace  to  Pyrrha  Ode V Lib  And in the eleventh Ode of  Lib    Quis Devium scortum eliciet domo  Lyden Eburna dic age cum lyrâ  Maturet incomptam Lacenae  More comam religata nodum  Terence  who every where so exactly imitates Nature takes a quite different Course from this Author to shew a touching Beauty The Passage is in the first Act of his  Phormio  Virgo pulchra quo magis diceres  Nil ad erat adjumenti ad pulchritudinem  Capillus passus nudus pes ipsa horrida  Lacrymae vestitus turpis ut ni vis boni  In ipsa inesset formâ haec formam extinguerent  Here was no Care neither of Hair nor Face nor Shape and yet how much more charming does this  Terentian  Virgin appear ev'n in Rags and Misery than  Belinda  does at her Toilette I mean to those who have a Taste of Nature For she who ev'n in this miserable Plight mov'd all Beholders with Pleasure and  Antipho  with Love what might she not justly be suppos'd to do adorn'd with a cleanly Negligence and Simplicity I say  adorn'd  with them for it may truly be said of every accomplish'd Beauty what  Tasso  says of one of his  Di natura d' amor del cielo amici  Le negligenze sue sono artifici  And our Ladies who spend so much Time at their Toilettes would do well to consider that after all the Pains which they take in adorning themselves they who are most charm'd with their Persons endeavour to retrieve their natural Beauty in Imagination at least by divesting them of their borrow'd Ornaments and cloathing them in the Simplicity of the rural Habit when in their Sonnets they transform them to Shepherdesses  But the Author has not only shewn  Belinda  an accomplish'd  Beauty  he represents her likewise a fine modest  wellbred  Lady  Favours to none to all she Smiles extends  Canto II  And a little below  With graceful Ease and Sweetness void of Pride  And yet in the very next  Canto  she appears an arrant Ramp and a Tomrigg  The Nymph exulting fills with Shouts the Sky  The Walls the Woods and long Canals reply  Must not this be the legitimate Offspring of  Stentor  to make such a Noise as that The Nymph was within Doors and she must set up her Throat at a hellish Rate to make the Woods where by the by there are none and the Canals reply to it Let us turn to the fifth  Canto  and we shall see her there as loud with Anger as she is now with Joy  Restore the Lock  she cries and all around  Restore the Lock  the vaulted Roofs rebound  Not fierce  Othello  in so loud a Strain  Roar'd for the Handkerchief that caus'd his Pain  Well but his Friends will object here that this is an  Hyperbole  and an Hyperbole is design'd to carry us beyond the Truth only that it may make us enter more justly into it and that when  Virgil  says of  Camilla    Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret  Gramina nec teneres cursu laesisset aristas  Vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tu menti  Ferret iter celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas  He means only that  Camilla  was exceeding swift of Foot Why be it so But then by the same Rule must not the Author of the  Rape  mean that  Belinda shouted  and  roar'd  very loud and that in short she made a  diabolick Din  Now is  Shouting  and  Roaring  proper for a wellbred Lady Are they not below the Modesty and the Decency even of those  sonorous  Nymphs of the Flood who haunt the Banks of the vocal  Thames  between the  Bridge  and the  Tower  Let us look once more upon the last  Canto    p  Is she not a terrible  Termagant  there and the exact Resemblance of  Magnano  's Lady in  Hudibras  See  fierce Belinda  on the Baron flies  With more than usual Lightning in her Eyes  Now meet thy Fate th'  incens'd Virago  cry'd  And drew a deadly Bodkin from her Side  But  Belinda  is not only shewn  beautiful  and  wellbred  she is represented  virtuous  too  Favours to none to all she Smiles extends  And yet in the latter End of the fourth  Canto  she talks like an errant  Suburbian  Oh hadst thou Cruel been content to seize  Hairs  less in Sight  or  any  Hairs but these  Thus Sir has this Author given his fine Lady  Beauty  and  good Breeding    Modesty  and  Virtue  in Words but has in Reality and in Fact made her an  artificial dawbing Jilt    a  Tomrig  a  Virago  and a  Lady of the Lake  There is no other Character in this Poem worth taking Notice of I should now come to the  Machines  in which you might expect to be entertain'd with something more curious and more ridiculous But I have already detain'd you too long and must defer it till the next Opportunity  I am Sir Yours c  LETTER IV  SIR  May  ACcording to the Promise made in my last I am now to treat of the  Machines  in the doing which I shall lie under a great Disadvantage For before I come to those of the  Rape  it is necessary to say something of  Machines  in general of the  Reason  of introducing them of the  Method  us'd by the antient Poets in employing them and of the  Practice  of the greatest and best of the Moderns  'Tis necessary to say something to all these in order to shew the Absurdity of our Author's  Machines  and his utter Ignorance of the Art he pretends to But to treat of all these in as ample a Manner as the Subject deserves would require a Volume And on the other Side it would be extravagant to spend a great deal of Time to so insignificant an End But when I consider that I write to a Gentleman who is perfectly well vers'd in these Matters and who consequently will comprehend a great deal by a little I find to my Comfort that it will be easy to avoid both those Inconveniences of saying a great deal and of saying nothing  The Reasons that first oblig'd those Poets which are call'd Heroic to introduce  Machines  into their  Poems  were  First  To make their  Fable  and their  Action  more instructive For says  Bossu    Lorsque les poetes sont devenus philosophes moraux ils n' ont pas cessé d'etre theologiens Au contraire la morale quils traitent les oblige indispensablement de méler la divinité dans leurs Ouvrages parceque la conoissance la crainte l' amour de Dieu en un mot la piete la religion sont les premiers les plus solides fondements des autres vertus de tout la morale  By introducing Machines into their Fables the Epic Poets shew'd two Things That the great Revolutions in human Affairs are influenc'd  by a particular Providence That the Deity himself promotes the Success of an Action form'd by Virtue and conducted by Prudence But  Secondly  The Heroic Poets introduc'd  Machines  into their Fables in order to make those Fables more  delightful  For the employing  Machines  made the Actions of those Poems  wonderful  now every Thing that is  wonderful  is of course  delightful  Let us see what one of the greatest Masters among the Moderns says to this  Qu' Aenee ses vaisseaux par les ventes ecartez  Soient aux bords Affricains d'un orage emportez  Ce n' est qu' une avanture ordinaire commune  Qu' un coup peu surprenant des traits de la fortune  Mais que Junon constante en son aversion  Poursvive sur les flots les restes d' Ilion  Qu' Eole on sa faveur les chassant d' Italie  Ouvre aux vents mutinez les prisons d Eolie  Que Neptune en couroux s'elevant sur la mer  D'un mot calme les flots mette la paix dans l' air  Deliure les vaisseaux des Syrtes les arrache  C' est la ce qui surprend frappe saisit attache  Sans tous ces ornamens le vers tombe en langueur  La poësie est morte ou rampe sans vigueur  Le poete n'est plus qu'un orateur timide  Qu' un froid historien d'un fable insipide  This says the most judicious M  Despreaux  in his  Art of Poetry  and the four last Lines remind me here of what I have at large discours'd upon other Occasions  viz  That as the Epic Poets by their  Machines  made the  Actions  of their Fables more  wonderful  and more  delightful  as well as more  instructive  they likewise made the  poetical Expression  more  wonderful  and more  delightful  since 'tis from them that they chiefly derive that Greatness of Expression which renders their Works so Divine  I shall now come to the Practice of the antient Poets and the Method which they made use of in introducing their  Machines  in order to render their Poems more  instructive  and more  delightful  They took their  Machines  from the Religion of their Country upon which Account these  Machines  made the stronger Impression and made their Fables and the Actions of them  probable  as well as  wonderful  for nothing was more natural than for those antient Heathens to believe that the Powers which they ador'd were wont to intermeddle in human  Affairs and to promote the Success of those Designs which they favour'd and nothing could be more natural for them than to believe that that Design must prosper which was espous'd by  Jupiter  But this was not all for the  Machines  by making the Actions of their Poems  probable  made them  wonderful  to Men of Sense who never can admire any Thing in Humanity which  Reason  will not let them believe But  The antient Poets made their  Machines  allegorical as well as their human Persons  They oppos'd them to one another  They shew'd a just Subordination among them and a just Proportion between their Functions While one was employ'd about the greatest and the sublimest Things another was not busied about the most trifling and most contemptible  They always made their  Machines  influence the Actions of their Poems and some of those  Machines  endeavour'd to  advance  the Action of their respective Poem and others of them endeavour'd to  retard  it  They made them infinitely more powerful than the human Persons  But Secondly The Practice of the greatest modern Heroic Poets is conformable to that of the antient  They take their  Machines  from the Religion of their Country witness  Milton    Cowley    Tasso  They make them Allegorical  They oppose them to one another  They shew a just Subordination among them and a just Proportion between their Functions  The Author of the  Rape  has run counter to this Practice both of the Antients and Moderns He has not taken his  Machines  from the Religion of his Country not from any Religion nor from Morality His Machines contradict the Doctrines of the Christian Religion contradict all sound Morality there is no allegorical nor sensible Meaning in them and for these Reasons they give no Instruction make no Impression at all upon the Mind of a sensible Reader Instead of making the Action wonderful and delightful they render it extravagant absurd and incredible They do not in the least influence that Action they neither prevent the Danger of  Belinda  nor promote it nor retard it unless perhaps it may be said for one Moment which is ridiculous And if here it be objected that the Author design'd only to  entertain  and  amuse  To that I answer That for that very Reason he ought to have taken the utmost Care to  make his Poem  probable  according to the important Precept of  Horace  Ficta voluptatis causâ sint proxima veris  And that we may be satisfy'd that this Rule is founded in  Reason  and  Nature  we find by constant Experience that any thing that shocks  Probability  is most insufferable in Comedy  There is no Opposition of the  Machines  to one another in this  Rape of the Lock Umbriel  the  Gnome  is not introduc'd till the Action is over and till  Ariel  and the Spirits under him have quitted  Belinda  There is no just  Subordination  among these  Machines  nor any just  Proportion  between their  Functions Ariel  summons them together and talks to them as if he were their Emperor  Ye  Sylphs  and  Sylphids  to your Chief give ear  Fays    Fairies    Genii    Elves  and  Daemons  hear  Ye know the Spheres and various Tasks assign'd  By Laws eternal to th' aerial Kind  Some in the Fields of purest  Aether  play  And bask and whiten in the Blaze of Day  Some guide the Course of wandring Orbs on high  Or roll the Planets thro' the boundless Sky  Or brew fierce Tempests on the watry Main  Or o'er the Glebe distil the kindly Rain  Others on Earth o'er human Race preside  Watch all their Ways and all their Actions guide  Of these the Chief the Care of Nations own  And guard with Arms Divine the  British  Throne  Now Sir give me leave to ask you one Question Did you ever hear before that the Planets were roll'd by the aerial Kind We have heard indeed of Angels and Intelligences who have perform'd these Functions But they are vast glorious Beings of  Celestial  Kind and  Machines  of another System Pray which of the  aerial  Kind have these  sublime  Employments For nothing can be more ridiculous or more contemptible than the Employments of those whom he harangues  To save the Powder from too rude a Gale  Nor let th' imprison'd Essences exhale  There is a Difference almost infinite between these vile Functions and the former sublime ones and therefore they can never belong to Beings of the same Species Which of the aerial Kinds are the Movers of Orbs on high or the Guardians of Empires below when he who calls himself their Chief is only the Keeper of a vile  Iseland Cur  and has not so  much as the Intendance of the Lady's  Favourite Lock  which is the Subject of the Poem But that is entrusted to an inferior Spirit contrary to all manner of Judgment and Decorum  The  Machines  that appear in this Poem are infinitely less considerable than the  human Persons  which is without Precedent Nothing can be so contemptible as the  Persons  or so foolish as the  Understandings  of these  Hobgoblins Ariel  's Speech for the first thirty Lines is one continu'd Impertinence For if what he says is true he tells them nothing but what they knew as well as himself before And when he comes at length to the  Point  he is full as impertinent as he was in his  Ramble  before for after he has talk'd to them of  black Omens  and  dire Disasters  that threaten his Heroine these Bugbears dwindle to the breaking a Piece of  China  the staining a  Petticoat  the losing a  Necklace  a  Fan  or a Bottle of  Sal Volatile  But we shall consider this Passage further when we come to examine the  Sentiments  and then we shall see that  Sawny  takes the Change here and 'tis  He  a little  Lump of Flesh  that talks instead of a little  Spirit  That which makes this Speech more ridiculous is the Place where it is spoken and that is upon the Sails and Cordage of  Belinda  's Barge which is certainly taken from the two Kings of  Brentford  descending in Clouds and  singing in the Style of our modern Spirits  King  O stay for you need not as yet go astray  The Tide like a Friend has brought Ships in our Way  And on their high Ropes we will play  But now Sir for the  Persons  of these Sylphs and Sylphids you see what Ideas the Threats of  Ariel  give us of them when he threatens them that for their Neglect they shall  Be stopt in Viols or transfix'd with Pins  Or plung'd in Lakes of bitter Washes lie  Or wedg'd whole Ages in a Bodkin's Eye  Discord  is describ'd by  Homer  with her Feet upon the Earth and Head in the Skies Upon which  Longinus  cries out That this is not so much the Measure of  Discord  as of  Homer  's  Capacity  and  Elevation  of  Genius  Ev'n so these  diminutive Beings  of the intellectual World may be said to be the  Measure  of Mr  Pope  's  Capacity  and  Elevation  of Genius They are indeed Beings so  diminutive  that they bear the same Proportion to the rest of the intellectual that Eels in Vinegar do to the rest of the material World The latter are only to be seen thro'  Microscopes  and the former only thro' the false Optics of a  Rosycrucian  Understanding  I shall mention but one or two more of the numerous Defects which are to be found in the  Machines  of this Poem the one is The Spirits which he intends for  benign  ones are  malignant  and those which he designs for  malignant  are  beneficent  to Mankind The  Gnomes  he intends for  malignant  and the  Sylphs  for  beneficent  Spirits Now the  Sylphs  in this Poem promote that  Female Vanity  which the  Gnomes  mortify And Vanity is not only a great Defect in Human Nature but the Mother of a thousand Errors and a thousand Crimes and the Cause of most of the Misfortunes which are incident to Humanity  The last Defect that I shall take notice of is That the  Machines  in this Poem are not taken from  one System  but are  double  nay  treble  or  quadruple  In the first  Canto  we hear of nothing but  Sylphs  and  Gnomes  and  Salamanders  which are  Rosycrucian  Visions In the second we meet with  Fairies    Genii  and  Daemons  Beings which are unknown to those Fanatick Sophisters In the fourth  Spleen  and the  Phantoms  about are deriv'd from the Powers of  Nature  and are of a separate System And  Fate  and  Jove  which we find in the fifth  Canto  belong to the Heathen Religion  But now Sir in treating of these Matters I have before I perceiv'd it transgress'd the  Bounds which I prescrib'd to my self which I desire that you would excuse  I am SIR Yours c  LETTER V  SIR  I HAVE now shewn that there is no such Thing as a  Fable  or  Characters  in the Poem of the  Rape  and that what he calls his  Machinery  is most extravagantly chosen I now come to the  Sentiments  which are more absurd than the rest and of such an odd Composition that they are at one and the same Time both  trivial  and  extravagant  The Absurdity of the  Sentiments  begins with the Book and the Author stumbles at the Threshold  What dire Offence from amorous Causes springs  What mighty Quarrels rise from trivial Things  I singThis Verse to  C  Muse is due  Where in three Lines there are no less than two Errors in the  Sentiments  For in the first Place tho' the Author has neither  Fable  nor  general Action  yet he proposes to sing something  general  rather than that  particular Action  which is the  Subject  of his Poem and he begins as if he design'd to make the Reader expect a  Treatise  of LoveQuarrels which Proceeding is just contrary to the Practice of  Homer  and  Virgil  and to the Dictates of  right Reason Homer  and  Virgil  had  accomplish'd Fables  and their  Actions  at the Bottom were  universal  and  allegorical  Yet they each of them propos'd to sing these  Actions  as they had  particulariz'd  them by the Imposition of Names  Homer  begins thus  Muse sing the baleful Fury of  Achilles  And  Virgil  thus  Arma virumque cano Trojae qui primus ab oris  Italiam fato profugus Lavinaque venit  Littora  In the third Line he does not invoke the Muse to sing but proposes to do it himself And tho' he names the Muse immediately afterwards he does it forsooth to acquaint her that 'tis not she but  Belinda  that is to inspire him  This Verse to  C  Muse is due  This ev'n  Belinda  may vouchsafe to view  Slight is the Subject but not so the Praise  If she inspire and He approve my Lays  So that he has desir'd no Assistance from the  Muse  and none she has afforded him  The  Muse  indeed could not possibly assist him in this Case The  Muse  is a Machine like  Fate  and  Jove  belonging originally to the  Ethnic  System and transferr'd sometimes to the Christian Religion only allegorically and the  Muse  cannot be suppos'd to bring him acquainted with  Rosycrucian  Spirits which would destroy her own Divinity either as Heathen or Christian since they are Beings utterly unknown either to the  Ethnic  System or to the Christian Religion So that 'tis  Belinda  and not the  Muse  that is to inspire him He introduces  her  into the Acquaintance of the  Sylphs  and  Sylphids  in his Epistle and she is to bring  him  acquainted with them in the Body of the Book And now Sir is not this very  ingeniously  and very  judiciously  contriv'd He has desir'd no Assistance from the  Muse  and as I said before none he has had from her The whole Poem seems to have been infus'd by a  Coquette  and not inspir'd by a  Muse  I have already acquainted you Sir that I would not in the  Examen  of this Poem confine my self to an exact and regular Method For neither is the Subject worth the while nor  ought a Letter to a Friend to be writ with any Restraint I shall therefore take the  Sentiments  of this Poem as they come in my way without pretending to rank them under their respective Classes excepting perhaps the  Puns  which are numerous and by which the Author frequently shocks not only the Dictates of  Good Sense  and the Rules of  true Pleasantry  but those of  Grammar  and  common English  But those we shall omit till we have done with the rest  There is in this first  Canto    pag  a very unlucky Imitation of a Passage in the sixth Book of  Virgil  Quae gratia currûm  Armorumque fuit vivis quae cura nitentes  Pascere equos eadem sequitur tellure repostos  Which the Author of the  Rape  has thus imitated  Think not when Woman's transient Breath is fled  That all her Vanities at once are dead  Succeeding Vanities she still regards  And tho' she plays no more o'erlooks the Cards  Her Joy in gilded Chariots when alive  And Love of Ombre after Death survive  Now there is this remarkable Difference between these two Passages that what  Virgil  says of the Souls in the  Elysian  Fields that they were pleas'd with the same Diversions after Death of which they were fond in their Lifetimes does by no means contradict any Doctrine of that Religion which the  Romans  deriv'd from the  Grecians  but the Passage in the  Rape  shocks the fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Religion and is therefore a most absurd Imitation  I have already shewn in speaking of the  Characters  how injudicious all that Passage is in the th and th Pages which relates to the Toilette And as I do not pretend to shew all his Errors but only some few which are very gross ones I shall now pass to the second  Canto  in which  Canto  pag there is a Remark that cannot but be the Effect of very  wise  and very  deep  Observation  With hairy Springes we the Birds betray  Slight Lines of Hair surprize the finny Prey  Fair Tresses Man's impertal Race insnare  And Beauty draws us with a single Hair  That is to say  Birds  are caught by the  Heels  and  Fish  by the  Jaws  with  HorseHair  and  Men  are hamper'd by the  Souls  with  Woman's Hair  Tell me truly Sir is not this the Effect of very  wise  and very  deep  Observation I have been so taken with these four Verses that I could not forbear making the four following in Imitation of them  With jingling Bells NightFowlers Birds betray  With these NightAnglers catch the finny Prey  Small Poets hamper Fools by jingling Rhimes  And Nonsense draws them by its senseless Chimes  In this second  Canto    pag  we have another Imitation of  Virgil  and one ten times more unhappy than the former in the first  Canto  The Passage of  Virgil  is in the second Book of the  Aeneis  Dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirit  That is to say If a Captain obtains a Victory few enquire whether he ow'd it to Stratagem or open Force  The Imitation is included in the following Lines  Th' adventurous Baron the bright Lock admir'd  He saw he wish'd and to the Prize aspir'd  Resolv'd to win he meditates the Way  By Force to ravish or by Fraud betray  For when Success a Lover's Toil attends  Few ask if Fraud or Force attain'd his Ends  Now the Mischief of it is that if a Lover obtains his Ends by  Force  the whole Country makes a very severe Enquiry into it by their  Representative a  petty Jury  and if he happens to be convicted of it in that Case poor Culprit passes his Time but scurvily  In the Letter which I lately sent you concerning the  Characters  I mention'd several of the  Sentiments  which are to be found in  Ariel  's Speech But I know not how I omitted that which follows  To fifty chosen Sylphs of special Note  We trust th' important Charge the Petticoat  Oft have we known that sevenfold Fence to fail  Though stiff with Hoops and arm'd with Ribs of Whale  Where Sir 'tis easy to observe that as 'tis  Belinda  's Petticoat of which he commits the important Charge to the Sylphs 'tis the Petticoat of the same  Belinda  according to all  English  Meaning and all true grammatical Construction that he has known so often to fail in spight of the Hoops of Whalebone And now I leave you to judge if there was not Reason for telling Mrs  Arabella  in the Epistle that Madam  Belinda  was not like her  There seems indeed to be a  terrible Shock  made upon the same Petticoat in the Beginning of the fifth  Canto    pag    All side in Parties and begin th' Attack  Fans clap Silks rattle and tough Whalebones crack  By  tough Whalebones  he cannot mean those of the  Fans  for they are  limber  enough Besides  Fans  were mention'd in the Beginning of this last Verse The  tough Whalebones  then at he latter End of it are those of the  Petticoat  and could not possibly be heard to  crack  unless a  violent Attack  had been made upon it  At the Bottom of  Pag    Canto  III there is a very notable Thought  Coffee which makes the Politician wise  And see through all Things with his halfshut Eyes  Sent up in Vapours to the Baron's Brain  New Stratagems the radiant Lock to gain  Now what was this  new Stratagem  or these  new Stratagems  Why the Baron comes  behind Belinda  as she was drinking her Coffee and snap off goes the  Lock  Now if this was the  new Stratagem  what in the Name of  Impertinence  could be the  old one  But the  profoundest  and  wisest  Reflections of all are at the End of this third  Canto  What Time would spare from Steel receives its Date  And Monuments like Men submit to Fate  Steel did the Labour of the Gods destroy  And strike to Dust th' imperial Tow'rs of  Troy  ▪  Steel could the Works of mortal Pride confound  And hew triumphal Arches to the Ground  What Wonder then fair Nymph thy Hair should feel  The conquering Force of unresisting Steel  Why who the Devil besides this Bard ever made a Wonder of it What before  Troy  Town and triumphal Arches were built was the cutting off a Lock of Hair a  miraculous  Thing But we may very properly apply what he says of Steel and the cutting off a Lock of Hair to  Fire  and the burning of a  Faggot  What Time would spare from  Fire  receives its Date  And lofty Piles like Men submit to Fate  Fire  did the Work of Demi Gods consume  And laid in Dust th' imperial Tow'rs of  Rome    Fire  could the Works of mortal Pride confound  And level this proud City with the Ground  To  Fire  a Victim sacred  Paul  's could fall  And eke the regal Turrets of  Whitehall    What Wonder one poor  Faggot  should expire  By the resistless Force of conqu'ring  Fire  But Sir I have once more unawares transgress'd the Bounds prescrib'd to my self and am  Yours c  LETTER VI  SIR  THE Complaint which you make of my long Silence and the Interruption of this  weighty  Affair seems to be a Return to that Compliment which I design'd to make you by discontinuing my Observations upon these arrant  Bawbles  It was in Complaisance to you that I began to make them and it was out of Respect to your Judgment that I left them off They began to run into Length and I thought I might as reasonably entertain you with voluminous Remarks upon  Mites  in  Cheese  or upon  Eels  in  Vinegar  as with tedious Observations on Mr  Pope  's Poems  But since 'tis your Desire that I should make an end of what I have begun I am resolv'd to comply with it as far as my Indisposition and my Affairs and the Satiety which I have contracted in saying so much already will permit me For the Difficulty here does not lie in  making Remarks  but in  Reading  The Faults are so gross and so numerous that there is no more Pleasure in finding them than there is in hunting in a HareWarren  I am now come to the  Sentiments  which are to be found in the fourth and fifth  Cantos  of this notable Poem I shall only take notice of a very few by which you and your Friends may judge of the whole  The first Thing I shall take notice of is the impertinent Journey of  Umbriel  the  Gnome  who  Down to the central Earth his proper Scene  Repairs to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen  Pag  Now to what Purpose does this fantastick Being take this Journey Why to give  Belinda  the Spleen In order to which  Spleen  equips him with a  Bottle  and a  Bag  as a Country Dame does her  PloughJobber  to equip him for his Day's Work  A wondrous Bag with both her Hands she binds  Like that where once  Ulysses  held the Winds  There she collects the Force of female Lungs  Sighs Sobs and Passions and the War of Tongues  A Viol next she fills with fainting Fears  Soft Sorrows melting Griefs and flowing Tears  Now what could be more impertinent than this Journey of  Umbriel  or more vain and  useless than this Gift of  Spleen  whether we look upon the  Bag  or the  Bottle  Umbriel  descends to the  central Earth  to give  Belinda  the  Spleen  Now 'tis plain that before his Descent he leaves her  mad  and upon his Return finds her in a  Fit of the Mother  That before his Journey he leaves her  mad  is I think pretty plain from  pag    Then flash'd the livid Lightning from her Eyes  And  Screams  of  Horror  rend th'  affrighted  Skies  Not  louder Shrieks  by Dames to Heaven are cast  That upon his Return he finds her in a  Fit of the Mother  is manifest from  p    Sunk in  Thalestris  ' Arms the Nymph he found  Her Eyes dejected and her Hair unbound  How absurd was it then for this  Ignis Fatuus  to take a Journey down to the  central Earth  for no other Purpose than to give her the  Spleen  whom he left and found in the Height of it And why does this impertinent Devil who  sees  this give himself the Trouble which he takes in the following Lines  Full o'er their Heads the swelling Bag he rent  And all the Furies issu'd at the Vent  Belinda  burns with more than mortal Ire  Ibid  Now pray what were the  Furies  enclos'd in this Bag Why we were told what they were a little higher  viz  the  Force  of  female Lungs  and  Bedlam Passions  and the  War  of  Tongues  Now could  Belinda  have more of those than she had before the  Gnome  took his Journey  Then flash'd the livid Lightning from her Eyes  And Screams of Horror rend th' affrighted Skies  And as for the  Bottle  that seems like  Trinca lo  's rather to  comfort  her than to  ferment  her more For let us but consider the Condition in which  Umbriel  found her upon his Return  Sunk in  Thalestris  ' Arms the Nymph he found  Her Eyes dejected and her Hair unbound  That is to say she was  stark mad  Now let us compare this Condition with that in which she appears after she has a  Dram  of the  Bottle  But  Umbriel  hateful Gnome forbears not so  He breaks the Viol whence the Sorrows flow  Now pray what is the Consequence Why  Belinda  of a sudden comes to herself holds up  her Head and is calm enough to make Reflections  The next Thing I shall take notice of is the  Equipage  of  Spleen  and this Author's giving her  two Handmaids  the one of which ought rather to be her  Mother  than her  Maid  and the other can have nothing at all to do with her  Two Handmaids wait the Throne alike in Place  But diff'ring far in Figure and in Face  Here stood IllNature  like an  antient  Maid    Here the Author with a great deal of Judgment makes a  Universal  subordinate to a  Particular IllNature  may with some Colour be said to be the  Mother  of  Spleen  but she can never be call'd her  Maid  without shocking common Sense The  Nature  of a Man must be  coeval  to the  Man  and must far  precede  any Thing that the World calls  Spleen  in him But let us take a View of her other Handmaid  pag    There  Affectation  with a sickly Mien  Shews in her Cheeks the Roses of eighteen  Now  Affectation  can never have any Thing to do with  Spleen Spleen  is the  Mother  of  Passion  which is  Nature    Affectation  is the  Child  of  Tranquillity  and for the most part is nothing but  counterfeit Passion  Now he who has violent Passions of his  own  is hardly  at leisure to counterfeit those which are  foreign  to him and therefore it has been often seen that when too much  Felicity  has made a Fop  affected    Spleen  and  Adversity  have brought him back to  Nature  I will not take notice of the various Errors in the Description of what he calls the  Palace of Spleen  I shall content myself with the Mention of one of them which may not improperly be call'd the  impossible Transformation  Unnumber'd Throngs on ev'ry Side are seen  Of Bodies chang'd to various Forms by Spleen  Here living Teapots stand one Arm held out  One bent the Handle this and that the Spout  A Pipkin there like  Homer  's Tripod walks  Here sighs a Jar and there a Goosepie talks  Men prove with Child as pow'rful Fancy works  And Maids turn'd Bottles call aloud for Corks  Now Sir I appeal to you and your Friends if ever there was such execrable Stuff such lamentable such deplorable Pleasantry What says  Horace  Scribendi rectè sapere est principium sons  Good Sense is the sole Foundation of good Writing  And according to him  Boileau    Quelque sujet qu' on traite ou plaisant ou sublime  Que toujours le bon sens s'accorde avec le rime  Good Sense is the only Foundation both of Pleasantry and Sublimity  But that which is out of  Truth  is certainly out of  Nature  and  Good Sense  Now was ever any Thing more out of  Truth  than the foregoing Description Instead of giving  Spleen  a Power to bring  melancholy Delusions  upon Mortals and to cheat them with  false Appearances  this Author gives her the Power really to  transform Bodies  and makes  Umbriel  the  Gnome  who as a Spirit is suppos'd to see Things as they are  actually  and  really  to behold that  extravagant Transformation  But so much for the Sentiments of the fourth  Canto  As the fifth is very short and very insipid and as your humble Servant is very much tir'd I shall make but two Observations upon it  In the Beginning of it there is a  rampant Scuffle  which I suppose our Author took from the  Rankness  of a  ButtockBall  so little is it becoming of Persons of Condition  All side in Parties and begin th' Attack  Fans clap Silks rustle and tough Whalebones crack  Heroes and Heroines Shouts confus'dly rise  And bass and treble Voices strike the Skies  No common Weapons in their Hands are found  Like Gods they fight nor dread a mortal Wound  The latter Part is something odd in the Mouth of the Translator of  Homer  who ought to know that both  Mars  and  Venus  had been wounded by  Diomedes  But if no  common Weapons  are found in the Hands of these Combatants pray what Weapons are they which make the  Silks to rustle  and the  Whalebones to crack  But let us consider what follows  So when bold  Homer  makes the Gods engage  And heavenly Breasts with human Passions rage  '  Gainst  Pallas Mars Latona Hermes  arms    And all  Olympus  rings with loud Alarms  Jove  's Thunder roars Heav'n trembles all around  Blue  Neptune  storms the bellowing Deeps resound  Earth shakes her nodding Tow'rs the Ground gives way  And the pale Ghosts start at the Flash of Day  Now Sir who says that this Passage is not very justly applied to a  Catterwauling  But the latter Part of it is not taken from  Homer  but from his most impertinent Imitator Monsieur  De la Motte  and neither the one nor the other Trifler seem to have known any thing in this Passage of the Solemnity and the dreadful Majesty of  Homer  In the Beginning of the next Page the following Lines are full of miserable Pleasantry  While thro' the Press enrag'd  Thalestris  flies  And scatters Death around from both her Eyes  A Beau and Witling perish'd in the Throng  One died in Metaphor and one in Song  O cruel Nymph a living Death I bear  Cry'd  Dapperwit  and sunk beneath his Chair  A mournful Glance Sir  Fopling  upwards cast  Those Eyes are made so killingwas his last  So that here we have a  real Combat  and a  metaphorical dying  Now is not that Sir very ludicrous What did he fight or make Love as Professors read or as Popes fulminate  ex Cathedrâ  I cannot imagine how he could do that unless he had got  Belinda  or  Thalestris  upon his Lap  Thus Sir have I gone thro' several of the  Sentiments  upon the  Rape  which are either  trifling  or  false  But there are a great many Lines which have  no Sentiment  at all in them that is no  reasonable Meaning  Such are the  Puns  which are every where spread throughout it  Puns  bear the same Proportion to  Thought  that  Bubbles  hold to  Bodies  and may justly be compared to those gaudy Bladders which Children make with Soap which tho' they please their weak Capacities with a momentary Glittering yet are but just beheld and vanish into Air Of this Nature is that Pun in the  th Canto    p    See fierce  Belinda  on the Baron flies  With more than usual Lightning in her Eyes  Nor fears the Chief th' unequal Fight to try  Who sought no more than  on  his Foe to die  That is to say  He wish'd for nothing more than to fight with her because he desired nothing more than to lie with her  Now what sensible Meaning can this have unless he takes her for a  Russian  who is to grow passionately fond of him by the extraordinary Gallantry of a lusty Bastinado Such likewise is that  Quibble  in the following Page  Boast not my Fall he cry'd Insulting Foe  Thou by some others shalt be laid as low  Now we heard nothing before of the Baron's lying low All that we heard is that by a dextrous Toss of this  modest Virgin  his Nostrils were fill'd with Snuff So that he seems here to say the same thing to her that  Nykin  says to  Cocky  in the  Old Batchelor    I have it in my Head but you will have it in another Place  What follows seems to be very extraordinary  Nor think to die dejects my lofty Mind  All that I dread is leaving you behind  Rather than so ah let me still survive  And burn in  Cupid  's Flames but burn alive  Now Sir who ever heard of a dead Man that burnt in  Cupid  's Flames  Of the same Nature are those numerous Banters in Rhyme which are to be found throughout this Poem which are so uniform and so much of a piece that one would swear the Author were giving a Receipt for dry Joking For by placing something important in the Beginning of a Period and making something very trifling follow it he seems to take pains to bring  something  into a Conjunction Copulative with  nothing  in order to beget  nothing  Of this there are divers Instances in  Ariel  's Speech in the  d Canto    This Day black Omens threat the brightest Fair  That e'er deserv'd the watchfull'st Spirit's Care  Some dire Disaster or by Force or Sleight  But what or where the Fates have wrapt in Night  Whether the Nymph shall break  Diana  's Law  Or some frail  China  Jar receive a Flaw  Or stain her Honour or her new Brocade  Forget her Pray'rs or miss a Masquerade  Or lose her Heart or Necklace at a Ball  Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that  Shock  must fall  Which by the way I suppose is design'd as a bitter Bob for the  Predestinarians  Raillery apart we pretend not to deny that the very minutest Events are foredoom'd by eternal Prescience but that Heave  should give notice of the Death of a vile Dog by what he calls black Omens is a great deal too strong Heaven could do no more for  Caesar  himself the  very Top of the human Creation and the Foremost Man of the Universe  But now Sir give me leave to ask you one Question Is  Ariel  in Jest or in Earnest in haranguing the Spirits at this rate Is he in Earnest Why then even  Robin Goodfellow  himself is not a more senseless insignificant Hobgoblin Is he in Jest Why then all this is a very grand Impertinence since it does not so much as aim at any thing For how can the Spirits be any ways influenced by these dry Jokes of their Leader  Of the same Stamp and the same Contrivance are these Lines in the Beginning of the  d Canto    Here  Britain  's Statesmen oft the Fall foredoom  Of foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home  Here Thou great  Anna  whom three Realms obey  Dost sometimes Council take and sometimes Tea  One speaks the Glory of the  British  Queen  And one describes a charming  Indian  Screen  As I said above Sir is not here a Receipt for dry Joking and can any thing be more easy than to be a Wit at this rate  But so much for the  Sentiments  in this  Rape of the Lock  I should now come to the  Expression  But I have already transgress'd the Bounds I prescribed to myself and 'tis Time to take Pity of myself and you I am Sir  Yours c  LETTER VII  SIR  THO' I am heartily tired with what I have already sent you and am really ashamed of having pass'd a Week in thinking on such an empty jingling Trifle as the  Rape of the Lock  a wretched Rhapsody writ for the Amusement of Boys and Men like Boys and tho' I am both very much indisposed at present and very busy yet since I have received your Commands to send you some Remarks upon the  Expressions  in that Bawble in order to compleat the Conversion of Mrs  S  I will in Obedience to those Commands do myself a little more Violence and will do it in as short a Time and as small a Compass as I can for I will confine myself to the first twelve Lines that by the numerous Faults which will be seen in them any one to whom you may happen to shew this Letter may be able to judge of the rest  This Rhapsody begins with Absurdity  What dire Offence from amorous Causes springs  What mighty Contests rise from trivial things  I singThis Verse to  C  Muse is due  This ev'n  Belinda  may vouchsafe to view  Slight is the Subject but not so the Praise  If she inspire and he approve my Lays  The two first of these Lines and the Beginning of the third are out of all Grammatical Construction For here the Verb Active  sing  has no Accusative Case depending on it as the Nominative Case is without a Verb in the Beginning of the Prologue to  Cato  which Prologue was writ by the same little whimsical Gentleman  The Word  Muse  is a mere Expletive and can have nothing to do here since 'tis  Belinda  only that is to inspire him  There are no less than six Faults in the six Lines which he calls his Invocation  Say what strange Motive Goddess cou'd compel  A wellbred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle  O say what stranger Cause yet unexplor'd  Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord  And dwells such Rage in softest Bosoms then  And dwells such daring Souls in little Men  Now all this if it were not for the Rhyme would appear even to Fools as well as to Men of Sense the poorest and most contemptible Stuff that ever laid the gentle Reader asleep I would fain know what the Word  Goddess  in the first Line  the Muse or  Belinda Goddess  by the usual Signification of the Word relates to  Muse  but according to Grammar and Construction it relates to  Belinda  because she was mention'd last and she is the inspiring Person The Word  compel  in the first Line likewise is a Botch for the sake of the Rhyme the Word that should naturally have been used  was either  induce  or  provoke  The Word  compel  supposes the Baron to be a Beast and not a free Agent Now Sir what a pretty Sense these two first Lines make  Say what strange Motive Goddess cou'd compel  A wellbred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle  That is what could  force  a  wellbred  Man to be damnably rude and to shew himself an errant Clown and a Brute As for the Terms  gentle Belle  they are too affected too weak and too low and by no means come up to what is said to  Belinda  in the very next Page by  Ariel  the Sylph  Fairest of Mortals thou distinguish'd Care  Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air  For  Belle  and  Beau  as we have made them as it were  English  Substantives do not signify so much as Beautiful tho' as they are  French  Adjectives they have that Signification No Man when he calls another  Beau  means that that other is handsome but only that he takes a great deal of Poppish Care about his Dress and gives himself a great many fantastick Airs in order to please superficial People and render himself ridiculous to Men of Sense  Belle  has much the same Signification and according to the present Use and Acceptation of the Word no more signifies a beautiful Woman than  Coquette  does but only one that takes a great deal of fruitless Pains to make herself  more agreeable than God and Nature have made her But let us go on to the next Couplet  Oh say what stranger Cause yet unexplor'd  Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord  The Cause was because she did not like him a strange Cause indeed and which required a great deal of Sagacity to find it out But to what Purpose is the Word  reject Belinda  granted him every thing that he ask'd of her He desired to wait upon her to  HamptonCourt  and she granted it He desired her to make one at  Ombre  and she complied with that Request likewise If she granted no more it was because he ask'd no more For if we may believe herself by what she says at the Beginning of the  fourth Canto  she would have refused him nothing unless it was her  favourite Lock  Oh hadst thou cruel been content to seize  Hairs less in Sight or any Hairs but these  For she who seems inclin'd to sacrifice her Modesty to her Vanity would in all likelihood have sacrificed it to her Pleasure In short the Baron is so far from making Love in this Rhapsody that he plainly shews by the rude Affront which he puts upon  Belinda  that he expected no particular Favour from her And indeed this Party of Pleasure at  HamptonCourt  seems to me to look more like Catterwauling than the Behaviour of Persons who went thither  with any amorous Design But let us proceed to the next Couplet  And dwells such Rage in softest Bosoms then  Yes most certainly does it and if this little Gentleman had not had a Head more soft than  Belinda  's Bosom he could never have been capable of asking so simple a Question The softer Sex are much more subject to violent Passions than Men  Virgil  shewed a Softness in  Dido  which this little Gentleman is utterly incapable of comprehending a Softness which obliged a Sovereign Queen whose Understanding was equal to her Supreme Power or to her Greatness of Mind to grant the last Favour to the  Trojan  Hero and yet that Softness was immediately succeeded by a Rage to whose Force and whose noble Enthusiasm this little Creature who is as diminutive an Author as he is an Animal is as utterly incapable of raising himself as an earthly Vapour is of ascending to Heaven But tho' nothing is more plain than that  Rage  may dwell in  softest Bosoms  yet had it no more to do here than  reject  and indeed had the less to do here because of  reject  For cannot a Lady deny a Gentleman who makes a civil Request to her but she must sall immediately into as raving a Fit as she could have done if he had extorted the Favour from her  Reject  shews  Contempt  rather than  Rage  It shews that she did not esteem the Baron enough to be at all angry with him But let us come to the second Line of the Couplet  And dwells such daring Souls in little Men  Yes certainly  daring Souls  dwell often in  little Men  and for that very Reason because they are  little Men  Did he never hear of what  Statius  says of little  Tydeus  totosque infusa per artus  Major in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus  I myself know a little Monster who I dare venture to prophesy will one Day shew as  daring  a Soul as a mad  Indian  who runs a muck But what Occasion is there for  daring Souls  here The Baron shews a good deal of  Brutality  and a good deal of  Perfidy  but no  Daring  He shew'd a great deal of  Courage  indeed in coming treacherously behind a Lady and cutting off her favourite Lock  But all this Piece is like  Windsor Forest  or the  Temple of Fame  below Criticism and therefore I take my Leave of you It would be unreasonable to expect that you should read Remarks with Pleasure which I write with Pain Remarks which may be made by the most ordinary Reader without any Penetration or any Sagacity Besides I have given a sufficient Sample to enable Mrs  S  to judge of the rest For as a Lion is known by his Claws an Ass is known by his Ears  I am c  FINIS
