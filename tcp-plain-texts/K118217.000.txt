 The BASTARD A POEM  BY Mr  RICHARD SAVAGE  THE BASTARD A POEM Inscribed with all due Reverence to Mrs  BRET  once  Countess  of MACCLESFIELD  By RICHARD SAVAGE  Son of the late Earl RIVERS  Decet  haec  dare dona Novercam  OV MET  DUBLIN  Printed by S POWELL for T BENSON at  Shakespear  's  Head  in  Castlestreet  and P CRAMPTON at  Addison  's  Head  opposite to the  Horseguard  in  Dame  's  street    The PREFACE  THE Reader will easily perceive these Verses were begun when my Heart was gayer than it has been of late and finish'd in Hours of the deepest Melancholy  I hope the World will do me the Justice to believe that no part of this flows from any  real Anger  against the  Lady  to whom it is inscrib'd Whatever undeserv'd Severities I may have receiv'd at her Hands wou'd she deal so candidly as to acknowledge Truth she very well knows by an Experience of many Years that I have ever behaved myself towards her like one who thought it his Duty to support with Patience all Afflictions from that Quarter Indeed if I had not been capable of  forgiving  a  Mother  I must have blush'd to receive Pardon  myself  at the Hands of my  Sovereign  Neither to say Truth were the manner of my Birth  All  shou'd I have any Reason from complaintwhen I am a little disposed to a gay turn of Thinking I consider as I was a  Derelict  from my Cradle I have the Honour of a  lawful Claim  to the best Protection in  Europe  For being a  Spot  of  Earth  to which no body  pretends  a  Title  I devolve naturally upon the  KING  as one of the  Rights  of his  Royalty  While I presume to name  his MAJESTY  I look back with Confusion upon the  Mercy  I have lately experienc'd because it is impossible to  remember  it but  with  something I would fain  forget  for the sake of my future Peace and Alleviation of my past Misfortune  I owe my Life to the  Royal Pity  if a Wretch can with Propriety be said to  live  whose Days are fewer than his Sorrows and to whom  Death  had been but a  Redemption  from  Misery  But I will  suffer  my  Pardon  as my  Punishment  till that Life which has so graciously been given me shall become considerable enough  not to be useless  in his Service to whom it was forfeited  Under Influence of these Sentiments with which his  MAJESTY's  great Goodness has inspired me I consider my Loss of Fortune and Dignity as my Happiness to which as I was born without Ambition I am thrown from them without repiningPossessing those Advantages my Care had been perhaps but how to  enjoy  Life by the want of them I am taught this nobler Lesson to study how to  deserve  it  R Savage  The BASTARD A POEM  IN Gayer Hours when high my Fancy run  The Muse exulting thus her Lay begun  BLEST be the  Bastard  's Birth thro' wond'rous Ways  He shines excentric like a Comet's Blaze  No sickly Fruit of faint Compliance He  He stampt in Nature's Mint of Extacy  He lives to build not boast a generous Rac  No tenth Transmitter of a foolish Face  His daring Hope no Sire's Example bounds  His firstborn Lights no Prejudice con+founds  He kindling from within requires no Flame  He glories in a  Bastard  's glowing Name  BORN to himself by no Possession led  In Freedom foster'd and by Fortune fed  Nor Guides nor Rules his sov'reign Choic  controul  His Body independent as his Soul  Loos'd to the World's wide Rangeen+joyn'd no Aim  Prescrib'd no Duty and assign'd no Name  Nature's unbounded Son he stands alone  His Heart unbyass'd and his Mind his own  O  Mother  yet  no  Mother'tis to you  My Thanks for such distinguish'd Claims are due  You unenslav'd to Nature's narrow Laws  Warm Championess for  Freedom  's sacred Cause  From all the dry Devoirs of Blood and Line  From Ties maternal moral and divine  Discharg'd my grasping Soul push'd me from Shore  And launch'd me into Life without an Oar  WHAT had I lost if conjugally kind  By Nature hating yet by Vows confin'd  Untaught the matrimonial Bounds to slight  And coldly conscious of a Husband's Right  You had  faintdrawn  me with a  Form  alone  A lawful Lump of Life by Force your own  Then while your backward Will retrench'd Desire  And unconcurring Spirits lent no Fire  I had been born your dull domestic  Heir  Load of your Life and Motive of your Care  Perhaps been poorly rich and meanly great  The Slave of Pomp a Cypher in the State  Lordly neglectful of a Worth unknown  And slumb'ring in a  Seat  by chance my own  FAR nobler Blessings wait the  Bastard  's Lot  Conceiv'd in Rapture and with Fire begot  Strong as Necessity he starts away  Climbs against Wrongs and brightens into Day  THUS unprophetic lately misinspir'd  I sung Gay flatt'ring Hope my Fancy fir'd  Inly secure thro' conscious Scorn of Ill  Nor taught by Wisdom how to ballance Will  Rashly deceiv'd I saw no Pits to shun  But thought to  purpose  and to  act  were  one  Heedless what pointed Cares pervert his Way  Whom Caution arms not and whom Woes betray  But now expos'd and shrinking from distress  I flie to Shelter while the Tempests press  My Muse to Grief resigns the varying Tone  The Raptures languish and the Numbers groan  O Memorythou Soul of Joy and Pain  Thou Actor of our Passions o'er again  Why dost thou aggravate the Wretches Woe  Why add continuous Smart to ev'ry Blow  Few are my Joys alas how soon forgot  On that  kind  Quarter thou invad'st me not  While sharp and numberless my Sorrows fall  Yet thou repeat'st and multiply'st 'em all  Is Chance a Guilt that my disast'rous Heart  For Mischief never meant must ever smart  Can Selfdefence be SinAh plead no more  What tho' no purpos'd Malice stain'd thee o'er  Had Heav'n befriended thy unhappy Side  Thou had'st not been provok'dOr  Thou  had'st died  FAR be the Guilt of homeshed Blood from All  On whom unsought embroiling Dangers fall  Still the pale  Dead  revives and lives to me  To me thro'  Pity  's Eye condemn'd to see  Remembrance veils his Rage but swells his Fate  Griev'd I forgive and am grown cool too late  Young and unthoughtful then who knows one Day  What ripening Vertues might have made their Way  He might have liv'd till Folly died in Shame  Till kindling Wisdom felt a Thirst for Fame  He might perhaps his Country's Friend have prov'd  Been happy gen'rous candid and belov'd  He might have sav'd some Worth now doom'd to fall  And I perchance in him have  murder'd  all  O Fate of late Repentance always vain  Thy Remedies but lull undying Pain  Where shall my Hope find RestNo Mother's Care  Shielded my Infant Innocence with Prayer  No Father's Guardian Hand my Youth maintain'd  Call'd forth my Vertues or from Vice restrain'd  Is it not time to snatch some pow'rful Arm  First to advance then screen from future Harm  Am I return'd from Death to live in Pain  Or wou'd  Imperial Pity  save in vain  Distrust it notWhat blame can  Mercy  find  Which gives at once a Life and rears a Mind  MOTHER miscall'd Farewelof Soul severe  This sad Reflection yet may force one Tear  All I was wretched by to you I ow'd  Alone from Strangers ev'ry Comfort flow'd  LOST to the Life  you  gave  Your  Son no more  And now  adopted  who was  doom'd  before  Newborn  I may a nobler Mother Claim  But dare not whisper her Immortal  Name  Supreamly Lovely and Serenely Great  Majestick  Mother  of a kneeling  State  QUEEN of a People's Hearts who ne'er before  AgreedYet now with one Consent  adore  One Contest yet remains in this Desire  Who most shall give Applause where all Admire  FINIS  Books Poems and Plays Printed for and Sold by  P Crampton  at  Addison  's
