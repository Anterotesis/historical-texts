very improper for the solemnity of the subject otherwise the poem is natural and the reflections just  BY the blue taper's trembling light  No more I waste the wakeful night  Intent with endless view to pore  The schoolmen and the sages o'er  Their books from wisdom widely stray  Or point at best the longest way  I'll seek a readier path and go  Where wisdom's surely taught below  How deep yon azure dies the sky  Where orbs of gold unnumber'd lye  While thro' their ranks in silver pride  The nether crescent seems to glide  The slumb'ring breeze forgets to breathe  The lake is smooth and clear beneath  Where once again the spangled show  Descends to meet our eyes below  The grounds which on the right aspire  In dimness from the view retire  The left presents a place of graves  Whose wall the silent water laves  That steeple guides thy doubtful sight  Among the livid gleams of night  There pass with melancholy state  By all the solemn heaps of fate  And think as softlysad you tread  Above the venerable dead  "Time was like thee they life possest  And time shall be that thou shalt rest"  Those graves with bending osier bound  That nameless heave the crumbled ground  Quick to the glancing thought disclose  Where toil and poverty repose  The flat smooth stones that bear a name  The chissel's slender help to fame  Which ere our set of friends decay  Their frequent steps may wear away  A middle race of mortals own  Men half ambitious all unknown  The marble tombs that rise on high  Whose dead in vaulted arches lye  Whose pillars swell with sculptur'd stones  Arms angels epitaphs and bones  These all the poor remains of state  Adorn the rich or praise the great  Who while on earth in fame they live  Are senseless of the fame they give  Ha while I gaze pale Cynthia fades  The bursting earth unveils the shades  All slow and wan and wrap'd with shrouds  They rise in visionary crouds  And all with sober accent cry  "Think mortal what it is to die"  Now from yon black and fun'ral yew  That bathes the charnelhouse with dew  Methinks I hear a voice begin  Ye ravens cease your croaking din  Ye tolling clocks no time resound  O'er the long lake and midnight ground  It sends a peal of hollow groans  Thus speaking from among the bones  "When men my scythe and darts supply  How great a King of Fears am I  They view me like the last of things  They make and then they dread my stings  Fools if you less provok'd your fears  No more my spectreform appears  Death's but a path that must be trod  If man wou'd ever pass to God  A port of calms a state of ease  From the rough rage of swelling seas  Why then thy flowing sable stoles  Deep pending cypress mourning poles  Loose scarfs to fall athwart thy weeds  Long palls drawn herses cover'd steeds  And plumes of black that as they tread  Nod o'er the 'scutcheons of the dead  Nor can the parted body know  Nor wants the soul these forms of woe  As men who long in prison dwell  With lamps that glimmer round the cell  Whene'er their suff'ring years are run  Spring forth to greet the glitt'ring sun  Such joy tho' far transcending sense  Have pious souls at parting hence  On earth and in the body plac'd  A few and evil years they waste  But when their chains are cast aside  See the glad scene unfolding wide  Clap the glad wing and tow'r away  And mingle with the blaze of day  A FAIRY TALE BY DR PARNELL  Never was the old manner of speaking more happily applied or a tale better told than this  IN Britain's isle and Arthur's days  When midnight Fairies daunc'd the maze  Liv'd Edwin of the Green  Edwin I wis a gentle youth  Endow'd with courage sense and truth  Tho' badly shap'd he been  His mountain back mote well be said  To measure height against his head  And lift itself above  Yet spite of all that Nature did  To make his uncouth form forbid  This creature dar'd to love  He felt the charms of Edith's eyes  Nor wanted hope to gain the prize  Cou'd ladies look within  But one Sir Topaz dress'd with art  And if a shape cou'd win a heart  He had a shape to win  Edwin if right I read my song  With slighted passion pac'd along  All in the moony light  'Twas near an old inchanted court  Where sportive fairies made resort  To revel out the night  His heart was drear his hope was cross'd  'Twas late 'twas far the path was lost  That reach'd the neighbourtown  With weary steps he quits the shades  Resolv'd the darkling dome he treads  And drops his limbs adown  But scant he lays him on the floor  When hollow winds remove the door  A trembling rocks the ground  And well I ween to count aright  At once an hundred tapers light  On all the walls around  Now sounding tongues assail his ear  Now sounding feet approachen near  And now the sounds increase  And from the corner where he lay  He sees a train profusely gay  Come prankling o'er the place  But trust me gentles never yet  Was dight a masquing half so neat  Or half so rich before  The country lent the sweet perfumes  The sea the pearl the sky the plumes  The town its silken store  Now whilst he gaz'd a gallant drest  In flaunting robes above the rest  With awful accent cry'd  What mortal of a wretched mind  Whose sighs infect the balmy wind  Has here presum'd to hide  At this the swain whose vent'rous soul  No fears of magic art controul  Advanc'd in open sight  "Nor have I cause of dreed he said  Who view by no presumption led  Your revels of the night  'Twas grief for scorn of faithful love  Which made my steps unweeting rove  Amid the nightly dew"  'Tis well the gallant cries again  We fairies never injure men  Who dare to tell us true  Exalt thy lovedejected heart  Be mine the task or ere we part  To make thee grief resign  Now take the pleasure of thy chaunce  Whilst I with Mab my partner daunce  Be little Mable thine  He spoke and all a sudden there  Light music floats in wanton air  The Monarch leads the Queen  The rest their fairie partners found  And Mable trimly tript the ground  With Edwin of the green  The dauncing past the board was laid  And siker such a feast was made  As heart and lip desire  Withouten hands the dishes fly  The glasses with a wish come nigh  And with a wish retire  But now to please the fairie king  Full ev'ry deal they laugh and sing  And antic feats devise  Some wind and tumble like an ape  And othersome transmute their shape  In Edwin's wond'ring eyes  Till one at last that Robin hight  Renown'd for pinching maids by night  Has hent him up aloof  And full against the beam he slung  Where by the back the youth he hung  To sprawl unneath the roof  From thence "Reverse my charm he crys  And let it fairly now suffice  The gambol has been shown"  But Oberon answers with a smile  Content thee Edwin for a while  The vantage is thine own  Here ended all the phantom play  They smelt the fresh approach of day  And heard a cock to crow  The whirling wind that bore the crowd  Has clapp'd the door and whistled loud  To warn them all to go  Then screaming all at once they fly  And all at once the tapers dye  Poor Edwin falls to floor  Forlorn his state and dark the place  Was never wight in such a case  Thro' all the land before  But soon as dan Apollo rose  Full jolly creature home he goes  He feels his back the less  His honest tongue and steady mind  Had rid him of the lump behind  Which made him want success  With lusty livelyhed he talks  He seems a dauncing as he walks  His story soon took wind  And beauteous Edith sees the youth  Endow'd with courage sense and truth  Without a bunch behind  The story told Sir Topaz mov'd  The youth of Edith erst approv'd  To see the revel scene  At close of eve he leaves his home  And wends to find the ruin'd dome  All on the gloomy plain  As there he bides it so befell  The wind came rustling down a dell  A shaking seiz'd the wall  Up sprung the tapers as before  The fairies bragly foot the floor  And music fills the hall  But certes sorely sunk with woe  Sir Topaz sees the Elphin show  His spirits in him dy  When Oberon crys "A man is near  A mortal passion cleeped sear  Hangs flagging in the sky"  With that Sir Topaz hapless youth  In accents falt'ring ay for ruth  Intreats them pity graunt  For als he been a mister wight  Betray'd by wand'ring in the night  To tread the circled haunt  "Ah Losell vile at once they roar  And little skill'd of fairie lore  Thy cause to come we know  Now has thy kestrell courage fell  And fairies since a lye you tell  Are free to work thee woe"  Then Will who bears the wispy fire  To trail the swains among the mire  The captive upward flung  There like a tortoise in a shop  He dangled from the chambertop  Where whilom Edwin hung  The revel now proceeds apace  Deftly they frisk it o'er the place  They sit they drink and eat  The time with frolic mirth beguile  And poor Sir Topaz hangs the while  Till all the rout retreat  By this the stars began to wink  They shriek they fly the tapers sink  And down ydrops the knight  For never spell by fairie laid  With strong enchantment bound a glade  Beyond the length of night  Chill dark alone adreed he lay  Till up the welkin rose the day  Then deem'd the dole was o'er  But wot ye well his harder lot  His seely back the bunch had got  Which Edwin lost afore  This tale a Sybilnurse ared  She softly stroak'd my youngling head  And when the tale was done  "Thus some are born my son she cries  With base impediments to rise  And some are born with none  But virtue can itself advance  To what the fav'rite fools of chance  By Fortune seem'd design'd  Virtue can gain the odds of fate  And from itself shake off the weight  Upon th' unworthy mind"  PALEMON AND LAVINIA  Mr Thomson though in general a verbose and affected poet has told this story with unusual simplicity it is rather given here for being much esteemed by the public than by the editor  THE lovely young Lavinia once had friends  And Fortune smil'd deceitful on her birth  For in her helpless years depriv'd of all  Of every stay save Innocence and Heaven  She with her widow'd mother feeble old  And poor liv'd in a cottage far retir'd  Among the windings of a woody vale  By solitude and deep surrounding shades  But more by bashful modesty conceal'd  Together thus they shunn'd the cruel scorn  Which virtue sunk to poverty would meet  From giddy passion and lowminded pride  Almost on Nature's common bounty fed  Like the gay birds that sung them to repose  Content and careless of tomorrow's fare  Her form was fresher than the morning rose  When the dew wets its leaves unstain'd and pure  As is the lilly or the mountain snow  The modest virtues mingled in her eyes  Still on the ground dejected darting all  Their humid beams into the blooming flowers  Or when the mournful tale her mother told  Of what her faithless fortune promis'd once  Thrill'd in her thought they like the dewy star  Of evening shone in tears A native grace  Sat fairproportion'd on her polish'd limbs  Veil'd in a simple robe their best attire  Beyond the pomp of dress for loveliness  Needs not the foreign aid of ornament  But is when unadorn'd adorn'd the most  Thoughtless of beauty she was beauty's self  Recluse amid the closeembowering woods  As in the hollow breast of Appenine  Beneath the shelter of encircling hills  A myrtle rises far from human eye  And breathes its balmy fragrance o'er the wild  So flourish'd blooming and unseen by all  The sweet Lavinia till at length compell'd  By strong Necessity's supreme command  With smiling patience in her looks she went  To glean Palemon's fields The pride of swains  Palemon was the generous and the rich  Who led the rural life in all its joy  And elegance such as Arcadian song  Transmits from ancient uncorrupted times  When tyrant custom had not shackled Man  But free to follow Nature was the mode  He then his fancy with autumnal scenes  Amusing chanc'd beside his reapertrain  To walk when poor Lavinia drew his eye  Unconscious of her power and turning quick  With unaffected blushes from his gaze  He saw her charming but he saw not half  The charms her downcast modesty conceal'd  That very moment love and chaste desire  Sprung in his bosom to himself unknown  For still the world prevail'd and its dread laugh  Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn  Should his heart own a gleaner in the field  And thus in secret to his soul he sigh'd  "What pity that so delicate a form  By beauty kindled where enlivening sense  And more than vulgar goodness seem to dwell  Should be devoted to the rude embrace  Of some indecent clown She looks methinks  Of old Acasto's line and to my mind  Recalls that patron of my happy life  From whom my liberal fortune took its rise  Now to the dust gone down his houses lands  And once fairspreading family dissolv'd  'Tis said that in some lone obscure retreat  Urg'd by remembrance sad and decent pride  Far from those scenes which knew their better days  His aged widow and his daughter live  Whom yet my fruitless search could never find  Romantic wish would this the daughter were"  When strict enquiring from herself he found  She was the same the daughter of his friend  Of bountiful Acasto who can speak  The mingled passions that surpris'd his heart  And thro' his nerves in shiv'ring transport ran  Then blaz'd his smother'd flame avow'd and bold  And as he view'd her ardent o'er and o'er  Love gratitude and pity wept at once  Confus'd and frighten'd at his sudden tears  Her rising beauties flush'd a higher bloom  As thus Palemon passionate and just  Pour'd out the pious rapture of his soul  "And art thou then Acasto's dear remains  She whom my restless gratitude has sought  So long in vain O heavens the very same  The softened image of my noble friend  Alive his every look his every feature  More elegantly touch'd Sweeter than Spring  Thou sole surviving blossom from the root  That nourish'd up my fortune Say ah where  In what sequester'd desart hast thou drawn  The kindest aspect of delighted Heaven  Into such beauty spread and blown so fair  Tho' Poverty's cold wind and crushing rain  Beat keen and heavy on thy tender years  O let me now into a richer soil  Transplant thee safe where vernal suns and showers  Diffuse their warmest largest influence  And of my garden be the pride and joy  Ill it befits thee oh it ill befits  Acasto's daughter his whose open stores  Tho' vast were little to his ampler heart  The father of a country thus to pick  The very refuse of those harvestfields  Which from his bounteous friendship I enjoy  Then throw that shameful pittance from thy hand  But ill apply'd to such a rugged task  The fields the master all my fair are thine  If to the various blessings which thy house  Has on me lavish'd thou wilt add that bliss  That dearest bliss the power of blessing thee"  Here ceas'd the youth yet still his speaking eye  Express'd the sacred triumph of his soul  With conscious virtue gratitude and love  Above the vulgar joy divinely rais'd  Nor waited he reply Won by the charm  Of goodness irresistible and all  In sweet disorder lost she blush'd consent  The news immediate to her mother brought  While pierc'd with anxious thought she pin'd away  The lonely moments for Lavinia's fate  Amaz'd and scarce believing what she heard  Joy seiz'd her wither'd veins and one bright gleam  Of setting life shone on her eveninghours  Not less enraptur'd than the happy pair  Who flourish'd long in tender bliss and rear'd  A numerous offspring lovely like themselves  And good the grace of all the country round  THE BASTARD  Almost all things written from the heart as this certainly was have some merit The poet here describes sorrows and misfortunes which were by no means imaginary and thus there runs a truth of thinking through this poem without which it would be of little value as Savage is in other respects but an indifferent poet  IN gayer hours when high my fancy ran  The muse exulting thus her lay began  Blest be the Bastard's birth thro' wond'rous ways  He shines eccentric like a comet's blaze  No sickly fruit of faint compliance he  He stampt in Nature's mint of Extacy  He lives to build not boast a generous race  No tenth transmitter of a foolish face  His daring hope no sire's example bounds  His firstborn lights no prejudice confounds  He kindling from within requires no flame  He glories in a bastard's glowing name  Born to himself by no possession led  In Freedom foster'd and by Fortune fed  Nor guides nor rules his sov'reign choice controul  His body independent as his soul  Loos'd to the world's wide rangeenjoin'd no aim  Prescrib'd no duty and assign'd no name  Nature's unbounded son he stands alone  His heart unbiass'd and his mind his own  O Mother yet no Mother'tis to you  My thanks for such distinguish'd claims are due  You unenslav'd to Nature's narrow laws  Warm championess for Freedom's sacred cause  From all the dry devoirs of blood and line  From ties maternal moral and divine  Discharg'd my grasping soul push'd me from shore  And launch'd me into life without an oar  What had I lost if conjugally kind  By nature hating yet by vows confin'd  Untaught the matrimonial bounds to slight  And coldly conscious of a husband's right  You had faintdrawn me with a form alone  A lawful lump of life by force your own  Then while your backward will retrench'd desire  And unconcurring spirits lent no fire  I had been born your dull domestic heir  Load of your life and motive of your care  Perhaps been poorly rich and meanly great  The slave of pomp a cypher in the state  Lordly neglectful of a worth unknown  And slumbering in a seat by chance my own  Far nobler blessings wait the bastard's lot  Conceiv'd in rapture and with fire begot  Strong as necessity he starts away  Climbs against wrongs and brightens into day  Thus unprophetic lately misinspir'd  I sung gay flutt'ring Hope my fancy fir'd  Inly secure thro' conscious scorn of ill  Nor taught by wisdom how to ballance will  Rashly deceiv'd I saw no pits to shun  But thought to purpose and to act were one  Heedless what pointed cares pervert his way  Whom caution arms not and whom woes betray  But now expos'd and shrinking from distress  I fly to shelter while the tempests press  My muse to grief resigns the varying tone  The raptures languish and the numbers groan  O Memory thou soul of joy and pain  Thou actor of our passions o'er again  Why dost thou aggravate the wretches woe  Why add continuous smart to ev'ry blow  Few are my joys alas how soon forgot  On that kind quarter thou invad'st me not  While sharp and numberless my sorrows fall  Yet thou repeat'st and multiply'st 'em all  Is chance a guilt that my disastrous heart  For mischief never meant must ever smart  Can selfdefence be sinAh plead no more  What tho' no purpos'd malice stain'd thee o'er  Had Heav'n befriended thy unhappy side  Thou had'st not been provok'dor Thou had'st dy'd  Far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all  On whom unsought embroiling dangers fall  Still the pale Dead revives and lives to me  To me thro' Pity's eye condemn'd to see  Remembrance veils his rage but swells his fate  Griev'd I forgive and am grown cool too late  Young and unthoughtful then who knows one day  What ripening virtues might have made their way  He might have liv'd till Folly died in Shame  Till kindling wisdom felt a thirst for fame  He might perhaps his country's friend have prov'd  Both happy gen'rous candid and belov'd  He might have sav'd some worth now doom'd to fall  And I perchance in him have murder'd all  O fate of late repentance always vain  Thy remedies but lull undying pain  Where shall my hope find restNo mother's care  Shielded my infant innocence with prayer  No father's guardian hand my youth maintain'd  Call'd forth my virtues or from vice restrain'd  Is it not thine to snatch some pow'rful arm  First to advance then screen from future harm  I am return'd from death to live in pain  Or wou'd Imperial Pity save in vain  Distrust it notWhat blame can Mercy find  Which gives at once a life and rears a mind  Mother miscall'd farewellof soul severe  This sad reflection yet may force one tear  All I was wretched by to you I ow'd  Alone from strangers ev'ry comfort flow'd  Lost to the life you gave your son no more  And now adopted who was doom'd before  Newborn I may a nobler mother claim  But dare not whisper her immortal name  Supremely lovely and serenely great  Majestic mother of a kneeling state  Queen of a people's heart who ne'er before  AgreedYet now with one consent adore  One contest yet remains in this desire  Who most shall give applause where all admire  THE POET AND HIS PATRON  Mr More was a poet that never had justice done him while living there are few of the moderns have a more correct taste or a more pleasing manner of expressing their thoughts It was upon these fables he chiefly founded his reputation yet they are by no means his best production  WHY Celia is your spreading waist  So loose so negligently lac'd  Why must the wrapping bedgown hide  Your snowy bosom's swelling pride  How ill that dress adorns your head  Distain'd and rumpled from the bed  Those clouds that shade your blooming face▪  A little water might displace  As Nature ev'ry morn bestows  The crystal dew to cleanse the rose  Those tresses as the raven black  That wav'd in ringlets down your back  Uncomb'd and injur'd by neglect  Destroy the face which once they deckt  Whence this forgetfulness of dress  Pray madam are you marry'd Yes  Nay then indeed the wonder ceases  No matter then how loose your dress is  The end is won your fortune's made  Your sister now may take the trade  Alas what pity 'tis to find  This fault in half the female kind  From hence proceed aversion strife  And all that sours the wedded life  Beauty can only point the dart  'Tis neatness guides it to the heart  Let neatness then and beauty strive  To keep a wav'ring flame alive  'Tis harder far you'll find it true  To keep the conquest than subdue  Admit us once behind the screen  What is there farther to be seen  A newer face may raise the flame  But ev'ry woman is the same  Then study chiefly to improve  The charm that fix'd your husband's love  Weigh well his humour Was it dress  That gave your beauty power to bless  Pursue it still be neater seen  'Tis always frugal to be clean  So shall you keep alive desire  And Time's swift wing shall fan the fire  In garret high as stories say  A Poet sung his tuneful lay  So soft so smooth his verse you'd swear  Apollo and the muses there  Thro' all the town his praises rung  His sonnets at the playhouse sung  High waving o'er his lab'ring head  The goddess Want her pinions spread  And with poetic fury fir'd  What Phoebus faintly had inspir'd  A noble youth of taste and wit  Approv'd the sprightly things he writ  And sought him in his cobweb dome  Discharg'd his rent and brought him home  Behold him at the stately board  Who but the Poet and my Lord  Each day deliciously he dines  And greedy quaffs the gen'rous wines  His sides were plump his skin was sleek  And plenty wanton'd on his cheek  Astonish'd at the change so new  Away th' inspiring goddess flew  Now dropt for politics and news  Neglected lay the drooping muse  Unmindful whence his fortune came  He stifled the poetic flame  Nor tale nor sonnet for my lady  Lampoon nor epigram was ready  With just contempt his patron saw  Resolv'd his bounty to withdraw  And th  s with anger in his look  The laterepenting fool bespoke  Blind to the good that courts thee grown  Whence has the sun of favour shone  Delighted with thy tuneful art  Esteem was growing in my heart  But idly thou reject'st the charm  That gave it birth and kept it warm  Unthinking fools alone despise  The arts that taught them first to rise  THE WOLF SHEEP AND LAMB  DUTY demands the parent's voice  Should sanctify the daughter's choice  In that is due obedience shewn  To choose belongs to her alone  May horror seize his midnight hour  Who builds upon a parent's pow'r  And claims by purchase vile and base  The loathing maid for his embrace  Hence virtue sickens and the breast  Where Peace had built her downy nest  Becomes the troubled seat of Care  And pines with anguish and despair  A Wolf rapacious rough and bold  Whose nightly plunders thinn'd the fold  Contemplating his illspent life  And cloy'd with thefts would take a wife  His purpose known the savage race  In num'rous crouds attend the place  For why a mighty Wolf he was  And held dominion in his jaws  Her fav'rite whelp each mother brought  And humbly his alliance sought  But cold by age or else too nice  None found acceptance in his eyes  It happen'd as at early dawn  He solitary cross'd the lawn  Stray'd from the fold a sportive lamb  Skipp'd wanton by her fleecy dam  When Cupid foe to man and beast  Discharg'd an arrow at his breast  The tim'rous breed the robber knew  And trembling o'er the meadow flew  Their nimblest speed the Wolf o'ertook  And courteous thus the dam bespoke  Stay fairest and suspend your fear  Trust me no enemy is near  These jaws in slaughter oft imbru'd  At length have known enough of blood  And kinder business brings me now  Vanquish'd at beauty's foot to bow  You have a daughterSweet forgive  A Wolf's addressIn her I live  Love from her eyes like lightning came  And set my marrow all on flame  Let your consent confirm my choice  And ratify our nuptial joys  Me ample wealth and pow'r attend  Wide o'er the plains my realms ex  What midnight robber dare invade  The fold if I the guard am made  At home the shepherd's cur may sleep  While I secure his master's sheep  Discourse like this attention claim'd  Grandeur the mother's breast inflam'd  Now fearless by his side she walk'd  Of settlements and jointures talk'd  Propos'd and doubled her demands  Of flow'ry fields and turniplands  The wolf agrees Her bosom swells  To miss her happy fate she tells  And of the grand alliance vain  Contemns her kindred of the plain  The loathing lamb with horror hears  And wearies out her dam with pray'rs  But all in vain mamma best knew  What unexperienc'd girls should do  So to the neighb'ring meadow carry'd  A formal ass the couple marry'd  Torn from the tyrant mother's side  The trembler goes a victimbride  Reluctant meets the rude embrace  And bleats among the howling race  With horror oft her eyes behold  Her murder'd kindred of the fold  Each day a sister lamb is serv'd  And at the glutton's table carv'd  The crashing bones he grinds for food  And slakes his thirst with streaming blood  Love who the cruel mind detests  And lodges but in gentle breasts  Was now no more Enjoyment past  The savage hunger'd for the feast  But as we find in human race  A mask conceals the villain's face  Justice must authorize the treat  Till then he long'd but durst not eat  As forth he walk'd in quest of prey  The hunters met him on the way  Fear wings his flight the marsh he sought  The snuffing dogs are set at fault  His stomach baulk'd now hunger gnaws  Howling he grinds his empty jaws  Food must be hadand lamb is nigh  His maw invokes the fraudful lye  Is this dissembling rage he cry'd  The gentle virtue of a bride  That leagu'd with man's destroying race  She sets her husband for the chace  By treach'ry prompts the noisy hound  To scent his footsteps on the ground  Thou trait'ress vile for this thy blood  Shall glut my rage and dye the wood  So saying on the lamb he flies  Beneath his jaws the victim dies  THE FEMALE SEDUCERS  'TIS said of widow maid and wife  That Honour is a woman's life  Unhappy sex who only claim  A being in the breath of fame  Which tainted not the quick'ning gales  That sweep Sabaea's spicy vales  Nor all the healing sweets restore  That breathe along Arabia's shore  The trav'ler if he chance to stray  May turn uncensur'd to his way  Polluted streams again are pure  And deepest wounds admit a cure  But woman no redemption knows  The wounds of honour never close  Tho' distant ev'ry hand to guide  Nor skill'd on life's tempestuous tide  If once her feeble bark recede  Or deviate from the course decreed  In vain she seeks the friendly shore  Her swifter folly flies before  The circling ports against her close  And shut the wand'rer from repose  Till by conflicting waves oppress'd  Her found'ring pinnace sinks to rest  Are there no offerings to atone  For but a single errorNone  Tho' woman is avow'd of old  No daughter of celestial mold  Her temp'ring not without allay  And form'd but of the finer clay  We challenge from the mortal dame  The strength angelic natures claim  Nay more for sacred stories tell  That ev'n immortal angels fell  Whatever fills the teeming sphere  Of humid earth and ambient air  With varying elements endu'd  Was form'd to fall and rise renew'd  The stars no fix'd duration know  Wide oceans ebb again to flow  The moon repletes her waining face  Allbeauteous from her late disgrace  And suns that mourn approaching night  Refulgent rise with newborn light  In vain may Death and Time subdue  While Nature mints her race anew  And holds some vital spark apart  Like virtue hid in ev'ry heart  'Tis hence reviving warmth is seen  To cloathe a naked world in green  No longer barr'd by winter's cold  Again the gates of life unfold  Again each insect tries his wing  And lifts fresh pinions on the spring  Again from ev'ry latent root  The bladed stem and tendril shoot  Exhaling incense to the skies  Again to perish and to rise  And must weak woman then disown  The change to which a world is prone  In one meridian brightness shine  And ne'er like evening suns decline  Resolv'd and firm aloneIs this  What we demand of womanYes  But should the spark of vestal fire  In some unguarded hour expire  Or should the nightly thief invade  Hesperia's chaste and sacred shade  Of all the blooming spoil possess'd  The dragon Honour charm'd to rest  Shall Virtue's flame no more return  No more with virgin splendor burn  No more the ravag'd garden blow  With Spring's succeeding blossomNo  Pity may mourn but not restore  And woman falls to rise no more  Within this sublunary sphere  A country liesNo matter where  The clime may readily be found  By all who tread poetic ground  A stream call'd Life across it glides  And equally the land divides  And here of Vice the province lies  And there the hills of Virtue rise  Upon a mountain's airy stand  Whose summit look'd to either land  An antient pair their dwelling chose  As well for prospect as repose  For mutual faith they long were fam'd  And Temp'rance and Religion nam'd  A num'rous progeny divine  Confess'd the honours of their line  But in a little daughter fair  Was center'd more than half their care  For Heav'n to gratulate her birth  Gave signs of future joy to earth  White was the robe this infant wore  And Chastity the name she bore  As now the maid in stature grew  A flow'r just op'ning to the view  Oft thro' her native lawns she stray'd  And wrestling with the lambkins play'd  Her looks diffusive sweets bequeath'd  The breeze grew purer as she breath'd  The morn her radiant blush assum'd  The spring with earlier fragrance bloom'd  And Nature yearly took delight  Like her to dress the world in white  But when her rising form was seen  To reach the crisis of fifteen  Her parents up the mountain's head  With anxious step their darling led  By turns they snatch'd her to their breast  And thus the fears of age express'd  O joyful cause of many a care  O daughter too divinely fair  Yon world on this important day  Demands thee to a dang'rous way  A painful journey all must go  Whose doubtful period none can know  Whose due direction who can find  Where Reason's mute and Sense is blind  Ah what unequal leaders these  Thro' such a wide perplexing maze  Then mark the warnings of the wise  And learn what love and years advise  Far to the right thy prospect bend  Where yonder tow'ring hills ascend  Lo there the arduous paths in view  Which Virtue and her sons pursue  With toil o'er lessening earth they rise  And gain and gain upon the skies  Narrow's the way her children tread  No walk for pleasure smoothly spread  But rough and difficult and steep  Painful to climb and hard to keep  Fruits immature those lands dispense  A food indelicate to sense  Of taste unpleasant yet from those  Pure health with chearful vigour flows  And strength unfeeling of decay  Throughout the long laborious way  Hence as they scale that heav'nly road  Each limb is lighten'd of its load  From earth refining still they go  And leave the mortal weight below  Then spreads the strait the doubtful clears  And smooth the rugged path appears  For custom turns fatigue to ease  And taught by virtue pain can please  At length the toilsome journey o'er  And near the bright celestial shore  A gulph black fearful and profound  Appears of either world the bounds  Thro' darkness leading up to light  Sense backward shrinks and shuns the sight  For there the transitory train  Of time and form and care and pain  And matter's gross incumb'ring mass  Man's late associates cannot pass  But sinking quit th' immortal charge  And leave the wond'ring soul at large  Lightly she wings her obvious way  And mingles with eternal day  Thither O thither wing thy speed  Though pleasure charm or pain impede  To such th' allbounteous pow'r has giv'n  For present earth a future Heav'n  For trivial loss unmeasur'd gain  And endless bliss for transient pain  Then fear ah fear to turn thy sight  Where yonder flow'ry fields invite  Wide on the left the pathway bends  And with pernicious ease descends  There sweet to sense and fair to show  Newplanted Edens seem to blow  Trees that delicious poison bear  For death is vegetable there  Hence is the frame of health unbrac'd  Each sinew slack'ning at the taste  The soul to passion yields her throne  And sees with organs not her own  While like the slumb'rer in the night  Pleas'd with the shadowy dream of light  Before her alienated eyes  The scenes of fairyland arise  The puppet world's amusing show  Dipt in gaylycolour'd bow  Scepters and wreaths and glitt'ring things  The toys of infants and of kings  That tempt along the baneful plain  The idly wise and lightly vain  Till verging on the gulphy shore  Sudden they sink and rise no more  But list to what thy fates declare  Tho' thou art woman frail as fair  If once thy sliding foot should stray  Once quit yon heav'nappointed way  For thee lost maid for thee alone  Nor pray'rs shall plead nor tears atone  Reproach scorn infamy and hate  On thy returning steps shall wait  Thy form be loath'd by ev'ry eye  And ev'ry foot thy presence fly  Thus arm'd with words of potent sound  Like guardian angels plac'd around  A charm by truth divinely cast  Forward our young advent'rer pass'd  Forth from her sacred eyelids sent  Like morn forerunning radiance went  While Honour handmaid late assign'd  Upheld her lucid train behind  Awestruck the muchadmiring crowd  Before the virgin vision bow'd  Gaz'd with an ever new delight  And caught fresh virtue at the sight  For not of earth's unequal frame  They deem'd the heav'ncompounded Dame  If matter sure the most refin'd  High wrought and temper'd into mind  Some darling daughter of the day  And body'd by her native ray  Wheree'er she passes thousands bend  And thousands where she moves attend  Her ways observant eyes confess  Her steps pursuing praises bless  While to the elevated maid  Oblations as to Heav'n are paid  'Twas on an everblithsome day  The jovial birth of rosy May  When genial warmth no more suppress'd  New melts the frost in ev'ry breast  The cheek with secret flushing dyes  And looks kind things from chastest eyes  The sun with healthier visage glows  Aside his clouded kerchief throws  And dances up th' etherial plain  Where late he us'd to climb with pain  While Nature as from bonds set free  Springs out and gives a loose to glee  And now for momentary rest  The nymph her travell'd step repress'd  Just turn'd to view the stage attain'd  And glory'd in the height she gain'd  Outstretch'd before her wide survey  The realms of sweet Perdition lay  And Pity touch'd her soul with woe  To see a world so lost below  When strait the breeze began to breathe  Airs gently wafted from beneath  That bore commission'd witchcraft thence  And reach'd her sympathy of sense  No sounds of discord that disclose  A people sunk and lost in woes  But as of present good possess'd  The very triumph of the bless'd  The maid in wrapt attention hung  While thus approaching Sirens sung  Hither fairest hither haste  Brightest beauty come and taste  What the pow'rs of bliss unfold  Joys too mighty to be told  Taste what extasies they give  Dying raptures taste and live  In thy lap disdaining measure  Nature empties all her treasure  Soft desires that sweetly languish  Fierce delights that rise to anguish  Fairest dost thou yet delay  Brightest beauty come away  List not when the froward chide  Sons of pedantry and pride  Snarlers to whose feeble sense  April sunshine is offence  Age and Envy will advise  Ev'n against the joy they prize  Come in Pleasure's balmy bowl  Slake the thirstings of thy soul  Till thy raptur'd pow'rs are fainting  With enjoyment past the painting  Fairest dost thou yet delay  Brightest beauty come away  So sung the Sirens as of yore  Upon the false Ausonian shore  And O for that preventing chain  That bound Ulysses on the main  That so our FairOne might withstand  The covert ruin now at hand  The song her charm'd attention drew  When now the tempters stood in view  Curiosity with prying eyes  And hands of busy bold emprise  Like Hermes feather'd were her feet  And like forerunning fancy fleet  By search untaught by toil untir'd  To novelty she still aspir'd  Tasteless of ev'ry good possess'd  And but in expectation bless'd  With her associate Pleasure came  Gay Pleasure frolicloving dame  Her mien all swimming in delight  Her beauties half reveal'd to sight  Loose flow'd her garments from the ground  And caught the kissing winds around  As erst Medusa's looks were known  To turn beholders into stone  A dire reversion here they felt  And in the eye of Pleasure melt  Her glance with sweet perswasion charm'd  Unnerv'd the strong the steel'd disarm'd  No safety e'en the flying find  Who vent'rous look but once behind  Thus was the much admiring maid  While distant more than half betray'd  With smiles and adulation bland  They join'd her side and seiz'd her hand  Their touch envenom'd sweets instill'd  Her frame with new pulsations thrill'd  While half consenting half denying  Repugnant now and now complying  Amidst a war of hopes and fears  Of trembling wishes smiling tears  Still down and down the winning pair  Compell'd the struggling yielding fair  As when some stately vessel bound  To bless'd Arabia's distant ground  Borne from her courses haply lights  Where Barca's flow'ry clime invites  Conceal'd around whose treach'rous land  Lurks the dire rock and dang'rous sand  The pilot warns with sail and oar  To shun the much suspected shore  In vain the tide too subtly strong  Still bears the wrestling bark along  Till found'ring she resigns to fate  And sinks o'erwhelm'd with all her freight  So baffling ev  y bar to sin  And Heav'n's own pilot plac'd within  Along the devious smooth descent  With pow'rs increasing as they went  The dames accustom'd to subdue  As with a rapid current drew  And o'er the fatal bounds convey'd  The lost the long reluctant maid  Here stop ye fair ones and beware  Nor send your fond affections there  Yet yet your darling now deplor'd  May turn to you and Heav'n restor'd  Till then with weeping Honour wait  The servant of her better fate  With Honour left upon the shore  Her friend and handmaid now no more  Nor with the guilty world upbraid  The fortunes of a wretch betray'd  But o'er her failing cast the veil  Rememb'ring you yourselves are frail  And now from allenquiring light  Fast fled the conscious shades of night  The damsel from a short repose  Confounded at her plight arose  As when with slumb'rous weight oppress'd  Some wealthy miser sinks to rest  Where felons eye the glitt'ring prey  And steal his hoard of joys away  He borne where golden Indus streams  Of pearl and quarry'd di'mond dreams  Like Midas turns the glebe to oar  And stands all wrapt amidst his store  But wakens naked and despoil'd  Of that for which his years had toil'd  So far'd the nymph her treasure flown  And turn'd like Niobe to stone  Within without obscure and void  She felt all ravag'd all destroy'd  And O thou curs'd insidious coast  Are these the blessings thou can'st boast  These Virtue these the joys they find  Who leave thy heav'ntopt hills behind  Shade me ye pines ye caverns hide  Ye mountains cover me she cry'd  Her trumpet Slander rais'd on high  And told the tidings to the sky  Contempt discharg'd a living dart  A sidelong viper to her heart  Reproach breath'd poisons o'er her face  And soil'd and blasted ev'ry grace  Officious Shame her handmaid new  Still turn'd the mirror to her view  While those in crimes the deepest dy'd  Approach'd to whiten at her side  And every lewd insulting dame  Upon her folly rose to fame  What should she do Attempt once more  To gain the latedeserted shore  So trusting back the mourner flew  As fast the train of fiends pursue  Again the farther shore's attain'd  Again the land of virtue gain'd  But Echo gathers in the wind  And shows her instant foes behind  Amaz'd with headlong speed she tends  Where late she left an host of friends  Alas those shrinking friends decline  Nor longer own that form divine  With fear they mark the following cry  And from the lonely trembler fly  Or backward drive her on the coast  Where peace was wreck'd and honour lost  From earth thus hoping aid in vain  To Heav'n not daring to complain  No truce by hostile Clamour giv'n  And from the face of Friendship driv'n  The nymph sunk prostrate on the ground  With all her weight of woes around  Enthron'd within a circling sky  Upon a mount o'er mountains high  All radiant sate as in a shrine  Virtue first effluence divine  Far far above the scenes of woe  That shut this cloud wrapt world below  Superior goddess essence bright  Beauty of uncreated light  Whom should mortality survey  As doom'd upon a certain day  The breath of Frailty must expire  The world dissolve in living fire  The gems of Heav'n and solar flame  Be quench'd by her eternal beam  And Nature quick'ning in her eye  To rise a newborn Phoenix die  Hence unreveal'd to mortal view  A veil around her form she threw  Which three sad sisters of the shade  Pain Care and Melancholy made  Thro' this her allenquiring eye  Attentive from her station high  Beheld abandon'd to despair  The ruins of her fav'rite fair  And with a voice whose awful sound  Appal'd the guilty world around  Bid the tumultuous winds be still  To numbers bow'd each list'ning hill  Uncurl'd the surging of the main  And smooth'd the thorny bed of pain  The golden harp of Heav'n she strung  And thus the tuneful goddess sung  Lovely penitent arise  Come and claim thy kindred skies  Come thy sister angels say  Thou hast wept thy stains away  Let experience now decide  'Twixt the good and evil try'd  In the smooth enchanted ground  Say unfold the treasures found  Structures rais'd by morning dreams  Sands that trip the flitting streams  Down that anchors on the air  Clouds that paint their changes there  Seas that smoothly dimpling lie  While the storm impends on high  Showing in an obvious glass  Joys that in possession pass  Transient fickle light and gay  Flatt'ring only to betray  What alas can life contain  Life like all its circlesvain  Will the stork intending rest  On the billow build her nest  Will the bee demand his store  From the bleak and bladeless shore  Man alone intent to stray  Ever turns from Wisdom's way  Lays up wealth in foreign land  Sows the sea and plows the sand  Soon this elemental mass  Soon th' incumb'ring world shall pass  Form be wrapt in wasting fire  Time be spent and life expire  Then ye boasted works of men  Where is your assylum then  Sons of Pleasure sons of Care  Tell me mortals tell me where  Gone like traces on the deep  Like a scepter grasp'd in sleep  Dews exhal'd from morning glades  Melting snows and gliding shades  Pass the world and what's behind  Virtue's gold by fire refin'd  From an universe deprav'd  From the wreck of nature sav'd  Like the lifesupporting grain  Fruit of patience and of pain  On the swain's autumnal day  Winnow'd from the chaff away  Little trembler fear no more  Thou hast plenteous crops in store  Seed by genial sorrows sown  More than all thy scorners own  What though hostile earth despise  Heav'n beholds with gentler eyes  Heav'n thy friendless steps shall guide  Chear thy hours and guard thy side  When the fatal trump shall sound  When th' immortals pour around  Heav'n shall thy return attest  Hail'd by myriads of the bless'd  Little native of the skies  Lovely penitent arise  Calm thy bosom clear thy brow  Virtue is thy sister now  More delightful are my woes  Than the rapture pleasure knows  Richer far the weeds I bring  Than the robes that grace a king  On my wars of shortest date  Crowns of endless triumphs wait  On my cares a period bless'd  On my toils eternal rest  Come with Virtue at thy side  Come be ev'ry bar defy'd  Till we gain our native shore  Sister come and turn no more  AN EPISTLE TO A LADY  This little poem by Mr Nugent is very pleasing The easiness of the poetry and the justice of the thoughts constitute its principal beauty  CLARINDA dearly lov'd attend  The counsels of a faithful friend  Who with the warmest wishes fraught  Feels all at least that friendship ought  But since by ruling Heav'n's design  An other's fate shall influence thine  O may these lines for him prepare  A bliss which I wou'd die to share  Man may for wealth or glory roam  But woman must be blest at home  To this should all her studies tend  This her great object and her end  Distaste unmingl'd pleasures bring  And use can blunt Affliction's sting  Hence perfect bliss no mortals know  And few are plung'd in utter woe  While Nature arm'd against Despair  Gives pow'r to mend or strength to bear  And half the thought content may gain  Which spleen employs to purchase pain  Trace not the fair domestic plan  From what you wou'd but what you can  Nor peevish spurn the scanty store  Because you think you merit more  Bliss ever differs in degree  Thy share alone is meant for thee  And thou shou'dst think however small  That share enough for 'tis thy all  Vain scorn will aggravate distress  And only make that little less  Admit whatever trifles come  Units compose the largest sum  O tell them o'er and say how vain  Are those who form Ambition's train  Which swell the monarch's gorgeous state  And bribe to ill the guilty great  But thou more blest more wise than these  Shalt build up happiness on ease  Hail sweet Content where joy serene  Guilds the mild soul's unruffl'd scene  And with blith Fancy's pencil wrought  Spreads the white web of flowing thought  Shines lovely in the chearful face  And clothes each charm with native grace  Effusion pure of bliss sincere  A vestment for a god to wear  Far other ornaments compose  The garb that shrouds dissembl'd woes  Piec'd out with motley dies and sorts  Freaks whimsies festivals and sports  The troubl'd mind's fantastic dress  Which madness titles happiness  While the gay wretch to revels bears  The pale remains of fighs and tears  And seeks in crowds like her undone  What only can be found in one  But chief my gentle friend remove  Far from thy couch seducing Love  O shun the false magician's art  Nor trust thy yet unguarded heart  Charm'd by his spells fair Honour flies  And thousand treacherous phantoms rise  Where Guilt in Beauty's ray beguiles  And Ruin lurks in Friendship's smiles  Lo where th' enchanted captive dreams  Of warbling groves and purling streams  Of painted meads of flow'rs that shed  Their odours round her fragrant bed  Quick shifts the scene the charm is lost  She wakes upon a desert coast  No friendly hand to lend its aid  No guardian bow'r to spread its shade  Expos'd to ev'ry chilling blast  She treads th' inhospitable waste  And down the drear decline of life  Sinks a forlorn dishonour'd wife  Neglect not thou the voice of Fame  But clear from crime be free from blame  Tho' all were innocence within  'Tis guilt to wear the garb of sin  Virtue rejects the foul disguise  None merit praise who praise despise  Slight not in supercilious strain  Long practis'd modes as low or vain  The world will vindicate their cause  And claim blind faith in Custom's laws  Safer with multitudes to stray  Than tread alone a fairer way  To mingle with the erring throng  Than boldly speak ten millions wrong  Beware of the relentless train  Whom forms adore whom forms maintain  Lest prudes demure or coxcombs loud  Accuse thee to the partial crowd  Foes who the laws of honour slight  A judge who measures guilt by spite  Behold the sage Aurelia stand  Disgrace and Fame at her command  As if Heav'n's delegate design'd  Sole arbiter of all her kind  Whether she try some favour'd piece  By rules devis'd in antient Greece  Or whether modern in her flight  She tells what Paris thinks polite  For much her talents to advance  She study'd Greece and travell'd France  There learn'd the happy art to please  With all the charms of labour'd ease  Thro' looks and nods with meaning fraught  To teach what she was never taught  By her each latent spring is seen  The workings foul of secret spleen  The guilt that skulks in fair pretence  Or folly veil'd in specious sense  And much her righteous spirit grieves  When worthlessness the world deceives  Whether the erring crowd commends  Some patriot sway'd by private ends  Or husband trust a faithless wife  Secure in ignorance from strife  Averse she brings their deeds to view  But justice claims the rig'rous due  Humanely anxious to produce  At least some possible excuse  O ne'er may virtue's dire disgrace  Prepare a triumph for the base  Meer forms the fool implicit sway  Which witlings with contempt survey  Blind folly no defect can see  Half wisdom views but one degree  The wise remoter uses reach  Which judgment and experience teach  Whoever wou'd be pleas'd and please  Must do what others do with ease  Great precept undefin'd by rule  And only learn'd in Custom's school  To no peculiar form confin'd  It spreads thro' all the human kind  Beauty and wit and worth supplies  Yet graceful in the good and wise  Rich with this gift and none beside  In Fashion's stream how many glide  Secure from ev'ry mental woe  From treach'rous friend or open foe  From social sympathy that shares  The public loss or private cares  Whether the barb'rous foe invade  Or merit pine in Fortune's shade  Hence gentle Anna ever gay  The same tomorrow as today  Save where perchance when others weep  Her cheek the decent sorrow steep  Save when perhaps a melting tale  O'er ev'ry tender breast prevail  The good the bad the great the small  She likes she loves she honours all  And yet if sland'rous malice blame  Patient she yields a sister's fame  Alike if satyr or if praise  She says whate'er the circle says  Implicit does whate'er they do  Without one point in wish or view  Sure test of others faithful glass  Thro' which the various phantoms pass  Wide blank unfeeling when alone  No care no joy no thought her own  Not thus succeeds the peerless dame  Who looks and talks and acts for fame  Intent so wide her cares extend  To make the universe her friend  Now with the gay in frolics shines  Now reasons deep with deep divines  With courtiers now extols the great  With patriots sighs o'er Britain's fate  Now breathes with zealots holy fires  Now melts in less refin'd desires  Doom'd to exceed in each degree  Too wise too weak too proud too free  Too various for one single word  The high sublime of deep absurd  While ev'ry talent nature grants  Just serves to shew how much she wants  Altho' in combine  The virtues of our sex and thine  Her hand restrains the widow's tears  Her sense informs and sooths and cheers  Yet like an angel in disguise  She shines but to some favour'd eyes  Nor is the distant herd allow'd  To view the radiance thro' the cloud  But thine is ev'ry winning art  Thine is the friendly honest heart  And shou'd the gen'rous spirit flow  Beyond where prudence fears to go  Such sallies are of nobler kind  Than virtues of a narrow mind  HANS CARVEL  This bagatelle for which by the bye Mr Prior has got his greatest reputation was a tale told in all the old Italian collections of jests and borrowed from thence by Fontaine It had been translated once or twice before into English yet was never regarded till it fell into the hands of Mr Prior A strong instance how much every thing is improved in the hands of a man of genius  HANS CARVEL impotent and old  Married a lass of London mold  Handsome enough extremely gay  Lov'd music company and play  High flights she had and wit at will  And so her tongue lay seldom still  For in all visits who but she  To argue or to repartee  She made it plain that human passion  Was order'd by predestination  That if weak women went astray  Their stars were more in fault than they  Whole tragedies she had by heart  Enter'd into Roxana's part  To triumph in her rival's blood  The action certainly was good  How like a vine young Ammon curl'd  Oh that dear conqu'ror of the world  She pity'd Betterton in age  That ridicul'd the godlike rage  She first of all the town was told  Where newest India things were sold  So in a morning without bodice  Slipt sometimes out to Mrs Thody's  To cheapen tea to buy a screen  What else could so much virtue mean  For to prevent the least reproach  Betty went with her in the coach  But when no very great affair  Excited her peculiar care  She without fail was wak'd at ten  Drank chocolate then slept again  At twelve she rose with much ado  Her cloaths were huddled on by two  Then does my lady dine at home  Yes surebut is the Col'nel come  Next how to spend the afternoon  And not come home again too soon  The change the city or the play  As each was proper for the day  A turn in summer to Hyde Park  When it grew tolerably dark  Wife's pleasure causes husband's pain  Strange fancies come in Hans's brain  He thought of what he did not name  And would reform but durst not blame  At first he therefore preach'd his wife  The comforts of a pious life  Told her how transient beauty was  That all must die and flesh was grass  He bought her sermons psalms and graces  And doubled down the useful places  But still the weight of worldly care  Allow'd her little time for pray'r  And Cleopatra was read o'er  While Scot and Wake and twenty more  That teach one to deny one's self  Stood unmolested on the shelf  An untouch'd bible grac'd her toilet  No fear that thumb of her's should spoil it  In short the trade was still the same  The dame went out the Col'nel came  What's to be done poor Carvel cry'd  Another batt'ry must be try'd  What if to spells I had recourse  'Tis but to hinder something worse  The end must justify the means  He only sins who ill intends  Since therefore 'tis to combat evil  'Tis lawful to employ the Devil  Forthwith the Devil did appear  For name him and he's always near  Not in the shape in which he plies  At Miss's elbow when she lies  Or stands before the nurs'ry doors  To take the naughty boy that roars  But without sawcer eye or claw  Like a grave barrister at law  Hans Carvel lay aside your grief  The Devil says I bring relief  Relief says Hans pray let me crave  Your name SirSatanSir your slave  I did not look upon your feet  You'll pardon meAy now I see't  And pray Sir when came you from Hell  Our friends there did you leave them well  All well but pr'ythee honest Hans  Says Satan leave your complaisance  The truth is this I cannot stay  Flaring in sunshine all the day  For  entre nous  we hellish sprites  Love more the fresco of the nights  And oftner our receipts convey  In dreams than any other way  I tell you therefore as a friend  Ere morning dawns your fears shall end  Go then this evening master Carvel  Lay down your fowls and broach your barrel  Let friends and wine dissolve your care  Whilst I the great receipt prepare  Tonight I'll bring it by my faith  Believe for once what Satan saith  Away went Hans glad not a little  Obey'd the Devil to a tittle  Invited friends some half a dozen  The Col'nel and my lady's cousin  The meat was serv'd the bowls were crown'd  Catches were sung and healths went round  Barbadoes waters for the close  Till Hans had fairly got his dose  The Col'nel toasted to the best  The dame mov'd off to be undrest  The chimes went twelve the guests withdrew  But when or how Hans hardly knew  Some modern anecdotes aver  He nodded in his elbow chair  From thence was carried off to bed  John held his heels and Nan his head  My lady was disturb'd new sorrow  Which Hans must answer for tomorrow  In bed then view this happy pair  And think how Hymen triumph'd there  Hans fast asleep as soon as laid  The duty of the night unpaid  The waking dame with thoughts opprest  That made her hate both him and rest  By such a husband such a wife  'Twas Achme's and Septimius' life  The lady sigh'd the lover snor'd  The punctual Devil kept his word  Appear'd to honest Hans again  But not at all by madam seen  And giving him a magic ring  Fit for the finger of a king  Dear Hans said he this jewel take  And wear it long for Satan's sake  'Twill do your business to a hair  For long as you this ring shall wear  As sure as I look over Lincoln  That ne'er shall happen which you think on  Hans took the ring with joy extream  All this was only in a dream  And thrusting it beyond his joint  'Tis done he cry'd I've gain'd my point  What point said she you ugly beast  You neither give me joy nor rest  'Tis doneWhat's done you drunken bear  You've thrust your finger Gd knows where  THE LADLE  THE Sceptics think 'twas long ago  Since gods came down incognito  To see who were their friends or foes  And how our actions fell or rose  That since they gave things their beginning  And set this whirlagig a spinning  Supine they in their heav'n remain  Exempt from passion and from pain  And frankly leave us human elves  To cut and shuffle for ourselves  To stand or walk to rise or tumble  As matter and as motion jumble  The poets now and painters hold  This thesis both absurd and bold  And your goodnatur'd gods they say  Descend some twice or thrice aday  Else all these things we toil so hard in  Would not avail one single farthing  For when the hero we rehearse  To grace his actions and our verse  'Tis not by dint of human thought  That to his Latium he is brought  Iris descends by Fate's commands  To guide his steps thro' foreign lands  And Amphitrite clears the way  From rocks and quicksands in the sea  And if you see him in a sketch  Tho' drawn by Paulo or Carrache  He shows not half his force and strength  Strutting in armour and at length  That he may take his proper figure  The piece must yet be four yards bigger  The nymphs conduct him to the field  One holds his sword and one his shield  Mars standing by asserts his quarrel  And Fame flies after with a lawrel  These points I say of speculation  As 'twere to save or sink the nation  Men idly learned will dispute  Assert object confirm refute  Each mighty angry mighty right  With equal arms sustains the fight  'Till now no umpire can agree 'em  So both draw off and sing  Te Deum  Is it in equilibrio  If deities descend or no  Then let th' affirmative prevail  As requisite to form the tale  For by all parties 'tis confest  That those opinions are the best  Which in their nature most conduce  To present ends or private use  Two gods came therefore from above  One Mercury the t'other Jove  The humour was it seems to know  If all the favours they bestow  Could from our own perverseness ease us  And if our wish enjoy'd would please us  Discoursing largely on this theme  O'er hills and dales their godships came  Till well nigh tir'd at almost night  They thought it proper to alight  Note here that it as true as odd is  That in disguise a god or goddess  Exerts no supernat'ral powers  But acts on maxims much like ours  They spy'd at last a country farm  Where all was snug and clean and warm  For woods before and hills behind  Secur'd it both from rain and wind  Large oxen in the fields were lowing  Good grain was sow'd good fruit was growing  Of last year's corn in barns great store  Fat turkeys gobbling at the door  And Wealth in short with Peace consented  That people here should live contented  But did they in effect do so  Have patience friend and thou shalt know  The honest farmer and his wife  Two years declin'd from prime of life  Had struggled with the marriage noose  As almost ev'ry couple does  Sometimes my Plague sometimes my Darling  Kissing today tomorrow snarling  Jointly submitting to endure  That evil which admits no cure  Our gods the outward gate unbarr'd  Our farmer met 'em in the yard  Thought they were folks that lost their way  And ask'd them civilly to stay  Told them for supper or for bed  They might go on and be worse sped  So said so done the gods consent  All three into the parlour went  They compliment they sit they chat  Fight o'er the wars reform the state  A thousand knotty points they clear  Till supper and my wife appear  Jove made his leg and kiss'd the dame  Obsequious Hermes did the same  Jove kiss'd the farmer's wife you say  He didbut in an honest way  Oh not with half that warmth and life  With which he kiss'd Amphitryon's wife  Well then things handsomely were serv'd  My mistress for the strangers carv'd  How strong the beer how good the meat  How loud they laugh'd how much they eat  In epic sumptuous wou'd appear  Yet shall be pass'd in silence here  For I should grieve to have it said  That by a fine description led  I made my episode too long  Or tir'd my friend to grace my song  The grace cup serv'd the cloth away  Jove thought it time to shew his play  Landlord and landlady he cry'd  Folly and jesting laid aside  That ye thus hospitably live  And strangers with good chear receive  Is mighty grateful to your betters  And makes e'en gods themselves your debtors  To give the thesis plainer proof  You have tonight beneath your roof  A pair of gods nay never wonder  This youth can fly and I can thunder  I'm Jupiter and he Mercurius  My page my son indeed but spurious  Form then three wishes you and madam  And sure as you already had 'em  The things desir'd in half an hour  Shall all be here and in your pow'r  Thank ye great gods the woman says  O may your altars ever blaze  A ladle for our silver dish  Is what I want is what I wish  A ladle cries the man a ladle  'Odzooks Corsica you have pray'd ill  What should be great you turn to farce  I wish the ladle in your a  With equal grief and shame my muse  The sequel of the tale pursues  The ladle fell into the room  And stuck in old Corsica's bum  Our couple weep two wishes past  And kindly join to form the last  To ease the woman's aukward pain  And get the ladle out again  MORAL  THIS Commoner has worth and parts  Is prais'd for arms or lov'd for arts  His head achs for a coronet  And who is bless'd that is not great  Some sense and more estate kind Heav'n  To this welllotted peer has given  What then he must have rule and sway  And all is wrong till he's in play  The miser must make up his plum  And dares not touch the hoarded sum  The sickly dotard wants a wife  To draw off his last dregs of life  Against our peace we arm our will  Amidst our plenty something still  For horses houses pictures planting  To thee to me to him is wanting  The cruel something unpossess'd  Corrodes and leavens all the rest  That something if we could obtain  Would soon create a future pain  And to the coffin from the cradle  'Tis all a wish and all a Ladle  BAUCIS AND PHILEMON FROM SWIFT  This poem is very fine and though in the same strain with the preceding is yet superior  IN ancient times as story tells  The saints would often leave their cells  And strole about but hide their quality  To try good people's hospitality  It happen'd on a winter night  As authors of the legend write  Two brother hermits saints by trade  Taking their tour in masquerade  Disguis'd in tatter'd habits went  To a small village down in Kent  Where in the strollers' canting strain  They begg'd from door to door in vain  Try'd ev'ry tone might pity win  But not a soul would let 'em in  Our wand'ring saints in woful state  Treated at this ungodly rate  Having through all the village pass'd  To a small cottage came at last  Where dwelt a good old honest ye'man  Call'd in the neighbourhood Philemon  Who kindly did these saints invite  In his poor hut to pass the night  And then the hospitable sire  Bid goody Baucis mend the fire  While he from out the chimney took  A flitch of bacon off the hook  And freely from the fattest side  Cut out large slices to be fry'd  Then stepp'd aside to fetch 'em drink  Fill'd a large jug up to the brink  And saw it fairly twice go round  Yet what is wonderful they found  'Twas still replenish'd to the top  As if they had not touch'd a drop  The good old couple were amaz'd  And often on each other gaz'd  For both were frighten'd to the heart  And just began to crywhat art  Then softly turn'd aside to view  Whether the lights were burning blue  The gentle pilgrims soon aware on't  Told them their calling and their errand  Good folks you need not be afraid  We are but Saints the hermits said  No hurt shall come to you or yours  But for that pack of churlish boors  Not fit to live on christian ground  They and their houses shall be drown'd  Whilst you shall see your cottage rise  And grow a church before your eyes  They scarce had spoke when fair and soft  The roof began to mount aloft  Aloft rose ev'ry beam and rafter  The heavy wall climb'd slowly after  The chimney widen'd and grew higher  Became a steeple with a spire  The kettle to the top was hoist  And there stood fasten'd to a joist  But with the upside down to show  Its inclination for below  In vain for a superior force  Apply'd at bottom stops its course  Doom'd ever in suspence to dwell  'Tis now no kettle but a bell  A wooden jack which had almost  Lost by disuse the art to roast  A sudden alteration feels  Increas'd by new intestine wheels  And what exalts the wonder more  The number made the motion slower  The flyer though't had leaden feet  Turn'd round so quick you scarce could see't  But slacken'd by some secret pow'r  Now hardly moves an inch an hour  The jack and chimney near ally'd  Had never left each other's side  The chimney to a steeple grown  The jack would not be left alone  But up against the steeple rear'd  Became a clock and still adher'd  And still its love to houshold cares  By a shrill voice at noon declares  Warning the cookmaid not to burn  That roastmeat which it cannot turn  The groaningchair began to crawl  Like a huge snail along the wall  There stuck aloft in public view  And with small change a pulpit grew  The porringers that in a row  Hung high and made a glitt'ring shew  To a less noble substance chang'd  Were now but leathern buckets rang'd  The ballads pasted on the wall  Of Joan of France and English Moll  Fair Rosamond and Robin Hood  The Little Children in the Wood  Now seem'd to look abundant better  Improv'd in picture size and letter  And high in order plac'd describe  The heraldry of ev'ry tribe  A bedstead of the antique mode  Compact of timber many a load  Such as our ancestors did use  Was metamorphos'd into pews  Which still their ancient nature keep  By lodging folks dispos'd to sleep  The cottage by such feats as these  Grown to a church by just degrees  The hermits then desir'd their host  To ask for what he fancy'd most  Philemon having paus'd awhile  Return'd 'em thanks in homely style  Then said "My house is grown so fine  Methinks I still would call it mine  I'm old and fain would live at ease  Make me the Parson if you please  He spoke and presently he feels  His grazier's coat fall down his heels  He sees yet hardly can believe  About each arm a pudding sleeve  His waistcoat to a cassock grew  And both assum'd a sable hue  But being old continu'd just  As threadbare and as full of dust  His talk was now of tythes and dues  He smoak'd his pipe and read the news  Knew how to preach old sermons next  Vamp'd in the preface and the text  At christ'nings well could act his part  And had the service all by heart  Wish'd women might have children fast  And thought whose sow had farrow'd last  Against Dissenters would repine  And stood up firm for right divine  Found his head fill'd with many a system  But classic authorshe ne'er miss'd 'em  Thus having furbish'd up a Parson  Dame Baucis next they play'd their farce on▪  Instead of homespun coifs were seen  Good pinners edg'd with Colberteen  Her petticoat transform'd apace  Became black sattin flounc'd with lace  Plain Goody would no longer down  'Twas Madam in her grogram gown  Philemon was in great surprize  And hardly could believe his eyes  Amaz'd to see her look so prim  And she admir'd as much at him  Thus happy in their change of life  Were several years this man and wife  When on a day which prov'd their last  Discoursing o'er old stories past  They went by chance amidst their talk  To the churchyard to take a walk  When Baucis hastily cry'd out  "My dear I see your forehead sprout"  "Sprout" quoth the man "what's this you tell us  I hope you don't believe me jealous  But yet methinks I feel it true  And really your's is budding too  Naynow I cannot stir my foot  It feels as if 'twere taking root"  Description would but tire my muse  In short they both were turn'd to Yews  Old Goodman Dobson of the Green  Remembers he the trees has seen  He'll talk of them from noon till night  And goes with folks to shew the sight  On Sundays after ev'ning pray'r  He gathers all the parish there  Points out the place of either Yew  Here Baucis there Philemon grew  Till once a parson of our town  To mend his barn cut Baucis down  At which 'tis hard to be believ'd  How much the other tree was griev'd  Grew scrubby dy'd atop was stunted  So the next parson stubb'd and burnt it  TO THE EARL OF WARWICK ON THE DEATH OF MR ADDISON  This elegy by Mr Tickell is one of the finest in our language there is so little new that can be said upon the death of a friend after the complaints of Ovid and the Latin Italians in this way that one is surprised to see so much novelty in this to strike us and so much interest to affect  IF dumb too long the drooping muse hath stay'd  And left her debt to Addison unpaid  Blame not her silence Warwick but bemoan  And judge oh judge my bosom by your own  What mourner ever felt poetic fires  Slow comes the verse that real woe inspires  Grief unaffected suits but ill with art  Or flowing numbers with a bleeding heart  Can I forget the dismal night that gave  My soul's best art for ever to the grave  How silent did his old companions tread  By midnight lamps the mansions of the dead  Thro' breathing statues then unheeded things  Thro' rows of warriors and thro' walks of kings  What awe did the slow solemn knell inspire  The pealing organ and the pausing choir  The duties by the lawnrob'd prelate pay'd  And the last words that dust to dust convey'd  While speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend  Accept these tears thou dear departed friend  Oh gone for ever take this long adieu  And sleep in peace next thy lov'd Montagu  To strew fresh laurels let the task be mine  A frequent pilgrim at thy sacred shrine  Mine with true sighs thy absence to bemoan  And grave with faithful epitaphs thy stone  If e'er from me thy lov'd memorial part  May shame afflict this alienated heart  Of thee forgetful if I form a song  My lyre be broken and untun'd my tongue  My grief be doubled from thy image free  And mirth a torment unchastis'd by thee  Oft let me range the gloomy isles alone  Sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown  Along the walls where speaking marbles show  What worthies form the hallow'd mould below  Proud names who once the reins of empire held  In arms who triumph'd or in arts excell'd  Chiefs grac'd with scars and prodigal of blood  Stern patriots who for sacred Freedom stood  Just men by whom impartial laws were given  And saints who taught and led the way to Heav'n  Ne'er to these chambers where the mighty rest  Since their foundation came a nobler guest  Nor e'er was to the bow'rs of bliss convey'd  A fairer spirit or more welcome shade  In what new region to the just assign'd  What new employments please th' unbody'd mind  A winged Virtue through th' etherial sky  From world to world unweary'd does he fly  Or curious trace the long laborious maze  Of Heaven's decrees where wond'ring angels gaze  Does he delight to hear bold seraphs tell  How Michael battel'd and the Dragon fell  Or mix'd with milder cherubim to glow  In hymns of love not ill essay'd below  Or dost thou warn poor mortals left behind  A task well suited to thy gentle mind  Oh if sometimes thy spotless form descend  To me thy aid thou guardian genius lend  When Rage misguides me or when Fear alarms  When Pain distresses or when Pleasure charms  In silent whisp'rings purer thoughts impart  And turn from ill a frail and feeble heart  Lead through the paths thy virtue trod before  Till Bliss shall join nor Death can part us more  That awful form which so ye Heav'ns decree  Must still be lov'd and still deplor'd by me  In nightly visions seldom fails to rise  Or rous'd by Fancy meets my waking eyes  If business calls or crowded courts invite  Th' unblemish'd statesman seems to strike my sight  If in the stage I seek to sooth my care  I meet his soul which breathes in Cato there  If pensive to the rural shades I rove  His shape o'ertakes me in the lonely grove  'Twas there of just and good he reason'd strong  Clear'd some great truth or rais'd some serious song  There patient show'd us the wise course to steer  A candid censor and a friend severe  There taught us how to live and oh too high  The price for knowledge taught us how to die  Thou hill whose brow the antique structures grace  Rear'd by bold chiefs of Warwick's noble race  Why once so lov'd when e'er thy bow'r appears  O'er my dim eyeballs glance the sudden tears  How sweet were once thy prospects fresh and fair  Thy sloping walks and unpolluted air  How sweet the glooms beneath thy aged trees  Thy noontide shadow and thy ev'ning breeze  His image thy forsaken bow'rs restore  Thy walks and airy prospects charm no more  No more the summer in thy glooms allay'd  Thy evening breezes and thy noonday shade  From other ills however Fortune frown'd  Some refuge in the muse's art I found  Reluctant now I touch the trembling string  Bereft of him who taught me how to sing  And these sad accents murmur'd o'er his urn  Betray that absence they attempt to mourn  O must I then now fresh my bosom bleeds  And Craggs in death to Addison succeeds  The verse begun to one lost friend prolong  And weep a second in th' unfinish'd song  These works divine which on his deathbed laid  To thee O Craggs th' expiring sage convey'd  Great but illomen'd monument of fame  Nor he surviv'd to give nor thou to claim  Swift after him thy social spirit flies  And close to his how soon thy coffin lies  Blest pair whose union future bards shall tell  In future tongues each other's boast farewel  Farewel whom join'd in fame in friendship try'd  No chance could sever nor the grave divide  COLIN AND LUCY A BALLAD  Through all Tickell's works there is a strain of balladthinking if I may so express it and in this professed ballad he seems to have surpassed himself It is perhaps the best in our language in this way  OF Leinster fam'd for maidens fair  Bright Lucy was the grace  Nor e'er did Liffy's limpid stream  Reflect so sweet a face  Till luckless love and pining care  Impair'd her rosy hue  Her coral lips and damask cheeks  And eyes of glossy blue  Oh have you seen a lily pale  When beating rains descend  So droop'd the slowconsuming maid  Her life now near its end  By Lucy warn'd of flatt'ring swains  Take heed ye easy fair  Of vengeance due to broken vows  Ye perjur'd swains beware  Three times all in the dead of night  A bell was heard to ring  And shrieking at her window thrice  The raven flapp'd his wing  Too well the lovelorn maiden knew  The solemn boding sound  And thus in dying words bespoke  The virgins weeping round  "I hear a voice you cannot hear  Which says I must not stay  I see a hand you cannot see  Which beckons me away  By a false heart and broken vows  In early youth I die  Was I to blame because his bride  Was thrice as rich as I  "Ah Colin give not her thy vows  Vows due to me alone  Nor thou fond maid receive his kiss  Nor think him all thy own  Tomorrow in the church to wed  Impatient both prepare  But know fond maid and know false man  That Lucy will be there  "Then bear my corse my comrades bear  This bridegroom blith to meet  He in his wedding trim so gay  I in my windingsheet"  She spoke she dy'd her corse was borne  The bridegroom blith to meet  He in his weddingtrim so gay  She in her windingsheet  Then what were perjur'd Colin's thoughts  How were these nuptials kept  The bridesmen flock'd round Lucy dead  And all the village wept  Confusion shame remorse despair  At once his bosom swell  The damps of death bedew'd his brow  He shook he groan'd he fell  From the vain bride ah bride no more  The varying crimson fled  When stretch'd before her rival's corse  She saw her husband dead  Then to his Lucy's newmade grave  Convey'd by trembling swains  One mould with her beneath one sod  For ever he remains  Oft at this grave the constant hind  And plighted maid are seen  With garlands gay and truelove knots  They deck the sacred green  But swain forsworn whoe'er thou art  This hallow'd spot forbear  Remember Colin's dreadful fate  And fear to meet him there  THE TEARS OF SCOTLAND WRITTEN IN THE YEAR MDCCXLVI  This ode by Dr Smellet does rather more honour to the author's feelings than his taste The mechanical part with regard to numbers and language is not so perfect as so short a work as this requires but the pathetic it contains particularly in the last stanza but one is exquisitely fine  I  MOURN hapless Caledonia mourn  Thy banish'd peace thy laurels torn  Thy sons for valour long renown'd  Lie slaughter'd on their native ground  Thy hospitable roofs no more  Invite the stranger to the door  In smoaky ruins sunk they lie  The monuments of cruelty  II  The wretched owner sees afar  His all become the prey of war  Bethinks him of his babes and wife  Then smites his breast and curses life  Thy swains are famish'd on the rocks  Where once they fed their wanton flocks  Thy ravish'd virgins shriek in vain  Thy infants perish on the plain  III  What boots it then in ev'ry clime  Thro' the widespreading waste of time  Thy martial glory crown'd with praise  Still shone with undiminish'd blaze  Thy tow'ring spirit now is broke  Thy neck is bended to the yoke  What foreign arms could never quell  By civil rage and rancour fell  IV  The rural pipe and merry lay  No more shall chear the happy day  No social scenes of gay delight  Beguile the dreary winter night  No strains but those of sorrow flow  And nought be heard but sounds of woe  While the pale phantoms of the slain  Glide nightly o'er the silent plain  V  Oh baneful cause oh fatal morn  Accurs'd to ages yet unborn  The sons against their fathers stood  The parent shed his children's blood  Yet when the rage of battle ceas'd  The victor's soul was not appeas'd  The naked and forlorn must feel  Devouring flames and murd'ring steel  VI  The pious mother doom'd to death  Forsaken wanders o'er the heath  The bleak wind whistles round her head  Her helpless orphans cry for bread  Bereft of shelter food and friend  She views the shades of night descend  And stretch'd beneath th' inclement skies  Weeps o'er her tender babes and dies  VII  Whilst the warm blood bedews my veins  And unimpair'd remembrance reigns  Resentment of my country's fate  Within my filial breast shall beat  And spite of her insulting foe  My sympathizing verse shall flow  "Mourn hapless Caledonia mourn  "Thy banish'd peace thy laurels torn"  ON THE DEATH OF THE LORD PROTECTOR  Our poetry was not quite harmonized in Waller's time so that this which would be now looked upon as a slovenly sort of versification was with respect to the times in which it was written almost a prodigy of harmony A modern reader will chiefly be struck with the strength of thinking and the turn of the compliments bestowed upon the usurper Every body has heard the answer our poet made Charles II who asked him how his poem upon Cromwell came to be finer than his panegyric upon himself "Your majesty" replies Waller "knows that poets always succeed best in fiction"  WE must resign Heav'n his great soul does claim  In storms as loud as his immortal fame  His dying groans his last breath shakes our isle  And trees uncut fall for his fun'ral pile  About his palace their broad roots are tost  Into the airSo Romulus was lost  New Rome in such a tempest miss'd her king  And from obeying fell to worshipping  On Oeta's top thus Hercules lay dead  With ruin'd oaks and pines about him spread  The poplar too whose bough he wont to wear  On his victorious head lay prostrate there  Those his last fury from the mountain rent  Our dying hero from the continent  Ravish'd whole towns and forts from Spaniards reft  As his last legacy to Britain left  The ocean which so long our hopes confin'd  Could give no limits to his vaster mind  Our bounds' enlargement was his latest toil  Nor hath he left us pris'ners to our isle  Under the tropic is our language spoke  And part of Flanders hath receiv'd our yoke  From civil broils he did us disengage  Found nobler objects for our martial rage  And with wise conduct to his country show'd  The antient way of conq'ring abroad  Ungrateful then if we no tears allow  To him that gave us peace and empire too  Princes that fear'd him grieve concern'd to see  No pitch of glory from the grave is free  Nature herself took notice of his death  And sighing swell'd the sea with such a breath  That to remotest shores her billows roll'd  Th' approaching fate of their great ruler told  THE STORY OF PHOEBUS AND DAPHNE APPLIED  The French claim this as belonging to them To whomsoever it belongs the thought is finely turned  THYRSIS a youth of the inspired train  Fair Sacharissa lov'd but lov'd in vain  Like Phoebus sung the no less amorous boy  Like Daphne she as lovely and as coy  With numbers he the flying nymph pursues  With numbers such as Phoebus' self might use  Such is the chase when love and fancy leads  O'er craggy mountains and thro' flow'ry meads  Invok'd to testify the lover's care  Or form some image of his cruel fair  Urg'd with his fury like a wounded deer  O'er these he fled and now approaching near  Had reach'd the nymph with his harmonious lay  Whom all his charms could not incline to stay  Yet what he sung in his immortal strain  Though unsuccessful was not sung in vain  All but the nymph that should redress his wrong  Attend his passion and approve his song  Like Phoebus thus acquiring unsought praise  He catch'd at love and fill'd his arms with bays  NIGHT THOUGHTS BY DR YOUNG  These seem to be the best of the collection from whence only the two first are taken They are spoken of differently either with exaggerated applause or contempt as the reader's disposition is either turned to mirth or melancholy  NIGHT THE FIRST ON LIFE DEATH AND IMMORTALITY  TIR'D Nature's sweet restorer balmy Sleep  He like the world his ready visit pays  Where Fortune smiles the wretched he forsakes  Swift on his downy pinions flies from woe  And lights on lids unsully'd with a tear  From short as usual and disturb'd repose  I wake how happy they who wake no more  Yet that were vain if dreams infest the grave  I wake emerging from a sea of dreams  Tumultuous where my wreck'd desponding thought  From wave to wave of fancy'd misery  At random drove her helm of Reason lost  Tho' now restor'd 'tis only change of pain  A bitter change severer for severe  The Day too short for my distress and Night  Ev'n in the zenith of her dark domain  Is sunshine to the colour of my fate  Night sable goddess from her ebon throne  In rayless majesty now stretches forth  Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumb'ring world  Silence how dead and Darkness how profound  Nor eye nor list'ning ear an object finds  Creation sleeps 'Tis as the gen'ral pulse  Of Life stood still and Nature made a pause  An awful pause prophetic of her end  And let her prophecy be soon fulfill'd  Fate drop the curtain I can lose no more  Silence and Darkness solemn sisters twins  From antient Night who nurse the tender thought  To Reason and on Reason build Resolve  That column of true majesty in man  Assist me I will thank yon in the grave  The grave your kingdom there this frame shall fall  A victim sacred to your dreary shrine  But what are ye  Thou who didst put to flight  Primaeval Silence when the morning stars  Exulting shouted o'er the rising ball  O thou whose word from solid Darkness struck  That spark the sun strike wisdom from my soul  My soul which flies to thee her trust her treasure  As misers to their gold while others rest  Thro' this opaque of Nature and of Soul  This double night transmit one pitying ray  To lighten and to chear O lead my mind  A mind that fain would wander from its woe  Lead it thro' various scenes of life and death  And from each scene the noblest truths inspire  Nor less inspire my conduct than my song  Teach my best reason reason my best will  Teach rectitude and fix my firm resolve  Wisdom to wed and pay her long arrear  Nor let the phial of thy vengeance pour'd  On this devoted head be pour'd in vain  The bell strikes One We take no note of time  But from its loss To give it then a tongue  Is wise in man As if an an angel spoke  I feel the solemn sound If heard aright  It is the knell of my departed hours  Where are they With the years beyond the flood  It is the signal that demands dispatch  How much is to be done My hopes and fears  Start up alarm'd and o'er life's narrow verge  Look downOn what A fathomless abyss  A dread eternity How surely mine  And can eternity belong to me  Poor pensioner on the bounties of an hour  How poor how rich how abject how august  How complicate how wonderful is man  How passing wonder He who made him such  Who centred in our make such strange extremes  From diff'rent natures marvelously mixt  Connexion exquisite of distant worlds  Distinguisht link in Being's endless chain  Midway from Nothing to the Deity  A beam ethereal sully'd and absorpt  Tho' sully'd and dishonour'd still divine  Dim miniature of greatness absolute  An heir of glory A frail child of dust  Helpless immortal Insect infinite  A worm a GodI tremble at myself  And in myself am lost At home a stranger  Thought wanders up and down surpriz'd aghast  And wond'ring at her own how Reason reels  O what a miracle to man is man  Triumphantly distress'd what joy what dread  Alternately transported and alarm'd  What can preserve my life or what destroy  An angel's arm can't snatch me from the grave  Legions of angels can't confine me there  'Tis past conjecture all things rise in proof  While o'er my limbs Sleep's soft dominion spread  What tho' my soul phantastic measures trod  O'er fairy fields or mourn'd along the gloom  Of pathless woods or down the craggy steep  Hurl'd headlong swam with pain the mantled pool  Or scal'd the cliff or danc'd on hollow winds  With antic shapes wild natives of the brain  Her ceaseless flight tho' devious speaks her nature  Of subtler essence than the trodden clod  Active aërial tow'ring unconfin'd  Unfetter'd with her gross companion's fall  Ev'n silent Night proclaims my soul immortal  Ev'n silent Night proclaims eternal day  For human weal Heav'n hustands all events  Dull sleep instructs nor sport vain dreams in vain  Why then their loss deplore that are not loft  Why wanders wretched Thought their tombs around  In infidel distress Are angels there  Slumbers rak'd up in dust ethereal fire  They live they greatly live a life on earth  Unkindled unconceiv'd and from an eye  Of tenderness let heav'nly pity fall  On me more justly number'd with the dead  This is the desert this the solitude  How populous how vital is the grave  This is Creation's melancholy vault  The vale funereal the sad cypress gloom  The land of apparitions empty shades  All all on earth is shadow all beyond  Is substance the reverse is Folly's creed  How solid all where change shall be no more  This is the bud of Being the dim dawn  The twilight of our day the vestibule  Life's theatre as yet is shut and Death  Strong Death alone can heave the massy bar  This gross impediment of clay remove  And make us embryos of existence free  From real life but little more remote  Is he not yet a candidate for light  The future embryo slumb'ring in his sire  Embryos we must be till we burst the shell  Yon ambient azure shell and spring to life  The life of gods O transport and of man  Yet man fool man here buries all his thoughts  Inters celestial hope without one sigh  Pris'ner of earth and pent beneath the Moon  Here pinions all his wishes wing'd by Heav'n  To fly at infinite and reach it there  Where seraphs gather immortality  On Life's fair tree fast by the throne of God  What golden joys ambrosial clust'ring glow  In His full beam and ripen for the just  Where momentary ages are no more  Where Time and Pain and Chance and Death expire  And is it in the flight of threescore years  To push Eternity from human thought  And smother souls immortal in the dust  A soul immortal spending all her fires  Wasting her strength in strenuous idleness  Thrown into tumult raptur'd or alarm'd  At ought this scene can threaten or indulge  Resembles Ocean into tempest wrought  To waft a feather or to drown a fly  Where falls this censure It o'erwhelms myself  How was my heart incrusted by the world  O how selffetter'd was my grov'ling soul  How like a worm was I wrapt round and round  In silken thought which reptile Fancy spun  Till darken'd Reason lay quite clouded o'er  With soft conceit of endless comfort here  Nor yet put forth her wings to reach the skies  Nightvisions may befriend as sung above  Our waking dreams are fatal How I dreamt  Of things impossible Could Sleep do more  Of joys perpetual in perpetual change  Of stable pleasures on the tossing wave  Eternal sunshine in the storms of life  How richly were my noontide trances hung  With gorgeous tapestries of pictur'd joys  Joy behind joy in endless perspective  Till at Death's toll whose restless iron tongue  Calls daily for his millions at a meal  Starting I woke and found myself undone  Where now my phrensy's pompous furniture  The cobwebb'd cottage with its ragged wall  Of mould'ring mud is royalty to me  The spider's most attenuated thread  Is cord is cable to man's tender tie  On earthly bliss it breaks at ev'ry breeze  O ye blest scenes of permanent delight  Full above measure lasting beyond bound  A perpetuity of bliss is bliss  Could you so rich in rapture fear an end  That ghastly thought would drink up all your joy  And quite unparadise the realms of light  Safe are you lodg'd above these rolling spheres  The baleful Influence of whose giddy dance  Sheds sad vicissitude on all beneath  Here teems with revolutions ev'ry hour  And rarely for the better or the best  More mortal than the common births of Fate  Each moment has its sickle emulous  Of Time's enormous scythe whose ample sweep  Strikes empires from the root each moment plays  His little weapon in the narrower sphere  Of sweet domestic comfort and cuts down  The fairest bloom of sublunary bliss  Bliss sublunary blissProud words and vain  Implicit treason to divine decree  A bold invasion of the rights of Heav'n  I clasp'd the phantoms and I found them air  O had I weigh'd it e'er my fond embrace  What darts of agony had miss'd my heart  Death Great proprietor of all 'tis thine  To tread out empire and to quench the stars  The sun himself by thy permission shines  And one day thou shalt pluck him from his sphere  Amid such mighty plunder why exhaust  Thy partial quiver on a mark so mean  Why thy peculiar rancour wreak'd on me  Insatiate archer could not one suffice  Thy shaft flew thrice and thrice my peace was slain  And thrice ere thrice yon moon had fill'd her horn  O Cynthia why so pale Dost thou lament  Thy wretched neighbour Grieve to see thy wheel  Of ceaseless change outwhirl'd in human life  How wanes my borrow'd bliss from Fortune's smile  Precarious courtesy Not Virtue's sure  Selfgiven solar ray of sound delight  In ev'ry vary'd posture place and hour  How widow'd ev'ry thought of ev'ry joy  Thought busy thought too busy for my peace  Thro' the dark postern of time long elaps'd  Led softly by the stillness of the night  Led like a murderer and such it proves  Strays wretched rover o'er the pleasing past  In quest of wretchedness perversely strays  And finds all desart now and meets the ghosts  Of my departed joys a num'rous train  I rue the riches of my former fate  Sweet Comfort's blasted clusters I lament  I tremble at the blessings once so dear  And ev'ry pleasure pains me to the heart  Yet why complain or why complain for one  Hangs out the sun his lustre but for me  The single man Are angels all beside  I mourn for millions 'tis the common lot  In this shape or in that has fate entail'd  The mother's throes on all of woman born  Not more the children than sure heirs of pain  War famine pest volcano storm and fire  Intestine broils Oppression with her heart  Wrapt up in triple brass besiege mankind  God's image disinherited of day  Here plung'd in mines forgets a sun was made  There beings deathless as their haughty lord  Are hammer'd to the galling ore for life  And plow the winter's wave and reap despair  Some for hard masters broken under arms  In battle lopt away with half their limbs  Beg bitter bread thro' realms their valour sav'    If so the tyrant or his minion doom  Want and incurable Disease fell pair  On hopeless multitudes remorseless seize  At once and make a refuge of the grave  How groaning hospitals eject their dead  What numbers groan for sad admission there  What numbers once in Fortune's lap highsed  Solicit the cold hand of Charity  To shock us more solicit it in vain  Ye silken sons of Pleasure since in pains  You rue more modish visits visit here  And breathe from your debauch give and reduce  Surfeit's dominion o'er you but so great  Your impudence you blush at what is right  Happy did Sorrow seize on such alone  Not Prudence can defend or Virtue save  Disease invades the chastest temperance  And punishment the guiltless and Alarm  Thro' thickest shades pursues the fond of peace  Man's caution often into danger turns  And his guard falling crushes him to death  Not Happiness itself makes good her name  Our very wishes give us not our wish  How distant oft the thing we doat on most  From that for which we doat Felicity  The smoothest course of Nature has its pains  And truest friends thro' error wound our rest  Without Misfortune what calamities  And what hostilities without a foe  Nor are foes wanting to the best on earth  But endless is the list of human ills  And sighs might sooner fail than cause to sigh  A part how small of the terraqueous globe  Is tenanted by man the rest a waste  Rocks desarts frozen seas and burning sands  Wild haunts of monsters poisons stings and death  Such is Earth's melancholy map But far  More sad this earth is a true map of man  So bounded are its haughty lord's delights  To Woe's wide empire where deep Troubles toss  Loud Sorrows howl invenom'd Passions bite  Rav'nous Calamities our vitals seize  And threat'ning Fate wide opens to devour  What then am I who sorrow for myself  In age in infancy from others aid  Is all our hope to teach us to be kind  That Nature's first last lesson to mankind  The selfish heart deserves the pain it feels  More gen'rous sorrow while it sinks exalts  And conscious Virtue mitigates the pang  Nor Virtue more than Prudence bids me give  Swoln Thought a second channel who divide  They weaken too the torrent of their grief  Take then O World thy muchindebted tear  How sad a sight is human happiness  To those whose thought can pierce beyond an hour  O thou whate'er thou art whose heart exults  Wouldst thou I should congratulate thy fate  I know thou wouldst thy pride demands it from me  Let thy pride pardon what thy nature needs  The salutary censure of a friend  Thou happy wretch by blindness thou art blest  By dotage dandled to perpetual smiles  Know smiler at thy peril art thou pleas'd  Thy pleasure is the promise of thy pain  Misfortune like a creditor severe  But rises in demand for her delay  She makes a scourge of past prosperity  To sting thee more and double thy distress  Lorenzo Fortune makes her court to thee  Thy fond heart dances while the syren sings  Dear is thy welfare think me not unkind  I would not damp but to secure thy joys  Think not that Fear is sacred to the storm  Stand on thy guard against the smiles of Fate  Is Heav'n tremendous in its frowns Most sure  And in its favours formidable too  Its favours here are trials not rewards  A call to duty not discharge from care  And should alarm us full as much as woes  Awake us to their cause and consequence  And make us tremble weigh'd with our desert  Awe Nature's tumult and chastize her joys  Lest while we clasp we kill them nay invert  To worse than simple misery their charms  Revolted joys like foes in civil war  Like bosom friendships to resentment sour'd  With rage invenom'd rise against our peace  Beware what earth calls happiness beware  All joys but joys that never can expire  Who builds on less than an immortal base  Fond as he seems condemns his joys to death  Mine dy'd with thee Philander thy last sigh  Dissolv'd the charm the disinchanted earth  Lost all her lustre Where her glitt'ring towers  Her golden mountains where all darken'd down  To naked waste a dreary vale of tears  The great magician's dead Thou poor pale piece  Of outcast earth in darkness what a change  From yesterday thy darling hope so near  Longlabour'd prize O how ambition flush'd  Thy glowing cheek Ambition truly great  Of virtuous praise Death's subtle seed within  Sly treach'rous miner working in the dark  Smil'd at thy wellconcerted scheme and beckon'd  The worm to riot on that rose so red  Unfaded ere it fell one moment's prey  Man's foresight is conditionally wise  Lorenzo Wisdom into Folly turns  Oft the first instant its idea fair  To labouring thought is born How dim our eye  The present moment terminates our sight  Clouds thick as those on Doomsday drown the next  We penetrate we prophesy in vain  Time is dealt out by particles and each  Ere mingled with the streaming sands of life  By Fate's inviolable oath is sworn  Deep silence "Where Eternity begins"  By Nature's law what may be may be now  There's no prerogative in human hours  In human hearts what bolder thought can rise  Than man's presumption on tomorrow's dawn  Where is tomorrow In another world  For numbers this is certain the reverse  Is sure to none and yet on this perhaps  This peradventure infamous for lyes  As on a rock of adamant we build  Our mountain hopes spin our eternal schemes  As we the fatal sisters would outspin  And big with life's futurities expire  Not ev'n Philander had bespoke his shroud  Nor had he cause a warning was deny'd  How many fall as sudden not as safe  As sudden tho' for years admonisht home  Of human ills the last extreme beware  Beware Lorenzo a slowsudden death  How dreadful that deliberate surprize  Be wise today 'tis madness to defer  Next day the fatal precedent will plead  Thus on till Wisdom is push'd out of life  Procrastination is the thief of time  Year after year it steals till all is fled  And to the mercies of a moment leaves  The vast concerns of an eternal scene  If not so frequent would not this be strange  That 'tis so frequent this is stranger still  Of man's miraculous mistakes this bears  The palm "That all men are about to live"  For ever on the brink of being born  All pay themselves the compliment to think  They one day shall not drivel and their pride  On this reversion takes up ready praise  At least their own their future selves applauds  How excellent that life they ne'er will lead  Time lodg'd in their own hands is Folly's vails  That lodg'd in Fate's to Wisdom they consign  The thing they can't but purpose they postpone  'Tis not in Folly not to scorn a fool  And scarce in human wisdom to do more  All promise is poor dilatory man  And that thro' ev'ry stage when young indeed  In full content we sometimes nobly rest  Unanxious for ourselves and only wish  As duteous sons our fathers were more wise  At thirty man suspects himself a fool  Knows it at forty and reforms his plan  At fifty chides his infamous delay  Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve  In all the magnanimity of thought  Resolves and reresolves then dies the same  And why Because he thinks himself immortal  All men think all men mortal but themselves  Themselves when some alarming shock of Fate  Strikes thro' their wounded hearts the sudden dread  But their hearts wounded like the wounded air  Soon close where pass'd the shaft no trace is found  As from the wing no scar the sky retains  The parted wave no furrow from the keel  So dies in human hearts the thought of death  Ev'n with the tender tear which Nature sheds  O'er those we love we drop it in their grave  Can I forget Philander That were strange  O my full heartBut should I give it vent  The longest night tho' longer far would fail  And the lark listen to my midnight song  The sprightly lark's shrill matin wakes the morn  Grief's sharpest thorn hard pressing on my breast  I strive with wakeful melody to chear  The sullen gloom sweet Philomel like thee  And call the stars to listen ev'ry star  Is deaf to mine enamour'd of thy lay  Yet be not vain there are who thine excel  And charm thro' distant ages wrapt in shade  Pris'ner of darkness to the silent hours  How often I repeat their rage divine  To lull my griefs and steal my heart from woe  I roll their raptures but not catch their fire  Dark tho' not blind like thee Maeonides  Or Milton thee ah could I reach your strain  Or his who made Maeonides our own  Man too he sung immortal man I sing  Oft bursts my song beyond the bounds of life  What now but immortality can please  O had he press'd his theme pursu'd the track  Which opens out of darkness into day  O had he mounted on his wing of fire  Soar'd where I sink and sung immortal man  How had it bless'd mankind and rescu'd me  NIGHT THE SECOND ON TIME DEATH FRIENDSHIP  "WHEN the cock crew he wept"Smote by that eye  Which looks on me on all that Pow'r who bids  This midnight centinel with clarion shrill  Emblem of that which shall awake the dead  Rouse souls from slumber into thoughts of Heaven  Shall I too weep Where then is Fortitude  And Fortitude abandon'd where is man  I know the terms on which he sees the light  He that is born is listed life is war  Eternal war with Woe Who bears it best  Deserves it leastOn other themes I'll dwell  Lorenzo let me turn my thoughts on thee  And thine on themes may profit profit there  Where most thy need Themes too the genuine growth  Of dear Philander's dust He thus tho' dead  May still befriendWhat themes Time's wond'rous Price  Death Friendship and Philander's final scene  So could I touch these themes as might obtain  Thine ear nor leave thy heart quite disengag'd  The good deed would delight me halfimpress  On my dark cloud an Iris and from Grief  Call GloryDost thou mourn Philander's fate  I know thou say'st it says thy life the same  He mourns the dead who lives as they desire  Where is that thrift that avarice of Time  O glorious avarice thought of Death inspires  As rumour'd robberies endear our gold  O Time than gold more sacred more a load  Than lead to fools and fools reputed wise  What moment granted man without account  What years are squander'd Wisdom's debt unpaid  Our wealth in days all due to that discharge  Haste haste he lies in wait he's at the door  Insidious Death should his strong hand arrest  No composition sets the pris'ner free  Eternity's inexorable chain  Fast binds and Vengeance claims the full arrear  How late I shudder'd on the brink how late  Life call'd for her last refuge in despair  That Time is mine O Mead to thee I owe  Fain would I pay thee with eternity  But ill my genius answers my desire  My sickly song is mortal past thy cure  Accept the willthat dies not with my strain  For what calls thy disease Lorenzo Not  For Esculapian but for moral aid  Thou think'st it folly to be wise too soon  Youth is not rich in Time it may be poor  Part with it as with money sparing pay  No moment but in purchase of its worth  And what its worth ask deathbeds they can tell  Part with it as with life reluctant big  With holy hope of nobler time to come  Time higheraim'd still nearer the great mark  Of men and angels virtue more divine  Is this our duty wisdom glory gain  These Heav'n benign in vital union binds  And sport we like the natives of the bough  When vernal suns inspire Amusement reigns  Man's great demand to trifle is to live  And is it then a trifle too to die  Thou say'st I preach Lorenzo 'Tis confest  What if for once I preach thee quite awake  Who wants amusement in the flame of battle  Is it not treason to the soul immortal  Her foes in arms eternity the prize  Will toys amuse when med'cines cannot cure  When spirits ebb when Life's enchanting scenes  Their lustre lose and lessen in our sight  As lands and cities with their glitt'ring spires  To the poor shatter'd bark by sudden storm  Thrown off to sea and soon to perish there  Will toys amuse No thrones will then be toys  And earth and skies seem dust upon the scale  Redeem we timeIts loss we dearly buy  What pleads Lorenzo for his highpriz'd sports  He pleads Time's num'rous blanks he loudly pleads  The strawlike trifles on Life's common stream  From whom those blanks and trifles but from thee  No blank no trifle Nature made or meant  Virtue or purpos'd virtue still be thine  This cancels thy complaint at once this leaves  In act no trifle and no blank in time  This greatens fills immortalizes all  This the blest art of turning all to gold  This the good heart's prerogative to raise  A royal tribute from the poorest hours  Immense revenue ev'ry moment pays  If nothing more than purpose in thy pow'r  Thy purpose firm is equal to the deed  Who does the best his circumstance allows  Does well acts nobly angels could no more  Our outward act indeed admits restraint  'Tis not in things o'er Thought to domineer  Guard well thy thought our thoughts are heard in Heaven  On all important Time thro' ev'ry age  Tho' much and warm the wise have urg'd the man  Is yet unborn who duly weighs an hour  "I've lost a day"The prince who nobly cry'd  Had been an emperor without his crown  Of Rome Say rather lord of human race  He spoke as if deputed by mankind  So should all speak so Reason speaks in all  From the soft whispers of that God in man  Why fly to Folly why to phrensy fly  For rescue from the blessings we possess  Time the supremeTime is Eternity  Pregnant with all Eternity can give  Pregnant with all that makes archangels smile  Who murders Time he crushes in the birth  A pow'r ethereal only not ador'd  Ah how unjust to Nature and himself  Is thoughtless thankless inconsistent man  Like children babbling nonsense in their sports  We censure Nature for a span too short  That span too short we tax as tedious too  Torture invention all expedients tire  To lash the ling'ring moments into speed  And whirl us happy riddance from ourselves  Art brainless Art our furious charioteer  For Nature's voice unstifled would recall  Drives headlong tow'rds the precipice of Death  Death most our dread Death thus more dreadful made  O what a riddle of absurdity  Leisure is pain takes off our chariotwheels  How heavily we drag the load of life  Blest Leisure is our curse like that of Cain  It makes us wander wander earth around  To fly that tyrant Thought As Atlas groan'd  The world beneath we groan beneath an hour  We cry for mercy to the next amusement  The next amusement mortgages our fields  Slight inconvenience Prisons hardly frown  From hateful Time if prisons set us free  Yet when Death kindly tenders us relief  We call him cruel years to moments shrink  Ages to years The telescope is turn'd  To man's false optics from his folly false  Time in advance behind him hides his wings  And seems to creep decrepit with his age  Behold him when past by what then is seen  But his broad pinions swifter than the winds  And all mankind in contradiction strong  Rueful aghast cry out on his career  Leave to thy foes these errors and these ills  To Nature just their cause and cure explore  Not short Heav'n's bounty boundless our expence  No niggard Nature men are prodigals  We waste not use our time we breathe not live  Time wasted is existence us'd is life  And bare existence man to live ordain'd  Wrings and oppresses with enormous weight  And why since Time was giv'n for use not waste  Injoin'd to fly with tempest tide and stars  To keep his speed nor ever wait for man  Time's use was doom'd a pleasure waste a pain  That man might feel his error if unseen  And feeling fly to labour for his cure  Not blund'ring split on idleness for ease  Life's cares are comforts such by Heav'n design'd  He that has none must make them or be wretched  Cares are employments and without employ  The soul is on the rack the rack of rest  To souls most adverse action all their joy  Here then the riddle mark'd above unfolds  Then Time turns torment when man turns a fool  We rave we wrestle with great Nature's plan  We thwart the Deity and 'tis decreed  Who thwart his will shall contradict their own  Hence our unnatural quarrel with ourselves  Our thoughts at enmity our bosombroil  We push Time from us and we wish him back  Lavish of lustrums and yet fond of life  Life we think long and short Death seek and shun  Body and soul like peevish man and wife  United jar and yet are loth part  Oh the dark days of Vanity while here  How tasteless and how terrible when gone  Gone they ne'er go when past they haunt us still  The spirit walks of ev'ry day deceas'd  And smiles an angel or a fury frowns  Nor death nor life delight us If Time past  And Time possest both pain us what can please  That which the Deity to please ordain'd  Time us'd The man who consecrates his hours  By vigorous effort and an honest aim  At once he draws the sting of Life and Death  He walks with Nature and her paths are peace  Our error's cause and cure are seen see next  Time's nature origin importance speed  And thy great gain from urging his career  Allsensual man because untouch'd unseen  He looks on Time as nothing Nothing else  Is truly man's 'tis Fortune'sTime's a God  Hast thou ne'er heard of Time's omnipotence  For or against what wonders can he do  And will to stand blank neuter he disdains  Not on those terms was Time Heav'n's stranger sent  On his important embassy to man  Lorenzo no on the longdestin'd hour  From everlasting ages growing ripe  That memorable hour of wond'rous birth  When the Dread Sire on emanation bent  And big with Nature rising in his might  Call'd forth Creation for then Time was born  By Godhead streaming thro' a thousand worlds  Not on those terms from the great days of Heaven  From old Eternity's mysterious orb  Was Time cut off and cast beneath the skies  The skies which watch him in his new abode  Measuring his motions by revolving spheres  That horologe machinery divine  Hours days and months and years his children play  Like num'rous wings around him as he flies  Or rather as unequal plumes they shape  His ample pinions swift as darted flame  To gain his goal to reach his antient rest  And join anew Eternity his sire  In his immutability to nest  When worlds that count his circles now unhing'd  Fate the loud signal sounding headlong rush  To timeless Night and Chaos whence they rose  Why spur the speedy Why with levities  Newwing thy short short day's too rapid flight  Know'st thou or what thou dost or what is done  Man flies from Time and Time from Man too soon  In sad divorce this double flight must end  And then where are we where Lorenzo then  Thy sports thy pompsI grant thee in a state  Not unambitious in the ruffled shroud  Thy Parian tomb's triumphant arch beneath  Has Death his fopperies Then well may Life  Put on her plume and in her rainbow shine  Ye wellarray'd Ye lilies of our land  Ye lilies male who neither toil nor spin  As sister lilies might if not so wise  As Solomon more sumptuous to the sight  Ye delicate who nothing can support  Yourselves most insupportable for whom  The winter rose must blow the Sun put on  A brighter beam in Leo silkysoft  Favonius breathe still softer or be chid  And other worlds send odours sawce and song  And robes and notions fram'd in foreign looms  O ye Lorenzo's of our age who deem  One moment unamus'd a misery  Not made for feeble man who call aloud  For ev'ry bawble drivell'd o'er by sense  For rattles and conceits of ev'ry cast  For change of follies and relays of joy  To drag your patient thro' the tedious length  Of a short winter's daysay sages say  Wit's oracles say dreamers of gay dreams  How will you weather an eternal night  Where such expedients fail  O treach'rous Conscience while she seems to sleep  On rose and myrtle lull'd with syren song  While she seems nodding o'er her charge to drop  On headlong Appetite the slacken'd rein  And give us up to Licence unrecall'd  Unmark'dSee from behind her secret stand  The sly informer minutes ev'ry fault  And her dread diary with horror fills  Not the gross act alone employs her pen  She reconnoitres Fancy's airy band  A watchful foe The formidable spy  List'ning o'erhears the whispers of our camp  Our dawning purposes of heart explores  And steals our embryos of iniquity  As all rapacious usurers conceal  Their doomsdaybook from allconsuming heirs  Thus with indulgence most severe she treats  Us spendthrifts of inestimable Time  Unnoted notes each moment misapply'd  In leaves more durable than leaves of brass  Writes our whole history which Death shall read  In ev'ry pale delinquent's private ear  And Judgment publish publish to more worlds  Than this and endless age in groans resound  Lorenzo such that sleeper in thy breast  Such is her slumber and her vengeance such  For slighted counsel such thy future peace  And think'st thou still thou can'st be wise too soon  But why on Time so lavish is my song  On this great theme kind Nature keeps a school  To teach her sons herself Each night we die  Each morn are born anew each day a life  And shall we kill each day If Trifling kills  Sure Vice must butcher O what heaps of slain  Cry out for vengeance on us Time destroy'd  Is suicide where more than blood is spilt  Time flies Death urges knells call Heaven invites  Hell threatens all exerts in effort all  More than Creation laboursLabours more  And is there in Creation what amidst  This tumult universal wing'd Dispatch  And ardent Energy supinely yawns  Man sleeps and man alone and man whose fate  Fate irreversible intire extreme  Endless hairhung breeze shaken o'er the gulph  A moment trembles drops and man for whom  All else is in alarm man the sole cause  Of this surrounding storm And yet he sleeps  As the storm rock'd to restThrow years away  Throw empires and be blameless Moments seize  Heav'n's on their wing a moment we may wish  When worlds want wealth to buy Bid Day stand still▪  Bid him drive back his car and reimport  The period past Regive the given hour  Lorenzo more than miracles we want  LorenzoO for yesterdays to come  Such is the language of the man awake  His ardour such for what oppresses thee  And is his ardour vain Lorenzo No  That more than miracle the gods indulge  Today is yesterday return'd return'd  Fullpower'd to cancel expiate raise adorn  And reinstate us on the rock of Peace  Let it not share its predecessor's fate  Nor like its elder sisters die a fool  Shall it evaporate in fume Fly off  Fuliginous and stain us deeper still  Shall we be poorer for the plenty pour'd  More wretched for the clemencies of Heaven  Where shall I find HimAngels tell me where  You know him he is near you point him out  Shall I see glories beaming from his brow  Or trace his footsteps by the rising flowers  Your golden wings now hov'ring o'er him shed  Protection now are waving in applause  To that blest son of Foresight lord of Fate  That awful independent on Tomorrow  Whose work is done who triumphs in the past  Whose Yesterdays look backwards with a smile  Nor like the Parthian wound him as they fly  That common but opprobrious lot Past hours  If not by guilt yet wound us by their flight  If Folly bounds our prospect by the grave  All feeling of Futurity benumb'd  All godlike passions for eternals quencht  All relish of realities expir'd  Renounc'd all correspondence with the skies  Our freedom chain'd quite wingless our desire  In Sense darkprison'd all that ought to soar  Prone to the centre crawling in the dust  Dismounted ev'ry great and glorious aim  Embruted ev'ry faculty divine  Heartbury'd in the rubbish of the world  The world that gulph of souls immortal souls  Souls elevate angelic wing'd with fire  To reach the distant skies and triumph there  On thrones which shall not mourn their masters chang'd  Tho' we from earth ethereal they that fell  Such veneration due O man to man  Who venerate themselves the world despise  For what gay friend is this escutcheon'd world  Which hangs out Death in one eternal night  A night that glooms us in the noodtide ray  And wraps our thought at banquets in the shroud  Life's little stage is a small eminence  Inchhigh the grave above that home of man  Where dwells the multitude we gaze around  We read their monuments we sigh and while  We sigh we sink and are what we deplor'd  Lamenting or lamented all our lot  Is Death at distance No he has been on thee  And giv'n sure earnest of his final blow  Those Hours which lately smil'd where are they now  Pallid to Thought and ghastly drown'd all drown'd  In that great deep which nothing disembogues  And dying they bequeath'd thee small renown  The rest are on the wing how fleet their flight  Already has the fatal train took fire  A moment and the world's blown up to thee  The Sun is darkness and the stars are dust  'Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours  And ask them what report they bore to Heaven  And how they might have borne more welcome news  Their answers form what men Experience call  If Wisdom's friend her best if not worst foe  O reconcile them kind Experience cries  "There's nothing here buy what as nothing weighs  "The more our joy the more we know it vain  "And by Success are tutor'd to Despair"  Nor is it only thus but must be so  Who knows not this tho' grey is still a child  Loose then from Earth the grasp of fond Desire  Weigh anchor and some happier clime explore  Art thou so moor'd thou can'st not disengage  Nor give thy thoughts a ply to future scenes  Since by Life's passing breath blown up from Earth  Light as the Summer's dust we take in air  A moment's giddy flight and fall again  Join the dull mass increase the trodden soil  And sleep till Earth herself shall be no more  Since then as emmets their small world o'erthrown  We sore amaz'd from out Earth's ruins crawl  And rise to fate extreme of foul or fair  As man's own choice controuler of the skies  As man's despotic will perhaps one hour  O how omnipotent is Time decrees  Should not each warning give a strong alarm  Warning far less than that of bosom torn  From bosom bleeding o'er the sacred dead  Should not each dial strike us as we pass  Portentous as the written wall which struck  O'er midnight bowls the proud Assyrian pale  Erewhile highflush'd with insolence and wine  Like that the dial speaks and points to thee  Lo  ▪ loth to break thy banquet up  "  man thy kingdom is departing from thee  "  nd while it lasts is emptier than my shade"  Its silent language such nor need'st thou call  Thy magi to decypher what it means  Know like the Median Fate is in thy walls  Dost ask How Whence Belshazzarlike amaz'd  Man's make incloses the sure seeds of Death  Life seeds the murderer ingrate he thrives  On her own meal and then his nurse devours  But here Lorenzo the delusion lies  That solarshadow as it measures life  It Life resembles too Life speeds away  From point to point tho' seeming to stand still  The cunning fugitive is swift by stealth  Too subtle is the movement to be seen  Yet soon man's hour is up and we are gone  Warnings point out our danger gnomons Time  As these are useless when the sun is set  So those but when more glorious Reason shines  Reason should judge in all in Reason's eye  That sedentary shadow travels hard  But such our gravitation to the wrong  So prone our hearts to whisper what we wish  'Tis later with the wise than he's aware  A Wilmington goes slower than the sun  And all mankind mistake their time of day  Ev'n Age itself Fresh hopes are hourly sown  In furrow'd brows So gentle Life's descent  We shut our eyes and think it is a plain  We take fair days in Winter for the Spring  And turn our blessings into bane Since oft  Man must compute that age he cannot feel  He scarce believes he's older for his years  Thus at Life's latest eve we keep in store  One disappointment sure to crown the rest  The disappointment of a promis'd hour  Oh this or similar Philander thou  Whose mind was moral as the preacher's tongue  And strong to wield all science worth the name  How often we talk'd down the Summer's Sun  And cool'd our passions by the breezy stream  How often thaw'd and shorten'd Winter's eve  By conflict kind that struck out latent truth  Best found so sought to the recluse more coy  Thoughts disentangle passing o'er the lip  Clean runs the thread if not 'tis thrown away  Or kept to tie up nonsense for a song  Song fashionably fruitless such as stains  The Fancy and unhallow'd Passion fires  Chiming her saints to Cytherea's fane  Know'st thou Lorenzo what a Friend contains  As bees mix'd Nectar draw from fragrant flow'rs  So men from Friendship Wisdom and Delight  Twins ty'd by Nature if they part they die  Hast thou no Friend to set thy mind abroach  Good Sense will stagnate Thoughts shut up want air  And spoil like bales unopen'd to the Sun  Had Thought been all sweet Speech had been deny'd  Speech Thought's canal Speech Thought's criterion too  Thought in the mine may come forth gold or dross  When coin'd in word we know its real worth  If sterling store it for thy future use  'Twill buy thee benefit perhaps renown  Thought too deliver'd is the more possest  Teaching we learn and giving we retain  The births of Intellect when dumb forgot  Speech ventilates our intellectual fire  Speech burnishes our mental magazine  Brightens for ornament and whets for use  What numbers sheath'd in Erudition lie  Plung'd to the hilts in venerable tomes  And rusted in who might have borne an edge  And play'd a sprightly beam if born to Speech  If born blest heirs of half their mother's tongue  'Tis Thought's exchange which like th' alternate push  Of waves conflicting breaks the learned scum  And defecates the student's standing pool  In Contemplation is his proud resource  'Tis poor as proud by Converse unsustain'd  Rude Thought runs wild in Contemplation's field  Converse the menage breaks it to the bit  Of due restraint and Emulation's spur  Gives graceful energy by rivals aw'd  'Tis converse qualifies for solitude  As exercise for salutary rest  By that untutor'd Contemplation raves  And Nature's fool by Wisdom's is outdone  Wisdom tho' richer than Peruvian mines  And sweeter than the sweet ambrosial hive  What is she but the means of Happiness  That unobtain'd than Folly more a fool  A melancholy fool without her bells  Friendship the means of wisdom richly gives  The precious end which makes our wisdom wise  Nature in zeal for human amity  Denies or damps an undivided joy  Joy is an import joy is an exchange  Joy flies monopolists it calls for two  Rich fruit heav'nplanted never pluck'd by one  Needful auxiliars are our friends to give  To social man true relish of himself  Full on ourselves descending in a line  Pleasure's bright beam is feeble in delight  Delight intense is taken by rebound  Reverberated pleasures fire the breast  Celestial happiness whene'er she stoops  To visit earth one shrine the goddess finds  And one alone to make her sweet amends  For absent Heav'nthe bosom of a Friend  Where heart meets heart reciprocally soft  Each other's pillow to repose divine  Beware the counterfeit in Passion's flame  Hearts melt but melt like ice soon harder froze  True love strikes root in Reason Passion's foe  Virtue alone entenders us for life  I wrong her muchentenders us for ever  Of Friendship's fairest fruits the fruit most fair  Is Virtue kindling at a rival fire  And emulously rapid in her race  O the soft enmity endearing strife  This carries Friendship to her noontide point  And gives the rivet of Eternity  From Friendship which outlives my former themes  Glorious survivor of old Time and Death  From Friendship thus that flow'r of heav'nly seed  The wise extract Earth's most hyblean bliss  Superior Wisdom crown'd with smiling Joy  But for whom blossoms this Elysian flow'r  Abroad they find who cherish it at home  Lorenzo pardon what my love extorts  An honest love and not afraid to frown  Tho' choice of follies fasten on the great  None clings more obstinate than Fancy fond  That sacred Friendship is their easy prey  Caught by the wafture of a golden lure  Or fascination of a highborn smile  Their smiles the great and the coquet throw out  For others hearts tenacious of their own  And we no less of ours when such the bait  Ye Fortune's cofferers Ye pow'rs of Wealth  Can gold gain Friendship Impudence of Hope  As well mere man an angel might beget  Love and Love only is the loan for Love  Lorenzo Pride repress nor hope to find  A Friend but what has found a Friend in thee  All like the purchase few the price will pay  And this makes Friends such miracles below  What if since daring on so nice a theme  I shew thee Friendship delicate as dear  Of tender violations apt to die  Reserve will wound it and Distrust destroy  Deliberate on all things with thy Friend  But since Friends grow not thick on ev'ry bough  Nor ev'ry Friend unrotten at the core  First on thy Friend delib'rate with thyself  Pause ponder sift not eager in the choice  Nor jealous of the chosen fixing fix  Judge before Friendship then confide till Death  Well for thy friend but nobler far for thee  How gallant danger for Earth's highest prize  A friend is worth all hazards we can run  "Poor is the friendless master of a world  "A world in purchase for a Friend is gain"  So sung he angels hear that angel sing  Angels from Friendship gather half their joy  So sung Philander as his Friend went round  In the rich Ichor in the generous blood  Of Bacchus purple god of joyous Wit  A brow solute and everlaughing eye  He drank long health and virtue to his Friend  His Friend who warm'd him more who more inspir'd  Friendship's the wine of life but Friendship new  Not such was his is neither strong nor pure  O for the bright complexion cordial warmth  And elevating spirit of a friend  For twenty summers ripening by my side  All feculence of falshood long thrown down  All social virtues rising in his soul  As crystal clear and smiling as they rise  Here nectar flows it sparkles in our sight  Rich to the taste and genuine from the heart  Highflavour'd bliss for Gods on earth how rare  On earth how lostPhilander is no more  Think'st thou the theme intoxicates my song  Am I too warmToo warm I cannot be  I lov'd him much but now I love him more  Like birds whose beauties languish halfconceal'd  Till mounted on the wing their glossy plumes  Expanded shine with azure green and gold  How blessings brighten as they take their flight  His flight Philander took his upward flight  If ever soul ascended Had he dropt  That eagle genius O had he let fall  One feather as he flew I then had wrote  What friends might flatter prudent foes forbear  Rivals scarce damn and Zoilus reprieve  Yet what I can I must it were profane  To quench a glory lighted at the skies  And cast in shadows his illustrious close  Strange the theme most affecting most sublime  Momentous most to man should sleep unsung  And yet it sleeps by genius unawak'd  Painim or Christian to the blush of Wit  Man's highest triumph man's profoundest fall  The deathbed of the just Is yet undrawn  By mortal hand it merits a divine  Angels should paint it angels ever there  There on a post of honour and of joy  Dare I presume then But Philander bids  And Glory tempts and Inclination calls  Yet am I struck as struck the soul beneath  Aěrial groves impenetrable gloom  Or in some mighty ruin's solemn shade  Or gazing by pale lamps on highborn dust  In vaults thin courts of poor unflatter'd kings  Or at the midnight altar's hallow'd flame  It is religion to proceed I pause  And enter aw'd the temple of my theme  Is it his deathbed No it is his shrine  Behold him there just rising to a God  The chamber where the good man meets his fate  Is privileg'd beyond the common walk  Of virtuous life quite in the verge of Heav'n  Fly ye profane If not draw near with awe  Receive the blessing and adore the chance  That threw in this Bethesda your disease  If unrestor'd by this despair your cure  For here resistless Demonstration dwells  A deathbed's a detector of the heart  Here tir'd Dissimulation drops her masque  Thro' Life's grimace that mistress of the scene  Here real and apparent are the same  You see the man you see his hold on Heav'n  If sound his virtue as Philander's sound  Heav'n waits not the last moment owns her friends  On this side death and points them out to men  A lecture silent but of sov'reign pow'r  To Vice confusion and to Virtue peace  Whatever farce the boastful hero plays  Virtue alone has majesty in Death  And greater still the more the tyrant frowns  Philander he severely frown'd on thee  "No warning giv'n Unceremonious fate  "A sudden rush from Life's meridian joys  "A wrench from all we love from all we are  "A restless bed of Pain a plunge opaque  "Beyond conjecture Feeble Nature's dread  "Strong Reason's shudder at the dark unknown  "A Sun extinguisht A just opening grave  "And Oh the last last what can words express  "Thought reach it the lastSilence of a Friend"  Where are those horrors that amazement where  This hideous group of ills which singly shock  Demand from manI thought him man till now  Thro' Nature's wreck thro' vanquisht agonies  Like the stars struggling thro' this midnight gloom  What gleams of joy what more than human peace  Where the frail mortal the poor abject worm  No not in Death the mortal to be found  His conduct is a legacy for all  Richer than Mammon's for his single heir  His comforters he comforts great in ruin  With unreluctant grandeur gives not yields  His soul sublime and closes with his fate  How our hearts burnt within us at the scene  Whence this brave bound o'er limits fixt to man  His God sustains him in his final hour  His final hour brings glory to his God  Man's glory Heav'n vouchsafes to call her own  We gaze we weep mixt tears of grief and joy  Amazement strikes Devotion bursts to flame  Christians adore and Infidels believe  As some tall tow'r or lofty mountain's brow  Detains the Sun illustrious from its height  While rising vapours and descending shades  With damps and darkness drown the spacious vale  Undampt by Doubt undarken'd by Despair  Philander thus augustly rears his head  At that black hour which gen'ral horror sheds  On the low level of th' inglorious throng  Sweet Peace and heav'nly Hope and humble Joy  Divinely beam on his exalted soul  Destruction gild and crown him for the skies  With incommunicable lustre bright  SATIRE I  Young's Satires were in higher reputation when published than they stand in at present He seems fonder of dazzling than pleasing of raising our admiration for his wit than our dislike of the follies he ridicules  MY verse is Satire Dorset lend your ear  And patronize a muse you cannot fear  To poets sacred is a Dorset's name  Their wonted passport thro' the gates of Fame  It bribes the partial reader into praise  And throws a glory round the shelter'd lays  The dazzled judgment fewer faults can see  And gives applause to Be or to me  But you decline the mistress we pursue  Others are fond of Fame but Fame of you  Instructive Satire true to Virtue's cause  Thou shining supplement of public laws  When flatter'd crimes of a licentious age  Reproach our silence and demand our rage  When purchas'd follies from each distant land  Like arts improve in Britain's skilful hand  When the law shews her teeth but dares not bite  And Southsea treasures are not brought to light  When Churchmen Scripture for the Classics quit  Polite apostates from God's Grace to Wit  When men grow great from their revenue spent  And fly from bailiffs into parliament  When dying sinners to blot out their score  Bequeath the church the leavings of a whore  To chafe our spleen when themes like these increase  Shall Panegyric reign and Censure cease  Shall Poesy like Law turn wrong to right  And dedications wash an Aethiop white  Set up each senseless wretch for Nature's boast  On whom praise shines as trophies on a post  Shall Funeral Eloquence her Colours spread  And scatter roses on the wealthy dead  Shall authors smile on such illustrious days  And satirize with nothingbut their praise  Why slumbers Pope who leads the tuneful train  Nor hears that Virtue which he loves complain  Donne Dorset Dryden Rochester are dead  And Guilt's chief foe in Addison is fled  Congreve who crown'd with laurels fairly won  Sits smiling at the goal while others run  He will not write and more provoking still  Ye Gods he will not write and Maevius will  Doubly distrest what author shall we find  Discreetly daring and severely kind  The courtly Roman's shining path to tread  And sharply smile prevailing Folly dead  Will no superior genius snatch the quill  And save me on the brink from writing ill  Tho' vain the strife I'll strive my voice to raise  What will not men attempt for sacred Praise  The love of Praise howe'er conceal'd by art  Reigns more or less and glows in ev'ry heart  The proud to gain it toils on toils endure  The modest shun it but to make it sure  O'er globes and scepters now on thrones it swells  Now trims the midnight lamp in collegecells  'Tis Tory Whig it plots prays preaches pleads  Harangues in senates squeaks in masquerades  Here to Se's humour makes a bold pretence  There bolder aims at Pulteney's eloquence  It aids the dancer's heel the writer's head  And heaps the plain with mountains of the dead  Nor ends with life but nods in sable plumes  Adorns our herse and flatters on our tombs  What is not proud The Pimp is proud to see  So many like himself in high degree  The Whore is proud her beauties are the dread  Of peevish Virtue and the marriagebed  And the brib'd Cuckold like crown'd victims born  To slaughter glories in his gilded horn  Some go to church proud humbly to repent  And come back much more guilty than they went  One way they look another way they steer  Pray to the gods but would have mortals hear  And when their sins they set sincerely down  They'll find that their religion has been one  Others with wishful eyes on Glory look  When they have got their picture towards a book  Or pompous Title like a gaudy sign  Meant to betray dull sots to wretched wine  If at his Title T had dropt his quill  T might have pass'd for a great genius still  But T alas excuse him if you can  Is now a scribbler who was once a man  Imperious some a classic Fame demand  For heaping up with a laborious hand  A waggonload of meanings for one word  While A's depos'd and B with pomp restor'd  Some for Renown on scraps of learning dote  And think they grow immortal as they quote  To patchwork learn'd quotations are ally'd  Both strive to make our Poverty our Pride  On Glass how witty is a noble peer  Did ever diamond cost a man so dear  Polite diseases make some idiots vain  Which if unfortunately well they feign  On deathbeds some in conscious glory lie  Since of the doctor in the mode they die  Whose wond'rous skill is headsmanlike to know  For better pay to give a surer blow  Of Folly Vice Disease men proud we see  And stranger still of blockhead's flattery  Whose praise defames as if a fool should mean  By spitting on your face to make it clean  Nor is't enough all hearts are swol'n with Pride  Her pow'r is mighty as her realm is wide  What can she not perform The love of Fame  Made bold Alphonsus his Creator blame  Empedocles hurl'd down the burning steep  And stronger still made Alexander weep  Nay it holds Delia from a second bed  Tho' her lov'd lord has four half months been dead  This passion with a pimple have I seen  Retard a cause and give a judge the spleen  By this inspir'd O ne'er to be forgot  Some lords have learnt to spell and some to knot  It makes globose a speaker in the house  He hems and is deliver'd of his mouse  It makes dear self on wellbred tongues prevail  And I the little hero of each tale  Sick with the love of Fame what throngs pour in  Unpeople court and leave the senate thin  My growing subject seems but just begun  And chariotlike I kindle as I run  Aid me great Homer with thy Epic rules  To take a catalogue of British fools  Satire had I thy Dorset's force divine  A knave or fool should perish in each line  Tho' for the first all Westminster should plead  And for the last all Gresham intercede  Begin Who first the catalogue shall grace  To Quality belongs the highest place  My lord comes forward forward let him come  Ye vulgar at your peril give him room  He stands for Fame on his forefather's feet  By heraldry prov'd valiant or discreet  With what a decent pride he throws his eyes  Above the man by three descents less wise  If virtues at his noble hand you crave  You bid him raise his fathers from the grave  Men should press forward in Fame's glorious chace  Nobles look backward and so lose the race  Let high birth triumph What can be no more great  Nothingbut Merit in a low estate  To Virtue's humblest son let none prefer  Vice tho' descended from the Conqueror  Shall men like figures pass for high or base  Slight or important only by their place  Titles are marks of honest men and wise  The fool or knave that wears a title lies  They that on glorious ancestors inlarge  Produce their debt instead of their discharge  Dorset let those who proudly boast their line  Like thee in worth hereditary shine  Vain as false greatness is the muse must own  We want not fools to buy that Bristol stone  Mean sons of Earth who on a SouthSea tide  Of full success swam into Wealth and Pride  Knock with a purse of gold at Anstis' gate  And beg to be descended from the great  When men of infamy to grandeur soar  They light a torch to shew their shame the more  Those governments which curb not evils cause  And a rich knave's a libel on our laws  Belus with solid glory will be crown'd  He buys no phantom no vain empty sound  But builds himself a name and to be great  Sinks in a quarry an immense estate  In cost and grandeur Chandos he'll outdo  And Burlington thy taste is not so true  The pile is finish'd ev'ry toil is past  And full perfection is arriv'd at last  When lo my lord to some small corner runs  And leaves staterooms to strangers and to duns  The man who builds and wants wherewith to pay  Provides a home from which to run away  In Britain what is many a lordly seat  But a discharge in full for an estate  In smaller compass lies Pygmalion's fame  Not domes but antick statues are his flame  Not Ftn's self more Parian charms has known  Nor is good Pembroke more in love with stone  The bailiffs come rude men prophanely bold  And bid him turn his Venus into gold  "No sirs" he cries "I'll sooner rot in jail  "Shall Grecian arts be truckt for English bail"  Such heads might make their very busto's laugh  His daughter starves but Cleopatra's safe  Men overloaded with a large estate  May spill their treasure in a nice conceit  The rich may be polite but oh 'tis sad  To say you're curious when we swear you're mad  By your revenue measure your expence  And to your funds and acres join your sense  No man is blest by accident or guess  True wisdom is the price of happiness  Yet few without long discipline are sage  And our youth only lays up sighs for age  But how my muse can'st thou refuse so long  The bright temptation of the courtly throng  Thy most inviting theme The court affords  Much food for Satire it abounds in lords  "What lords are those saluting with a grin"  One is just out and one is lately in  "How comes it then to pass we see preside  "On both their brows an equal share of pride"  Pride that impartial passion reigns thro' all  Attends our glory nor deserts our fall  As in its home it triumphs in high place  And frowns a haughty exile in disgrace  Some lords it bids admire their wands so white  Which bloom like Aaron's to their ravisht sight  Some lords it bids resign and turns their wands  Like Moses' into serpents in their hands  These sink as divers for renown and boast  With pride inverted of their honours lost  But against Reason sure 'tis equal sin  To boast of merely being out or in  What numbers here thro' odd ambition strive  To seem the most transported things alive  As if by joy desert was understood  And all the fortunate were wise or good  Hence aching bosoms wear a visage gay  And stifled groans frequent the ball and play  Compleatly dress'd by Monteuel and grimace  They take their birthday suit and public face  Their smiles are only part of what they wear  Put off at night with lady B's hair  What bodily fatigue is half so bad  With anxious care they labour to be glad  What numbers here would into Fame advance  Conscious of merit in the coxcomb's dance  The tavern park assembly mask and play  Those dear destroyers of the tedious day  That wheel of fops that Santer of the town  Call it Diversion and the pill goes down  Fools grin on fools and Stoiclike support  Without one sigh the pleasures of a court  Courts can give nothing to the wise and good  But scorn of pomp and love of solitude  High stations tumults but not bliss create  None think the great unhappy but the great  Fools gaze and envy Envy darts a sting  Which makes a swain as wretched as a king  I envy none their pageantry and show  I envy none the gilding of their woe  Give me indulgent gods with mind serene  And guiltless heart to range the sylvan scene  No splendid poverty no smiling care  No wellbred hate or servile grandeur there  There pleasing objects useful thoughts suggest  The sense is ravisht and the soul is blest  On every thorn delightful Wisdom grows  In ev'ry rill a sweet instruction flows  But some untaught o'erhear the whisp'ring rill  In spite of sacred Leisure blockheads still  Nor shoots up Folly to a nobler bloom  In her own native soil the Drawingroom  The squire is proud to see his courser strain  Or wellbreath'd beagles sweep along the plain  Say dear Hippolitus whose drink is ale  Whose erudition is a Christmastale  Whose mistress is saluted with a smack  And friend receiv'd with thumps upon the back  When thy sleek gelding nimbly leaps the mound  And Ringwood opens on the tainted ground  Is that thy praise Let Ringwood's fame alone  Just Ringwood leaves each animal his own  Nor envies when a gipsy you commit  And shake the clumsy bench with country wit  When you the dullest of dull things have said  And then ask pardon for the jest you made  Here breathe my muse and then thy task renew  Ten thousand fools unsung are still in view  Fewer layatheists made by churchdebates  Fewer great beggars fam'd for large estates  Ladies whose love is constant as the wind  Cits who prefer a guinea to mankind  Fewer grave lords to Scroope discreetly bend  And fewer shocks a statesman gives his friend  Is there a man of an eternal vein  Who lulls the town in Winter with his strain  At Bath in Summer chants the reigning lass  And sweetly whistles as the waters pass  Is there a tongue like Delia's o'er her cup  That runs for ages without windingup  Is there whom his tenth Epic mounts to fame  Such and such only might exhaust my theme  Nor would these heroes of the task be glad  For who can write so fast as men run mad  A PASTORAL BALLAD IN FOUR PARTS  These ballads of Mr Shenstone are chiefly commended for the natural simplicity of the thoughts and the harmony of the versification However they are not excellent in either  I ABSENCE  I  YE shepherds so chearful and gay  Whose flocks never carelesly roam  Should Corydon's happen to stray  Oh call the poor wanderers home  Allow me to muse and to sigh  Nor talk of the change that ye find  None once was so watchful as I  I have left my dear Phyllis behind  II  Now I know what it is to have strove  With the torture of doubt and desire  What it is to admire and to love  And to leave her we love and admire  Ah lead forth my flock in the morn  And the damps of each ev'ning repell  Alas I am faint and forlorn  I have bade my dear Phyllis farewell  III  Since Phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look  I never once dreamt of my vine  May I lose both my pipe and my crook  If I knew of a kid that was mine  I priz'd every hour that went by  Beyond all that had pleas'd me before  But now they are pass'd and I sigh  And I grieve that I priz'd them no more  IV  But why do I languish in vain  Why wander thus pensively here  Oh why did I come from the plain  Where I fed on the smiles of my dear  They tell me my favourite maid  The pride of that valley is flown  Alas where with her I have stray'd  I could wander with pleasure alone  V  When forc'd the fair nymph to forego  What anguish I felt at my heart  Yet I thoughtbut it might not be so  'Twas with pain that she saw me depart  She gaz'd as I slowly withdrew  My path I could hardly discern  So sweetly she bade me adieu  I thought that she bade me return  VI  The pilgrim that journeys all day  To visit some far distant shrine  If he bear but a relique away  Is happy nor heard to repine  Thus widely remov'd from the fair  Where my vows my devotion I owe  Soft Hope is the relique I bear  And my solace wherever I go  II HOPE  I  MY banks they are furnish'd with bees  Whose murmur invites one to sleep  My grottoes are shaded with trees  And my hills are white over with sheep  I seldom have met with a loss  Such health do my fountains bestow  My fountains all border'd with moss  Where the harebells and violets grow  II  Not a pine in my grove is there seen  But with tendrils of woodbine is bound  Not a beech's more beautiful green  But a sweetbriar twines it around  Not my fields in the prime of the year  More charms than my cattle unfold  Not a brook that is limpid and clear  But it glitters with fishes of gold  III  One would think she might like to retire  To the bow'r I have labour'd to rear  Not a shrub that I heard her admire  But I hasted and planted it there  O how sudden the jessamin strove  With the lilac to render it gay  Already it calls for my love  To prune the wild branches away  IV  From the plains from the woodlands and groves  What strains of wild melody flow  How the nightingales warble their loves  From thickets of roses that blow  And when her bright form shall appear  Each bird shall harmoniously join  In a concert so soft and so clear  Asshe may not be fond to resign  V  I have found out a gift for my fair  I have found where the woodpigeons breed  But let me that plunder forbear  She will say 'twas a barbarous deed  For he ne'er could be true she averr'd  Who could rob a poor bird of its young  And I lov'd her the more when I heard  Such tenderness fall from her tongue  VI  I have heard her with sweetness unfold  How that pity was due toa dove  That it ever attended the bold  And she call'd it the sister of Love  But her words such a pleasure convey  So much I her accents adore  Let her speak and whatever she say  Methinks I should love her the more  VII  Can a bosom so gentle remain  Unmov'd when her Corydon sighs  Will a nymph that is fond of the plain  These plains and this valley despise  Dear regions of silence and shade  Soft scenes of contentment and ease  Where I could have pleasingly stray'd  If aught in her absence could please  VIII  But where does my Phyllida stray  And where are her grots and her bow'rs  Are the groves and the valleys as gay  And the shepherds as gentle as ours  The groves may perhaps be as fair  And the face of the valleys as fine  The swains may in manners compare  But their love is not equal to mine  III SOLICITUDE  I  WHY will you my passion reprove  Why term it a folly to grieve  Ere I shew you the charms of my love  She is fairer than you can believe  With her mien she enamours the brave  With her wit she engages the free  With her modesty pleases the grave  She is ev'ry way pleasing to me  II  O you that have been of her train  Come and join in my am'rous lays  I could lay down my life for the swain  That will sing but a song in her praise  When he sings may the nymphs of the town  Come trooping and listen the while  Nay on him let not Phillida frown  But I cannot allow her to smile  III  For when Paridel tries in the dance  Any favour with Phyllis to find  O how with one trivial glance  Might she ruin the peace of my mind  In ringlets he dresses his hair  And his crook is bestudded around  And his pipeoh may Phyllis beware  Of a magic there is in the sound  IV  'Tis his with mock passion to glow  'Tis his in smooth tales to unfold  "How her face is as bright as the snow  "And her bosom be sure is as cold  "How the nightingales labour the strain  "With the notes of his charmer to vie  "How they vary their accents in vain  "Repine at her triumphs and die"  V  To the grove or the garden he strays  And pillages every sweet  Then suiting the wreath to his lays  He throws it at Phyllis's feet  "O Phyllis" he whispers "more fair  "More sweet than the jessamine's flow'r  "What are pinks in a morn to compare  "What is eglantine after a show'r  VI  "Then the lily no longer is white  "Then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom  "Then the violets die with despight  "And the woodbines give up their perfume"  Thus glide the soft numbers along  And he fancies no shepherd his peer  Yet I never should envy the song  Were not Phyllis to lend it an ear  VII  Let his crook be with hyacinths bound  So Phyllis the trophy despise  Let his forehead with laurels be crown'd  So they shine not in Phyllis's eyes  The language that flows from the heart  Is a stranger to Paridel's tongue  Yet may she beware of his art  Or sure I must envy the song  IV DISAPPOINTMENT  I  YE shepherds give ear to my lay  And take no more heed of my sheep  They have nothing to do but to stray  I have nothing to do but to weep  Yet do not my folly reprove  She was fairand my passion begun  She smil'dand I could not but love  She is faithlessand I am undone  II  Perhaps I was void of all thought  Perhaps it was plain to foresee  That a nymph so complete would be sought  By a swain more engaging than me  Ah love ev'ry hope can inspire  It banishes wisdom the while  And the lip of the nymph we admire  Seems for ever adorn'd with a smile  III  She is faithless and I am undone  Ye that witness the woes I endure  Let Reason instruct you to shun  What it cannot instruct you to cure  Beware how you loiter in vain  Amid nymphs of an higher degree  It is not for me to explain  How fair and how fickle they be  IV  Alas from the day that we met  What hope of an end to my woes  When I cannot endure to forget  The glance that undid my repose  Yet time may diminish the pain  The flow'r and the shrub and the tree  Which I rear'd for her pleasure in vain  In time may have comfort for me  V  The sweets of a dewsprinkled rose  The sound of a murmuring stream  The peace which from solitude flows  Henceforth shall be Corydon's theme  High transports are shewn to the sight  But we are not to find them our own  Fate never bestow'd such delight  As I with my Phyllis had known  VI  O ye woods spread your branches apace  To your deepest recesses I fly  I would hide with the beasts of the chace  I would vanish from every eye  Yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove  With the same sad complaint it begun  How she smil'd and I could not but love  Was faithless and I am undone  PHOEBE A PASTORAL  This by Dr Byron is a better effort than the preceding  I  MY time O ye Muses was happily spent  When Phoebe went with me wherever I went  Ten thousand soft pleasures I felt in my breast  Sure never fond shepherd like Colin was blest  But now she is gone and has left me behind  What a marvellous change on a sudden I find  When things were as fine as cou'd possibly be  I thought it was Spring but alas it was she  II  The fountain that wont to run sweetly along  And dance to soft murmurs the pebbles among  Thou know'st little Cupid if Phoebe was there  It was pleasure to look at 'twas music to hear  But now she is absent I walk by its side  And still as it murmurs do nothing but chide  Must you be so chearful whilst I go in pain  Peace there with your bubbling and hear me complain  III  My dog I was ever well pleased to see  Come wagging his tail to my fair one and me  And Phoebe was pleas'd too and to my dog said  "Come hither poor fellow" and patted his head  But now when he's fawning I with a sour look  Cry "Sirrah" and give him a blow with my crook  And I'll give him another for why should not Tray  Be dull as his master when Phoebe's away  IV  Sweet music went with us both all the wood thro'  The Lark Linnet Throstle and Nightingale too  Winds over us whisper'd flocks by us did bleat  And chirp went the grashopper under our feet  But now she is absent tho' still they sing on  The woods are but lonely the melody's gone  Her voice in the concert as now I have found  Gives every thing else its agreeable sound  V  Will no pitying power that hears me complain  Or cure my disquiet or soften my pain  To be cur'd thou must Collin thy passion remove  But what swain is so silly to live without love  No Deity bid the dear nymph to return  For ne'er was poor shepherd so sadly forlorn  Ah what shall I do I shall die with despair  Take heed all ye swains how you love one so fair  A SONG  This by Mr Rowe is better than any thing of the kind in our language  I  DESPAIRING beside a clear stream  A shepherd forsaken was laid  And while a false nymph was his theme  A willow supported his head  The wind that blew over the plain  To his sighs with a sigh did reply  And the brook in return to his pain  Ran mournfully murmuring by  II  Alas silly swain that I was  Thus sadly complaining he cry'd  When first I beheld that fair face  'Twere better by far I had dy'd  She talk'd and I bless'd her dear tongue  When she smil'd it was pleasure too great  I listen'd and cry'd when she sung  Was nightingale ever so sweet  III  How foolish was I to believe  She could doat on so lowly a clown  Or that her fond heart would not grieve  To forsake the fine folk of the town  To think that a beauty so gay  So kind and so constant would prove  Or go clad like our maidens in grey  Or live in a cottage on love  IV  What though I have skill to complain  Though the Muses my temples have crown'd  What tho' when they hear my soft strains  The virgins sit weeping around  Ah Colin thy hopes are in vain  Thy pipe and thy laurel resign  Thy fair one inclines to a swain  Whose music is sweeter than thine  V  All you my companions so dear  Who sorrow to see me betray'd  Whatever I suffer forbear  Forbear to accuse the false maid  Tho' thro' the wide world I should range  'Tis in vain from my fortune to fly  'Twas her's to be false and to change  'Tis mine to be constant and die  VI  If while my hard fate I sustain  In her breast any pity is found  Let her come with the nymphs of the plain  And see me laid low in the ground  The last humble boon that I crave  Is to shade me with cypress and yew  And when she looks down on my grave  Let her own that her shepherd was true  VII  Then to her new love let her go  And deck her in golden array  Be finest at ev'ry fine show  And frolic it all the long day  While Colin forgotten and gone  No more shall be talk'd of or seen  Unless when beneath the pale moon  His ghost shall glide over the green  AN ESSAY ON POETRY  This work by the duke of Buckingham is enrolled among our great English productions The precepts are sensible the poetry not indifferent but it has been praised more than it deserves  OF all those arts in which the wise excel  Nature's chief masterpiece is writing well  No writing lifts exalted man so high  As sacred and soulmoving poesy  No kind of work requires so nice a touch  And if well finish'd nothing shines so much  But Heav'n forbid we should be so profane  To grace the vulgar with that noble name  'Tis not a flash of fancy which sometimes  Dazzling our minds sets off the slightest rhimes  Bright as a blaze but in a moment done  True wit is everlasting like the sun  Which tho' sometimes behind a cloud retir'd  Breaks out again and is by all admir'd  Number and rhime and that harmonious sound  Which not the nicest ear with harshness wound  Are necessary yet but vulgar arts  And all in vain these superficial parts  Contribute to the structure of the whole  Without a genius too for that's the soul  A spirit which inspires the work throughout  As that of nature moves the world about  A flame that glows amidst conceptions fit  Ev'n something of divine and more than wit  Itself unseen yet all things by it shown  Describing all men but describ'd by none  Where dost thou dwell What caverns of the brain  Can such a vast and mighty thing contain  When I at vacant hours in vain thy absence mourn  Oh where dost thou retire and why dost thou return  Sometimes with pow'rful charms to hurry me away  From pleasures of the night and bus'ness of the day  Ev'n now too far transported I am fain  To check thy course and use the needful rein  As all is dulness when the fancy's bad  So without judgment fancy is but mad  And judgment has a boundless influence  Not only in the choice of words or sense  But on the world on manners and on men  Fancy is but the feather of the pen  Reason is that substantial useful part  Which gains the head while t'other wins the heart  Here I shall all the various sorts of verse  And the whole art of poetry rehearse  But who that task would after Horace do  The best of masters and examples too  Echoes at best all we can say is vain  Dull the design and fruitless were the pain  'Tis true the ancients we may rob with ease  But who with that mean shift himself can please  Without an actor's pride A player's art  Is above his who writes a borrow'd part  Yet modern laws are made for later faults  And new absurdities inspire new thoughts  What need has Satire then to live on theft  When so much fresh occasion still is left  Fertile our soil and full of rankest weeds  And monsters worse than ever Nilus breeds  But hold the fools shall have no cause to fear  'Tis wit and sense that is the subject here  Defects of witty men deserve a cure  And those who are so will ev'n this endure  First then of Songs which now so much abound  Without his song no fop is to be found  A most offensive weapon which he draws  On all he meets against Apollo's laws  Tho' nothing seems more easy yet no part  Of poetry requires a nicer art  For as in rows of richest pearl there lies  Many a blemish that escape our eyes  The least of which defects is plainly shown  In one small ring and brings the value down  So Songs should be to just perfection brought  Yet where can one be seen without a fault  Exact propriety of words and thought  Expression easy and the fancy high  Yet that not seem to creep nor this to fly  No words transpos'd but in such order all  As wrought with care yet seem by chance to fall  Here as in all things else is most unfit  Bare ribaldry that poor pretence to wit  Such nauseous songs by a late author made  Call an unwilling censure on his shade  Not that warm thoughts of the transporting joy  Can shock the chastest or the nicest cloy  But words obscene too gross to move desire  Like heaps of fuel only choak the fire  On other themes he well deserves our praise  But palls that appetite he meant to raise  Next Elegy of sweet but solemn voice  And of a subject grave exacts the choice  The praise of beauty valour wit contains  And there too oft despairing love complains  In vain alas for who by wit is mov'd  That Phoenixshe deserves to be belov'd  But noisy nonsense and such fops as vex  Mankind take most with that fantastic sex  This to the praise of those who better knew  The many raise the value of the few  But here as all our sex too oft have try'd  Women have drawn my wand'ring thoughts aside  Their greatest fault who in this kind have writ  Is not defect in words or want of wit  But should this muse harmonious numbers yield  And ev'ry couplet be with fancy fill'd  If yet a just coherence be not made  Between each thought and the whole model laid  So right that ev'ry line may higher rise  Like goodly mountains till they reach the skies  Such trifles may perhaps of late have pass'd  And may be lik'd awhile but never last  'Tis epigram 'tis point 'tis what you will  But not an Elegy nor writ with skill  No Panegyric nor a Cooper's Hill  A higher flight and of a happier force  Are Odes the Muses' most unruly horse  That bounds so fierce the rider has no rest  Here foams at mouth and moves like one possess'd  The poet here must be indeed inspir'd  With fury too as well as fancy fir'd  Cowley might boast to have perform'd this part  Had he with nature join'd the rules of art  But sometimes diction mean or verse illwrought  Deadens or clouds his noble frame of thought  Tho' all appear in heat and fury done  The language still must soft and easy run  These laws may sound a little too severe  But judgment yields and fancy governs here  Which tho' extravagant this muse allows  And makes the work much easier than it shows  Of all the ways that wisest men could find  To mend the age and mortify mankind  Satire wellwrit has most successful prov'd  And cures because the remedy is lov'd  'Tis hard to write on such a subject more  Without repeating things said oft before  Some vulgar errors only we'll remove  That stain a beauty which we so much love  Of chosen words some take not care enough  And think they should be as the subject rough  This poem must be more exactly made  And sharpest thoughts in smoothest words convey'd  Some think if sharp enough they cannot fail  As if their only bus'ness was to rail  But human frailty nicely to unfold  Distinguishes a satyr from a scold  Rage you must hide and prejudice lay down  A satyr's smile is sharper than his frown  So while you seem to slight some rival youth  Malice itself may pass sometimes for truth  The Laureat here may justly claim our praise  Crown'd by MackFleckno with immortal bays  Yet once his Pegasus has borne dead weight  Rid by some lumpish minister of state  Here rest my Muse suspend thy cares awhile  A more important task attends thy toil  As some young eagle that designs to fly  A long unwonted journey through the sky  Weighs all the dang'rous enterprize before  O'er what wide lands and seas she is to soar  Doubts her own strength so far and justly fears  That lofty road of airy travellers  But yet incited by some bold design  That does her hopes beyond her fears incline  Prunes ev'ry feather views herself with care  At last resolv'd she cleaves the yielding air  Away she flies so strong so high so fast  She lessens to us and is lost at last  So tho' too weak for such a weighty thing  The muse inspires a sharper note to sing  And why should truth offend when only told  To guide the ignorant and warn the bold  On then my Muse advent'rously engage  To give instructions that concern the Stage  The unities of action time and place  Which if observ'd give plays so great a grace  Are tho' but little practis'd too well known  To be taught here where we pretend alone  From nicer faults to purge the present age  Less obvious errors of the English stage  First then Soliloquies had need be few  Extremely short and spoke in passion too  Our lovers talking to themselves for want  Of others make the pit their confidant  Nor is the matter mended yet if thus  They trust a friend only to tell it us  Th' occasion should as naturally fall  As when Bellario confesses all  Figures of speech which poets think so fine  Art's needless varnish to make nature shine  Are all but paint upon a beauteous face  And in descriptions only claim a place  But to make rage declaim and grief discourse  From lovers in despair fine things to force  Must needs succeed for who can choose but pity  A dying hero miserably witty  But oh the Dialogues where jest and mock  Is held up like a rest at shittlecock  Or else like bells eternally they chime  They sigh in Simile and die in Rhime  What things are these who would be poets thought  By nature not inspir'd nor learning taught  Some wit they have and therefore they deserve  A better course than this by which they starve  But to write plays why 'tis a bold pretence  To judgement breeding wit and eloquence  Nay more for they must look within to find  Those secret turns of nature in the mind  Without this part in vain would be the whole  And but a body all without a soul  All this united yet but makes a part  Of Dialogue that great and pow'rful art  Now almost lost which the old Grecians knew  From whom the Romans fainter copies drew  Scarce comprehended since but by a few  Plato and Lucian are the best remains  Of all the wonders which this art contains  Yet to ourselves we justice must allow  Shakespeare and Fletcher are the wonders now  Consider them and read them o'er and o'er  Go see them play'd then read them as before  For tho' in many things they grossly fail  Over our passions still they so prevail  That our own grief by their's is rock'd asleep  The dull are forc'd to feel the wise to weep  Their beauties imitate avoid their fau  ▪  First on a plot employ thy careful thoughts  Turn it with time a thousand several ways  This oft alone has giv'n success to plays  Reject that vulgar error which appears  So fair of making perfect characters  There's no such thing in nature and you'll draw  A faultless monster which the world ne'er saw  Some faults must be that his misfortunes drew  But such as may deserve compassion too  Besides the main design compos'd with art  Each moving scene must be a plot apart  Contrive each little turn mark ev'ry place  As painters first chalk out the future face  Yet be not fondly your own slave for this  But change hereafter what appears amiss  Think not so much where shining thoughts to place  As what a man would say in such a case  Neither in comedy will this suffice  The player too must be before your eyes  And tho' 'tis drudgery to stoop so low  To him you must your secret meaning show  Expose no single fop but lay the load  More equally and spread the folly broad  Mere coxcombs are too obvious oft we see  A fool derided by as bad as he  Hawks fly at nobler game in this low way  A very owl may prove a bird of prey  Small poets thus will one poor fop devour  But to collect like bees from ev'ry flow'r  Ingredients to compose that precious juice  Which serves the world for pleasure and for use  In spite of faction this would favour get  But Falstaff stands inimitable yet  Another fault which often may befall  Is when the wit of some great poet shall  So overflow that is be none at all  That ev'n his fools speak sense as if possest  And each by inspiration breaks his jest  If once the justness of each part be lost  Well we may laugh but at the poet's cost  That silly thing men call sheerwit avoid  With which our age so nauseously is cloy'd  Humour is all wit should be only brought  To turn agreeably some proper thought  But since the poets we of late have known  Shine in no dress so much as in their own  The better by example to convince  Cast but a view on this wrong side of sense  First a Soliloquy is calmly made  Where ev'ry reason is exactly weigh'd  Which once perform'd most opportunely comes  Some hero frighted at the noise of drums  For her sweet sake whom at first sight he loves  And all in metaphor his passion proves  But some sad accident tho' yet unknown  Parting this pair to leave the swain alone  He strait grows jealous tho' we know not why  Then to oblige his rival needs will die  But first he makes a speech wherein he tells  The absent nymph how much his flame excels  And yet bequeaths her generously now  To that lov'd rival whom he does not know  Who strait appears but who can fate withstand  Too late alas to hold his hasty hand  That just has giv'n himself the cruel stroke  At which his very rival's heart is broke  He more to his new friend than mistress kind  Most sadly mourns at being left behind  Of such a death prefers the pleasing charms  To love and living in a lady's arms  What shameful and what monstrous things are these  And then they rail at those they cannot please  Conclude us only partial to the dead  And grudge the sign of old Ben Johnson's head  When the intrinsic value of the stage  Can scarce be judg'd but by a following age  For dances flutes Italian songs and rhime  May keep up sinking nonsense for a time  But that must fail which now so much o'errules  And sense no longer will submit to fools  By painful steps at last we labour up  Parnassus' hill on whose bright airy top  The Epick poets so divinely show  And with just pride behold the rest below  Heroic poems have a just pretence  To be the utmost stretch of human sense  A work of such inestimable worth  There are but two the world has yet brought forth  Homer and Virgil with what sacred awe  Do those mere sounds the world's attention draw  Just as a changeling seems below the rest  Of men or rather is a twolegg'd beast  So these gigantic souls amaz'd we find  As much above the rest of human kind  Nature's whole strength united endless fame  And universal shouts attend their name  Read Homer once and you can read no more  For all books else appear so mean so poor  Verse will seem prose but still persist to read  And Homer will be all the books you need  Had Bossu never writ the world had still  Like Indians view'd this wond'rous piece of skill  As something of divine the work admir'd  Not hop'd to be instructed but inspir'd  But he disclosing sacred mysteries  Has shewn where all the mighty magic lies  Describ'd the seeds and in what order sown  That have to such a vast proportion grown  Sure from some angel he the secret knew  Who thro' this labyrinth has lent the clue  But what alas avails it poor mankind  To see this promis'd land yet stay behind  The way is shewn but who has strength to go  Who can all sciences profoundly know  Whose fancy flies beyond weak reason's sight  And yet has judgment to direct it right  Whose just discernment Virgillike is such  Never to say too little or too much  Let such a man begin without delay  But he must do beyond what I can say  Must above Tasso's lofty flights prevail  Succeed where Spencer and ev'n Milton fail  CADENUS AND VANESSA  This is thought one of Dr Swift's correctest pieces its chief merit indeed is the elegant ease with which a story but ill conceived in itself is told  THE shepherds and the nymphs were seen  Pleading before the Cyprian queen  The council for the fair began  Accusing the false creature Man  The brief with weighty crimes was charg'd  On which the pleader much enlarg'd  That Cupid now has lost his art  Or blunts the point of ev'ry dart  His altar now no longer smokes  His mother's aid no youth invokes  This tempts freethinkers to refine  And bring in doubt their pow'rs divine  Now love is dwindled to intrigue  And marriage grown a moneyleague  Which crimes aforesaid with her leave  Were as he humbly did conceive  Against our sovereign lady's peace  Against the statute in that case  Against her dignity and crown  Then pray'd an answer and sat down  The nymphs with scorn beheld their foes  When the defendant's council rose  And what no lawyer ever lack'd  With impudence own'd all the fact  But what the gentlest heart would vex  Laid all the fault on t'other sex  That modern love is no such thing  As what those ancient poets sing  A fire celestial chaste refin'd  Conceiv'd and kindled in the mind  Which having found an equal flame  Unites and both become the same  In diff'rent breasts together burn  Together both to ashes turn  But women now feel no such fire  And only know the gross desire  Their passions move in lower spheres  Wheree'er caprice or folly steers  A dog a parrot or an ape  Or some worse brute in human shape  Engross the fancies of the fair  The few soft moments they can spare  From visits to receive and pay  From scandal politics and play  From fans and flounces and brocades  From equipage and parkparades  From all the thousand female toys  From ev'ry trifle that employs  The out or inside of their heads  Between their toylets and their beds  In a dull stream which moving slow  You hardly see the current flow  If a small breeze obstructs the course  It whirls about for want of force  And in its narrow circle gathers  Nothing but chaff and straws and feathers  The current of a female mind  Stops thus and turns with ev'ry wind  Thus whirling round together draws  Fools fops and rakes for chaff and straws  Hence we conclude no women's hearts  Are won by virtue wit and parts  Nor are the men of sense to blame  For breasts incapable of flame  The fault must on the nymphs be plac'd  Grown so corrupted in their taste  The pleader having spoke his best  Had witness ready to attest  Who fairly could on oath depose  When questions on the fact arose  That ev'ry article was true  Nor further those deponents knew  Therefore he humbly would insist  The bill might be with costs dismist  The cause appear'd of so much weight  That Venus from her judgmentseat  Desir'd them not to talk so loud  Else she must interpose a cloud  For if the heav'nly folk should know  These pleadings in the court below  That mortals here disdain to love  She ne'er could shew her face above  For Gods their betters are too wise  To value that which men despise  And then said she my son and I  Must strole in air 'twixt earth and sky  Or else shut out from heav'n and earth  Fly to the sea my place of birth  There live with daggled mermaids pent  And keep on fish perpetual lent  But since the case appear'd so nice  She thought it best to take advice  The Muses by their king's permission  Though foes to love attend the session  And on the right hand took their places  In order on the left the Graces  To whom she might her doubts propose  On all emergencies that rose  The Muses oft were seen to frown  The Graces halfasham'd look'd down  And 'twas observ'd there were but few  Of either sex among the crew  Whom she or her assessors knew  The goddess soon began to see  Things were not ripe for a decree  And said she must consult her books  The Lovers' Fletas Bractons Cooks  First to a dapper clerk she beckon'd  To turn to Ovid book the second  She then referr'd them to a place  In Virgil vide Dido's case  As for Tibullus's reports  They never pass'd for law in courts  For Cowley's briefs and pleas of Waller  Still their authority was smaller  There was on both sides much to say  She'd hear the cause another day  And so she did and then a third  She heard itthere she kept her word  But with rejoinders and replies  Long bills and answers stuff'd with lies  Demur imparlance and essoign  The parties ne'er could issue join  For sixteen years the cause was spun  And then stood where it first begun  Now gentle Clio sing or say  What Venus meant by this delay  The goddess much perplex'd in mind  To see her empire thus declin'd  When first this grand debate arose  Above her wisdom to compose  Conceiv'd a project in her head  To work her ends which if it sped  Wou'd shew the merits of the cause  Far better than consulting laws  In a glad hour Lucina's aid  Produc'd on earth a wond'rous maid  On whom the queen of love was bent  To try a new experiment  She threw her lawbooks on the shelf  And thus debated with herself  "Since men alledge they ne'er can find  Those beauties in a female mind  Which raise a flame that will endure  For ever uncorrupt and pure  If 'tis with reason they complain  This instant shall restore my reign  I'll search where ev'ry virtue dwells  From courts inclusive down to cells  What preachers talk or sages write  These I will gather and unite  And represent them to mankind  Collected in that infant's mind"  This said she plucks in heav'n's high bow'rs  A sprig of amaranthine flow'rs  In nectar thrice infuses bays  Three times refin'd in Titan's rays  Then calls the Graces to her aid  And sprinkles thrice the newborn maid  From whence the tender skin assumes  A sweetness above all perfumes  From whence a cleanliness remains  Incapable of outward stains  From whence that decency of mind  So lovely in the female kind  Where not one careless thought intrudes  Less modest than the speech of prudes  Where never blush was call'd in aid  That spurious virtue in a maid  A virtue but at secondhand  They blush because they understand  The Graces next would act their part  And shew'd but little of their art  Their work was half already done  The child with native beauty shone  The outward form no help requir'd  Each breathing on her thrice inspir'd  That gentle soft engaging air  Which in old times adorn'd the fair  And said "Vanessa be the name  By which you shall be known to fame  Vanessa by the gods enroll'd  Her name on earthshall not be told"  But still the work was not compleat  When Venus thought on a deceit  Drawn by her doves away she flies  And finds out Pallas in the skies  "Dear Pallas I have been this morn  To see a lovely infant born  A boy in yonder isle below  So like my own without his bow  By beauty could your heart be won  You'd swear it is Apollo's son  But it shall ne'er be said a child  So hopeful has by me been spoil'd  I have enough besides to spare  And give him wholly to your care"  Wisdom's above suspecting wiles  The queen of learning gravely smiles  Down from Olympus comes with joy  Mistakes Vanessa for a boy  Then sows within her tender mind  Seeds long unknown to womankind  For manly bosoms chiefly fit  The seeds of knowledge judgment wit  Her soul was suddenly endu'd  With justice truth and fortitude  With honour which no breath can stain  Which malice must attack in vain  With open heart and bounteous hand  But Pallas here was at a stand  She knew in our degen'rate days  Bare virtue could not live on praise  That meat must be with money bought  She therefore upon second thought  Infus'd yet as it were by stealth  Some small regard for state and wealth  Of which as she grew up there stay'd  A tincture in the prudent maid  She manag'd her estate with care  Yet lik'd three footmen to her chair  But lest he should neglect her studies  Like a young heir the thrifty goddess  For fear young master should be spoil'd  Would use him like a younger child  And after long computing found  'Twould come to just five thousand pound  The queen of love was pleas'd and proud  To see Vanessa thus endow'd  She doubted not but such a dame  Through ev'ry breast would dart a flame  That ev'ry rich and lordly swain  With pride would drag about her chain  That scholars would desert their books  To study bright Vanessa's looks  As she advanc'd that womankind  Would by her model form their mind  And all their conduct would be try'd  By her as an unerring guide  Offending daughters oft would hear  Vanessa's praise rung in their ear  Miss Betty when she does a fault  Lets fall a knife or spills the salt  Will thus be by her mother chid  "'Tis what Vanessa never did"  Thus by the nymphs and swains ador'd  My pow'r shall be again restor'd  And happy lovers bless my reign  So Venus hop'd but hop'd in vain  For when in time the martial maid  Found out the trick that Venus play'd  She shakes her helm she knits her brows  And fir'd with indignation vows  Tomorrow e're the setting sun  She'd all undo that she had done  But in the poets we may find  A wholesome law time out of mind  Had been confirm'd by fate's decree  That gods of whatsoe'er degree  Resume not what themselves have giv'n  Or any brothergod in heav'n  Which keeps the peace among the gods  Or they must always be at odds  And Pallas if she broke the laws  Must yield her foe the stronger cause  A shame to one so much ador'd  For wisdom at Jove's councilboard  Besides she fear'd the queen of love  Would meet with better friends above  And though she must with grief reflect  To see a mortal virgin deck'd  With graces hitherto unknown  To female breasts except her own  Yet she would act as best became  A goddess of unspotted fame  She knew by augury divine  Venus would fail in her design  She study'd well the point and found  Her foe's conclusions were not found  From premisses erroneous brought  And therefore the deduction's nought  And must have contrary effects  To what her treach'rous foe expects  In proper season Pallas meets  The queen of love whom thus she greets  For gods we are by Homer told  Can in celestial language scold  "Perfidious goddess but in vain  You form'd this project in your brain  A project for thy talents fit  With much deceit and little wit  Thou hast as thou shalt quickly see  Deceiv'd thyself instead of me  For how can heav'nly wisdom prove  An instrument to earthly love  Know'st thou not yet that men commence  Thy votaries for want of sense  Nor shall Vanessa be the theme  To manage thy abortive scheme  She'll prove the greatest of thy foes  And yet I scorn to interpose  But using neither skill nor force  Leave all things to their nat'ral course"  The goddess thus pronounc'd her doom  When lo Vanessa in her bloom  Advanc'd like Atalanta's star  But rarely seen and seen from far  In a new world with caution stept  Watch'd all the company she kept  Well knowing from the books she read  What dangerous paths young virgins tread  Would seldom at the park appear  Nor saw the playhouse twice a year  Yet not incurious was inclin'd  To know the converse of mankind  First issu'd from perfumers shops  A croud of fashionable fops  They ask'd her how she lik'd the play  Then told the tattle of the day  A duel fought last night at two  About a ladyYou know who  Mention'd a new Italian come  Either from Muscovy or Rome  Gave hints of who and who's together  Then fell to talking of the weather  Last night was so extremely fine  The ladies walk'd till after nine  Then in soft voice and speech absurd  With nonsense ev'ry second word  With fustian from exploded plays  They celebrate her beauty's praise  Run o'er their cant of stupid lyes  And tell the murders of her eyes  With silent scorn Vanessa sat  Scarce list'ning to their idle chat  Further than sometimes with a frown  When they grew p  rt to pull them down  At last she spitefully was bent  To try their wisdom's full extent  And said she valu'd nothing less  Than titles figure shape and dress  That merit should be chiefly plac'd  In judgment knowledge wit and taste  And these she offer'd to dispute  Alone distinguish'd man from brute  That present times have no pretence  To virtue in the noble sense  By Greeks and Romans understood  To perish for our country's good  She nam'd the ancient heroes round  Explain'd for what they were renown'd  Then spoke with censure or applause  Of foreign customs rites and laws  Thro' nature and thro' art she rang'd  And gracefully her subject chang'd  In vain her hearers had no share  In all she spoke except to stare  Their judgment was upon the whole  That lady is the dullest soul  Then tipt their forehead in a jeer  As who should sayshe wants it here  She may be handsome young and rich  But none will burn her for a witch  A party next of glitt'ring dames  From round the purlieus of St James  Came early out of pure goodwill  To see the girl in deshabille  Their clamour 'lighting from their chairs  Grew louder all the way up stairs  At entrance loudest where they found  The room with volumes litter'd round  Vanessa held Montaigne and read  Whilst Mrs Susan comb'd her head  They call'd for tea and chocolate  And fell into their usual chat  Discoursing with important face  On ribbons fans and gloves and lace  Shew'd patterns just from India brought  And gravely ask'd her what she thought  Whether the red or green were best  And what they cost Vanessa guess'd  As came into her fancy first  Nam'd half the rates and lik'd the worst  To scandal nextWhat aukward thing  Was that last Sunday in the ring  I'm sorry Mopsa breaks so fast  I said her face would never last  Corinna with that youthful air  Is thirty and a bit to spare  Her fondness for a certain earl  Began when I was but a girl  Phillis who but a month ago  Was marry'd to the Tunbridge beau  I saw coquetting t'other night  In public with that odious knight  They rally'd next Vanessa's dress  That gown was made for old queen Bess  Dear madam let me see your head  Don't you intend to put on red  A petticoat without a hoop  Sure you are not asham'd to stoop  With handsome garters at your knees  No matter what a fellow sees  Fill'd with disdain with rage inflam'd  Both of herself and sex asham'd  The nymph stood silent out of spight  Nor would vouchsafe to set them right  Away the fair detractors went  And gave by turns their censures vent  She's not so handsome in my eyes  For wit I wonder where it lies  She's fair and clean and that's the most  But why proclaim her for a toast  A baby face no life no airs  But what she learnt at country fairs  Scarce knows what diff'rence is between  Rich Flanders lace and Colberteen  I'll undertake my little Nancy  In flounces hath a better fancy  With all her wit I would not ask  Her judgment how to buy a mask  We begg'd her but to patch her face  She never hit one proper place  Which ev'ry girl at five years old  Can do as soon as she is told  I own that outoffashion stuff  Becomes the Creature well enough  The girl might pass if we could get her  To know the world a little better  "To know the world" a modern phrase  For visits ombre balls and plays  Thus to the world's perpetual shame  The queen of Beauty lost her aim  Too late with grief she understood  Pallas had done more harm than good  For great examples are but vain  Where ignorance begets disdain  Both sexes arm'd with guilt and spite  Against Vanessa's pow'r unite  To copy her few nymphs aspir'd  Her virtues fewer swains admir'd  So stars beyond a certain height  Give mortals neither heat nor light  Yet some of either sex endow'd  With gifts superior to the crowd  With virtue knowledge taste and wit  She condescended to admit  With pleasing arts she could reduce  Men's talents to their proper use  And with address each genius held  To that wherein it most excell'd  Thus making others wisdom known  Could please them and improve her own  A modest youth said something new  She plac'd it in the strongest view  All humble worth she strove to raise  Would not be prais'd yet lov'd to praise  The learned met with free approach  Although they came not in a coach  Some clergy too she would allow  Nor quarrel'd at their aukward bow  But this was for Cadenus' sake  A gownman of a diff'rent make  Whom Pallas once Vanessa's tutor  Had fix'd on for her coadjutor  But Cupid full of mischief longs  To vindicate his mother's wrongs  On Pallas all attempts are vain  One way he knows to give her pain  Vows on Vanessa's heart to take  Due vengeance for her patron's sake  Those early seeds by Venus sown  In spite of Pallas now were grown  And Cupid hop'd they would improve  By time and ripen into love  The boy made use of all his craft  In vain discharging many a shaft  Pointed at col'nels lords and beaux  Cadenus warded off the blows  For placing still some books betwixt  The darts were in the cover fix'd  Or often blunted and recoil'd  On Plutarch's Morals struck were spoil'd  The queen of Wisdom could foresee  But not prevent the fate's decree  And human caution tries in vain  To break that adamantine chain  Vanessa though by Pallas taught  By Love invulnerable thought  Searching in books for wisdom's aid  Was in the very search betray'd  Cupid though all his darts were lost  Yet still resolv'd to spare no cost  He could not answer to his fame  The triumphs of that stubborn dame  A nymph so hard to be subdu'd  Who neither was coquette nor prude  I find said he she wants a doctor  Both to adore her and instruct her  I'll give her what she most admires  Among  hose venerable fires  Cadenus is a subject fit  Grown old in politics and wit  Caress'd by ministers of state  Of half mankind the dread and hate  Whate'er vexations love attend  She need no rivals apprehend  Her sex with universal voice  Must laugh at her capricious choice  Cadenus many things had writ  Vanessa much esteem'd his wit  And call'd for his poetic works  Mean time the boy in secret lurks  And while the book was in her hand  The urchin from his private stand  Took aim and shot with all his strength  A dart of such prodigious length  It pierc'd the feeble volume through  And deep transfix'd her bosom too  Some lines more moving than the rest  Stuck to the point that pierc'd her breast  And borne directly to the heart  With pains unknown increas'd her smart  Vanessa not of years a score  Dreams of a gown of fortyfour  Imaginary charms can find  In eyes with reading almost blind  Cadenus now no more appears  Declin'd in health advanc'd in years  She fancies music in his tongue  Nor farther looks but thinks him young  What mariner is not afraid  To venture in a ship decay'd  What planter will attempt to yoke  A sapling with a falling oak  As years increase she brighter shines  Cadenus with each day declines  And he must fall a prey to time  While she continues in her prime  Cadenus common forms apart  In ev'ry scene had kept his heart  Had sigh'd and languish'd vow'd and writ  For pastime or to shew his wit  But time and books and stateaffairs  Had spoil'd his fashionable airs  He now could praise esteem approve  But understood not what was love  His conduct might have made him stil'd  A father and the nymph his child  That innocent delight he took  To see the virgin mind her book  Was but the master's secret joy  In school to hear the finest boy  Her knowledge with her fancy grew  She hourly press'd for something new  Ideas came into her mind  So fast his lessons lagg'd behind  She reason'd without plodding long  Nor ever gave her judgment wrong  But now a sudden change was wrought  She minds no longer what he taught  Cadenus was amaz'd to find  Such marks of a distracted mind  For though she seem'd to listen more  To all he spoke than e'er before  He found her thoughts would absent range  Yet guess'd not whence could spring the change  And first he modestly conjectures  His pupil might be tir'd with lectures  Which help'd to mortify his pride  Yet gave him not the heart to chide  But in a mild dejected strain  At last he ventur'd to complain  Said she shou'd be no longer teaz'd  Might have her freedom when she pleas'd  Was now convinc'd he acted wrong  To hide her from the world so long  And in dull studies to engage  One of her tender sex and age  That ev'ry nymph with envy own'd  How she might shine in the Grandemonde  And ev'ry shepherd was undone  To see her cloister'd like a nun  This was a visionary scheme  He wak'd and found it but a dream  A project far above his skill  For nature must be nature still  If he was bolder than became  A scholar to a courtly dame  She might excuse a man of letters  Thus tutors often treat their betters  And since his talk offensive grew  He came to take his last adieu  Vanessa fill'd with just disdain  Would still her dignity maintain  Instructed from her early years  To scorn the art of female tears  Had he employ'd his time so long  To teach her what was right and wrong  Yet could such notions entertain  That all his lectures were in vain  She own'd the wandering of her thoughts  But he must answer for her faults  She well remember'd to her cost  That all his lessons were not lost  Two maxims she could still produce  And sad experience taught their use  That virtue pleas'd by being shown  Knows nothing which it dares not own  Can make us without fear disclose  Our inmost secrets to our foes  That common forms were not design'd  Directors to a noble mind  Now said the nymph I'll let you see  My actions with your rules agree  That I can vulgar forms despise  And have no secrets to disguise  I knew by what you said and writ  How dang'rous things were men of wit  You cautioned me against their charms  But never gave me equal arms  Your lessons found the weakest part  Aim'd at the head but reach'd the heart  Cadenus felt within him rise  Shame disappointment guilt surprise  He knew not how to reconcile  Such language with her usual stile  And yet her words were so exprest  He could not hope she spoke in jest  His thoughts had wholly been confin'd  To form and cultivate her mind  He hardly knew till he was told  Whether the nymph were young or old  Had met her in a public place  Without distinguishing her face  Much less could his declining age  Vanessa's earliest thoughts engage  And if her youth indiff'rence met  His person must contempt beget  Or grant her passion be sincere  How shall his innocence be clear  Appearances were all so strong  The world must think him in the wrong  Would say he made a treach'rous use  Of wit to flatter and seduce  The town would swear he had betray'd  By magic spells the harmless maid  And ev'ry bean would have his jokes  That scholars were like other folks  That when Platonic flights were over  The tutor turn'd a mortal lover  So tender of the young and fair  It shew'd a true paternal care  Five thousand guineas in her purse  The doctor might have fancy'd worse  Hardly at length he silence broke  And faulter'd ev'ry word he spoke  Interpreting her complaisance  Just as a man fans consequence  She rally'd well he always knew  Her manner now was something new  And what she spoke was in an air  As serious as a tragic player  But those who aim at ridicule  Should fix upon some certain rule  Which fairly hints they are in jest  Else he must enter his protest  For let a man be ne'er so wise  He may be caught with sober lyes  A science which he never taught  And to be free was dearly bought  For take it in its proper light  'Tis just what coxcombs call a Bite  But not to dwell on things minute  Vanessa finish'd the dispute  Brought weighty arguments to prove  That reason was her guide in love  She thought he had himself describ'd  His doctrines when she first imbib'd  What he had planted now was grown  His virtues she might call her own  As he approves as he dislikes  Love or contempt her fancy strikes  Selflove in nature rooted fast  Attends us first and leaves us last  Why she likes him admire not her  She loves herself and that's the matter  How was her tutor want to praise  The genius's of ancient days  Those authors he so oft had nam'd  For learning wit and wisdom fam'd  Was struck with love esteem and awe  For persons whom he never saw  Suppose Cadenus flourish'd then  He must adore such godlike men  If one short volume could comprize  All that was witty learn'd and wise  How would it be esteem'd and read  Although the writer long were dead  If such an author were alive  How all would for his friendship strive  And come in crowds to see his face  And this she takes to be her case  Cadenus answers ev'ry end  The book the author and the friend  The utmost her desires will reach  Is but to learn what he can teach  His converse is a system fit  Alone to fill up all her wit  While ev'ry passion of her mind  In him is center'd and confin'd  Love can with speech inspire a mute  And taught Yanessa to dispute  This topic never touch'd before  Display'd her eloquence the more  Her knowledge with such pains acquir'd  By this new passion grew inspir'd  Through this she made all objects pass  Which gave a tincture o'er the mass  As rivers though they bend and twine  Still to the sea their course incline  Or as philosophers who find  Some fav'rite system to their mind  In ev'ry point to make it fit  Will force all nature to submit  Cadenus who could ne'er suspect  His lessons would have such effect  Or be so artfully apply'd  Insensibly came on her side  It was an unforeseen event  Things took a turn he never meant  Whoe'er excels in what we prize  Appears a hero in our eyes  Each girl when pleas'd with what is taught  Will have the teacher in her thought  The nymph in sober words intreats  A truce with all sublime conceits  For why such raptures flights and fancies  To her who durst not read romances  In lofty style to make replies  Which he had taught her to despise  But when her tutor will affect  Devotion duty and respect  He fairly abdicates his throne  The government is now her own  But though her arguments were strong  At least could hardly wish them wrong  Howe'er it came he could not tell  But sure she never talk'd so well  His pride began to interpose  Preferr'd before a crowd of beaux  So bright a nymph to come unsought  Such wonder by his merit wrought  'Tis merit must with her prevail  He never knew her judgment fail  She noted all she ever read  And had a most discerning head  'Tis an old maxim in the schools  That vanity's the food of fools  Yet now and then your men of wit  Will condescend to take a bit  So when Cadenus could not hide  He chose to justify his pride  When miss delights in her spinnet  A fiddler may a fortune get  A blockhead with melodious voice  In boardingschools can have his choice  And oft' the dancingmaster's art  Climbs from the toe to touch the heart  In learning let a nymph delight  The pedant gets a mistress by't  Cadenus to his grief and shame  Could scarce oppose Vanessa's flame  Where hot and cold where sharp and sweet  In all their equipages meet  Where pleasures mix'd with pains appear  Sorrow with joy and hope with fear  Wherein his dignity and age  Forbid Cadenus to engage  But friendship in its greatest height  A constant rational delight  On virtue's basis fix'd to last  When love's allurements long are past  Which gently warms but cannot burn  He gladly offers in return  His want of passion will redeem  With gratitude respect esteem  With that devotion we bestow  When Goddesses appear below  While thus Cadenus entertains  Vanessa in exalted strains  Constr'ing the passion she had shown  Much to her praise more to his own  Nature in him had merit plac'd  In her a most judicious taste  Love hitherto a transient guest  Ne'er held possession in his breast  So long attending at the gate  Disdain'd to enter in so late  Love why do we one passion call  When 'tis a compound of them all  He has a forfeiture incurr'd  She vows to take him at his word  And hopes he will not think it strange  If both should now their stations change  The nymph will have her turn to be  The tutor and the pupil he  Though she already can discern  Her scholar is not apt to learn  Or wants capacity to reach  The science she designs to teach  Wherein his genius was below  The skill of ev'ry common beau  Who though he cannot spell is wise  Enough to read a lady's eyes  And will each accidental glance  Interpret for a kind advance  But what success Vanessa met  Is to the world a secret yet  Whether the nymph to please her swain  Talks in a high romantic strain  Or whether he at last descends  To like with less seraphic ends  Or to compound the bus'ness whether  They temper love and books together  Must never to mankind be told  Nor shall the conscious muse unfold  Mean time the mournful queen of love  Led but a weary life above  She ventures now to leave the skies  Grown by Vanessa's conduct wise  For though by one perverse event  Pallas had cross'd her first intent  Though her design was not obtain'd  Yet had she much experience gain'd  And by the project vainly try'd  Could better now the cause decide  She gave due notice that both parties  Coram regina prox' die Martis  Should at their peril without fail  Come and appear and save their bail  All met and silence thrice proclaim'd  One lawyer to each side was nam'd  The judge discover'd in her face  Resentments for her late disgrace  And full of anger shame and grief  Directed them to mind their brief  Nor spend their time to shew their reading▪  She'd have a summary proceeding  She gather'd under ev'ry head  The sum of what each lawyer said  Gave her own reasons last and then  Decreed the cause against the men  But in a weighty case like this  To show she did not judge amiss  Which evil tongues might else report  She made a speech in open court  Wherein she grievously complains  "How she was cheated by the swains"  On whose petition humbly shewing  That women were not worth the wooing  And that unless the sex would mend  The race of lovers soon must end  "She was at lord knows what expence  To form a nymph of wit and sense  A model for her sex design'd  Who never could one lover find  She saw her favour was misplac'd  The fellows had a wretched taste  She needs must tell them to their face  They were a senseless stupid race  And were she to begin agen  She'd study to reform the men  Or add some grains of folly more  To women than they had before  To put them on an equal foot  And this or nothing else would do't  This might their mutual fancy strike  Since ev'ry being loves its like  But now repenting what was done  She left all bus'ness to her son  She puts the world in his possession  And let him use it at discretion"  The cry'r was order'd to dismiss  The court so made his last O yes  The Goddess would no longer wait  But rising from her chair of state  Left all below at six and sev'n  Harness'd her doves and flew to heav'n  ALMA OR THE PROGRESS OF THE MIND    Incert ad Stobaeum  What Prior meant by this poem I can't understand▪ by the Greek motto to it one would think it was either to laugh at the subject or his reader There are some parts of it very fine and let them save the badness of the rest  CANTO I  MATTHEW met Richard when or where  From story is not mighty clear  Of many knotty points they spoke  And pro and con by turns they took  Rats half the manuscript have eat  Dire hunger which we still regret  O may they ne'er again digest  The horrors of so sad a feast  Yet less our grief if what remains  Dear Jacob by thy care and pains  Shall be to future times convey'd  It thus begins  * * * * Here Matthew said  Alma in verse in prose the Mind  By Aristotle's pen defin'd  Throughout the body squat or tall  Is bona fide all in all  And yet slap dash is all again  In ev'ry sinew nerve and vein  Runs here and there like Hamlet's ghost  While every where she rules the roast  This system Richard we are told  The men of Oxford firmly hold  The Cambridge wits you know deny  With ipse dixit to comply  They say for in good truth they speak  With small respect of that old Greek  That putting all his words together  'Tis three blue beans one blue bladder  Alma they strenuously maintain  Sits cockhorse on her throne the brain  And from that seat of thought dispenses  Her sov'reign pleasure to the senses  Two optic nerves they say she tyes  Like spectacles across the eyes  By which the spirits bring her word  Whene'er the balls are fix'd or stirr'd  How quick at park and play they strike  The duke they court the toast they like  And at St James's turn their grace  From former friends now out of place  Without these aids to be more serious  Her pow'r they hold had been precarious  The eyes might have conspir'd her ruin  And she not known what they were doing  Foolish it had been and unkind  That they should see and she be blind  Wise nature likewise they suppose  Has drawn two conduits down our nose  Could Alma else with judgment tell  When cabbage stinks or roses smell  Or who would ask for her opinion  Between an oyster and an onion  For from most bodies Dick you know  Some little bits ask leave to flow  And as thro' these canals they roll  Bring up a sample of the whole  Like footmen running before coaches  To tell the inn what lord approaches  By nerves about our palate plac'd  She likewise judges of the taste  Else dismal thought our warlike men  Might drink thick Port for fine Champagne  And our illjudging wives and daughters  Mistake small beer for Citronwaters  Hence too that she might better hear  She sets a drum at either ear  And loud or gentle harsh or sweet  Are but the alarums which they beat  Last to enjoy her sense of feeling  A thing she much delights to deal in  A thousand little nerves she sends  Quite to our toes and fingers' ends  And these in gratitude again  Return their spirits to the brain  In which their figure being printed  As just before I think I hinted  Alma inform'd can try the case  As she had been upon the place  Thus while the judge gives diff'rent journeys  To country counsel and attornies  He on the bench in quiet sits  Deciding as they bring the writs  The Pope thus prays and sleeps at Rome  And very seldom stirs from home  Yet sending forth his holy spies  And having heard what they advise  He rules the church's blest dominions  And sets men's faith by his opinions  The scholars of the Stagyrite  Who for the old opinion fight  Would make their modern friends confess  The diff'rence but from more to less  The Mind say they while you sustain  To hold her station in the brain  You grant at least she is extended  Ergo the whole dispute is ended  For till tomorrow should you plead  From form and structure of the head  The mind as visibly is seen  Extended thro' the whole Machine  Why should all honour then be ta'en  From lower parts to load the brain  When other limbs we plainly see  Each in his way as brisk as he  For music grant the head receive it  It is the artist's hand that gave it  And though the skull may wear the laurel  The soldier's arm maintains the quarrel  Besides the nostrils ears and eyes  Are not his parts but his allies  Ev'n what you hear the tongue proclaim  Comes ab origine from them  What could the head perform alone  If all their friendly aids were gone  A foolish figure he must make  Do nothing else but sleep and ake  Nor matters it that you can show  How to the head the spirits go  Those spirits started from some goal  Before they thro' the veins could roll  Now we should hold them much to blame  If they went back before they came  If therefore as we must suppose  They came from fingers and from toes  Or toes or fingers in this case  Of Numscull's self should take the place  Disputing fair you grant thus much  That all sensation is but touch  Dip but your toes into cold water  Their correspondent teeth will chatter  And strike the bottom of your feet  You set your head into a heat  The bully beat and happy lover  Confess that feeling lies all over  Note here Lucretius dares to teach  As all our youth may learn from Creech  That eyes were made but could not view  Nor hands embrace nor feet pursue  But heedless nature did produce  The members first and then the use  What each must act was yet unknown  Till all is mov'd by chance alone  A man first builds a country seat  Then finds the walls not good to eat  Another plants and wond'ring sees  Nor books nor medals on his trees  Yet poet and philosopher  Was he who durst such whims aver  Blest for his sake be human reason  That came at all tho' late in season  But no man sure e'er left his house  And saddled Ball with thoughts so wild  To bring a midwife to his spouse  Before he knew she was with child  And no man ever reapt his corn  Or from the oven drew his bread  Ere hinds and bakers yet were born  That taught them both to sow and knead  Before they're ask'd can maids refuse  CanPray says Dick hold in your muse  While you Pindaric truths rehearse  She hobbles in alternate verse  Verse Mat reply'd is that my care  Go on quoth Richard soft and fair  This looks friend Dick as nature had  But exercis'd the Salesman's trade  As if she haply had sat down  And cut out cloaths for half the town  Then sent them out to Monmouthstreet  To try what persons they would fit  But ev'ry free and licens'd taylor  Would in this Thesis find a failure  Should whims like these his head perplex  How could he work for either sex  His cloaths as atoms might prevail  Might fit a pismire or a whale  No no he views with studious pleasure  Your shape before he takes your measure  For real Kate he made the boddice  And not for an ideal goddess  No error near his shopboard lurk'd  He knew the folks for whom he work'd  Still to their size he aim'd his skill  Else pr'ythee who would pay his bill  Next Dick if Chance herself should vary  Observe how matters would miscarry  Across your eyes friend place your shoes  Your spectacles upon your toes  Then you and Memmius shall agree  How nicely men would walk or see  But Wisdom peevish and crossgrain'd  Must be oppos'd to be sustain'd  And still your knowledge will increase  As you make other people's less  In arms and science 'tis the same  Our rival's hurts create our fame  At Faubert's if disputes arise  Among the champions for the prize  To prove who gave the fairer butt  John shews the chalks on Robert's coat  So for the honour of your book  It tells where other folks mistook  And as their notions you confound  Those you invent get farther ground  The commentators on old Aristotle 'tis urg'd in judgment vary  They to their own conceits have brought  The image of his gen'ral thought  Just as the melancholy eye  Sees fleets and armies in the sky  And to the poor apprentice ear  The bell sounds Whittington lordMay'r  The conj'rer thus explains his scheme  Thus spirits walk and prophets dream  North Britons thus have second sight  And Germans free from gunshot fight  Theodoret and Origen  And fifty other learned men  Attest that if their comments find  The traces of their master's mind  Alma can ne'er decay or die  This flatly t'other sect deny  Simplicius Theophrast Durand  Great names but hard in verse to stand  They wonder men should have mistook  The tenets of their master's book  And hold that Alma yields her breath  O'ercome by age and seiz'd by death  Now which were wise and which were fools  Poor Alma sits between two stools  The more she reads the more perplext  The comment ruining the text  Now fears now hopes her doubtful fate  But Richard let her look to that  Whilst we our own affairs pursue  These diff'rent systems old or new  A man with half an eye may see  Were only form'd to disagree  Now to bring things to fair conclusion  And save much Christian ink's effusion  Let me propose an healing scheme  And sail along the middle stream  For Dick if we could reconcile  Old Aristotle with Gassendus  How many would admire our toil  And yet how few would comprehend us  Here Richard let my scheme commence  Oh may my words be lost in sense  While pleas'd Thalia deigns to write  The slips and bounds of Alma's flight  My simple system shall suppose  That Alma enters at the toes  That then she mounts by just degrees  Up to the ancles legs and knees  Next as the sap of life does rise  She lends her vigor to the thighs  And all these underregions past  She nestles somewhere near the waist  Gives pain or pleasure grief or laughter  As we shall shew at large hereafter  Mature if not improv'd by time  Up to the heart she loves to climb  From thence compell'd by craft and age  She makes the head her latest stage  From the feet upward to the head  Pithy and short says Dick proceed  Dick this is not an idle notion  Observe the progress of the motion  First I demonstratively prove  That feet were only made to move  And legs desire to come and go  For they have nothing else to do  Hence long before the child can crawl  He learns to kick and wince and sprawl  To hinder which your midwife knows  To bind those parts extremely close  Lest Alma newly enter'd in  And stunn'd at her own christ'ning's din  Fearful of future grief and pain  Sould silently sneak out again  Full piteous seems young Alma's case  As in a luckless gamester's place  She would not play yet must not pass▪  Again as she grows something stronger  And master's feet are swath'd no longer  If in the night too oft he kicks  Or shows his Locomotive tricks  These first assaults fat Kate repays him  When half asleep she overlays him  Now mark dear Richard from the age  That children tread this wordly stage  Broomstaff or poker they bestride  And round the parlor love to ride  Till thoughtful father's pious care  Provides his brood next Smithfield fair  With supplemental hobbyhorses  And happy be their infant courses  Hence for some years they ne'er stand still  Their legs you see direct their will  From opening morn till setting sun  Around the fields and woods they run  They frisk and dance and leap and play  Nor heed what Friend or Snape can say  To her next stage as Alma flies  And likes as I have said the thighs  With sympathetic power she warms  Their good allies and friends the arms  While Betty dances on the green  And Susan is at schoolball seen  While John for ninepins does declare  And Roger loves to pitch the bar  Both legs and arms spontaneous move  Which was the thing I meant to prove  Another motion now she makes  O need I name the seat she takes  His thought quite chang'd the stripling finds  The sport and race no more he minds  Neglected Tray and Pointer lie  And covies unmolested fly  Sudden the jocund plain he leaves  And for the nymph in secret grieves  In dying accents he complains  Of cruel fires and raging pains  The nymph too longs to be alone  Leaves all the swains and sighs for one  The nymph is warm'd with young desire  And feels and dies to quench his fire  They meet each evening in the grove  Their parley but augments their love  So to the priest their case they tell  He ties the knot and all goes well  But O my Muse just distance keep  Thou art a maid and must not peep  In nine months time the boddice loose  And petticoats too short disclose  That at this age the active mind  About the waist lies most confin'd  And that young life and quick'ning sense  Spring from his influence darted thence  So from the middle of the world  The Sun's prolific rays are hurl'd  'Tis from that seat he darts those beams  Which quicken earth with genial flames  Dick who thus long had passive sat  Here stroak'd his chin and cock'd his hat  Then slapp'd his hand upon the board  And thus the youth put in his word  Love's advocates sweet fir would find him  A higher place than you assign'd him  Love's advocates Dick who are chose  The poets you may well suppose  I'm sorry sir you have discarded  The men with whom till now you herded  Prosemen alone for private ends  I thought forsook their ancient friends  "In cor stillavit" cries Lucretius  If he may be allowed to teach us  The selfsame thing soft Ovid says  A proper judge in such a case  Horace his phrase is "torret jecur"  And happy was that curious speaker  Here Virgil too has plac'd this passion  What signifies too long quotation  In Ode and Epic plain the case is  That love holds one of these two places  Dick without passion or reflection  I'll straight demolish this objection  First poets all the world agrees  Write half to profit half to please  Matter and figure they produce  For garnish this and that for use  And in the structure of their feasts  They seek to feed and please their guests  But one may balk this good intent  And take things otherwise than meant  Thus if you dine with my lordmay'r  Roastbeef and ven'son is your fare  Thence you proceed to swan and bustard  And persevere in tart and custard  But Tulipleaves and Lemonpeel  Help only to adorn the meal  And painted flags superb and neat  Proclaim you welcome to the treat  The man of sense his meat devours  But only smells the peel and flow'rs  And he must be an idle dreamer  Who leaves the pie and gnaws the streamer  That Cupid goes with bow and arrows  And Venus keeps her coach and sparrows  Is all but emblem to acquaint one  The son is sharp the mother wanton  Such images have sometimes shown  A mystic sense but oftner none  For who conceives what bards devise  That Heav'n is plac'd in Celia's eyes  Or where's the sense direct and moral  That teeth are pearl or lips are coral  Your Horace owns he various writ  As wild or sober maggots bit  And where too much the poet ranted  The sage philosopher recanted  His grave Epistles may disprove  The wanton Odes he made to love  Lucretius keeps a mighty pother  With Cupid and his fancy'd mother  Calls her great queen of earth and air  Declares that winds and seas obey her  And while her honour he rehearses  Implores her to inspire his verses  Yet free from this poetic madness  Next page he says in sober sadness  That she and all her fellowgods  Sit idling in their high abodes  Regardless of this world below  Our health or hanging weal or woe  Nor once disturb their heav'nly spirits  With Scapin's cheats or Caesar's merits  Nor e'er can Latin poets prove  Where lies the real seat of love  Jecur they burn and Cor they pierce  As either best supplies their verse  And if folks ask the reason for't  Say one was long and t'other short  Thus I presume the British Muse  May take the freedom strangers use  In prose our property is greater  Why should it then be less in metre  If Cupid throws a single dart  We make him wound the lover's heart  But if he takes his bow and quiver  'Tis sure he must transfix the Liver  For rhime with reason may dispense  And sound has right to govern sense  But let your friends in verse suppose  What ne'er shall be allow'd in prose  Anatomists can make it clear  The Liver minds his own affair  Kindly supplies our public uses  And parts and strains the vital juices  Still lays some useful bile aside  To tinge the chyle's insipid tide  Else we should want both gibe and satyr  And all be burst with pure goodnature  Now gall is bitter with a witness  And love is all delight and sweetness  My logic then has lost its aim  If sweet and bitter be the same  And he methinks is no great scholar  Who can mistake desire for choler  The like may of the Heart be said  Courage and terror there are bred  All those whose hearts are loose and low  Start if they hear but the Tattoo  And mighty physical their fear is  For soon as noise of combat near is  Their heart descending to their breeches  Must give their stomach cruel twitches  But heroes who o'ercome or die  Have their hearts hung extremely high  The strings of which in battles heat  Against their very Corslets beat  Keep time with their own trumpet's measure  And yield 'em most excessive pleasure  Now if 'tis chiefly in the heart  That courage does itself exert  'Twill be prodigious hard to prove  That this is eke the throne of love  Would nature make one place the seat  Of fond desire and fell debate  Most people only take delight in  Those hours when they are tir'd with fighting  And has no man but who has kill'd  A father right to get a child  These notions then I think but idle  And love shall still possess the middle  This truth more plainly to discover  Suppose your hero were a lover  Tho' he before had gall and rage  Which death or conquest must asswage  He grows dispirited and low  He hates the fight and shuns the foe  In scornful sloth Achilles slept  And for his wench like TallBoy wept  Nor would return to war and slaughter  Till they brought back the parson's daughter  Antonius fled from Actium's coast  Augustus pressing Asia lost  His sails by Cupid's hand unfurl'd  To keep the fair he gave the world  Edward our Fourth rever'd and crown'd  Vig'rous in youth in arms renown'd  While England's voice and Warwick's care  Design'd him Gallia's beauteous heir  Chang'd peace and pow'r for rage and wars  Only to dry one widow's tears  France's Fourth Henry we may see  A servant to the sair D'Estree  When quitting Coutras prosp'rous field  And fortune taught at length to yield  He from his guards and midnight tent  Disguis'd o'er hills and vallies went  To wanton with the sprightly dame  And in his pleasure lost his fame  Bold is the critic who dares prove  These heroes were no friends to love  And bolder he who dares aver  That they were enemies to war  Yet when their thought should now or never  Have rais'd their Heart or fir'd their Liver  Fond Alma to those parts was gone  Which love more justly calls his own  Examples I could cite you more  But be contented with these sour  For when one's proofs are aptly chosen  Four are as valid as four dozen  One came from Greece and one from Rome  The other two grew nearer home  For some in ancient books delight  Others prefer what moderns write  Now I should be extremely loth  Not to be thought expert in both  CANTO II  BUT shall we take the Muse abroad  To drop her idly on the road  And leave our subject in the middle  As Butler did his Bear and Fiddle  Yet he consummate master knew  When to recede and where pursue  His noble negligences teach  What others toils despair to reach  He perfect dancer climbs the rope  And balances your fear and hope  If after some distinguish'd leap  He drops his pole and seems to slip  Straight gathering all his active strength  He rises higher half his length  With wonder you approve his slight  And owe your pleasure to your fright  But like poor Andrew I advance  False mimic of my master's dance  Around the cord awhile I sprawl  And thence tho' low in earnest fall  My preface tells you I digress'd  He's half absolv'd who has confess'd  I like quoth Dick your simile  And in return take two from me  As masters in the Clare obscure  With various light your eyes allure  A flaming yellow here they spread  Draw off in blue or change in red  Yet from these colours oddly mix'd  Your sight upon the whole is fix'd  Or as again your courtly dames  Whose cloaths returning birthday claims  By arts improve the stuffs they vary  And things are best as most contrary  The gown with stiff embroid'ry shining  Looks charming with a slighter lining  The out if Indian figure stain  The inside must be rich and plain  So you great authors have thought fit  To make digression temper wit  When arguments too fiercely glare  You calm 'em with a milder air  To break their points you turn their force  And Furbelow the plain discourse  Richard quoth Mat these words of thine  Speak something sly and something fine  But I shall e'en resume my theme  However thou may'st praise or blame  As people marry now and settle  Fierce love abates his usual mettle  Worldly desires and houshold cares  Disturb the godhead's soft affairs  So now as health or temper changes  In larger compass Alma ranges  This day below the next above  As light or solid whimsies move  So merchant has his house in town  And country seat near BanstedDown  From one he dates his foreign letters  Sends out his goods and duns his debtors  In t'other at his hours of leisure  He smokes his pipe and takes his pleasure  And now your matrimonial Cupid  Lash'd on by time grows tir'd and stupid  For story and experience tell us  That man grows old and woman jealous  Both would their little ends secure  He sighs for freedom she for pow'r  His wishes tend abroad to roam  And her's to domineer at home  Thus passion flags by slow degrees  And ruffled more delighted less  The busy mind does seldom go  To those once charming seats below  But in the breast incamp'd prepares  For well bred feints and future wars  The man suspects his lady's crying  When he last autumn lay a dying  Was but to gain him to appoint her  By codicil a larger jointure  The woman finds it all a trick  That he could swoon when she was sick  And knows that in that grief he reckon'd  On blackey'd Susan for his second  Thus having strove some tedious years  With feign'd desires and real fears  And tir'd with answers and replies  Of John affirms and Martha lies  Leaving this endless altercation  The mind affects a higher station  Poltis that gen'rous king of Thrace  I think was in this very case  All Asia now was by the ears  And Gods beat up for volunteers  To Greece and Troy while Poltis sat  In quiet governing his state  And whence said the pacific king  Does all this noise and discord spring  Why Paris took Atrides' wife  With ease I could compose this strife  The injur'd hero should not lose  Nor the young lover want a spouse  But Helen chang'd her first condition  Without her husband's just permission  What from the dame can Paris hope  She may as well from him elope  Again how can her old good man  With honour take her back again  From hence I logically gather  The woman cannot live with either  Now I have two right honest wives  For whose possession no man strives  One to Atrides I will send  And t'other to my Trojan friend  Each prince shall thus with honour have  What both so warmly seem to crave  The wrath of gods and men shall cease  And Poltis live and die in peace  Dick if this story pleaseth thee  Pray thank Dan Pope who told it me  Howe'er swift Alma's flight may vary  Take this by way of Carollary  Some limbs she finds the very same  In place and dignity and name  These dwell at such convenient distance  That each can give his friend assistance  Thus he who runs or dances begs  The equal vigor of two legs  So much to both does Alma trust  She ne'er regards which goes the first  Teague could make neither of them stay  When with himself he ran away  The man who struggles in the fight  Fatigues left arm as well as right  For whilst one hand exalts the blow  And on the earth extends the foe  T'other would take it wond'rous ill  If in your pocket he lay still  And when you shoot and shut one eye  You cannot think he would deny  To lend the t'other friendly aid  Or wink as coward and afraid  No sir whilst he withdraws his flame  His comrade takes the surer aim  One moment if his beams recede  As soon as e'er the bird is dead  Opening again he lays his claim  To half the profit half the fame  And helps to pocket up the game  'Tis thus one tradesman slips away  To give his partner fairer play  Some limbs again in bulk or stature  Unlike and not akin by nature  In concert act like modern friends  Because one serves the t'other's ends  The arm thus waits upon the heart  So quick to take the bully's part  That one tho' warm decides more slow  Than t'other executes the blow  A standerby may chance to have it  Ere Hack himself perceives he gave it  The am'rous eyes thus always go  Astrolling for their friends below  For long before the 'squire and dame  Have tête à tête reliev'd their flame  Ere visits yet are brought about  The eye by sympathy looks out  Knows Florimel and longs to meet her  And if he sees is sure to greet her  Tho' at sashwindow on the stairs  At court nay authors say at pray'rs  The funeral of some valiant knight  May give this thing its proper light  View his two gantlets these declare  That both his hands were us'd to war  And from his two gilt spurs 'tis learn'd  His feet were equally concern'd  But have you not with thought beheld  The sword hang dangling o'er the shield  Which shows the breast that plate was us'd to  Had an ally right arm to trust to  And by the peepholes in his crest  Is it not virtually confest  That there his eyes took distant aim  And glanc'd respect to that bright dame  In whose delight his hope was center'd  And for whose glove his life he ventur'd  Objections to my general system  May rise perhaps and I have mist them  But I can call to my assistance  Proximity mark that and distance  Can prove that all things on occasion  Love union and desire adhesion  That Alma merely is a scale  And motives like the weights prevail  If neither side turn down or up  With loss or gain with fear or hope  The balance always would hang ev'n  Like Mah'met's tomb 'twixt earth and heav'n  This Richard is a curious case  Suppose your eyes sent equal rays  Upon two distant pots of ale  Not knowing which was mild or stale  In this sad state your doubtful choice  Would never have the casting voice  Which best or worst you could not think  And die you must for want of drink  Unless some chance inclines your sight  Setting one pot in fairer light  Then you prefer or A or B  As lines and angles best agree  Your sense resolv'd impells your will  She guides your handSo drink your fill  Have you not seen a baker's maid  Between two equal panniers sway'd  Her tallies useless lie and idle  If plac'd exactly in the middle  But forc'd from this unactive state  By virtue of some casual weight  On either side you hear 'em clatter  And judge of right and lefthand matter  Now Richard this coercive force  Without your choice must take its course  Great kings to wars are pointed forth  Like loaded needles to the north  And thou and I by pow'r unseen  Are barely passive and suck'd in  To Henault's vaults or Celia's chamber  As straw and paper are by amber  If we sit down to play or set  Suppose at Ombre or Basset  Let people call us cheats or fools  Our cards and we are equal tools  We sure in vain the cards condemn  Ourselves both cut and shuffle them  In vain on Fortune's aid rely  She only is a standerby  Poor men poor papers we and they  Do some impulsive force obey  And are but play'd withdo not play  But space and matter we shou'd blame  They palm'd the trick that lost the game  Thus to save further contradiction  Against what you may think but fiction  I for attraction Dick declare  Deny it those bold men that dare  As well your motion as your thought  Is all by hidden impulse wrought  Ev'n saying that you think or walk  How like a country 'squire you talk  Mark thenWhere fancy or desire  Collects the beams of vital fire  Into that limb fair Alma slides  And there pro tempore resides  She dwells in Nicholini's tongue  When Pyrrhus chants the heav'nly song  When Pedro does the lute command  She guides the cunning artist's hand  Thro' Macer's gullet she runs down  When the vile glutton dines alone  And void of modesty and thought  She follow's Bibo's endless draught  Thro' the soft sex again she ranges  As youth caprice or fashion changes  Fair Alma careless and serene  In Fanny's sprightly eyes is seen  While they diffuse their infant beams  Themselves not conscious of their flames  Again fair Alma sits confest  On Florimel's experter breast  When she the rising sigh constrains  And by concealing speaks her pains  In Cynthia's neck fair Alma glows  When the vain thing her jewels shows  When Jenny's stays are newly lac'd  Fair Alma plays about her waist  And when the swelling hoop sustains  The rich brocade fair Alma deigns  Into that lower sphere to enter  Of the large round herself the centre  Again that single limb or feature  Such is the cogent force of nature  Which most did Alma's passion move  In the first object of her love  For ever will be found confest  And printed on the am'rous breast  O Abelard illfated youth  Thy tale will justify this truth  But well I weet that cruel wrong  Adorns a nobler poet's song  Dan Pope for thy misfortune griev'd  With kind concern and skill has weav'd  A silken web and ne'er shall fade  Its colours gently as he laid  The mantle o'er thy sad distress  And Venus shall the texture bless  He o'er the weeping nun has drawn  Such artful folds of sacred lawn  That love with equal grief and pride  Shall see the crime he strives to hide  And softly drawing back the veil  The god shall to his vot'ries tell  Each conscious tear each blushing grace  That deck'd dear Eloisa's face  Happy the poet bless'd the lays  That Buckingham has deign'd to praise  Next Dick as youth and habit sways  A hundred gambols Alma plays  If whilst a boy Jack ran from school  Fond of his huntinghorn and pole  Tho' gout and age his speed detain  Old John halloos his hounds again  By his fireside he starts the hare  And turns her in his wicker chair  His feet however lame you find  Have got the better of his mind  If while the Mind was in her leg  The dance affected nimble Peg  Old Madge bewitch'd at sixtyone  Calls for Green Sleeves and Jumping Joan  In public mask or private ball  From Lincoln'sinn to Goldsmithshall  All Christmass long away she trudges  Trips it with 'prentices and judges  In vain her children urge her stay  And age or palsey bar the way  But if those images prevail  Which whilom did affect the tail  She still renews the ancient scene  Forgets the forty years between  Aukwardly gay and oddly merry  Her scarf pale pink her headknot cherry  O'erheated with ideal rage  She cheats her son to wed her page  If Alma whilst the man was young  Slipp'd up too soon into his tongue  Pleas'd with his own fantastic skill  He lets that weapon ne'er lie still  On any point if you dispute  Depend upon it he'll confute  Change sides and you increase your pain  For he'll confute you back again  For one may speak with Tully's tongue  Yet all the while be in the wrong  And 'tis remarkable that they  Talk most who have the least to say  Your dainty speakers have the curse  To plead bad causes down to worse  As dames who native beauty want  Still uglier look the more they paint  Again if in the female sex  Alma should on this member fix  A cruel and a desp'rate case  From which Heav'n shield my lovely lass  For evermore all care is vain  That would bring Alma down again  As in habitual gout or stone  The only thing that can be done  Is to correct your drink and diet  And keep the inward foe in quiet  So if for any sin of ours  Or our forefathers higher powers  Severe tho' just afflict our life  With that prime ill a talking wife  Till death shall bring the kind relief  We must be patient or be deaf  You know a certain lady Dick  Who saw me when I last was sick  She kindly talk'd at least three hours  Of Plastic forms and Mental pow'rs  Describ'd our preexisting station  Before this vile terrene creation  And lest I should be weary'd Madam  To cut things short came down to Adam  From whence as fast as she was able  She drowns the world and builds up Babel  Thro' Syria Persia Greece she goes  And takes the Romans in the close  But we'll descant on gen'ral nature  This is a system not a satyr  Turn we this globe and let us see  How diff'rent nations disagree  In what we wear or eat and drink  Nay Dick perhaps in what we think  In water as you smell and taste  The soils thro' which it rose and past  In Alma's manners you may read  The place where she was born and bred  One people from their swaddling bands  Releas'd their infants' feet and hands  Here Alma to these limbs was brought  And Sparta's offspring kick'd and fought  Another taught their babes to talk  Ere they could yet in goecarts walk  There Alma settled in the tongue  And orators from Athens sprung  Observe but in these neighb'ring lands  The diff'rent use of mouths and hands  As men repos'd their various hopes  In battles these and those in tropes  In Britain's isles as Heylin notes  The ladies trip in petticoats  Which for the honour of their nation  They quit but on some great occasion  Men there in breeches clad you view  They claim that garment as their due  In Turkey the reverse appears  Long coats the haughty husband wears  And greets his wife with angry speeches  If she be seen without her breeches  In our fantastic climes the fair  With cleanly powder dry their hair  And round their lovely breast and head  Fresh flow'rs their mingled odors shed  Your nicer Hottentots think meet  With tripe and guts to deck their feet  With downcast looks on Totta's legs  The ogling youth most humbly begs  She would not from his hopes remove  At once his breakfast and his love  And if the skittish nymph should fly  He in a double sense must die  We simple Toasters take delight  To see our women's teeth look white  And every saucy illbred fellow  Sneers at a mouth profoundly yellow  In China none hold women sweet  Except their snaggs are black as jett  King Chihu put nine queens to death  Convict on statute Iv'ry Teeth  At Tonquin if a prince shou'd die  As Jesuits write who never lye  The wife and counsellor and priest  Who serv'd him most and lov'd him best  Prepare and light his fun'ral fire  And chearful on the pile expire  In Europe 'twould be hard to find  In each degree one half so kind  Now turn we to the farthest east  And there observe the gentry drest  Prince Giolo and his royal sisters  Scarr'd with ten thousand comely blisters  The marks remaining on the skin  To tell the quality within  Distinguish'd slashes deck the great  As each excels in birth or state  His oyletholes are more and ampler  The king's own body was a samplar  Happy the climate where the beau  Wears the same suit for use and show  And at a small expence your wife  If once well pink'd is cloath'd for life  Westward again the Indian fair  Is nicely smear'd with fat of bear  Before you see you smell your toast  And sweetest she who stinks the most  The finest sparks and cleanliest beaux  Drip from the shoulders to the toes  How sleek their skins their joints how easy  There slovens only are not greasy  I mention'd different ways of breeding  Begin we in our children's reading  To master John the English maid  A hornbook gives of gingerbread  And that the child may learn the better  As he can name he eats the letter  Proceeding thus with vast delight  He spells and knaws from left to right  But shew a Hebrew's hopeful son  Where we suppose the book begun  The child would thank you for your kindness  And read quite backward from our Finis  Devour he learning ne'er so fast  Great A will be reserv'd the last  An equal instance of this matter  Is in the manners of a daughter  In Europe if a harmless maid  By nature and by love betray'd  Should ere a wife become a nurse  Her friends would look on her the worse  In China Dampier's travels tell ye  Look in his index for Pagelli  Soon as the British ships unmoore  And jolly longboat rows to shore  Down comes the nobles of the land  Each brings his daughter in his hand  Beseeching the imperious tar  To make her but one hour his care  The tender mother stands affrighted  Lest her dear daughter should be slighted  And poor miss Yaya dreads the shame  Of going back the maid she came  Observe how custom Dick compels  The lady that in Europe dwells  After her tea she slips away  And what to do one need not say  Now see how great Pomonque's queen  Behav'd herself among the men  Pleas'd with her punch the gallant soul  First drank then water'd in the bowl  And sprinkled in the captain's face  The marks of her peculiar grace  To close this point we need not roam  For instances so far from home  What parts gay France from sober Spain  A little rising rocky chain  Of men born south or north o' th' hill  Those seldom move these ne'er stand still  Dick you love maps and may perceive  Rome not far distant from Geneve  If the good pope remains at home  He's the first prince in Christendome  Choose then good pope at home to stay  Nor westward curious take thy way  Thy way unhappy should'st thou take  From Tiber's bank to LemanLake  Thou art an aged priest no more  But a young flaring painted whore  Thy sex is lost thy town is gone  No longer Rome but Babylon  That some few leagues should make this change  To men unlearn'd seems mighty strange  But need we friend insist on this  Since in the very Cantons Swiss  All your philosophers agree  And prove it plain that one may be  A heretic or true believer  On this or t'other side a river  Here with an artful smile quoth Dick  Your proofs come mighty full and thick  The bard on this extensive chapter  Wound up into poetic rapture  Continu'd Richard call your eye  By night upon a winter sky  Cast it by daylight on the strand  Which compasses fair Albion's land  If you can count the stars that glow  Above or sands that lie below  Into these commonplaces look  Which from great authors I have took  And count the proofs I have collected  To have my writings well protected  These I say by for time of need  And thou may'st at thy leisure read  For standing every critic's rage  I safely will to future age  My System as a gift bequeath  Victorious over spight and death  CANTO III  RICHARD who now was half asleep  Rous'd nor would longer silence keep  And sense like this in vocal breath  Broke from his twofold hedge of teeth  Now if this phrase too harsh be thought  Pope tell the world 'tis not my fault  Old Homer taught us thus to speak  If 'tis not sense at least 'tis Greek  As folks quoth Richard prone to leasing  Say things at first because they're pleasing  Then prove what they have once asserted  Nor care to have their lye deserted  Till their own dreams at length deceive 'em  And oft repeating they believe 'em  Or as again those amorous blades  Who trifle with their mother's maids  Tho' at the first their wild desire  Was but to quench a present fire  Yet if the object of their love  Chance by Lucina's aid to prove  They seldom let the bantling roar  In basket at a neighbour's door  But by the flatt'ring glass of nature  Viewing themselves in Cakebread's feature  With serious thought and care support  What only was begun in sport  Just so with you my friend it fares  Who deal in philosophic wares  Atoms you cut and forms you measure  To gratify your private pleasure  Till airy seeds of casual wit  Do some fantastic birth beget  And pleas'd to find your system mended  Beyond what you at first intended  The happy whimsey you pursue  Till you at length believe it true  Caught by your own delusive art  You fancy first and then assert  Quoth Matthew Friend as far as I  Thro' art or nature cast my eye  This axiom clearly I discern  That one must teach and t'other learn  No fool Pythagoras was thought  Whilst he his weighty doctrines taught  He made his list'ning scholars stand  Their mouth still cover'd with their hand  Else may be some oddthinking youth  Less friend to doctrine than to truth  Might have refus'd to let his ears  Attend the music of the spheres  Deny'd all transmigrating scenes  And introduc'd the use of beans  From great Lucretius take his void  And all the world is quite destroyed  Deny Descart his subtil matter  You leave him neither fire nor water  How oddly would Sir Isaac look  If you in answer to his book  Say in the front of your discourse  That things have no Elastic force  How could our Chymic friends go on  To find the philosopbic stone  If you more pow'rful reasons bring  To prove that there is no such thing  Your chiefs in sciences and arts  Have great contempt of Alma's parts  They find she giddy is or dull  She doubts if things are void or full  And who should be presum'd to tell  What she herself should see or feel  She doubts if two and two make four  Tho' she has told them ten times o'er  It can'tit may beand it must  To which of these must Alma trust  Nay further yet they make her go  In doubting if she doubts or no  Can Syllogism set things right  No majors soon with Minors fight  Or both in friendly consort join'd  The consequence limps false behind  So to some cunningman she goes  And asks of him how much she knows  With patience grave he hears her speak  And from his short notes gives her back  What from her tale he comprehended  Thus the dispute is wisely ended  From the account the loser brings  The conj'ror knows who stole the things  'Squire interrupted Dick since when  Were you amongst these cunningmen  Dear Dick quoth Mat let not thy force  Of eloquence spoil my discourse  I tell thee this is Alma's case  Still asking what some wiseman says  Who does his mind in words reveal  Which all must gra  tho' few can spell  You tell your do  r that y' are ill  And what does he but write a bill  Of which you need not read one letter  The worse the scrawl the dose the better  For if you knew but what you take  Tho' you recover he must break  Ideas Forms and Intellects  Have furnish'd out three diff'rent sects  Substance or Accident divides  All Europe into adverse sides  Now as engag'd in arms or laws  You must have friends to back your cause  In Philosophic matters so  Your judgment must with others' go  For as in senates so in schools  Majority of voices rules  Poor Alma like a lonely deer  O'er hills and dales does doubtful err  With panting haste and quick surprise  From ev'ry leaf that stirs she flies  Till mingled with the neighb'ring herd  She slights what erst she singly fear'd  And now exempt from doubt and dread  She dares pursue if they dare lead  As their example still prevails  She tempts the stream or leaps the pales  He then quoth Dick who by your rule  Thinks for himself becomes a fool  As partyman who leaves the rest  Is call'd but Whimsical at best  Now by your favour master Mat  Like Ralpho here I smell a rat  I must be listed in your sect  Who tho' they teach not can protect  Right Richard Mat in triumph cry'd  So put off all mistrust and pride  And while my principles I beg  Pray answer only with your leg  Believe what friendly I advise  Be first secure and then be wise  The man within the coach that sits  And to another's skill submits  Is safer much whate'er arrives  And warmer too than he that drives  So Dick Adept tuck back thy hair  And I will pour into thy ear  Remarks which none did e'er disclose  In smoothpac'd verse or hobbling prose  Attend dear Dick but don't reply  And thou may'st prove as wise as I  When Alma now in diff'rent ages  Has finish'd her ascending stages  Into the head at length she gets  And there in public grandeur sits  To judge of things and censure wits  Here Richard how could I explain  The various lab'rinths of the brain  Surprise my readers whilst I tell 'em  Of Cerebrum and Cerebellum  How could I play the commentator  On Dura and on Pia Mater  Where hot and cold and dry and wet  Strive each the other's place to get  And with incessant toil and strife  Would keep possession during life  I could demonstrate every pore  Where mem'ry lays up all her store  And to an inch compute the station  'Twixt judgment and imagination  O friend I could display much learning  At least to men of small discerning  The brain contains ten thousand cells  In each some active fancy dwells  Which always is at work and framing  The several follies I was naming  As in a hive's vimineous dome  Ten thousand bees enjoy their home  Each does her studious actions vary  To go and come to fetch and carry  Each still renews her little labour  Nor justles her assiduous neighbour  Eachwhilst this thesis I maintain  I fancy Dick I know thy brain  O with the mighty theme affected  Could I but see thy head dissected  My head quoth Dick to serve your whim  Spare that and take some other limb  Sir in your nice affairs of system  Wise men propose but fools assist 'em  Says Matthew Richard keep thy head  And hold thy peace and I'll proceed  Proceed quoth Dick sir I aver  You have already gone too far  When people once are in the wrong  Each line they add is much too long  Who fastest walks but walks astray  Is only furthest from his way  Bless your conceits must I believe  Howe'er absurd what you conceive  And for your friendship live and die  A Papist in philosophy  I say whatever you maintain  Of Alma in the heart or brain  The plainest man alive may tell ye  Her seat of empire is the belly  From hence she sends out those supplies  Which makes us either stout or wise  The strength of ev'ry other member  Is founded on your bellytimber  The qualms or raptures of your blood  Rise in proportion to your food  And if you would improve your thought  You must be fed as well as taught  Your stomach makes your fabric roll  Just as the bias rules the bowl  That great Achilles might employ  The strength design'd to ruin Troy  He din'd on lion's marrow spread  On toasts of ammunitionbread  But by his mother sent away  Amongst the Thracian girls to play  Effeminate he sat and quiet  Strange product of a cheesecake diet  Now give my argument fair play  And take the thing the other way  The youngster who at nine and three  Drinks with his sisters milk and tea  From breakfast reads till twelve o'clock  Burnet and Heylin Hobbes and Locke  He pays due visits after noon  To cousin Alice and uncle John  At ten from coffeehouse or play  Returning finishes the day  But give him port and potent sack  From Milksop he starts up Mohack  Holds that the happy know no hours  So thro' the street at midnight scow'rs  Breaks watchmen's heads and chairmen's glasses  And thence proceeds to nicking sashes  Till by some tougher hand o'ercome  And first knock'd down and then led home  He damns the footman strikes the maid  And decently reels up to bed  Observe the various operations  Of food and drink in several nations  Was ever Tartar fierce or cruel  Upon the strength of watergruel  But who shall stand his rage and force  If first he rides then eats his horse  Sallads and eggs and lighter fare  Tune the Italian spark's guitar  And if I take Dan Congreve right  Pudding and beef make Britons fight  Tokay and coffee cause this work  Between the German and the Turk  And both as they provisions want  Chicane avoid retire and faint  Hunger and thirst or guns and swords  Give the same death in diff'rent words  To push this argument no further  To starve a man in law is murder  As in a Watch's fine machine  Tho' many artful springs are seen  The added movements which declare  How full the moon how old the year  Derive their secondary pow'r  From that which simply points the hour  For tho' those gimcracks were away  Quare would not swear but Quare would say  However more reduc'd and plain  The watch would still a watch remain  But if the Horal orbite ceases  The whole stands still or breaks to pieces  Is now no longer what it was  And you may e'en go sell the case  So if unprejudic'd you scan  The goings of this clockwork Man  You find a hundred movements made  By fine devices in his head  But 'tis the stomach's solid stroke  That tells his being what's o'clock  If you take off his Rhet'ric trigger  He talks no more in mode and figure  Or clog his Mathematicwheel  His buildings fall his ships stand still  Or lastly break his Politicweight  His voice no longer rules the state  Yet if these finer whims were gone  Your clock tho' plain would still go on  And spoil the engine of digestion  And you entirely change the question  Alma's affairs no pow'r can mend  The jest alas is at an end  Soon ceases all this worldly bustle  And you consign the corpse to Russel  Now make your Alma come or go  From leg to hand from top to toe  Your system without my addition  Is in a very sad condition  So Harlequin extoll'd his horse  Fit for the war or road or course  His mouth was soft his eye was good  His foot was sure as ever trod  One fault he had a fault indeed  And what was that the horse was dead  Dick from these instances and fetches  Thou mak'st of horses clocks and watches  Quoth Mat to me thou seem'st to mean  That Alma is a mere Machine  That telling others what's o'clock  She knows not what herself has struck  But leaves to standersby the trial  Of what is mark'd upon her dial  Here hold a blow good friend quoth Dick  And rais'd his voice exceeding quick  Fight fair Sir what I never meant  Don't you infer In argument  Similies are like songs in love  They much describe they nothing prove  Mat who was here a little gravell'd  Tost up his nose and would have cavill'd  But calling Hermes to his aid  Half pleas'd half angry thus he said  Where mind 'tis for the author's fame  That Matthew call'd and Hermes came  In danger heroes and in doubt  Poets find gods to help 'em out  Friend Richard I begin to see  That you and I shall scarce agree  Observe how oddly you behave  The more I grant the more you crave  But comrade as I said just now  I should affirm and you allow  We systemmakers can sustain  The thesis which you grant was plain  And with remarks and comments teaze ye  In case the thing before was easy  But in a point obscure and dark  We fight as Leibnits did with Clark  And when no reason we can show  Why matters this or that way go  The shortest way the thing we try  And what we know not we deny  True to our own o'erbearing pride  And false to all the world beside  That old philosopher grew cross  Who could not tell what motion was  Because he walk'd against his will  He fac'd down men that he stood still  And he who reading on the heart  When all his Quidlibets of art  Could not expound its pulse and heat  Swore he had never felt it beat  Chrysippus foil'd by Epicurus  Makes bold Jove bless him to assure us  That all things which our mind can view  May be at once both false and true  And Mallbranch has an odd conceit  As ever enter'd Frenchman's pate  Says he so little can our mind  Of matter or of spirit find  That we by guess at least may gather  Something which may be both or neither  Faith Dick I must confess 'tis true  But this is only Entre Nous  That many knotty points there are  Which all discuss but few can clear  As Nature slily had thought fit  For some byends to crossbite wit  Circles to square and cubes to double  Would give a man excessive trouble  The longitude uncertain roams  In spite of Whiston and his bombs  What system Dick has right averr'd  The cause why woman has no beard  Or why as years our frame attack  Our hair grows white our teeth grow black  In points like these we must agree  Our barbers know as much as we  Yet still unable to explain  We must persist the best we can  With care our systems still renew  And prove things likely tho' not true  I could thou see'st in quaint dispute  By dint of Logic strike the mute  With learned skill now push now parry  From Darii to Bocardo vary  And never yield or what is worst  Never conclude the point discours'd  Yet that you hic nunc may know  How much you to my candor owe  I'll from the disputant descend  To show thee I assume the friend  I'll take thy notion for my own  So most philosophers have done  It makes my system more complete  Dick can it have a nobler fate  Take what thou wilt said Dick dear friend  But bring thy matters to an end  I find quoth Mat reproof is vain  Who first offend will first complain  Thou wishest I should make to shoar  Yet still put'st in thy thwarting oar  What I have told thee fifty times  In prose receive for once in rhimes  A huge fat man in countryfair  Or citychurch no matter where  Labour'd and push'd amidst the croud  Still bauling out extremely loud  Lord save us why do people press  Another marking his distress  Friendly reply'd Plump gentleman  Get out as fast as e'er you can  Or cease to push or to exclaim  You make the very croud you blame  Says Dick your moral does not need  The least return so e'en proceed  Your tale howe'er apply'd was short  So far at least I thank you for't  Mat took his thanks and in a tone  More magisterial thus went on  Now Alma settles in the head  As has before been sung or said  And here begins this farce of life  Enter Revenge Ambition Strife  Behold on both sides men advance  To form in earnest Bays's dance  L'Avare not using half his store  Still grumbles that he has no more  Strikes not the present tun for fear  The vintage should be bad next year  And eats today with inward sorrow  And dread of fancied want tomorrow  Abroad if the Surtout you wear  Repels the rigour of the air  Would you be warmer if at home  You had the fabric and the loom  And if two boots keep out the weather  What need you have two hides of leather  Could Pedro think you make no trial  Of a Sonata on his viol  Unless he had the total gut  Whence ev'ry string at first was cut  When Rarus shows you his Cartone  He always tells you with a groan  Where two of that same hand were torn  Long before you or he were born  Poor Vento's mind so much is crost  For part of his Petronius lost  That he can never take the pains  To understand what yet remains  What toil did honest Curio take  What strict enquiries did he make  To get one medal wanting yet  And perfect all his Roman set  'Tis found and O his happy lot  'Tis bought lock'd up and lies forgot  Of these no more you hear him speak  He now begins upon the Greek  These rang'd and shown shall in their turns  Remain obscure as in their urns  My copperlamps at any rate  For being true antique I bought  Yet wisely melted down my plate  On modern models to be wrought  And trifles I alike pursue  Because they're old because they're new  Dick I have seen you with delight  For Georgy make a paperkite  And simple odes too many show ye  My servile complaisance to Cloe  Parents and lovers are decreed  By nature foolsThat's brave indeed  Quoth Dick such truths are worth receiving  Yet still Dick look'd as not believing  Now Alma to divines and prose  I leave thy frauds and crimes and woes  Nor think tonight of thy illnature  But of thy follies idle creature  The turns of thy uncertain wing  nd not the malice of thy sting  Thy pride of being great and wise  I do but mention to despise  I view with anger and disdain  How little gives thee joy or pain  A print a bronze a flow'r a root  A shell a butterfly can do't  Ev'n a romance a tune a rhime  Help thee to pass the redious time  Which else would on thy hand remain  Tho' flown it ne'er looks back again  And cards are dealt and chefsboards brought  To ease the pain of coward thought  Happy result of human wit  That Alma may herself forget  Dick thus we act and thus we are  Or toss'd by hope or sunk by care  With endless pain this man pursues  What if he gain'd he could not use  And t'other fondly hopes to see  What never was nor e'er shall be  We err by use go wrong by rules  In gesture grave in action fools  We join hypocrisy to pride  Doubling the faults we strive to hide  Or grant that with extreme surprize  We find ourselves at sixty wise  And twenty pretty things are known  Of which we can't accomplish one  Whilst as my system says the mind  Is to these upper rooms confin'd  Should I my friend at large repeat  Her borrow'd sense her fond conceit  The bederoll of her vicious tricks  My poem will be too prolix  For could I my remarks sustain  Like Socrates or Miles Montaigne  Who in these times would read my books  But Tom o' Stiles or John o' Nokes  As Brentford kings discreet and wise  After long thought and grave advice  Into Lardella's coffin peeping  Saw nought to cause their mirth or weeping  So Alma now to joy or grief  Superior finds her late relief  Weary'd of being high or great  And nodding in her chair of state  Stunn'd and worn out with endless chat  Of Will did this and Nan said that  She finds poor thing some little crack  Which nature forc'd by time must make  Thro' which she wings her destin'd way  Upward she soars and down drops clay  While some surviving friend supplies  Hic jacet and a hundred lies  O Richard till that day appears  Which must decide our hopes and fears  Would Fortune calm her present rage  And give us playthings for our age  Would Clotho wash her hands in milk  And twist our thread with gold and silk  Would she in friendship peace and plenty  Spin out our years to four times twenty  And should we both in this condition  Have conquer'd love and worse ambition  Else those two passions by the way  May chance to show us scurvy play  Then Richard then should we sit down  Far from the tumult of the town  I fond of my wellchosen seat  My pictures medals books compleat  Or should we mix our friendly talk  O'ershaded in that fav'rite walk  Which thy own hand had whilom planted  Both pleas'd with all we thought we wanted  Yet then ev'n then one cross reflection  Would spoil thy grove and my collection  Thy son and his e'er that may die  And time some uncouth heir supply  Who shall for nothing else be known  But spoiling all that thou hast done  Who set the twigs shall he remember  That is in haste to sell the timber  And what shall of thy woods remain  Except the box that threw the main  Nay may not time and death remove  The near relations whom I love  And my coz Tom or his coz Mary  Who hold the plough or skim the dairy  My fav'rite books and pictures sell  To Smart or Doiley by the ell  Kindly throw in a little figure  And set the price upon the bigger  Those who could never read the Grammar  When my dear volumes touch the hammer  May think books best as richest bound  My copper medals by the pound  May be with learned justice weigh'd  To turn the balance Otho's head  May be thrown in and for the metal  The coin may mend a tinker's kettle  Tir'd with these thoughtsless tir'd than I  Quoth Dick with your philosophy  That people live and die I knew  An hour ago as well as you  And if fate spins us longer years  Or is in haste to take the shears  I know we must both Fortunes try  And bear our evils wet or dry  Yet let the goddess smile or frown  Bread we shall eat or white or brown  And in a cottage or a court  Drink fine Champagne or muddled Port  What need of books these truths to tell  Which folks perceive who cannot spell  And must we spectacles apply  To view what hurts our naked eye  Sir if it be your wisdom's aim  To make me merrier than I am  I'll be all night at your devotion  Come on friend broach the pleasing notion  But if you would depress my thought  Your system is not worth a groat  For Plato's fancies what care I  I hope you would not have me die  Like simple Cato in the play  For any thing that he can say  E'en let him of ideas speak  To heathens in his native Greek  If to be sad is to be wise  I do most heartily despise  Whatever Socrates has said  Or Tully writ or Wanley read  Dear Drift to set our matters right  Remove these papers from my sight  Burn Mat's Descart and Aristottle  Here Jonathan your master's bottle  FINIS
