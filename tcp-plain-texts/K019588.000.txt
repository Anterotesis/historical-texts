 THE HAPPY WATERMAN  DUBLIN SOLD BY WILLIAM WATSON  NO Capelstreet Printer to the Cheap Repository for Religious and Moral Tracts  And by the BOOKSELLERS CHAPMEN and HAWKERS in TOWN and Country  PRICE ONE HALFPENNY  The HAPPY WATERMAN  A Gentleman and lady walking on the banks of the river Thames spied a small ferry boat with a neatly dressed waterman rowing towards them on his nearer approach they read on the stern of his boat these Words THE HAPPY WATERMAN Without taking any notice of it they determined to enter into conversation with him and enquiring into his situation in life they found that he had a wife and five children and supported also an old father and motherinlaw by his own labour The gentleman and lady were upon this still more surprised at the title he had given himself and said "my friend if this is your situation how is it that you call yourself the happy waterman" "I can easily explain this to your satisfaction" answered the young man "if you will give me leave" and they desiring him to proceed he spoke as follows "I have observed that our greatest blessings in life are often looked upon as the greatest distresses and are in fact made such by means of imprudent conduct My father and mother died a few years ago and left  a large family my father was a waterman and I was his assistant in the management of a ferryboat by which he supported his family on his death it was necessary in order to pay his just debts to sell our boat I parted from iteven with tearsbut the distress that I felt spurred me on to industry for I said I will use every kind of diligence to purchase my boat back again I went to the person who had bought it and told him my design he had given five  guineas  for it but told me as I was once the owner that I should have it when ever I could raise five  pounds  "Shall the boat be mine again" said I my heart bounded at the thought"  "I was this time married to a good young woman and we lived in a neighbouring cottage she was young healthy and industrious and so was I and we loved one another What might we not undertake my father used to say to me Always do what is right labour diligently and spend your money carefully and GOD will bless your store We treasured up these rules and determined to try the truth of them My wife had long chiefly supported two aged parents I loved them as my ownand the desire of contributing to their support was an additional spur to my endeavours to repurchase the boat I entered myself as a day labourer in the garden of our squire and my wife was called  occasionally to perform some services at the house and employed herself in needle work spinning or knitting at home not a moment in the day was suffered to pass unemployed we spared for ourselves and furnished all the comforts we could to the poor about us and every week we dropped a little overplus into a fairing boxto buy the BOAT If any accident or charity brought us an additional shilling we did not enlarge our expence but kept it for the BOAT The more care we took the more comfortable we felt for we were the nearer the possession of our little BOAT Our labour was lightened by our looking forward to the attainment of our wishes Our family indeed increased but with it our friends increased also for the cleanliness and frugality which furnished our cottage and the content and chearfulness that appeared in it drew the notice of our rich neighbours of my master and mirstess particularly whose rule was to assist the industrious but not to encourage the idle They did not approve of giving money to the poor but in cold winters or dead times allowed us to buy things at a cheaper rate this was  money to us  for when we counted our little cash for the week's marketing all that was saved to us by our tickets to purchase things at reduced prices went into our "lit  le box" If my children got a penny at school for a  reward to buy gingerbread they brought it home they said to help to buy the BOAT for they would have no gingerbread till daddy had got his boat again Thus from time to time our little store insensibly increased till one pound only was wanting of the five when the following accident happened Coming home one evening from my work I saw in my road a small pocketbook on opening it I found a bank note of ten pounds which plainly enough belonged to my master for his name was upon it and I had also seen him passing that way in the evening it being too late however to return to the house I went on my way When I told my family of the accident the little ones were thrown into a transport of joy My dears said I what is the matter "Oh daddy the BOAT the BOAT we may now have two or three boats" I checked them by my looks and asked them if they recollected whose money that was they said "yours as you found it" I reminded them that I was not the real owner and bid them think how they would all feel supposing a stranger was to take our box of money if I should happen to drop it on the day I went to buy back the boat This thought had the effect on their young minds that I desired they were silent and pale with the representation of such a disaster and I begged it might be a  lesson to them never to forget the golden rule of "doing as they would wish others to do to them for by attention to this certain guide no one would ever do wrong to another I also took the opportunity to explain to them that the possession of the BOAT by dishonest means would never answer since we could not expect the blessing of God upon  bad deeds  To go on with my storythe next morning I put the pocket book into my bosom and went to my work intending as soon as the family rose to give it to my master but what were my feelings when on searching in my bosom it was no where to be found I hasted back along the road I came looking diligently all the way but in vain there was no traces of any such thingI would not return into my cottage because I wished to save my family the pain I felt and in the hope of still recovering the book I went to my work following another path which I also recollected I had gone by on my return to the garden gate I was accosted by the gardener who in a threatening tone told me I was suspected that our master had lost a pocketbook describing what I had found and that I being the only man absent from the garden at the hour of work the rest of the men also denying that they had any such thing there was every reason to conclude that I must have got it  Before I could answer my distssed countenance confirmed the suspicion and another servant coming up said I was detected for that a person had been sent to my house and that my wife and family had owned it all and had described the pocket book I told them the real fact but it seemed to every one unlikely to be true every circumstance was against me and my heart trembles to look back upon it I was arrested and hurried away to prison I protested my innocence but I did not wonder that I gained no credit Great grief now oppressed my heart my poor wife my dear children and my gray headed parents were all at once plunged into want and misery instead of the ease and happiness which we were expecting for we were just arriving at the height of our earthly wishes I had however one consolation left that I knew  I was innocent  and I trusted that by "persevering in honesty" all might come right at last My resolution was as I had certainly been the cause tho' without any design of the second loss of the property that I would offer alas the whole of our little store to make it good as far as in my power and I sent for my wife to give her this sad commission but she informed me that even this sacrifice could be of no avail son said she my master has been at our cottage when I told him freely how you had found the note but unfortunately  had lost it again and I added that I was sure both I and my husband would make the best return in our power after which I produced our little fairing box and begged him to accept the contents which had been so long raising as all we had to offer But Sir said the Waterman conceive my agony when she added that my master angrily refused saying that our being in possession of all that money was of itself the clearest proof of my guilt for it was impossible with my large family and no greater opportunities than my neighbours that I could come honestly by such a sum therefore he was determined to keep me in gaol till I should pay the whole My unhappiness was very great however my mind by degrees began to be more easy for I grew confident that I should not trust in  God  and my own innocence in vainand so it happened one of my fellow labourers proved to be the person who had picked up the note after I had dropped it having come a few minutes after me along the same road to his work and hearing that the suspicion had fallen altogether on me he was tempted to turn the accident to his own advantage and conceal the property which having kept in his own box for a few weeks 'till he thought no suspicion would rest upon him he went and offered the note for change  and being then suspected my master had him taken up and I was released  This second change from so much misery to happiness was almost too much for us My master sent for me with many expressions of concern for what had passed made me give him an account of the means by which I had collected the little fund that fixed his suspicion so strongly upon me I accordingly related the history of it as I have now done and when I came to that part where I checked my children for their inconsiderate joy on my finding the note he rose with much kindness in his looks and putting the bank bill into my hand he said "Take itthe bank note shall be theirs It is the best and only return I can make you as well as a just reward of your honesty and it will be a substantial proof to your children of the goodness of your instructions for they will thus early see and feel the benefit of honesty and virtue"  This kind and worthy gentleman interested himself much in the purchase of my boat which in less than a week I was in full possession of The remainder of my master's bounty and the additional advantage of the ferry has placed me in comfortable circumstances which I humbly trust in God will continue to us as long as we continue our labour and honest diligence and I can say from my long experience  that the fruit of our own industry is always the sweetest I have now also the pleasure of being able to help others for when a rich passenger takes the ferry as my story is well known in the neighbourhood he often gives me more than my fare which enables me to let the next poor person go over for half price  The lady and gentleman were extremely pleased with the waterman's story and willingly joined in calling him the HAPPY WATERMAN They passed over in his ferryboat for the sake of making him an handsome present And from this time becoming acquainted with his family they did them every service in their power giving books and schooling to their little ones and every comfort to the old father and motherin law as long as they survived They were very desirous of knowing what became of the unfortunate fellow labourer who had so dreadful  y gone aside from the principles of honesty and they learnt that he was after a short imprisonment set at liberty by his master at the earnest entreaty of the honest waterman as he said it was partly thro' his carelessness in losing the note that the temptation had fallen in his fellow labourer's way he had moreover a very large family his master also was so good as to consider that he was a man who had not been blessed with a good education in his youth  so that having little fear of God before his eyes and having a great temptation in his way he had been the more easily led to commit this very wicked action by which he would have enriched himself at the expence of an innocent man I have a great pleasure in adding that the thought of what he had done together with the generosity of the waterman had so strong an effect upon this poor fellow that he afterwards had it written upon his cottage door DO AS YOU WOULD BE DONE UNTO And he hath resolved to follow this rule himself in future and also taught it to his children indeed it became a rule well known over the whole parish for every little child having been informed of this story was told that he ought to consider before he did any action whether he would like his brother or sister or school fellow to do the same to him and if not that the action was wrong and not to be done let the profit be ever so great Surely then those who have lived long and seen much of life and have had much religious instruction also should never depart from this simple but certain rule And it is the same to all ranksit requires neither learning or abi  ities to "do as you would be done unto" nor can any station however great no nor any circumstances however trying excuse men from giving their constant attention to it  FINIS  JUST PUBLISHED AND SOLD BY WILLIAM WATSON No CAPELSTREET  Two Wealthy Farmers parts  Price d  Two Shoemakers
