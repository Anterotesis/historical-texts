dine  Not when a gilt Buffet's reflected pride  'Turns you from sound Philosophy aside  Not when from Plate to Plate your eyeballs roll  And the brain dances to the mantling bowl  Hear  Bethel  's Sermon one not vers'd in schools  But strong in sense and wise without the rules  Go work hunt exercise he thus began  Then scorn a homely dinner if you can  Your wine lock'd up your Butler stroll'd abroad  Or kept from fish the River yet unthaw'd  If then plain bread and milk will do the feat  The pleasure lies in you not in the meat  Preach as I please I doubt our curious men  Will chuse a Pheasant still before a Hen  Yet Hens of Guinea full as good I hold  Except you eat the feathers green and gold  Of Carps and Mullets why prefer the great  Tho' cut in pieces e'er my Lord can eat  Yet for small Turbots such esteem profess  Because God made these large the other less  Oldfield with more than Harpy throat endu'd  Cries "send me Gods a whole Hog  A  WestIndian  Term of Gluttony a Hog roasted whole stuff'd with Spice and basted with  Madera  Wine  barbecu'd"  Oh blast it  Southwinds till a stench exhale  Rank as the ripeness of a Rabbit's tail  By what Criterion do ye eat d'ye think  If this is priz'd for sweetness that for stink  When the tir'd Glutton labours thro' a Treat  He'll find no relish in the sweetest Meat  He calls for something bitter something sour  And the rich feast concludes extremely poor  Cheap eggs and herbs and olives still we see  Thus much is left of old Simplicity  The  Robinredbreast  till of late had rest  And children sacred held a  Martin  's nest  Till  Beccaficos  sold so dev'lish dear  To one that was or would have been a Peer  Let me extoll a  Cat  on Oysters fed  I'll have a Party at the  Bedford Head  Or ev'n to crack live  Crawfish  recommend  I'd never doubt at Court to make a friend  'Tis yet in vain I own to keep a pother  About one vice and fall into the other  Between Excess and Famine lies a mean  Plain but not sordid tho' not splendid clean  Avidien  or his Wife no matter which  For him you'll call a  dog and her a bitch  Sell their presented Partridges and Fruits  And humbly live on rabbits and on roots  One halfpint bottle serves them both to dine  And is at once their vinegar and wine  But on some  lucky day as when they found  A lost Bankbill or heard their Son was drown'd  At such a feast  old vinegar to spare  Is what two souls so gen'rous cannot bear  Oyl tho' it stink they drop by drop impart  But sowse the Cabbage with a bounteous heart  He knows to live who keeps the middle state  And neither leans on this side or on that  Nor  stops for one bad Cork his Butler's pay  Swears like Albutius a good Cook away  Nor lets like  Naevius ev'ry error pass  The musty wine foul cloth or greasy glass  Now hear what blessings Temperance can bring  Thus said our Friend and what he said I sing  First Health  The stomach cramm'd from ev'rydish  A Tomb of boil'd and roast and flesh and fish  When Bile and wind and phlegm and acid jar  And all the Man is one intestine war  Remembers oft  the Schoolboys simple fare  The temp'rate fleeps and spirits light as air  How pale each Worshipful and rev'rend Guest  Rise from a Clergy or a City feast  What life in all that ample Body say  What heav'nly Particle inspires the clay  The Soul subsides and wickedly inclines  To seem but mortal ev'n in sound Divines  On morning wings how active springs the Mind  That leaves the load of yesterday behind  How easy ev'ry labour it pursues  How coming to the Poet ev'ry Muse  Not but we may exceed some Holy time  Or tir'd in search of Truth or search of Rhyme  Ill Health some just indulgence may engage  And more the Sickness of long Life Oldage  For fainting Age what cordial drop remains  If our intemp'rate Youth the Vessel drains  Our Fathers prais'd rank Ven'son You suppose  Perhaps young men our Fathers had no nose  Not so a Buck was then a week's repast  And 'twas their point I ween to make it last  Better to keep it till their friends could come  Than eat the sweetest by themselves at home  Why had not I in those good times my birth  E're Coxcombpyes or Coxcombs were on earth  Unworthy He the voice of Fame to hear    That sweetest Musick to an honest ear  For 'faith Lord Fanny you are in the wrong  The World's good word is better than a Song  Who has not learn'd  fresh Sturgeon and Ham pye  Are no rewards for Want and Infamy  When Luxury has lick'd up all thy pelf  Curs'd by thy  Neighbours thy Trustees thy self  To friends to fortune to mankind a shame  Think how Posterity will treat thy name  And  buy a Rope that future times may tell  Thou hast at least bestow'd one penny well  "Right cries his Lordship for a Rogue in need  "To have a Taste is Insolence indeed  "In me 'tis noble suits my birth and state  "My wealth unwieldy and my heap too great"  Then like the Sun let  Bounty spread her ray  And shine that Superfluity away  Oh Impudence of wealth with all thy store  How dar'st thou let one worthy man be poor  Shall half the  newbuilt Churches round thee fall  Make Keys build Bridges or repair Whitehall  Or to thy Country let that heap be lent  As M ** o's was but not at five  per Cent  Who thinks that Fortune cannot change her mind  Prepares a dreadful Jest for all mankind  And  who stands safest tell me is it he  That spreads and swells in puff'd Prosperity  Or blest with little whose preventing care  In Peace provides fit arms against a War  Thus Bethel spoke who always speaks his thought  And always thinks the very thing he ought  His equal mind I copy what I can  And as I love would imitate the Man  In  Southsea  days not happier when surmis'd  The Lord of thousands than ev'n now  Excis'd  In Forests planted by a Father's hand  Than in five acres now of rented land  Content with little I can piddle here  On  Broccoli and mutton round the year  But  ancient friends tho' poor or out of play  That touch my Bell I cannot turn away  'Tis true no  Turbots dignify my boards  But gudgeons flounders what my Thames affords  To Hounslowheath I point and Bansteddown  Thence comes your mutton and these chicks my own  From yon old wallnuttree a show'r shall fall  And grapes longlingring on my only wall  And figs from standard and Espalier join  The dev'l is in you if you cannot dine  Then  chearful healths your Mistress shall have place  And what's more rare a Poet shall say  Grace  Fortune not much of humbling me can boast  Tho' doubletax'd how little have I lost  My Life's amusements have been just the same  Before and after  Standing Armies came  My lands are sold my Father's house is gone  I'll hire another's is not that my own  And yours my friends thro' whose freeopening gate  None comes too early none departs too late  For I who hold sage Homer's rule the best  Welcome the coming speed the going guest  "Pray heav'n it last cries Swift as you go on  "I wish to God this house had been your own  "Pity to build without a son or wife  "Why you'll enjoy it only all your life"  Well if the Use be mine can it concern one  Whether the Name belong to Pope or Vernon  What's  Property  dear Swift you see it alter  From you to me from me to  Peter Walter  Or in a mortgage prove the Lawyer's share  Or in a jointure vanish from the Heir  Or in pure  Equity the case not clear  The Chanc'ry takes your rents for twenty year  At best it falls to some  ungracious son  That cries my father's damn'd and all's my own  Shades that to Ba ** n could retreat afford  Are now the portion of a booby Lord  And Hemsley once proud  Villers Duke of Buckingham  Buckingham's delight  Slides to a Scriv'ner or a City Knight  Let lands and houses have what Lords they will  Let Us be fix'd and our own Masters still
