that you will not suppose me to have been  out of Order  after such a Neglect of writing as can hardly be  excused  on any  other  Score I cannot indeed lay Claim to what the Doctors call an  acute Disease  but  Dizzi∣ness of Head  and  Depression of Spirits  are at  best no  trivial  Maladies and great  Discourage∣ments  to writing There is a lethargic State of  Mind  that deserves your Pity not your Anger though it may require the  Hellebore  of sharp Reproof Why then did you not apply this pungent Remedy before the Disease was gone so far But seriously I pass too much of that Sort of Time wherein I am neither  well  nor  ill  and being unable to ex∣press myself at large am averse to do so by Halves From the strange Laconicism of your Letter I am really in Doubt whether you are not angry at me and yet had rather this were owing to  Anger  that  may  subside than to any persevering  Fondness  you may have for such unusual Brevity Should the latter become habitual I shall see the Letters of a Genius dwindle to  "  per first will advise the Needful  "  God forbid such a Transformation  Your  former  Letter to my great Confusion was dated  Sept  Let me speak first to some few Parts of itThe Lampreys arrived safe and were as good as I ever tasted but every Time I tasted them I wanted  you  and you are mis∣taken  if you imagine I can half relish such Cates  alone  however I return you Thanks  You gave me no Account how far the  Bath  Waters  c  were judged expedient for you A  charitable  Action called you up to Town and you in the Benevolence of your Heart presume that this  accounts for  the Neglect of every Advantage that concerned  yourself  Pray let me know whether the Bath was proper for you at the same Time inform me whe∣ther you were able to serve Mrs H I shall be sorry for  you  as well as  her  if you should miss the Gratification you would derive from the Success of such an Endeavour  Were I rich I would erect a Temple to  Simplicity  and  Grace  or as the latter Word would be  equivocal  to  Simplicity  and  Elegance  I am glad to hear that Mr W has under∣taken to deify the  former  as he will produce better  Grounds  for such a  Consecration  than was ever done by Pagans or by Papists on any  such  Occasion By the Way I take that God∣dess to be a remarkable Friend to Ease and In∣dolence There is another welldeserving Per∣sonage  Delicacy  whose Cause has been strange∣ly deserted by either Mr MELMOTH or Dr LANCASTER  Will it make better for me or worse to say I've not yet written to Mr GRAVES But I will positively write within this Week if it cost me a Dose of Salts to clear my Brain As to what he says about my printing im∣mediately he  may  be  right  and I am  sure  he is  friendly  but more of this in a little Time  Since the Receipt of your last Letter Mr PERCY and his Wife came and spent a good Part of the Week here and  he  also would needs write a Description of the  Leasowes  Du∣ring the latter Part of his Circuit my Friend JAGO and I accompanied him and what was produced on that Occasion you will go near to know in a little Time Mean while I am more and more convinced that no Description of this Place can make any Figure in Print unless some  Strictures  upon  Gardening  and  other  Embellishments be superadded  Mr JAGO has been with me twice having written a Poem in blank Verse which he leaves here for my Revisal 'Tis a descriptive Poem called  EdgeHill  and admits an Account of the Battle fought there together with many legendary Tales and Episodes  About a Week ago I paid a Visit of two or three Days which I had long promised to Lord FOLEY His Table for a Constancy is the most magnificent of any I ever saw eighteen or twenty elegant Dishes a continual Succession of Company his Behaviour perfectly hospitable and his Conversation really entertaining I most readily own myself to have been under a Mistake with Regard to his  companionable  Character My Reception was as agreeable as it could possibly be As to the rest he has a most admirable House and Furniture but without any Room or Utensil that would stand the Test of  mo∣dern  Criticism The Views around him wild and great and the Park capable of being rendered  fine twice  as striking as it is at pre∣sent if he would fell some Oaks under the Value of a Crown and some Hawthorns under  the Value of a Halfpenny but 'tis possible at his Time of Life  c  nothing of this Sort will be undertaken The two Things at present remarkable are his  Lodge  and his  Chapel  The Portico of the former designed by FLEET∣CROFT affords three different and striking Pro∣spects The Chapel is so very superb and ele∣gant that Mrs GATAKER has nothing to do but send you and me  thither  to say our Prayers in it In reality it is perfect Luxury as I truly thought it last  Sunday  Se'ennight  his Pew  is a  Room  with an handsome Fireplace the Ceiling carved painted in Compartments and the Remainder enriched with gilt StuccoOrnaments the Walls enriched in the same Manner the best painted Windows I ever saw the Monument to his Father Mother and Bro∣thers cost he said  l  the middle Aisle rendered comfortable by Iron Stoves in the Shape of Urns the Organ perfectly neat and good in Proportion to its Size and to this Chapel you are led through a Gallery of Pain∣tings seventy Feet longAnd what would you more You'll say a good SermonI really think his Parson is able to preach one  And now I come lastly to speak of your Letter I received on Monday What an uncommon Man you are to take so much Thought for  those  who never took  any  for themselvesI have enquired after Mr WEDDERBURNE and it seems he is a very clever and a very rising Lawyer to whom I am the more obliged for mentioning me as I fear I have not the Honour of being the least known to him  Pray write to me as soon as possible and I will make you Amends if  Writing  will make Amends for the scandalous  Omissions  of which I have been guilty I have somewhat to tell you of Lord L's usual  great Kindness  when the Lords D and W were last at  Hagley  but I have not Time and must conclude my dearest worthiest Friend  your ever obliged W SHENSTONE  LETTER II W SHENSTONE Esq to Mr G  Dear Sir  I DID indeed give you up for lost as a Correspondent and find by your Letter that I am to expect very few future ones I will endeavour all I can to avoid any Sus∣picion of your Indifference for my own Satis∣faction but I don't know for certain that I shall be able unless you assist my Endeavours like my good Genius by a Course of suita∣ble Epistles at certain Distances I myself correspond but very little now so you will meet with the more Indulgence I don't find by your Letter that you have much more Phi∣losophy than me I can't tell indeed what the Situation of your House is I own mine gives me Offence on no other Consideration than that it does not receive a sufficient Num∣ber of polite Friends or that it is not fit to receive them were they so disposed I would  else cultivate an Acquaintance with about three or four in my Neighbourhood that are of a Degree of Elegance and Station superior to the common run But I make it a certain Rule  "  Arcere profanum Vulgus  "  To banish the profane Vulgar  Persons who will despise you for the Want of a good Set of Chairs or an uncouth FireShovel at the same Time that they can't taste any Excel∣lence in a Mind that overlooks those Things or to make a Conceit of this Sentiment with whom 'tis in vain that your Mind is furnish∣ed if the Walls are naked indeed one loses much of one's Acquisitions in Virtue by an Hour's Converse with such as judge of Merit by Money  c  yet I am now and then im∣pelled by the social Passion to sit half an Hour in my Kitchen  I was all along an Admirer of Sir THOMAS HEAD's Humour and Wit and I beg you will represent me in that Light if Occasion happens 'Tis not impossible that I may pe∣netrate this Winter as far as your Neighbour∣hood connecting a Set of Visits which I have in my Eye Tell Mr WHISTLER when you  see him that if he must have  some  Distem∣per I cannot but be pleased that it is one which is the Forerunner of LongevityDon't tell him so neither for the Compliment is trite From the  Birmingham  Gazette  "We hear that on  Thursday  last was married at  Hales Owen  in  Shropshire  Mr J an eminent Gunsmith of this Town to a Sister of the Right Hon F Lord D"  I was yester∣day at the  Grange  where his old Father with a Number of People were celebrating the Nup∣tials of his Son when in the Midst of his Feastings high Jollity and grand Alliance the old Fellow bethought him of a Piece of Tim∣ber in the Neighbourhood that was converti∣ble into good GunStocks and had some of it sent for into the Room by Way of Speci∣men  "  Animae nil magnae Laudis egentes  "  Souls that are desirous of little Praise  Pray is your Sister at  Smelkwick  for I have not heard You said you would give me your Picture which I long earnestly for could not you contrive to have it sent me directly I am quite in your Debt with Regard to downright Goods and Moveables and what is the proper  Subject of an Inventory I will however en∣deavour to be more upon a Par with you with Regard to Presents though I never can with Regard to the Pleasures I have received from your Conversation  I make People wonder at my Exploits in pulling down Walls Hovels CowHouses  c  and my Place is not the same I am that is with Regard to you  a faithful Friend and humble Servant W SHENSTONE  Mr WHISTLER and you and I and Sir T HEAD whom I should name first speaking after the Manner of  Men  have just Variety enough and not too much in our Characters to make an Interview whenever it happens entertainingI mean though we were not old Friends and Acquaintance  LETTER III W SHENSTONE Esq to Mr JAGO  Dear Mr JAGO  THOUGH I have not yet troubled you with a Letter I have not been void of all Enquiry or Information concerning your Situation and Mr HARDY's Health indeed it is now many Weeks since I collected some Particulars from your Brother and I am now impatient for some further Intelligence As to the Particulars of our friendly Reception at  Wroxhall  Mr JOHN JAGO has very probably acquainted you he would however persuade me to give you a distinct Account being as∣sured he says it must be a good Subject for Drollery I don't know how far this would be proper but I think when I write again to my Friend W to give  him  a Sketch of his own Character just as it appeared du∣ring the Time of our Visit I do not mean to give Offence so I shall intermix many  good Parts of his Character together with his Oddities I believe the whole will take up a Sheet of Paper for I have already consider∣ed it He has GoodSense and GoodNature at the Bottom pity he should disguise the former by one continued Air of Buffoonry and the latter by a total Neglect of common De∣corum  Since I came home I have done little else but plant Bushes Hazel Hawthorn CrabTree Elder  c  together with some few flower∣ing Shrubs that I have had given me I think nothing remarkable has occurred only one mi∣serable tempestuous Day I had the Earl of STAMFORD called to see my Walks together with Mr DOVEY of  Birmingham  and two other Gentlemen My Lord promised to come again in Summer and invited me to  Enville  By the Way he is now building a Gothic  GreenHouse  by Mr M's Direction and by all Accounts the Place is worth your seeing when you come into this Country 'tis but about six Miles distant from hence Pray do not you embroil me with Mr M in Regard to the Observations I made in his  Walks Remember there were not a few Things with which I was greatly delighted and if there were a few that I less appeared to ad∣mire it was owing to a Consciousness that I was amongst Friends only and that I thought it foolish to regulate my Expressions by the same Rules of Complaisance which I ought to observe in different Places I say  ought  for he has been exceeding favourable to me in his Representations of the  Leasowes  I hope to see Mr FANCOURT with you here this Spring and why not your Brother He can spend half a Week now and then at  Wroxall  The Duke of S was treated with Cruelty by his Fa∣ther till he was sixtyfive and afterwards scarce survived him to enjoy one Year's Profit of the Estate Such is the Tenure by which we hold our earthly Tenements  LETTER IV W SHENSTONE Esq to Mr WHISTLER  Dear Mr WHISTLER  THIS is the first Evening I have had to myself since I left  Cheltenham  and as one wants some very favourite Subject to en∣gross one's Thoughts a little after a long Dissipation I could think of nothing more ef∣fectual than a Letter to one who has so large a Share in them beside they have given me your Letter from  Bradfield  and I am in Pain till I have acknowledged so affectionate and polite a Present People whose very Foibles are so many Elegancies can scarce write any Thing more agreeable than a plain unaf∣fected Account of them I remember I used to think this a Kind of Distinction between Mr GRAVES and you that the one had the Knack of making his Virtues unenvied and the other of rendering what I perhaps unjustly termed his Weaknesses enviable I am al∣most  afraid of inserting this lest it should seem to injure the superlative Esteem I have of you but I must add that I consider a Mixture of Weaknesses and an ingenuous Con∣fession of them as the most engaging and so∣ciable Part of any Character if I did not I could not allot them you whose Manner is so distinguishedly amiable  Since I left  Cheltenham  I have been at Mr B's in  Bishop'sCastle  I rode one Morning with him about three Miles that I might say I had been in  Wales  and seen  Brecon Caderi∣dis  and  Plinlimmon  with an extensive Chain of other Mountains I called at a small Ale∣house where the People lived all the Winter without any Glass in their Windows I was wondering how they could live so in a more cold Country than you have perhaps expe∣rienced The Wife said  "True it was she could like Glass very well"  "Yes"  says the Hus∣band  "Glass is very genteel that it is"  "Nay  says the Wife  "not for the Gentleelness nei∣ther though it is very genteel that's the Truth on't"  This Circumstance struck me a good deal that they should discover the genteelness  of Glazing and never once think of its  Ex∣pediency  Mr B is a Man you would like upon Acquaintance though as I remember you had some Objection to the Superfluity of his Wit We shall in all Probability have frequent Interviews with him at  Bath London c  He would fain have seduced me to have travelled into  Portugal c  with himself and one Mr MOORE his Neighbour an agreeable modest Man and late Member for  Bishop'sCastle  I declined it for two Reasons first on Ac∣count of the Expence and secondly that I could not think of spending two Years in  this  Part of my Life abroad dead to one's own Coun∣try and procuring at best very perishable and useless Friendships in another If I could have staid I was to have gone with him to a  Welsh  Sessions fraught with Irascibility He is a Justice of Peace there  As to good Acquaintance though I much desire it I have as literally a Genius for avoid∣ing as any one ever had for procuring it I cannot approach within fifty Yards of Servi∣lity for fear of it  I want sadly to talk to you about a thou∣sand Things I have some Notion of spend∣ing a Week at Mr D's Act sublimely and give me the Meeting then notwithstand∣ing  Though I was enamoured with the Polite∣ness of Mr W's Conversation I should not perhaps have been very forward to express my Sentiments if you had not intimated that he made favourable mention of me I begin to grow a little pleased with Prudence and I think it a Debt one owes her to reserve one's Encomiums till one knows any one's mu∣tual Sentiments for certainly he that happens to commend an Enemy happens to condemn himself I beg my Compliments  I believe poor J D is aliveFarther I c  nnot learn  I did not think it possible I could have  so much engaged by love as I have been  atePoor Miss C  It must necessarily be an Honour to a Girl to have pleased a Man of Sense I know not but I am vain in supposing myself of that Number let his Station be how low soever Now it must be a Disgraee to captivate a Fool however high it be the former is the strongest Evidence of Merit the latter of the Want of it  Now I talk of Vanity I beseech you never check yourself in your Letters  I  don't purpose it and I think it makes as pretty a Figure in the Letters of a Man of Taste as it does in the Embroidery of a Beau I am as much yours as human Nature will admit of  Adieu  W SHENSTONE  LETTER V W SHENSTONE Esq to  Dear Sir  WHEN I promised you some Poetry for Mr S I am afraid that through my Desire of recommending myself to his Family my Tongue outrun my Wit If I laid any Sort of  Stress  upon what I was to send I am very sure it did so and when you have read the Trifles enclosed you will be of the same Opinion  It is probable however that I had an Eye to a larger Ode of mine upon the Subject of rural Elegance which I have not now Time either to correct or to transcribe but which I will not fail to communicate to them upon some future Occasion  Or if my Promise regarded a Translation of the Mottos  here  I shall have the best Oppor∣tunity of performing it when I take the Free∣doms  you have allowed me with your po∣lite Description of my Farm  Am I wrong in detaining that PaperFor positively these last few Days I have found myself a good deal feverish and my Head has been so much confused that I was almost tempted to omit this Message In this Case I think your Goodnature would have acquitted me of  Disrespect  but I could not suffer you to leave the Country with so bad an Opinion of my punctuality  It remains that I present my best Respects to Dr TURTON and his Lady and that I wish you an agreeable Journey to  Oxford  I purpose in a few Weeks that you shall be enabled to say something more particular in Regard to M's Poetry in the mean Time I desire that he would accept my Compliments and my Thanks for the Pleasure his Verses have afforded me Above all Things assure Mr ARNOLD of my most unfeigned Esteem and if he discovers any Partiality for my Place or me encourage it that it may induce him on a proper Occasion to favour me once more  with his Company You see I am availing myself of  your  Interest to make all your Friends my own and to attone for this Piece of Sel∣fishness it shall not be my Fault if every Friend I have be not yours at least with some Share of that Regard with which I am  dear Sir  your most faithful humble Servant W SHENSTONE  LETTER VI Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  I Received your agreeable Letter read all the fine Things your I fear prejudiced Goodnature made you say at first distrusted them but when I reflected on the Person who said them I found a strong Inclination rise in me to believe them but how to be convinced I was still at a Loss for I know it is in your Power either to make Flattery pass for Sincerity or Sincerity so justly dreaded from  the Unskilful pleasing But be it as it will I shall be a Gainer by it for if 'tis Flattery it will give me a fair Reputation though un∣deserved with all who hear it but if 'tis true it will assure me I deserve one from all who can like you bestow one  You enquired after Mr D He and his Lady and Miss Bs have drank Tea with me twice within this Fortnight We went to  ChristChurch  Prayers together from thence arrayed in Gold and Silver we rushed into  St John'sChapel  where we stood knelt and sate I won't say prayed the whole ServiceTime for you know it is usual there for Strangers to sit in the Choir which we did to the great Advantage both of the Fan and the SnuffBox which were neither of them long unemployed during Divine Service You know they are great Helps to Devotion Snuff cer∣tainly composes and a Fan may waft a Soul to Heaven before it is aware  Mrs L still perseveres She gave it out before she had seen her that Miss B was like a Cat which when she found Miss B  had heard she wrote a Letter to excuse her∣self and concluded most emphatically with these Words  "No Madam I am not quite so unbred it was not I but CommonFame said you were like a Cat"  I really think here that Mrs L topt Mrs L's Part Mr G is still a Prude I see him sometimes but should be glad to see him of∣tener I know no one Circumstance but Breach of Sincerity that can ever be a Reason with me to slight my Friends If a Friend of mine had broke all Laws both human and divine yet had conspicuously preserved his Integrity to me I should only think myself the more obliged to him and though I pitied him would never forsake him first I should think he had a higher Notion of Friendship and that that was the only Tie which he dared not violate for which Reason I would not dare to be a greater Villain than he I don't know how this Thought came into my Head but you see I was willing to spin it to its full Length if I have gone too far you must impute it to that Rapture of Friendship with which I am yours eternally  A WHISTLER  Oxford  Do write  LETTER VII Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  I HAVE waited thus long upon a dilatory Lawyer called I suppose in  Hebrew Bel∣zebub  at least I am confident Lawyer is but a synonimous Term for the Devil I have stayed and must stay to sign some Parch∣ments which cannot be done without me and his Delay has caused mine in not answering your kind Letter before I must likewise go to  Winchester  on the same Business so that to put you out of a disagreeable Expectation I pluck up Resolution to tell you I am afraid I cannot wait upon you this Summer at once to resist your Kindness and my own In∣clination in my Opinion is a great Act of Resolution at least would be so if I had any Degree of Choice left me but as it is I think the enduring my Disappointment a great Trial of my Patience Mr GRAVES will witness the  Truth of my Misfortune who has been at  Whitchurch  lately and who intended to see you soon I suppose he told you his Errand into these Parts a providential Thing for me and one of the happiest Revolutions in my Life if it succeed as I hope it will My Spirits are quite grown rusty with long and fruitless Expectations of Happiness and no Tools are fine enough to polish or as the Artists say to touch them but yourself or Mr GRAVES I knew nothing of his coming till I saw him for which Reason I looked upon him as mi∣raculous Manna or Food from Heaven  I lament very much that you don't design to be in  London  next Winter I shall be there for about six Weeks towards the Middle of it The Winter we met there I thought a pleasant one and enough to encourage a se∣cond Meeting in the same PlaceThe only Place for Whims practicable there without Re∣proach or falling from that Dignity which 'tis necessary for a Gentleman to maintain in the Country I should like mightily to indulge my Fancy in some innocent private romantic  Expeditions I know not whatBut all Things as I said are possible there  Mr GRAVES tells me you are a great Oe∣conomist If so I hope  London  will be the richer for it and you the finer as  Luxury  is the Daughter of  Industry  and  Industry  again the Mother of  Luxury  each reigning by Turns and so the World goes on If you should go to  London  this Winter you'll call at  Whitchurch  by the Way and we'll go together which will prevent any Disappointment You will always be received here with Acknowledgment of the Favour you do us so say we all and present our Compliments in one Garland to you which I beg you will accept though it is but coarse∣ly put together and you will oblige  Your sincere Friend and most obedient Servant A WHISTLER  Whitchurch  Sept    LETTER VIII Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  I Received your kind Letter and in Spite of all you have said I must still think that the Obligation is entirely on my Side and you have only in my Opinion laid a greater Stress upon it by so generously disclaiming it I am resolved to be pleased with every Thing you say or do and if I were not you are resolved I shall I am very glad you intend me a Visit but am likewise very sorry I must beg you to defer it for some Time our Family talk of going to  Bristol  very soon and as I have no where else to go must go with them If it was in my Power to defer the Journey I would gladly do it to wait on Mr SHEN∣STONE at  Whitchurch  or if I could com∣mand the House in their Absence their Ab∣sence and his Presence would be to me a dou∣ble Happiness But as it is I must at present  be without a Pleasure which I hope will not always thus fly from me I hope the latEnd of this Summer and Mr SHENSTONE will be both more favourable to me and if so I shall reckon that the Spring of the Year is yet to come I who place the Seasons en∣tirely in my own Fancy  I forgot to tell you in my last that the Prin∣cess AMELIA did us the Honour of a Visit at  Whitchurch  though we were obliged to the Stag for it who seemed to fly from the Ho∣nour she designed him and had not Ambition enough as LEE says to meet the Blow half Way or be pleased with Death though in the Royal Presence It was a terrible Day and the Princess was wet through she had rode thirty Miles when I saw her and she rode thirty Miles after that which was six o'Clock at Night in her wet Cloaths and appeared at the DrawingRoom at St  James  's the next Day which was a BirthDay  The Princess with Submission be it spoke gave me no Satisfaction not through any De∣ficiency in her Demeanourbut from the dis∣satisfied  State of Mind I could be contented with nothing less than you and I hope you will be so good as not to let this Disappoint∣ment which I assure you is a great Disappoint∣ment to me be any Objection to my having the Pleasure of your Company another Time With my Service which waits on you I am yours as much as I hope you would have me  viz  Your sincere Friend and humble Servant A WHISTLER  Excuse me if I desire to be remembered to good Mrs ARNOLD whom I look upon to be an Example of the simple Force of mo∣ral Beauty  Sept    LETTER IX Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  I HAVE not received your Letter above a Week ago being but lately come to Town which is the true Reason why I have not an∣swered it Few Reasons and none but good ones shall ever prevent me from presenting my Heart to you but my Journey hither has been prevented partly by ill Health and partly by little illnatured impertinent AccidentsThis Suspense had had an equal Effect on my writing to you I here end my most sincere Apology  Now for NewsI am in  London  for which Reason I suppose I must not be excused tho' I hate it remember very little and am most likely to blunder in the Recital of that little The House of Commons have addressed the King to try MATTHEWS and LESTOCK and six Captains by a CourtMartial and it is  thought some of them will be condemnedPoor GARRICK has been dangerously ill of a Fever this Week but now to my great Sa∣tisfaction there are Hopes of his Recovery nay it is noticed in the  Daily Advertiser  that he will perform a Part next  Wednesday  Night  I have been to wait on Lord D He was very civil and would fain have kept me till he had opened his Heart with a Bottle of Wine at least I imagined his forwarding the Bottle was with that Design but I was engaged I am to call upon him to go to  Ranelagh  a Lord would be a pretty Nosegay in one's Hand if he had the least Variety of Colours nay if he resembled any one Flower of a single Co∣lour except the  Fustus  Mr F I see some∣times but he is not very attractive I always did envy you the Power of Laughing at a Fool by yourself but you are a World within yourself Mr PK I spent an Evening with lately very agreeably but he lives so far off at the CourtEnd of the Town as separates us very much Mr PN I often see and find him a very useful Person But if you were here both agreeable and useful would  vanish and a far superior Enjoyment take Place Mr GRAVES promised to be in  London  for a Week but his little Politics are you know very uncertain I have struck a bold Stroke since I have been in Town I mean a laced Coat for really Waistcoats cost as much and are no Mark of Distinction after all Sir T HEAD comes to Town this Week but I believe I shall not stay above a Week longer so would have you direct to me at  Whitchurch  I design to go to Court one Night I must as you see write short my Paper drawing to an End It is with Pleasure I hear that old People confess a Play is now worth seeing and that GARRICK excels BETTERTON  c  In the Diversity of his Genius he must far exceed him when we see him alternately in a  Rich∣ard  and  Scrub  in a  Lear  and  Abel Drugger  he is truly astonishing This Excellence of our dramatic Representations is another Reason to wish you here CAMPIONI is a charming new Dancer The  Messiah  was performed last Night but I could not goBut I must write no more Tattle I have just been with Mr SHUGBO∣ROUGH and gave him your Orders about the Pamphlets and have picked out some myself  viz  the Odes the new Play and the Poem on  Sickness  I wish there had been any better Prints to have enclosed in this Letter I should have been glad to have sent them The Pamphlets I have ordered to be sent immediately directed to be left at Mr AUDLEY's in  Birmingham  The Regret I always feel for your Absence will ever instruct me how to value you that is beyond what the elaborate Conclusion of a Letter can express therefore I will not endea∣vour to say how much but in an unlimited Manner be fond to remain  yours A WHISTLER  April    George  's Coffeehouse  I have no gilt Paper at Hand which is a Fault pray excuse it Mr PEMBERTON is with me and begs his Service  LETTER X Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Mr SHENSTONE  I Generally write to you because I want to hear from you but having lately wrote to you I now write because I want to see you In short the Case is this I shall be at  Oxford  in about three Weeks Time or sooner and I have Reason to think it will be the last Time I shall be there I mean in my Gown Now as I am willing still to retain an agree∣able Image of the Place where I have spent so many happy Hours I make this Request that you would stamp the last Impression upon my Mind I beg you would meet me there and give me the Confirmation of your Friend∣ship which I shall esteem a greater Honour than all the Degrees the formal Convocation can bestow and I think of you as JUBA does of CATO and declare I would rather have your Praise than Worlds for my Ad∣mirers  I have forgot the Measure but this is directly my Sentiment  I lately wrote you a long Letter as you were so kind to desire and in so very lazy unintellectual a Manner that I am sure half the Mortals who only understand with their Eyes and by the Grammar could never have comprehended but I would converse with you Soul to Soul have a Hint understood by you and not be obliged to a tedious Pe∣riod to communicate a Thought to you I would have my Soul stand naked before you and shiver at the least Breath of Kindness your most distant Meaning shall breathe on it  Oh happy State when Souls each other draw  c  Mr POPE  This I am sure your quick Apprehension is capable of and by a Desire of the strictest Union with you I am fond to believe as well of myself You see I am proposing every Scheme which may unite you more closely to me therefore I beg you will not refuse me the Request I made at the Beginning of my  Letter I will say no more now but when I am with you design to talk away as you shall inspire In the mean Time I boast that it is the most sagacious Instinct which pushes me on to subscribe myself  your most affectionate Friend and humble Servant A WHISTLER  LETTER XI Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  AS Hope is the chief Spring of all our Actions and as Pleasure is the sole Ob∣ject of that Hope you must not wonder if the Stile of this Letter appears more languid than usual How quickly is the Transition of∣ten made from Hope to Despair But a little  While and I thought I already saw you and now I am presently fallen into the Despera∣tion of I know not when The SmallPox which generally frightens away every Thing that's agreeable has made it impossible for me to see you as yetThe last Sentence seems a Compliment to myself but as I am too lazy to alter it I beg you would think with me and interpret every Thing I say in your own Favour But thus the Devil will have it the SmallPox is all over  Oxford  in every Part of the Town in most of the Colleges to my Knowledge and is lately broke out in  Pembroke  If it had not been for this last Ar∣ticle I could gladly have confined myself within the Compass of those Walls with you but as it is I am forced like good Men to submit for a While to human Miseries and comfort myself with the Thought of my Hea∣ven though at a Distance like them too I have this Satisfaction that in the mean Time neither the base Moth or Rust of the World can corrupt that Part of you in which my Pleasure is situated  I have a very bad Piece of News to tell you Mr G lies dangerously ill at  London  of a Fever I am informed his Life is despair∣ed ofI am now in the utmost Concern at it This Letter is a mere Medley disagreeable to myself I don't propose it to be agreeable to you I only wrote it to tell you what you must know and if you can understand it it is very well I am not only in the lowest Spirits but they are also very much confused I will not now moralize but this I am sure we shall both dearly miss Mr G When I hear more you shall know more It is now one o'Clock in the Morning and as I told you I wrote this out of Necessity I cannot be in  Oxford  though I long to see you If poor Mr G should die pray be still more kind to me I am sure I shall then find a Vacancy in my Breast which you alone can fill up to my Satisfaction  Adieu dear Mr SHENSTONE  A WHISTLER  Pray write  I received a Letter from you just after I sent you my last and my Thoughs are at present too confused to answer your last parti∣cularly nor indeed will my Time allow it Only I heartily thank you for it  Whitchurch  near  Reading Berks  LETTER XII Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  August    Dear Sir  YOUR last kind Letter has for a long Time upbraided me with Negligence Ingrati∣tude and Stupidity To the last Part of the Accusation I plead guilty for I think I never found myself more stupid than I have been for this Month past and what I write now proceeds not from any Flow of Fancy but merely from Respect and Esteem I have  been very much taken up of late by our Fa∣mily being at Home but that Excuse I lay no Stress upon for I shall never let any ei∣ther Business or Pleasure hurry you from my Thoughts Ill Health can be my only just Apology and though I cannot say I have been sick I can assure you I have not been well for some Time past Put my Condition in the best Light I am very much in the Va∣pours and so much as that you or Mr GRAVES alone can cure me a Letter from you will go a great deal towards it though I long for one I can hardly go on with this Letter which is the Means to procure it like one sinking into a fainting Fit who can't collect Strength of Mind or Body to reach so much as the Hartshorn to his Nose which stands at his Elbow I shall be at  Oxford  in a short Time and spend as many Days there as I can pass agreeably and then take my Leave of it If the Town be healthy I shall go to  London  the Beginning of the Winter and stay there just as long as it smiles on me But all Things seem to frown in the Absence of my Friends and I wish I don't think the Smiles of the Town impertinent without them  I wish I could be sometimes pleased with less than you without I could have you always Pray write soon and raise my Spirits for I really am forced now to conclude for Want of them  Dear Sir  yours  c c  A WHISTLER  Service to Mr D I sincerely hope he is well  LETTER XIII Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  IF you remember in your last Letter but one you advised me to read History ac∣cordingly as I am always proud to follow your Advice I pitched upon BURNET's  History  of his own Times  I was over Head and Ears engaged in the Disputes between Cavaliers Pro∣testers Resolutioners and God knows who when I received your last Though BURNET values himself particularly on private Intelli∣gence I had a greater Curiosity and enter∣tained far greater Hopes of Pleasure in break∣ing open your Letter nor was I at all de∣ceived I think you wrote if possible more agreeably than usual it raised my Spirits and at the same Time did more than all King CHARLES's Statesmen could do set up an ab∣solute Monarchy in my Breast in a Moment and made you Sovereign there  Mr POWYS had a Child christened yester∣day it was attended to Church by half a Dozen Coaches The great Mr POINTZ was one of the Godfathers and Mrs TOWNSHEND now an Inhabitant of your Parts the God∣mother by Proxy Mrs POWYS went out on Pleasure to the last and if her Horses had not been good and her Coachman dexterous to ply them with the Whip she had been brought to Bed in her Coach as once before she had like to have been at the PlayHouse  Alas for our poor Friend COB  Who shall now sit with Countenance serene  The inoffensive Judge of sacred Song  At once becalm'd with Port and Poetry  While the great SOMERVILLE attunes his Lays  As to what you mentioned about your Poem you can't think me such a Barbarian as that I should expect you should follow my Advice in every Particular I rather think you did me an Honour in doing it at all I know the great Critics have been long endeavouring to be ab∣solute but I think it very unreasonable even in themand I believe you as well as my∣self have too much Spirit to submit to it If I can any Ways assist you by any little Observations you shall have my Thoughts and make use of them at your Pleasure for I am very fond of that Rule of doing as one would be done byLittle Miss L outdoes TOM TINSELL's Widow  If the Town is not vastly unhealthy indeed for I must not regard little Discouragements  as my Affairs are at present I shall spend most Part of the next Winter at  London  You are very friendly to propose to me the most agreeable Scheme in the World but I can't possibly see the  Leasowes  this Summer I be∣lieve it is you not Mrs ARNOLD who have all the Wit of your Country and if all Things naturally attract there alike in that Re∣spect you will prove a very dangerous Neigh∣bour I long to see you as much as you can do to see me but all I can do now is to tell you so and that I am by Honour Friendship and every other Obligation  Yours sincerely A WHISTLER  Sept    LETTER XIV Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Whitchurch  Nov    Dear Sir  I Received you Pacquet fraught with every Thing that could delight me I believe more Wit was never conveyed under the Title of a Peer before not even excepting your own which indeed you generally export by wholesale in the same Method Your Letter led me through an Elysian Scene which de∣lighted me so that I must beg Leave to take another Turn with you at present therein There is no Subject I can treat of with so much Pleasure and of Consequence with so much Advantage to myself In the first Place Dick J in the Point of Light you set him diverts me yet Humanity teaches me to feel a Kind of Pity as for an Animal that sings and hops about the Cage that has just de∣prived him of his Liberty Lady LUXBOROUGH I have seen but not in her Sanctuary where  she delivers her Oracles and displays her Elo∣quence and Elegancies at full This is what my Soul is athirst after the holy Land of a future Pilgrimage You have raised a Devotion in me towards her for we always judge of the Divinity by the Merits of the Priest By your Description of Mr THOMSON I admire him and rejoice in your Acquaintance with him I beg you would cultivate it for it seems like the Dawning of your Fame whose Merit the stupid World only wants to be awakened to see If ever you get your due Share of Fame I insist that you be not a Niggard of it as many are but do your ut∣most Endeavour to communicate it to your FriendsYou see I speak in Time  As for Mr LN's Civility I have no great Faith in it I fear he has only some private End to serve as an Election or so but how∣ever I would have you nourish it for it may breed something by ChanceIt will be a Cre∣dit to you at worstChance often promotes Lingerers at Court who have otherwise very little Hope It may fall out that by serving  you he may serve himself I should like to have seen Signor OUTING poor Man  I think the  Leasowes  a charming Place in itself but not knowing how in my Imagina∣tion at any Time to separate the Work from the Architect I believe I give the former infinitely more Adoration than its due even with all its Improvements You would often see me gliding across the Glades if the Soul was visible You indeed have contrived to make your Soul as it were visible and a very beautiful Soul it is particularly in its last Dress which became it exceedingly I mean ElegyIt was mighty well fancied and dif∣fused a tender languishing Air its highest Cha∣racter I am much indebted to it for this splen∣did Visit spendid I mean in Beauty The two old Songs likewise were very agreeable to me but chiefly  Giles Collins  As for the Song of the  Cat  I am much obliged to you for it but I think the Author sunk quite beneath himself towards the End The Conclusion was too sudden and not worked up enough and besides was exceeding dirty however it was improved by your Alterations upon the whole I  like it and out of my Devotion for the five first Stanzas I have added six more which I submit to your Judgment whether I have supported the true Spirit of the Fragment Pray excuse that I have presumed to omit any of your Alterations because I thought in this new Scheme the Context required it  I live in Hopes of seeing you at  Whitchurch  this Winter and of hearing the happy Tidings when I beg you will let me know some Time before you come that I may get your Bed in order I have but one it was given me and is none of the largest indeed small which at present I lament otherwise I should now give more Invitations I can entertain but one Friend at a Time but all my Friends will be sincerely welcome severally Again I say I lament the Unsociableness of this Scheme but it is not in my Power to alter it Mr G's Affair goes on I am afraid unhappi∣ly As for my own Situation I shall say lit∣tle but leave you to take a Survey of it which I hope you will do soon I think it is cal∣culated for Happiness if a Person of the least  Delicatesse  can be so I rejoice in all you have  rejoiced in and pray for all you pray for as becomes  Your most affectionate Friend and humble Servant A WHISTLER  Pray write  My Idea of Miss FLETCHERS is that they are easy without Impertinence a high Idea in my Opinion Pray give my Compliments to Lord D if in the Country  LETTER XV Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Whitchurch  Nov    Dear Sir  I AM very much obliged to you for your last kind Letter and received your Absolution with a very contrite Heart though I assure you my Sin was not wilful however it was such as  I sincerely lamented even in the Commission I should rather say Omission I am exceeding sorry to find you have so great a Quarrel with  London  I speak sincerely when I say I pro∣pose little Pleasure there without you I said in my last Letter we might contrive to meet there as hitherto I think we have contrived not to do it and if we were to meet I can't but fancy we might make it agreeable to each other I shall go thither immediately after  Christmas  and should be glad to wait on you at  Whitchurch  and from thence to  London  You certainly conclude me happy in having Mr GRAVES so near me and with Reason I should think my Scheme of Friendship com∣plete if you was as near but without that Cir∣cumstance it is far from being so Sir T HEAD and Mr GRAVES spent three Days with me last Week to my great Satisfaction  I have had a Swelling in my Foot which they tell me is the GoutGod forbidbut 'tis certainly like it I intend to go into a Milk Diet immediately for I am terribly alarmed If it should prove so I shall think it a very hard Fate having been no Drinker and even  Multitudes of those escape it but Fortune fa∣vours the Brutes  It was not our Mr POWYS's Landau for he was at Home and besides has never a one I believe Mr GRAVES and I shall return Sir G's Favour soon and spend about a Week with him How shall we all wish for you to be with us That I shall I can be upon my  Bible Oath  and for the rest I think I can answer in the affirmative My Brother is at  Whitchurch  at present who is a constant Com∣panion to me while he stays but I fear that will not be long but Mr GRAVES I design to see often both for Health and Pleasure  What with going to  London  this Win∣ter and  Bristol  in the Summer as I have laid my Scheme for the future I shall make  Whitchurch  not quite so tedious to me and above all the Thought of waiting upon you both in  Oxfordshire  and at the  Leasowes  vastly brightens my future Prospect My Father and Mother desire to join with me in all Civilities to youBut I beg you would believe I sur∣pass most People notwithstanding your appa∣rent  Merit in the extreme Regard I have for you when I subscribe myself  Your most sincere Friend and humble Servant A WHISTLER  My Duty to Lord D I wish his Lord∣ship would favour me with some Franks I should look upon it as an Honour and a Piece of Goodnature A Frank you know would convey them  LETTER XVI Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  I HAVE been extremely busy of late in new modelling my little Habitation and the more so to bring it to some Kind of Perfec∣tion in Order to receive you I have been building up pulling down planting rooting up turning Round to Square and Square to Round In short I don't know but some  prudent People would say I have been playing the Devil Indeed as in other Things in Life my Fancy is so confined by the Smallness of my Possessions that my Scheme is not very expensive 'tis all in the  Lilliputian  Stile and must be so Though I have tried to give it what Air of Magnificence it is capable of I suppose it will strut like many of those un∣fortunate Heroes who happen not to be four Feet and a Half high  Did Lady LUXBOROUGH approve my Senti∣ment of enjoying Things best by Reflection I still maintain my Opinion and endeavour to jus∣tify it thus What we enjoy by Reflection we have pure nay heightened by our own Fancy at the same Time no Inconvenience attends it on the contrary the Pleasure is more poignant by the Contrast The Thought of an IceHouse in the Summer is refreshing and the Imagination of  July  is a Cordial in Frost and Snow besides you well know Hope is the very Hartshorn of Life that enlivens every Thing and particularly attends imaginary Pleasures but vanishes whenever they become realBy Reflection I mean Imagination in general  I have sent you Stanzas on Flowers If Lady LUXBOROUGH likes them I shall be proud of hitting the Pallate of a Lady of so high a Taste I have likewise enclosed another Copy of Versesthough I am in Doubt whether I did not send them to you last Summer they were done then I know you don't love Transla∣tions but I have nothing new besides I set about them merely as an Exercise one Night when I was dull and alone not intending any Thing but tearing them afterwards for I knew it was a wornout SubjectBut a fatherly Af∣fection took Place and I did not care for mur∣dering it though it was a Bastard produced unawares  N B  I beg that nothing of mine may ap∣pear in Print  I admire those two Lines of Lady WORTLEY's very much It is a natural yet uncommon and agreeable Thought I am pleased with the Com∣pliment you make me in saying you always wish me with you to partake any Pleasure and imagine how any Thing extraordinary would  strike me I like it because I know it is a natural and thereby a sincere Thought by my own Heart I am so far gone that Way that I can hardly enjoy any Thing extraordinary without my Friends are with me especially those whom I know it would particularly strike but next to gratifying a Friend is the obser∣ving how new and extraordinary Objects work upon a natural Genius I'll suppose it a Ge∣nius I think it is one of the highest Enter∣tainments in Life when I can meet with such and have an Opportunity I love to read a Play to them though I know I run the Ha∣zard of being laughed at for my Pains but I don't care the Pleasure pays me for all the malicious foolish People can say and you know the natural Criticisms of Sir ROGER DE COVER∣LEY were not thought unworthy the Notice of the  British Spectator  For my Part I have of∣ten thought that it is one of the Amusements of the Supreme Being who planted first the Passions in us to observe the Workings and Effects of them A public Audience gives me Pleasure upon Trust for though I know no one there I always conclude there are some Geniusses  I am of your Opinion with Regard to Mrs at present for I think if her Heart be really engaged which I very much doubt Dishonour in Love is the blackest of all dishonest Actions and of the worst Conse∣quenceBut his precursive Steps were the Ex∣tremity of Folly conducted with the Extremity of Folly but he may be happy and I wish he may be happy in any State of Life I think our Visits to DICK J are fatal his own Mother lay a dying when we were at  Henley  I am very glad to hear you have had so many Amusements It is always agree∣able to me whenever I hear you have met with a flowery Meadow in your sublunary Walk If I have any Taste your  Hercules  is an elegant and truly poetical Poem and su∣perior to L's if it is not I resign my Taste for I'll pin it upon your Poem I don't pretend to Criticism but my Passion for SHAKESPEARE MILTON POPE  c  has made me believe that I have some natural Taste for Beauty I am much obliged to you for the two genteel Copies of Verses they are very pretty and much to my Fancy As for Odes  you have expressed my Sense of them all on that of Dr AKENSIDE they perplex and fret one more than they please and may be de∣scribed by the Title of one of SHAKESPEARE's Plays  viz Much Ado about Nothing  I have no News to send you from hence that will be in the least entertaining to you I am in Hopes Mr GRAVES will settle at  Whitchurch  about  Whitsuntide  I have been much out of Order for this Week by a Cold that I caught in attending my Works and my Foot gives me ugly Apprehensions at pre∣sent I continually please myself with the Thoughts of seeing you at  Whitchurch  but would never have you make an Inconvenience of what I would have be a Pleasure to youI'd have you choose your own Time that you may be quite unembarrassed for my Part I think the sooner the better only I would beg the Favour of one Line to prevent all ill Ac∣cidents I think 'tis a Method which should ever be used and I wonder at my own Im∣prudence and my own Good Fortune last Time I came to the  Leasowes  I long to see you and shall be all this Summer at  Whit∣church  ready to receive you Indeed if I should have the Gout as I something fear it I would let you know for that would inter∣rupt all our Pleasure I beg my Compliments to Mr DOLMAN you have likewise the Com∣pliments of this Place With Wishes to see you and Compliments grounded upon the ut∣most Sincerity I am  Dear Sir  yours to an Excess A WHISTLER  Whitchurch  April    LETTER XVII Mr WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Mr SHENSTONE  YOU see that I am as eager to answer your Letter as you was to answer mine and if my Letter gave you Pain I assure you that yours has equally perplexed me I am  in great Hopes you have misinterpreted my Sense in Regard to Mr G and by as much as I can recollect I believe you have He always speaks of you with the utmost Re∣spect in your Absence and is much less severe even upon what he calls your little Faults than when you are present all that I hinted at was some little Shyness he lately shewed to me on the Account which you and I have often mentioned I have heard you say you have experienced the same from him on the like Score But you could not possibly be now included being absent no I assure you I only spoke of myself and his Fault towards me would have been imperceptible but to the Delicacy of Friendship nor been have worth communicating but to one whom my Love would animate against the like Failing I de∣clare to you the Sentence which included Mr G's Name was the only one which regarded him what followed though I confess that gave Rise to it was only to shew my different Sentiments and I own my Esteem for Friend∣ship carried me a great Length I have been very particular to satisfy you as well as to justify Mr G and by that Means to jus∣tify  myself I should have never have for∣given myself if I had been the Cause though inadvertently of dividing so much Worth as I have always discovered in you both and which though separated it might still continue to bless me yet when united like most other Things it has a more powerful Effect I would not have Mr G know a Word of this for the most trifling Reflection when told again is offensive nor should I have said what I did but to a common Friend in Truth it is not everybody who possibly might feel it so acutely as myself but you know my Disposition I have a Sensibility in my Friendships that arises even to a  Soreness  and the slightest Air of Coolness makes me wince This though in its Consequences sometimes it may render me unpleasing to my Intimates certainly has its Source in a Merit namely in the  Ardour  of my Attachments and therefore I should hope is easily pardonable You remember the ele∣gant Line in COTTON's beautiful Vision of Friendship  "Cold is the only Ill they fear"  After I had sealed my last I was afraid it had rather an Air of Compliment than Since∣rity if it had I assure you it was only the  Air  and what the Goodhumour I am always in when I write to you might inspire me with You see the Esteem I have for you by turn∣ing Critic on myself in your Behalf I am now going to mention what there is no Occa∣sion at all to say but Friendship is the most incontinent Thing in the World I have long been sensible of your Worth that is ever since I knew you but I must say I think it was our last Meeting which entirely united me to you every Letter of yours since has heigh∣tened my Affection for you I look upon this as my first Absence from you your Letters are now necessary to supply your Presence you yourself taught me this Taste of Luxury therefore it is but reasonable you should sup∣port the Expence In short I beg you would write soon I am afraid I shall tire you by so frequent a Correspondence but I particu∣larly long to know the Success of this Letter  Dear Mr SHENSTONE  I am yours c A WHISTLER  LETTER XVIII W SHENSTONE Esq to Miss LOWE  Madam  I Fancy I've been condemned a Thousand Times on Account of not sending the Tunes One of them was lent out and I had not an Opportunity of fetching it till last Week I don't know whether this Reason will prove sufficient but I assure you it was the real one I tore them out of my Book and on that Account you have some others with them I was willing you should have them in the best Shape possible and dare say you'll improve as much upon them as I have dege∣nerated from them  I want exceedingly to hear from you but you will scarce think it consistent with a rural Reputation to write yourself 'Tis indeed scarce worth while to hazard it to give me  ever so great a Pleasure but I could wish you would here remember the Character of a TownLadyLord How does Miss UTY I did not wonder you should mutually envy each other since you are both so great Objects of Envy more particularly as Modesty has taught you to think your own Merit small in Com∣parison with that of others  Voilà la seule Source de toute Envie  I'm surely vastly impertinent for I'm not positive you understand  French  but I guess'd that a Lady so accomplished in all other Particulars might I fancy you've en∣joy'd a vast deal of agreeable Gaiety since I left you whilst I have been wandering about  Harborough  's gloomy Walks and Pools like a Shepherd  "despairing beside a clear Stream"  Oh I want to know whether or no for the common Good of our Society in particu∣lar as of our Country in general it is and may be lawful to admit without the usual Number of Members being present at the So∣lemnity for I judge it better to lay aside some Part of the Ceremony than that any one should die uninitiatedWhether or no as in BaptismI was truly going too farI am  safe enough let me go what Lengths I will in subscribing myself  the humblest of your humble Servants W SHENSTONE  LETTER XIX W SHENSTONE Esq to Mrs A  Dear Madam  I Promised to give you some Account what became of  Cheltenham  after Mr A had pillaged it of all that was most valuable Pos∣sibly before this Time you may have forgot both my Promise and me and it may not be extremely political to renew your Remem∣brance of a Person who has been so long seem∣ingly neglectful The Truth is I can no more bear to be forgot by those I esteem than I  can be censured of Forgetfulness with Regard to them and I know no Way but Writing by which I can evade both  Some Sort of Apology I ought to make that I did not write before you will there∣fore please to observe that I am but just ar∣rived at Home though I left  Cheltenham  the Day after you I stayed indeed to hear Mr B preach a Morning Sermon for which I find Mrs C has allotted him the Hat pre∣ferably to Mr C Perhaps you may not remember nor did I hear till very lately that there is a Hat given annually at  Cheltenham  for the Use of the best foreign Preacher of which the Disposal is assigned to Mrs C to her and her Heirs for ever I remember tho' I knew nothing of this whilst I was upon the Place I used to be a little misdeemful that all who preached there had some such Premium in their Eye This Hat 'tis true is not quite so valuable as that of a  Cardinal  but while it is made a Retribution for Ex∣cellence in so if properly considered sublime a Function it is an Object for a Preacher in any Degree I am sorry at the same Time  to say that as a  common Hat  merely for its  Uses  it would be an Object to too many  Coun∣try Curates  whose Situations and slender In∣comes too often excite our Blushes as well as Compassion There should be no such Thing as a  Journeyman Parson  it is beneath the Dignity of the Profession If we had fewer  Pluralities  in the Church this Indecorum might in a great Measure be abolished  Mr N  Squire  N I hear is fitting up his Castle at  L  for the Reception of the little Widow and the Mercer at  Cheltenham  has completed his grand Arcade for the better Dis∣position of his Crapes and Callimancos  I am an ill Relater of Matters of Fact and as I said before did not continue above four and twenty Hours and some odd Minutes upon the Place longer than you that enquire after it but I survived long enough to hear very frequent Mention of Mrs A Miss CARTER  c  and such Mention as has con∣firmed me in an Opinion that Persons of real Merit without any Expence of Airs  c  will by Degrees engross the Admiration of any Place  they come into But this is a Kind of Lan∣guage you would never indulge me in you might very securely for I should never be able to express half the sincere Esteem and Respect with which I am  Madam  your most obedient humble Servant W SHENSTONE  LETTER XX W SHENSTONE Esq to Miss CARTER  Dear Miss CARTER  PERHAPS you may remember to have seen an odd Kind of Fellow when you were at  Cheltenham  who threatened you with a Let∣ter and who is now endeavouring to be as  bad  as his Word however he hopes for some lit∣tle  Partiality on his Behalf having delayed the Execution of his Menaces for a consider∣able Time and even now promising to say as few Things in your Favour as the real Sen∣timents of his Heart will admit of  But Peace to BuffooneryAfter I part∣ed from you Mr MN with great Simplicity endeavoured to keep up my Spirits by speak∣ing in Praise of the Family we had left as though that was not the ready Method to aggravate the Sense of one's Loss and yet to aggravate it was utterly impossible in the Opi∣nion of a Person already so sensible of it But he mentioned one Article which was more suc∣cessful and that was a Proposal to accom∣pany me to  Stoke  and to let me know when it suited his Convenience  When I came to  Cheltenham  I was not un∣mindful of that solemn Vow that I had made not to survive your Family there a single Hour but I found it near five o'Clock and my Con∣science said that as I had made it so late by my Attendance upon you though I did stay another Night I hoped I might be excused  I have been since leaving this Town at Mr BROWN's who lives upon the Borders of  Wales  Poor Man He has been the most obliging Person in the World to the most stu∣pid of Companions 'Tis hardly possible to determine which was greater the Zeal with which he shewed me his Fossils Plants Poe∣try  c  or the stupid Inattention with which I observed them He commends you and Mrs AUBREY highly so indeed do all I know or I would soon forget that I had ever seen their Faces He had found out a Method at last of seducing me to talk by frequent Men∣tion of your Merits and it was a good While before I discovered his Artifice and even when I had discovered it I was ill able to elude the Force of it  I am now just returned Home which is my Apology for not writing to you about  Chel∣tenham  as I promised I really scarce recollect any Circumstance belonging to it except that you and Mrs AUBREY were there the most fa∣vourable agreeable and praiseworthy  What does Mr M boast of the glorious Absurdity he committed at parting in mis∣taking my Horse for his When I see him next I will produce a Hundred I have been lately guilty of to no one of which his is able to compare His you know commenced in the very Moment of parting and consequent∣ly was little wonderful in Comparison of those I have since committed besides his Horse had a Spot or two of Brown on him and was therefore easily mistaken at such a Time for one that was Sorrel all over  After all you are a very wicked Ladyyou defrauded me of the Croslet you promised me putting me off with a single Bead but it was yours and that's enough The most trivial Donation from a Person we esteem has a large Value I acknowledge to have a great  Penchant  for what the Vulgar call  KeepSakes  The  French  are notably practised in these little Elegancies we are not so much so as I think a polished People ought to be  I am  dear Miss CARTER  Your most sincere Admirer and humble Servant W SHENSTONE  Don't expose the NonsenseVerses I gave you I entreat you  LETTER XXI S D Esq to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  I WAS some Time since at Mr WHISTLER's Chamber when he received a Letter from you the Sight of which revived in my Mind the pleasing Correspondence you once favour∣ed me with the Loss of which I much re∣gretDo you never think of returning to  Oxford  Have you left nothing there that may give us Leave once more to expect you I won't be so poetically complaisant as to say every Thing appears grieved at your Ab∣sence but I assure you Sir there are some that seem sincerely to lament it I can't com∣pare those little People that have sometimes  censured you to any Thing but Ants who are generally most troublesome in the finest Season I can't hope that even a short Stay at  C  could be made agreeable but Novel∣ty is sometimes pleasing descend then and see the new Acquaintance I have made which is like to prove a very lasting one may yours be no less soMr GRAVES is in  Gloucestershire  and Mr WHISTLER God knows where and you unkindly conceal from me the Place of your Residence I shall direct this wandering Epis∣tle as usual but imagine if it is so fortunate as to find you it will be in your Hermitage where I presume you are before this retired Were I Mr WHISTLER with what Pleasure should I leave the World and all its Vanities for Mr SHENSTONE and a CellThough I must own your Intention of making Mr LN im∣mortal by a Dedication and singing the Praises and Virtues of the Court seem to cherish gayer Thoughts than suit that peaceful Station Whether Hermit or Courtier be assured that whatever conduces to your Happiness is sin∣cerely wished by me  S D  C  January    LETTER XXII S D Esq to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  I CAN omit no Opportunity of shewing my Desire of continuing a Correspondence that has always given me so much Pleasure I wrote you a Letter some Time ago and should have used so little Ceremony as to have troubled you with another had I known in what Part of the World you was If you know any Thing of Mr G I should be glad to hear something of him I am informed that he is a Curate in some Village very remoteIt is a great Pity so much Merit should be no better rewarded We have been returned from  London  about three Weeks if I had known you were in Town I should have left it with much more Reluctance If you come into  Oxfordshire  this Summer I hope you will fa∣vour me with a Visit at  C  which will be a very great Pleasure to us all  You cannot imagine how happy you have made me in giving me Hopes of enjoying a Sight of your Poems from which I am sure of reaping a Pleasure which can admit of no Addition but by receiving them from your own Hands I am glad to hear that Mr G is settled so much to his Satisfaction if he is at  All Souls  I hope I shall see him be∣fore he leaves  Oxford  I have lately lost a very agreeable Relation and sincere Friend Perhaps you have heard Mr WHISTLER mention Miss B she died at  C  about three Months since after a short Illness of two Days which added so much to the melancholy Situation here that we were obliged to fly to Town for Amuse∣ments I came down ten Days since and shall return again tomorrow for about a Week longer May I hope dear Sir to find a Let∣ter here from you I am sure the reading of it will give me more real Pleasure than any Company or Diversion I can propose to find in  London  I am sorry to send you any News that will give you Concern but can't help  telling you that I hear poor Mr R G is dangerously ill of a Fever in Town Mr WHISTLER has left  Oxford  on Account of the SmallPox which is very much there and at present in  Pembroke  College  Notwithstanding this unseasonable Weather I must beg leave to put you in Mind of your Promise and enquire when it is you design us the Pleasure of your Company in  Oxford∣shire  where you will meet with a great many who will rejoice much to see you and none more than your  affectionate Friend and humble Servant S D  LETTER XXIII A B Esq to W SHENSTONE Esq  FOR the Soul's Food strengthened by the more substantial bodily Food I have for these nine Days past imbibed at your Villa the  Leasowes  I am much obliged to my dear Mr SHENSTONE Time will not however at present allow me to bestow more of my Elo∣quence on you for it you must therefore be satisfied with  "the Altar of Gratitude"  I have it in my Head hereafter to erect to your Ho∣nour  We are invited to stay at  Hagley  on  Monday  nextDinner at two o'ClockMay I expect the Pleasure of meeting you there If you have had a Card let me know  per  Bearer that I may not as I do now groan with Apprehen∣sions of the Day His most excellent of Ex∣cellencies the Governor and Mistress HESTER stay till the latter End of  September  so you  will certainly be honoured with them at the  Leasowes  My best and I think I may say my only dear Lord Lord D was here on  Friday  last with Intent to dine and spend the Day but as I was from Home went to  Hagley  and dined with the Lord LYTTELTON at the wor∣thy Admiral SMITH's  Oblige me with desiring DODSLEY to bid his Brother send me the  Annual Registers  bound as we agreed on this Morning and lettered when he sends me  The World c  Did I not know you above even the least Degree of Policy to your Friends I should suspect that you sent me Lady LUXBOROUGH's Letters to intimate to me  what  so dull a Cor∣respondent and insipid a Friend as myself  must expect  when you could bear Accusations of Negligence in answering such agreeable and sprightly Letters as those of her Ladyship and I could almost wish though the Perusal of them gave me the greatest Pleasure that you had not favoured me with a Sight of them  as I cannot help drawing  Omens  from them to myself the most dreadful if you did not then mean me  ill  in your obliging Compli∣ment of the Sight of them let me see or hear from you soon and tell me that though you have heretofore slighted a Lady's Favours you will not neglect a sincere Friend who admires and esteems you more than from what I think I have heard you say of her Ladyship  she could  But to wave this and leave you to your own Generosity I must thank you for yours of  March  th had I not depended on your Promise in it I should have again trou∣bled you e'er this but I must now tell you that I hope the Week after  Easter  Week for the Pleasure of your Company here and if con∣venient to take a Bed with us In the Ho∣lidays I apprehend we shall have Holiday Company which will be neither agreeable to  you  nor  us  as we shall not by such Interrup∣tion be able to pay the Attention we ought and are ever desirous of paying to so agreeable a Friend as Mr SHENSTONE  I like the Binding of your MILTON much but not to compliment dislike the Cuts as  much for I really think the Engraver has made our first Parents frightful Figures and the An∣gels and Devils almost equally lovelyCould you get mine bound as yours without the Cuts should be much obliged to you  I have retired from Company we have in the House to write this Scrawl this I hope will be an Excuse for it and convince you that I am resolved never to lose any Opportunity of assuring dear Mr SHENSTONE that I am  most sincerely his affectionate Friend A B  Have taken the Liberty of keeping Lady LUXBOROUGH's Letters some Time longer for Mrs B's Perusal who joins with all here in best Compliments to the  Leasowes  Wednesday  Evening  I should be glad if you could procure me half a Ream of Mr BASKERVILLE's best plain thin writing Paper I mean gilt but not bor∣dered  LETTER XXIV Mr J WHISTLER to W SHENSTONE Esq  Whitchurch  May    SIR  I MAKE no Doubt but you will be much surprised at the Receipt of this and like wise greatly concerned at the melancholy Oc∣casion of it As the Friendship subsisting between you and my Brother has been of so long standing I should be glad to communi∣cate its Contents to you more gently by some other Hand but for Want of a Friend in your Neighbourhood who has the Honour of your Acquaintance must do it myself in the least affecting Manner I am capable  The Beginning of this Month my Brother was taken ill of a sore Throat which con∣tinued for some Days without any apparent Symptoms of Danger indeed towards the last it was judged the Disorder was throwing it∣self off but to the great Surprise of every one a Mortification in his Inside was then be∣gun and came on so fast that it was out of the Power of Art to stop it of which he ex∣pired the th In  April  I had the Pleasure of his Company at  Bristol  for a few Days with my Father when amongst other agreeable Schemes for this Summer's Amusement he proposed to himself very great Pleasure from paying Mr SHENSTONE a VisitBut Man proposes and God disposes I have lost a very good kind Brother therefore hope those who were his Friends will continue their Friendship to me for his Sake which I shall always endeavour to deserve To give you this melancholy In∣formation is a painful Duty but it is what I am compelled to pay I can in some Mea∣sure conceive the many afflicting Recollections which will arise in your humane Mind on this Event Your Friendship and Correspondence  subsisted a considerable Time and with recipro∣cal Satisfaction He was unquestionably en∣dowed with natural good Sense well improved by Education and Reading of a lively plea∣sing Fancy and a benevolent Heart He was in short what your Pen might most exquisitely describe but what mine is unequal to  I beg your Acceptance of a Ring in Re∣membrance of him which shall be conveyed to  Birmingham  the first Opportunity My Fa∣ther desires his Service My Wife likewise joins with me in Compliments I am Sir  your obedient humble Servant J WHISTLER  The Editor can give no precise Account of the Dates of Mr WHISTLER's Letters This last however from his Brother must have been written in the Year that being the Year which deprived him of so valuable a Brother and Mr SHENSTONE of such an amiable Friend and Correspondent According to this Calculation these Letters of Mr WHISTLER should have come earlier in this Collection but they did not come Time enough into the Editor's Hands The same Reason must also be advanced for some other Letters being misplaced in Point of Time but as the several Subjects are independent of each other it is an Error the Editor presumes which the Reader will more readily excuse  LETTER XXV A B Esq to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Mr SHENSTONE  I Should with Pleasure have obeyed your kind Command and troubled you with a Let∣ter before this but that I waited to give you some Account of your Friends here I saw Mr DODSLEY soon after I came to Town he seems a very good Sort of Man and I like him much I believe he is quite satisfied with the Success of his Play for he is in good Health and Spirits  The Tragedy of  Cleone  produced at  CoventGarden  Theatre  Mr WREN I could not meet with till  Friday  last when I found him very busy with half a Dozen young Ana∣tomists for such I presume they were and Pen Ink and a Ream of Paper before them had I been free enough with your Friend I should certainly have enquired what weighty Discoveries they had been engaged in for they all looked prodigious wise when I entered the Room but I was soon left  TêteàTête  with  Mr W and then Subjects of still greater Importance such as Plays Operas  c c  were to be discussed Without a Compliment I think our Friend improves upon Acquain∣tance much but I wish him as you tell him less volatile to say the Truth when you brought him to  W  with K he was so very alert that I was not but that he came with you much prejudiced in his Favour however I find he has more Merit than those overlively young Gentlemen gene∣rally have and I doubt not but when you have pruned the Luxuriancy of his Sprightli∣ness he will make a very good Figure  I am sincerely sorry my Congratulations on your having a Place under Government were premature but I cannot say I wish you as your Friend GRIFFITH terms it  Polaury  though I know it could not have the Effect on you it so evidently has had on but what any one could think due to CIBBER's Merit Mr SHENSTONE ought to think beneath him  I have not the Book you enquired for in yours nor any one that I can recollect from  you The Letters you were so good as to send me are safe locked up in my Bureau and shall be returned when we meet I took the Liberty of keeping them as I had no Opportunity of sending to the  Leasowes  before I set out for  London  if you have any Com∣mands here I hope you will oblige me with them and when you are at Leisure let me hear from you but DODSLEY tells me you are reperusing your Elegies he hopes for the Press and I would not interrupt you from such Engagements for the World as you have too long deprived the Learned and Tasteful the Pleasure of admiring them  Adieu dear Mr SHENSTONE  believe me yours most sincerely A B  The Hurry of  London  to a Man who pur∣poses spending but seven Weeks in it will I hope plead excuse for this Scrawl  Sunday Jan    LETTER XXVI A B Esq to W SHENSTONE Esq  I Can't but think you wrong my dear SHEN∣STONE though placed as you seem to think now  Far from all Resort of Mirth  Save the Cricket on the Hearth  you who have in your Mind such an inex∣haustible Fund of Amusement refined Amuse∣ment in envying so inferior an Animal as your Friend A B whose chief Happiness even in  London ought  I shrewdly suspect to be that he can call you and one more  worthy  Man you know who I mean his Friends The Pleasures of  London  I think I may say the innocent ones lose much of their Power to please unless participated with those who have refined Sense enough to enjoy and partake those delicate Feelings with a Friendfew such are ever to be found here and without such where's the Society Dissipation my Friend is the ge∣neral  or chief Amusement of this Town to the Generality of People and though it abounds with Amusements and Pleasures truly rational yet by a too frequent if not cor∣rupted Use these very Pleasures become irra∣tional such they are to the Generality of my Acquaintance and though I hope I do not pre∣tend to be wiser than they yet I cannot feel a Pleasure in going with them to Entertain∣ments of the noblest Kind where I must not attend but join with them in endeavouring to draw off the Attention of others to my Com∣panion or self for this Reason then I gene∣rally go to a Play  c  by myself and by this very Means lose much of the Pleasure I should otherwise receive from it I wish  "with all my Heart"  as the true  Englishman  's Phrase is that you could with Convenience to your∣self come to Town but I will not pity you who can so well divert yourself in any Place because you cannot come Let Wretches un∣blessed with a Mind rich as yours with a Sen∣sibility capable of receiving Delight from every common Occurrence be sincerely pitied pitied without the ungenerous Contempt that you in∣timate is so generally its Attendant but be you  my Friend the Envy of all who are meanly capable of so low a Passion and the Admi∣ration of every honestlydistinguishing Heart Your Mind my Friend is rightly formed for true Happiness be yourself and be happybut I grow impertinently officious could you look into my Heart such Officiousness would from your Goodnature meet with the Pardon I think I might say it deserves for that I am so is that I can with the greatest Since∣rity subscribe myself  your faithful and affectionate Friend A B  Saturday  Night  Feb    Excuse this Scrawl and if a great deal of Nonsense excuse that too for I have not Time to peruse it the PostBell now ringing  I purpose leaving  London Monday  Se'ennight oblige me with a Line in Answer to this before I set out if you can conveniently  LETTER XXVII A B Esq to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Mr SHENSTONE  TO answer your kind Letter as I wish is not in my Power let it suffice then to remind you that where the Heart really feels most Silence is the only Eloquence she can use  Why will you not agree with me in the Want I complained of Had I not felt it I should not have troubled you with it What Answer can you make when I tell you that my choicest Friend Lord D from a Ten∣derness of Sentiment never frequents the Amuse∣ments you and I admire and think innocent ones Find me another Friend like him ca∣pable of delicately feeling and participating every rational Pleasure yourself excepted to be the Companion I wished for and I'll grant your Plea of  "Indecision"  till you can do that come over to my Side of the Question  As to Affairs in Town I will not utter a Syllable concerning them till I see you here only I must tell you that  London  daily walks nearer  MaryleBone  than you or I could have believed so corpulent a Lady able to do  The  Ramblers  and  World  I read this last Sum∣mer and was much entertained with both tho' I think the former greatly the Superior and had I not thought it Presumption in me to recommend any Author to you I perhaps might in worse Language have urged your reading them as you have so kindly mine  I have sent your Pencils  per  Bearer but must beg to keep  La Pompadour  some Time longer as I have not quite done with her nor indeed is it fit so great a Lady should travel but in a Carriage come and fetch her then in your Chaise or we shall be reckoned greater Boors by the polite Countrymen than we al∣ready areAdieu be Happiness ever yours  Your affectionate Friend A B  All here join in best Compliments to the  Leasowes  March    P S The underwritten Quotation from THOMSON struck Mr B so strongly as he passed by the  Leasowes  some Time ago that he hopes Mr SHENSTONE will excuse his trou∣bling him with it  As nearer to this Farm you made approach  He polish'd Nature with a finer Hand  Yet on her Beauties durst not Art encroach  'Tis Art's alone these Beauties to expand  In graceful Dance immingled o'er the Land  Pan Pales Flora  and  Pomona  play'd  An happy Place  LETTER XXVIII A B Esq to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Mr SHENSTONE  YOU make me very happy by the kind Turn you give to the unfashionable Re∣serve I told you in my last I labour under I am sincerely desirous of being dear to you and if the  "  eadem velle atque eadem nolle  "  is a good Omen of a lasting Friendship I have good Reasons to hope that the Names of W SHENSTONE and A B will ever be mu∣tually esteemed by each other for without meaning a Compliment but to my own Judg∣ment I really think to know what you like or dislike some  few  Persons excepted is suf∣ficient to make me do the same but I beg for the future when you mention the Valua∣bles  London  robs the Country of at this Sea∣son you will not immediately add that Lord P is just set out from  N  on his Way here  Apropos  You tell me you are busy in re∣gulating your Library will not you laugh at me if I draw a Comparison and tell you that I am engaged at present in a similar Affair Regulating the Friends I henceforward design admitting into my Heart's inmost Recess You I dare say even in  your  Library have admit∣ted some Rubbish you will now throw out how much then must I who from a very Child have been a Kind of Enthusiast in Friendship have to cleanse from my Esteem Indeed I find upon Examination I have been much out in my Collection and have ranked many  fuga∣cious Pamphlets  as JOHNSON calls them as First∣rate Authors but I shall make a total Rum∣mage and hope for the future my Taste will be more refined indeed I do not fear it for I have chosen your Worship sole Librarian of the Place and to say the Truth I find you so delicate a Gentleman that you have routed every other living Soul my own  nearest  Relations excepted nor can I find that you will admit any one else to enter the poor Cell you have the Charge of but Lord D well well you are quite right I shall have enough  to do to value you two as I ought you  two  shall be my Study and if I don't improve enough from reading you it will be my Fault for the Pamphlets I shall dip into them oc∣casionally at an idle Hour unless a female one demands my closer Application but I promise you I shall be very cautious in my Choice of her  I am much obliged to you for offering to introduce me to the Acquaintance of Dr G I should eagerly lay hold of the Favour but that I purpose leaving  London  on  Monday  the th of this Month and shall not have Time to pay him the Attention I owe every Friend of Mr SHENSTONE's  I have from your Recommendation read the History of  La Pompadour  and like it very well it seems authentic though not much to the Honour of the  Dame  or  Louis le Grand  I shall expect two Letters from your Wor∣ship in answer to my last Nonsense and  this  and pray good Sir do be not so very concise Mr SHENSTONE believe me is worse Com∣pany  than any Man when  he  is silent most People know how agreeable every Word he says is and when he is pleased to be mute cannot but be uneasy According to this you'll say your Friend wishes you to kill yourself with talking not sobut he refers the Whole to your better Judgment who knows best when your modest Humility does not too much in∣terfere how to do every Thing with the best Grace  If you have by you your  Ode on Autumn  or  Damon's Bower  and care to trust them by the Bearer you will do me a great Favour in sending them If you can venture out of your agreeable  Shell  at the  Leasowes  and provided you are preparing your Elegies for the Press will bring them with you not letting the Fa∣vour you do us delay the Pleasure you will give the polite World in publishing them we shall think ourselves happy in accommodating you with a warm Room Pen Ink and Paper in this Part of the World  I return the Duchess of SOMERSET's Letters which I have perused with great Pleasure par∣ticularly  those which give the Honour due to my Friend Mr SHENSTONE  You have the joint good Wishes of our present contracted FireSide  Believe me  dear Sir  Your very affectionate A B  LETTER XXIX A B Esq to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  THE Compliment you make me of desi∣ring me to correct abridge  c c  the Sheets you have so obligingly sent me puts me so much in Mind of MOLIERE's reading his Plays to his old Woman before he produced them  to the Stage that I can hardly persuade my∣self though I am but just turned twentyseven and have a good Pair of Mr DEHENNIC's fa∣vourite  Lambskin  Breeches on that I am not of the other Sex and at least seventy as such I have presumed to give you my Opinion freely which you will find first interspersed on little Bits of Paper among your ProofSheets and I desire you will not esteem it in any other Light I am vain enough of the Friendship you have distinguished me with and I desire you will not let your kind Partiality make me more unworthy of it than I am by adding to my Vanity As a Poet I admire and as a Friend I love you but you must not ap∣ply to me for what I am not able with any Credit to myself to oblige you in I am glad you sent DODSLEY's fourth Volume as I parted with my Set of his Poems this Sum∣mer to a Friend who begged them of me Am much obliged to you for the Print of your Grove and though I think it makes not near the Figure on Paper so lovely a Scene would be imagined to do shall value it much  I ought to make many Apologies for keep∣ing the Books you were so kind as to lend me so long but in such Estimation do I hold every Thing that comes from the  Lea∣sowes  that a common Attention to it will not satisfy me and I cannot readily part with it in haste this then must excuse me to you and I flatter myself it will as I know you are my Friend  Adieu dear Mr SHENSTONE The sooner you favour us with your Company the more you will oblige us all  Your very faithful and affectionate A B  LETTER XXX Mr DODSLEY to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dec    Dear Mr SHENSTONE  I Am very sorry you have been so much in∣disposed since I left you Bleeding Vo∣miting Purging the Doctor and the Disease are too many Enemies for a Man to strug∣gle with at once and I heartily wish you Joy of your Victory against such apparent Odds I am sure I have very little Reason to sup∣pose you make Sickness a Plea for Laziness since you have taken infinitely more Pains on my Account than you seem disposed to take on your own Pray think of this and learn to love yourself as well as you do your Friends pay as much Regard to your own Fame as you do to theirs and the World will be obliged to you  I received a Letter from Mr EAVES he tells me the Fables are finished and that they  will come up to Town this Week I shall be very glad of it for I find even then that I shall not be able to publish before  February  You tell me the Portrait is  only  delayed till you can see ALCOCKCan it be delayed to a more uncertain Time You do not imagine how many Friends are longing to see it and here the Winter is passing away and I am losing the Pleasure of obliging  your  Friends as well as my  own  I hope I shall see Mr H when he comes to Town I expect Mr D soon after NewYear's DayWould to God you would come with him Now is  your  Time to make Interest for Preferment as Me∣rit seems at present the best Recommendation to Favour Come and give the Ministry an Opportunity of doing themselves Credit With the Compliments of the Season and my best Wishes in all Seasons I conclude and am  Dear Sir  ever affectionately yours R DODSLEY  LETTER XXXI Mr DODSLEY to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Mr SHENSTONE  HOPING by this Time you are in a fair Way of Recovery I venture to write to you Indeed I was extremely alarmed by the Account Dr ASH gave me of you in his first Letter and also by a Line from Miss H but by a second Letter from the Doctor and by a Note afterwards from Mr BASKERVILLE I received some Hopes of your Recovery tho' not enough to encourage me to write to your∣self for fear of the worst I have been ex∣tremely uneasy indeed and still continue so Pray let MOLLY or somebody give me a Line to satisfy me how you are Don't offer to write yourself if it be the least uneasy to you I will be satisfied with hearing from any Hand that you are better and when you are able to write yourself I shall be happy Lord S is come to Town and in a Day or two I pur∣pose to wait on him I have not yet seen  Sir H E I think I had better see Lord S first God preserve you and send you a speedy Recovery  I am ever most affectionately yours R DODSLEY  Feb    LETTER XXXII Mr DODSLEY to W SHENSTONE Esq  Dear Sir  I AM sorry I hurried my Essay out of your Hands before you had done with it but if I think of publishing my Fables next  Oc∣tober  or  November  it is high Time I should put both to Press now that the Printer may have good Weather to print in and that the Work may have Time to dry after it is finish∣ed before the Books are bound But as it  happens I cannot begin till the latter End of this Month as the Printer is not at Leisure however I have put my Plates in Hand and they are going on as fast as possible I never received Mr ALCOCK's Drawings so I have got two others executed of somewhat a dif∣ferent Design I will not put the Essay in Hand till the last which may perhaps be about  July  as I shall be very desirous of its having the Advantage of your Corrections But am I not to hope for a new Fable or two from you You see how I dwindle in my Expectations but pray don't let me be  quite  disappointed I propose if possible to finish the Printing of my Fables before I set out on my northern Expedition Mr M and his Lady will be at  Nottingham  about the latter End of  August  they have wished I would meet them there and in their Return to Town bring them round by the  Leasowes  Mr BURKE  Author of  the Sublime and Beautiful  has also a strong Inclination to meet us there so that possibly we may be happy enough to spend a Day with you another must be spent at Lord LYTTELTON's as they are both ac∣quainted  with him and a third at  Birmingham  I shall hate the Name of D as long as I live he is crooked in all his Ways but the Devil will set strait with him one Day or other I have not seen a Page of Mr PERCY's Novel and therefore cannot at all explain it to you but I suppose he makes no Secret of it I wish Mr GRAVES would finish hisAnd will you really consent to an Exchange of Pictures Upon my Word you make but a sorry Bar∣gain for yourself however to give you as little Reason as may be to regret your Com∣pliance I will sit to one of our best Artists and to supply the Want of Merit in the Ori∣ginal will endeavour to give as much as I can to the Copy If you have any Thing to suggest on this Subject as you seem to hint you will be so good as to let me have a Line because as soon as I am able to get abroad which I hope will be in a few Days I in∣tend to consult with REYNOLDS  The present Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS  about it Ay I forgot to tell you that I have been con∣fined this Month with the Gout every Man has his DN  that  is mine I am glad your  Likeness is a strong one and I think the Attitude you are drawn in is a good one pray is that the Picture you intend for me The Writer of  Tristram Shandy  is a Mr STERNE one of the Prebendaries of  York  As to Mr BASKERVILLE's  Bible  he will easily be dissuaded from the marginal Ornaments but the TitlePage is a Favourite and for my Part I have not much Objection to it Mr WEBB's Book on  Painting and Painters  is reckoned ingenious and if you like the Subject will be worth your Perusal  Antient and Modern Rome  I also think a good Poem My Compliments to Mr HYLTON and all Friends  I am ever  Dear Sir  most faithfully yours R DODSLEY  LETTER XXXIII Mr DODSLEY to W SHENSTONE Esq  June    Dear Mr SHENSTONE  I WAS yesterday searching for Figures for your two NichesI have found three Pair the Figures good that will do as to Size  viz  the ANTINOUS I mentioned and the APOLLO with his Arm over his Head a FLORA and a CERES and a HOMER and VIRGIL The ANTINOUS and APOLLO are two Feet high FLORA and CERES twentythree Inches and HOMER and VIRGIL twentyone These last are each of them leaning upon a Pedestal on one of which in  Basso Relievo  is  Troy  in Flames on the other ROMULUS and REMUS sucking a Wolf These are both pretty Fi∣gures and don't you think them better Or∣naments for a Library and more suitable Com∣panions for SAPPHO than either of the others A Line by the Return of the Post will just give me Time to get which of them you choose  finished and sent to you before I set off for  Nottingham  for I find I must go thither be∣fore I come to the  Leasowes  but I shall stay only a few Days I had a Letter from my Friend Mr M by the last Post who is at  Nottingham  and I find him wavering in his Resolutions about coming by the  Leasowes  I am glad you like my Design for the Picture and how agreeably you have contrived to flat∣ter me about it But say what you will I shall have a Picture of Mr SHENSTONE you will have one only of DODSLEY and a SHEN∣STONE by ALCOCK will certainly be more valuable than a DODSLEY even by REYNOLDS I read to him that Part of your Letter which related to him he desires his Compliments and would be glad if you came to Town that you sate to him I hope I shall be able to send the Picture to you before I set out on my Journey but it is not yet finished  I am affectionately yours R DODSLEY  LETTER XXXIV Mr DODSLEY to W SHENSTONE Esq  June    Dear Mr SHENSTONE  HOW much am I obliged to you for the Pains you have taken in translating LA MOTTE's Discourse on Fable and though I fancy you will find upon comparing the two that I have made a good Deal of Use of it I shall be very glad to have more of it in∣terwoven if you shall think I have not suffi∣ciently extracted the Essence of it I must must own my Pride or call it my Folly if you please would rather choose to prefix some∣what of my own on that Subject than servilely adopt the Thoughts of a  Frenchman  though I acknowledge them to be very ingenious Be∣sides I have had the Hardiness to differ with him in some Respects which makes it still more improper to take his whole Discourse Proceed therefore if you please in correcting my Essay and interweave with it as much  more of LA MOTTE as you may think pro∣per If you defer this till I come down which I wish you would not pray in the mean Time think of half a Dozen new Fables that we may not have too much to embarrass us when together My Face is quite finished and I believe very like I fancy I shall send it together with the Figures on  Monday  Se'en∣night but I shall not be able to set out myself till  Monday  Fortnight and staying a Week or ten Days at  Nottingham  and  Mansfield  will detain me from the  Leasowes  till the latter End of next Month If the Picture should be turned yellowish by being packed up Mr REYNOLDS advises that it be set in the Sun for two Hours which will quite recover it Why did you leave the Choice of your two Figures to me How could you put me un∣der such a Difficulty If I have done wrong you will suffer for it and say what you will I have not sufficient Firmness of Taste to di∣rect me right besides I do not exactly re∣member the Niches it is therefore your Fault to trust me and if I have erred your Duty to forgive me I have ordered the HOMER and VIRGIL to be bronzed they are very pretty  Figures and if you have as you say no other Objection to them but the Want of two or three Inches more of Height I hope some Means may be found to obviate so small a Deficiency I should not however have ven∣tured to send them but that you seemed at last to acquiesce in their being sent I think however I have been somewhat happy in my Urns and I am not without Hopes that you will approve the whole Cargo The FolioVIRGIL will come in the same Package I feel myself very happy in the Thoughts of seeing you soon and will hasten the Day as much as is in my Power I hope Mr BAS∣KERVILLE will be quite ready for me I shall send him the Paper in a Fortnight I am  faithfully yours R DODSLEY  LETTER XXXV Mr DODSLEY to W SHENSTONE Esq  June    Dear Sir  YOUR Picture really affords me many plea∣sing Reflections and I have ordered the Frame to be full gilt whilst I am out of Town that it may not give you any unplea∣sing ones I am going to  Derby  and  Not∣tingham  for three Weeks or a Month I can't stay longer as I must attend to the Press having put my Fables in Hand for a new Edition I have last  Monday  sent you PERCY's Novel I sent it unbound as we had not Time to bind it it will not be published till the Beginning of next Winter I have sent you the  Fables  bound in  Morocco  and the com∣mon Edition in Boards for your future Cor∣rections but I would not have you begin till you see the next Edition as I hope you will find it altered somewhat for the better I will send you one of them as soon as it is printed  You will find likewise in the Parcel SOAME JENNYNS's Works and a Pamphlet or two also the Fables with your Drawings in them many of which I like extremely that at the Head of the second I approve the least but those that are placed in the Life I think should be transferred to the Head and TailPieces of the Fablesbut there will be Time enough to talk of this hereafter As to Ita∣lics I believe I shall steer a middle Course and make Use only of a few I send you a List of some Statues about the same Size with that Pair you have  DEMOSTHENES and CICERO  LOCKE and NEWTON  CHAUCER and SPENCER  SHAKESPEARE and MILTON  When you have fixed upon which Pair you will have you will let me know whether you will have them white or bronzed and what Kind of a Bronze  I really don't know how to appease Mr W I told him I was very sorry I had pretended to meddle with his Ode and begged  his Pardon He is still unappeased writes me another angry Letter and desires me to give him my Reasons for every Alteration this it is impossible for me to do as I have forgot how it originally was and I really think it of very little Consequence as no Name ap∣pears to it  Mr STUART is just now with me and de∣sires his Compliments He thinks of seeing your Place the latter End of the Summer and believes the AttorneyGeneral Mr PRATT will be with him I have just been struck with the bad News that Mr has lost his Wife You will perceive I write in a Hurry Mr STUART sits by me  I am ever affectionately yours R DODSLEY  LETTER XXXVI W SHENSTONE Esq to Mr HULL at  Birmingham  I DESIRE my Compliments to Mr HULL and Miss MORRISON with many Thanks for the Pleasure I received from last Night's Play  A hasty and imperfect Compilation of some Scenes on the Subject of ROSAMOND which however laid the GroundWork of the present Tragedy acted at  CoventGarden  Theatre The Public may easily discern how fully the Author has availed himself of the kind and judicious Hints contained in the Letter before us  It was indeed acted with great Spirit and as far as I could judge afforded the Au∣dience no small Satisfactionnot perhaps equal to what they derived from the Appearance of the Dun Cow  c  Introduced in a Pantomime performed the same Even∣ing  for that is hardly to be expected  I think the Play has now so much  good  in it that it may be worth Mr HULL's while  to give it a few more finishing Touches Sup∣pose a Confessor or Friar either out of Ha∣tred to the Queen view to his own Advance∣ment or any  selfish  Motive which he might explain in a short Soliloquy persuaded ROSA∣MOND to aspire to the Throne and to urge the King to a Divorce that ROSAMOND should avow her Abhorrence of such Injustice to the Queen intimating that her Love had no other Object than the King's Person and heroic Vir∣tues that this Refusal should affront the Friar who in Revenge should inform the Queen that ROSAMOND actually  had  those very Intentions with which he had been endeavouring to in∣spire her  c  This would throw more Plot into the Play which it wants would more sufficiently account for the Queen's sudden Change from a mild Character to a revenge∣ful one and as Mr HULL thinks the Play too short would add two new Scenes Some further Improvements I would recommend in the Close and a few more Places but Mr HULL's further  Attention  to the Play will render it need∣less to point them out to him  If you should ever complete this Undertak∣ing to your Liking and produce the Piece  on a  London  Stage I would recommend that you should by all Means give it a double Title in the printed Bills namely HENRY  the Second or the Fall of  ROSAMOND  I should esteem it as a Favour if Mr HULL would send me down a Copy of the Prologue and Epilogue as they were spoken which I will not communicate without his Permission Either his or Miss MORRISON's Muse seems to favour them at a Minute's Warning  Mr HODGETTS with whom I am at pre∣sent would be glad that Mr HULL would dine here about two and so should I if it be no way inconvenient to him  I had almost forgot to thank you for the Stanzas you left at the  Leasowes  when I was on a Visit to  Hagley  They are well con∣structed for the Occasion and the Idea seems to arise from humane Sensibility warmed with honest Indignation  I am very affectionately yours W SHENSTONE  SnowHill Birmingham  Aug    STANZAS Alluded to in the foregoing Letter  Written underneath the

Mr HULL  IF I recollect aright both you and NED ALCOCK were here this last Autumn on the Evening when my FishPonds had been robbed and the Fish destroyed You were an EyeWitness of the Circumstances there∣fore cannot but retain them in your Memo∣ry I find I have been arraigned of  Lenity  by several conscientiouslyupright Neighbours  "  I have screened a Robber from Justice  ""  I have given Encouragement to future Thefts  "  c  Such are the Aspersions wherewith I have  been loaded I make a material Distinction between a  Robber  and a  Pilferer  nor can I assign the former Appellation to a poor Wretch who in his Hunger has taken two or three  Fishes  or as many  Loaves  It is true I would rather have given more than the Value of them to have prevented my  finny Friends  being di∣sturbed in or taken away from their elemen∣tal Habitation it is also as true that in my first Warmth on the Report that the Fellow had bruised the poor Creatures to Death against the Stumps and Roots of Trees I could not only have delivered him over to Justice but have been almost induced to become myself his Punisher but when that Warmth submitted to cool Reflection  I felt it impossible  to resist his Argument of having a Wife with five Children at Home and not a Doit to procure them a Meal I verily believe too he spoke the Truth Poverty and Affliction seemed to work and plead within him and his Words were the Words of Nature  I cannot be so severe against these petty Misdemeanours as many are nor can I though I revere the Call of Justice be a rigorous  Supporter of its Claims except in atrocious Cases Beside what had it availed me to have consigned the Offender to the Power of a Ma∣gistrate Rather say what Pain and Inconve∣nience should I not have entailed on myself I should have had the Trouble of attending the Examination have had the Fellow impri∣soned many Days and the additional Mortifi∣cation of travelling perhaps to  Warwick  or  Worcester  in order to convict him And after all no Restitution is made for my Loss though it were ten Times more valuable than a whole  Draught of Fishes  There is surely something deficient in our Laws concerning the  Meum Tuum  the Person robbed not only abides the Loss without Amends but is even put to Expence as well as Inconvenience to get the Robber punished  Then again the Wife and five ChildrenThe poor Fellow subsists chief Part of the Year only by carrying NewsPapers round the Country Had He been shut up what was to have supported the ragged Family meanwhile I am beside inclined to think that half a Crown and a little wholesome Admonition  that is if he be not a practised and stubborn Offender might go as far towards amending his Morals as an Acquaintance with the In∣side of a Prison and the Conversation of such Associates as he might find there  I have suffered myself sometimes to doubt the Excellence of our Laws relative to Life and Death notwithstanding I know it has been asserted by many People that they are wiser than those of any other Nation What then Is the Man who takes a few Guineas from you on the Highway on a Level with him who commits a deliberate Murder And is there no Punishment to be found more ade∣quate to the first Transgression than taking away the Life Surely one Example made by a visible Brand a Mark of Disgrace which could never be washed away would more avail towards the Prevention of future Crimes than half the Executions in the Kingdom which have now from two great Frequency lost the chief Part of their Purpose and Terror The Punishment which was inflicted by a Regent in some Part of the East I think the Circum∣stance is related in the  Arabian Nights Enter∣tainments  on a Judge who had been induced by Gold to give an unjust Decision is admi∣rable The Brand placed on his Habitation in legible Characters  "  Here lives a corrupt Judge  "  was in the highest Degree conso∣nant to Justice inasmuch as it made the Crime its own Punishment  I have been led into these Reflections by finding how severely I have been arraigned only for having been  an innocent Defrauder of the Law  so have troubled you with them but here I come to a Conclusion You are at Liberty to draw what Inferences you please from or make what Objections you like to my Opinion  I am now to thank you for the Anecdotes you have given me as well as for the

XXXVIII W SHENSTONE Esq to Mr HULL  The  Leasowes  Nov    Dear Mr HULL  I ESTEEM myself beholden to you for having made me acquainted with the Rea∣lity of the two Writers Dr LANCASTER and HENRY I have admired them both in their Pages but knew only their Names In fact when I first read the  Essay on Delicacy  I ima∣gined the Name of LANCASTER to be ficti∣tious and that the Work might be the Pro∣duction of the Author of  Sir Thomas FitzOshorne's Letters  There is great Spirit fine Sentiment and true Elegance of Style through∣out and my Friend DODSLEY's preserving it in his  Fugitive Pieces  is truly meritorious It well deserves to be rescued from Oblivion But what a Pity that your Uncle does not make a more frequent Use of his Pen the World does not abound too much in such Writers  How much likewise is it to be lamented that a Man of such Abilities should lie concealed in an obscure Part of  Essex  He should have remained in the Worldthat is I mean for the Sake of the World to his own Happi∣ness probably Retirement was most condu∣cive It is most certain that no Men are fit for Solitude but those who find the Source of Amusement and Employment in themselves Fancy Reflection and a Love of Reading are indispensably necessary for such a Situation It is downright Lunacy for a Man who has pas∣sed his Life in a ComptingHouse or a Shop who possesses possibly but a moderate Share of natural Understanding that Understanding too not cultivated by Education and who has ne∣ver known what it is was to look into a BookIt is I repeat downright Lunacy for such a Man to think of  retiring  He knows not the Fatigue he is going to encounter he will want Employment for his Hours most pro∣bably may shorten his Existence and while he retains it it will be one continued State of Apathy if not Disorder  HENRY you say is a Mr GRIFFITH of the County of  Kilkenny  in  Ireland  A Friend brought me over the Letters of HENRY and FRANCES when they were first published in  Dublin  they are most admirably clever and comprehensive I have enjoyed and reenjoyed them and while I have admired the Wri∣tings have loved the Writers In the private Character you have given me of this amiable  Pair  I feel as if I were acquainted with them Before the Information received from you I have sometimes suffered myself to think and even communicated to an intimate Friend or two that there was a Similitude of Disposition between HENRY and myself but when I look on your Description of him I entertain much Doubt In the active Parts of his Philosophy his Perseverance and Re∣solution I fear I am far behind him He is a Man qualified for any State or Situation Business or Amusement Solitude or a CrowdAnd you have spent Months with him at  Kilkenny  I give you Joy of such an Hap∣piness  Again I thank you for the Enclosures you are ever and anon sending and am  Dear Mr HULL  yours very affectionately W SHENSTONE  LETTER XXXIX W SHENSTONE Esq to Mr HULL at  CoventGarden  Theatre  SIR  I AM greatly obliged both to you and Miss MORRISON for the Ballads you were so good as to inclose to me The Speed you have used in sending them testifies the Rea∣lity of that Delight you seemed to express at the  Leasowes  when I first communicated my Friend Dr PERCY's Design I sent them di∣rectly  to him he has begun to print off his venerable Collection  Antient Poetry  now published in three Volumes the universal Estimation and Encouragement of which Work sufficiently testifies its Excellence  with an Eye to the Publication of it sometime next Winter One of your Ballads is truly beautily and extreme∣ly proper for his Purpose It has that  Nai∣veté  which is so very essential in Ballads of all Kind and which requires no more than that  sublime  or  elegant  or  tender  Sentiments be expressed in a simple and unaffected Manner  Sentimental  Language would be no ill Term for it or perhaps the Essay before DODSLEY's  Fables  does not improperly stile it the  Voice  of Sentiment in Opposition to the  Language  of Reflection  As to the  other  Miss M well di∣stinguishes that the Merit of it is almost wholly confined to the Sentiment at last This is both  natural  and  tender  and would  she  take the Pains to newwrite the  whole  on this Ac∣count for even this Sentiment is not  expressed  so very simply as one could wish it I dare say it is in her Power to render it very plea∣sing  I know not how far I am  singular  but as I love to avail myself of different Words to bundle up Ideas in different Parcels it is become habitual to me to call  that  a  Ballad  which describes or implies some  Action  on the other Hand I term that a  Song  which contains only an Expression of  Sentiment  Ac∣cording to this Account I believe one of your Pieces would appear a  Ballad  and the other a  Song  The  PlayHouse  Coronations answer the Pur∣pose of all those who chuse to compound the Matter betwixt  Indolence  and  Curiosity  Mr GARRICK has given a very genteel Turn to this Taste among the Citizens in his Epilogue to the new Play  Epilogue to the Tragedy of  Hecuba  produced that Year at  DruryLane  Theatre  I have not  yet  seen this Performance and should be glad if you would give me some Account of its Appearance on the Stage Why does not  your  Dr LANCAS∣TER  The Editor's Uncle  compleat his  Essay upon Delicacy  I read it since I wrote last in DODSLEY's  Fugitive  Pieces  and think it mighty well deserves the Labour necessary to its Continuation  'Tis true that Specimens of Wit or Hu∣mour have been dispensed this Winter but spa∣ringly from the Press and even there in  po∣litical  Pamphlets where I am least inclined to seek them But we must swim with the Tide if we would collect the Shells and Co∣rals that it leaves behind accordingly I have read two or three of these Pamphlets which have answered my Expectations Should any other appear that strikes you be so good as to enclose it to me in a Frank As to  La∣vinia  or other dramatic Schemes I must de∣fer them till I see you again at the  Leasowes  which whenever it happens will afford me Pleasure being very faithfully and affectio∣nately  your most obedient Servant W SHENSTONE

Chepstow  some Time ago but these are Du∣ties which I do not always perform so soon as I oughtyou know I don'tNeither will I waste my Time and Paper in apologizing for a Failing which you are so ready to forgive  convinced that I am not less grateful on that Account  I have great Joy in reading these little pleasurable Travels in a private Letter related as yours are without Formality describing with Ease and Simplicity every little Occur∣rence as it falls out I can journey with you in Imagination and partake every trivial Dif∣ficulty and every Delight  You  are fond of these little  Parties of Pleasure  as they are called and in you it is by no Means reprovable but in general they are very dangerous to young Folks  You  have Means and Time at your own Disposal your Party is small and select both in Point of Reputation and Un∣derstanding you likewise turn your Excur∣sion to some Advantage you make Observa∣tions on all you see form nice Distinctions between different Places Points and Charac∣ters and draw just Conclusions from themBut as I said before these Parties too often are hazardous the Mind once indulged in them is apt to covet them too often they are sometimes the Means of drawing a Female into improper Company they encroach on  Means and Time neither of which probably can with Propriety be bestowed they have their Source in Dissipation are continually at∣tended with Hazard and too often end in the Worst of Mischiefs In short I would wish all young Folks who have neither Leisure nor Money at Command to shut their Ears against the very Name of  a Party of Pleasure  More than once in my Life I have been so∣licited by Friends to visit foreign Climes I had an Invitation of this Kind lately but it is now too late at least I think soBesides why should a Man go so far for Objects of Cu∣riosity who has seen too little of his own Coun∣try Many Parts of  England Wales  and  Scot∣land  equally I should think deserve our Ad∣miration and we need not risque Winds and Waves to which I feel  some  Objection Num∣bers of our travelling Gentry peregrinate too early in Life before the Mind is sufficiently formed to make proper Observations on what they see and hear  A Friend once related an Anecdote which is apposite to my Subject A very young  Man of good natural Understanding and Heir to an affluent Fortune would needs be one of these inconsiderate Travellers In the Course of his Adventures he fell into Company in  Naples  with some welltravelled and wellin∣formed Foreigners They were conversing on what they had seen in  England  and some little Difference in Opinion arising about the Ar∣chitecture of  Windsor  Castle they naturally re∣ferred themselves to the young  Englishman  for Decision With much Confusion and Hesita∣tion he was compelled to confess he had ne∣ver seen the Building in Question The Com∣pany with true foreign Politeness only testi∣fied their Admiration in a silent Smilebut the Reflection instantly struck and pained the young Gentleman The Result was that he returned for  England  within two Days rational∣ly determined to instruct himself in the Know∣ledge of his own Country before he pryed in∣to those afar off His Reflection and Deter∣mination did equal Credit to his Understanding  Our Friend HULL has as usual been amu∣sing us with as good a Drama as our neigh∣bouring Town can give Encouragement to  but says he returns no more I know many who will be sorry on this Account He has not departed however without having excited Curiosity in a very peculiar Way on a small Plan indeed but to a very commenda∣ble Purpose He enticed with him his two principal Actresses Miss MORRISON and Miss IBBOT both possessed of great Merit in their Profession some few of his Band two Voices and gave an Evening's Entertainment of  Sing∣ing  and  Reading  at the little Town of  Stour∣bridge  some few Miles off the Profits de∣voted to the Assistance of a Tradesman who had suffered under repeated Misfortunes The Success I hear more than answered his Ex∣pectations the little AssemblyRoom was croud∣ed and with much good Company A slight Cold made me fearful of being out late but the Particulars were given me by a neigh∣bouring Clergyman who was present The Pieces selected for Reading were wellchosen I do not remember the whole Number but I recollect that  Miss  CARTER  's Ode to Wisdom  PRIOR  's Henry and Emma  and GRAY's  Elegy in a Country ChurchYard  were amongst them The latter gave particular Satisfaction my  Friend told me to the Gentlemen of the Pul∣pit of whom he counted seven The whole was received with great Approbation You are to observe that HULL and his Party so far from proposing any Emolument to them∣selves declined even to be reimbursed the Ex∣pences they were at in going and the Master of the AssemblyRoom  gave  the Use of it From this confined Instance of such a Scheme I am apt to think an Union of Poetry and Music executed on a larger Plan would be an admirable TwoHoursEntertainment either in a public Room or private Family  I enclose a Piece of Writing which a Friend of mine sent me in a Frank last Week I think the Subject calculated for your Liking It was planned and partly written in Mr HOARE's lovely Grounds at  Stourton  in  Wilt∣shire  and the Thought suggested by survey∣ing from an Eminence there a woody Vale wherein ALFRED is reported to have

 And now with penetrating Eye  He pierces the close Dell  Where in his Thatchbeshelter'd Cot  His Sire did whilom dwell  Yet in his sad and troubled Look  Such Terror might ye see  As when we almost

aloud to crow  Nor laboured Ox the vocal Air  Awaken with his Low  In strange Amazement and Suspense  Awhile benumb'd he stood  Then fell despairing on the Earth  And wept and wail'd aloud  His bitter

printed at  Edinburgh  in the Year  Edinburgh  June    Dear Sir  IT gives me the greatest Pleasure that I have an Opportunity of conveying to a Person of your Taste the inclosed Fragments of an∣tient  Caledonian  Poesy  "Full many a Gem of purest Ray serene  "The dark unfathom'd Caves of Ocean bear  "Full many a Rose is born to blush unseen  "And waste its Sweetness on the desart Air"  See GRAY's  Elegy in a Country ChurchYard  But Thanks to the Taste and Care of the in∣genious Translator that we have not to la∣ment the utter Loss of those Pieces which reflect so much Lustre on the Memory of the original Bards Here we see Poets framed by the Hand of Nature their Manners rude and  uncultivated as the Wilds they inhabited unacquainted with ARISTOTLE and HORACE but pouring the I had almost said involun∣tary Effusions of Minds filled with true poe∣tic Fire deeply interested in the Themes they sung devoid of all Rules they attach and warm the Heart by an amazing though se∣cret Power the constant Effect of copying Nature but copying her justly to which the languid Efforts of Art bear scarce so inte∣resting a Proportion as the Shadow to the Substance  From the general Structure of the Poetry from the Names of the Persons celebrated in it and the Hints of the  Costume  scattered here and there it would appear that these Poems were composed about the Time that the antient Bards of  Iceland  and the other northern Countries made so great a Figure in Poetry or perhaps their Date may reach back beyond the Time of Christianity being preached in our Islands hence it will follow that our Ancestors were rising by surprising Efforts to catch the fairest Flowers of  Par∣nassus  while the polite Regions of  Europe  re∣sounded  with polemic Theology and monkish Nonsense this becomes the more probable when we reflect that scarce any Trace of Christianity is to be found in these Pieces and no Trace of the Names that prevailed after the ninth Century instead of which the Names appear entirely Pagan and numberless Hints are taken from the predatory Life our Ancestors particularly those of the Islands and northwest Coasts of  Scotland  led before and at the first preaching of the Gospel among them A critical Examination of the original Language would help to throw some Light on this Conjecture as well as the Publication of Pieces of greater Length which may follow these first Specimens It is not however to be doubted that the many Fragments still preserved amongst our Highlanders of their an∣tient Poetry may be of great Use in settling the History and ascertaining the Meaning of several Antiquities dispersed over the moun∣tainous Parts of  Scotland  while the Man of Taste must be agreeably surprised to find a Beauty and Force of Diction a Warmth of Fancy a chaste and truly noble Simplicy united where hitherto no Person has ever looked for it  If these Specimens are well received by the Public and if suitable Encouragement were given to the ingenious Translator he would oblige the World with the Translation of the Epic Poem mentioned in the Preface which consists of upwards of nine thousand Lines but the dependant Situation of a Tutor can∣not afford him Leisure to undertake so great a Work  Your Friends in this Corner of the World were much disappointed in not having the Happiness of seeing you last Summer along with Lord LYTTELTON and without Flattery I can assure that the Number of your Friends in  Scotland  is greater than perhaps you think of and every one of them would be happy to have an Opportunity of seeing and obli∣ging you Lord ALEMOOR Dr ROEBUCK and his Spouse desire to be remembered and I shall take it as a particular Favour that you would at a leisure Hour write me your Opi∣nion of the inclosed Specimens and allow me to be with Esteem truly dear Sir  Your very obedient and most humble Servant J M G  Two frank'd Covers will bring the two first Divisions of the Fragment Please address for me at  Edingburgh  LETTER XLII Extract from a Letter of Mr  B  Lord  E  's Brother to Mr  T  May    I KNOW no Way so good of making up for my long Silence to you as sending you the enclosed Poem which if it gives you as much Pleasure as it did me you will give me no small Thanks for it is translated from an old Highland Poem by one Mr M' PHER∣SON a Minister in the Highlands There are great Numbers of these Elegies all over the Highlands which they sing to mournful Tunes in the Evening over their Fires Mr M' PHER∣SON has I hear translated ten more of them which I fancy will soon be published if they are not I shall endeavour to get them and send them to you It will be needless to say  any Thing in Praise of the Poem as I think it can sufficiently recommend itself The Trans∣lation has a great deal of Merit I think it is one of the best I ever saw I fancy SHEN∣STONE will be much pleased with the Poem which I shall be obliged to you if you will present to him with my Compliments  A FRAGMENT  This exquisite little Fragment is already published among the Notes in the first Volume of OSSIAN's  Works  but as in Mr SHENSTONE's Manuscript the Expression of many of the Passages varied from the printed Poem the Editor of this Work presumed an Insertion of his Copy might not be unwelcome to the Curious  THE following descriptive Poem though very old is of much later Date than the fore∣going Fragments  Five Bards who are the Guests of a Chief himself an excellent Poet go severally out to make their Observations on the Night and re∣turn each with an extemporary Description of it  to which the Chief adds one of his own The Time is supposed to be in  October  the Harvest Month in the Highlands when the Face of Nature is as various and its Changes as sudden as they are here represented  FIRST BARD  NIGHT is dull and dark  The Clouds rest on the Hills  No Star with twinkling Beam  No Moon looks from the Skies  I hear the Blast in the Wood  But distant and dull I hear it  The Stream of the Valley murmurs  Low is its Murmur too  From the Tree at the Grave of the Dead  The lonely ScreechOwl groans  I see a dim Form on the Plain  'Tis a Ghost It fades it flies  Some dead shall pass this Way  From the lowly Hut of the Hill  The distant Dog is howling  The Stag lies by the MountainWell  The Hind is at his Side  She hears the Wind in his Horns  She starts but lies again  The Roe is in the Cleft of the Rock  The HeathCock's Head beneath his Wing  No Beast no Bird is abroad  But the Owl and the howling Fox  She on the leafless Tree  He on the cloudy Hill  Dark panting trembling sad  The Traveller has lost his Way  Thro' Shrubs thro' Thorns he goes  Beside the gurgling Rills  He fears the Rock and the Pool  He fears the Ghost of the Night  The old Tree groans to the Blast  The falling Branch resounds  The Wind drives the  clung  Thorn  Along the sighing Grass  He shakes amid the Night  Dark dusky howling is  Night  Cloudy windy and full of Ghosts  The dead are abroad my Friends  Receive me from the Night  SECOND BARD  THE Wind is upon the Mountain  The Shower of the Hill descends  Woods groan and Windows clap  The growing River roars  The Traveller attempts the Ford  He falls he shrieks he dies  The Storm drives the Horse from the Hill  The Goat and the lowing Cow  They tremble as drives the Shower  And look for the Shade of the Stall  The Hunter starts from Sleep in his lone Hut  And wakes the Fire decay'd  His wet Dogs smoak around him  He stops the Chink with Heath  Loud roar two Mountain Streams  Which meet beside his Booth  Sad on the Side of the Hill  The wandering Shepherd sits  The Tree resounds above him  The Stream roars down the Rock  He waits the rising Moon  To lead him to his Home  Ghosts ride on the Storm tonight  Sweet is their Voice between the Gusts of Wind  Their Songs are of other Worlds  The Rain is pastthe dry Winds blow  Streams roar and Windows clap  Cold Drops fall from the Roof  I see the starry Sky  But the Shower gathers again  Dark dark is the western Sky  Night is stormy dismal dark  Receive me my Friends from the Night  THIRD BARD  THE Winds still sound between the Hills  And groan on the riven Rocks  The Firs fall from their Place on high  The turfy Hut is torn  The Clouds divided fly o'er the Sky  And shew the burning Stars  The Meteor Token of Death  Flies sparkling thro' the Gloom  It rests on the Hills it burnsI see the Fern  The dark Rock and fallen Oak  What dead is that in his Shroud  Beneath the Tree by the Stream  The Waves dark tumble on the Lake  And lash the rocky Sides  The Boat is brimfull in the Cove  The Oars on the rocky Tide  Sad sits a Maid beneath a Rock  And eyes the rolling Stream  Her Lover promised to come  She saw his Boat when it was light on the Lake  Is this his broken Boat on the Shore  Are these his Groans in the Wind  Hark the Hail rattles around  The Flakes of Snow descend  The Tops of the Hills are white  The stormy Winds abate  Various is Night and cold  Receive me my Friends from the Night  FOURTH BARD  NIGHT is calm and fair  Blue starry and settled is Night  The Winds with the Clouds are gone  They descend behind the Hill  The Moon is upon the Mountains  Trees glister Streams shine on the Rocks  Bright rolls the settling Lake  Bright the Stream of the Vale  I see the Trees o'erturned  The Shocks of Corn on the Plain  The wakeful Peasant rebuilds the Sheaves  Or drives the Beasts of the Hills away  Calm settled and fair is Night  Who comes from the Place of the Dead  That Form in the Robe of Snow  These white Arms that Hair of Gold  The Daughter of the Chief of the People  She that lately fell  Come let us view thee Maid  Thou that wert the Desire of Heroes  The Blast drives the Phantom away  White and without Form it ascends the Hill  The Breezes drive the blue Mist  Over the narrow Vale  Grey on the Hill it ascends  And joins itself to the Sky  Night is settled and calm  Blue starry bright with the Moon  Receive me not my Friends  For lovely is the Night  FIFTH BARD  NIGHT is calm but dreary  The Moon in a Cloud in the West  Slow moves that feeble Beam  Along the shady Hill  The distant Wave is heard  The Stream dull murmurs on the Rock  The Cock is heard from the Booth  More than half the Night is passed  The Housewife groping in the Gloom  Rekindles the settled Fire  The Hunter thinks it Day  And calls his nimble Dog  He ascends the Hill  And whistles the Road away  A Blast removes the Cloud  He sees the starry Plough of the North  Much of the Night is to pass  He nods by the mossy Stone  Hark the Whirlwind is in the Wood  Low Murmurs on the Plain  'Tis the Army of the mighty Dead  Returning from the Air  The Moon rests behind the Hill  The Beam is still on the lofty Rock  Long are the Shades of the Trees  But now 'tis dark over all  Night's dreary silent and dark  Receive me my Friends from the Night  SIXTH BARD The Chief himself  LET Clouds rest on the Hill  Spirits fly and Travellers fear  Let the Winds of the Wood arise  The sounding Storm descend  Roar Streams and Windows clap  And greenwinged Meteors fly  Rise the pale Moon on the Mountain  Or inclose her Head in Clouds  Night is alike to me  Blue gloomy or stormy the Sky  Night flies and her goblin Crew  When Morn is poured on the Hills  Light returns from the Gloom  But we return no more  Where are our Chiefs of old  Where our Kings of modern Name  The Fields whereon they fought are silent  Scarce their mossy Tombs remain  We too shall be forgot  This lofty House shall fall  Our Sons shall scarce see its Ruins on the Grass  And shall ask Where dwelt our Fathers  Raise the Song strike the Harp  Send around the  Shell  They drank out of a Shell as great Numbers do still  of Joy  Suspend a hundred Tapers on high  Maids and Youths begin the Dance  Some greylock'd Bard be near  And sing the Deeds of other Times  Of Kings renown'd in  Albion  Of Chiefs we see no more  Thus pass the Night  Till Morn is grey in our Hall  Then be the Bow in Hand  The Dogs and Youth of the Chace  We ascend the Hill with Day  And rouze the flying Deer  LETTER XLIII R G Esq to Mr HULL  June    Dear HULL  I SAFE arrived in  Somersetshire  after two pleasant and easy Days Journey and am now set down to write to you according to my Promise and to note what Alterations or Innovations I had observed upon in the Modes and Manners of  London  since I had not been there so long before  This Chapter is reduced to so few Heads from the several Conversations we had together in Town upon the taking down the Signs the rooting up the Posts the paving and lighting of  OxfordRoad Holborn MonmouthStreet  and  St Giles  's the constructing of  BlackFriarsBridge c  that I cannot recollect any other Remark I made worth mentioning at present except the introducing of Asses in the City for the Use of Milkmen Fruiterers Hawkers  c  This I thought a great Improvement as it serves to lessen the Number of Barrows that used to interrupt Walkers on the broad Pave∣ments but this Consideration was damped again at seeing the barbarous Treatment these poor Animals often suffer from their brutal Guides or Riders I often thought of STERNE upon these Occasions  See a Passage about an Ass in his  Sentimental Journey  An Ass is a dull slow Creature that will not mend its Pace for Whip or SpurThis these Wretches call  Obstinacy  and so punish it for a Defect of Nature as they would for a moral Vice for if they reason at all you may be sure they reason thus because it is wrong  This has renewed a Reflection in my Mind that has often occurred to me before upon the unaccountable Disposition towards Cruelty exercised against the BruteCreation which is too frequently observed among the general Classes of Mankind who have not been re∣strained by natural Sentiment or refined by a liberal Education  If Sympathy as modern Philosophers assert be the ultimate Cause of our being affected for others that of Pain one would think should be the strongest All Men do not feel Misfortunes or suffer Grief alike One Per∣son may resent a Mortification or a Loss to Madness while his more temperate Friend can afford his Pity or Compassion no higher or further than his own Passions or Sentiments would have extended in the same Circumstances Here Sympathy is at an End But all Per∣sons and Animals too are alike sensible of Pain  Ergo    We have from hence Reason to conclude that 'tis more from Want of Thought than of Humanity that the contrary is so apparent and this Argument I think is fully proved by the Observation that Children and Fools are the most guilty of it  Besides which there is a great deal in Cus∣tom that may take off from the natural Feel∣ings of Compassion with Regard to the BruteCreation among Numbers of People such as  Butchers Surgeons Soldiers  c  A Fish∣woman being reprehended for the Barbarity of fleaing Eels alive answered that it was no Cruelty  as they were so much used to it  which was plainly transferring the Insensibility she had herself acquired through Habit to the poor suf∣fering Reptile This puts me in Mind of the Blunder of an  Irish  Parliament once that framed an Act to punish Forgery with the Loss of both Ears and so  toties quoties  There is also I apprehend a Sort of No∣tion resting in uninstructed Minds that Mo∣rality has nothing to do with our Actions to∣wards Brutes any more than it has with Re∣gard to inanimate Nature so that many Folks from such a strange Misconception torture an Animal with as little Remorse as they would lop off the Branch of a Tree Such People must never have read the Sentence of SOLO∣MON that  a good Man is merciful to his Beast  nor that of SHAKESPEARE  "The poor Beetle that we tread upon  "In corp'ral Suff'rance feels a Pang as great  "As when a Giant dies"  I remember I was once sitting with a Friend and seeing his Son tormenting a poor Dog by making him suffer great Pain I spake to the Father to reprove him for it to which he coolly answered that as he designed the Boy for the Army he did not care to inspire him with too tender Feelings  "Your Idea might not be much amiss"  I replied  "if you meant to breed him a Butcher or a Hangman"  What a Gothic Notion that Bravery and Hu∣manity were incompatible  OVID seems to have been of my Opinion in the above Reproof by making Priests who were the first Butchers or Sacrificers to have led the Way to Cruelty and Slaughter  Primoque a caede Ferarum  Incaluisse putem maculatum sanguine Ferrum  I will not say however that this may be the Reason why Parsons and Butchers are equally excluded from being on Juries of Life and Death because there would be a Sort of  pert Dulness  in the RemarkAsking Pardon for the  TautologyNo the true Reason for these Exclusions is that the latter are rendered cal∣lous from being too familiar with Slaughter and with Regard to the former that the Mini∣sters of Peace should keep clear of Blood  A Thought has just occurred to me I have not Leisure both to examine and to write it too so I shall only sport it for the present Perhaps the Injunction in the Levitical Law to abstain from Blood might not have been meant in Derogation of  BlackPuddings  in the least but only as a figurative Manner of re∣peating the Sixth Commandment  "Thou shalt do no Murder"  A Comment upon the Inhibition of PYTHA∣GORAS  Abstine à Fabis  Abstain from Beans  has hinted this No∣tion to me for the learned BACON which Name you know accords very well with  Beans  says that what the Sage intended by the Pro∣hibition was to forbid meddling with the Con∣tentions and Strife of Electioneering where the Votes or Suffrages were given  pro  and  con  by black and white Beans  And this Interpretation ought certainly to appear the true Sense of the Precept from this Consideration for as that Philosopher had before restricted his Disciples from the Use of all animal Food on Account of the transmi∣gratory Notions he had picked up in  India  he could not possibly have been so unconscio∣nable as to have laid any Manner of Restraint on the vegetable Product of the Earth  Yours  c  R G  LETTER XLIV Mrs to Mr HULL of  CoventGarden  Theatre  THE great Respect you Sir have shewn to Mr SHENSTONE in dedicating your Tragedy of ROSAMOND to his Memory added to the Pleasure I have received from some of your other Publications will I trust plead an Excuse for an Intrusion from a Stranger and especially as it is to beg your Acceptance of the enclosed Poem it was written by that Friend whose Death you so feelingly lament it has been in my Possession ever since or before that Period of its Merits I am no Judge but from its Author should imagine it not destitute and have long regretted its remaining in Hands so little capable of mak∣ing it appear as it ought The sincere Plea∣sure I received in seeing Mr SHENSTONE's Name so respectfully and publickly revived induced me to wish to make the Author some Acknowledgment and this appears to be the  only Way for should not the  Diamond  have Brilliancy enough for the Public yet it may not be an unwelcome Amusement to a private Friend to remove the Dimness  I should much sooner have made this Ac∣knowledgment but from a Diffidence of its being accepted however I hope the best and that you will be kind enough to accept it as it is meant Should it prove worthy of No∣tice and acceptable to so partial a Friend I shall hope as I have no Copy to receive your Opinion and must request it as a par∣ticular Favour that to any Friend you chuse to shew it my Name may not be mentioned on that Account I decline saying any Thing of myself My Address is  c  Permit me to hope you will excuse the Er∣rors of a weak Pen and believe me Sir  Your obliged humble Servant M  Dec    THE DIAMOND A POEM  CANTO I  CUPID o'er human

confest  She clos'd the Box and joyous thought the rest  A Joy like this harmonious ORPHEUS knew  When wond'rous Husband to the Shades he flew  And wand'ring 'long the Gloom with glad Sur∣prise  Perceiv'd at last his Consort's sparkling Eyes  Ah dear BRILLANTE few thy Story know  Whose Beauties in this Gem eternal glow  Yet shall the pious Muse the Tale relate  And with her Verse adorn BRILLANTE's Fate  Of humble Birth the bright Enchanter came  Unequal to her Beauty Wit or Fame  Deep in a lonely Vale she shone retir'd  Few saw the Maid but all who saw admir'd  She shun'd no Virtue tho' she sought no Praise  And pass'd in quiet unexpos'd her Days  Much had she heard the various Toils that wait  The Pride of Riches and the Pomp of State  Much her fond Mother taught with pious Care  And latest Breath 'twas dang'rous to be fair  "BRILLY" she cried "my tender Child fare∣wel  "Shun the gay Court and grace this humble Cell  "There various Arts for Innocence are laid  "To ruin Youth and trap th' unwary Maid  "Charms in an humble State may prove a Snare  "But plac'd on high they cheat the nicest Care  "Let ev'ry Rule my living Care supply'd  "When I'm unheard of be thy Virtue's Guide  "And ev'ry Maxim giv'n preserve in Store  "To guard those Charms I now must view no more  "AdieuIf e'er the Wiles of Courts you see  "And weak'ning Virtue faulter think of me"  Fresh Charms adorn'd her as more Years she knew  Her Fame extended as her Beauties grew  A rigid Sternness all her Beauties arm'd  Which ev'ry faint minute Approach alarm'd  The opening Rose shone in her Cheeks refin'd  And like its guardian Thorn her Virtue join'd  The wond'ring Prince receiv'd at length her Fame  And to the Court convey'd th' unwilling Dame  Th' unwilling Dame to please he vainly strove  Too soon she rais'd but ne'er return'd his Love  Here long she shone untainted and the same  And as her Virtue spotless was her Fame  By Arts unsoften'd tho' by Arts improv'd  Her Charms mov'd all by Charms herself un∣mov'd  APOLLO burn'dBut since the Fair cou'd prove  In courts uninjur'd still restrain'd his Love  And wond'ring swore a Nymph so fair so chaste  In Fame's Memorial by the Pow'r should last  Hence when to Dust dissolv'd his shining Frame  Contracting soon a glitt'ring Gem became  Charms not inferior still the Stone retains  And wounding all itself untouch'd remains  These signal Honours LOVE indignant bore  And vow'd to raze them or his own restore  "If thus" he cry'd "BRILLANTE void of Pain  "Could all my Arrows all my Arts sustain  "Yet shall her Fate assist my slighted Bow  "And raise those Joys she ne'er deserv'd to know  "For me her Gem its Lustre shall employ  "For me her Patron's hourly Rays enjoy  "For me o'er yielding Panes victorious move  "And paint in am'rous Lines th' immortal Feats of LOVE"  THE DIAMOND CANTO II  NOW Sol to western Climes directs his Blaze  And gilds LAMIRA's Couch with parting Rays  The Hour when Nymphs on airy Substance prey  And thinly feed on Scandal and on Tea  The Moment comesthe Visitants are seen  With Tales replete and grossly fill'd with Spleen  The powder'd Valet trips in neat Array  Bright on the TeaBoard shines the glitt'ring Clay  There artful China pictur'd Grots and Bow'rs  Hills Rivers Vallies Turrets Meads and Flow'rs  Bright azure Pastures deep impervious Shades  Deserving Swains and not ingrateful Maids  Beneath a clouded Beach a Shepherd lay  And with blue Fingers play'd or seem'd to play  The gen'rous Nymphs forsook the neighb'ring Plains  To court his Passion or admire his Strains  The eager Painter form'd too quick the Glance  And Thirst of Gain had spoil'd the mimic Dance  Oh hateful Av'rice ever doom'd to prove  The Bane of Arts and much unkind to Love  The gazing Flocks and softlytreading Fawns  With Ears uplifted seem to skim the Lawns  Full twice a Day can this LAMIRA view  Yet hear unmov'd her Swain his Notes renew  Th' impartial Pot streams equal Shares around  Scarce on the Bench is greater Justice found  The Sugar sinks like  Zembla  's Hills of Snow  Whene'er decending Tides their Tops o'erflow  The soft Imperial breaths a fragrant Fume  And from each Check calls forth reviving Bloom  But chief LAMIRA doubly form'd to please  Shone Beauty's Queen amidst her infant Seas  Hail fav'rite Plant whose fragrant Scent in∣spires  The Statesman's Projects

let the Muse what Female can contain  A Secret known poor THEA's Fate explain  THEA a Nymph whom ENVY wand'ring o'er  This nether World to artful MOMUS bore  Too soon she knew no Scandal to conceal  And learnt to raise it or when rais'd reveal  Her stamm'ring Tongue was fram'd to lisp Dis∣grace  But when she spake all Merit left the Place  Her careful Parents as she grew display'd  Each various Branch of Slander's mystic Trade  The Look sincere the deep persuasive Wile  The Frown tremendous and more dreadful Smile  The Wink which more than real Blame instils  Pity that murders and Concern that kills  Malicious Whisp'rings ever fatal found  Which like retiring  Parthians  doubly wound  Wit to invent and Malice to declare  Disgrace on all the Witty Chaste or Fair  All these they taught and what they taught en∣join'd  And view'd themselves in THEA more refin'd  Ah thoughtless Pair your fatal Kindness leave  Nor bless those Arts for which you once must grieve  The Nymph with these and Arts like these en∣du'd  Charms Virtue Wit with artful Spite pursu'd  From Earth's Abodes at length exil'd the Fair  To Heav'n confin'd and persecuted there  There blending Vice with Virtue Truth with Lies  Left not one Virgin to adorn the Skies  She told why Deities admire Perfumes  And trac'd the heav'nly Rise of BlackLead Combs  Gave Hints what Stays mechanic PALLAS wore  And why DIANA chac'd the sylvan Boar  What Muse forgot her Eyebrow Box she shew'd  And why AURORA's Face with Crimson glow'd  She knew that Virgin Vestal was no Saint  And JUNO's Toilette shone with Floods of Paint  That VENUS sure from Nature ne'er would swerve  But for Ambrosia Iv'ry Teeth might serve  Revenge and Rage th' offended Pow'rs alarms  For heav'nly Breasts terrestrial Fury warms  Conscious of Virtue some with Rage o'erflow'd  Of Guilt the most with deeper Crimson glow'd  As once DIANA chac'd along the Glade  Her usual Prey she spy'd th' illfated Maid  "And take" she cry'd "from CYNTHIA's Bow the Fate  "Which injur'd Fame exacts alas too late"  She saidthe Javelin pierc'd her tender Side  And the moist Turf with guilty Crimson dy'd  Quick on the Turf a rising Plant was seen  Which bears her Name and blooms for ever green  Now Tea and Coffee spire in Steams no more  And Cups inverted shew the Banquet o'er  Not so the SlanderSILVIA's Hand sustains  A Cup enrich'd with nine important Grains  From hence the Fair the Fall of Modes discerns  And Life's Events in typic Visions learns  The Fair's important Annals hence relates  And with soft ruby Lips unfolds the Fates  Yet now her own for Fortune's Will displays  And guides those Laws which JOVE himself obeys  For gay SELINDA Visits Journeys News  And one poor Lover at a Distance views  In CHLOE's hapless Dish more deeply brown  The sable Honours of a Parson's Gown  LIVONIA's yields Groves Meadows Fields and Lawns  And in her own a Star obscurely dawns  "Tell me" she cries "why that small Meteor shines  "Which with the Dishes azure Circle joins"  But ah what Pen LAMIRA shall explain  Thy Anger Scorn Resentment and Disdain  When she too partial to the States Decree  Consign'd MYRTILLO hapless Maid to thee  "Revenge revenge"

Harborough  perhaps about the Year and has a more simple Plan than the other but has little or nothing to recommend it besides W SHENSTONE  LETTER XLV Mrs W to Mr HULL  PERMIT me Sir to assure you that to me your Manner of receiving what I thought only a due Acknowledgment to your disinterested Friendship more than even ac∣quits a real Obligation as well as gives me a sincere Pleasure in reflecting that what I esteem'd is at last in the Hands of one who will equally value its intrinsic Worth and is so much more capable of introducing it proper∣ly to the public Inspection such I imagine is your Intention and I most willingly receive the Favour you offer of letting me know your Determination for why may I not look upon the Friend of a Gentleman whose Me∣mory I esteem in the Number of my own Give me leave so to do and as such to pre∣sent the Compliments of the Season to you and Mrs HULL with cordial Wishes for your seeing many happy Returns  The Manner of the  Diamond  is similar to the Poem you mention  POPE's  Rape of the Lock  but if I may without exposing my Judgment speak the Truth I give the former the Preference even against POPE and this because I think there is greater Deli∣cacy of Sentiment but what else could be ex∣pected from a Mind the Characteristics of which were refined Sensibility and unbounded Bene∣volence Though as I cannot express more than I believe you think I will stop my Pen by saying that I trust you will allow your own Wish relative to the  SnuffBox  as a Plea for my so soon troubling you with another Letter and that I remain with due Respect  SIR  Your obliged and obedient humble Servant Mrs W  Monday  Night  Jan    P S I thank you for the two Inscriptions to the Memory of our amiable Friend They would have been agreeable Companions to some of the same Turn already printed at the End of his Works by Mr DODSLEY That which was wrote by CUNNINGHAM is possessed of genuine Elegance and Sensibility I dare say you think so Those you have sent affect me in the same Manner particularly the  Prose  Tribute which you tell me came from a fe∣male Pen I think I can guess the Writer and would when next I see her challenge a Confession were I sure I could do it with∣out wounding her Delicacy of Feeling  The Elegy I also admire much The Thoughts of the Author are equally tender and benevolent with those of the Friend whose Memory he so pathetically laments The last Lines of the second Stanza particularly please me  INSCRIPTION Alluded to in the foregoing Letter  On the left Side  of the only Building I can call my own  is consecrated  a  Monument  to the Memory of  the belov'd and lamented  WILLIAM SHENSTONE  'Tis form'd something like an Urn  nevertheless of a Substance so soft  that all his Virtues  were with Ease engraven on it  yet so tenacious  they never can be eras'd  It is inscrib'd with Affection and Respect  for the gentle and elegant Qualities  of which he was  the happy Possessor  and stampt with the deepest Gratitude  for the Honour he had conferr'd  by his kind and condescending Notice  of the  thereby  dignified Owner  M M  ELEGY Referred to in the foregoing Postscript  WHEN Music awakens the Grove  Softbreathing the pastoral Note  Ye Shepherds who know how to love  Be CORYDON never forgot  Of Swains the most tender and kind  Now low in the Dust is he laid  Ye who knew not his elegant Mind  Ah meWhat a Loss have ye had  His Feelings were mild as the Air  That pants on the Bosom of  May    His Truth as the SunBeam was clear  And his Heart was as open as Day  When a neighbouring Swain was in Grief  His Wants he would gladly supply  If his Acres deny'd the Relief  Like him would he sadden and sigh  His Verse was the Pride of the Grove  His Song to the Valley was dear  And the Shepherd who knows how to Love  Still hallows his Name with a Tear  When the Village is folded in Sleep  And Midnight invelopes the Skies  The Muses still cluster still weep  O'er the Turf where our CORYDON lies  LETTER LVI R G Esq to Mr HULL  Dear  c  I Received your Letter and it has astonished me that you can be in the least Degree hurt by the Opinion of narrow Minds With Regard to the Grievance you complain of let it be always a Matter of Consolation to you that the illiberal Treatment Actors may some∣times meet with on Account of their Profession can never proceed from any but illiberal Minds 'tis the Censurers themselves who become Objects of Contempt when they would render you so  from that Consideration merely  and this Reflec∣tion ought therefore to make you as indifferent to such Instances of Ignorance and Illbreed∣ing  as you would be to a  Billingsgate  Scold or a St  Giles  's Abuse  An Actor is a respectable Character while he properly considers and endeavours to preserve the original Design of his Profession and I have ever been of Opinion and am convinced of the Truth of the Maxim that acting should unques∣tionably be accepted among the Liberal Arts even with this Advantage over Poetry and Pain∣ting that it superadds Example to Document and Delight 'Tis the  living Moral  while the others are but the  dead Letter  The Stage is a School and may be an useful one tooAs such it was patronized and cherished by the wisest and most virtuous States of  Greece  and  Rome  and it has been the Fault of Managers not of Actors when∣ever Theatres have ceased to afford either Pre∣cept or Example  There are so many Requisites of Talents Assiduity and Person to form a complete Actor that even a moderate Degree of Ex∣cellence should be deemed sufficient Merit to entitle a Performer to the public Favour and Indulgence to which if an honest decent  and unexceptionable Repute be joined I can see no Sort of Reason in the Nature or Di∣stinction of Things why the  Sock and Buskin  should not be admitted  ad eundem  with the  Goif and Cowl  so that it must be the  per∣sonal  Character and not the  Dramatis Personae  that can ever debase your Profession in which Predicament both the Parson and the Lawyer stand equally with you  But indeed the World that illiberal Part of it which you hint at are apt to consider us Au∣thors also in the same inferior Light they do Actors I remember a Friend of mine some∣time ago was cast off by his Father for having published a very ingenious Poem while he was a Student at the Temple and another Acquaintance was severely reproved by his Re∣lations for having married a Lady every other Way worthy of his Choice  because she had written a Book  Such curious Censors I suppose would de∣spise the Meanness of my Spirit now if I should declare to them that I would rather have been HOMER or VIRGIL than ALEX∣ANDER  or AUGUSTUS and ROSCIUS the Ac∣tor than the Tribune of the same Name though the latter was a Sort of Manager as may be proved by his having framed the  Lex Roscia  for the Regulation of the Theatre at  Rome  But it might possibly reconcile them to me again if I should confess this common Foible of human Nature at the same Time that fond as I am of Fame I would yet rather be even what I am myself  now  than the best of them all  then  This is some Sort of Qua∣lification to the former Sentiment  I shall here conclude my Letter to you with intreating that you will continue to de∣feat the Malice of such ignorant Censors by an uniform Attention to the Spirit and Utility of that  Walk  in Life which either Fortune or your own Choice has led you into Elevate your Crest take  for your Motto and study the following Lines which this Subject has just brought to my Mind  Pro Libitû imponunt

affectionately R G  LETTER LVII  This Letter like some others in this Collection is purposely misplaced in Point of Date in Order to connect Matter rather than Periodsthe ensuing being wholly from  one  Correspondent and comprehending among them Observations on the  Venetian  Republic  Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  Oct    Dear Sir  WHEN you undertook to be the Ama∣nuensis as well as the ReceiverGene∣ral to the agreeable Society I have left with so much Regret I remember you charged me to write as soon as I should reach this Place I accordingly begin my Task and am very happy to have an Opportunity of writing to you a good long Letter without the Expence of Postage which I have not the Vanity to sup∣pose my Epistles deserve I send this by a pretty Sort of Man whose Name is and who I should suppose has some strong Attachment in your County which induces him to take so long a Journey at this rude Season of the Year  We were very fortunate in Weather and found the Roads as good as the Nature of the  Country will allow them to be Some Parts of  Savoy  is frightfully wild and dreary other Parts very romantic and beautiful I was vast∣ly amused with the Manner of crossing Mount  Cenis  the Chair we are carried in or rather  on  resemble a good deal a  Chinese  Palanquin only they want a Canopy over them the Chairmen are certainly the best in the World or it would be both dangerous and frightful it seems to me that they have the Strength of Mules and the Agility of Goats for they run down the Precipices and bound from Rock to Rock in a most astonishing Manner The Ascent of the Mountain is three Miles on the Side of  Savoy  the Plain on the Top six Miles in Length and the Descent on the  Turin  Side six Miles more we had four Men to each of the Ladies' Chairs and six to the Gentlemen's and after carrying us these fifteen dreadful Miles they were quite delighted that our Party took them on from  Novalese  a small Town at the Foot of Mount  Cenis  to  Susa  which is nine Miles further and they carried us the last three Leagues in an Hour and a Half laughing and jesting with each other all the Way as if they had been doing a Thing  merely for Sport and Amusement so you see my dear Sir how visible the Goodness of Pro∣vidence is to all Creatures these poor Souls who spend all their Lives in the utmost In∣digence and inhabit a Country that seems only fit for Savages if they are denied the Luxu∣ries of Life are amply repaid in the Enjoy∣ment of a double Portion of Health and Strength  We stopped a few Days at  Lyons Turin Milan  and  Verona  and saw every Thing wor∣thy a Stranger's Curiosity in each of these fine Cities nothing amused me more than seeing a Parcel of  Angels  walking about the Streets of  Milan  they were fine Cherrycheek'd Boys ready dressed for a grand Procession that was preparing for the Day following in Ho∣nour of the  Virgin Mary  's BirthDay  Venice  is a very magnificent Place and possesses the Charm of Novelty in a much higher Degree than any of the other Places I have named 'tis impossible to give a stronger Idea of it 'tis in a Stile so peculiar to itself The Mask∣ing is begun which is extremely entertaining I should be excessively happy to pop in amongst  your dear Society some Day when you are all as∣sembled I assure you it would be no small Surprize to see me in a  Venetian  Dress it consists of a long black silk Cloak called here a  Tabora  a  Baouta  which is made of black Lace three Quarters of a Yard long and five Times as wide and hangs about the Shoul∣ders like a Petticoat it has a Hood to it which when you choose to be concealed covers the bottom Part of the Face to the upper Lip the rest is hid by a white Mask and the Women wear on their Heads a Man's Hat smartly cocked the  Venetian  Women who are rather masculine in their Manner look still more so in this Dress  We have had the Prince of  Brunswick  here for ten Days which made the Town all alive I will describe to you one of the Entertain∣ments made for him and that will serve as a Specimen of all the Rest Our Resident had not got then into his Palace as it is justly called for it is indeed a noble one so that he could not make any Entertainments for the Prince but he gave him some excellent Mu∣sic one Morning in a private Manner which  he seemed to enjoy the more for being so The Night after his Highness's Arrival Count DURAZZO the Imperial Ambassador invited all the  English  the foreign Nobility that don't belong to  Venice  and all the foreign Ministers to meet the Prince at Supper The Ambassa∣dress received her Guests with mingled Grace and Dignity she is really a fine Woman and her Beauty was heightened by all the Elegance of Dress soon after the Company were as∣sembled a most delightful Serenade began upon the Water which was not only delightful to the Ear but formed a very beautiful Object to the Sight for the Musicians were placed in a large open Barge finely illuminated the Har∣mony drew around them an infinite Number of Gondolas belonging to the noble Venetians who could no otherwise partake of this Feast for by their Laws they are secluded from all Commerce with Strangers that are in a public Character At proper Intervals of the Music all Sorts of Refreshments of Ices Fruits Sweatmeats Lemonades  c c  were presented to the Company who when they had listened to the Serenade for some Time changed the Scene either sat down to Cards or formed little chat∣ting  Parties When the CardTables broke up a very elegant Concert composed of a few choice Pieces of Music performed by the very best Hands agreeably filled up Time till a most magnificent Supper was served When the Company rose from Table Coffee was brought which is the Custom here after Supper as well as after Dinner when this was over a superb Barge attended in which the Prince and all the Ladies and a suitable Number of Gentlemen were placed and rowed to St  Mark's  which is the only public Place here for walking followed by the Music the rest of the Company in their Gondolas and those of the noble  Venetians  which the Harmony had attracted After walking for some Time to enjoy the cool Air the Company retired to a very elegant Apartment which the Am∣bassadress has on the Place of St  Mark  where she receives her Company when she chuses to be in private When we had chatted here for Half an Hour it was found to be a proper Time to retire as it was three o'Clock in the Morning and so ended this agreeable Even every Part of which was employed in some innocent Amuse∣ment without any Thing being hurried or con∣fused  I have been the more particular in this Account that you may see my good Friend that Taste and Elegance is no more wanting in  Venice  than it is in the gay Metropolis of  Britain  I hope you will soon indulge me with a Letter and that it will bring me a good Account of yourself and every worthy Indi∣vidual of our Friends in Friendship assembled send it in a Frank to Mr L in Street  London  and he will put it in his Ex∣cellency's Packet it must be but a single Letter but I hope it will contain a good deal I long to hear that your good Mother is well reestablished in her Health she is a worthy Soul and one cannot help wishing such People to live for ever I hope my dear Friend though such a cruel Distance divides us that I am not esteemed the less a Member of the friendly Society than if I was with you I find the same Warmth of Affection towards the happy Circle as if I was not an  Absen∣tee  therefore beg you will give my best Af∣fections to all the happy Members  I went the other Day to see the Ceremony of a Nun taking the last Veil and 'tis very awful and melancholy and to speak honestly and unprudishly does not inspire me with the least Desire to be a Nun first the divine Service is performed with very fine Music both vocal and instrumental in the Church of the Convent then a little Door is opened in the Grate of the private Chapel before which the Nun is seated on a Chair of State under a Canopy with a PrayerBook in her Hand till the Service is finished she then comes forward and kneeling at the Grate repeats to a Priest the Vows of the Order and promises Obedience to the Abbess she then rises and the Nuns take off her white Veil and put on a black one after which she kneels and says some Prayers then six of the Sisters advance and hold over her a purple Pall whilst Part of the FuneralService is read during which Time she is supposed to be  dead  they then take away the purple Cloth and the Abbess places on her Head a Crown richly ornamented with Jewels to signify that she dies to the World and rises again to Glory she then receives  from the Priest a Tablet with the Rules of the Order which she reads over and kisses then with the Tablet in one Hand and a long wax Taper ornamented with Wreaths of Flow∣ers in the other she walks slowly round the Chapel followed by the rest of the Nuns and deposits the Tablet on the Altar Thus ends the melancholy Ceremony This young Lady was very pretty and not above seventeen we all thought she had an Appearance of great Constraint in her Chearfulness but we were assured it was entirely her Choice that she had a large Fortune had buried her Father and was Mistress of herself perhaps it may be the Taste of the Family for another Sis∣ter professed last Year in the same Convent  As we are but just got to our new Habi∣tation you will easily suppose nobody is idle the House however I was determined I would not lose so fair an Opportunity of writing to you so hope you will excuse so vile a Scrawl and believe me when I assure you there is nothing more true than that I am my good Sir ever most sincerely and affectionately yours and the Society's  S N  LETTER LVIII Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  Dec    MAY every Blessing of this chearful Sea∣son await you and every Individual of the happy Family and Friends you are with May your Pleasures be unmixed with Pain and your Years numerous and happyRe∣ceive these fervent Wishes of an exiled Mem∣ber of your worthy Society and be assured that though you are all Absent from my Sight you are ever present to my Mind I wrote you a long Letter near three Months ago by an  Irish  Gentleman who assured me he should be in your Part of the World as soon as the Post when lo and behold three Weeks ago I heard of him at  Sienna  where I sup∣pose he will stay the Winter therefore as I am quite in the Dark in Regard to the Fate of my unfortunate Epistle I could not be easy till I had again set Pen to Paper  to request you will all continue to love me as I do you which I assure you my dear Sir is with undiminished Truth I believe I told you in my last how to forward a Letter to me but for fear you have never received it I will repeat it if you can send it to any Friend in  London  and get them to forward it by the Penny Post to Mr L in Street he will enclose it in the Secretary of State's Packet by which Means I shall be more certain of getting it safe than by the Post as well as that I shall receive it free  I have a great Favour my dear Sir to beg of you which is that you will procure me a Piece of Information for the Use of our Resident in Regard to a young Gentleman who has been at  Venice  for some Time and seems in no Hurry to leave it owing as we imagine to an Attachment to a fair  Venetian  Lady his Name is his Family he says is settled near  F  in  Somersetshire  he makes a genteel Appearance in Point of Fortune and seems to be a modest pretty behaved young Man upon which Account his Excel∣lency wishes to shew him any Civility in his  Power but at the same Time would be glad to be rightly informed as to his Character and Family before he receives him in an in∣timate Manner I thought it was very pro∣bable Mr D might know his Father I have some Notion I have heard the Name mentioned at Mr B's if my dear Sir you can procure me a particular Account of this young Hero I shall esteem it as a great Fa∣vour  I am become wonderfully fond of the mas∣quing Dress and am told I wear it just as well as a  Venetian  'tis the most comfortable warm WalkingDress that can be conceived I have kept House these last nine Days be∣cause it was prohibited but tomorrow Mas∣quing begins again and continues till Lent I am told we had an Earthquake but thank God I did not perceive it since that there had been very tempestuous Weather and vio∣lent Snow and Rain which added to a high Tide overflowed all the Canals and I can't but say at that Time  Venice  gave me a strong Idea of the universal Deluge  There have been five Theatres open till within these nine Days and I am told in the Carnival there will be no less than seven The comic Opera was very pleasing in Point of Music and always crouded but the serious Opera nobody could bear though MANZOLI sung in it and TIBALDI who is reckoned one of the best tenor Voices if not the very best now living By this you will perceive how the  English  and  Italian  Taste for Music differs though I must say I believe the great∣est Admirers of MANZOLI would allow he is much altered for the worse for my own Part had I not remembered his Person I should not have had the least Recollection of him from his Voice The Theatre he performed at was entirely fitted up with Glass both the Stage and all the Boxes which when well lighted had a fine Effect There was a Change of the Scenes for one of the Dances that was I think one of the most beautiful Things I ever beheld  The  Italian  Comedy does not delight me much for I do not understand the Language  well enough yet to be amused with the  Bon∣mots  of HARLEQUIN and to laugh at him because he has a black Face and at PAN∣TALOON merely for having a long Beard it is not what I feel myself much disposed to do I understand the  Italian  Tragedies better than the Comedies but I find the Actors in∣finitely below ours I intend to be very stu∣dious and when all the Family are gadding to the Opera and the Play I shall sit at home and drudge at the  Italian  and this for many good Reasons but chiefly to acquit my∣self of my chief Promise to you  We have at present a second Edition of the Prince of  Brunswick  who has been at  Ve∣nice  a Week but on  Monday  next he leaves us entirely This Time he has spent most of his leisure Hours with our Resident and expresses great Pleasure in being received on an intimate and easy Footing he is really a very sensible and agreeable Man and as far as can be judged from outward Appearance is very amiable he has with him two young  German  Barons who are also very pretty Kind  of Men and speak  English  so well that it is a Comfort to hear them  My Brother desires me to present his best Respects to you and I hope my dear nominal Uncle will always be mindful to say for me to the dear Society every Thing that is kind grateful and affectionate  My Vanity will not suffer me to pass over in Silence a Conquest that I am told I have certainly made of an  Italian  Count who is here in a public Character he is not quite sixty his Figure and Complexion exactly re∣sembles a very bad long thin TallowCandle he is much bedaubed with  Spanish  Snuff and on meagre Days so overcomes one with Gar∣lick that it is dreadful except these little Accidents he is a most agreeable Companion for he is very sensible very religious very philosophic extremely polite and his Conver∣sation is both instructive and amusing Now my good Friend from the Picture I have drawn would you not think I was in some Danger of losing my Heart but that luckily  my amiable Count is a bigotted Roman Ca∣tholic and I an obstinate  Heretick  We may give ourselves what Airs we please about our  English  Liberty but for the  Ladies Italy  is undoubtedly the Land of perfect Free∣dom to all public Places they constantly go in Pairs with their  Cavalier Serventes  and put me much in Mind of the  clean  and  unclean  Beasts going into the Ark What would be∣come of the Reputation of a miserable  English  Woman if she was to go to the Play with a Man  têteàtête  And yet that is constantly done here without Imputation of WrongIn short if a Woman has any Mind to be wicked  Venice  seems to be the last Place in the World to give her better Sentiments  How delighted should I be to surprize the dear Society some Night or other when you are over your sober Game of Quadrille in my white Masque and Man's Hat you have no Notion with what an Air I have learnt to put it over my right Eye I will not de∣spair but that we may again meet happily under that hospitable Roof where for some  Weeks in the Enjoyment of such friendly Conversation I tasted more real Happiness and Peace than I ever experienced  before  or  since  in my whole Life I did not know be∣fore I had the melancholy Experience of it how very irksome and painful a Feel it is to be so very far from those we truly regard Adieu my dear Friends may Heaven shower upon you all its choicest Blessings is the sin∣cere and constant Prayer of your ever faithful and affectionate  S N  LETTER LIX Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  April    THE only Task you enjoined me on lea∣ving  England  is perhaps the most dif∣ficult you could have exacted from me never∣theless I am resolved to attempt it for how∣ever you may be disappointed in my Perfor∣mance I shall at least have the Satisfaction  of proving that I chearfully obey any Com∣mand of yours and though surrounded with Difficulties I enter upon the Performance of my Promise with Courage well knowing from the Candour of your Disposition that you will accept of an earnest Desire on my Part to gratify your laudable Curiosity in Lieu of greater Abilities for such an Undertaking  I am not surprised that a Person of your speculative Turn should feel an earnest Desire to be made acquainted with some Particulars relative to the wise and complicated Govern∣ment of the Republic of  Venice  it justly merits the Attention of the sensible and curious Part of Mankind were it only to discover by what Means it has been preserved nearly in the same State for such a Number of Ages but it is hardly possible to arrive with Certainty at this Knowledge for there is no Subject the  Vene∣tians  are so tenacious of conversing upon as Politicks profound Secrecy being the great Engine on which this very singular Govern∣ment turns I find  one must  not depend too much on the Accounts of those who have written upon the Subject for after allowing  the utmost to their Integrity and Industry they must have been often liable to Misinfor∣mation besides the unavoidable Change that Time naturally produces in all sublunary Things I have now lying before me a Hi∣story of the Republic by AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI one by ST DISDIER and another by the ABBÉE LANGIER of a much later Date and I shall freely transcribe from these Authors in as succinct a Manner as possible all such Passages as coincide with the present State of Things but the most pleasing As∣sistant I promise myself is Mr SMITH who has been settled in this City a great Number of Years and was formerly the  British  Con∣sul he is now retired from Business and de∣votes his Time to the Study and Encourage∣ment of the polite Arts of which he is a li∣beral Protector he is at present appointed  Chargé d'Affaires  by our Court till the Ar∣rival of Sir JAMES WRIGHT who succeeds the present Ambassador at  Constantinople  in the Residentship of  Venice  I am sorry the new Minister is not expected during my Stay here for as I am told he has spent some Time in this Capital when upon his Travels in a pri∣vate  Character Under his Auspices I might perhaps with more Ease have pursued my Researches Mr SMITH is an intelligent sensi∣ble Man and preserves in a very advanced Age a Degree of Politeness Vivacity and GoodHumour rarely to be met with which renders his Conversation as pleasing as it is instructive This Gentleman is married to the Sister of Mr MURRAY the late Resident a very amiable Woman their House is open every Evening to the  English  in the most easy agreeable Manner where I have infinite Plea∣sure in talking over in a polite chearful Cir∣cle the  Virtù  that has engaged my Attention in the Morning but through this Correspon∣dence I shall not prophane my favourite Sub∣ject by introducing it with the dry one your Curiosity has led me to  As ST DISDIER is my favourite Writer on the State of  Venice  I shall begin with his Account of the Origin of this City but must first endeavour to make you acquainted with the  Lagunes  or Lakes which I look upon to be the great Sources of Health and Plea∣sure to the  Venetians  as well as the Means  by which all their Wants are supplied nothing can be more delicious than the Airings the Nobility take on these Lakes during the Sum∣mer Season sometimes attended with a Barge filled with Musicians and often  têteàtête  with their  Cicisbeo  in a Gondola which is an easy and luxurious Conveyance The  Lagunes  are formed by a strong Bank of Sand at the En∣trance of the Gulph which extends from South to West about thirtysix Miles and is about six Hundred Feet in Breadth the Sea ha∣ving broke through the Bank in six different Places has covered with Water all the low Land for seven or eight Miles leaving a Num∣ber of small Islands upon which are built the Towns of the  Lagunes  The six Passages above∣mentioned are the only Ports by which Ves∣sels can approach to  Venice  First that of  Brondolo  to the South secondly  Chiosa  an episcopal City thirdly  Malamocco  fourthly  Lido  opposite to the East Point of  Venice  fifthly  St Erasmus  and sixthly the three Ports by this last only the small fishing Barks can pass  In the Year the  Goths  under the Com∣mand of RADAGAISUS having broke like a Torrent into  Italy  put all the Inhabitants to the Sword who attempted to oppose their Fury the People who were situated near the  Lagunes  I have above described found no Asylum so secure as those maritime Isles the most Part of which were only inhabited by Fishermen here the Fugitives remained in Safety until the Ge∣nerals sent by the Emperor HONORIUS having defeated the Barbarians left the affrighted Wan∣derers at Liberty to return to the  Terra Firma  In the Year the horrible Ravages com∣mitted by the  Visigoths  under ALARICK made the same People a second Time seek their for∣mer Retreat and as these Invaders staid longer in  Italy  than those led by RADAGAISUS the Fugitives began to build themselves comforta∣ble Habitations on these Islands The  Paduans  to whom these Isles belonged had a Port at that of  Rialto  now called  Venice  and the Senate having resolved to make it a conside∣rable Place not only by Way of Asylum for their Subjects but also to secure their Trade by Sea sent in the Year three Consuls who proclaimed it a free Port so that in a  short Time it was peopled not only by those who retired to the Islands for Safety but by many Persons of all Ranks who left the  Terra Firma  to settle there The third Undertaking of the Barbarians under ATTILA King of the  Huns  threatened  Italy  with total Desolation that Scourge of the  Almighty  as he was justly denominated having caused  Germany France  and  Italy  to be laid Waste returned in the Year a second Time into the lastnamed Country and destroyed  Pavia Milan Padua Aquilea  and many other great Towns the miserable Remains of whose Inhabitants finish∣ed the Peopling not only of  Rialto  but all the other Isles of the  Lagunes  and entertain∣ing no Hope of returning to their ruined Ci∣ties they caused to be transported from the  Terra Firma  Marble and other Materials of their demolished Palaces so that in the Space of about fifty Years not only the People of Rank but even the Artizans were conve∣niently lodged  Padua  being at length reesta∣blished and seeing  Rialto  become considerable by the Number of its Inhabitants the Senate thought proper to send Consuls to govern the People with some Appearance of Authority  but in Time the richest and most powerful of the Inhabitants of these Isles got themselves declared Protectors of the People with the Title of Tribunes In the Year the Tri∣bunes of the twelve most considerable Islands of the  Lagunes  judging it necessary to have a better Form of Government resolved to com∣pose a Republic and to elect a proper Person from among themselves to be their Chief or Prince but as they knew they had no Right to take this Step against the Will of the  Pa∣duans  to whom they were indebted for the Place of their Residence they sent an Ambas∣sy to the Emperor LEO who was Sovereign of the whole Country and to Pope JOHN the Fifth to obtain their Permission to elect a Prince to whom they gave the Title of Doge PAOLO LUCE ANAFESTE the first Duke of  Venice  was elected Years after  Rialto  was proclaimed a free Port by the  Paduans  This Election was made at  Ereclea  a Town of the  Lagunes  in the Year at this Place the first three Doges resided These Princes ruled with absolute Power till when upon the Election of SEBASTIAN ZIANI the Form of Government became democratical and  continued so till when the Doge PIETRO GRADENIGO found Means to change it to an Aristocracy this he effected by getting a De∣cree passed in the  Quarantia Criminale  that all those who had composed the great Council for four Years should be ballotted for in that Chamber of Justice and such of them who had twelve Balls in their Favour and who attended the Council on a certain Day at an appointed Hour should have their Names written in a Book called  Il Libro d'Oro  and that they and their Descendants should form the great Council forever As this Intrigue was managed with much Secrecy none had Notice to attend but those whom the Doge and his Party approved of or who had Friends in the  Quarantia  When this chosen Number were assembled at the Ringing of a Bell the Doors were locked and no more suffered to enter This the  Venetians  call  "  Il Serrar del Cansiglio  "  and is one of the most remark∣able Epochas of their Government though this Step wrested all Share of the Administra∣tion out of the Hands of the Citizens and unjustly deprived some Families of their Ti∣tle to Nobility yet it was owing to this Event  that the Republic established a more perfect Form of Government than she before enjoyed and which continues with very little Change to this Day BAYAMONTE TIEPOLI the Head of one of the most antient Families of the Republic joined the  Quirini  and some other illustrious Persons in a Conspiracy to sacrifice the Doge to their Resentment for this Innova∣tion but all the Conspirators perished in the Enterprise and this Attempt only occasioned fresh Regulations which more securely establish∣ed the new Form of Government  Accept of thus much by Way of Intro∣duction to a Sketch of the present State of the Republic of  Venice  and in my next I shall have the Honour to introduce you to SUA SERENITA the Doge but at present the Post will only allow me Time to assure you how sincerely I am  Yours  c c  LETTER LX Miss N to Mr HULL  April    I Promised in my last to introduce you to the Doge of  Venice  and I think you will agree with me that his Serenity is a very uncomfortable Being Since the Period of  Il Serrar del Consiglio  his Power has gra∣dually decreased A Procurator of St  Mark  is generally elected Prince who has ser∣ved the Republic in expensive Embassies or in the first Offices of the State Although he has the Name of Sovereign the Power remains with the Senate and having little Influence in the Affairs of the State great Wisdom is by no Means an essential Recom∣mendation to this high Rank an advanced Age an easy Disposition and illustrious Birth are the Qualifications chiefly sought for in the Doge his Children GrandChildren and Bro∣thers are disqualified from holding any consi∣derable  Employment connected with Govern∣ment during his Reign His Wife was for∣merly treated  en Princesse  and crowned with great Magnificence but that custom is now exploded however she still retains the Title of  Dogeressa  Though the Doge presides at all the Councils he is only acknowledged Head of the Senate at the Tribunals and in the Palace of St  Mark  He cannot leave the City without the previous Leave of his Coun∣sellors he is allowed no Marks of Distinction in his Dress or Equipage when he makes pri∣vate Visits or leaves the City except that his Family are suffered to use Gold or Silver Lace on their Liveries and in the Ornaments of their Box at the Theatre and the Ladies wear rich coloured Cloaths at public Festivals when the  Pragmatica  obliges the other noble  Venetians  to appear in black Upon public Occasions his Serenity generally wears a Vest and Ducal Mantle of Brocade of Gold or Silver lined with Ermine a Cap of Crimson Velvet with a Border of Gold to represent the Diadem and under it a short Hood of Gauze and Shoes of Crimson Damask The Sword of State is carried after the Prince and  at the Head of the Seignory to shew where the real Power is lodged A folding Chair with a gilt Frame and a Seat of Brocade with a Stool of the same to set his Foot on and a large Parisole of Gold Stuff are car∣ried with the Doge in all public Processions and they pretend that this Regalia was pre∣sented to the famous SEBASTIAN ZIANI by Pope ALEXANDER the Third in acknowledg∣ment of the Protection he received from the Republic when oppressed by the Emperor FREDERICK the Second The Doge has the Title of Serenity and Serene Prince but to shew that they are not attached to his Person alone Ambassadors use them in his Absence in addressing the College Though all Dis∣patches are written in the Name of the Prince and the Answers addressed to him yet he can∣not open them without the Members of the Col∣lege being present whereas they can open and even answer them without his being present and to shew that his Power and Influence is merely imaginary the Senate neither propose any Ques∣tion or take any Resolution till he and his Counsellors are withdrawn they then examine the Affairs under Debate take the Advice of  the Savi and prepare their Deliberations in Writing to be carried to the first Meeting of the Senate where the Doge and his Coun∣sellors are present who have a Voice to ap∣prove or disapprove in common with the other Senators The  Venetian  Money bears the Name of the Doge and was formerly stamped as his Coin when the Power of the Prince was absolute at present is substituted the Figure of a Man in the Ducal Habit on his Knees before St  Mark  to shew that the Doge is subject to the Republic of which St  Mark  is the Hieroglyphic The Income of the Prince is fourteen thousand Ducats  per Annum  which amounts to about two thousand Pounds ster∣ling to maintain his Family and to defray the Expence of treating the Seignory four Times a Year The foreign Ambassadors who have made their public Entry have a Right to be at these Feasts The Republic pay all the Officers who attend the Prince on public Occasions he has the Power of selling the dif∣ferent Employments of the Palace in which and collating the Benefices of St  Mark  con∣sist the principal Emoluments of his Dignity  When the Doge dies his Body is embalmed and exposed for three Days on a Bed of State in an Apartment of the Palace destined for that Purpose This Exposition is not only to give the People an Opportunity to pay the last Honours to their Prince but also to give the Senate Time to receive any Complaints against his Administration and to give his Creditors Leisure to make their Demands on his Heirs which if they refuse to satisfy he is deprived of funeral Honours at the Ex∣pence of the Republic for this Reason on the Death of a Doge three Inquisitors are appointed to search into his past Conduct to hear all Complaints and to satisfy all Demands at the Expence of the Succession The No∣bles who assist at the Funeral are dressed in Scarlet Robes to shew that it is not the Go∣vernment of the Prince that causes the Hap∣piness of the State and that the Republic being free ought not to shew any Marks of Affliction at his Death The Obsequies are no sooner over than all the Nobles who are more than thirty Years of Age assemble in the great CouncilChamber and elect five Cor∣rectors  who inspect the Book of Statutes that the Doge on his Election swears to observe These five Noblemen have a Right to add to or to retrench from these Statutes what∣ever they think necessary for the Good of the State The Ballotation upon this Occasion is managed with so much Caution that it is im∣possible for any Thing but Chance to decide which shall be the fortyone Senators chose out of the whole Number to elect a Successor to the deceased Prince When these Electors have been approved by the general Council they are shut up in the Palace of St  Mark  and not suffered to stir out until the Election is over twentyfive of the fortyone Voices must be in Favour of the Person that is chosen The first Thing required of the Doge is to swear to the Observance of the Book of Sta∣tutes He then shews himself to the People and in going out of the Palace for that Pur∣pose passes through the Chamber in which his Body is to be exposed after his Death and  there  he receives from the Grand Chancellor the first Compliments on his new Dignity He then gets into a Machine not unlike a great Tub and two hundred Men who belong to  the Arsenal carry him by Turns round the Place of St  Mark  on their Shoulders The Doge thus seated one of his Children or some near Relation stands behind him holding two Basons filled with Money which he distributes among the Populace  Having killed one Prince and proclaimed another I think I may decently take my Leave for the present and should you be as tired with reading as I am with writing you will wish you had never heard of his Serenity I hope you will think my next more interesting which will treat of the different Councils of  Venice  Addio  sempre suo c  LETTER LXI Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  April    HAVING in my last dispatched his Sere∣nity the Doge I now proceed with Ala∣crity to give you an Account of the Coun∣cils of which according to AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAIE there are three principal the great one which comprehends all the Nobility the College which gives Audience to Am∣bassadors and the Pregadi which is the Se∣nate The GreatCouncil meets every  Sunday  and Holiday to chuse Magistrates which is done by Ballotation The Nobles have no Right to enter into it until they are twentyfive Years old but the Seignory dispense some∣times with their being under Age This As∣sembly has a Right of confirming or annulling the Decrees of the Senate and to make or repeal Laws The most remarkable standing Laws are these  viz  that all Ecclesiastics are  excluded from every civil Employment and public Assembly The Nobles cannot arrive at the principal Offices but by Gradation nor can they hold more than one Office at once be it ever so small Those who refuse any Employment are fined two thousand Du∣cats and banished for two Years from the Great Council and Broglio this Name they give to an Apartment under the  Procuratia Nuova  where the Noblemen meet in a Mor∣ning and those who are trying to attain any Place in the Government use this Opportu∣nity to solicit the Votes of their Friends for their Ballotation in the Great Council No Magistrate can resign or leave the City All the Sons of the Nobility have equal Portions if a Daughter has more than five thousand Ducats about six hundred Pounds sterling she receives the Income of the Overplus for her own separate Use and if she dies without Chil∣dren it returns to her Family All Subjects of the Republic the Doge not excepted pay Taxes in Proportion to their Fortune The Magistrates in civil Causes can receive no Vi∣sits or Recommendation of the Parties but may in criminal ones if they are not State  Affairs No Nobleman can enter into Trade The Great Council corrects all public Errors and redresses all Grievances imposed by those who use their Authority unlawfully so that this may be called the first Tribunal and the Basis as well as Support of the Republic  To gratify the young Nobility they admit thirty by Lot every Year into the Great Coun∣cil who are only twenty Years of Age and allow them the same Privileges as those who are twentyfive these young ones are called  Barbarini  because they are chosen on the Day of St BARBARA This Assembly sits from eight in the Morning until Noon it is held in the largest Room of the Palace at the upper End are raised Seats on which the Doge and his Counsellors are placed The Chief of the Council of Ten the Avoga∣dores and the Censors are seated round the Hall upon raised Benches The Counsellors of the Doge can convoke at Pleasure the Great Council and for this Purpose they cause the Bells of the principal Churches in the six Quar∣ters of the Town to be rung and at this Sig∣nal the Nobles attend the Council without  Arms which they are forbid to carry there on Pain of Death  When AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAIE wrote his History of the Republic of  Venice  the No∣bles were computed at five and twenty Hun∣dred but they now fall very short of that Calculation The Great Council usually con∣sists of about eight hundred and nearly the same Number is supposed to be employed in the Provinces on Embassies and other public Services or for private Reasons are not in a Situation to attend in Council  THE COLLEGE  THE College is formed of twentysix Mem∣bers  viz  The Doge and his six Counsellors three of the  Quarantia Criminale  who are changed every two Months six  Savi Grandi  five of the  Savi  of the  Terra Firma  and the five  Savi  of Order The College has the Right of assembling the Senate and propo∣sing what is to be debated therein but yet they must obey its Resolutions and act in  Concert with it At this Tribunal the Maje∣sty of the Prince may be said to reside for here the Ambassadors have their Audience all Letters upon foreign Affairs are read all Me∣morials are presented and all Privileges in Regard to Benefices Prelates  c c  are pleaded In short this is the Committee of Ways and Means where all Business is first planned in order to be laid before the Senate for their Concurrence  THE SENATE  THE Senate had formerly the Name of  Pregadi  given to it because it then never as∣sembled but upon extraordinary Occasions and the Magistrates were obliged to request the Attendance of the principal Citizens when any important Affair required their Advice This Assembly now meets every  Wednesday  and  Fri∣day  and upon an Emergency the  Savi  for the Week can call an extraordinary  Pregadi  This Tribunal possesses all the Authority of the Republic for here all Resolutions con∣cerning Peace and War are taken all Leagues  and Alliances are made Ambassadors and also Officers who have considerable Rank in the Army are nominated and all Taxes are imposed according to the Exigency of Affairs The Consultations of the College are here examin∣ed and determined by a Plurality of Voices This Institution in its Commencement was only composed of sixty Senators called an  ordinary Pregadi  but being often obliged in Cases of Importance to add to the Number sixty more were created called the  Junto  these hundred and twenty Senators are always No∣blemen of advanced Age and approved Merit The Members of the College the Council of Ten the  Quarantia Criminale  the Procurators of St  Mark  with most Part of the Magi∣strates enter also into the  Pregadi  so that it now consists of near three hundred Members one Part whereof have a Right to vote the rest can only hearken and learn the Rules of Government The Doge and his Counsellors are the only Persons whose Advice can be bal∣lotted to prevent the Confusion that would probably arise from a Diversity of Opinions as half the Votes must be in Favour of the Ques∣tion before it can pass Those who have no  Right to vote may harangue and contradict the Opinions proposed The hundred and twenty who compose the ordinary  Pregadi  and  Junto  are ballotted every Year in the Great Council to be changed or continued as shall be de∣termined in the said Council The Senate is particularly attentive in maintaining Harmony among the Nobles well knowing that a con∣trary Behaviour might be productive of fatal Consequences to the Liberty of the Country as was formerly the Case with  Florence  and  Verona  The COUNSELLORS of the DOGE  THE Counsellors of the Doge or more pro∣perly of the Signory are six in Number they are chosen from amongst the oldest Senators of the first Rank though they are Counsel∣lors for a Year they only assist in the Col∣lege eight Months the other four Months they preside in the  Quarantia Criminale  in the same Manner as the Chiefs of that Chamber have places in the College during two Months These six Counsellors have more Power than the Doge  their Employment is twofold first they are obliged to consult with the Doge upon all Matters that are to be proposed in the Coun∣cils to open all Letters directed to the Sig∣nory to receive Petitions and to appoint Judges to settle any Dispute which may arise about Jurisdiction and secondly to preside at all Councils and during an  Interregnum  to dis∣patch Orders to all the Officers of the State When the Doge is ill the most antient of the Counsellors represent him in the College and at all public Functions but he is nei∣ther allowed to sit in the ducal Chair or wear the Habit of the Prince and is only distinguished by a Cap which he never takes off no more than the Doge does his ducal Crown The Counsellors whilst in Office wear scarlet Gowns  As I shall in my next introduce you to a Tribunal so awful that the bare Name makes thousands tremble I shall allow myself some Respite for the present and endeavour to lose the Idea of these dry intricate Subjects in the more pleasing ones of  Virtù  You will excuse my breaking off thus when I tell you that my Gondola now waits to carry me to a  dilletanti  Party with whom I am going to examine the famous Marriage of PAOLO VERONESE at the Convent of St  George  It so rarely happens that our Plea∣sures in the Enjoyment equal the Vivacity of our Expectation I almost fear I promise myself too much on this Occasion but if this celebrated Piece deserves half the Encomiums that are bestowed upon it my Delight will be exqui∣site I heartily wish you could be a Partaker of it  Farewel  LETTER LXII Miss N to Mr HULL  April    I Promised in my last to introduce you to the most tremendous Tribunal that per∣haps ever poor Culprits trembled before if we view it in its original State but I think all the sensible People I have conversed with in  Venice  agree that it is somewhat relaxed from its primitive Severity though still to be dreaded for the Extent of Power the Inqui∣sitors of State are entrusted with  The INQUISITION  THIS Tribunal is composed of two of the Council of Ten and one of the Counsellors of the Doge As the Affairs that fall under the Cognizance thereof are of the utmost Conse∣quence to the State depending chiefly upon cer∣tain Intelligences collected by Spies so all their Proceedings are managed with the deepest Se∣crecy and in some Cases they are obliged  to use Severity and to punish Offenders in a very exemplary Manner The Life of the Doge the Nobles and all the Subjects of the State lie at the Mercy of this Tribunal pro∣vided the three Inquisitors entirely concur in Opinion and in this Case they are not obliged to give an Account of their Actions to any one or even communicate them to the Coun∣cil of Ten The Execution of the Sentences pronounced by these Judges is not less se∣cret than their Judgments except when the Crime is of a public Nature in private Cases to prevent Exclamations against such seeming Severity as often punishes with Death an un∣guarded Expression against so rigorous a Go∣vernment it is said they send in the Night and have the Offender seized and pronounce his Doom without any other Ceremony than confronting him with two Witnesses if there are any or else on the bare Report of Spies As many Inconveniencies have arisen from this despotic Method of Proceeding a Law has been provided that the Inquisitors shall not put to Death a noble Venetian without first hearing his Defence If a Stranger of any Consequence becomes suspected by this Tri∣bunal  he must expect to lose his Papers and receive an Order signed by one of the Inqui∣sitors requiring him to leave the State within a limited Time on Pain of Death As the  Venetian  Nobility of every Class are forbid to hold any Sort of Correspondence with Am∣bassadors or foreign Ministers or even with the meanest Person in their Families it is for this Intent that the Spies of the Inquisitors are particularly vigilant in collecting Matter of Complaint  Harsh as the Proceedings of this Tribunal must appear to  Englishmen  who are blessed with the happiest Form of Government the sensible and unprejudiced MONTESQUIEU as∣serts that it has often saved the Republic of  Venice  from total Destruction  The COUNCIL OF TEN  THIS was orignally a mere temporary Cham∣ber of Justice appointed to enquire into the famous Conspiracy of TIEPOLI but was soon after made perpetual and is now one of the  most respectable Tribunals of the Republic it takes Cognizance of all the criminal Affairs among the Nobility that happen in the City or State of  Venice  and judges Crimes of  Leze Majesté  and all other attrocious Offences This Council has the Care of the public Tranqui∣lity and their Power is as much to be dreaded by the Nobles as by the common People The Doge and his Counsellors have a Right to enter this Chamber of Justice but the ten Senators of whom it is composed have not less Power in the Absence of the Doge than when he is present they are chosen out of diffe∣rent Families and are elected in the Great Coun∣cil every Year they then elect three among themselves to be the Head of the Councils these rule Week about and are changed every three Months The Chief in Office receives all Informations from Spies and reports them to his Colleagues who upon the Deposition of Witnesses and the Answers of the accused proceed against them before the Council where the Offender is not allowed to plead for him∣self personally or by Lawyer The armed Galley that always lies at St  Mark  's Place and some Cannon and Gallies at the Arsenal  are under the Command of the Council of Ten They meet only once a Week unless some Affair of Importance calls them oftener together  The  QUARANTIA CRIMINALE  THERE are three Courts of Justice that con∣sist each of forty Judges the first of these is the most antient Tribunal of the Republic but it has suffered a great Diminution of Power by the Establishment of the Council of Ten The forty Judges of the upper Chamber have a Right to vote in the Senate and the three Chiefs who are Presidents have likewise Seats in the College during the two last Months they are in Office and three of the Counsellors of the Doge preside in the  Quarantia Criminale  the four last Months of their Year to shew the Connexion there is between this Chamber and the College This Office is generally filled by Noblemen who are not rich they receive thirty Ducats  per  Month by it and acquire Consi∣deration among the Nobility To arrive at this Chamber they must pass through the  other  Quarantias  first which are much infe∣rior in Authority Besides these there are many other lower Courts of Justice that take Cognizance of mercantile Affairs Bankrupt∣cies  c c  It is worthy of Observation in this wise and intricate Government how all the superior Tribunals are interwoven with and if I may use the Expression germinate from each other  SAVI GRANDI  THESE Magistrates are six in Number they are chosen from among the wisest of the Senators and during the Time they are in office manage all political Affairs of Impor∣tance and are properly speaking prime Mi∣nisters they are elected by the Senate and changed every six Months three at a Time by which Means there remain three old Se∣nators in Office who are able to inform the new elected ones of what happened during their Administration and serves as a model for the future Conduct of the new Ministers  SAVI  of the  TERRA FIRMA  THESE five Officers of the State have little less Authority in the College than the  Savi Grandi  they are the same Length of Time in Office are chosen of a less advanced Age and are preferred according to their Applica∣tion and the Abilities they have shewn in the Offices they must necessarily have passed through to arrive at this The first or  Savi Cashier  is PayMaster the second  Savi degli Scritura  Se∣cretary at War and the third  Savi  of the Or∣dinance has the Direction of the Military of the  Terra Firma  the other two are only to assist the three first They are elected by the Senate as the  Savi Grandi  and have a Right to vote on every Motion which may be pro∣posed by them but to preserve a Subordina∣tion between the two Offices have no Right to vote in the Senate  SAVI  of ORDER  THIS Magistracy is the same in Number as the  Savi  of the  Terra Firma  but is with∣out  Jurisdiction and is only a School as it were wherein the young Nobility may learn the Art of Government These Noblemen during the six Months they are in Office assist at all the Consultations of the College and conse∣quently have a Share in the Secrets of State they have no Right to vote either in the Col∣lege or Senate but may give their Opinion at the Consultations of the  Savi  always speak∣ing uncovered and standing They are allowed to see all the Dispatches that are sent to Am∣bassadors and the Registers of the Affairs of State This Employment is looked upon by the Republic as the Touchstone of the Cha∣racter and Genius of their young Nobility  PROCURATORS of ST  MARK  THIS Honour is generally bestowed on such of the Nobility who have been of essential Ser∣vice to their Country in expensive Embassies in a naval Command or for having gone through the most important Employments of the State with Honour and Integrity The Procurators take Place of all the other Nobi∣lity  they have the Disposal of all pious Le∣gacies are the Guardians of Orphans and Protectors of Widows The Number was for∣merly confined to nine but is now encreased to eleven In pressing Necessities of the Re∣public this Dignity has been sold for immense Sums but except in Cases of public Distress it can only be disposed of by Merit and those who purchase it never have any Succes∣sors appointed when they die Their Dress is a purple Robe The magnificent Buildings on each Side of St  Mark  's Place were ori∣ginally destined for the Habitation of the Pro∣curators and from thence called  Procuratias  but they are now chiefly rented to Strangers and foreign Ministers by Way of  Casinos  The GRAND CHANCELLOR  THIS Dignity can only be enjoyed by a Person of the Rank of Citizen he takes Place of all the other Magistrates and wears a pur∣ple Robe like the Procurators of St  Mark  All the Councils are open to him he holds the Seal of the Republic and assists at read∣ing  and answering the Dispatches from Am∣bassadors and every Thing else material that is treated of in the Senate He has the Ti∣tle of  Excellenza  and is the Head of the Peo∣ple as the Doge is of the Nobility His In∣come is about nine thousand Ducats  per An∣num  He is buried with great Pomp at the Expence of the Republic  The  AVOGADORES  THIS Office resembles in Part that of AttorneyGeneral in  England  but is divided among three People the greatest Instance of its Power is being able for the Space of three Days to suspend the Judgment of all the other Courts of Justice when the Crime is not clearly proved upon the Culprit In this Particular the  Avogador  resembles the  Ro∣man  Tribunes of the People They are elected by the Senate but the Choice must be con∣firmed by the Grand Council where all Pro∣ceedings would be null if one of the  Avo∣gadores  did not assist Their Dress when in Office is a purple Robe  The TWO CENSORS  THE Jurisdiction of the Censors extends principally to the Manners of particular Per∣sons to the Intrigues of the Nobles in the  Broglio  to the Condemnation and Fining of those who violate the Statutes of the Great Council to the Payment of Wages Pilfering of Servants and Correction of  Gondaliers  They are sixteen Months in Office during which Term they have a Right to vote in the  Pre∣gadi  and wear purple Gowns  I have extended this beyond the common Bounds of a Letter and find that by so doing I have lost Half an Hour of an agreeable Conversation where I am engaged this Even∣ing so shall only add that I am sincerely  Yours  c  P S I am obliged to one of my  Gonda∣liers  a clever intelligent Fellow for remind∣ing me that it is past the Hour of my En∣gagement  and here let me do Justice to this numerous Body of People by saying they are one of the most respectable Societies I have any where heard of for their Honesty and Fi∣delity to the Master they engage themselves to  LETTER LXIII Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  April    WITH your Leave my good Friend I am going to engage you in a little Trip to the  Terra Firma  in Order to intro∣duce you to the  Podestàs  and  Capitanios  a Set of Gentlemen of no small Consequence I as∣sure you in their respective Governments  To the greater Towns of the  Terra Firma  the Senate send two Noblemen with the Ti∣tles of  Podestà  and  Capitanio  these equally re∣present the Republic the first in the Admi∣nistration  of civil Justice the second in the Command of Military Affairs The  Podestà  is the principal Person as he takes Cognizance of all that regards the Police and the good Order of the People The  Capitanio  besides the Command of the Troops has Power to punish the Inhabitants for any Crime com∣mitted in the Streets during the Course of the Night He has also the Care of the public Money which is collected by Receivers who are accountable to him for it The  Podestàs  and  Capitanios  are obliged to report to the Senate every Measure they take To the Ca∣pitals of Provinces are generally sent both the abovementioned Officers but in Towns of small Importance the two Offices are united in the Person of the  Podestà  who holds his Employment sixteen Months The Appoint∣ments allowed them by the Republic are very small in Comparison to what they are obli∣ged to spend in the Capitals therefore to them the Senate generally sends rich Noblemen and poor ones to the small Towns where not being obliged to make an expensive Appear∣ance they may if they please gain a com∣fortable  Subsistence by their Post during the Time they are employed in it  A Nobleman of the first Rank is always sent into the  Frioul  with the Title of  Provedi∣toreGeneral  of  Palma Nova  this Place is of great Consequence to the  Venetians  as it serves for a Frontier to the Emperor's Dominions and is a strong Barrier against the Incursions of the  Turks  At  Udeney  where the Patriarch of  Aqui∣lia  resides the Republic employs only a Lieu∣tenant and some Subalterns In  Istria  are four episcopal Towns with five others not so con∣siderable each of them governed by a  Podestà  The CommandingOfficers of these Places as well as those of the  Levant  and  Dalmatia  are changed only once in two Years The Senate gives the Title of Counts Governors and Captains to the Noblemen who are sent into  Dalmatia  to administer Justice The Ma∣gistrates of the principal Towns for Exam∣ple the Counts of  Spalatro  and  Gara  who are likewise Archbishops have appointed to them a Council of three noble  Venetians  with∣out whom they cannot determine on any Thing but all these Officers are subject to the  Prove∣ditoreGeneral  who has full Authority in all Affairs civil and military The Isles of  Cor∣fuzant  and  Cephalonia  are each governed by a  Proveditore  assisted by a Council of three noble  Venetians Corfu  is a Place of great Importance as it commands the Entrance of the Gulph and is the Repository of the  Ve∣netian  Merchandize brought from the  Levant  this Place is regarded by the  Turks  with a jealous Eye There is also a General of these three Isles to whom the particular  Proveditores  render Obedience as the Magistrates of the Towns in  Dalmatia  do to the  ProveditoreGe∣neral  INQUISITORS of the  TERRA FIRMA  EVERY five Years Inquisitors are sent to hold Courts in the several Provinces of the  Terra Firma  their Business is to inspect into the Conduct of  Podestàs  and  Capitanios  and to receive all Complaints of Maladministra∣tion of Justice Their Censures are seldom severe but when there are Proofs of Embez∣zlement of the public Money and in that  Case their Office obliges them to act with the utmost Rigour They are attended by a Com∣pany of Cavalry and an Executioner that they may punish on the Spot all Offences that are clearly proved This gives the Provin∣cials a very high Idea of the Justice of the  Venetian  Government  The MAGISTRATES of POMP  Gli Sopre Proveditore alle Pompe  are Sena∣tors who by strict Ordinances suppress all out∣ward Marks of Luxury and preserve an exact Equality in the exterior Appearance of the Nobility At public Feasts the Dress of the Ladies is always black except on some Oc∣casions when they are allowed to wear a rich gold or silver Stuff Petticoat with their black Gowns The noble  Venetians  are not suffered to use gold or silver Lace on their Boatmen's Liveries or in their Boxes at the Theatres except the Doge's Family and the Grand Chan∣cellor's In MaskingTime the Ladies may wear rich coloured Cloaths which is about six Months in the Year and when they are  at their Estates on the  Terra Firma  they may give as rich Liveries as they choose but the Servants who wear them never attend them at  Venice  but in their own Houses  REVENUES and EXPENCES of the STATE  THE settled Revenue of the Republic is supposed at present according to the best Cal∣culation to amount to about a Million and a Half sterling  per Annum  this is raised by Imports and Exports and Taxes upon all the Provisions consumed in the City of  Ve∣nice  and upon all Sorts of Merchandizes and by other Duties raised in the Isles of the  La∣gunes  and upon all the Estates situated near  Venice  called the  Dogado  or Dutchy Another Part of the Revenue is raised in the same Manner from the Towns and Provinces of the  Terra Firma  and also from  Istria Dalma∣tia  and the Isles of  Corfu Zant  and  Cepha∣lonia  A large Portion likewise arises from the Salt made at  Corfu  and  Chiosa  and to this may be added twenty thousand Ducats  per  Month that are paid into the Coffers of the Republic from a Lottery on the same Plan as those of  Rome  and  Naples  which has been established within these thirty Years In Time of War the Senate finds great Resources by ennobling rich Families making supernumerary Procurators of St  Mark  by renewing old Taxes and imposing new ones The yearly Expences of Government do not require above half the Income of the State so that in Time of Peace the Republic can lay up vast Sums by which Means the  Venetians  are enabled to negotiate all their Affairs with foreign Powers by the Force of Money instead of Arms  The FORCES of the REPUBLIC  IN Time of Peace the  Venetians  are sup∣posed to pay about twentyfive thousand Men but there is strong Reason to believe that not above one third of them are effective owing to the Abuses of the  Proveditores  in  Dalmatia  The Infantry are chiefly  Sclavonians Morlaques  and  Albanians  they are esteemed brave Soldiers and are firmly attached to the  Venetians  from an inveterate Hatred to the  Turks  who are their natural Enemies The Cavalry are partly composed of the same Na∣tions and partly of  Ultramontanes  The Ge∣neral in Chief must always be a Foreigner and his Power is so overruled by the  Pro∣veditoreGeneral  that he has only the Name of Commander of the Forces The chief At∣tention of the Senate is paid to the Marine They have no regular naval Force in Time of Peace but upon an Emergency can arm thirty Galleys able to act against their Ene∣mies in a very expeditious Manner They always keep some Galleys in the  Levant  with other Vessels to guard the Provinces situated near the Sea these are under the Command of the  ProveditoreGeneral  A Squadron of six Gal∣leys and several other Vessels are likewise em∣ployed to cruize about the Mouth of the Gulph to secure the Traders from the Corsairs and to make the Merchants pay their proper Du∣ties The Nobleman who commands this Squa∣dron has the Title of General of the Gulph his Command continues for three Years The Republic in Peace as well as in War creates a  Proveditore General  who commands both the  Fleet and Army he has an absolute Power to punish with Death all Officers Soldiers and Sailors and to dispose of all Posts in the Army and Navy he resides at  Corfu  the first three Years he is in Office and when that Time is expired he is obliged to render an Account of his Administration to the Senate  SPIES and INFORMERS  SPIES have ever been looked upon as in∣famous Ministers of Tyranny but the Senate of  Venice  have found Means to conceal the Shame of such Miscreants by making Mouths of Stone speak for them for in many Parts of the Palace of St  Mark  and in all the Parts of the City near the public Tribunals Heads are cut in the Walls with gaping Mouths into which they cast the Notes of Information If the Informer has no Scruple to declare him∣self he goes in Person to receive the Reward allowed by Law on this Occasion if he does not choose to be known he sends a Friend with a Piece of Paper that has been torn from that on which the Information was written  and the Money is paid without any other For∣mality than comparing the two Pieces of Pa∣per together As the great Maxim of the  Ve∣netians  is that the Safety of the State depends upon their having exact Intelligence of every Thing that passes especially in the Families of Ambassadors and foreign Ministers it is in∣credible what a Number of Spies of all Ranks they keep in constant Pay That the  Vene∣tians  are often branded with the ridiculous Epithet of Pantaloons for this apparent My∣steriousness in their System of Politics we very well know but how far they are right or wrong in it I leave to better Judgments than mine to determine this however we must allow that their Government has subsisted under a re∣publican Form without any material Alteration for a much longer Period of Time than any other Republic that History furnishes us with an Account of at least that I can recollect I had a great Curiosity when I came to  Ve∣nice  to learn the Etymology of the Name of  Pantaloon  and why it is so particularly applied to the  Venetians  I am told it comes from  Pianta Leone  and was first appropriated to them for their great Eagerness to plant the  Standard of  Venice  which you know is a Lion wherever they could by Force or Fraud ob∣tain a Bit of Ground large enough to con∣tain it How far this etymological Account of honest  Pantaloon  may satisfy you I know not but remember I do not vouch for the Reality of it I only offer it to you as I have received it I propose by the next Post to send you a succinct Account of the Me∣thod of proceeding at  Venice  in criminal Cases and am in the mean Time  faithfully yours  c  LETTER LXIV Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  May    AN agreeable Excursion for a few Days into the Country has prevented my being so punctual in my literary Engagement as I have hitherto been but I make no Aplogy  for I know you never meant it should interfere with my Amusements Now to proceed with my historical Anecdotes  PROCEEDINGS in CRIMINAL CASES at  VENICE  WHEN a Crime is supposed to have been committed at  Venice  the Courts of Justice are more solicitous to be ascertained of the Fact than to secure the Offender and when they have obtained the necessary Proofs they send an Officer to enter publicly the House of the Criminal and on the Report of this Officer that he is not be found which is generally the Case they summon him to ap∣pear in a longer or shorter Space of Time according to the Enormity of the Crime com∣mitted to answer for the Offence and till that Period is elapsed the Offender is safe from any Molestation provided he does not appear on the Place of St  Mark  or on the  Rialto  and he may also demand three De∣lays and if he thinks he cannot find Means to prevent the Affair coming to a fatal Issue  he may avoid a Trial by getting a Noble∣man's Boat to convey him to some Part of the  Terra Firma  from whence he may easily escape out of the State Hence it proceeds that most Criminals at  Venice  are judged by Contumacy which they call  Bandire  but this Judgment is always accompanied with Condi∣tions proportionable to the Crime for exam∣ple that the condemned Person shall never be able to purchase his Pardon that whoever kills him in the  Venetian  State shall receive a considerable Reward and double the Sum if they kill him in any other Territory If the Crime sensibly touches the Republic they add to the Reward the Liberty of delivering a StatePrisoner but notwithstanding this ap∣parent great Rigour there have been Instances of Noblemen who have been guilty of atro∣cious Crimes making their Peace by Means of great Interest When the Criminal is se∣cured and the Process formed the  Avogador  names his own Day and conducting the Cul∣prit before his Judges pleads strongly against him exaggerates every Particular of his Crime and concludes with advising a severe Punish∣ment The Advocate of the Party accused  answers all the chief Points of the Accusa∣tion and when he has performed his Part the Auditors retire and the Opinion of the  Avogador  is balloted against that of the Chiefs of the  Quarantia  which is always the most gentle and the Plurality of Balls determine the Fate of the Offender By this Means the Judges decide without giving the Reason of their Opinion and it is consequently un∣known who is for and who is against the Criminal The Lawyers are obliged to plead in the  Venetian  Dialect that the most ignorant Auditor may understand what passes as well as the more learned Part of the Assembly The severest Hardship in the Course of Jus∣tice at  Venice  is the Length of Time it takes to terminate an Affair owing to the Courts of Justice being so closely connected and if I may be allowed the Expression playing into each others Hands so that a poor Wretch is often suffered to lie in Gaol for two or three Years before he can obtain an hearing to expiate as they pretend by this Punishment part of his Crime The frequent Sentences that are passed upon Criminals condemning them to an horrid obscure Prison for eight or  ten Years and often for Life where in Win∣ter they suffer all the Rigour of extreme Cold and in Summer of excessive Heat are certainly more cruel Punishments than Death at once  Now in my usual abrupt Manner I shall conduct you at one Step from temporal to spiritual Affairs and say a few Words of the Church whose Power is very limited in this Republic  The STATE of the CHURCH  THE Republic of  Venice  has ever been careful to exclude the Clergy from their Coun∣cils and from all political Employments even those who are noble  Venetians  The Head of the Church is stiled Patriarch of  Venice  and Primate of  Dalmatia  he is always a Noble∣man enjoys a good Revenue makes a re∣spectable Appearance in public Processions but has no Power even in ecclesiastical Af∣fairs at all religious Functions where the Pope's Nuncio is present the Patriarch is obliged to send the Master of the Ceremo∣nies  to ask his Permission to give the Blessing An Office of Inquisition is allowed at  Venice  but under such Restrictions as render it as dependent on the political Government as any of the secular Tribunals are The HolyOffice is composed of the Patriarch the Nuncio and a Friar who has the Title of Father In∣quisitor and two experienced Senators with∣out whose Presence and Consent all Proceed∣ings are null by this Means and under this Pretext that Matters brought before the In∣quisition are contrary to the Laws and Inte∣rest of the Republic the greatest Affairs of this Tribunal are reduced to a mere Trifle The Convents in  Venice  were formerly so ill regulated that it occasioned much Scandal but at present they are under better Disci∣pline for three Magistrates are appointed by the Senate with an extensive Authority to take Cognizance of all that passes in the fe∣male Monasteries and though the Patriarch himself allows a Priest to say Mass in one of their Churches he is obliged to obtain a Per∣mission from one of these Magistrates besides who limits this Licence to what Time he thinks proper All the Women likewise who  perform any Commissions for the Nuns are obliged under Penalty of corporal Punishment to have Leave in Writing to execute them signed by one of the aforesaid Magistrates The Senate has within these few Years made many wise and useful Reformations in the re∣gular Convents of Friars also and have trans∣ferred from the Superiors of those Houses to the Senate the Power of inflicting capital Pu∣nishments and Imprisonment upon the Monks and only allow them for the future to impose Penances of Fasting Prayers and such like conventual Exercises  Now we must return from spiritual to tem∣poral Affairs again that I may have the Ho∣nour to introduce you to the  Venetian No∣blesse  who are not a little vain of the great Antiquity of their Nobility which they can certainly many of them at least authenticate for several Ages past better than any other Nation we are acquainted with  NOBILITY of the FIRST CLASS  THE noble  Venetians  who compose the first Class comprehend the Families of the twelve Tribunes who elected the first Doge in the  Contarini Morosini Poli Badovari Tiepoli Michele Sanudi Gradenigo Memo Fa∣lier Dondolo  and  Barozzi  The four Families next to these in Point of Antiquity date their Nobility from the Year when they signed the Contract for the Abbey of St  George  the Great these are the  Justiniani Cornaro Bra∣gadini  and  Bembo  The first are popularly called the twelve Apostles and the last the four Evangelists To this Class may be added also eight Families who look upon themselves as equal to the first because long before  il Serral del Consiglio  which happened in they were very considerable these are the  Del∣phini Quirini Soranzo Zorzi  and  Marcello  the other three by Reason of extreme Pover∣ty are fallen into total Obscurity or perhaps are extinct in this Class too may be placed some illustrious Families who retired to  Ve∣nice  from the Town of  Acre  in  Syria  when it was destroyed by the  Venetian  General TIE∣POLI for having revolted from its Obedience to the Republic after the first Conquest of it The greatest Advantage these Families derive from their Antiquity is being more considered in the Disposal of public Employments that reflect Honour on the Possessors in Point of Precedency all the Nobility of  Venice  rank alike  NOBILITY of the SECOND CLASS  THIS Class is composed of those who can produce no authentic Proof of their Nobi∣lity earlier than when their Names were written in the  Libro d'Oro  which now contains more than five hundred Families It was at that memorable Event  il Serrar del Consiglio  that this List of the Nobles was first made out and a Law enacted that if the Names of their Children were not written in this Book within a certain Time after their Birth they should forfeit their Title to Nobi∣lity and this also happens if the Contract  of their Parents' Marriage does not legally pass the Senate which it cannot do if a no∣ble  Venetian  marries a public Performer either in the Drama or Music one who has been in a State of Servitude or one whose Father is of any Profession or Trade excepting a Physician a Manufacturer of gold or silver Silks or a Maker of Glass As it is now upwards of four hundred Years since  il Serrar del Consig∣lio  this Class of Nobles is highly esteemed The most considerable of these Families that still exist are the  Moncenigo  the  Capello Fos∣carini Foscari Grimani Gritti Garzoni Love∣dan Dona Nani Malipiero Pesoro Pisani Priuli Ruzzini Sagredo Valier Venier Bassa∣dona c c  most of these have given Doges to the Republic and the reigning one at pre∣sent is a  Moncenigo  In this Rank are also placed thirty Families that were ennobled nine∣tyone Years later on the Termination of the  Genoese  War as a Reward for assisting the State with vast Sums of Momey the most considerable of these that are remaining are the  Trevisan Vendramin Renier Justi  and  Pas∣qualighi  After having introduced you to so much good Company I think you will not be sorry if I take my Leave for the present but I cannot do that without first assuring you that I am with Truth  c c  LETTER LXV Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  May    TO proceed with my Subject where I left it in my last Letter I must now talk to you a little of a younger Branch of the  Venetian  Nobility whom I shall stile the third Class and even these are respectable for their Antiquity  NOBILITY of the THIRD CLASS  IN this Class are comprehended about eighty Families who purchased their Nobility for an hundred thousand Ducats each during the last War of  Candia  some of these have remained poor and distressed ever since by that Instance of their Vanity the following are still con∣siderable for their Wealth and Alliances the  Videman Labia Zenobia Fini Manini Gam∣bara c c  The  Savorgnan  gave to the Republic some Fortresses of great Importance for guarding the  Venetitian  Territories from the Encroachments of the  Turks  and the  Ben∣zoni  made the State a Present of the Pro∣vince of  Crema  of which they possessed the Seignory and for these free Gifts the two Families received the Honour of being enno∣bled Though the noble  Venetians  can au∣thenicate the Antiquity of their Nobility bet∣ter than any People perhaps in  Europe  yet not content with this Advantage they are fond of deriving their Families from fabulous Ori∣ginals thus the  Contarini  from a Similitude  of Name pretend to be descended from an∣tient  German  Princes who were stiled Counts of the  Rhine  the  Justiniani  who give for their Arms a Spread Eagle from thence claim their Descent from an Emperor of the East of their Name I have been told a curious Anecdote of this noble Family that I will relate for your Amusement some Centuries past they fitted out a Vessel under the Doge VITAL MICHELE to fight against the Emperor EMANUEL who had ill treated the  Venetians  in the  Levant  the  Justiniani  were all cut to Pieces and the only surviving Male was a  Benedictine  Friar for whom the Doge obtained a Dispensation of his Vows from the Pope and married him to his Daughter and from this Couple are descended the present Family according to this Legend which whether true or false I shall not take upon me to deter∣mine One Branch of the  Cornaro  Family stile themselves  Cornaro della Regina  from one of their House having been Queen of  Candia  but this Alliance is rather a Blot in their Escutcheon if a certain evil Fame may be relied on who says that the Husband of this Lady was an Usurper whom she poisoned and  treacherously betrayed the  Candians  to the  Ve∣netians  A Gentleman has promised to intro∣duce me to a Lady of this Name who is a very agreeable sensible Woman and who he says will shew me the complete Ornaments of the Toilette of the Queen abovementioned which is still in the Possession of the Family and valued by them at many thousand Ducats  The CITIZENS or ORDER of SECRETARIES  THE Citizens had formerly a large Share in the Government and  Venice  would probably have always remained in a State of Democra∣cy had not the Resentment of PIETRO GRA∣DENIGO against many of the Class who op∣posed his being chosen Doge determined him to transfer the Power entirely from the Peo∣ple into the Hands of the Nobility which he fully effected by Means of the  Serrar del Consiglio  at which Period several of the No∣bles lost their Rank by not being admitted into the Secret and at present by the Word Citizen at  Venice  is meant the Families thus  excluded from the Grand Council many of whom bear the same Name and Arms of the old Nobility and to these may be added ma∣ny who by Merit or Money have obtained the same Privileges in the Republic they rank with the Nobility of the  Terra Firma  and one at least of every Family wears the Vest the same as the noble  Venetians  it has been thought this is allowed them to prevent the People from observing how small a Num∣ber of Men they are governed by Though by a standing Law every noble  Venetian  is forbid to enter into Trade yet they often join privately in Commerce with the wealthy Citi∣zens which the Senate winks at because when they are become opulent they can make it turn to the Advantage of the State by employing them in expensive Embassies From among the Citizens are chosen the Secretaries of the Senate Secretaries of Embassies and also Residents at foreign Courts for a noble  Venetian  can accept of no Employment of that kind but with the Title of Ambassador and for the same Reason the Republic receives no foreign Minister in any intermediate Cha∣racter between a Resident and an Ambassador  The Dignity of Grand Chancellor is always conferred on one of this Class and as it is the highest Honour that can be attained by a Person who is not noble it is generally given as a Reward to one who has served the Re∣public well in expensive Residencies The Sub∣jects of the  Venetian  State are by some rated at present at about but those who have made very accurate Enquiries upon this Head affirm that they are overrated by one million  Thus my Friend I have obeyed your Com∣mands and in as concise a Manner as I pos∣sibly could have endeavoured to give you a just Idea of the very extraordinary Govern∣ment of the Republic of  Venice  I flatter my∣self that by offering you this at one View I have saved you the Trouble of turning over some Books which besides being very dry read∣ing you might not easily have met with but was this little Extract or whatever you are pleased to call it to fall under the Ob∣servation of a less indulgent Judgment than yours I should with great Reason fear being charged with having given it in a slovenly in∣correct Manner I shall only advance in my De∣fence  that you well know how limited my Time is at  Venice  and how strongly my natural Incli∣nation leads me to a much more entertaining Study than that of History but to such a Friend as yourself I could not refuse a Gra∣tification that it was in my Power to procure you at the trifling Expence of putting myself for a few Hours out of my Way I only wish you may find my Attempt satisfactory However before I entirely quit this Subject I cannot forbear communicating to you a few Re∣flections into which it has naturally led me it is melancholy to observe that in a Govern∣ment so wise in many of its Parts such gross Errors should be suffered to pass uncorrected as must in Time most certainly destroy the whole System A total Neglect evidently ap∣pears in the Education of the young Nobi∣lity which gives them an Ignorance I had almost said Brutality that renders them very disagreeable in civil Society and must prove an Obstacle to their becoming wise and pru∣dent Magistrates and added to this the Li∣centiousness not only permitted but even en∣couraged among the Clergy has produced such a shameful Neglect in Matters of true  Religion that Vice and Immorality seem to pre∣vail among all Ranks of People which must in Time infallibly bring to a final Dissolution this once flourishing and powerful Republic How amazingly must the Manners of the  Ve∣netians  have been corrupted since their first Establishment if the Abbate LANGIER has drawn a true Character of them in his  Storia Veneta  P Libro He says  Esigevansi Costumi puri Condotta semplice una Vita labo∣riosia per Ottenere da Lei la Qualita di Cittadino  The same Author quotes a Letter written by CASSIODORUS who was Minister from King THEODORICK to the Tribunes of the mari∣time Isles which contains these Words  Più di sussante piccole Isole essendo state Abitate suc∣cessivamente intorno Rialto per componere al fire questa Cita prodigiosa  P Libro I have transcribed this only by Way of observ∣ing how very early  Rialto  now called  Venice  became a considerable Place LANGIER places the Election of PAOLO LUCIO ANAFESTE the first Doge in which is twelve Years ear∣lier than St DISDIER's Account who says this Prince was elected in AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI in his History of the Republic  of  Venice  says The Government of  Venice  by Consuls and Tribunes which lasted Years may be called her Infancy the de∣spotic Reign of the Doges from PAOLO LU∣CIO ANAFESTE to SEBASTIAN RIANI which comprehends Years her Childhood the Democracy which lasted above a Century her Youth which says he was robust and vigo∣rous but as it often happens in similar Cases it was disturbed and agitated by dan∣gerous Paroxisms of Wars and Revolts Her Virility he adds began with  il Serrar del Con∣siglio  and lasted till the War of the League of  Cambray  in which may be called the Beginning of her old Age  The Republic liberally rewarded SANAZAR for the following very flattering Epigram  Viderat  Adriacis Venetum NEPTUNUS  in Undis  Stare Urbem toto dicere Jura Mari  I nunc  Tarpeïas  quantum vis  JUPITER  arces  Objice illa tui  Maenia MARTIS  ait  Si  Tiberim  Pelago confers Urbem aspice utramque  Illam Homines dices hanc possuisse Deos  Thus hastily

State I can∣not do better than to take my Leave of her after paying her so high a Compliment and at the same Time shall bid you my dear Friend adieu for some Time as I propose leaving  Venice  in a few Days and from what Place I shall next write to you I cannot at pre∣sent foresee Farewel believe me  c c  LETTER LXVI Miss N to Mr HULL  Palluello  June    My dearest Friend  THE kind Expressions in your welcome Epistle and superabundant Thanks for my  Venetian  Extract were I assure you a Cor∣dial to my Heart I am rejoiced that our worthy Patroness has passed so good a Win∣ter and hope the Summer will be still more propitious to her  You will see by the Date of this Letter we have changed our Situation and are got to a sweet Retirement on the Banks of the  Brenta  the House is large convenient clean and chearful the Gardens spacious and in good Order and the whole Atmosphere per∣fumed with Roses Jasmines and Orange Flo∣wers which we have in great Profusion The River which is in the Front of the House affords a continual moving Picture of large  Barges passing to and fro from  Venice  to  Padua  from either of which Places we can have any Thing brought by Water to the very Door The north Side of the River is planted with Forest Trees and the south Side with Vines that hang in beautiful Festoons supported by other Trees in short we want nothing but a few liberal Souls such as di∣stinguish the Party you are with in this Neigh∣bourhood to render this delicious Spot an abso∣lute terrestrial Paradise yet I am sure whilst you have the Advantage of such a Socie∣ty you would not exchange your retired Spot for all I have been describing and in this Preference I join with you most cordially and beg my best Love to all the dear Mem∣bers that are so happy to be collected within the magic Circle  A hasty Summons on Account of the De∣parture of the Packet that contains this Tri∣fle obliges me to use more Brevity than I am either accustomed or inclined to I can∣not however send it off without enclosing a Piece of News that I flatter myself is not quite indifferent to you namely that please God  no unforeseen Accident intervenes in a twelvemonth's Time at farthest I may probably be so happy as to salute you all in your usual dear AssemblyRoom Be persuaded however of this simple Truth that whether the Time I am absent from you all is long or short or the Distance great or small I am ever and shall always remain with the same Affection and Sincerity  your ever faithful and obliged S N  Pray let me have the Pleasure to hear from you soon  P S By the Bye I have a Favour in the TranscriptWay to entreat of  you  You do not forget I am sure that previous to my setting off for  Venice  I was hurried about my usual Fate from Spot to Spot and sent you occasional Accounts of such Places and Events as I thought best worth your Notice A dear Friend here wishes to see them now as some Time is elapsed it would save my Head as well as Hand much Trouble if you would oblige me with Copies of those Let∣ters  provided you have thought them worth preserving I mean only as you may imagine the descriptive Parts of them  LETTER LXVII  This and the ensuing Letters are the Transcripts de∣sired in the foregoing which the Editor presumes are not an unwelcome Addition  Miss N to Mr HULL  Bridgenorth  July    Dear Sir  I THINK myself so much obliged to you for you taking so much Notice of my insignificant Scrawl that I am not the least inclined to find fault with the Length of Time you have taken in answering my last and to shew my Sincerity in this Particular I am sat down to acknowledge your Favour though I have not had it in my Possession longer than this Afternoon for it has lain some Time in  London  I have been on a Visit to a worthy Friend of ours at this Place for a Month  past and I assure you I have all the Rea∣son in the World to be satisfied with my Journey Pray good Sir did you ever see  Bridgenorth  I believe notVery well then I must give you some little Description of this Place as I am habituated to do of every new Spot I tread upon whether large or small for I think  Bridgenorth  is in Point of Situ∣ation by much the prettiest I ever saw it is divided into two Parishes distinguished by the Names of the Upper and Lower Town I was the other Day on a Visit to the Rec∣tor of the upper Parish the ParsonageHouse is a truly Gothic Structure which overlooks the ChurchYard and though I cannot say this is the most  pleasant  yet it certainly is not the least  useful  Prospect in the World to a speculative Mind The upper Town is situ∣ated on a Cliff which renders it very whol∣some both from its Height and the Clear∣ness of the Air The View from our back Windows is more beautiful than any Thing you can imagine at the Foot of the Hill the  Severn  rolls its crystal Waves in a charm∣ing serpentine Stream down to the Banks whereof is a Succession of sloping Gardens  that vie with each other in Beauty Fragrance and Order On the opposite Side in a Vale lies the lower Town and above that are de∣lightful Fields and Meadows interspersed with fine Plantations of Trees of a long Growth The Grounds by an easy Ascent terminate at last in a Common fifteen Miles long on which is a very good HorseCourse to the left the Prospect is bounded by a very high Rock and on the right as far as the Eye can stretch is a fine open fertile Country this strong Contrast has a most happy Effect A noble Object in this inimitable Landscape is the Ruin of an old Castle which from the Position wherein it has been left by a Can∣nonBall is perhaps one of the greatest Cu∣riosities in  Europe  it strikes us with Admi∣ration and Awe while we contemplate its nod∣ding Towers which look as if they meant to overwhelm the heedless Passenger in sudden De∣struction yet the  Mathematicians  affirm that nothing less than an Earthquake can move this immense Pile of Building Round it is a de∣lightful Walk where we often repair when the Weather is inviting but when this happens not to be the Case we have for our Amuse∣ment  in the House a  Microscope  a reflecting  Tellescope  and a  Camera Obscura  the first of these is my Favourite Mr L by the help of it the other Day detected a  Beau  of an  Humble Bee  in the very Act of scratching a  Louse  Oh shameful Truth off the downy Part of his Neck and this little Animal though scarcely perceptible to the naked Eye is a most  tremendous  Figure much resembling a Hog in the Glass for my Part though I am not apt to be attracted by gaudy Co∣lours I am absolutely in love with the ra∣diant Armour of a green  Beetle  richly gilded with a SunBeam I own to you my good Friend I have a hearty Contempt for the  Cox∣combs  of the human Race who place all their Happiness in Dress when I consider that an humble Moth in the simple Habit which Nature has given it far outshines them in all the Glitter of Lace and Embroidery  Whenever we amuse ourselves with these Sort of Contemplations our  worthy Neighbour the Pastor  never fails to make Improvement go Hand in Hand with Amusement by ta∣king Occasion to expatiate on the Wisdom and  bounteous Goodness of our great Creator ex∣emplified in the most minute as well as in the greatest Objects of Nature This excellent Man edifies his Parishioners as much by the exemplary Life he leads as by the sound and  orthodox  Doctrine he delivers from the Pulpit and he does this with the most chearful Dis∣position that can be and totally free from the least Shadow of  Ostentation  we attend him every Morning to public Prayers in the Church  Now my good Friend I have given you a very particular Account of my present Situa∣tion and leave it to you to judge if it is not very agreeable I must add to this that I got here Time enough for the Races where there was a great Appearance of Company for such a Place though Men were scarce I got a Partner each Night Lord STAMFORD's Family were the first in Rank Lady MARY GREY opened the Ball and I had the Honour to dance a Minuet with Mr GREY the first Night indeed I have met with so much Polite∣ness and Goodness from every Body in this Part of the World that I am sure I shall be grieved to leave  Bridgenorth  My first setting out from  London  was not so lucky for I was robbed and terrified almost to Death but  thank God  my Loss was but small and I have entirely recovered my Spirits  I desire my Love and best Respects to the worthy Family you are with and am  your very faithful Friend S N  LETTER LXVIII Miss N to Mr HULL  Dunkeld  July    I HAVE been some Time without hearing from you I hope the excellent Presi∣dent of our Society is not laid up with her old Plague the Gout If social Worth could ward off Malady she would never be ill  Perhaps you have not been in the WritingVein such a Fit attacks us all at Times and you know it is our Rule reciprocally to allow for it If that is the Case do but sub∣scribe the Initials of your Name to a good though short Account of yourselves and I will rest contented  I know not what I said in my last but to the best of my Rememberance I gave you no Account of this terestrial Paradise but now I am more acquainted with its Beauties I will make an Attempt of that Sort  The  "  Sweet winding Tay  "  which runs at the Bottom of our Garden for upwards of six Miles forms the most beautiful Canal you can imagine on the one Side of it for the same Extent are delightful Walks rising one above another no less than five Stages all amply shaded with stately Trees from around whose Trunks the twining Woodbine and SweetBriar pours forth a Profusion of Sweets the sloping Sides of the Walks are also planted with Va∣riety of sweetsmelling Shrubs which being fanned by the fresh Breezes off the River  scatter Perfumes in a plenteous and grateful Return along the verdant Banks At judicious Distances are placed grassy Seats mossgrown Cells and flowery Arbours all which in their several Turns would invite us to sit down and indulge Contemplation but that the un∣wearied Mind enraptured with these enchan∣ting Objects urges us to proceed in Search of new Beauties and in that Pursuit it cannot here meet with the slightest Disappointment The opposite Side of the River is a deep Bank finely fringed with Wood of a younger Growth at different Points of View we see the  Brawn  another beautiful River and a foaming Cas∣cade each paying the Tribute of their lucid Stores into the crystal Bosom of the  Tay  who as if conscious of superior Merit trips nimbly along in Murmurs of SelfApplause This charming Prospect is at last closed with Views of distant Ruins Hills covered with Trees fertile Vales and Mountains of a most vene∣rable Appearance covered with a Heath so beautiful that it may vie with the glowing Amaranthus The Gardens are very extensive and laid out in the finest Taste that is to say with Grandeur and Simplicity united  Nature appears here in her loveliest Attire and Art is contented to act in her proper Sphere as Handmaid to the Goddess We seldom drink Tea in the House sometimes an elegant Tent and  Marquis  is pitched at some fine Point of View sometimes we resort to a fine banqueting Room and often the Shade of a large spreading Oak has the Pre∣ference Upon these Occasions the Duke al∣ways reads and we work What most attracts my Admiration here is to perceive that in every surrounding Object Utility adds Merit to Beauty the FarmHouses on this Estate are neat as the Hand of Industry can make them and chearful as the Smiles of Content and every Creature that breathes upon this Spot seems to participate in the unfeigned Happiness of the excellent Possessors whose Goodness adds the highest Lustre to Wealth and Title that they are capable of receiving It was well said whoever made the Observation that a good Action never loses its reward here was I sat down full of Love and Re∣spect to write my dearest Friends a dutiful and loving Letter when lo and behold I was made happy by the Receipt of yours and  truly rejoiced I am to find that my Fears are groundless however I don't feel happy at the Thought of our Society's meeting with any Interruption to its Pleasures Believe my Assurance sincere when I affirm that I think the  Content  which reigns therein far excels in Value the highest Gratifications that Shew and Grandeur can bestow on its restless Votaries Pray have you ever read DE TOUCHE's Co∣medies I am positive such excellent Subjects modelled for our Stage would be of public Emolument and I should hope would be productive of both Honour and Profit to the Undertaker I am afraid by what you say of  Dunkeld  I gave you an Account of its Beauties in my last if so this will be a hor∣rid stupid Repetition in that Case commit me to the Flames without the least Remorse of Conscience I hope the Sight of a Letter directed by the Pen of a fine young Gen∣tleman won't give you any Alarm I con∣fess it has done so by me since this new fashioned Way of franking Adieu In more Haste than can be expressed believe me ever  your very sincere Friend S N  LETTER LXIX Miss N to Mr HULL  Dunkeld  Sept    HOW strong and wonderful my good Friend is the Force of Habit I re∣member near upon my Departure from the dear Society in  Somersetshire  I felt an auk∣ward Kind ofI don't know whatwhen it was proposed that I should maintain a con∣tinual Correspondence with  one of the other Sex  during my Absence I felt this even in spite of the Conviction that writing to  you  was in fact but writing to the  whole Circle  How idleNow that I have done so for some Time I have taught myself to address you with as little Reserve as if you were my  real  instead of my  nominal  Uncle So much the betterReserve was not made for true Friendship and liberal Minds and with none but such do I correspondSo much by Way of Digression now to return to my little Travels  We have been these six Weeks past at  Atholl  House a very magnificent Seat of the Duke's twenty Miles higher up in the High∣lands than this Place is though it far ex∣ceeds  Dunkeld  in Grandeur yet I own the rural Beauties of the latter have more Charms for my humble Disposition Providence ha∣ving no doubt designed me to tread the  "Cool sequestered Vale of Life"  has bounded my Ideas accordingly and I look upon this as one of the numberless Instances I have ex∣perienced of the Divine Bounty The Coun∣try about  Atholl  is very romantic and beauti∣ful in some Places rather wild in others very fertile which forms a fine Contrast The House is immensely large the Rooms are in∣finite in Number finely proportioned and elegantly furnished throughout 'tis situated in a very extensive Vale amply wooded and or∣namented with four beautiful Rivers all of which at different Places lose themselves in the  Tay  Some of them from the Tops of very high Mountains receive a prodigious In∣crease from the finest natural Cascades you can imagine which is a Sight extremely beautiful  and at the same Time very tremendous The KitchenGarden is the finest Thing of the Kind that in my Life I ever saw elegant Sum∣merhouses Alcoves Octagons  c c  often tempted us to drink Tea abroad and enjoy the fine extensive Views at Leisure I should have told you that the Vale is surrounded with Hills and Mountains at such a Distance that in∣stead of confining the Prospect they add great∣ly to the Grandeur of it  I must not omit to mention a natural Cu∣riosity I here met with of a very extraordinary Kind M' PHERSON Laird of  Foignes  two Years before the Peace raised eight and twen∣ty Men to serve in  America  who unanimously declared when they came to embark that they would not have enlisted had they not thought they should have served under  him  the ge∣nerous Laird was so struck with this Proof of their Attachment that he declared they should not be disappointed and at the Age of seventytwo asked Leave to serve as a Vo∣lunteer during the Remainder of the Cam∣paign he was present in every Action was always ready to expose his Person and never  was a single Day prevented by Illness from doing his Duty the Government has reward∣ed his spirited Generosity with a  Lieutenancy  and Leave to retire upon full Pay so that now like the Patriarchs of old he wages more harmless Wars with the feathered Race and swiftfooted Stag now at near fourscore Years of Age he is able to walk and scram∣ble amongst the Mountains the whole Day in Pursuit of Game How few my good Friend of our degenerate Countrymen are at such an Age able to serve their King and Country Enervated by Sloth and Luxury long before that Period of Life they become a Burthen to themselves and a Torment to all about them When I looked at the military Garb and venerable silver Locks of this northern Hero I fancied I saw in his single Person an Epitome of all the illustrious  Greeks  that served in the Siege of  Troy  and if my Heart had been inclined to change its present Situa∣tion I verily believe I should without Hesi∣tation have bestowed it upon this warlike Mountaineer  I fear the Season is now approaching when our friendly Association must lose some of its  agreeable Ornaments I feel for the Mortifi∣cation a  sensible  Mind must suffer at being obliged to quit the Society of a favourite  few  to mix with the unthinking many but hope that the kind Genius of Friendship will inter∣pose a Gleam of Pleasure at the Prospect of a future Meeting  My Love to all you know is a constant Commission and I am sure you will never forget to discharge it How is that best of good Beings our President our Patroness our Life our Spirit our all Is she not the wor∣thiest of Heaven's Worthies Was there ever Acquaintance who did not esteem her Friend who did not love her Domestic who did not bless her or Indigent who came to her Door that did not pray for her Long may she remain with us and whenever it pleases Pro∣vidence to remove her from Earth may she receive Blessings in a future State in as ample Portions as she through Life has ever wished and endeavoured to dispense them to her FellowCreatures  S N  LETTER LXX Miss N to Mr HULL  KimboltonCastle  Nov    DID you ever expect to hear of or from me again Ever since I received your last I have lived the  ife of a Whirlagig but be assured that I had not a Moment to tell you so The dear Spot I left was al∣ways in my Thoughts and indeed as yet my poor Brain is far from being in a composed State a scribbling Moment too is the only good Thing that is scarce here A few Days after I received yours we left the calm Sweets of  Dunkeld  and went to pay a second Visit at Lord BREADALBANE's where all was Mirth Music Masquerades  c c  From thence we set forth on our Return towards a southern Sun and gentler Breezes and stopped for a few Days at the elegant and superb Seat of Lord BINGLEY near  York  there we found a brilliant Assembly of Ladies and Gentlemen  who had met to dine and play Cards how∣ever most of them went away in the Evening and we remained a decent Party for the rest of the Time from thence we bent our Course to this magnificent Castle hoping wishing and expecting to find a quiet peaceable Family till  Christmas  when we knew a deli∣cious Riot was always intended but lo and behold here we found his Highness of  York  Lord and Lady CHARLES SPENCER Lady CHATHERINE and Mr BEAUCLERK Lord and Lady LUDLOW and a World more of fine Folks the very first Night we were forced to join in a Ball and every Day whilst his Highness stayed we had Music in the Morn∣ings and Cards or Dancing at Night I be∣lieve every Creature was fatigued with Plea∣sures and I can answer for one who was glad when it was over the Duke of YORK was so pleased with his Entertainment that it is not impossible but he may return at  Christmas  We are now a sober decent Party of ten or twelve and like rational Beings read and work in the Evenings and to shew you that all this Dissipation does not totally banish serious Thoughts we have Prayers con∣stantly  every Morning in a beautiful Chapel in the Castle I take it for granted that you know all this Time that the Owner of this Palace is the Duke of MANCHESTER who is a very amiable young Nobleman his Bro∣ther Lord CHARLES MONTAGU is no less so the Duchess is beautiful polite and a very good young Woman but the Character that I could dwell upon with Delight for Ages is Lady CAROLINE MONTAGU the Duke's Sister If ever perfect Goodness chose to dwell with mere Mortality one may imagine it inhabits her Breast and I flatter myself that you will not conceive the worse Idea of her Ladyship when I tell you that she honours me with a very particular Friendship unworthy as I am of such a valuable Distinction Don't think I flatter for I am perfectly sincere when I assure you that I often think amidst this perpetual Round of gay Amusements with infinite Regret of the dear  social Party  where∣with I have spent some of the happiest and most rational Moments of my Life I gave such a Picture of it to a young Man of  great Quality  and  good Sense  a little while ago that he made me pass my Word if ever we met  at to introduce him to the Lady Pa∣troness of the agreeable  Society  I beg my best Affections to all the dear Associates I rejoice without the least Mixture of Envy at my worthy Namesake's happy Prospects and sincerely wish she may enjoy every Feli∣city the  holy Estate  can possibly produce I hope I need not say that a Letter from you always gives me Pleasure you will I am sure indulge me between this and  Christmas  Pray tell me in your next if Mr QUIN is not alive besides the Concern I should feel for his Death I am engaged in a Wager about it  I am become such a wandering Vagabond over the Face of the Earth that I should not be a Bit surprised to find myself conveyed suddenly to the utmost Extent of the habita∣ble Globe I fear I shall be less fortunate than NOAH's Dove she at last found Rest for the Sole of her Foot but I doubt I shall not till my Soul has taken its Flight to some more happy Region I assure you I meant no Pun but I see one has fallen from my Pen of its own Accord I heard from our  Friends in since I got here and have the Satisfaction to find they are all well  I would attempt to give you some Idea of this Place but there is a Magnificence and Extensiveness in it that goes far beyond the Capacity of my Pen The Castle is a very large and regular Building the Connoisseurs say the Architecture is very just 'tis expen∣sively furnished though not in the modern Taste there are many good Paintings that this Duke bought in  Italy  The Parks Lawns  c c  are judiciously planted and laid out in a good Taste I find the present Possessor has made many Improvements and is making still more The Plate and Apparatus for the Table is more superb than any Thing of the Kind that I have ever seen and the Table is always elegantly covered but I must confess this is the Kind of Luxury that pleases me the least and I often think how much more healthy and consequently happier our Forefathers were than their degenerate Proge∣ny who live upon  Ragouts Fricasses  and highseasoned Meats  Adieu If you are tired with my moralizing you will not be sorry that both my Time and Paper obliges me to assure you that I am with the sincerest Truth your ever obliged  S N  LETTER LXXI  This and the following are evidently written on a se∣cond Trip to  Venice  Miss N to Mr HULL  Paris  July    Dear Sir  I NOW write to you from this Metropolis of  Dirt  and  Gentility  which owing to the Narrowness of the Streets and Height of the Houses puts me more in mind of the Ca∣pital of  North  than of  South Britain  but then the  Grands Hotels  are more noble and in greater Abundance than our Noblemen's Houses and the Environs of  Paris  are in my Opi∣nion finer than those of  London  which Place  we left on  Thursday  the th of this Month and arrived here on  Tuesday  the d with∣out meeting any disagreeable Accident during the Journey We have got a very elegant Apartment in one of the best Parts of  Paris  and you may be sure have lost no Time since our Arrival in seeing every Thing that is worthy a Stranger's Curiosity The  Thuilleries  of which  French  Novellists make such frequent Mention is a pleasant Place for the People of Fashion to take the Air in The  Louvre  which in outward Shew far exceeds any Palace we have runs along one End of it and on the opposite Side a fine Square is building called the  Place de Louis Quinze  there are noble shady Walks and a charming Terrass that commands a fine View of  Paris  but the old Taste in which the Center of the Garden is laid out is frightful and exactly resembles the Ornaments of a MincedPye There is another fashionable Rendezvous for the Evening Airings about a Mile out of  Paris  that I confess pleases me still more called the  Bois de Bullogne  where instead of a sharp Gravel and crowded Walks like our Park you may wander about  at full Liberty and tread upon a verdant Car∣pet all the Time which to tenderfooted Folks makes a great Difference We have seen se∣veral private Collections of Paintings and other Curiosities that do great Honour to the Taste and Judgment of the Possessors but nothing charms me so much as a noble Collection of Pictures at the  Palais Royale  which belongs to the Duke of ORLEANS first Prince of the Blood and were chiefly purchased by the famous Regent The grand Opera here is the finest Thing to see one can possibly imagine the Scenes are splendid the Dresses rich and elegant the Dances composed with infinite Taste and finely executed and the Stage much better filled than ours but the Music is truly detestable 'tis all  French  and from the Beginning to the End like a solemn Dirge As for the Voices if you will imagine a Concert composed of Cats Owls and Monkeys it will give you a tole∣rable Idea of the Harmony and whoever as∣sassinates your Ears with the greatest Violence is most applauded The  French  comic Opera is as agreeable as the serious one is the re∣verse The Songs are all sprightly  Italian  Airs the Scenery and Dresses as at the other excel ours and to my Fancy this is the most agreeable Amusement  Paris  affords their Manner of acting Plays I own does not charm me after being used to the genteel familiar Dialogue of our  English  Comedies and even in Tragedy I think they have too much Ener∣gy both of Voice and Action I should not thus familiarly play the Critic were I not perfectly well acquainted with your Candour and Goodnature for after all I am talking of what I don't understand and am as likely to be wrong as right So much by Way of Digression a Liberty all modern Novellists allow themselves and now my Narrative pro∣ceeds to the Chapter of Fashions for the Sake of the female Members of your Party The Ladies in general would I believe be hand∣some but for two shocking Dabs of Crimson or Scarlet which some prefer in a circular Form directly under each Eye which makes them look just like so many Furies the Hair dressed out of all Proportion for often the Height of the Hair is more a great Deal than the Length of the whole Face even  I  who am quite moderate am at least three Inches  of  Toupée  taller than I was when I left  Eng∣land  the Hoops are very small the Ruffles very moderate and the Necks more covered than in  England  the Gowns are made very high behind and pin pretty close before and almost as wide at Bottom as at Top the Pleats of the Sacks behind are made narrower than ours The married Ladies indeed we never see any other in public all wear very small Caps The Court being in Mourning prevents our seeing any other finery than Dia∣monds in which the Ladies seem to abound in general more than in  England  Not a Head of any Sort have I yet seen that is not abso∣lutely plaistered with Pomatum and Powder those of the Poor as well as the Rich I wonder the Consumption of Flower in this Metropolis of welldressed dirty People does not breed a Famine the Streets are always so crowded with them that you would swear  Paris  was the most populous Place and the  Pa∣risians  the most idle Set of People in the whole World A fashionable Custom here is when the Comedy is finished to drive to what is called the  Grande Boule Vert  one Side of which is shaded with Trees and the other filled with  large Coffeehouses finely illuminated where you see all Manner of Sport going forward as Eating Dancing Music PuppetShows Conjurers Fireworks FireEaters Giants Lil∣liputians  c c  in short you may be amused in about the Length of the Mall from eight in the Evening till three in the Morning but the genteel Way is only to drive up and down the Walk without getting out of your Car∣riage I am afraid that my Description of  Paris  and its Amusements will tire both your Eyes and your Patience at least it has done so by me and I have scribbled in such a Hurry that it is not fit to send but I flatter myself you would rather have a Letter ill written than none I am mortified though that it will cost you a great deal more po∣stage than it is worth and by the Time it reaches you we shall probably be pursuing our Journey so that I cannot hope to hear a Word of or from our dear Society till I get to  Venice  In the mean Time I beg to be remembered in the kindest Manner to every Member and that you will believe me to be as I ever am with Truth and Sincerity yours and the Society's truly affectionate and obliged  S N  I hope you are able to enjoy this charming Weather for I hope 'tis such with you as well as with us by taking many agreeable Walks in your delightful Meads I assure you the  Seine  is nothing comparable to the  Avon  and the  Pont Neuf  so much extolled by  Fame  and  Frenchmen  is a paltry Affair in Comparison of  WestminsterBridge  Now I must have done and I am sure you will be glad of it  I was so charmed and so moved last Night at the Tragedy of  Zayre  that I am almost tempted to recant what I have said against the  French Tragedians  but I still feel a Partiality for our own Actors I will not be so unrea∣sonable to teize you any longer with my Scrawl once more adieu  LETTER LXXII Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  Oct    My dear Friend  THE greatest Pleasure I can feel during my Exile is to hear good Accounts fre∣quently of those Friends in  England  that are most dear to me I hope you will answer this very soon and be so good as to direct your Letter to me as usual under Cover to Mr who has the Care of sending our Letters to the Secretary of State's Office by which Means I receive my Letters much safer than when they are not put in the Packet It is not yet quite three Months since I left  England  and I declare it appears to me three Years already we were so fortunate as to perform our Journey without one unlucky Ac∣cident On the twentieth of  July  of all Days in the Year we began our Peregrinations and arrived here on the twentieth of  August  after stopping about five Days on the Road to  see different Places that were worthy of Ob∣servation We made no small Figure I as∣sure you at setting out our Train consist∣ing of two PostCoaches and two PostChaises to our no small Amusement we were mistaken for Foreigners all the Way to  Dover  which I suppose was owing to our wearing large  French  Caps without Hats and our Gentlemen being dressed in loose  French  Coats which are the most convenient Kind of Dress for tra∣velling We were not quite three Hours cros∣sing the Water the Quickness of the Passage scarcely made up for the Roughness of it which was really frightful even to me who am no despicable Sailor for a  Female  In short I was the only Person well enough to nurse which was very necessary for the other Females in our Party At  Calais  we found two excellent Berlins waiting to conduct us to  Strasbourg  in which we proceeded with our two  English  Chaises Our Route was quite different from that by which we once went from  Strasbourg  to  Paris  to my no small Joy for I think a twicegone Road almost as bad as a twicetold Tale I had an Op∣portunity by this Means of seeing Beauties in  Champaigne  which till then I had no Idea of for many Miles the Road formed an actual Terrass bounded on one Side by little Hills interspersed with Vineyards and Corn Fields and on the other Side the Eye is led by a gentle Descent down to the most fertile Vales the Verdure of which could scarcely be con∣ceived from the Painting of pastoral Poetry through these for an immense Way meanders a most beautiful serpentine River whose Banks are adorned with innumerable Droves of Cat∣tle of every Sort which puts one in Mind of the peaceful Reign of the Patriarchs since being undivided they appear to be the Pro∣perty of  one  Master You will scarcely think my good Friend that these smiling Scenes could raise melancholy Ideas and yet they had that Effect upon my Mind in almost every Village we passed through which had looked beautiful at a Distance we found all the Appearance of Wretchedness and Want that you see in the most dreary Parts of  Savoy  for what the Extravagance and Luxury of the Prince of CONDE part of whose immense Ter∣ritory this is leaves to the Peasants is wrecked from them by the lazy Priests who like Lo∣custs  seem to be sent only to eat up the Riches of the Land here you see no hospi∣table Gentleman's Seat no warm neat Cot∣tages those are Comforts reserved only for the  English  who would perhaps be more grate∣ful for the Blessings they enjoy if they pos∣sessed fewer of them But to return to our Journey the fine Season of the Year good Roads and every where tolerable Accommoda∣tions carried us in twelve Days to  Strasbourg  where we stopped for three Days and where you may if you please suppose we shall re∣main till you hear from me next as I shall defer the Rest of my Account of our Jour∣ney for a future Letter  The Masking is just begun and two comic Operas and two PlayHouses opened I have been once at the Opera and caught such a Cold partly I suppose a Tribute to the Sea∣son of the Year and partly to Change of Cli∣mate that for fear of the like Accident I shall frequent Theatres very little unless I am tempted by a Party  I fear my dear Friends your Patience will be quite tired out before you get to the Con∣clusion of this very long Letter but as I can only send a  single Letter  I could not re∣sist taking the largest Paper and I cannot bear to send it you blank  I am just in the disagreeable Situation I was this Time two Years when I was so happy to be with you almost all my worldly Goods being at the Mercy of the Waves and the Ship ought to have been here at least a Month ago Adieu my dearest Friends may you en∣joy every earthly Good and may we be mu∣tually happy in a joyful Meeting is the ear∣nest Wish and Prayer of  your sincerely affectionate S N  LETTER LXXIII Miss N to Mr HULL  Venice  Jan    I Received with infinite Pleasure my dear Friends your very kind Letter the good Account you give of yourselves is really and truly a  Happiness  to me and you have my sincere Prayers and good Wishes that your Health and Spirits may daily improve I make no Doubt but your Tour was a de∣lightful one there is about you our sweet Patroness a certain Chearfulness and Goodhumour that proceeds immediately from the Heart that not only illuminates her own Dis∣position but inspires those about her with the most pleasing Sensations the human Mind is capable of feeling I beg of you to present my best Affections to the Doctor and Mrs W and assure them that I take the sincerest Part in their Affliction my good  Papa  's filial Piety always appeared to me a  shining Part of his Charactermy Love and sincere good Wishes attend every Member of the  dear Society  would to God I could say I had any Prospect of being soon reunited to that best of all possible Societies but alas that is not to be hoped for what  must be must be  and I make no Doubt 'tis right  Now my dear Friend I must beg of you to take a Step back with me to  Strasbourg  for there I think we parted last from thence we steered our Course to  Ball  or  Bazill  as it is called in the Maps in  Switzerland  This Change in our Route delighted me We were induced to make this little Round to avoid a great Part of  Swabia  where we heard the Roads were almost impassable the Water un∣wholsome a great Scarcity of Provisions and the Measles raging every where  Ball  is ex∣tremely well worth the Observation of Travel∣lers the Situation is on a very noble Part of the  Rhine  which runs through the Town it also merits the Attention of the Lovers of  Virtù  as the best Relict of the famous HOL∣BENS known by the Name of  Death's Dance  is preserved in the public Library From  Ball  we proceeded to  Schafhausen  another of the protestant  Swiss  Cantons about three Miles hence is the Cataract of the  Rhine  an Ob∣ject which I contemplated with a Mixture of  Horror  and  Pleasure  easier to be felt than described which I beg you will tell my  Papa  conveyed to me a clearer Idea of the  Sublime and Beautiful  than I could ever gather even from Mr BURKE We next travelled a very pleasant Road and caught many fine Views of the famous Lake  de Constance  but upon the whole though I like  Swisserland  well enough  enpassant  there is an unpolished melancholy Air even in the greatest Towns that is disgusting When we got into the  Tyrrol  every Thing lost the Charm of Novelty to me and I had only the mortifying Reflection to make that when I last passed those rugged Paths I was going towards  England  and now alas was going from it As we met with no Adven∣tures new or surprising I will trouble you with no further Particulars of our Journey save that we arrived at  Venice  the twentieth of  August  after being exactly a Month on the Road without meeting with one Overturn bro∣ken  Axeltree or other sinister Accident what∣ever  And now let me say a few Words for my∣self independent of Company Since the twen∣ty sixth of  December  every Creature here that has Spirits enough to be so has appeared quite mad indeed  Venice  in CarnivalTime espe∣cially is only fit for those who can place their Happiness in  Vice Folly  and  Dissipation  indeed I am not only a professed but a sin∣cere Enemy to these three you will believe me when I tell you that I am horridly out of my Element here and I feel the greatest Conviction that I shall never taste a hearty Satisfaction till I again enjoy our rational dear friendly Society but I fear the Time is very far distant when I shall be allowed to par∣take of such enviable Amusements You know I mean in this Declaration only to refer to the Customs of the Place not to the Party where∣with I came which is indisputably as rational and amiable as  can  be enjoyed uninterrupted with Hurry of  Place  and ceremonial Visitors I believe you have often heard me mention a Mrs S a very particular Friend of mine  who has been settled here many Years and now having lost a Husband in his ninetyninth or hundredth Year she is preparing to return to  England  we have talked so much and so often of you all that she is persuaded she is ac∣quainted with you and begs me to give her Compliments to you and I verily believe she will be tempted when she arrives to make you a friendly Visit  I am ashamed to send you such a horrid Scrawl but I have wrote it by Snatches with most vile Implements the Date will faith∣fully shew you it was begun on the twenty∣sixth of  January  and now I am concluding it on the ninth of  February  so that you may be assured though I  seem  dilatory in writing I by no Means intend to  be  so I was in Hopes to have popped this into a Dispatch but alas they are grown scarce Commodities at our House  We have no less than three Operas and four Play Houses open and would you believe it I am grown so  old  or so  stupid  that I pre∣fer a Book or a Pen by the FireSide to  any of them I am much abused for this Want of Taste but so hardened a Sinner am I that it grows every Day stronger on me Adieu my dear good Friend may every Fe∣licity and Blessing attend you all Such is the sincere Prayer of your ever  faithful and affectionate S N  FINIS  Books published by J Dodsley  N B The Books are to be understood as bound except
