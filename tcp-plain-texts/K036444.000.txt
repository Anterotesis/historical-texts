 CONTENT  A  PASTORAL SONG  By the late Mr  CUNNINGHAM  O'ER moorlands and mountains rude barren and bare  As wearied and wilder'd I roam  A gentle young shepherdess sees my despair  And leads me o'er lawns to her home  Yellow sheaves from rich Ceres her cottage had crown'd  Green rushes were strew'd on the floor  Her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round  And deck'd the sod seats at the door  We sat ourselves down to a cooling repast  Fresh fruits and she cull'd me the best  Whilst thrown from my guard by some glances she cast  Love slily stole into my breast  I told my soft wishes she sweetly reply'd  Ye virgins her voice was divine  I've rich one's rejected and great ones deny'd  Yet take me fond shepherd I'm thine  Her air was so modest her aspect so meek  So simple tho' sweet were her charms  I kiss'd the ripe roses that glow'd on her cheek  And lock'd the dear maid in my arms  Now jocund together we tend a few sheep  And if on the banks by the stream  Reclin'd on her bosom I sink into sleep  Her image still softens my dream  Together we range o'er the slowrising hills  Delighted with pastoral views  Or rest on the rock whence the streamlet distils  And mark out new themes for my muse  To pomp or proud titles she ne'er did aspire  The damsel's of humble descent  The cottager Peace is well known for her sire  The shepherds have nam'd her CONTENT
