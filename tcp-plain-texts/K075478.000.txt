to playful minds very much indispose them for their reception This consideration occasioned writers to introduce morality under a mask and teach it in the form of fables and a variety of entertaining stories others have laboured to communicate this knowledge by lessons drawn from life or living characters but it needs an age to acquire such knowledge and a man will be going out of the world before he becomes acquainted with it To remedy this defect pictures of human life have been introduced upon the stage and he who has made any observation must admit that since our theatres have been morally supported and extended to almost every town our ideas have been opened and our manners very much improved they having held up Virtue in  esteem and laughed Vice almost out of countenance  The Vignette in the titlepage expresses this fully Wisdom holding up a mirror to Folly and shewing him to himself  Know thyself  is a lesson of the first importance and ought to be imprinted on the mind of every one for he who knows himself will be careful to correct his failings and improve his virtues  Having some years since descanted on the work of Mr  Hogarth  and moralized his pieces and finding them in the hands of a variety of young person who would not otherwise have taken up a book of improvement I was led to think that as every lesson of religious and worldly knowledge is to be met with in our collection of English Proverbs to exemplify these Proverbs would almost answer a similar purpose and having met with an artist  Mr John Bewick  who knew how to illustrate the follies and vices of mankind better than most men I have profited by his abilities and flatter myself the Proverbs thus introduced to the notice of young minds will have a much better effect and make a more lasting impression  than any dull reading or scholastic admonition whatever Every eye is able to collect the meaning of a picture and the idea suggested by it is caught at a glance but to receive impressions from books it is not only necessary to read but to reflect and I very much doubt whether the sermons of a  Tillotson  ever preached so effectually as the paintings of a  Hogarth  The art of painting says Mr  Knox  in his improving Essays is one of those innocent and delightful means of pleasure which Providence has kindly afforded to brighten the prospects of human life Under due restrictions and with proper direction it may be rendered something more than an elegant mode of pleasing the eye and the imagination it may become a very powerful auxiliary to virtue  In this sense I have used it I have made the attempt with a few of our Proverbs and mean to follow them with more and as I wish them to succeed the use of fables have written them though in an easy stile in language that whilst I mend the heart I may improve the mind To bring youth forward after then years of age children should be addressed as grown persons for treating  them as children tends only to discourage them If they are at any time at a loss their little inquisitive minds will make them ask an explanation and such explanation will be a new and pleasing discovery  In discoursing on these Proverbs I have endeavoured to be explicit yet concise that though anxious to inform I may not tire and as the illustration of one Proverb will be continued under its relative or a similar one every thing that is necessary on the subject will be said but apparently under a new head and some new interesting scene  The prints though cut in wood are so well designed and the characters so well drawn that persons of taste may examine them with pleasure  J TRUSLER  A good Beginning makes a good End  THIS Proverb is not so general in its views as some being rather limited in its meaning It does not imply that a piece of work well begun  must  be well finished though the likeliest method of completing it to your wish is to begin it so and a good beginning is a favourable index of a good end but the maxim has a moral tendency directing its views to mankind who rarely  in fact practise in manhood the principles they inbibe in their youth  Just as the twig is bent the tree's inclined  The youth educated and brought up in the paths of virtue seldom strays It begets a love and veneration for those paths which mature years serve only to increase  Children like tender oziers take the bow  And as they first are fashion'd always grow  If therefore the seeds of religion and honor are sown in youth they will bring forth the fruits of temporal happiness in riper life "Train up a child" says Solomon "in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it"Thus will  a good Beginning make a good End  Behold in the scene before us the calmness and serenity with which the good man meets his end Death approaches him at his window shews him that his glass is run and calls him to futurity Far from shrinking at the awful summonsfar from shuddering at that call which thousands dread he receives the notice with open arms not merely rejoicing to be released from the bed of sickness but eager to meet his Redeemer which the holy scriptures have taught him to expect and with an anxiousness  to be with Christ which in the hour of death can only flow from the consciousness of a wellspent life He had been well educatedhis  beginning  was goodso was his  end  Death is armed with no terrors for him He boldly throws aside the curtain and stretches forth his arms to embrace him Thus doth the evening of life crown the day  By the pious precepts and the virtuous example of an indulgent parent the fair Laura profits See her on her knees offering her prayers to the throne of Heaven and beseeching the gracious Author of her being to enable her to live as has her father and that "her latter end may be like his" His care had thrown within her tender mind a light upon the gospel of which the bible before her and the burning taper are types and raises her eyes to her Redeemer on the cross not as to an idol but as a  memento  that he died for all Methinks I hear the good man thus addressing her "See" says he laying his spectacles near the scriptures beside him "See my Laura whence I have derived the happiness I now enjoyThe sacred truths in this book have inspired me with a love for virtue A wellspent life is the best comfort of old ageIt disarms death of all its terrors and enables us to meet it without reluctanceThis  is the bock that tells us "we shall never die" but that if our Beginning is good and we sow the seeds of virtue early our End will be good also and after this life we shall reap the fruit of eternal happiness in the next We shall be able on the bed of sickness to welcome Death with extended arms to view with composure the last of our sand running and exclaim with the good man before us"O Death  where  is thy sting"  On the contraryIf in early life we associate with bad company if we indulge our wishes gratify our passions and run heedless and headlong into every vice we may enjoy a transitory happiness a little pleasure for awhile but when Death shall come as sooner or later it is sure to do we shall tremble at its approach shudder at its ghastly visage draw the curtain round us shriek at the sight of it's dart and call upon "the mountains to fall on us and to cover us"  If then we would meet Death without horror let us lead a good life if our conscience does not condemn us we shall have nothing to dread for as a bad Beginning makes a bad End so  "A good Beginning makes a good End"  The Worth of a Thing is best known by its Want  THE French have a Proverb similar to this "The cow knows not what her tail is worth till she hath lost it" as it serves to whisk the flies from her teaching us not to disregard a thing because we have no present use for it be it in it's own nature ever so insignificant All things are equally important in their way and there is no  trifle be it of what kind it will but may at times be converted to some good purpose A prudent man therefore will never make waste of any thing he has but use it discreetly and bless Providence for all it's gifts The painter has shewn us the force of this truth in the want of water A hot scorching season has dried up a well whose water not being the sweetest in the neighbourhood was disregarded but at the same time was never known to dry away When every other spring had sailed the people flocked to this saying "Bad water was better than none" and they must have recourse to the stinking well at last Here then they flocked in a sultry parching day both men and animals but how great was their disappointment at finding this dry also and how manifest is their chagrin painted in their countenances Even stinking water would have now been acceptable but these thoughtless people are made to feel the want of it  Learn then ye inconsiderate of the age from the moral of this story not to spurn at the good offices of those below you nor become thankless in the hour of prosperity It may happen that your resources may be dried up and that you may be in want of those very services you now despise Friends are not easily acquired when a man  therefore fortunately  has  friends let him "shew himself friendly" and endeavour to keep them There is no friend so poor but may have it in his power to be of use to us in the course of life and his services therefore should never be contemned  This Proverb may also be a lesson to us not to waste the good things of this life which Heaven has been pleased to bless us with under an idea that we may never want them If we have more than we want we should bestow it on those who have less Here we may lay it up in store for "what we give to the poor we lend to the Lord" and shall afterwards find in our own chest We are not however to be lavish in our charity but act with wisdom and discretion laying something by against an evil day Many are the turns and ebbs in a man's fortune and though he is rich today he may be poor tomorrow And as he that wastes will want let us be careful not to bring ourselves into such a situation for though the rich have many friends the poor have seldom any but these friends of the rich are little else than butterflies that flutter round a man's good fortune as a moth round the flame of a candle but who will desert him when distress comes upon him and fall from him like withered leaves at the approach of winter  We are here taught likewise in another sense to husband our time and never put off that till tomorrow which can be done today For that tomorrow may never come we may be taken out of the world when we least expect it and what we propose to do may thus never be accomplished If we are then to make provision for our families let us do it whilst we have it in our power and if we are to make provision for ourselves let us not defer it till it is too late By provision for ourselves I mean making our peace with Heaven and laying up riches "where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through and steal" There is no man so virtuous but stands in need of repentance and if he is wise he will repent of his sins whilst he is enabled to do it and not waste those precious hours in a life of pleasure and dissipation which he can employ to more nobler purposes The time he now thinks so little of he may one day want and then what would he give to live it over again be wise then and circumspect make the most of your present hours be thankful for every thing you have place your reliance on God whose springs are never dry turn every thing within your reach to the best advantage don't consider even the smallest thing as below your notice for be assured its  Worth is best known by its Want  Experience is the Mistress of Fools  THERE are many persons in the world who despise admonition and cannot be brought to believe things wrong till they have found them so by experience and often buy this experience at a dear rate This makes even fools wise and hence the Proverb  Experience is the Mistress of Fools  In vain did the inventor of gunpowder perceive its strength in blowing up large pieces of rock He doubted it's power until he had placed himself upon a large stone over some but his experience was fatal to him having lost his life upon the occasion Posterity however have been benefited by this rash act and fools have by that experiment been made wise It would be well for us all if as Lillo says "we learnt to be wise by others harm"  There is scarce any situation any circumstance in life but if we look round upon it we may profit by the experience of others 'Tis this which the Proverb alludes to not to wait for conviction till we are taught it by experience fools can do no more and such a lesson may be attended with bad consequences This was the case with the inventor of gunpowder we have mentioned Sad experience indeed dwells the longest with us and it is in this sense that  Wit bought is better than wit taught  because selfpreservation teaches us that the knowledge we acquire with pain we are apt to remember longest as  A burnt child dreads the fire  In illustration of this truth see the picture before us The little rogue has incautiously purloined  the honey and the bees have shewn their resentmentThey have done him all the ill they couldThey have stung him  It's pow'r to hurt each creature feels  Bulls aim their horns and asses lift their heels  In vain did his parents advise him to desist in vain did they point out the danger of engaging rashly with a hive of bees experience has now made him wise and the smart he feels will tell him the next time he approaches a beehive to be more upon his guard The hive is a significant emblem of industry it being the storehouse where the bees lay up their provision for the winter and the props under the hive are meant to shew that industry will never want support nor is even the stick without it's moral pointing straight to the boy that is running off it tells us that Industry is the straight line to retirement for  the diligent man maketh rich  Prudent lad he has benefited by the experience of his companion and has escaped the harm knowing now that he  cannot gather roses without thorns  or honey without the risk of being stung"I will provide myself" cries he "as well as I can against the danger and then I'll try"  Next to purchasing experience at the expence of pain to ourselves is that wisdom of profiting by the misfortunes of others Indeed all knowledge is acquired by observation and he is the wisest man who learns it soonest having the advantage of his fellowcreatures he may smile at the ignorance of fools but if he needs a second caution he deserves to pay dear for his knowledge to be laughed at by the world and to feel the unpleasant truth that  Experience is the Mistress of Feels  What's got over the Devil's Back is spent under his Belly  THE Devil is the Enemy of mankind and the Parent of Vice and whatever is done by his instigation cannot thrive for God prospers not the evil doer Money honestly earned and procured with honour will do a man credit and be the means of his getting more but illgotten wealth never does the possessor any good When  men know the difficulty of getting money they are naturally careful of it and are seldom seen to lavish it away but those who get it by fraud by oppression or extortion seldom put any value on it and waste it in the same vicious way in which they got it  Light come light go  The punishment inflicted by Heaven on illgotten wealth is that natural waste of it which gave rise to this Proverb and persons have lived to see that fortunes amassed by unfair dealing by cards by gambling by oppression and extortion when left to the next heir have been dissipated in riot and debauchery whereas those which are honestly and honourably acquired have established a family for many generations God has been pleased to prosper the undertakings of such a house and they have been the pride of their relations and the country round them  Riches are undoubtedly enviable but they cannot be enjoyed with comfort and certainly lose that zest that naturally attends them when they are acquired with credit  Sweet is the bread we earn  And whyBecause we eat it in a spirit of independence conscious that we have honestly obtained it are beholden only to our own industry for it and that we have not procured it by oppressing the unfortunate or extorting it from the ignorant by grinding the face of the poor or acquiring  it at the expence of a family's happiness A man had better be poor than rich by unfair meansPoverty is no way dishonourable if the poor man is at the same time virtuous for virtuous poverty is in the estimation of all wise and good men far more respectable than the possession of illgotten wealth As a competency or sufficiency of money to procure the necessaries and comforts of life is however what all men are justifiable in looking for let us do it by our own industry and rendering ourselves serviceable to mankind for "the Diligent hand God maketh rich" Let that industry be honest and praiseworthy such as will bear an enquiry into and depend on it wealth so acquired will always be found the most lasting for the Psalmist says "I have been young and now am old yet saw I never the righteous forsaken or his seed begging their bread" What satisfaction can a man have in such property as he knows he has cheated his neighbour ofHis conscience will be ever flinging his iniquity in his face be the worst of upbraiders and deprive him of that real comfort and enjoyment which the honourable acquisition of wealth brings with it  Look at the scene before usa young gentleman dissipating his fortune in company with bad women and gamblers where he is plundered as the painter supposes of that fortune his ancestor  acquired by fraud As the Devil was the instigation of such an acquisition he is here shewn to be the cause of its dissipation for nothing but the Devil the parent of wickedness could induce a woman the loveliest of the human race so far to dishonour herself as to associate with the abandoned and become their partners in vice  Rogues they say are generally true to each other but it does not appear to be the case here for she is picking the pocket of one of her associates It is folly indeed to expect any degree of honesty in those who have not the principle for nature will shew itself and those who are bred up in vice seldom depart from it  The further effects of Gambling are here depicted From the countenance of him with the empty purse we learn the distraction of his mindEager to win and happening to lose he loses his temper and his patience and with these his happiness For when a man loses more money than he can afford it is sure to make him wretchedThe winner may smile but the loser is miserableWhy then pursue such means as stand a chance to distress osIt must be infatuation Indeed vice of every kind is little else than infatuation having no sound argument to support it From Evil Evil must arise for  What is got over the Devil's Back in spent under his Belly  Call me Cousin but Cozen me not  OF all kinds of vice I don't know any thing that deserves greater reprobation than Hypocrisy and yet nothing is more general in the world The hypocrite who carries two faces betrays you under the mask of friendship and is less to be forgiven than a highway robber The latter boldly attacks you and puts you on your defence but the hypocrite takes advantage of our goodnature  imposes on our credulity and injures us at the moment he gives us reason to expect a service He is as the painter has here represented to us a wolf in sheep's cloathing and as one who whilst he shakes us by the hand takes an opportunity to pick our pocket  The world is in general so deceitful and so fuli of dissimulation that the incautious are easily taken in and naturally suppose them to be their friends who in reality are their enemies The Flatterer is of this stamp though not of so gross a complexion and it behoves us to be as much upon our guard against a man of this description as a lurking enemy The misfortune is that selflove leads a person to court praise and be fond of flatterers and such as are expert in this art will do it in so sly and insinuating a manner as to make us believe that what they say is the real sentiments of their hearts The customary compliments in life are pleasing ingratiating and denote goodbreeding but when they degenerate into flattery to a sensible man they are fulsome and disgusting  When a man on a first acquaintance makes great professions of kindness always suspect him depend upon it he has some sinister view upon your property and if you are not upon your guard you  will probably find yourself hurt when you least expect it  Great familiarity and intimacy is highly improper on slight acquaintance it is scarcely prudent even between those who have long known each other for he who unbosoms himself to every one he meets stands a chance of having a dagger plunged in his breast  Indeed the integrity of mankind is so little to be relied on that a wise man will be cautious in all his words and never say that to his most intimate friend that he would not say to his bitterest enemy for a future disagreement may alienate the friendship of such a man and you may be sorry for having placed a confidence in him Every man should act so as not to put it in the power of any one to betray him and then he need not dread an enemy for whilst his secret is in his own breast it is his own fault if it be divulged  Sincere and truehearted friends are least given to compliment and ceremony if a man makes more of you than you either desire or expect be assured he hath cozened you already or means to it It is not that a man is obliged to speak unpalatable truths or say that to his friend he knows will offend him if he cannot say agreeable things let  him be silent but not a fawner or make great professions that are not sincere for  He that is full of Courtesy is full of Craft  I would stop such a man short and give him to understand that I saw thro' him by"A truce with your kindness my good Sir"  Call me Cousin but Cozen me not  ☞ See  Great Cry and Little Wool  Pride will have a Fall  THIS Proverb requires no interpretation conveying its moral literallybut pride however here alluded to by no means implies that commendable pride which dignifies and is essential to the character of a good man but that lordly ostentation that haughty demeanor in affluence which spurns at and contemns an inferior in birth fortune or situation and engrosses our  thoughts to the idle gratification of extravagant pleasureThis is the  Pride  that  will have a Fall  and herein will the scriptures be verified "Pride cometh before destruction and he that exalteth himself shall be abased"He that forgetting his own nature withholds from his distressed fellowcreature that relief he is able to afford and looks down on his humble lot with disdainthis pride will in all likelihood have a fall and he may one day experience the contemptuous treatment he has shewn to others and that without a friend to pity him  The upstart in our print nursed in the lap of ease whose father's death put him in possession of a fortune having launched into all the fashionable follies of the age embarked in a life of vice and voluptuous pleasure has here suffered an inconsiderate pride to lead him to the brink of a dreadful precipice See his reception of the wretched pauper his father's bounty had often fedhe casts on him a scornful lookthe sneer of contemptand that too at a moment when one step more must so fatally shew him his past errors In vain does this poor creature implore reliefin vain does the aged mendicant whose locks are silvered o'er by timein vain does he tell the son his sire's invariable goodnesshis constant charityIn vain he begs  that the same cause affluence may produce the same effectbenevolenceNodeaf to every thing but the impulses of his own vain mind he gives not a single mite to the famished wretch who regrets that with the means we do not always inherit an inclination to do good Age however which has furrowed his brow with wrinkles leaves him the pleasing comfort of a peaceful conscience and though in the midst of poverty he enjoys a placid serenity being under the immediate eye of Providence who turneth all things to our good whilst the other wrapt up in fancied greatness looks not a step before him but falls down the precipice his pride had led him to What are then the consequences By this precipice we are to understand the downfal of Pride when Dissipation shall have stripped him of all the gay feathers with which he plumed himself when his wealth has taken wing to a new possessor when his mind shall be filled with remorse and horror and he be left naked and destitute This is often the fate of the haughty and the end of the proud man Then like the Prodigal Son he shall be feeding with swine and covet the situation of the hireling and the slave but even in this hopeless state there is a chance of redemption Misfortunes if we construe them right are messengers never sent without an errand  They either come to remind us of past sollies to correct the present or prevent the future Altho' then it is truly commendable to act with becoming spirit with such a pride as is consistent with our situations in life yet to exceed this is but to indulge a disposition of malevolence which can communicate no real satisfaction If it pleases Providence to bless us and raise us above the common level of mankind we should not presume on this but act our part accordingly We should consider the gifts of fortune as put into our hands for nobler purposes than merely to gratify a sensual inclination We are to use them as a trust committed to our care and dispense them so as to do all the good we can If we are insolent in the possession of them selfish in their disposal and lavish them on ourselves alone let us fear the consequences and dread the time when we may see an end of them for sooner or later  Pride will have a Fall  Tread on a Worm and it will Turn  THIS Proverb is generally though erroneously used as a plea by those who study to gratify revenge for any trivial injury they may conceive they have sustained but this is by no means the moral we should draw from it or that conclusion which calm reflection will justifyWhen to indulge a vicious inclination we wound the ease of a neighbour either by defaming his  character invading his property or disturbing the peace of his family it is but a sorry excuse to say "he has injured me  Tread on a worm and it will Turn"  There is a very material difference between just resentment and unlawful revenge It is certainly the part of an honest and upright mind to shew a proper contempt a consistent resentment at whatever arraigns the honor or integrity of our principles and to turn tho' in adversity when thus trod upon by even the splendid sons of affluence to endeavour as far as our situation and circumstances will admit to avoid a renewal or continuance of such injuries as may convert a proper resentment into inconsiderate revenge"Love your enemies do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you" was an injunction of our blessed Saviour and however difficult its practice may seem it certainly is within every one's power if not to do good at least to do no harm to his enemy Having said thus much on the misapplication of this Proverb and the perversion of the sentiment it contains let us examine its real tendency and what it is meant to inculcate It is meant then to teach us that how trifling how abject how insignificant soever persons may appear to us at the moment we tread upon them a change  of fortune and a poignant recollection of injuries may render their turning on us serious indeed Let us look round us and we shall find many who have either by the long pursuits of honest industry the death of others superior abilities or unexpected causes risen from the vale of indigence to the height of competence if not to the pinnacle of affluenceThen it is they will turnthen will they withhold those offices of friendship they would otherwise have done us and of which we may stand in need then it is they will recollect that we had not done by them when in our power as we would then be done by  The hoary veteran in our print constrained by penury and want implores charity under the walls of that very citadel his earlier days saw him bravely defendingA golden chain or a wooden leg were the extremes of his hope and fear Poor fellowhe has got the latterAn imperious Turk enjoying the blessings of a peace which the other's toils and services have assisted to secure swings fearless and undisturbed in all the pomp of eastern magnificence and indulges every wish a splendid affluence can create He passes the supplicating soldier without attention without bestowing the slightest token of commiseration and without thinking that tho' he does no good he may do  harm he treads upon the dog the faithful companion of his master's fortuneThe arm which once bore the firelock to defend a just act now shoulders the crutch to resent a haughty one and tacitly says  Love me love my  dogbut hurt my dog hurt  me  Even the slave who follows him is infected with his master's pride and by the sneer upon his countenance illustrates the Proverb  Trim Tram Like Master like Man  Aesop tells us of the successful efforts made by the grateful mouse to rescue the embarrassed lion of the bee's effecting the dove's escape from the fowlerboth from the recollection of former services Though he meant by this to inculcate the principles of gratitude yet is shews us the advantages we may one day derive from objects which comparatively with ourselves appear trifling and insignificant By no means then despise the poor we may in them hereafter find a friend on some occasion of our lives but this we cannot expect if we have given cause to the contrary for  Tread on a Worm and it will Turn  Charity begins at Home  THIS Proverb has been generally misunderstood and misapplied It has been conceived to allude to the folly of giving to others what we want ourselves and covetous men have used it in justification of their own selfishness We here see an instance of it A hungry pauper has just received a mess of pottage from the hands of benevolence and two or three poor wretches as hungry  as himself are craving part of it but he is deaf to their solicitations and steels his heart against their wants It is not that a man is expected to give away what he is going to eat to any vagrant that may ask him but there is a method of refusing an alms that reflects no discredit on the refuser Selfpreservation is the first law of nature and we are justifiable in providing food for ourselves and families but that being done a good christian and one who can feel for the distresses of another will naturally bestow a little of what he can spare to those to whom Fortune has not been so bountiful as to himself He who is poorest has always something to spare and a cup of cold water given in the spirit of charity will mark the disposition of the giver To take care of ourselves and families and provide against an evil day is certainly the duty of every man In this sense charity may be said to  begin at home  As a man should be just before he is generous so should he be prudent before he is charitable that is to say there is no more room for a person in debt to be generous than there is for him to be charitable whilst his family is unprovided for But if charity in this sense should  begin  at home it is not necessary it should  end  there also The provision we are to  make for ourselves is not to be boundless When we enjoy fully the necessaries of life and some of its comforts we should be willing to contribute to the necessities of others impart those comforts where we can and not suffer our unlimited wants to be an excuse for uncharitableness  God is bountiful to  us  and we should be so to our  fellowcreatures  Was a man to live for himself alone he would be the most selfish of all animals Charity is the characteristic or distinctive mark of a christian St Paul says that void of Charity we are nothing but "as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal" alluding to those who are all words make great professions of kindness and perform not a single act of benevolence Charity is in fact so godlike a virtue that our religion teaches us "it shall cover a multitude of sins" But charity in this sense is not limited to giving away part of our substance but to that love of our fellowcreature as would lead us to study his interest "Charity" says St Paul "suffereth long and is kind is not given to revenge Charity envieth not covets no man's property Charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up" that is boasts not of its merits but is humble and meek and "behaveth not itself unseemly" In short it is tenderhearted feels  for the calamities of the unfortunate and relieves them where it can does it from a conviction of the natural weakness of mankind acts from what it feels itself reasons from its own wants and in the true sense of the Proverb originates in its own nature and  begins at Home  It's an Ill Wind Indeed that blows Nobody Good  THIS is addressed to those who despond in order to teach them philosophy and shew them that whatever is is best there is no event in life but what tends to some good purpose and that even misfortunes are not without their uses There is a superintending Providence who overlooks our actions whose ways are higher than  our  ways and  his  thoughts than  our  thoughts and who frequently suffers evil to happen that good may arise Often are the righteous afflicted that their patience may be tried as was the case with Job and often are calamities sent into the world to alarm mankind and bring them back from the paths of sin and folly into those of virtue  The ways of Heav'n are dark and intricate  Puzzl'd with mazes and perplex'd with errors  Our understanding traces them in vain  Lost and bewilder'd in the fruitless search  Nor knows with how much art the windings run  Nor where the regular confusion ends  ADDISON'S CATO  This Proverb then teaches men patience and resignation under the worst of circumstances and enables them to stem that tide of sorrow that would otherwise too often overpower them  In common events all tend to some good If too much rain floods the low lands it enriches the high ones and if too much drowth burns up the high grounds it drys and does a great deal of good to the low ones A flood that shall be beneficial to the farmer shall be injurious to the  miller so that if any thing shall occur that may be detrimental in one case we are not to repine if it proves beneficial in another but we are bound to wait these events without murmuring at the dispensations of Providence who does good to all men in turn but reconcile ourselves to any seeming misfortune and from an opinion that it is an act of Heaven who has something in view above our capacities to discern kiss the rod that chastises us and praise the hand that holds it  The painter has rather taken an unfavourable view of this truth he has exhibited here a scene of distress and a number of wretches profiting by it A high wind has thrown a ship upon a rock and it becomes a wreck Part of the cargo has floated ashore and the inhuman inhabitants are eager to enjoy the plunder Whilst some are carrying off part others are running to take away more Cruel as such conduct is it is too common on the seacoast and he has described the unfeeling disposition of the plunderers by the joy he has painted in their countenances If there is any degree of cruelty greater than another it is this of robbing the distressed and taking pleasure in the calamity of others I will close this subject with an epigram suitable to the occasion  Honest Tim and his wife once to sea took a trip  When a sudden cross wind overset the light ship  Hand in hand over deck went this couple together  Susan sank like a stone Tim swam like a feather  Thank my stars says the man just arriv'd from the flood  'Tis an ill wind  indeed  that blows  nobody  good  ☞ See  Every Cross has its Inscription  What's Bred in the Bone will never Out of the Flesh  THIS strongly shews the force of all example and the evil tendency of bad ones If we take a glance round us we shall in general find that though as Gay says  Learning was ne'er entailed from son to son  yet Vice is in some measure hereditary We shall see the children of the most abandoned treading  through prevalence of example and for want of good advice in the footsteps of their parents and becoming literally  Chips of the old Block  Let us not however witness this sad truth without being ourselves imitativenot of the bad but of the good qualities of our relatives and associates It is in our younger years that we attract those habits that either sweeten or embitter our future lives Our minds when young are like tinder they will catch any spark whether emitted by Virtue or by Vice and it is to be lamented that the latter emits them more than the former  With early Virtue plant the breast  The specious arts of Vice detest  The worthy youth who carefully shuns the company of the wicked and the irreligious who contemplates with serious attention the many blessings his friends enjoy from the practices of virtue will not be contaminated Example will not to such a mind render vice familiar but if he avoids the society of those who will inculcate in him virtuous principles and associates with those who will engraft ignoble ones he will insensibly contract a habit that he may afterwards wish to abandon but in vain and find  when too late that  What's bred in the bone will never out of the flesh  Our painter has illustrated this truth forcibly The man in the stocks at once shews the cause and its effects Cards and dice the forerunners of greater vices have brought him thereLoss produced quarrels quarrels punishment and the necessity of securing him Happy would it be should this be the worst consequence of a destructive attachmentNo his cards box and dice beside him tell us that his present ignominy will not induce him to abandon them His father was a gambler too and to supply his losses invaded the property of others for which he forfeited his life to the laws of his country See him hanging on a gibbet on the hill behind This son was then an infant His mother poor creature the partner of his father's sorrows though not of his guilt the law being satisfied and she a widow  Bent o'er her babe her eyes dissolv'd in dew  The big drops mingling with the milk he drew  Gave the sad presage of his future years  The Child of Misery she baptiz'd in tears  Grief overcame hershe died leaving her orphan to the protection of an uncle who inherited his brother's vices See him just quitting the publichouse  not from inclination but necessity to disgorge the quantity of liquor he had there swallowed and to return "as a dog to his vomit" Nor will he probably leave it till flushed with liquor he shall sally forth to commit some desperate deed Can we notice his shocking suspensions of reason and not believe it possible that this man's end will be like his brother's not credit the assertion that the son will in time follow both the uncle and the father  Our painter has further illustrated the Proverb by the brood of ducks which have been hatched by a hen and who forsaking her wing and following the bent of nature have taken to the water amid all the fright and anxiety of the mother for their safety The fighting cocks assixed as a sign under the grapes whisper also that immoderate drinking often sets the best friends and relations at variance for  When the Wine's in the Wit's out  It behoves us therefore to avoid it and by associating with none but good and virtuous men contract no unworthy habit but seeing the progression from drunkenness to ignominious death and the dreadful effects of bad examples endeavour to avoid them for the Proverb says and the young ducks and gamecombatants declare the same that  What's bred in the bone will never out of the flesh  Set a Beggar on Horseback and he will ride to the Devil  THIS Proverb has an affinity with the last shewing its meaning in another sense but has rather a worldly than a moral tendency It implies that put a man out of his natural sphere and he will act like a fool We seldom if ever see a proper consistency preserved by men that have been suddenly and greatly raised in life Their  actions correspond with their ideas which seldom if ever alter Let a man be lowbred and his ideas will be groveling Take a woman from her kitchen marry her to a Duke and she will ever savour of the greasepot In short  What's bred in the bone will never out of the fleshIt is impossible to make a silk purse of a sow's ear  For as Solomon says of a sinnerA vulgar fellow will "return like a dog to his vomit or a sow to her wallowing in the mire"  The painter in the scene he has represented seems to allude to the moral sense of this Proverb that a man bred up in vice will gradually make greater strides till he brings destruction on his head Beggars have no idea of riding but that of galloping as fast they can go He is supposed to have the care of a gentleman's horse for a few minutes with orders as he was warm to walk him up and down that he might not take cold Instead of this he mounts him flogs the poor animal into full speed and regardless of the consequences if he is not going to the Devil himself is in a fair way of sending a poor old woman there with all her sins upon her head having rode over her  Under this sense of the Proverb we are taught never to employ immoral or improper persons in any of our affairs the former will be likely to injure  us and the latter to disgrace us for independent of any injury we may sustain whatever wrong they do the blame will be sure to fall upon us It is under this reasoning that the law makes the master responsible for the conduct of his servant when that servant acts by his master's orders  It is the height of folly for a man to undertake an office he is not capable of but if he is presuming enough to do it the fault is in his employer who ought to make himself acquainted with the integrity and abilities of those he employs  Fortune in her wanton moments has been often favourable to lowbred men and raised them from a state of poverty to a degree of affluence that has answered no other purpose than to turn their brain Far from carrying their success in life with diffidence and modesty they become arrogant and assuming and instead of gaining friends create a number of enemies who not only despise them but laugh at them  How often have we seen the children of poor parents whom Fortune has smiled on when they have grown rich despise those parents because they were poor and instead of assisting them in their advanced years and letting them share the blessings they enjoy themselves have deserted them and  looked down on their humble state with contempt What do such children deserveNot only the detestation of all good men but the vengeance of the Almighty and be assured sooner or later vengeance will overtake them for  Set a Beggar on Horseback and he will ride to the Devil  A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed  BY the laws both of God and man we are bound to assist our fellowcreatures to the utmost of our power particularly when they need our assistance and if we are not enabled by fortune to do them all the good we wish there are times when a little aid will do a man a great deal of good and these are the times we should study to render ourselves of service Humanity is a godlike  principle Our Creator is always planning the good of mankind and we should imitate him as far as our abilities enable us Indeed if we expect his favour we must be friendly to those about us If the uncharitable man did but once experience the heartfelt pleasure which the humane man feels within himself when he has relieved the distressed and soothed the desponding mind he would never miss an opportunity of doing a good action where such an action was in his reach to perform To receive the grateful thanks and blessings of those we relieve is to a sensible mind a sufficient compensation for any trouble we may take or any money we may expend in doing them a kind office What is the use of money if it be not to gratify and please ourselvesand surely there is no pleasure equal to that of being a friend to the unfortunate There are few persons but what spend some idle money and that which they throw away would gladden many a poor man's heart If we time our charity a small sum given on certain occasions will do far greater service than double the sum at others  We have here an instance of a humane man visiting the house of Poverty An old man in the decline of life lying on a sick bed supported by  the labour of a widowed daughter and who having children of her own the little she earns divided among them is scarce sufficient to keep life together The scanty meal her industry is capable to procure shared among the whole is not sufficient to satisfy the hunger even of a sick man Her love for a blind and aged father and an infantfamily makes her inability to afford them necessaries a heartbreaking affliction In the midst of this distress God sends a benevolent young gentleman to their ragged cottage The natural humanity and fellowfeeling of this stranger whom chance brought to their door led him to enquire the state of this poor family and we see him at that moment when her father and children were crying for food without being able to procure it giving them money and relieving them in this hour of necessity The gratitude of this poor family is evident in their countenances it affects the heart of their benefactor draws tears from his eyes and is a proof of the Proverb that  A Friend in  Need  is a Friend  indeed  Imitate then this young gentlemando all the good offices you canstudy for opportunities to do goodRemember that he who is poorest has always something to spare▪ and something that  another wants and if you bestow that something with a willing heart you will not only have a reward in Heaven but the good word of all your acquaintance and the blessings of those you relieve  I will close this subject with the following bonmotA man told an acquaintance he had been to visit a poor friend in prison"Then he must be a valuable one" replied the latter for a  Friend in  Need  is a  Friend  indeed  Every Cross has it's Inscription  THAT isEvery Calamity has an End in viewProvidence never afflicts us in vain Misfortunes are ministers sent to warn us they rouse reflection on our past conduct and awaken the heart to a just sense of its situation Divines say "We may often read the sin in its punishment"There is no calamity that does not point to some of our actions and shew us the sin by reflection  but in the vicissitudes and crosses of life instead of interpreting their causes properly and considering why they are inflicted we are too apt to attribute them to the wickedness of men or the natural course of things and employ our thoughts wholly on the means of extrication We are certainly justifiable in studying to avoid misfortunes and to extricate ourselves from those we may chance to be involved in but a religious man will at the same time turn his thoughts within his own breast consider how far he has deserved the correction kiss the rod that chastises him be grateful to Providence that he has left a way to escape and act like the philosopher who having broke his leg thanked God it was not his neck  Whenever therefore we meet misfortunes let us study to improve by them and correct our livesRely upon it Providence in the infliction has some view to our good They are never sent but to answer some wise purpose and that too a purpose by which we might profit if we calmly and deliberately consider them  The distressed object in our print floating on the raft from the ship we see going to pieces on the rock appears in all the energy of devout prayerHe seems to call to remembrance his past offences and with pious resolution to promise his  God a reformation Though the deep waters are around himtho' the surging waves break in upon himyet the eye of Providence is over him and as his repentance is sincere his preservation shall be secure He may think his situation peculiarly hardanother ship in sight with a fair wind and he the only one washed overboard from his own shipBut let us not arraign the unerring judgment of our Maker he is omniscient and knoweth all things past present and to come The ship in sight though tight and right before the wind will never reach her destined port she will founder and every soul on board will be launched unprepared into the dreadful gulph of EternityA few moments and the wreck of the ship from which he has escaped will be beaten to pieces and all the crew shall perish whilst a fishingboat shall convey this repentant mortal safe on shore and teach him from the experience of his present distress to amend his future life bless Providence for his miraculous escape the singular protection afforded him and acknowledge that  Every Cross has its Inscription  The civetcat had once lost by accident that part for which it is hunted by men He repined at his hard fate arraigned the judgment which decreed it and could not see any advantage he derived from  such a loss Poor shortsighted animal Whilst he is thus lamenting his fate and complaining to a fellowcreature he had just met of the hardness of his lot the hounds were heard and the one fell a sacrifice to their pursuits for the possession of that which the loss of had fortunately preserved the other In short let us be patient under our afflictions and God will give us a happy issue from them for be assured troubles are never sent in vain and though our shortsighted reasoning may not shew us immediately the wise end of our sufferings yet all things happen for the best and in a little time will misfortune's bud blossom and bring forth that fruit which a wise and prudent man will not only gather but profit by"  My  thoughts" says God to man  and not  your  thoughts nor  your  ways  my  ways for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are  my  ways higher than  your  ways and  my  thoughts than  your  thoughts  and so certain is it saith the Proverb that  Every Cross hath its Inscription  Great Cry and Little Wool  SAYS the Proverb when the Devil is shearing of hogs they making a great noise and affording no wool alluding to those who make great professions of kindness without the least inclination of doing what they say This is too visible in the great world I mean among persons of rank so that it is a common saying "There is little dependance  on a Courtier's promise"  Full of Courtesy full of Craft  The painter has here given us a good idea of noise without profit the shrieking of the Devils the squeaking of the hogs the rustling and whistling of the storm and the clattering of the magpie  It is related of the late Duke of Newcastle who was prime minster that no man was freer of his promises and less disposed to perform them A Major whom the Duke thought proper to receive returned in the time of war from his regiment with the loss of his leg on his waiting on the Duke the Duke flew to embrace him with"My dear Major I hope I see you well""Indeed my Lord" replied he "you don't for I am out of spiritsI have lost my" "Say no more my dear Major" said the Duke stopping his mouth with his hand and conceiving it to be some promotion he had missed "Say no more I will give you a better""That's impossible my Lord" returns the Major "for I have lost my leg"  A man who values his word and wishes for the confidence of his friends is very cautious in his promises but when he does promise endeavours all he can to fulfil them It is this integrity that makes men respectable and gives them weight and consequence with those who know them but those who  are profuse in professions of services be assured never mean to perform them  So again many a man will tell you with a squeeze of the hand he has only to lament that it is not in his power to serve you when if he had it in his power he would be the last that would do it  This Proverb alludes also to those vain boasters who arrogate to themselves a merit they are no ways entitled to Such men conscious of their defects and ashamed that the world should see them endeavour to conceal those defects by boasting of an opposite virtue A liar will tell you that he could not form his tongue to a lie though it was to save his life when at the same time he is telling a numberSo an uncharitable man will often boast of doing some trifling act of good and preface it with"I believe I was made with different feelings from other men for I can't pass by an object of compassion without relieving him not if it was the last penny I had"  All this is ridiculousTruth and sincerity are the best stamps of a good character and a little knowledge of the world is sufficient to discern the true from the counterfeit  Never then boast of a virtuelet your good actions speak for themselves As a tree is known by its fruit so is a good man by the good deeds he  performs"It is not every one" saith our blessed Saviour "that saith unto me Lord Lord that shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doth the will of my Father that is in heaven" The contrite penitent that bowed down with a recollection of his sin and his own unworthiness struck upon his breast and cried "Lord be merciful unto me a sinner" was in the eyes of God a much more respectable man than the boasting Pharisee who proud of a few good actions looked upon himself as superior to his fellowcreatures and claimed the favour of Heaven on account of his own merits Sound not then your own merits for  He must live far from neighbours who is fain to praise himself  Do all the good you can but let the satisfaction of having done that good be your desired reward that is when you give alms "let not even your righthand know what your left hand doth" do it not through ostentation or love of being noticed but thro' a spirit of philanthrophy and fellowfeeling and in all your intercourse in life promise cautiously but keep that promise inviolably for he that promises and does not perform yields a  Great Cry  but  little Wool  ☞ See  Call me Cousin but cozen me not  Take away my Good Name and take away my Life  THE character of a man is of such importance to his wellbeing in the world that to rob him of it is perhaps more cruel than to take away his life By murdering a man we deprive him indeed of existence but our malevolence there finds an end he is then beyond the reach of malice and perhaps becomes possessed of a state of  bliss but by taking from him his good name whilst living we deprive him of his best friend a friend that would never forsake him but protect him through a stormy and adverse life To rob a man of his character therefore is turning him unarmed amidst a number of enemies an act more cruel than murder and its wantonness is equal to its barbarity for whilst the slanderer is mangling the reputation of another he is doing himself disservice The sensible part of mankind soon discern his design and though they may censure the person defamed they will condemn the defamer  "Good name in man or woman" says Shakespeare  "Is the richest jewel of their lives  "He that steals my purse steals trash 'tis something nothing  "Twas mine'tis hisand has been slave to thousands  "But he that filches from me my good name  "Robs me of that which not enriches him  "And makes me poor indeed"  Impressed with this idea the painter has represented a scene wherein an honest old man is accused  before a magistrate of crimes of which he never was guilty and a villain behind the pillar is enjoying the accusation That the countenance is an index of the mind he has here fully shewn honesty being pictured in the countenance of the accused and villainy in that of his accusers The prisoner appeals only to the integrity of his heart"God says he "is witness to my innocence I have no upbraiding conscience on my character do I depend for support it is my only resource  Take away my Good Name and take away my Life  His guiltless heart is his best defence he needs no evidence in his favour the prevaricating accusation destroys itself and the judge seeing through the conspiracy acquits the accused and condemns his accusers  Truth shall o'er ev'ry artifice prevail  Whilst all the schemes of fraud and falsehood fail  The flimsy cheat wise judges soon descry  Those men will rob that scruple not to lie  Be cautious then how you speak of any one at least be doubly careful not to speak worse of another than he deserves Charity will often induce us to lean to the side of mercy and urge us when a man's character is demanded of us to represent it rather better than worse especially if his livelihood  depends upon the character we give himThis is frequently the case with servants and herein we cannot be too delicate Justice enjoins us to speak truth but that truth should be tempered with candour and softened by humanity We are bound in honour to give such persons the character they merit but we should not suffer either anger or resentment to aggravate their offences and swell their faults into crimes their frailties into vices  In the other sense of the Proverb that which our painter more particularly alludes to the act of misrepresenting a character or giving an unjust one is truly unpardonable it betrays a littleness of mind and baseness of soul Philanthrophy or to love one another is a noble principle and what our religion teaches What then are we to think of those who so far from trying to sweeten the ways of life will take pains to embitter them and instead of helping a man will deprive him of those means that will protect and defend him For what is life without a character  Take away my Good Name and take away my Life  Much Coin Much Care  TO speak in disparagement of coin or money would look only like envying the good fortune of others for as the rich can command some enjoyments out of the reach of the poor money has always been considered as a blessing and to acquire money has been the constant study of mankind But when we call money a blessing it is necessary to draw the line for though riches bring comforts  they likewise bring cares and there is no real enjoyment in any wealth that is not properly made use of We are taught by our religion that the goods of this life are entrusted to us by our Creator for the purpose of doing good Was all mankind equally rich it would interrupt the order of society and prevent men from being useful and serviceable to each other God therefore has established the poor to be of use to society but having done this he has made some men rich in order to return those services by protection and good offices and if a man uses his wealth to any other purpose he betrays the trust that Providence has reposed in him and counteracts the will of Heaven  "Learn to be content" says St Paul "in that state of life in which it has pleased God to place you" and be assured that whether you are poor or rich you are equally respectable in God's eyes provided you act uprightly in the station of life you are in Competence is the only wealth a man should covet that is a sufficient income to support him in the rank of life in which he stands and afford him the necessaries and comforts attendant on that rank All beyond this is trouble and anxiety and if his heart is set upon further wishes they are only a torment to him The painter has set this forth in the scene before us We see here pictured a man  shut up in his closet counting his money conceived by the ship above him to be acquired by merchandize We will suppose it honestly gained but as his heart seems centered in his gold it robs him of his enjoyment It is not a lock or strong box that can set his mind at easeHe dreads not only shipwrecks and thieves but is alarmed at every step he hears Even the entrance of his old trusty valet with a letter alarms him and all his fear is painted on his countenance This man has not a peaceful moment independent of the anxiety arising from loss in business shipwrecks and the like he is in constant dread of losing part of what he has and this dread is a continual torment and likely to end only with his life But Death which frees a man from all cares is here seen at the window lifting up the sash and taking from him the whole In such a case how much happier would this man have been had he cultivated in his breast a spirit of benevolence and could have brought himself to distribute that superfluous treasure he is here supposed to have hoarded among such distressed objects as must have fallen within his knowledge By relieving these he would have stood in no want either of bolts or boxes but would have "laid up a treasure in heaven where thieves do not break through nor steal"  We are here taught also not to repine at a circumscribed fortune but make the best of our situation and if we have not an income equal to our expences to proportion our expences to our income and  Cut our Coat according to our Cloth  If a man cannot afford a joint of meat at his table every day let him be satisfied with it every other day and know that  A contented Mind is a continual Feast  Let him take a view of his own neighbourhood and he will see that if there are some men richer than himself there are some also poorer and that his own situation is not the most wretched Every man is the centre of a circle some of a smaller some of a greater and if in that circle of life he does his duty as a good man ought he is equally respectable with him who acts like himself in a larger circle If he has fewer indulgencies he has fewer cares though money may bring luxuries it brings also anxietyfor  Much Coin Much Care  Hedges have Eyes and Walls have Ears  THIS is a Proverb to teach worldly policy and put the incautious upon their guard with respect not only to their words but their actions Hedges are no greater security against a prying eye than is a wall against a listening ear As it is easy to see through a hedge and discover what is  doing  on the other side so is it as easy to hear on one side of a wall what is  saying  on the  other The young gentleman who is here in the garden planning an elopement with the maid of his heart little suspects that he is overheard by her father  If a man wishes to keep any thing secret he should not only be upon his guard against hedges and walls but be cautious before whom he speaks whether they are persons that can forestall or frustrate his intentions or children and servants that can carry the tale for  Little Pitchers have great Ears  that is children are often more attentive to what we say than we naturally suppose they are  This Proverb has a reference also to our actions teaching us circumspection in what we do and reminding us t we are open to the eyes of a discerning and illnatured world who perhaps will not put the most favourable constructions on them It is a difficult thing I allow always to speak and act so as to avoid censure but it is absolutely necessary not to indulge ourselves in such acts as will not bear the test of daylight under an idea that we are in the dark and no eye can see us Many a man has done that under favour of a disguise or from an opinion that he is not known that he would not have done but under such circumstances  Though he may think proper to run this risk and escape the censure of the world yet I presume he need not be told that there is above an Eye that seeth and to whom all hearts are disclosed an Eye that let a man's actions be as specious and equivocal as they may will penetrate into the recesses of the heart and read not only a his actions through every degree of dissimulation but his very intentions And as his future happiness depends on the integrity of his heart if he has any regard for himself he will conduct himself so as to stand justified in the eye of Heaven and so doing if he makes his heart and his tongue speak the same language he will go the surest way to avoid the illnatured remarks of a censorious world  Act in short and speak as if the eyes and ears of your greatest enemy were open to what you say and do and be assured you will not act or speak improperly and there will be little fear of either your words or your actions being misconstrued A philosopher being told that certain persons spoke ill of him replied "I will then act in such a manner that no one shall believe them"That is he would give the lie to all their assertions  In short a wise man will consider himself as set upon a hill open to the view of all about him or being in garden where  Hedges have Eyes and Walls have Ears  Cruelty's a Tyrant always attended with Fear  CRUELTY is so repugnant to our nature that every human being revolts at it and Conscience which always tells us when we do either right or wrong upbraids the cruel man so strongly that his sin is more than he is able to bear he not only fears the resentment of the world but dreads his own thoughtsThe Cruelty I allude  to is inhumanity to our fellowcreaturesNature has implanted in our breasts a fellowfeeling for mankind and nothing but a savage disposition brought on by habit and actuated by revenge and selfinterest will lead a man to acts of cruelty  A barbarity of disposition a ferocity of temper is too often inculcated by practices which though in our childhood may be considered as of little moment produce in our riper years very serious consequences This passion like a snowball will gather as it rolls and gain strength by age It is the duty therefore of parents and all who have the bringing up of children to check a cruel disposition in its spring and to fix the dam remembering that although water  "creeps on by slow degrees  "Yet brooks make rivers rivers swell to seas"  Nero the Roman Emperor we are told pleased himself when a child with tormenting flies and other insects committing greater cruelties as his years increased from torturing of insects he proceeded to birds from birds to brutes from brutes to mankind Then he revelled in barbarityand we find his insatiable cruelty led him to rip open his mother in order to see the place of his conception When we read of such dreadful examples of encouraging a childish propensity to acts of  wanton cruelty must we not wish that youth "would learn to be wise from others arm" and smother the diabolical passion as it rises Let us reflect that Providence has given to every living creature a sense of feeling that if we tread upon a worm it feels a pang as great as when a giant diesand let us remember the frogs' observation in the fable to the boys that were pelting them"Though it may be  sport  to  you  it is  death  to  us  "  It was the dignity of Nero's station his tyranny and the pusallinimity of the Romans at that time which prevented their resentment of his crueltiesbut there was no barrier against the terrors of an evil consciencehe was not without his punishment even in this worldRemorse stung him to the quickhe lived the remainder of his life wretchedly and died miserably  Vain are a man's titlesvain his wealthvain his pursuits of pleasurethe guilty mind has no enjoymentneither rank nor riches can steel the breast against the stings of conscience"The wicked fleeth when no man pursueth"He flies like a hunted deer from the terrors of his own mind and the dread of future punishment drives him to despair  But we will contemplate the scene in viewNot more remorse filled Barnwell's mind when he had murdered his uncle than does the fratricide  before usJust HeavenWhat could induce him to kill his own brotherAn illfounded jealousyJealous of the imagined partiality of his father who poor man loved them both with equal fondness though he had not equal causeSuch acts the painter tells us arise from the instigation of the Evil Spirit whom he has pictured here enjoying the success of his temptation and grinning like Milton's Satan a horrid smileBut no sooner is the rash deed committed than reflection comes and conscience smitesStruck with the horror of his crime he stands aghastshudders at what he has done and all his terrors betray themselvesReflection comesbut comes too lateFear now assails himhe dreads the vengeance of Heaven and a thousand selfupbraidings complete his misery  Hasty men seldom want woe  A rash act is generally its own avenger and  What we do in Haste we repent at Leisure  If we would avoid then the stings and arrows of an avenging conscience let us "do to others as we would have them do to us" cherish within our bosoms a spirit of philanthropy love our fellowcreatures commiserate their misfortunes and never treat them with any degree of cruelty for  Cruelty's a Tyrant always attended with Fear  What can't be Cured must be Endured  OF all the virtues Patience is undoubtedly the greatest as it strives against and combats all our natural inclinations Every man covets his own happiness and where that happiness is wanting he who can sit down patiently under it and reconcile himself to his lot is truly a brave man  and a christian for our religion teaches us to be meek and patient under afflictions and to consider them as chastisements sent from Heaven to correct and make us better  If by repining and grieving at misfortunes we could in any wise remove or lessen them it might be right so to do but after having tried every lawful means to extricate ourselves from them should we find those means ineffectual it is our duty to submit and wait patiently for a change  It is in the power of men sometimes to relieve the distresses of the unfortunate and asswage their pains and when this can be done we are bound to do it And feeling heart will never need soliciting it will do it as a thing of course and be happy in the opportunity  There cannot surely be a greater calamity than blindness which brings on an inability to work for ourselves and robs us of independence and should this calamity be attended with poverty it is the very summit of all human afflictionWe can then only throw ourselves upon the mercy of our fellowcreatures and wait their charity with resignation Even such a misfortune if incurable must be indured We have here this completion of wretchedness before usa blind old pauper  wearing out a life in craving the alms of the benevolentPatient and resigned under this rod of affliction like a true christian he waits with temper till it shall please God to take him out of the world and thus ease him of his miseries for he can have no possible enjoyment here  To a good disposition what can give the mind more satisfaction than by endeavouring to alleviate this poor man's sorrows by a little of that spare money we so often squander away Persons who have received a religious education feel themselves obligated to relieve such objects when they fall in their way and we may see by the countenances of these children the effects of a religious education it has taught them to relieve the afflictions of others at the expence of what is most dear to themselves A little pocketmoney every child covets to have in order to gratify its little wants yet we see here that no sooner an object of real charity appears but their hearts take part in the distress and they voluntarily relieve him"Go and do thou likewise"  This Proverb teaches us also to make a virtue of necessity not to feel hurt at the little rubs we meet with in the world but to keep up our spirits push on through life as well as we can and  make the best of what we meet with We may endeavour to remove a stumblingblock that lies in our way but if it is out of our power to remove it let us leave it where it is and only take care in passing it not to tumble over it for  What can't the Cured must be Endured  Kick not against the Pricks  IT does not require any great depth of knowledge to determine what would be the consequence of a man's kicking against a number of sharp points Considering the Proverb then in a literal sense it seems to convey only a selfevident truth nothing but what nature herself suggestsBut look further into it and it is replete with moral and political instruction By  Kick not against  the Picks  then is understoodEnter into no contest with any one whose power of resistance is more than you can overcome "You but break your own teeth" said the File in the fable to the Serpent when it was endeavouring to revenge itself What are the usual consequences when a man of small pittance engages in an expensive suit at law with one of three times his income Whythat  the Weakest goes to the Wall  The law is so expensive and its subterfuges so many that those who have not sufficient money to support perhaps a  just  cause must give it up to another whose fortune will enable him even to uphold a  bad  one for  Might  too often  overcomes Right  To engage therefore in litigation under such circumstances is only  Kicking against the Pricks  and injuring ourselves Such likewise is every unequal controversy in life which is no other than contending with those who are better armed than ourselves  The bruiser before us a pupil of the Humphreys and Mendozas  Two noted bruisers or boxers  of the age elate with that success his acquired knowledge in boxing added to his athletic make has secured to him strips to resent the slightest affront It was in one of these rash quarrels which such vanity frequently subjected him to that his antagonist retreated to a guardhouse  within the walls of the citadel where the dispute had taken place Pride and rage as pictured in the bruiser's countenance at once assailed him closed his eyes against his danger deafened him to the remonstrances of the centinel and led him heedless of the levelled bayonet to advance on his enemy and run against its point The wound proves mortal and he benefits the world for the last time in his life namely in leaving behind him an example of the dangerous consequences of a rash opposition  Though in the contest we engage in we may expect to come off victorious from the justness of our cause from our strength our abilities or other rational considerations yet the influence of money the weapons with which our antagonist is armed his subtlety or other unexpected causes may shew us that we have only  kicked against the pricks  It concerns us therefore to be exceedingly circumspect how we enter into disputes that we maturely weigh every advantage of our opponent against our own and if we find him superior in influence tho' not in equity rather "bear the ills we know than fly to those we know not of" A wise man will rather lose a small sum than endeavour to recover it by law as by so doing he will be only following the vulgar phrase "Throwing good money after bad"  This Proverb teaches us also in another sense never to attempt a thing we are not masters of  Strive not against the Stream  unless you are satisfied to have your labour for your pains It is only waste of time anxiety disgrace and loss of trouble  In every action then of our lives let prudence dictate Suffer not a trifling injury to become a a serious wrong through a feeble attempt to redress it Lose not the substance like Aesop's dog in pursuit of the shadow  This greedy dog crossing a river with a piece of meat in his mouth saw his shadow in the water which he took for another dog with a piece of meat catching therefore at that he lost the piece he was in possession of  Avoid contention with those who are more powerful than yourself If a man affronts you and you cannot knock him down as Lord Chesterfield says never see the affront and always remember that it is not only dangerous but the very height of folly to  Kick against the Pricks  Custom is Second Nature  THIS Proverb is designed to shew the prevalence of Habit whether in good actions or bad Children says a philosopher are like blank paper we may write on them what we please and according to what we write that is according to the education or instruction we give them so shall we form their dispositions"Train up a child" says Solomon "in the way wherein he  should go and when he is oldhe will not depart from it"What we are accustomed to in youth becomes familiar to us in more advanced life and will then be as it were natural to us  The painter has drawn his illustration of this truth from a winterscene in the country that of scating on the ice and has shewn us that whilst those in years who have been used to shelter themselves from the inclemency of the weather shall shake with cold in the open air tho' wrapt up in furs and whilst one young man shall be blowing his fingers and shrinking from the cold another who has accustomed himself to the forst shall be chearfully scating regardless of the pinching season He teaches us also by the contrasted appearance of the beggarboy sliding even with fear whilst the young gentleman next him is scating away with courage that this exercise does not depend only on being able to endure the cold for one is as able to do that as the other but that the art of scating difficult as it may be is to be acquired only by practice and habit One stands firm and makes his way on an edge less than half an inch in thickness whilst the other can scarce keep his footing on a much broader basis This is the effect also of Custom having practised it long it is become natural to the former and he bears the  cold and travels on the ice with as much or more security than the latter can even on the groundSo is it in life whatever we are accustomed to becomes as it were our nature and we can do it with the greatest facility One man shall swim as well as a duck to whom water is a natural element whilst another cannot keep himself from drowning so will a bricklayer whose profession it is to roof houses run safe and unconcerned along the ridge of a roof whilst another unaccustomed to such practices shall not be able to keep his feet  If such be the force of Custom we see how necesssary it is to train up youth properly before improper habits have taken hold of them for such is the misfortune that  Habit is second Nature  and when once we have acquired a bad one it is not readily got the better of Every little ungain aukward trick a man shall acquire in his youth he will carry to the grave with himConsidering this Proverb then in a moral sense it is above all things requisite that good principles should be early instilled lest the natural proneness of mankind to evil should take root in him and in the course of years be so blended with his nature as not to be conquered  What's bred in the Bone will never out of the Flesh  is a maxim similar in allusion to the one before us and confirms the doctrine we have  laid down that Customs rooted in us by Habit will continue with us through life  Whatever we do therefore let us be careful not to acquire bad habits under an idea of dropping them when we please They are not so readily dropped as we imagine for the human frame is a machine that will often act involuntarily and pursue a bias to which it has been accustomed be that bias as injurious to its nature as it may  Upon the strength of this lesson also let us take courage and never be dismayed at the difficulties we meet with Such things as at first appear insurmountable by practice are often overcome and rendered easy for  Patience and Perseverance overcometh all things  "Eschew evil then and do good" and remember the words of Scripture that "He who holdeth out to the last shall be saved"That is to say Shun every evil way pursue the good and my life for it in the end you will have occasion to rejoice The good habits you acquire will insure you a respectable character through life and a peaceful conscience in your last moments and be assured every evil is to be subdued by a perseverance in welldoing for  Custom is second Nature  Creditors have better Memories than Debtors  THERE is a great deal of knowledge couched under these words and the Proverb may be taken in more senses than one In the literal sense it implies that Creditors are the more importunate as they find those who are in their debt unwilling to pay what they owe Indeed such is the misfortune of trade that unless a man will give credit he will have few customers and such  the disposition of the world that as things are estimated by appearances and men are respected in proportion to the figure they make in life they are naturally covetous of respect make the best appearance they can live to the very outside of their fortunes and willing as they may be to pay what they owe they often find themselves unable This distresses the tradesman who gives them credit makes him importunate in his applications and the debtor rather than acknowledge himself poor affects not to remember the debt he owes Of course it being the interest of the one to remind and that of the other to forget  Creditors  in pursuing their interest are said to  have better memories than Debtors  who wish to forget the obligation This is bad policy but such is the fact It would be far better and more honourable for a debtor to aknowledge what he owes and throw himself on the lenity of his creditor than to trifle with his character anger his applicant and induce him to take hostile measures against him  The engraver in the print before us has taken up the Proverb in this sense A man whose credulous mind and easy temper has led him to give long credit to the impoverishment of himself and whilst he has been administering to the comfort  of others his own circumstances have grown out at elbows and he is reduced to the necessity of wearing a threadbare coat In this state we see him humbly applying for payment to one who is in his debt and this man unthinking and merciless forgets or affects to forget that he owes him any thing and to carry on the farce and appear absorbed in thought suffers the dog to water against his leg as it were unnoticed He is here pictured as apart from his company conscious that an application of this kind would disgrace him and let him down in the eyes of his acquaintance with whom he has passed himself as a man of fortune  In a figurative sense the Proverb teaches that  none are so deaf as those that  won't  hear  Interest is the greatest perswasive to all worldly act and where interest leads the man to forget be assured he will not remember But when a man is thus artfully deaf and forgetful to all that is just and honourable let him remember that there are loud calls which he will be obliged to hear the calls of Law and the calls of Heaven and he will be sorry at having shut his ears to the whispers of reason and discretion  We are also shewn in another sense the eagerness of men to shut their ears to the applications  of their fellowcreatures to the plaintive woes of the poor the cravings of necessity and the cries of the wretched and surely he that can turn a deaf ear to such complainants must have a merciless disposition and an unfeeling heart The poor are ordained by Providence to be the creditors of the rich they have a natural demand on their liberality and charity and they who are deaf to such demands or affect not to remember the obligation are a disgrace humanity and undeserving of the name of man  In a further sense the Proverb teaches us the necessity of attending to the calls of conscience that great Creditor who if its demands are not satisfied in this life will bring a long account against us in the next an account which we shall then be unable to discharge for then it will be too late The debts of life are to be paid whilst we live If we do this conscientiously we shall quit the world unshackled and having paid the great debt of nature may hope to live in future bliss free and unincumbered as the heavenly host Pursuing this conduct we shall have nothing to fear though  Creditors have better memories than Debtors  The Master's Eye makes the Horse fat  A carrier ev'ry night and morn  Would see his horses eat their corn  This sunk the hostler's ails 'tis true  But thenhis horses had their due  Were we so cautious in all cafes  Great gains might rise from smaller places  GAY's fable of the Packhorse and the Carrier from which the above quotation is taken greatly supports  whence we should also learn an observance of the old adage  Never to do that by proxy which we can do ourselves  Those who are most benefited by and step are certainly most likely to attend to the proper execution of it for selfinterest is the prevailing feature of mankind Let a person have no interest in the business with which he is entrusted and you will find him far less attentive than one who derives an advantage from it  When the Cat's away the Mice will play  that is when the causes which excite our attention are removed the effects ceaseHad Gay's carrier trusted to the hostler it is to be questioned whether the horses under his care would have had their due as it would have "sunk the hostler's vails" and that mercenary consideration induces too many servants to prostitute their master's interest to a trifling and a paltry gain thence the prudence of being ourseves present when our business is doing For  the Master's eye makes the Horse fat  Not impertinent to this purpose is that story related by Gellius A fat man riding on a lean horse was asked how it came to pass that  he  was so fat and his  horse  so lean Because replied he  I  feed myself but my  sservant  feeds my horse  It is by overlooking those whom we employ that we secure ourselves from the impositions to  which confidence in unworthy servants and an absence when our business is transacting too frequently subjects us But this prudent caution this necessary inspection differs essentially from that distrustful disposition which betrays upon all occasions an aukward suspicion of an honest servant thus giving him cause to think his probity is doubted when in fact we are acting only with discretion We should consider our servants as our humble friends and though prudence directs us to prevent as much as we can the  possibility  of their doing us an injury benevolence teaches us to preserve a just medium so as not to wound a feeling heart by mean suspicions upon every slight appearance of  probability  Be politicbe as cautions as you willbut let them know as little as you can that you are so This will attach them to you this will make a servant unless he is very abandoned indeed shudder at the idea of abusing a generous confidence that he believes is placed in him  The farmer in our print has visited his fieldshe has made it his constant custom hence it betrays no suspicion of his reapers industry though in fact this was the sole motive of his presence His open honest deportment rather chears their labour than discourages it he meets them with  good words commends their diligence and has the satisfaction of seeing his work go well on  Whatever our situation in life is let us act our part well If masters let us excite in our dependants respect and love by betraying no groundless suspicions and yet in doing this let us not lose sight of prudent care nor forget the practice of Chaucer's theory  If they are good why e'en praise them if bad then find fault  If servants let us so demean ourselves that we may never sear a master's eye yet let us not presume so much upon ourselves as to be offended at that inspection which his prudent cares may dictate for his excuse and our consolation remembering in either station that  "the Master's eye makes the Horse fat"  Necessity has no Law  LAWS are made to keep unruly men in order and prevent their doing wrong and punishment is sure to follow when these laws are transgressed or broken through but necessity has always been a powerful pleader in extenuation of guilt Not only in the eye of the law but in the eye of reason  the will is  ever  taken for the deed  and  they who cannot as they will must will as they may  that is must do as they can It is under this consideratio that the law will allow one man to kill another if he cannot otherwise escape with his own life but that the killer may never use this necessity as a pretence it is expected that the person so urged shall flee from his enemy as far as he can but when he can fly no further and is pressed by a sword or other deadly weapon against a wall he may then to save his own life kill his pursuer if he can and the act will not be called murder  By the same mode of reasoning there are few things which a man is compelled to that the laws either human or divine will punish him for doing but he is to be careful and not attribute to necessity what might have been avoided  Our painter has supposed a case in which the feelings of mankind are called sorth to decide A poor distressed widow with two infantbabes crying for food and none to give them and pressed also with hunger herself without a penny to purchase bread is led to purloin a loaf from a baker's shop Instead of commiserating her unhappy situation the heardhearted monster seizes her for the theft and we see her here pleading a pardon on her  knees and urging her extreme poverty and hunger and the hunger of her children as dear to her as life in excuse for her crime For whatever allowances the feeling heart of men may make for such an offence it surely is an act of dishonesty No want no love for herself or for her offspring should have led her to such an act  Hunger  they say  will break through stonewalls  that is a man driven to excess of hunger will regard neither bards nor bolts  selfpreservation  being the first law of nature it is in vain to talk of reason or of law to a craving appetiteBut if  necessity has no law  how was this poor woman criminalBefore she was in this very forlorn state she should have applied for relief The same laws that punish such an act as this would have given bread both to her and to her children In this country no one is suffered to perish for hunger and had she applied to a magistrate he would have procured her provision Conscious of her guilt she sues to the baker for forgiveness and pleads her uncommon distress in excuse for what she did Humanity therefore takes up her cause and we see a beneficent person behind her going to pay for the loaf she took  Whatever were this woman's intentions however strongly nature might plead in behalf of her infant children she was without excuse  We are not to do evil that good may come  Certainly  of two evils  we are to  choose the least  but we are to avoid both if both can be avoided where this is not the case we shall stand excused for committing of one for  Necessity has no Law  Scald not your Lips in Another man's Pottage  ALL men have naturally too much trouble to wish for more and too many vexations attendant on their own affairs to enter into those of others If a man's humanity leads him to take part in the distresses of a fellowcreature there is an excuse for so doing and to such men this  Proverb by no means alludes but there are a number of persons so industriously officious as to interfere in the concerns of others without being requested and without doing any good or reaping any reward but trouble and vexation to themselves and it is to the folly of such persons this Proverb directly points  Such is the case before us A man and his wife had been quarrelling and their words had ended in blows Humanity will naturally stand forth in defence of the weaker sex where a woman seems to be oppressed but in disputes between man and wife it is dangerous meddling The law of this country have given a husband authority over his wife and though it is the duty of the latter to submit to the former in all things that are legal and honest yet we often find in the lower class of people such a spirit of opposition that when the ladies cannot support their arguments sufficiently by words that is scolding their husbands into a compliance they will boldly fight it out and endeavour to carry their point by their fistsAnd yet they love their husbands too and will at any time defend his cause tho' at the expence of their own Such was the situation of things when our painter took up his pencil  A goodnatured man passing by interfered in her behalf and whilst the man was beating his wife he beat the man to make him desist And what was the consequence The woman's resentment against her husband immediately dropped she took up the cudgels in his defence and flew at the stranger with a  Has not a man you rascal a liberty to beat his own wife if he pleases  And the only thanks he got was a broken head for his pains  It is the same in other cases as in this officious meddlers in affairs of others seldom if ever get the thanks of the person they thus labour to serve they frequently bring trouble on themselves by such interference and are always considered as impertinent Where a man sees mischief likely to ensue it is his duty to put a stop to it where he can but if the business in which he steps forth will not be attended with bad consequences either to himself or society it is good policy to pass it by  He that passeth by says Solomon and meddleth with that belonging not to him is like one that taketh a dog by the ears  He stands a chance of being bit So says another Proverb  He that prieth into every Cloud may be stricken with a thunderbolt  Besides such officious meddling  is not only bad policy but illmanners It is a mark of lowbreeding and if persisted in will be sure to give offence  Learn then from this Proverb never to inter fore in things that don't concern you give not your advice unasked and  scald not your lips in Another man's pottage  To Forget a Wrong is the best Revenge  AND why Because it heaps coals of fire on our enemy's head This is the worldly meaning of the Proverb the religious one I shall mention hereafter Revenge only irritates afresh but "a soft answer" says Solomon  turneth away wrath  it disarms the angry man and tickles him into temper It is according to the  vulgar adage cutting his throat with a feather and wounding him in a part where he is most susceptible I mean his mind To return  evil for evil and raising for raising  is only making the breach wider and stopping up every avenue to a reconciliation whereas to return  good for evil  is not only christianlike but reflects the javelin that was thrown at us and plunges it in the heart of him that threw it It fills him with shame to think his enemy should be so much his superior and in censuring his antagonist he condemns himself a wise man then will endeavour to forget a wrong justly concluding that  Goodnature and good sense should always join  To err is human to forgive divine  Convinced of the propriety of this doctrine the painter has represented an old warrior whose profession is hostile entering a citadel with a revengeful disposition preceded by a hissing snake the harbinger of venom his sword is in his hand and implacability in his countenance Whatever may have been the offence given he seems here determined to revenge it and perhaps fire and slaughter would be the result of such a rash determination  but meekeyed peace arrests him in his progress and with gentle accents sooths his rage A contest ensues between his anger and his pityHe grows warm at the offence but he makes allowance for the offenderrankles at the affront but pities the affronterresents the indignity but labours to stifle it and though meditating revenge he wishes to forgive it and Peace whispering in his ear  To forget a wrong is the best revenge  he concedes to the heavenly truth drops his enmity and seems truly great not only in his own eyes but in the eyes of the world The city that a moment before was threatened with destruction is now secure from hostilities A dove the emblem of peace and innocence is bearing an olivebranch and this man has the honour not only of rising superior to an enemy but of triumphing over himself  Indeed the revengeful mind is never at ease it is not only unhappy whilst premeditating injury to those who have wronged us but when we have completed our wishes and gratified our revenge it must embitter our life to reflect that an inhuman principle has so far led us astray as to destroy the happiness the enjoyments or perhaps the life of a fellowcreature In mercy therefore to ourselves  to Forget a wrong is the best revenge  It is far more so in a religious view "Vengeance is mine saith the Lord I will repay it" One of the seven supplications to Heaven in our daily prayer enforces the necessity of conforming to this admonition "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us" If the degree then of forgiveness extended to us be in proportion to that we extend to others desperate indeed must be the case of the malicious and revengeful man When this therefore is considered and more particularly that the Lord will avenge the cause of the righteous to forgive and  Forget a wrong  surely  must be the best revenge  Handsome is that Handsome does  IF  to Forget a wrong is the best revenge  as we have seen in the last Proverb good offices to an enemy must be a superior effect of humanity What think we then of the good Samaritan assisting the distressed Jew who in his journey from Jerusalem to Jericho had fallen among thieves who had stripped him robbed  him and cruelly treated him Observe here the priest and the Levite The former who had seen the deplorable object lie almost breathless weltering in his congealed blood to avoid even an enquiry passes by on the other side The Levite too an attendant also on the temple views this poor wretch and though every gash in his mangled flesh cried and pleaded for compassion this hardhearted monster spoke neither a word of comfort nor moved a hand to help he passes also on the other side but the good Samaritan when  he  beheld the Jew between whose sect and his own there was an implacable malignitywhen  he  beheld him he sprung instantly from his mule and administered every aid he could afford He dressed his wounds placed him on his own mule's back and walked beside him through summer's heat and sultry sands 'till he conducted him to a house where he ordered him to be taken care of thus sinking his enmity to an imbittered foe into compassion for a fellowcreature And in doing this he not only gratified his own pride by triumphing over his enemy but his own feelings in this act of humanity for let a man be in the greatest state of affluence in the highest of all worldly enjoyments nay let his utmost wish be  indulged and he will not have half that pleasure which arises from one good and virtuous action Let us make our conduct then the standard of our beautyLet Nature paint the check and Virtue paint the mind for  handsome is that Handsome does  It is the action and not the fortune or situation in life by which the sensible and discerning characterise mankind It is not the beautiful facethe graceful formthe lovely lookIt is not these that constitute beauty when the mind is deformed  Honor and Fame from no condition rise  Act well your part there all the honor lies  It is our conduct our actions in life that must give us claim to a good name  Praises on tombs are trifles vainly spent  A man's good name is his best monument  The garter'd knightthe titled peerthe laurelled chiefare distinctions their possessors no longer merit than as they preserve the cause that created them "A few fleeting years" and honouras Falstaff says pointing to the grave"lies there" In a word it is actions only that constitute nobility  The nobleman is he whose noble mind  Is filled with inborn worth unborrow'd from his kind  And I must observe that even in conferring kindness there is a handsome way of doing it One man shall shew a civility with more grace and in so doing shall confer a greater honour than another in performing an act of the highest humanity Manner is every thing and a liberal mind is visible in all it does Every man should study this art it is easy to be learnt and when acquired gives a man infinite credit in the world  Let us for a moment turn our thoughts towards the middling class of men and we shall find honour truth and gratitude even with a plain education sufficiently informed to reverence their God and do honour to human nature He that does as he would be done unto acts a good part to his fellow creatureis an ornament to his raceand a noble citizen of the world We should despise no man for his appearance for his condition in life nor think those only great and honest who boast of wealth and titles The external actions of a man are nothing weighed against his virtues It is no matter in the eyes of the sensible world whether he be ennobled if he acts nobly or whether he be handsome if he does handsomely for  handsome is that Handsome does  Out of the FryingPan into the Fire  FROM the desperate situation of a poor fish thrown alive into the water to be boiled and jumping in that water for life and its having no alternative in escaping but falling into the fire this Proverb would teach us not to give up one situation for another let the first be ever so disagreeable if the second be not a better We are too apt to think our own situation  of life worse than that of others and of course to be discontented and dissatisfied But this betrays ignorance and want of reasoning Be assured there is no state of life without its troubles and inconveniences and were we to change it for another that other would be not less burthensome though in a different respect From habit and custom we are better acquainted with and feel the troubles attendant on our situation more than others can do who are not so well acquainted with them and the same reasoning will tell us that the burdens and troubles which others feel we have no idea of of course a wish to change one state for another unless we are sure to profit by the change is only getting  out of the fryingpan into the fire  "Learn then" says St Paul  in whatsoever state you are therewith to be content  We are also taught here  of two evils to choose the least  to do all the good we can and to do as little wrong as possible No man is perfect we are as naturally prone to sin as the sparks fly upward but reason is given us to subdue these natural inclinations and curb the impetuosity of our tempers If we must commit a sin let it be as little as can be helped In a worldly sense by choosing the least of two evils is understood considering  well before we determine and of two situations in life to make choice of the better and of two evils venture on the least If one man is to put confidence in another it is better to confide in an honest man than a rogue and if a man is to cross a river it is safer to pass it on a bridge than in a boat But the fear of danger will naturally point out conduct in such kind of evils Man requires only caution in those that are more concealed and the best advice he can have is to act on all occasions with circumspection  Indeed there are situations in life where duty obliges a man to counteract his own inclinations cases wherein  necessity having no law  he is compelled to take measures which his heart disapproves Such is the situation of a parent who is frequently obliged to correct the object of his love and that of a magistrate who often for the good of the public is obliged to take away the life of a fellowcreature This indeed is the particular sense of the Proverb to which the painter alludes  Needs must when the devil drives  This Proverb will also bear another interpretation namely that our vicious inclinations when they get ahead are a kind of temptation that leads us into sin which requires more than common resolution to withstand and like the devil the parent  of vice goads us on to do that which our nature would otherwise recoil at But it is incumbent on christians to resist the devil and fly from him and pray to God for those spiritual aids that will enable us to oppose this tempter and set him at defiance it is what God expects of us and what as good men we are bound to do that in flying from one sin we should be careful not to plunge into another In shunning prodigality we should not become covetous and in avoiding covetousness we should beware of prodigality So again in striving to be humble we should not be mean and in studying to preserve a proper dignity we should not be proud For he who in avoiding one vice runs into the opposite does little else than jump  out of the Fryingpan into the Fire  See  Look before you Leap  Look before you Leap  THE object of this maxim is to teach circumspection and to  do nothing rashly  Indeed as few things when done can be undone it is necessary to consider well before we do them as afterwards it may be too late to remedy them This holds good in every step in life but the  painter has thought proper to point it out more particularly in that most important of all steps matrimony Without circumspection here the remainder of our lives must be embittered and we shall have reason to repent our rashness as long as we live  There are a number of requisites necessary to constitute the happiness of a married state and so much is it the interest of either man or woman to conceal from the objects of their choice their tempers and situation in life if they will not bear examination that it is wonderful there are not more unhappy marriages than there are It is truly a leap in the dark and a mere matter of chance whether they leap safely or not The passions of youth are too ungovernable to give way to enquiry and attachments once formed are often too strong to be broke through It would be wise therefore if young folks should their inclinations lead them to seek a partner for life would advise with their parents or nearest relations in a concern so essential to their happiness Love is an idle term it is merely the fever of the mind and if encouraged is apt to rage but if discouraged may be overcome distress will soon cool it for when  Poverty comes in at the door Love will fly  out at the window  In short as there can be no true happiness without a competence this is the first consideration and as an enquiry of this kind is generally beyond the reach of young minds who so proper to consult as our parents or best friends who can have no view in the advice they give but the welfare of those they advise Persons conversant in life and acquainted with the world are certainly best able to judge in matters of this kind and if we are wise we shall abide by their determinations If the character temper and situation of the object is found upon a strict enquiry to be such as to make an alliance with for life prudent pursue your inclination but if they turn out the reverse shun the connexion as you would a pestilence and not like a silly moth flutter round the flame of a candle till you burn your wings In short  Look before you Leap  for  snakes among sweet flowers do creep  Let us however not only be circumspect in this but in every undertaking in which we embark The man who thinks before he acts is most likely to act with discretion and have no future cause to repent of his conduct but he who acts blindly without any foresight will probably  suffer for his rashness If the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the ditch "Be watchful then and vigilant" walk with your eyes open and  Look before you Leap  See  Out of the Fryingpan into the Fire  An old Dog will learn no Tricks  FROM the natural sagacity of a dog who when young may be taught a number of entertaining tricks we here understand the usefulness of an early education Children are like blank paper we may write on them what we please and if we omit to give them that education that will render them serviceable to themselves and useful to society if we neglect to  train them up in the way wherein they should go  we shall not only entail their curses upon our heads but the censure of all who know us Parents who have at heart the happiness of their children will feel themselves interested in this matter If they wish to make them the comforts of their old age and render the latter part of their lives happy they will instruct them early in the principles of virtue and sow such seeds of good in their hearts as shall bring forth commendable fruits in their riper years Old age is intractable morose slow and forgetful The Greeks have a maxim  one may as well physic the dead as instruct old men  If young folks have been put in a wrong way at first there is little hopes of amending them when they grow rigid by years  The tricks a colt getteth at his first backing  Will whilst he continueth never be lacking  That is to say if a colt is badly broke in he will never be good for any thing  Young folks then should consider the necessity of their being taught before they are too old to learn  A tree is best to bend whilst a twig  and  Just as the twig is bent the tree's inclin'd  The mind of a young person is open to information the memory is then strong he has no prejudices to oppose and of course is well disposed to learn Parents and teachers sensible of this take great pains to instruct those they have the care of and if children knew their own interest instead of thinking such instruction a hardship or the correction that makes them tractable and governable a punishment they would kiss the rod that chastises them and bless the hand that scourges them "Spare the rod" says Solomon "and spoil the child"  The painter in the design before us has contrasted one of the deplorable consequences of the want of an early education with the advantages arising to those that have it  A poor old sailor who had lost his leg in the service of his country and of course unfit to follow his profession not being able to live on the scanty pittance allowed by government for the support of such unfortunate men is under the necessity of seeking for some employ Had he when young been taught to read and write he might have found a maintenance by his pen to which the loss of his leg would have been no interuption Wanting this early knowledge and being bred up to no kind of trade his only resource  is to turn porter and hobble from place to place with other people's loads Here also he is at a loss unable to read the directions he receives he is under the necessity of requesting the assistance of those he meets and we see here a schoolboy one who is blessed with that instruction which the old man has his whole lifetime lamented the want of reading the direction for him and pointing out the way he is to go  Happy is the lad so informed and thankful ought he to be to those persons who have taken care to instruct himLet him make the most of his time whilst young for his early days will soon pass away and when he becomes a man he will have other cares to take up his thoughts cares perhaps for a family and cares for his future happiness "Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth" so shall the mind and heart be welldisposed to perform those christian duties that will make a man serene in his dying hour and leave him no dread of a miserable futurity Youth is the only time to acquire good habits for  Old dogs will learn no tricks  Out of Debt out of Danger  WEALTH being the idol of a moneyloving people we are too apt to reverence the rich and worship the opulent of course riches give a man might and influence among his neighbours It is on this consideration that wealth makes a man respectable for without a competence  he cannot be independent and it is independence only that makes him great  The laws that guard the property of individuals have made imprisonment a punishment for debt If one man is indebted to another and owes him money it is in the power of the person he is indebted to to lock him up till he can pay him Hence the Proverb  Out of Debt out of Danger  of imprisonment The painter sensible of this has here given us a sketch of a countryman paying a debt to a lawyer and his officer of vengeance a bailiff in wait behind him Thus by paying what he owes he escapes the trap of the law  This should naturally teach our men of fashion not to live at the expensive rate they do but to  cut their coat according to their cloth  and bound their expences by their income He is not the richest man who has the greatest income but he who lives within that income If a man has five thousand pounds a year and spends six thousand he must be often in want of money whereas if he has but five hundred and lives upon four he has always something to spare Of course he that has fewest wants is the richest man  If gentlemen were to consider the ignominy of being at the mercy of a taylor or a shoemaker  as certainly they are when in their debt they would be more cautious how they purchased things upon credit Where can be their pride when they are liable to be dragged from their coach as in the next print by the hands of a bailiff and locked up in a jail And where can be their feeling when perhaps they owe their finery and their indulgences to the labour of those who are poorer than themselves when they are beholden to a taylor and a shoemaker for their dress and to the butcher and baker for their daily food Surely a man in such a situation has little to boast of much less to enable him to raise his head above those tradesmen who perhaps are abundantly richer than himself far more independent and of course more respectable characters  If a man would confine his wants and wishes to the bounds of his income and never think of purchasing a thing till he has the money to pay for it his money would go much farther and he might walk abroad and enjoy liberty without the fear of insult or the danger of being taken prisoner  I will further observe upon this subject that to the disgrace of the profession of the law there are a number of what are called pettyfogging attornies or unprincipled professors of it that when they  get a man into their clutches will never let him escape till they have fleeced him pretty handsomely These are men that like locusts fatten on the misfortunes of a country and live upon the miseries of others There is no being safe from the claws of these harpies but by paying regularly for what we buy and then being  out of Debt  we shall be  out of Danger  All is not Gold that Glitters  THE painter has continued on his last scene and given us a sketch of the consequences of being in debt Here now is your gentleman that man of rank and distinction who exalts himself above his fellowcitizens and because he can have a little more credit has more impudence holds his head up and looks down on the common  class of mankind with contempt He rides in his coach is dressed in velvet and considers himself as an ennobled being forgetting at the same time that he owes these appendages of his greatness perhaps to the goodnature and credulity of his coachmaker and his taylor  How are the mighty fallen  The time of payment comes round he has it not to pay the laws of his country are put in force against him a ruffian officer is employed to enforce these laws he is dragged by the collar from his coach to repent his indiscretion within the walls of a prison and iron bars and his poor coachman left to repent his master's misfortune the downfal of pride and the loss of his place  Let the dissipated man of fashion view this picture and say in what his fancied dignity consists If there is any human disgrace if there is any contemptible situation it is this and every man who will presume to run in debt and has not the money to pay that debt when called on is liable to this indignity his coachman is in a far happier situation and much more respectable in life being in no danger of such an insult  But this is only a sequel of the last Proverb  Out of Debt out of Danger  the proverbial expression before us  All is not Gold that Glitters  has a different  allusion and the painter is happy in describing both in the same scene Appearances are deceitful we cannot trust to them many an aching heart has been concealed under a laced garment and many a troubled mind has rolled in a gilded chariot Before we survey the situation of those apparently above us let us consider the appearance well and see whether there is any thing in it truly enviable I will take upon me to say that he who enjoys the necessaries of life with some few of its comforts in a state of independency is a far happier man than he who possesses every luxury at the expence of his peace of mind  When any man is discontented with his situation in life let him compare it with that of others let him consider whether those riches that rank and power which many enjoy do not carry more torments with them than real happiness and let us also look into the situation of those below us and see whether we are not in possession of many comforts which others want others perhaps who have had better expectations in life and are more deserving than ourselves This should surely prevent us from repining at our own misfortunes and make us thankful to Providence for the blessings he has been pleased to bestow upon us True happiness  is seated in the mind and within every one's reach If our fortune is not adequate to our wishes let us confine our wishes to our fortune Let us make the best of our situation and not lose the enjoyments of the present moment in looking forward to the future that future may never arrive and if it does it will bring with it an equal share of bitterness Let us learn then as St Paul teaches us  in whatever state we are therewith to be content  and let us remember that however enviable a more exalted state of life may appear there is no state but what has its attendant cases and that  All is not Gold that Glitters  See  Call me Cousin but Cozen me not  to which Proverb this also alludes  Empty Vessels make the Greatest Sound  "A  CLOSE mouth"  says Solomon  "makes a wise head"  and  a fool's bolt is soon shot"  implying that prating and tattling is the index of a weak mind A man whose tongue is ever running upon trifles and who is eternally babbling not only renders himself ridiculous to his acquaintance but lays himself open to the designing  world he is never safe There is a description of men ever upon the watch to take advantage of the weak and to betray a weakness upon all occasions is only setting such men to work Keep therefore your own counsel never let the world know what should be concealed in your own breast for if you communicate your ideas without reserve you will meet with those who will profit by those ideas and deprive you of the advantages you might reap from them yourself  Look abroad in life and you will observe a set of weak young men who are always talking of themselves and their own unimportant affairs There cannot be a greater rudeness to your company than troubling them at all times with your own concerns independant of impressing them with an opinion that you can keep nothing secret Be assured if you cannot keep your  own  secrets you will never be entrusted with those of  others  and a man had better withdraw himself from society than lose the confidence of his friends  But the chief end of this Proverb and which the painter particularly alludes to is vain boasting Under this interpretation of it we are taught not to make ourselves a laughingstock by boasting of virtues we never practise of courage we never  possess or of abilities we never shew  Brag  may be  a good dog but holdfast is a better  That is to say it is better to bite and not bark than bark and not bite If a man boasts of virtues believe him a rascal if he vaunts of abilities be assured he had none and if he brags of courage my life for it he is a coward See the vain boaster before us This Quixote has cloathed himself in armour in order to perform wonderful atchievements he blusters and makes a great noise and all to what purpose Merely to wage war with the pigs and who like him will squeak before they are hurt To shew us the natural disposition of this swaggerer the designer has introduced a drum the symbol of empty noise and has made Folly on a lamppost staying his uplifted sword with a pair of taylor's sheers  Taylors are ludicrously supposed to have less courage than other men not deservedly so but we apprehend from their feminine profession  Whatever our pretensions are if we are modest and silent on the matter we shall stand in more credit with our acquaintance The modest and diffident that is he who withdraws himself from public notice rises in esteem on the  assuming man as much as the meekeyed beauty does on the forward and painted flaunter the one is attractive whilst the other is disgusting  In a word if we wish to stand well with our friends to enjoy their confidence and merit their esteem we have only to shew our worth by our actions These will speak for themselves and are much better tests of innate superiority than the vain boast of empty words for as the substance is better than the shadow so full vessels are most sought after though  Empty Vessels make the greatest Sound  When the Child is Christened you may have Godfathers enough  THE moment a man is independant of the favours of the world that moment he will find it more ready to bestow them when we no longer need a friend we find enough ready to assist us these are however friends who flutter round us when in prosperity and bask in our sunshine but who desert us when overhung by the clouds of adversity  If we look abroad into life we shall soon learn that adversity is the touchstone of friendship and that the only time to know our friends is when we stand in need of their services In other situations what appears to us friendship is a mere delusion the absolute gratification of selfish views as all the proffered services of men end only in interested motives and sordid expectations offering us a small favour to receive a greater in its stead He only is the true friend who serves us on our own account and seeks no other reward than that conscientious and heartfelt satisfaction that results from the performance of humane and charitable acts And when this laudable inducement is his only spur base must be that wretch who trampling on all laws both human and divine returns evil for good by abusing the good offices of his benefactor and spurning in the brighter day of fortune the shelter he experienced in its storms But to the more immediate sense of the Proverb  Do we not in almost all the occurrences of life find that  when the Child is Christened we may have Godfathers enough  For when our necessities are relievedwhen we no longer require aidwe shall have many offers but if like Gay's Hare in the fable we apply to our acquaintance in the  our of need we shall find them like her many  friends full of excuses abandoning us to those calamities which a single exertion of theirs might have relieved us from They are sorry they have it not in their power or we might command themBut let us escape from the wrecklet the excess of complicated distress not carry us beyond the reach of fate by sending us on that journey  From whose bourne no traveller returns  In short let us surmount our misfortunes and we shall have assistance in plenty that is to say  when the Child is Christened we shall have Godfathers enough  Look on the scene before usSee the humble servility of the crouching sycophant tendering his services when they are no longer wanted A few days only before the solicitous parent anxious to bestow the first token of christianity on his darling infant asked his false friends to become its sponsors No like the persons in the parable invited to the feast they made various excuses but no sooner do they see the business done and their services not required than they come forth voluntarily and tender what they till then refused  There are other little emblems in this picture By the trees in full leaf adjoining the church the painter would tell us that the doctrines of religion are wide expanded to afford us shelter that much  depends upon ourselves and that if we cultivate our understandings and bring them to that full perfection the trees are arrived at we shall have a just sense of our moral and religious duties and they will bring forth that fruit that will secure not only our temporal but our eternal happiness The infant in the left arm of its mother and next the minister the delegate of Heaven emphatically speaks and says that our hearts should ever turn to God it tells us too that the child should never turn its face against its parent The honest contempt the father shews for offers unsolicited for services he does not need teaches us not to credit the sincerity of those who in the time of our prosperity shall tender kindnesses they at other times refuse or conceive every one to be our friend who speaks to us fairly or makes us promises Proffered service and at such a time declares its own selfish view that  money begets  friends and that  when the Child is Christened we may have Godfathers enough  Fair and Softly goes Far  THE design of this Proverb is to condemn every kind of hurry expedition is necessary upon all occasions for "delays are dangerous" but haste or hurry is not the way to be expeditious The painter in the design before us shews us evidently that he who goes softly goes sure and  also far but he that spurs on too fast at first setting out either falls by the way or tires before he comes to his journey's end The old man here trotting to market is most likely to reach it sooner than he who sets out on a gallop As the French say He who walks too hastily often stumbles in a plain way  Qui trop sehaste en cheminent en beau chemin se tour voye souvent  so he who rides as fast as his horse can go is more likely to fall than one who goes gently on for "a whet is no let" say the mowers in giving a fresh edge to their scythes  But this Proverb may be otherwise construed By the age of the horse and its rider it appears that they have jogged on together through life in an even gentle way and have of course been free from those accidents that attend the wild and impetuous Nothing should be done hastily says another Proverb but killing of fleas for if we make the least delay here they escape us  He who does things in a hurry never thinks and without thought it cannot be well done for according to the Italians Hastily and well never meet  Presto et bene non si conviene  A man of sense may be expeditious but is never in  a hurry convinced that hurry is the surest way to make him do what he undertakes ill he may do it wrong and have it to begin afresh which a little consideration might have prevented To be in a hurry is a proof that the business we embark in is too great for us of course it is the mark of little minds that are puzzled and perplexed when they should be slow and deliberate wishing to do every thing at once they are able to do nothing  Tarry a little that we may make an end the sooner  was a saying of Sir Amias Paulet and  Festina lente  or On slow is the motto of the Onslow arms  Let us be steady then in all things we undertake consider the business well before we begin and remember that we had better do half of them well and leave the rest undone than do the whole indifferently Though unnecessary delays may be dangerous it is universally allowed that in general  "the more haste the worst speed"  Besides as another Proverb says  Haste makes waste and waste makes want and want makes strife between the good man and his wife  What a a collection of evils then attend this one act of imprudence Waste Want and Strife Waste is the father of many evils Want is the mother of many more and Strife their offspring engenders  others From Waste springs hardheartedness thanklessness debauchery and distress from Want beggary rapine extortion and dishonesty and from Strife animosity anger quarrels and bloodshed these might be branched out into many others equally dreadful If then you would guard against the effect remove the cause Remember that great rivers proceed from small springs and great vices often originate in little errors Think before you act Do nothing without deliberation Walk gently and you will tread safely and in the long run you will get on for  Fair and Softly goes Far  Birds of a Feather Flock together  AS this is true among the feathered tribe so is it among mankind As we see wildgeese crows pidgeons plover and other tribes fly in flocks so do we observe in human life that men of a peculiar way of thinking generally associate with each other  Likeness is the mother of Love  Young men delight in the company of young old  men of old learned men of learned and even wicked men of wicked Thus the gambler associates with men of his own stamp and the drunkard is usually seen with those who are fond of strong liquors Hence arose the Proverb  "Tell me what company you keep and I will tell you who you are"  As men covet the esteem of each other it is incumbent on all to be careful not to give mankind a bad impression of us for a good character is sooner lost than gained The world is apt to judge of us from the company we keep if then we would be thought well off let us pick that company and never be seen to associate with those who are despised I have seen religious men so scrupulous in this point that they would not be seen even speaking to a wicked man lest it should be supposed they approved of his evil actions Indeed if men were nicer in this respect than they are it would go a great way towards reforming the world for if bad men were not admitted into the society of the virtuous it would be a greater punishment than any penalties enacted by law  The allusion of this Proverb might be carried still further as a man who is often seen in low company will find an access to better very difficult such as are ambitious of keeping good company should never mix with any below them  when I say  never  I do not ay on no occasion whatever this perhaps our connections in life may render almost impossible but I mean that to be well received in the best of company a man must not  associate  with the lower By low company I mean low in birth low in rank low in parts and low in manners that company who insignificant and contemptible in themselves are proud of being seen with  you  and who will flatter your very vices in order to keep in with you  The vanity of being reckoned the first person in company has led many a young gentleman to associate with those persons who have degraded him and even prevented his being received into better assemblies Every one should be ambitious of improving his mind and getting forward in life and this is not to be done by mixing with people below ourselves Depend upon it a man sinks or rises according to the level of the company he keeps  What is the scene before us but riot revelry and drunkenness Such persons whose minds are illdisposed to thought and business seek relief from themselves in music cards and riot and whilst they thus think to spend their idle hours agreeably they involve themselves in penury and wretchedness and bring on sickness and ill health and once inured to  this way of life they enjoy no other but return like a dog to his vomit The painter has given us to understand that such a life is a departure from virtue and brought about by the Enemy of mankind by shewing us that though these men have sat up late burnt out their light and drank more than they can contain he is spurring them on to a farther excess of beastliness and putting the bell into the hand of the drunkard to ring for more liquor thus filling up the measure of their iniquity  Beware then of bad company shun them as you would a pestilence and remember that if you would avoid evil associate not with evil doers A good character is sooner lost than gained Be your principles what they will they are liable to be infected and if you would not be thought vicious keep no vicious company for the censure of the world will be sure to fall on you if you do from an opinion that you must be of the same stamp with the company you keep as  Birds of a Feather Flock together  Make Hay whilst the Sun shines  WE are here admonished to avail ourselves of every opportunity of forwarding our designs for  delays are dangerous  and  opportunity neglected brings repentance  Hay can only be made whilst the sun shines to dry it and as its continuance is very uncertain if wet should come our harvest  will be spoiled We should not then waste our lives in dull supineness like Shakespear's Smith swallowing a Taylor's news whilst our work cools upon the anvil  but strike the iron whilst 'tis hot  for when cold it will not yield to the hammer  Let us not then defer that till tomorrow which can be done to day  for something on the morrow may happen to prevent us we should recollect that the present moment is but ours for the instant and that very chance it produces for our benefit if not then embraced will be irrecoverably lost  The painter has illustrated this Proverb by a prisonscene putting the admonition here given into the mouth of the man without the gate calling to his comrades within and telling them Now's the time to escape their centinel being off his guard These are supposed to be seamen taken in war and imprisoned By his representing the centinel asleep he would teach us the consequence likely to result from his drowsinesswhat ills may arise from inattention to those duties with which we are entrusted By his negligence the means given to discharge his office are rendered useless The key which secured the prisoners is wrested from him and lies at his feet and he sleeps upon the loaded musquet and fixed bayonet  weapons put into his hands to guard against those very steps his carelessness has suffered to be committed  The illjudged doubts which the inattentive have of this Proverb is represented in the countenance of the prisoners who seem to hesitate whether they shall make hay although the sun shines or escape though the centinel sleeps though the birds on flight direct their way and contrast the blessings of liberty and free air with  durance vile and sad contagion  and though if they avail not themselves of the present opportunity another may never offer and they may repent they missed it  We learn from this Proverb also a piece of worldly policy to find out the moments of insinuation the  mollia t  mp  ra fandi  the soft hours of perswasion when we are best likely to succeed with those to whom we apply If we wish to speak with efficacy and make an impression on those we speak to we should select those moments when they are best disposed to listen to us and when what we say is most likely to be attended to Our application then will probably not be fruitless and we shall profit by the wisdom Upon this principle we should not talk of patience to enraged men or religion to a drunken man but wait till  favourable opportunities offer and embrace those opportunities when they do  In a religious sense this Proverb teaches not to defer our repentance Man is naturally a sinner prone to sin as the sparks fly upwards and as sinners cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven without repentance repentance is necessary to our future happiness Young persons unwilling to mortify themselves and break off from habits they find a pleasure in postpone their repentance to a future day and idly think it will be time enough to reform when they grow old in life This perhaps might do if they were certain of living to be old But what if they are cut off the next year the next month or the next dayWhat becomes of their repentance thenThey die with all their sins upon their heads and rush into futurity to meet the vengeance of an angry GodHow unwise thisRepent then in time Attend to the voice of Heaven  To  day  if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts  A good life is equally pleasant as a bad one and is the best of comforts when we come to die Lose not then the present opportunity avail yourself of the hours now in your possession Catch the moments as they fly Be not regardless of the indulgence of Providence and  Make Hay whilst the Sun shines  Time and Tide will wait for No one  THIS Proverb is a sequel of the foregoing  Make Hay whilst the Sun shines  Embrace the first opportunity that offers to do what is to be done for  Time and Tide will wait for no one  They continue their progressive route regardless of consequence and it is as much out of our  to stay the one as the other Although Xerxes whipped the seas for disobeying his injunction he found the vanity of his conduct and felt the force of the Proverb for he  Surveyed his numerous host with tears  To think they'd die within a hundred years  And although Canute lashed the waves for wetting his feet not all their power could reverse the course of nature These mighty kings are now crumbled with the dust Time still rolls on and the waters have still their tides Happy are they who improve the present moments and are prepared for the awful summons when Death shall call  "Go about your business" is inscribed on the Temple Dial laconically telling us that the moment we are idly gazing on it might be better employed The ruined monastery in the scene here painted pictures to us the evil ravages of Time The setting sun denotes that though it has shone in its meridian lustre it is now sinking into darkness Not a single leaf blooms here its verdure and the sacred Cross at whose foot the holy Frier once bent the knee of adoration is tumbling under the hand of Time and mouldering with the dust of those sacred relicks which decorated  once the choir The glass is run Time has stretched his arm to cut away the sad remains and will at length  like the baseless fabrick of a vision  Leave not a wreck behind  He is drawn flying to denote that Time is ever on on the wing is bald behind silently implying that we cannot pull him back and with a single tuft before saying we may  catch him by the forelock  and lay hold of the first moments that occur not deferring our concerns till a future day but embracing the present hours whilst in our possession So the impetuous tide rolls heedlessly along regardless of what happens and carries all before it for  Time and Tide will wait for no one  The one mows down and the other sweeps all before it leaving scarce the remembrance of what is past  Know then that each revolving sun brings us hearer to our end and as on the bed of sickness and in the last extremity of expiring nature we cannot stay the hand of Death or prolong the time of our existence and as the hours we lose are past recall how much does it behove us e'er our glass is run to employ our hours well that when Time shall cut us down and the tide roll its waters over  us we may have finished the work of our salvation and have nothing to do but receive a joyous welcome in the regions of eternal bliss  Eager to mend and brookless of delay  Sincere  repentance waits no future day  Upon the whole whether in a civil or religious sense you determine upon a thing if you can do it instantly do it without delay  no time like the present  a thousand unforeseen circumstances may interrupt you at a future time If the favouaable hour is past 'tis not to be recalled Do then what you have to do whilst you find yourself disposed Never reject a present happiness in prospect of a future one but enjoy your life whist you may for  a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush  and  Time and Tide will wait for No one  Children and Fools have Merry lives  CHILDREN because from their tender age they study nothing but to promote their little pleasures and fools because their ignorance puts them beyond the reach of rational enjoyments are merry at trifles and strangers to reflection  The Proverb means to say that fools though of full age are little wiser than children who for want  of thought and reason never look forward but enjoy the present moment labouring to banish reflection by low mirth and excite laughter from those as ignorant as themselves Children then thus compared to fools must see the folly of their conduct Though they may burst into roars of laughter at ten or twelve years of age at the low buffooneries of a drollthough they may lead very merry lives before the sense of care breaks in upon them yet when they come to years of discretion and see things in a different light they should act quite otherwise St Paul says  When I was a child I thought as a child I spake as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things  The concerns and anxieties of life will naturally intrude upon our pleasures and checquer our happiness with a degree of pain And it is wise and allowable to enjoy the moments as they pass and not suffer the prospect of a  future  pleasure to rob us of the  present  for that future prospect may never be realized  The thing that hath  been  it is that which shall  be  and that which  is  done is that which  shall  be done for there is nothing  new  under the sun  None but fools then will miss the enjoyment in their  power under an idea of waiting for that which may never come As real and substantial happiness depends upon peace of mind and as there can be no such peace where there is no pleasing reflection children as their reason opens and as reflection offers itself should lay that foundation of future happiness in their own breasts as will secure them comfort and a tranquil old age that is they should attend to the instructions they receive from their parents and teachers persons who know better than themselves and not by a foolish indifference to every thing serious and an idle attachment to folly and mirth create temporary joy at the expence of lasting comfort and all that is praiseworthy We should consider that our days roll on that every additional year brings with it its cares that we may be thrown on a bed of sickness even in early life that our spirits will flag at repetitions of inconsiderate and immoderate pleasures and of course that we should conduct ourselves so whilst we have the power of doing it that reflection may not wound us when that power is no more The grasshopper in the fable on the approach of winter begged the Ant to lend her a few grains of corn "What" asked the provident ant  did you do all the summer that you are without food now  "Sung" replied the grasshopper  well  then  retorts the ant  as you  sung  in the summer you may  dance  in the winter  The ant had no mercy for the thoughtless mendicant  The bagpiper before us is one of those inconsiderate fools who live a merry life because it suits their idle dispositiona man who from his strength and make might have followed the plough wielded the sword or levelled the musket and thus have rendered himself of use in societyNo he meanly condescends to drone away his life as vacant in thought as the yelping animal before him or the children that are dancing round him The simple grinthe low grimacethe grating discord and the enjoyment he derives from this assemblage of unmanliness constitute in his mind a merry lifebuthe is a  fool  he thinks but as the children he is playing to They indeed have merry lives and their age is an excuse for their want of thought  With respect to ourselves let us abandon those foolish propensities to which the unthinking are addictedlet us not expect every thing calm and unruffled in the ocean of lifeStorms will naturally arise but let us meet them with resignation and fortitude and be prepared to oppose them for all men have their share of trouble and every one must bear his own burden it being  Children  only  and Fools  that  have merry Lives  Much Meat much Maladies  IT is the disgrace of the inhabitants of this country that of all others they are most addicted to intemperance I mean not excess in drinking but excess in eating so that it is almost grown into a Proverb that Englishmen dig their graves with their teeth I have had occasion to  shew the folly and wickedness of drunkenness which is intemperance in drinking and to say something of gluttony which is excess in eating but this Proverb bears another complexion and points out to us that gluttony not only brings on disease but that he who studies his palate shortens his days Nature is soon satisfied and we see in rustic life that where men feed upon homely food and are obliged from their poverty to put up with scanty fare they are generally in better health and spirits and in reality more happy than those whose wealth enables them to indulge their appetites at the expence of their constitution for surfeiting and diseases often attend full tables  The painter sensible of this has given us a view of the consequence of intemperance A wealthy citizen blown up with corpulency choaked for want of breath and racked with the excruciating pains of the gout not only in his feet but in his stomach The agony he feels is painted in his countenance he is become unweildy through want of exercise and to gratify a greedy appetite has lost the use of his limbs of course confined to the melancholy reflection of having been his own tormentor We are taught by the picture above representing a man eager in weighing his  money that he has been anxious in the accumulation of that which he has converted to very bad purposes  I am convinced that excess in eating has done as much harm if not more in society than excess in drinking A cheerful glass of wine if not taken to intoxication that is if it does not make a man drunk and deprive him of the command of his reason often exhilerates the spirits and comforts the constitution and under this conception physicians have frequently prescribed the cheerful use of wine or to drink occasionally a little more than we have been used to but they never thought of advising a sick man to overeat himself  If loading the appetite dulls the understanding makes a man heavy sleepy and inactive and unfits him for the purposes of society it incapacitates him for business and indisposes him for exercise Want of exercise brings on corpulency with all the inconveniences of repletion and foulness and the consequence is a complication of diseases torture of body and an untimely death Be assured if a man finds himself unwell that temperance is his best physician and exercise his best nurse Let him keep regular hours never feed but when he is hungry eat sparingly drink moderately and use  proper exercise and he may throw physic to the dogs But if he makes use of his money to pamper his appetite he not only punishes himself in this world but runs the risk of being punished in the next for gluttons and drunkards are included in that list of sinners who without repentance will be shut out from Heaven  Disorders brought on by ourselves are unpitied a great eater is considered as little better than a monster and he who ransacks the creation to gratify his palate is not only the derision of all who know him but becomes his own executioner is a selfmurderer in the eye of Heaven and falls unpitied and unlamented In a word if a man unwell must consult physicians I beg leave to recommend Dr Diet Dr Quiet and Dr Merryman  Haec tria mens laeta requies moderata diaeta  These three a happy mind quiet and moderate diet    These are the three best physicians in the world for intemperance only brings on discase and  much Meat much Maladies  Opportunity makes the Thief  THIS is one of those Proverbs which they who make allowances and undertake to account for the depravity of mankind use in their behalf attributing the dishonesty of men to the truly honest man will avail himself of no opportunity  to do an improper act Convinced he is under the eye of Heaven he will act as if the eyes of Mankind were upon him and be afraid to commit himself or do by another what he would be unwilling any one should do by him  The painter however has fallen in with the humour of the world and has shewn us that opportunity here has made a thief for whilst a gentleman is sleeping in his garden a rascal has turned his pockets inside out robbed him of his money and is carrying off his hat and wig his sword and his cane  If the dishonesty of men can ever be attributed to opportunity it must be opportunity accompanied with necessity We can easily make allowances for the frailty of human nature when necessity pushes hard and if a poor famished wretch pressed with hunger should see a piece of bread lie in his way and an opportunity offer to take it unobserved where he knew it would not be given him on asking for it I say it would require in such a case more than human exertion to withstand the temptation and a feeling man would pardon the infirmity but it does not follow that such an act is justifiable The laws of this country have pointed out where such a man may seek relief  and of course will always punish the transgressor  A prudent man however will be careful not to lay temptation in the way of those whose situations in life might urge them to fall in with them that is to say masters superiors and housekeepers should secure their money and moveable goods under lock and key that their servants may have no temptation to steal  Safe Bind safe Find  He who secures his property is in little danger of losing it but he who leaves it at the mercy of others must not always expect to find it undiminished  But this Proverb may in its allusions be carried further we may from hence learn the dangers of opportunity in other cases than that of theft Wherever opportunities hold forth temptation we should always avoid them we should shun the company of bad men and bad women lest the opportunities this may afford should induce us to follow their example Opportunities of drinking and revelling may make a drunkard of a sober man and opportunities of debauchery may make a libertine of a modest oneOur passions naturally incline us to evil and as few men can thoroughly  subdue their passion and inclinations it is adviseable to avoid the temptation  On this consideration it is incumbent on all who have the care of youth never to slip an opportunity to amend their morals they should never give them an opportunity to corrupt them but keep them out of harm's way and young folks should reflect that when parents and guardians abridge them of what they call pleasures it is done with a view to their welfare which their infantunderstandings will not enable them to see into For occasions of temptation tend as much to corrupt the morals as  Opportunity  does to  make the Thief  {inverted ⁂} See  Necessity has no Law  Wherever a man Dwells he shall be sure to have a Thornbush near his Door  The miseries of men are half unknown  Fools idly think no sorrows like their own  Such is the fact that all men have their share  Let each then well his own misfortunes bear  NO place no condition is exempt from trouble it is the common lot of humanity and that which in reality constitutes our happiness  For were we to experience no wretchedness we should not be sensible of a freedom from it Relief from racking pain is almost an atonement for the sufferings we underwent Man is a discontented being panting for a certain  something  he knows not what always coveting the seeming happiness of others and missing the enenjoyments within his own reach  That cruel something unpossess'd  Corrodes and leavens all the rest  Let him however obtain his utmost wish let him be in the height of his fancied bliss some accident will intervene at times to sour his joy and chequer his happy moments  Who breathes must suffer and who thinks must mourn  And he alone is bless'd who ne'er was born  Without this thorn in the flesh as St Paul calls it without this mixture of evil with our good we should never reflect on our situation here nor cast a thought upon the world to come Crosses then and troubles are afflictions sent from Heaven to  bring us to reflection and should be considered as tending to our good  The painter has here represented a merchant sitting on his quay surrounded with all the treasures a world can afford the merchandize of the Indies that acquisition that wealth only can command enjoying in a fair day the arrival of one ship and the delightful prospect of another coming into port These are says he the consequences of industry and the blessings of a concurring Providence But in the midst of this boasted happiness and old servant brings him a letter announcing the failure of his correspondent abroad by which he suffers in his fortune A gloom immediately overspreads his countenance and all his prospects are clouded From the happiest of men he thinks himself the most wretched arraigns the conduct of Heaven and "charges his God foolishly" with that which is merely the accident of thingsWhy despairWhy dissatisfiedShould such a fatality happen as is common to all should our fortune suffer shipwreck it is much wiser to summon our resolution bear up against the stroke set our wreck again to work and labour to rise victorious from its ruins  Never let us suppose that  our  misfortunes are more than those of others no man is without his troubles and could we see into the heart of him whom we observe rolling in the midst of pleasures we might possibly see a heart torn with disappointment and racked with vexation If we have more misfortunes than the rest of our acquaintance let us pride ourselves in overcoming them Instead of despairing and viewing our troubles in a hopeless light it is a duty we owe not only to ourselves but to our friends and relations to exert ourselves upon the occasion and use every honest endeavour to extricate ourselves from the difficulty for there never yet was a way  in  but there was a way  out  And I believe no industrious man can upon reflection say that he was ever so much embarrassed or ever so unfortunately situated but Providence pointed out a way to escape so that let his situation be what it may he may console himself that he is not the only one that suffers for  Wherever a man Dwells he will be sure to have a Thernbush near his Door  Enough is as good as a Feast  THE design of this Proverb is to teach men moderation and shew the absurdity of coveting more than they want When hunger is satisfied even the sight of meat is disgusting  Little difference between a Feast and a Bellyfull  and when our inclinations are gratified what more can we need "Take no thought" says our Saviour  "for tomorrow what you shall eat or what you shall drink or wherewithal you shall be cloathed for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself" This advice of our Lord seems at first sight with the Proverb to contradict that carefull provision which every prudent man should make for himself and his family in laying by something against an evil day so as to protect him and his from future want but his meaning is merely to condemn that carking care which some fearful men are continually troubled with and which prevents their present enjoyments By the  enough  of the worldly man is understood a little more than he has but the  enough  here alluded to implies that provision sufficient with honest industry to enable a man to support himself and his family not  at avaritious scraping together that knows no bounds and that renders us churlish and unfeeling to the wants of others Ambition is like a ladder where a man having got upon one round is discontented till he reaches the top and is then unhappy that he can go no higher  The painter has here given us a picture of a shepherd family who having satisfied their own hunger are giving the remainder to a pauper at their door convinced that what they have to dispose  of is lent to the Lord and will be returned them in time of need  Could the unfeeling wretch who withholds a good office from a distressed object when he has it in his power to perform one I say could he but be sensible of the heartfelt pleasure the beneficent man enjoys within himself at having fed the hungry cloathed the naked and made the widow's heart to sing for joy he would wonder at his want of nature repine at his inhumanity and would truly abhor himself There is certainly a greater pleasure in giving than receiving but independant of this pleasure it is the duty of all men to do good where they can and bestow a part of their income in charitable acts Let no one suppose that what he gives to the poor is thrown away for God will bless his acts of beneficence and for every guinea he thus bestows will give him two in return It is to the blessing of Providence that we owe what we have and he who gave us that can give us more that is to say he will prosper our labours dispose the minds of men in our favour and put us in a situation to improve our fortune  But the great doctrine of the Proverb is to teach us with St Paul "to be contented in that state  in which Providence has placed us" to enjoy those blessings God has been pleased to bestow on us and not covet those out of our reach and like the dog and the shadow lose a present comfort in searching for a future one How apt are young folks to promise themselves greater happiness at a distant period The boy pleases himself with thinking that when he becomes a man he shall be at the summit of his wishes but when that period arrives he looks forward to something more distant It is idle and boyish our life is very short and passes away very imperceptibly and the only true happiness is a quiet mind and the peaceable enjoyment of the present moment Riches bring with them trouble and care and in coveting more than we want we wish for anxieties that would load and oppress us The chief of our wants are of our own creatingNature is satisfied with a very little and  Enough is as good as good as a Feast  ☞ See  Grasp all Lose all  A Faint heart never Won fair Lady  THIS Proverb figuratively implies that courage and perseverance are absolutely necessary to effect any end we may have in view and is by no means confined to the literal sense for as  a faint heart never won fair lady  so cowardice and supineness will infallibly produce a failure in the accomplishment of any other purpose we may aim  at Before however we determine to persevere we should maturely consider the object of our attention and how far it may tend if successful to our honour our interest or our happiness If it is not likely to produce this good effect we should give up the attempt but if on the contrary we find it may prove instrumental to either of them let us push forward with an honest zeal with a spirited resolution remembering that  nothing Venture nothing Have  The proverb teaches us also never to despair never to relax in our endeavours to perform a good actionnever to have a faint heart in laudable pursuitsfor though perseverance even in a good cause is not always victoriousthough we cannot  command  success we may do morewe may study to  deserve  it Virtue has a sure reward though it may be a late one The practice of virtue will ever afford a serene prospect a lasting happiness far beyond the glittering perspectives the momentary transports of delusive vice It is surely natural for an honest man to pursue with an anxious alacrity those purposes that are worthy of him to preserve throughout a consistent perseverence not to be frightened by ideal obstacles or "make mountains of molehills"  But to apply the ProverbPerhaps it will be difficult to find a more significant allusion than the one here adopted To possess the real object of our affections is one of the most solicitous pursuits of mankind Most other desires have their rise from the prejudice of education but this derives its birth from nature Though the ruling passion of mankind is a thirst for gain yet this often leads to the perversion of honour virtue and goodness whereas the one we are speaking of confirms them all  Let us understand then that the perseverance recommended is only in those pursuits which when overtaken will repay our labour with placid satisfaction and will afford us pleasure on contemplation A heedless insolicitude betrays an indifference for the object we aim at whilst an assiduous and important care shews the value of those sources from whence they spring  The Tar in our print like the element on which he gains his livelihood has his calm and boisterous moments but in the most violent of the latter he acts with prudence and in the smoothest even of the former carefully avoids every thing that is indiscreet A wife is the object of his wishesHe meets with a woman whom he fancies he should  like attacks her with boldness accosts her under the consciousness of acting honourably and declares his passion for her with his natural bluntness and honesty She listens to his proposals and crowns his wishes by accepting his offers Modesty on her part compels a faint resistance but his perseverance conquers all She is sorry at having given him a moment's pain and wonders why she did so  Thus the rough seas which when the winds have laid  Look calm and wonder at the wreck they've made  The church is now before him here he takes her for his wife makes her his own blesses himself for his bold enterprise convinced that if we mean to take our game we should if possible never lose sight of the chace and happy in the reflection that he has profited by the Proverb  A Faint heart never Won fair Lady  Murder will Out  SO horrid a crime is murder in the eye of Heaven that the wretch who can be guilty of such an act has as little chance of escaping the punishment of the law as the punishment of God The eye of Providence is ever abroad and watchful over all its works and will never suffer one who robs a fellowcreature of his life to escape  with impunity We have a signal instance of this in the story to which our print alludes  A traveller who strolled into a churchyard to pass the time whilst his dinner was preparing at the inn took notice of a human skull which a gravedigger had thrown out with the earth in digging a grave Whilst his eye was upon it it moved a toad having crawled under it This circumstance called his attention farther and he perceived the remains of a rusty nail sticking fast in one of the temples He took up the skull examined it and was then led to conceive that this nail had occasioned the death of the man to whom it once belonged He asked the gravedigger who had long been employed in that office and grown old in his profession whether he knew whose skull that was or who had been buried in that grave The old man whose knowledge of the parish reached but to all its inhabitants and who could tell from father to son where this man lay and that man was buried informed the traveller that he had not opened this grave for many years and that he believed the skull he had now thrown out belonged to a man who on a journey about twenty years ago died at the adjoining Inn He died suddenly continued the old man  and from a variety of circumstances before and after the illnatured world charged the landlord with murdering him Some enquiry was made but it ended in nothing God forbid any thing I may say should hurt his characterThe man may be innocentThe suspicion is blown over and he is now respected  This story dwelt with our traveller He was now more convinced than before that the nail in the skull occasioned the man's death and that he could be no other than murdered He flew to the Inn closetted the landlord told him what he had seen and heard and charged him with the fact The man whose conscience became instantly his upbraider and "whose crime" like Cain's "was more than he was able to bear" with trembling and with faultering tongue confessed the fact became his own accuser and thus suffered for the murder he had committed twenty years before This innkeeper having found his guest possessed of great property not only robbed him of that property but also his life by driving a slender nail into his skull within the hair whilst he was asleep hoping by this that he never should be discovered but sooner or later  Murder will Out  In a less criminal sense this Proverb teaches us not to do wrong through the hopes of its never being discovered Many a man betrays himself in an unguarded moment and many more are betrayed by means they little expect Let a man do nothing which he is ashamed of nothing which his own mind condemns and he will have no cause to fear a discovery  Honesty is the Best policy  If to hide his guilt he tells a lie he will be obliged to tell twenty more to conceal that lie and the pains he takes and the anxiety he is under to preserve his character is a greater punishment than he knows how to bear He bears it however for a while and a while onlySome unforeseen accident brings the hidden mystery to light and this accumulation of guilt not only encreases his disgrace but adds to his punishment His conscience becomes his tormentor and his friends triumph in his calamity for let a man carry on his intrigues as secret as he will he is never secure from detection for vice will in the end betray itself and knavery come to light as  Murder will Out  Little strokes fell Great oaks  WE are here taught not to be discouraged at the greatness of any enterprise for  Faint Heart never won fair Lady Time and Patience overcometh all things  and wonderful things have been effected by perseverance A man with a journey of a hundred miles before him thinks he  never get through itMost assuredly he will not if he never sets outbut let him make the attempt and every step he advances he will find himself nearer to his journey's end So is it in all we undertakeEvery thing is not to be done at once but by degrees we shall obtain our object It is not in the power of any man to cut down a large tree at one stroke of an axe but let him repeat those strokes and he will accomplish his purpose So with the stonecutters before us  What more hard than stone and what less easy to be cut Stone can be sawn through by degrees and chizelled into any form we please Bridges have been built by laying stone upon stone and the most stupendous piles have been raised and have given way to the arm of man Flints have been worn by the feet of pismires and the paths of ants are easily discovered The greatest number is made up of units and the waters of the sea are made up with drops The hardest stone has been hollowed out by drops of water continually falling on it  Plutarch tells a story of Sertorius to this purpose To persuade his soldiers that understanding was more available than strength he caused two horses with long tails to be brought out the one  poor and lean the other lusty and strong To the weak horse he sets a stout strong young man and to the strong horse a little weak fellow each was to pull off his horse's tail The young man catching all the tail at once in his hands began to tug with all his strength labouring and sweating to little purpose till at last being tired he gave it up whereas the weak man with more understanding pulled his horse's tail hair by hair and thus by perseverance in a little time got off the whole tail without much labour for according to the Italian proverb  Feather by Feather the Goose is plucked  In short the meaning of the Proverb is that assiduity overcomes all difficulty  In another sense it teaches us that  Light Gains make a Heavy Purse  that is those who sell for small profit vend more commodities and make quicker returns of their money than those who are covetous of gain and sell their goods at a dearer rate Indeed those who sell dear are likely to be losers in another way their goods remain long on hand and frequently spoil and grow out of fashion  Under this sense of the Proverb we are taught likewise to save our money for as  Little and osten fills the Purse  he who begins to save will  soon find himself rich As  Rome was not built in a Day  so a great estate is not acquired in a few hours but  Every Little makes a Mickle  and great things rise from small beginnings  In a religious sense we learn from the scene before us that perseverance in welldoing is the way to be saved No man can lay siege to Heaven and take it by violence but if he pursues the path that leads to it and holds out to the end he will then be within reach and may lay hold of the crown of life  In a word whatever object we may have in view let us keep our eyes fixed upon it make use of the means that are in our power to obtain it persevere in those means never be discouraged or give the point up and we shall gradually accomplish our aimFew difficulties are so great as not to be overcome for  Little strokes fell Great oaks  Better Late than Never  IT is certainly wiser both in the religious and civil sense of this Proverb to begin a thing early than late but if we miss an early application it is better to take up useful matter late than not to take it up at all for as in a civil light to leave a thing undone which we had in our power to do is unwise so in a religious one to  "leave undone those things which we ought to have done" is criminal for the sin of  omission  is equal to that of  commission  that is to say he who omits to perform a duty enjoined by religion is equally culpable with him who commits a sin which religion forbids of course if we have neglected to perform any positive duty let us set about it be it ever so late for  better Late than Never  Our designer in the scene before us has represented the refuse or lower class of people attending at last to the voice of religion He has supposed them a long time abandoned to vice and deaf to the whispers of conscience He has humourously pictured without a wretch riding post to the devil and one of his imps behind him flogging on the poor jade of a horse to increase the haste of this man's overthrow who mad as he seems in his career has nothing in prospect but a gibbet in this life and eternal punishment in the next yet such is the infatuation of men that they will pursue their inclinations though they tend immediately to their destruction  Happy is it for such men that there is a God above who often takes compassion on their weakness and exerts himself to bring them back from the error of their ways He awakens them from  their deadly lethargy by the calls of Conscience that secret monitor that always tells a man when he does right or wrong and leads him to his temple there to hear the truths of religion from the mouth of his priests Impressed with these divine truths they become convinced of their errors are ashamed of having lived so long in sin and wickedness acknowledge that  it never is too Late to Repent  and become intirely new creatures  A regular attendance at divine worship is a duty we owe not only to God but to ourselves The mind is there disposed to hear religious truths and when uttered with solemnity becoming their Author and the sacredness of the place they make such an impression on the mind as is likely to continue with us We owe every thing to God we must be unnatural and ungrateful not to return him thanks for it and as we can command nothing of ourselves to whom should we apply in all our wants but to him "Ask" says he "and you shall have" Let us then pray to him with sincerity of heart and there is little fear of our obtaining what we want or that which is much better for He is certainly the best judge whether what we ask will be beneficial for us or not  Never despair then or be discouraged at having offended your Maker he is always ready to receive a penitent supplicant to forgive us our sins and take that man to his favour who returns to him with a contrite heart The sooner a man leaves off and forsakes his evil ways the sooner is his pardon sealed but if he has continued in sin ever so long  it is never too late to repent  and  Better Late than Never  Grasp all Lose all  THE known fable of the Dog and the Shadow is a true emblem of covetousness With a piece of meat in his mouth he forded a river and seeing his own shadow in the water took it for another dog with a piece of meat and endeavouring to catch at this other let that fall which he had hold of and thus for the shadow  lost the reality "Covetousness brings nothing home" for in aiming at what is out of our reach we too often lose what we have in possession  A contented mind is a continual feast  And if we have enough why should we wish for moreHe who husbands a little well will make it go farther than he who has a great deal and takes no care of it Besides covetousness is so contrary to the principles of a liberal and humane man that it is sure to meet with enemies Every man sets his face against it and all that part of the world that are not nicely honest which is by far the greater part of mankind will take a pleasure in overreaching one who is covetous and many a man with a competent fortune has risked it in hopes of adding to his wealth and lost the whole  But take this Proverb in another sense and it is equally true he who is discontented with his present situation and looks forwards for a happier some time to come loses the enjoyment he might receive at present in the prospect of what may never come to pass for was a man to live years he would find no alteration in the disposition of mankind What has been will be again "The thing that  hath been  " says Solomon "it is that  which shall  be  and that which  is  done is that which  shall  be done for there is nothing  new  under the sun"Learn then in whatsoever state you are therewith to be content Enjoy with prudence the comforts and pleasures which your situation affords and lose not sight of present happiness in hunting after that which is to come  True happiness is within every one's reach it does not consist in wealth and honours but in a contented mind If a man has but a competency he has no reason to be dissatisfied for there are thousands in the world who are not so blessed and yet may boast of equal merit A great fortune falls not to every man's lot and yet almost every man may be rich for he who has fewest wants is richest And man who has a hundred pounds ayear and spends but ninety has ten pounds to spare and of course is a rich man whereas he who has five thousand pounds ayear and spends six thousand must be poor and embarrassed for money  Let a man's fortune be ever so small if he acts his part in life well he will be always respectable Strive therefore to be contented with what you  have and envy the wealth of no man Improve your income

go to the will his own sack that is carry his own load himself  Whether a man considers himself as a member of society or as a Christian he is responsible for his own conduct Human laws will call him to an account in this life and divine laws in the next  Sensible of this truth the painter has given us a view of the last Judgment when all men will rise from their graves and be summoned before the Almighty to give an account of themselves when those who have lived a good life on earth will be rewarded with everlasting happiness and those who have led a wicked life on earth will be punished with eternal misery  There are some cases where a man will be obliged to answer for the conduct of others but there are none in which he will not be responsible for his own If a man advises his neighbour to do wrong if he assists him in doing it if he sees him going to do it can prevent in and does not he is not only equally guilty with him who does the wrong and liable to be punished in this life but will most assuredly be called to an account in the next not only for his own soul but for that of his neighbour  The receiver  say our laws  is as bad as the thief  that is he who receives stolen goods knowing them to be stolen and does not divulge it is equally liable to be punished with  the thief If such then be the case of things a man should be very careful how be commits sin or gives occasion to others doing it  But though he will thus be obliged to answer for the misconduct of others let no one suppose that if he is urged to do wrong the person urging him will be the only one blamed it is his duty to avoid the wrong and not to listen to illadvisers for  Every Herring must hang by his own Gill  and every one will be punished for his own faults  Future punishment is a serious piece of business and was a man aware of the consequences of a bad life he would not dare to commit a sin A few years on earth is nothing to the endless ages of eternity and he who to gratify an idle passion or a wicked inclination for a short time would risk the chance of being miserably wretched for a long futurity can be no other than a madman On that day of trial when all men will be called before God and his holy angels to give an account of their conduct whilst on earth excuses will stand them in little stead having been led into sin by constitution by unruly passions by ill advisers by example by fashion by interest or any wordly motive will be poor and ineffectual pleas If a man has done well our Saviour  the judge of all the earth will welcome him with a  Come ye
