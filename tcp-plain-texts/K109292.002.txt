 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WORDS esteemed SYNONYMOUS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE  And the Proper CHOICE of them determined TOGETHER WITH So much of Abb√© GIRARD's Treatise on this Subject as would agree with our Mode of Expression  Useful to all who would either write or speak with PROPRIETY and ELEGANCE  VOL II  LONDON Printed for J DODSLEY in  Pallmall  MDCCLXVI  THE SIGNIFICATION OF WORDS esteemed SYNONYMOUS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE INVESTIGATED    Effigy Image Statue  CORPOREAL representation is the common idea of these three words but an  effigy  is to supply the place of the real thing an  image  is to shew the attitude  and design but in miniature a  statue  the same but as large as life  Persons who draw on themselves the popular odium are sometimes hung in  effigy Images  are made of china silver c and set up in houses by way of ornament We erect  statues  of our kings in grateful remembrance of them  To  Give Present Offer  Of these three words that of  give  is generally used in a familiar sense that of  present  in a respectful one that of  offer  in a religious one We  give  to our servants We  present  to princes We  offer  to God  We  give  what we would have received We  present  what we think will be agreeable We  offer  what we imagine will be acceptable  We cannot  give  what does not belong to us nor  offer  what is not in our power but we sometimes  present  what is neither ours nor in our power to  give    Frugality Oeconomy  Frugality  implies only discretion of expence  oeconomy  includes in its idea some kind of management in order to eke matters out  Frugality  is generally the province of the husband whose business is to take care his expences do not exceed his income  oeconomy  is principally the care of the wife whose study is by a prudent management if possible to make up every deficiency    Cloaths Dress  Cloaths  express simply that which covers the body and includes all for that purpose from head to foot and nothing more it is for this reason we say with propriety the necessaries of life consist in meat drink lodging and  cloaths Dress  has a more confined meaning besides that of a bare covering it includes in its idea a relation to form and fashion as well to the ornaments as the necessaries thus we say a Spanish  dress  a Hungarian  dress  a rich  dress  c  Though the sword and cockade cannot be called  cloaths  they are nevertheless part of the  dress  of an officer    Wonder Astonishment Amazement Consternation Surprize  Of these words that of  wonder  implies admiration at something extraordinary  astonishment  is a sudden confusion of mind arising from either fear or  wonder amazement  implies a greater degree of  astonishment consternation  such a degree as almost borders upon horror arising chiefly from dreadful circumstances as to  surprize  it means only being taken unawares  Of all these words  wonder  and  surprize  are supposed to be nearest to each other in signification but even between these may be observed a difference the first being generally considered as relative to things good in themselves the latter with respect to either good or bad We are apt to  wonder  when a bad man does good and be  surprized  when a good man does ill  Besides  wonder  includes in its idea some small degree of consideration  surprize  does not  If a meanspirited person whom I have insulted should come to me in order to sollicit a reconciliation I should naturally say I am  surprized  at his coming but when I reflect on the meanness of his spirit I do not much  wonder  Wonder  and  surprize  act upon the mind  astonishment  and  amazement  upon the senses  consternation  upon the heart  The words  astonishment  and  amazement  equally with that of  surprize  are used be the matter referred to either good or bad but  consternation  is never made use of but with respect to bad  We  wonder  and are  surprized  at the miraculous events of providence We are  astonished  and  amazed  at the extraordinary qualities of the magnet An unexpected calamity will throw us often into the greatest  consternation    Liberality Generosity Bounty  A ready and willing distribution according to our abilities is the general idea of these three words but they have each a particular one as follows  liberality  implies acts of mere giving or spending  generosity  acts of greatness  bounty  acts of kindness  A  liberal  man gives freely a  generous  man nobly and a  bountiful  man charitably  Liberality  is a natural disposition  generosity  proceeds from elevation of sentiment  bounty  from religious motives  Liberality  denotes freedom of spirit  generosity  greatness of soul  bounty  openness of heart  Too great  liberality  borders upon profuseness it then becomes a fault  Generosity  is a princely quality and if it does not exceed the bounds of our abilities is always commendable  Bounty  is an amiable virtue and never goes unrewarded    Prepossessed Opiniated Obstinate Infatuated Headstrong  These epithets denote a folly which consists in being too much wedded to our own opinion but that which is particularized by the word  prepossessed  seems to arise from excess of prejudice which seduces and causes us to think what we have preconceived the best paying little or no regard to the opinions of others In one  opiniated  this folly seems to be the effect of an overfondness for his own notions and a contempt for those of others  Obstinacy  seems to spring from an affected perverseness which renders it intractable and which against the rules of goodbreeding will never give way An  infatuated  person is supposed to be follystruck to suffer some loss of reason which is the occasion of that inflexibility we observe in him As to the word  headstrong  though often used as synonymous  with the above it appears to me to have a greater relation to a man's actions intimating a blind determination that stops his ears to every argument and renders him ungovernable  Prepossessed  and  opiniated  imply a mind strongly prejudiced  obstinate  and  headstrong  an unruly will  infatuated  a wandering in the dark  Thus to be  prepossessed opiniated  or  infatuated  is involuntary to be  obstinate  or  headstrong  voluntary  A person  prepossessed  follows his own opinions after examining in some sort those of others One who is  opiniated  follows his own notions implicitly without ever listning to those of others  Obstinacy  pursues its own way in spite of every opposition and often through mere caprice  Infatuation  acts so strongly as in some measure to take away that reason which is the light of the mind and thus darkening it leads a man into the grossest errors The  headstrong  person often acts through a spirit of opposition and seldom leaves his course till he has completed his ruin  To  Lift Raise  We  lift  in taking any thing up we  raise  in setting it upright or placing according to some order Thus we  lift  a weight c we  raise  the head we  raise  a ladder we  raise  a mast  To  Institute Found  To  Establish Endow  To  institute  is to create and form things having some relation to the author or him who first contrived or laid down the plan To  found  is to give birth to such plan To  establish  is to fix that plan upon a lasting basis To  endow  is to provide the necessaries for its subsistence  After universities were once  instituted  colleges were  founded  though not at first  endowed  since which those noble  institutions  have been well  established  by such  endowments  as do honour to our country    Chance Fortune  Chance  forms neither order or design we neither attribute to it knowledge or will and its events are always very uncertain  Fortune  lays plans and designs but without choice we attribute to it a will without discernment and say that it acts blindly  The chief of our successes are more owing to  chance  than skill it is sometimes a long while before  fortune  will look upon us with a favourable eye    Lot Destiny  Lot  supposes distinctions and a method of decision we attribute to it a hidden determination which keeps us in doubt till the instant it shews itself  Destiny  forms designs dispositions and connections we attribute to it knowledge will and power its views are determined and unalterable  Lot  decides  Destiny  ordains  We observe many so extremely rash as to leave their lives to the  lot  of a die Whatever  destiny  decrees is inevitable because we can neither force its disposition nor see beyond the reach of its light    Religion Piety Devotion  The word  religion  is not considered here as signifying the worship we owe to the Deity and the tribute of our dependance upon him but as denoting a quality of the soul and a disposition of the heart towards God it is in this sense only that it is reputed as synonymous with the other two This disposition then prevents our failing in any part of our duty to the Supreme Being  Piety  makes us acquit ourselves with greater respect and zeal  Devotion  adds to this outwardly a serious composed behaviour  It is sufficient for a worldly person to be  religious piety  agrees best with persons who pride themselves in virtue and as to  devotion  it is the employ of people perfectly recluse  Religion  is more internal  piety  is both internal and external  devotion  is sometimes more external  Where there is no integrity there is no  religion  He who fails in his respect for religious worship fails in  piety Devotion  unless sincere is mocking the Most High    Able Skilful Learned  That knowledge which we can reduce to practice makes us  able  that which requires speculation makes us  skilful  that which fills the memory makes us  learned  We say an  able  preacher or lawyer a  skilful  mathematician or philosopher a  learned  historian or civilian  Able  seems to imply something more extensive  skilful  something more profound  learned  something more universal  We become  able  by long experience  skilful  by deep study  learned  by great reading    Empire Kingdom  These are names given to different dominions whence princes take the title of emperor or king 'tis not however in this alone that their difference consists  It appears to me that the word  empire  conveys an idea of a vast territory composed of various people whereas that of  kingdom  implies one more bounded and intimates the unity of that nation of which it is formed It is perhaps from this difference of idea that the different denomination of states and the titles their princes enjoy take their rise if it is not the only reason it is at least the common one as we may remark in the  empire  of Germany the  empire  of Russia and in the Ottoman  empire  of whose diversity of people and nations the world is well acquainted on the other hand we see in those states which bear the name of  kingdom  such as France Spain Poland c that  the division of provinces does not destroy the unity of the people  There is in  kingdoms  a uniformity of fundamental laws the difference of particular laws arising from different customs which in no respect hurt the unity of political administration It is from this uniformity or single government that the words  king  and  kingdom  take their rise for this reason also though there may be many persons in the administration there is nevertheless but one prince or sovereign minister but it is not the same in  empires  one part of which is sometimes governed by fundamental laws very different from those by which another part of the same  empire  is governed this diversity destroys the unity of government and 'tis the submission of certain chiefs to the command of a general superiour that preserves the union of the state it is also from this right of governing that the words  emperor  and  empire  are derived Hence it is that there are many sovereigns and  kingdoms  in the same  empire  The Roman dominion was originally a  kingdom  being formed of one single people the name  empire  was not given it  till such time as it brought under its subjection other foreign ones who became though in themselves distinct nations members of that state and over whom the Romans established one government tho' they had separate administrations  The advantages we find in the society of a body politic contributes as much on the part of subjects to form  kingdoms  as the desire of governing on the part of princes It was ambition alone that formed the plan of  empires  which were established and are supported chiefly by the force of arms    Power Ability Faculty  These words are explained and taken here in a moral and literal sense They all signify a disposition in the subject by means of which it is capable of acting or producing an effect but that of  power  results from supply or liberty of acting  ability  rises from strength  faculty  from natural properties  A man without the aids of grace has not even the  power  of doing good Youth is in want of wisdom to deliberate old age of  ability  to execute The human mind has the  faculty  of reasoning  Our  power  frequently diminishes by long use Age destroys our  ability  to satisfy the passions though it does not our desires The mind will often lose its  faculties  by accidents happening to the organs of the body    Pleasure Delight  The idea of  pleasure  is of a good much more extensive than that of  delight  because this word relates to a greater number of objects than the other whatever agreeably affects the mind the heart the senses the fortune c produces  pleasure  The idea of  delight  rises upon that of  pleasure  by force of opinion but is nevertheless a good of much less extent with respect to objects it is limited properly to sensation and has a particular relation to good entertainment  True philosophy finds  pleasure  in every occupation There cannot be a greater  delight  than in the true relish of innocent mirth  There is still another sense in which these words are used that in which we say of a person that he gives himself up entirely to  pleasures  that he enjoys the  delights  of the country Taken in this last sense they have equally as in the other their differences and particular niceties Thus  pleasures  relate more to personal practice such as customs pastimes and recreations  delights  more to the charms which are furnished by nature art and opulence such as sweet habitations studied conveniences and choice company    Content Satisfaction  Content  alludes properly to that inward serenity of heart which renders the soul sedate and composed  Satisfaction  relates more to the passions being a change owing to some success in which we hug ourselves  No restless or turbulent man can ever enjoy true  content Satisfaction  hardly ever accompanies immoderate ambition    Excursion Ramble Jaunt  Excursion  supposes a pleasurable expedition to some distant place determined on some time before  Ramble  implies an irregular roving in places unthought of till the time we arrive there By  jaunt  is understood a walk or journey agreeable to the person who takes it but held in contempt by others or considered as an act of levity  We say innocent  excursions  wild  rambles  and imprudent  jaunts  Excursions  are necessary to persons in a sedentary way of life in order to unbend the mind and exercise the body  Rambling  is an evident sign of an unsteady disposition  Jaunts  in parties of pleasure have been often attended with calamitous consequences    Alehouse Publichouse  Nothing is more common than the general use of these terms to express one and the same thing but with great impropriety though every  alehouse  is undoubtedly a  publichouse  it does not follow that every  publichouse  is an  alehouse Publichouse  is a more extensive expression implying a house open for the entertainment of the public whereas  alehouse  is more limited denoting a particular species of  publichouses  that which is appropriated to the sale of beer Thus taverns coffeehouses c are  publichouses  but not  alehouses  Gentlemen frequent many  publichouses  without any sort of disgrace but it always lessens their character to be seen in an  alehouse    Lie Falsehood  Contrariety to truth is the general idea of these two words but that of  lie  supposes always something criminal whereas that of  falsehood  does not  If questioned in a cause wherein bound to tell the truth we do not we are guilty of a  lie  if we deviate from truth where there is no such obligation it is no other than a  falsehood  Lies  are always sinful  falsehoods  many times justifiable A  lie  is an offence to God and a disgrace to man A beneficial  falsehood  is preferable to a destructive truth    Sea Ocean  By  sea  is understood a large body of water opposed to land confined within certain bounds by  ocean  a much larger body whose utmost verge is not particularly known Thus we say the Baltic  sea  the Mediterranean  sea  the Adriatic  sea  but the Western  ocean  the Atlantic  ocean  the Pacific  ocean  So again the wide  sea  but the vast  ocean    Social Sociable  Of these two words that of  social  relates more to a christianlike disposition that of  sociable  more to a familiar one  'Tis goodness of heart that makes a man  social  sweetness of temper that makes him  sociable  Humanity benevolence beneficence friendship c are the  social  virtues goodnature goodhumour condescention c are the qualities that render  sociable    Luxury Voluptuousness  In the general sense of these words  luxury  implies a giving one's self up to pleasure  voluptuousness  an indulgence in the same to excess  The  luxury  of a people is the forerunner of their ruin The  voluptuous  man wallows in sensuality and is void of the feelings of humanity  Besides this distinction there is one far more delicate and refined and which requires some attention to be thoroughly  conceived Notwithstanding custom has always made use of the word  voluptuousness  in a bad sense equally with that of  luxury  it appears to me that it may sometimes be used with propriety in a good one To comprehend this properly it must first be considered that  luxury  implies gross corporal indulgence only  voluptuousness  mental as well as corporal Thus ebriety epicurism venery c are each a species of  luxury  but we may be  voluptuous  even in things innocent in themselves as in the rapturous enjoyment of a fine prospect the studied delightfulness of a rural retreat  In this sense  lust  indulged to excess is  luxury  love indulged to excess  voluptuousness    Sober Temperate Abstemious  A man may be  sober  and not  temperate temperate  yet not  abstemious  In that sense in which these words are reputed synonymous  sobriety  implies present freedom from the power of strong liquor  temperance  signifies moderation in drinking and by  abstemiousness  is understood a refraining from all sorts of liquor that may intoxicate  Some men who have the character of being  sober  very little deserve it as their freedom from intoxication is more owing to strength of constitution which resists the force of strong drink than to the virtue of  temperance  An  abstemious  person practices the virtue of selfdenial and by a rigid abstinence from all liquors that may hurt him keeps his head clear and his constitution sound  A  sober  man may drink much and not be affected with it A  temperate  man drinks little An  abstemious  man drinks not at all  Note  By the word  drink  here is meant the use of strong drink    Sharp Sour Acid  These words express different degrees of sourness  sharp  implies sourness without astringency or a small degree of sourness Thus wine beer c grow frequently  sharp  by long keeping  Sour  includes in its idea little or no acrimony Thus cyder vinegar verjuice c are  sour  but palatable made so for use By  acid  is understood a corrosive  sour  as the  acid  lemon the  acid  vitriol c    Unreasonable Inconsistent Absurd  The general idea of these three words is incongruity but that of  unreasonable  implies rather nonagreeableness to reason that of  inconsistent  contrariety of act or argument where one part destroys the other that of  absurd  seems to intimate both  Nothing can be more  unreasonable  than requesting the services of another to his detriment he who complies with such request would act very  inconsistently  and both would commit the grossest  absurdity  He who endeavours to raise his own name by crushing that of another acts  unreasonably  He who would be thought a man of sense and learning and strives to support that character by a contumelious contempt of others acts  inconsistently  He who is culpable in either of these particulars acts  absurdly    Abstinence Fast  Abstinence  implies a forbearance from such food as is supposed to pamper the flesh  fast  a refraining from all sorts of food Wednesdays and Fridays are appointed by the church as days of  abstinence  AshWednesday and GoodFriday as  fast  days    Contiguous Adjacent  By the word  contiguous  is understood so situated as to touch by  adjacent  so lying as having nothing of the same kind between Thus one house or one room is  contiguous  to another but we say an  adiacent  church the  adjacent  village  The true sense then of these words is that  contiguous  implies actual contact  adjacent  only hard by    Benevolence Beneficence  Of these two words one is the intention the other the act  benevolence  being the desire of doing good  beneficence  actual goodness  A  benevolent  man delights in  beneficence  Providence has sufficiently evinced its love to mankind by planting in our nature a  benevolent  disposition and rewarding the effect of that disposition  beneficence    Acquainted Familiar Intimate  A slight or initial knowledge of any one constitutes  acquaintance  To be  familiar  requires an  acquaintance  of some standing  Intimacy  supposes such an  acquaintance  as is supported by friendship  These words then rise one upon the other by gradation  intimacy  resulting from close  familiarity  which proceeds from long  acquaintance  Those who are apt to be  familiar  on a slight  acquaintance  will never acquire any degree of  intimacy  as forwardness of that sort generally meets with the contempt of mankind    Pillar Column  By the word  Pillar  is understood a supporter of some roof by the word  column  a particular kind of  pillar  that which is round thus every  column  is a  pillar  tho' every  pillar  is not a  column  In most buildings where the beauty of the architecture is studied  columns  are generally insulated whereas square  pillars  are for the most part set within a wall shewing only a fourth or fifth part of their thickness    Servitude Slavery  The state of a hired servant is  servitude  that of one mancipated is  slavery  the one is voluntary the other involuntary  Servitude  is a kind of willing bondage if the expression may be admitted  Slavery  is a yoke dreaded by all mankind  Servitude  is in some measure honourable  Slavery  generally contemptible  All persons strictly speaking are in a state of reputable  servitude  with respect to one another but  slavery  has been ever considered as derogatory to the character of man    Amusement Diversion  The general idea of these words is innocent recreation but that of  amusement  implies tranquil entertainment that of  diversion  tumultuous merriment  Cardplaying concerts plays c are  amusements  cricket cudgelplaying horseraces c are  diversions  Some persons are so quietly inclined as to find great  amusement  in reading while others are of such a riotous disposition as to imagine all  diversion  consists in uproar and confusion    Satire Lampoon  Satire  is general being a poem in which the folly and wickedness of the times are severely censured written with an intent to reform  Lampoon  is a poem also but personal containing invective reflections against one person in particular with a design only to vex  A  satire  then is commendable a  lampoon  scurrilous The lash of  satire  has been often found more beneficial to a state than the scourge of power The writer of a  lampoon  may be well compared to a bee whose sting wounds but slightly and whose malicious act is sure to be punished by the whole swarm    Steeple Spire Tower  By these three words is meant a high building raised above the main edifice but that of  steeple  is more general those of  spire  and  tower  more particular  Steeple  implies the turret of a church be it of what form soever By  spire  is understood a  steeple  rising taper to the top By  tower  is implied a square  steeple  Spire  and  tower  then are certain kinds of  steeples  The  steeple  of St Bride's church London is a  spire  the  steeple  of St Andrew's a  tower  The words  steeple  and  spire  are never applied but to churches The word  tower  is sometimes made use of with respect to other large edifices  In former times palaces and gentlemen's seats were commonly built with  towers  such as the  tower  at St James's London the  tower  at Lord Rochfort's feat at St Ofyth Essex  Spires  are generally erected upon  towers  Bells are usually hung in  towers  weathercocks commonly fixed on  spires    Religion Persuasion  The sense in which these words are held as synonymous is that of a certain system of divine faith and worship But that which  religion  implies seems to be one more general and established that which is understood by  persuasion  more particular and vague  By  persuaston  then is meant a deviation from some settled  religion  The divine systems of the church of England and of the church of Rome  are  religions  those of a Presbyterian and a Lutheran are  persuasions    Letter Epistle  Custom has made the word  letter  of more general use than  epistle letter  being quite familiar  epistle  rather pedantic but this is not the only observation I would make  Letter  appears to me more proper when the matter relates to private correspondence  epistle  when the business is public Thus we say  letters  of friendship  letters  of business but if these  letters  relate to public matters or appear in print we may with elegance call them  epistles  as Paul's  epistles  Ovid's  epistles  Melmoth's  epistles    Gold Golden  The present age has made an innovation with respect to these two words converting the substantive  gold  into an adjective and altering the sense of  golden  which in reality implies made of  gold  into that of gilt In this corrupted sense then I am obliged to consider them as such the word  gold  relates to the metal of which a thing is made that of  golden  to the hue it bears Thus we say a  gold  ring a  gold  watch a  gold  buckle but the  golden  lion the  golden  head the  golden  lamp That these ideas are often confused is very evident as we sometimes hear of a  golden  cup or a  golden  ewer Should it be said such a one stole a  golden  cup from the house with the  golden  lamp we must either imagine that both cup  and lamp were of solid  gold  or that they were only gilt    Endeavour Effort  Endeavour  is labour directed to some certain end  effort  is a laborious  endeavour  When we would accomplish a design we use our  endeavours  if we meet with any considerable and unexpected obstacles in the way we apply our utmost  efforts    Mute Silent  By  mute  is understood incapability of speech by  silent  a voluntary forbearance  In eastern countries nobles have mute attendants  Silence  is a mark of wisdom  A man had sometimes better be absolutely  mute  than inadvertently betray himself as is frequently the case by too great a volubility and which  Silence  only would prevent    Beam Rafter  Tho' the distinction of these words may be thought useless to the general reader yet to him it is more particularly serviceable they being seldom if ever confused by the carpenter or builder By  beam  then is meant the main piece of timber that supports the house by  rafter  the secondary timber which is let into the great  beam  To make them better understood  beams  are those timbers that girt the top of a building  rafters  those that support the tiling    Room Chamber Apartment  With respect to the two first  room  is a general expression  chamber  a particular one  Room  implies any divided part of a house  Chamber  is a  room  appropriated to sleep in  By  apartment  is understood a set of  rooms  convenient to dwell in  We say a spacious  room  a snug  chamber  a commodious  apartment  Some  chambers  are so contrived as to conceal the bed and make the  room  fit to entertain company Many families of slender fortune choose rather to live in elegant  apartments  than in indifferent houses    House Tenement  The present signification of these words is that  house  means a dwelling distinct by itself  tenement  part of a house divided off for the use of another family  We say a spacious magnificent  house  a snug pretty  tenement  Large  houses  which the owners find difficult to set to one family are frequently converted into small  tenements  and let out to many    Lodging Apartment  Lodging  relates more to a set of rooms appropriated to a family in some private house  apartment  more to a convenient dwelling in some public edifice  The first or second story of a house let out is called a  lodging  any particular range of rooms in a large building so allotted as to contain a number of families one over another is called an  apartment  As the  apartments  in an hospital the  apartments  in an inn of court the  apartments  in a palace  It is in some respect mean to live in a  lodging  but persons of great fortune have dwelt with credit in  apartments    Warmth Fervency  Considering these words in a religious sense that of  fervency  seems to rise upon  warmth warmth  implying a flame of devotion in opposition to coolness  fervency  great heat of mind as opposed to coldness  Warmth  is in some measure necessary it will make us punctual in the exercise of our duty thro' a sense of gratitude and affection  fervency  has a dangerous tendency it will if not kept within due bounds drive men into enthusiasm  Warmth  is the offspring of a good heart  fervency  of a weak mind  Warmth  makes the heart beat high in the cause of God  Fervency  will carry us into a vain considence of having some intercourse with the Deity    Plenty Abundance  By  plenty  is understood enough and some little to spare by  abundance  more than enough or a considerable deal over  He that wants but a yard of cloth and possesses a yard and a quarter has  plenty  he that needs but one yard and has several may be said to have  abundance  A contented man will be satisfied tho' he should fall short of  plenty  but the covetous man is still grasping for more even though he enjoys  abundance    Surmise Suspicion  Surmise  is imagination in general without certain knowledge  Suspicion  is imagination of some ill without proof  Surmise  is often used with respect to things good in themselves  suspicion  never but with regard to things that are ill  Surmise  is an imperfect notion or a kind of conjecture rising in a great measure from curiosity  suspicion  supposes a degree of fear and jealousy concerning things not known  We should never build an opinion upon bare  surmise  which is at best but a sandy foundation  Suspicion  is in reality its own tormentor raising in the mind a thousand apprehensions which is no easy matter afterwards to quell    Sequel Conclusion  Sequel  is the succeeding part  conclusion  the close  The  sequel  continues the  conclusion  ends  A story is unintelligible without its  sequel  but not so without its  conclusion  the  conclusion  being comprehended in few words the  sequel  requiring many  The  sequel  in part forms the story the  conclusion  puts the finishing stroke to it  Before we pass any judgment on what we hear we should attend to the  sequel  and wait till the  conclusion  To  Disperse Scatter  The act of spreading abroad is the general idea of these two words but that of  disperse  seems to imply some sort of order and care that of  scatter  means to throw about loosely and carelesly  In order to sow a field we  disperse  the seed in different places He who  scatters  his wealth without making a proper use of it will one day come to want  To  disperse  is always voluntary to  scatter  is frequently involuntary  When a family of children are come to years of maturity they generally  disperse  themselves into various parts It is almost impossible to carry a load of hay from one place to another without  scattering  some of it    New Fresh Recent  That which has not been used is  new  that which is not stale is  fresh  that which has just happened is  recent  We say of cloaths that they are  new  of topics that they are  fresh  of actions that they are  recent  A thought is  new  by the turn we give it  fresh  by the sense it expresses  recent  by the time of its production  New  things carry with them a creditable appearance  Fresh  matters are food for tatlers We are more affected with  recent  stories than with those of long date    Expression Word  These words have been treated of before when that of  expression  was considered as implying a phrase of speech but there being another sense in which it is used as synonymous with  word  it may not be unnecessary to shew the difference between them and as the distinction is very delicate we must view it with attention  Expression  then represents the meaning a  word  expresses the idea which we employ to form that meaning It is in order to use the  expression  that the  word  is established The first is natural general and universal among all men the second is arbitrary and different according to the varied custom of the people The YES and the No are always and in all places  the same  expressions  that is they carry the same meaning but that meaning is not expressed by the same  words  in all languages and on all occasions  We have the gift of  expression  and the knowledge of  words  we give a turn and justness to the one we choose and range the others  The production of sense and formation of a proposition are what we expect from an  expression  but a  word  is commonly of no other value than to make a part of that sense or of that proposion Thus  expressions  differ among themselves according to the difference of the senses they bear and  words  differ among themselves either by the simple articulation of the voice or by the difrent ideas they convey A  word  is no otherwise bad than by its not being in use in the polite world  A variety of  expressions  proceeds not always from the fertility and extent of the mind An abundance of  words  enriches  not the language unless those  words  convey an abundance of ideas    Not No  Not  barely expresses the negation  no  strengthens and seems to affirm it The first often denies the thing in part only or with limitation the second denies it always absolutely wholly and without reserve Thus we say he has  not  money he has  not  patience meaning he is  not  overburthened with either but when we say he has  no  money he has  no  patience we would be understood to say he has none at all  It is on account of this limitation that the word  not  is generally used in company with those words that mark either  the degree of quality or quantity such as MUCH VERY ONE and the like  There is  not  commonly  much  money to be found in the possession of men of letters The major part of those who frequent divine service are  not very  devout It often happens that he who has  not one  single penny in his pocket is much happier than many rich men    Great Sublime  These words here are considered in no other sense than as they relate to language in which that of  great  seems to me to have more relation to the learning or the nature of the subjects we treat of and that of  subtime  more to the spirit and manner in which we treat them  Lock on Human Understanding is a very  great  work Milton's Paradise Lost is very  sublime  one  Great  or scientific pieces are often starched and discover the labour of the author but  sublime  pieces tho' composed with a great deal of art seem always natural  Studied words known only to the learned joined to profound and metaphysical reasonings form the  great  or elevated stile expressions equally just and brilliant joined to beautiful thoughts finely and nobly turned constitute the  sublime  It is not possible for every work to be  great  but it may be  sublime sublime  works however are more rare than  great  ones  To  Excell  be  Excellent  To  excell  supposes a comparison is being superior to all of the like kind excludes equals and is applied to all sorts of objects To  be excellent  is being in the highest degree without any sort of comparison it admits of equals and agrees best with things of taste Thus we say that Titian  excelled  in colouring Michael Angelo in design and that Garrick is an  excellent  actor  Persons who  excell  in any particular art gain a name The more  excellent  the meats the more dangerous the feasting    Lazy Indolent  A  lazy  man never goes through with an undertaking An  indolent  man will undertake nothing The first wants courage and resolution he stops he turns he fears and changes presently The second wants will and emulation one cannot animate or make him sensible  The  lazy  man is a burthen to society The  indolent  man is an enemy to himself  To  Name Call  As much as these words differ in in their meaning they are nevertheless used frequently to express the same idea the absurdity of which is gross We  name  to distinguish in conversation we  call  as for help when wanted  The Lord  called  every living creature before Adam and he  named  them  It is not proper to  name  all things by their names nor  call  all sorts of people to our assistance    Quality Talent  Qualities  form the character of persons  talents  are their ornament The first render them either good or bad and have a great influence over their morals The second make them useful or entertaining and go a great way towards making them esteemed  We may use the word  quality  either in a good or bad sense but we cannot take that of  talent  in any other than a good one  Man is a mixture of good and bad  qualities  sometimes so strange as to possess the extremes of each There are persons possessed of such  talents  as make themselves  admired and yet give some pain to others who would be witnesses of them but in this case I should think it more eligible to endure the caprice of the entertaining than the disagreeableness of the tiresome  The  qualities  of the heart are more essential those of the mind more brilliant  Talents  which are of use in necessity are more necessary those which conduce to entertainment are best rewarded  Our  qualities  render us either beloved or despised Our  talents  make our company coveted  Excellent  qualities  joined to rare  talents  constitute great worth  To  Extol Praise  We  extol  a person to procure him the esteem of others or raise his reputation we  praise  him to testify the esteem we have for him or to applaud him  To  extol  is to say a great deal in the favour of others and ascribe to them great qualities whether they possess them or not To  praise  is to approve with a kind of admiration whatever they say or do whether they deserve it or no  We  extol  the abilities of a man we  praise  his conduct  The word  extol  supposes that the person of whom we speak and the person to whom we speak are diffrent which the word  praise  does not  Quacks never fail to  extol  themselves they promise always more than they can perform and pride themselves in an imaginary esteem Conceited persons frequently  praise  themselves and are generally well satisfied with that  praise  It is far more ridiculous in my opinion for a man to  praise  himself than  extol  himself for we  extol  ourselves through a desire of having the esteem of others which is a vanity one may look over but when we are guilty of self  praise  it is done through the great esteem we have for ourselves which is a pride insufferable    Darkness Obscurity  Darkness  seems to signify something real in opposition to light  Obscurity  is a mere privation of brightness  We say often of  darkness  that it is thick of  obscurity  that it is great  Considering them in a figurative sense  darkness  implies a state of life in which we are shut up from the world as the state of a hermit the state of a recluse By  obscurity  is understood a state of retirement or a state unnotic'd as when we retreat into the country far from the observation of the public eye  He who lives in a state of  darkness  is useless to society and dead as it were to mankind He who lives in a state of  obscurity  enjoys a serenity unknown to him who revels in the open world  To  Feel Handle  We  feel  lightly we  handle  with the full hand  We  feel  a column to know whether it be made of marble or wood we  handle  stuff to know what strength it has or what body it is of  It often happens that a thing though disagreeable to the eye shall be agreeable to  feel  There is no pleasure in  handling  any thing that is rough    Translation Version  Translation  relates to the turning into modern language  version  into ancient Thus the English Bible is a  translation  but the Latin Greek Arabic and Syriac Bibles are  versions  Translations  to be perfectly good should be neither more or less ornamented than the originals The antient  versions  of scripture have acquired almost as much authority as the Hebrew text  A new  translation  of Virgil and Horace would still please notwithstanding the many that have appeared The time when the  version  of the Septuagint was made is unknown    Vile Bad  Although the first of these words is not in very general use with respect to the sense in which I would here consider it yet it is not so entirely disused but that I may characterise it without fear of impropriety As to the second word it is not here taken in all its significations but in that only in which it is used as synonymous with the first  Uselessness and little or no value make a thing  vile  Defect and loss of merit render it  bad  Thence it is we say in a mystic sense that we are  vile  creatures intimating that we are nothing with respect to God or that he does not stand in need of our services and that we say he is a  bad  christian who is void of faith or who has through sin lost the grace of baptism  He is a  vile  subject who is fit for nothing or who cannot be of any service to the community He is a  bad  subject who will not attempt to do good but gives way to every vicious inclination  A  vile  man is contemptible and becomes the outcast of the world A  bad  man is condemnable and draws upon himself the hatred of every honest person  In speaking of useful things as stuffs linen and the like the word  vile  rises upon that of  bad  That which has been much used but will still serve upon an occasion is  bad  that which cannot be used any more or that we cannot  use  with credit is  vile  Bad  cloaths are not always a mark of poverty There is sometimes more pride under a covering of  vile  rags than under that of gold and purple    Matter Subject  Matter  is that which we use in the work  subject  is that on which we work  The  matter  of a discourse consists in the words in the phrases and in the thoughts the  subject  is that which we explain by those words those phrases and those thoughts  The reasonings the passages of holy writ the characters of passions and the maxims of morality are the  matter  of sermons the mysteries of faith and the precepts of the gospel ought to be the  subject  To  Mask Disguise  In order to  mask  it is necessary to cover the face with a false visage but to  disguise  it is sufficient to change the common appearance  We  mask  ourselves to go to a ball We  disguise  ourselves to bring about an intrigue    View Prospect  The sight of something distant is the general idea of these words but that of  view  seems in my opinion to imply a sight more extensive than that of  propect  Thus we say a little or confined  prospect  but a long or extended  view  Besides there seems to be less variety in a  view  than in a  prospect  Thus we say the pleasing  prospect  of the neighbouring villages The fine  view  of a distant mountain    Hovel Shed  A  hovel  is a small place indifferently run up with mud walls in order to preserve things from the weather a  shed  is a supported roof only a place covered overhead but open on the sides generally erected as a dry standingplace for carts or other things  Hovels  are seldom seen but in country places  sheds  frequently in towns  The poor in many parts of the kingdom are reduced to the necessity of dwelling  in huts very little better than  hovels  Happy is the traveller in bad weather to take shelter even under a  shed    Oval Oblong  By  oval  we mean that which is regularly so by  oblong  that which resembles the longitudinal section of an egg whether regular or not  Tables are frequently made  oblong  tho' not exactly  oval  We may say with propriety that an  oval  is  oblong  though custom will not admit us to invert the expression    Mist Fog  By  mist  is understood a thin cloud hanging very low or rain so extremely small as not to be perceived in drops By  fog  is implied a moist vapour near the surface of the land or water so dense as to obscure the sight  The  mist  falls the  fog  rises  A  mist  prevents our seeing things at some distance a  fog  those immediately before us  Some days are so extremely  misty  as to obstruct prospects others so very  foggy  as to be unhealthy and mislead the traveller in his way    Genteel Elegant  Genteel  implies something above the common run  elegant  means beautiful without grandeur  Genteel  carries with it the idea of something reputable  elegant  of something tasty  By a house  genteely  furnished is understood a house containing every necessary good and creditable by  elegantly  furnished is meant  genteely  and in such a manner as to please without elevation  Genteel  relates more to the neatness and goodness of the furniture  elegant  more to the disposition of it  A man's notions are discovered in the  genteelness  of his house his taste in the  elegance  To  Beat Strike  In order to  beat  we must redouble the blows but to  strike  we need give only one  We are never  beaten  without being  struck  but we are often  struck  without being  beat  We never  beat  but with design we often  strike  by accident  Wise men have said that the rod should be always on the back of children those therefore who have the bringing of them up should never think differently however we are to interpret these words no otherwise than alluding to fear not imagining that we are to be constantly  beating  them for nothing is more opposite to good education than the example of violent conduct and severe discipline The preceptor who  strikes  his pupil does it oftener through hastiness of temper than design of correction    Coward Poltron  The  coward  will fire up upon the least offence but proceed no farther The  poltron  is so meanly spirited as through want of courage to take every insult calmly  The  coward  draws back the  poltron  dares not advance  Cowards  they say will fight when desperate We must not depend on the succour of a  poltron  To  Think Study Muse  We  think  quietly and orderly to be thoroughly acquainted with our object We  study  with inquietude and without order to attain our wishes We  muse  deeply to pass away the time agreeably  The philosopher  thinks  on the arrangement of his system A person in difficulty  studies  for expedients how to get out of it The solitary lover  muses  on his mistress  I have often remarked that obscure things frequently appear clear to those who know not how to  think  properly they comprehend but are not able to explain It is an act of prudence to  study  to avert such evils as threaten us The pleasure of  musing  is perhaps most agreeable but less useful    Sign Signal  The  sign  makes known and is sometimes natural The  signal  gives notice and is always arbitrary The appearances of the face are commonly the  signs  of what passes in the heart The hoisting of a flag in one ship is a  signal  to another  We make ourselves understood by the deaf by  signs  The readiest way of making persons understand us at a distance is by  signals    Only Alone  When speaking of a thing we make use of the word  only  we mean there is no other of the same kind when that of  alone  that it is not accompanied with any other  A child that has neither brother or sister is an  only  child A person when by himself is said to be  alone  That thing must be very rare of which we can find  only  one Nothing is more tiresome than to be always  alone    Love Gallantry  As different as these words may appear they have nevertheless been and are still frequently used as synonymous when intended to imply courtship It may not be then unnecessary to point out their peculiar ideas  Love  is more sanguine than  gallantry  having for its object the person whom we are studious to please through a view of possessing and whom we love as much on her account as our own it takes possession of the heart suddenly and owes its birth to a certain something which enchains the sentiments and draws the esteem without any examination or information  Gallantry  is more sensual than  love  having for its object the sex we enter into intrigues in hopes of enjoying it and love  more on our own account than on that of our mistress It acts upon the senses much more than upon the heart and is more owing to constitution and complexion than to the force of beauty  The one has a power of making those persons agreeable in our eyes who study to please the object of our love provided they in no respect raise our jealousy The other engages us to keep an eye upon all those who are capable either of forwarding or hurting our designs and to watch them as we would a rival taking every advantage within our reach  The first leaves us not the liberty of choice it commands in the beginning as a master and reigns afterwards as a tyrant till we are accustomed to its chains by length of time or till they are broken by the efforts of powerful reason or the caprice of continued vexation The second suffers sometimes another passion to get before it reason and interest often hold the bridle and make it give way to our situation and affairs  Love  attaches us solely to one person and delivers up our heart without reserve  so as to engage it wholly and make every other object of what beauty or merit soever indifferent to us  Gallantry  rivets us generally to all persons who are either beautiful or agreeable and unites us to those who make the least returns to our eagerness and desire in such a manner however as leaves us no liking for others  It appears to me that  love  delights in difficulties so far from being weakened by obstacles they generally increase it and we make it one of our most serious engagements As for  gallantry  it banishes formality is less accustomed to difficulty and is often entered into merely for amusement It is for this reason we observe more spirit of  gallantry  in men than  love  for it is rare to find a first  love  followed by a second and I doubt whether ever it can be said by a third but  gallantries  are sometimes without number and succeed each other till that age arrives when their source is dried up  There is always honesty in  love  but it is troublesome and capricious we consider it nowadays as a distemper or as a weakness of mind In  gallantry  there  is a degree of knavery but it is free and good humoured and is become the taste of the age  Love  designs on the imagination the flattering idea of eternal happiness in the entire and constant possession of the object we  love Gallantry  fails not to paint there the agreeable image of a singular pleasure in the enjoyment of the object we pursue but neither the one nor the other copies after nature experience shewing us that their colours however agreeable are equally deceitful All the difference we find is that  love  being more serious the unfaithfulness of its pencil gives greater offence and the recollection of the pain it has given in seeing it so ill rewarded creates our disgust whereas  gallantry  being more wanton we are less sensible of the fallacy of its colouring and the vain notions we have of being arrived at the end of its designs reconcile any disappointments we may have met with  In  love  it is the heart which principally tastes the pleasure the mind making itself a slave without any regard and the satisfaction of the senses contributing less  to the sweet enjoyment than a certain contentedness of soul which produces the charming idea of being in the possession of what we love and receiving the most sensible proofs of a tender return In  gallantry  the heart is less affected with the object the mind being more free to indulge itself and the senses more attentive to their own satisfaction partake the pleasure with greater equality voluptuousness contributing more to its enjoyment than the delicacy of sentiments  When we are too much tormented by the caprices of  love  we endeavour to disentangle ourselves and become indifferent When we are too fatigued by the exercises of  gallantry  we take a resolution to desist and become sober  Excess makes  love  degenerate into jealousy and  gallantry  into libertinism In the first case we are subject to trouble of mind in the second we are in danger of destroying our health  Upon the whole  love  is generally justifiable  gallantry  always blameable  To  Lower Let down  We make use of the word  lower  with respect to diminishing the height of things or to certain motions of a body we  lower  a beam we  lower  the sails of a ship we  lower  a building we  lower  the eyes the head We use the expression  let down  with regard to things made to cover others and which being lifted up leave them uncovered we  let down  the lid of a trunk we  let down  the eyelids we  let down  the lappets or the gown  The contrary of to  lower  is to raise that of to  let down  is to lift up  To  lower  is in use in the neuter sense to  let down  is not  Rivers  lower  in the summer Tall persons are obliged to  lower  their heads when they pass through small doorways It is dangerous to  let  ourselves  down  as advantages are frequently taken of it It is not  a prince's  letting  himself  down  even to familiarity that acquires him the reputation of being good but the mildness and equity of his government    Plant Herb  A  Plant  is any vegetable production arising from seed but seems confined to such as are not very large Thus saplings are the largest that should be called  plants Herbs  are those  plants  whose stalks are soft and have no woody substance in them such as grass hemlock c  The knowledge of  plants  is both useful and entertaining There are many medicinal qualities in  herbs  To  Grow Increase  Things  grow  by the nourishment they receive they  increase  by the addition that is made to them of the same kind Corn  grows  the harvest  increases  The better we manure the land the faster the trees  grow  and the more our revenues  increase  The word  grow  signifies only the augmentation independant of that which occasions it The word  increase  gives us to understand that that augmentation is caused by a fresh quantity which casually joins it Thus to say that the river  grows  larger is to say only that the water is risen without expressing that it is become so by the arrival of an additional quantity of water but to say that the river is  increased  is to say that it is swelled by  a fresh quantity of water This distinction is extremely delicate it is for this reason therefore that we make use of the words  grow  and  increase  indifferently on many occasions where that delicacy of choice is of no great importance as in the example I have mentioned for we may say with equal propriety that a river either  grows  larger or  increases  although each of these words has its particular idea But there are other occasions where it is proper and sometimes even necessary to pay a regard to the peculiar idea and make some kind of choice between these terms according to the strength of meaning we would give our thoughts for example when we would be understood to say speaking of the passions that they are in our nature and that the nourishment we take to support life at the same time gives strength to them the use of the word  grow  would be elegant Otherwise we might employ that of  increase  with respect either to the passions or the talents of the mind  The passions in general receive birth and  grow  with the man but there are some which exist but for a time and which after having  increased  to a certain age diminish and disappear with the powers of nature there are others which last the whole life and which are always  increasing  so as to be stronger in old age than in youth  Love which forms itself in infancy  grows  with age True courage never brags it  increases  at the sight of danger Ambition  grows  proportionably as our wealth  increases  It is easy to see through all these examples that one of these words will agree in some places in which the other will not for what person is so little delicate in expressing himself as not to perceive by his natural taste if not on reflexion that there is more propriety in saying ambition  grows  proportionably as our wealth  increases  than to say ambition  increases  proportionably as our wealth  grows  If it is not difficult to perceive this delicacy it is  to explain the reason of it to do this I must express myself a little metaphysically and have recourse to such ideas as may enable me to explain it these ideas however shall be no other than the proper ones Since wealth consists in many different things which unite themselves in the possession of one single person the word  increase  which as I have said before denotes the addition of a fresh quantity agrees better with it than that of  grow  which precisely marks the augmentation of one single thing caused by some sort of nourishment For this same reason the word  grow  agrees best with ambition it being a single passion to which wealth serves as a kind of nutriment to support it and make it act with more force and ardour  Corporeal things  grow  by an inward and mechanical addition which is in effect their proper and real nutriment they  increase  by the bare outward addition of a fresh quantity of the same matter Spiritual things  grow  by a kind of nourishment  considered in a figurative sense they  increase  by the addition of degrees they bear  An egg does not begin to  grow  in the ovaria till it teems that is till fruitfulness has made it fit to receive nourishment nor does it leave the body till its bulk is sufficiently  increased  to cause an alteration in the membrane that encloses it  Our pride  grows  in proportion as we exalt ourselves and  increases  sometimes till we become contemptible in the eyes of the world  To  Rise Get up  To change our posture from recumbent to erect is the true meaning of the verb to  rise  whereas to  get up  implies rather to climb thus we  rise  from the ground we  rise  from our bed we  rise  from our seat We  get up  stairs we  get up  a ladder    Copy Model  The sense in which these words are reputed synonymous does not instantly present itself to the reader the first glance of the eye that shews us a  copy  made after an original work and  a model  made as the original of a work throws them so far distant from each other as not to admit the least similitude but a second reflection will make us sensible that custom has used these two words under one common idea on many occasions and that to denote equally the original after which a work is made and the work made after the original  copy  having been understood as well as  model  to mean the first work by which we form the second and  model  as  well as  copy  the second work formed after the first Thus then they have been considered as in a manner doubly synonymous but they have each their peculiar ideas as follow  In the first sense  copy  should be never used but with respect to the manuscript of an author upon which the printer works  Model  may be used on every other occasion as well with respect to morality as the arts  A proof sheet is not often very incorrect unless the  copy  is so Booksellers who often refuse to purchase excellent  copies  frequently buy bad ones at too great a price There is no perfect  model  of virtue I should imagine that the arts and sciences would gain more ground if artists and authors would pursue more their own genius than imitate the  models  they meet with  In the second sense  copy  is used for painting  model  for relief A  copy  ought to be faithful a  model  just The second of these words seems to suppose a greater resemblance than the first  Some  copies  are so extremely well performed as to be little inferior to the originals  Models  of antiquity are frequently more expressive than modern originals    Precision Abstraction  The common idea of these two words is that of a separation made by the force of the mind in the consideration of objects but difficult as it is to find out their peculiar ideas and determine their respective characteristics I have attempted it in the best manner I am able  Precision  then separates things distinct in themselves in order to prevent the confusion which arises from a jumble of  ideas  Abstraction  if I may use the expression separates things that are in themselves inseparable in order to consider them apart independent one of another The first is the effect of the justness and clearness of the understanding which prevents our adding any thing that is useless or foreign to the subject we treat of consequently it will agree in every circumstance either with respect to affairs or sciences The second is the effort of a metaphysical mind which removes from the point of view all that we would detach from the subject it in some respect mutilates but sometimes contributes to the discovery of truth and sometimes draws it into error We may however use it but with care  It appears to me that  precision  is more applicable to things which may not only be considered apart but may be conceived to be one without the other such as for example alms and charity and  abstraction  more particularly to things which may indeed be considered apart but which cannot be conceived to  be one without the other as body and size Thus the design of  precision  is to prevent a wandering from the subject removing for that purpose all that is foreign to it and that of  abstraction  to obviate our entering into the utmost extent of it considering only one part without any regard to the other  There is no science more certain or more clear than that of geometry it making very exact  precisions  There are however certain metaphysical  abstractions  blended with it which make geometricians fall into errors equally with others not indeed when size and quantity are in question but with respect to physics  Our ideas cannot be too  precise  but it is sometimes dangerous to have them too  abstracted  The first is the surer way of arriving at the truth in science and our aim in affairs whereas the second often puts us farther from both  Precision  is the gift of nature receiving its birth with the mind those who are endowed with it are excellently qualified for conversation we listen to them with  pleasure because they listen to us in return they understand what is said to them equally as they make themselves understood  Abstraction  is the fruit of study produced by profound application those who are familiar with it talk of common things sometimes with too great refinement simple and natural subjects are in their conversation very difficult to comprehend in the manner they speak of them  Precise  ideas embellish common language and make it in my opinion sublime  Abstracted  ideas are very tiresome they seem to me to be of little use except in the schools or in certain learned debates  We express by  precise  ideas the most simple and most sensible truths but we cannot prove them otherwise than by ideas very  abstracted    Justness Precision  Justness  prevents our running into errors  precision  removes every thing that is useless  The  precision  of discourse is a common mark of the  justness  of the mind    Astronomer Astrologer  The  astronomer  is thoroughly acquainted with the course and motion of the celestial bodies the  astrologer  reasons upon their influence The first observes the state of the heavens marks the order of time the eclipses and revolutions which arise from laws established by the first spring of nature in that immense number of spheres of which the universe consists and hardly ever errs in his calculations The second foretels events casts nativities prognosticates rain cold heat and all the variations of the weather but seldom if ever calculates to any purpose The one explains what he knows and merits the esteem of the learned the  other vends his imaginations and seeks the admiration of the vulgar  We apply ourselves to  astronomy  through a desire of knowledge We dive into  astrology  from disquietude about events to come  The generality of people look upon  astronomy  as a science of mere curiosity and of little utility not reflecting that its object is the arrangement of seasons the regulation of time and the various motions of the heavenly bodies all which is of great service to agriculture to the proper ordering of every thing in civil and political life and is the necessary groundwork of geography and the art of navigation But when on such reflections they come to know that without this science history and chronology would be nothing but confusion perpetually contradicting each other on account of the different manner in which different nations regulate their days and years they would pay that respect to  astronomy  and its professors as their merit deserves  Astrology  is at present much less in vogue than it was  formerly either because men are grown less credulous that the love of truth is more the taste of the learned part of mankind than the desire of dazzling or imposing upon the world or because the brilliancy of reputation does not in this age depend so much upon the number of fools we make as upon the approbation of the discerning and the wise    Attachment Passion Devotion  Although the word  attachment  may sometimes be used with respect to things bad in themselves it is however applied with more propriety when an honest or moderate passion is in question than either  of the two others As for example we are  attached  to our duty to our friends to our families and to virtuous women whom we esteem That of  passion  is more applicable with respect to things less approved or when they are carried to excess thus men are said to have a  passion  for gaming for women c As to the word  devotion  though I have ranked it here as most agreeable to the other two substantives the idea it is supposed to convey is best comprehended by the preterite of the verb  devote  the substantive  devotion  being very rarely used in this sense by it then is understood an implicit obedience or a perfect disposition to conform in every thing Thus we say a man is  devoted  to his prince to his master to his benefactor to a lady who has acquired an absolute empire over him  Attachment  is strong  passion  is violent  devotion  has no reserve  The first unites us to what we love the second to what we thirst after and the third makes us submit to the will of those we are desirous of serving  The manners of the present age have banished from the laws of friendship all  attachment  contrary to interest We dare not confess a  passion  for any thing through fear of censure We often observe that those persons who  devote  themselves to others in expectation of future advantage are frequently disappointed  Life would not be agreeable without some  attachment  A  passion  for any one thing generally gives as much pain as pleasure It is difficult to please the great without  devoting  ourselves entirely to their will    In love Lover  It is sufficient to regard with passionate affection in order to be said with propriety that we are  in love  but we must testify that affection in order to be called a  lover  We become  in love  with a woman whose beauty affects the heart we become her  lover  by waiting on her  Variety of tender sentiments crowd into the breast of a man  in love  Passionate airs appear with caution in the behaviour of a  lover  We are often very much  in love  without daring to appear a  lover  We frequently declare ourselves a  lover  without ever being  in love  It is always the passion that constitutes our being  in love  of which the possession  of the object is the only end we propose Reason and interest may form the  lover  of whom an honest establishment or some particular advantage is the chief aim or tendency  It is very rare to be  in love  with two persons at the same time there is none that I ever heard of except Phillis of Siro who was so much  in love  with two men that she could not give the preference or her company to either one or the other but it is not very rare to find a man at the same time the  lover  of many mistresses which they continue to be frequently to the very hour of marriage We may also be  in love  with one person and the  lover  of another I speak of that case where interest engages us to the one whilst we sigh in secret for her whom it is not convenient for us to marry  Assiduity finds opportunity to favour the designs of a man  in love  Riches give the  lover  a great advantage over his rivals    Absent Inattentive  These two words equally express want of attention but with this difference that it is our own inward ideas occupying us so fully as to prevent our attention to any other thing that offers which renders us  absent  whereas 'tis some fresh outward object attracting our attention in such a manner as to turn it from what we at first gave it to or from what we ought to give it to that makes us  inattentive  When these faults are become habitual they are very inconvenient in our commerce with the world  We are  absent  when we think not of any present object or any thing that is said to us We are  inattentive  when we pay more regard to any other object than to that which is proposed to us or when  we listen to any other conversation than to what is addressed to us  Very studious persons and those who have great affairs upon their hands or are endued with strong passions are more apt to be  absent  than others their internal ideas and designs quite engrossing them Young people are the most apt to be  inattentive  a mere nothing being sufficient to amuse and divert their attention  Our  absence  of mind is owing to thoughtfulness our  inattention  to curiosity  The mind of an  absent  man is never where he himself is nothing round him makes the least impression on him he is often at Athens or Rome in the midst of London or Paris and frequently muses upon politics or geometry while the conversation perhaps runs upon love or gallantry The mind of an  inattentive  man is always present with him is caught by every thing he either sees or hears he quits his attention to one thing in order that he may attend to another listening to all that is said both on the right and  left he frequently understands not thoroughly or comprehends but in part which makes him liable to take things sometimes in a quite opposite sense to what they are meant  The  absent  man cares little for conversation the  inattentive  man loses the fruit of it When we are in company with the former we had best give ourselves up to silent meditation when with the latter we had better wait for their attention till every other object is out of their way  A new passion if strong seldom fails to render us  absent  We can scarce help being  inattentive  when listening to a tiresome story or when we hear on the other side something more interesting  To  Conduct Guide Lead  The two first of these words suppose a superiority of light which the last does not but on the other hand the last carries in its idea a degree of credit and ascendancy entirely foreign to the other two  We  conduct  and  guide  those who know not the way we  lead  those who cannot or care not to go by themselves  In the literal sense it is properly speaking the head that  conducts  the eye that  guides  and the hand that  leads  We  conduct  an affair We  guide  a traveller We  lead  an infant  It requires understanding to  conduct  in business politeness should be our  guide  in all proceedings Taste should  lead  the way in pleasures  We are  conducted  step by step that we may do exactly what is necessary We are  guided  in roads to prevent our losing the way We are  lead  to the knowledge of people in order to procure their acquaintance  Wise men do not  conduct  themselves by the light of others so much as by their own An attentive perusal of the gospel is sufficient to  guide  us in the way of salvation It is great weakness to suffer ourselves to be  lead  in all our actions by the will of another sensible persons will indeed consult a friend in matters of doubt but they make their determinations themselves  To  Fortify Garrison  We  fortify  a town in strengthening it against attacks by walls and works We  garrison  it by placing soldiers in it to defend it  We are said to  fortify  strongly to  garrison  largely  A town without a soldier or any one inhabitant may be  fortified  but cannot be  garrisoned  Some  fortified  places require a greater number of men to  garrison  them than others    Entire Complete  A thing is  entire  when it is neither mutilated broken or divided but when all its parts are together as they ought to be It is  complete  when it wants nothing but has every thing that is necessary  The first of these words relates more to that totality of parts which constitutes the whole of a thing the second more to that totality which contributes to its accidental perfection  Small families in the country occupy  entire  houses but in London they have scarcely  complete  apartments    Disgraceful Scandalous  Both these words express the effect of those actions that hurt the reputation of those who commit them with this difference that a  disgraceful  action is an obstacle to glory loses us the esteem and draws on us the contempt of the honest whereas a  scandalous  action is a shameful blot in our life destroys our honour and draws on us the hatred of the just  He who has the folly or the misfortune to do any thing  disgraceful  should be very careful not to give himself any unbecoming airs When we have been guilty of any thing  scandalous  the best thing we can do is to hide ourselves entirely from the eyes of the world  Nothing is more  disgraceful  to men than meanness of spirit nor any thing more so to women than gallantry carried to excess Nothing is more  scandalous  to all sorts of people than to be punished according to the sentence of public justice    Reserved Modest  The advantage of these two qualities is confined to the person who possesses them they contribute to his perfection and are nothing to others but an object of speculation which merits their approbation but is sometimes injurious to their satisfaction  We are  reserved  in our words and actions Taking too great a liberty is the fault in opposition when that liberty is carried to excess and we are in no respect  reserved  it becomes impudence We are  modest  in our desires in our gestures and in our dress There are three kinds of  modesty  those of the heart the mind and the body but their opposite vices are not all expressed by the word immodesty which denotes only that which regards the body proceeding from the indecency of gestures and cloaths That vanity which we assume in giving ourselves bold and unbecoming airs is the vice in opposition to  modesty  of mind that which is contrary to  modesty  of heart is immoderate ambition which makes us covet all that comes in our way and all that we can possibly attain  Reservedness  is good at all times but it is absolutely necessary in public and in company with our superiors any liberty they may seem to wink at giving some degree of offence for they reserve to themselves a certain title to respect the  failure of which they consider as an unpardonable fault  Modesty  is an ornament to persons who have some pretence for carrying their head higher than others and to those who are possessed of some known and distinguished merit but to all other persons it is an indispensable virtue and a quality without which they cannot appear becoming or avoid ridicule    Ashamed Bashful  It is the reproach of conscience that makes us  ashamed  but the sentiments of modesty that make us  bashful  Both one and the other throw a colour into the face but when we are  ashamed  we redden when  bashful  we blush  We need never boast or be  ashamed  of our birth which is a mark only of pride but it is praiseworthy in all ranks of people both high and low to be  ashamed  of their faults Although  bashfulness  is a virtue there are nevertheless occasions when it would pass for weakness and timidity  To  Finish Cease Leave off  We  finish  by putting the last hand to a work We  cease  in quitting it entirely We  leave off  in discontinuing  To  finish  a discourse properly we should do it just before it begins to grow tiresome We ought to  cease  from our pursuits as soon as we discover them to be useless We should not  leave off  work but to refresh ourselves that we may begin again with fresh spirits and more vigour  Man is born to trouble he has no sooner  finished  one affair than another succeeds he may indeed seek repose and tranquillity but Providence will not permit him in this life to  cease  from labour and if want of spirits or fatigue induces him sometimes to  leave off  his work it is not for any length of time he is presently  obliged to return to his task and continue his employ  That is certainly a good maxim which says we should not begin a thing which we cannot  finish  but that in my opinion is much better which forbids our  ceasing  from one work in order to begin another without necessity obliges us When our mind is employed it is necessary sometimes to  leave off  not at that time when the imagination full of fire finds itself best capable of its task but only at the first instant we perceive it flag it being wrong either to stop it in its career or attempt to drive it when it stops  Persons who never  finish  their stories  cease  talking or  leave off  are as little fit for conversation as those who never speak a word  To  Invent Find out  We  invent  new things by the force of imagination We  find out  things that are hidden or unknown by examination and study The one denotes the fruitfulness of the mind the other the penetration  It is the principle of mechanics to  invent  tools and machines of physics to  find out  causes and effects  The ventilator was  invented  by Dr Hales Harvey  found out  the circulation of the blood    Joy Gaiety  Joy  is in the heart  gaiety  in the manners The one consists in the sweet sentiments of the soul the other in the agreeable situation of the mind  It sometimes happens that the possession of a good from which we expected a great deal of  joy  gives us a great deal of uneasiness It is often owing to a turn of imagination only that the bitterest tears are succeeded by the greatest  gaiety    Project Design  A  project  is a plan or an arrangement of means in order to execute a  design  The  design  is what we propose to execute  We commonly say of  projects  that they are fine of  designs  that they are great  The beauty of  projects  depends upon their order and magnificence The grandeur of  designs  rises from the advantage and glory they may procure We should not suffer ourselves to be dazzled with the beauty of the one or the grandeur of the other for practice does not often agree with speculation the admirable order of a system and the advantageous idea which we form from it do not always prevent  projects  from running aground or put  designs  out of the possibility of failing  The experience of all ages teaches us that heads fruitful in great  designs  and excellent  projects  are frequently chimerical  The word  project  is taken also for the thing we even propose to execute as well as that of  design  But though these words considered in that sense are more nearly synonymous we shall nevertheless find a difference very conspicuous to those who have any delicacy of taste The following is such as I am able to discover  It appears to me that  project  relates to something more distant  design  to something more near We make  projects  for the time to come we form  designs  for the time present The first is more vague the other more determined  The  project  of an avaritious man is to enrich himself his  design  is to amass money  A good minister of state has no other  project  than the glory of his prince and the happiness of the subject A good general studies as much to conceal his own  designs  as discover those of his enemy  The union of all the states of Europe into one single republic for general government and the discussion of their particular interests without changing the interiour government peculiar to each of them was a noble  project  of Henry the IVth of France but perhaps more difficult to execute than the  design  of universal monarchy in which Spain was at that time busied  To  Oblige Engage  To  oblige  implies rather something of force to  engage  rather something agreeable Duty and necessity  oblige  us promises and good manners  engage  us  Convenience often  obliges  those who are abroad in the world to do things they very much dislike complaisance  engages  those who are not very choice in their company sometimes to enter upon bad actions    Also Likewise  Also  relates more to number and quantity its proper office is to add and to augment  Love is not only liberal but  also  prodigal  Likewise  is used with most propriety when it relates to similitude or comparison its particular office is to denote the conformity and equality of things  When the body is sick the mind is so  likewise  Politeness is not only to be met with in London but  likewise  in country places    Upright Up  We are  upright  when we are neither crooked or stooping We are  up  when upon our feet  A graceful air requires us to be  upright  Respect makes us sometimes hold ourselves  up    Flags Colours  By the word  flags  we understand ensigns hoisted upon the top of towers castles or churches The word  colours  implies the jack ensign and pendant of a ship or the standard of a regiment  The arms of England are generally painted upon  flags  the union upon  colours  The first for the most part is used in the singular number the second never We say  the flag  of a fort the  colours  of a regiment English  flags  except those on which the arms of the country are painted are commonly of one colour such as white blue c But  colours  are of many  Flags  are hung out on days of public rejoicing and frequently hoisted as signals Great respect is usually paid to the  colours  of a regiment as military honour seems there to be chiefly centred    Trench Ditch  A  trench  is either a channel made in lands by digging out the earth in order to carry off the water or earth thrown up in order to defend soldiers in their approach to a town or to guard a camp  Ditch  is a  trench  cut in the ground between two fields in order to seperate them  The earth dug from  trenches  that serve as drains is generally spread so as to leave no heap The earth dug from  ditches  is usually thrown up into a bank on one side  Trenches  are commonly regular  Ditches  are often irregular  The largeness of a  ditch  is determined by the wideness of the  trench    Fine Delicate  To conceive things that are  fine  we need only sufficient comprehension but it requires taste to conceive that which is  delicate  The first is within the reach of many persons the second but of few  A  fine  discourse is sometimes usefully repeated to those who do not at first comprehend it but he who perceives not the  delicate  at first glance will never perceive it We may seek the one but must catch the other  The word  fine  is of more extensive use we apply it equally with respect to the strokes of illwill as to those of good The application of the word  delicate  is more rare it agrees not with any thing malicious but is used with most propriety with respect to things in themselves flattering Thus we say a  fine  satire a  delicate  encomium    Steadiness Constancy Resolution  Steadiness  prevents our varying and supports the heart against levity and curiosity which diversity of objects may produce it rises from preference and justifies choice  Constancy  prevents our changing and furnishes the heart with resources against being disgusted or tired with the same object it results from perseverance and gives a lustre to attachment  Resolution  prevents our giving way and endues the heart with strength to resist the attacks it meets with it springs from resistance and throws a brightness upon victory  Rakes pride themselves more in being fickle than in the  steadiness  of their engagements If the affections of the ladies do not last for ever it is less owing to a  want of  constancy  to the persons they love than to a want of  resolution  in the object of their affections  To  Conceal Dissemble Disguise  We  conceal  by a profound secret that which we would not have known We  dissemble  by reserve that which we would not have appear We  disguise  by contrary appearances that which we would not lay open to the penetration of others  It requires care and attention to  conceal  art and cleverness to  dissemble  labour and cunning to  disguise  He who would  conceal  throws as it were a veil over himself that he may not betray himself through indiscretion He who would  dissemble  throws a veil over the eyes of others that what he does or says  may not fall within the reach of their knowledge He who would  disguise  never opens himself any otherwise than to elude  Were we to enter into affairs of interest or policy we should always  conceal  our designs often  dissemble  and sometimes  disguise  them with respect to matters which concern the heart we should be more frank  It is sufficient to  conceal  from those who cannot see without some additional light we must  dissemble  with those who can see without any such accessary brightness but it is necessary to  disguise  thoroughly from those who not content to piece through the darkness that opposes examine into that light with which we would dazzle them  When we have not resolution to correct our faults we should at least have wisdom to  conceal  them That maxim of Louis the XIth of France which says in order to know how to reign we should know how to  dissemble  is very just even with respect to domestic government When the necessity of circumstances and  the nature of affairs require us to  disguise  it is political but when urged to it thro' an inclination to cheat or shuffle it is knavish  To  Adjust Reconcile  To  adjust  supposes some dispute or disagreement To  reconcile  supposes only some distance or difference  We  adjust  matters we  reconcile  minds  It seems impossible to  adjust  the liberties of the Gallic church with the pretensions of the court of Rome sooner or later one must necessarily destroy the other for it will always be difficult to  reconcile  the maxims of their parliaments with the opinions of the consistory  We use the word  adjust  with respect to opinions which oppose one another and  that of  reconcile  with respect to passages that seem to contradict each other  Want of justness in the mind is what commonly prevents schoolmen from  adjusting  their disputes A precise knowledge of the value of every word in all the different circumstances wherein they may be used would go a great way towards  reconciling  authors  To  Bring Fetch  To  bring  implies conveying a thing ourselves from one place to another in opposition to the verb send To  fetch  implies going to a place in order to  bring  He who  fetches  a thing is always supposed to  bring  it but he who  brings  it is not always supposed to  fetch  it Thus we cannot  fetch  without  bringing  but we may  bring  without  fetching  If we send for a workman in any branch of business in order to make or repair he naturally  brings  his tools with him should he leave any behind through forgetfulness he is obliged to go back and  fetch  them  To  Swallow Gulp  In the literal sense these words are more nearly synonymous than in the figurative yet even in that they will admit of some distinction We  gulp  in order to  swallow  This however is not the only difference By  swallowing  we understand taking down the throat simply by  gulping  we mean sucking down eagerly or without intermission  With respect to eating  swallowing  carries in its idea the act of chewing  gulping  does not  The glutton will  gulp  down a greater quantity of food in five minutes than a moderate eater would  swallow  in half an hour  In the figurative sense  gulping  rather implies a difficulty of  swallowing  We are all too apt to  swallow  flattery and as fulsome as it may possibly be there are some vain persons that will make a shift to  gulp  it down    Detraction Defamation  Injuring the reputation is the general idea of these two words but that of  detraction  implies the taking off from a man's good name  defamation  the giving him a bad one Were we to be silent when asked the character of a worthy man  it would be  detraction  Were we to vilify him by declaring him guilty of infamous practices it would be  defamation  Defamation  is punishable by human laws  detraction  is not  The one is an open and scurrilous way of injuring the reputation the other a close and demure one  There are those accustomed to  detraction  who would fly the thoughts of  defamation  little imagining that both are equally bad being two different means only working to the same end    Meager Lean  In that sense in which these two words are reputed synonymous  meager  signifies want of flesh  lean  want of fat  Meagerness  supposes a waste of body owing either to a bad constitution or a scarcity of food  Leanness  supposes no want of flesh being opposed only to corpulency or fatness  A man may be  lean  yet not  meager  The  lean  are usually strong the  meager  commonly weak  The first is generally a mark of beggary the second frequently denotes the person accustomed to labour  Activity attends the  lean  Indolence the  meager  Many persons if possible would choose to be  lean  but none would care to be  meager    Sailor Seaman Mariner  These words denote persons who live by the sea or practise navigation but  sailor  in my opinion is used with most propriety with respect to the common men or in the sea phrase those before the mast  Seaman  agrees best with regard to the superior class of the ship's company such as the officers boatswain gunner c  Mariner  relates more to chose who gain their livelihood at sea but who are generally their own masters as fishermen  Sailors  are ignorant of navigation and are they who work the vessel by the direction of others  seamen  are supposed to understand it and are they who generally direct it  mariners  are supposed to have  no greater knowledge of the art than such as is sufficient to serve their purpose working their vessels themselves  Both  sailors  and  seamen  take long voyages whereas  mariners  do little else than coast  We say an able  sailor  an expert  seaman  a bold  mariner  The great hardships the poor  sailors  undergo one would imagine should be sufficient to endear them to their country It is not every captain of a ship that is a good  seaman Mariners  earn their bread very hard they not only being obliged to work more than other men but are in daily danger of their lives    Grot Grotto  Though these words are evidently one and the same  grot  being no more than an abbreviation of  grotto  yet custom has made them expressive of different ideas  Grot  then seems to denote something more natural  grotto  something more  artificial  The first is in effect the work of nature the second the work of art  The one implies a cool cave appropriated to pleasure stony rough irregular and overgrown with moss the oother a pleasurable cave or room ornamented with shellwork  We say a pretty  grot  a beautiful  grotto  It is as much out of the power of the most ingenious artist to make a  grotto  any thing equal to a  grot  as it is for art to rival nature    Cave Cell  The sense in which these words are esteemed synonymous is that of the retired dwelling of some religious person  Cave  is a habitation under ground made either by art or nature  Cell  is some little dwelling raised above ground  We dig a  cave  We build a  cell  Hermits or such persons as chuse to seclude themselves from the world bury themselves in  caves  they may chance to meet with or wear out their lives in  cells  remote from public view    Broad Wide  By  broad  is understood extended each way as  broad  cloth a  broad  brimmed hat By  wide  is meant  broad  to a certain degree as three inches  wide  four feet  wide  Broad  seems to be confined to things of less extent  wide  to those of greater Thus we say a  broad  bean a  broad  face a  broad  back a  broad  apron a  broad  tablecloth but a  wide  room a  wide  ditch a  wide  field the  wide  ocean    School Academy  School  implies a place of discipline and instruction  academy  a place where the sciences are taught  School  seems appropriated to the teaching of children  academy  to that of youth  In  schools  are taught languages writing music dancing c in  academies  natural and experimental philosophy geography geometry astronomy ethics rhetoric c  Schools  begin the education  academies  finish it  Children who learn to read with a tone at  school  seldom get the better of it even when they are grown up  Academies  are the nurseries of learned men    Blessing Benediction  Benediction  appears to me to be limited to the decretory pronounciation of happiness  Blessing  is a more general expression intimating the various means of happiness  Religious men find as much comfort in the  benediction  of the church as others experience in the  blessings  of life  Blessing  seems to intimate divine favour  benediction  that which is human  We say the  blessing  of God the  benediction  of the priest  Heaven showers down its  blessings  upon the virtuous The  benediction  of a good man is a very desirable thing    Ambassador Resident  The general idea of these words is that of a minister representing the person of his sovereign sent from one court to another but  ambassador  seems to be superior to that of  resident  The first are generally men of greater rank the second of less  Ambassadors  are not supposed to stay long at the court to which they are sent their office being to transact some state affairs between the two powers  Residents  are supposed to reside for some considerable time as a testimony of the good harmony between the two states  The Earl of Northampton was sent from London  ambassador  to Venice in the year during the time that Mr Murray was there as  resident    Dregs Sediment  Dregs  are gross a  sediment  is fine  After the  dregs  are taken away there will frequently remain a  sediment  We say the  dregs  of wine the  dregs  of melted tallow but the  sediment  of water the  sediment  of urine    Lofty High  Lofty  seems to carry with it an idea of magnificence which  high  does not Thus we say a  lofty  room the  lofty  cedar but a  high  house a  high  tree  With respect to other things 'tis the same Thus it is in the power only of a severe fit of sickness or a heavy stroke of adversity to lower the  high  looks of the great and the  lofty  imaginations of the proud    Betwixt Between  If any two words in the English language may be said to carry the same meaning these in some respect may As a studied delicacy here is not immediately essential custom has made no other distinction than that of using the word  between  on every occasion as being softer on the tongue and almost banishing the use of the word  betwixt  as being much harsher but as I deviate from the common opion and think there is no word so trivial but the choice of it on particular occasions may be necessary I hope I may not be condemned as too nice with respect to the word before us  Betwixt  then appears to me to be used with most propriety when that which is  in the middle is as it were embraced by the other two  between  when that which is in the middle is at some distance from the other two Thus to speak properly with respect to a house standing in a row we should use the word  betwixt  as for example the house I dwell in stands  betwixt  two high houses but with respect to a tree standing in a line with others we should use the word  between  as for instance the oak tree I mentioned stands  between  two elms    Middle Midst  A thing is in the  middle  when it stands at an equal distance from the two extremes it is in the  midst  when it stands in the center of a great many  Thus we say in the  middle  of a pond in the  midst  of a crowd  There cannot be a more tormenting situation than to hang in the  middle  between hope and fear Providence sometimes has taken a man out from the  midst  of misfortunes when he has seen no visible way of escaping    Marshy Boggy  Marshy  lands are those that lie low and are watry  boggy  lands are those where there are many quagmires  In walking over the first we sink not deeper than our ankles In passing over the second we may entirely be lost  Marshy  lands frequently produce fine meadows  boggy  lands are wholly useless    Rough Rugged  Roughness  is a small degree of  ruggedness ruggedness  a great degree of  roughness  Smooth is the reverse of  rough  level the reverse of  rugged  We say a  rough  hand a  rugged  road    Ray Beam  A  beam  seems to me to be more powerful than a  ray  casting a greater degree of light and heat  We say  rays  of light  beams  of the sun by the first of which expressions we mean that those are  rays  which shine early in the morning by the second that those are  beams  which gleam at noon  We frequently apply the epithet chearful to the word  ray  that of scorching to the word  beam  The  rays  of the sun being separated by a prism is the original of colours The  beams  of the fun collected into one point by means of a convex lens will set fire to any thing they touch    Clergyman Parson  There are three ranks of  clergymen  below that of a dignitary viz  parson  vicar and curate  Parson  is the first meaning a rector or he who receives the great tythes of a benefice By the word  parson  then is implied one of a particular class of clergy whereas by the word  clergyman  is understood any person ordained to serve at the altar  Parsons  are always priests many  clergymen  are only deacons  Every bishop dean c is a  clergyman  tho' not always a  parson  As the general and indiscriminate use of these two words has rendered it necessary I have pointed out the distinction that should be made between them but am of of opinion as custom has thrown into the word  parson  an idea of contempt it would be better not to use it at all but when we have occasion to point out one of that class of  clergymen  who enjoy the great tythes of a living to substitute in its room that of rector    Suffocated Smothered Choaked  Death brought on by a stoppage of breath is the general idea of these three words but that of  suffocated  implies an extinction of life occasioned by being in a place where we cannot breathe that of  smothered  by being in a place where we are not suffered to breathe that of  choaked  by having the windpipe closed  Thus men are frequently  suffocated  by smoke Persons raving mad when in curable are sometimes  smothered  between two feather beds Malefactors when hanged are  choaked  It has happened that travellers by falling into bogs have been sometimes  suffocated  before assistance could be had Children are frequently  smothered  in bed thro' the carelesness of nurses Persons are often  choaked  by eating too greedily  The words  smother  and  choak  are often used in a figurative sense the word  suffocate  never  We  smother  a flame We  choak  a passage  It is an act of charity to  smother  the failings of another When interest is predominant it is sure to  choak  up all the avenues to the heart which would otherwise be open to the cries of distress    Cloakbag Portmanteau Trunk  These are machines for carrying cloaths on a journey  Cloakbags  are made of leather contrived to be laid upon the back of a horse  portmanteaus  and  trunks  are of wood generally covered with hair and made to be carried before or behind a carriage with this difference between them that  portmanteaus  are long and their lids round whereas  trunks  are made square every way    Rule Order  Rule  respects properly those things that ought to be done  order  the manner in which they should be done In the idea of the first there seems to be something arising more from natural right in the idea of the second something resulting more from positive right  Equity and charity ought to be the two grand  rules  of our conduct they may even deviate from all kind of  order  We submit to  rule  We conform to  order  Although the first is much more indispensable it is yet much more broke through the particularity of  order  making a greater impression on us than the advantage of  rule    Regular Methodical  We are  regular  in our conduct We are  methodical  with respect to our affairs  A  regular  man is careful of his reputation he runs into no excess A  methodical  man takes care of his time he gives no way to dissipation  With respect to expences we are  regular  in relation to the bounds we set to them  methodical  with regard to the manner of them  Regular  persons are always admired  methodical  persons are frequently laughed at  To be  sorry for Regret  We are  sorry for  the misfortunes of another we  regret  his absence The one is the effect of pity the other of attachment  Grief occasions our  sorrow  repentance excites our  regret  A court favourite in prosperity is the object of envy but when he falls into disgrace no one is  sorry for  him Those princes who are most commended during their life are not always most  regretted  after their death  The expression  sorry for  when used with respect to ourselves in some measure changes its signification Retaining the common and general idea of sensibility it  ceases to express that particular motive of pity that makes us sympathise inwardly for the distresses of others and in its room marks only a certain uneasiness which discovers itself outwardly When we are  sorry for  the misfortunes of others we are often inwardly touched and perhaps no outward sign of it shall appear when we are  sorry for  our own we shew it outwardly in order to draw the compassion of others This expression is sometimes used in another sense besides that mentioned instead of motives of pity it denotes motives of repentance In this sense we say he is  sorry for  the steps he has taken  As much taken up as we may be with ourselves there are eertain moments when we are  sorry for  the distresses of others However philosophical we may pretend to be it is extremely difficult to suffer a long time together without shewing some signs of sorrow Mercenary people are  sorry for  every step they take that does not turn out to advantage We often  seem to  regret  the absent in order to affront the person present  A hard heart is  sorry for  no one An insensible man is never  sorry for  any thing that happens to him A miserly person  regrets  every morsel he eats  We should never be  sorry for  a man who suffers deservedly for ourselves when we can procure no kind of comfort nor for any trouble we take when prudence enjoins it we should not  regret  the departure of a friend when his absence will turn out to his advantage    Rivulet Brook Stream  Rivulets  and  brooks  are certain species of  streams  which are running waters with this difference that a  rivulet  runs between banks whereas a  brook  winds its way through the meadows or by a hedge side  A  rivulet  is a much larger  stream  than a  brook  Fish are found in  rivulets  but never in what we properly call  brooks  there not being sufficient depth of water  We say the rapid  stream  the clear  rivulet  the gurgling  brook  Heavy rains will swell a  stream  in such a manner as to overflow the neighbouring grounds Poets are very luxurious in their description of  rivulets  and  brooks    Stream Current  A  stream  issues from a head and moves forward with a continuity of parts A  current  is a certain progressive motion of some fluid body These words in the literal sense are applied to water Thus we say the  stream  of a river the  current  of a sea  Streams  are frequently rapid  currents  are seldom so  In the figurative sense these words convey the same ideas Thus we say a  stream  of light a  current  of air  To  Swear Make eath of  Custom has made the word  swear  to signify the profane and illegal use of the sacred name in common conversation whereas by the phrase  make oath of  is understood the divine name used solemnly on legal occasions in confirmation of the truth  In courts of judicature we are required to  make oath of  every thing we have to say He who  swears  upon every occasion gives us to understand that his bare word is not to be credited    Pleasing Agreeable  It is the air and behaviour that renders  pleasing  good sense and good humour that renders  agreeable  We love the company of a  pleasing  man because he charms We covet the company of an  agreeable  man because he diverts  Wellbred persons are always  pleasing  Merry persons are commonly  agreeable  How difficult is it to avoid being attached to one of a  pleasing  address and  agreeable  coversation  It appears to me that it is more the behaviour than the air that makes the men  pleasing  and that it is rather the air than the behaviour that makes the women so It seems to me also that it is rather good sense and a liveliness in  conversation that constitutes  agreeableness  in the men and that it is an even temper and a merry disposition that establishes that quality in the women  When these words are used otherwise than to denote personal qualities that of  pleasing  properly speaking implies something which flatters the sense or selflove that of  agreeable  something which agrees with the taste and the mind  It is  pleasing  to have always desireable objects before us Nothing is more  agreeable  to a joyous man than good company  It is sometimes dangerous to approach that which is  pleasing  to the sight and it may happen that what is very  agreeable  may be very prejudicial    Graces Charms  Graces  result from natural politeness accompanied with a noble freedom it is a varnish that appears in our conversation our actions and our carriage making us please in every thing we do  Charms  rise from an assemblage of fine touches animated by goodhumour and goodsense and are sometimes far superior to what is perfectly agreeable  The body seems to be more susceptible of  graces  the mind of  charms  We say of a lady that she walks dances and sings with  grace  and that her conversation is full of  charms  What can a man desire more in a lady than an outward union of  graces  and  charms  and an inward composition of solidity in her disposition and delicacy in her sentiments    Ready Easy  Both the one and the other of these words denote that which is done without difficulty but the first excludes difficulty which arises from obstacles and oppositions the second that which springs from the very nature of the thing Thus we say a  ready  entrance when no one stops the passage an  easy  entrance when the passage is large and commodious For the same reason we say of a woman without reserve that she is  ready  of access  and of a shoe that does not pinch that it is  easy  It appears to me best to use the word  ready  in naming the action and that of  easy  in expressing the event of that action Thus speaking of a commodious harbour I should say we have there a  ready  landing and that it is  easy  to land there  Of these two adjectives there are formed two adverbs  easily  and  readily  Which besides the difference of ideas remarked in their originals have one peculiar to themselves which I should not here omit taking notice of In speaking then of a sensible person I should rather say he comprehends  easily  and pardons  readily  than that he comprehends  readily  and pardons  easily  This choice of words I must confess is delicate but as I can perceive the necessity of it why should not another do the same    Flat Insipid  That which is  flat  does not pierce the taste that which is  insipid  does not touch it in the least Thus the last rises upon the first the one wanting only a degree of seasoning the other wanting it entirely  In works of the mind they are both very far from pleasant but the  flat  appearing to affect the graces displeases the  insipid  appearing to have no knowledge tires  In relation to the beauty of the sex I do not think the word  insipid  should be used but with respect to those who are of a disposition wholly insensible but we say beauty is  flat  when it is not animated and  when it has neither the charms of vivacity nor those of softness  To  Keep Detain  We  keep  what we intend not to part with We  detain  what we propose not to restore  We  keep  that which is our own We  detain  that which is another's  The miser  keeps  his money The debtor  detains  the property of his creditors  The honest man finds a difficulty in  keeping  what he possesses when the rogue finds none in  detaining  what he has taken    Complicated Involved  Affairs or actions are  complicated  one with another by their mixture and mutual dependance Persons are  involved  in actions or in affairs when they are far immerged in them  Things extremely  complicated  become obscure to those who have not sufficient understanding or discernment to unfold them If we are often in company with rash people we are liable to be  involved  in disagreeable matters  The most  complicated  affairs become simple and easy to be understood in the mouth or in the writings of an able advocate It is dangerous to be  involved  even innocently in the crimes of the great as at those time we are always the  dupe and are sure to be sacrificed to their interests  Complicated  has a substantive in general use  involved  has not but in return that has a verb in general use which the other has not We hear frequently of  complication  seldom of  involution  so again we meet frequently with the verb to  involve  seldom with that of to  complicate  Nothing embarrasses physicians more than a  complication  of disorders of which the remedy of one shall oppose the cure of another It is very disagreeable to have such acquaintance as  involve  us always in their own faults    For As to  However synonymous these may be  for  seems to me to agree best when speaking of a person or thing which governs the following verb  As to  appears to me to be used with most propriety when speaking of that which is governed by the verb I should say then  for  my part I will not interfere in such matters as do not concern me  as to  me all things are indifferent  The religion of the understanding part of mankind consists in a lively faith a pure morality and in a simple conduct guided by divine authority and supported by reason  For  that of the people in general it consists in a blind credulity and in exterior practices authorised by education and corroborated by the force  of custom  As to  that of those belonging to the church we can determine nothing concerning it unless we could detach them from their temporal interests    Trade Business Profession  In the sense in which these words are esteemed synonymous that of  trade  implies a manual occupation that of  business  such an occupation as consists only in buying and selling that of  profession  such as results from the lucrative use of the sciences Thus the occupations of a carpenter taylor baker c are  trades  those of a linnendraper mercer haberdasher c are  businesses  those of a physician counsellor musician c are  professions  In point of rank  professions  take place of  businesses businesses  of  trades    Divination Prediction  Divination  brings hidden things to light  prediction  fortells what will come to pass  The first regards things present and past The objects of the second are things to come  A learned and discerning man one who knows what relation the least outward signs bear to the motions of the soul readily passes with the world as wellskilled in  divination  A wise man one who sees what will be the consequences of certain principles and the effects of certain causes may pass with the people as having the knowledge of  prediction  To  Reprove Reprimand  He who  reproves  another points out his fault and blames him He who  reprimands  pretends to punish and mortifies the offender  We  reprove  a friend We  reprimand  a child  Reprove  is seldom used but with respect to the faults of the mind  reprimand  with regard to the manners and conduct  We sometimes  reprove  one who knows better than ourselves No one has a right to  reprimand  but superiors    Austere Severe  We are  austere  by our manner of living  severe  by our manner of thinking  Softness is the reverse of  austerity  it is rare to pass immediately from one to the other a common regular way of life is the medium between the two Remissness and  severity  are the two extremes in one of which we are sure to fall few persons being able to distinguish the true medium which consists in an exact and precise knowledge of the law  We are  austere  only with respect to ourselves but we may be  severe  as well with respect to others as ourselves  Enthusiasts give themselves up to the exercises of  austerity  this was also once the custom of recluses Some casuists affect to distinguish themselves by a  severe  morality extending it even 'till it loses sight of every degree of reason  An  austere  life consists in the privation of pleasures and conveniences we sometimes embrace it through a taste of singularity and would fain have it thought to proceed from a principle of religion Morals too  severe  may equally with morals too remiss wound the regularity of manners    Tempest Storm  By  tempest  is understood the utmost violence of the wind by  storm  a commotion of the elements  Tempests  are more dreadful at sea than  storms  We use the word  storm  to denote any violence of weather but then in order to determine what weather we mean  we are under a necessity of adding such other words to it as shall express the idea we want to convey Thus we say a  storm  of wind a  storm  of hail c but the word  tempest  is understood to be neither more or less than as was said before the utmost violence of the wind should this excess of wind be atttended with rain thunder and lightning it then becomes a  storm  We may say with propriety a great  storm  but a great  tempest  would be absurd  Words cannot describe the distresses of seamen when out in  tempestuous  weather  Stormy  weather is generally succeeded by serene  To  Appear Seem  I know not how much I may differ from the rest of my countrymen but the verb  appear  in my opinion relates more to the eye  seem  more to the imagination  An object always  appears  less the farther it is off Many things  seem  practicable which cannot be carried into execution    Fast Hard  The sense in which these words are accounted synonymous is that of quick motion but  fast  denotes quickness without force  hard  quickness with violence Thus to run ride or rain  fast  implies a quicker motion than common but to run ride or rain  hard  some degree of force or violence  With respect to work  fast  means expeditiously  hard  laboriously Thus he who works  fast  will soon have done He who works  hard  will soon be weary    Clock Dial  These are both timepieces with this difference that the  clock  strikes the  dial  does not 'Tis for this reason we call that plate which determines time by a shadow in the sun a sun  dial  The  clock  tells the hour the  dial  shews it  Dials  were long in use before the invention of  clocks    Every All  Though the word  every  is more frequently made use of by itself it is sometimes connected with the word ONE especially when used as synonymous to  all  As  all  of us  every one  of us These expressions shew that  every  is rather particular relating more to individuals and that  all  is rather general relating to the whole the word ONE being added to  every  specifying that determination  Every  includes always in its idea the word  all  though  all  does not always include the word  every  that is  all  speaks in general only whereas  every  excepts none  Every  man is undoubtedly bound to assist his neighbour  All  men are mercenary  All  seems to me to be the plural of  every every  being constantly applied to the singular number  all  to the plural Thus we say  every  man  every  thing  every  part c but  all  men  all  things  all  parts c    Pity Compassion Commiseration  I cannot say whether in the characterising of these words I may fall in with the opinion of the public but with respect to the two first  pity  seems to me to be rather particular and to be used with most propriety with regard to persons we have some knowledge of whereas  compassion  is more general and may be used equally with respect to those we know as to those we know not  We are said to  pity  the distresses of a friend and  compassionate  the misfortunes of a stranger  Pity  seems most applicable to the first emotions we feel at the sight or description of an object in distress rising from tenderness of heart  Compassion  seems to  result from reflection on the unmerited calamities of another springing from the truest benevolence  Thus we say it was through  pity  we were led to  compassionate  his case  Commiseration  in my opinion implies a fellowfeeling or the bearing a part in another's woe and rises from sympathy  We naturally  commiserate  the sorrows of one we love  According to this interpretation of the words we may  pity  and yet not have  compassion  we may have both  pity  and  compassion  yet not  commiserate  The word  pity  on some occasions has been made use of by way of contempt as I  pity  her pride but it seems hare to be used rather ironically than to imply in its real signification any degree of scorn    Slippery Glib  Glibness  implies a great degree of  slipperiness slipperiness  a small degree of  glibness  All ice is  slippery  but that which is remarkably smooth is  glib  The proper and literal definition of  slippery  is affording no firm hold or footing that of  glib  made easy to be moved In this sense the first denotes something natural the last something not so  An eel is so  slippery  as to be difficult to hold Wet weather succeeded by a frost makes the ways  slippery  Oiling the fly of a jack makes it run  glib  So in the figurative sense speaking of a woman fond of gallantry we say she is a  slippery  dame Nothing is of a more  slippery  nature than true happiness it slides  through the fingers even while we think we hold it fast Strong liquor on different persons has different effects some it sickens others it stupifies of others again it makes the tongue run so  glib  as to be greatly entertaining    Ridicule Derision  Laughter in scorn is the common import of these words but that of  ridicule  implies contemptuous merriment that of  derision  sportive insult  We  ridicule  in order to shew another his fault and induce him to amend We never  deride  but with the utmost contempt  A friend will often  ridicule  none but an enemy  derides  If we have done any thing deserving  ridicule  we should endeavour to retrieve our character lest we become the  derision  of all who know us  To  Cry Weep  Shedding of tears is the general sense in which these words are understood but to  cry  implies shedding of tears audibly to  weep  shedding of tears with silence  Children commonly  cry  grown persons generally  weep  'Tis not the noise we make that denotes a greater or less measure of grief for the secret  weeper  may be more distressed than one who  crys  aloud  Crying  is found by experience to give greater relief to sorrow than bare  weeping  To  Shake Tremble  Both these words imply being agitated with a vibratory motion but as this motion seems to arise from different causes it renders the choice of them necessary  Shake  appears to me more applicable to a tremulous motion occasioned by cold  tremble  to a like motion occasioned by fear  We  shake  with cold we  tremble  with fear  When the blood is chilled we naturally  shake  The very thought of danger will make the coward  tremble  The verb  shake  is often used in the active sense the verb  tremble  never Thus we  shake  the house  shake  a tree  shake  hands c    Pedigree Genealogy  Pedigree  is our lineal descent from some ancestor ages back pointed out  genealogy  is a history of such  pedigree  We trace our  pedigree  We write our  genealogy  It is sometimes necessary to examine into our  pedigree  in order to claim or secure our property in lands The transmitting of  genealogies  to posterity though they may be in some respect useful is a standing mark of the vanity of our ancestors    Prebend Prebendary  Prebend  implies a certain stipend granted to the clergy in cathedral churches  prebendary  denotes properly the person who receives that stipend Though it is well known to every one that one of these words implies the stipend the other the stipendiary yet I thought fit to take notice of them especially as it gave me an opportunity of correcting their erroneous use it being common to employ the word  prebendary  to express the benefice and that of  prebend  to denote the dignitary whereas they should be reversed  i e Prebend  should be used to mark the office  prebendary  to point out the person filling that office    Discourse Conversation  The general import of these words is the mutual intercourse of speech but that of  discourse  implies serious or set talk upon any particular subject that of  conversation  such as is easy and familiar and not confined to any particular topic  Discourse  is generally formal  conversation  commonly chearful  The attention of men is so much scattered by dissipation that when together exclusive of business they seldom enter into any  discourse  that is improving but their general  conversation  runs on things in their nature trifling and impertinent    Impertinent Impudent Saucy  Nothing is more general than the indiscriminate use of these words though none differ more among themselves if a man gives rude language how common is it to say he is an  impertinent impudent  or  saucy  fellow One would imagine their peculiar ideas are so well known as to render it unnecessary to take farther notice of them but as some people never see the stumbling block till they fall over it it may not be unnecessary to give them a perfect view of it in order to which I need only define them  Impertinent  then means intruding and meddling with what no way concerns us  Impudent  implies shamelessness or want of modesty  Saucy  means insolent and abusive  To shew a further difference between them or give any examples of their use would be needless    Tongue Language  I know not whether in characterising these words I may fall in with the taste of the public but according to my opinion  tongue  seems to agree best with a corrupted  language  that is  tongue  appears to be more particular or provincial  language  more general or national Thus I would say the vulgar  tongue  the mother  tongue  the Yorkshire  tongue  but the English  language  the French  language  the Spanish  language  That of the Indians may be rather called a  tongue  than a  language  it being neither formal or regular  The generality of people content themselves with speaking the  tongue  common to the place they are bred up in without paying any regard to the beauties of their native  language    Fuddled Drunk Intoxicated  With respect to the two first of these words  drunk  rises upon that of  fuddled fuddled  implying a less degree of inebriation  drunk  a greater As to the word  intoxicated  its greatest distinction is that whereas  fuddled  and  drunk  are seldom used in the figurative sense that is hardly ever in the literal  Half a pint of wine will make some men  drunk  when others shall drink a gallon without being the least  fuddled  Good success will sometimes so  intoxicate  a person as to take him off from his business and render him disagreeable to all his acquaintance    Bargain Agreement Contract  Bargain  is more limited relating to sale  agreement  and  contract  are more general implying any sort of stipulation with this difference between them that  agreement  seems to denote a verbal one  contract  one that is written  It is a mark of honesty in dealing never to draw back from a  bargain  once made Such is the unsteadiness of mankind that we are frequently obliged to enter into  contract  in order to bind them to their  agreement    Mine My own  Though many are of opinion that the the word  own  is added to the possessive pronoun  my  by way of emphasis or corroboration only yet custom seems to have thrown into the idea of the expression  my own  a greater degree of property than into that of the word  mine  Thus a workman to whom certain tools have been appropriated by his master for the work he is imployed on might with propriety say these tools are  mine  though at the same time they are not  his own  being the property of his master So again a wife might lay claim to the cloaths she wears and say they are  mine  though she could not say with propriety that they were  her own  being in reality the property of her husband On the other hand the expression  my own  may with elegance be used by the person in whom the sole right of a thing is vested    Nigh Near  I will leave it to the decision of the curious whether or no the word  near  is not a corruption of  nigher  the comparative of  nigh  be this as it may  near  in my opinion implies a less distance than  nigh  Thus I should say when we come  nigh  to such a place we shall be  near  home the  nigher  the enemy the  nearer  the danger As a farther proof of this speaking of the close tyes of kindred we use the word  near  in preference to that of  nigh  as implying a less distance or greater degree of consanguinity between the two persons Thus my brother's child is my  near  relation or is  nearly  related to me    Efficacious Effectual  With respect to these two words that of  efficacious  seems not so powerful as that of  effectual  The first gets the better of most obstacles the last of all  By an  efficacious  remedy we put an  effectual  stop    Width Wideness  Width  seem more applicable to things small in themselves  wideness  to those which are large Thus we say the  width  of paper the  width  of cloth but the  wideness  of a ditch the  wideness  of a field  An ALPHABETICAL TABLE Of the WORDS treated of in these VOLUMES  A  TO Abandon  Forsake Leave Relinquish Desert Quit  Numb    To
