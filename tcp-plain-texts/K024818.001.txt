 ALWYN  OR THE Gentleman Comedian IN TWO VOLUMES  VOL I  In nova fert animus  OVID  LONDON PRINTED FOR FIELDING AND WALKER PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLXXX  To R B SHERIDAN  Esq  MEN OF GENIUS ARE THE BEST AND PROPEREST PATRONS OF LITERARY PRODUCTIONS  IT IS THEIR FIAT THAT GIVES STABILITY OR CONSIGNS TO OBLIVION AND EVERY ONE WILL READ WHAT THEY PRONOUNCE WORTHY TO BE READ  WHEN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS REMEMBERED NOBODY WILL WONDER TO SEE A DEDICATION TO THE AUTHOR OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL  PREFACE  WORKS of imagination have ever been the ornament of civilized nations The progress from barbarism to politeness is always accompanied by a similar gradation in the perfection of literary amusements The easiest consequently the earliest of these amusements was fable among the various kinds of which the narrative as the most simple and natural was the first In the ruder ages men listened with avidity to tales of the utmost simplicityâ–ª the story of the Belly and the Members could calm the rage of a mutinous people  Writers who wish at present to teach Morality by fiction have greater difficulties to encounter the shallow artifices of the wolf the fox and the lion are too easily discovered and are only now devoted to the instruction and recreation of children Character incident design diction probability c are requisite to attract the attention of readers beyond a certain sphere It would be perhaps a useless as well as a difficult task to discover whether the ancients possessed any species of writing that may be classed with what is meant by the word Novel The want of a quality which seems peculiar to modern Europe and is distinguished by the name of GALLANTRY must have  given such compositions a turn very different from the productions of the present time  IN the dark ages when bigotry and zeal had almost obliterated every trace of ancient literature the only writings meant for amusement were the legends of saints in which the marvellous was alone predominant Secure from criticism by the tremendous alliance between their works and THE FAITH the more improbable the story the greater was its merit with this species of writers Their imaginations thus emancipated their saints became warriors the extravagant fables of the old poets were outdone and the champions of Christendom rivalled the worthies of Greece  They overcame monsters and giants pursued necromancers through lakes of fire till by their prowess and prayers they sent the inchanters blaspheming through the air on the backs of fiery dragons and made their castles vanish These authors seem to have had a confused idea of the Grecian fables a similarity to the Cyclops Hydras Minotaurs Syrens and Circes may easily be traced The Phoenicians Egyptians Libyans Grecians Gauls each had a Hercules who performed wonderful and impossible things The monks invented one for the Christians only they called him St George But as he was more particularly the hero of England by being its tutelary saint each powerful  state was allotted a champion One of these St Dennis for France Voltaire has made a principal personage in the machinery of his Henriade  THESE miraculous tales were succeeded by romances of voluminous magnitude in which the passion of love was drawn in the most hyperbolical manner such were Clelia the grand Cyrus c A sameness of character of incident of language pervaded the whole Plot they had none and but one moral distributed through the endless pages of endless volumes yet these were the entertainment of the gay and the polite and were held in estimation so late as at the end of the last century  MODERN writers use the word Romance to signify a fictitious history of detached and independent adventures and under that idea call the Telemaque of Fenelon and the Cyrus of Ramsay Romances Le S  ge's Gil Blas and Smollet's Roderick Random though of a different species come under the same denomination A Novel is another kind of work Unity of design is its character In a Romance if the incidents be well marked and related with spirit the intention is answered and adventures pass before the view for no other purpose than to amuse by their peculiarity without perhaps affecting the main story if there should be one But in a Novel a combination of incidents  entertaining in themselves are made to form a whole and an unnecessary circumstance becomes a blemish by detaching from the simplicity which is requisite to exhibit that whole to advantage Thus as in dramatic works those circumstances which do not tend either to the illustration or forwarding the main story or which do not mark some character or person in the drama are to be esteemed unnecessary  HENCE it appears the legitimate Novel is a work much more difficult than the Romance and justly deserves to be ranked with those dramatic pieces whose utility is generally allowed Novels have fallen into disrepute Lovesick girls and boys  are supposed to be the only persons capable of being amused by them and while a poverty of stile a want of knowledge of the human heart of men and manners while a puny tale of love and misfortune cross fathers and unhappy children unnatural rigour and unaccountable reconciliation without discrimination of character without variety of incident with but one set of phrases one languid inanimate description with scarce a single ray of imagination to comfort the disconsolate reader are their great characteristics Novels shall continue to want admirers but Tom Jones shall never want admirers  CONTENTS TO THE FIRST VOLUME  LETTER I Mr ALWYN to Mr

letter from our old schoolfellow Pendril who saw you as he passed through Carlisle I need not tell you it gave me great pleasure to hear that you still exist in health and spirits after the chasm which your absence has occasioned in  our friendship and though your situation as a travelling comedian is such as some of your old acquaintance would not be over ready to recognize you under yet were I weak enough to be thus influenced the affectation in me would not only be mean but ridiculous My hereditary hopes do not surpass your's and could certain considerations be removed I don't know but it might be more agreeable to my sentiments call it pride if you please to live by my own labour than by that of the dead I am not unacquainted with the natural hilarity and chearfulness of your temper and I am of opinion that no matter what the rank in life while the mind is chearful the man is happyCincinnatus at the plough it is most probable was happier than Cincinnatus in the senateI know you begin to suspect this grave lecture few I believe preach about  happiness till they themselves either are or have been unhappyI own to you I am altered The smiles and pleasures are fled a gloom overhangs my youth and has shut out the sun my health declines and my worthy PatronPatronFriend Fatherall these cannot express the sense I have of his goodness wishes me to reside in the country for some time I wish it myselfI cannot be easy where I ammy disorder will increaseNot that I am anxious about lifeit is a comfort that sooner or later all our cares shall end and no sentiment ever came with greater force to me than that which Macbeth where the poet represents him torn and distracted with a thousand fears thus utters  Better be with the dead  Than on the torture of the mind to lie  In restless extasy  Duncan is in his grave  After life's fitful fever he sleeps well  Treason has done his worst Nor steel nor poison  Malice domestic foreign levy  Nothing  Can touch him further  These reflections are the cordials of my life Enough of this  You will be surprized perhaps when I tell you that I have an inclination to become an actor Hear my reasons I must either find a means of subsistence or live upon the bounty of others The first is agreeable to me the latter I can never consent to though Mr Stamford would supply me with the greatest chearfulness As it is necessary I should live some time in the country I can think of no scheme so eligible as this and shall be glad if you will enquire of your brother comedians whether they are willing to admit me of the society  I DO not mean to inform my master of my intention none but such as I  approve need know of my situation which I confess I shall be almost ashamed of I should however be more ashamed to be idle and the country affords no other source of employment to me Our mutual and early friendship is another inducement  SHOULD you perceive any thing im+proper either in the application to your brother comedians or from any other circumstance let not this be any restraint but act agreeably to reason and your own feelings which will be both approved and applauded by one who is perfectly conscious of the delicacy and propriety of them and who is proud to have the honour of subscribing himself  Your sincere and affectionate Friend H H ALWYN  LETTER II Mr HILKIRK to Mr ALWYN  DEAR HARRY  I Received your letter and I believe I need not take much pains to describe to you the pleasure I enjoy from this instance of the continuance of your attachment The bitter has so far predominated over the sweet during my peregrination in this vile world that I begin already to have a large proportion of cynical essence in my composition though not enough to overpower the pleasure I receive in Alwyn's friendship You will readily believe this when you recollect the avidity with which I always sought your company and the delight I took in it  I AM sorry to observe the air of melancholy so prevalent in your epistleit is not natural to you The lines of despair are marked strongly in your mind it is beneath youyou that have tasted friendship from all smiles from all love from all 'Tis enough for wretches like me outcasts from society to indulge the gloom but I am above it Is the weather cloudy I tune my pipe no matter where the cottage or the palace 'tis hard if I don't find somebody to danceDoes the sun shine let me enjoy the smiles of the season while I can My music is flown to the fields I follow it it warbles from the thorn it tinkles in the tears of the wandering brook it mourns in the plaintive song of the widowed linnetLet it'tis music still and music only will I bear Does the sleet of contempt batter my face or the biting frost of disappointment  assault my feelingsI am prepared better than Moor of Moorhall for the dragonI have armour of iambics a shield of raillery and a sword of satire more powerful than the sword of my old associate harlequin I send a herald in the form of a goosequill  to hurl defiance in their teeth  Tragic comic and farcical scenes are exhibited continually on the world's great theatre their frequency has made them familiar and I resolve henceforth to be rather a spectator than an actor I have played the fool in the farce too often  I AM sorry that I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you having agreed to take upon me the management of a company that travels in the west and being to set off the day after tomorrow to Taunton in Somersetshire whither my  baggage is already gone I have spoken to our manager respecting your coming hither and from the description I have given of your person and abilities he is anxious to see you and declares you are the very man he wants The company go from hence to Kendal the next week and he is desirous of meeting you there to open the house Had I known your intention before I made this new engagement I should have been happy in an opportunity of renewing our friendship personally as it is I must content myself with the pleasure of a frequent correspondence which I hope you will have no objection to  'TIS long since I have had the pleasure of your conversation accident has continued to deprive me of it To encourage you to a correspondence to  which I have invited you I will relate the history of my adventures from a supposition that they will not prove entirely uninteresting  JILTED by a girl abandoned by my friend my unprovided bark pushed from the strand by a violent passion for an unworthy object whom yet I can scarce forbear to love into dangerous and unknown seas no wary pilot to direct my course I ignorantly ran on lee shores allured by promising appearances and to stretch my metaphor presently became a wreck among savages in a strange land  By the waters of Babylon I sat down and wept  IT is now near four years since I left London and my companions at which period I was scarce twenty and you not above eighteen so that though we used  to amuse ourselves in our conversation long before upon rational subjects yet having little care about the future fortune of our lives we did not enquire much into each others views It is not the character of that age to be very solicitous about tomorrow I shall therefore relate such incidents as are necessary to form the connection of my little history lest it should else be unintelligible  THERE are several circumstances in my life which were they methodised properly spun out and interlarded with an episode or two between Mr Somebody and Miss Anybody would furnish the circulating libraries with two handsome pocket volumes The first that I shall mention and not the least extraordinary is that I am utterly ignorant of my parents or even whether I ever had a father or no Excuse this  stale attempt at a joke and suffer me to trifle with my miseries I remember little of my infantine state except being bred among fields farmhouses and country peasants I was removed from these at an early age to a cheap school in Yorkshire where I continued till my fourteenth year at which period the master informed me he could keep me no longer for that the person who had placed me with him was dead and my board and education already ten months in arrear but that a London gentleman had enquired if he had any boy of good intellects among his scholars who wanted a provision that he the schoolmaster had recommended me and upon his recommendation the gentleman had agreed to take me provided I consented to go which he advised me by all means to do The idea of being freed from the fear of birch of which our good  governor upon every trivial misdemeanor was as liberal as he was penurious in the articles of food and cloathing together with the hope of seeing a city that I had heard so wonderfully described operated sufficiently on my fancy to make me receive this propoposal with joy I had not however lived so many years with my playmates without having formed a few friendships among them but these though they cost me some tears at parting were presently forgot in the overflowings of a rapid imagination  I ARRIVED with Mr Seldon my new patron and master in London the latter end of October You are not ignorant of the character of this worthy man He took me to his house in Chancerylane where I underwent a long examination respecting my education  This was a source of flattery to me I was universally allowed the best scholar in the seminary from whence I had been taken and for three years past had been little obliged to my instructors Exclusive of the classics I had made a tolerable stride into mathematics and had often surprised old Declension himself with philosophical experiments which I had learnt from two or three books that till I condescended to look at them had been neglected and thrown about the school among other lumber I was the more powerfully induced to these exercises by the wonder they excited and the fame I acquired Mr Seldon expressed much satisfaction at my progress and after paying me some compliments told me he would now recommend other subjects to my notice The study of jurisprudence the knowledge of the natural and  civil rights of mankind and in what manner they are preserved or injured by the laws existing in this country he said would make me valuable to society and recommended me to the care of Mr Turnbull a man whom I am sure you must have observed during your intimacy at our house  MR SELDON was upwards of fifty had no wife nor family except Julia Gowland an orphan niece of about twelve years old whom he had taken from a boardingschool where he had placed her being not only dissatisfied with the oeconomy of the house but likewise desirous of her company and taking himself in a great measure the care of inuring her to proper habits His turn of thinking respecting education and habit was singular yet in my opinion just Boys he said should  be steeped in adversity casehardened in misery during their youth it gives them fortitude to support every change of fortune it makes them sensible of the simplicity with which man ought to live and shews them the folly and real inutility of numberless things which by some are deemed absolutely necessary to existence It is the best school of morality to a strong mind Girls should be made sensible how much mildness and resignation contribute to their happiness should be taught to support contradiction with chearfulness and smiles This is the duty as much of man as woman but it is the great source of pleasure to the latter Husbands are enchanted by mildness and acquiescence from their wives they feel their own superiority in point of strength they fancy it in point of understanding their free commerce with the world which is  denied to the other sex together with the advantages of education tend to confirm this opinion Youths should endure hardships but not be suffered to sink under them Females should be taught the virtue and necessity of a still tongue and a smiling countenance Such were the sentiments of a man who proved his wisdom by the consistency of his conduct and the order of his affairs  THERE is in the boy and girl age a susceptibility of attachment which we afterwards lose though with some regret I had not been long in Mr Seldon's family before Julia and I began reciprocally to feel a tender inclination it did not immediately appear though it insensibly increased We delighted as lovers do in mutual offices of kindness we began to sigh to languish as our years increased and before I was  eighteen I was deeply in love Mr Seldon did not at first seem suspicious of the consequence but was pleased with the simplicity of our affection Young as I was I had sagacity enough to make this observation and interpreted it to my own advantage I am become a favourite said I my master loves me and intends to give me his niece The sequel will shew how wretchedly I deceived myself  EXCLUSIVE of my passion for Julia I was not exempted from other youthful foibles I loved dress but what was worse I had addicted myself to a habit of frequenting a billiardtable My delight in the game soon taught me to play tolerably and the warmth of my temper not only engaged me to sport far beyond discretion but made me an easy prey to much inferior gamesters with  cooler heads to which add my fondness for theatrical diversions and my constant attendance at a spoutingclub and you will easily perceive the seeds of misfortune which have since sprung up so thick and the improbability of my continuing to enjoy the favour and protection of Mr Seldon  MR TURNBULL the upper clerk whom I mentioned from my first entrance into the family appeared to have a particular partiality for me and had taken almost as much pains in giving me proper advice as Mr Seldon himself without seeming to regard my little deviations from virtue with so severe an eye but this man's conduct has been to me inexplicable When any extravagancy had plunged me into a difficulty that affected my temper and made it visible Turnbull would never let me  rest till I had acquainted him with the cause of my trouble nor ever failed to assist me but then I had great reason from several hints more particularly from my master's behaviour to believe that he sometimes acquainted Mr Seldon with it  I SHALL forbear to enumerate incidents and only select a few that are necessary to explain why I so abruptly left Mr Seldon  I HAVE said that I frequented a spoutingclub This society was held at a reputable public house up one pair of stairs After I had in compliance with the usual forms paid for my ticket and passed the bar I saw one of my companions below that prevented me from immediately going up While he held me in conversation I heard a voice familiar  enough to me enquire if Mr Hilkirk was there the landlady answered in the affirmative and turning to look who the enquirer was I saw the back of Mr Turnbull passing quick out of the door I was rather alarmed I dreaded lest Mr Seldon should come to the knowledge of my tricks and I suspected Turnbull This fear however presently evaporated and I joined the roarers above whose tragic starts sounding thro' the ceiling operated strongly on my imagination It came to my turn to exhibit and I chose that scene in Macbeth where the bloody dagger appears in the air I was drest in a habit made in imitation of Garrick's with shaloon and tinsel  Banquo and Fleance had made their exit and I was proceeding with infinite applause through the soliloquy Just as I came to that place where the hero says  to the supposed dagger "I see thee still" my astonished eye caught the terrible form of Mr Seldon the effect this had upon me was evident from the audience my knees knocked my eyes were wild and rivetted my voice faultered I repeated  I see thee still  And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood  Which was not so before  The picture of terror was so perfect that the room echoed with plaudits but the scene was quickly changedI endeavoured to proceed"There's no such thing" said I staring at Mr Seldon  It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes    You are mistaken young man  answered he with the gravest face imaginable "it is no vision" This immediately turned the eyes of the whole assembly upon my master in a moment their serious praise was converted into the  loudest laughs while Mr Seldon with the same gravity commanded me to pull off that merry Andrew's jacket and quit enacting of the monarch in order to retire to my truckle bed under the desk At this speech the rafters once more trembled with the roar of laughter which from the complexion of the gentry there gathered together would doubtless have been augmented with catcalls shouts and hisses had not the deportment of Mr Seldon which in spite of impudence commanded respect in some degree overawed their mirth  MY situation was truly pitiable I uncased and my master with a slow voice and bow accompanied by the most serious look of ridicule and satire wished all the good company a very good night while I skulked after him more abashed than Thersites by the stern eye of Ulysses  The next morning Mr Seldon spoke to me to the following effect  By my behaviour to you last night young man you may be convinced I have some regard for you I engaged in a very aukward affair inconsistent to my character and disagreeable to my inclination purposely to expose your absurdity in so strong a light that you could not help feeling it These societies among which I understand you are become a leading man have an idle ridiculous and vicious tendency therefore if you desire to gain my esteem let me hear no more of your kingly antics  AT the moment this counsel was given I thought I would observe it more religiously than if it had been a mandate delivered by an angel I have only in excuse the plea of the converted infidel  the flesh was willing but the spirit was weak  MY love for Julia accelerated the catastrophe and a match at billiards compleated it I must speak of them in order  IT would be tedious at least to any but lovers to relate the progress of love Let it be sufficient to say that our passion was arrived to that stage which produced mutual declarations and vows of everlasting fidelity Convinced as I thought of her disinterestedness and sincerity enchanted by her beauty and the softness and sweetness of her manners my affection became violent After the above explanation my pursuit of other pleasures was for some time entirely abated her society was perfect happiness her company and conversation I  believed to be absolutely necessary to my existence but alas I have proved the possibility of existing without them Repeated asseverations of constancy continual opportunities of indulging in all the languor of delicate and excessive love which we did as far as we could with innocence and without discovering our passion I had no dread of meeting opposition from any but Mr Seldon  WE had been so cautious for some months after the avowal of our affection that I had no reason to believe we were suspected whether I was deceived in this or whether we became less guarded I know not but by accident I overheard Mr Seldon saying something to Mr Turnbull to the following effect  I'll suffer it no longer I am resolved he  shall quit this family His temper irregular his passions untamed he is no way calculated to make either her or himself happy he would be fond for a week captious and overbearing within a month and become completely miserable in a very short time to suffer him to marry with his present inexperience rashness and want of proper habits were more unmerciful than to cast him into the sea  I hardly knew whether to apply the above discourse to myself or not it described Mr Seldon's friendship for me in so lively a manner that I had some reason to hope it true on the one hand while on the other it cut me off from every prospect of felicity  BUT what shall I say to the conduct of Julia who of a sudden and without assigning any reason became distant and  ceremonious even to disdain as I imagined Instead of contrivances to throw herself in my way which I had before observed with pleasure she took every method to avoid me If by chance I caught her alone she would break from me and threaten to inform Mr Seldon if I persisted in detaining her This might be prudent but I am certain it was perfidious It agreed but ill with her former protestations  WHY should I torture myself to relate more of this tale than is necessary It upbraids me it reminds me of my weakness My present feelings convince me I have not yet forgotten the traitress I must quit the subject for this time I have raised a train of images that do not contribute to my tranquillity Adieu  W HILKIRK  LETTER III Mr ALWYN to Mr STAMFORD Junior  Dear SIR  IN obedience to your commands I take the advantage of the first postday to inform you of my safe arrival at Kendal To a mind perfectly at ease the contrast between Westmoreland and London must be very forcible Notwithstanding the little leisure I who am under the influence of an unconquerable passion can find I yet cannot entirely forbear to observe the sudden change of scene It seems scarce an hour since the noise of London with her ten thousand carriages rattled in my ears I listen and find myself conveyed to the region of silence The face of the country likewise is as different as the most romantic imagination can suppose No beautiful green hedges intersecting the  plain no regular rows of stately elms or spreading oaks meet the eye but uncouth stonewalls vast wilds and prodigious mountains Nature appears bleak and unadorned but grand and capacious Here and there a straggling peasant is seen with wooden shoes and lank hair unconscious of what we call grace and elegance and cloathed only to defend him from the assaults of the season Here ever object is bleached as it were by time and simplicity in London a satirist would add every thing is sullied by smoak hypocrisy and detraction Not that I should admire either the wit or sentiment of the expression  MEN are naturally much the same and considering the vast number of them who inhabit that great city I am often astonished at the order and tranquillity which are generally preserved If the  people here are honester or happier it is because they have not so many temptations The glittering of equipage the blaze of tapers the inchantments of music routs balls operas gaudy colours lewd women decorated in all the emblazonments of art folly and fashion such allurements tempt not inflame not the imagination of the inhabitants of the wilds in Westmoreland A small assembly among the gentry and opulent tradesmen and the players for about six or eight weeks constitute their highest ideas of public luxury Neither are those wanting who inveigh with great warmth and acrimony against these amusements especially the latter This is not wonderful when we recollect that great part of the inhabitants of Kendal are Quakers They have an excellent faculty of staring at a stranger and I was questioned today by some of  the old dons who are the only people here that think themselves privileged to ask impertinent questions how such a good looking young man as I as they were pleased to call me could think of becoming a player  MY landlord tells me he doubts I am a wild young dog His wife says she is afraid my poor mother has many an aching heart upon my account for she is sure I am some good body's son who has had a world of trouble to bring me up I told her that my mother is living and she became very importunate for me to return home and save her from breaking her heart This conversation happened last night and I assure you I went to bed quite lowspirited with her good oldfashioned exhortations Indeed I am so well convinced of my dear mother's tenderness that I  am afraid her conjectures are too true I begin almost to repent of my journey I know no right I have to mingle wormwood in the bitter cup of old age However I wrote into Oxfordshire by this post and hope my fears are without foundation  THERE are other reasons why I am not the most happy mortal in the world Forgive me dear Charles You know my heart I can conceal nothing from your friendship I should be unworthy of it if I could Your sister's image lives in my bosom Oh MariaNo change of time of place or object can obliterate the memory of thy charms on the barren mountain in the fruitful valley musing on the gliding stream or supine beneath the venerable oak still shall thy welcome recollection call forth the painful pleasing sigh of melancholy  and cause to steal unbid the tear of sorrow down my cheek  PITY but do not blame me I know I have no pretensions to so amiable so beautiful an object but who could live in the same house and behold her angelic form hear her enchanting voice observe her benevolent her soulwinning actions and forbear to adore her I am conscious of my own unworthiness I know how much my kind patron has the happiness of his cherubim as he justly calls her at his heart I have heard of his intentions it has been said there is one whom he wishes her to love I am not to learn how dearly you my friend tender your father and sister's tranquillity and it were the utmost baseness in me to attempt to render those miserable were it in my power whom I have every  reason to love and revere above all the world  NO person but you knows my real motive for retiring from my friends My passion was insupportable and the peace of your family was concerned It was painful to fly but gratitude friendship and love demanded it My present employment is unknown and I would have it so My health began to decline and that was a fair pretence for going into the country My predilection to the drama made this scheme present itself as the most probable one of diverting my ideas from the channel in which they so constantly flow but I am fearful this and every thing else on this side the grave will be ineffectual  I KNOW you will excuse these effusions  from a despairing lover and rest assured whatever may be my fate I will never give you cause to accuse me of insincerity  I am dear Sir with the utmost respect the most affectionate of those who have the honour to call themselves your friends  H H ALWYN  LETTER IV Mr HILKIRK to Mr ALWYN  Dear ALWYN  I AM arrived at Taunton and expect this will reach you at Kendal I shall continue the relation of my adventures without any apology I mean to draw an abstract of my misfortunes that after having compared them with your own you may try whether it is not possible to strike a balance in my favour The world will say I have deserved my fate I grant it  GOADED by despair stung and distracted by the continual recollection of Julia's perfidy I became regardless of future consequences Neglecting you and every rational friend who I imagined had come to a knowledge of circumstances that hurt my vanity I  sought to drown my sorrows in dissipation Drinking was my aversion and the gamingtable became my resource My ideas of justice and honour tho' too firmly rooted to be easily eradicated could not entirely preserve me from the contagion that reigns in these horrid receptacles of vice and infamyI found myself insensibly drawn into a familiarity with acknowledged rascals Launched into a sea of guilt I was borne away by the tide and though I beheld my danger had not strength to regain the shore of virtue  IT had been a custom with Mr Seldon from the time that I was sixteen to allow me a regular stipend with which I defrayed my own expences of cloaths and other necessaries the sum was liberal considering my situation and had received an annual increase He had just  paid me a quarter's allowance out of which my extravagance had brought me under an obligation to discharge a number of debts besides leaving several others unpaid Conscious of my weakness as soon as I received the money I put ten guineas in my pocket with a resolution to disperse them immediately among my creditors without giving myself time to hear a billiardball or lay a bett As I was proceeding upon this virtuous errand my evil genius threw a noted gambler in my way known by the name of Long Jack with whom I was acquainted He enquired where I was going I to prove the strength of my virtue very candidly told him that I was running with my ten guineas to pay my debts and as he was well apprized of my passion for play asked him if he did not think me wise for so doing to which he replied in the affirmative  in so positive a manner that his approbation appeared perfectly sincere asking withal how long it would be before he saw me at Jackson's meaning the gaminghouse to which I usually resorted I told him I should hardly be there that evening for that my present business would find me employment Zounds said he that's unlucky I have made a match for you with Oneeyed Harry the odd game in eleven for five pounds to meet at eight I have been to Connor's and two or three tables to look for you if you don't play I forfeit a guinea to the blinking rascal Why it is half past seven now answered I Aye said he I know it I lost nine pounds this morning with him however it is no matter bst his odd eye I'll have it out of him one way or another  I HAD seen too many of the tricks of  these worthies not to have my doubts concerning the reality of this pretended match and putting on one of my penetrating looks I asked him if he was not deceiving me but he confirmed the truth of his tale with such violent imprecations cursing both soul and body so liberally and consigning them over to the devil so entirely if his guinea was not lost unless I played that abandoned as I believed him and all of them to be I did not think it possible for any wretch to have so totally quitted all sense of shame as to swear so horridly to a falshood He observed likewise how much the match was in my favour which as he stated it was actually the case and that though I might have a good opportunity of winning money upon my own play yet as it was entirely optional I might sport or let it alone  You will think me very weak and irresolute when I inform you that I could not resist the impatient longing this fellow inspired me with but what will you say when I tell you that I had no sooner began to play than contemning every recollection of future consequence and shame my money flew about the room and I greedily snapt at every bait that was thrown out to me Those who have never fallen a sacrifice to this infernal disease cannot have an adequate idea of its malignancy of the pleasure that it promises or the torture it inflicts and those only who are acquainted with its tyranny know how to pity their fellowslaves  I PLAYED with various fortune till ten o'clock when I found myself pennyless Stung with my egregious folly driven to madness at the remembrance of those  to whom I was indebted I could not be contented but would play on upon credit This unfortunately for me they willingly indulged me in as I had ever paid debts of this kind with the utmost punctuality Thus with my hand shaking my mind distracted my eyes dazzled and blinded by the disorder of my brain did I engage to play at a game that requires a cool head a keen eye and a steady hand against men who knew how to take every advantage and for sums which I was conscious of my inability to discharge  WHILE I was in the heat of play and as if inspired by the daemons of the place abjuring every title to heaven and mercy imprecating curses on my soul and misery on my body Mr Turnbull came in I was now arrived to that height of despair which puts us beyond  a certain degree of fear and the sight of him which at another time in such a place would have struck a damp over me was disregarded Some one who knew me and had seen the manner of my proceeding had kindly gone and informed Mr Turnbull of it He perceived my situation and desired me to put on my coat and come home to which I answered in a resolute tone that I would not while the rascals that surrounded me said with a deal of seeming pity that they had advised the young gentleman to play no more for they saw he could not win and that they thought he had better be persuaded and leave off This impudent lie heightened my madness to that degree that I uttered a volley of curses which astonished Mr Turnbull and he immediately left the room in which whispers malicious grins of triumph lolling  of tongues and winking of eyes were exhibited with peculiar archness I continued playing swearing and losing for a few minutes till I was interrupted by the return of Mr Turnbull accompanied by Mr Seldon Nothing could have added to the horrors I felt but this The mace dropt from my hand the blood forsook my cheeks and with my mouth open and eyes staring I stood for a moment stupid when suddenly a fit of phrenzy seized me I snatched up the billiardballs that lay before me and with one in one hand and the other in the other struck myself violently on each side of the head and dropt motionless on the floor  IN this manner did the scene shut on me for that night With my senses I lost the remembrance of my disgrace till the following morning when I awoke  though to less wild yet not less poignant griefs and it was the greatest care only that could and did preserve me from a fever  THE folly I had committed the disgrace I had incurred the impossibility of ever looking again on Mr Seldon with confidence added to the afflictions I endured from my unhappy love made me resolve to quit a family where it was impossible I should enjoy a moment's peace Had not my own desire prompted me to this course I should still have been obliged to have taken it Mr Seldon had avoided seeing or speaking to me since the sin of the billiards it was with him a mortal one and not to be forgiven Accordingly when I was out of danger from the little illness I had suffered he sent Mr Turnbull to me who spoke to the following purport  Mr Seldon desires me to acquaint you that it is necessary you should quit his house it is a duty that he owes both to his peace and reputation to harbour no one who disturbs the one or sullies the other he has sent you twenty guineas with which he advises you to seek your fortune in some place where your character is not known being certain he says that no man in his senses will harbour a gambler to the endangering perhaps of not only his property but his life he likewise adds that you must expect no future favour from him of any kind whatever  WHEN Turnbull had finished he laid the guineas which I did not offer to receive upon a table and with tears in his eyes quitted the room I was some time before I could recover myself enough to move from the place where  I stood for though I had every reason to expect something of this kind yet it did not destroy the effect At last I recollected myself a little and taking pen and ink wrote a long letter directed to Mr Seldon and put it by the side of the money he had sent me This epistle contained an acknowledgment of my guilt and an admiration of his lenity and goodness many thanks for the favours I had so often received and so ill deserved a refusal of his last bounty from the following motivesâ–ª first from a conviction of my unworthiness secondly from a resolution that since my own indiscretion had plunged me into distress I alone would be the sufferer a punishment that I would not forego and lastly that I could not prevail upon myself to incur any more obligations because it was scarcely possible I should discharge them  I then collected such of my cloaths as were paid for and with my bundle in my hand shame on my countenance and my heart ready to burst went or rather slunk out of a house in which I once thought myself universally beloved  WITHOUT money without a friend that shame or pride would suffer me to disclose my distress to or a habitation of any kind to hide my head in I found myself in the midst of London streets forsaken and forlorn an outcast and alien among mankind I had heard of people whose employment it was to kidnap and decoy others on board of ships that they might transport them to America Never did a wretched fearful criminal more earnestly wish for a reprieve than at this moment I longed to meet with one of those friendly kidnappers  My mind incoherent sunk with grief and despondency could think of no resource from absolute starving At last as I was wandering at the discretion of my feet my eye accidentally glanced upon a printed bill again the wall This was an invitation to all those spirited young fellows who chose to make their fortunes as common soldiers in the service of the EastIndia company I beheld it with more joy than the Jews did the grapes brought from the land of promise and was posting with all haste to enroll my name among that honourable corps when I was prevented by one Evans whom I had known at the spoutingclubs He seeing my bundle and my rueful face asked me where I was going to which I replied that had he asked me five minutes sooner I could not have informed him but that at present I was for the wars When I  had explained myself he appeared greatly surprized and told me he thought he could put me upon a better scheme than that and one more suitable to my inclination likewise He said one Macloughlin a famous London actor was going over to play in Dublin that he had been enquiring of him concerning a young fellow such as me and that if I chose he would introduce me to him observing that it would be time enough to carry the knapsack if the sock did not succeed This proposal was too agreeable to be heard with inattention Accordingly having thanked my quondam acquaintance and after accepting his offer related the deplorable state of my finances at which he did not seem at all shocked or surprized I at his entreaty accompanied him to his lodging which was at a piecebroker's in Whitehorseyard Drurylane up  three pair of stairs backwards with a pleasant prospect of gardens in twopenny pots smoked tiles and right ancient chimnies  HAVING come to a mutual explanation I found my friend Evans but little better stocked with money than myself the sum total being twopence halfpenny so that my watch and my small wardrobe considered I was much the richer man He told me we need not be in want of cash at present for that lord North's office was always open to young gentlemen in distress who carried a watch or had a superfluous shirt or suit of cloaths Lord North's office was a cant phrase for a neighbouring pawnbroker's of that name whither with my consent he conveyed such of my apparel as I had least need of to be brushed and laid by as his joke had it  and in return brought me the sum of one guinea which might be something less than a third of its worth and which I divided with him As for the watch it was a new one that I had lately had upon credit and which as I knew it was now out of my power to pay for I was determined to return This task I performed that very afternoon in utter contradiction to the advice of Evans who remarked with what elocution a gold tatler would plead its master's cause to the ears of the beforementioned lord and how carefully he always preserved such tokens of friendship even to the condescending sometimes to wear them in his own fob I wrote likewise for I had not effrontery enough to face them to all my creditors and of the small hopes there were of their being paid at present but with a promise that no opportunity should slip whenever I had it  in my power and this promise I have kept so faithfully that I am now out of the dread of duns  THE next day as was proposed I was introduced to Mr Macloughlin by whom I found Evans was employed as a kind of scout to pick up youngsters who had promising geniuses it being one of this actor's passions to make actors of others though perhaps in some respects the worst qualified for it of any man in the world He was seated upon his couch which stood by the fire and on which when he found himself weary or sleepy he went to rest either by day or night as it happened and sometimes did not go to bed for a fortnight together according to the information of my conductor As we went in we were followed by his wife who brought him a bason of tea and some  toast with each of which he found fifty faults in the rudest manner While I staid he called to her several times upon very frivolous occasions at each of which she was dignified by the name and title of Bess His countenance was to me of all I had ever beheld the most forbidding and age which had deprived him of his teeth had not added to its softness After having desired me to sit down he eyed me pretty narrowly and then asked me  What had put it into my head to turn actor  The abruptness of the question disconcerted me and it was some time before I could answer which I did in rather a confused manner at last by saying I had taken  it into my head  to suppose it was genius but that it was very possible I might be mistaken Yes said he that's possible enough and by Gd Sir you are not the first that I have known so mistaken  I smiled at his satire and he grinned ghastly with his leathern lips a happy omen for I perceived I had not added to the beauty of his visage when I repeated his words While he was drinking his tea we discoursed upon indifferent subjects and as I did not happen to differ in opinion with him but on the contrary had opportunities of saying several things which corroborated his dogmas he was pleased to allow I had the appearance of an ingenious young man When his beverage was finished he desired me to speak a speech out of some play which having performed he remarked that he had never in his life heard a young spouter speak naturally and therefore he was not surprised that I did not however as I seemed tractable and docile if I would call on the morrow he would hear and answer me further  WHEN we had descended into the street Evans said he was sure it would do for that I had met with a very kind reception which indeed was the case it not being one of this person's foibles to oversweeten his behaviour or conversation with the mild honey of the graces As I look upon him to be a very extraordinary man I shall endeavour to give you the outlines of his picture and though upon the whole he behaved exceedingly ill to me I will be careful that the drawing shall not be out of nature  THOUGH he was born in the last century according to his own confession yet the faculties of his mind did not seem in the least impaired He is said to have been bred in the interior parts of Ireland and in such utter ignorance that we are told from respectable  authority of his not being able to read at the age of forty the progress therefore which he has made in language and literature are astonishing testimonies of his genius and assiduity His body like his mind is cast in a mould as rough as it is durable His aspect and address confound and confuse his inferiors and the delight he takes in making others fear and admire him gives him an aversion to the company of those whose knowledge exceeds his own nor did I ever hear him acknowledge superiority in any man He has no respect to the timidity or pudency of youth or sex but will say the most discouraging as well as the rudest things and receives pleasure in proportion to the pain he communicates It is common with him to ask his pupils why they did not rather think of becoming bricklayers  labourers than actors He is impatient of contradiction to an extreme and when he finds fault if the culprit attempts to answer he stops him without hearing him with  Ha you have always a reason for being in the wrong  This impatience goes still further it often renders him abusive He can pronounce scoundrel bh and rascal with ease and familiarity and without the least annoyance to his nervous system He pretends to the strictest degree of impartial justice and while his passions are unconcerned preserves it but these are so exceedingly irritable that the least contradiction is an insufferable insult and the want of capacity or immediate comprehension in his pupils is to him sufficient occasion to indulge his anger which is often exceedingly rancorous and has the direct tendency of inciting  despair instead of emulation especially if the scholar's feelings are quick and sensible This is too severe a climate for the tender plant of genius ever to thrive in Though his judgment is sound and his instructions in general those of a master yet he may be and is sometimes wrong but if the learner should dare to think for himself or offer the least word in defence of a different opinion it is high treason against this stage monarch and he is more scurrilous and unmerciful than judge Jefferies In short if I may estimate the sensations of others by my own those despots who we are told shoot their attendants for their diversion are not glanced at with more awe nor much more honour than Mr Macloughlin by his pupils and domestics  AFTER having finished our visit we  adjourned to the Black Lion in RusselStreet whither many of the theatrical people resort Here I learnt that Mr Foote was going to take a company to Edinburgh after the close of his summer season Being anxious to secure myself an engagement and the manner of Mr Macloughlin having neither prejudiced me much in his favour nor given me any certain token of success I resolved to make application to this other gentleman Accordingly after some slight excuse to Evans I posted away into SuffolkStreet  I HAD the good fortune to find the wit at breakfast with a young fellow who he had employed partly on the stage and partly as an amanuensis After being shewn into the room and desired to sit down "Well" said he  young gentleman I guess your business by the  sheepishness of your manner you have got the theatrical cacoethes you have rubbed your shoulder against the scene hey is it not so  I replied in the affirmative  Well and what great hero should you wish to personate Hamlet or Richard or Othello or who  I answered I distrusted my capability of performing any that he had mentioned "Indeed" said he  that's a wonderful sign of grace I have been teazed for these many years by all the spouters in London of which honourable fraternity I dare say you are a member for I can perceive no stage varnish none of the true strolling brass lacker on your face  "No indeed Sir"  I thought so Well Sir I never saw a spouter before that did not want to surprize the town in Pierre or Lothario or some character that requires every  requisite and address of a master in the art But come give us a touch of your quality a speech here's a youngster  pointing to his secretary  will roar Jaffier against Pierre the loudest take both  Accordingly he held the book and at it we fell the scene we chose was the first of the beforementioned gentlemen in Venice Preserved For a little while at the beginning I took the roaring hint he had thrown out and restrained my wrath but it appeared so insipid and the ideas of rant and excellence were so strongly connected in my mind that when Jaffier began to exalt his voice I could no longer contain my indignation but as Nic Bottom says  Midsummer Night's Dream  we roared so that it would have done your heart good to have heard us Foote smiled and after enduring this vigorous attack upon  his tympanum as long as he was able interrupted us  FAR from discouraging me he told me that with respect to giving the meaning of the words I spoke much more correct than he expected but said he like other novices you seem to imagine all excellence lays in the lungs whereas such violent exertions should be used but very sparingly and upon extraordinary occasions for besides that these two gentlemen instead of straining their throats are supposed to be in common conversation if an actor makes no reserve of his powers how is he to rise consistent to the tone of the passion He then read the scene we had rehearsed and with so much propriety and ease as well as force that I was surprized having always supposed risibility the only emotion he could inspire  AFTER this he demanded if I could sing to which I answered in the affirmative and that I had likewise some knowledge of music for you know it is a science that I as well as you always took great delight in When he had heard me chant he praised my voice but told me that as I was entirely inexperienced with respect to the stage if I was engaged with him my salary at first would be very low He said it was impossible to judge with certainty of stage requisites till they had been proved and that if after having considered of it I judged it expedient to accept of one pound per week I might come to him again a day or two before the theatre in the Haymarket shut up but that if I could meet with a more flattering offer in the mean time he begged this might be no obstacle for that as I might suppose it would be of no consequence  to him and wished me a good morning  I CAME away from this great wit delighted with the easiness and frankness of his behaviour and elated with my success However as I had promised Macloughlin to call I did not think proper to fail Accordingly at this my second visit he gave me a part to read in a piece which he himself was the author of and which had met with much success When I had finished this task with which he appeared tolerably satisfied he paid my understanding a great compliment by reading some scenes of a new comedy which he was then writing Not that I can suppose he expected me to make any remarks that could assist him but from that kind of weakness to which the strongest minds are in some degree subject a desire of applause  and a hope that others will corroborate the vast opinion we at certain moments entertain of our own capacity This is in some degree laudable at least excusable and where genius is really concerned must become extravagant to merit our censure The scenes that I heard were characteristic and satirical and met with my sincere and hearty approbation which I suppose did not a little contribute to prejudice Macloughlin in my favour  I THOUGHT myself bound in honour not to act with duplicity I therefore told him of the offer I had had from Foote giving at the same time my reason for such conduct namely the necessity I was under of getting into some employment or starving He allowed the cogency of it but said he thought I might do better in Ireland He asked if I had any objection  to become a prompter adding that it was profitable and an office from the good hand I wrote and other circumstances for which I might easily be qualified I answered he was the best judge of that and that I had no other dislike to it except that it would be more agreeable to my inclination to be an actor This he replied might be indulged and render me so much the more useful Little parts would be frequently wanting the going on for these would accustom me to face the audience and tread the stage which would prepare me for better I then demanded what salary I should have annexed to this business to which he answered that as I had my trade to learn I could not expect so much as a better workman but that since there was a deal of trouble in it I could not have less than thirty shillings especially as  I undertook to do small parts occasionally He informed me that he was not manager himself he only went as a performer but that Mr Mn one of the managers was in town with whom he would speak concerning me and in two or three days I might have a positive answer In the mean time he desired I would call on a morning and he would give me instructions in the part I had read to him for that he had some thoughts of letting me play it I was sensible of his favours and after making him every acknowledgment departed much better pleased than at my first visit  ADIEUMy next will finish this long enumeration of trifles  W HILKIRK  LETTER V Mr STAMFORD Jun to Mr ALWYN  Dear HARRY  I WAS happy in receiving your favour which though not to be called a short one I found deficient in many particularsperhaps the impatience of my regard for you made me think so This is finding fault you'll say and in truth I find myself a little disposed to blame you for giving no account of the heroes and demigods into whose society you are I presume by this time admitted Your offer of correspondence I accept with much pleasure but give you warning that I shall expect a very minute account of all your transactions which cannot fail of being important and on the other hand as I  am not so situated as to expect a series of adventures you must allow me to finish  sans ceremonie  when I have nothing to communicate I should be very much inclined to laugh at your plan of operations if the circumstances that engage my notice were of less consequence to your happiness We have all been very dull since your departure My father is frequently observing that he misses his favourite Harry and never mentions your name without some epithet expressive of his love or good opinion Maria poor girl feels I fear too powerfully the effects of love You often said when I remarked the tenderness of my sister's behaviour to you that it proceeded only from the sweetness of her temper and the benevolence of her disposition and not from my real partiality in your favour That modesty which makes you blind to your  own merit occasioned your saying so but I always thought otherwise and your absence confirms me in that opinion Her chearfulness is fled she often complains she is not well and takes every opportunity of stealing from company Her harpsichord is her only amusement where she is continually singing that plaintive little song you wrote and which with the assistance of her musicmaster she set I have often observed the tear starting from her eye at the last stanza which she sings with the most pathetic expression seeming to breathe forth her soul in the melody This she often apologizes for with a forced smile  I know brother  says she  you think me very foolish for being so affected with feigned sorrows but I cannot help it  I always tell her I love her for it for tears of compassion are nature's  marks of distinction and the heart that never melts is less than human Whenever your name is mentioned her bosom heaves with a sigh that she in vain endeavours to suppress and when I told my father I had heard from you she could scarcely conceal her emotions  SHE begged I would let you know that she misses your company and assistance at her studies and hoped you would recover your health so as to enable you to return to town next winter Besides said she you may tell him I am quite at a loss for a beau As for a beau replied my father I take it you will soon be provided with one without waiting for our Harry for Mr Maitland acquaints me that his son Tom is coming up to town next week and who knows what may happen between this and Christmas The last  sentence was spoke in a kind of arch manner that shewed his visit was in consequence of a previous agreement between old Maitland and him Maria understood it so and making a half bow of acknowledgment sat very grave and silent during the rest of the conversation  THIS passed at dinner and in the evening when the business in the countinghouse was settled my father sent for me into his study where I found him sitting with a letter in his hand  "CHARLES" said he  I have for some time been considering about settling you and your sister in life as it would be the highest satisfaction to me to see my children respectably situated before I die An idle man of property is a more useless being than the indolent in a  lower situation The man of great fortune and influence owes to the state his advice and protection and he whose situation does not immediately call him into life is nevertheless bound in a great measure to enter into society for indolence and inactivity are only for those who have spent the former part of their lives in that reciprocation of  offices that the wants of manki  demand Considerations of this nature induced me to bring you up in the mercantile line and I know you regard my advice enough to continue in it after I am gone I shall not now enlarge on the profession nor remind you in how many ways it will be in your power to assist and support individuals as well as your country without injuring yourself but am at present to acquaint you that I have determined to admit  you into partnership with me and that the articles are now ready for executing  I was going to answer when he proceeded thus  I shall continue in the house if I live four years at the expiration of which term I shall quit the business in your favour and retire to finish my days at my house in Kent As for Maria  continued he "this letter contains a proposal which I think much to her advantage It is from  my old friend Maitland and I have answered it by tonight's post informing him that I intend to give her fifteen thousand pounds besides which she is possessed of a little estate of about l a year left her by her aunt Conan but that she will have no more till after my decease I shall say nothing to Maria on the subject till young Maitland arrives but expect the marriage will be celebrated  some time next winter when his father  mes to town  I DARE say my dear Harry this will prove a heartfelt st  oke to you I assure you that I fee  o  you as well as my sister who I am convinced will be very unhappy if the match takes place My father is I fear too much a man of the world ever to consent to your wishes which for my part I sincerely desire to see accomplished though the present prospect affords no ground for hope but whatever turn affairs may take you may depend on having frequent accounts from me I am  Dear Harry you sincere Friend  C STAMFORD  P S  I have enclosed a copy of the letter from Mr Maitland to my father and need make no comment on the peculiarity of the style c

VII Mr HILKIRK to Mr ALWYN  Dear HARRY  I RECEIVED your's from Kendal by which I am informed of your safe arrival I am glad that the relation of my adventures has afforded you pleasure and in compliance with your request shall here send you the remainder It is a happiness to me to be able to gratify or oblige my friend at so cheap a rate  IT was not long before every thing was settled in the manner proposed by Mr Macloughlin and I was informed it was necessary for me to set off for Dublin it being the intention of the proprietors to open the theatre about the beginning of October In consequence  of my desire to appear in some  cter he had promised not only to procure me such an opportunity but likewise to instruct and become my patron and upon my representing to him my want of cash for the journey he lent me six guineas on the part of the managers and gave me a letter to Mr O'Neal who would out of respect to him provide me with a lodging and do me other services of the like nature which could not but be agreeable to a youngster like me  I REWARDED my friend Evans with a guinea redeemed my cloaths with another and left London elated with the most flattering prospects Could I have forgot the name of Julia and the family of Seldon I should at this moment have been a stranger to sorrow but that was impossible  ABOUT the latter end of September I arrived in Dublin The  scene and the vast  the oeconomy and manners of the people made a strong impression upon my imagination The bar at the mouth of the Liffy renders the entrance up that river passable but to ships of small burthen and to them only when the tide serves It was low water when we came to the mouth of it and a boat came along side of our vessel into which most of the cabbin and steerage passengers went rather than wait another tide and I among the rest The river divides the city and there were about a dozen who were set on shore on the quay but I as per letter enquired for Capelstreet which was on the contrary side Thither accordingly I was carried and my trunk and myself landed in a beerhouse I was astonished when the waterruffians with  their red beards black hair and wild eyes dem  d five and fivepence together with a qua  t of threepenny for my carriage from the packet the more so as I had seen the other passengers give but a shilling each and one or two of the meaner among them only sixpence I remonstrated at the imposition and quoted the precedent of the shilling to which one of these modest gentry replied in the true Connaught accent  F'why  now blood and ouns sure we can see now that you are a sweet honey of an English young  Jontleman  and sure  agrah  I always delight to see an English  Jontleman sit  his foot on board my boat Long life to 'em they don't come like Spalpeens  wid  a sixpence halfpenny in their hand sure  f'why  to a poor man And so as you are a stranger  f'why  we brought you to this beerhouse  becase  as  f'why  the  divel  so honest a  fillow  is there in all  whole city of Dublin as my landlord  ere  To this harangue the landlord who pretended to be in my interest replied that  to be sure there was not two honester  fillows brathing  than Pat M'Cullogh and Brian O'Flanaghan but  howiver  the  divel  burn you Brian  added he  you see the  Jontleman  is a stranger and so you must take no more than four and fourpence which Sir is just four English shillings and the pot of threepenny  THE wildness of their looks the smoothness of their tongues and the possession they had taken of my trunk upon which one of them seated himself while the other argued the case occasioned me to comply with their demands  but that which was the greatest cause of admiration to me in the whole scene was that the landlord who swore by the holy Father to their honesty while I was paying them no sooner saw their backs turned than according to his own phraseology  he pitched them to the  divel  for a couple of cutthroat  chating  rascals that  desarved  hanging worse than a murderer  I AM sorry to say that during my short stay in Ireland I had but too many occasions to observe a shocking depravity of morals which I attribute either to the laws or the want of a due enforcement of them The Irish are habitually not naturally licentious They have all that warmth and generosity which are the characteristics of the best dispositions and when properly educated are an honour to mankind Hibernia  has produced many firstrate geniuses and in my opinion nothing but the foregoing circumstance has prevented her from producing many more It is the legislature that forms the manners of a nation  WHEN I set out from London I was assured that the house would open at the beginning of October but it was November before the season commenced so that my finances were once again exhausted and I was obliged to apply on the credit of Macloughlin to Mr O'Neal for a farther supply Our acting manager was one O'Dogherty alias Dawson a busy bustling fellow that pretended to carry the world before him Void of principle an enemy to truth except when it served his purpose better than falshood inured to flattery from the poor wretches whom  he employed as servants about the house and whom it was his custom to kick with the utmost familiarity whenever he found himself so disposed I presently discovered there was an insurmountable antipathy between his disposition and mine But the means of my existence were at stake I endeavoured therefore to accommodate myself as much to his temper as possible and waited for the arrival of Macloughlin with the utmost impatience I understood my engagement to have been permanently fixed at thirty shillings a week but when I went to the treasury I found it reduced to a guinea and whenever I pleaded my agreement received the most mortifying and insulting answers I perceived the utter improbability of my becoming a favourite None were so but such as could administer the most gross flattery and who  listened to whatever was said in the theatre concerning this demagogue and his management and repeated the gleanings of their industry in his private earI vainly supposed the presence of Macloughlin would put an end to all my grievances I looked up to him as my patron as one who had been the occasion of my leaving England who had pledged himself to be my friend and was bound to protect me Whether O'Dogherty had prejudiced him against me or whether he observed my deficiency at adulation I cannot determine but I found him very cold in my interest and far more disposed to browbeat than countenance me He had promised to teach me a part and bring me out in it and when I ventured to remind him of it I received only sarcastic remarks on my inability I persisted in asserting the positiveness of  my agreement respecting my salary concerning which Macloughlin had the meanness to equivocate but I could only obtain an addition of four shillings per week Instead of directing or assisting me in my business as a prompter which he had engaged to do before I consented to undertake it he took every opportunity of venting his tenfold portion of spleen upon me  INCAPABLE of extricating myself I endured the mean insults of ignorance and malice for five months till the money which I had borrowed had been deducted from my stipend and then O'Dogherty immediately discharged me It would be no easy matter to describe what I felt at this moment I had not five shillings in the world was in a strange kingdom and had no means now that I was shut out from the theatre  of obtaining a subsistence I beheld nothing but misery and famine and imprecated curses on Macloughlin for the perfidiousness of his conduct toward  me Of this I was so sensible that though the severity of his manner had gained an entire ascendency over me I went to his house and with the utmost firmness after premising that I would rather starve than incur a fresh obligation from  him  displayed the impropriety and injustice with which he had treated and the shocking necessity to which he had reduced me in such animated terms that all his accustomed sternness fled and the Cynic stood abashed before the boy  THE money which had been deducted from my salary to discharge my debt was so considerable that I had not been able to pay my lodging I had  a bill against me there of between three and four pounds It is true there was another theatre open in Smockalley under the direction of Mossop but he was insolvent and none of his people were paid Here however as to a dernier resort did I apply and was engaged at the same nominal salary that I had had at Capelstreet  A FEW days after this event I was told by an acquaintance that a stranger had been making enquiries after me in a very circumstantial and particular manner and that he appeared much affected when he heard how I had been treated by O'Dogherty and Macloughlin The description of this stranger's person answered exactly to that of Mr Turnbull I received this intelligence at the theatre and when I returned home I found a letter directed to me and a ten pound  bank bill enclosed The contents informed me that the donor was an old friend who had a sincere regard for me and who if I persevered in my distress to preserve my principles did not doubt of seeing me on some future day as much favoured of fortune as I was at present persecuted by her The  character  of this epistle though purposely disguised confirmed me in the opinion that Turnbull was the old friend alluded to  THIS event called up a train of ideas of the most impassioned kind My former companions my patron's care conspicuous in its severity the friendship of Turnbull which now appeared even romantic for I could not place his journey to the account of business Mr Seldon having no connexions in Dublin added to the fond remembrance of Julia and contrasted with the forlorn  condition in which I then beheld myself gave me the most poignant sense of the alteration At one moment all possibility of future happiness vanished and at the next a gleam of hope beamed in the prophecy which the letter contained This while it left a kind of riddle in my imagination which I yet cannot tell how to solve fortified me in my former resolutions of preserving my integrity  IT soon appeared that there was no probability of being paid for my performance at Mossop's theatre I therefore very willingly quitted Dublin in March and went on board the packet for Parkgate resolving that if I must be miserable England should be the scene of my sufferings The wind was fair till we had lost sight of the hill of Hoath but presently after sunset a  hurricane came on which in this narrow and rocky sea put our lives in imminent danger Of this however the violence of the seasickness made me insensible We were drove during the storm considerably to the north and such was the ignorance of the master and his two or three superannuated mariners that he continued sailing northward having no knowledge of navigation but what he had gained by coasting between the two kingdoms This in the present conjuncture was of no use to him so that in all likelihood we should have made the tour of Greenland had not an intelligent Scotchman among the passengers known some of the headlands in his own country The blockhead of a master would have contested the point and proceeded to the land of bears had not the company perceived his stupidity and joined the North Briton who  with a degree of warmth expressive of his attachment to his bleak hills called out  What the de'el mon d'ye think I dinna ken the craig of Elsey  THIS extraordinary voyage kept us eight days without putting into any port except sending the boat on shore on the evening of the seventh at the Isle of Man to procure some provisions for the passengers who were almost starved having devoured the stock which is usually provided for these kind of voyages in a day or two after the storm had abated The reason why we were so very long in making our port was the extraordinary calm that had succeeded which the mariners who are the most superstitious of all human beings attributed to there being some Jonas on board This opinion they had inculcated among the poor devils who  pay half a crown for their passage in the hold who were as ignorant as themselves and far more mischievous Unhappily for me I was the person on whom their suspicions alighted the strongest They had discovered me to be a player a profession consigned over by the almost universal consent of mankind to the devil For what reason I could never yet discover This ridiculous belief however had nearly cost me my life The wild Irish in the hold were chiefly catholics and the sixth day from our departure happened to be Easter Sunday I had sauntered off the quarterdeck with a volume of Hudibras in my hand and walked to the other end of the vessel when I found myself encircled by two or three fellows with most ferocious countenances who were staring at me with looks expressive of loathing and revenge Most  of the passengers were at breakfast and nobody upon deck but these ragamuffins and a couple of the mariners who joined them The particularity of their manner attracted my notice and one of them asked me with his lips quivering with passion  If I had not better be getting a prayerbook than be radeing plays upon that blissed day  I perceived the fellows were inebriated and like a rash fool instead of soothing asked them if they imagined there was as much harm in  radeing  a play as in getting drunk and so early in the morning too  By the holy fadther  replied the spokesman  I know you You are the Jonas and by Jasus the ship will niver see land till you are tossed overboard you and your plays along wid you and sure it will be a grate dale better that such a wicked wretch as you  should go to the bottom than that all the poor innocent sowls in the ship should be lost  This speech entirely disconcerted me The resolute tone of the rascal and the approbation which his companions discovered were alarming I preserved fortitude sufficient to assure them it was not a playbook that I was reading and opened it to convince them while I edged away towards the quarterdeck which I gained almost in the same manner that a cat keeps curs at bay till she steals into her hole  I FEAR I tire you with these tedious accounts of myself you say not be it as it will I have taken the liberty of a friend and as you appear depressed with the peculiarity of your situation my intention is only that you may compare notes and see whether you  have hitherto been equally unfortunate I have little more to relate that is worth your hearing I arrived at Chester and resolved to write to such travelling companies as I could procure any intelligence of My knowledge of music my talents as a singer and my recent arrival from Dublin were recommendations that ensured me several engagements I chose one in a company that was then at Leeds in Yorkshire In this my ill stars were again predominant I found them in a state of anarchy despised by the town and quarrelling with one another their manager calling them all rascals and they returning the compliment Here I discovered too how necessary practice is to the player and that though some of them could scarce read they could all speak on the stage better than I could  IN less than three weeks the greater part of the people separated and no others coming to supply their places the company no longer existed A letter had followed me from Chester inviting me to join another sett then at Hereford but it had been wrote near a month it was a hundred and sixty miles across the country and I did not know if I set out whether I should find them there or if I did whether they might then stand in need of my assistance But my ten pound bill was by this time notwithstanding all my oeconomy reduced to eleven shillings and sixpence With a heavy heart then and a light purse did I begin another journey and on the fifth day of my peregrination entered an inn by the roadside which was eight and twenty miles from Hereford with the sum of ninepence in my pocket and made  my exit in the morning pennyless The fatigue of my journey and the penurious manner in which I had lived had so reduced my spirits that I found great difficulty in performing this last day's task upon an empty stomach but there was no remedy About four o'clock I ascended the hill that looks down upon this ancient city at sight of which a thousand anxieties took possession of my bosom The players might be gone and I unknown to every living creature had a spirit incapable of confessing the starving condition to which I was reduced I enquired of the first man I met with an emotion that it is impossible to describe if the comedians had left Hereford and leave you to imagine what I felt when he answered in the negative Faint weary and ready to drop with hunger I traversed the town to enquire for the manager but it was one  of the nights on which they did not perform and he was not to be found I was directed to his brother who was a barber in the city and upon their observing my weakness and desiring to know if I was not well I collected courage enough to tell them that I was greatly fatigued having come a long journey and for the last day not having broke my fast except at the brook I know not what kind of stuff some peoples hearts are made of but I know that notwithstanding this confession in the making of which I had done great violence to my feelings they heard it without offering me any assistance or even so much as testifying either surprize or pity and I quitted the house with the tears in my eyes  WHEN the players understood a fresh member was come to join them  they from sympathy soon discovered my disease and when I gave them the anecdote of the barber consigned him over to the devil in a most emphatical manner Little except common occurrences has happened to me since that time  I STAID with this company some time till a difference with the manager occasioned me to leave it I have since been only with Santlo and the one to which I have lately removed The smallest trifles that any way affect the fortunes of a friend I believe are heard with pleasure or anxiety and though I do not by any means think myself either the  only  or the  most  unfortunate person in the world I have offered these anecdotes of my life both to amuse and convince you that in appearance at least you have been far more happy  than I There is another motive you know how delighted I am with your correspondence Though you are not in arrear with respect to tale you are certainly deficient in weight I therefore hope you will communicate with the utmost freedom whatever futurity shall produce and if you are not already wearied I shall continue to trifle as occasion may offer Adieu  W HILKIRK  LETTER VIII Miss STAMFORD to Miss GOWLAND  My dear JULIA  HOW long shall I wish in vain for the pleasure of your company Your last letter gave me reason to hope for it a fortnight ago I have ever since been in expectation of seeing you and long to communicate the secrets of my bosom Oh my Julia I am very wretched I have lost my former chearfulness and can think of nothing but my misfortunes  I KNOW your tender and compassionate disposition will sympathize with me in deploring the effects of a passion that has taken possession of my unguarded heart Alas I knew not it  was love Under the specious disguise of friendship I have deceived myself and simply thought it in my power to limit my inclinations to esteem and regard Fatal experience has shewn the contrary I sigh for a happiness that every hour removes farther from me  I WILL now tell you all and if I am tedious you will excuse it It is some relief to communicate my sorrows by letter since your company is denied me  WHEN my father was young he was frequently employed on the Continent in transacting business on account of my grandfather On one of these occasions he went on board a ship up the Straits in which one captain Alwyn was a passenger for Gibraltar where his company then was They became  very intimate and their friendship was confirmed by an accident that happened during the voyage  IT was at that time war with France and the sailors spied a ship which they supposed to be a French man of war My father went up the ropeladders to look at it and unfortunately slipped into the sea where he must have perished if Alwyn had not instantly jumped after and sustained him by swimming till a boat could be sent to their assistance I have often heard my father mention with regret that he never saw him since they parted at Gibraltar he being slain in battle a few years afterwards  LONG after this calling on Messrs Brown and Co armyagents he there saw a lady of the name of Alwyn and  curiosity prompting him to make some enquiries he found she was the widow of his friend She had with her an only son whom she had brought to town from school to place in some business and my father happy in an opportunity of shewing his attachment as well as gratifying his own benevolent disposition begged she would leave to him the care of providing for her Harry for so he was called He was in consequence received into the countinghouse where till lately he has ever since remained  I WAS then at school where I have passed so many happy hours with my dear Miss Gowland Hours of peaceful enjoyment that never will return I had few opportunities of cultivating Mr Alwyn's acquaintance till I entirely quitted Mrs Carrington's when I found  him surprisingly grown and adorned with every quality that distinguishes the man of merit  HIS education had been of the first stamp to which he had added that polish which the finer accomplishments are sure to bestow where the understanding is good His temper and address were the most pleasing in the world and a consciousness of the obligations he owed my father seemed to shew itself in all his actions I do not know whether that consciousness made him diffident but I thought so and as well to second my father's good intentions as to shew my own sense of his merit I gave him every mark of esteem and friendship in my power  HE was made principal clerk about that time for which reason his attendance  was not so immediately required in the countinghouse My brother and he were therefore always together and very often would accompany me on the harpsichord Mr Alwyn had a turn for poetry which now and then appeared in a song these were always set by my musicmaster and formed a principal part of our entertainment I have several by me which I will shew you when we meet  BY these means we soon became on the most intimate terms of friendship and it was with great concern I observed his health decline for these six months past I did not suspect his love till he presented me with the following song which was so applicable to himself that it could not escape my observation  SONG  O love thou powerful pleasing pain  The heart that owns thy mighty sway  Shall ne'er recover peace again  But waste in sighs the chearful day  Can words describe my countless fears  While on the rack of doubt I lie  While doom'd to pass my time in tears  Condemn'd without complaint to die  Alas should love be mutual found  What num'rous obstacles arise  What great what various ills abound  To check the ardent tender ties  In vain I wish for lost repose  In vain would absence bring relief  Still love within my bosom glows  And death alone can calm my grief  I MUST confess the discovery gave me pleasure but I thought it best to make no alteration in my conduct towards him Little did I then think my regard for him was capable of occasioning  so much uneasiness in my bosom But his farewel when he went into the country for the recovery of his health was attended with a look in which despair and resignation were so blended that I was quite melted and was obliged to retire to conceal my tears  ALAS exclaimed I it is true that I love him and that he is unhappy Perhaps his fatal passion may prove the bane of all his hopes Perhaps the struggle between love and gratitude in a mind so truly susceptible of every noble feeling may overcome him and he may pine under the hated load of life But why  perhaps  the work is already begun Already his health and spirits are fled and he wanders in vain in search of peace  OPPRESSED with thoughts like these and convinced by absence how much I love him I find it impossible to conceal the alteration in my disposition I continue whole days in my chamber and avoid company under pretence of illness My brother I believe suspects the real cause for he found me the other morning in tears at my harpsichord singing the little song I have sent you I made some silly excuse which out of goodnature he accepted of without further enquiry  BUT the most afflicting circumstance is that my father is in treaty with a gentleman in the country to conclude a marriage between me and his son who is now in town expressly on that business If I did not feel myself too much prejudiced in favour of Mr Alwyn ever to love another I am sure  he  is very far from being the person I would pass my life with I do not believe it possible for him to be serious He is for ever on some whim or project as if he valued himself only in proportion to his capacity for promoting mischief and his want of delicacy is insufferable when I call to mind the tender and respectful attentions of poor Mr Alwyn  THINK my dear Julia on my situaation I am sure you'll pity me but it does not admit of advice If my father insists I must submit for I can never think of disobeying his commands yet I tremble at the thoughts of becoming Maitland's wifeOh my dear I am distracted with a croud of thoughts I beg you'll come to me and am  Your's most affectionately MARIA STAMFORD  LETTER IX Mr STAMFORD Jun to Mr ALWYN  Dear HARRY  I WROTE to you last week in answer to your's but have not since had the pleasure of a line from you Old Maitland's sending my father a proposal of marriage in the form of a mathematical problem is truly whimsical What is still more my father assures me that there is no joke at all meant by it but that he seriously intends to make himself understood If he intended quite the contrary I think he could not have adopted a better method  YOUNG Maitland is arrived  to try the experiment  as his father expresses it but Maria does not seem disposed to  exert her  attractive influence  She is constantly wrapt in thought and takes very little notice of him and he does not appear to care much about it He is one of those wild youths who though possessed of sense and understanding have too much vivacity to use them I am afraid Maria who is all meekness and delicacy will be very unhappy with him if the match succeeds and I see nothing at present to hinder it for she will never dispute her father's will and young Maitland seems as if he thought it no affair of his but leaves it to the management and direction of the old folks  I HAVE agreed to accompany him to Maitlandhall in a fortnight where I promise myself a vast fund of entertainment from the oddities of his father We should have set out sooner but  that it would be impolite to leave Miss Gowland who is now on a visit to my sister You have often heard Maria mention her They were at Mrs Carrington's boardingschool together and contracted a friendship which is founded in the most perfect union of disposition and sentiment  MISS Gowland is rather above the middle stature but perfectly wellshaped and genteel She cannot be called handsome but the  tout ensemble  of her countenance is so expressive of every amiable trait of disposition that it is impossible to behold her without esteem I think she differs from Maria in a kind of volatility that I cannot describe better than by comparing her to the Allegro and Maria to the Penseroso of Milton Each for the time claims the preference  Nec diversa tamen qualem decet esse sororum  BUT Maria's hopeless love may tend at present to heighten the opposition  FOR me I still continue heartwhole The destinies have not yet made a lover of me The only concern that engrosses my attention is the fate of my dear friend and poor Maria I know she will never love Maitland and in any case but the present I am sure my father would not oppose her inclination I never saw him so bent on any affair as on this and though old Maitland's letter had a great deal of frigidity in it it is only owing to his ridiculous attempt to bring every thing to the test of mathematical demonstration for they have both intended the match for some years The nature of their attachment you will judge from the following narration I had it from my  father one evening as we were conversing on this subject  BEING both in the same class at school the mutual assistance which they afforded each other in their studies was the first ground of particular intimacy Possessed of nearly the same dispositions and equally unacquainted with the world they spent their early youth among the heroes of antiquity and incited each other to emulate their virtues But they were chiefly enamoured with those pleasing descriptions of retirement and solitude with which the poets abound and from them formed the idea of a kind of life that seldom exists but in the imagination Instead of wishing to cut a figure in the world their desires were fixed on some peaceful retreat where their employment might be to tend their flocks  and repose on the verdant banks of a rivulet  Far from the busy world and all its cares  THESE ideas were still more enforced by the rural situation of the school which gave them an opportunity of forming grottoes and other poetical edifices and there was scarce a grove or stream in the neighbourhood that did not at one time or other afford them a subject for an ode  AFTER passing two years in this sweet delusion my father began to awake and consider himself as an inhabitant of this world but it was not so with Maitland He had indeed discovered that the Heathen mythology was a fiction for his master had not sense to put him into the rational way of studying it It was therefore no longer the  object of his attention yet with the poets afforded him a temporary amusement But his inquisitive disposition was now fully employed in the mathematics and natural philosophy in which at the time of his leaving the place he was so totally immersed that he came into the world with less real knowledge of it than a boy of ten years old brought up in the capital usually has  HIS father possessed of a considerable fortune acquired by his own industry was very desirous of putting his son in a line of employment that might tend to improve rather than diminish it and in consequence he was admitted on the firm of a very considerable house at Amsterdam where he remained till his father's death put  him in possession of the estate he now enjoys  MY father who came to town from school nearly at the same time as Maitland was immediately placed at the desk in my grandfather's countinghouse and by attention and assiduity rendered himself so useful that some years before his death he gave him a half share of the business  YOU do not know perhaps that at my grandfather's death an execution was laid in the house for as the affair was well settled it was always kept a profound secret however so it was Two ships from the Mediterranean that he had underwrote for a vast amount were taken and he not being able immediately to answer the demand was under the necessity of taking up a considerable  sum on bond and judgment In fact this loss had almost ruined him which the lender suspecting laid an execution as soon as he heard he was dead  THINK what a situation my father was then in Mourning for the death of a dearly loved parent yet obliged to apply all his attention to prevent the overthrow of a business which though lucrative he knew to be then insolvent What could he do He applied to Maitland for their friendship which as it had not remained uncultivated during this long interval did not require ceremony Maitland came immediately to town elated with the opportunity of serving him though he sympathized in his losses and not only advanced the sum but assisted him in other respects so considerably that it may almost be said  that my father is indebted to him for the large property he is now master of  SOON after this transaction my father married and received ten thousand pounds in cash with my mother besides the manor in Kent to which she was heiress  I OBSERVE and possibly you may too by this time that old Maitland from a very abstracted mode of thinking forms conclusions and adopts maxims which he never takes the trouble to compare with persons and things about him Whence it is that they are frequently inadequate and always singular  HE has read Locke with great attention and being convinced that demonstration is not confined to mathematical  subjects alone attempts to use it on all occasions witness the letter he sent my father which I scarce yet believe to be seriously written  BUT I wander from the point He has but one child this youth is just come from college and by what I can collect Maria was intended for him from her birth Unpleasing intelligence indeed for you yet from what has been related I cannot avoid being apprehensive of the consequences to one whom I should be as happy to serve as I am proud to call by the sacred name of friend  C STAMFORD  LETTER X Mr ALWYN to Mr STAMFORD Junior  Dear SIR  I WISH I could make you sensible how forcibly I feel your generous and disinterested friendship Your letter expresses an opinion of me which I fear I am not worthy of yet such is the human heart it attaches me so powerfully to you that I believe there is nothing so romantic which I would not undertake to prove my gratitude  YOUR account of Maria made my heart overflow I hope you are mistaken in the cause ofWhat do I sayIs that my wish Is there any thing on earth could give me so much delight as to be beloved by herWould it  not rather give me tortureIt would make her as miserable as myselfForbid it heavenLet me try to divert these reflections They oppress meI am convinced they do not give you pleasure  THE friendship of your father and Mr Maitland does them mutual honourIt would ill become me to disturb the happiness of a family to which I owe so many obligationsIt requires only a small degree of virtue to be ashamed of ingratitude  WE have not yet began to play our theatre will not be ready before Friday We are to open with Romeo and Juliet and I for my first appearance am to be the hero of the night A good mental physician would not I believe have prescribed so sweet a dose the studying  this character has not contributed to my recovery But I have undertaken it and must proceed My feelings are so similar to those put into the mouth of the young Montague that it must be strange if I mistake my part The company have formed great expectations of me I am told from hearing me rehearse and the manager who is a busy talkative person is puffing his performers among the town'speople and me among the rest As I shall perhaps endeavour to amuse you now and then with the adventures of the theatre it may not be unnecessary to inform you of the police and oeconomy of the society of which I am a temporary member that is as far as I myself have learned  A COMPANY of travelling comedians is a small kingdom of which the manager  is the monarch Their code of laws from the little reading I have had upon the subject seems to have existed with few material variations at or perhaps before the days of Shakespeare who is with great reason  the god of their idolatry  The person who is rich enough to furnish a wardrobe and scenes commences manager and has his privileges and restrictions The royal revenues are extensive being in the ratio of five to oneAs thusIf there are twenty persons in the company the manager included the receipt of the house after all incidental expences are deducted is divided into four and twenty shares four of which are called dead shares and taken by the manager as a payment for the use of his cloaths and scenes to these is added the share which he is entitled to as a performer  OUR monarch to resume my metaphor through the fecundity of the queen consort sweeps eleven shares into the royal pouch every night having five sons and daughters who are ranked as performers This is a continual subject of discontent to the rest of the comedians who are all to a man disaffected to the government For my part I do not think it worth while to be dissatisfied having it in my own option to submit to these laws or leave them for more equitable ones That is not the case with them they being all in debt to the manager and of course chained to his galley which he does not fail to inform them of when they are refractory They appear to be a sett of thoughtless merry beings who laugh in the midst of poverty and who never want a quotation or a story to recruit their spirits When they get any money  they seem like Russian boors in haste to spend it lest some tyrant in the shape of a dun should snatch it from themThey have a circuit or  sett of towns  to which they resort when the time comes round so that there are but three or four in the company who are not well known in Kendal The town'speople I observe are continually railing at them yet are very unhappy I am told if they fail to return at the appointed season It is a saying with the comedians that a player's sixpence does not equal a town'sman's groat and I find a great deal of truth in the apothegm therefore though these latter are continually abusing the poor players for running in debt they take good care to indemnify themselves and are no great losers if they get ten shillings in the pound  I SHALL continue my observations from time to time according to your desire and shall be much mistaken if they do not afford amusement to a mind like your's Permit me a concluding sigh for friends and a tear forI am ashamed of my weakness yet cannot overcome it at least not at the present  I am  Dear Sir  sincerely your's H H ALWYN  LETTER XI T STENTOR to JEMMY DRUMSHANDRUGH  Dear JEMMY  THERE is nothing but crosses and vexations and one damned thing or another to be met with in this worldOur landlady like a goodfornothing brim as she is stopt my box for thirteen and sevenpence at the last town so that I and my wife are arrived in Kendal without a property  A technical term among players and signifies the minutiae of dress  to play in My grey hairs and my wife's tie wig the coronet I wear in Lear with the George and garter for Richard Banquo's bloody throat that you painted on fleshcoloured callimanco my shirtshams and new Basil buskins never worn but one night in Mark Anthony  Mrs Stentor's tate her witch's highcrowned hat and Hecate's spectacles the boots and belt in which she plays John Moody together with the manager's Thunderbolt in Midas and my last new sett of teeth for which I paid half a guinea to our French dancing dentist the black stockings with spangled clocks that I wear in all my kings the remainder of my two dozen guineas that cost me tenpence to put in my stage purse and a thousand other things that I shall want every night all stoptI'm in a pretty pickle What the devil I shall do without my teeth I don't know for to mend the matter I lost my old ones that I made shift with in common on the road and I can't speak a word without lisping worse than if I had belonged to the tribe of Ephraim and was ordered to say shibboleth at the pass of Jordan by the cruel bastard of Gilead  MISFORTUNES never come alone I have seen the day when our manager durst not have refused to lend me thirteen and sevenpence if I wanted it but he says I am no longer fit to play the lovesick heroes so has engaged one Alwyn that nobody except Hilkirk knows any thing ofIt's dd strange if I can't play them better than that youngster I that have been the representative of all the heroes ancient and modern for almost these fifty years and this is his first appearance he says though I'll swear he's a stager of five years standing at least by the manner of his rehearsing Nay and because he is in possession of a smooth face and a soft voice its a guinea to a shilling that all the young flirts fall in love with himHe has made choice of Romeo my favourite character above all others to appear in I wish he may break his neckHowever if he  stays  I'll  go  if I canI wish you  would try to get an engagement for me and my wife with your managerI have enclosed our casts  Meaning the parts they were accustomed to play  My wife plays the queen's is an excellent termagant and goes into breeches We neither of us clash with you except that my wife plays John Moody and she is allowed to be so excellent in that part that if the great London SHUTER or PARSONS that we hear so much of were to come down she would not give it up  I HAVE been interrupted in my letter by that AlwynI don't know what scheme he is at but he has been here with an oiled tongue and  a hope that he did not offend me but hearing I was a little distressed for a trifle he came to offer me his assistance  When he had finished his preface he put a  guinea into my handAs he made his exit he  begged a thousand pardons and hoped I would excuse the abruptness that his want of being better acquainted with me had forced him upon but that he could not bear to hear of age being wedded to necessity  NOTWITHSTANDING this fine rhetorical flourish I am devilishly deceived if I don't see through this generosity Men don't give their money away so freely without some view Perhaps he meant it as a bribe that I may patiently submit to see him rob me of all my characters Had he  lent  it me I should have suspected Santlo the manager to have been at the bottom of all this but he would not  give  a guinea to save his mother's soul from purgatory so it can't be himMy young politician  shall find however I am not to be so easily bribed If he mines I'll countermine and its a question if the young cub digs so deep as the old fox He shall be well earthed if I don't unkennel himI have provided a party that shall hiss worse than the head of Gorgon Staunch friends that won't easily see the veteran vanquished  GIVE our respects to your manager and if he will agree to our playing those parts which are here subjoined and will send three guineas and a half two of which I owe to Santlo and the rest we shall want for our journey we will join him immediately Let him know how useful my wife isShe is excellent in the old statesmen and looks them admirablyNot that we are exceedingly anxious about the matter We make no doubt of being able by  one means or other to rout this whipster this Alwyn  OUR compliments to all old friends and let me know how you share  i e What money they get  It may be necessary to inform the reader that we have not annexed the list of parts mentioned in the above letter from a supposition that mere names though all the mankillers from Agamemnon to Marlborough were enumerated would afford but small amusement We will acknowledge that a species of the ridiculous ran along the list occasioned by the avidity with which this veteran appropriated the representation of all the great virtues and vices of the heroes of every country young or old Christian or Heathen Jew Turk or Infidel to himself Mrs Truncheon Stentor seemed no less capable and ambitious To confess a truth when we beheld along the lady's list of characters Queen Margaret in one line Lord Burleigh in the next and Hecate in a third we began to be in doubt either of the lady's gender or the genuineness of the letter especially when we read the following remark  "In the Provoked Husband though John Moody is my wife's favourite part yet she can play Lady Townly if wanted but then she chuses to double them"  which means according to our interpreter to play them both on one nightHow useful would such a lady as this be in a London theatre where the great actresses are so liable to colds and have such tender and delicate constitutions that a bad box book deprives them more effectually of the use of speech than a stroke of the palsy would  and whether your manager ever shews his bookOur precious rascal immures his more carefully than the Romans did the Sybil's prophecy Your's  TRUNCHEON STENTOR  LETTER XII JEMMY DRUMSHANDRUGH to T STENTOR  Friend

this Mr Pot the taylor who has tipled out of my pot many a frosty morning threatens to arrist me if I don't pay him for the suit of cloaths that I had of him about five years agoe and for all I tould him I could not pay ivery body and keep a little for my own use and thin you know as he always said he was my frind why I niver thought any thing about paying him at  all at allSorra the frindship that I can find out in linding a man a guinea and desiring one and twenty shillings in change Howiver my landlady long life to the dare crater whose husband has had a stroke of the palsy about five weeks agoe that has taken away the use of his limbs promises to lind me the money She is a good hearty woman about my own age with a dale of rich thick blood in her vanes and has had a child she tells me every year since she has been married She is very industrious and has gone through a dale of trouble she says She took hould of my hand and prest it so tinderly and let the salt tares fall on it while she tould me of her poor husband's misfortune who she says before that accident was an honest painstaking man and so I am become a mighty favourite with her and she never lets the maid come up now to make  my bed but makes it always with her own hands and ginerally comes before breakfast as she says it gets her a stomach and likewise brings the warmingpan of a night to warm it becase she says it makes one sleep will thin she trates me with oysters whin she can get 'em to my supper and an egg to my tay of a morning after the good ould Irish fashion and so as I tould you I am become a mighty favourite with her  As for your coming to this company d'ye see why our manager says it won't do for why we play all the hairos between us oursilves and now that I spake good English and have got rid of my brogue I do Lord Townly instead of John Moody and make nothing of it But if I should lave the company why then there will be an opening for you which I shall certainly do whin my  landlady's husband dies becase why there will be an opening then for me She has a pretty income enough and the poor woman is mightily grieved to see her husband in his misery and so as she tells me she prays viry devoutly for the poor craters dith to be sure she makes me love her the better becase she is so tinder hearted  As for our sharing why I don't hear of any body among us that intinds to build churches and rispicting the stock book and your manager's being a rascal why I don't wonder much at that becase why I niver knew one of them that was not a rascal and I niver heard but of one neither did I believe that not but we have pritty full houses and that the people may have enough for their money d'ye see why there is  plenty of singing and dancing ivery night after the performance is over Mrs Stentor is a viry useful woman to be sure and just such a one as we want so if you think it worth while to live fashionably and niver see one another why our manager says he will engage her with all his heart d'ye see now and thin this is likely to be a good town for why the parson praches against the players ivery Sunday and as he is not mightily beloved why they are resolved not to mind what he says and so if you like of it why let her set off before you resave this becase as why the sooner she comes the longer it will be before we see herAnd so give me lave to conclude yourself my friend to command  J DRUMSHANDRUGH  LETTER XIII Mr MAITLAND Jun to STAFFORD OSBORNE Esq  Dear OSBORNE  THIS day week I left the sober family of the Stamfords and am now safely landed at Maitlandhall I was like a fish out of water during my stay in London Settled in as pretty a demure churchgoing family as you'd wish to see and what's more on the footing of a suitor to the young lady Now there are two things you expect one that I shall reform in a hurry and the other that I shall give you a sketch of the queer creatures I have been shut up with for this fortnight but you are confoundedly mistaken if you think I'll take the pains to do either the one or  the other I have not been out later than ten since my arrival in town and was so lost for want of a frolick that I was reduced to the necessity of having one on the road I wish you had been there for I had it all to myselfbut you shall hear  YOUNG Stamford and I left London on Tuesday morning attended by our servants on horseback My man Sam of whose dexterity and address you have seen proofs before now was with me and we arrived at M in the evening just as the passengers were alighting from the stagecoach I stood at the inndoor while they were unpacking their carcases from the close stowage of the vehicle and fancied from their appearance that they were a sett of characters that might afford some diversion In consequence of this supposition I  proposed to Stamford to sup with the passengers which was agreed to Sam went to reconnoitre the inn and I applied myself to learn the dispositions of our fellowtravellers  THE company was compounded of a short fat man about forty with a cut of countenance not very inviting for arrogance and selfconceit were painted in every line of it His wig was of the construction that custom or some other cause has rendered one of the attributes of holiness and a blue grey suit of cloaths of a most stiff and formal outline put it out of doubt that he was a son of mother church I afterwards found he was a country schoolmaster who had been to London to procure scholars whom he found in all requisites for ten pounds a year Opposite him sat a figure whose calling and occupation were not so much  within the reach of conjecture Deceit seemed to be the very essence of his composition I never saw a man that so immediately inspired me with aversion His aspect was like that of a mischievous animal that surveys you with fear but with a fear mixed with an intention of hurting you as soon as off your guard His hair was lank and grey his person tall and aukward and his visage pale hollow and illuminated with a pair of small sunken eyes that might have given rise to the fictions of witchery and incantations performed by an evil sight A sett of habiliments put together in a very peculiar style would have tempted me to pronounce him an apothecary of the last century if a pair of dirty bands had not indicated that his province was that of a  spiritual  manmidwife He professed to believe the new birth and was himself a living proof of his doctrine  for without a metaphor it was necessary for a man to be born again to  become like  him  NEAR him sat a couple of females who seemed to be mother and daughter The mother I soon discovered to be a disciple of the respectable pastor I have just described but the daughter a fresh girl about sixteen did not seem to have much of the devotee about her  THE remaining passenger was a young fellow in regimentals who was standing by a window with his back to the company when I entered He came up to me and after common compliments we entered into conversation without regarding the others of whose social powers I had already entertained a very contemptible opinion He acquainted me that he was an ensign in the th  regiment was going to head a recruiting party at Bristol and at the same time gave me a sketch of the characters of his companions as I have just now hinted  WHEN supper was brought in the Methodist rose up and inclining himself forward not in the graceful attitude of an orator but rather in that of a person labouring under the operation of an emetic treated us with a grace of a quarter of an hour's duration The schoolmaster appeared somewhat chagrined whether on account of the usurpation of his office as chaplain or the  venter famelicus qui aures non habet  or both I shall not pretend to say but I observed during the course of the evening that he and the Methodist were irreconcileable enemies to each other  AFTER supper and the circulation of a glass or two he arose to put in practice the same manoeuvre but was opposed by the schoolmaster who objected to it as not only unnecessary but pharisaical This produced a warm altercation in which the Methodist had manifestly the advantage for being well read in scripture he undertook with great calmness to prove that the schoolmaster was a limb of the whore of Babylon whereat the other was so enraged that he lost all power of utterance and stood gasping like a cat in an airpump  WE joined the Methodist who proceeded in his quotations without regarding the mighty rage of his antagonist and by that means put him into so good a humour that at the request of the old lady he consented to give us  an exhortation For which and its consequences you must wait till next post for at present I'm quite tired  Your's c T MAITLAND  LETTER XIV Mr MAITLAND Jun to STAFFORD OSBORNE  Dear OSBORNE  I WROTE to you last post an account of my arrival here and promised to let you know the sequel of my road adventures which without further preamble I here continue  THE Methodist had planted himself on his knees in a great arm chair and was raving on in his exhortation while I was cursing my stupid brains that had not yet hinted any propable scheme of diversion though with such admirable subjects to practise on "Who" said he  was St Paul Did he ride in a coach No Was he a bishop No Did he preach in a great church No No No It was in the fields  my brethren He cast out devils and healed the sick I once knew a poor woman at Bristola very poor womanbut rich in faithand she had experiencesand was in a good wayand she sought after us that teach the true wayand the devil cameand she saw himand he appeared unto hereven the roaring lion and he roaredand she ran out of the house and came to meand she wept bitterlyand I said unto the devil    AT this instant Sam and Stamford's servant each with an extinguisher put out the candles and the devil stood confessed to the view of the affrighted preacher He did not stop to recognize his Bristol acquaintance but oversetting the chair made his escape up the chimney The ladies screamed horribly and the officer drew his sword  and made a pass at Mons le Diable but finding it had no effect exclaimed "Lord have mercy on my poor soul" threw down his sword and in endeavouring to remove himself farther from the object of terror overset the table with the bottles and glasses that were on it Stamford and I were not a little startled at the presence of so unexpected a visitant though we soon discovered it to be the effect of a magic lanthorn which it afterwards appeared Sam had borrowed of a Jew who was then in the taproom of the inn  DIRECTED by the rays of light I perceived the instrument standing on the chimneypiece which was the occasion of this phaenomenon and removed it time enough to prevent a discovery The servants immediately came in with lights and with some difficulty got the Methodist down the chimney  Our schoolmaster having left the room previous to the exhortation escaped his part of the fright but the share he had in an adventure which followed left him no great cause for boasting  WORDS cannot describe the figure the poor devil of a Methodist cut when extracted from his sooty hidingplace The natural hollowness of his visage was augmented by certain lights and shades acquired during his residence in the chimney and a ghastly and idiot stare the remaining fright had left on his countenance He looked round the room with a sort of timid caution that demonstrated how unwelcome a return of the apparition would be and it was long before he could recollect any of his fellowtravellers The ladies bore it very well all things considered and the officer was particularly serious on the  occasion while Stamford looked at me with enquiring eyes and I gave Sam credit for the whole contrivance  'TWAS in vain to think of sitting down again as a company and therefore I called Sam to shew me the bedrooms which were on the same floor opening every one into a long gallery that faced the courtyard  THE suite of rooms consisted of four in each of which were two beds The old lady and her daughter took possession of one Stamford and I another and the schoolmaster entering a third was followed by the Methodist whose fears of another visit from the prince of darkness had impelled him to make sure of a companion The officer of course had the remaining chamber to himself  WHEN Stamford and I were alone we interrogated Sam about the trick he had played on the apostle and received intelligence that another plot was in agitation to prevent their oversleeping themselves Stamford objected to it as cruel and thought it might possibly hurt their understandings but I overruled it and about midnight he began his operations  THEN it was that the clattering noise of some quadrupede animal was heard in the gallery which seemed to shake with the burthen Our preacher discovered by an ejaculation or two that his afflictions had kept him waking but his companion manifested no other signs of life than a profound nasal trumpeting which at a distance might have been mistaken for a couple of sawyers at work  THE Methodist was not long in suspence for the sound of hoofs approached his chamber the door of which flew open and admitted the cause of his apprehensions who addressed him in these words  O thou sinful wretch deceiver of the simple calumniator of the good and liar to the community thy time is accomplished and I thy evil genius am come to convey thee to the gloomy mansions of despair I appear unto thee in the shape of an ass because thou art an ass and command thee to arise and mount on my back which if thou delayest to perform I will tear thee instantly to pieces  At this threat I heard the frighted wretch get out of bed sighing and groaning and the instant after roaring with all his might The apparition on whose back he had mounted began to bray and issued out of the  room with great impetuosity nor stopped till they arrived at the stairshead whence down they both tumbled together  ALARMED at this circumstance Stamford and I hurried after them and found the preacher lying on the ground alone in his shirt Lifting him up we perceived he had sustained no other injury than a few bruises and the fright which had made him almost stupid We conveyed him to bed in the room where the officer had been and ordered a servant to stay with him while we went to enquire into the particulars of the adventure from the schoolmaster  THE knight of the ferula was covered over head and ears in bed where he had lain during the whole confusion not having had courage to rise A violent perspiration had wetted the bedcloaths almost through and on his peeping  forth our noses were informed that solids as well as fluids had escaped him in his fright He was so much cheared at our appearance that he found utterance for his surprise which thus broke forth and mingled with the potent effluvia  OH gentlemen little did I think when I left my native country and ventured up to London that I should have joined in the society of the children of darkness That fanatical wretch who with these eyes I saw riding to hell on the back of a fiery jackass has given me such a shock as I fear I shall never recover Alas even now I perceive my intestines are relaxed and the contents of the viscera are here and there dispersed in the bed I am become as lank and flaccid as a half blown bladder My nervous system is destroyed and I question if my members will ever  regain their proper tone Lend your kind assistance that I may rise and get some refreshment Nature abhors a vacuum and my poor bowels approach but too near to that state  WE could not refuse our help but on raising him up the fumes of the egesta here and there dispersed as he expressed it became so powerful that we let him down again and covered him up advising him to wait till we sent a servant with linen and other requisites to enable him to appear as became a man of his consequence  GOING down into the hall we found every body in the inn dressed and in full conversation on the event that had disturbed their repose Various were the conjectures formed on the occasion for the parties concerned being absent no authentic intelligence could be gained  This continued till the arrival of the schoolmaster who entered tolerably cleansed and immediately fortified himself with a bumper of brandy After which he proceeded to tell us that being in his first sleep he was suddenly roused by a dreadful voice that exclaimed  I am thy evil genius  on which he immediately started up and drawing his curtain perceived the room was filled with a blue sulphureous flame in the midst of which appeared a spectre larger than an elephant with fiery horns but in the shape of a jackass That the Methodist got out of bed howling and weeping and mounted on the back of the hobgoblin which after diverse frisks and nefarious gambols roaring in the mean time most dreadfully on a sudden vanished in a flash of lightning In consequence of which and the intolerable stench of brimstone he the narrator  was compelled to evacuate the whole quantity of aliment then in his body which shot forth neither more nor less than as if exploded from a windgun That moreover he lay in a trance f  om that instant till the coming of the two gentlemen into the room and concluded with assuring the company that he had no doubt but that horrid wretch the Methodist was now receiving the reward of his misdeeds  IN the morning I visited our AntiMahomet who had almost rode to hell instead of heaven on an ass and to my great surprize found him sitting by a table with a leathern inkhorn in his hand and writing After enquiring about his health and expressing my admiration at the extraordinary occurrences of the last twelve hours I begged he would if possible explain the cause of those appearances  "Last night" said he  after the visitation of the Evil One I sat on my bed ruminating with inward anguish and manifold groanings of the spirit on my backslidings It is written 'Resist the devil and he will flee from you' Instead whereof I retired with some haste and gave place to the adversary Oh wretched man for this cause it was permitted unto him to scourge thee even with whips of scorpions While I thus wrestled with the corruptions of my heart lo it thundered the bed trembled beneath me and one of the angels of perdition stood in my sight He had one eye that glittered like the moon his nostrils resembled a glowing oven and from his posteriors came forth flashes of lightening At first I was frightened which the devil perceiving snatched  me up in his claws and carried me through the air with amazing swiftness but I soon recollected myself and compelled him by the force of my adjurations not only to set me down but also to disclose many secrets of the invisible world which I intend to publish under the title of 'News from Tophet' being a relation of the extraordinary dealings of the spirit with John Wisely and also of sundry buffetings of Satan sustained by him in his ministry Necessary to be read as a warning in these later days of iniquity Recommended by the Reverend Mr Filcher Sir Rueland Howl will give it a good word in one of his sermons and without doubt it will be purchased in great numbers by the children of grace at the door of the tabernacle Whence it shall come to pass that  the truth will prevail mightily and great gain shall arise therefrom Moreover it would cause me to rejoice in spirit to behold your name in the list of my subscribers  THOUGH this narration was a masterpiece of lies and hypocrisy and though I knew his publication would be a shameful imposition on the credulous multitude yet I could not forbear noticing his last request by slipping a couple of guineas into his hand This unexpected benevolence surprized him so much that he was at a loss to express his acknowledgments He assured me that his heart leaped within him at the prospect of my approaching conversion and that I might depend upon it that this money was the best I had ever laid out in my life as it had purchased me the reversion of a seat among the celestials  I thanked him for the cheap bargain he had let me have and left him to the compilation of his pamphlet  SOON after which we mounted our horses and arrived at Maitlandhall by the evening  THE whole of the aforesaid dreadful adventure consisted of nothing more than Sam's driving an ass into the preacher's room behind which he stood and in a feigned voice uttered the threats that obliged him to mount the creature which carried him down stairs out of its own mere motion and private judgment The thunder was the ninepin bowl trundled across the room and the lightening was manufactured from a pennyworth of rosin and the end of a candle stuck in a tobaccopipe and blown into the room at proper intervals  by Stamford's man Sam's assistant The other embellishments proceeded entirely from the active imaginations of the relators  I DARE say you think it strange that I have wrote two letters without mentioning my marriage that is to be Miss Stamford is a remarkably beautiful girl but was either indisposed during my stay or wants that vivacity that is so particularly engaging in her sex But she has sense and judgment and will do well enough for a wife  MY father still continues his researches We are as mathematical as ever  I remain  Dear OSBORNE  Your's c T MAITLAND  LETTER XV Mr ALWYN to Mr STAMFORD Jun  Dear Sir  MY little anxieties which rose in spite of me every time I recollected the facing of an audience are in a great measure removed I have played and met with more applause than it was possible I could deserve Appearances at first indeed were not so favourable the moment I went upon the stage I was saluted from a corner of the gallery with a piercing hiss It is impossible to describe my feelings when I heard it and had not the greater and the more indulgent part of the spectators immediately overpowered this mark of disapprobation I should certainly have been obliged to retire or have sunk to the floor my trepedation was so great I  felt ten thousand aukwardnesses the moisture departed from my mouth my knees knocked together my lips quivered my throat became parched my heart fluttered and a qualmish sickness seized me What gave me courage sufficient to proceed was the behaviour of a young gentleman of rank and fortune in this place whose name was Westwood Immediately when the hiss began he jumped up from his seat in the pit for we have no boxes here and as soon as he could be heard reproached the dissatisfied aloud in a very spirited and pointed manner and offered ten pounds to any man who would secure the next person that interrupted me then addressing himself to me said  Bravo Mr Alwyn take a little time recollect yourself Sir and let me hear who dares insult you again damn me if I  don't go up and twist the first fellow's neck round that attempts it  THIS apostrophe was the best cordial that could be administered My powers returned enough to enable me to make a very respectful bow to the audience and to young 'Squire Westwood in particular which was answered by the spectators with the loudest marks of approbation three times repeated and I heard several commendations on my person and deportment before the house was quiet sufficiently for me to proceed which gave me great encouragement  I SHOULD perhaps be vain upon the fame I acquired and the plaudits I afterwards received were it possible for me to enjoy pleasure and were I not conscious that a vast deal if not all of these favours may be placed to the account of  goodnature and the patronage of Mr Westwood who is universally beloved After I had finished my part most of the people in the pit left the house and did not stay to see the farce which was played to the gallery Several of the principal gentlemen came behind the scenes and insisted upon my going to supper with them but as they were in different parties that they might not embarrass me and out of respect and gratitude to the behaviour of my young spirited patron they permitted me to go with him each laying me under the injunction of a visit in turn I received likewise an invitation to their assembly on Thursday next at which I perceived my brother comedians were a good deal chagrined for as I have since learnt one of them no longer ago than the last time that they were here was insulted for attempting to join with the gentry in  this amusement and the comedian being a man of spirit had his opponents been as valiant singly as they were conjointly the affair might have been an unhappy one I am not therefore determined at present what measures I shall pursue in this business  I AM informed that the hissing that was heard on my appearance was the effect of a party raised against me by the chicanery and malice of a Mr Truncheon Stentor the person who used to play the character of Romeo previous to my arrival in the company and who they say notwithstanding that he is become old and decrepit is most tenaciously fond of appearing in youthful characters I however do not believe this report but attribute it to the detraction of the actors who I perceive circulate a thousand little mean anecdotes  which place their brethren in ridiculous or unfavourable attitudes Stentor instead of seeming envious attended me during every rehearsal told me the entrances and exits instructed me in several stage manoeuvres that were not only very serviceable but absolutely essential to me stood behind the scenes gave me the greatest encouragement at first and encomiums afterwards in short instead of manifesting the least rancour or illnature afforded me every assistance in his power and was exceedingly pleased with my success I therefore suppose my own embarrassment and aukwardness which perhaps I was too sensible of shewed me to a disadvantage and some who wished to pass for critics hissed more to prove their judgment than out of any malevolence to me to whom it was impossible they should have conceived any  personal disgust and who it is not probable were to be influenced to any such meanness as the supposition contains  I WAS received by the parents of Mr Westwood who were not at the play with an affability that has given me a high idea of their superiority and goodness for indeed I know no title to superiority but what is derived from goodness He is their only child and the reciprocal delight which they afford to each other is very apparent and pleasing they live upon the most friendly terms among the gentry of Kendal several therefore who heard that I supped here came in with the utmost familiarity and behaved to me in such a manner as could not fail to give me pleasure Mr Westwood and some of his friends are great admirers of music After supper we had a little concert in  which I assisted alternately on the violin the flute and as a vocal performer They have no elevated ideas of taste and appeared astonished at the specimens I afforded them Music indeed is so much my delight that if it were possible I should excel in any thing I believe it would be in that but however great the natural abilities of the people who were present might be yet as they have no opportunities of hearing good performers I do not so much wonder at their surprize It is in vain dear Charles that I endeavour to be chearful I cannot remember the name of happiness without recollecting your sister Maria and Maitland haunt my imagination Tell me Charles will not his wild and excentric temper be very opposite to the mildness of my poor Maria Tell me if you think she can be happy with him I am afraid not  I fear those extravagant sallies into which his ungovernable fancy hurries him will alarm her delicate mind with continual inquietudes Yet why should I fear He must be insensibility itself if he could bear to give such an angel pain Oh my friend how blest beyond all possibility of increase must the man be who calls Maria his But who is he that can say with justice he deserves such a blessing What are riches honours titles or power Can they afford the happiness that may be found in the conversation the smiles the tender attentions of the lovely Maria My only consolation is that I can never merit her I shall never behold him who can Where is there in all the works of nature an object so perfect as a beauteous female when her passions are in unison with her features Such is Maria  Around the spacious landscape rove  The Naiads haunt the Triton's bed  Search every grot and every grove  Where art and nature beauties shed  Whate'er is rich whate'er is rare  Whate'er is worthiest to be known  Collect from sea and earth and air  From fossil plant or precious stone  While wonders then with wonders vie  And latent miracles dispense  While this attracts the raptur'd eye  And that allures the ravish'd sense  Attentive while the busy sage  Delighted marks the boundless store  Exulting swells the learned page  With secrets unobserv'd before  O come in all thy native grace  Maria come and bless the view  And every former beauteous trace  Shall vanish like the morning dew  Adieu my friend H H ALWYN  LETTER XVI Mr STAMFORD Jun to Mr ALWYN  Dear HARRY  MAITLAND and I arrived here on Tuesday night and though I cannot say without any adventures on the road yet without any worth relating in a letter Old Mr Maitland received us with a chearful welcome that prepossessed me in his favour and has walked with me this morning over his farm He is very different from the sort of character I had previously formed in my mind Not at all morose or dogmatical but on the contrary chearful and entertaining his fancy stored with the beauties of the classic writers has shewn itself in the environs of his house It is situated in a vale that  might vie with the celebrated TempÃ© At some little distance runs a river whose craggy and romantic banks engage the attention while the fossils in its bed afford an endless fund of amusement for the naturalist To the north on a rising hill stands an elegant temple on eight Corinthian columns of variegated marble This is his observatory and is well furnished with instruments by the most capital makers The view from hence is pleasing beyond description Several natural openings in the groves which surround the house discover a variety of prospects each of which has its peculiar beauties and grottoes alcoves with other little edifices dispersed here and there conspire to lull the imagination into a delightful tranquillity  Here could I ever stray while the wrapt mind  Recalls the long lost tale of many a hero  Or many a sage who from the mountain top  Unwearied watches Cynthia's silver course  When nightly from the east slow rising she  Illumes the azure heav'n with soften'd light  As we walked together through these pleasant scenes our conversation turned on a variety of subjects but all of the literate kind He was pleased to observe I had a taste for the sciences and I on the other hand was surprized at the refined judgment he displayed in matters of imagination having expected to find him immersed in mathematical speculations He certainly abstracts too much and expects to attain a state of knowledge beyond what our faculties are capable of The objects of taste says he it must be allowed constitute in themselves the nobler exercises of the soul the philosophy of the passions is worthy the attention of mankind the source the ultimate basis of morality  is of the last consequence to society and well deserves to be enquired intoBut we lose ourselves in conjecture instead of seeking for demonstration Would not you smile Mr Stamford at the sage who to explain the  motion  of a planet should say it proceeded from a  motive  faculty instead of investigating the respective momenta and directions of the projectile and centripetal forces Is not certainty in the lower steps of science an acquisition more to be prized than the declamations of prejudice or the endless maze of proofs founded on hypothesis Nay rather ought we not first to make ourselves perfect in the rudiments of knowledge before we pry into the arcana of the more subtle motions of intellectual substances Demonstration is not confined to quantity alone Ideas of the great and beautiful in nature in sentiment in ethics and  in all the branches of the sentient faculty are as perfect as those of quantity and their congruity with each other as perceptible By the immediate application of two ideas an axiom may be formed Definitions of terms should be premised and by the intervention of a chain of immediately concordant ideas we might connect the proposition and consequence Whence demonstration would be accomplished and a man would no more doubt the beauty order or moral fitness of a wellgrounded assertion than the truth of a theorem in Euclid  YOU will perceive the turn of his mind by this specimen The same mode of thinking accompanies him in his other pursuits He is constantly employed in some research either in the intellectual or material world and  his faculty of drawing conclusions from experiments is admirable though it sometimes subjects him to errors of which his son seldom fails to take advantage he being possessed of capital talents for placing every object in the most ludicrous attitude The country people are of opinion that the old gentleman can conjure and say that the little temple on the hill was built nobody knows how but the parish clerk who pretends to be very wise says it was done by geometry all in one night Mr Maitland is too rich to be a wizard but I am informed that an old woman who lives in a hut on the verge of his farm has the reputation of doing all the mischiefs that they are pleased to ascribe to supernatural agents This report is the more confirmed by several visits he has lately  made her doubtless with a view of relieving her necessities  HIS house is of a moderate size and elegantly finished in the modern stile The  simplex munditiis  is seen in every part of it unless I may except certain apartments which are consecrated to philosophical uses He has a variety of the best apparatus which according to the tenor of his prevailing study is dispersed on stands and tables appropriated for its reception I promise myself much amusement from hence when the weather confines me at home but am too great an admirer of the more obvious phaenomena of nature to stay within when I can enjoy myself in the open air  YOUNG Maitland makes the most of his time in hunting or shooting We see  very little of him except when he has the complaisance to assist at some philosophical research in doing which he is so ingenious at finding means to exercise his risible faculty that I wonder at his father's patienceA propos of this youth he is no favourite with my father and still less with Maria I am convinced if the intended match takes place it will be more out of regard to his promise and the steps he has taken in the affair than to any wish he has to proceed  I am Dear Harry your's sincerely C STAMFORD  END OF VOL I
