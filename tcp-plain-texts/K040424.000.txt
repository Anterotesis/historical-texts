down by the Board of Agriculture we have endeavoured to be as concise as possible except in those articles which are in a great measure peculiar to this district some of which we have reason to think may be adopted with advantage in others  It is scarcely possible in an undertaking of this kind to describe all the minutiae of practice or to notice every local improvement but we hope that the most prominent features of the Agriculture of Northum∣berland as existing in    will be found faith∣fully recorded in the following sheets  As weights and measures vary in different dis∣tricts we think it right to apprize our readers that in the following Reports of Northumberland and Cumberland  An Acre is the statute Acre of    square yards  A Bushel= gallons Winchester  A Rood= yards in length  A Fother=a two horse cartload of lime dung c  A Stone of Wool=lb Avoirdupoise  A Stone of every other article=lb ditto  In the Report of Westmoreland the customary acre is generally meant which contains square yards or    A    R  ½  P statute measure  It may also be proper to explain the following pro∣vincial terms  A Hog is a name given to young sheep from months old till they are shorn  A Gimmer an Ewe sheep from the first to the second shearing  A Dinmont a Wether sheep from the first to the second shearing  A Queyan Heiser  A Steera three years old Ox  Kyloes a small breed of Cattle bred in

CIRCUMSTANCES  SECTION  Situation and Extent  THE district included in this Survey is the whole of the county of Northumberland and those detached parts of the county of Durham called Norhamshire Island∣shire and Bedlingtonshire  IT IS BOUNDED  On the East by the German ocean  miles  West by Roxburghshire and Cumberland      North by Berwickshire    South by the county of Durham    Making the whole circumference  miles  It is situated between the latitude of deg min and deg min north and longitudes of deg min and deg min west from London its great∣est length from north to south is miles and breadth and contains square miles which may be divided into lands that are or may be cultivated by the plough  Acres  And mountainous districts improper for tillage    Making in the whole    SECT  Division  The county of Northumberland is divided into six Wardsviz Tindale Ward Coquetdale Ward Glen∣dale Ward Bamborough Ward Morpeth Ward and Castle WardThe three first are situated in the wes∣tern part of the county and include the whole of the mountainous district with a considerable portion of in∣closed cultivated countryThe three latter adjoin the sea coast and being exempt from mountainous district have been long under cultivation the vast resources of coal Castle Ward in particular possesses and the increased population the coal trade occasions give them a decided preference in point of riches and population tho' in point of magnitude considerably the smallest occupying less than one fourth of the county  Norhamshire  and  Islandshire  are situated at the northern extremity of the county of Northumberland and com∣prehend a triangular space the two sides of which are formed by the River Tweed and German Ocean and the base the northern boundary of Glendale and Bambro' Ward it contains about square miles of wellinclo∣sed cultivated country  Bedlingtonshire  is situated at the southeast corner of Castle Ward bounded on the east by the German Ocean and on the north and south by the rivers Wansbeck and Blyth and contains about square miles  SECT  Climate  The Climate  in regard to temperature is subject to great variation upon the mountains snow will often continue for several months and may frequently be seen there of a considerable depth when there is none in the lower districts The weather is very inconstant but most∣ly  runs in extremes In the Spring months the cold piercing easterly winds are most prevalent and our longest droughts are always accompanied by them in some places they have acquired the name of  seapines  from the slow progress vegetation makes whenever they con∣tinue for a few weeks Rain is of little use while they prevail from the great cold which always attends them  The mild western and southern breezes rarely take place before June they are certain harbingers of rain and vigorous vegetation and are the most prevailing winds through the Summer and Autumn In the latter season they often blow with tempestuous fury dash out the corn and disappoint the just hopes of the industrious farmer  Our greatest falls of snow or rain are from the south or southeast and whenever we have a very high  west wind  it is a certain sign that a great quantity of rain is falling to the westward in Cumberland and Roxburgh∣shire  SECT  Soil and Surface  A strong fertile clayey loam  occupies the level tract of country along the coast and reaches as far up in general as the great post road It is well adapted to the culture of wheat pulse clover and grazing  Sandy gravelly and dry loam  or what is here more generally understood by turnip soil is found on the banks of the Tyne from Newburn to Haltwhistle on the Co∣quet about and above Rothbury on the Aln from its mouth to Alnwick and down Tweedside But the greatest quantity of this kind of soil is found in the vales of Breamish Till and Beaumont The hills surrounding the Cheviot mountains are mostly a dry channelly sharppointed gravelly loam  Moist Loams  on a wet cold clayey bottom occupy a large portion of this county being unsafe for sheep and unfit for turnips they are principally employed in grow∣ing grain rearing young cattle and feeding ewes and lambs This soil prevails most in the middle and south∣east parts of the county  Black Peat Earth  is the prevailing soil in most of the mountainous districts and is found in many places through the lower parts of the county  The aspect of this county in respect to surface is mark∣ed with great variety along the seacoast it is nearly level towards the middle the surface is more diversified and thrown into large swelling ridges formed by the principal riversThese parts are well inclosed in some places enriched with wood and recent plantations but the general appearance is destitute of those ornaments The western part except a few intervening vales is an extensive scene of open mountainous district where the hand of Cultivation is rarely to be traced  Of the mountainous districts those around Cheviot are the most valuable being in general fine green hills thrown by some of those convulsive changes which this globe has at some time experienced into numberless variety of forms the verdant swiftsloping sides of which inclose and shelter many deep narrow glens through the whole of this district no mineral or other kind of stone is found except brown red and grey whinstone they extend from the head of Coquet down to Allen∣ton from thence northward to Prendwick Branton Il∣derton Wooler Kirknewton and Mindrim and occupy at least an area of acres  The other mountainous districts lie chiefly on the western part of the county some of which adjoin the county of Durham but the largest portion extends from the Ro∣man Wall to the river Coquet with a few intervening  inclosed vales and to the moors north of Rothbury They are not marked by any striking irregularities of sur∣face being in general extensive open solitary wastes growing little else but heath and affording a hard subsis∣tence to the flocks that depasture them  SECT  Minerals  Coal  is found in abundance thro' the greatest part of this county particularly in the lower district in the southeast quarter it is of the best quality  The coals found in this district are of the variety called  "caking coals"  which melt in the fire burn to a strong cinder in the open air and the best kinds produce very few ashes  and the most numerous and thickest seams from whence those vast quantities are exported which supply the great consump∣tion of the London market as well as the coasting and foreign tradeThis coal trade is the foundation of the commerce of the county and the principal source of its wealth as well as a neversailing nursery for some of the best seamen in the British NavyOf the quantity of coals raised in this county we have not been able to form a probable conjecture for want of sufficient data to esti∣mate the quantity used at home but have obtained what are exported from the River Tyne in which a consider∣able portion raised in the county of Durham is included and which may probably come near a balance for those consumed in this countySome idea of the magnitude of this trade may be formed by the following statement of  The Exports of Coals from Newcastle  In  Newcastle chaldrons                      This is the only year in which we find the quantities raised in Northumberland and Durham are kept distinct and which are  in the county of Northumberland chaldrons  in the county of Durham  In all      From hence it appears that this trade is increasing at an amazing rate there being not less than onethird more coals exported now than were exported years since From Hartley and Blyth there are exported yearly between and chaldrons if these be added to the average export from Newcastle for the last three or four years the quantity exported from this county may be fairly estimated at Newcastle chaldrons or London chaldrons the Newcastle chaldron being to the London chaldron in the ratio of to The value of the above quantity to the various parties concerned will appear by the following  Calculation of the cost and charges upon a so  pload of coals containing    keels  A keel of coals is ton cwt and contains  Newcastle chaldrons  so that each chaldron is cwt  A London chaldron  contains heaped Winchester bushels and weighs on an average near ½ cwt according to the quality of the coals which weights being nearly in the ratio of to it is always reckoned that Newcastle chaldrons make London chaldrons  or    Newcastle chaldrons delivered in the port of London  Paid at Newcastle  £  s  d  To

Total expences of the cargo        Which deducted from l the amount of the cargo as above leaves l s d for the freight of the ship  As we are not able to procure sufficient information of the number of people in the coal trade we shall take the liberty of extracting from Mr M'Nab's Letter to Mr Pitt that the number of persons employed and dependent on the coal trade in the year were  On the river Tyne    On the river Wear    Total    To the coalowners the winning and working these collieries are very expensive and frequently attended with considerable risque for tho' very large fortunes have been made in the business yet many have been lost the unexpected alteration of the strata from dykes and other troubles the frequent and dreadful explosions from in∣flammable air the great depth of the shafts and increas∣ing quantities of water to be raised from them baffle the most experienced artists and overcome the amazing pow∣ers of the fireengine which of late years has received many improvements and been made to perform what was thought absolutely impossible at its first introduction  We were informed that there was only one fireengine in the neighbourhood of Neweastle about years sincethat it raised the water only yards which at that time was thought a wonderful performance at present water is raised and probably in greater abundance yards and upwards  These powerful machines are now applied to the pur∣poses of drawing coals which business was formerly uni∣versally performed by horses frequently to a shaft where great quantities were drawn and dispatch was ne∣cessary but by the invention and application of the draw∣ing machines a great many horses were dismissed from  the collieries which has considerably reduced the con∣sumption of oats in this neighbourhood  Many of the collieries are situated at a considerable dis∣tance from the river to which the coals are conveyed from the pits in a peculiar kind of carriage called a  Newcastle coalwaggon pl    fig  it has small wheels about inches diameter  fixed to the axles  with which they turn round and move on a road called the waggonway made on purpose  with wood  which is formed by long pieces of wood RA rails about inches square laid lengthways upon sleepers of wood SSS and the thickness of the rail above the plane of the rest of the road and at the exact distance of the waggon wheels from each other as it is upon those rails the wheels run  A new waggonway including timber levelling gravel∣ing and workmanship will cost about s per yard or l per mile and the expence of keeping it in repair is generally about ½d per chaldron on a quantity of chaldrons annually or l s d per mile  It has been suggested that a waggonway might be substitu∣ted in lieu of turnpike roads for the conveyance of heavy goods but we presume that the expence of first making laying out in nearly a level line or so as to have little or no ascent and keep∣ing in repair would greatly overbalance the additional weight to be drawn by one horse as the wood rots and wastes nearly as much by a small quantity of carriage passing along it as a larger  The dimensions of the body of these waggons are as follows     Ft  Ins  Length at top      bottom      Breadth at top      bottom      Height      They hold a chaldron of coals or cwt and are drawn by a single horse  A gentlyinclined plane is the most desirable position for those waggonways but few situations will admit of this Upon levels or easy ascents a single horse draws the waggon On such parts of the way where the declina∣tion is sufficient for the waggon to move by the power of gravity the horse is taken out and follows behind and where the descents are such that the waggon would move with too great rapidity by its own weight or  "run a∣main"  the motion is regulated by a crooked piece of wood called a  convey  coming over the top of one of the hind wheels upon which the waggonman presses with such force as he finds requisite to regulate the motion of the waggon  This mode of conveyance has been used here upwards of years  In has been asserted that  "the coals in this county are inexhaustible"  Mr Williams in his Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom is of a different opinion and think it a matter of such importance as to deserve the se∣rious attention of the LegislatureTowards elucidating this point it may be of some use to estimate what number of acres are wrought yearly in this county to supply the above quantity of coals In order to accomplish this ob∣ject the thickness and number of workable seams of coal must be first ascertained for which purpose we have been favoured with sections  One of St Anthon's about miles below Newcastle by Mr Johnson the other of Montague Main about miles above New∣castle by Mr Thomas  exhibiting the thickness and depth of the various strata in some of the deepest pits in the county which will not only be useful for the present purpose but we hope will be acceptable to many of our readers who are curious in researches of subterraneous geography  At St Anthon's Colliery miles east of Newcastle the strata from the surface to the LOW MAIN

ground supposing the aggregate thickness of the various seams a∣mount to yards  An acre of ground contains  square yards  which multiplied by the thickness  yards  gives  cubic yards in an acre  From which deduct  for waste and the part o  pillars necessary to be left in working    there remains  cubic yards to be wrought  And as three cubic yards of coal when wrought afford a Newcastle chaldron  therefore    divided by    =gives Newcastle chaldrons per acre  The coals exported yearly from the rivers Tyne and Wear with Hartley and Blyth amount to about chaldrons  From Newcastle  chaldrons  Sunderland  ditto  In all    which with the home consumption of the two counties of Northumberland and Durham will make the quantity of coals raised yearly about chaldrons  And the chaldrons raised yearly    divided by the chaldrons per acre    =gives acres near∣ly per year cleared of coal yds thick  And by estimating the breadth occupied by the caking coals to be on an averge miles broad and miles long in the two counties we shall find there will be about square miles or acres of coal proper for expor∣tation  Then the whole area    divided by the yearly consumption    = years The time before this space will be wrought out  But there are some reasons to think that a thickness of seam equal to yards will not be obtained over an ex∣tent of square miles probably not more on an aver∣age than yards in which case the coal will be exhaust∣ed in years and if the aggregate thickness of the seams to be obtained should prove only three yards then little more than years will be the term of continu∣ance but it is probable that before the half of that time be elapsed the price to the consumer will be con∣siderably increased from the increased expence of ob∣taining them and the increased length of carriage from the pits to the river This last we presume may be re∣duced in some situations by adopting canals instead of waggonways which we have often wondered have never yet been attempted  From the above investigation it appears that Mr Williams's apprehensions are not so chimerical at have been represented how far it may be right for the legis∣lature to interfere we leave to the consideration of those more conversant in political speculations  Of the coal found all thro' Bambro' Ward Islandshire and those parts of Glendale Ward east of the river Till the seams are very thin mostly from to feet thick and of a very inferior quality yielding a great quantity of ashes and neither caking in the fire nor burning to a cinder they are used only for homeconsumption and for burning lime for the latter purpose they are well adapted by their property of neither caking nor burning to a cinder and it luckily happens that thro' all this dis∣trict the coal and lime are generally found together a circumstance which greatly facilitates and lessens the ex∣pence of burning lime  If a line be drawn from Alemouth to a little west of Bywell on the river Tyne very little of this kind of coal and limestone will be found to the east of it and from this line to the sea coast no limestone whatever ap∣pears except a small patch of a different limestone that puts in at Whitley near Tynemouth and runs from thence in a southwesterly direction thro' the county of Durham c In this space betwixt these two ranges of limestone lie the caking coals of superior quality above de∣scribed and the same breadth of coal may be traced thro' the county of Durham stretching in the same direction and bounded on the east and west in a similar manner by stretches of limestone of different kinds  It would be a curious investigation to trace these mi∣nerals thro' the different counties across the island and show where the strata of each species rise to the surface and the deviations caused in them by cross veins or dykes c we believe it will be found that very little or no coal lies to the east of this line and that no chalk lies to the west  Limestone  of an excellent quality abounds thro' all Bambro' Ward Islandshire and that part of Glendale Ward situated on the east side of the river Till it stretches from hence in a southwesterly direction thro' the central parts of the county and is found at Shilbottle Longframlington Hartburn Rial Corbridge c and at numberless other places to the westward of these but the southeast quarter which is so rich in coal is destitute of lime  Except a small patch at Whitley near Tynemouth  as is also that part of Glendale Ward west of the river Till  Stone Marl  abounds in many places near Tweedside and  Shell Marl  is found in a few places in Glendale Ward The greatest quantity is at  Wark  and  Sunnylaws  where it has been formed by a deposit of various kinds of  shells both univalve and bivalve many of which are yet perfect forming a stratum several feet in depth of pure calcareous earth but the exact depth of this bed of marl has never yet been ascertained for want of a proper level to carry off the water It probably may afford matter of speculation to some readers to be informed that in the middle of this marl there is an horizontal stratum of sand about inches thick and also that a few years since a  Red Deer Stag  in the attitude of running and in every part complete was found embedded in the marl horns of the same animal have been found at different times in perfect preservation and a part of the  scalp  with the  cores  of a pair of horns belonging to some animal of the  Bos Taurus  species were lately found here we have never seen any breed of cattle the horns of which were of equal magnitude for though the outside shell or horn part was wanting yet the  core  was inches long and inches circumference at the root and when in a perfect state and covered with the outside shell must have been about inches diameter their form is a gentle curve and have all the appearance of a pair of bull's horns but probably of a different breed of cattle to any we have at present  Clay Marl  is also found in small quantities but in situ∣ations where it could not be conveniently used with effect  Lead Ore  has hitherto never been found in any quan∣tity but in the mountainous districts on the southwest part of the county towards the head of that branch of South Tyne called Allendale and a small quantity at Fallowfield a little to the north of Hexham  The lead mines in Allendale produce about bings of lead ore annually which at l s od per bing is upwards of l a year  In this county lead ore is wrought by the  bing  a measure containing cwt of clean ore the workmen being paid by the owners of the mine at different prices  from s to s per  bing  for getting and washing or cleaning according to the richness quality or hardness of the mine If the owners sell any of the ore in this state the price is generally from l s to l s per  bing  but they mostly have smelt mills of their own where they smelt it at their own cost take the silver out of it by refining  The Alendale lead ore is smelted and refined at Dukesfield smeltmill and produces about or ounces of silver from each fother of lead what is got at Fallowfield contains so little silver that it will not pay the expence of refining while some ore got in Alston Moor in Cumberland yields oz of silver per fother  The process of refining greatly improves the lead by making it more ductile  and then cast the lead into long pieces call∣ed  pigs  of ½ cwt each  Pig lead  is sold by the fother a quantity containing cwt which is reckoned to sell at a fair price when at l or l per fother in it was as low as l and in the beginning of it was l sin it rose gradually to l s per fother which was several pounds higher than it was ever sold at before but in the following year it sell to l or l per fother which shews the fluctuating price of this article  The  Ore of Zink  is found in great abundance embed∣ded with spar in most of the veins producing lead ore but its distance from any brass manufactures and from water carriage renders it of little value In these mines are also found great variety of crystallizations of spar quartz c c  The mines which produce lead ore are very fluctuating and uncertain in point of profit to the adventurers but tend to a general good by giving employment to a numer∣ous class of industrious workmen who being situated in a climate improper for the production of grain are oblig∣ed to receive the greatest part of their provisions from the more fertile districts of the county and by those means encourage its agriculture  Iron Ore  may be had in many parts of the county of late years the convenience of shipping it at Holy Island has induced the Carron Company to have considerable quantities from thence  Freestones  of various kinds abound in almost every part of the county and are applied to all the purposes of building Many of the quarries afford tolerable slates for roofing and flags for floors at some of them excellent grindstones are got of which a great many are exported from Camus and Warkworth  SECT  Waters  The principal rivers which act as estuaries to the rest are the Tyne Blyth Wansbeck Coquet Aln and Tweed The innumerable streams which lose their names in the above spread in every direction through the county The Tyne branches into nearly two equal streams a little above Hexham which are distinguished by the names of North Tyne and South Tyne the main branch of North Tyne is the Reed and of South Tyne the Allen The principal streams which empty themselves into the Tyne east of Hexham are the Devil'swater and the Der∣went and the river Till is the only stream of any note which empties itself into the Tweed in this county  The Tyne and Tweed are the most eminent for their navigation the tide flowing up the former miles and up the latter eight or ten the navigation of the other rivers is confined to a small distance from their mouths of these the Blyth and Aln are of the most im∣portance from the convenience which the first affords to its neighbourhood for the exportation of considerable quantities of coals and both of them for corn c and the importation of timber iron and other useful articles  The Tyne and Tweed have been long celebrated for  their salmon fisheries in the latter a rent of l a year is paid for a fishing of yards in length near the mouth of the river and the same rent is paid for other  above the bridge not more than yards in  The fish taken here are the Salmon Bulltrout Wh  ng and large common Trout and nearly the whole of them sent to London in the con∣veyance of which a great improvement has taken place of late years by packing them in pounded ice by this means they are presented nearly as fresh at the London market as when taken out of the river For the purpose of car∣rying them and keeping up a constant and regular supply vessels called smacks sail times a week and being pur∣posely constructed for swift sailing frequently make their run in hours These vessels are from to tons burden on an average men are employed in each vessel and make about voyages in a year and not less than boats and fishermen are employed in taking the fish in the river Tweed  CHAPTER II  STATE OF PROPERTY  SECT  Estates  ESTATES vary in their annual value from l to up∣wards of l a yearone in particular is upwards of lSmall estates from l to l a year are found in the southern and middle parts of the county but very rarely in the northern  There are probably few parts of the kingdom where estates have made such rapid improvements as in this county there being several instances of the value being  more than trebled within the last years Many cau∣ses have certainly been aiding to produce this great ef∣fect but the principal one is attributed to letting large farms and leases for years by which means the te∣nants of capital were encouraged to make those great ex∣ertions from which such advantages have resulted not only to themselves and proprietors of the land but to the community at large from the very increased produce and superiority of its quality  The usual mode of letting farms is to fix a rent under certain conditions and covenants or months before the expiration of the lease but upon one of the largest estates in the county  The Earl of Tankerville's  the tenants have an offer of their farms ½  or    years  before the expiration of the lease which is a mutual benefit to both landlord and tenant and is attended with so many advantages that it is in a fair way of being generally adopted  On some estates the practice of letting farms by  secret proposals  is still in use this is a dark and mysterious mode which frequently defeats the end it is intended to accomplish and instead of obtaining an  excessive high rent  the prize has been often gained at a  very inferior value  and in the language of the turf where only one has en∣tered the lists "by walking the course" and we have known some of the first farmers in the county forego their farms rather than submit to contend in the dark Upon most estates it is generally stipulated that a certain portion of the best old grazing lands on each farm shall be kept in grass during the whole term  The quantity of land to be in ploughing is mostly limit∣ed to a certain number of acres and at the expiration of the term where the tenant quits on the th of May he is allowed to have a crop of corn from off twothirds of the arable lands this is called the  waygoing crop  the  entering tenant has the straw and leads the crop into the stackyardThe houses hedges gates drains c are kept and left in repair by the tenant who likewise pays all taxes cesses c  Of the annual value of the estates in this county no authentic information could be obtained but a probable guess may be formed by supposing that there are acres of cultivated land and that this on an average is worth s per acreand that acres of moun∣tainous district is worth s per acre  Then acres at s  l  And acres at s  l  Gives the total value of the lands per ann  £  SECT  Tenures  The land property in this county is mostly freeholdThere are to be found in a few places some small par∣cels of copyhold and in those districts which belong to the county of Durham some leaseholds for lives or years held under the churchThere are also two or three ma∣nors of customary tenure towards the head of South Tyne  CHAPTER III  BUILDINGS  SECT  Houses of Proprietors  THE seats of the principal proprietors of this county consist of venerable castles old halls and elegant mo∣dern mansionsTo give particular descriptions would  be too extensive for an Agricultural Survey those who wish for information on this subject we beg leave to re∣fer to Hutchinson's View of Northumberland Pennant's Tour c c  SECT  Farm Houses Offices c  Buildings  for the use and convenience of farms were formerly very shabby and ill contrived but those that have been erected of late years are better adapted to the various purposes wanted for extensive farms and improved cultivation  The most approved form of distributing the various offices is on the east west and north sides of a rectan∣gular parallelogram which is generally divided into two foldyards for cattle of different ages the south being left open to admit the sun and for the same reason and also for the sake of cleanliness and health the farm house is removed in front thirty or forty yards between which and the south wall of the fold is a small court for coals young poultry c as in the annexed plan  A Scale of Feet  A  The farmhouse  B  The barn feet by  C  Sheds over which are granaries  D D  Ditto upon which are built cornslacks one of which is for wintering yearling calves the other for holding implements of husbandry  E  Byers for cows and workoxen feet by  F  Stables  G  Pigstyes with henhouse above  H H  Foldyards for cattle of different ages  Repairs are mostly done by the tenants on the large farms complaints are seldom made of their being neglect∣ed but upon small farms the landlord is frequently obli∣ged to lend his assistance  SECT  Cottages  Such cottages as have been erected a number of years are built with stone and clay and covered with thatch those that have been built of late years are of stone and lime covered with tiles and mostly a floor of lime and sand they consist of one apartment ft by to dwell in with a small one at the entrance for a cow coals working tools c ft by and are only one story high Very few of them want the accommodation of a garden  The materials used for building are stone and bricks but mostly the former Straw thatch used to be the universal covering but it is now nearly fallen into disuse and tiles or slates substituted in its stead The small dark blue slate from Scotland is the kind generally used here and are much superior to tiles for though they are more expensive at first yet it is probable that in a few years they may be as cheap from the repairs tiles so frequently require especially where they are so ill manufactured  Fir timber is universally used for all the purposes of building  CHAPTER IV  MODE OF OCCUPATION  SECT  Farms and Character of the Farmers  THE  size of farms  varies considerably in this county in Glendale and Bambrough Wards the farms are large from l to l a year very few under l In the other parts of the county they are from l to l a year Some tenants in the northern parts of the county farm from l to l a year and upwardsThe capitals necessary for such farms entitle them to a good education and give them a spirit of independence and en∣terprize that is rarely found amongst the occupiers of small farms and short leases Their minds being open to conviction they are ready to try new experiments and adopt every beneficial improvement that can be learnt in other districts for this purpose many of them have tra∣versed the most distant parts of the kingdom to obtain agricultural knowledge and have transplanted every prac∣tice they thought superior to those they were acquainted with or that could be advantageously pursued in their own situation And scarce a year passes without some of them making extensive agricultural tours for the sole pur∣pose of examining the modes of culture of purchasing or hiring the most improved breeds of stock and seeing the operations of newinvented and most useful imple∣ments  The character of a farmer is here so respectable that gentlemen who possess landed property from l to l a year think it no debasement to follow the pro∣fession  and so high a name have many of the farmers obtained for their superior knowledge in rural affairs that they are seldom without pupils from various and distant parts of the kingdom with whom they have very hand∣some premiums  Generally l per annum  Amongst the present pupils may be reckoned the son of an Parl and the son of a Baronetwho from their abilities attention and anxious readiness to learn and work at every operation we hope will do cre∣dit to the profession and render the most essential services to their respective districts  SECT  Rent  The rent  of lands in this county used formerly to be clogged with payments in kind and personal services But these have been long disused and the whole is now paid in moneyThe rents are mostly due on the th of May and the d of November but payment is seldom required till four or five months after being due  The rent per acre must vary with the quality of the land and other circumstances At a distance from towns and for the purposes of farming only lands may be had from one shilling per acre up to and shillingsLast year a farm of upwards of acres was let for s an acre uninclosed but tithefree of grainOne of acres at s per acre pays all tithesAnother of acres at s per acre tithefree well inclosed and in high condition and several other large farms that pay tithes of every kind have been let as high as from to s per acre and some old rich grazing pastures along the seacoast let for s per acre  SECT  Tithes  Of this bane to Agriculture we do not find any thing peculiar to this county which is not common to the rest In some parts the tithes are collected with moderation in others with all the severity that law can enforce some let for a term of years at a fair rent whilst others value and let every year  SECT  Poor Rates  In Newcastle they vary from s d to s d in the pound in times of peace but at present AllSaints pa∣rish is as high as s per pound owing to the seafaring people living mostly in this parish and the sailors being impressed their wives and children come for support up∣on the pairshAt Hexham they are s dMorpeth s dAlnwick s dBelford s dBerwick s dWooler s dand in other parts of the county we find they vary from d to s per pound  SECT  Leases  Leases  for twentyone years are let on most of the principal estates especially in the northern parts of the county Some proprietors of land in the other districts let only for nine twelve or fifteen years The general time of entry is the th of May  Upon the Duke of Northumberland's estate the time of en∣try is Ladyday and the offgoing tenant has no waygoing crop  The covenants vary with circumstances but we think the following the best calculated for improvement and the benefit of both land∣lord and tenant  After the usual reservations of mines woods c and  provisoes of reentry on nonpayment of rent or aliena∣tion c the tenant covenants to pay the rentall taxeskeep and leave all in repairnot to sell hay straw or other fodder from off the premisesto lay the dung on the premises except that bred the last yearnot to sow any hemp flax mustard or rape except the last for green foodnot to depasture more stints the last year than were depastured for two years precedingto destroy the moles yearly and scale the grass groundsto thresh the waygoing crop in an uniform manner and deliver a daily supply of straw to the next tenantto keep uneaten the lands sown with grass seeds in the last year of the term from the first of October except one half to be eaten by the offgoing tenant after the st of April to the end of the termto permit the lessor to sow grass seeds on the waygoing cropand to plough the lands intended for fallow five months before the expiration of the termto have no more ploughing than  Generally from onethird to near onehalf on the larger farms but on some small farms it is more  acres at one timeto fallow yearly for wheat turnips or other green crops onethird of the tillage lands and lay upon every acre cart loads of lime  where necessary  or in lieu thereof cart loads of dungnot to keep any land in tillage more than three years at one timeto lay to grass yearly onethird of the tillage lands and sow upon every acre pounds of clover c or other seeds suited to the soil to keep such lands in grass at least two or three years  Weak soils improper for corn should continue in grass or years or until it is thought they want refreshing by ploughing which is only used in such situations as being subservient to stock  be∣fore they are ploughed out againto lay down to grass or have in grass the last three years all those fields called to keep in grass  during the whole of the term and at the end thereof leave in grass all those fields called  These are generally old rich grazing pastures or meadows  and all such lands as shall be converted into watered meadowsto be at one half the expence of making new quick sences and of cleaning and rearing them for seven years after first planted  and others that situation or circumstances may require  The lessor convenants that the tenant shall have peace∣able possession and a waygoing crop from off twothirds of the tillage lands with the use of the stack yards barns and granaries for twelve months after the expiration of the term also to be at onehalf the expence of making all new quick fences and of cleaning and rearing them for seven years after first planted with other covenants that may be agreed on respecting building c  SECT  Expence and Profit  The expence upon a farm may be estimated pretty near the truth for a certain number of acres but the profits depend upon so many precarious circumstances such as seasons mode of culture produce markets c that we think any estimate of profits upon a particular farm would be a very vague criterion for judging of the rest and most probably would not suit any other farm of the same rent or magnitude in the county we shall there∣fore state the expence of cultivating an acre supposing a farm in the rotation of three years arable and three years grassviz  year oats  turnips  barley  clover and other grasses  clover and other grasses  clover and other grasses  And that the first year's clover carries six sheep per acre the second year four and the third year two sheep per acreThen the expence will be as follows  First year  for oats     £  s  d  Ploughing and harrowing        Seed and sowing        Weeding        Harvesting        Threshing and winnowing        Market

sown but we think bushels or ½ bushels very sufficient and where drilled at or inches intervals ½ bushels we find a proper quantity which saving of seed will pay for horse and handhoeing when the crop is drilled  and sowing        Weeding        Harvesting threshing mar∣keting and carriage                 Carried over           £  s  d  Brought over        th th  and  th  years  clover and grasses

and cesses for years        Capital employed for cultivation c        Ditto for sheep at s each        Total capital employed on acres        The interest of which allowing per cent is        To which must be added the ex∣pence of cultivation        Gives the expence per year for acres        Or per acre        The expences incurred for cultivation will be nearly the same whatever the soil but the produce will vary ac∣cording to the quality of the land  On good lands the produce may be  st  year    Oats bush per acre at s per bush          Turnips per acre          Barley bush per acre at s d

acre per year        From the above statement it appears that nearly the fame capital will be required to carry on a farm  in tillage  at s per acre that it does one at s per acreThere∣fore a farm of  good land  of l per year will require less capital than a farm of  bad land  of l per year and also that when the value of the crops in years amounts to no more than l such lands are improper for arable and will pay no rentof course the most profitable mode of employing such soils is to let them remain in pasturage  CHAPTER V  IMPLEMENTS  THE  Carts  used in this county are mostly drawn by two horses they are in general heavy clumsy and illformed and such as we think few districts would wish to imitate they are rightlined rectangular parallelopipe∣dons the general dimensions for a twohorse cart are inches long inches wide and inches deep and contain ½ Winchester bushels  streaked measure  The usual load for two horses in Winter is bushels of wheat and in Summer the first about cwt and the lat∣ter about cwt or one ton  The neatest most useful and best contrived carts we know are those made in many parts of the NorthRiding of Yorkshire The singlehorse carts of this construction used for carrying coals from the county of Durham into Yorkshire are inches long inches wide and deep hold bushels of coals when set round the sides with large coals and upheapedA man or boy drives three of these two of which are equal to the greatest quantity ever carried by three horsesMr Charge of Newton sends three of these carts for coals every day which bring bushels of coals the distance miles there and back and is per∣formed in hours by one manThe same gentleman's twohorse carts bring bushels of the same coals  Singlehorse Carts  are becoming more prevalent in se∣veral parts of the countyMr James Johnson a common carrier at Hexham has a horse hands high that com∣monly carries from Hexham to Newcastle cwt and cwt back again and there are instances of his having carried cwt from Newcastle to Hexham which is a very banky heavypulling road  Waggons  drown by four horses are used by some far∣mers  for leading coals and lime but we hope a few years will shew the absurdity of employing such unwieldy carriages so destructive to roads and of so little utility to farmers  The swing Plough  made in imitation of the Rother∣ham plough is in general use through every part of this county  The farmers of this district have always had the good sense not to load their teams with  wheel ploughs  as wheels in general destroy a considerable portion of the power of the team besides their additional weight hence the absurdity of recommending  Norfolk ploughs  to those districts where the simple  swingplough  has been used and properly understood  its form is constantly varying no fixed rules being known for its construction scarce two carpenters making them alike differing widely in length and height of the beam point of yoking form of mouldboard c c To remedy these defects it was intimated in the first edition of this Report that  "An Essay on the con∣struction of the Plough deduced from mathematical principles"  would be soon offered to the publicThis Essay is now published  For Messrs Robinson London price s  from which we have extracted the following  "  PRACTICAL CONSTRUCTION  For determining the position and dimensions of the most essential parts of a Plough  "That the operation of ploughing may be performed with the least loss of power it is necessary to know the height and inclination of the horse's shoulder  "While a horse is in the act of pulling the inclina∣tion of his shoulder varies from to degrees accord∣ing to circumstances the medium is degrees and the medium height of the point of draught on the shoul∣der of a horse ½ hands high is inches  "These data being got from experiment and the depth to be ploughed suppose inches given  "Draw a right line AB and at any point fig pl A erect a perpendicular AP equal to inches  "With AP as a radius from P as a center describe a quarter of a circle AQ which divide into equal parts or degrees  "From P through degrees draw a right line to meet AB in B  "Set the length of the traces and swingtrees from P to H this is commonly inches  "From H upon AB let fall a perpendicular HI which measured on the scale that AP was taken from will give  the height of the beam  HI=½ inches  "Then at the distance of  half the depth  the land is in∣tended to be ploughed in this case inches draw a line parallel to AB and from C where it intersects PB let fall a perpendicular upon AB to S which will give the point of the sock and a line drawn through C making an angle of degrees with BA will be the position of the foreedge of the coulter  "The heel of the plough will be got by setting the length of the sole inches from S to L  "The length of the beam will be determined by ta∣king the distance from H to any fixed point as S or B or L and applying it to the scale of equal partsIn this case  HS=½ inches  HB=½ do  HL= do"  The form of the mouldboard is such that the sod to be raised presses equally against it on every part from the sock point S to where it leaves it at K it also differs from other mouldboards in not beginning to take its rise from the bottom opposite to the heel L but at least inches farther forward towards the sock and in being cut  away at the bottom opposite the heel L about inches high from the sole by which the turning of the sod is much facilitated  For the demonstration of the principles from which the above construction is derived as well as the investi∣gation and practical directions for making the mouldboard  Cast iron mouldboards of this form with maundrells for forging the socks upon may be had of Messrs Whinfield and Co ironsounders Newcastle upon Tyne  and finding the curve of the breast GS with many other essential properties we must beg leave to re∣fer to the asorementioned essay and only observe that wherever these ploughs have been properly tried they have answered the intention being allowed by all who have seen them at work to go with more ease to the horses than any otherThe best mode of applying the draught is by two horses yoked double and driven with cords by the holder which are sufficient for ploughing the strongest lands and will in general do an acre per day  Upon Warkhaugh a  strong deep loam  a young Nobleman who did not think it any disgrace to make himself acquainted with the profession of Agriculture with one of those ploughs and two horses yoked double and driven by himself ploughed  two acres

other sets of hoes put in the holes made in the sides CE and DE and end CD to hoe from to inches at once for this purpose in  dry seasons  it is preferable to the singlehorse plough above described and with proper formed hoes will answer all the other purposes of expensive scufflers cultivators and quicken rakes though no more than a singlehorse be required to draw it and its price be only or shillings according to the number and variety of the hoes  This implement answers very well for hoeing wheat or barley drilled at or inch intervals by making it a little wider so as to take in four hoes  Harrows  A large heavy harrow called a brake is com∣monly used for reducing rough land especially fallows  Singlehorse harrows containing four bulls and tines or teeth five or seven inches long below the bull are generally used for harrowingin seed after it has had a singling by the brake a man drives three horses and every horse draws his own harrow Some people use two horse harrows joined in the middle by crooks and loops and also small light harrows with short tines for putting in grass seeds  Rollers  for reducing cloddy land rolling wheat in the Spring and grass seeds are mostly made of wood they are generally ½ feet long and from to inches diameter those used for slattening the tops of onebout ridges for drilling turnips upon are feet long and or inches diameter the framing is various but that shewn in the annexed drawing is the most general  pl    fig  The rope by which the drill is drawn is fastened to the bar B and is slipped from one end to the other at every turning to suit the sowing To prevent the accumulation of earth upon the roller a thin piece of wood C is placed at its back to act as a scraper  A drill for sowing Turnips  on the tops of  oneboul ridges  When this mode of cultivating turnips was first intro∣duced the only drill used was a hollow cylinder of tin with a small hole in the bottom thro' which the seed was shook if this orifice be made of such size as to deposit a proper quantity of seed it is very liable to stop and of course large spaces are totally missed if made so wide as to prevent this inconvenience it then sows far too much This defect induced me some years since to construct one upon different principles which is now coming into general use  The most essential parts of this drill consist of a solid cylinder C  fig    pl  of iron or brass inches di∣ameter and inch broad on the surface are made or punched or cavities of the form of a semiegg  Fig  Fig  Fig  Fig  cut lengthways and so deep as to hold or seeds each On the back part of this cylinder a little below the top is placed the hind part of the hopper to which is fixed a piece of iron or brass GA one inch long and ¾ broad hollowed on the inside into the form of a Gothic arch as in  fig  the sides of which meeting the sides of the cavities in an  oblique angle  prevent the seeds from bruis∣ing at the lower end of this piece of iron which may be called a gatherer is made a slit of an inch long and wide and at the back of it a thin flat piece of iron TE moves up and down by means of a screw S at the top of the hopper which enlarges or lessens the orifice O direct∣ly above the cavities and increases or diminishes the quan∣tity of seed delivered as the operator thinks necessary This slip of thin iron which may be called a regula∣tor is let into a groove made in the board which forms the back part of the hopper  This cylinder CY before the cavities are made is fix∣ed on an iron axle LL inch square and turned very true as well as are those parts of the axle which turn in the collars or thimbles fixed in the shafts or handles DD  fig    pl  To the ends of the axle are fixed two wheels WW inches diameter that turn the axle and cylinder round which in passing thro' the hopper H filled with turnip seed bring forward in each cavity a number of seeds and drop them into the spout P which are conveyed by it to the coulter C that forms a channel on the top of the onebout ridge SD  fig    pl  for receiving themwhere S is the channel and D the dung directly under the seeds  If the cavities be made to hold seeds when the regula∣tor or tongue is screwed close down and there be ca∣vities it will then deposit seeds in one revolution and as the diameter of the wheel is inches the circumfer∣ence will be ½ in this case seeds will be deposited  in ½ inches or nearly in a footFrom this minimum quantity by screwing up the regulator the number may be increased gradually to or in a foot which is far too much unless in very particular and unfavourable situations  The price of this drill is l s  Drillsfor sowing the different kinds of grain  used in this county not being able to regulate the quantity of seed to suit different soils seasons c we mentioned in the first edition of this Report that a drill was then mak∣ing which would remedy those complaints a description and drawing of which being published in the Appendix to the Essay on Ploughs mentioned in p we take the li∣berty of extracting from thence "  A description of a drill upon a new construction for sowing all kinds of grain in any quantity and at any distance  "The inside part of the drill by which the quanti∣ty of seed is regulated is represented by  fig    pl  where AX is an iron axle or ¼ inch square upon which are fixed at or inches distance five six or more brass fluted cylinders the flutes being rather more than a semicircle ⅝ of an inch diameter or ⅝ wide and    deep  "RM are hollow cylindrical rims of hammered iron which have segments turned down at right angles to fit exactly the flutes of the brass cylinders the cavities of which are increased or diminished by the segments of the iron cylindrical rims sliding backwards or forwards in the flutes This is performed in all the cylinders  at the same time  by a rectangular space  n  being made in the brass cylinders through which passes a straight piece of iron IN moving on friction wheels at J and fastened to the plates at LK and also to the cylindrical rims RM  "LV is a lever the fulcrum of which is F and moved  Fig  Fig  by a screw S passing through the frame at V The end at LK is forked and made to  fit exactly  the sides of the collar or plates of iron JK  "By turning the screw S the lever moves the whole of the rims at once and the cavities are increased or diminish∣ed at pleasure  This is done with the greatest facility and readiness even while the machine is going and at work which is frequently ne∣cessary where the land varies considerably in quality upon differ∣ent parts of the same ridge  and almost instantaneously to sow  any kind of grain  and  in any proportion  which is shewn upon the scale EOP by the index KO fixed to the end of the lever at K  "  Fig    pl  is a view of the machine when ready for work  The coulters and spouts may be hung differently as repre∣sented by the dotted lines and which is probably the better mode for hilly lands  " and for a more particular description for regulating the depths distances c we beg leave to re∣fer to the abovementioned Essay  For Turnips  the large hopper is taken off and a set of small ones sixed upon the halfegg cavities at the end of the brass cylinders The quantity is regulated by a tongue screwing up and down as described in the turnip drill  fig    pl    For sowing  beans  or  pease  at wide intervals viz from to inches I use a drill with only one wheel and one cylinder which a man wheels before him in the fur∣row or what I find much better it may be fixed in the body of a small plough drawn by a single horse with one stilt that passes between the wheel and the seedbox  fig    pl  By this means the wheel moves along a smooth surface between the landside and mouldboard M and the seed is deposited at a regular depth two inches answers very well for beans With the same small plough and drill I have sown both wheat and barley at different  intervals from to inches and ½ or inches deep with good success and for small concerns this cheap and simple apparatus will probably be found the most eligi∣ble  It is fixed to the plough by two pieces of iron going from the ends of the drill one to the beam at B and the other to the stilt at C and moving round on bolts allow the wheel W to fall and rise with every accidental hollow or eminence  The low part of the coulter is knee'd or bent to bring it to the same plane with the land side of the plough  Threshing Machines  are now becoming general in the northern parts of the country they are all upon the prin∣ciple of the flax mill which principle was first introduced into this county for threshing corn by Mr Edward Greg∣son near years since the machine he used was work∣ed by a man who could thresh with it bushels of wheat in a day but being hard work and Mr Gregson dying soon after it was neglected Mr Wm Menzie who was ser∣vant with Mr Gregson at the time says "that his master took the idea from a small flax mill which a Scotchman travelled the country with for the purpose of swingling the flax which the farmers grew for their own use this portable flax mill was carried in a cart from one farm∣house to another being a cylinder of or ½ feet diame∣ter and inches wide the switchers were driven by his foot with a crank like a cutler's wheel and that the threshing machine Mr Gregson had was made at that time and exactly the same as the said flax mill"Mr Tho Gregson thinks that his brother Edward had seen some∣thing of a similar nature in Scotland probably the same which Mr D Meldrum gives an account of about the same time in a letter to Mr William Charge of Cleasby in the county of York which he describes as being the same as the flax mill that it threshed bushels of  oats a day which dropped through a skreen into a win∣nowing machine that dressed at the same time  Some time after this Mr Oxley erected a threshing machine at Flodden moved by horses in which the corn was fedin betwixt two  fluted rollers  and struck by switch∣ers placed as those are in the present machines only they are  hung on hinges  Those in use now are  fixed  as were those of Mr Gregson's The complaint of Mr Oxley's machine was that it did not thresh common oats clean probably for want of velocity for it is found in the machines now used that if the switchers move with a velocity of feet per minute they will not thresh clean and experience has proved that to thresh com∣mon oats clean requires a velocity of feet per minute  Mr Ilderton erected two threshing machines one at Ilderton and another at Hawkhill worked by horses the principle of which was to rub the grain out by pro∣jecting pieces of wood on the circumference of a large cylinder rubbing against several  fluted rollers  he used it many years but it was frequently necessary to put the straw twice thro' before it was perfectly clean  We were informed by the late Sir Francis Kinlock Bart of Gilmerton Scotland that while he was at∣tempting to perfect Mr Ilderton's machine he saw a port∣able flax mill made for the use of poor families worked by a man It struck him that it would thresh corn and he got one made with the addition of two smooth rollers for taking in the corn the work being too hard for a man he sent it to Mr Mickle's mill to have it tried by water soon after Mr Mickle's son built a threshing mill at Kilbogie and after ten or twelve had been erected in the neighbourhood by other workmen he applied to Mr Kinlock to take out a patent who told him that he did not look upon it as an original invention and that a pat∣ent  would not be of any use Some time after this Mr Mickle took out a patent for England only in his own name for the purpose we suppose of securing to himself his own combination of wheels c for movement of the various parts as the leading principle of the machine had been applied to the same purpose at least years before  Mr Mickle is a very ingenious mechanic and tho' it appears he has not the merit of being the original inventor yet he has added many useful improvements  At their first introduction into this county the corn and straw were thrown out together upon the floor and caused great confusion to remedy this a skreen was added thro' which the grain dropped into a winnowing machine and from off the skreen the straw was taken by a man but a  circular rake  invented about eight years since  By Mr Balley who first applied it to his machine at Chil∣lingham  performs the operation much better and at the same time saves a considerable expence This rake is now added to all those that have been lately erected and only causes an addition to the machinery of one light wheel These machines are moved both by water and by horses two four and even six of the latter are sometimes employed the former is certainly the best power where it can be obtained  From a review of the whole it appears that the princi∣ple of the flax mill had been applied by different persons at different times for the purpose of threshing corn and since its being more generally used different persons have invented and used various combinations of wheels and other contrivances to effect the same purpose and render the machine more perfect  The simplest and most useful combinations and contri∣vances are certainly the best but whose are entitled to  this appellation we do not pretend to determine the public must judge for themselvesThe combination we shall offer is different to any we have seen for which reason and being that where the first circular rake was applied we shall give  A description and calculation of a Threshing Machine erected at Chillingham  In  pl    fig  BB is a horizontal board or table feet long by ft ins broad on which the corn CC is  evenly spread  and presented to the castmetal fluted rollers RR inches diameter which take it regularly in and by their weight and sharp edges hold fast the straw while it is struck switched or threshed by the switchers or pie∣ces of wood SSSS fixed in the cylinder DD and pro∣jecting inches from its surface  This cylinder is made with strong arms on which are fixed the switchers and cased round with narrow inch deals the whole secured from flying off by strong iron hoops surrounding them at each end the switchers are covered with plate iron to prevent their wearing  these when they strike the corn move in an upward direction RE with great velocity and throw the corn as it is threshed and the straw as it leaves the fluted rollers against the circu∣lar rake KK and upon the wire skreen G from whence the straw is taken by the rake and delivered upon the sloping board L down which it slides to the floor N while the corn passes thro' the skreen G into the hopper H and from thence to the inclined board I but in fal∣ling from H to I a strong current of air raised by the fanners FFF blows the chaff over the sloping board O and the light corn against it which falls into the space P and the chaff into M while the good grain slides down the inclined board II to the floor at Q from whence it is taken and put into a second winnowing machine in which are placed proper riddles to suit different kinds of grain This second machine is moved by a rope going  over a pulley fixed in the axle T and is set agoing or stopped at pleasure by a stretching pulley as occasion requires  Where the situation will admit of the board II being placed about feet from the floor the second winnow∣ing machine may be placed directly under it and save the trouble of lifting the corn  To find the velocity of the particular parts  we must divide the product of the number of cogs in the  driving wheels  by the product of the number of cogs in the  dri∣ven wheels  and the quotient will be the number of re∣volutions made by the last moved part for  one  of the first moving part  The whole is put in motion by an overshot water wheel feet diameter which makes from to revolutions per minute according to the supply of water on the axle of this water wheel is fixed a large spur wheel  aa  of cogs ¾ inches diameter which drives a castme∣tal pinion  b  of cogs inches diameter on the axis of which is placed another spur wheel  c  of cogs inches diameter that drives the castmetal pinion  d  of leaves inches diameter on the axis of which is fixed the cylinder DD feet diameter and feet long with the four projecting pieces of wood or switchers SSSS that switch or thresh the corn as de∣scribed above  Then × =  the revolutions of the cylinder for  one  of the water wheel  which multipled by  the medium revolutions of the water wheel per minute  gives  the revolutions of the cylinder per minute  this multiplied by  the number of switchers  View of the THRESHING MACHINE  Erected at Chillingham With the Circular Rake  ann  rs  Dressed Corn  Q  Light Corn  P  C  M  Straw  N  gives  the number of strokes per minute  And as the diameter of the cylinder is feet the cir∣cumference will be  therefore  the revolutions of the cy∣linder per minute  multiplied by  feet the circumference of the cylinder  gives  feet the velocity of the switchers per minute  The large spur wheel  a  also drives the light cog wheel  of cogs inches diameter fixed on the axis  kl  of the rake for taking away the straw  Then    =  the number of revolutions which the rake makes for one of the water wheel  multiplied by  the revolutions of the water wheel per minute  gives  nearly the revolutions of the rake per minute which having arms will clear the screen of straw times per minute  The Rollers  are moved by the pinion  b  of leaves working into the slight castmetal wheel  f  fixed on the iron axis  ii  of the lower roller on which axis is also fix∣ed a small pinion  g  of leaves working into another  h  of equal number fixed on the axis  This axis is fixed into the upper roller either by an universal joint or with a square tapering end to allow the upper roller to rise and fall according as the corn is fedin thicker or thinner and the concave board RE is hung on a bolt to allow it to rise and fall with the roller  of the upper roller which gives the two rollers an equable motion for taking in the corn  Then × =  the revolutions of the rollers for  one  of the water wheel  multiplied by     gives  the revolutions of the rollers per minute  And the diameter of the rollers being inches the circumference will be inches  therefore  inches the circumference of the rollers  multiplied by  the revolutions of the rollers per minute  gives  inches of straw passing thro' the rollers per minute which inches receive strokes of the switchers in that time or nearly three strokes to an inch  When the rollers are required to move swifter or slow∣er they may be driven very conveniently from the end of the axle of the rake by fixing a castmetal  faced wheel  on it with three rows of cogs and working into a shifting pinion of leaves fixed on an iron axle at the other end of which is put a small  bevel  wheel of teeth working into another of teeth on the end of the axle of the lower roller  The Fanners  are moved by a  crossed rope  passing over a pulley T inches diameter fixed on the axis of the cylinder and another V of inches diameter on the axis of the fanners Then as the axle of the cylinder makes revolutions per minute we have × = revolutions of the fanners per minute  From the above it appears that when  The water wheel makes ½ revolutions in minute  The cylinder will make ½ ditto  The rollers ½ nearly  The rake ditto and clears the skreen of straw times per minute  The fanners ¾ ditto  The switchers make strokes per minute and move with a velocity of feet per minute  The rollers take in nearly inches of corn per mi∣nute The medium length of good oats is about in∣ches and supposing half a sheaf put in at a time a whole sheaf will then be equal to inches  Therefore = sheaves per minute which agrees with the usual rate of going of this machine when sup∣plied with a  medium  quantity of water From some expe∣riments lately made sheaves of oats were threshed in minutes and yielded bushels which is at the rate of bushels per hour or  This must be considered as a medium quantity of short early oats bushels might be threshed in the same time and of wheat with long straw not more than bushels But a great deal depends on the care and  constant attention  of the feed∣er a trifling neglect in this point will make a considerable defi∣ciency in the above quantities which we find is too often the caseWhere there is plenty of water so that a whole sheaf may be put in at once the quantity will be double to the above  per day of hours  The expence  for the attendance on the threshing and dressing part of this machine is only that of three women viz One to feedin another to hand the sheaves to the feeder and the third to take away and riddle the corn after it is winnowed of course the expence of threshing and dressing bushels is only s d  The expence of threshing the same quantity by the flail would be one twentyfifth part  The wages here for threshing are one twentieth part of the grain when the thresher  folds or bundles up the straw  and one twentyfifth when the straw is  taken away loose  as fatt as he threshes it the thresher assists in winnowing and finds a woman for the same purpose the farmer finds a man and two women  or ½ bushels which at s per bushel is s to which must be added s the expence of a man and two women to assist in winnowing making in all s  The expence of erecting a threshing machine of this  kind was from to l but since the advance of wood iron and wages it will be now near l  Machines of small dimensions are erected for about l which with horses will thresh and dress bush∣els of oats or of wheat in hours  Rollers  or small  Millstones  are added to many of these machines for crushing or grinding grain for horses swine c Knives for cutting straw and many other useful appendages might be added  The Winnowing Machine  is in universal use here we believe very little if any corn is dressed by any other means They were first made by a farmer of a mechanical genius called ROGERS who lived at Cavers near Hawick and whose grandson now a carpenter there still makes them perhaps of as useful a form as any other person and at as low rates as from l s to l  Old Rogers we are told by his descendant happen∣ed in the year to see a machine thrown out of the way as useless in an old granary at Leith of which he took such notice that on his return home he set about making one the utility of which soon recommended it to many principal farmers in a few years they were u∣niversally used and are now become so absolutely neces∣sary where large quantities of corn are to be dressed that it would be attended with considerable inconvenience to do without them of such great utility has been the su∣perior discernment of this ingenious and unnoticed in∣dividual  The present Mr Rogers says he believes the machine his grandfather saw at Leith was brought from Holland An anonymous remarker who signs himself a Scotch Far∣mer states "that it was first introduced by the late cele∣brated Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun along with the bar∣ley mill from Holland in the year " and we have somewhere read or heard that the Dutch brought it  from the Chinese which is corroborated by the informa∣tion we lately received from the Honourable Mr Doug∣lass  A son of the Earl of Selkirk  who was shewn when on his travels in France by the late Duke de Rochefoucalt a set of Chinese drawings representing the culture of rice in all its stages from the first planting to its being prepared for sale and that the last drawing was a representation of the  dressing  or  win∣nowing  which was performed by a  machine exactly similar to that we now use for the same purpose  Dr Desagulier's blowing wheel which he presented to the Royal Society in is exactly on the same prin∣ciples  Two men and three women will winnow dress and measure up into sacks bushels of oats or bushels of wheat per daythe expence s d  A pair of pruning shears  represented in fig pl have been particularly recommended by Mr Tweddell of Threepwood to the President of the Board as being su∣perior to any other implement for the purpose of cutting hedgesThey consist of a strong sharp knise inches long moving betwixt two squareedged cheeks the up∣per handle is feet inches long and the other feet inches  There are many other implements used in this county but as we believe most of them are such as are well known in other parts of the kingdom it would be of little use to describe them here  CHAPTER VI  INCLOSURES  THE parts of this county capable of cultivation are in  general well inclosed by live hedges the only exception is a small part of the vales of Breamish Till and Glen but even here the advantage of having wellfenced fields is so well understood and so much desired by the tenants that we hope in eight or ten years the whole of this valuable district will be inclosed by proper fences  The size of inclosures varies with the size of farms In some parts from two to six or eight acres in the nor∣thern parts where the farms are large the fields are from to acres  The fences  most generally used for new inclosures are earth mounds at the base of which and on the edge of the ditch out of which they are raised are planted the quicks generally upon a turned sod six inches high which we think too low as we always find the quicks grow much better when planted three sods high with the thickness of two surface sods laid under their roots This in most cases doubles and in thin soil trebles the surface soil and forms a thick bed of the best earth for the roots of the quicks to grow in as will be more clearly seen in the annexed sketch of such a sence fig pl where AB is the ditch ½ feet wide at top BCD the mound the base BD six feet wide and height CD four feet Q the quicks planted upon three turned sods at least inches high with surface sods and soil in∣ches thick under and behind their rootsThe expence of making this kind of fence is s d per rood of yards exclusive of quicks and railing  The quicks should never be planted nearer each other than nine inches and upon good land a foot Quicks four or five years old with strong clean stems are always to be preferred to those that are younger and smaller  It is a custom in some parts to clip young quicks every year this makes the fence look neat and snug but it checks their growth and keeps them always weak in the  Plate V  Fig  Fig  Fig  Fig  Fig  Fig  stem and when they grow old open at bottom while those that are left to nature get strong stems and side bran∣ches which by interweaving one with another make a thick and impenetrable hedge and if cut at proper inter∣vals of nine or ten years will always maintain its supe∣riority over those that have been clipped from their first planting In point of profit and of labour saved there is no comparison and for beauty we prefer nature and think a luxuriant hawthorn in full bloom or loaden with its ripened fruit is a more pleasing enlivening and gra∣tifying object than the stiff formal sameness produced by the shears of a gardener  Walter Trevelyan  Esq  of NetherWitton shewed us a new mode of raising fencesHe erects an earth mound fig pl feet wide at bottom AB feet wide at top CD and feet high on the middle of the top he plants a row of quicks Q and on each side at feet dis∣tance puts in willow slakes WW an inch in diameter and ½ or ft long sloping outwards which take root and form a live fence for the preservation of the quicks in the middle These stakes are at first bound together by a kind of oddering at the time we saw them they had been only two years done of course no judgment could be formed for some years to come whether it possessed superior advantages to the mode abovedescribed It ap∣peared to us an experiment yet undetermined In some situations we are inclined to believe it may be very use∣ful especially in cold soft marshy soils Whether it will be superior in all we still entertain some doubts but are persuaded that a full trial will be given by the spirited improver who is making the experimentThe expence is s d per rood of yards  Stone Walls  are also used for fences in some situations the usual dimensions are ½ feet at bottom or in∣ches at top and to ½ feet high About half way up  a row of throughstones are put at the rate of or in a rood of yards and on the top a coping of sods or stones  set edgeways  the latter is preferable as being the most lasting and presenting a more awful aspect to de∣ter the Highland sheep from attempting to leap them The  expence  of making these walls is from s d to s d a rood of yards for  winning and walling  The expence of leading depends on the distanceTwelve or fourteen cart load will do a rood  The advantages of inclosing  private property in this coun∣ty principally arise from separating lands of different qua∣lities which can by these means be employed in such culture or depastured by such stock as the occupier thinks most suitable and where sheep are kept they feed with more facility and readiness being freed from the whims of the shepherd and the teazings of his dog and by separating the dry ground from the wet a stockmaster has it more in his power to avoid that fatal mala∣dy the rot  Gates  are made of various forms but agree nearly in size being generally ½ feet wide and from ¼ to feet high with strong bars about ½ inches deep and a weaker one about inch square placed between the two lowest barsThe lighter a gate is especially in the fore∣part the better provided it be sufficiently strong for this reason the top bar should be considerably stronger than the rest as it is the most liable to be broken espe∣cially where horses are kept if not made so high that they cannot easily get their necks over it The most approved form is that represented fig pl  Hanging Gates  so as to have a proper fall or tendency to shut of themselves being little understood by carpen∣ters we hope the following directions for effecting that purpose may be acceptable  Having set the post perpendicular let a plumbline  AB be drawn upon it on this line at a proper height place the hook C so that it may project ½ inches from the face of the post and at a convenient distance below this place the lower hook D ½ inches  to one side of the perpendicular line  and projecting inches from the face of the post then place the top loop or eye inches from the face of the  "hawtree"  and the bottom loop ½ in∣chesThus hung the gate will have a tendency to shut in every position  For if the weight of the gate be represented by the line CD fig pl this by the resolution of forces is resolvable into other two CE and DE the former representing that part of the weight which presses in a perpendicular position and the latter that part of the weight which presses in a horizontal direction and gives the gate a tendency to shut  This principle has been long known and practised in hanging gates that open both ways  CHAPTER VII  ARABLE LAND  SECT  Tillage  THE arable lands of this county being under various systems and directed by various opinions the manage∣ment of the tillage must differ considerablyIn the oper∣ation of ploughing it is generally agreed that the breadth of the furrow should be about inches and the depth from to or inches  It was formerly the general practice not to plough the lands intended for fallow till after Spring seedtime and very often delayed till May or even June but now the fallows are ploughed before Winter to meliorate by the frostIn the middle of April or beginning of May those that are intended for  turnips  or  potatoes  are harrow∣ed  and ploughed  across  and where necessary rolled with a heavy roller the same operations are repeated two or three or more times until it is thought sufficiently fine and clean for sowing or planting  Those that are intended to be naked sallow for wheat receive three four of five ploughings through the Sum∣mer but are seldom harrowed it being thought an ad∣vantage to wheat to have the land cloddy  On those fallows where quickens or couch grass c are found every exertion is used to extirpate them by harrowing gathering and burning or leading off so long as the smallest remains are visible The lime and manure are mostly laid on before the last ploughing  For barley it is the general custom to plough only once but the best cultivators seldom sow this grain with∣out giving two or three ploughings especially when the land is to be sown with clover and grass feeds  Every other species of grain is sown after one plough∣ing except when beans or pease are to be drilled  Trench Ploughing  is practised by a few it is an excel∣len mode for breaking up grass lands and is performed by two ploughs following each other in the same furrow the first plough paring off the surface from to ½ inches thick and turning it into the bottom of the lastmade furrow While the second plough going or inches deeper turns upon it a sod of friable earth which being destitute of tough fibrous roots harrows to a sine mould with little difficulty  This practice entirely obviates the objections to drilling upon clover lea and the additional expence will not be more than s per acre which put in competition with the advantages to be derived from it will leave a consider∣able balance in favour of the practice in breaking up old swards on clayey lands the expence is almost saved in the harrowing on such soils it will be found of great  service if they are  thus ploughed  in Autumn they may be easily drilled with beans or pease in the Spring and the subsequent hoeings performed with facility operations that would be very difficult to perform when ploughed in the manner usually practised  The Ridges  are of various forms and sizesOn the deep soiled lands that were used as arable some centuries since the ridges are mostly very high broad and crook∣ed  It is a dangerous experiment to attempt to level and straight∣en ridges of this description too suddenly we have seen much mischief done by it  upon lands that have been lately brought into cul∣tivation they are straight nearly flat and in general a∣bout twelve or fifteen feet broad on dry lands they are quite flat and alternately gathered and split A breadth of fifteen feet answers best for sowing broadcast at two casts  A few years since the ploughing and various other purposes for which draughts are wanted upon a farm were performed by horses which in ploughing or harrow∣ing are always yoked double and driven with cords by the ploughman and in general plough an acre a day but in the season of sowing turnips one and a half or even two acres are frequently ploughed on  fine light soils  But since the great advance in the price of horses oxen have been more used especially for the purposes of ploughing and carting  about home  They are harnessed both with yokes and collars Where three or four are used a boy is allowed to drive when two  Two oxen are sound very sufficient for ploughing light fal∣low lands in Summer but for almost every other purpose or are used  the man that holds the plough drives with cords They only plough  half a day at a time  one half of a team being used in the forenoon and the other in the afternoon  SECT  Fallowing  The practice of making naked fallows on all kinds of soils once in or years was general thro' this county till the introduction of turnips in a few years the fallows of the dry lands were covered with this valuable plant On such other soils as were found improper for this root the naked fallows still prevail with an almost universal opinion that it is absolutely necessary to the fertility of the land yet there are some few who dare to doubt this longestablished doctrine and presume to think that na∣ked fallows might be dispensed with in  many situations  by cultivating leguminous crops  drilled at wide intervals  to admit being  ploughed  or  horsehoed  between to which if  proper handhoeings  be added the land will be as well pre∣pared for wheat as if it had been a compleat naked fallow  This is not advanced on speculation or theory instan∣ces can be produced where no naked fallows have been made on fields of strong loam for years yet they are as clear of quickens couchgrass or other pernicious weeds as any fields in the district that have been under naked fallow two or three times in the same period  It may be necessary to observe that previous to the adop∣tion of this system the land was cleared of quicken or couchgrass by a complete summer fallowing  Whether fallowing is or is not necessary has been much agitated of late years so much so that the diffe∣rent partisans have obtained the appellation of  "fallow∣ests"  and  "antifallowests"  It happens to be one of those subjects which can never be determined by reasoning o∣pinions or bold assertions  fair experiments  only can resolve it and whatever may be the results of such ex∣periments  it may be justly concluded they will be the same in similar soils climates and situations  Tho' we are diffident in giving a decided opinion up∣on so important a subject yet from observations made on the above facts we cannot help being inclined to think that the quantity of maked fallow might be very much reduced and in another century will probably be totally abolished if no fortuitous circumstances arise to check the exertions and spirit for improvement which have been so prevalent of late years and so generally dif∣fused thro' this district  SECT  Rotation of Crops  The most prevailing rotation was  fallow  wheat  oats  fallow c  repeated for two three or four fallowingsUpon the strong lands along the seacoast instead of oats after wheat they generally substitute pease or beans or beans and pease mixed when laid down to grass it is sown with grass seeds and continued in grass seven or more years  On dry soils  after ploughing out from grass the rota∣tion was  Oats  Oats  Turnips sown broadcast limed and dung∣ed and twice handhoed  Barley or wheat sown up with clover and raygrass and continued in grass from four to seven or more years depastured principally with  sheep  The  best cultivators  use the following rotations accor∣ding to soil situation and circumstances  Clayey soils  Fallow  Wheat  Clover for or years depastured with  sheep  Beans or pease  Strong loams  Turnips drilled at inches intervals  Barley  Clover and grass seeds for or years depastured with sheep and a small proportion of cattle  Oats  Beans or pease drilled at ins in∣tervals horse and handhoed  Wheat drilled from to ins inter∣vals horse and handhoed  Sandy and dry light loams  after being ploughed out from grass  Oats  Turnips drilled at ins intervals  Barley or wheat drilled from to ins intervals hoed and sown up with clover and grassseeds depastu∣red with sheep and a small propor∣tion of cattle for  three  or  more years  This last rotation has been practised of late years and is becoming more general not only upon the turnip soils but upon the strong clayey lands substituting naked fal∣lows or beans drilled at ins intervals instead of tur∣nips and those who have tried it on such strong lands find that after two or three years clover and grass seeds depastured with sheep the land will grow good crops of oats which they could never get it to do under their old system  Those who have practised the Norfolk system on thin light soils find their crops grow worse especially the tur∣nips and clover and many have been obliged to adopt this system by which they find their lands renovated  and instead of having to complain that their soil was  "tired of turnips and clover'  they now find that it pro∣duces abundant crops and that every rotation brings it nearer its former fertility  SECT  Crops commonly cultivated  WHEAT  The preparation  for the greatest quantity of wheat rai∣sed in this county is naked summer fallowOf late years considerable quantities have been grown after tur∣nips it is also grown after rape clover beans pease tares and potatoes  The kinds of wheat  grown here include many varieties and as they are known by different names in different dis∣tricts we are afraid that by barely mentioning their names a very different variety may be taken for the one we mean and tho' we despair of pointing out such marked distinctions as accurately to distinguish them in all cases the shades of difference being often very small yet we hope there are some leading features which may help us to attempt an arrangement and in some measure bet∣ter enable our readers to ascertain the variety intended for this purpose we shall divide them into  two orders  viz the  smooth chaffed  and the  downy chaffed  of which we shall enumerate the principal varieties now grown in this district  We could wish to see this subject undertaken by Professor Martin who is well qualified to do it justice  Smooth chaffed  with a few short awns towards the top of the ear  Zealand  ears long and large spicula very wide set in ¾ inches chaff white sometimes with a tinge of brown  opening and shewing the grain straw very long grain white and large  WhiteKent  ears middle sized spicula in ¼ inches chaff white opening and shewing the grain when ripe straw shorter than the last grain white  Golden ear  ears short spicula very close set in ¾ inches chaff a yellowish light brown short the grain white and easily shook out by the wind  Burwellred  ears long and large spicula very wide set in ¾ inches chaff a dark brown red large and closed on the grain straw long grain red  This variety has been much used of late years especially upon crude or newly broke up lands with great success and has in a manner superseded the common red wheat  II Downy chaffed  with a few short awns towards the top of the ear  Woollyear  ears middle sized spicula close set in inches chaff white closed on the grain straw long grain white  Velvet ear or little wheat  ears small spicula close set in ¾ inches chaff white closed on the grain straw short grain white smaller shorter and plumper than the last  The form of the grain of this variety is the most perfect of any other we have seen and from the shortness of the straw it is the best adapted to sow upon rich soils where there is a danger of the crop lodging  and the appearance of the ear is less in every dimension  The downy chaffed wheats have shorter straw and are less liable to have the grain shaken out by winds the chaff embracing the grain more closely than the smooth chaffed tribes which is a considerable advantage but then we are apprehensive that this downiness makes them retain the dews and moisture upon the ear much longer  than the smooth chaffed kinds and probably renders them much more liable to be affected by those diseases which give a dusky dark shade to the chaff and a rusty cankering upon the straw as we recollect few instances of smooth chaffed or red wheat being troubled with this disease of course the downy chaffed kinds are most pro∣per for windy open situations and the smooth chaffed to well sheltered inclosed districts  The seed  is selected with great attention from the most perfect samples and the practice of changing seed is thought advantageous for this purpose more or less new seed is every year imported from distant parts as Kent Essex Huntingdonshire Cambridgeshire cNew seed is preferred to old and that immediately after being threshed rather than what has lain long in a granary  Steeping  in chamberlye and powdering with quick lime immediately after to make it sufficiently dry for sowing is generally practised the smut is seldom seen where this is properly performed  In a practice of years the Messrs Culley have only had one instance of smut in their crops of wheat and this was where the seed had not been steeped and for a number of years they have not grown less than from four hundred to six hundred acres yearly  and some go so far as to say that it will cure smutty seed  A field at Chillingham was sown in with wheat in which were  a few balls of smut  onethird of the seed was steep∣ed in chamberlye and limed onethird steeped in chamberlye dried and not limed the remainder was sown without either steeping or liming in the harvest of the whole had a few straggling heads of smut but appeared to be most in that which was unsteepedMr Thompson of Chillingham Barns made a si∣milar experiment and had smut equally alike in the pickled and unpickled but the  head ridges were considerably the worst  from hence it appears that steeping in chamberlye is not a prevent∣ive in all casesIt may be proper to remark that there are more complaints of smut this year than any other we remember in some places even barley was very much affectedWe believe that on examination the stamina will always be found adhering to the balls of smut from which a suspicion arises that the cause may be ow∣ing to some defect in those parts probably from injuries re∣ceived by insects weather c as we frequently find the same ear bearing the most perfect grains along with grains of smut The same experiment was repeated in and intended to be continued for some years  it is done by throwing the  wheat into a vessel full of chamberlye stirring it about with a strong stick and skimming off the light grains as they appear on the surface when this is done the liquor is let off by a plug or cock at the bottom of the vessel and the wheat taken out and mixed with quick lime after this the sooner it is sown the better because it is apt to heat and spoil if suffered to continue in the sacks or in large heaps but if dried and spread thin on a gra∣nary floor will keep several days  If the grain remains too long in very putrid chamber∣lye its vegetative powers will be injured or mi∣nutes are as long as it should be suffered to continue  The quantity sown  is from two to three bushels per acre  broadcast  according to times of sowing nature and condition of the land cThose who drill at or inch intervals find ½ bush per acre amply sufficient  The time of sowing  on the lands that receive a naked summer fallow is September and October after  drilled beans  October and November and after  turnips  all thro' the winter as the land is cleared and weather suitable until the middle of MarchIn the year many hundred acres were sown in Glendale Ward so late as  the beginning of April  which was all well harvested and pro∣duced on an average about bush per acre of excel∣lent grain in many cases superior to that sown in the autumn which was rather singular as it is generally ex∣pected that wheat sown so late does not produce the grain so well perfected as that which is sown earlierThis lateness of sowing was occasioned by the snow lying so late in the springAnd we are disposed to think from  many experiments that on those light soils the month of February is the best and safest seedtime for wheat mas∣lin and rye of all others in the year  For spring sowing  the golden ear and the Burwellred wheats are preferred to all others except where the land is in such high condition as to endanger the crop lodging then the velvet ear is used as not being so apt to lodge from the shortness of the straw  In February a field of acres was sown after turnips with wheat a part with  Zealand  the remainder with  Velvet∣ear  the produce from the Zealand was  bushels per acre  the Velvetear  bushels  but the latter was injured by a blight which was attributed to the moisture hanging longer on the chaff of the Velvetear than on the other from which it appears that even Zealand wheat may be sown in the spring with advantage the grain was as well perfected as heavy and sold for as high a price as any shewn in the market that season  The  Triticum Aestivum  Si∣berian wheat or springwheat was introduced and strong∣ly recommended about twenty years since but wherever we have seen it tried the crops have been uncertain and produce small and tho' this flinty kind will ripen if sown even as late as April or beginning of May yet it has not been able to maintain a struggle with the varieties above specified and is now totally given up  The culture whilst growing  of the broadcast crops con∣sists only in handweedingSuch as are drilled are hoed once or twice as well as handweeded where want∣ed These hoeings not only destroy the weeds but make a fine preparation for the clover and grass seeds which seldom fail where this operation is properly performed  For drilling  we find that ridges of inches wide are the most convenient on these we drill or rows the horse going in the furrow or rows are deposited on each side and being afterwards deeply waterfurrow∣ed the land is kept much drier through the Winter than when in broader ridges a matter of considerable import∣ance to a wheat crop on moist soils  The produce  varies considerably according to soils seasons culture c from to bush per acre may be taken as a fair average crop under favourable circumstances as high as and even bush per acre sometimes occur  The manufacture  of wheat into flour for exportation is principally carried on at Alemouth Waren and a few mills near Berwick what is done in the vicinity of New∣castle and other places is principally for home consump∣tion  RYE  Was formerly the principal grain grown upon all the dry sandy and light soils but since the use of lime and the introduction of turnips and artificial grasses it is rare∣ly cultivated  xcept upon  very sandy  soils  The soils which formerly were occupied in growing rye are now so much consolidated and improved by the use of lime that they produce abundant crops of excellent wheat several thou∣sand acres of which are now grown every year after turnips where thirty years since scarce a single bushel was ever produ∣ced  it is sown af∣ter turnips or clover from September all through the winter till the beginning of April  The quantity sown  is about two bushels per acre  The produce  from twenty to thirty bushels per acre  Upon lands intended for turnips next summer it is frequently sown in August and September along with rape as spring feed for sheep which often proves very valuable in the month of April  Manufacture  The principal part of the rye grown in this district as well as considerable quantities imported from abroad is consumed in the southern parts of the county it being the most general bread of the labouring people in that quarterAfter being leavened until it gains a considerable degree of acidity it is made into loaves and baked in a large brick oven or made into  thick cakes ½ or inches thick called "four cakes" and baked on the girdleThe bread is very firm and so∣lid dark coloured and retains its moisture or juciness longer than any other bread we know  MASLIN  That is wheat and rye mixed is sown in some parts of the county the preparation quantity sown and pro∣duce are much the same as wheat its application is for household bread for which purpose many people think it superior to wheat alone especially when the propor∣tion of rye is betwixt ¼ and ⅓ of the whole  It has been remarked that when wheat and rye are grown mixed in this manner the grains of each are larg∣er and more perfect than when grown singly without any admixture  BARLEY  Is generally sown after turnipsIn Glendale Ward a few farmers cultivate it in drills with or inch inter∣vals  The kinds  most commonly cultivated are  st  The common long ear'd barley  which being early productive and best liked by the maltsters is by far the most prevalentThis variety is distinguished from the next by the skin having a light red or purplish tinge a little before it is ripe and being marked with dark red lines running longitudinally along the back of the grain and may be called the  red stroked  or  dark skinned barley  d  A variety of the long ear'd barley  the awns of which drop or are easily shaken off when ripe from the grain being shorter plumper and rounder bodied than the com∣mon sort it is preferred by the millers for making in∣to pearl barleyThis variety ripens later than the com∣mon  kind or red stroked barley by near a fortnight and is distinguished from it by the grains being closer set and the skin having a light yellowish tinge and not being marked by  dark red  lines it is also shorter in the straw and may be called the  yellow  or  paleskinned  longear'd barley  d  Battledoor or spratbarley  is sometimes grown and is preferred for sowing upon land in high condition where there is a danger of the other kinds lodging it is about three weeks later of ripening than the common kind  th  Bear bigg or fourrowed barley  used to be the on∣ly species of barley cultivated in the countyIt is now rarely sown except upon raw crude soils on which it is found to answer better than any other more especially if late sown owing to the turnips having been kept long∣er than usual in a cold backward spring for the use of the feeding and store stock  The quantity sown  is from to bushels per acre broad∣cast when drilled at to inch intervals it is found that from ½ to bushels per acre is sufficient  The time of sowing  from the beginning of April to the latter end of May  The produce  from to bush per acre  Manufacture  Great quantities are made into  pot or shelled barley  not only for home consumption but for ex∣portation In the northern parts of the county very few corn mills are now to be found without the appendage of a barley mill  Barley or barley mixed with grey pease or beans is the common bread of labouring people in the northern parts of this county previous to grinding they are mix∣ed in the proportion of two parts barley and one of pease or beans after being ground the meal is sifted thro' a  fine sieve made of wood to take out the rough husks and coarse bran it is then kneaded with water made in∣to thin  unleavened cakes  and immediately baked on a girdle over the fire  In this district barley or mixed meal is seldom if ever  leavened  and  baked in loaves  OATS  Are universally grown throughout every part of the county they are sown after every species of grain as well as grass or clover lea  The varieties  usually cultivated are  st Poland oat  a variety of which called  Church's oat  from the name of the person  Mr Church first had them from Mr James Robson appren∣tice of Messrs Culley who brought them out of Scotland and gave Mr Church a handful those he brought to Fenton were lost  who first introduced them are now in high estimation and are the best early oat yet known for sowing upon loamy lands in good condition they are early very productive and much liked by the millers who give twopence per bushel more for them than the common oat This variety is known by the grains being remarkably short large plump round and well filled and not in the least tailed a bushel generally weighs lb  d  The Dutch Friezland or Holland Oat  were al∣most the only species of early oats grown here before the introduction of the Church oat they are now only grown upon dry light lands to which they are better adapted than the Poland oat  d  Peebles Oat  In some places it is called the red oat probably from its be∣ing not so fair as the common oat but it is very different from the red oat grown in the midland counties and ought not to be called by the same name For this reason we call it Peebles Oat  A variety of common oat but much  earlier has been lately introduced from Peebles shire in Scotland it is a very proper oat for hilly districts not only for its earliness but in not being easily shaken by the wind The grains are the smallest of any other oat we know but from the very thin skin it meals well and is liked by the millers and ripens nearly as early as the dutch oat  th  Common Oat  The best seed of this kind of oat is got from Blainsley in Scotland  is grown upon all such lands as are not thought in sufficient condition for the Poland or Dutch kind  th  Angus Oat  A variety of common oat has been introduced of late years from Angusshire it is a better bodied grain than the common oat produces more straw and answers very well in early situations But its being later in ripening than the common oat will militate a∣gainst its general adoption in a country where early har∣vests are so desirable This oat answers beyond every other in poor dry rabbit warren soils from its throwing up so much straw and on such soils ripens early enough  th  Tartarian Oats  after several trials by different people about years since were given up on account of the inferiority of the grain and the strong reedy straw being of little value for fodder We now find them cul∣tivated in the midland parts of the county on rather an extensive scale being found there more productive than any other kind they have tried they speak of some crops being as high as bushels an acre but we suspect these are under peculiarly favourable circumstances as we find that in comparison with Angus oats both grown in the same field in the year they produced no more than bushels per acre tho' estimated by a strong advocate for them at near double that quantity the Angus oats  were more productive per acre and worth more to the millers by d per bushel  th  Black Oats  are seldom grown in this district we do not remember seeing them more than three or four times and then only by way of experiment  In point of earliness they succeed each other as classed above the Angus oat being at least three or four weeks later than the Poland and Dutch  The quantity sown  in general is seven bushels per acre of the Poland and six of the Dutch oats These quan∣tities are necessary as they do not tiller much and are large bodied grain but for the other kinds we think four or five bushels sufficient  The time of sowing  is March or April and the early kinds are sown sometimes as late as the middle of May  The produce  of common oats is from twenty to forty bushels per acre of the Poland and Dutch from forty to sixty There are some instances of seventy or eighty bushels per acre but these were generally attended with some favourable circumstances  We have been informed by a principal corn merchant in Berwick that the oats grown in Glendale are fold in the Lon∣don market for s d per quarter more than any other oats presented there  On fresh land and crude moory soils oats are proba∣bly the most profitable crop that can be sown old wornout tillage and strong clay land are improper for pro∣ducing this grain it being found that in such situations they are scarce worth cultivating such soils are much better adapted to the culture of wheat pease beans vetches and other leguminous crops  The Manufacture  of Oatmeal is carried on to a con∣siderable extent both for exportation and home consump∣tion oatmeal being a principal article of food with the great mass of inhabitants not as bread but in  crowdies  or  hastypudding  provincially  "meal kail"  for breakfast and supper the former is made by pouring boiling water upon the oatmeal and stirring it in with a stick or spoon shank till it be so very stiff that the stirring implement can with difficulty be got round it is then eaten with butter or milk this is the breakfast of many of the la∣bouring people especially in the southern parts of the county and with which they reckon they can work long∣er hours than with hastypudding or a breakfast of bread and milk  HastyPudding  is made by putting oatmeal gradually in∣to boiling water and stirring it about with a peeled stick  "thivel"  and letting it continue to boil in that thick∣ened state until sufficiently enough when it is taken off the sire and poured out of the pan into pots or dishes to cool and then eaten with butter or more commonly skimmed milk it is an agreeable nutritive and healthy food and is the general breakfast and supper of the la∣bouring people in the northern parts of the county  BEANS  Have time immemotial been a prevailing crop upon all the strong lands in the county especially along the  sea coast  to the southward they generally succeed wheat clover or old grass  The kinds cultivated  are the large and the small horse bean and sometimes the mazagan they are sown in February four bushels and a half per acre  broad cast  and never hoed The produce very uncertain bushels per acre a fair average  broadcast  crop  In this district the soil of which is so well adapted to the growth of beans it is surprising that drilling them should be totally neglected and that this beneficial mode of culture for both beans and pease should be confined to  a few farmers in Glendale Ward and TweedSide With these few they are drilled from to inches distance  horsehoed  or  ploughed between  and  handhoed  the crops good and the wheat that succeeds equal to that upon the summer fallows adjoining We find that two or three ploughings or horsehoeings between the rows and twice handhoeing in the rows are generally sufficient  The first horsehoeing or ploughing takes the earth from the rows and the second turns it back again to earth up the beans which are then in full bloom and from to inches high If the land be so very hard that a plough cannot penetrate it the horsehoe described page must be first used  Where beans are intended to be drilled we plough the land in Autumn immediately after the corn is off gathering each ridge and harrowing it lengthways then set it up in onebout ridges at inches distance and if the land be in  broad high ridges  directly  across the ridges  water furrowing after the whole is done and opening the hollow intervals into the water furrows this keeps the land dry and exposes the greatest quantity of surface to the influence of the atmosphere and amelioration of frosts  If any dung or manure be intended for the fallow we put it in the hollow intervals and cover it by splitting the onebout ridges with the plough and drawing a harrow once over in the direction of the onebout ridges the beans are then drilled upon them by the drill plough  fig    pl    A field that in the usual rotation would have been naked fallow was thus prepared after oats and in February drilled at inches with large horse beans bushels per acre the produce in November it was drilled with wheat ½ bushels per acre at inch intervals which was reaped in September following the produce bushels per acre in another field was drilled with beans at inch intervals the produce bushels per acre and in November drilled with wheat at inch intervals The crop in July is promis∣ing to be at least bushels per acre and both fields are as clean or clear of quickens or other weeds as any lands in the county that were naked fallow One of them has been under this system for upwards of ten years  Where the land is level it may be ploughed into ridges of or inches wide on the former with the large drill  fig    pl  we drill two rows of beans and on the latter three In the first case the horse goes  in the furrow  and the machine drills a row on each side of it the distance of the rows inches in the latter case the horse may go  on the top  of the ridge or what is better two horses may be yoked to it so that one may go in each furrow  PEASE  Were formerly a more general crop than at present they are mostly grown upon such lands as have been worn out by running too long in ploughing  On such old tillage lands it is found that wheat pease vetches or tares are the only species of grain that can be raised to advantage  The early and late grey pea are the only kinds cultivated here the latter is usually sown in February or March and the for∣mer in April three bushels is the quantity sown per acre broad cast and the quantity reaped depends very much on seasons no grain being so uncertain a crop as pease A good crop is reckoned at twentyfive to thirty bushels per acre They are also cultivated in drills from to inch intervals and horse and handhoed  Spring Tares  are grown principally for cutting as green food for horses to supply the vacancy between the first and second cutting of red clover used for the same purpose and for the same intention  Winter Tares  have been lately introduced and promise to answer well both kinds are grown upon the fallow lands intended for wheat or late turnipsThe winter tares are sown in September and the other in March  POTATOES  Of this invaluable root the varieties cultiviated here are very numerous and frequently changing many of the kinds that were formerly in repute being now in a manner lost as the  true kidney  the  rough white  the  blood red  the  tawny c  and their places supplied by others  For the Table  the sorts most in repute at present are three or four different kinds of long whites one of which having a red end is called  redsnout  or  redneb  and several sorts of round whites and the  pinkeye  or red streak which is a late potatoe and the best for eating in the spring of any we knowit is frequently used till the beginning of July  For Stock  the principal kinds used are the  champion  and the  blackamoor  or  blackpotatoe  They are generally cultivated in drills from to inches distance whole potatoes are seldom or never used for sets but cut into pieces containing one or two sprouts or eyes These are planted about inches distance in the bottom of the drill the dung laid upon them and the soil turned upon the whole by the plough splitting the onebout ridges They are kept clean by handhoeing and ploughing between the drills and as the stems advance in height they are earthed up by a common or double mould board plough with which im∣plements they are frequently taken up by splitting the drills in which they grow and the roots gathered by wo∣men and children  They are seldom grown for the use of stock except for horses to which they are given raw  The practice of preparing potatoes by steam has not yet taken place in this county we believe it would be a material improvement  after the rate of two pecks per day each horse and found very useful in the spring when the straw and hay become dry and are serviceable for preventing grease or other disorders by keeping the horses cool and open They are sometimes given to cattle and sheep in the spring when a scarcity of turnips prevails  The mode of preserving them  thro' the winter is by lay∣ing them in heaps upon a piece of dry ground and cover∣ing them with straw or inches thick and over the straw another cover of soil about a foot thick which soil is got by making a ditch from to inches deep round the heap A bed of straw should be laid at the bottom  TURNIPS  Have not been used in this county as food for support∣ing cattle and sheep much above seventy years  Mr Edward Nisbet who is now near years of age says that it is  upwards of    years  since Mr Proctor the proprietor of Rock brought  Andrew Willey  a gardener to cultivate turnips at Rock for the purpose of feeding cattle that Willey afterwards settled at Lesbury as a gardener and was employed for many years to sow turnips for all the neighbourhood and his business this way was so great he was obliged to ride and sow that he might dispatch the greater quantity The practice of hoeing was also introduced at this time  for this purpose they were first grown in the northern parts of the county it is but of late years they have been cul∣tivated on part of Tyneside  The varieties  are the Green Top the Red Top and the White Top which last is by far the most general  and in the greatest repute being superior to the others in size and sweetness  There is a small hard white kind preferred by some on account it is said of standing the winter better than most others but it does not grow near so large a quantity upon an acre  At their first introduction they were sown broadcast and hoed by gardeners and other men at extrava∣gant wages The late ingenious Mr Ilderton about twentyseven years since had the merit of first reducing the price of hoeing by teaching boys girls and women to perform the work equally as well if not better than men The mode he took was simple and ingenious By a light plough without a mouldboard he divided the field into small squares of equal magnitude and directed the boys and girls to leave a certain number of plants in each square In a short time they became accurate re∣gular and expert hoers and in a few years all the tur∣nips of the country were hoed by women and boys at half the expence and better than by men  The present mode of drilling turnips was first introdu∣ced into this county about the year the advantages with which it is attended have so far recommended the practice that very few are now sown broadcast  The broadcast culture of turnips in the northern parts of the county for many years previous to this was not inferior to any we ever saw and in respect to  accurate regular clean hoeing  superior to what we ever observed in  Norfolk Suffolk  or other turnip districts which we have frequently examined  and as we think it is an operation that may be serviceable in o∣ther districts we shall be more particular in describing the manner of performing it  The land being made sine prepared c as in the broadcast method the ploughman draws his first furrow as straight as possible In returning he keeps his far side  horse in the new made furrow and his plough at such a distance as to form a onebout ridge like Λ by pro∣ceeding in this manner the land when finished will ap∣pear thus ΛΛΛΛΛΛΛΛ The distance of these little ridges is from twentyseven to thirty inches A less dis∣tance does not admit of ploughing between the drills  The next operation is spreading the dung which is performed by a cart going down every third or fifth fur∣row and laying the dung in small heaps women and boys follow with small threepronged forks and spread it evenly in the bottom of three or five furrows that is the one where the dung is dropped from the cart and those on each side of it this done the ploughman splits the onebout ridges before raised and covers up the dung ex∣actly in the middle but before the seed can be sown these last formed onebout ridges require to be flattened at the top by a small roller that flattens two ridges at once Upon the top and exactly in the middle of these flattened ridges the seed is deposited by one or two drill machines tied to the roller by a rope six or seven feet long at which distance they follow the roller each ma∣chine being guided by a man  See fig pl  When finished the work appears in this form  Where S represents the feed and D the dung directly under it which is wholly employed in promoting the ve∣getation of the turnips  The roller is drawn by one horse driven by a boy Setting up the ridges and covering in the dung is per∣formed by a common swing plough The quantity of  seed sown from one to two pound per acre it being bet∣ter to have an abundance of plants for fear of accidents The quantity of dung used is from ten to fifteen twohorse cartloads per acre  When the plants have four leaves we begin to hoe and as they have so much room sideways we leave them only eight or nine inches distance from one another in the rows or drills The hoers go sideways and pull the sur∣plus plants weeds c into the hollow intervals between the onebout ridges and the turnips are left as regular as if they were planted This work is performed by women and children with the greatest care and exactness at the expence of four shillings per acre  As soon as the plants are recovered which will be in eight or ten days a small plough  See fig pl  five inches wide at the bottom behind and eleven inches at top drawn by one horse takes the earth from the turnip rows and with the soil covers the weeds c which the hoers had pulled into the hollow intervals between the ridges A second hoeing takes place when the plants are strong enough and otherwise necessary and a few days after the soil or earth before ploughed from the turnip rows into the hol∣low intervals is now equally divided and laid up to each drill or ridge again by the same small plough and one horse or with a double mouldboard ploughThis fi∣nishes the business unless the land has been very wild and out of condition and requires more hoeing and ploughing between the drills  If the drills are made in the same directions of the rid∣ges at the next ploughing for corn the surface will be ir∣regular and the dung unequally distributed To avoid this on dry level lands the drills are made diagonally a∣cross the field but where the ridges are high it is best  to make the drills  directly across  the ridges and draw a plough down the furrows to take off the water  It is generally supposed that a weightier crop is produ∣ced by the drill than the broadcast method  Turnips drilled in this manner were sold in for l an acre for feeding cattle and sheep a much higher price than was given for any sown broadcast and we have known instances up∣on thin poor light soils that the crop of turnips was of more value than the fee simple of the land upon which they grew which we hope will remove the doubts of those who have sus∣pected that this mode would not answer upon weak thin soils To such soils it is certainly the best adapted of all others  but even admitting them equal in this respect the superiority as a fallow crop must be allowed to the drill for the repeat∣ed ploughings in the intervals and handhoeings in the rows effectually extirpate the whole race of annual weeds and so much surface being exposed through the winter makes a higher preparation for any succeeding crop A∣nother advantage is the facility with which they are hoed as a boy or girl nine or ten years old can hoe them with the greatest ease and generally better than expe∣rienced broadcast hoers who are apt to take too many plants away while the young ones from the apprehen∣sion of making them too thin will leave them at any dis∣tance you shew them  The application  of turnips in this county is mostly to feeding and rearing cattle and sheep and some small quan∣tities for raising seed  When used for cattle  they are always led off from where they grow being previously cleared of the earth and fib∣rous roots as they are pulled in order to keep them as clean as possible When the cattle are tied up in sheds which we think much better than being out in the fields they are foddered with turnips eight or nine times a day and with straw or hay twice great attention ought to be paid to keeping their cribs clean  When the convenience of sheds cannot be had they are given to the cattle in a dry grass field scattered as thin as circumstances will admit A crib with straw in it should be constantly in the field for the cattle to serve themselves whenever they chuse  For sheep  they are sometimes eaten upon the ground where they grow particularly if a dry light sandy soil but more generally led off into an adjoining field  The fields into which the turnips are led to be eaten are such as are intended to be ploughed up next year for wheat or oatsThus every field in rotation reaps the benefit of having the turnips eaten upon it which we find much preferable to the system of eating them upon the field where they grow  which we think a much better and more economical practice the sheep getting a daily regular supply of fresh food and the shells being kept clean are eaten by young cattle or those that are to be fattened next summer upon grass  Sometimes every other ridge is led off and the remain∣der eaten upon the ground where they grow  When eaten upon the ground the sheep are not turned upon the whole at once but have it portioned out to them by hurdles or nets so that they may have a fresh break once a week or ten days  For seed  the turnips of the best form are selected and transplanted in the month of October November or De∣cember into a piece of ground properly prepared to re∣ceive them in July or August following it is generally reaped tied up in sheaves and when dry put into a  long stack  where it is kept through the winter and threshed out in April or May  The trouble of selecting and transplanting is sometimes dispensed with but the seed raised in this manner is sold for onehalf or onethird the price of the transplanted  seed that is when the transplanted seed is sold for s per lb the other is sold for d or d  The produce is very variable being subject to many casualtiesThe average crop may be reckoned about bushels or half a ton per acreThe land should be good and well manured after the crop as we find the soil much impoverished by it  HISTORY  OF DRILLED TURNIPS  TO trace useful discoveries from their origin through their various stages of improvement is in most cases both useful and entertaining and teaches us not to despair though our first attempts may be unsuccessful but rather hope that by perseverance and varying modes and cir∣cumstances we shall at last attain the object sought for The method of cultivating turnips described above is an encouraging instance of this observationas we find that Mr Tull first cultivated turnips at three feet distancefor in his Essay on the Principles of Tillage and Vegeta∣tion under the article Turnips page he says "When I drilled upon the level  "It is impossible to hoeplough them so well when planted upon the level as when they are planted upon ridges for if we plough deep near to the row the earth will come over on the left side of the plough and bury the young turnips but when they stand on ridges the earth will almost all fall down on the right side into the furrow in the middle of the interval"  at three feet intervals a trial was made between those turnips and a field of the next neighbour's sown broadcast at the same time whereof  the handhoeing cost ten shillings per acre and had not quite half the crop of the drilled both being measured by the bushel on purpose to find the difference  "And I have since found that turnips on the same land plant∣ed on ridges with six foot intervals make a crop double to those that are planted on the level or even on ridges with three feet intervals"  "Drilled turnips by being no where but in the rows may be more easily seen that those which come up at ran∣dom and may therefore be sooner singled out by the handhoe which is another advantage because the soon∣er  "The sooner they are made single the better but yet when they are not very thick they may stand till we have the best con∣venience of singling them without much damage but when they come up extraordinary thick it will be much more difficult to make them single if they are neglected at their very first coming into rough leaf"  they are singled out the better they will thrive  Page    "We need not be very exact in the number or dis∣tance  "The distance need not be regular for when a turnip has six inches of room on one side and eighteen on the other it is almost as well as if there was one foot on each side"  we set them out at we contrive to leave the mas∣ter turnips when there is so much difference in them and sp  re such when near one another and leave the more space before and behind them but if there be three mas∣ter turnips together we take out the middlemost  Page    "Dung and tillage together will always attain the ne∣cessary degree of pulverization in less time than plough∣ing can do alone therefore dung is more useful for tur∣nips because they have commonly less time to grow than other plants  Page    "I have had great crops of turnips in rows three feet asunder and much greater than I could ever obtain from  rows thirty inches asunder But one reason why I like six foot rows better is that the largest turnips are best for oxen and are pulled up and loaded with the least expenceI find that the least competent number will  cateris paribus  always be the largest  Preface page  ix  "Several lands of turnips drilled on the level of three foot rows ploughed and doubly dunged and also horsehoed did not produce near so good a crop of turnips as six foot rows adjoining horsehoed though no dung had been thereon for many years  "There was no other difference than that the three foot rows did not admit the hoeplough to raise half the ar∣tificial posture as the six foot rows did The dung plough∣ed into the narrow intervals before drilling could oper∣ate no farther with any great effect than the hoeplough could turn it up and help it in its pulverization"  From these extracts it appears that Mr Tull cultivated turnips in rows not only on the level but on the tops of two and a half and three feet ridges and both horse and handhoed as at present but whether he put dung in the bottom of those ridges is not so clear from the ex∣pression "the dung ploughed into the narrow intervals before drilling" It is unfortunate that this ingenious gentleman to support a whimsical theory should not al∣low that dung was of any other use in vegetation than in pulverizing the soil though he is obliged to admit that for cabbages turnips carrots and potatoes it will make the crops greater and the cattle will like them never the worse  Page  But his disciples entertained juster notions of the pro∣perties and value of dung to neglect it as will appear in the sequel  We are informed by a gentleman who went to direct the management of an estate in Dumfriesshire in  that Mr Craik of Arbigland near Dumfries had then drilled turnips betwixt twenty and thirty years by tak∣ing the medium his first beginning would be about The mode he pursued was as followsIn the Autumn as soon as the corn crop was off he ploughed his land in∣to twobout ridges in which state it continued all winter next spring these ridges were ploughed and harrowed until sufficiently pulverized and at last split to make a hollow furrow for depositing the dung which was cover∣ed in by the plough going twice about making a ridge near four feet wide then this twobout ridge was har∣rowed a singlewheel drill turning round a hollow cylin∣der of tin with holes in it deposited the seed directly over the dung the drill had a small roller behind to cover in the seed and was drawn by one horse When the plants were ready for hoeing they were set out at ten or twelve inches distance one from another in the rows and the intervals ploughed between through the Summer as oft∣en as necessary  From this place it is probable that the practice had tra∣velled into Cumberland for in the year Philip Howard Esq of Corby first cultivated turnips in that county in drills with four feet intervals finding the dis∣tance too wide he reduced it to two feet and continued it for ten years before it was followed by the farmers who now pursue the same mode with little variation except that they make the distance of the intervals about twentyseven inches The onebout ridges in which the dung is deposited are here called  stitches  and are flattened at the top by drawing a piece of wood over them in∣stead of a roller or a harrow  About the year or Mr Pringle formerly a surgeon in the army who had an estate near Coldstream in Berwickshire was the first person in that neighbour∣hood who cultivated turnips in this manner His drills  were at three feet and a half distance Mr Cox a serjeant whom Mr Pringle brought home with him for a servant says that his master took his hints from Mr Tull's book and that he also drilled all his corn crops until he had overcome the annual weeds  Mr William Dawson who was well acquainted with the turnip culture in England having been purposely sent to reside in those districts for six or seven years where the best cultivation was pursued with an intention not only of seeing but of making himself master of the manual ope∣rations and of every minutia in the practice was convinc∣ed of the superiority of Mr Pringle's mode over every o∣ther he had seen either in Norfolk or elsewhere and in when he entered to Frogden Farm near Kelso in Roxburghshire he immediately adopted the practice up∣on a large scale to the amount of acres yearly He began by drilling at three feet distance but a few years after trying various widths of intervals he re∣duced it to two feet and a half which he still con∣tinues As far as we have been able to obtain informa∣tion he was the first that used  a roller for flattening the  tops of the onebout ridges  It may not be improper to remark that Mr Pringle pursued this mode for several years yet none of his neigh∣bours followed the example but no sooner did Mr Daw∣son an actual farmer adopt the same system than it was immediately followed not only by several farmers in his vicinity but by those very farmers adjoining Mr Pringle whose crops they had seen for ten or twelve years so much superior to their own It is also deserving of notice that when Mr Dawson settled at Frogden the whole of that district was under the most wretched system of cultivation and the farmers unacquainted with the value of turnips artificial grasses and lime At first his practice met with many opponents and was ridiculed by the old the ignor∣ant  ant and the prejudiced but his superior crops and pro∣fits soon made converts The practice in a few years be∣came general and this district is now amongst the best cultivated in the kingdom the land trebled in value and the aspect of the country greatly improved It is a pleasing reflection that the example and exertions of one man has been capable of producing so great so lasting and inestimable benefits and it is more than probable that this mode of cultivating turnips would have died a∣way with Mr Pringle and the practice been lost to this district had it not been for the discernment and intelli∣gence of this individual  We remember seeing about twentyfive years since turnips cultivated in this manner by Mr Christopher Ben∣son of Stainsby near Ripley in Yorkshire an ingenious gentleman and great advocate for drilling and who had drilled all his corn crops for many years His nephew Mr Donkin informs us that he had cultivated turnips in this manner more than twenty years before this which will be prior to the year  In Mr Benson's practice described by himself in Dr Hunter's Georgical Essays page the seed is drilled  upon the dung  and that and the seed covered together by harrowing across the ridges  His nephew says "the dung and seed were covered in by a double mouldboard plough set wide and then harrowed"  In this paper he very properly sums up the advantages of this mode of cultivat∣ing turnips he observes "the seed being placed upon the moist dung will vegetate early in all circumstances of the weather and the manure being well covered will be secured from evaporation in the hotest seasons The turnips being placed immediately over the manure have a ready passage by means of their tap roots into rich bed of nutriment which will accelerate their growth and in∣crease their size As the crop grows upon ridges with a  trench on each side it is obvious that the turnips will re∣main dry in the wettest seasons a circumstance of the ut∣most utility To those advantages we may add the  doub∣ling of the soil  which I consider as an important article in all situations where the  staple of the land happens to be thin"  From a review of the whole it appears that the pre∣sent mode of cultivating turnips by drilling in rows at two feet and two feet and a half distance had occurred to different people in different parts who all at first began according to Mr Tull's directions with the addition of dung put in the bottom of the ridge and after trying various width of intervals found that the best and most convenient distance was from twentyfour to thirty inches but it is very clear that  Mr Tull is the root from whence this excellent practice first originated  This mode of cultivating turnips is now spreading far and wide with great rapidity besides this county it is also the general practice of Roxburghshire and Berwick∣shire and has been lately adopted by the best cultivators in various districts of Scotland as well as different parts of England amongst which the county of Norfolk will par∣ticularly prosit by it as a firstrate cultivator who holds a large farm in that county has procured the proper appara∣tus from hence and sent his son to be instructed in the different operations it has also found its way into Dor∣setshire we had the pleasure of seeing it practised with great success by the ingenious Mr Boswell of Piddletown and to the farmers of Devonshire it has been particularly recommended as the best system known by the cele∣brated Mr Marshall who has minutely examined and is well acquainted with the agriculture of the greatest part of the kingdom  This Gentleman has published the Rural Economy of Norfolk Yorkshire Midland Counties Gloucestershire the West of England c  And the President of the Board adds  that this gentleman informed him that the best cultiva∣tors and most intelligent farmers he had ever seen were those who practised this system on Tweedside  SECT  Crops not commonly cultivated  Ruta Baga  has been tried by a few but not so long as is necessary to draw any positive conclusions respecting its comparative merits With us it is not near so valua∣ble as the common turnip Hares are remarkably fond of it and will not touch the other turnips while there is one of these in the field  Rape  is seldom grown for feed and perhaps not so often for sheep as it ought on lands improper for turnips Upon lands that have grown early oats and are intended for fallow next year it is sometimes sown in September as spring seed for sheep to supply the vacancy between turnips and clover For this purpose a little rye is sown along with it  Cabbages  were cultivated but gave way again to tur∣nips it being thought that the latter answer as good a purpose and are obtained with less trouble  Carrots  have been frequently tried but have hitherto made little or no progress probably from the great trouble attending their cultivation compared with pota∣toes which in some measure answer the same intention as food for horses  Flax  was formerly cultivated in small quantities for family use but is now in a great measure given up it hav∣ing been found that land which had grown flax was so much impoverished as to require an extra manuring be∣fore it could be brought to the same state of fertility as the rest of the field  Woad Isatis Tinctoria  This plant the leaves of  which are so useful in dying  It is not only much used by dyers for its  blue colour  but also for the basis of many other colours It was with the juice of this plant that the ancient Britons stained their bodies to make them appear more terrible to their enemies  is cultivated at  Newburn  only on the banks of the Tyne by Messrs Rait Pollock and Dun  The ground is ploughed with a deep furrow before Winter and made as fine as possible against April in which month it is sown at the rate of bushels per acre broadcast in about a fortnight after it makes its appear∣ance above ground particular care is taken to keep it clear of weeds which is done by boys and girls from to years of age  Two workers to an acre from the beginning of April to De∣cember is the general allowance  who have each a spade about inches long and inches broad which they use with one hand to dig up the weeds and with the other gather them this pro∣cess is repeated two or three times before cropping which is done by wringing off the leaves of the plant with their hands and putting them in basketsThe first crop is generally gathered the latter end of July the second the last week in September and the third in November but this is only from off such parts where the second crop was gathered first It is carried from the field in carts to the mill where it is ground into a green paste and made into balls about inches diameter when it is set upon ranges under sheds to dry which is done in two or three weeks after this it is put into the house or pen and kept till all the fields are gathered and afterwards manufactured  Mr Rait in a letter to the President states that he had dis∣covered that indigo might be made from the juice that is pressed out by the mill in manufacturing the leaves but it seems he has not yet accomplished it as in a subsequent letter he says "my views upon the whole of this business terminate in one of two points the first is to have the particles of colour separated from the liquor and made a marketable article by itself as indigo is failing of that to apply it to the use of vats along with the li∣quor or juice in which it is in the most improved state we can arrive at"  SECT  Corn Harvest  The Corn Harvest  in the vale of Till and upon Tyne∣side near Hexham frequently begins the first week in August while upon the cold backward soils and situations oats will be often uncut the latter end of October or be∣ginning of November but the most general harvest is in September Most of the corn is cut with sickles by wo∣men seven of whom with a man to bind after them generally reap two acres per dayOats and barley are sometimes mown  Wheat is set up in stooks of twelve sheaves each oats and barley are  "gated"  set up in single sheaves and when dry bound tight at the bottom and led home or set up in stooks of ten sheaves each The stacks are most∣ly round but some of the best farmers set up their barley and wheat in long narrow stacks which keep the corn much better and dryer And the practice of placing corn upon stone pillars with a cap or cover over them to keep out the mice and a frame of wood over all is gaining ground and cannot be too much recommended as it not only prevents the mice getting to it but keeps the corn dry and airy It is an excellent method for grain that is to be kept until Summer and one principal advantage is that wheat may be led from the field and set upon those stands almost as soon as reaped They are made both round and oblong but most of the latter  CHAPTER VIII  GRASS  SECT  Natural Meadows and Pastures  WHAT is generally understood by natural meadows are such lands as are overflowed by rivers and produce a crop of hay every year without any returns of manure Of this description of meadows we have very few in this county what are called meadows here are such old grass lands as are employed for growing hay almost every year the greatest part of which are uplands To enable them to stand this severe cropping they are or ought to be manured on the surface every third or fourth year if this operation be neglected they impoverish very fast Where they cannot conveniently be dunged as above they are depastured one year and mown the other or what is better depastured two years and mown the third the produce from to ½ tons per acre a fair crop the aftermath or "Fog" is frequently let from to shillings per acre and is mostly consumed in fattening oxen and cows  Lands that are intended for meadow are  "freed"  from being depastured with any kind of stock at differ∣ent times in the spring from the beginning of April to the middle of May as best suits the convenience of the occupier particular attention is paid to the molehills dung c being  "scaled"  Spread abroad  and the stones and other matters that might obstruct the operations of the scythe are carefully gathered off  Natural Pastures  or old grass land are most prevalent along the sea coast these are depastured with both sheep and oxen the general mode of stinting being two acres to an ox and the same quantity of ground to or sheep thro' the Summer and from to sheep per acre thro' the Winter the latter are either the store flock or ewes for fat lambsSometimes Cheviot wethers ½ years old in good condition are put in those pastures after the fat∣ting cattle are taken out and pay well if they get suffi∣ciently fat to be sold to the butchers about Christmas  SECT  Artificial Grasses  The Artificial Grasses  most commonly cultivated in this county are red clover  trifolium pratense  white clover  trifolium repens  and raygrass  lolium perenne  with these some people mix ribgrass  plantago lanceolata  and upon sandy soils hopmedic  This in some places is called hoptrefoil a name properly belonging to a very different plant vizTrifolium agrarium  medicago lupulina  is sown with successFew of these grasses are ever grown alone except red clover when intended to continue only one year and even then a small portion of raygrass from one to three gallons per acre is generally sown with it we think with much propriety as it not only comes early in the spring but thickens the crop and facilitates mak∣ing the clover into hay  But when land is intended to continue for three or more years in grass they are generally mixed in the pro∣portion of eight or ten pounds of red clover four pounds of white clover and half a bushel of raygrass per acre to the above quantities are sometimes added three or four pounds of ribgrass and hopmedic as the soil suits When red clover is grown alone or pounds an acre are sown upon dry friable soils and from to  pounds upon strong loams or clays They are sown in March April and May upon lands fallowed the summer preceding for wheat or turnips succeeded by barley and ought always to be harrowed in as well as rolled Harrowing is particularly necessary upon strong lands growing wheat and across the ridges is the best mode of performing the operation We find that where corn is drilled and the intervals hoed it pulverizes the soil and makes the finest preparation for grass seeds of all others where this is properly done and harrowed once across after the seeds are sown they seldom or never miss long experience having proved that nothing requires a finer tilth than clover and grass seedsUpon the best soils the clover and raygrass mixed are generally ready to depasture with fat sheep by the beginning of April and from May through the Summer will carry six or eight sheep per acre according to the luxuriance of the crop and fertility of the soil the second and remaining years they are depastured by the store flock These pastures are frequently mown when the raygrass begins to flow∣er which not only increases the bottom grass but a quantity of excellent hay is obtained of considerable value  When the clovers are not depastured but kept for hay they are generally mown about the latter end of June the average produce about tons per acre The second crop is rarely cut for hay but depastured by cattle or sheep chiefly the latter When cattle are put into a fresh clover "fog" especially in wet weather they sometimes hove by the sudden fermentation of the clover to pre∣vent this inconvenience cattle are put upon it in the mid∣dle of the day when it is free from dew or any moisture they being first filled with natural grass which hinders them from eating so greedily as if put on hungry if the clover once pass they seldom take any harm after∣wards  by using this precaution we have not had any cattle hoven for several yearsWhen very much swelled an instrument is used similar to that used by sur∣geons in tapping for the dropsy it is so contrived that after being thrust in between the hip and rib on the near side one part pulls out while a tube remains in the ori∣fice thro' which an amazing quantity of fetid air escapes and relieves the animal but they are very apt to hove again afterwards  We have heard of hoven cattle being relieved by giv∣ing them an egg shell full of tar  The practice of keeping horses in the house sheds or foldyards all Summer upon  cut clover tares c  was introduced into this county about the year it is now generally adopted by the best farmers who find their horses thrive better are cheaper kept than depas∣turing at large and also that a quantity of manure is gained by this means which otherwise would have been in a great measure lost or of very little use as the dung of horses when dropped in pastures is mostly destroyed by insects in the Summer seasonAn acre of good clo∣ver used in this manner will keep from to horses from the beginning of June till the end of October a∣bout weeks  Saintfoin Lucern and Chicory  have been tried on a small scale but do not seem to come into general use the crops of clover being thought more valuable  In order to draw any fair comparative value between the produce of old grass lands and artificial grasses the soil and situation ought to be exactly alike and experi∣ments accurately conducted for want of such data no just conclusions can be made but we believe that gener∣al observation and experience have established an opinion that the same lands which in a state of old grass carried sheep an acre will for the first year of clover and ray∣grass  grass depasture or on rich old grazing pastures the difference will probably not be so great and what they fall short in Summer will be made up by their superiority in Winter on clayey soils it would certainly be a dan∣gerous experiment to convert those rich grazing pastures into tillage as a certain portion of such is a valuable ac∣quisition to every farm but they are so rarely scattered that few farms are so fortunate as to enjoy so desirable an appendage  SECT  Hay Harvest  The hay harvest is seldom begun before the middle of June The mowers cut from half an acre to three quar∣ters a day and that very ill the haymakers are equally indolent and inactive After the grass is cut it is by some tedded strewed or spread abroad and repeatedly turned till dry  We never ted or strew clover when mown but turn it in the swathe with the head of the rake backward and forward until it be fit to put into large cocks or pikes which we prefer to every other mode we have seen as it preserves the leaves upon the clover much better than when strewed abroad  others the day after it has been tedded or strewed put in into foot cocks wappings which can scarcely be too small if the weather keeps dry it is in two days more put into large cocks if the weather proves wet we know no mode by which it will save bet∣ter or waste the smell less as the rain passes thro' them and a small quantity of air or sun dries them again or they are easily turned overIn either mode when suffi∣ciently dry it is put into ricklets provincially  pikes  of about half a ton each in the field which stand there for two three or more weeks until a convenient opportuni∣ty offers for leading them home to be put into one large stack In these ricklets the hay takes a first sweating which prevents its heating when put into larger masses  For the purpose of drawing it together to be put into pikes or ricklets it is either cocked or put into large  heaps which are trailed in by one horse yoked to the ends of a long rope put round the bottoms of those cocks or heaps upon the hind part of which a boy gets with his feet to keep it down and prevent its slipping over the top of the hay when arrived at the place want∣ed one end of the rope is taken off the hook at the horses shoulder and being thus loosened at one end the horse moves forward when the rope draws thro' under the hay and leaves it  When the hay is neither put into cocks nor large heaps but remains in a thick row t  is then necessary to use two horses vizOne yoked to each end of a strong sweeping rope and two persons to get upon the rope with their feet one on each side the row who rest with their arms upon the hay and step forward on the rope as the hay gathers To prevent the hay from slipping off behind a small cord is fastened to the hind part of the sweeping rope and extended to each person's hand which they let out as they step forward or find other∣wise necessary By either of the above modes the hay grown upon a field of or acres may be drawn to∣gether in a few hours and is much more expeditious than either fledges or carts  When the large stack is made in the field the "Pikes" are drawn to it by putting a strong rope round their bot∣tom the two ends of which are fastened to the hind part of a cart in which are yoked or horsesThis saves the trouble of forking and loading them in carts and is done in much less time  SECT  Feeding  O  n  are mostly grazed in the eastern part of the county and a few in the vicinity of Whittingham they are bought in May or June and sold as they become ready to supply the large fleets of colliers and other trad∣ing  vessels belonging to Newcastle Shields Sunderland Hartley and Blythe  Some few graziers buy only such oxen as are forward by having got turnips in the Spring these generally go off in June and are followed by cows heifers or kyloes  An excellent breed of small cattle from the Highlands of Scotland  of which those that do not get fat on the pas∣ture to be sold thro' the Summer are put upon fogs aftermaths and sold in November and December The cows are also bought in the spring months and are chief∣ly used for home consumption The kyloes are bought at FalkirkTrysts  "meetings"  or at Newcastle Fair in the Autumn and wintered upon coarse rough ground or straw sometimes a few turnips are given in the Spring and are sold all thro' the Summer as they become fit for the butcher to supply Newcastle and other markets Those that are ready to go off in June always leave the most profit beef being frequently sold at that season for a shilling a stone more than the ordinary prices  The profit of grazing like all other speculations varies with circumstances but we believe we may venture to a∣verage it at l or l s for keeping on grass from Mayday to Michaelmas Cows in general leave more than oxen in proportion to their weight but they are subject to disorders of the udder that frequently reduce the profit and deter many people from grazing them  Some few graziers follow the old custom of keeping on∣ly one kind of stock upon the same ground whilst others we think with more propriety intermix with oxen and cows a few sheep and two or three colts in each pasture which both turn to good account and do little injury to the grazing cattle In some cases sheep are a real benefit by eating down and destroying the ragwort  Senecio  Jacobaeo  which disgraces some of the best pastures in the county where  oxen only  are grazed  Sheep  that have been wintered upon turnips are put to the earliest grass that can be obtained the clovers and raygrass are generally ready in April the old grass lands not before May In both situations they are continued till shorn and sold off from the latter end of May thro' all June and part of July from l to l s each In the prices were from l s to l s each The draft ewes or shearling wethers intended for turnips next Winter succeed them and thus a regular rotation is kept up Of late years some farmers have sold their shearling wethers in July when only months old to the butch∣ers for as high prices as from to shillings each In they sold from to shillings each and in as high as shillings after shearing a fleece worth shillings  A large portion of the lands of this county being liable to the rot and unsafe for a breeding flock the occupiers of such situations venture ewes for fat lambs for one year these are bought in the Autumn put to tup early some in August the lambs sold in May June and July after which the ewes are fatted and sold in October and Nov∣emberSuch lambs as are early and go off in May oft∣en sell for shillings each but the others average at a∣bout s d The price of fat ewes depends much on their being of a good or slow feeding sort and will vary from to shillings The average may be called shillingsThe proceeds from longwoolled ewes will be     £  s  d  A fat Lamb        Ditto Ewe

manu∣factures of flour and oatmeal produce have applied it to feeding different kinds of stock they both agree that for feeding pigs it is of little value one of the gentlemen says that from some experiments he had read he was in∣duced to enter largely on the business and persevered in it till he lost upwards of a thousand pounds  For Horses  they both think it very valuable along with hay or straw instead of corn Mr Watson allows his horses bushels of bran or bushels of pollard and of  oat seeds per week the average price of which is about shillings the horses are in high condition and sleek as ravens but not more so than those that have ⅕ bushels of oats per week the price of which at s per bushel is equal to the value of the bran  For Cattle  Mr Hay says that "in the beginning of October I tie up my cattle in sheds and place before every beast a crib for bran and another for turnips and to each give a peck of  pollard  morning and evening with  full allowance of turnips  well cleansed and topped I fre∣quently mix oat sheeling seeds and oat dust which makes them fonder of the pollard if stale or old kept Three months stallfeeding in this way is equal to months in the usual way"  In order to form some idea of the utility of the above mode we must estimate the expence of the pollard in ad∣dition to the full allowance of turnips pollard being a finer kind of bran is sold for d a bushel more of course when bran is d per bushel pollard will be s and al∣lowing that an ox will fatten as much in weeks with the above keeping as he will in by the common mode the account will

of May in weeks they had eaten bushels of bran and oat seeds mixed with which they had for the first three weeks coarse hay the other four cut clover With this their cribs were kept constantly full The value of bran and oat seeds amounts to about s per per week each beast of the hay and clover no account was kept but it cannot be estimated at less than s which makes with attendance s per week each beast near double the expence of grass and more than the improve∣ment of the cattle would pay tho' they were certainly in very thriving condition  Mr Watson once attempted to keep two heifers on bran only they grew worse and worse and were obliged to have other food when they got grass they eat much more bran than when they got bran alone  For Sheep  these gentlemen allow bushels per week per score to their store ewes on grass that is s d per week or ½d per sheep besides grass  Mr Hay wintered ewes on acres they had bushels per week of bran but this land would have win∣tered ewes without any assistance therefore the bran was applied to the support of the additional ewes of course the expences per week will be     £  s  d  bushels of bran at d per bushel which divided by        gives the expence per week of keeping a store ewe      ½  which is near double the price usually paid for turnips  Mr Watson is summering ewes on SpindlestonHill a bare rocky pasture to this flock he allows bushels of bran per day or bushels per week which at d per bushel is ¼d per week per sheep besides the grass they are in excellent condition but it is a price for keep∣ing store ewes that most farmers would state at  To a flock of yearold fat wethers he gives bushels of bran per week which is near ½d per week per sheep they are depastured upon good land at the rate of about sheep an acre which is scarcely double the number the same ground would keep equally well with∣out bran of course these sheep cost above s per week per sheep a price that the appearance of the sheep does by no means promise to repay  These are all the facts that have come to our know∣ledge respecting feeding with bran from which it ap∣pears that it  is not so beneficial a practice  as had been  re∣presented to the Board  CHAPTER IX  GARDENS AND ORCHARDS  IN gardening we do not find any practices in this dis∣trict but what are generally known to the profession and in respect to Orchards they are thinly scattered in∣deedThe frosty nights and northeast winds from the German Ocean which are so prevalent here in the spring months are very inimical to fruit crops and it is pro∣bably owing to this circumstance that there is such a scar∣city  of orchards so much so that we believe nine tenths of the apples consumed in this county are imported from Kent Essex and other southern counties  CHAPTER X  WOODS AND PLANTATIONS  WOODS growing in a natural state are found mostly on the banks of rivers those of the north and fouth Tyne the Wansbeck Coquet and their tributary streams have by far the greatest qu  nti  y Of old oak timber from eighty to one hundred and forty years growth the probable value may be about l of which twothirds can only be said to be proper for building ships of great burthen  The demand by the collieries and lead mines for small wood has induced the proprietors of woods on the Der∣went Tyne c to cut them at an early age From twentyfive to thirty years growth is the general term for oak elm and ash but birch willow and aller are cut sooner and hazle for corfrods  Corves are a kind of large wickerwork baskets used for bringing coals out of pits made of rods from ½ to inch dia∣meter  once in three or four years  The price of ash and elm is from s to s per foot of oak from s to s per foot of birch aller c for pit props six feet long and from four to six inches dia∣meter d each corf rods d per hundred Oak bark last year was sold for l per ton Under this manage∣ment  and at those prices an acre in thirty years will pro∣duce on  n average l clear of expences there has been instances of an acre of wood thirtytwo years old felling for l and another of sixty years growth worth l per acre but these were in particularly favourable situations  In the management of these woods the general prac∣tice is to cut all away together The system of Anthony Surtees  Esq  of Newbiggen we think preferable he takes his away in  patches  and as the older trees interfere with the younger springs and where a thriving healthy oak is in a convenient situation he lets it stand for tim∣ber by this means the young spring is sheltered and an annual produce of upwards of l is obtained from sixty acres of woodland  Plantations on an extensive scale are rising in every part of the county and are almost in every instance doing well and promise not only to repay the spirited exertions of the proprietors but will add greatly to the ornament and improvement of the country  Amongst the great variety of trees we have observed in those plantations the larch rises proudly preeminent above the rest and in almost every situation far out∣strips the various species of firs and pines wherever we have noticed them planted promiscuously together In many plantations in the northern parts of the county the  spruce firs  between and years old have  diedoff  and this in so many very different soils and situations that they are now in a great measure discarded from the plan∣tations that have been made of late years the cause of this failure has not been yet satisfactorily accounted for  CHAPTER XI  WASTES  THE  commons  in this county capable of being convert∣ed into profitable tillage land are now very trifling the greatest part having been inclosed within the last thirty years the whole amounting to near acres Of this the commons belonging to the manors of Hexham∣shire and Allendale contain acres a great part of which are high exposed heathy mountains These are to be converted into stinted pastures not being thought capable of any other improvement  The increased value of such inclosed commons depends as we have stated in our Report of Cumberland entirely upon the system of cultivation pursued Upon Bulbeckcommon there are lands which in a state of common were not worth more than s an acre a part of which has been in tillage twentyfive years and grown three white crops successively betwixt one fallowing and another This land is now dear enough at s an acre while Mr Hop∣per's of BlackHedley is worth s or s His system is when first broke up from heath to pare and burn and plough in the autumn next spring plough across lime and sow oats then fallow and lime bushels per acre and sow turnips after which oats and grass seeds four pounds red clover five pounds white and one bushel of ray grass and continue in grass six or seven years then to plough for oatsturnipsoatsand sow up with grass seeds as before There are instances where the increased value is in the ratio of twelve to one or even more but  these are where the commons were of no value to the proprietor which is in general the case  The stinted common of Holy Island was divided in the allotments that were gotten for a right which never let for more than l are now let for l or l per ann and in a few years will be worth upwards of l  The extent of waste lands  or open mountainous dis∣tricts incapable of affording profit by cultivating with the plough is very great as we have before stated consi∣derable quantities of which are private property and of course may be depastured by sheep or other stock to the greatest advantage of those that are common it would certainly be best for every man to know his own share  Draining would be highly useful to many parts of these districts there are also many excellent situations for planting and of all other purposes to which such lands are convertible this species of improvement seems to us the most promising to make the greatest returns  CHAPTER XII  IMPROVEMENTS  SECT  Draining  DRAININGis one of those improvements that has lately made its way into Northumberland and is now mostly practised in the middle and northern parts of the county the theory is pretty well understood in those dis∣tricts and the practice is becoming more prevalent every year Hollow drains are generally used filled with stones where they can be got where these cannot be obtained  but at a great expence sod drains are the only resource especially in the northern parts where there is little wood  SECT  Paring and Burning  Paring and Burning is not much practised in the eastern and northern parts of the county in the midland and southern parts it is most prevalent but even there it is confined to old swards and coarse rough rushey and heathy lands for the first breakingup of such ground it is certainly very convenient and preferable to any other mode we have ever seen but tho' we are fully con∣vinced of its beneficial effects in such situations yet we have our doubts whether it could be used with advantage upon lands that have lain a few years in grass and that would produce good crops of grain  immediately on being ploughed out  which is not the case with coarse rough heathy lands or even very old swards on rich fertile soils it being found that crops on the latter are frequently very much injured by  "leaping"  for two or three years which paring and burning entirely obviates and ensures full crops to the farmer who need not be under any ap∣prehension of his soil being ruined by it provided he pursues the following course  Turnips  Oats  Fallow well limed for turnips  Barley  sown up with clover and grass seeds and depastured with sheep for three or four years and afterwards if not intended to lie in grass continue it in the rotation mentioned page It is the  injudicious cropping  more than the ill effects derived from paring and burning that has been the chief cause of bringing such an odium on this practice which is certain∣ly an excellent one in  some situations  and  properly conducted  but like the fermented juice of the grape may be too oft∣en repeated and improperly applied  The popular clamour against this practice "that it  de∣stroys the soil  " we can by no means admit and are inclin∣ed  to believe that not a single atom of soil is abstracted though the bulk of the sod or turf be diminished this arises from the burning of the roots or vegetable substances which by this process afford a considerable portion of Alkaline Salts phlogistic or carbonic matter and pro∣bably other principles friendly to vegetation as we find those ashes produce abundant crops of turnips which fatten stock much quicker than those after any other dressing or manure we have ever seen and the suc∣ceeding crops of corn are so very luxuriant as to tempt the  injudicious cultivator  to pursue it too far and for the sake of temporary gain may be said to rip it up as the boy did with his goose that layed golden eggs  SECT  Manuring  In some parts of this county where the turnip culture is carried to such extent every exertion of ingenuity is practised to raise a large portion of  Farm Yard Dung  for without this valuable article it is well known that good turnip crops are not to be expected and the farmers of strong soils are sufficiently sensible of the advantage of dung to their crops not to use every endeavour to increase its quantity  The farmers of turnip soils in order to have their dung sufficiently rotted lead it out of the fold yard in the win∣ter make it up in large dunghills in order to increase the putrefactive process and prepare it for that state of disso∣lution by which its component parts are ready to be assimilated into new bodies and in which state only is can be of use in vegetation  Upon the hillfarms around Cheviot we have been oft∣en surprized to see at the doors of the shepherds' houses such immense dunghills the accumulation of unnumber∣ed years probably centuries to avoid this increasing nuisance many of them have  ingeniously contrived  to build  their houses near a  "Burn side"  for the  convenience  of having it  taken away by every flood  notwithstanding they have lands adjoining upon which if this manure was pro∣perly applied the greatest improvements would ensue and considerable quantities of excellent hay be produced for the support of the flocks in winter storms in which seasons they are very often under the necessity of pur∣chasing hay in the Lowlands and of having it conveyed on horseback to the top of these hills in the deepest snows at a very great expence  We were glad to see Mr Smith Mr Marshall and a few o∣thers departing from this trait of barbarism and applying their manure in a very proper manner  Lime  is found in many parts of this county of an ex∣cellent quality In Bambro' Ward where it has been long used many intelligent farmers begin to doubt of its efficacy and the propriety of continuing to lay it upon their  old tillage lands  Upon the dry soils in Glendale Ward where it has not been used much above years  Mr James Hall of Thornington was the first person that ever carried a cart load of lime across the river Till for laying upon land The first year he prevailed upon his father to allow him to lead cart load which had so wonderful an effect that the quantity was increased next year and in a few years after the use of it became general  its effects are more conspicuous especially upon such lands as have been seldom or never limed In its natural state the soil of this district is dry duffy light full of fibrous roots and when in fallow on passing over it you sink to the ancles after being sufficiently limed the fibrous roots disappear the soil becomes denser firm to the tread retentive of moisture and produces better and more abun∣dant crops of grain than before when laid to grass the effects of the lime appear to an inch by the superior ver∣dure  which takes place as far as it has gone  About twelve years since when looking over the farm of Thornington with Mr James Hall the late tenant we were sur∣prised with the sudden alteration in the verdure of the land which took place immediately at the junction of two ridges one side was a fine dark green  caten very bare  and covered with a thick mat of  white clover and raygrass  the other was a dingy brown principally composed of  fine bent  and  sheep's fesque  and in a great measure  neglected by the sheep  An explanation was desired for so great a contrast and Mr Hall informed us that when this parcel of land was last in fallow the part which was  eaten so bare  and looked so green was  well limed  the other which the sheep neg∣lected had  never been limed  It has been said and repeatedly copied by writers on Agricul∣ture and Botany that  "sheep prefer the "Festuca Ovina" to all other plants"  In the above instance it was quite the contrary from which and from other observations we have made we are inclined to believe that the idea has probably originated more in conjecture than experiment It has also been remarked by bo∣tanical writers that sheep refuse to eat ragwort  Senecio Ja∣cobaea"  The fact in they are so very fond of it they will not allow a plant to flower wherever they depasture  Many of these dry soils after being limed grow white clover na∣turally where not limed it seldom appears but they cover principally with  agrostis capillaris  fine bent which is seldom eaten by any kind of stock if they can get o∣ther food When land has been sufficiently limed this plant disappears and wherever it is found it may be safely concluded that the soil on which it grows has not had its due quantity of lime  About seven years since Mr George Reed of SouthMiddleton near Wooler cleared from broom or acres of light dry channelly soil that had  never been limed  which was sown with rye the rye stubble was ploughed in the Autumn and the worst part of it limed at the rate of bushels per acre next Summer the whole was drilled with turnips dunged c as described page which came up all alike and continued to do e∣qually well for three or four weeks but little or no rain falling in that period and the weather continuing droughty those turnips upon the land which had  no lime  died away whilst those upon that part which  was limed  were discernible  to an inch  flourished with unabated vigour and produced an excellent crop for such land worth at least l s an acre many similar instances might be produced but this is the most striking we re∣collect to have noted  The made of burning lime  in this county is mostly in drawkilns of the form of an inverted cone with two or three eyes or mouths for drawing out the lime and ad∣mitting air These kilns are kept burning and drawing perpetually Some of the large sale kilns will afford or cart load a day A cart load of coals is reckoned to burn two cart loads of lime  The Price  at the kilns is from s to s d for upheaped bushels  The Quantity  laid upon an acre is from to bushels  The general practice of using lime  is to lay it up in heaps of three or four cart loads each and as soon as the clods are fallen slacked or reduced to the state of quicklime it is spread evenly upon the land and harrowed and ploughed in as soon as possible after sometimes instead of laying it up in heaps of or cart loads each it is laid upon the land in the clod state in little heaps of about a bushel each which are covered with earth until sufficient∣ly flacked or fallen and then spread abroad  In either mode or in whatever manner lime is applied it certainly has the greatest effect when both it and the soil are in the most pulverized state  Upon the turnip soils where very large quantities of lime are used it would be extremely difficult to get a sufficiency in the early part of Summer previous to the turnip season in such situations it is usual to lead as much as possible thro' the Summer and Autumn which  is laid up in very large heaps from to loads each and before Winter covered with sods or thatched with straw to prevent the rain from penetrating it If well se∣cured it is found in a very quick state in the Spring some∣times a great portion of it remaining unslacked  The opinions respecting the good or ill effects of lime are exceedingly various some asserting that it can never be used in too large a quantity whilst others contend it is of no use whatever Our own practice authorizes us to say that upon some soils the application of lime or calca∣reous earth in some other form in considerable quantities is absolutely necessary in order to bring them to their most fertile state and to prepare them for the action of other manures whilst upon other soils lime produces no sen∣sible effect and if used in large quantities will prove very detrimentalThus may one of the most valuable appli∣cations we know for the improvement of many soils be condemned by those who draw  positive conclusions  from  partial observations of facts  The practice of paring and burning we believe owes the opprobrium which some have thrown upon it to  a similar mode of reasoning  Stone Marl  has formerly been used in considerable quantities near Tweedside but the more immediate effects of lime have entirely set aside the use of stone marl  Shell Marl  is used with great advantage at the rate of or cart loads an acre on the farms of Wark Sun∣nylaws and Learmouth  Sea Wrack Sea Ware or Marine Plants  driven a∣shore by the tide are used with great effect wherever they can be had Of these the  fucus vesiculosus  and its rela∣tives  F serratus and inflatus  Skeir Ware are not held in much estimation and when used require to be laid up in large heaps to putrify If laid upon the land as the others  are when taken immediately from the shore they dry and turn to a black coriaceous substane The  fucus digitatus  Wassels is the great favourite and another species called  Mayweed  which we cannot point out by its Linnaean name not having had an opportunity of seeing it but from the descriptions we have heard suspect it to be the young plants of the  fucus digitatus  Coal Ashes  are chiefly used in the vicinity of the prin∣cipal towns as a dressing for grass land for this purpose they are found of considerable benefit especially upon strong coarse and wet lands  SECT  Weeding  Weeding corn is universally practised  the broad cast crops  are handweeded in which operation the thistles be∣ing rather unpleasant to handle are in some parts drawn by a pair of large pliers "nippers" with flat cheeks in others they are cut over by a weeding hook made in the form of a Λ with sharp edges on the inside but this mode of cutting is only a temporary relief as they spring again very soon after pulling up by the roots ought cer∣tainly to be practised in every instance as there is not a weed the farmer has to contend with more difficult to eradicate than the corn thistle  Carduus Arvensis  The drilled crops  are both horse and hand hoed at least twice each and with so much attention that no kind of weeds are sussered to remain the whole being kept in the cleanest and compleatest gardenlike culture  The most prevalent weeds that give the Northumbrian husbandman the greatest trouble are  Of the  Perennial kind  Triticum repens  Couch Wheat  These all go under the general names of  Quickens Couch  or  Twitch grass  the Holcus principally on light dry soils  Avena elatior  Tall Oat  This is readily distinguished from the other kinds of quick∣ens by its bulbous or granulated roots  These all go under the general names of  Quickens Couch  or  Twitch grass  the Holcus principally on light dry soils  Holcus mollis  Soft Holcus  These all go under the general names of  Quickens Couch  or  Twitch grass  the Holcus principally on light dry soils  Seratulae arvensis or  Corn Thistle  Carduus arvensis  Linnaeus has classed this plant with the Seratula but Lightfoot has very properly removed it to the Carduus  Corn Thistle  Annuals  Sinapis arvensis  Wild Mustard Charloc  Sinapis Alba  White Mustard Charloc  Raphanus Raphanistrum  Wild Radish Charloc  Avena Fatua  Wild Oat  Those of less note and more partial visitants are  Galeopsis Tetrahit  Hemp dead nettle  Spergula arvensis  Corn Spurry  Anthemis Cotula  Stinking Camomile  Polygonum Persicaria  Peachwort  Ranunculus arvensis  Corn Crowfoot  Lythospermum arvensis  Corn Gromil  Veronica arvensis  Corn Speedwell  Scandiae Pecten Veneris  Shepherd's needle  SECT  Watering  Watered Meadows  were first introduced into this county by Messrs Culley about years since and not∣withstanding the manifest advantages of this operation yet so slow is knowledge in making its way that it was near years before any other person ventured to pursue the practice and profit by the example It is now begin∣ning  to spread in the neighbourhood and we hope in a few years will be adopted in every situation that can de∣rive benefit from it  Sir William Lorrain with a spirit that marks his wish for improvement brought two men from Leicestershire to drain his grounds at Kirkharl This business they seem to have understood and executed well but we think they have misled the worthy Baronet in telling him they understood laying out land for watering We were sorry to see a first attempt executed in so bad a style which may tend more to discourage the practice than forward its introduction  SECT  Embankments  In the vicinity of Wooler a large tract of low flat ground called  Haughs  adjoining the rivers Till and Glen being subject to be frequently overslowed an at∣tempt was first made to embank them at Yevering in the year which answered the purpose and soon after was adopted on the haughs of Turvilaws Doddington Ewart c by which the lands that could not be let for more than s per acre from the great hazard of losing the crop are now let for more than double the sum  The height of these banks is from to feet the form is represented by a section fig pl where the height CE is feet the base BA feet BC feet and the slope next the water CA feet The side BC was faced up with sods the green side out cut from the ditch D out of which was dug the materials for forming the bank  In some situations it is best to cut the ditch on the side next the river leaving checks at proper intervals to prevent the run of the water These cavities fill up in a few years with mud brought by the floods and the bank is in less danger of breaking when there is no ditch at the back of it  and  the side CA covered with green sods pared from the base BA previous to throwing up the earth  The expence from s to s per rood of yards  CHAPTER XIII  LIVE STOCK  SECT  Cattle  THE different kinds of cattle bred in this county are the short hornedthe Devonshirethe longhornedand the wild cattle  The short horned kind  have been long established over the whole county the other kinds are found only in the hands of a few individuals who have introduced them with a laudable view of comparing their merits with the established breed of the countryThey differ from the o∣ther breeds in the shortness of their horns and in being wider and thicker in their form consequently feed to the most weight in affording the greatest quantity of tal∣low when fatted in having very thin hides and much less hair  It is probably from the thinness of their hides and hair that they are accounted tenderer than most other breeds  upon them than any other breed the Alderneys excepted but the most essential difference consists in the quantity of milk they give beyond most other breeds there being instances of cows giving quarts of milk per day and of firkins of butter being made from a dairy of cows but the more general quantity is fir∣kins per cow in a season and quarts of milk per day  Their colour is much varied but they mostly are an agreeable mixture of red and white From their being in many places called the Dutch breed it is probable they were originally brought from the Continent  They have been much improved of late years by the exertions and attention of enterprising breeders who have already improved them so far as to be sold fat to the butchers at ½ years old The weight of the carcase is in general from to stone lb to the stone but there are instances of individuals attaining much greater weight  Sir H Grey bred and fed two sevenyears old oxen that weighed stone lb the four quarters only and a spayed heifer stone lb ditto Mr Smith of Togstone a cow stone lb ditto  But large size is not now considered as an excellence Quick seeders that lay their sat upon the most valuable parts and have the least offal in the coarse parts are the kind which every enlightened breeder wishes to be possess∣ed of  The long Horns  have been introduced from the improv∣ed stocks of the Midland counties at different times and by different breeders but have in most instances given way again to the improved breed of short horns  The Devonshire breed  is only in the possession of Walter Trevelyan Esq of Nether Witton who introduced them about three years since their offspring has not yet got to a proper age to form a judgment of their comparative merits  The Wild Cattle  are only found in Chillingham Park belonging to the Earl of Tankerville and as it is probable they are the only remains of the  true and genuine  breed of  WILD CATTLE in Chillingham Park  that species of cattle  We are no strangers that there may be found in two or three different Parks of the kingdom breeds of cattle which pass under the denomination of Wild Cattle but are inclined to believe that they have been contaminated by crossing and that those in Chillingham Park are the only remains which answer the descrip∣tion given by  Boethius  of this species of cattle  we shall be more particular in our description  Their colour is invariably white muzzle black the whole of the inside of the ear and about one third of the outside from the tip downwards red horns white with black tips very fine and bent upwards Some of the bulls have a thin upright mane about an inch and an half or two inches long The weight of the oxen is from to stone and the cows from to stone the four quarters lb to the stone The beef is fine∣ly marbled and of excellent flavour  From the nature of their pasture and the frequent agitation they are put into by the curiosity of strangers it cannot be expected they should get very fat yet the six years old oxen are generally very good beef From whence it may be fairly supposed that in proper situa∣tions they would feed well  At the first appearance of any person they set off in full gallop and at the distance of two or three hundred yards make a wheel round and come boldly up again tosting their heads in a menacing manner on a sudden they make a full stop at the distance of forty or fifty yards looking wildly at the object of their surprize but upon the least motion being made they all again turn round and gallop off again with equal speed but not to the same distance forming a shorter circle and again returning with a bolder and more threatening aspect than before they approach much nearer probably within thirty yards when they make another stand and again gallop off this they do several times shortening their  instance and advancing nearer till they come within a few yards when most people think it prudent to leave them not chusing to provoke them further as it is pro∣bable that in a few turns more they would make an at∣tack  The mode of killing them was perhaps the only mo∣dern remains of the grandeur of ancient hunting On notice been given that a wild bull would be killed upon a certain day the inhabitants of the neighbourhood came mounted and armed with guns c sometimes to the number of an hundred horse and four or five hundred foot who stood upon walls or got into trees while the horsemen rode off the bull from the rest of the herd un∣til he stood at bay when a marksman dismounted and shot At some of these huntings twenty or thirty shots have been fired before he was subdued on such occa∣sions the bleeding victim grew desperately furious from the smarting of his wounds and the shouts of savage joy that were echoing from every side from the number of accidents that happened this dangerous mode has been seldom practised of late years the parkkeeper alone generally shooting them with a rifled gun at one shotWhen the cows calve they hide their calves for a week or ten days in some sequestered situation and go and suckle them two or three times a day If any person come near the calves they clap their heads close to the ground and lie like a hare in form to hide themselves This is a proof of their native wildness and is corroborated by the following circumstance that happened to the writer of this narrative who found a hidden calf two days old very lean and very weak on stroking its head it got up pawed two or three times like an old bull bellowed very loud retired a few steps and bolted at his legs with all its force it then began to paw again bellowed step∣ped back and bolted as before but knowing its inten∣tion  and stepping aside it missed me fell and was so very weak that it could not rise though it made several efforts but it had done enough the whole herd were alarmed and coming to its rescue obliged me to retire for the dams will allow no person to touch their calves without attacking them with impetuous ferocity  When any one happens to be wounded or grown weak and feeble through age or sickness the rest of the herd set upon it and gore it to death  Dairy  This county cannot boast of its dairies those who live in the vicinity of Newcastle and other populous places make a handsome return by the sale of milk fresh butter c but upon most of the large farms in this coun∣ty dairies are not held in much estimation  Breeding young cattle  is practised in almost every part of the county Upon the large farms cows are kept more for this purpose than the profit of dairying there are in∣stances of or calves being brought up in one season by one farmer who did not milk more than fifteen cows Calves are certainly best reared with milk but where such numbers are bred many different things have been mixed with or substituted for this nutritive and natural diet oats and b  an meal oil cake lintseed boiled turnips c are used and have their various advocates but lint∣seed is most approved eggs are excellent for mixing in the calf's food when cheap in the Spring perhaps they cannot be better employed In the Summer the calves are turned to grass and in the first Winter get turnips and straw After being a year old they are kept in Sum∣mer on coarse pasture and in Winter on straw only  Hiring Bulls  for the season is practised in this coun∣ty as high as guineas have been paid for a bull of the shorthorned breed for one season and from to guineas given for serving a cow but the more common premium is a guinea  SECT  Of Sheep  In this county there are three distinct breedsThe Cheviot sheep the Heath sheep and the longwooled sheep  The Cheviot sheep  are hornless the faces and legs in general white  Many of the Cheviot sheep have dark faces and were more so formerly We were informed by Mr Chisholm Mr Readhead Mr Marshall c that these darkfaced ones grew equally as fine wool were as hardy and equally as good thrivers as the whitefaced ones but that the people to whom they sold their sheep and especially tups preferred white faces for which rea∣son they have endeavoured to get quit of black faces  The  best breeds  have a sine open coun∣tenance with lively prominent eyes body long fore quarters wanting depth in the breast and breadth both there and on the chine fine clean small boned legs thin pelts weight of carcase when fat from to lb per quarter fleeces from ½ to ½ lb each and sold in for d per lb The wool is not all sine there being in a fleece of lb weight only lb of sine wool worth one shilling per lb when the whole fleece sells at d per lb and one pound of coarse worth only d per lb  They are bred only upon the hilly districts in the north∣west part of the county and do not extend much farther south than Reedwater  The  best kind  of these sheep are certainly a very hardy and valuable mountain sheep where the  pasture is mostly green sward  or contains a large portion of that kind of herbage which is the case with all the hills around Che∣viot where these sheep are bred for as to the mountain of Cheviot itself no kind of sheep whatever are bred up∣on it and we find it an universal practice amongst the most experienced sheep farmers to depasture the  heathy  A RAM of the CHEVIOT BREED  A CHEVIOT EWE  districts  with old sheep gimmers and wethers but they never attempt to keep a breeding flock upon them  Mr Robson of Chatto informed us that ewes and lambs would not do upon his farms of  Common Burn  near Wooler and  Felhope  and  Carshope  at the head of Coquet On such situ∣ations the gimmers are found to be hardier or do better than the wether sheep of the same age called Dinmonts  Blindburn is probably the highest and coarsest pasture in this county where this kind of sheep are bred We examined the herbage and found that the ewepasture had a considerable portion of green sward the coarsest parts of which consisted of  Nardus stricta  Wirebent  The English names inserted after the Latin ones are such as the Cheviot shepherds know them by  Juncus squarrosus  Stoolbent  Scirpus caespitosus  Deer hair  Eriophorum vaginatum the leaves  Ling  In the county of Durham Yorkshire and some other parts  erica vulgaris  is known by the name of  ling  This plant grows in wet mossy places it generally springs in February and March The sheep are remarkably fond of it not only the flowering stem but the roots and will s  ratch away the mossy soil six or eight inches deep to obtain it We have seen them working up to the eyes for this purpose The shepherds tell wonderful tales of the nutritive powers of this plant asserting that sheep reduced by hunger will recover faster and thrive much better upon this plant than turnips It is certainly a valuable plant for three or four weeks but after it has flowered the sheep totally neglect the flower stem  moss  and depasture only on the leaves  ling  It is somewhat singular that the Cheviot shepherds should con∣sider the  flowering stem  and the  leaves  of this plant as two dis∣tinct species nor could some of them be convinced to the con∣trary until the plant was taken up and they were shown that their  moss  and  ling  grew both from the same root  Eriophorum vaginatum the flowering  Eriophorum vaginatum stem  Moss  Erica vulgaris  Heath or Hadder  The shape of this breed of sheep has been much im∣proved of late years but all those who have been aiding in making such improvements readily acknowledge  there is still much to be done especially to the fore quar∣ter which they all agree is very defective but we hope it will not long remain so as we think we see a spirit of in∣vestigation arising amongst these breeders that in a few years will remedy not only this defect but will discover others which at present they are not willing to admit But as knowledge is progressive we cannot expect the perfection of this breed of sheep can be obtained at once it must proceed by slow gradations as every other im∣provement hath done it is a great point gained that we admit defects and are desirous to amend them  That breed of sheep which brings the most profit to the farmer will always be pursued by him whatever his situation but that object we presume is not to be ob∣tained in this district from  fine wool alone  Perfect moun∣tain sheep should be  active hardy well formed  and  quick seeders  these qualities will always recommend them to the grazier who will never purchase a slow feeding ani∣mal while he can get one of a different sort though at a considerable advanced price But if to these qualities so essential to the sale of a mountain farmer's stock can be added a  fleece of fine wool  a breed of sheep would then be obtained the properest for a hilly district of any we have yet seen There is little doubt but this may be accomplish∣ed by  proper selection  and probably the  best kind  of Cheviot sheep from their hardiness and producing a portion of fine wool are the properest stock for laying the founda∣tion of so desirable an improvement  Mr Robson of Belford now of Chatto says he im∣proved the shape of his sheep very considerably particu∣larly the forequarter and the wool in having less but∣tocks by using three rams which he purchased in Lin∣colnshire thirtythree years since and we know other in∣stances of improvement by using tups of ⅓ or ¼ Dishley  blood In all these cases we do not find the sheep less hardy or wool of less value but the carcase materially improved  Mr Smith of Woodhall had some of his Cheviot ewes put to a tup of Mr Thompson's the produce of which were ex∣amined when months old by Mr Robert Thompson and the report was that the form was amazingly improved and the gimmers stood the Winter remarkably well This Gentleman is pursuing the experiment and we hope will find the produce of the  third  or  fourth  cross sufficiently active and hardy for seeking their food on many of the hilly pastures around Cheviot  Mr Readhead of Chatto is of opinion that there are some situations amongst the Cheviothills where the South Down sheep might be successful those who are possessed of such would do well to make a  fair  experi∣ment should it succeed a very great improvement of the Cheviot wool in point of fineness would be derived by crossing with this breed but probably what it gained in fineness it would lose in weight for it is not the value per  pound  which constitutes the farmer's profit but the value  per fleece  or rather that breed is  the best  which brings the  most profit in fleece and carcase jointly  This criterion militates very strongly against the Spanish sheep unless they can be found with carcases of superior form and inclination to fatten to any we have yet seen  from the same ground in equal times Opinions and conjectures will never decide this matter it can only be done by  fair  experiments conducted by persons of judgment and im∣partiality  The Mode of Management  amongst the sheep farmers of these hills is to divide their flock into different parcels viz lambs hogs gimmers ewes and wethers and each parcel kept on such pasturage as is thought most proper for them Every parcel is attended by a shepherd who is bound to return the number of sheep delivered to him either alive or in his account of dead sheep which are in  general sold at different prices according to their good∣ness  The ewes are ½ years old before they are put to the tup and are kept till five or six years old the loss of lambs is sometimes very considerable not only on being dropped but also from other disorders as the  "milkill"  which attacks them from to days old the  "quarterill"  c which Mr Chisholm of Clennel estimates at not less than  per cent  taking one year with another And Mr Smith of Woodhall says that "altho' the Cheviot breed be as healthy as perhaps any yet there can hardly be an instance adducible of any of the different sheep flocks coming all to the shears much less the hogs out of which it is common to allow two out of each score"  The Heath Sheep  have large spiral horns black faces and legs a fierce wildlooking eye and short firm carcasses weighing from to lb per quarter covered with long open coarse shagged wool The fleeces weigh from three to four pounds each and sold in for six∣pence per pound They are an exceedingly active and hardy race and seem the best adapted of all others to high exposed  heathy  districts such as we find them in possession of here from the western parts of the county of Durham to North Tyne  Mr Hopper of Blackhedley buys year old wethers of this kind of sheep for s d each and twoyear olds for s which he depastures upon a  heathy moor  of acres from whence he takes them at ½ years old to tur∣nips and sells the May following from to shil∣lings each he has tried the Cheviot sheep in the same manner but thinks the other a hardier and better feeding sheep  Mr Hopper says that the best sheep of this kind he has tri∣ed are bred about Moffat in Scotland  A RAM of the HEATH BREED  The breeders of this kind of sheep on the south west corner of the county are very confident that they are a  much hardier sheep  than the Cheviot breed and upon their high exposed heathy mountains where there is  very little green herbage  much more profitable while the Cheviot farmers assert that theirs are equally hardy and that the greater value of the fleece gives them a decided superiority We have before stated that the fineness of wool is not a proper criterion by which the merits of a breed of sheep are to be determined it can only be done by fair experiment in which all the circumstances of the case are included but we do not find that this has ever been done by either party and tho' it is only opinion a∣gainst opinion yet both parties are so positive that they are ready to quarrel with any person who happens to ex∣press an opinion of his own we shall therefore content ourselves with stating that the question can only be pro∣perly decided by a parcel of each kind of ewes suppose being depastured and kept in every respect equally alike upon some of those high exposed situations the height of which is much more elevated and the herbage much coarser than the Cheviot pastures and almost to∣tally covered with  Heath or Hather Erica Vulgaris  And at the end of  five six or seven years  that breed which has brought the greatest number of sheep to mar∣ket and made the most profit will deservedly be deemed the  hardiest best  and  most eligible  for such situations  Until some experiment of this kind determine the matter we hope we shall not give offence to either party by stating that we have seen the heath sheep bred with advantage upon higher and coarser pastures than  Common Burn  or those others around Cheviot which are deemed improper for a breeding flock of the Cheviot kind and that it may probably turn out that each breed is particu∣larly adapted to particular situations the one to  coarse expos∣ed  mountains  where the luxury of green herbage is thinly scattered or rarely to be found the other to  hilly pastures  where considerable portions of verdant surface predomin∣ate such as characterize the pastoral districts around Cheviot  The longwoolled sheep  which formerly occupied the lower district of this county were called  Muggs  probably from their faces being covered with a muff of wool close to their eyes These being a slow feeding tribe have given way to the Dishley breed which were first intro∣duced into this county in the year  By Messrs Culley  and by their superior merit have so far made their way against every prejudice and opposition that it is probable in a few years there will be a difficulty in finding a flock that is not more or less related to the Dishley blood  The improved breed of longwoolled sheep  are distinguish∣ed from other longwoolled kinds by their fine lively eyes clean heads straight broad flat backs round barrellike bodies very fine small bones thin pelts and that sin∣gular property of making fat at an early age perhaps more than any thing else gives them a superiority over the other breed in this island  The weight of the carcase in general is ewes three or four years old from to lb per quarter the wool upon an average ½lb a fleece the length from to inches sold in at d per lb  The most approved mode of management of this breed of sheep is as follows The ewes generally lamb in March when we give them a few turnips to increase their milk The latter end of June or beginning of July the lambs are weaned and sent to middling pasture but a good pasture would certainly be a more eligible practice The ewes are milked two or three times to ease their udders and such  A new shorn RAM of the improved LONG WOOLED BREED  as are not intended to be continued for breeding are cul∣led or draughted out and put to clover when this fails they get turnips and are sold about Christmas to the butchers very fat the price from to s each fre∣quently measuring four or five inches thick of fat on the sides and two or three inches down the back all the way from head to tail And though this breed be not emi∣nent for much tallow yet ewes under such circumstances have been known to produce from eighteen to twentyfour pounds of tallow each  The lambs after being weaned take the name of Hogs They are generally put to turnips the beginning of Novem∣ber and continue at them till the middle of April or be∣ginning of May when the wether hogs are put upon good pasture or second year's clover The second Win∣ter they have turnips until the clovers are sufficiently grown to receive them which is generally about the middle of April they are clipped or shorn about the middle of May when we begin to sell them and are most∣ly all sold by the middle or end of June Morpeth is our best market where the two shear wethers are generally sold for from forty to fifty shillings a head in they sold for l per head on an average At this age they are equally fat as the ewes before described  Of late years it has been customary to fell the shearling wethers in June or July to the butchers fatter than most other breeds will be at two or three years old the weight of these shearling wethers is from to lb per quarter  We generally reckon one third of the ewes to have twin lambs They are put to the tup so as to have lambs at two years old and kept for breeding until three or four years old except such as are of particular good forms or have other valuable properties these we keep as long as ever they will breed Such as are defective in  shape suspected of being slow feeders or other unprofit∣able qualities we never put to the tup or attempt to breed from them  Letting Tups  to serve ewes for the season has been a practice in this county for near years and is becoming more prevalent daily the prices vary from five to one hundred guineas for the use of one sheep and ewes are frequently taken in to be served by a favourite ram at as high rates as from to guineas each The number of ewes to be served by a shearing tup is generally stipulat∣ed not to exceed and for an aged sheep  At the first introduction of this breed of sheep a great prejudice was raised against them and clamorous outcries made that their adoption would be the ruin of the country and no means were left untried to depreciate their value but every obstacle has been overcome by their superior merit which seems now to be universally acknowledged as may be judged from the following cir∣cumstance  In October Mr Thompson of Chillingham Barns having quitted a farm he advertised to sell by auction ewes in lots of each     £  s  d     The first ewes sold on an average for        per lot of each  The second for        ditto  The first gimmers for        ditto  Several lots of the gimmers sold for above l each lot one in particular for l or l s each sheep  The highest lot of ewes was l or l s each  The purchasers amounted to upwards of amongst whom were several that a few years before were the most violent and loudest exclaimers against any "change or innovation" in the established breed of the country  Breeding Sheep  of the longwoolled kind to be sold to  graziers to fatten is practised by the occupiers of such farms as do not afford a sufficiency of turnips or such as do not produce any those who are in the latter predica∣ment either take turnips for wintering their hogs or put them upon good old grass pastures The wethers are generally sold in September and October being then shearlings for from s to s each and the ewes three and a half years old from s to s each in they were as high as l each  There are few or no sheep bred in those parts of the county called CastleWard Bedlingtonshire and the south east corner of Morpeth Ward  The modern maxims of breeding were introduced in∣to this county by one of Mr Bakewell's first disciples up∣wards of years since previous to which  "big bones"  and  "large size"  were looked upon as the principal cri∣teria of excellence and a sacred adherence to the rule of never breeding within the canonical degree of relation∣ship but those prejudices are at this period in a great measure done away and the principal farmers of this district may now be classed amongst the most scientific breeders in the kingdom who have pursued it with an ardour and unremitting attention that have not failed of success  It is this knowledge of breeding and the nice discrimination of selecting proper stock for grazing added to their improved mode of cultivation that gives them a celebrity of character for their extensive knowledge in rural affairs and that has for some years back made this district  a School for Agriculture  where pu∣pils from various parts have come to be instructed  Salving  was formerly universally practised and it was thought the sheep could not do well without it In the lower districts it is now almost totally disused and some of the hill farmers have laid it aside and find their flocks do equally well as before and the wool sells for a much better price than when it is salved but it is of less weight  as may be naturally expected from the want of near ¾ of a pound of salve upon each fleece  This salve is composed of lb of butter and quarts of tar mixed well together while warm which quantity serves sheep the number a man will salve in a day  Milking  It used to be a general practice through all this county to milk ewes after the lambs were weaned for six eight or ten weeks from this milk great quantities of cheese were made and sold for about d per pound When kept to three or four years old it is exceedingly pungent and on that account some people prefer it to cheese of a much better quality  To milk ewes two or three times after the lambs are weaned is a useful practice but when continued to eight or ten weeks it becomes very detrimental keeps the ewes lean and ill prepared for meeting the severities of Winter  This custom has been long disused by the intelligent farmers in the lower districts and we are glad to sind it much laid aside by the most considerable hill farmers The profit of milking ewes for six or eight weeks is esti∣mated at d per ewe and it is generally agreed they are decreased in value at least s d per head of course there is a loss of about s per head by milking In one in∣stance of milking longwoolled ewes last Summer there was a loss of at least s per head  SECT  Horses  The best draught horses used in this county are brought from Clydesdale in Scotland they are in general from ½ to hands high strong hardy remarkable good and true pullers a restive horse being rarely found a∣mong them  Those bred in the county are of various sorts descend∣ed from stallions of different kinds from the full blood  racer to the strong heavy roughlegged black From the full blood stallions and country mares are bred excel∣lent hunters road and carriage horses and from the o∣ther kinds of stallions are bred the draught horses which in general are middle sized active animals well adapted to the husbandry of the country  We have before observed that since the price of horses had been so very high several oxen had been used for the draught but whether with propriety or advantage will appear from  A comparative Statement between HORSES and OXEN for the purpose of the Draught  BY way of preliminary it will be necessary to admit as data That a horse which eats bushels of oats per year will not consume of other food so much as an ox that gets no corn  This is deduced from the following experiments  Three working horses about ½ hands high eat in days stones of hay which is for each horse at the rate of stones a week with an allowance of oats gallons per week  Mr Thompson's of Chillingham Barns horses in days eat stones of hay which is stones per week each horse allowance of oats gallons per week  Mr Atkinson's of Yevering eat per week stones of hay bushels of potatoes and gallons of oats  Mr Jobson's of Newtown years old working oxen with a full allowance of hay had each ox quarts of oats per day  In days oxen eat stones lb of hay which is after the rate for each ox  of hay ½ stones per week  of oats ½ gallons ditto  Three days after the same oxen were put to hay only and in days eat stones lb or stones each ox per week which is only ¼ stone more than when they got ½ gallons of corn in the same time This is a singular circumstance and deserving of further investigation  An unworked ox ½ years old was put to good old meadow hay the th of November and eat stones in days or per week stones lb  An idle horse ½ hands high eat of the same hay stones in days or per week stoneshad no corn  but in the following estimate we shall al∣low  horses to eat as much as oxen as the difference is not yet sufficiently ascertained  That the oxen are yoked at years old and are worked till six and for the first year require to do the work of horses but after having been worked a year and become tractable and stronger are equal to horses either by being yoked three at a time or two and driven by the holder with cords of course the expence of a driver may be estimated to be saved for one half the year  That the expences of a ploughman the plough and other articles that are the same in both teams need not be taken into the account  And that oxen to work regularly through the year cannot work more than half a day at a time  Expence of an ox per ann     £  s  d  SummeringGrass acres at s per acre        Wintering     £  s  d  on straw turnips        but if on hay        The average is  A great portion of

oxen        The average expence of an ox team from to years old that will do the same quantity of work as horses        The conclusions to be drawn from the above statement are so obvious as to need little elucidation but we can∣not help remarking how strong the force of prejudice must be to continue the use of horses and heavy clumsy unwieldy  wheel ploughs  where a simple  swing plough  and horses yoked double and driven by the holder would do the same quantity of work equally well and at one third the expence  But before any proper conclusions can be drawn whe∣ther  ox teams  or  horses  are the most eligible it will be necessary to consider whether the quantity of land em∣ployed in supporting those animals be used in the most profitable mode to the community as well as the occupier  With the latter the first question for consideration is whether oxen used in the team or in grazing will pay him the most money  Suppose oxen at  three years old  were put to the plough and plough acres per week which at s d  If to this s d be added s d the wages for the plough∣man and driver it will make s the usual price for ploughing an acre in this district  per acre is shillings and if they work weeks in a year then their whole earnings after deducting l for  expences of harness shoeing c will be l but if they plough only  acres per week  which is probably nearer the truth then their whole earnings will be on∣ly l  The same oxen put to graze to pay the same money should improve in value l s each in the first case and l s in the latter but we are inclined to believe there are few situations if the cattle are of a good quick feeding kind where they would not pay  considerably more  In respect to the community the account will be nearly as follows  From the above statements we find that an ox for summering and wintering requires  ½ acres  therefore a ox team will require  ditto  And horses for grass and hay per ann require  ditto  For corn straw  ditto  Land necessary for keeping horses per ann  ditto  The difference is the quantity of land required for a team of oxen more than horses  acres  Hence it appears that a team of oxen requires acres more land to maintain them than a team of horses which will do the same work and of course the produce which might be derived from this acres is lost to the community suppose it be one half in grass and the other half in ploughing then we shall have  Acres of clover or grass  ⅔ Ditto of oats  ⅔ Ditto of turnips or fallow  ⅔ Ditto of wheat  It would then send to market yearly at the lowest computation  ½ Cwt of beef  Quarters of oats  And Ditto of wheat  From this view of the subject it appears that if oxen were universally used for the draught in the room of horses there would be a considerable defalcation in the supply of the markets both in corn and animal food  In this county it is estimated that there are capable of cul∣tivation acres and allowing ⅓ of this to be in tillage that is acres and that every acres in tillage will require a team to manage it properly of course there will be at least teams but for the sake of round numbers call it teams     £  Then × ½ cwts beef = cwts beef at s    × qrs oats = qrs oats at s    × qrs wheat = qrs wheat at s       £  The value in provisions that would be lost in this county yearly if horse teams were abolished and oxen used in their stead  And the loss to the farmer would be the profit derived from the produce which by the usual mode of allowing onethird for the farmer's profit would in this case be about l  SECT  Swine  The  Berkshire pigs  and the large  white breed  were formerly the most prevalent in this county but the small  black Chinese breed  has in a great measure supplanted them especially upon the large farms and these are likely to give way to a small white breed lately introduced remark∣ably quiet inoffensive animals on which account they are principally preferred to the Chinese breed  SECT  Rabbits  Rabbits  are found in considerable numbers among the sand hills along the coast and are probably the most eligi∣ble stock for such situations having been sold of late years for per couple  SECT  Goats  Goats  are kept in small numbers on many parts of the Cheviot hills not so much as an object of profit but the shepherds assert the sheep slocks are healthier where a few goats depasture This probably may be the case as it is well known that goats eat some plants with impunity that are deadly poison to other kinds of domestic animals  The chief profit made of these goats is from their milk being sold to invalids who come to Wooler in the Sum∣mer season  SECT  Poultry  Poultry  in a district like this where they are sold so low are the most unprofitable stock kept upon a farm the value of the corn consumed by them being generally double to what they are sold for and the labouring people are so well convinced of their inutility that they con∣stantly and universally sell them knowing from experi∣ence that if the value received for them be laid out in either beef or mutton it will be much more serviceable and this piece of economy is so well understood that we believe there is scarce an instance of a labouring person ever making use of poultry for his own family they are always considered as articles  purposely bred to pamper luxuty  CHAPTER XIV  RURAL ECONOMY  SECT  Labour c  THROUGH the greatest part of this county and es∣pecially upon the large farms there are very few ser∣vants kepts in the house seldom more than two men and two maids but the ploughman carters barnmen shep∣herds c have each a house and garden or yard to them∣selves and are generally married The conditions of servitude for one year are     £  s  d  Cows kept o  money in lieu at l each        Bushels of wheat at s per bush        Ditto of oats at s d ditto        Ditto of barley at s d ditto        Ditto of rye at s d ditto        Ditto of pease at s d ditto        lb of cast wool at d per lb        Bushel of potatoes planted a pig tethered keeping hens c        Carriage of coals six cart loads        In all        They are bound to sind a woman labourer to work for the following wages for harvesting d per day for hoe∣ing  turnips  In this branch of labour the women in the northern parts of the county excel the writer of this note has at different times visited  Norfolk Suffolk  and all the principal turnip districts in the island but never law turnips  so well hoed  and  compleatly cleaned  or kept in such  gardenlike culture  as on these borders  haymaking scaling weeding corn c used to be d per day but was last year raised to d per day  In addition to the above conditions the shepherd gen∣erally has as many sheep kept as are worth four or five pounds a year but if he has any undershepherd to keep to assist him the number is increased accordingly In the hilly districts their sheep sometimes amount to hun∣dreds besides six or eight neat cattle  An overseer or head servant has in addition to the a∣bove as much money as to make his place worth from l to l a year  Threshing is mostly done by the piece a twentyfifth part of the corn threshed being the general custom if the straw be taken away unfolded but if the thresher folds the straw he has a twentyfirst part and finds a woman to dress the corn and to work at all other work for the same wages as the others he has straw for his cow in Winter but pays for her Summer's grass  The yearly wages of house servants are for men from l to l for women l to l  The wages of day labourers without victuals or any al∣lowance of beer are     s  d  s  d  For Men in Summer    to      In the wages got up to s and in harvest to s d for men and for women to s d  Winter    to      Harvest    to      Women ditto    to         s  d  s  d  for other work    to      Masons    to      Carpenters    to      Upon some of the large farms a carpenter and smith are hired by the year  The hours of working are from six in the morning to six in the evening when the length of lay will permit with the following intervals of rest     H  M  At breakfast      Ten o'clock      Dinner      Four o'clock      In all    hours of rest and nine of labour  SECT  Provision  The price of grain in this county fluctuates very much betwixt the markets of Newcastle and Hexham and those of Alnwick Berwick and Wooler there is always a considerable difference  Wheat and barley in Newcastle market are mostly sixpence a bushel higher and in Hexham ninepence  the prices in the northern parts being in general the lowest on amongst the lowest in the kingdom owing to the produce being so much greater than the home consumption This surplus affords large quantities to be yearly exported from Berwick Ale∣mouth and other places along the northern part of the coast  The average prices of grain at Berwick in were     s  d     Wheat      per bushel  Rye      ditto     s  d     Barley      ditto  Oats      ditto  Pease      ditto  Fat stock being easily driven from one place to another keeps the price of butcher's meat more upon an equality in all the markets of the county  The average price of butcher's meat is from threepencehalfpenny to fourpencehalfpenny per pound but in May and June it generally gets to fivepence and the two last years has been sixpence and sevenpence     s  d     Butter      a pound of ounces  Skimmilk and ewe cheese    ½  ditto  Fat goose         Turkey         Duck         Chicken      s  d  Eggs per dozen    to      Potatoes per bush    to      SECT  Fuel  Upon the edges of the moors towards the western parts of the county a few peats are burnt but in every other part we believe coals are universally used  The quantity consumed by a poor family is from to cart loads a year  CHAPTER XV  POLITICAL ECONOMY  SECT  Roads  THE turnpike roads are mostly in good order those that have an opportunity of getting whinstone or limestone are the best but they certainly would be better if the surveyors would order the stones to be bro∣ken smaller and the roads made wider One great ob∣jection to some of these roads is the many steep banks they are disgraced with some of the worst might have been avoided but it seems the original settersout of these roads had a predilection for climbing and descend∣ing steep banks this is notorious on both the roads up∣on RimsideMoor without even the plea of being near∣er as the leveller road would have been nearer travelled in much less time and with far less fatigue Some similar cases appear on the post road which we hope will be remedied in the next application to Parliament for a new act  The township roads are in some places good but by far the greatestpart are deserving of a different appellation the cause of this deficiency is in most cases to be attributed to the neglect and manner of performing the statutework  One mode of remedying this neglect would be to ap∣point a surveyor with a small salary who should be em∣powered to collect the composition due for statutework  and  mploy th  money for repairing the road where  most necessary  for the  public in general  without having regard to the convenience or influence of individuals  A book should be kept by the surveyor and yearly ex∣amined settled and signed by a committee of inhabitants before it went to the magistrates We know from expe∣rience that by this means the road would be much bet∣ter made and in near double the quantity for when a farmer sends his cart to perform statuteduty it seldom carries more than half a load and the servants practise every manoeuvre to put off time and do as little as possi∣ble which would not be the case with hired carts as every inhabitant would be ready to report any malpractices  SECT  Canals  In this county there are no Canals and notwithstand∣ing heir manifest utility to a district like this where such immense quantities of heavy articles are to be conveyed yet we believe no attempt was ever made or even so much as a canal projected in any part of the county before when some gentlemen on Tweedside had it in con∣templation to make a navigable canal from the collieries and lime works near Berwick to Kelso in Scotland and from thence up the Tweed and Tiviot but a survey be∣ing made by Mr Whitworth it was dropt probably on account of the great expence  The next public notice we can trace was given by Mr Dodd in of a canal from Newcastle to Carlisle or M  ryport in Cumberland to join the east and west seas This was to pass on the  south side  of Tyne but Mr Chap∣man proposed a line to pass on the  north side  of Tyne the peculiarity of which was that it should come from Hay∣donBridge to the  upper parts  of Newcastle upon  one level without a lock  and the goods conveyed from thence  to the river either by a kind of staircase of locks or in waggons on an inclined plane By this proposal the principal supporters of the grand canal were divided intotwo parties the consequence of which was that the money to compleat the great design of uniting the two seas could not be raised and of course it was given up one on the north side proposed  to stop  at  HaydonBridge  and another on the south side at  Hexham  The subscriptions for defraying the expence of the north line we were informed were filled and application was made to Parliament in to obtain an Act for making a canal on the north side but it met with so strong an opposition from the land owners that it was thought pro∣per to withdraw it  The subscribers for a canal on the south of the river still persevere in their endeavours to accomplish the line to Hexham or HaydonBridge and we have not heard that any opposition to the measure is intended by the pro∣prietors of lands through which it is to pass  SECT  Fairs  The principal Fairs in this County are  MAY  th  Wooler  for a few cattle sheep horses hiring servants c  th  Allendale  for cattle  th  Alnwick  A large show of both fat and lean cattle  th  Haltwhistle  for cattle chiefly cows for graz∣ing  JUNE  Tuesday before

of e∣very kind brings great numbers of dealers from London and various other distant places its celebrity has increas∣ed very much of late years and we believe it may be just∣ly classed amongst the first horse fairs in the kingdom  The show of cattle is also very great not only for the breed of the country but also for large droves of kyloes Scotch cattle which are purposely driven from the High∣lands to be sold at this fairThe fair on the th is held on the Townmoor and is called the  Cowhill fair  NOVEMBER  st  Rothbury  for young cattle  th  Hexham  Cattle  th  Allendale  Cattle mostly

Hexham  for corn and other provisions  Ditto  Belford  The chief support of this market is the sale of corn great quantities of which are sold by sam∣ple for exportation  Ditto  Newcastle  a small market for provisions of various kinds  Wednesday  Morpeth  for corn butcher's meat butter c and for fat cattle and sheep of the former on an average not less than weekly and of sheep and lambs  Mr Thomas Spours who has attended this market for up∣wards of years says that years since there was not half this number and he remembers that for several weeks in the Winter very few sheep or cattle if any were exhibited  which are bought up for the consump∣tion of Newcastle Shields Sunderland  It may be proper to remark that or years since the butchers of those places were obliged to purchase a great deal of fat stock in the neighbourhood of Darlington and other parts of the county of Durham the produce of the north not being equal to their demands but the scales are now turned the northern farmers being able not only to supply the increased population of those places but to send great numbers of both fat cattle and sheep every year to Leeds Wakefield Manchester c  c  Thursday  Wooler  principally for corn considerable quantities of which are sold by sample mostly for expor∣tation  Friday  Rothbury  This market is little more than nominal there being only one butcher who sells a few carcases and which constitutes nearly the whole of the market  Ditto  Allendale  for corn butcher's meat and con∣siderable quantities of potatoes and garden stuff from Hexham all for the supply of the mining district to the westward  Saturday  Newcastle  A very large market and well supplied with corn butcher's meat fish poultry but∣ter c  Dr Hutton in his Plan of Newcastle in states the annual consumption of this place to be catttle calves and sheep and lambs  Ditto  Alnwick  a large market for corn and pro∣visions of various kinds  Ditto  Berwick  for corn butcher's meat and other articles of provisions at both this market and Alnwick considerable quantities of corn are sold by sample for ex∣portation  SECT  Commerce  The commerce of this county is derived principally from the coal trade the ships belonging to the port of Newcastle in are stated by Mr Pennant to be their tonnage The principal exports are coals lead lead shot wrought iron grindstones pottery glass c  The exports from Berwick are chiefly corn flour oat∣meal shilled barley potatoes fish eggs wool c coast∣ways which has increased very much of late years the foreign trade is chiesly to the north of Europe  The number of vessels belonging to this port is about making upwards of tons the receipts of the customs are upon an average about l per ann  The port of Alemouth also employs a few vessels in ex∣porting corn flour c  And a few vessels are employed in the Summer season in carrying lime from the neighbourhood of Bambro' to different parts of Scotland  SECT  Manufactures  This county is not distinguished by any staple manu∣factures  the principal are derived from or connected with the coal trade and mines as shipbuilding roperies forges founderies copperas coal tar soda or marine alkali white lead potteries glass works c  Hexham has been long famed for its manufacture of gloves which employs about hands  To establish  manufactures of Woollens  two or three essays have been lately made at Alnwick Mitford and Acklington and a cotton Mill has been lately erected at NetherWitton all of which from present appearances we hope are doing well  There is one species of manufacture carried on in this district with an agricultural production of small value viz that of straw which is not only made use of as a covering for the heads of the wives and daughters of the humble cottager but has also lately been converted into orna∣ments that might accompany the richest and most splen∣did dress which the palace or the drawingroom ex∣hibits and for the honour of the plough has not only been converted into buttons for the men but also into rings and earrings for the ladies  Agriculture is certainly benefited by manufactures in the consumption of its produce by the great number of people employed but we do not find any new modes of practice or improvements in agriculture introduced in their vicinity or resulting from the exertions of those connected with them  SECT  Poor  We do not find any mode of managing the poor in this county different from that generally used in other districts  In those townships where they are collected and main∣tained in poor houses the rates are easier than where they are relieved at their own houses We are inclined to be∣lieve  that workhouses under proper regulations would not only considerably lessen the rates but the poor might be supported more comfortably  SECT  Population  Of the population we could not collect sufficient da∣ta from whence even a tolerable guess could be made  CHAPTER XVI  OBSTACLES TO IMPROVEMENT  In our journey through this county wherever we en∣quired what was the chief obstacle to improvement the answer was universally  "Tithes"  An imposition so preg∣nant with mischief and so often the source of violent dis∣sensions betwixt the clergy and their parishioners should if possible be removed either by purchase commutation or any other means by which a  fair equivalent  shall be rendered for them for so long as they exist it is impos∣sible to expect that agricultural improvements will be car∣ried on to the extent of which they are capable In our Survey of Cumberland we have shewn the great uncer∣tainty of employing money in speculations of improving land and that the tithes in such cases are a large por∣tion of a man's capital in trade and not a tenth of he natural produce of the earth which some have thought was all that was intended by the original imposers who no doubt meant them for a good purpose but if through a succession of ages a change of manners of sentiments  and of cultivation has taken place and the ill effects of tithes be universally felt and acknowledged to lesson the quantity of food obtainable from a considerable portion of this kingdom a change in the mode of paying tithes would also be desirable for the proprietors of such lands are not only losers but the community at large It is sur∣prizing that a grievance of such magnitude should have so long evaded the revision and regulation of the legisla∣ture and that it should be always so strenuously opposed by the clergy there being no wish to take any thing from them but to render a  fair equivalent  for what is their due and which there would be little difficulty in doing not∣withstanding the many objections that have been invent∣ed to perplex this most interesting question  CHAPTER XVII  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS  SECT  Agricultural Societies  THERE never was any Agricultural Society in this county and if any ever had existed it probably would have been soon dissolved if we may judge from the ex∣periments that have been made in some neighbouring dis∣tricts where we find that after a few years continuance they have been given up but whether from a radical de∣fect in the institutions the nonattendance and indiffer∣ence of members or the  injudicious distribution of prizes  we are not prepared to say but think that public farms are much more likely to promote improvements in the Science of Agriculture  SECT  Weights and Measures  Weights and measures  are in a sad state of confusion a pound a stone a bushel a boll are rarely the same in different markets and frequently vary in the same mar∣ket for different articles  At Newcastle  Beatments  Peck  Pecks  Kenning  Kennings  Bushel  Winchester  Bushels  Boll  At Hexham  For Wheat Rye and Pease  Quarts  Forpit  Forpits  Peck  Pecks  Bushel  Bushels  Boll equals  Winchester bushels  For Oats and Barley  Quarts  Forpit  Forpits  Peck  Pecks  Bushel  Bushels  Boll =  bushels Winchester  At Alnwick  Quarts  Forpit  Forpits  Peck  Pecks  Bushel  Winchester  Bushels  Boll of Wheat  Bushels  Boll of Barley or Oats  At Wooler  Quarts  Forpit  Forpits  Peck  Pecks  Bushel  Bushels  Boll  A stone of wool in some parts is lb in others lb and a stone of every other article is lb  The Board of Agriculture could not do the public a greater service than by bringing forward a regulation of weights and measures One weight and one measure derived from the same root and increasing or decreasing in a ten fold ratio would introduce such simplicity ease and perspicuity into all transactions of business where calculations are necessary as would prevent the number∣less mistakes and errors which are daily happening  Preparations for remedying this great inconvenience have been made at different times and we believe here are sufficient materials for perfecting the measure when∣ever it is thought proper to bring it forward  SECT  Vermin  Moles and rats  are two species of vermin which we think capable of being in a great measure extirpated or so far reduced as to render their depredations of little consequence In Cumberland a mole is rarely to be seen this is in consequence of every occupier of land contribut∣ing his due proportion towards their destruction A similar plan established in this county for destroying ver∣min we believe would readily be complied with by every good farmer and the bad ones ought not to have it in their power to injure their more industrious neighbours  Crows  of late years have become a very great nui∣sance not only for rooting up wheat and other grain in a sprouting state but clover and protatoes corn stacks and young plantations are greatly injured by them Last Spring a collection of sixpence a plough was made by a few farmers in Glendale Ward for pulling down their nests Many thousands were destroyed by this means and we hope the practice will be continued until they are found less pernicious  Foxes  are very numerous and very destructive to young lambs in a district like this where so many sheep are bred but while they are so anxiously preserved for the chace we despair of seeing any regulations take place for reducing the numbers of this mischievous animal  Dogs  in every place are swarming two thirds of them at least are kept by people who have no manner of use for them and are constantly complaining of their ina∣bility to obtain food for their families It would be do∣ing these people an act of justice to exempt them from doing statute duty on the highways on condition they did not keep a dog and to supply the deficiency by lay∣ing a tax upon dogs which tax should be applied towards repairing the roads  Since the first edition of this report the Legistature have thought proper to lay a tax upon a certain description of dogs but have exempted the only ones which are a nuisance to the community  CONCLUSION  Review of some particular parts  IN taking a review of the foregoing report we find that the minerals are of great importance to this county In respect to the coals it appears that they are not inex∣haustible and in two or three centuries will probably be so far wrought out that the metropolis will have to be supplied from other districts with this necessary article of a very inferior quality and at a much higher price  The most striking parts in a view of the Agriculture are  the great extent of farms leases for years and the opulence intelligence and enterprising spirit of the farm∣ers but the most prominent feature is keeping a due balance betwixt the arable and grass lands so as always to have a large breeding live stock especially of sheepVa∣rious systems of husbandry have been tried and the boast∣ed one of turnips barley clover and wheat has been pursued till the crops have evidently declined particularly the turnips and clover and the only means of restoring such lands has been by adopting the system of three years arable and three years grass  depastured with sheep  and a small proportion of cattle by this mode nature has time to prepare a sufficient leaclod which being turned up for the turnip fallow will ensure a vigorous crop of tur∣nips as it is well known they always flourish upon fresh land or where they find the remains of a leaclod to vegetate in It is from this circumstance and the pecu∣liar and excellent mode of cultivating them that such great crops are produced with not more than  or    cart loads  of dung per acre crops that are seldom worth less than or l per acre for the purposes of feeding cattle and sheep have in some instances been sold for and l per acre This mode of cultivating turnips in drills is also of great importance being much superior to the broadcast culture not only for the turnip crop but for every other crop that succeeds them  The proportion betwixt the quantities in arable and grass varies according to the quality of the soil and other circumstances but in most situations it is usual to keep a certain portion of the best and richest old grazing lands constantly in grass as a "corps de reserve" in case the artificial grasses fail and on strong clayey soils for depas∣turing a portion of the store flock upon in winter for this purpose it is necessary upon such soils to have a much larger portion of old grass land than upon dry loams  and which is generally eaten lightly in the latter part of Summer that there may be a good aftermath against the time the artificial grasses fail  It is this union of stock and tillage and pursuing the system mentioned in page that enables the farmers to pay such high rents and which keeps the land always in a  due state of fertility  to produce the most profitable crops  There is a certain state of fertility necessary for producing maximum crops of grain land may be too rich as well as too poor for growing corn we have frequently seen crops of wheat rendered of little or no value by the injudicious application of a few cart loads of manure per acre more than was necessary upon lands made too rich corn is very apt to lodge which not only in∣jures the crop of grain but entirely destroys the clover and arti∣ficial grasses sown along with it  and at the same time is managed and kept clear of weeds at the least expence The portion that is kept in grass for three years breeds and fattens such a number of sheep as leave a considerable profit probably equal if not more than the arable crops the yearly profits of a sheep being estimated at not less than from to s or of which an acre of clover will fatten and an acre of turnips about double the number  But this system are obtained the principal advantages of folding without any of its inconveniences for if on an average The st year's clover grass carry sheep per acre for        weeks  d ditto  ditto  ditto  d ditto  ditto  ditto  and the turnips  ditto  ditto  that is  sheep per acre  for weeks which is after the rate of sheep per acre for one week  once in six years  at the same time that the sheep are leaving on an average a profit of shillings a year each  By this means and the lime and manure laid on the fallow turnips or drilled beans the lands are kept in the highest state of fertility for producing all kinds of grain and green crops and the profits from the sheep we presume are much greater than could be obtained from the  "foldingbreeds"  by the mode of folding practised in Norfolk and some other parts of the kingdom  It our farms were stocked with those breeds of sheep so much extolled for their folding properties and managed under the folding system we are clearly of opinion from having examined the various breeds that a very great diminution of rental would take place in a few years But when the Northumbrian farmers are informed that the profits of a Norfolk sheep in "lamb wool and fold∣ing are only from to shillings per year"  Sussolk report by A Young Esq  we need not be apprehensive that they will adopt this prac∣tice the remnant of a barbarous age when the country was for the most part in open townfields with appendant common but which we hope will give way to a more enlightened system though this prejudice for Foldingsheep like many others will probably require a series of years totally to extirpate it the misfortune is that those who know the least about stock are generally the most bigotted for retaining the original breeds of the country and the loudest to raise a clamour against innovation and attempts at improvement  It will be proper to observe that the sheep stock of this district has been so much improved within the last years that they can now be sold fatter at months old than they used to be at more than double that age yet we find that the same childish arguments were used at that time against changing the "established breed of the country" as are used by some people at this day in fa∣vour of the worst breed of sheep in the kingdom  This improvement in the sheep stock has been accom∣plished by the practice of hiring tups at no inconsiderable prices and which is now become so prevalent and so many competitors have entered the lists that we hope the spirit of emulation will not slacken and that we shall see additional improvements every year  Having thus taken a short review of the most striking features of the agricultural practice of this district we shall next proceed to offer a few hints on the  Means of Improvement  To those few who practise the system of taking two white crops to a fallow and of continuing their land in tillage for nine twelve or more years and of sowing it up with common hayseeds white clover c and letting it continue as many years in grass as it con∣tinued in tillage we would recommend the system in the article  Rotation of crops  page  Of drilling beans and pease  we have before expressed our surprise that so excellent a practice should be neg∣lected in all that extensive district along the sea coast where they are so much cultivated we hope that the good sense and enterprising spirit of the wealthy farmers of this district will no longer be swayed by old customs but will be ready to make a fair experiment of a system which has been practised on similar soils with success and may in all probability be equally beneficial on theirs The difference betwixt a naked fallow and a crop of beans is too striking to need any elucidation  Watered Meadows  There are many parts of this county capable of deriving great benefits from this prac∣tice especially where the waters are unmixed with vitriolic impurities derived from their connection with coal mines or strata of aluminous earth We have also our sus∣picions  of such waters as are strongly tinctured by infu∣sions of peatmoss  Draining  is also another operation from which great advantages are to result but they should be  hollow drains  executed with judgment and well secured and not  surface drains  a foot wide and six or eight inches deep such are mere  temporary reliefs  to a tenant but no  permanent im∣provement  In the live stock  of this county there is certainly great improvement to be made and like many other branches of science the more we investigate the subject the more we are convinced of its unlimited improvements but im∣provements of this kind are not so easily spread as those of cultivation If a farmer sees any modes of practice more beneficial than those he knew before he can readily adopt them or if he discovers and selects a new variety of any species of grain more productive and more valuable than any hitherto known it multiplies so fast that it is readily disseminated but  improved breeds of stock  are not so readily diffused they are much flower in their propa∣gation and much more easily contaminated and are only to be preserved by  attention  and  judgment  when  these  be∣come general we may hope that improved breeds of stock will prevail over the whole county this period is proba∣bly more distant than a true patriot would wish but in the mean time we hope that those who are already possessed of improved breeds of stock will not slacken in their pur∣suits that by their example the knowledge and practice of breeding may by degrees be better understood and a spirit of emulation more generally diffused When we consider and reflect how slow that most valuable breed of sheep now best known by the appellation of the  Dishley breed  has spread and how very small a part of this island they still cover one would be almost led to think that the breeders were not blessed with the senses of seeing and  feelingMr Bakewell has been employed above years in the important task of improving this breed of sheep to a degree of perfection unknown at any former period yet it is a very few years since many of his near neighbours pursued a very different and less lucrative species To this day we are pretty well informed that more than half the large fertile county of Lincoln continue to breed a slow feeding unprofitable kind though adjoining the county of Leicester which is the more to be regretted because that county certainly produces more sheep than any other in the island and perhaps we do not hazard too much if we assert it as our opinion that it sends more mutton to market than any two counties in the kingdom However we flatter ourselves that the labours of the Board of Agriculture will have a happy tendency towards opening men's eyes and convincing them of the propriety of not only cultivating the ground in a more masterly manner but of stocking their pastures with the most profitable animals  Public Farms  in every county conducted by proper persons would tend more towards forwarding the perfec∣tion of Agriculture in all its branches than any other measure that has ever been suggested and as the gentle∣men of large landed property would be the most interest∣ed in the results of such an institution they certainly ought to be the guardians and supporters of  The principal expence would be at its first institution when once got into a proper system it would require little if any further aid  If estates of l a year and upwards were only to contribute l per thousand yearly rent it would in this county raise a sum sufficient for setting forward the un∣dertaking We suppose the farms to contain from to acres of various sorts of land some mountain pas∣tures and an opportunity of converting a part of it into  watered meadows We know situations of this sort that might be rented for five or six hundred pounds ayear  A farm of this kind would not only be a school where youth might be instructed in agriculture but even experi∣enced farmers might often visit it with advantage to learn the results of new experiments and adopt those that pro∣mised to be useful It would be easy to enlarge on this subject and suggest many useful appendants to such an institution should the gentlemen of landed property ever think of carrying a scheme of this kind into execution  CUMBERLAND  A  tly a  rtile  with

and deg ½ min North and the longitudes of deg min and deg min West from London Its length from St Bee's Head in a N E direction to Butter Burn is miles and its mean breadth in a N W direction is miles  It is bounded on the east by Northumberland  miles  Durham    on the west by the Irish Sea    on the north by Scotland and the SolwayFirth    on the south by Westmorland    and Lancashire    Making the whole circumference  miles  and contains square miles or acres  SECT  Divisions  This county is divided into five wards vizCumber∣land Ward Eskdale Ward Leath Ward Allerdale Ward above Derwent and Allerdale Ward below Der∣went  SECT  Climate  In a county like Cumberland enjoying such an extent of seacoast and where so large a portion is occupied by mountains and those reckoned amongst the highest in the kingdom  The highest mountains in the kingdom are     Feet  Benevish in Scotland  the highest in Scotland  Benlomond ditto    Snowdon in Wales  the highest in Wales  Crossf  ll in Cumberland    the highest in England  Helvellin ditto    the highest in England  Skiddaw ditto    the highest in England  Saddleback ditto  the highest in England  Blackhouse heights Selkirkshire    Ettrick Pin ditto    Catter  l Roxburghshire    Whe  side Yorkshire    Ingleborough    the climate must be various Along the coast and for a considerable way up the rivers the snow sel∣dom lies above twentyfour hours but upon the moun∣tains the snow will continue for six or eight months of court the lower parts of the county are mild and tem∣perate while on the higher grounds and upon the moun∣tains and their vicinity the air is cold and piercing but the whole is healthy though subject to great and frequent falls of rain particularly in the Autumn which makes their harvests very precarious and expensive This excess of wet we believe is more or less the case upon the whole of the western coasts of the island  We have been favoured with the following Table shewing the perpendicular height of rain that has fallen at Keswick the last seven years by the ingenious Mr P Crosthwaite owner of the curious museum there                      Inch  Inch  Inch  Inch  Inch  Inch

st  Fertile clays  or rather  rich strong loams  occupy but a small portion of this county formerly this kind of soil was generally employed in grazing or the dairy but since the introduction of growing wheat it has been con∣verted into tillage and produces excellent crops of grain  d  Dry Loams  including the various degrees from the rich brown loam to the light sandy soils This is the most prevalent occupying a greater portion of the county than any other not only the lower districts but the fteep sides of the mountains are in general of this soil and in many places even their summits are covered with a dry sound earth producing green sward with little  heath we suppose at least one half of the lower or cul∣tivatable district is of this valuable soil excellently adapt∣ed to the culture of turnips artificial grasses the various species of grain and of breeding and feeding the most improved kinds of stock particularly sheep it being per∣fectly sound or safe from the rot  d  Wet Loam  generally on a clay bottom The fer∣tility of this soil is various depending on the thickness of the staple and the nature of the clay below it is danger∣ous for sheep but may be applied with advantage to keep∣ing cows for the dairy breeding young cattle and horses and to the culture of wheat oats clover and ray grass  th  Black Peat earth  is most prevalent on the moun∣tainous districts particularly those adjoining Northumber∣land and Durham it is also found on moors or com∣mons in the lower parts of the county in some places only a few inches thick upon a white sand well known by those whose lot it has been to cultivate it to be an ungrateful and unprofitable soil  The surface  is beautifully diversified with level plains and rising eminences deep sequestered vales and stupen∣dous mountains open braky heathy commons and ir∣regular inclosures in some parts enriched with tufted groves and rising plantations the whole watered with innumerable streams and extensive lakes abounding with fish of various denominations which with plenty of game add to the recreation and luxury of the inhabitantsIt naturally divides into two districts the  mountainous  incapa∣ble of being improved by the plough and the  cultivatable  or all such parts as have been or can be improved by tillage  The mountainous districts are separated into two divi∣sions one of which bounds the east side of the county and is the  highest part  of that ridge of mountains that divide the eastern and western coasts of the island from Derbyshire in England to Linlithgow in Scotland Crossfell  Hartsidefell Geltsdaleforest and Spadeadamwaste are the names of that portion of the ridge which passes through this county These mountains are composed of strata of different kinds of stone and are rich in coal lime and leadore but are no way remarkable for any striking irregularities of surface  The other division of mountainous district occupies the southwest part of the county known by the names of Skiddaw Saddleback Helvellin Wreynose Hardknot Scafell c c remarkable for their steep broken rocky sides and romantic shapes and are in ge∣neral one mass of that kind of stone which produces the beautiful blue slate so much and so deservedly esteemed for covering the roofs of houses They are destitute of coal lime or metallic ores but in some measure repay this defect by affording such valuable slates and produc∣ing that singular mineral substance  blacklead  which is found in Borrowdale and it is said no where else in the southern part of the kingdom  The height ruggedness steepness of the sides in some places ornamented with wood and projecting rocks the varied forms sublime assemblage and picturesque beauty of these mountains and the lakes they environ form scenes that few other places if any in the island can equal and have at different times exercised the pens of many descriptive writersit comes only within our province to remark that this kind of slaty stone appears to be very friendly to vegetation the soil which covers the steep sides of these mountains and found in considerable depth at their bases is in great part decayed slate and the most fertile soils in the vales we suspect have a large portion of this slaty matter in their composition this is the case in the vale of Keswick and particularly at Millbeck and along the western base of Skiddaw  From a map of Cumberland published by Messrs Hodg∣kinson  and Donald laid down from a scale of two miles to an inch we calculate that     Acres  The mountainous districts contain    Improvable common    Old inclosures    Lakes and waters    Total quantity of acres in the whole county    SECT  Minerals  This county abounds with coal lime and leadore it also produces blacklead copper gypsum lapis caliminaris and excellent slate  Coal  as observed in the last section is found in many parts of the eastern mountains and with not many ex∣ceptions all along that tract extending in different degrees of breadth from Sebergham to Whitehaven and along the coast to Maryport forming a district of about square milesCannel coal is got in large quantities in the parishes of Caldbeck and Bolton  Limestone  abounds in most parts of the eastern moun∣tains and in the parishes of Graystock Dacre Penrith Broad field Common c and in the neighbourhood of Egremont and Whitehaven  Gypsum  is got in the parishes of Wetheral and St Cuthbert's Carlisle but has never been applied there as manure  LeadOre  is got in great abundance in Alston Moor and in a lesser degree in the parishes of Caldbeck and MelmerbyIn the lead mines is also found the lapis ca∣liminaris  CopperOre  is found also at Caldbeck Melmerby and  at Hesket but at present not worked with that success which formerly attended them  BlackLead  is found only in Borrowdale a few miles west of Keswick  Blue Slates  of an excellent quality are gotten in Bor∣rowdale and inferior sorts in some of the neighbouring mountains  Freestones  abound in most parts of the county some of which split into good slate but are more heavy less durable and require stronger timber to support them than the blue slate and are also more subject to imbibe moisture  SECT  Waters  Tho' this county enjoys an extent of miles of sea∣coast yet it cannot boast of its navigable rivers the tide flowing not more than two or three miles up the greatest part of them even the Eden by much the largest is perplexed with shoals and its navigation cannot be said to reach beyond Sandsfield though the tide flows a few miles further  There are few places where water is so abundant and good as this district is blessed with for besides the large rivers Eden Derwent Esk cevery village and al∣most every farm enjoys the benefit of a pure spring or is visited by a rivulet The larger rivers abound with Sal∣mon Trout and various other kinds of fish and the smaller brooks with Trouts and Eels It is also orna∣mented with many beautiful and extensive lakes which with their pleasing accompaniments have of late years made the tour of the lakes a fashionable amusement and from whence considerable emoluments have resulted to the neighbouring inhabitants  CHAPTER II  STATE OF PROPERTY  SECT  Estates  THERE are probably few counties where  property in land  is divided into such small parcels as in Cumberland and those small properties so universally occupied by the owners the annual value of these tenements varies from l to l a year but the generality are from l to l some few extend to l or a little more  The rental of the largest estate in the county is said to amount to about l per annum  SECT  Tenures  By far the greatest part of this county is held under lords of manors by that species of vassalage called  custom∣ary tenure  subject to the payment of sines and heriots on alienation death of the lord or death of tenant and the payment of certain annual rents and performance of various services called  Boondays  such as getting and lead∣ing the lord's peats ploughing and harrowing his land reaping his corn haymaking carrying letters c c whenever summoned by the lord  We cannot pretend to be accurate but believe that twothirds of the county are held by this kind of tenure prin∣cipally in those small tenements described in the last chap∣ter The remaining part is mostly freehold which has increased with the inclosure of commons and sometimes whole parishe  or manors have been enfranchised on these occasions Copyhold and leasehold are rarely met with  CHAPTER III  BUILDINGS  SECT  Houses of Proprietors  DESCRIPTIONS of Gentlemen's seats we presume come more under the notice of a topographical survey than an agricultural one we therefore must refer to different tourists and more particularly to Hutchinson's History of Cumberland now publishing  SECT  Farm Houses c  Through the greatest part of this county the  farmhouses  are remarkably well built of stone  Except a small district in the neighbourhood of Abbeyholm and the northeast extremity of the county particularly in the parishes of Bewcastle Stapleton Kirklinton Kirkandrews and Arthuret where they are mostly built of mud or clay and Form a miserable contrast to the buildings in the other part of the county  the blue slate roofs and white dashed walls give them a look of neat∣ness that is peculiarly pleasing and prepossess a stranger with a favourable idea of the cleanliness of the inhabitants an idea which he finds wellfounded on further investi∣gation  These houses have for the most part a kitchen and a parlour in front a toofall backkitchen and milkhouse behind with four or five lodging rooms above the front contains five middle sized sashwindows two below stairs and three above  Where farms are so very small no great extent of farmoffices  are wanted a barn a byer for housing their cattle in winter and a small stable are in general all that is ne∣necessary no regular plan for the form or scite seems to have been adopted every one building according to what he thinks the most convenient for his stock and situation but they are mostly built at each end of the farmhouse Foldyards surrounded by proper offices  with a shed for cattle  are very rare in many parts of the county we be∣lieve they are most prevalent in the parish of Hesket and its vicinity the best and largest we noticed was at Lord Muncaster's  We observed in some parts of the county a singular practice of covering the perpendicular walls of their houses with blue slate to prevent we suppose any kind of mois∣ture from penetrating them  Repairs are generally made at the joint expence of landlord or tenant the former supporting walls doors and timber and the latter thatch slate glass c  SECT  Cottages  Of this description of buildings there are not many purposely erected for labourers in agriculture very few of that class being wanted in this county as the farms are so small the occupiers and their families are generally sufficient for the work without any foreign aid  CHAPTER IV  MODE OF OCCUPATION  SECT  Size of Farms  ON the large estates there are some farms from l to l a year few reach l and we only heard of four or five that got as high as or l a year and one of l but the most general size of farms in this coun∣ty is from l to l a year  Cumberland farmers may be divided into three classes the occupiers of large farms the small proprietors pro∣vincially "  Lairds  or  Statesmen  " and the small farmers  It is to the first class and the gentlemen farmers that this district owes the introduction of any of the modern improvements in agriculture and we were glad to find a spirit of enterprize arising amongst them for the adop∣tion of new modes of culture and improved breeds of stock  To the small Proprietors  agriculture we presume is little indebted for its advancement these "statesmen" seem to inherit with the estates of their ancestors their notions of cultivating them and are almost as much at∣tached to the one as the other they are rarely aspiring and seem content with their situation nor is luxury in any shape an object of their desires their little estates which they cultivate with their own hands produce almost every necessary article of food and cloathing they in part manufacture themselves they have a high character for sincerity and honesty and probably few people enjoy more ease and humble happiness  The small Farmer  is obliged to raise such crops as will pay him best for the present and avoid every expence of which he does not receive the immediate advantage by which means his farm and himself are always kept in a state of poverty many of these small farmers are also mechanics and agricultural labourers that farm from l to or l a year  SECT  Rent  In the vicinity of towns land lets from l to l an acre farm at a distance from towns from to s per acre in general the average may be stated at about s per acre rent is almost universally paid in money  SECT  Tithes  Tithes are mostly taken in kind a few parishes pay a modus in lieu of tithes and others are tithefree in con∣sequence of a portion of common being given to the im∣proprietor  SECT  Poor Rates  At Carlisle s dWigton s dAldston s dHarnington s  Kirkoswald s dAnd in m  ny of the country parishes they vary from d to d per pound  SECT  Leases  The  noblemen  and gentlemen who enjoy the most con∣siderable landed property in this county  let no leases  some have verbal contracts for seven years which are next to none and of those who let leases the term is on∣ly for five seven or nine years besides the usual reser∣vations of mines wood c the tenant convenants to pay  the rent cesses taxes and to keep all in repair some are confined to a certain quantity of tillage and to fallow onefourth yearly others are under no restraint of this kind a few others are consined to lay on a certain quan∣tity of lime and to sow with white clover and hayseeds the lands that are laid to grass these are the principal covenants that affect agriculture To enumerate such as are of a local nature respecting the performance of cus∣stoms services grinding corn payment of chickens c would add little to the improvement of agriculture or enlargement of rural Science  SECT  Expence and Profit  For the mode of investigating this subject we must re∣fer to the Northumberland Report page  CHAPTER V  IMPLEMENTS  THE  Plough  of this county is the swing plough used through all the northern counties in which we observed no improvement  To spend time in describing the harrow roller c that have been used in almost every part of the kingdom for some centuries would be augmenting this Report to little purpose  The Carts  through the whole of this county are drawn by a single horse and probably originated through ne∣cessity from the small farmer keeping no more than one  horse In those times simplicity and cheapness were on∣ly considered we recollect seeing some of those  "tum∣ble carrs"  without one piece of iron about them the wheels were made of three pieces of wood joined by pins of the same material It is probable they had the name of  tumble carrs  from the axle being made fast in the wheels and the whole turning or tumbling round to∣gether but this construction has given way to the wheel with a nave and spokes turning round a fixed axle which is much more managable in quick or short turns  The price of a tumble carr is lthe price of the other kind l ready for yoking  The advantages of single horse carts are so well under∣stood in this county that we did not see any other used  Three single horse carts are driven without any dif∣ficulty by a man or a boy or even women and girls along the coast more than half the carts are driven by females and many of these under twenty years of age with as fine forms and complexions as ever nature be∣stowed on the softer sex We cannot help saying we were disgusted at seeing them put to this employment and especially at their riding in so aukward a manner be∣hind the cartsaddle  Double mouldboard Ploughs  are used by some farmers to form the onebout ridges for turnips and potatoes and also for earthing them up  Winnowing Machines  have been lately introduced and are now become very general twenty years since corn was winnowed without any sort of machine and the farmer was under the necessity of waiting for a na∣tural wind sufficiently strong to blow the chaff from the grain and very often had to take it to some eminence at a distance where the breeze was more certain  Threshing Machines Drills for sowing the various kinds  of grain and horse hoes  have not yet found their way into this district  CHAPTER VI  INCLOSURES  THE mountainous districts are all open and most pro∣bably will long remain so the cultivatable parts are a mixture of old inclosures and commons interspersed through every part of the county  The size of inclosures in general is in proportion to the size of farms the ancient fields are small and irregu∣lar the fences of various constructions walls earth mounds thorns hazle and other brushwood all lend their aid in a greater or less degree and in two or three places we observed large tracts totally inclosed by whinfences  Ulex Europeans  FurzeGorseWhins  which have a very ragged slovenly and un∣couth appearance from the numberless gaps where the whins have been destroyed by frost an accident to which this plant is very liable nothing but the greatest neces∣sity can justify the use of whinfences  The fields of those commons that have been divided within the last thirty years are laid out in straight lines and mostly inclosed by quick fences which in general have done very well  The advantages  that arise from inclosing  in respect to in∣crease of produce or value  must entirely depend upon the modes of management pursued after the inclosing takes place From the abundant crops produced by land which has never grown grain before the occupier vainly  thinks that it will always continue to do so and the de∣ception is still increased by the stimulating effects of lime but alas after having got nine or ten crops the golden prospect vanished the farther they proceed the more they are convinced of their error and growing corn having become a losing trade the land is left to grass but what can it produce already exhausted by repeated corn crops and over dozes of lime it remains a spectacle of the bad effects of such culture and a warning to others to avoid the same course even under this treatment the increased value is in the ratio of three or four to one had these lands been continued in tillage only three years at one time the first year oats second fallow turnips or rape the third wheat or oats or if the soil suited bar∣ley sown up with clover and raygrass and depastured with sheep for three four or five years according to circumstances and situations we will venture to say the land would have gone on improving from rotation to ro∣tation would have been more prositable and put on a very different aspect to what it does at present and have been worth double the rent it now lets for  The advantages  arising from inclosing of commons in respect to the  improvement of stock  is obvious while in a state of common every one turns on what he pleases and there is generally double the quantity of stock that there ought to be The consequence is they make no improvement  they barely exist  the yearly prosits how small Should an enlightened breeder wish to improve his sheep how is he to effect it while his ewes mix pro∣miscuously with his neighbour's slocks If he had the best tup in the kingdom can he be sure that one of his ewes would be tupped by him while there are probably not less than a score of his neighbour's to contest the female with him On the other hand if the common were in∣closed every one would stint with that species of stock  for which his allotment was best adapted and in such numbers as would insure profit when he can confine his ewes within his own inclosure he can make whatever ex∣periment he pleases by putting a few or many ewes to any particular tup without any fear or apprehension of having a spurious breed by the interference of his neigh∣bour's he is also enabled to keep his flock from many dis∣orders few commons but have some tracts of land liable to the rot how are they to be prevented from depastur∣ing upon it or if the scab or other infectious disorders have taken place amongst any flock on the common how is he to avoid it  To the question put by the Board "has inclosing com∣mons decreased population"We answer that we can∣not conceive how inclosing of commons can decrease po∣pulation unless an increase of corn and cattle an increas∣ed demand for labourers and mechanics of various de∣nominations tend to decrease mankind the contrary position must certainly hold good in an eminent degree  The best account we could obtain of commons divided by act of parliament were  Sowerby  about years since  Sedbergham  about years since  Stainton    Culgaith    Carlton    Skelton    Brampton    Irthington  Newby  Farlam    At the last four places the lord of the manor had th for his consent as lord of the soil and making the allotments freehold at most of the others the lord had th  CHAPTER VII  ARABLE LAND  SECT  Tillage  TILLAGELAND is here commonly ploughed by horses a team of oxen we believe is not to be found in the county the horses are yoked double and driven with cords by the ploughman An acre is accounted a good day's work and on light soils an acre and a half  The ridges are very narrow from to feet being the common breadth whether in corn or in grass  Fallows for wheat or turnips  are ploughed once in the Autumn by the best cultivators and four or five times in the course of the succeeding Summer  Barley  is sown on one ploughing after turnips but after a white crop as in rotation first they plough twice and manure with or cartloads of dung some add lime  Oats  are always sown on one ploughing  SECT  Fallowing  Fallowing for wheat and turnips is practised in many parts of this county four or five ploughings and harrow∣ings is the general practice we saw some very clean and well managed gathered up into neat narrow ridges on which the wheat was looking very healthy  SECT  Rotation of Crops  The most prevalent system through a great part of this county is to have a crop of white corn every year  while in ploughing such cultivators make no fallows except ploughing twice and manuring for barley can be deemed such  Where a field is ploughed out from grass they have oatsoatsbarleyoats or oatsbarleyoats oats c c for nine or twelve years and then left to grass for seven or nine years Some few sow hayseeds and a little white clover but the greatest part leave it to nature  On asking a farmer at Uldale why they sowed no clover or grass seeds he replied  "we have no occasion for the land is na∣turally girsproud"  Those that are experienced in cultivation will readily admit that after growing from six to twelve white crops in succession it can scarcely be otherwise than  grassproud  There is certainly grass in abundance but of such kind as no good farmer would wish to be possessed of This barbarous sys∣tem is practised upon many dry loamy soils which after being thus left to grass cover amazingly fast with moss probably owing to the bad cultivation and exhausting crops of corn more than to the wetness of the climate to which it is generally attributed  Where they fallow for wheat the rotation is  Fallow  Wheat  Oats or Barley  Oatsfor or rotations and then left for grass for seven or nine years some few sow clover and hay seeds  In those places where the turnip culture is practised the rotation is  Turnips  Barley  Clover  Ditto  Oats  Ditto  Or  Turnips  Wheat  Barley  Clover  Ditto  Oats  We are glad to find that two or three individuals have adopted the idea of not taking two white crops in suc∣cession and pursue the excellent rotation of turnips barleyclover two yearsthen oats or wheat  SECT  Crops commonly cultivated  Wheat  is a modern production here a general opinion used to prevail that wheat could not be grown in many parts of this county We were informed that it is not much more than years since Summer fallows for wheat were first used and it is not twenty years since Lord Muncaster introduced Summer fallows and the cul∣ture of wheat in the neighbourhood of Ravenglass where it is now grown in great abundance as well as all along the coast to Scotland and in the neighbourhood of Car∣lisle The wheat that is sown after turnips or clover is trifling the main supply is from Summer fallows they generally sow two bushels and a half per acre in Septem∣ber or October as the season suits and they reap from sixteen to thirty bushe's per acre  Barley  and  Oats  being the grains from which the bread of the inhabitants is made were probably the first and only corn grown in this county for many centuries  bigg  or  bear  with four rows of grains on the ear was the kind of barley formerly cultivated but lately the common early sort with two rows has been introduced They sow two and a half bushels per acre in April or May and reap twentyone bushels on an average  The Common Oat  was the only variety grown in this county and is now by far the most prevalent but of late  years a few enterprising individuals have introduced the early varieties of this grain with great advantage they are distinguished from the common oat by the name of  layland oat  and are the Dutch or Friesland oat  Last year Mr Falder near Roes Castle introduced the oat known on the east borders by the name of  Church's Oat  a vari∣ety and perhaps the best variety known of the Poland oat and which will no doubt answer well on all the best rich soils in the county  The quantity sown  is from four to six bushels per acre  The time of sowing  March or April  The Produce  from to bushels per acre but the average of the county was stated to us to be only bushels per acre  Pease  In a climate where so much rain falls and where the harvest is so precarious the culture of pease would be attended with so many chances of loss and so few of gain that we were not surprised to find them so generally neglected The difficulty of harvesting them has probably first suggested the idea of building their stacks in the  cloughs  Where the main stem divides into branches  of trees and afterwards in slender high pyramids round the boles of tall trees to prevent them from blowing over by this method they can also lead and stack them in a damper or moister state and as they do not come near the ground by five or six feet they are seldom troubled with mice The greatest diame∣ter of the stacks is not more than six or seven feet the height of many twelve or fifteen if the tree has not a sufficiency of convenient branches to bear the bottom they nail a stick or two across to form a base When finished they have a very singular appearance  Turnips  were first cultivated in this county to any ef∣fect for the use of cattle by Philip Howard  Esq  of Cor∣by  in the year his first essay was drilled at four feet distance the crop amazingly good the weight on an average lb each turnip some weighed lb he afterwards continued to grow them at two feet and two and a half feet distance with constant success for eight or ten years before any farmer followed the example at last Mr Collins of Wetherall made a trial and suc∣ceeded others soon followed him  It is therefore about thirty years since a few farm∣ers first began to cultivate turnips and considering with what tardiness new modes of practice generally make their way amongst that useful class of society it is no wonder that the growing of turnips should in a great measure be still confined to the vicinity where their cultivation originated and we suppose by the mode of practice that from this source may be traced the various patches of turnips we observed at Netherby Burgh Dalton and a few other places  The land after being made sufficiently fine by repeated ploughings and harrowings is set up in onebout ridges  Provincially  "stitches"  at inches distance the dung is put in the bottom of the hollow intervals and covered with earth by the plough the top of the onebout ridge is flattened by trailing a piece of wood over it and on the  flattened top  the turnip seed is sown by a drill which a man pushes be∣fore him like a wheelbarrow  The drilled turnips are hoed and set out a about eight or nine inches distance in the rows which are ploughed between by a small plough  Hoeing broadcast turnips is not understood if any are sown this way they go unhoed and if too thick are  handweeded Mess Williamson and Monkhouse paid s per acre this year for handweeding their broadcast turnips  The value of this excellent vegetable is not sufficiently understood in this county otherwise it must have made a more rapid progress Probably this may be owing to its being applied to feeding their  own breed of sheep  We saw several acres of turnips this year that were sold for from l to l s per acre which a Northumberland grazier would have thought worth five or six pounds an acre for feeding the  improved  breed of longwoolled sheep  Potatoes  are cultivated in onebout ridges by almost every farmer not only for the use of their own families but for sale where the situation is not too distant from a good market It is only upon the estate of Sir James Graham at Netherby that they are applied to feeding cattle and swine and by Lord Muncaster to feeding cattle who also gives them to his horses Mr Lamb and Mr Blalock favoured us with the following particulars  Mr Blalock feeds cows and says that bushels of potatoes with stones of oatmeal will fatten a cow in three months equally well as turnips of or l value  The small farmers apply potatoes to feeding swine thirty bushels of potatoes and ten of corn made in∣to meal will fatten a swine of eighteen or twenty stones weight equal to corn of l s value The potatoes are  boiled  and meal mixed with them  From these data the value of potatoes may be nearly estimated     £  s  d  The expence of feeding a cow with potatoes and meal is        from which deduct the value of stones of oatmeal        leaves for bushels of potatoes           £  s  d  The expence of feeding a swine with potatoes and meal is        deduct the value of corn bushels fire attend∣ance c        leaves for bushels of potatoes        From the above it appears that potatoes for feeding cows or swine are worth no more than d per bushel They estimate a fair average crop of potatoes to be bushels per acre the value at d per bushel is only l out of which the seed ought to be deducted the other expences attending the cultivation of potatoes and turnips being much upon a par  The land on which these potatoes are grown is a most excellent turnip soil and would produce turnips almost any year worth l per acre for feeding cattle or sheep  Mr Dasks "how can turnips be worth l per acre for feeding cattle and sheep"We reply nothing is more com∣mon they are srequently sold for much more  From the above statement it appears that an acre of po∣tatoes is of less value than an acre of turnips for feeding cattle Mr Lamb has been long convinced of this and says that the practice of applying potatoes to feeding cattle and swine is every year losing ground and the cul∣ture of turnips which was pretty general here twenty years since but gave way to potatoes is now in its turn regaining the situation it so justly deserves  SECT  Crops not commonly cultivated  Beans  we were informed are seldom cultivated with success the failure may probably be owing to their being sown broad cast without manure and not hoed we would recommend to some spirited cultivator to try them in drills at inches intervals so as to admit of be∣ing  horsehoed and ploughed between this mode we can recommend on the successful practice of several years  See Northumberland Report  Cabbages  have been cultivated by Lord Muncaster' Dr Harrison of Penrith and a few others in that vicinity  Carrots  have also been tried by Lord Muncaster who found them a very troublesome and expensive crop owing to the abundance of weeds occasioned by the great rains and moisture of the climate  Flax  is cultivated in small quantities on the northern extremities of the county for family use but much less now than formerly  CHAPTER VIII  GRASS  SECT  Natural Meadows and Pastures  NATURAL meadows are generally found in narrow strips by the sides of rivers "The largest tract of na∣tural meadow in this county is in the parish of Scaleby which lets for s per acre also between the lakes of Keswick and Bassenthwaite there is a considerable extent of natural meadow  Natural pastures are not very numerous in the cul∣tivateable districts of the county unless such may be called natural pasture which is left to nature to cover with herbage after having been exhausted with growing corn If by natural pastures be understood such as have  never been disturbed by the plough there will be found great abundance in this county as not only all the com∣mons in the cultivateable districts but the mountains may come under that denomination  SECT  Artificial Grasses  Artificial Grasses  are here confined to a small number red clover  trifolium pratense  white clover  trifolium repens  common hayfeeds with a little rib grass  plan∣tago lanceolata  and raygrass  lolium perenne  We were informed that in no person in the county had thought of sowing a field down with clover or even hayseeds and that Philip Howard Esq of Cor∣by was the first who sowed a field with clover and taught his countrymen the use of artificial grasses yet it is but a few that have benefited by his laudable exertions  Red Clover  is principally sown where the turnip culture and summerfallowing for wheat are practised and the land continues only two years in grass it is generally mown the first year and depastured the second The great objection to growing this valuable grass is the  hov∣ing  of cattle which may be obviated by depasturing it with sheep or by a little caution in having the cattle pretty full before they are turned into it and to take care to put them to it on a dry day Some object to it because they have taken a fancy that it impoverishes the soil Old Ellis says  "Clover is the mother of corn"  We believe that could the Cumberland farmers be induced to make an experiment they would be of the same opinion and would find their profits so superior to what they are at present that they would become converts to the cause We hope we do not exaggerate when we say that the profits of red clover for two years would be double to that derived from the same quantity of ground sown with  white clover rib grass and hayseeds and that the pro∣fits of the succeeding crop of corn would be nearly in the same ratio  White Clover  has many advocates and is certainly a valuable plant where land is intended to continue in grass for a few years which is generally the case here and by those who sow any kind of grass seeds it is in great repute it is seldom or never sown alone but ac∣companied by what is here called  common hayseeds  which are generally harmless from the heat they mostly get in the stacks and their vegetative powers thereby destroyed where that is not the case we fear more weeds than use∣ful plants would be the produce for when it is consider∣ed that of the useful plants which compose a good mea∣dow scarce two of them flower and ripen at the same period and as the time of mowing is governed more by the weather or other circumstances than the collection of useful seeds it may happen that not one valuable plant may then have its seeds in that state of perfection which is necessary for the reproduction of its species at the same time it is probable that you may obtain the seeds of many plants which you would wish to avoid  Rib Grass  is sown in some places where land is intend∣ed to continue in grass  Raygrass  has here but few advocates a general pre∣judice against this plant seems to have taken place we think  unjustly  for we are convinced from long experi∣ence that under proper management it is a valuable grass it grows in all soils and in all situations early in the Spring and late in Autumn and even thro' Win∣ter on dry soils and in open weather the only reason∣able objection we know of is the great propensity it hath to run to seed but this may be easily obviated by eating it bare with cattle or by mowing the pasture just before  it begins to flower which increases the eatage by the quantity of bottom grass it sends forth after the opera∣tion  It is the properest grass we know to sow along with red or white clover and we would beg leave to recom∣mend it instead of  common hayseeds  so universally sown in this county with clover both red and white  SECT  Hay Harvest  The hay harvest is here in the months of July and August the modes of management various according to the nature of the grass weather and notions of the farm∣er we do not find any thing peculiarly excellent in their practice the only singularity is that the occupiers of small farms in some parts of the county put the whole of their hay into barns the larger farmers stack their's at the door  SECT  Feeding  The most general system of grazing ison the richest grounds  cattle with a few sheep  on the less luxuriant  sheep only  The kinds of cattle usually fatted are the native coun∣try breed and Scotch cattle both Kyloes and the Gal∣loway kind Of these they sind the Kyloes the quickest feeders the Galloway next and their own country breed of long horns the slowest  The prosits of grazing cattle depend much on the skill of the buyer in  selecting  the  quickest feeders  and when fat in selling them for their  full value  also not unfre∣quently on the state of markets  The best grazing lands we saw were at Pap Castle near Cockermouth let at l per acre and the holm lands on both sides the Eden near Carlisle let at l s per acre for the purposes of  grazing only  Mr Tealson of the  former place buys in oxen and heifers in October keeps them all Winter upon the pastures out of which his fat stock has been recently sold and gives them a little hay in bad weather After keeping them near twelve months they leave on an average  a profit of  l  each  their weight from fifty to sixty stone But this interligent gentleman was candid enough to confess that he thought sheep mixed amongst cattle a more profitable system and we were glad to find this mode practised by all the best gra∣ziers in the county  Of Sheepgrazing  there are two branches first feed∣ing wethers and secondly ewes for fat lambs they are both bought in the Autumn are kept on grass the whole time and get no other food except hay in stormy wea∣ther     £  s  d  The profits are a wether sold fat in October        Fleece ½ lb at d                 Deducting prime cost and expence of salving        Average prosit by feeding wethers           £  s  d  Ewes a fat lamb sold in June        Fleece ½ lb at d        Ewe fat sold in November                 Deduct prime cost and salving        Profit by feeding ewe and lamb        There are a few who buy in wethers to feed upon tur∣nips  and sell them in the Spring to Manchester and Liverpool  The kinds of sheep grazed are  the country breed the true blackfaced heath sheep  and  the Cheviot sheep  The most experienced graziers  all agreed  that the true blackfaced heath sheep were  quicker feeders  and a  hardier  race than the Cheviot  We wish to be understood as not stating this as an  ascer∣tained  fact but as an  opinion  of the Cumberland graziers and farmers  CHAPTER IX  GARDENS AND ORCHARDS  GARDENS and Orchards in this county are consider∣ed only as conveniences to private families and not as objects of emolument or commerce as in some other districts  CHAPTER X  WOODS AND PLANTATIONS  THIS county is far from being well wooded The Irthing Eden and Caldew are the only rivers  whose banks produce any quantity of  natural wood  and of these the banks of the Caldew seem to have the larg∣est proportion of old oaktimber Of the value of the oaktimber proper for the purposes of shipbuilding we could obtain no satisfactory information but suspect from what we saw it is of small extent we fear the oak is not suffered to attain a sufficient age for this purpose as we saw a wood near West Ward now felling of upwards of two hundred acres that was little more than thirty years old the whole cut away without leaving any to stand for ship timber  Of late years many plantations have been made near gentlement's seats which shew by their vigorous growth how well adapted the greatest part of this county is for the production of wood From the nakedness of the country along the coast one would naturally conclude that the situation was inimical to that production but Lord Muncaster's extensive and thriving plantations near Ravenglass shew that the nakedness of the land is owing to other causes  If a customary tenant plants wood he cannot cut it without leave of the lord in some cases the lord claims it as his own which sufficiently explains why the occupiers do not plant wood  CHAPTER XI  WASTES  THE  extent of wasle lands  in this county is very great Of mountainous pasture acres which we sup∣pose  not capable of improvement from the plough yet many parts of these districts might be applied to planting with considerable advantage and would probably in this way make a better return than if the soil had been in such a situation as to admit of being converted into tillage We were glad to see a large plantation of larches thriving exceedingly well on the steep edge of the west side of Skiddaw lately planted by Mr Story We hope the ex∣ample will be speedily and extensively followed by every propriertor of similar situations but unfortunately the greatest part of these districts is in a state of common and no improvement of this kind can take place while they continue in that situation of course the first step to improvement is a division and for every proprietor to know his own part If this cannot be done the only means of improvement then left is to convert them from unlimited commons to stinted pastures  The present value per acre of these mountainous dis∣tricts may be nearly estimated from the following data  Mr Greenhow of Thr  keld takes pasturage for his sheep on Skiddaw forest for a year at s per score which is threepence per sheep and supposing an acre keeps a sheep then will threepence an acre be the yearly value of these mountains They can scarce be in a less produc∣tive state an acre of wood if it only grew broomsticks would pay much better  Of the Commons  in the less elevated parts of the county there are many with large tracts of excellent soil capa∣ble of being improved by judicious culture proper drain∣ing and improved breeds of sheep to many times their present value which is certainly very small probably not more than from one to two shillings per acre In a coun∣ty like this that does not raise corn sufficient for the con∣sumption of its inhabitants and where it is always onefourth or onefifth dearer than in an adjoining county it  is lamentable to see such extensive tracts of  good corn land  lying waste of no value to its owners and of no benefit to the community Instead of the present scarcity of grain large quantities might be yearly exported and instead of the ill formed poor starved meagre animals that depas∣ture the commons at present an abundant supply of good fat mutton would be had to  grace  the markets of the county and also to send off large supplies to Newcastle Liverpool Manchester and other populous manufactur∣ing places  It is difficult to say what would be the increased value of such land under proper management we think we cannot be wrong in stating that it would be at least from six to eight times the value to the proprietorsBut of what advantage would it be to the public     Acres  We have already estimated that there are of im∣provable commons in the lower part of the county    Out of this deduct for banksides proper for planting and other unfertile places    There will be left for cultivation    Suppose this be put into a rotation of three years tillage and three years grass then there will be in tillage yearly    Suppose onethird for fallow and of this one half to be turnips the other half naked fallow for wheat then will there be yearly     Acres  bush per ac  bush per an

than s each the amount will be    Total value of increased produce  £  CHAPTER XII  IMPROVEMENTS  SECT  Draining  DRAINING is one of those improvements which has been introduced of late years into the northern counties and where it is done with judgment is in many situa∣tions of the greatest consequenceCumberland has not been behind its neigbours in adopting this beneficial mea∣sure we were glad to observe in many places great ad∣vantages gained both by hollow and surface drains some done with great art by one or more hollow drains run∣ning in the direction of the outburst of water and cut deep enough to get through the bed of sand or gravel in which the water runs and by that means arrest the source which drowns the land below it but the like intelligence has not in all places prevailed for we often saw the drains running in parallel directions  perpendicular to the source  and at such distances as the drainer thought the nature of the soil required this is more particularly the case where surface drains are used The hollow drains are  filled with stones when they can be got otherwise with sods  SECT  Paring and Burning  This operation is seldom performed in this county ex∣cept on heathy or coarse grounds the expence about s per acre  SECT  Manuring  Farmyard dung  is here as in most other places the chief resource of the farmer where turnips are grown it is wholly applied to their culture where they are not grown it is used for the various purposes of dressing grass land and for the barley and wheat crops  Lime  is found in great abundance in many parts of this county and of an excellent quality The quantity laid upon an acre varies from sixty to an hundred and fifty bushels we found it a general opinion that lime did lit∣tle good to land that had been long accustomed to it and that those who had used the large quantity of bushels per acre found their lands greatly exhausted and were now fully convinced of their error in continuing it so long especially in such large quantities We have had many opportunities of observing the abuse of lime which most probably is one of the best manures known for particular soils and situations and under peculiar circum∣stances and proper restrictions yet like many other good things a superabundance may be prejudical or rather we are sensible that too often repeated and in large quantities it becomes hurtful  Lime is mostly laid on while the land is in a state of fallow but in some places we found it laid upon the grass land  one  or  two  years before they intended to plough it out We doubt the propriety of the latter mode  Tangle or SeaWeed  is used along the coast wherever it can be got the quantity per acre is fifty or sixty cartloads This is known to be a valuable manure either for corn turnips or grass wherever it can be had  Slake or Mud  left by the tide is used in the neighbour∣hood of Ravenglass with good effect on the grass lands fifty or sixty cartloads per acre  Muscles  are also used in the neighbourhood of Raven∣glass for manure after the rate of five or six cartloads per acre they are got on the sands adjoining the coast  Sea Sand  An accidental experiment of Lord Muncas∣ter's shewed its utility in destroying moss but it is not used as a manure  Compost  It seems a general practice through every part of the county to make a compost of lime and earth in the proportion of one cartload of lime to four or five of earth they use it as a topdressing to their grass lands and find it very beneficial  SECT  Weeding  All kinds of grain are sown broadcast the only weeding it gets is by hand hoeing a crop of corn we be∣lieve was never once practised in the county Turnips and potatoes are the only crops in which weeds are de∣stroyed by hoeing  SECT  Watering  The only attempts we saw of this species of improve∣ment that had the least resemblance to a watered meadow laid out by art was at Bleatarn about six miles east of Carlisle belonging to Mr Richardson of Rickerby to whom his country is highly indebted for the spirited ex∣ample he has set in many other improvements We were  sorry to find there was little more water than what was collected by rains the ridges narrow and long the trenches small and inadequate to carry a sufficient quan∣tity of water for the purpose intended It is unfortu∣nate that the first attempt should have been made in such a situation and under such circumstances in a county so pregnant with favourable situations and the water of such an excellent quality uncontaminated with mineral particles or infusions that are suspected to be inimical to vegetation  SECT  Improving Heath Lands  The best mode of improving peat earth being a desi∣deratum of great consequence the more facts that can be collected upon this head the more light will be thrown on the subject and the more likely we shall be to obtain the object sought for  At Bleatarn Mr Richardson has made great improve∣ment on a poor black moory soil growing very short heath in its original state not worth sixpence per acre He ploughs in Autumn and lets it lie till the Autumn following then ploughs across and the next Summer makes a complete fallow which he limes after the rate of one hundred and fifty bushels per acre and in April or May following sows it with grassseeds without corn in the following proportion per acre white clover lb red lb ribgrass lb raygrass ½ bushels and common hayseeds bushels  Another mode is to plough up in the Winter and leave it in that state thro' the Summer to rot until next Spring when it is ploughed across and made sufficiently fine by repeated harrowings ploughings and burning of the sods to sow with turnips in June to the above quantity of lime is added singlehorse cart loads of dung On a part of the fallow this year we saw some drilled turnips  worth l an acre in addition to the lime they had fifty singlehorse cartloads of dung per acre but as dung is rarely to be procured for improvements of this kind we think that a crop of rape might be got for Spring seed without dung which would certainly be better than a naked fallow as in the first mode The lands that have been laid down two years were full of grass  From many observations made on similar improvements we have always found the first and second years grass by far the most valuable after this they decline in value and in a few years re∣turn to their original heath if not prevented by ploughing  and excellent pasture for sheep but to make them thus pro∣ductive they are loaded with the following expences which according to Mr Richardson's estimate including the various ploughings harrowings lime dung grassseeds interest of money c amount to l s d per acre from which taking the value of the turnips l leaves l s d the expence per acre on the grass  Near Naward Castle Mr Ramshay has made great ex∣ertions in reclaiming peatmoss  by throwing it up with a spade  into round ridges seven yards wide the top being from twelve to eighteen inches higher than the furrow which is cut deep enough to act as an open drain In this state it lies all Winter In the Spring following he covers it nearly an inch thick with a compost formed of five loads of earth to one of lime and upon this dress∣ing sows  Common hayseeds  bushels per acre  Raygrass  ditto  Ribgrass  or lb ditto  Where the land is dry enough they plough and to the above quantity of grassseeds add a few pounds of white clover  Mr Ramshay uses few hollow drains Those that re∣quire to be three or four feet deep he slopes off at the  into which the furrow drains empty We saw some lands that had been done two years the raygrass and ribgrass growing well the woolly holcus  holcus lanatus  in abundance it comes naturally on all such soils but is a grass that few kinds of stock will eat un∣less compelled by hunger  Mr Ramshay informed us the expences of making these improvements amounted to l an acre of course both this and Mr Richardson's to pay common interest for the money expended ought to let at s an acre for a term of years  CHAPTER XIII  LIVE STOCK  SECT  Cattle  THE  Cattle  are a small breed of long horns with a few exceptions of the Galloway breed intermixed particularly along the coast from Whitehaven to Carlifle  This breed of longhorns  is not distinguished by any pe∣culiar good qualities which is not to be wondered at when it is considered that probably at this time there is not one person in the county that pays any attention to its improvement Twenty years ago Mr Hazle of Dale∣main had made some progress in this business and gain∣ed a very useful breed of longhorned cattle but his suc∣cessors neglected them and the labours of the good old man are totally lost  The longhorned and the Galloway polled cattle are probably the best adapted to this county of any other but the kind of longhorns that occupy it at present may certainly be much improved by paying proper attention to breed always from the best males and females that can be selected This end would be the readiest attained by getting good bulls and heifers from the midland counties where the longhorned breed are brought to great per∣fection  The Dairies  are small and mostly employed in making butter of an  excellent quality  Those that are situated in the vicinity of towns sell it weekly by the pound to supply the consumption of the inhabitants In other situations it is put into firkins of lb each and sent to distant markets  The average quantity of butter from one cow is generally estimated from one to two firkins some cows will give twelve quarts of milk at a meal and make seven pounds of butter per week but the most general average is seven or eight quarts of milk at a meal and from to pounds of butter per week through the Summer  Skimmed milk  cheese  is the principal kind made here and chiefly consumed at home  On those farms that have a right of common the grass lands are employed through the Summer in growing hay depasturing their cows and sometimes young cattle but the latter are more generally summered on the commons and in Autumn brought into the old inclosures till the approach of Winter when all the cattle are housed  SECT  Sheep  The sheep  bred in this county are only of  two kinds  A HERDWICK RAM  and these two are probably something related one of them is peculiar to that high exposed rocky mountain∣ous district at the head of the Duddon and Esk rivers more particularly known by the names of Hardknot Sealefell Wrynose c  Of this breed of sheep commonly called  Herdwicks  the ewes and wethers are all polled or hornless and also many of the tups their faces and legs speckled but a great portion of white with a few black spots on those parts are accounted marks of the purest breed as are also the hornless tups they have sine small clean legs We were told that the lambs when dropt are well covered the wool is short and form as thick matted fleece much finer than that of the blackfaced heath sheep with which variety they seem to have been crossed as we sus∣pect from some of the rams having spiral horns and from some  kemps  or  hairs  being intermixed amongst some fleeces of the wool they are a lively little animal well adapted to seek their food amongst these rocky mountains in many places stony and bare and where covered the soil is thin but the herbage mostly green though heath is found on their summits They have no hay in Win∣ter and support themselves in the deepest snows by scratching down to the heath or other herbage indeed it seldom happens but that some parts of the mountains are blown bare which the sheep find out They do not face the coming storm as reported but like other sheep turn their backs on it and in such weather they gener∣ally gather together and keep stirring about by which means they tread down the snow keep above it and are rarely overblown  The loss per cent per ann is of  hogs  Provincial term for sheep from six months old till being first shorn  from to Ditto ditto of old sheep to  The ewes are kept as long as they will breed lambs and are often from ten to fifteen years of age before they are sold the wethers go off at four and a half years old Both ewes and wethers are sold from these mountains and killed without being put on any better pasture we saw a carcase of one of the wethers at Ravenglass very good mutton which weighed lb a quarter and had or lb of tallow The ewes weigh from to lb a quar∣ter the fleece weighs lb and soid last year at d per lb which we think much below its value  The mountains on which these sheep are bred happen not to be common but belong to Lord Muncaster as do also the stock that depasture them which have time im∣memorial been farmed out to  herds  at a yearly sum From this circumstance these farms three or four in number have obtained the name of  Herdwicks  that is the district of the  herds  and the sheep the appellation of  Herdwick sheep  They have obtained such a character for  hardiness  of  constitution  that Mr Tyson  We were told by Lord Muncaster's agent that the family of Tysons have lived in this sequestered spot above four hundred years  who farms the principal flock sells a number of tups every year into va∣rious parts of the county to  improve the hardiness of other slocks  the price is often as high as two guineas and a half  The sheep through the whole of this county except the  Herdwicks  have been descended from the  blackfaced coarsewoolled heath sheep  but by crossing with some o∣ther kind probably the  Herdwicks  many of them have acquired a large portion of  white  on their  faces  and  legs  some have those parts speckled and others totally black they are in general horned high shouldered narrow back∣ed flat sided strong boned and many with thick rough hairy legs The  wool  is coarse and long but falls short in  both these respects to what is produced by the blackfaced sheep from Mossat and Linton in Scotland and the Kent∣more sheep in Westmoreland the fleece weighs from to lb which sold in for ½d per pound  The management of sheep  over all this county is very similar through the Summer the whole flock is depas∣tured on the commons and range at large without any person to look after them in November the whole are gathered together and salved  The salve is composed of butter and tar in the proportion of sixteen pounds of the former to four quarts of the latter This quantity will salve forty sheep  the old sheep are turned again upon the common but the hogs are kept in the old inclosures some part of which has been kept uneat∣en to support them through the Winter on the approach of snow the old sheep are brought to the inclosures or to some part of the common adjoining and are daily fod∣dered with hay while the storm continues Those who have not a sussiciency of inclosed ground for wintering their hogs take wintering for them in those parts of the low country where they do not breed sheep the price s per head to have hay in bad weather  In Eskdale and Mitredale they formerly kept their hogs in the house all Winter on hay and drove them to water once a day but this practice is now laid aside and they winter them upon the inclosed grounds which are previously kept fresh for that purpose They give no hay to their sheep here which are a good deal of the  Herd∣wick blood  The sheep are sold in Autumn to graziers The price of those from the eastern part of the county are  Wethers at ½ years old  s to s  Ewes from to ditto  s to s  From the southwest     Eskdale wethers at ½ years old  s to s  Ewes from to ditto  s to s  Skiddaw wethers at ½ ditto  s to s  Ewes from to ditto  s to s  We have no hesitation in saying that the breeds may be improved for there are few places where they have been more neglected At Penruddock we observed some singularly rough legged illformed sheep on asking an old farmer from whence they had that breed or where they got their tups He innocently replied  Lord Sir they are sik as God set upon the land we never change any  The latter pare of this simple statement we readily believe but that God  set upon the land  such illformed unprosita∣ble animals we cannot so readily assent to and rather think they have acquired their present illform and bad properties by the indolence and ignorance of the owners We wish we could avoid adding that the same practice which guides the men of Penruddock is too prevalent in every part of the county  We found in general that the sheep breeders here like those in most other countries are very much attach∣ed to their own breed As they have never tried any o∣ther they cannot be admitted as proper judges of the comparative merit of different kinds of sheep but sup∣posing for the present their own breed to be well adapt∣ed to their situation why not improve them by selecting the best males and females and rear a better offspring of their own kind or by hiring or buying some of Mr Tyson's BEST FORMED and FINEST WOOLLED Herdwick tups instead of getting tups from Kentmore in Westmoreland which appeared from what we saw to have nothing to recommend them in our opinion but  size and c  rseness  The shape of these sheep is in every res∣pect the reverse of what it ought to be the back nar∣row  the carcase long and thin supported upon large rough legs with coarse hairy wool hanging down from their throats all the way to their breast which on a wet day gives them as much the appearance of goats as sheep  Within the last three years a few longwoolled sheep have been introduced into this county from the York∣shire Wolds by Lord Muncaster from Northumberland by Mr Blacklock of Corby Mr Richardson of Rickaby Mr Porter Carlisle Mr Falder near Roes Castle Mr Lamb Netherby and probably a few othersand since our visiting this county in to the above names we are happy to add those of Mr Graham of Barrock Lodge Mr Losh of Woodside Mr Stalker of Lambsknow c who have not only hired tups at considerable prices but even purchased ewes at as high prices as from l to l each  SECT  Horses  The Horses  are middle sized from fourteen to fifteen and a half hands high of various colours but bays and chesnuts seem the most prevalent for a small farm where horses must answer for both draught and riding they are probably most suitable but certainly might be improved by stallions from the NorthRiding of Yorkshire the best breed of horses we know for the double purpose abovementioned  About or years since teams of oxen or oxen yoked with horses were very common from that pe∣riod draught oxen gradually decreased and for some years past we were informed there has not been an ox team in the county  Almost every small farmer breeds his own horses and generally more than are necessary for the cultivation of his farm these are often purchased by dealers for the pur∣pose of supplying the light horse regiments  SECT  Swine  Swine are bred and fed here in considerable numbers every farmer fattens one or more of these animals and most labourers and mechanics rear and feed each a pig at about months old they are confined in the sty for the purpose of fatting on barley or oatmeal and potatoes their weight is from to stone  SECT  Rabbits  Some narrow tracts of light sandy ground along the coast from Harrington to Abbeyholm are occupied by rabbits There are also warrens in the parishes of Wyber∣thwaite Drig and Heskit  SECT  Poultry  The minute division of landed property occasions a∣bundance of poultry the numerous waters lakes and commons facilitate the keeping of large flocks of geese which are fed on the stubbles and supply the market plentifully from the latter end of October to Christmas  SECT  Pigeons  Are rarely found with the farmers they are principally kept and bred by gentlemen of property as articles of luxury  SECT  Bees  Are found thro' every part of the county and in some situations are very profitable It is a prevailing opinion that they thrive best in the vicinity of Heath  erica vulga∣ris  Hence it would appear that this plant abounds with their favourite food but as it is late of flowering they should also be in the neighbourhood of a sheltered  early situation to enjoy the benefit of the Spring flowers where these cannot be united it would probably be right to remove them from one to the other to suit the sea∣sons  CHAPTER XIV  RURAL ECONOMY  SECT  Labour  FROM the number of small farms there is an uncer∣tainty of a day labourer meeting with constant employ∣ment as the occupiers want assistance only on particular occasions  On this principle we account for the high wages given in this county through the whole of which there is an universal custom of giving the labourers  victuals  both men and women the wages are  For men per day d and victuals in harvest s and victualsFor women haymaking d and victualsharvest d and victualsThe hours from to  The victuals are estimated at d per day for men and d for women Servants kept in the house are only hired for half a year to prevent gaining settlementsTheir wages for that time are a man from l to lWomen l to lMasons without victuals are from s d to s per day Carpenters s d  When work is done by the piece

through all the markets of the county is not overloaded with fat what we saw at Carlisle and Whitehaven was lean indeedAt the latter place we did not see one carcase of decent muttonthe greatest part of it would not have be  n suffered to appear in Newcastle and many other markets that are accustom∣ed to see good mutton a joint of lean Whitehaven mut∣ton is deater at d pr lb than the same joint of a good sat sheep is at d on account of the greater proportion of hone to eatable meat in the former to what it is in the latter  The bread  geneally used in this county is made of bar∣ley or a mixture of bar∣ley and rye oatmeal is made into  hastypuddings and eat with butter treacle milk or beer for breakfast and often for supper  Potatoes  for several years have been in general use as a principal article of food few families dine without them and we believe many a dinner and supper are made of potatoes with a little butter or cream for sauce and in many cases only milk or where this cannot be had a little salt  SECT  Fuel  Coals are cheap and plentiful in most parts of the coun∣ty in several places from s to s will procure a year's fuel for a small family  Peat and turf also abound and are used instead of coals in some districts  CHAPTER XV  POLITICAL ECONOMY  SECT  Roads  THE  roads  are in general very good both parochial and turnpikes except the road from Carlisle to Newcastle some parts of which are very bad and very different to what the same road is immediately on entering Nor∣thumberland  The materials are excellent in general limestone but in almost every instance not broken small enough by one half If these hard stones were broken so small  as to pass through a ring two inches in diameter and the roads made wider and flat or very nearly so few coun∣ties in the kingdom would be able to vie with Cumber∣land for excellent roads  SECT  Canals  There are no canals in this county in one was projected from Maryport by Carlisle to Newcastle but did not take place owing to a difference of opinion whether the canal from Newcastle should pass on the North or South side of Tyne  SECT  Fairs  FEBRUARY  th  Wigton  for horses  APRIL  th  Wigton  for cattle  th

butchers' meat butter c and a few oats and barley  Egremont  for corn and other pro∣visions  SECT  Commerce  The Commerce  of this county consists principally in the exportation of coals from Whitehaven Workington and Maryport to Ireland c The number of vessels employed in this trade amounts to upwards of from to tons burden This lucrative trade has arisen to its present importance within the last hundred years it originated at Whitehaven from the exertions of Lord Lonsdale's ancestors to whom the coal in that neigh∣bourhood principally belongs  Mr Curwen is the principal coalowner at Workington and Mr Senhouse at Maryport At all those places coal cannot be wrought fast enough to supply the demand vessels have frequently to wait six or eight weeks before  they can get a loading a certain sign of an increasing trade  "We have not been able to ascertain at what period navigation was advanced in Cumberland A survey was taken by commission from the crown in the year of the trade and shipping of this county  inter alia  Whitehaven was then so far from promising it would ever arrive at its present wealthy and flourishing state that it consisted only of  six cottages  scattered on the beach and hidden in the creek from the eye of an enemy and to this dejected port one small bark only belonged of nine or ten tons burthen Nay it is not more incredible than true that there was at that time only one vessel ap∣pertaining to the whole county that was of ten tons bur∣then The whole exports of this extensive county were nothing but a small quantity of  herrings and cod fish  and the inhabitants knew so little of the luxuries and enjoy∣ments of life that the whole of this great coast receiv∣ed no other  imports  than a little salt  About the year the Earl of Lincoln being Lord High Admiral caused an account to be taken of the ships and mariners within this county when all the vessels a∣mounted only to twelve and not one carried eighty tons The number of mariners and fishermen were of whom many had never navigated a vessel superior to an open boat  In  Workington  was the chief haven and the place from whence certain criminals sentenced to banish∣ment were exported to Ireland  Hutchinson's History of Cumberland  "  Maryport  in the year consisted of only one farmhouse in that year another house was built It is now a neat well built middlesized markettown with a small and good harbour inclosed by two piers and in  contained inhabitants which increase about yearly The ground upon which the town is built belonged to Humphry Senhouse Esq To encourage set∣tlers he sold off house and yard steads reserving a ground rent The land around it lets for or l an acre which would not have been worth more than l had things re∣mained as they were in  The quantity of coals exported from these ports taken on an average of years from to is as fol∣lows     Chaldrons  From Whitehaven    Workington Harring∣ton and Maryport         The receipt of customs at Whitehaven from th June to th January weeks was l s d  The duty on coals exported from these ports is s d per chaldron to Ireland and s to foreign ports  Butter bacon and hams of an excellent quality form a part of the commerce of this county The article of butter is said to amount to l per ann the whole chiefly for the London market to which place also con∣siderable quantities of fresh salmon are sent from Carlisle  SECT  Manufactures  The Manufactures  are not extensive printing cottons at Carlisle and a check manufacture on a small scale in most of the market towns with four or five cotton mills erected of late years near Carlisle Dalston and Corby with a small factory of corduroys at the latter place is all this county has to boast of  Whether the coal trade and manufactures have occa∣sioned any improvements in the agriculture of the county is doubtful but they certainly have encouraged it by making a very increased demand for its produce  The lead mines on Aldstonmoor affect the agriculture of this county very little being more intimately connected with Northumberland  SECT  Poor  In most of the country parishes the poorrates are low from d to d per pound which we believe is partly owing to a sort of pride existing amongst the lower classes of not applying for parochial relief till they can∣not possibly subsist without it and also to the number of  Friendly Societies  which have been established and we hope are still increasing Such useful institutions are de∣serving of encouragement by every person whose proper∣ty is chargeable with poorrate  SECT  Population  In Messrs Nicholson and Burn's History of Cumber∣land published in the number of houses are esti∣mated at and the inhabitants at by Houseman's notes in Hutchinson's History of Cumber∣land now publishing they amount to  CHAPTER XVI  OBSTACLES TO HAPROVEMENT  ONE great obstacle to improvement seems to arise from a laudable anxiety in the customary tenants to have their little patrimony descend to their children These small properties loaded with fines heriots and boon∣days  See Tenures page  joined to the necessary expence of bringing up and educating a numerous family can only be handed down from father to son by the utmost thrift hard labour and penurious living and every little saving being hoarded up for the payment of the  eventful sine  leaves nothing for the expences of travelling to see improved modes of culture and to gain a knowledge of the management and profits of different breeds of stock and be convinced by ocular proofs that their own situations are capable of producing similar advantages And even should they be half inclin∣ed to adopt a new practice prudence whispers that should the experiment fail it would require the savings of many years to make good the deficiency  The  customary tenure  is allowed on all hands to be a great grievance and check to improvement Would not this be best done away on the division of commons as was the case at Brampton c where Lord Carlisle had th for his consent as lord of the soil and for enfranchising the allotments There are other lords who ask th  for their consent and enfranchising  The portion given to the lords of manors for their consent as lord of the soil in most parts of the kingdom is onesixteenth The part to be allowed for enfranchising will depend on the na∣ture of the tenure  The yearly value of the various customs fines c might be easisy settled by commissioners and twentyfive years purchase on  this value  be the price of enfranchisement which might be allowed out of the allotment upon the division of a common or paid in money at the option of the tenant  On these terms neither party would have reason to complain but where a tenant cannot enfranchise under forty years purchase it would be a humane act of the legi∣slature to relieve these bondagers by law or laudable in the Board of Agriculture to induce such lords of manors to accept a fair equivalent for these dregs of vassalage  Letting no Leases  or leases for five or seven years is another great obstacle to improvement To such propri∣etors of land we would beg leave to hint that no tenant will ever make improvements under the uncertainties of a  short lease  much less where there is  none  A tenant may be well convinced that by proper culture draining im∣proved breeds of stock c he could make his farm in a few years worth  one third  more than it is at present but this cannot be done without laying out money suppose l and suppose by this means the increased yearly value of his crop is l Now it is clear it will be six years before he can be repaid the principal and interest of the sum expended Should his lease expire in the fifth year he would be a loser and should he have no lease he might be turned off his farm at the end of the second year Under such circumstances the chance of loss is much greater than the prospect of gain By rea∣soning in this manner he concludes that it is safer to have his l at interest at per cent than risk it in  improving his farm under such uncertainties and that it will be the surest game to take  every advantage  of the farm in his power  On the other hand if his lease had been for twenty∣one years he would have foreseen that by laying out his l he would gain l and as "the hope of re∣ward sweetens labour" he would have doubled his exer∣tions and gone on from improvement to improvement and at the expiration of his term his landlord would have the satisfaction of seeing his tenant had acquired a com∣petency his farm increased in value and the community benefited by the increased produce We have heard it is true some arguments urged in favour of letting  no leases  such as would have been used by a feudal lord and which we are persuaded cannot long be held by liberal and benevolent minds enlightened by science or anxious to promote the true interests of their country  The payment of Tithes in kind  is universally agreed to be a material obstacle to the advancement of agriculture according to the present mode of collecting tithes it is not a tenth of the  natural produce  of the land but a tenth of the  capital employed in trade  If a man employs l in trade he receives his profits without any deduction but if he should lay out this l on a speculation of im∣proving a piece of land say draining a bog he finds if his scheme succeeds that the produce is not all his own the tithe owner comes and takes away  one tenth  which is probably  all the profit  after deducting common interest for the money expended and this from off land that never afforded any tithe since the creation nor  ever would have done  had not this spirited improver laid out his l on improving this bog rather than employing it in trade where he could have received at least per cent for his money The bog would then have continu∣ed unprofitable and the tithe owner would have received  no injury  for neither he nor any of his predecessors had ever reaped any advantage from itThis obstacle certainly might be removed by giving a fair equivalent for tithes  CHAPTER XVII  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS  SECT  Agricultural Societies  THERE are none in this county nor we believe has any attempt ever been made to form any  SECT  Weights and Measures  The same confusion in weights and measures prevails here as in many other parts of the kingdom  A Carlisle bushel is quarts  A Winchester bushel is quarts  A Penrith bushel is ditto for wheat and rye  A Penrith bushel is ditto for barley oats and potatoes  A stone of tallow wool yarn or hay is lb  Ditto of butcher's meat lb but in many places lb  The pound is ounces by which butter and various other articles are weighed  CONCLUSION  MEANS OF IMPROVEMENT  THE first that presents itself is a reform in the culture of the arable lands To those who have been accustomed to take two three four five c white crops in succes∣sion we would recommend to continue their lands in til∣lage  no more  than  three years at one time  and in the se∣cond year to fallow for turnips or wheat according as the soil suits after turnips barley or wheat and on the barley or wheat sow red clover white clover and raygrass  To these may be added hopmedic and ribgrass accord∣ing to circumstances  and continue in grass two three or more years according to situation and circumstances Where necessity urges the clover may be mown for hay the first year but would recommend to depasture it as much as possible with sheep which of all other stock are the most profitable and the most improving for land that has been exhausted by tillage  It would probably be right in most situations to have onethird or onefourth of the farm in old grass for the purposes of the dairy and the sheep stock in Winter and we would observe that where land is worth s per acre in grass it would be a dangerous experiment to plough it up in such a climate as Cumberland possesses  We know that in some parts of the kingdom lands are let at higher rents for the  purposes of tillage only  but then their soil climate and situation are peculiarly good and it is a question whether if these lands had been in old grass they would not have been worth more for grazing than they are at present for growing corn  probably as good as the land at Pap Castle let at l an acre for grazing only  The live Stock  next offers itself for consideration Of the properest breed of horses and horned cattle we have before given our sentiments it only remains to suggest what improvements may be made in the sheep of which there ought to be at least two if not three distinct breeds that is  For the lower districts a breed of  improved  longwool∣led sheep  For the mountainous a breed of mountain sheep ad∣apted to the  herbage  and  situation  For the high heathy ridge of mountains on the east side of the county the  true blackfaced heath sheep  are pro∣bably the best adapted as we think them the hardiest and best calculated for living  altogether upon heath  of any other breed we know of course a little attention to the im∣provement of the present breed by good tups of the  true heath sheep  is all that is here wantedBut for those mountains on the southwest part of the county which have so large a portion of sound green sward we think a finewoolled sheep might be kept to advantage probably the South Down or at least a cross betwixt the  South Down  and the  Herdwick sheep  from the known inclina∣tion these breeds have to make fat the carcase would cer∣tainly be as good and the fleece would as certainly be of  double value  as that of the present breed     £  s  d  The fleece of the South Down sheep is ½ lb at s per lb        Ditto of the Skiddaw sheep ½ lb at d ditto        Increased value of the fleece        But it is probable the wool may be deteriorated by cross∣ing with the Herdwick sheep If on this account we al∣low  low is d there will still be an increased value of s a fleece  For the lower districts a breed of  improved  longwool∣led sheep of or lb a quarter would undoubtedly be far more profitable than those that are now bred and depastured upon it and from the great portion of excel∣lent turnip soil distributed through every part of the county almost every breeder would be enabled to fatten his own if he pursued the rotation above recommended and he would find that his wethers at ¼ or ½ year old would be much fatter than the present breed are at or ½ years old and that they would be sold for the follow∣ing prices     £  s  d  A wether at ½ year old        Wool fleece lb at d per lb                 Deduct for wintering on turnips weeks at d per week        Produce of a longwoolled wether at ½ year old after deducting the expence of wintering on turnips        At Aspatria they feed their own sheep and sell their wethers at ½ years old to the butchers for        Wool fleeces at s d each                 Deduct for salving years        Produce of a country bred wether ½ years old        From hence it appears that the present breed of sheep are kept three years for nothing or that the improved breed of longwoolled sheep will leave as much profit in one year as the present do in four or a flock of of these longwoolled sheep would leave as much profit as of the present race and that for grass only as the expence of wintering on turnips was deducted in the a∣bove statement  Inclosing of Commons  we have already pointed out would be a great source of improvement in this county could it be done at a moderate expence and on equitable terms the charges of obtaining an act of parliament and the various additions made thereto by the practitioners of the law are in some cases three or four times more than all the other expences put together Surely this might be avoided by a general act The House of Commons has already laid a foundation by the standing orders re∣specting such billsIf twothirds of the proprietors re∣quest a division we see no reason why they should be put to the expence of obtaining an act of parliament because two or three or possibly only one ignorant or illnatured person or persons are absurd enough to oppose it  Watered Meadows  is another source of improvement from whence great advantages may be derived the streams are not confined to any particular district they are found equally pure whether they have their source from the limestone rocks on the eastern and middle parts of the county or from the immense mountains of blue slate rock in the southwest district Numberless are the rivulets that might be employed with the greatest advan∣tage in watering and in most places would be turned over the land at the least expence being obliged at present to be kept within their bounds by proper fences and seem to solicit their indolent owners to employ them for their own emolument and the benefit of the public  There are also many fine opportunities for employing the larger rivers some hundred acres of the flat tract of land below Keswick to the top of Bassenthwaitelake might be irrigated and prevented from being overflowed by embanking a large portion near the foot of the lake is capable of the same improvement In Eskdale Lord Muncaster has a fine opportunity of watering an exten∣sive tract  We are glad to find that his Lordship has taken the hint and brought an experienced person from near Cirencester in Gloucestershire with a view of introducing this species of im∣provement into this county he purposes irrigating about acres in different situations and upon different soils and with water of different qualities  Near Carlton on the Pettril on the Ellen and at many other places we observed where irrigation might be applied to great advantage  We made an excursion to the Bishop of Llandaff's at Colgarth Park where that respectable prelate has a most admirable situation for wateringHe purposes to have a man from those parts where the practice is best under∣stood a plan we highly approve and from his known scientific acquirements enlarged ideas activity and per∣severance in every good pursuit we have no hesitation in saying that future improvers will revere his memory and admire the man for adding to the character of a  good bishop  that of a  good farmer  and for blessing these northern re∣gions by the introduction of a practice from which so many and such great benefits are to resultTo this place we hope the Cumbrians will resort to be taught the most improved modes of irrigation and by introducing the practice into their own country will reap the rewards which it is so highly capable of affording from this source of improvement  Draining  has been practised with great advantage by a few enterprizing individuals but much remains yet to be done in almost every part of the county  to those who are unacquainted with the benefits of drain∣ing we beg leave to recommend it to their particular no∣tice as the first of improvements  By Embanking  great advantages might be gained especially on the marshes of Burgh Rowcliff AbbeyHolm and at the mouth of the Duddon To point out the mode by which this could be best accomplished would require a more particular survey it is sufficient on this occasion to hint that it may be done and that consider∣able benefits would acrue from it not only to many in∣dividuals but to the public at large  The southwest part of Cumberland is in a manner insulated and cut off from all easy safe and ready communication with the southern and western parts of the kingdom on the one hand by the barrier of mountains which stretch from Kendal and Ulverstone to Penrith and Keswick and on the other by the slow of the tides over the Lancaster Cartmel and Duddon sands by which the passage is not only interrupted for several hours twice a day but also rendered very unsafe and dangerous all which might be avoided by proper embankments and at the same time a great quantity of land gained from the ravages of the sea  To the Notice of other Districts  We would beg leave to recommend the use of  single∣horse carts  having been long convinced of their utility we are glad to have an opportunity of stating to the pub∣lic a few facts which will fully evince their superior ad∣vantages  The horses of Cumberland are not of a large size one fifteen hands high of a light form that will answer either for riding or drawing seldom draws less in a singlehorse cart than    cwt  The common load for a  draught horse  of the a∣bove size is    The carriers from Brampton to Newcastle over a hilly country carry frequently    We met a carrier's boy driving five carts from  Longtown to Newcastle in which were four ton or on each cart    cwt  A singlehorse cart carries ten pigs of lead of twelve stone each which is    From the above it may be fairly concluded that the common load for a singlehorse cart will be about  cwt  In most countries a twohorse cart seldom car∣ries more than    cwt  Nor a threehorse cart more tha    Here a boy or a girl drives two singlehorse carts which carry    Of course  two horses  yoked in  singlehorse carts  will draw as much as  three horses  yoked in  one cart  A common carrier at Carlisle who many years employ∣ed a waggon has laid it aside and now uses  singlehorse carts only  as he finds he can by that means carry much greater weights  There are few articles which may not be carried on a carriage of two wheels equally as well as upon one of four except long timber and as waggons are so destruc∣tive to roads  The superior goodness of the roads in Cumberland may in a great measure be attributed to the universal use of singlehorse cartsWherever waggons are used they are the destruction of roads especially in hilly countries where they are obliged to lock the wheels the banks are in a manner ploughed up with them and the nine inch wheels are in reality no more than three inch wheels by the artful mode of laying on the middle course of tyre which is  raised an inch above the rest  instead of being nearly ex∣empted from tolls every  horse  drawing in a  waggon  ought to pay  treble  to what should be exacted from a  horse  drawing in a  singlehorse cart  why should their use be longer persisted in as it is clear that the same number of horses yoked in single horse carts will draw more than when yoked six or eight togetherthey are easier loaded and unloaded are much more handy for almost every purpose and six or eight may be driven by a man and a boy which is a trifling additional expence If a middlesized Cumberland horse  draws cwt a large strong waggon horse will as easily draw cwt and which is done in some parts of the kingdom  For destroying Moles  a most excellent practice is pre∣valent here for every parish to let the taking of their moles for a  term of years  at a certain yearly sum which is raised in the same manner as the parochial taxes and does not now exceed a halfpenny an acre which they justly observe was much cheaper than they could have the ground  scaled for  were the moles not destroyed in this manner It is a pity but there was  a law  to oblige every parish in the kingdom to destroy their moles in the same manner which is done so effectually here that we scarce ever saw a molehill upon the inclosed grounds of most parts of Cumberland  WESTMORLAND  AAA  Range of Mou  tains  Coal  and

BOARD OF AGRICULTURE  AND  INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT  BY MR A PRINGLE OF  BALENCRIEFF  INTRODUCTION  GREAT Britain had long availed herself of her natur∣ally fortunate position for commerce which encouraged by every means that the wisdom of the legislature could devise had been carried to an extent hitherto unequalled in the universe and the industry of her inhabitants assisted by the fostering hand of government had brought many branches of manufactures to the highest state of perfection while the cultivation of her fields was left to the feeble exertions of the husbandman aided only by bounties on the raising of flax and on the exportation of corn It was reserved for our days to behold a Board composed of the first officers of the state and of persons equally respectable for high rank distinguished abilities and independent fortune established to fix the attention of a great nation on the improvement of its soil and to direct and assist in the ancient and most important of all arts that of providing food for man  The eyes of all Europe are already turned to this Board which it is believed is the first national establishment on a great scale that ever existed in any country in favour of agriculture and the advantages of which now appear so obvious that it is a matter of astonishment that such an institution was not sooner erected  At the time of the landing of the Romans on this island corn was raised only on the coasts and even so late as the expedition of Severus tillage was altogether unknown in those parts which lay between his wall and that of An∣toninus But under the dominion of that wonderful  people it soon came to be considered as the granary of the western Empire and immense quantities of corn were annually exported for the use of the armies in Germany and in Gaul and in the year when there happened to be an extraordinary demand upon the continent Julian ordered eight hundred ships to be built larger than the common barks and sent them to Britain for grain It is not possible to ascertain the capacity of these vessels but it is probable from privileges that were granted to those who built ships above a certain size that many of them would contain more than ten thousand Roman mo∣dia or upwards of three hundred English quarters  Considering the change of manners it is not to be ex∣pected that the days of ancient Rome will be revived when the most distinguished citizens united the culture of the liberal arts with the tillage of their fields and when the highest Officers of the State having left the helm of government did not disdain to lay hold of the stilts of the plough When however we contemplate the rapid pro∣gress which agriculture made in this island in the rude days of that superstitious people who were governed in their time of sowing by the age of the Moon and the setting of the Pleiades what may not be hoped for from the spirit of an enlightened nation fully excited and directed to its pro∣per objects by the newly established Board under whose auspices were but the ravages of war to cease for a century Great Britain would attain to an incredible degree of wealth and cultivation Enjoying a soil of great original fertility and a climate favourable to the growth of most branches of the vegetable kingdom its craggy mountains and verdant hills would be cloathed with lofty timber or bleat with innumerable slocks its meadows would rear the stately bullock and its fruitful plains would wave with the richest crops of every grain that the influence of a British sun can pour into the lap of plenty The perse∣vering  hand of industry would even teach trees and plants to flourish that at present are sickly and droop and can hardly exist through the severity of an inclement winter In a few centuries more others might be cultivated with success which if directly transplanted to our climate would immediately perish When peaches were first raised in Italy all the world was surprised that they could be brought to perfection out of Persia What would Caesar and Diodorus Siculus say were they told that the most esteemed wines of Europe are produced in Gaul Germany and Hungary where they imagined that vines would not grow Or Strabo if he knew that figs can be propagated in the north of Scotland Or Lucullus that cherries will grow almost any where which in his time were known only in Cerasus and the milder climates of Europe  Trees and plants being altogether passive accommo∣date themselves very slowly to a change of climate but the idea has been already  No apology is due to the author of J W Spencer's travels for the freedom that is here used with them  thrown out that even those of the torrid zone  may  be made to flourish in northern regions  may  become gradually inured to the climate that the climate it self  may  be changed for the better and that some thousands of years hence reposing under their own olive trees future Britons  may  quaff their own wine or sip their own tea sweetened with the juice of their own sugar cane  PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS BY THE BISHOP OF LANDAFF  Extent of the County  THE county of Westmoreland was surveyed in and a map of it upon a scale of an inch to a mile was engraved by Thomas Jeffreys geographer to his Majesty in It appears from this map that the greatest breadth of the county from its southern boundary near Burton to its northern one near Penrith in Cumberland is thirtytwo miles and that its greatest length from east to west is forty miles  I covered this map very exactly with fine writing paper except the Estuary near Millthrope and Windermere lake I then cut out a slip of the paper of an inch in breadth and of ten inches in length and weighed it accurately from another part of the same paper I cut another slip two inches in breadth and five in length and found it to be precisely of the same weight as the first slip and hence as the surfaces of the two slips were equal we may collect that the paper was of an uniform thickness The area of each of these slips was ten square inches and consequent∣ly covered a space on the map equal to ten square miles I then weighed the whole of the paper which had covered the map and by comparing the weight of the whole with the weight of what had covered ten square miles I found  the number of square miles in the whole to be now there are statute acres in a square mile and conse∣quently acres in the whole county  I measured this map in the ordinary way by resolving it into triangles and found its area to be equal to square miles or statute acres  Templeman  in his survey of the globe makes the area of the county of Westmoreland equal to square miles and consequently according to him it contains acres The medium of these three different estimates though I am most disposed to rely on the first is  Professor  Zimmerman  in his political survey of Europe estimates England and Wales at square miles a∣mounting to ▪ statute acres  Templeman  in the work above mentioned says that England and Wales contain square miles or statute acres the mean of these two gives statute acres for the whole surface of England and Wales and hence the county of Westmoreland may in superficial content be esteemed a seventythird part of England and Wales  Proportion between the Cultivated and Waste Lands in the County  In when a bounty was first granted on the expor∣tation of corn onethird part of the land in England and Wales or about eleven millions of acres was supposed to lie in uncultivated commons if this was then a just pro∣portion between the cultivated and waste parts of the kingdom we may safely conclude that much above onethird part of Westmoreland was then waste land as it is evident from a bare view of the county that few if any counties in England have in proportion to their whole extent so much uncultivated land as this has The many inclosures which have taken place during the  last hundred years have lessened in some degree the waste land of the whole kingdom but no inclosures of much consequence have taken place in Westmoreland Instead of onethird I am disposed to conjecture that threefourth parts of Westmoreland consist of uncultivated land I will state my reasons for this conjecture being as sensible as any person can be of the objections which may be made to it but in a matter where there are no  data  to proceed upon a conjectural argument may be allowed  It appears by the return made by the overseers of the poor to the House of Commons that the sum raised by assessment in all the parishes and townships of the county at a medium of three years ending in amounted to l The town of Kendall including Kirkland is the only large town in the county it is found by an actu∣al survey made this year to contain inhabitants hav∣ing experienced an increase of inhabitants since the year of the present number or about one fiftysixth part of the whole are  paupers  living in the workhouse The poor rates of this town amounted ac∣cording to the same return to l a year this sum being subducted from the annual amount of all the poor rates in the county leaves l for the sum raised from all the estates in the county exclusive of Kendall From particular inquiries in various parishes I am of opinion that the poor rates do not in this county exceed a shil∣ling in the pound in the actual rental of all the lands but a shilling in the pound supposing the sum annually raised to be l will give a rental of l All the land in Westmoreland which can either be ploughed or mown for hay is worth at least a rent of a pound a statute acre on an average and hence it may be inferred that acres of such land or less than onefourth part of the whole would yield a rental equal to if not exceed∣ing the rental of the county The high inclosed rough  pastures are let from one to five shillings an acre But whether the uncultivated land in Westmoreland be equal to threefourths or one half of the whole it cannot be questioned that there is so much of it as to render its improvement a matter not only of individual concern but of national importance  Improvement of Waste Lands  The uncultivated lands in Westmoreland are of various sorts with respect to soil and situation and capable of different sorts of improvement Some of them consist of extensive commons in low situations and are of an excel∣lent soil these might be improved by inclosures without any risk of loss by the undertaking Others constitute extensive mountainous districts called by the natives  fells  and  moors  the soil of these is generally speaking an hazel mould In its natural state it produces little else than a coarse benty grass heath and fern or in the language of the country  ling  and  brackens  Many of these fells are in their present state of so little value that the liberty of keeping ten sheep on them may be hired for sixpence ayear Supposing six acres to be sufficient for the main∣tenance of ten sheep the rent of such land is a penny an acre and the price of the fee simple of it at twentyfour years purchase two shillings Whilst there is an acre of such waste improveable land in Great Britain it may be hoped that when the legislature shall turn its attention to the subject no inhabitant of the island will be driven by distress to seek a subsistence in Africa or America  Above forty years ago an experiment was tried in Spain with respect to the cultivation of waste lands Several thousands of poor and vagabond people were settled on them at the expence of the government If this experiment has succeeded which may be easily known so far as that the land has been made produc∣tive  that the settlers have been increased and that the government has been reimbursed the whole or a princi∣pal part of its expence it may induce other governments to adopt the same or a similar plan The giving a cot∣tage and a few acres of land under a small reserved rent and perhaps under other useful restrictions to a poor man is certainly a good way of improving the land When a man has lands of his own he and his family will exert in its cultivation a quantity of labour which would not otherwise be brought into existence The value of this otherwise nonexisting labour is in one respect nothing it ought not to be reckoned as a part of the expence attending the improvement of the land and on that account many thousands of acres of land might be brought into cultivation which would not in any o∣ther way pay the expence of improvement The man∣ner of improving moorland by paring burning liming c is well understood by some few individuals and the advantage resulting from it ascertained by what has been recently practised in some parts of the county on private estates  There are many barren mountains in this county which do not admit improvement by paring and burning and which are incapable of being profitably converted either into arable or good pasture land yet the highest and most craggy parts two acres of which do not afford sus∣tenance for six months in the year to one sheep might with a great prospect of success be planted with larches I say with a great prospect of success for I do not speak with certainty not knowing whether there are in Great Britain any plantations of larch made on such exposed and rocky situations as are here spoken of But on the other hand it is known that the larch grows in Italy on higher mountains than any that we have in this island and not only that it grows in Italy where the climate is  less severe than in Great Britain but that it grows in the north of Russia where it is much more severe for at Archangel in the latitude of ° ships are built of larch growing in that climate  It may be of use to state the probable profit which would attend planting the land in question with larch A thousand acres of this sort of land might be inclosed with a circular wall six feet in height where the stones can be easily gotten as they may in most parts after the rate of six shillings an acre or l for the whole five hundred larches two feet in height so as to enable them to resist the long grass might be planted on each acre for fourteen shillings hence a plantation of larches might be made for l Now l improv∣ed at compound interest at the rate of l per cent would in sixty years amount to the sum of l this is the accumulated loss attending the inclosing and planting acres of rocky land in sixty years The rent of acres at one penny an acre is l s d ayear in eight years the larches would be out of all dan∣ger from sheep so that the loss of rent ought only to be estimated for eight years but l s d a year though improved after the same rate of compound interest would not amount to l in eight years say however that it would amount to l which is allowing more than two pence an acre for the annual rent of the land then would the whole expence attending the plantation in six∣ty years be l If the amount of l for years be taken into consideration the expence of the plantation in years will be l I have here supposed sheep to be shut out of the plantation for eight years if it should be found that sheep will not crop the larch and from more than one observation I have reason to believe that they will not they need not be shut out at all nor on districts where nothing but sheep are depastured need  any fence be made I know the advocates for close plant∣ing instead of would require larches for each acre I am not convinced of the utility of such close planting except where it is intended to nurse up oaks or other kinds of wood but if that mode should be adopt∣ed the thinnings after twenty years growth would pay the expence of it At the expiration of sixty years sup∣pose that only larches remained on each acre or that one half had perished the probable value of them may be thus estimated From a great many experiments made by myself and collected from others I find the annual in∣crease in circumference of the larch at six feet from the ground to be one inch and one half on an average of several years and this inference has been drawn from the actual admeasurement of larches in different parts of England and Scotland and of different ages from ten years old to fifty On this supposition the larches would measure one with another ninety inches in circumfer∣ence at six feet from the ground A larch which mea∣sures ninety inches at six feet from the ground would measure above seventy feet from the ground but supposing seventy inches to be the circumference at twenty feet and the length of the tree to be forty feet neglecting the remaining top then will its solid content be eightyfive cubic feet and the value of the tree at nine∣pence a foot above three guineas But as the trees are supposed to be planted in an high bleak barren situation their annual increase may not be so great as is here sup∣posed instead of being worth at sixty years after plant∣ing three guineas a piece admit that they are worth on∣ly ten shillings each then would the whole plantation be worth l and deducting the whole expence l as before estimated there would remain a profit of l The present value of l to be re∣ceived sixty years hence is above l interest of  money at l per cent Ten thousand pounds at l per cent purchases an income of l a year by planting then a barren estate of a thousand acres is improved from l s d to l a year reckoning the value of a reversion as a present certainty Sixty years is a great part of the life of a man but it ought to be considered as nothing in the existence of a nation or even of a family which is a little nation The waste lands in this and o∣ther counties are a public treasure in the hands of private persons all of them ought to be converted into arable meadow or pasture land which are capable of admitting with profit that kind of improvement and such of them as will not pay for that mode of improvement ought to be covered with wood the high parts and es∣pecially the sheltered dells in the high parts with larch and the lower with oak ash c When a spirit of ag∣ricultural improvement is fully excited the individuals to whom such uncultivated lands belong will be prompt∣ed by an attention to their own interest to forward every judicious plan which may be proposed for rendering them more useful to the proprietors and to the commu∣nity their present application to the Summermainten∣ance of a few miserable sheep ought not to be persevered in if any other use can be made of them  Coppices  In some parts of Westmoreland considerable portions of land are covered with coppices consisting principally of oak ash alder birch and hazel These underwoods are usually cut down every sixteenth year The uses to which they are applied are chiefly twohoops and char∣coal The hoops are sold in the wood at l a thousand they are generally manufactured in the country and sent by sea to Liverpool the charcoal is sent to the iron fur∣naces in the neighbourhood The value of a statute acre  of coppicewood of sixteen years growth is variable from l to l and if it consists altogether of oak its price may amount to twenty guineas l for the charcoal and l for the bark it being the custom here to peel the bolls and all the branches of the oak which are equal to the thickness of a man's thumb  It is an extraordinary thing to see any trees left to stand for timber in these underwoods the high price of bark being a temptation to cut the whole down Fine sap∣lings from nine to twelve inches in circumference at five feet from the ground and with bark as splendid as polish∣ed silver are felled by the unfeeling proprietor with as little regret as if they were thorns or briars Of late in∣deed some few owners of underwoods have left standards and if they consult their interest the practice will become general As this is a point denied by many proprietors of coppices it may be of use to explain the principles on which the observation is founded  Suppose a statute acre of underwood to be in the spring of sixteen years old and that the whole is then cut down and sold for l this sum will in sixtyfour years reckoning compound interest at per cent amount to l In another fall of underwood of the same value will be made the l then arising im∣proved for fortyeight years in the same way will pro∣duce l In another l will arise from another fall of the underwood this sum improved for thirtytwo years will amount to l In another fall will produce l which in sixteen years will become l And lastly in or in sixtyfour years from a∣nother fall will produce l The amount of the value of the five falls thus estimated and improved will be l Let us now calculate the profit which would re∣sult in the same time from the same acre of underwood if it was managed in a different way Instead of cutting  the whole down in let us suppose that of the best young oaks are left to stand for timber the then value of these at d a tree is s this being subducted from l the value of the whole coppice leaves l s This sum improved as before will amount in sixtyfour years to l shillings and pence in these calculations being neglected The next fall in ought not to be valued at more than l as trees then of thirty two years growth will do some injury to the underwood l in fortyeight years will amount to l The next fall in may be valued at l and at that time seventy five trees should be taken down these trees will then be fortyeight years old and worth s a tree or l in the whole this added to l the value of the then under∣wood makes l which in thirtytwo years will pro∣duce l Without estimating the underwood in and in at any thing or the value of the pasturage for thirtytwo years at any thing let us suppose the se∣ventyfive remaining trees to be cut down in being then eighty years old and that they would one with a∣nother be worth l apiece or l in the whole The sum of the profits thus arising is l or more than double the other amount  It is a general opinion in this and I believe in other countries that it is more profitable to fell oak wood at fifty or sixty years growth than to let it stand for navytimber to eighty or one hundred According to the price which is now paid for that commodity either by the NavyBoard or the East India Company I believe the opinion to be founded in truth The following observations contain the reason for this belief  If profit is considered every tree of every kind ought to be cut down and sold when the annual increase in value of the tree by its growth is less than the annual interest of the money it would sell forthis being ad∣mitted  we have only to inquire into the annual increase in the value of oaks of different ages  In the Philosophical Transactions for there are some useful tables respecting the growth of trees by Mr Marsham from these tables the two following inferences may be drawn  That it is highly profitable to let young thriving oaks which are not worth above s a tree continue standing  That it is not profitable to let oaks of or years growth continue standing  Three oaks marked in the tables No in April before they began to shoot contained eleven and one half feet of wood and were altogether worth at eighteen pence a foot bark included s d The same trees sixteen years afterwards contained thirtyfour and one half feet and were worth l s d Now if s and d had been improved at the rate of per cent at compound interest for sixteen years it would not have amounted to l s d and of consequence the pro∣prietor by letting such oaks stand improves his property in as high a degree as if he put out his money to interest at near seven and a half per cent  Three oaks No in contained ½ feet of timber and were worth l s d The same trees sixteen years afterwards contained ½ feet and were worth l s d Now l s d the value of the trees in improved at the low rate of interest of l per cent would in sixteen years amount to a sum exceeding l s d The proprietor then by letting such trees stand does not improve his property at the rate of l per cent  The oak No in the third table was worth l s d in it gained in one year one foot or s d in va∣lue if it had been worth s and had gained one foot  there would have been no prosit in letting it stand as the interest of s at per cent would have produced s d in the year and it is for this reason that I have fixed upon s as the value of trees which should be cut down if they are cut sooner or later the proprietor will be a loser It must not be supposed however that great precision can attend this observation since particular soils or the greater or less thriving condition of the wood may render it useful to cut down trees before they are worth s or to let them stand a while longer It ought to be remarked also that large trees sell for more per foot than small ones do yet the usual increase of price is not a compensation to the proprietor for let∣ting his timber stand to a great age This may be made out from the following experiment  On the th October I measured at six feet from the ground the circumference of a very fine oak of eightytwo years growth from the time of its being planted and found it to be inches On the same day of the month in it measured inchesThere is not one oak in fifty at the age of this which gains an inch in circumference in one year The length of the boll of this tree was about eighteen feet it con∣tained about eightyfour feet of timber and was worth at s a foot l s It gained in one year very little more than a foot and one half of timber or s d in value but the interest of l s at l per cent a∣mounts in one year to above twice the value of the in∣crease even of this tree which is a singularly thriving one  I have been the more particular on this subject from a public consideration Many men are alarmed lest our posterity should experience a scarcity of oak timber for the use of the navy and various means of increasing its quantity have been recommended with great judgment  In addition to these means the making a much greater than the ordinary increase of price on timber of a large scantling might be not improperly submitted to the con∣sideration of those who are concerned in the business If the Navyboard would give l or l a load for timber trees containing cubic feet or upwards instead of l or l every man in the kingdom would have a reasonable motive for letting his timber stand till it became of a size sit for the use of the navy whereas according to the present price it is every man's interest to cut it down sooner  In the neighbourhood of Ambleside there is found a stratum of gray limestone which though it contains a little clay might be as serviceable as the purest sort for agricultural purposes but unfortunately for the im∣provement of this part of the county coal is so dear that very little of this limestone is burned The lime which is used in the culture of the lands being either fetched from Kendall or brought up Windermere lake at a great expence As there is great plenty of coppice wood in the district here spoken of it may be useful for the far∣mers and landowners to consider whether the burning of lime with fagots in a flamekiln as is practised in Suf∣fex may not be a more beneficial application of the un∣derwoods than the converting them into charcoal Even the spraywood here called  chats  which is too small to be made into charcoal and which is now sold for sixpence a cart or more generally left on the ground might be made into fagots and mixed with wood of a larger size so that no part of the coppice would be lost In Suffex they use fagots cut in the Winter and weighing when dry in the Spring thirtysix pounds each for the burning of Winchester bushels of lime  May I be permitted to hazard another conjecture re∣specting the use to which coppices might be applied  without injuring either the quantity or the quality of the charcoal obtained from them Pit coal yields by distilla∣tion about a twentyfourth part of its weight of a thick tenacious oil resembling tar All sorts of wood yield a similar oil by the same process I do not know whether the oil from wood be of an inferior or of a superior quality to that from pit coal but I suspect it to be fitter for cordage c In the ordinary way of making char∣coal the whole of this oil is dispersed in the form of smoke may it not deserve to be inquired whether this oil might not be saved with profit The process which is used in America for extracting tar from the pine tree is little different from that by which charcoal is made in England Whether the quantity of oil which might be obtained from a pit of wood when converted into char∣coal would exceed in value the expence of procuring it can only be decided by experiment The reader may form some guess at the quantity from the following state∣ment The black part of guiacum wood yields a tenth the sappy part a thirteenth part of its weight of thick black oil Sassafras wood oak ash alder birch c give by distillation and making charcoal is a species of distillation from a twentyfourth to a twelfth part of their respective weights of this oil The difference in quantity arises from a diversity in the texture age and dryness of the woods I suppose that a cord of coppice wood would weigh a ton and that four cords would make one dozen of sacks of charcoal and that wood of this sort would yield a twentieth part of its weight of oil on these suppositions there is dissipated in making one dozen of charcoal lbs of oil or one ton in every five dozen  CHAPTER I  GEOGRAPHICAL STATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES  SECT  Situation and Extent  WESTMORELAND is situated between ° ′ ″ and ° ′ ″ N lat and between ° ′ and ° ′ long W from London It is an inland county bounded on the N by the bishopric of Durham and Cumberland on the W by Cumberland and Lancashire on the S by Lancashire and Yorkshire and by York∣shire and Durham on the E and contains according to the Bishop of Landaff's Preliminary Observations about square miles or statute acres three fourth parts of which he conjectures to consist of uncultivated land  SECT  Divisions  Westmoreland is divided into East Ward West Ward Kendall and Lonsdale Wards and consists of pa∣rishes  SECT  Climate  The climate of this county as may be expected from its vicinity to the western ocean over which the south∣west winds blow for eight months of the year and bring the exhalations to descend in rain on the mountains is remarkably moist The quantity of rain that falls in the west part in a year has been ascertained by raingages  kept at Kendall and on the banks of Windermere In the wet year it amounted to eightythree  es In ordinary years it amounts to fortyfive or fifty inches the lowest of which is twenty inches above the medium quantity that falls in Europe The air however is pure and healthful the Winters rather long and severe In the Winter thirtysix pounds were paid for cutting only a horse track through the snow upon less than ten miles of the road from Shap to Kendall  SECT  Soil and Surface  The county in general is so mountainous and hilly that a great proportion of it must for ever remain undis∣turbed by the plough Between these mountains there are several very pleasant and fertile vallies that want only trees and hedgerows to be truly beautiful The most prevailing soil in Westmoreland is a dry gravelly mould sand and hazel mould appear in various parts but chiefly in the E and N clay is found on a few farms towards the Eden and Eastern mountains and a heavy moist soil on others in the N parts of the county Peat moss makes its appearance in small patches in many of the vales and a∣bounds on the tops of several high mountains which how∣ever are in general covered with a dry soil upon a hard blue rock provincially called  rag  The soil that lies up∣on a limestone bottom is uniformly esteemed the best  SECT  Minerals  Notwithstanding its mountainous surface no valuable mines have yet been discovered in Westmoreland Some trifling veins of leadore have been found in the Eastern mountains coal is wrought only in the S E extremity of the county and in the neighbourhood of Shap where a bastard or crow coal is got  Limestone in almost inexhaustible abundance is to be found in most parts of the county except among the Western hills which afford an excellent kind of blue slates well known over almost all England  Gypsum is got at Acronbank near KirkbyThore and a few other places it is used for laying floors but not at all as a manure  Freestone is found in the Eastern parts of the county and at Huttonroofe about miles from Kendall  On the river Kent about miles below Kendall a vein of beautiful marble was discovered about four years ago in the lands of Daniel Wilson  Esq  of DallamTower by some workmen who were building a barn and the main quarry has been opened on the estate of that gentleman It has lately been found on the opposite side of the river in the property of Strickland  Esq  of Syzergh  SECT  Water  Rivers  Of the numerous streams that rush from the mountains and water the vallies beneath there are only three that preserve their names to the ocean The Eden which springs in Mallerstang and having received in its course the Eamont and the Lowther and many little rivu∣lets enters Cumberland and running the whole length of that county empties itself into the Solway Firth below Carlisle The Kent rises in Kentmere washes the vale of Kendall and loses itself in the Estuary near Milthrope the only seaport in the county The third is the Lon or Lune which has its source in Ravenstonedale and flows through the vale to which it gives its name till it enters the county of Lancaster below KirkbyLonsdale  Betwixt the mountains several extensive lakes are form∣ed the beautiful verdure of whose banks with their shady groves limpid waters and pebbly bottom are par∣ticularly  described in  the Guides to the Lakes  offered to every traveller who visits this part of the kingdom  The rivers and lakes abound with many different kinds of fish great part of which is now carried to Lancaster and Liverpool  CHAPTER II  STATE OF PROPERTY  SECT  Estates and their Management  A Large proportion of the county of Westmoreland is possessed by a Yeomanry who occupy small estates of their own from l to l a year The remainder con∣sists of larger estates belonging to Noblemen and Gentle∣men several of whom are resident in the county and take the management into their own hands Others entrust the care of their affairs in a great measure to stewards  SECT  Tenures  The larger estates in Westmoreland are commonly freehold and the small tenements mentioned in the last section are generally held under the lord of the manor by  customary tenure  which differs but little from that by  copyhold  or copy of  court roll  In some manors the tenant pays only a heriot and fine certain on death of the lord or tenant in others the fine is arbitrary on death or purchase On customary estates the wood is generally claimed by the lord of the manor  CHAPTER III  BUILDINGS  SECT  Houses of Proprietors  FROM the short residence the Author of this Report made in Westmoreland he cannot pretend even to enu∣merate the various seats of the great proprietors through∣out the county and the neat snug boxes belonging to gentlemen of moderate fortune that adorn the banks of its beautiful lakes  SECT  Farm Houses Offices and Repairs  The lands of the  statesmen  and farmers in this county lie so intermixed that their habitations and offices which are often built together in little straggling villages must of necessity be very inconvenient for farming purposes but convenience has been little studied even on those farms whose fields lie unmixed The principal structure is a barn which at the same time that it has a stable and cowhouse underneath is frequently large enough to contain the whole crop of both corn and hay so that it is rare to see a stack of either These barns are often twenty yards in length five in width and five yards in height in the side walls The expence of bringing all the materials from a moderate distance and of building a barn of such dimensions with a slated roof may be about seventy guineas The houses are generally covered with slates which are found in several parts of the county  The slates are not nailed on boards but hung with oak pegs on laths and plaistered in the inside of the roof A few houses are still thatched with wheat straw which is sold from s d to s d a threave of twentyfour sheaves  The expences of repairs are for the most part defrayed by the landlord  SECT  Cottages  There are very few mere cottages in the county the labourer and mechanic generally reside in a small farmhouse and occupy more or less land  CHAPTER IV  MODE OF OCCUPATION  SECT  Size of FarmsCharacter of Farmers  FARMS in general are so small that it is rare to meet with one of l a year of rent though there are some of even l or l a year  It might be useful to know what proportion of the lands in the county is possessed by that numerous and re∣spectable Yeomanry already mentioned as occupying small estates of their own from l or l to l a year These men in contradistinction to farmers or those who hire the land they occupy are usually denominated  states∣men  They live poorly and labour hard and some of them particularly in the vicinity of Kendall in the in∣tervals  of labour from agricultural avocations busy them∣selves in weaving stuffs for the manufacturers of that town The consciousness of their independence renders them impatient of oppression or insult but they are gen∣tle and obliging when treated by their superiors with kindness and respect This class of men is daily decreas∣ing The turnpike roads have brought the manners of the capital to this extremity of the kingdom The simplicity of ancient times is gone Finer clothes bet∣ter dwellings and more expensive viands are now sought after by all This change of manners combined with other circumstances which have taken place within the last forty years has compelled many a  statesman  to sell his property and reduced him to the necessity of work∣ing as a labourer in those fields which perhap he and his ancestors had for many generations cultivated as their own It is difficult to contemplate this change without regret but considering the matter on the scale of national utility it may be questioned whether the agriculture of the county will not be improved as the landed property of it becomes less divided  It is painful to one who has in his composition the smallest spark of knight errantry to behold the beautiful servant maids of this county toiling in the severe labours of the field They drive the harrows or the ploughs when they are drawn by three or four horses nay it is not uncommon to see sweating at the dungcart a girl whose elegant features and delicate nicelyproportioned limbs seemingly but ill accord with such rough employ∣ment  A judgment of the refinement and civilization of a people has been often formed from their treatment of the fair sex and in this respect France was formerly held up to the world as a model Unfortunately the man∣ners of nations are too often painted by those who have  been conversant only with persons in what may be called high life but were it allowable to apply this rule even to France and to look for specimens into the lower or∣ders of society and it is there surely that the most faith∣ful representatives of national character or manners are to be met with it would be found that the women even in the boasted days of her monarchy were doomed to the severest labour to load the dungcart to saw the wood and to thresh the corn  The common people of both sexes wear especially in the winter season instead of shoes  cloggs  which differ from shoes in this that the bottom part is made of wood The wood is generally either birch alder or sycamore it is about an inch in thickness and a rim of iron is nailed round the bottom of it A pair of  cloggs  costs s d they keep the feet warm and dry and with good care will last a twelvemonth  SECT  Rent  The rent of the land varies with its situation and fer∣tility In all situations and of all qualities it has encreas∣ed greatly in its value within these few years This may be owing partly to the advance in the price of its produc∣tions and partly to improvements in the art of farming At Shap Ambleside and in Troutbeck the best haymeadows are let at about s the customary acre Near towns the rent of the best fields to be mowed may be at a medium rather above l per acre At KirkbyStephen and Appleby they are not quite so valuable Near Ken∣dall Burton and Milthrope some fields are let at l and at KirkbyLondsdale there are a few which fetch above l Lands of inferior kinds may be hired for pas∣ture at all varieties of price In Ravenstondale where no tithes are paid and where the land derives no part of its value from its situation there are between and  acres inclosed four fifths of these are let from s to s the statuteacre and the remaining fifth from s to s  In the bottom of Westmoreland a farm of an hundred acres of inclosed land may be hired upon lease for l A farm containing much coarse pastureland may be had for s or s per acre It is not always known whe∣ther these coarse pastures have been measured they be∣ing sometimes estimated by the number of cattle they can maintain  Besides the rent the farmer is subjected to the payment of tithes poor rates and road money  SECT  Tithes  In some parts of Westmoreland tithes are taken in kind in some each farmer has an opportunity of taking his own tithes in others the land is tithe free or pays a small prescription in lieu of tithes  SECT  Poor Rates  From the best information he has been able to collect the Bishop of Landaff in the Preliminary Observations has stated the average of poor rates not to exceed a shil∣ling in the pound in the rental of all the lands in the county  SECT  Leases  The mode of farming is nearly the same throughout the county and the course of crops is often pointed out to the farmer in his lease which is generally for seven or nine years sometimes only for five or three years at o∣thers for fourteen and in a few instances for twentyone years Some principal landowners grant no leases  SECT  Expence and Profit  A long and intimate acquaintance with the manage∣ment of farmers would be necessary to state any thing with precision upon this part of the subject It has been said that the general oeconomy of a farm of acres at a rent of as many pounds does not differ widely from the following statement acres under crops of barley and oats acres in hay and the remaining acres in pasture that dairy cows kept on the best of this pas∣ture might probably yield firkins of butter and that the profit would be l or l per cent upon l the capital employed  CHAPTER V  IMPLEMENTS  IT has long been known what angle the sail ought to form with the keel to make the ship move in the water with the greatest velocity but to the present day was reserved the discovery of the angles which the compo∣nent parts of the plough ought to form with one another and with the line of draught in order that that instru∣ment might meet with the least possible resistance in the performance of its operation Agriculture cannotbut advance with hasty strides when the principles of philo∣sophy and the powers of mechanism are directed to its improvement  Ploughs  The ploughs of Westmoreland are light and  although not neatly constructed they are perhaps not ill suited to the soil they are destined to cultivate some of them have a wheel at the extremity of the beam which it is imagined serves to keep the furrow of an equal depth They are drawn most commonly by two but sometimes by three horses The turnwrist plough has been intro∣duced into the county by the Bishop of Landaff and may be of great service in ploughing the sides of the hills which are very numerous and steep in the arable lands  Carts  The carts are of various descriptions and sizes Those most commonly used may be fiftytwo inches in length thirtysix in breadth and fourteen and one half inches in depth containing less than sixteen cubic feet They are mounted in some places upon clogwheels and have twothirds of their length before the axle which is of wood There is scarcely a farming waggon to be met with in the county it being a general opinion that four horses in four separate carts will draw a greater weight than if they were yoked together in a waggon  The winnowing machines which are here very com∣mon and the harrows are both of the ordinary kinds The drill husbandry being yet in its infancy there are few instruments for hoeing or drilling  CHAPTER VI  INCLOSING FENCESGATES  EXCEPT a very few open fields on the east side of the river Eden the whole cultivated land in the county is divided by hedges or stone walls into inclosures many of  which do not contain half an acre there are a few of or acres and in general they may contain from to acres  The gates are of the most ordinary kind being often made by the farmer himself of such wood as happens to be upon the estate  CHAPTER VII  ARABLE LAND  SECT  Tillage Fallowing Rotation of Crops and Crops commonly cultivated  Course of Crops  WHEN a field of grass is overgrown with moss which commonly happens in seven or ten years it is broken up with the plough in the beginning of March and sown about the first of April with oats at the rate of seven and onehalf Winchester bushels upon the customary acre of square yards The crop is reaped about the middle of September and sixty bushels are reckoned a tolerably good return  Second Crop  The land is ploughed for the second crop as soon after Candlemas as the weather will permit and eighty or a hundred cartloads of stableyard dung are laid upon the acre It is ploughed again in April and sown with four bushels of barley or bigg The har∣vest is earlier than that of the oats and fiftyfour bushels are reckoned a good crop Some farmers plough three times for barley but it is the general practice that is here described  Third Crop  After the barley the land is ploughed in April and eight bushels of oats per acre are immediately sown upon it The harvest is commonly in September and the crop is usually as good as the first was  This is the most ordinary succession of crops though it is sometimes broken through by taking two crops of oats before the barley which in that case is followed by another of oats The land is then left to itself and the first year it produces a light crop of hay of bad quality In the third year the crop is at the best with regard to both quantity and quality In seven or in ten years it is again mossed over and is again ploughed up to undergo a similar treatment  Exceptions  st To this general mode of management there are several exceptions which perhaps it would be improper to omit From KirkbySteven to Brough and Appleby and from that town to TempleSowerby the soil is a deep sand which by cultivation becomes more compact and more retentive of moisture The fields of grass moss over sooner or later according to the quality of the soil some where the soil is thinnest and the sub∣jacent stratum the poorest it is judged necessary to break up after an interval of only four or six years In this part of the county there are particular farms where after the second crop which is oats generally inferior to the first the land is summer fallowed planted with potatoes or sown with turnips which last are given to the wintering stock of cattle and sheep Dung is always laid upon the fields designed for turnips and potatoes and the remain∣der upon the fallow which is likewise invariably and al∣ways successfully limed at the rate of seventyfive Win∣chester bushels per acre What is so fallowed is sown in the middle of September with two and onehalf bushels of rye per acre The crop is reaped before a year goes round and thirty bushels are reckoned a good return  In the month of May grassseeds are sown amongst the rye but are never covered either by the harrow or the roller Those fields which were turnips and potatoes are sown with barley or oats and grassseeds in the follow∣ing quantities to an acre eight pounds narrowleafed red clover seed which is preferred to the common broadleaf∣ed clover because it remains longer in the ground four pounds white clover four pounds hop clover four pounds of ribgrass and from five to ten bushels of hay seeds shaken from the crop of the former year These consist chiefly of  Bent  grass which seems to be a species of ryegrass of the great  Poa  or oat grass and  Dark  grass or Flanders hayseeds The first year whether it be hayed or pastured the crop is far more valuable than that of any natural grass in the neighbourhood upon soil of an equal quality and the cattle especially the horses uniformly prefer these artificial grasses to those which the land produces of its own accord  Exception d  In the immediate neighbourhood of Kendall where the soil is gravelly or sandy it is not un∣usual to take potatoes for the second crop and barley for the third the land is then sometimes left to itself but for the most part the barley is followed by a crop of oats A great many potatoes are grown and consumed in the county The price at the time of taking them up is commonly s d per Winchester bushel in the Winter and Spring it often rises to s The produce is variable from to Winchester bushels per statute acre They are cultivated in various ways but chiefly by the plough The inhabitants think that potatoes from fresh ground are of the best quality but the product is usually the greatest from an oat stubble Sometimes the farmer grows the potatoes at his own risk at others he manures the land with cartloads of dung per customary acre ploughs it once and lets it in this state at s the perch  to the manufacturers and labourers of Kendall who fur∣nish the plants and the rest of the labour The price they pay is high but reckoning little for the work they bestow upon it which is conducive to their health they are often well satisfied with their crop which is sometimes very great the land being well adapted for the cultiva∣tion of this root  Exception d  From Millthrope to Burton and from Burton by Farlton to Kirkby Lonsdale both the farms and inclosures appear to be somewhat larger than in most other parts of the county and it is not quite so rare to see a few acres of wheat The land designed for this crop is summerfallowed after the first or second year from the ley and is well manured with dung or lime or with both It is sown in September with wheat soaked in brine or washed with chamberlye and dried with lime at the rate of four bushels per customary acre Fortyfive bushels are reckoned a good crop and the harvest may be ten days earlier than it is in the northern parts of the county If the land is again manured it is sown with barley after the wheat if not manured it is sown with oats  SECT  Crops not commonly cultivated  It is painful to be obliged in this section to mention pease beans turnips clover and ryegrass but it is hop∣ed the time is not far distant when they will be cultivated on every farm Cabbages have been tried in the fields near Kendall and rape has lately been sown in small quantities in different parts of the county with great success  Flax and hemp are now rarely seen growing here though years ago a little hemp was sown by almost every cottager and statesman  CHAPTER VIII  GRASS  SECT  Natural Meadows and Pasture  EVERY occupier of land whether  statesman  or  farmer  having it in his power to keep any number of cattle through the months of Summer upon  joisted  fields where they may be kept at a cheap rate or upon commons where they may be kept almost for nothing it is a princi∣pal object with him to provide for them plenty of Win∣ter food Hence his attention is chiefly directed to his crop of hay It has been already stated that the quan∣tity of land at present under culture does not exceed onefourth part of the whole county or acres Had all the arable land in the county been cropped with corn three years out of twelve there would have been precisely onefourth part of the whole in tillage but there are many pastures of an inferior sort which are very seldom ploughed and in the high parts there is a much smaller proportion of the land in corn than there is in the low parts In the very extensive manor of Ra∣venstondale although there are between and acres inclosed there are not sixty acres of corn and it is probable that there are not in the county more than acres under crops of corn in one year The re∣maining acres are cut for hay or depastured with fattening beasts and rising stock or with cows ap∣plied to the purposes of the dairy From such an in∣spection of the county as was had with a view to the  framing of this Report the proportions used for these different purposes cannot be even guessed at but that for hay is perhaps the most considerable A prejudice against the artificial grasses prevails so generally over all the county that it may be almost literally said they are never sown When the land has produced a few crops of corn and it is judged that the moss is quite destroyed it is left to itself and such is the humidity of the climate and so strong is the vegetation of weeds and natural grasses that the very first crop has by actual experiment been found to produce stones of hay per acre weighed from the field As every person who expects to have occasion for hay hires a field to supply him with that commodity it is not often that hay is sold in large quantities and it is still seldomer that the quantity raised upon an acre is ex∣actly ascertained When sold it may bring from d to d a stone in Winter and Spring or from s to s a cubic yard A cubic yard in the lower part of a wellpressed mow may contain twelve stones of hay and has been known to sell as high as s or s In the southern and in the eastern parts of the county much attention is paid to the making of compost dunghills which with the dung that remains after manuring for the barley crop are always laid upon the hay grounds and are thought considerably to retard the progress of the moss At Ken∣dall and other places where dung can be purchased they are manured after the first crop and every third year while they continue in grass  SECT  Artificial Grasses  It was mentioned in the last section of the former chap∣ter that crops of clover and ryegrass had not yet en∣tered into the general course and therefore nothing can here be said upon this part of the subject except that they have been tried on several farms where they  have fully answered the expectations of those who made the experiment Some hints concerning the advantages of this practice may be seen in the conclusion to this lit∣tle Work  SECT  Hay Harvest  Although this is the principal harvest in most parts of Westmoreland nothing worthy of notice occurs upon the subject except perhaps the celerity with which the crop is got it being generally carried into the barn if the weather is good within three or four days after being mown  SECT  Feeding  Fattening Cattle  The young cattle are kept on the lands of inferior quality in Summer and have straw and a little hay given them in Winter When three years old if barren they are either fattened in the pastures or sold to the graziers of Yorkshire and Lancashire from l to l a piece if with calf from l s to l  Ten thousand Scotch cattle are annually sold at Broughhill fair in the end of September Though numbers of these are carried off by drovers to the south of England and many are brought by graziers from other counties great quantities remain in Westmoreland They are wintered on the coarse pastures and in the straw yard in May following the young ones are sent to the com∣mons and those of an age proper for feeding are put upon the best grounds and are ready for the shambles in October  Heifers are  joisted  upon tolerably good pasture from th May to Michaelmas at from l s to l s a head Horses are grazed among fattening cattle for s d a week Young horses are kept from Michaelmas to th  March on the inferior kinds of land and have straw given them in bad weather for s a week  Fattening Sheep  Almost all the sheep in the county except the wedders after the first year are brought from the mountains on the approach of Winter and kept in the inclosed grounds till the month of April Some gra∣ziers stock part of their pastures with wedders or with ewes and lambs The mutton and lamb which remain after supplying the consumption at home are sent to Lancaster and Liverpool  CHAPTER IX  GARDENS AND ORCHARDS  ALMOST every family in Westmoreland has a small garden for supplying them with the common potherbs  There are several orchards in the county which are said to be slourishing and profitable The common fruit trees succeed well in the low and warm vales but their culture is little attended to  CHAPTER X  WOODS AND PLANTATIONS  AT Whinfield Forest and at Lowtherhall the seat of the Right Honourable the Earl of Lonsdale there are  very extensive plantations where many of the trees have grown to an uncommon size Several of the oaks at Lowtherhall have been valued at fixty pounds a piece There are many smaller plantations and various clumps of trees throughout the county where the wood springs with a degree of vigour hardly to be expected in such bleak and exposed situations as many of them are planted in  On the division of Kendall common part of a very high and rocky hill not being capable of any other im∣provement was planted with Scotch fir larch oak ash c c all of which are very thriving  The banks of the lakes are likewise adorned with very beautiful coppices  The Bishop of Landaff has planted on some high ground near Ambleside above an hundred acres with oak ash elm beech sycamore Scotch fir and larch He is doubtful whether the climate be not too cold for any sort of wood except the fir and larch the other kinds after seven years growth are alive but stunted they shoot a little in the Spring but that shoot perishes as to its greatest part in the Winter Some of them have been out down but the new shoots do not promise well The firs and larches but especially the larches thrive as well as he could wish  CHAPTER XI  WASTES  THE Wastes in this county are very extensive and valuable They are depastured chiefly with stocks of  sheep which are managed in nearly the same way whether the ground be in common or in severalty  In Winter all the sheep are brought down to the in∣closed fields except the wedders which being thought able to endure the severity of any storm or fall of snow are left to shift for themselves upon the wastes where they remain till they are four years and a half old when they are sold from s to s a head Having dropped their lambs the ewes in the end of April are sent back to the wastes where the whole flock pastures indiscrim∣inately without an attendant The lambs are sometimes suffered to wean themselves at others the teats of the ewe are fastened up to her udder by a plaister of coarse paper and pitch The value of the wool and the ex∣pence of salving are the same with those mentioned sect chap  Scotch Sheep  Great numbers of Scotch hogs and din∣monds are annually bought at Stagshawbank fair in the month of June and grazed on the wastes of this county On some they are found to answer very badly on o∣thers they thrive well and are ready for the grazier a year earlier than those of the native breed There is here a strong prejudice in favour of these coarsewoolled sheep which there is every reason to believe is ill found∣ed the sort now known under the name of the  Cheviot  breed being equally hardy and much more profitable from the superior value of their fleece  Black Cattle  In addition to all these sheep numerous herds of black cattle are likewise to be seen upon the commons A few of these are of the breed of the coun∣ty and the rest are Scotch either bought at Broughhill fair in the end of September and wintered on the low grounds and in the strawyard or purchased in the Spring from drovers who fetch them from Galloway and Dumbarton In Autumn they are either sold to the  southcountry drovers or wintered and fattened in the county  Ponies  A few ponies of the Scotch breed are reared upon the commons but the practice not being general it need not be dilated upon  Geese  Great numbers of geese are bred upon the commons and sold to the Yorkshire drovers at about s d a head  It is generally understood that no person shall send to graze on any common more stock than he can winter upon his estate or farm in right of which he has a title to pasturage on that common This regulation however is little attended to and the commons are almost always overstocked to such a degree that many persons do not think it worth while to avail themselves of their right of commonage  On stinted pastures it is very ordinary to hire out the right of keeping both cattle and sheep A Summer's grass for an ox or for ten sheep on Forest Hall and Mosley common is let at s on a part of Troutbeck common where no sheep are allowed to feed an ox may be kept for s d and on another part of the same com∣mon  an ox or ten sheep may remain all the year for six∣pence  CHAPTER XII  IMPROVEMENTS  SECT  Draining  THE importance of having the land lie dry and of pre∣venting the water which in wet weather breaks out up∣on the declivities of the hills from chilling the fields be∣low is well known in Westmoreland The method of draining is fast improving and the practice is daily gain∣ing ground The drains are generally walled in the sides and covered with large stones out of the reach of the plough  SECT  Paring and Burning  The operation of paring and burning is much practised in Westmoreland both in improving moor lands and in reclaiming rough pastures that have been allowed to re∣turn almost to a state of nature It produces excellent crops at first but the effect is diminished every repetition and farmers are too apt to exhaust the land by repeated crops of oats without any manure  The expence is said to be from s to s per statute acre  SECT  Manuring  Dung  To increase the quantity of his manure and to apply it to the greatest advantage are by no means the least important of the various branches of the far∣mer's  avocation In those parts of Westmoreland where summerfallowing is not practised the land designed for barley and potatoes always receives the stable yard dung at the rate of or singlehorse cartloads an acre and in Autumn what remains is laid upon the haygrounds at a rate per acre considerably less  On some few farms in the neighbourhood of Appleby where summerfallow and crops of turnips may almost be said to enter into the general course the dung is car∣ried in Winter from the yard to the fields and laid down in a heap which is turned over two or three times with a view to accelerate putrefaction Twenty cartloads per acre are laid upon the turnip land and the fallow and its operation is always assisted by the addition of seventyfive Winchester bushels of lime Dung is sold at Ken∣dall and at Milthrope for s a cart load  Lime  In most parts of Westmoreland limestone is sound in inexhaustible plenty but coals to burn it must be carried from such a distance that its application to the purposes of agriculture has not yet become general When by the projected canal to Kendall coals shall be brought into the heart of the county its use must soon become universal  It is sometimes laid upon the land when it is in tillage but for the most part it is spread upon the surface of grass fields and it has been found to sweeten such as are coarse and benty amazingly  In whatever way it is applied and in whatever quan∣tity varying from to Winchester bushels an acre it is always attended with wonderful effect The price at the kilns is d or d a bushel  Composts  Much attention is paid to the making of compost dung hills in many parts of Westmoreland They are most commonly spread upon grass and experi∣ence has shewn that they at once improve its quality and  check for years the progress of the moss One hundred cartloads of earth rakings of the roads mud or rotten leaves and fifty of dung carefully mixed with Win∣chester bushels of lime are laid upon three acres with great advantage  Marl  This valuable manure was scarcely known in Westmoreland till about three years ago when a species of rock marl was discovered on Bolton Common It is easily come at and has been applied with advantage up∣on a small scale at the rate of single horse cartloads to an acre It is more than probable that if properly sought for  shell marl  might be got in many of the low grounds and marshes with which Westmoreland a∣bounds  SECT  Weeding  The weeding of turnips and potatoes is practised in Westmoreland but the hoeing of turnips is in general so ill executed that a gentleman of fortune in the county has recommended to the Board of Agriculture to send some turniphoers from those districts where this simple operation is better understood  The larger weeds are taken out from amongst the growing corn but it is very seldom that docks rag∣weeds c c are destroyed on the meadows and pas∣tures  SECT  Watering  The fertility attending the overflowing of the Nile and other muddy rivers has been long known and well ex∣plained from their depositing the earthy oleaginous sa∣line putrescent ingredients with which in their course from the mountains they become impregnated but it is a late discovery in philosophy which teaches us that pure  water is itself compounded of two principles and that one of its component parts is by the process of vegetation converted into the substance of vegetables This disco∣very enables us to account for the utility of irrigating land even with the clearest water which long experi∣ence has shewn to be a most efficacious mode of improve∣ment  Those who have opportunities of applying water and are not conversant in the practice would do well to imi∣tate the example of the Bishop of Landaff who is mak∣ing great improvements by watering at Calgarth Park It is practised on a small scale in many other parts of Westmoreland and always with great success  CHAPTER XIII  LIVE STOCK  SECT  Cattle  THE attention that was formerly paid to the breed of black cattle has rather diminished of late years They are longhorned very much resemble the Lancashire breed and when kept to a proper age grow to a great size As a heifer of three years old can be sold for as much as an ox would fetch at four it is rare to see a oullock of the country breed but to judge from those of all ages in the pastures at Lowtherhall they are ex∣cellent feeders and possess in an eminent degree the very desirable property of laying the fat upon their backs and other valuable parts The heisers and barren cows  if well chosen are confessedly good thrivers and are in great request among the graziers of Yorkshire and Lan∣cashire Not many years ago there was killed at Low∣therhall a bullock of the country breed whose carcase weighed one hundred and thirtytwo stones  Dairy  There are few counties in England in which there is no great manufacturing town where more milch cows are kept in proportion to its size and where the produce of the dairy forms a greater part of the profits of the farmer It may be naturally supposed that he is particular in the choice of his cows and that they are remarkable for giving a great quantity of milk Neither supposition however is founded in truth The farmer keeps just such cows as he has bred and they by no means yield so much milk as would be expected from those of the Dutch or even the Scotch breed  The Ayrshire breed is reckoned the best for milch cows in Scotland particularly in the neighbourhood of Dunlop The comparative value of all the different breeds in regard to quan∣tity of milk c the Board of Agriculture proposes to ascertain  upon a pasture of the same quality Farmers in the country ge∣nerally estimate the expence of keeping a milch cow at five pounds ayear and the produce at eight pounds Cows in the country are kept for the sake of making but∣ter of which great quantitles of an excellent quality are sent yearly to the London market in firkins of lbs net at from s to s each In the immediate neighbour∣hood of Kendall the dairy turns out to better account by selling the new milk which is contracted for all the year at ½d a quart being the same price which the London cowkeepers receive The skimmed milk is sold at one third part of that rate The ordinary price of a good milch cow may be about ten pounds  SECT  Sheep  The breed of sheep kept on the mountains and com∣mons of Westmoreland is either native or a cross with Scotch rams No attempt has yet been made to im∣prove either the carcase or the fleece They are horned dark or grey faced thick pelted with coarse strong hairy wool The whole stock upon a farm is herded to∣gether which is different from the practice in those counties where sheep farming is thought to be the best understood  Wintering  Those storemasters who have not upon their own farms pastures sufficient for the wintering of their young sheep send them to the low grounds from the st November to th April and pay s ahead for those that return They are so subject to the  Black water Sickness or Middlingill  that at an average ten out of an hundred die before Christmas After that being very hardy they seldom die and never of that disease  Price  The wedders are sold in October when four years and a half old from s to s each the barren ewes at Lammas from s to s and the old ewes about s to be wintered in the inclosed grounds and fattened with their lambs the ensuing Summer  Salving  In October or the beginning of November the whole flock is salved so heavily that a gallon of tar and lbs of butter are expended upon thirtyfive sheep A man may be hired for this work at s d aday in which time he will not salve above ten or a dozen or he will undertake to salve them at d ahead The whole expence is about sixpence apiece It has been repeatedly tried to substitute tobaccoliquor for the butter and tar but it is generally imagined that the wool is better for the sheep having been salved Near Kirkbysteven this  operation is performed with oil and tallow at an expence of d a head  Wool  The wool is worth on an average of years in time of peace d a pound Part of it is sold to the ma∣nufacturers of Kendall and part of it to those at Bradford and other places in Yorkshire The ewes are said to bear the best wool and on an average of a flock fix fleeces weigh a stone  Silverdale Breed  Silverdale a small district in the neighbourhood of Millthrope gives its name to the breed of sheep in this part of the county The soil is good and on a limestone stratum and a branch of the sea is nearly contiguous to it They are horned white faced and close woolled They are said to be native and are much superior to the common sort in regard both to fleece and carcase At the sale of a farmer's stock in October the lambs of this breed brought s d apiece the dinmonds s d and the ewes at the age of three years and a half s d or s d In the townships of Burton and Holme where this breed is kept five sheep at an average yield a stone of wool which is worth d a pound At a medium of the whole parish of Burton for eight years from to in∣clusive it required six fleeces to weigh a stone  It is not unusual for the proprietor to be owner of the sheep upon the farm In this case the farmer is to be considered as little better than a shepherd The flock is valued at the time of his entry and again at his removal and the difference between these valuations is settled in money  Experiments  st Twenty Lincolnshire  Mugg  ewes that had been tupped by a ram of Mr Bakewell's breed were brought into Westmoreland in the month of De∣cember and lambed in February These  Mugg  ewes were tupped in by a common Westmore∣land  ram and the dinmonds produced by this cross have turned out the best sheep in the county and weigh from lbs to lbs a quarter and are thought to be superior to those of the first breed  d Six of the lambs produced from the tup of Mr Bakewell's breed and the  Mugg  ewes were rams Four of these rams were put to ewes of the common breed in the county and the lambs sprung from this cross are much of the same size as the ordinary breed but they are broader on the back and finer in the wool As the experiment has not yet been long tried it must be left to time to show what the result will be  d The lambs produced by the Lincolnshire ewes and their own lambs of February are not so strong as these lambs of which the shepherd is disposed to attribute to a scarcity of food in the Spring rather than to any defect in the breed  th Thirty of this breed were left unsalved in they were in good condition and had no scab These same were again left unsalved in and broke out in scab early in It must be remarked that the sheep at the time of salving in were not in such condition as in so that it does not appear from this experi∣ment that there is any necessity for salving sheep in good condition  th The Lincolnshire ewes do not carry so much wool nor is it of such a good quality as when they were brought into the county  SECT  Horses  As there is but a small portion of the county under crop the horses are not numerous nor has any consider∣able attempt been made to improve the breed of these useful animals They are small not exceeding fourteen hands and a half in height are said to be hardy but they  are neither strong nor handsome sixteen or seventeen pounds are reckoned a good price for a horse at five years old Most commonly two tho' sometimes three and in the western part of the county even four are yoked to∣gether in a plough They are often turned upon the commons in the intervals of labour which as the farmer very probably has neither turnips nor fallow are very frequent in the summer months  There being only one person in Westmoreland who uses ox teams it may be justly inferred that the general opinion of farmers in the county is in favour of horses The writer of this Report has not such information upon the subject as to be able to draw the desired comparison between these useful animals  SECT  Hogs  The swine of Westmoreland though not large are good in their kind Farmers butchers and others who kill swine often dispose of the hams to persons who make a trade of curing them for sale Perhaps there may not be any thing peculiar in the mode of making hams in this county but it is believed that a detail of the process may be entered here without impropriety  The hams are first rubbed very hard generally with bay salt by some they are covered close up by others they are left on a stone bench to allow the brine to run off At the end of five days they are again rubbed as hard as they were at first with salt of the same sort mix∣ed with rather more than an ounce of saltpetre to a ham Having lain about a week either on a stonebench or in hogsheads amongst the brine they are hung up by some in the chimney amidst the smoke whether of peats or coals by others in places where no smoke ever reaches them If not sold sooner they are suffered to remain  there till the weather becomes warm They are packed in hogsheads with straw or oatmeal seeds and sent to London Lancaster and Liverpool in such quantities as to form one of the principal branches of export from the county  In neat hams of or lbs weight were sold as high as ½d per pound when green when cured in they were sold at ½d apound It has been found by experiment that hams lose twenty per cent of their weight in the curing  SECT  Rabbits  A few rabbits are kept in the neighbourhood of Brough and Orton and there is a small warren in Raven∣stonedale but it is rare to see them in any other part of Westmoreland  SECT  Poultry  Considerable quantities of geese ducks and common dunghill fowls are reared in Westmoreland The two last are generally disposed of in the market towns in the county or carried to Lancaster but great numbers of the first are sold to drovers from Yorkshire  Turkeys are seldom reared here except in the farmyards of men of fortune  SECT  Pigeons  The few pigeons that are to be seen in Westmoreland belong generally to men of fortune When sold they often bring d apiece  SECT  Bees  Bees are common in Westmoreland but there is no∣thing worthy of remark in the way in which they are managed  CHAPTER XIV  RURAL OECONOMY  SECT  Labour Servants Labourers Hours of Labour  LABOUR is dearer in Westmoreland than it is in al∣most any of the counties either to the north or south of it This probably is owing to the great number of small land∣holders or  statesmen  abovementioned who doing the work upon their own estates with their own hands and those of their families are perhaps disinclined to labour for other people  Servants by the year  A hind may be hired by the year at twenty pounds a house a garden and a patch of ground to grow potatoes and an unmarried man at from ten to twelve guineas ayear and board and wash∣ing  By the day  The wages of an ordinary labourer are from s d to s d aday he begins to work be∣tween six and seven rests an hour at dinner and leaves it off between six and seven in the eveningThe la∣bourers on the highway from Shap to Kendall receive  s d a day for nine months in the year and s d aday for the other three months  By the month  On the large farms in the seasons of hay and harvest it is not unusual to hire labourers by the month of four weeks at the rate of l s d and victuals They breakfast on milkpottage and bread and cheese receive a pint of good beer in the forenoon and another in the afternoon they dine on meat boiled ba∣ked or roasted and potatoes or pudding sup on cold meat and have plenty of common beer to drink through the day They begin in the morning as soon as the corn is dry rest none but while at meals and continue as late as they can see to work Four men may cut tie and stook a customary acre in a day leaving a stubble from nine to fourteen inches in length  Cutting of corn per acre  When done by the piece the cutting of an acre by the sickle the scythe not being used in the reaping of any sort of grain may cost s and if the crop be very heavy s or even s d  Cutting of hay per acre  The price of mowing a cus∣tomary acre of grass varies from s d to s d and a man usually mows an acre in a day  Per day  When hired by the day a mower's wages may vary from s d to s d and victuals  Mason's wages  Masons in summer have from s d to s d aday or s d or s d and victuals and in winter d or d less At Millthrope a few are hired all the year at s d aday wet or dry When they do their work by the piece and furnish every thing they are paid s or s d a square yard for a wall of two feet in thickness built with lime if materials are furnish∣ed to their hand they are paid d or d ayard Se∣ven yards and a half in length of a dry stone wall five feet and a half in height cost s d or s d in build∣ing  Carpenter's wages  The wages of a carpenter or com∣mon country wright differ very little from those of a mason  Thresher  A farmer's own servants generally thresh out the corn When persons are hired for this purpose they receive about s for threshing a load of seven and a half bushels of oats and s d for that of barley and from d to d a boll of rye consisting of two Winches∣ter bushels  Miller  Farmers commonly have their meal made from oats of their own growing The miller receives d a∣load for drying the oats If they are good in quality a load of seven and a half bushels will yield pounds of meal besides paying the miller his toll for grinding which is guessed to be about four per cent Wheat is made into flour for d abushel Numberless streams rendering the precarious assistance of windmills unnecessary there is but one in the county and it is employed in grinding bark for the tanners at Kendall  Thatcher  A thatcher receives about s d aday and victuals or s d without victuals  Slater  Slating is measured by the rood of fortytwo and onefourth square yards and costs in the workman∣ship s or s a rood In the vicinity of the state quar∣ries the slater will find all materials and labour for s or s arood  Tailor  A tailor gets in some places d in others s aday and board  Mole catcher  The molehills are carefully spread in most parts of the county and the fields are cleared of moles at the rate of d an acre where they have not been catched before d an acre are paid the second year and a penny or three halfpence yearly thereafter  Maidservants by the year  In some farmers' families where they are hard worked maidservants receive l ayear  Their ordinary wages in other families maybe about l s or perhaps l When they do not change their service if strangers in the parish care is taken to vary their wages every six months to prevent them from acquiring a settlement to which they would be en∣titled were they hired for a year or were their wages to continue the same for that period  By the month  In haytime and harvest when hired for a month they get from s to s and board  By the day  When hired by the day in harvest and haytime they receive d or d and victuals or s d or s d without victuals At other season they are paid with d d or s aday Their times of en∣try and of leaving off work their hours of labour and of rest are very various  SECT  Provisions  It is not unusual to hear people exclaim against the en∣crease of luxury and the alteration that has taken place in the mode of living in their time The labourer lives as well now as the farmer did forty or fifty years ago the farmer as well as the man of small landed property and so on And is this in any respect to be regretted or is it not much better for them all But persons generally cry out most loudly against the rank immediately be∣neath them without recollecting that their own mode has been changed in nearly the same proportion as the one which they are so ready to condemn  Spencer's Travels  Fifty years ago the price of butchermeat at Martinmas was from ¼d to d a pound in Burton market and eighty beasts were sometimes slaughtered in a day and bought to be salted for winter provisions From that time except a few at Christmas and at Easter no cattle were killed  there till they were fattened upon the pastures in sum∣mer Farmers in those days seldom eat any butchermeat they lived on bread and butter and what other little matters the farm afforded Now labourers gene∣rally breakfast on that very ancient food pottage with the help of a little cheese and bread they dine on but∣chermeat and potatoes or pudding and sup on pota∣toes or pottage or bread and cheese  The bread generally eaten in the county is made from oatmeal Water and oatmeal are kneaded together in∣to a paste without any leaven this paste is rolled into a circular cake of about twenty inches in diameter and is placed upon a thin flat plate of iron called a  girdle  un∣der which a fire is put and the cake thus baked goes by the name of  clap  bread and is to be seen at almost every table in the county This very particular description of baking cakes may appear too minute or altogether un∣necessary and it owes its place here to the request of some persons of rank who wished to see it recorded somewhere The meal is mostly ground to such a degree of fineness that a measure of sixteen quarts will weigh sixteen pounds Farmers labourers and manufacturers usually have fif∣teen cakes made from sixteen pounds of meal and as many baked in a day as will serve their families for a month Such of the gentry as eat this sort of bread most of them now eating bread made from wheat have it baked much more frequently and also much thinner A labouring man will eat sixteen pounds of meal made into bread in a fortnight the price of sixteen pounds of meal is variable from s d to s d the medium is s which gives s aweek for each labourer for bread his cottage and his fuel cost at least as much more His wages for threequarters of ayear are s aweek and s aweek for the other quarter but making allowance for broken days s aweek may be considered as the full amount of  the price of his labour and indeed a good labourer may be hired by the year at that rate Hence there will re∣main s aweek for the labour of the man for the re∣mainder of his own sustenance the sustenance of his fa∣mily and the cloathing of them all  The difference in the price of provisions in a county so small as Westmoreland cannot be very great They are however somewhat cheaper in the north and cast parts than they are in the south parts which are more within the reach of the markets of Lancaster and Liver∣pool Beef in Kendall market in the month of Octo∣ber was sold at d or d apound and a choice cut at ½d in spring it often rises to d apound Mutton which in spring often rises to d apound was sold at d ½d or d Pork was sold at d or d As all the bull calves are carried to market veal is for the most part cheaper than the other kinds of butcher meat and yet in spring it is sometimes sold as high as d apound Potatoes brought s d a bushel or s d or s aload in spring they are often sold at nearly the double of these prices Oatmeal is bought in some places by a measure of sixteen quarts at a price which fluctuates from s d to s d in others by a peck of quarts which in summer was worth s Butter was sold from d to d apound in winter the price seldom rises above d a stone of lbs of ounces costs s d and a firkin of lbs neat from s to s Cheese in the country costs d a pound and new milk d aquart which in Kendall is contracted for all the year at ½ d  A turkey costs s d or s according to its size a goose s d or s or when sold by weight d apound a hen from d to d and a chicken from d to d Eggs fluctuate in their price from ½d to d or even to d adozen Ducks are sold from s d to s apair  teal at d apiece woodcocks at s or s abrace and pigeons from s to s adozen  Salmon catched in the Lune is sold from d to d apound that which is brought from Carlisle from d to s d Char are sold at about s adozen trouts at d apound mussels at d or d aquart flounders from d to d a piece eels at d apound and rabbits with∣out the skins at s the pair Honey in the comb costs s apound  SECT  Fuel  The eastern parts of the county are supplied with coal from Stainmore Blackburton and Ingleton in Yorkshire but in other parts the most common fuel is peat  It is a question deserving the consideration of the Le∣gislature whether the duty of coal carried coastwise might not in certain districts be taken off with great ad∣vantage to the state The value of the improvements in agriculture and manufactures which would attend such a measure in counties ill supplied with fuel cannot be esti∣mated but it is presumed that it would very far exceed the loss sustained by the removal  CHAPTER XV  POLITICAL OECONOMY AS CONNECTED WITH OR AFFECTING AGRICULTURE  SECT  Roads  THE great roads leading through the county are kept in excellent repair by the sums collected at the turnpike  gates and when these prove insufficient by a portion of the labour of the parish or of the poundrate which may be levied in its aid  The parochial roads are made and kept in repair by six days labour of the parish and by a rate not exceeding sixpence in the pound which the surveyors may levy with the consent of the quartersessions some of these are to∣lerably good and others are annually improving Many of them scarcely exceed the smallest legal breadth allowed by statute which is eight feet  SECT  Canals  There is not at present any canal in the county but one of great magnitude has been projected from Wigan to Kendall It is now executing and when finished by in∣troducing the coal of Lancashire into the heart of West∣moreland will be of the greatest service to its manufac∣tures and agriculture If the coal can be afforded by the proprietors of the canal at a cheap rate the town of Ken∣dall may then emulate in the cloth manufacture Leeds itself Another canal from the bottom of Windermere water to the sea a distance of about miles is wanted if this should ever be cut the town of Ambleside would rise to considerable importance it would then be as well or better situated for trade than Kendall is now  SECT  Fairs  There is a great fair for cattle horses c at Broughhill on the th Septemberthere is a fair at Ambleside on the Wednesday after Whitsunday and on the th of Octoberat Appleby on Whitsun Eve Whitsun Mon∣day d Wednesday of June and Augustat Ken∣dall April and November and at Kirkby Lons∣dale on Holy Thursday and Decemberat KirkbyStephen  on the Monday before the th March Octo∣ber d th and that Millthrope on th May at Shap on the th Mayat Orton on the d May the Friday before Whitsunday and second Friday after Mi∣chaelmas and at Old Town on the th and th Octo∣ber  SECT  Weekly Markets  There are weekly markets at eight different towns in Westmoreland but the only one of any note is held at Kendall The next in point of consequence is held at Appleby the county town  SECT  Commerce  The commerce of Westmoreland is not yet so exten∣sive as to have any sensible effect upon its agriculture Its exports are coarse woollen cloth manufactured at Kendall stockings slates tanned hides gunpowder hoops charcoal hams wool sheep and cattle Its imports are chiefly merchant goods wheat oats with a little barley cattle and sheep  Millthrope is a very trifling port and the only one in the county  SECT  Manufactures  The manufactures of Westmoreland are not of much greater importance than its commerce They consist chiefly of coarse woollen cloth called  Kendall Cottons  pro∣perly it is said  coatings  gunpowder stockings silk and worsted waistcoat pieces flannels and tanned leather  Most beautiful stockings and carpets of strength and lustre little inferior to those of Persia are manufactured at Lowther for behoof of the Earl of Lonsdale A few of these have been sold from l to l but as they are  wrought solely for his own use or to be given in presents to his friends perhaps they do not enter with propriety into an enumeration of the manufactures of the county What is now the manufactory was originally a college but being only in its probationary state was discontinued by the late Lord Viscount Lonsdale The Earl of Selkirk and the late Duke of Athol were educated here and an ashtree planted by his Lordship is still pointed out  SECT  Poor  Westmoreland not being a manufacturing county and landed property being there in general minutely divided the number of poor who apply for parochial aid is com∣paratively small The poor rates in the parish of Kendall are s d in the pound of the actual rent which is very near four times the average of the rate throughout the county Were it not unfair to draw a general conclusion from one example it might be inferred that the poor are most numerous in manufacturing counties and towns  SECT  Population  The inhabitants of Kendall were found by an actual enumeration in to amount to and the whole population of the county has been estimated at or thousand As the number of births considerably exceeds the number of burials many of the inhabitants must migrate to other counties  CHAPTER XVI  OBSTACLES TO IMPROVEMENT  THE most material of these are customary tenures where the fines are arbitrary or according to the improv∣ed value of the estate where the wood is the property of the lord and where a lease for longer than three years is not valid without his consent want of leases or very short leases and the collection of the tithes in kind  CHAPTER XVII  MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS  SECT  Weights and Measures  GREAT diversity of weights and measures prevails in Westmoreland as is the case in almost every county in Great Britain The pound consists of or ounces and the stone of or pounds There is a Winchester bushel a customary bushel equal to three of these a bushel of two bushels for the sale of potatoes near Appleby and one of two and a half for that of barley Rye is sold by the boll of two bushels and potatoes by the load of four bushels and a half heaped or more gen∣erally  a bag which holds seven and one half bushels is filled and sold for a load of potatoes  There is the statute acre of square yards the cus∣tomary acre of raised from the perch of six and one half yards and a third acre on the borders of Lancashire raised from the perch of seven yards containing be∣ing the same as the Irish plantation acre  SECT  Supply of London  London is not much indebted to this county for its articles of consumption The little it receives from hence consists chiefly of butter bacon hams and excellent blue slates which form a cover for some of the best houses in the capital It is probable that after being fattened in the southern counties some of its cattle and sheep reach Smithfield market  CONCLUSION  Means of Improvement and the Measures calculated for that purpose  SECT  Arable Lands  CLOVER In many counties of England the land is sown with grass seeds and left to lie for some years with a view to refresh and enable it to bear crops of corn but in Westmoreland it is ploughed and sown with corn in or∣der to prepare it for grass When it hath been cropped for three years and it is judged that the soil is sufficient∣ly  reduced and that the moss is quite destroyed the land is left to itself to grass over The first crop of hay is ne∣ver either weighty or good in quality the second is ge∣nerally very superior in both these respects to the first and so favourable are the climate and the soil to the growth of grass that the third crop is often so abundant as to be let for two or three pounds per acre and of a quality so excellent that in several places cattle are fat∣tened upon it in Winter for the markets of Lancaster and Liverpool But even these best crops are far inferior in point of value to those that would be produced by the same fields were their natural aptitude to grow grass di∣rected to the production of clover and ryegrass The prejudice that prevails almost universally in Westmore∣land against these artificial plants is a great obstacle to the improvement of the husbandry of the county and must be overcome before the arable lands can be brought to that degree of cultivation of which they are susceptible  It is said that hay made of clover and ryegrass is much coarser than that which is made of the natural grasses and that these artificial plants giving place to the natural ones perish at the end of two or three years and there∣fore ought never to be sown at all  The opinion is conceived to be ill founded which holds that hay made of sown grasses is bad in quality long ex∣perience and continued practice having shown that horses are very fond of such hay and that when even fed upon it alone they are able to do a great deal of hard work It can hardly be seriously asserted that hay made of the trash produced spontaneously by the land the two first years after it has been cropped with corn is better than hay made of clover and ryegrass The artificial grasses sel∣dom or never perish at once at the end of either the se∣cond or third year they disappear gradually making room for the natural herbage to occupy their place which  it is imagined it would be found upon trial to do with much more profit to the farmer than would have accrued to him by managing his lands in the ordinary way for the superior value of the hay the first two years would far more than reimburse him for the expence of the grass seeds and he might still have his favourite natural hay after these had died entirely out  This is stated upon the supposition that the field was to be allowed to lie eight or ten years in grass as is the cus∣tom at present If it were to be broken up at the end of the first or second year it would be sound in good con∣dition for bearing a crop of corn the roots of clover it is well known being a great improver of the soil but this way of cropping the lands will enter with more propriety into that part where an alteration of the present course will be suggested  In the year Mr Smith at Henridding in the parish of Burton sowed a close containing exactly two acres and a half Lancashire measure with lbs of red clover seed amongst a crop of barley for which the land had been slightly manured after fallow wheat This field is in Lancashire but being situated within an hundred yards of the county of Westmoreland it may be mentioned here without impropriety and it is selected merely because the particulars respecting it are better known to the writer of this Report than those in regard to any field of clover in the county that was the object of his survey It was mown in the month of July and it then yielded a crop of twentytwo singlehorse cartloads of hay It was mown a second time in September and produced eighteen of the same cartloads It was depastured with nine sheep from the time the last crop was carried off till the beginning of November and the foggage was then tol∣erably good Let the most strenuous advocates for natural grass say whether they ever had a crop so valu∣able  Where the land is intended to be depastured the ar∣gument will apply with treble force and the decided pre∣ference given by cattle of all kinds to the green herbage of the artificial over that of the natural grass ought to remove every doubt from the minds even of those who are the most strongly prepossessed in favour of the present practice  In front of Carus Wilson Esq's new house near Kirk∣by Lonsdale there lies a field of sixteen acres which was sown with grass seeds amongst a crop of barley in the year It was depastured in and maintained  three times  more stock than he would have expected it to main∣tain had it been left to itself in the ordinary way Far∣mers the most prejudiced against sown grasses saw and confessed the force of the experiment and it is not to be doubted will follow an example which tends so materially to promote their interest  The cultivation of clover is perhaps the greatest im∣provement in the art of farming which has been disco∣vered in modern times and it is equally matter of regret and of surprise that what is at once so easy and so profit∣able is not yet become universal and it furnishes a strong instance of the difficulty with which old habits and pre∣judices are rooted out even when selfinterest is concern∣ed in their extirpation  Turnips  The climate and soil of the vallies of West∣moreland are well suited to the cultivation of turnips which must be carried on to a considerable extent before the agriculture of the county can be improved in any material degree Experience has shown that this crop and the mode of husbandry usually connected with it are able not only to fertilise particular farms but even to improve whole counties The most profitable and the least troublesome way of disposing of this crop is to fatten sheep with it A customary acre of turnips if the crop  is good will feed twentyfive sheep weighing sixteen pounds a quarter from st November to st April even supposing the sheep made no advance in these five months the very encrease of the price of the mutton from d to ½d or d a pound would bring a profit to the farmer as considerable as it is easily calculated When to this there is added the value of what they would gain in point of weight the profit it is hoped will appear to be so great as to make the desire to grow turnips irresistible and quickly to increase the quantity an hundredfold beyond what it is at present  Where the land is very dry the sheep may be penned upon a small part of the field of turnips and shifted to another as those in the first part are eaten up but if there is a field of grass near at hand the superior im∣provement of the sheep will pay for the labour of car∣rying the turnips to be eaten on that field where they will lie dry and clean and where the turnips will be less trampled on and abused  Rotation of Crops  It is the general opinion of farmers in Westmoreland that their lands are better suited for grass than for bearing crops of corn and they are plough∣ed for three or four years not with an expectation that the corn will be more profitable than the grass but in order to renovate them for grass and to destroy the moss which in a few years overruns all their ley grounds but there are some who are persuaded that the neat profits of the three or four years the lands are under crop usually exceed the profits of any other three or four years while the same lands lie in grass and they think that their fer∣tility for the production of either grass or corn would be injured by ploughing for a longer term or after shorter intervals of rest  Whether the lands under the present system are most profitable to the farmer when they are in corn or in grass  it is not necessary now to enquire because with all due deference to the general practice and opinion of a whole county it is presumed that a mode of husbandry and a succession of crops may be pointed out which upon trial would be found far more profitable than those at present followed  The uniting what may be called the Clover and the Turnip Husbandry is the best method hitherto discovered of keeping dry lands in a state of continual fertility and for this the light and friable soil of the vallies of West∣moreland is well calculated Instead of the common ro∣tation of oats barley and oats again and then leaving the land to grass over of itself the following course of crops might be introduced with advantage both to the public and the individual When an old close of good land is broken up it should be sown with oats as is done at present after the oats it should be manured and sown with turnips in drills thirty inches asunder so as to admit of being horsehoed next with barley or oats and always with grass seeds at the rate of about sixteen pounds of clover and a Winchester bushel of ryegrass to the statute acre If it is intended to pasture the field the grass seeds can hardly be sown too thick if it is to be made into hay the quantity of seeds abovementioned will be found am∣ply sufficient The first year's crop of grass may be mown twice or after the first cutting it may be eaten by fattening cattle or it may be eaten by sheep till the be∣ginning of June saved after that and mown in August and it will still produce a valuable crop of foggage or af∣termath It should be depastured with cattle or sheep the second year and the third year likewise if it shall be thought proper to keep the field so long in grass  This course would preserve the land in a state of per∣petual  health and vigour  did it not taking pleasure in va∣riety dislike a too frequent repetition of the same crops  After some rounds it will be proper to encrease the quan∣tity of clover seed and at last to bring it seldomer into succession for if too often sown it will be rejected entire∣ly When this is apprehended the course may be varied or lengthened by the introduction of a crop of pease or of drilled beans where the land is deep and moist and wheat after either of these or after a clean Summerfallow or by leaving the land some years longer in grass than usual  When it shall be proved and known that potatoes are a cheap and nourishing food for horses the demand for that valuable root will become nearly as unbounded as that for turnips is and even although they exhaust the land they may then be introduced into the course with much advantage to the farmer  It is not pretended that the rotation of crops here re∣commended would suit all the arable lands of Westmore∣land but it is believed that on a very large proportion of them it might be followed with a certainty of success The cold wet stiff soils should be Summerfallowed in∣stead of being cropped with turnips wheat should be sown after the fallow and clover or oats and then clo∣ver after the wheat but it is impossible and were it possible it would be improper in a work of this general nature to mention how all the varieties of soil should be treated and to descend to the minutiae of ploughing and sowing and ten thousand little matters that continually de∣mand the farmer's attention and that are always varying with the weather In these his own ingenuity must assist him and there all his ingenuity will be necessary for his art though apparently easy is attended with a thousand difficulties  SECT  Waftes  There is room for great improvement in the manage∣ment of sheep as well upon private estates as upon the  commons but while these last continue in their present deplorable state it would be in vain to attempt any altera∣tion upon their stocks The case however is different with store farms properly so called where the breed or treatment of the sheep differs very little from that of those upon commons although there can be no reasonable doubt of their being well adapted to the keeping a far more profitable sort than is to be found there at present There is no weight whatever in the argument which has been often used against the introduction of such a breed from the scarcity of food and the coldness of the climate the British Wool Society having proved that  the finest breeds of Spain or of England will thrive on the wil∣dest of the Cheviot hills and that very finewoolled breeds may be propagated on the most mountainous di∣stricts of Scotland  There are numbers of sheep at the Feroe islands which lie in latitude and even in Iceland part of which is beyond the Arctic circle they are to be found in great abundance on every farm and there nature sports in a great superfluity of horns as if the scanty pittance of food which the animal can pick up in that bleak and frozen climate were more than suffi∣cient for the support of the carcase and the fleece  The extensive and valuable commons of Westmore∣land loudly demand the interposition of the legislature in a country that boasts of attention to its interest Some immediate alteration in their state whether by division or by sale cannot be too eagerly pursued nor too strongly inculcated nor can it be too generally made known that there are many wealthy people living near some of the best commons in the county which is a point of great importance who do not think it worth while to avail themselves of their right of pasturage  Every person sees the necessity of some material change with regard to the commons and now that thinking men  are turning their attention to this important subject there is no doubt that some plan will be fallen upon by which both the public and the individual may reap the full benefit of these at present dreary wastes which are a reproach and disgrace to the nation But it cannot be expected that any measure however wise or any propo∣sal however advantageous can meet with universal appro∣bation It will probably be reprobated by some whose prejudices it will alarm and with whose little interests it may be supposed to clash Till something of greater con∣sequence be accomplished the reduction of the stint where such is already established or the establishment of a moderate stint upon commons that are perfectly free ought not to be delayed one hour for at present they are of little if of any use either to those having a right of commonage or to the nation at large  A general inclosurebill for the whole kingdom would save the expence of separate applications to parliament for the division of particular commons but there are many barren and rocky commons that would not be in any wise benefited by inclosure and although the in∣terests of a few individuals ought to give way to those of the community there are numerous instances where both would be injured by the operation of such a bill for it would at once be ruinous to many proprietors to be oblig∣ed to inclose each his share often at an expence greater not only than the value of that share but in some instan∣ces greater than the value of the feesimple of that farm or estate in right of which he claims and prejudicial to the public by interrupting the sheepwalks upon the mountainous districts which ought to be as free and open as possible  The principal part of the stock kept upon the com∣mons consists of sheep either of the breed of the county or brought from Scotland The ewes are wintered in  the inclosures and sent back to the commons in April the wedder hoggrels are always wintered the first year on the low grounds at the expence of s a head are sent back to the commons about the same time with the ewes and remain there till they are sold to the grazier They may fetch at an average s a piece add to this the value of the wool and s may be about the sum received for every wedder sheep that arrives at the age of four years and a half  Scotch hogs are bought at about s d a piece and are kept two years upon the commons when they may be worth s d or s add to this the price of three fleeces of wool and the whole sum received for every sheep delivered may be about s from this subtract the original price two years interest of the money expence of herding for the first two months of thrice washing and clipping of twice salving the value of the risk of bad payment from the drover or grazier the loss by straying and what is often much more considerable by death and say what profit remains  It has been computed that one third of all the sheep in Westmoreland died in Great calamities are often exaggerated though no doubt the loss must have been prodigious when it was estimated so high  Twenty shillings are reckoned an ordinary profit for keeping a Scotch beast a year subtract from this the price of wintering on the low grounds and in the strawyard interest of the cost value of the risk of drovers loss by death from fatigue estimated at ½ per cent by disease and now and then by one tumbling into a peat∣moss and say what advantage arises from this adven∣ture  Seven shillings and sixpence are thought an ordinary profit for keeping a little Scotch beast on a common from May to October make the same deductions as in the for∣mer  article with the exception of the value of the Win∣ter's keeping and see how little remains for the rent of the land  It is not possible to place this matter in a more striking point of view than by repeating that on several commons the liberty of keeping an ox or ten sheep for a whole year may be hired for  sixpence  Improvement of Wastes by Liming  Great portions of many of these might be improved at a small expence by the application of lime which is found in most parts of the county and might be cultivated with the certainty of great advantage When ploughed great care ought to be taken to adopt a proper succession of crops and to lay the lands down with grass seeds in a very few years because when exhausted by overcropping they are reduced to a worse state than they were in before and there is no way yet discovered of preparing lands for a repetition of a hearty dose of lime  By Paring and Burning  Many of the level moory parts might be converted into arable lands by paring and burning which are well understood by several persons in the county and have been practised with more or less success on some private estates  By Planting  There are many thousands of acres ut∣terly incapable of cultivation by the plough and in the paper prefixed the Bishop of Landaff has shown in a manner equally ingenious and novel with what advan∣tage these might be covered with wood It is well known that trees flourish with the greatest vigour on soils far more barren and in climates much colder than that of Westmoreland There are stately oaks at Niagara which though not in a high latitude experience a degree of cold in Winter far beyond what is ever felt in this coun∣try On the western coast of America in latitude ° the very summits of the hills are covered with wood and  there is plenty of trees at Norton's Sound in latitude ° ″ and timber for the use of ships in the British navy has been cut even at Kamtschatka the very end of the earth where the soil is barren in the extreme and covered with Summer snow and where the Winters are rigorous beyond the conception of an inhabitant of Europe  That Westmoreland has been a wooded county is evident from trees found in mosses on the highest hills and statutes and regulations made long after the Conquest since which time the climate has not been changed for the worse are full of the mention of forests and chaces and parks and mastage and pannage and vert and venison and greenhue and regarders and foresters and verderors and an hundred other names and titles respecting the pre∣servation of the woods and the game  The valuable plantations at Lowtherhall the seat of the Earl of Lonsdale show how well calculated the soil and climate of Westmoreland still are for the growth of timber which it cannot be questioned would thrive over all the county as well now as it did five hundred years ago The profits of planting are so distant and so few persons looking eighty or an hundred years beyond the present day are willing to sacrifice a paltry interest for the sake of a remote posterity that perhaps it may be necessary for Government to encourage by premiums what in the end would turn out so greatly to the advantage of the com∣munity These might be distributed with much propri∣ety by the Board of Agriculture whose income seems to be far too moderate for the support of so important an establishment the objects of whose superintendence are innumerable and the field of whose operations is exten∣sive as the island itself  To the north of Shap lies a very extensive common called the Scars where between two and three thousand  acres of level white land in a state of nature offend the eye of every traveller and cry aloud for improvement the means of which it contains in immense quantities of lime∣stone upon its very surface It is more than twenty years since an act of parliament was obtained for a division of this common and that it has not been carried into execu∣tion is the more to be regretted as in the opinion of very judicious persons in the neighbourhood a large portion of it might be easily made as valuable as the little closes of Shap which are let from s to s an acre  On the south of Shap lies another common called the Fells which is in general incapable of cultivation by the plough but it is not ill suited to the maintenance of sheep and the remains of the celebrated  Shapthorn  near the road to Orton show that plantations would succeed even on those places of it which are most exposed  Near the mouth of the river Kent there is a marsh of considerable extent common to Haversham and Mill∣thrope and like all the other commons in Westmoreland greatly overstocked It would not be difficult to bank off the sea from this marsh and to convert it into corn fields but if this were thought not adviseable its value might be instantly more than doubled by the establishment of a moderate stint or still farther increased by a division  Part of Crosby common might be easily converted into arable and good pasture land and two clumps of trees of a considerable size prove that its worst parts might be planted with success  From Crosby and Meaburn a dry level common ex∣tends to within three miles of Appleby It is covered with heath and is capable of various modes of improve∣ment  The commons of Knock Newbigging KirkbyThore and Marton lie contiguous and form a tract of several thousands of acres dry soft and improveable A great  part of these is covered with strong brackens and is su∣perior in quality to the soil of many farms in the neigh∣bourhood and well suited to the cultivation of turnips and clover  This specimen of the commons in Westmoreland will it is hoped be deemed sufficient for it would be tedious and painful to enumerate them all It is difficult to be∣hold the desolate state in which they lie without surprise at the nation having so long delayed taking measures for their improvement The wastes and commons in this county and throughout England in general have been elegantly called  a public treasure in the hands of private persons  it is to be hoped that the time is not very dis∣tant when this important treasure shall be opened and its contents shall prove equally beneficial to the individual and to the public at large  It is impossible to look forward without emotion to that day when these neglected wastes shall have received that degree of improvement of which they are suscepti∣ble when they shall wave with valuable crops of corn bleat with profitable flocks or be clothed with stately tim∣ber when every little rill shall be turned out of its na∣tural course to fertilise the neighbouring plain and when there may be seen in every corner the industrious hus∣bandman at once enriching himself and advantaging the community in a manner the most substantial  Contemplating the matter in this view who but must exclaim what a noble field for exertion What a source of national wealth yet in store  More certain than the profits of commerce more permanent than those of manufactures  Such are the reflections and observations that occurred in a Survey of the state of the stock and husbandry in the county of Westmoreland made in the months of October and November at the request of the newly establish∣ed  Board of Agriculture What success has attended the attempt to place this important matter in a just light o∣thers will judge but it will be doing no more than jus∣tice to admit that no pains have been spared in the exe∣cution of this task which others might have performed with more ability but not with greater alacrity or zeal  It is impossible to conclude this Report without men∣tioning to the Board the very flattering manner in which the person commissioned by them to make this Survey was received by all ranks and descriptions of persons in the county of Westmoreland Every possible aid was given by the two respectable Members of the Board resi∣dent in the county The other individuals who assisted him are too numerous to be discriminated but the wri∣ter of this paper will ever remember their very polite at∣tention with gratitude and his short residence in that part of the kingdom with peculiar feelings of pleasure and respect  What gratitude is due to HIM who first called the at∣tention of the nation to its most important interests and whose unremitted efforts are directed to promote the good of his country How well does He deserve and what a sure road has He chosen to immortal fame that will sur∣vive the ravages of time and smile at the fleeting celebrity of martial atchievements  ADDENDA  TO the note page the reader is desired to add The result of this experiment was that in the harvest of such parts of the wheat the seed of which was pickled and limed as well as that which was pickled and not limed was nearly free from smut but that which was neither pickled nor limed had smutted ears in a∣bundance at least a hundred times more than the other it may be proper to observe the seed was purposely taken with a few balls of smut in itThis experiment is decisively in favour of steeping in chamberlye  The following addition is also desired to be made at the bottom of page to the paragraph on drilling ending "on moist soils"We have lately found it most convenient to yoke two horses to the drill one going in each furrow and to drill seven rows upon a ridge of to inches wide when the intervals are ½ or inches and inches wide when the intervals are inches  With the horses yoked in this manner in a fiverow drill ten rows may be sown upon ridges ¾ feet wide leaving a space on the top of the ridge about inches wide for one of the horses to travel on this is supposing the intervals inches wide but if the intervals be ½ inches then the ridges may be ¾ feet wideA light harrow is fixed to the drill to cover in the seed  DIRECTIONS TO THE BINDER  Map of Northumberland to face the Title Page  Plate st Implements Page  Plate d Turnip Drill Page  Plate d Corn Drill Page
