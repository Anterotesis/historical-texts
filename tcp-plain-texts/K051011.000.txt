 THE TRAGEDY OF Chrononhotonthologos BEING The most Tragical Tragedy that ever was Tragediz'd by any Company of TRAGEDIANS  Written by BENJAMIN BOUNCE  Esq  Qui capit ille facit  LONDON Printed for  J Shuckburgh  and  L Gilliver  in  FleetStreet    J Jackson  in  PallMall  and sold by  A Dodd  without  TempleBar  and  F Nutt  at the  RoyalExchange  Price Six Pence  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr W MILLS  TO Night our comic MUSE the Buskin wears  And gives her self no small Romantic Airs  Struts in Heroics and in pompous Verse  Does the minutest Incidents rehearse  In Ridicule's strict Retrospect displays  The Poetasters of these modern Days  When the big bellowing Bombast rends our Ears  Which stript of Sound quite void of Sense appears  Or when the Fiddle Faddle Numbers flow  Serenely dull Elaborately low  Either Extreme when vain Pretenders take  The Actor suffers for the Author's sake  The quite tir'd Audience lose whole Hours yet pay  To go unpleas'd and unimprov'd away  This being our Scheme we hope you will excuse  The wild Excursion of the wanton Muse  Who out of Frolic wears a mimic Mask  And sets herself so whimsical a Task  'Tis meant to please but if it should offend

Thunder of Artillery  He sleeps Supine amidst the Din of War  And yet 'tis not definitively Sleep  Rather a kind of Doze a waking Slumber  That sheds a Stupefaction o'er his Senses  For now He nods
