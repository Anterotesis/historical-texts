 THE QUESTION c c  THE QUESTION AS IT STOOD IN  MARCH    "Cominciansi le guerre quando altri vuole ma non quando altri vuole "fi finiscono"  MACCHIAVELLI  LONDON  Printed for R FAULDER New Bond Street H D SYMONDS Paternoster Row and Messrs RICHARDSONS Royal Exchange  The QUESTION As it stood in MARCH  Cominciansi le guerre quando altri vuole ma non quando altri vuole fi finisicono  MACCHIAVELLI  FOR all the useful and honourable purposes of national power many circumstances contributed to give us the lead of Europe while the French revolution was depending In the year we might have dictated a pacification to the contending parties or if that failed a wellordered and a wellarmed neutrality would have kept us in peace The riches of the world would have flowed into this island not only from the sources of its own commerce improving and undisturbed but even from the calamities of other nations The peculiar advantages of that fortunate situation were too obvious to be mistaken In departing from it the minister could have no justification but direct and irresistible necessity To preserve such advantages punctilios and formalities should have been disregarded and every disposition to explain and accommodate any serious cause of offence should have been accepted and encouraged The guilt of the war if it was voluntary is to be measured as all criminal actions are by its effects When things are well it is the business and duty of the executive government to keep them so Great and certain possession is not to be hazarded for precarious acquisition much less are safety and happiness to be a subject of experiment The actual state  of England is the result of other maxims The difficulties of the country have evidently grown with its exertions and now we are called upon for efforts and contributions which indicate a crisis of imminent danger to be averted by the wisdom or repelled by the vigour of the present Administration Whether the conduct and successes of the war furnish a rational ground of confidence in their abilities is a question open to the understanding of all men That which touches their integrity is not so easily determined nor by the same sort of evidence But it is if possible more important and cannot be reviewed too often or canvassed too minutely Under  any  administration the spirit of the people is sufficient to repel and defeat a direct attack If it were possible for the enemy to land in force a great deal of transitory mischief would ensue but sooner or later they must perish in the attempt This is not by any means the most discouraging view of our situation A war prolonged without action or enterprise an invasion threatened and suspended and the expectation of it continually hanging over us are the surest and for the enemy themselves the safest instruments to accomplish the ruin of England In the nature of things this plan if they adhere to it cannot fail To talk of expecting moderation and candour from a government provoked by injury and incensed by insults to call them traitors and assassins and in the same breath to reproach them with arrogance and treachery as if the character and the qualities were incompatible is mere folly and impertinence The serious question is not whether these people are good or bad but by what means we are ever to be at peace with them Then comes the importance of an inquiry into the principles and proceedings of our own government as far as that of France has been affected by them If the result of it should lead to a conclusion morally  certain that the Directory will never treat with them but as with rancorous enemies and as the wilful authors of all the calamities of France it follows of necessity that other men ought to be tried unless it be contended that the removal of such persons is too great a price to pay for the salvation of the country  His Majesty's ministers affirm that in the war was just and necessary on the part of Great Britain and that in and their endeavours to make peace and to renew the intercourse with France were serious and sincere On the other side it is asserted that both these propositions may be false but that both of them cannot be true unless it can be proved that in the character of the war was altered by events which made the continuance of it on its original principles unjust and unnecessary The issue to be tried is whether the ministry did all they could at first to avoid the war and at last to put an end to it  On the th of June Monsieur Chauvelin in the name of Louis the Sixteenth invited his Majesty to  find some means to put a stop to the progress of a confederacy against France which threatened the peace the liberty and the happiness of Europe  In return to this amicable appeal to his Majesty's wisdom friendship and good faith he was informed that  His Majesty thought that in the existing circumstances of the war then begun the interposition of his councils or of his good offices could be of no use unless it was desired by  all  the parties concerned  The pretence is weak and insufficient but it proves the disposition When  all  the parties in a war agree to desire the interposition of a neutral power no friendly offices are wanted to bring them back to a pacific temperPeace is almost as good as made when  all  the contending parties are  disposed to desire it The obvious duty of a common friend the true policy of a generous or even of a prudent government is to employ its good offices and to exert its influence with those powers which may be less inclined to views of moderation to encourage and promote a pacific disposition and to favour that party which seems the readiest to listen to reasonable overtures and to make concessions for the benefit of general accommodation Such were the wise and honourable duties of England when his Majesty's mediation was solicited and refused  On the th of December Lord Grenville charged the French Convention with having passed a decree  calculated to encourage discord and revolt in every country  The French ministry denied and disclaimed the sense attributed to the decree and in the strongest terms disavowed any intention on the part of France to act on the principles imputed to that government When no act has been done and when nothing but a supposed principle or general disposition is complained of an express disavowal of such principle and denial of such intention ought to be accepted because it is all that the case admits of A minister who had seriously meant to preserve peace would have allowed them to know their own meaning even tho' he had distrusted their sincerity Instead of that he says drily  I cannot conceal from you that I have found nothing satisfactory in the result of your note and we shall continue our preparations  On the st December he tells Monsieur Chauvelin who had taken the style of  Minister Plenipotentiary of France  that his letters of credence were from the Most Christian King and that he could not be admitted to treat with the King's Ministers in the quality he had assumed  On the th of January Monsieur Chauvelin  appears to have addressed two memorials to Lord Grenville In the first he complains and demonstrates beyond all possibility of reply that the Alien Bill moved by His Majesty's Ministers and depending in Parliament and not making any exception in favour of France was a direct violation of the Commercial treaty concluded in by which it was stipulated  that the subjects and inhabitants of the two countries should have liberty to pass and repass freely and securely without licence or passport  c and that this proposed law under a general term of designation was principally directed against the French  In the second he represents that ships freighted with corn for France were stopt by order of Government and that when the prohibition was taken off generally as far as regarded  foreign  wheat it was still enforced against France and against France alone These complaints were supported by arguments in detail which it would have been difficult to answer in the same form but that which cannot easily be answered may very easily be slighted Lord Grenville returns the first of these memorials in a note of six lines  as totally inadmissible  Why Because Monsieur Chauvelin assumes a character which is not acknowledged To the substance of the second memorial he returns no answer at all Why First  because it had been thought preferable in France  to bring forward difficulties of form  Secondly  because he did not know in what character Monsieur Chauvelin addressed him  An objection to a diplomatic character when there is no doubt of the authority is a difficulty of form and nothing else and very unfit to be insisted on in so great and grave a question as that of involving two nations in the miseries of war The language of power may be laconic and they who cannot resist must submit to it But such  answers between equals are not to be endured The noble Lord has been taught to lengthen his monosyllables The provisions of the Alien Bill are in direct and evident contradiction to the Commercial Treaty Do His Majesty's Ministers mean to say that a treaty concluded by the Crown may be annulled by a subsequent Act of Parliament If it may in the first place no foreign power is safe in treating with the Crown and then what right have we to deny that the French Directory may be restrained by a previous act of their constitution from making particular concessions or to affirm as we have done  that there existed a  droit public  in Europe paramount to any  droit public  they might think proper to establish in their own dominions  Lord Malmesbury December    On the th of January Lord Grenville positively refused to receive his new credentials from the Republic and on the th sent him an order to quit the kingdom  Very early in that year the French were humbled by a variety of reverses and disasters and ready to submit to any terms for an accommodation with England On the th of February another Minister Plenipotentiary Monsieur Maret arrived in England It is not certain that his offers and submissions were listened to at all but it was said that they were rejected as incompatible with the honour and dignity of the English nation to accept and on the th of March he was ordered to quit the kingdom in three days In the beginning of April Monsieur le Brun Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to Lord Grenville to desire a passport for a person vested with full powers to terminate all differences with Great Britain Of this request no sort of notice was taken Shortsighted pride makes no  provision for the returning days of humiliation and repentance When pacific offers and solicitations are neglected or answered only with formalities you may be sure that the cavillers have taken their resolution The motives and the arguments  follow  the inclination  In December the French having got possession of the greater part of Flanders resolved to send some of their vessels up the Scheldt to attack Antwerp How this act was received by the British Government is fresh in the memory of all men If the French had sent a fleet into the Thames the outcry raised against them could not have been more violent Nobody could endure it but the Dutch themselves who showed no sign of life and were very unwilling that we should meddle with their affairs They had no anxiety about the navigation of the Scheldt What they really dreaded was our interposition and assistance We forced it upon them we drove them into the war and we accomplished their destruction  But it was said that the real sources of the war lay deeper than in any offences or provocation of this sort that other causes of difference might have been accommodated but that French principles were never to be tolerated or forgiven much less to be admitted amongst us While all manner of topics and pretences were taken in aid of the main argument the avowed predominant purpose of the war was to resist the propagation of  principles destructive of all order and society  and above all things to prevent then introduction into England On this ground the war was uniformly maintained to be what Ministers called just and necessarya common technical character equally and invariably given by all parties to all wars of their own making War is not to be undertaken or defended on general principles of justice much less of expediency One  nation has no jurisdiction over another In making war necessity and nothing else constitutes justice The opprobrious language with which this policy was enforced is neither possible to be forgotten nor very likely to be forgiven by the French Even to this hour it is not abandoned In the speeches of the King's principal Ministers and of all their adherents the French Government under every change it has experienced was and is a collection of robbers traitors and assassins incapable of maintaining the relations of peace and amity with their neighbours and therefore properly the objects of vengeance and extermination rather than of legitimate war Such language though it were true would do no credit to the wisdom of those who use it A prudent Minister a statesman with any experience of the uncertainty of human affairs should have supposed the possibility of a reverse and not have shut the door against future reconciliation Neither is it honourable or even safe for a great nation to treat at all with impious robbers parricides and assassins But while Ministers gave way to this imprudent passion and indulged themselves in such rash and useless invectives is it quite clear that they were in earnest Did they then do they now believe that the same Government to which they have repeatedly offered a project of  perpetual peace of sincere and constant friendship of reciprocal amity and intercourse  was nothing but a faithless band of traitors and murderers Has there been any change in the principles of these people Is it true that they have asked pardon of God and man for their manifold offences If not why are their principles less dangerous  now  when they are crowned and confirmed by success when even we acknowledge that they have at last produced a Government fit for the King of Great Britain to treat with than they were in The parties  and the principles were the same Lord Malmesbury was not instructed to object to the one or to protest against the other Both the negotiations broke off on questions of profit and loss not on principles In all the dispatches of the two embassies there is not a single word about morality or religion nor even of that obnoxious doctrine which was to occasion revolt and disorder in every country If the French would have relinquished Flanders in or the Cape and Ceylon in we should have he  rd no more of their morals or their crimes By offering to compound with such principles and to unite with such parties the Minister confesses that their crimes and their principles had little or no concern in the real motives and objects of the war In fact it soon appeared that the purpose of the alliance was to dismember France while the Allies talked of nothing but morality and religion  The last and not the least insisted on among the charges against the French was that they declared war first With a willing audience any nonsense is as good as any argument A declaration of war is not an act of aggression It rather supposes an antecedent injury received and satisfaction demanded and refused Whether well founded or not it assumes the character of frankness and magnanimity by announcing the hostility it intends and putting the enemy on his defence If our ground was good if the war on our side was just at any time it was so before February and our declaration should have preceded theirs In the conduct of great affairs the advantages of cunning are very inconsiderable By provoking a challenge or driving your opponent to break the peace you may possibly have the law on your side in a private quarrel Between nations this is not policy but deceit and a poor deceit too that deceives nobody  The real aggressor is he who refuses satisfaction and forces his adversary to assault him  On these grounds the King's Ministers affirmed and continue to affirm that the war was just and necessary They do not contend that the character of the French Government is improved or that the war was less just and necessary in or than it was originally Nevertheless they have offered to negotiate and as they say with a sincere intention to make peace We are then to consider what measures they took to insure success to the negotiation and for what ostensible reasons they broke it off The validity of the second will throw a light on the sincerity of the first The proposition to be believed is that the object which they had most at heart in and was to establish  a sincere and constant friendship and a reciprocal intercourse  in the terms of Lord Grenville's project with an abandoned crew with  the same individual junto of assassins  Mr Burke's Third Letter  who were and are incapable of maintaining the relations of peace and amity with any body It would be useless now to look back to the particulars of Lord Malmesbury's first embassy except to observe that by yielding Belgium of which the French were in poss  ssion and which it was impossible for us to wrest out of their hands we might have had a tolerable peace in December and saved the superfluous expence and distress of two campaigns at least with all their possible consequences The language of our Government on that subject is never to be forgotten On the th of December Lord Malmesbury says to Monsieur de la Croix  I should not deal fairly with you if I hesitated to declare in the  outset  of our negotiation that on  this  point you must entertain no expectation that his Majesty  will relax or  ever  consent to see the Netherlands remain a part of France  If the Minister's disposition to peace had been sincere he would not have made Belgium an insurmountable objection to it He knew the resolution of the French by their positive answer to Mr Wickham some months before He knew that without giving up Flanders it was in vain to negotiate and that peace was not to be had He knew also or he ought to have known that Austria would not support him in his pretension to carry this point In December Lord Malmesbury was instructed to make the cession of Belgium an indispensable condition of any treaty with France In April the preliminaries were signed at Leoben and Belgium relinquished by the Emperor For this pretended object however Mr Pitt continues the war and then  he  also gives it up with all possible indifference How is any principle or profession of Government to be depended on when after so solemn a declaration in the King's name we see another negotiation solicited in less than six months and not a word said of this famous  sine quâ non  from which his Majesty would  never  relax The intervening pacification between France and the Emperor will not account for so rapid a change in the fundamental system professed by our Cabinet The question was whether Belgium should remain a part of France not whether it should be restored to the Emperor By their peace with him the French acquired a great accession of strength as well as liberty of action and the political objection on our side to leaving Belgium in their hands was infinitely stronger after that peace than before it Necessity may be pleaded to justify any thing but where was the wisdom or necessity of committing his Majesty's honour by such a peremptory declaration A wise Minister takes his ground deliberately and then he maintains it firmly  On the th of December Mr Pitt informed  the House of Commons that the King's Ambassador had been dismissed  with every mark of ignominy and insult that a studied insult  refined and matured by the French Directory had been offered to his Britannic Majesty and then he asked whether  after the King's Minister had been ordered in the most insulting manner to leave the territories of France after our propositions had been slighted and our Ambassador insulted were we by sending couriers to Paris to prostrate ourselves at the feet of a stubborn and supercilious Government to do what they require and to submit to whatever they may impose I hope there is not a hand in his Majesty's councils which would sign the proposal that there is not a heart in this House who would sanction the measure and that there is not an individual in the British dominions who would act as the courier  Such language whether true or not may serve to inflame a popular assembly but is not prudent or justifiable in a Minister of State How can he adhere to it without perpetual war How can he retract it without everlasting infamy The French made no apology They offered no reparation Yet in less than six months when the Minister himself had so degraded the office that no gentleman ought to have accepted it the same hand was found to sign the same heart to sanction and the same courier to carry the message exactly to the same parties Whether this miserable step indicated any thing but a sudden panic must be determined by the circumstances that preceded and the conduct that followed it The hearts of men are not so easily changed The French peace with the Empero  the insolvency of the Bank and the mu  inies in the Fleet were enough to frighten Ministers as they did the nation But fear is not the parent of honour and sincerity Without opening  the negotiation again Mr Pitt could not have kept his place Now a mere offer to put an end to hostilities while all the causes and all the effects of a rooted hatred remain can impose on no man There must be a real disposition to peace and this must be manifested by a temperate if not amicable language and by all the acts of kindness and conciliation which a state of war will admit of otherwise the forms of a negotiation avail nothing Prudent and temperate proceedings not hasty submissions prepare the way and dispose the minds of hostile powers to treat with moderation and good faith On any other footing a mere pacification if it could be obtained would be nothing but a malignant truce in which the hostile mind would remain and the preparation for hostility continue If while you offer peace in terms your actions and discourses indicate nothing but suspicion hatred and revenge you may possibly purchase a cessation of arms by concessions and sacrifices but you leave the enmity entire and strengthen it against you by the price you pay for a temporary suspension of its effects To make peace without friendship unless you could dictate the terms instead of receiving them is not merely useless but extremely dangerous especially with an enemy who owe you nothing but hatred who know that you aim at their utter destruction and who never can believe that the present Ministry can be in earnest in their pacific professions unless they are the falsest and vilest of mankind or unless they are reduced to the last extremity While the negotiation lasted invectives and abuse against the French Directory went on as usual or with very lit  le interruption in the newspapers paid and instructed by our Government Every man in London knows that these papers speak the language of Ministers and that they are kept in constant pay on purpose to prepare the public to adopt the sentiments and  views of Government The French know it as well as we do and this knowledge governs their opinion of our sincerity much more than the formal declarations and diplomatic phrases in use among Ministers  The second appointment of Lord Malmesbury in himself unexceptionable was not calculated to inspire the French with confidence or to conciliate their good will With or without a reason they suspected and distrusted him The Directory said that  another choice would have augured more favourably for the speedy conclusion of a peace  Lord Grenville said  that this remark of the Directory was certainly not of a nature to require any answer  The strict right of our Government to choose their Ambassador is not denied nor was it disputed by the French But in human dealing strict right is very often more offensive than injury because it furnishes no regular cause of complaint especially if it be of no real or important use to the party that asserts it and still more if it be harshly or superciliously maintained  To justify the Minister in breaking off the negotiation he is bound to prove not only that the demands of the French were unjust and unreasonable for such they might be in articles of no consequence but that they could not be granted without such danger as exceeded the risk and outweighed the consequences of continuing the war  The French Plenipotentiaries objected to the title of  King of France  assumed by His Majesty They said it was essential to the full acknowledgement of their  Republic  that this regal title should not exist any where Lord Malmesbury  endeavoured  to make  them feel  but without success  that it was cavilling for a mere word  Their second demand was for a restitution of the ships taken and destroyed at Toulon or an equivalent  for them No subject was more talked of in England or more likely to be introduced if not insisted on by the French Yet Lord Malmesbury said  it came upon him unexpectedly  The argument of the French stands thus  Lord Hood was admitted into Toulon and took possession of the ships c on the following condition viz that when peace shall be reestablished in France the ships and forts which shall have been put into the hands of the English shall be restored to the  French nation  in the same state they were in when the inventory was delivered By treating with the Republic you acknowledge the existence of a competent government to which every restitution due to the French nation ought to be made Yon cannot pretend that you hold the ships taken at Toulon as a deposit in trust for Louis XVIII when by making a perpetual peace with the Republic you are yourselves parties to an act which annihilates the pretensions of that person Neither could even  he  have any claim to the restitution unless he were in possession of the Throne Ships of war magazines c are national property not within the personal ownership of princes much less removable with their persons They are the fixtures of the State which even the Sovereign in possession cannot alienate from the defence or service of the country We demand the restitution as representatives of the French nation which you acknowledge us to be and precisely in the terms of your own engagement  Lord Malmesbury without attempting to answer the argument rejects the claim He says  it was  so perfectly unlooked for  that it was  impossible  for him to be provided for it in his instructions and that they could not have devised a step more likely to defeat the great end of his mission  Lord Grenville says that these demands were received here  with great surprise  Now does any man believe that they were so entirely unexpected or is it any answer to an argument to say that you are extremely surprised at it In His Majesty's declaration of the th of October these demands are called  frivolous and offensive without any solid advantages to France  It is nor quite clear that the objection to His Majesty's retaining the t  tle of King of their country is on  their  part  a mere cavil about a word  whatever it may be on ours But that the recovery of their ships should not be a solid advantage to them is to say the least of it  n extravagant proposition  These however were not the difficulties that put an end to the negotiation it was not quire desperate until the French Plenipotentiaries called on Lord Malmesbury to declare  whether he had or had not sufficient powers to treat on the principle of a general restitution of every possession belonging to them and their allies which remained in His Majesty's hands  This demand was accompanied with a specific explanation which cannot fairly be separated from it viz  That an inquiry into the nature of the discretionary authority confided in a Minister by no means implied an intention of requiring him to act up to it to its utmost limits  The demand and the explanation must be taken together and considered as one proposition To any other Ambassador the French probably would not have thought it necessary to put such a question They had not forgotten that in his former embassy  at every communication he was in want of the advice of his Court  Delacroix December  Whether this was their motive or not it is evident that if they had meant by this step to put an end to the negotiation they would have insisted on the question simply without the explanation Lord Malmesbury  says that  their question went not  to the extent of his full powers  but to require of him to declare the nature of his instructions  In the first place he answers their question in a sense materially different from that which they attached to it he then affirms that the extent of his powers and the nature of his instructions are one and the same thing But for this he assigns no reason nor does he at all specify or intimate what the inconvenience or disadvantage would have been if he had given them a direct answer in the affirmative which he might have done in the terms of Lord Grenville's official note of the th of June viz  That his full powers included  every  case and gave him the  most unlimited authority  to conclude  any  articles treaties  c or in the very terms of their own demand understood according to the explanation with which it was accompanied They knew as well as he that in the exercise and application of his powers he must be governed by his instructions and that he might be as effectually restrained by his instructions from making particular restitutions as he could be by any limitation in his powers If he had said  Yes  the negotiation must have proceeded and possibly might have ended with success What were the avowed objects that stood in the way of it The Cape and Ceylon In our declaration of the th of October it is asserted  that France has insisted that His Majesty should give up without compensation and into the hands of his  enemies  the necessary defences of his possessions and the future safeguards of his empire  Now of this Declaration the two first articles are palpably untrue The question was not whether Lord Malmesbury should actually consent to the restitution of all our conquests but whether he had powers to treat to that extent Such restitution is never made  until peace is concluded of course it cannot be made to  an enemy  These places viz the Cape and Ceylon are qualified as the  necessary defences of His Majesty's possessions and the future safeguards of his empire  Does the Minister mean to affirm in the plain and direct sense of the Declaration that our possessions in India could not be defended that our Indian empire was not safe without the Cape and the Dutch settlements in Ceylon The fact is that while France and Holland had a marine sufficient to cope with us in the Indian seas and while the French held a powerful establishment in the Carnatic the British empire was not only defencible and safe but grew and increased beyond the limits of true policy and prudence and that its danger if any arose from its unbounded frontier and unmanageable extent How the acquisition of the Cape and Ceylon could be a security against that sort of danger or why our other possessions should be defenceless without them at any time and particularly  now  when the power of France and Holland is annihilated in India are questions which the writer of the Declaration has not thought fit to meddle with Nor is it possible to conceive a rational argument by which the affirmative on either of them can be made out But if the assertion were in any degree true and if these acquisitions were ever so valuable still you must consider the price you are to pay for them Are they worth the cost and charge of a single campaign Do they pay the expence of their establishments or any part of it Do we really want these places for defence and security Are we never to make peace without them Or is it only a pretence set up for the real purpose of continuing the war The Minister is bound to state his reasons for affirming that the Cape and Ceylon are the necessary defences of his Majesty's possessions and the safeguard  of his empire or to tell us distinctly what he means by that declaration A naked assertion is sufficiently answered by a contradiction  If this state of the facts be true and if these considerations are valid the conclusion from them may be quashed by power or denied by prejudice but cannot be resisted in argumentthat the Minister has voluntarily plunged the nation into this disastrous war not only without justice or necessity but without a provocation and in the face of submissions little short of supplication that in offering to treat with impious regicides robbers and assassins he has abandoned what he called the moral principle of the war that in offering to renew the intercourse between England and France considering how France ist constituted he has abandoned what he called the fundamental policy of the war that these steps were taken not seriously for their pretended object but to answer other purposes that if he had been sincere in desiring it he might have had peace long ago on tolerable terms that the Directory now will never make peace with him because they cannot trust him and that as long as the war is continued they will rise in their demands The Minister will say that he is proud of their enmity and that the distrust of such a foe gives him an additional claim to the confidence of his country The French object to him not because he is hostile to them but because they think his conduct has been treacherous  Durante bello  he ought to be their enemy but he ought not to offer peace with one hand while with the other he foments plots and conspiracies to overturn their government Admitting however the merit of this hostile character and forgetting that as long as it prevails on his own principles there can be no peace with France or settlement of Ireland has he after all▪ a real claim to it At first he denounces immortal hatred to the French  to their principles to their government to their existence  Littora littoribus contraria fluctibus undas  He then makes them a cordial offer of perpetual peace sincere friendship and mutual intercourse When that fails he goes back to his enmity He then makes them a second tender of his most sincere amity and now he reverts to his enmity again  Bellum pax rursum  He reviles and courts the same parties alternately and Parliament vibrates with him  In what condition this just and necessary war if ever it can be ended will leave us at last may appear doubtful to those who are not struck with the actual result of it They who thrive by the present distress are not likely to be alarmed by future dangers The vermin feed and the animal dies In the last five years the Minister has wasted above two hundred millions of money borrowed besides all the growing income of the country and an immense arrear of debt anaccounted and unprovided for He set out with an association of the principal powers of Europe whom he paid and of the inferior states whom he forced to join in the confederacy and now we have but one friend left who  if not actually negotiating with France  makes no contribution to the war and must sink if she is not supported by the protection of Great Britain Is there another power in Europe that would not gladly promote the downfall of England They see us stand aloof commanding the sea and apparently in safety encouraging bribing or bullying other nations to persecute and destroy one another On the Continent the English Government and not the French with all their enormities are considered as the original incendiaries and common enemy of mankind The French  they say plunder the house but the English set it on fire  The kingdom of Ireland constituting a third of the empire instead of contributing to the common cause is proclaimed to be in a state of open rebellion and with difficulty kept down by a great army paid by England which ought to have been employed against France but which is now in such a state as  to be formidable to every one but the enemy  Specific evidence is unnecessary The condition of the army is sufficient to prove what the condition of the country must be where soldiers range at large not only without civil authority but without discipline But the groans of Ireland are too distant to be heard Her sorrows are not seen The dresses of the opera are corrected and all the duties of Christianity are performed  In England and Scotland the general disposition of the people may be fairly judged of by the means which are said to be necessary to counteract it an immense standing army barracks in every part of the country the Bill of Rights suspended and in effect a military government  Since the year the property of the public creditor has lost about half its marketable value which the enormous increase of the mass makes it impossible it should ever recover The whole effect of a sinking fund of four millions augmented by the fall of public credit and acting on a capital so depreciated is to keep the per cents at a fluctuating price between and With that prodigious engine of financial power in his hands the Minister has been fearful of encountering another loan and now he confesses that under the measures of his administration public credit has been so much impaired that it has become absolutely necessary to give additional support and security so the national funds by making  the landtax perpetual and putting it up to auction in Change Alley  A few months before payment was stopped at the Bank any man who had predicted that event would have been pitied as a madman or proscribed as a traitor The Bank is identified with Government and with their connivance may issue its paper to any unknown amount An act of Parliament is always ready to shelter them from the demands of their lawful creditors The only effectual security to the public against an exorbitant emission of Bank paper is to be obliged to pay in specie on demand Take away that restraint and then what is the Bank or what may it be but an instrument of enormous power and fraud in the hands of the Minister  The final fate of the Funds is involved not only in the instant exigencies of the war but in the necessities which the war will entail on the peace To provide for the establishments and to pay the interest of the debt out of any fund that does not invade the sources of production is palpably impossible But a nation that supplies its income out of its capital lives on the seed and then the question is not whether a great emergency may not demand and justify a great exertion but how long the ordinary strength can support the extraordinary effort The demand that exceeds the ability is sure to lessen it that is the inability increases with the demand  Against an invasion all hearts and hands must be united but why should the French run the risque of an attempt so desperate if not impracticable when it is plain that th  y can effectually ruin us without it  Their  purpose is sufficiently answered by the menace while on this side the alarm is encouraged as a spur to contribution  The superior skill and courage of our officers and seamen have been attended as I trust they ever will be with successes that illustrate and adorn the naval  character of the nation But the use and the lustre of these great events are by no means equal Unless they are wisely applied to the purposes of peace they may dazzle and mislead us What must be the respective condition of France and England taken together and comprehending all circumstances when such victories make no impression on the courage and determination nor even on the prudence of the enemy and when even the English are not elated by them We are masters of the ocean while almost all the ports of Europe from the Texel to Venice are shut against us Our fleets may keep the sea until the ships are worn out while the French predominate on shore and may if they will engross the trade of the Continent  This country is now at the utmost strain of all its remaining resources not for the purpose of attempting any vigorous operation against a vulnerable enemy which if it succeeded might reduce them to reasonable terms but if possible to defend the two islands against an invasion which the enemy may continue to hold over us with very little effort on their part or much inconvenience to their affairs until the nerves and sinews of England are broken by exertions unavailing while they
