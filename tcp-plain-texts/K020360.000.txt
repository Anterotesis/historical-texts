have glided through the globe a harmless sprite have pervaded the continents of  Europe Asia  and  Africa  and described them with the same authenticity as  Gemelli Careri  or many other travellers ideal or real who are to this day read with avidity and quoted with faith My great change is not perceived by mortal eyes I still haunt the bench of justices I am now active in hastening levies of our generous  Britons  into the field However unequal I still retain the same zeal in the services of my country and twice since my departure have experienced human passions and have grown indignant at injuries offered to my native land or have incited a vigorous defence against the lunatic designs of enthusiastic tyranny or the presumptuous plans of fanatical atheists to spread their reign and force their tenets on the contented moral part of their fellow creatures May I remain possessed with  the same passions till the great EXORCIST lays me for ever The two last numbers in the following pages are my postexistent performances Surviving friends smile on the attempts Surviving enemy if any I can NOW have forgive my errors  Tu manes ne laede meos  THOMAS PENNANT  CONTENTS  LITERARY LIFE

THOMAS PENNANT  Esq  in his Tours in WALES  JURE  X  LIBERORUM  portrait of John Lloyd  OF MY LITERARY LIFE  VIXI ET QUEM DEDERAT CURSUM FORTUNA PEREGI  ORIGINAL CAUSE OF MY STUDIES  A PRESENT of the ornithology of  Francis Willughby  esq made to me when I was about the age of twelve by my kinsman the late  John Salisbury  esq of  Bachegraig  in the county of  Flint  father of the fair and celebrated writer Mrs  Piozzi  first gave me a taste for that study and incidentally a love for that of natural history in general which I have since pursued with my constitutional ardor  A TOUR IN CORNWAL OR  A TOUR I made into  Cornwal  from  Oxford  in the year or gave me a strong passion for minerals and fossils in which I was greatly encouraged by that able and worthy man the late reverend doctor  William Borlase  of  Ludgvan  who in the kindest manner communicated to me every thing worthy my notice  THE first thing of mine which appeared in print was inserted unknown to me an abstract of a letter I had written to my ever venerated friend and uncle  James Mytton  esq on an earthquake which was felt at  Downing April  the d This with several similar testimonies may be seen in the xth volume of the Abridgment of the Philosophical Transactions p  ELECTED FELLOW OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES  HAVING an inclination to the study of antiquities I was on  November  the st elected a fellow of the society of antiquaries  RESIGN  THIS honor I resigned about the year I had married a most amiable woman my circumstances at that time were very narrow my worthy father being alive and I vainly thought my happiness would have been permanent and that I never should have been called again from my retirement to amuse myself in town or to be of use to the society  VISIT IRELAND IN  IN the summer of I visited the hospitable kingdom of  Ireland  and travelled from  Dublin  to  BalliCastle  the  GiantsCauseway Colraine  the extremity of the county of  Donegal LondonDerry Strabone Inniskillen Galway Limcrick  the lake of  Killarney Kinsale Cork Cashel Waterford Kilkenny Dublin  But such was the conviviality of the country that my journal proved as  maigre  as my entertainment was  gras  so it never was a dish fit to be offered to the public  ACCOUNT OF SOME CORALLOIDS  In the Philosophical Transactions of vol xlix p is a trifling paper of mine on several coralloid bodies I had collected at  Coal brookdale  in  Shropshire  It is accompanied by a plate engraven from some drawings by  Watkin Williams  a person who at that time was an humble companion of my father  IN ELECTED OF THE R S AT UPSAL  On  February  I received the first and greatest of my literary honors I value myself the more on its being conferred on me at the instance of  Linnaeus  himself with whom I had began a correspondence in I had sent him an account of a recent  concha anomia  which I found adhering to a seaplant of the  Norwegian  seas sent to me by bishop  Pontoppidan  Hanc  says the great naturalist  recitavi in societatis regiae Upsaliensis publico consessu    d    Februarii quam collegae et socii omnes avidissimè excipiebant et mirati sunt te quoque codem die membrum praefatae societatis unanimo consensu elegere omnes et mibi in mandatis dedere hoc tibi significandi probè persuasi te excepturum hoc eorum officium benevolè ob amorem quem sers in scientias et omnia quae usui publico inserviant  My correspondence continued with this illustrious personage till age and infirmities obliged him to desist He did me the honor of accepting all my labors published before the year He spoke of them in terms too favorable for me to repeat  FOLIO EDITION OF THE BRITISH ZOOLOGY  About the year I began my  British Zoology  which when completed consisted of cxxxii plates on imperial paper They were all engraven by Mr  Peter Mazel  now living and of whose skill and integrity I had always occasion to speak well The painter was Mr  Peter Pallou  an excellent artist but too fond of giving gaudy colours to his subjects He painted for my hall at  Downing  several pictures of birds and animals attended with suitable landscapes Four were intended to represent the climates The frigid zone and an  European  scene of a farmyard are particularly well done all have their merit but occasion me to lament his conviviality which affected his circumstances and abridged his days  THE worthy and ingenious  George Edwards  that admirable ornithologist at first conceived a little jealousy on my attempt but it very soon subsided We became very intimate and he continued to his dying day ready and earnest to promote all my labors He presented me as a proof of his friendship with numbers of the original drawings from which his etchings had  been formed These I keep not only in respect to his memory but as curious testimonies of his faithful and elegant pencil  I dedicated the  British Zoology  to the benefit of the  Welsh  school near  Gray'sinnlane London  and supported the far greater part of the expence I lost considerably by it notwithstanding several gentlemen contributed My agent was that very honest man Mr  Richard Morris  of the navy office His widow was left in narrow circumstances I therefore permitted her to keep the plates and make what advantage she could of them I was at the time of undertaking this work unexperienced in these affairs and was illadvised to publish on such large paper had it been originally in quarto the school would have been considerably benefited by it  JOURNEY TO THE CONTINENT  THIS work was for a time left unfinished by reason of a short tour I made to the continent I lest  London  on  February  the th passed through  St Omer Aire Arras Perron  and across the great forest to  Chantilli  and from thence to  Paris  I made some stay at that capital and was during the time made happy in the company of the celebrated naturalist  Le Comte de Buffon  LE COMTE DE BUFFON  with whom I passed much of the time He was satisfied with my proficiency in natural history and publickly acknowleged his favorable sentiments of my studies in the fifteenth volume of his  Histoire Naturelle  Unfortunately long before I had any thoughts of enjoying the honor of his acquaintance I had in my  British Zoology  made a comparison between the freethinking philosopher and our great and religious countryman Mr  Ray  much to the advantage of the latter The subject was a Mole really too ridiculous to have been  noticed but such was his irritability that in the first volume of his  Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux  he fell on me most unmercifully but happily often without reason He probably relented for in the following volumes he frequently made use of my authority which fully atoned for a hasty and misguided fit of passion I did not wish to quarrel with a gentleman I truly esteemed yet unwilling to remain quite passive in my Index to his admirable works and the  Planches Enluminécs  I did venture to repel his principal charge and  con amore  to retaliate on my illustrious assailant Our blows were light and I hope that neither of us felt any material injury  I MUST blame the  Comte  for suppressing his acknowlegement of several communications of animals which I sent to him for the illustration of his  Histcire Naturelle  One was his  Conguar Noir  Suppl iii tab lxii my  Jaguar  or  Black Tiger  Hist Quadr N  o  Another was the drawing of his  Isatis  Suppl iii tab xvii which he attributes to good  Peter Collinson  The third was his  Chacal Adive  of the same work p tab xvi and my  Barbary  Fox Hist Quadr N  o  of which I furnished him with the designs These are no great matters I lament them only as small defects in a great character  AT MONBARD  I took the usual road to  Lyon  excepting a small digression in  Burgundy  in compliance with the friendly invitation of the  Comte  to pass a few days with him in his seat at  Monbard  His house was built at the foot of a hill crowned with a ruined castle he had converted the castleyard into a garden and fitted up one of the towers into a study To that place he retired every morning about seven o'clock to compose his excellent works free from all interruption He continued there  till between one and two when he returned dined with his family and gave up the whole remainder of the day to them and his friends whom he entertained with the most agreeable and rational conversation  VOLTAIRE  AT  Ferney  in the extremity of the same province I visited that wicked wit  Voltaire  he happened to be in goodhumour and was very entertaining but in his attempt to speak  English  satisfied us that he was perfect master of our oaths and our curses  THE forenoon was not the proper time to visit  Voltaire  he could not bear to have his hours of study interrupted this alone was enough to put him in bad humour and not without reason Lesser people may have the same cause of complaint when a lounger who has no one thing to do breaks on their hours of writing estimates the value of their time by his own and diverts their attention in the most pretious hours of the rural morning  From  Lyon  I went to  Grenoble  and the  Grand Chartreuse Chamberri  and  Geneva  and from thence over the greatest part of  Swisserland  At  Bern  I commenced acquaintance with that excellent man the late baron  Haller  BARON HALLER  who on every occasion shewed the utmost alacrity to promote my pursuits At  Zurich  with the two  Gesners  the poet and the naturalist the last the descendant of the great  Conrad Gesner  Ulm  and  Augsburg  were the first cities I visited in  Germany Donawert Nurenberg Erlang Bamberg  and  Frankfort  on the  Maine  succeeded At the declining city of  Nurenberg  I visited doctor  Trew  DOCTOR TREW  a venerable patron of natural history At  Mentz  I embarked on the  Rhine  and fell down that magnificent river  as low as  Cologne  From  Dusseldorp  I went to  Xanten  and from thence reached  Holland  few parts of which I left unvisited  DOCTOR PALLAS  I esteem my meeting with doctor  Pallas  at the  Hague  a momentous affair for it gave rise to my  Synopsis of Quadrupeds  and the second edition under the name of the  History of Quadrupeds  a work received by the naturalists of different parts of  Europe  in a manner uncommonly favorable This and the following year doctor  Pallas  resided at the  Hague  From congeniality of disposition we soon became strongly attached Our conversation rolled chiefly on natural history and as we were both enthusiastic admirers of our great  Ray  I proposed his undertaking a history of quadrupeds on the system of our illustrious countryman a little reformed He assented to my plan and on  January  the th he wrote to me a long letter in which he sent an outline of his design and his resolution to pursue it with all the expedition consistent with his other engagements But this work was fated to be accomplished by an inferior genius In the next year he returned to  Berlin  his native place his abilities began to be highly celebrated his fame reached the court of  Petersburgh  and the empress not more to her own honor than that of my friend invited him into her service and in placed him at the head of one of the philosophical expeditions projected for discovery in the most distant parts of her vast dominions This was an expedition worthy of  Pallas  it began in  June  and was concluded on the th of  July  It unfolded all his great talents and established his fame equal at left to the greatest philosophers of the age He was lost to me during that period On hearing of his return I wrote to him at  Petersburgh  and sent to  him all the works I had published since our separation he received them with the candor which only great minds possess at the fight of the successful labors of others On  November  the th I received from him the first letter of our renewed correspondence which continued several years to my great instruction He suppressed nothing that could be of service to the cause of literature nor did he desist till overpowered with business he dropt all epistolary duties except those which were official To this day he convinces me of his friendship by constant presents of the productions of his celebrated pen  MR GRONOVIUS  AT  Leyden  I had the pleasure of making a personal acquaintance with my worthy correspondent doctor  Lawrence Theodore Gronovius  descended from a race celebrated for their immense erudition his own labors will remain lasting proofs of his being an undegenerated son  On  February  the th I was elected Fellow of our Royal Society  BRITISH ZOOLOCY SECOND EDITION  Mr  Benjamin White  bookseller proposed to me the republication of the  British Zoology  which was done in in two volumes octavo illustrated with xvii plates he payed me £ for my permission which I immediately vested in the  Welsh  charity school I may here observe that  M de Murre  of  Nurenbergh  translated the folio edition into  German  and  Latin  and published it in that size with the plates copied and colored by the ingenious artists of that city  IN the  May  of this year I met Sir  Joseph Banks  then Mr  Banks  at  Revesby Abby  his seat in  Lincolnshire  during my stay I made many observations on the zoology of the country and must acknowlege the various obligations I lie under to that  gentleman for his liberal communications resulting from the uncommon extent of his travels  I MAY here mention that our first acquaintance commenced on  March  th when he called on me at my lodgings in  St James's Street  and presented me with that scarce book  Turner de Avibus  c a gift I retain as a valuable proof of his esteem An unhappy interruption of our friendship once took place but it recommenced I trust to the content of both parties in a fortunate moment in  March    A THIRD VOLUME OF FISHES c  IN I added to the  British Zoology  a third volume in octavo on the reptiles and fishes of  Great Britain  This was illustrated with xvii plates  IN the preceding year sir JOSEPH BANKS communicated to me a new species of  Pinguin  brought by captain  Machride  from the  Falkland  islands I drew up an account of it and of all the other species then known and laid it before the  Royal Society  They were pleased to direct that it should be published which was done in this year in the lviiith volume of the  Philosophical Transactions  It was accompanied by a figure It is not a good one the skin having been too much distended but in the second edition of my  Genera of Birds  a most faithful representation is given taken from the life by doctor  Reinhold Forster  I named it  Patagonian  not only on account of the size but because it is very common in the neighborhood of that race of tall men  INDIAN ZOOLOGY  MY mind was always in a progressive state it never could stagnate this carried me farther than the limits of our island and made me desirous of forming a zoology of some distant country by which I might relieve my pen by the pleasure of  the novelty and variety of the subjects I was induced to prefer that of  India  from my acquaintance with  John Gideon Loten  esq who had long been a governor in more than one of the  Dutch  islands in the  Indian  ocean and with a laudable zeal had employed several most accurate artists in delineating on the spot the birds and other subjects of natural history He offered to me the use of them in a manner that shewed his liberal turn Twelve plates in small folio were engraven at the joint expence of sir  Joseph Banks  Mr  Loten  and myself to which I added descriptions and little essays I forget how the work ceased to proceed but remember that at my persuasion the plates were bestowed on doctor  John Reinhold Forster  together with three more engraven at my own expence These he took with him into  Germany  faithfully translated the letterpress into  Latin  and  German  and added a most ingenious differtation on the climate winds and soil of  India  and another on the birds of  Paradise  and the  Phoenix  all which he published at  Halle  in  Saxony  in  OF MOSES GRIFFITH  IN the spring of this year I acquired that treasure  Moses Grissith  born  April  th at  Trygainhouse  in the parish of  Bryn Groer  in  Llein  in  Caernarvonshire  descended from very poor parents and without any other instruction than that of reading and writing He early took to the use of his pencil and during his long service with me has distinguished himself as a good and faithful servant and able artist he can engrave and he is tolerably skilled in music He accompanied me in all my journies except that of the present year The public may thank him for numberless scenes and antiquities which would otherwise have remained probably for ever concealed  FIRST TOUR INTO SCOTLAND  THIS year was a very active one with me I had the hardiness to venture on a journey to the remotest part of  North Britain  a country almost as little known to its southern brethren as  Kamtschatka  I brought home a favorable account of the land Whether it will thank me or not I cannot say but from the report I made and shewing that it might be visited with safety it has ever since been  inondée  with southern visitants  ELECTED FELLOW OF THE R ACAD AT DRONTHEIM  IN the same year I received a very polite letter from the reverend  Jo Ernest Gunner  bishop of  Drontheim  in  Norway  informing me that I had been elected member of the Royal Academy of Sciences on  March  the th past of which society that prelate was president  IN the midst of my reigning pursuits I never neglected the company of my convivial friends or shunned the society of the gay world At an assembly in the spring the lively conversation of an agreeable Fair gave birth to the  ODE  occasioned by a Lady professing an attachment to  INDIFFERENCE  FLY INDIFFERENCE hated maid  Seek  Spitzbergen  's barren shade  Where old Winter keeps his court  There fit Guest do thou resort  And thy frosty breast repose  'Midst congenial ice and snows  There reside insipid maid  But ne'er infest my EMMA's head  Or else seek the Cloister's pale  Where reluctant Virgins veil  In the corner of whose heart  Earth with Heaven still keeps a part  There thy fullest influence shower  Free poor Grace from Passion's power  Give give fond ELOISA rest  But shun oh shun my EMMA's breast  Or on LYCE wanton maid  Be thy chilling finger laid  Quench the frolic beam that flies  From her bright fantastic eyes  Teach the sweet Coquet to know  Heart of ice in breast of snow  Give peace to her Give

cold embraces  And to thee resign her graces  What alas is left for me  But to fly myself to thee  CHESTER  March    ADDITIONAL PLATES TO THE BRITISH ZOOLOGY  IN I published ciii additional plates to the three volumes of  British Zoology  with several new descriptions besides reserences to those which had been before described it appeared in an octavo volume of pages in which is included a list of  European  birds extra  Britannic  PUBLISH THE SYNOPSIS OF QUADRUPEDS  In I printed at  Chester  my  Synopsis of Quadrupeds  in one volume octavo with xxxi plates  ON  May  the th I was honored by the university of  Oxford  with the degree of doctor of laws conferred on me in full convocation I was presented in the absence of the public orator by the reverend Mr  Foster  who made a most flattering speech on the occasion  IN  September  of the same year I took a journey to  London  to see sir  Joseph Banks  and doctor  Solander  on their arrival from their circumnavigation In my return I visited  Robert Berkeley  esq of  Spetchly  near  Worcester  to indulge my curiosity with seeing and examining Mr  Faulkner  an aged jesuit  FATHER FAULKNER A JESUIT  who had passed thirtyeight years in  Patagonia  his account satisfied me of the existence of the tall race of mankind In the appendix to this work I have given all I could collect respecting that muchdoubted people  TOUR IN SCOTLAND IN TWO EDITIONS  ABOUT this time I gave to the public my  Tour in Scotland  in one volume octavo containing xviii plates A candid account of that country was such a novelty that the impression was instantly bought up and in the next year another was printed and as soon sold  IN this tour as in all the succeeding I labored earnestly to conciliate the affections of the two nations so wickedly and studiously set at variance by evildesigning people I received several very flattering letters on the occasion An extract of one from that respectable nobleman the late earl of  Kinnoull  dated  February  the th may serve  instar omnium  I PERUSED your book for which I return my hearty thanks with the greatest pleasure every reader must admire the goodness of the author's heart the inhabitants of this part of the united kingdoms should express the warmest gratitude for your candid representation of them and their country This unless my countrymen wish to forfeit the favorable opinion you entertain and endeavor to impress upon the minds of their fellow subjects must procure you their best thanks  It would be a worse reflection upon us than any that has fallen from the most envenomed pen if the writer of that account did not meet with the most grateful acknowlegement  DOCTOR FORSTER's AMERICAN CATALUGUE  IN this year doctor  Forster  published a catalogue of the animals of  North America  I had begun the work by a list of the quadrupeds birds and fishes Doctor  Forster  added all the rest and afterwards in a new edition favored the world with a most comprehensive  Flora  of that vast country with a catalogue of insects and the directions for preserving natural curiosities My part in this work is of so little merit that it need not be boasted of I only lay clame to my proper right  IT was in this year that I laid before the  Royal Society  an account of two new species of Tortoises The one a freshwater species known in  North America  by the name of the  Softshelled Tortoise  It is attended by a very accurate history of its manners and two fine figures communicated to me by the worthy doctor  Garden  of  Charlestown South Caroline  My paper was published in vol lxi of the Transactions attended by a plate This is the  Testudo ferox  of  Gmelin Lin  iii and  Le Molle  of  La Cepede  i tab vii  THE other is a small and new species which I name

 my success was equal to my hopes I pointed out every thing I thought would be of service to the country it was rouzed to look into its advantages societies have been formed for the improvements of the fisheries and for founding of towns in proper places to all which I sincerely wish the most happy event vast sums will be flung away but incidentally numbers will be benefited and the passion of patriots tickled I confess that my own vanity was  greatly gratified by the compliments paid to me in every corporated town  Edinburgh  itself presented me with its freedom and I returned rich in civic honors  GENERA OF BIRDS IN  I PUBLISHED the octavo edition of  Genera of Birds  in and gave with it an explanatory plate  NORTHERN TOUR OF THIS YEAR  THIS likewise was a year of great activity I rode for almost all my tours were on horseback to Mr  Graham  's of  Netherby  beyond  Carlisle  through those parts of  Lancashire Westmoreland  and  Cumberland  which I had not before seen I visited  Sefton Ormskirk Blackburne  and  Clithero  in  Lancashire Malham Coves Settle  and  Ingleborough  in  Yorkshire Kirkby Lonsdale Kirkby Stephen  and  Orton  in  Westmoreland  and all the countess of  Cumberland  's castles in that county  Naworth Corbie  and  Beucastle  in  Cumberland  In my way I skirted the western side of  Yorkshire  I passed some hours with the reverend doctor  Burn  at  Orton  in  Westmoreland  a most useful and worthy character  FROM  Netherby  I crossed  Alston Moor  into the bishoprick of  Durham  made some stay with its prelate doctor  John Egerton  and entered  Yorkshire  after crosing the  Tees  at  Barnard Castle  From thence I visited  Rokesby  house  Catterick  bridge the singular circular entrenchments attributed to the  Danes  the picturesque  Hackfall  and the venerable remains of  Fountaine  's abby The last attracted my attention so much that I revisited them in  May  and each time they gave full employ to the pencil of  Moses Griffith  He etched two of his drawings I here give one of the plates as a specimen of his extensive genius  FROM thence I crossed to  Boroughbridge  and  Knaresborough  Part of the inside  of the CHURCH of FOUNTAINS ABBY  From  Harrogate  I visited the wonderful  lususes  of  Bramham  crags and caused great numbers of drawings to be made of the most striking pieces  FROM  Harrogate  I rode to  York  where  Moses Griffith  was by no means idle Among many other drawings I caused him out of veneration to the taste of Mr  Gray  to make a second drawing  See Memoirs of his Life c p second edition  of the chapel so much admired by that elegant genius From  York  I rode the great diagonal of the county to  Spurnhead  Near  Hull  payed a second time my respects to my friend  William Constable  esq of  Burton Constable  WILLIAM CONSTABLE ESQ  a gentleman the most happy in a liberal and munificent turn of mind of any one I know I kept along the  Humber  and from its banks went to  Howden Pontefract Doncaster  and  Kiveton  visited  Worksop Welbeck  the antient house of  Hardwick Bolsover Castle Derby Dovedale Buxton Leek  and proceeded by  Congleton  and  Chester  to my own house I kept a journal of the whole I mention as well as numberless places which I omit In every tour I made I kept a regular journal all which are placed apart in my library these I wish never to be made public as they may contain inaccuracies either from haste or misinformation yet as they contain many descriptions of buildings and accounts of places in the state they were at the time they were made they ought not totally to be neglected  Moses Griffiths  made numbers of drawings my ingenious friend Mr  Grose  honored me with using several for his fine work of the Antiquities of  England  MR HUTCHINSON  and I believe Mr  Hutchinson  of  Bernard Castle  will do the same in his history of  Durbam  I COMMENCED a friendship with that gentleman in this journey in a most singular manner I was mounted on the famous stones in the churchyard of  Penrith  to take a nearer view of them and see whether the drawing I had procured done by the rev doctor  Tod  had the lest foundation in truth Thus engaged a person of good appearance looking up at me observed "what fine work Mr  Pennant  had made with those stones" I saw he had got into a horrible scrape so unwilling to make bad worse descended laid hold of his button and told him "I am the man" After his confusion was over I made a short defence shook him by the hand and we became from that moment fast friends  THE subject of part of this journey will be found among my posthumous works fairly transcribed neatly bound in vellum and richly illustrated with drawings by  Moses Griffith  and with prints This will take in the space from  Downing  to  Orford  the seat of my worthy and venerable friend the late  John Blackburne  esq From thence to  Knowsly Sephton Ormskirk Latham  and crossing the country to  Blackborn Whalleyabby Ribchester Mitton Waddingtonhall  and  Clithero  most of them in the county of  Lancashire  In that of  York  I visited  Sallyabby Boltonhall Malham Coves Settle Giggleswick  and  Ingleton  I THEN crossed the  Lune  to  Kirkby Lonsdale  and visited all the parts of  Westmoreland  and  Cumberland  omitted in my printed tours of and and finally I finished this MS volume at  Alston  near the borders of  Durham  For a more full  account of my various  posthuma  I refer the reader to the latter pages of this book  IN this year I kept a regular journal of the road between my house and  London  and did the same on my return digressing to the right or to the left as the places which merit notice happened to lie  I BEGAN the account of this excursion with saying that almost all my tours were performed on horseback to that and to the perfect ease of mind I enjoyed in these pleasing journies I owe my  viridis senectus  I still retain as far as possible the same species of removal from place to place I consider the absolute resignation of one's person to the luxury of a carriage to forebode a very short interval between that and the vehicle which is to convey us to our last stage  THIRD EDITION OF MY FIRST TOUR IN SCOTLAND  IN I published a third edition of my  Tour in Scotland  in quarto with the xxi new plates but to accommodate the purchasers of the first edition I republished with letterpress of the octavo size all those plates  IN this edition appeared a small poem of mine in reply to a most amiable dignitary now high on the bench of bishops who had written to me halfjest halfearnest on an invidious comparison I had made between the  English  and  Scotch  clergy I thought it best to make my defence in rhyme so sent him the lines in p of that edition and all was well again my coloring of the portraits I gave is certainly high but the likenesses are confessed by all who have seen the originals The reader need not be informed that the seven first lines are borrowed from the inimitable author of the  New Bath Guide  'FRIEND  'YOU you in fiery purgat'ry must stay  'Till gall and ink and dirt of scribbling day  'In purifying flames are purg'd away  'TRAVELLER  'O trust me dear D*** I

wrongly judge  Who've palm'd my empty pate  I Sternhold  Then if in these days such apostates appear  For such I am told are found there and here  O pardon dear friend a wellmeaning zeal  Too unguardedly telling the scandal I feel  It touches not you let the galled jades winch  Sound in morals and doctrine you never will flinch  O friend of past youth let me think of the fable  Oft told with chaste mirth at your innocent table  When instructively kind wisdom's rules you run o'er  Reluctant I leave you insatiate for more  So blest be the day that my joys will restore  I AM a sincere wellwisher to the pure form of worship of the church of  England  and am highly scandalized if I see any thing wrong in the conduct of our hierarchy Now and then complaint has been made against the unguarded admission of persons of the most discordant professions into the sacred pale who urged by no other call than that of poverty do not prove either ornamental or useful in their new character To check the progress of a practice injurious to the church and highly so to those who had spent their fortune in a course of education for the due discharge of their duties I sent a sarcastic but salutary print into the world at which even bishops themselves have deigned to smile  VOYAGE TO THE HEBRIDES PUBLISHED  IN the same year I published my journey into  Scotland  and my voyage to the  Hebrides  in one volume quarto with xliv plates In this work the beautiful views of the  Basaltic Staffa  appeared I had the bad fortune to be denied approach to that singular island but by the liberal communication of Sir  Joseph Banks  who touched there the same year in his way to  Iceland  the loss to the public was happily supplied  VOYAGE TO THE ISLE OF MAN  IN this year I visited the  Isle of Man  in company with the reverend doctor  Lort  captain  Grose Paul Panton  esq junior of  Plas Gwyn  in the island of  Anglesey  and the reverend  Hugh Davies  at this time rector of  Aber  in  Caernarvonshire  whose company gave additional pleasure to the tour I kept a journal and was favored with ample materials from the gentlemen of the island most of which were unaccountably lost about a year after and my design of giving an account of that island to the public was frustrated  I SHOULD accuse myself of a very undue neglect if I did not acknowlege the various services I received from the friendship of Mr  Davies  at different times since the beginning of our acquaintance I will in particular mention those which resulted from his great knowledge in botany To him I owe the account of our  Snowdonian  plants to him I lie under the obligation for undertaking in  June  at my request another voyage to the  Isle of Man  to take a second review of its vegetable productions By his labors a  Flora  of the island is rendered as complete as possible to be effected by a single person at one season of the year The number of plants he observed amounted to about five hundred and fifty  A TOUR INTO NORTHAMPTONSHIRE  IN the spring of on my return from my annual visit to  London  I took the  Northamptonshire  road passed by  Baldock Eaton St Neots Kimbolton Thraipston Draitonhouse Luffwick  and its fine tombs  Broughtonhouse  and the monuments at  Warkton Leicester Ashby de la Zouch Bradfordhall  celebrated in  Grammont  's Memoirs through  Burton on Trent  and by  Caversal Castle  to my own house  NEWPORT TONG OMBRESLEY MALVERNE AND TEWKESBURY  ON  August  the th I brought my son  David  to  Hackney  school and placed him under the care of Mr  Newcome  In my way I saw  Whitchurch Cumbermere Newport Tong Castle  and the tombs in the church  Ombresley Westwoodhouse Henlip Crome  the two  Malvernes  and  Tewkesbury  and after passing a few days at my respected friend's the then bishop of  St David  's at  Forthampton  proceeded and discharged my duty at  Hackney  by the way of  Gloucester  and  Cheltenham  I NEVER lost an opportunity of enlarging my knowlege of topography on my return I had the honor of passing some days with her grace the late dutchess dowager of  Portland  at her seat at  Bulstrode  and visited from thence  Windsor  and  Eaton  BULSTRODE WINDSOR STOKE POCEIS BEWDLEY  I also one morning saw the great house of  Stoke Pogeis  then the seat of Mr  Penn  it had gone through many great hands In the reign of  Edward  III it belonged to  John de Molin  a potent baron in right of his wife daughter of  Robert Pogeis  From  Bulstrode  I took the common road to  Worcester  passed a day or two as usual at  Beverey  with my old and constant friend the reverend doctor  Nash  author of the Antiquities of  Worcestershire  from his house went by  Stourport  and  Bewdley  to  Bridgenorth  and from thence through  Newport  to  Downing  THIRD VOLUME OF MY TOUR IN SCOTLAND PUELISHED  IN I published my third and last volume of my  Tour in Scotland  which took in the country from my landing at  Armaddie  on the conclusion of my voyage to the  Hebrides  to my return into  Flintshire  This was illustrated with xlvii plates  THESE tours were translated into  German  and abridged in  French  in the  Nouveau Recueil de Voyages au Nord c  torn quarto  Geneve  they were likewise reprinted at  Dublin  in octavo size  TOUR IN  IN my road in from  London  I visited  Banbury Wroxtonhall  the seat of lord  Guildford Buckingham Edgehill Charlcot  the seat of the  Lucies Warwick  and  Kenelworth  and passed through  Coventry Atherston  and  Temworth  to  Downing  At  Buckingham  I narrowly escaped a death suited to an antiquary I visited the old church at o'clock in the morning of  March  the th It fell before in the afternoon and I escaped being buried in its ruins  ON  July  the th I took the route of  Oultonhall Winnington  and  Durham  in  Cheshire  visited  Manchester Buxton Bakewell Haddonhall Matlock Nottingham Southwell Newark  and  Lincoln  Near  Horncastle  I entered the  Paisbas  of  Great Britain  I visited  Tatersale  and  Boston Spalding Crowlandabby Stamford Burleighhouse Castor  and  Peterborough Whittleseamarsh  and  Ely Newmarket St Edmundsbury  the reverend Mr  Ashby  at  Barrow Cambridge Ware  and  Walthamabby  passed a day with Mr  Gough  at  Enfield  and concluded my tour in the capital  IN this journey  Moses Griffith  made some of his most beautiful drawings in the line of antiquity of several of the most elegant parts of the  gothic  architecture in the magnificent cathedral at  Lincoln  and also a few of the grosser figures in the  Saxon  remains of the west front and at  Southwell  he drew the exquisite interior of the matchless chapter one of the lightest and most elegant productions of the  gothic  chizel which we can boast of I wish my time would permit me to make a catalogue  of the performances of  Moses Griffith  I never should deny copies of them to any gentleman who would make a dignified use of them  BROWN's ILLUSTRATION OF NATURAL HISTORY  IN this year  Peter Brown  a  Dane  by birth and a very neat limner published his illustrations of natural history in large quarto with L plates At my recommendation Mr  Loten  lent to him the greatest part of the drawings to be engraven being of birds painted in  India  I patronized  Brown  drew up the greatest part of the descriptions for him but had not the lest concern in the preface  IN Mr  White  published a new edition of the three volumes of the  British Zoology  in quarto and in octavo and inserted in them the ciii additional plates published in  TOUR IN KENT  IN the spring of the year I made an excursion from town to  Canterbury  along the post road and digressed from  Canterbury  to  Sandwich  and from thence to  Deal  and by  St Margaret  's church and  Cliff  to  Dover  In this tour I had the happiness of making acquaintance with Mr  Latham  of  Dartford  Mr  Jacobs  of  Feversham  and Mr  Boys  of  Sandwich  all persons of distinguished merit in the study of natural history and antiquities  IN that year I published a fourth volume of the  British Zoology  which contained the  Vermes  the  Crustaceous  and  Testaceous  animals of our country this was published in quarto and octavo and illustrated with xciii plates  To this volume I prefixed a most merited eulogy on my respected friend  Benjamin Stillingfleet  esq who died  Dec  th at his lodgings in  Piccadilly  aged His public and private character might demand this tribute but the many  personal acts of friendship I received from that most amiable man was an irresistible incitement to me to erect this small but very inadequate monument of gratitude  TOUR IN WALES  AFTER several journies over the six counties of  North Wales  in which I collected ample materials for their history I flung them in the form of a tour and published the first volume in quarto    with xxvi plates in  SECOND VOLUME  IN the first part of the second volume of the same tour appeared under the title of  A Journey to Snowdon  with xi plates a frontispiece and vignets The second part soon followed with xv plates and a large appendix which completed the work In all my journies through  Wales  I was attended by my friend the reverend  John Lloyd  a native of  Llanarmon  and rector of  Caerwis  to his great skill in the language and antiquities of our country I own myself much indebted for without his assistance many things might have escaped me and many errors crept into my labors  MOSES GRIFFITH's SUPPLEMENTAL PLATES  Moses Griffith  engraved a Supplement of x plates to which I added a little preface and a few explanatory pages Besides these proofs of his ingenuity he etched several other private plates such as about a dozen  North American  birds two beautiful parts of  Fountainsabby  and a few other things  HISTORY OF QUADRUPEDS  IN this year I also published a new edition of my  Synopsis of Quadrupeds  in two volumes quarto with lii plates including the xxxi from the Synopsis which received considerable improvements and corrections from the correspondence of my friend the illustrious  Pallas  who bestowed a long series of letters on this alone this he performed as it was a favorite work of his and by accident transferred from his to my inferior pen  To Mr  Zimmerman  I was greatly indebted for several important improvements from his able performance the  Zoologia Geographica  as well as great information from his frequent letters It is unbecoming in me to express the partiality which that eminant writer and other of my foreign friends have shewn towards me if the reader has the curiosity to learn their opinion of me he may consult Mr ZIMMERMAN's  Zoologia Geographica  p The rev Mr Cox in vol II p of his travels quarto edition hath recorded the compliment paid to me by LINNAEUS and PALLAS in p of his  Nova Species Quadrupedum  hath dealt out his praise with much too liberal a hand  FREE THOUGHTS ON THE MILITIA LAWS  The liberties which the country gentlemen in the character of deputylieutenants and militiaofficers now and then took with their fellow subjects urged me strongly this year to publish  Free Thoughts on the Militia Laws  ON  Feb  the d I was elected honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries at  Edinburgh  OF THE TURKY  IN the  Philosophical Transactions  of was published my history and natural history of the  Turky  it had been doubted whether this was not a bird of the old world but I flatter myself that I have made it apparent that it is peculiar to  America  and was unknown before the discovery of that continent My respected friend Mr  Barrington  had taken the other side of the question but this was not published by me polemically or in any wise inimical to so excellent a character  To this paper is annexed an engraving of a singular  Lusus  the toe and claw of some rapacious bird growing on the thigh of a  Turky  bred in my poultry court  AT the request of Sir  Joseph Banks  I drew up an account of the several earthquakes I had felt in  Flintshire  and remarked they were never felt at the bottom of lead mines or coal pits in our country This paper was published in the year in volume lxxi of the  Philosophical Transactions  JOURNEY TO LONDON  IN I published my journey from  Chester  to  London  this was formed from journals made at different times in my way to town I frequently made a considerable stay at several places to give this book all the fulness and accuracy in my power This was republished in  Dublin  in in an octavo form  ON  June  the th    I was honored by my election into the  Societas Physiographica  at  Lund  in  Sweden  a favor I probably owed to my learned friend professor  Retzius  IN the same month and year I made a short elopement to meet the reverend doctor  Nash  Mrs and Miss  Nash  at  Shrewsbury  in order to make a partial voyage down the  Severn  My son met us from  Oxford  and we took boat at  Atchambridge  About four miles distant from  Salop  we were highly amused with the picturesque scenes especially those from  Buildas  to  Ombresley  We landed opposite to  Holmsflat  a little below that village and concluded our tour at  Beverey  the hospitable seat of doctor  Nash  about three miles distant  IN appeared my letter from a  Welsh  freeholder to his representative    to convert him from his political tenets My then opinion of the minister is daily vindicated  A WORK designed to comprehend the ZOOLOGY of  North America  had long employed my mind and my pen on which I intended to have bestowed that name but for the affecting reason  given in the advertisement prefixed to that work altered indeed from its original plan I thought myself under the necessity of changing the title I did so and after having considerably enlarged the work by the addition of the animals and history of the northern parts of  Europe  and  Asia  I this year gave it to the public under the title of the  Arctic Zoology  It consists of two volumes quarto  ARCTIC ZOOLOGY  the first contains a long introduction and Class I QUADRUPEDS the second Class II BIRDS In this work I received considerable improvements from the voyage of Sir  Joseph Banks  to  Newfoundland  in He added greatly to the ornithology by the communication of several new species of birds and several other subjects  GERMAN EDITION  THIS work was speedily translated into  German  by professor  Zimmerman  and published in two volumes quarto with the prints which I permitted to be taken from my plates The introduction was also translated into  French  FRENCH  under the title of  Le Nord du Globe  in two volumes octavo and what is peculiarly flattering to me is that as much as relates to the north of  Europe  is to be translated into  Swedish  as an introduction to the natural history of that celebrated seat of the votaries of the great  Cybele  THE  Arctic Zoology  gave occasion to my being honored in the year on  April  th by being elected member of the  American  Philosophical Society at  Philadelphia  in the presidentship of  David Rittenhouse  esq My labors relative to that vast continent were there favorably received but this honor I esteem as a reward above my merits There science of every kind begins to flourish among others that of natural history  in which branch I may predict that my correspondent and friend doctor  Benjamin Smith Barton  will soon rise into celebrity and to his pen I trust the many errors respecting the zoology of his native country will be corrected with tenderness and candor In regard to the abilities of the society the volumes of its  Philosophical Transactions  already published are most incontestable proofs  IN this year came out a second edition of the first volume of my  Tour in Wales  IN  May  I had the distinguished honor of being elected member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at  Stockholm  In  Sweden  I am favored with the correspondence of doctor  Thunberg  of  Upsal  doctor  Sparman  of  Stockholm  Mr  Wilcke  of the same city and Mr  Odman  of  Wormden  not remote from  Stockholm  I must not forget a grateful tribute to the memory of departed friends to that of baron de  Geer  professor  Wallerius  and above all doctor  Solander  the last so distinguished by urbanity of manners and liberality of communication of the infinite knowlege he possessed  ON  Jan  the d I was elected honorary member of the society at  Edinburgh  for promoting of natural knowledge  ON  March  the th I received the same honor from the Society of Antiquaries at  Perth  AND on  December  the th was honored by being elected member of the Agriculture Society at  Odiham  in  Hampshire  SUPPLEMENT TO THE ARCTIC ZOOLOGY  IN I gave a Supplement to the  Arctic Zoology  it contains several additions and corrections which I owe to the friendship of my several northern correspondents and a systematic  account of the reptiles and fishes of  North America  together with two very beautiful maps of the countries I had treated of in the introduction corrected since the first publication engraven by that excellent artist Mr  William Palmer  TOUR TO THE LAND'S END  EVER since the year I had quite lost my spirit of rambling Another happy nuptial connection suppressed every desire to leave my fireside But in the spring of this year I was induced once more to renew my journies My son had returned from his first tour to the continent so much to my satisfaction that I was determined to give him every advantage that might qualify him for a second which he was on the point of taking over the kingdoms of  France  and  Spain  I wished him to make a comparison of the naval strength and commercial advantages and disadvantages of our island with those of her two powerful rivals I attended him down the  Thames  visited all our docks and by land from  Dartford  followed the whole coast to the very  Land's End  On his return from his second tour I had great reason to boast that this excursion was not thrown away as to myself it was a painful one long absence from my family was so new to me that I may sincerely say it cast an anxiety over the whole journey  THESE were my greater labors I at several times gave to the public some trifles which were not illreceived but few knew the author These I collected some years ago  MISCELLANIES  and printed for the amusement of a few friends thirty copies by the friendly press of  George Allan  esq at  Darlington  HISTORY OF THE PATAGONIANS  THE principal was my history of the  Patagonians  collected from the account given by father  Faulkner  in and from the several histories of those people by various writers I believe  that the authenticity of the several relaters is now very well established This was printed at the same press in  BESIDES these may be added the  ode on indifference  and the verses on the lady being chosen patroness of a hunt and bookclub in the same day  AN essay on the improper behaviour of married ladies towards our sex  A RIDICULE on the bold and masculine fashion of the ladies wearing ridinghabits at all times of the day which was republished in by Mr  Smith  with a good mezzotinto of a modern toilet  AMERICAN annals an incitement to parlementmen to inquire into the conduct of our commanders in the  American  war I omit this paper unwilling to revive the memory of the most deplorable event in all the annals of  Great Britain  THE  Flintshire  petition The discontents of the year were grown to such a height that the county of  Flint  took share in the attempt to produce a redress of grievances I wished to allay the popular fury as far as in me lay because numbers of the complaints were excited by that bane of this kingdom in all ages pretended patriots I formed a speech which I had not courage enough to speak so printed the lenitive intention as certainly it could do me no discredit The event shewed that impossibilities were attempted and that soon as the patriots got into power no more was thought of the plan once urged with much violence  AN inscription over the entrance of the new gaol at  Flint  is printed in Mr  Howard  's account of the principal  Lazarettos  in  Europe  THE following grateful epitaph in memory of my faithful  servant and friend  Louis Gold  may be seen on a small brass plate in  Whiteford  church close to which he was interred  August  the d  This small Monument of esteem was erected by his lamenting Master in Memory of LOUIS GOLD a Norman by Birth and above twenty years the faithful Servant and Friend of THOMAS PENNANT Esq of Downing In his various services he made considerable savings which he disposed of by his last will having no relations of his own with affection to his friends and to his fellowservants with unmerited gratitude to his Master and his family and with piety to the poor Every duty of his humble station and every duty of life he discharged so fully That when the day shall come which levels all distinction of ranks He may By the favour of our blessed Mediator hear these joyful words  "Well done thou good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of thy Lord" He was born at St Hermes de Rouvelle in Normandy August died at Downing August and was interred in the Churchyard near this wall on the d of the same month  PREVIOUS to this I could not in the warmth of my heart resist giving in one of the  Chester  papers the following paragraph as a notification of his death  SATURDAY se'nnight in the morning died at  Downing  in  Flintshire Louis Gold  a  Norman  by birth and above twenty years the faithful servant and friend of  Thomas Pennant  of that place esq He left the savings of his different services which were very considerable to several of his friends his fellowservants and to the poor and bequeathed to his lamenting master and his four children handsome remembrances of his affection for them the remainder to be applied at the discretion of his executor to charitable uses  ACCOUNT OF LONDON  THIS spring I published an account of our capital I had so often walked about the several parts of  London  with my notebook in my hand that I could not help forming considerable collections of materials The public received this work with the utmost avidity It went through three large impressions in about two years and a half The first in  April  the second in  January  and the third in the latter end of the last year Many additions were made to the second together with three more plates by the persuasion of that worthy  character  William Seward  esq One was of the bust of  Charles  I by  Bernini  which stood over one of the doors in  Westminsterhall  but was removed on the preparations for the trial of Mr  Hastings  I wish the drawing had been better executed  IN this year Mr  White  sent into the world a fifth edition of my  Tours in Scotland  with several additions and corrections  I AM often astonished at the multiplicity of my publications especially when I reflect on the various duties it has fallen to my lot to discharge As father of a family landlord of a small but very numerous tenantry and a not inactive magistrate I had a great share of health during the literary part of my days much of this was owing to the riding exercise of my extensive tours to my manner of living and to my temperance I go to rest at ten and rise winter and summer at seven and shave regular at the same hour being a true  misopogon  I avoid the meal of excess a supper and my soul rises with vigour to its employs and I trust does not disappoint the end of its Creator  Quin corpus onustum  Hesternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat una  Atque affigit humo divinae particulam aurae  Alter ubi dicto citiùs curata sopori  Membra dedit vegetus praescripta ad munia surgit  Behold how pale the seated guests arise  From suppers puzzled with varieties  The body too with yesterday's excess  Burthen'd and tir'd shall the pure soul depress  Weigh down this portion of celestial birth  This breath of God and fix it to the earth  So far respects my own labors it will be but just to mention  those of others  OF OTHERS' WORKS PROMOTED BY ME  which have been produced by my countenance and patronage for I never can be accused of witholding my communications or my mite to assist my brethren who have wished to assume the perilous characters of authors  DOCTOR JOHN REINHOLD FORSTER  I VERY early after the arrival of doctor  John Reinhold Forster  had opportunity of introducing him to several of my friends which proved of no small service to him during his residence in this kingdom At my persuasion and by my encouragement he translated  Kalm's Voyage into North America  which was published in in three volumes octavo  IN he published  Osbeck's Voyage to China  with that of  Torcen  and  Eckberg  's account of the  Chinese  husbandry in two volumes  HE also added a second volume to his translation of  Bossu  's  Travels in Louisiana  containing the life of  Loefling  and a catalogue of  Spanish  plants and those of part of  Spanish America  By these the works of three of the most eminent disciples of the  Linnaean  school have been made known to the  British  nation  I PUBLISHED at much expence in the  Flora Scotica  in two volumes octavo with xxxvii plates This was the elaborate work of my worthy friend and fellow traveller the rev Mr  Lightfoot  REV JOHN LIGHTFOOT  The lamented loss of that admirable botanist on  February  th I have related in a short account printed to be given to the purchasers of the remaining copies of the  Flora Scotica  MR GOUGH  THAT indefatigable topographer  Richard Gough  esq paid me the compliment of submitting the sheets of his edition of  Camden  which related to  North Wales  to my correction and  I flatter myself that they would not have come out of my hands unimproved To him I also communicated several of my manuscript journals which I flatter myself might in some small degree contribute to the improvement of our venerable topographer  REV CHARLES CORDINER  As it was my wish that no part of  North Britain  or its islands should be left unexplored or any of their advantage lost for want of notice I supported the reverend  Charles Cordiner  episcopal minister at  Banff  in a journey over the countries north of  Loch Broom  which I was obliged to desist from attempting this he performed much to my satisfaction in I published his journal entitled  Antiquities and Scenery of the North of Scotland  at my own hazard It is illustrated with xxii plates taken from drawings by the skilful pencil of that ingenious traveller The work succeeded I made him a present of the expences which attended his journey  NUMBERS of other subjects of antiquities views and natural history are now in publication by the same gentleman  REV GEORGE LOW  I WAS actuated by the same zeal in respect to the extreme islands of the same parts of our kingdom In the reverend Mr  George Low  minister of  Birsa  in the  Orknies  I met with a gentleman willing to undertake the visitation of those islands and of the  Schetlands  and to communicate to me his observations of every thing he imagined would be of use to the kingdom or afford me pleasure His surveys were made in the years and and he favored me with a most instructive journal and several drawings It was my wish to publish his voyages as I had the travels of Mr  Cordiner  but certain reasons discouraged me This ought not to be considered as  any reflection on the performance Mr  Low  gives a good account of the natural history and antiquities of the several islands enters deeply into their fisheries and commercial concerns and on the whole is highly worthy the attention of the public  I CANNOT help mentioning the services I did to the professors of the art of engraving by the multitude of plates performed by them for my several works let me enumerate the particulars and total  British Zoology  folio  British Zoology  octavo or quarto  History of Quadrupeds    Tour in Scotland  the three volumes  Journey to London    Tour in Wales  two volumes  Moses Griffith's  Supplemental Plates  Some Account of London  second edition  Indian Zoology  second edition  Genera of Birds    Arctic Zoology  two volumes  Systematic Index to de Buffon    The Rev Mr  John Lightfoot's Flora Scotica  two volumes    IF I have omitted Mr  John Ingleby  of  Halkin Flintshire  I did not do justice to a very neat drawer I have often profited of his services and many of the private copies of my works have been highly ornamented by his labors  NOTWITHSTANDING my authorial career was finished on the preceding year yet no small trouble attends my past labors The public continues to flatter me with demands for new editions of my works to the correction and improvement of which I am obliged to pay considerable attention Early this year appeared a new edition of my account of  London  ACCOUNT OF LONDON THIRD EDITION  as I have mentioned at p  NONE of my acquaintance will deny that I write a most illegible hand In order to deliver my labors intelligible to posterity on  January  st of this year I took into my service as secretary  Thomas  the son of  Roger Jones  our parishclerk a worthy sober and steady young man I determined to profit of his excellent handwriting to copy my several manuscripts and he has discharged his duty very much to my satisfaction  HISTORY OF QUADRUPEDS THIRD EDITION  MR  White  at the latter end of this year printed a third edition of my  History of Quadrupeds  with most of the old plates reengraven and several new ones This work was always a favorite one of mine I bestowed very true pains on it and added I may say every new animal which has to this time reached the knowlege of the naturalists  LETTER ON MAIL COACHES  IN the spring of the same year appeared my letter on  Mail Coaches  I was irresistibly compelled to resume my pen from the oppressions which the poor labored under by the demands made on them to repair the roads for the passage of the mails with a nicety and at an expence beyond their powers Let the little performance speak my apology for the publication  INDIAN ZOOLOGY SECOND EDITION  IN this year came out a second edition of my  Indian Zoology  see p but very considerably enlarged by doctor  Forster  's essay prefixed to the  German  edition of that work which was translated by doctor  Aikin  and by a tolerably complete  Faunula  a labor taken off my hands principally by the friendship of the rev Mr  Hugh Davies  and Mr  Latham  the  Faunula  of insects fell to Mr  Latham  and cost him no small pains  THUS far has passed my active life even till the present year in which I have advanced half way of my th year My body may have abated of its wonted vigour but my mind still retains its powers its longing after improvements its wish to receive new lights through chinks which time hath made  A FEW years ago I grew fond of imaginary tours and determined on one to climes more suited to my years more genial than that to the frozen north I still found or fancied that I found  OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE  abilities to direct my pen I determined on a voyage to  India  formed exactly on the plan of the Introduction to the  Arctic Zoology  which commences at such parts of the north as are accessible to mortals From  London  I follow the coasts southern to part of our island and from  Calais  along the oceanic shores of  Europe Africa  and  Asia  till I have attained those of  New Guinea  Respecting these I have collected every information possible from books antient and modern from the most authentic and from living travellers of the most respectable characters of my time I mingle history natural history accounts of the coasts climates and every thing which I thought could instruct or amuse They are written on imperial quarto and when bound make a folio of no inconsiderable size and are illustrated at a vast expence by prints taken from books or  by charts and maps and by drawings by the skilful hand of  Moses Griffith  and by presents from friends With the bare possibility of the volume relative to  India  none of these books are to be printed in my lifetime but to rest on my shelves the amusement of my advancing age The following is the catalogue of these labors all excepting the first composed in the space of four years all which will be comprehended under the general title of OUTLINES OF THE GLOBE  ARCTIC REGIONS  VOL I will contain the Introduction to the  Arctic Zoology  with considerable additions in order to make it unite hereafter with  China  which will be comprehended in the xiiith volume but this first volume will also be augmented very greatly by accounts of the internal parts of the country and with the countries to the south as low as lat to comprehend the great rivers of the north of  Europe  and  Asia  not only the coasts but the internal parts of the United States of  America  will be described as also our poor remnant as far as the mouth of the  Mississippi  and each side of that vast river as high as its source The plates will be of new subjects and executed by the first engravers of the time the size of the books that of  Cook's Voyages  I feel an inclination to have one volume published in my life as a model for the remaining twelve It was impossible to omit this  arctic  volume otherwise the work would have been very imperfect  KENTISH TOUN  VOL II describes a tour commencing at the  Templestairs  comprehending my passage down the  Thames  as low as  Dartford Creek  and from thence to  Dover  FRANCE  VOL III and IV The voyage along the coasts of  France  from  Calais  to the frontiers of  Spain  with a digression up the  Loire  as far as  Orelans  and a second digression from the  Garonne  near  Toulouse  above  Bourdeaux  along the great canal  de Languedoc  to its junction with the  Mediterranean  sea near  Sette  and a third from  Andaye  along the  French  side of the  Pyrenecs  as far as its termination on the same sea  STAIN AND PORTUGAL  VOL V comprehends the coast of  Spain  from the  Bidassao  to the borders of  Portugal  the whole coast of  Portugal  after which those of  Spain  are resumed and continued to the Streights of  Gibraltar  and its celebrated rock This volume is particularly rich in drawings by  Moses Griffith  of the birds and fishes of  Gibraltar  communicated to me by the rev the late Mr  John White  long resident in that fortress  SOUTHERN FRANCE  VOL VI contains the entrance into the  Mediterranean  sea and the southern coasts of  Spain  to the borders of  Italy  at  Nice  comprehending the coasts of southern  France  MR IGNATIUS D'ASSO  MR  Ignatius d'Asso  of  Sarragossa  author of the  Zoologia Aragoniae  and  Flora  of the same country by his intelligent correspondence from the year to the year furnished me with several very instructive materials for the natural history of  Spain  which were of considerable service in my account of that kingdom I cannot quit the subject of the four last volumes without I trust a most venial exultation at the source from whence I drew a considerable part of my account of the coasts of the kingdoms of  France  and  Spain  and also of some of the interior country It would perhaps be affected but it certainly would be unnatural to suppress acknowlegements which spring warmed from my heart because I pay them to a son  David Pennant  began his travels into foreign parts in  August

vindication Happy is the age that could thus beguile its fleeting hours without injury to any one and with the addition of years continue to rise in its pursuits But more interesting and still more exalted subjects must employ my future span  APPENDIX N  o    TO THE HONORABLE DAINES BARRINGTON  DEAR SIR  I NOW execute the promise I made in town some time ago of communicating to you the result of my visit to Mr  Falkener  an antient jesuit who had passed thirtyeight years of his life in the southern part of  South America  between the river  la Plata  and the streights of  Magellan  Let me endeavor to prejudice you in favor of my new friend by assuring you that by his long intercourse with the inhabitants of  Patagonia  he seems to have lost all  European  guile and to have acquired all the simplicity and honest impetuosity of the people he has been so long conversant with I venture to give you only as much of his narrative as he could vouch for the authenticity of which consists of such facts as he was eyewitness to and such as will I believe establish past contradiction the veracity of our late circumnavigators  navigators and give new lights into the manners of this singular race of men it will not I flatter myself be deemed impertinent to lay before you a chronological mention of the several evidences that will tend to prove the existence of a people of a supernatural height inhabiting the southern tract You will find that the majority of voyagers who have touched on that coast have seen them and made reports of their size that will very well keep in countenance the verbal account given by Mr  Byron  and the printed by Mr  Clarke  you will observe that if the old voyagers did exaggerate it was through the novelty and amazement at so singular a sight but the latter forewarned by the preceding accounts seem to have made their remarks with coolness and confirmed them by the experiment of measurement  A D The first who saw these people was the great  Magellan  one of them just made his appearance on the banks of the river  la Plata  and then made his retreat but during  Magellan  's long stay at  Port St Julian  he was visited by numbers of this tall race The first approached him singing and flinging the dust over his head and shewed all signs of a mild and peaceable disposition his visage was painted his garment the skin of some animal neatly sewed his arms a stout and thick bow a quiver of long arrows feathered at one end and armed at the other with flint The height of these people was about seven feet  French  but they were not so tall as the person who approached them first who is represented to have been of so gigantic a size that  Magellan  's men did not with their heads reach as high as the waist of this  Patagonian  They had with them beasts of burden on which they placed their wives by  Magellan  's description of them they appear to have been the animals now known by the name of  Llama  THESE interviews ended with the captivating two of the people who were carried away in two different ships but as soon as they arrived in the hot climate each of them died  I DWELL the longer on this account as it appears extremely deserving of credit as the courage of  Magellan  made him incapable of giving an exaggerated account through the influence of sear nor could there be any mistake about the height as he had not only a long intercourse with them but the actual possession of two for a very considerable space of time  Vide  Ramusios  Coll Voyages  Venice  also the letter of  Maximilian Transylvanus  Sec to  Charles  V and in the st vol p A and B  It was  Magellan  who first gave them the name of  Patagons  because they wore a sort of slipper made of the skin of animals  Tellement  says  M de Brosse  This account as well as the others where I do not quote my authority are taken from that judicious writer  M de Brosse  quils  paroissoit avoir des pattes de Bêtes  IN  Garcia de Louisa  saw within the streights of  Magellan  savages of a very great stature but he does not particularise their height  AFTER  Louisa  the same streights were passed in by  Simon de Alcazova  and attempted in by  Alphonso de Camargo  but without being visited by our tall people  THE same happened to our countryman sir  Francis Drake  but because it was not the fortune of that able and popular seaman  to meet with these gigantic people his contemporaries considered the report as the invention of the  Spaniards  IN  Pedro Sarmiento  asserts that those he saw were three ells high This is a writer I would never venture to quote singly for he destroys his own credibility by saying the savage he made prisoner was an errant  Cyclops  I only cite him to prove that he had fell in with a tall race though he mixes fable with truth  IN our countryman sir  Thomas Cavendish  in his voyage had only opportunity of measuring one of their footsteps which was eighteen inches long he also found their graves and mentions their customs of burying near the shore  Purchas  i  IN  Anthony Knevet  who sailed with sir  Thomas Cavendish  in his second voyage relates that he saw at  Port Desire  men fifteen or sixteen spans high and that he measured the bodies of two that had been recently buried which were fourteen spans long  Purchas  i    Sebald de Veert  who sailed with admiral  de Cordes  was attacked in the streight  Magellan  by savages whom he thought to be ten or eleven feet high he adds that they were of reddish color and had long hair  Col Voy by the  Dutch East India  company c  London  p  IN the same year  Oliver du Nort  a  Dutch  admiral had a rencontre with this gigantic race whom he represents to be of a high stature and of a terrible aspect    George Spilbergen  another  Dutchman  in his passage through the same streight saw a man of a gigantic stature climbing a hill as if to take a view of the ship  Purchas  i    Le Maire  and  Schouten  discovered some of the burying places of the  Patagonians  beneath heaps of great stones and found in them skeletons ten or eleven feet long  Ibid i  MR  Falkener  supposes that formerly there existed a race of  Patagonians  superior to these in size for skeletons are often found of far greater dimensions particularly about the river  Texeira  Perhaps he may have heard of the old tradition of the natives mentioned by  Cieza  Seventeen years travels of  Peter de Cieza    and repeated from him by  Garcilasso de la Vega  Translated by  Ricaut  p  of certain giants having come by sea and landed near the  Cape of St Helena  many ages before the arrival of the  Europeans    Gracias de Nodal  a  Spanish  commander in the course of his voyage was informed by  John Moore  one of his crew who landed between  Cape St Esprit  and  Cape St Arenas  on the south side of the streights that he trafficked with a race of men taller by the head than the  Europeans  This and the next are the only instances I ever met with of the tall race being found on that side of the streights    Henry Brewer  a  Dutch  admiral observed in the streights  le Maire  the footsteps of men which measured eighteen inches this is the last evidence in the th century of the existence  of these tall people but let it be observed that out of the fifteen first voyagers who passed through the  Magellanic  streights not sewer than nine are undeniable witnesses of the fact we would establish  IN the present century I can produce but two evidences of the existence of the tall  Patagonians  The one in when the crew of a ship belonging to  St Maloes  commanded by captain  Harrington  saw seven of these giants in  Gregory  bay Mention is also made of six more being seen by captain  Carman  a native of the same town but whether in the same voyage my authority is silent  Frezier's Voy    BUT as it was not the fortune of the four other voyagers  Sir  John Narborough  in  Bartholomew Sharp  in  De Gennes  in and  Beauchesne Gouin  in  who sailed through the streights in the th century to fall in with any of this tall race it became a fashion to treat as fabulous the account of the preceding nine and to hold this lofty race as the mere creation of a warm imagination  IN such a temper was the public on the return of Mr  Byron  from his circumnavigation in the year I had not the honor of having personal conference with that gentleman therefore will not repeat the accounts I have been informed he had given to several of his friends I rather chuse to recapitulate that given by Mr  Clarke  This able officer commanded the  Discovery  in captain  Cook  's last voyage and died off  Kamtschatka August    in the  Philosophical Transactions  for p Mr  Clarke  was officer in Mr  Byron  's ship landed with him in the streights of  Magellan  and had for two  hours an opportunity of standing within a few yards of this race and seeing them examined and measured by Mr  Byron  He represents them in general as stout and well proportioned and assures us that none of the men were lower than eight feet and that some even exceeded nine and that the women were from seven feet and an half to eight feet He saw Mr  Byron  measure one of the men and notwithstanding the commodore was near six feet high he could when on tiptoe but just reach with his hand the top of the  Patagonian  's head and Mr  Clarke  is certain that there were several taller than him on whom the experiment was made for there were about five hundred men women and children They seemed very happy at the landing of our people and expressed their joy by a rude sort of singing They were of a copper color and had long lank hair and faces hideously painted both sexes were covered with skins and some appeared on horseback and others on foot  M de Premontel  makes this an object of ridicule as if the size of the horses were unequal to the burden of the riders Our navigators tell us that the horses were fifteen or sixteen hands high It is well known that a millhorse has been known to carry nine hundred and ten pounds a weight probably beyon that of any  Patagonian  they saw  A FEW had on their legs a sort of boot with a sharppointed stick at the heel instead of a spur Their bridles were made of thong the bit wood the saddle as artless as possible and without stirrups The introduction of horses into these parts by the  Europeans  introduced likewise the only species of manufacture they appear to be acquainted with All their skill seems to extend no farther than these rude essays at a harness  and to equip themselves for  Cavaliers  In other respects they would be in the same state as our first parents just turned out of paradise cloathed in coats of skins or at best in the same condition in which  Caesar  found the ancient  Britons  for their dress was similar their hair long and their bodies like those of our ancestors made terrific by wild painting These people by some means or other had acquired a few beads and bracelets otherwise not a single article of  European  fabric appeared among them These they must have gotten by the intercourse with the other  Indian  tribes for had they had any intercourse with the  Spaniards  they never would have neglected procuring knives the stirrups and other conveniences which the people seen by Mr  Wallis  had  I SHOULD have been glad to have closed in this place the relations of this stupendous race of mankind because the two following accounts given by gentlemen of character and abilities seem to contradict great part of what had been before advanced or at lest serve to give scoffers room to say that the preceding navigators had seen these people through the medium of magnifying glasses instead of the sober eye of observation but before I make my remarks on what has been before related I shall proceed with the other navigators and then attempt to reconcile the different accounts In captain  Wallis  of the  Dolphin  and captain  Philip Carteret  of the  Swallow  sloop saw and measured with a pole several of the  Patagonians  who happened to be in the streights of  Magellan  during his passage  Phil Trans  p  Hawkesworth's Voy  i  he represents them as a fine and friendly people cloathed in skins  and on their legs a sort of boots and many of them tied their hair which was long and black with a sort of woven stuff of the breadth of a garter made of some kind of wool That their arms were slings formed of two round balls fastened one to each end of a cord which they fling with great force and dexterity He adds they hold one ball in their hand and swing the other at the full length of the cord round their head by which it acquires a prodigious velocity they will fling it to a great distance and with such exactness as to strike a very small object These people were also mounted on horses their saddles bridles c were of their own making some had iron and others metal bits to their bridles and one had a  Spanish  broad sword but whether the last articles were taken by war or procurred by commerce is uncertain but the last is most probable It seems evident that they had intercourse with  Europeans  and had even adopted some of their fashions for many had cut their dress into form of  Spanish Punchos  or a square piece of cloth with a hole cut for the head the rest hanging loose as low as the knees They also wore drawers so these people had attained a few steps farther towards civilisation than their gigantic neighbors others again will appear to have made a far greater advance for these still devoured their meat raw and drank nothing but water  M Bougainville  in the same year saw another party of the natives of  Patagonia  he measured several of them and declares that none were lower than five feet five inches  French  or taller than five feet ten  i e  five feet ten or six feet three  English  measure He concludes his account with saying that he afterwards  met with a taller people in the South Sea but I do not recollect that he mentions the place  I AM sorry to be obliged to remark in these voyages a very illiberal propensity to cavil at and invalidate the account given by Mr  Byron  but at the same time exult in having had an opportunity given me by that gentleman of vindicating his and the national honor  M Bougainville  in order to prove he fell in with the identical people that Mr  Byron  conversed with asserts that he saw numbers of them possessed of knives of an  English  manufactory certainly given them by Mr  Byron  but he should have considered that there are more ways than one of coming at a thing that the commerce between  Sheffield  and  South America  through the port of  Cadiz  is most uncommonly large and that his  Indians  might have got their knives from the  Spaniards  at the same time that they got their gilt nails and  Spanish  harness but for farther satisfaction on this subject I have liberty to say from Mr  Byron  's authority that he never gave a single knife to the people he saw that he had not one at that time about him that excepting the presents given with his own hands and the tobacco brought by lieutenant  Cummins  not the lest trifle was bestowed I am furnished with one other proof that these lesser  Indians  whom Mr  Wallis  saw were not the same with those described by Mr  Byron  as has been insinuated for the first had with him some officers who had been with him on the preceding voyage and who bear witness not only to the difference of size but declare that these people had not a single article among them given by Mr  Byron  See Mr  Byron  's letter at the end  It is extremely probable  that these were the  Indians  that Mr  Bougainville  fell in with for they were furnished with bits a  Spanish  scymeter and brass stirrups as before mentioned  My last evidence of these gigantic  Americans  is that which I received from Mr  Falkener  he acquainted me that about the year he was sent on a mission to the vast plains of  Pampas  which if I recollect right lie to the southwest of  Buenos Ayres  and extend near a thousand miles towards the  Andes  In these plains he first met with some tribes of these people and was taken under the protection of one of the  Caziques  The remarks he made on their size were as follows that the tallest which he measured in the same manner that Mr  Byron  did was seven feet eight inches high that the common height or middle size was six feet that there were numbers that were even shorter and that the tallest women did not exceed six feet That they were scattered from the foot of the  Andes  over that vast tract which extends to the  Atlantic Ocean  and are found as far as the  Red River  at  Bay Anagada  lat below that the land is too barren to be habitable and none are found except accidental migrants till you arrive at the river  Gallego  near the streights of  Magellan  THEY are supposed to be a race derived from the  Chilian Indians  the  Puelches  who inhabited the eastern side of the  Andes  the same brave nation who defeated and destroyed the avaricious  Spaniard Baldivia  but after that were dispossessed of their seat  THEY dwell in large tents covered with the hides of mares and divided within into apartments for the different ranks of the family by a sort of blanketing They are a most migratory  people and often shift their quarters when the women strike the tents assist in putting them on their horses and like the females of all savage countries undergo all the laborious work  THEY have two motives for shifting their quarters one for the sake of getting salt which they find incrusted in the shallow pools near the sea side  THE other inducement is the superstition they have of burying their dead within a certain distance of the ocean And I may certainly add a third that of the necessity they must lie under of seeking fresh quarters on account of the chace which is their principal subsistence  THOSE who deny the existence of these great people never consider the migratory nature of the inhabitants of this prodigious tract and never reflect that the tribes who may have been seen this month on the coast may the next be some hundreds of miles inland and their place occupied by a tribe or nation totally different These gentlemen seem to lay down as a certain position that  Patagonia  is peopled by only a single nation and from that false principle they draw their arguments sneer insult and even grossly abuse all that differ in opinion Among the most illiberal of these writers is  M de Premontal  who with the rapid ingenuity of his country mounts on his headstrong courser PREJUDICE sets off full speed rides over all the honest fellows that would inform him of his road and spurns even Truth herself though she offers to be his guide but truth is unadorned and hated by this fantastic writer it would spoil him of all the flowers of fiction and tropes of abuse against a rival country and would teach him facts that would ruin his argument  and reduce his eloquent  memoire  to a single narrative of uncontested veracity  THEIR food is almost entirely animal the flesh of horses oxen guanacoes and ostriches all of which they eat roasted or boiled Their drink is water except in the season when certain species of fruit are ripe for of those they make a sort of fermenting liquor called  Chucha  common to many parts of  South America  One kind is made of a podded fruit called  Algarrova  which smells like a bug and when bruised in water becomes an inebriating liquor The same fruit is also eaten as bread The other  Chucha  is made of the  Molie  a small fruit hot and sweet in the mouth both these cause a deep drunkenness especially the last which excites a phrenetic inebriation and a wildness of eyes which lasts two or three days  THE cloathing of these people is either a mantle of skins or of a woollen  The  Puelches  have no sheep but what they purchase from the  Voluches  who inhabit the  Andes  cultivate sheep and raise corn the wool is equally fine with that of  Old Spain  cloth manufactured by themselves some is so strong and compact as even to hold water the color is various for some are striped and dyed with the richest red made of cochineal and certain roots They wear a short apron before which is tucked between the legs and preserves a modest appearance They never wear feathered ornaments except in their dances Their hair is long and tied up with a fillet They have naturally beards  M Premontal  roundly asserts that they have no beards  but they generally pluck up the hairs not but some leave mustaches as was observed by Mr  Carteret  and  M Bougainville  WHEN they go to war they wear a fourfold coat of the skin of the  Tapiir  a cap of bull's hide doubled and a broad target of the same Their offensive weapons are bows and arrows the last headed with bone lances headed with iron and broad swords both which they procure from the  Spaniards  but their native weapons are slings of these they have two kinds one for war which consists of a thong headed with stone at only one end and during their campaigns they carry numbers of these wrapped about their bodies  THE slings which they use in the chace of horses cattle or ostriches have a stone fixed to each end and sometimes another thong with a third stone is fastened to the middle of the other these with amazing dexterity they fling round the objects of the chace be they beasts or ostriches which entangle them so that they cannot stir The  Indians  leave them I may say thus tied neck and heels and go on in pursuit of fresh game and having finished their sport return to the animals they left secured in the slings  THEIR wars are chiefly with the other  Indians  for  Patagonia  is inhabited by variety of people not a single nation They have a great deal of intercourse with the  Spaniards  and often come down to  Buenos Ayres  to trade for iron bugles c  THIS commerce with the  Europeans  has corrupted them greatly taught them the vice of dramdrinking and been a dreadful obstacle to their moral improvement Mr  Falkener  informed me that he once prevaled on about five hundred to form a reduction but that they grew unruly and ungovernable as soon as the  Spanish  traders got among them  THEIR war and their chace are carried on on horseback for  they are most expert riders and have multitudes of horses with which the country is perfectly overrun for they go in herds of thousands The price of a horse at present is two dollars or s and d provided it has been broken About the year  Garcilasse de la Vega    Engl  translation  near the time of the conquest of  Peru  the common price of one was from four to six thousand to ten thousand  Pesos  Pesos  in the original perhaps  Pesos duros  which makes the above sum  or from £ to £  English  THE venereal distemper is common among them They do not speak of it as an exotic disorder so probably it is aboriginal  IN respect to religion they allow two principles a good and a bad  M de Premontal  is clear they have no sort of religion  The good they call the Creator of all things but consider him as one that after that never solicits himself about them He is styled by some  Soucha  or chief in the land of strong drink by others  Gauyaracunnee  or Lord of the dead The evil principle is called  Hueccovoe  or the wanderer without Sometimes these for there are several are supposed to preside over particular persons protect their own people or injure others These are likewise called  Valichu  or dwellers in the air  THEY have priests and priestesses whose office is to mediate with these beings in case of sickness or any distress by the intervention of the priest they are consulted about future events at those seasons the priest shuts himself up and falls into a phrenetic  extacy  The pretenders to second sight in the  Hebrides  and the  Awenyddion  or the  Inspired  among the  Welch  are seized with the same extasies  and appears epileptic If he gives a wrong answer he lays the fault on the evil principle who he says had deceived him by not coming in person but only sent one of his slaves At these times the great people assemble about the cabin from whence the oracle is to be delivered waiting its report with great anxiety  IF a  Cazique  dies or any public calamity happens for example in particular when the smallpox had made great ravages among the tribes the priests are sure to suffer for the misfortune is presumed to have happened through their neglect in not deprecating the evil in these cases they have no other method of saving themselves but by laying the blame on others of their brethren  PRIESTS are chosen from among the young people the most effeminate they can find but those that are epileptic have always the preference and these dress in a female habit  THE  Puelches  have a notion of a future state and imagine that after death they are to be transported to a country where the fruits of inebriation are eternal there to live in immortal drunkenness or the perpetual chace of the ostrich  WHEN a person of eminence dies the most respectable woman in the place goes into the tent clears the body of all the intestines and scrapes off as much of the flesh from the bones as possible and then burns very carefully both that and the entrails when that is done the bones are buried till the rest of the flesh is quite decayed they are taken up within a year  and if any of the bones drop out of their places they are refixed and tied together and the whole formed into a perfect skeleton Thus complete it is packed up in a hide put on the back of a favorite horse of the deceased and then translated to the tomb of his ancestor perhaps miles distant and always within a small space from the sea  THE skeleton is then taken out and decked in its best robes and adorned with plumes and beads is placed sitting in a deep square pit parallel with those buried before with sword lance and other weapons placed by them and the skins of their horses stuffed and supported by stakes also accompany them The top of the pit is then covered with turf placed on transverse beams  A MATRON is appointed to attend these sepulchres whose office it is to keep the skeletons clean and to newclothe them annually  This account agrees with those given by  Lafitau  in most particulars vide  Moeurs des Sauvages  xi  I forgot to add that on depositing a skeleton in its tomb the  Puelches  make a libation of  Chucha  and like what I have heard of an honest  Spaniard  drink  Viva el morte  Long live the dead  THEY allow polygamy and marry promiscuously among other  Americans  they are allowed as many as three wives apiece but if any take more than that number he is esteemed a libertine and held in very little esteem  WIDOWS black their faces for a year after their husbands decease  IN respect to government the  Caziques  are hereditary it is  their business to protect the property of their people and they have power of life and death the office is far from being eligible many reject it because they are obliged to pay all their people for their services who may at pleasure change their  Caziques  so that several refuse to accept new vassals who may offer themselves for it is not allowed any  Indian  to live out of the protection of some  Cazique  in such a case he would certainly be looked on as an outlaw  ELOQUENCE is in high esteem with them If a  Cazique  wants that talent he keeps an orator just as leaders in opposition have been known to do among us  THIS closes the history Mr  Falkener  favored me with but I must not quit that gentleman without informing you that he returned to  Europe  with a suit of  Patagonian  cloth a cup of horn and a little pot made of  Chilian  copper the whole fruits the  Spaniards  left him after the labors of a thirtyeight years mission  FROM the preceding account it appears that the country which goes under the name of  Patagonia  extending from the river  la Plata  lat to the streights of  Magellan  lat  M de Premontal  will compare  Patagonia  to the space between the  Rivicre des Sardines  and the streights of  Magellan  and westward as far as the  Andes  is inhabited by men who may be divided into three different classes and to them may be added a fourth a combination or mixture of others  THE first is a race of men of common size who have been seen by numbers and whose existence is indisputable These often are seen on the northern side of the streights of  Magellan  and oftener on the  Terra del Fuego  side even as low as opposite to  Cape Horn  These are frequently an exiled race unhappy fugitives drove by their enemies to take shelter from their fury in those distant parts for such is the information Mr  Falkener  received from some  Indians  he met with in the southern parts of  Patagonia  and this will account for the settled melancholy of the people observed by the navigators in  Terra del Fuego  THE second class consists of those who in general exceed the common height of  Europeans  by a few inches or perhaps the head such were those who were seen by  John Moore  who sailed with  Gracias de Nodal  in by Mr  Carteret  in and by  M Bougainville  in the same year  THE third class is composed of those whose height is so extraordinary as to occasion so great a disbelief of the accounts of voyagers and yet they are indisputably an existent people they have been seen by  Magellan  and six others in the th century and by two if not three in the present  THE fourth class is a mixed race who careless about preserving their generous and exalted breed pure and undegenerate have degraded themselves by intermixing with the puny tribes of the country and from that intercourse have produced a mongrel breed of every size except that of the original standard some few as if by accident seem to aspire to the height of their ancestors but are checked in their growth and stop at the stature of seven feet eight inches scarce the middle size of the genuine breed But another reason may be assigned for the degeneracy and inequality of size in this class they live within the neighborhood of  Europeans  they have intercourse with them and from them they have acquired the vice of dramdrinking  and all its horrible consequences this alone is sufficient to make a nation of giants dwindle into pygmies  A THIRD reason may still be assigned viz the introduction of manufactories among them Those people who depended on the spoils of the chace for their habiliments were certain of preserving their full vigor their strength of constitution and fulness of habit while those who are confined to the loom grow enervate and lose much of the force of their bodily faculties They also live in tents lined with woollen manufacture which doubtlessly are much more delicate luxurious and warm than the dwellings of the third undegenerate class We are unacquainted with the form of their tents but we know that they still cloath themselves with the skins of beasts and that among those Mr  Clarke  saw there was not the lest appearance of manufactury excepting what related to their horse furniture These seem to have been the genuine remains of the free race the conquerors of  Pedro de Baldivia  the  Puelches  whose original station was among the  Andes  of  Chiloe  in about latitude and almost due east of the isle of  Chiloe  These were the descendants of the  Indians  who retreated to the south far out of the common track of  Europeans  and who retain their primeval grandeur of size the others who fled northeast forgetful of their original magnificent stature lost in general that noble distinction by unsuitable alliances and the use of spirits while the first probably only marry among themselves and certainly have all strong liquor in abhorrence some of this tall race seem still to inhabit the stations of their ancestors or some not very remote from them for  M Frezier  was assured by  Don Pedro Molina  governor of  Chiloe  that he once was visited by  some of these people who were four  varas  or about nine or ten feet high they came in company with some  Chiloe Indians  Frezier's Voyage  page  with whom they were friends and who probably found them in some of their excursions  M de Premontal  insults  M Frezier  with much acrimony on account of this relation and charges him with changing the seat of those people from the eastern coast to the western or the tract between  Chiloe  and the  Magellanic  streights but the truth is that  Frezier  says no such thing but mentions them as a nation living up the country inland not near the shores  M Premontal  also sneers at the evidence of the crews of the  Maloe  ships but they by no means place these tall people on the western coast of  South America  but at  Gregory Bay  a place very little distant from the eastern entrance of the streights and near which these giants have been more frequently seen than any where else  MY remarks on  M de Premontal  are but a tribute to the many civilities I have received from doctor  Matie  who has been most unprovokedly unjustly and illiberally abused by this vague and pragmatical writer  THUS I conclude all that I collect relating to these singular people Let me beg you to receive the account with your usual candor and think me with the most regard  Dear Sir  Your faithful and affectionate humble servant  THOMAS PENNANT  Downing  Nov  th  Copy of a paper transmitted from admiral  Byron  to me through the hands of the right reverend  John Egerton  late bishop of  Durham  after he had perused the manuscript of the foregoing account  THE people I saw upon the coast of  Patagonia  were not the same that was seen the second voyage One or two of the officers that sailed with me and afterwards with captain  Wallace  declared to me that they had not a single thing I had distributed amongst those I saw  M Bougainville  remarks that his officers landed amongst the  Indians  I had seen as they had many  English  knives amongst them which were as he pretends undoubtedly given by me now it happened that I never gave a single knife to any of those  Indians  nor did I even carry one ashore with me  I HAD often heard from the  Spaniards  that there were two or three different nations of very tall people the largest of which inhabit those immense plains at the back of the  Andes  The others somewhere near the river  Galiegos  I take it to be the former that I saw and for this reasonreturning from  Port Famine  where I had been to wood and water I saw those peoples' fires a long way to the westward of where I had left them and a great way inland so as the winter was approaching they were certainly returning to a better climate I remarked that they had not one single thing amongst them that shewed they ever had any commerce with  Europeans  They were certainly of a most amazing size so much were their horses disproportioned that all the people that were with me in the boats when very near the shore swore  that they were all mounted upon deer and to this instant I believe there is not a man that landed with me though they were at some distance from them but would swear they took them to be nine feet high I do suppose many of them were between seven and eight and strong in proportion  Mr  Byron  is much obliged to Mr  Pennant  for the perusal of his manuscript and thinks his remarks very judicious  APPENDIX N  o    FREE THOUGHTS ON THE MILITIA LAWS ADDRESSED TO THE POOR INHABITANTS OF  NORTH WALES    Stat L  The Statutes at Large published by  OWEN RUFFHEAD Esq  Digest  Digest of the Militia Laws by  RICHARD BURN LLD  FREE THOUGHTS c  MY DEAR COUNTRYMEN  AT a time in which you feel the distresses in common with the rest of the nation it behoves every one of you to be made acquainted with the laws in order as much as is possible to ease yourselves of the burdens under which you labor and legally to resist every oppression which may be attempted against you  THE most grievous load which you now feel next to the poor's rate is that which arises from the taxes to support the militia The laws relating to it are the most numerous and the punishments attending the breach of them are so hard that for fear that any of you should offend by reason of ignorance I shall in the briefest manner set before you a few points which concern persons in every station of life If I should chance to speak of any piece of history or touch on any thing beyond the apprehensions of any of you your minister is I trust resident among you and ready to expound any difficulty  THE militia has been of very long standing in this kingdom several statutes were from very old times enacted for its regulation which in the reign of  Charles  II were revised  Ch II c Stat L iii Digest  and a new body of laws framed These were continued almost to the reign of his present majesty  G II c Stat L viii  for after they had undergone several alterations in the latter part of his grandfather's time they  were totally repealed and the laws under which we now act were made in their place but many of the clauses of the preceding statute were restored The former is called the  Old Militia  It certainly was of very little use as it then stood but it had one advantage over the present  Ch II L iii s  for the expence of raising the men was founded on the truest justice Those who had great estates palaces and rich furniture to defend were charged accordingly The gentlemen of lesser fortune and freeholders were charged less and the honest farmer who had nothing but his rickyard the hard fruit of his labor his poor dwelling and his coarse bed to care about was only obliged to pay according to such private agreement as might be made between him and his landlord  The same s Digest p  and all this was done in the arbitrary reign of a  Stuart  But at present there is in one instance a more levelling principle The poor laborer is in some cases  G III s Stat L viii Digest  obliged to contribute ten pounds if he can raise it towards the defence of the kingdom and the greatest squire in the principality is not bound to give a farthing more  IN the  Old Militia  all business relating to the charging the subject with finding soldiers was committed to the lieutenant of the county and his deputies or to the major part of those present  Ch II c s Stat L iii Digest  or in the absence of the lieutenant to the major part of the deputy lieutenants then present which major part was to be  three at lest  I am sorry to remark that even at the first framing of the new militia this important security of the interests of the poor subject was weakened  G III s Stat L viii  for the powers were in that act entrusted to three deputy lieutenants or justices only and since that time  G III c s Stat L xiii Digest  the number when the militia is in actual service is reduced to two only  THIS has been a most dangerous and imprudent alteration Every one knows the hazard of trusting power in few hands Friendship relationship or an unfortunate congenial turn of mind may be found in two which will hardly be met with in a greater number In fact two may become but as one and this reduction be productive of the most shameful abuses  BUT if it were possible that a gentleman should so far forget the duty he owes to his country as to adopt a system in the most distant view productive of a military government should he through mistaken friendship promote or second any illegality of proceeding Heaven have mercy upon poor  Britain  Not the increasing power of the crown not the machinations of a faction not the corruption of a parlement will half so effectually ruin its constitution Not the force of man can overturn it if the civil powers are true to their trust nor less than the intervention of Heaven preserve it if they are false  AT present perhaps no danger is to be apprehended but for the sake of posterity let us guard against events and remember that  an attack by storm may be repulsed but an unsuspected sap is sure in the end to overturn the strongest works  Is the militia at present that pure assemblage of men of rank fortune and independence as it was in the beginning It may consist of persons of equal integrity But is it not possible that a few may have crept in destitute of qualification or destitute of heads steady enough to bear the great trial of power Are there no instances of their carrying the controul of the camp into private life none of their ruffling the tranquillity of the social hour clouding the bright moments of the gay assembly or pre  venting the impending nap of the quiet magistrate who dared to differ in opinion with them  I SHALL make no remarks on the method of ballotting except this that a power is given to the deputy lieutenants and justices to order a fresh ballot in case the lot falls on any person who  G III c  Abridged and part of the clause omitted in Mr  Rufshead  's edition See vol xiii  Digest ed p  by reason of infirmity or want of size is unfit to serve This is extremely just yet strict attention should be paid to this power least through too great nicety in the gentlemen or too great favor to the commanding officer they should be induced to reject those to whom nothing but the most trivial or perhaps affected objections could be made Besides it most commonly happens that on the day of appeal the lists are entirely cleared from all objectionable persons For the sake of the people therefore a severe penalty should be enacted as a guard against the abuse of this power  IF any of you who are ballotted do not chuse to serve you have liberty of offering a substitute and that substitute must be five feet four inches high and fit for service You must offer none but such who are active in body and sound in mind who can fully answer the purpose for which they are called out that of defending our wives children and property You must offer such who will not shame you in distant counties or give needless trouble to the gentlemen who command them and who have in many instances for all our sakes given up for a time every comfort of a domestic life  IF you happen to be six feet high and formed as perfect as man can be the magistrates ought not to refuse a substitute inferior to you in those advantages it may be your good or I may say in this case your ill fortune to be so made but still they ought not to refuse any one you offer who comes within the above description Two deputy lieutenants or one deputy lieutenant and one justice have power to accept or refuse them If these two are resolved to plague you by the refusal of proper substitutes look about the room and see if there are any others present and pérhaps by their interference the former may be shamed into compliance for there are none but have eyes as well as they to discern whether a man is five feet four and proper to be accepted and sense enough to know in cases where a substitute is accepted that a single man will be less burdensome to a parish than a married man A merciful magistrate will surely never hesitate to prefer the former  THE possible abuse of the power of rejection or acceptance of substitutes when lodged in two only shews the necessity of resuming the antient mode and of enlarging the number At present let the power be ever so much abused you are left helpless in this act for there is no punishment for those who make so wanton an exertion of it  BUT remember that in case you are at length teized by the refusal of several stout substitutes into the payment of ten pounds which properly speaking  G III c s Stat L viii  is only to be levied in case you refuse or neglect to provide a man in your room remember I say  G III c s Stat L viii Digest  that you are to pay the money into the hands of the churchwardens and overseers of your respective parishes only who are also the only persons appointed by law to receive and pay the  ten pounds or to agree or contract for any substitutes unless you should chuse to do it yourselves  G III c s Digest  or should chuse to employ any friend to do it for you  AND observe that in case any of the deputies or justices or even the lord lieutenant himself should offend in any article of the above clause  G III c s Stat L viii Digest  you may lay an information against him and he is liable to be fined  one hundred pounds  half of which is to be paid to the prosecutor and half to the poor of the parish in which the offence was committed and you may recover it in any of his majesty's courts of record  IF any deputy or justice demands and gets from you more than ten pounds the offence becomes the dirty crime of extortion Will not the world say that the offender sinks the character of the generous  British  gentleman or brave officer into that of the recruiting serjeant and that he forfeits the confidence of his poor countrymen who look up to him for protection from every wrong But you may have more substantial satisfaction you may bring an action against him expose him in a court of justice and recover full damages This may atone for the private injury but the public wrong is of that moment as only to be expiated before one of our highest tribunals and with all the solemnity of public justice  THERE is not one of your fellowsubjects let him be ever so great that can levy on you a farthing more than the law allows One of our kings lost his head for trying to raise money without consent of parlement Surely you have more spirit than to suffer any private man to tax you of his own authority At the same time you must pay quietly the ten pounds penalty but only in case you have by law incurred it But remember that  this payment does not exempt you from serving again at the end of the three years  G III c s Stat L viii  or from providing a substitute  THE militia is our great and constitutional security it is the interest of us all to preserve this bulwark of our freedom but let us all take care that what was so studiously intended to be the guardian of our liberties become not the instrument of our slavery in the hands of men who know not the true use of power  IF it was possible that any deputy or justice should refuse your substitutes and immediately after take those very men in the room of other ballotted people let his shame be his punishment for I fear that the act provides none But as the precise description of fit or unfit is quite unsettled you will in such an instance have the comfort of being assured by the very magistrates themselves that you never wished to affront them by the offer of insufficient people  IF a poor man is made desperate by the rejection of several fit substitutes and by the inability of paying the ten pounds and afterwards absconds he is liable to a more severe punishment how far it may exceed the offence I submit to public judgment At first the law provided one which seemed equal to the fault which was a fine of ten pounds  G III c s Stat L viii  or for want of distress imprisonment in the common jail there to live for three months among felons and starve for I suspect that he is in a worse situation than them not being comprehended within the king's or county allowance which the vilest of felons are entitled to  THIS clause was repealed and the unhappy wretch is in time of actual service liable to be seized his name entered on the  roll be delivered to an officer of the corps he was ballotted for torn from his family handcuffed and marched perhaps two hundred miles across the country  G III c s Stat L xiii Digest  then to serve three years under perhaps an irritated commander and should he again abscond be liable to the infamy of whipping or to be shot like the most profligate deserter In the name of Heaven let this clause be for ever blotted from our statutes  THIS merits the more attention because nothing is easier to a merciless magistrate than to bring a man within this clause A poor creature may be able to raise six or seven pounds to give to the substitute whom he has engaged and yet with all his endeavours not be able to raise ten pounds The magistrates refuse his substitutes and finding neither money or effects to the value of ten pounds instantly convict him of the crime of poverty and he suffers accordingly Or he may not be a householder yet be able to pay the ten pounds but through indignation at the treatment he has received by the rejection of his substitutes refuses to deposit the money and having no effects is in like manner subject to punishment  IN case any militia man is disapproved by the commanding officer  G III c s Stat L xiii Digest  after being enrolled it is lawful for the officer to discharge him but he must give his reasons in writing and be assisted by two deputy lieutenants so attentive in this instance have our lawgivers been to the prevention of abuse in the military power Why have they been so remiss in the former far more important matter  PLEASE to observe that throughout the militia act the commanding officer is distinguished from the civil power or the  deputy lieutenants and justices of the peace  G III c s Stat L viii Digest  The lord lieutenant alone is permitted to act as colonel he alone is permitted to unite the civil and military characters because he can delegate his powers so that his absence may be dispensed with In every other instance they are so very carefully separated as never to appear acting together except in the instance of the discharge of a man in which they have a short correspondence The law plainly designs that no person inferior to the lord lieutenant should act in both capacities much less to preside at the meetings and browbeat the deputy lieutenants or justices in the discharge of their duty  A prince therefore never should give to military men a civil employment on the contrary they ought to be checked by the civil magistrate that the same persons may not have the confidence of the people and the power to abuse it  Montesquieu    THE civil power is the soul which is to animate the military machine and put it in motion  G III c s Stat L xiii Digest  The civil power forms the men into regiments or in small counties into companies assembles men in convenient stations and even posts to each company its proper officers  THE time of training and exercising the men  G III c s Stat L viii Digest  and the place of rendezvous is also entirely in the power of the lieutenant and two deputies or in the absence of the lieutenant in that of three deputy lieutenants  G III c s G III c s Stat L xiii xii Digest  and the power of embodying the militia is entrusted to the same even in time of actual invasion or in case of rebellion  IN a few words it does not appear that the commanding officer has scarcely any part to perform till he takes the field the ballotting the approving and the rejecting of volunteers or substitutes resting entirely in the civil magistrates The power of the commandant does not commence till at soonest the time of enrolling for within a month after that he is at liberty to correct the choice of the deputy lieutenants and to discharge any man whom they have suffered to pass muster  G III c s Stat L viii Digest  and who is really unfit for service  GOOD manners and even prudence should induce the magistrates to invite any discreet officer of the corps to attend the meeting for accepting of substitutes or if the corps is too remote prudence should urge them to do the same to any fit officer of a neighboring corps be it regular or militia They ought not they cannot be partakers of the power entrusted to the civil magistrates but they may be usefully consulted on any cases of acceptance in which the magistrates may have doubts Every officer is equally a citizen of  Great Britain  and I dare to say on this occasion would in his advice not forget that most important character  THE power given to the commandant of discharging any man he dislikes in one month after enrolling shews that it is not supposed he could be present at the ballot or could have any concern in approving of the substitutes otherwise he could not possibly receive improper men one week in order to discharge them the next  G III c Stat L viii Digest  I SHALL close this suspicion of the probability of the commanding officer's being excluded from all concern in the raising  of the militia with this remark that the overplus of the penalty of ten pounds if any remains is to be paid by the deputy lieutenants and justices to the clerk of the regiment or battalion  By the by an omission in the Digest  who is to account for it to the colonel or commanding officer a direction which sufficiently points out the difference of character and distinction of the department  MANY of you in order to ease yourselves of expence have formed clubs in which every person liable to be ballotted subscribed a small sum and raised sufficient to find a substitute in case the lot fell on any one of the members By this means you prevented a heavy load from falling on all such who by reason of sickness or any other infirmity were excepted from serving but not from the taxes attendant on the militia This you did freely and in case the lot fell upon any one of you who chose to serve you made use of the clubmoney and scorned to put your poor neighbors for whom you were going to fight to any more expence than the support of your families  THE law by a very particular clause  G III c s Stat L viii Digest  encourages the use of these clubs and as it were renders optional the use of a foregoing clause and prevents it from being made burdensome to any parishes except those which have been imprudent enough not to form these clubs in ease to themselves But to levy the tax of half the price of a volunteer as that clause directs  G III c s G III c Digest Stat L viii xiii  is a mere wanton exertion of power in all places where clubs have been established  HALF the price of a volunteer has been generally fixed at four guineas or four and a half yet I have known in the very week in which ten or twelve guineas have been prodigally bestowed on a substitute men equally good have been inlisted in the regulars for four and within five weeks after enrolling a militia substitute to supply a vacancy has been got by one of the parishes for four only  IN case half the price of a volunteer is to be raised on the country you have an indulgence of deferring the payment one whole month Among other reasons is this it gives time to the overseers of the poor who are charged with the payment to collect the money from their poor brethren it being well known that many who are thus taxed are worse off than those for whose use the money is raised Perhaps almost the whole month may be required for the distressed tenant to get in a little money notwithstanding all the trouble and illwill the overseer has in discharge of his office  BUT our lawmakers had another reason for giving you a month's time for the payment because as I said before the commanding officer has power to discharge any man he dislikes within one month after enrolling  The same Sect in one in the other  and then no such money is to be paid to that person but to the next chosen by lot in his stead Now it may happen that if you pay it to the first person on or soon after the day of enrolling he may die within the month or he may be discharged and in the last case most probably may have spent the money in so much that the parish must pay the same sum over again to the next person who is as liable to be discharged within a day or two as the other and the parish  put without remedy to fresh expences Never therefore pay the money till the end of the month and you will be on the sure side and within the meaning of the law  YOU need not fear being put to the expence of maintaining the wives or children of the serjeants In one of your counties two wellmeaning magistrates made the trial but when their order came to the clerk of the peace who is a very honest fellow he took it and the matter was totally suppressed  G III c s Digest St L viii G III c s Digest Stat L viii G III c s Digest  One should have thought it impossible that they could mistake a noncommission officer for a common man or not have read that serjeants were appointed from among the common men and were on any misconduct liable to be reduced to the rank of common men  THE above is the only personal allusion in this little piece but I hope I may make free with myself and thus with shame and contrition perform my  amende honorable  IF any of you are oppressed in any manner whatsoever do not despair of relief Remember you live in a free country where justice is open to the poor as well as the rich It is not many years ago since a great lord a secretary of state made the same mistake as most country justices have done and issued a general warrant against a private gentleman who had spirit to take the law of his lordship and recovered four thousand pounds damage And I remember a cobler near  London  who went to law with a former king for a footpath and cast his majesty  BUT let the law be your last resource I have not the most distant thought of setting you and the gentry at variance They  are bound to give you protection by the duties of humanity by their duty as magistrates They are bound by their oaths  to do equal justice to the poor and to the rich after their cunning wit and power and after the laws and customs of the realm and the statutes thereof made  You are bound to pay to them a manly respect for on their integrity knowlege and power YOUR OWN SAFETY DEPENDS  In our several stations we are  ALL BOUND TO BE PROTECTIONS  one to the other  If any of them through heat or forgetfulness of the law should have injured you apply for redress in a private manner I trust that there are in every  Welsh  county some worthy gentlemen who will undertake your cause and perform the blessed office of peacemakers Those who may have wronged you need not be ashamed of making the poorest of you amends Reparation of an injury does honor to the offender and wipes away the offence The greatest man in  England  may glory in the opportunity  IN distracted times such as the present petty tyrants are apt to arise who think they can act secure in the rage of the storm The watchman is not to be blamed who in suspicious seasons gives the alarm on the sight of the rising of a distant dust I hope therefore it will not be thought presumptuous in me unbidden to take the office Internal impulses to prevent evils ought not to be resisted I am not a firstrate man among you but a pygmy armed by justice goes forth a giant Within the county in which I am destined to act I am in a particular manner bound to befriend you to befriend you in a good cause but if you are wrong and obstinately wrong my utmost endeavours shall be used to inflict on you every punishment in the power of the law  BUT I hope that peace and mutual confidence will ever reign among us and that rich and poor will as is their joint interest endeavour to promote to the utmost of their abilities RESPECT TO THE LAWS AND RESPECT TO TRUE LIBERTY Such  My dear countrymen  is the constant wish of  Your fast

she found flung upon my desk I have perused it carefully and find nothing in it but good found doctrine and quite agreeable to the laws and usage of the land I cannot but consider it as a fairygift therefore will not wrong myself so far as not to print it thinking myself free from blame for turning the penny in an honest way But at the same time pledge myself to the author should he hereafter appear to allow him such a share of profit as shall be adjudged by any two of the trade with a proper umpire  J MONK  Chester  April    A LETTER FROM A  WELSH FREEHOLDER  TO HIS REPRESENTATIVE  February    DEAR SIR  I AM obliged to you for your favor of  January  th and should have been extremely happy to have received an answer a little more satisfactory I am most willing to believe that your designs may at this time be pure that you have no thought to eradicate monarchy no more than hundreds of great characters had in the beginning of the troubles of the last century but by the artifices of the popular leaders they were drawn from violence to violence till their retreat became impracticable and when they made the attempt they were overwhelmed by the tyranny which they unwittingly had helped to establish and  which soon after totally subverted the constitution  A fimilar instance unhappily may be given in our times when numbers of the first national assembly of  France  have been massacred by the very people they labored to free from one of the worst of governments  You seem shocked at the idea and are ready to say with  Hazael  "Is thy servant a dog that he should do these things" What is the government of our kingdom but the wise mixture of King Lords and Commons each one designed to be a check on the illconduct of the others if you destroy the powers of any one and the others should unite you establish the most absolute despotism for you take away the salutary control of the third Your saying that the present majority is not antimonarchial is saying nothing for if you deprive the King of the power of chusing his own servants or of the other great executive privilege of appointing to places you make him merely nominal an arrant King Log  Within these two months the above has been as yet happily in vain attempted first in the endeavour to place in the Commons the disposition of places in  India  and all its vast dependencies secondly in the interference of Lord **** in the disposal of the dutchy of  Lancaster  thirdly in the present attempt to wrest from Majesty the undoubted right of chusing his own ministers let these points be gained by the Commons and monarchy falls Have your leaders informed you what government they mean to establish If prerogative is destroyed this cannot subsist for I think the King will never submit to be brought from his prison at  St James  's with the pageantry of majesty to give his assent to acts signified by the pleasure of the Commons I trust that we both look with equal horror on a  King without Commons as Commons without King The pernicious resolutions of  January  the twelfth are without precedent because unprovoked the cause ought to have been of the first magnitude to have produced such effects which involve all ranks in their destructive consequence They are like a sword which passes undistinguished between innocent and guilty Your constituents feel their share All business is obstructed and possibly in a few days the whole army is to be let loose on their fellow subjects What crime has majesty or ministers committed to bring on them and our country such calamities Has not year after year the King quietly assented to every bill passed by the two other branches of legislature for the weakening of his own power Had he had ill designs his own prerogative might have checked the abridgement of his authority I instance only the act for taking away the vote of revenue officers and that for the abolition of the board of trade The county of **** with great zeal petitioned for the taking away of useless places Had the inciters of those petitions when they came into power pursued the design with the same sincerity with which they were supported by the duped counties they would not have lest room to suspect that the desire of possessing the emoluments of Lord  North  's administration was not the chief end by them proposed Let me name another merit of this reign for the security of our liberties in which the Commons had no share I mean the spontaneous act of the crown which has made the judges independent of the King by giving them their places for life  To these merits of the King let me oppose one glaring demerit of the Commons Did not the representatives of the people in betray their rights by the septennial act and vest in  themselves four years more of power than the constitution or their constituents ever intended I will not enter into a discussion of the eventual good or evil The charge ought to be subject of deep consideration with electors and elected But if it was wrong is not the present majority  particeps criminis  by permitting it to continue unrepealed But does there not appear the greater probability of its design of assuming a far longer continuance of its own power should it not be appalled by the warning voice of the people I cannot give it a grain of credit for any one act of forbearance any pretended moderation since the awful sound begins to roll over its head  THE King has lately dared to make use of his prerogative in dismissing his late servants for unconstitutionally trying to divert into another branch of the legislature his great prerogative of the disposal of places Please to apprehend  that  to be the only part of Mr  Fox's India  bill to which I make any objection I should hold chartered rights most sacred but not such which have affected the lives and properties of millions in the manner in which the abuse of power is pretended to have done in our  Indian  empire  IN place of the ministry dismissed his majesty has been pleased to put at the head of the new one a youth endued I may say with miraculous abilities one in whom malice can find as few defects as can be found in human nature When I had the honor of speaking to you on the subject of his virtues in the short conversation I had with you in your way to town you seemed to have had no objection to him Has his short administration been marked by any flagitious deed Would it not have been fair to have given the man of the King's choice a short trial Or is it not because he is the man of the King's  choice that the majority of mouths are open against him I hope his virtues are not the object of jealousy and that the eloquence of  Themistocles  is not to bear down the virtues of  Aristides  surely the majority do not sign the shell because they are angry at every body calling  Aristides  just  CERTAINLY there are strong contrasts to his character who unite their force to pull him down Why should the affairs of the whole nation be stopped at the instance of such persons Could you not suffer the business to go on with only the proper objections to what was wrong Surely the taxes might have passed in order to prevent what may possibly ensue universal bankruptcy But moderation must not be adopted it will suit neither the views nor interests of a set of men whom poverty and ambition have made nearly desperate The nonsensical exploded cry of secret influence is for private ends again revived  EXCUSE me for reminding you but remind you I must of the declaration you made at the last general election that you would enlist under no party follow no set of men the performance is far from impracticable many illustrious characters who observe those excellent rules exist at this very time Your constituents wish you to do the same They wish to prevale on you to compare your sentiments with theirs the sooner it is done the less will be the violence of the alteration I first suggested the communication of our sentiments and from my model such as is inclosed is drawn the declaration which I apprehend has by this time been sent to you from the gentlemen of **** with the approbation of many respected characters in this end of the county You need not start at the test offered to you It is not designed to bind you to any party  to any set of men It contains only constitutional fundamentals such as you might subscribe without any derogation from your honor If the name offends change it to 'instructions' and the offence is done away Why should the majority be alarmed at subscribing to undeniable duties who are daily offering to their Sovereign the most mortifying covenants This squeamish nicety reminds me of the giant in  Rabelais  who daily swallowed windmills for his breakfast and at last was choaked with a lump of butter before the mouth of a warm oven  To conclude there is not a wish to change our representative provided he acts consonant to our principles but none of us ought to give up principle for affection I trust that your answer will be clear and decided so that in supporting you we shall support the dictates of our own consciences The great majority of your constituents are firm friends to the legal prerogative They will reelect you yet how must they blush at their inconsistency if you take an adverse part I have been your friend and I shall be sorry to withdraw my interest from you Excuse me again if I say with the spirit of a freeman this must rest in yourself If we differ in sentiments there ought to be mutual forgiveness for it is impossible to expect from either side a criminal compliment I have never yet deceived you nor will I begin in this late period of life If we are so unhappy to disagree in opinion I will not vote against you but cannot vote for you  I remain dear Sir Your affectionate humble servant A WELSH FREEHOLDER  APPENDIX N  o    TO THE EDITOR OF THE GENERAL EVENING POST  Havod y lom Feb    SIR  I HAVE long been very sensible of the several improvements which the military spirit so prevalent in these kingdoms and the frequent incampments have introduced into the most distant counties At present I shall forbear mentioning the happy effects they have had on the morals of the male part of the community and confine myself to that sex to which we are indebted for every thing which renders life endurable I was always its sincere admirer and am happy to find any occasion of pointing out whatsoever may add to their charms or extend their conquests  I WAS last summer in a gentleman's family in the inland part of  England  with whom I had a long and intimate acquaintance I happened to reach the place in the dogdays and finding the  ladies sitting in an alcove in their cloth riding habits instead of their cool chintzes I expressed my fear that I prevented them from taking their morning ride They assured me they did not mean to stir out and one of them clapping on a vast hat with a cockade declared she would only go for her work and sit down for the rest of the morning On turning round how was my rusticity surprized to see her hair clubbed behind another gave me an opportunity of seeing a whisking queue and a third a greasy braid hanging down and dabbing the shining cape  AFTER the morning was far spent Miss  Dorothy  for in imitation of the quality there are now no such things as  Dollies Mollies  and  Betties  with a great yawn flung her arms over her head and her legs a yard before her and informed us it was dressing time then pulling her watch out of I believe a tight leathern breeches acquainted us that it was half past two and returned it to its place with a most officerlike air  I SAW the countenance of my good old friend change As soon as the ladies had left the place he gave vent to his discontent in the following terms "My dear  Jack"  says he  what an alteration is there in the manners of this house since I last had the happiness of your company A cursed visit to  Coxheath  hath infected my poor girls to a degree that gives me the keenest concern The chaste and elegant dress which was once their characteristic is now converted into what you have just seen Female delicacy is changed into masculine courage and as much of the garb assumed as at first view almost leaves the difference of sex undistinguishable The manly habit is put on with the morning and as you will see presently only changed for another of the same kind The  watch too has also quitted its modest station and the fair wearer instead of consulting the hour with the former graceful recline of the head now boldly lugs out the oracle and asterwards thrusts itthe lord knows where My niece  Elizabeth  in defence of this new mode says that its motions are considerably altered since it had experienced a new situation No wonder since it had quitted the temperate for the torrid zone A long string with all the masculine load of seals c now affectedly hangs down the center of the fair frame sometimes it is formed of hair ending with a strange fringe of the same A celebrated antiquarian assured me that this was the true lovelock And a wicked rogue added that it was an excellent conductor of amorous ideas to our sex a remembrancer to our slack youth and like a strange peculiarity in the dress of the ladies of  Siam  which serves as a whet to the depraved appetites of their coppercoloured gallants Instead of  I could no longer bear his prosing so diverted the discourse but not without giving internal assent to part of his reflections even tinctured as they were by the foolish prejudices of old age Laudable as a due attention is to fashion in young people yet I was brought to confess that there were indecencies in those of the present year which are the disgust of the grave the scoff of the licentious are marks of a light mind or bring under suspicion of levity the purest heart which thoughtlessly adopts the unsuitable manners or habit of our sex  I am Your humble servant CAMBER  APPENDIX N  o    MISCELLANIES  Old Bondstreet August    SIR  I WAS the other day in a coffeehouse filled with not the first rate company of this great town where I long sate indignant at the topic which employed every tongue I could have born with patience the common subjects of politics the mere offspring of ignorance and rancour but when I found their licentious mouths filled with the most infamous inferences drawn from the unhappy conduct of a lady not less eminent for her rank than her beauty I flung down my penny in a rage and retired to my apartments full of reflections on some events unfortunately at this time too well known  THE love of fame in either sex is a principle implanted in us for the most noble purposes and is often of itself productive of the most important and generous effects The character of the tender part of the creation confines them to a narrower sphere of action but their duties are not less consequential than those of our sex which make more eclat and are attended with all the rewards that public merit can claim If it is the lot of the fair to become wives and parents a virtuous discharge of the duties of those relations should be the sum of their ambition But if  it be their fortune to remain single an equal fame will attend them by that delicacy and ease of behaviour towards the men which form the genuine characteristics of virtue If once this honest species of ambition forsakes them and an anxiety after foreign admiration seizes them they become the mark of every profligate wretch or fluttering insect who may perhaps singe his wings but at the same time is sure to impair the brightness of the luminary Every soft look and every little levity becomes encouragement and the enduring of one free action is sure to lay a foundation for another The man of gallantry presumes on appearances mistakes culpable vanity for vitious inclinations and in the end most deservedly suffers for his error he is disgracefully driven from the chateau by insulting domestics or suffers still more marked mortifications at the command of the insulted fair She distresses her poor husband with her complaints she wonders at the fellow's impudence Alas what can the unhappy spouse reply but what must add to her and his own misery He may but it is more likely his suspicions may take an unhappy turn at the same time he may I say allow her to be innocent at the bottom but he will reproach her with having given the gallant every reason to expect an easy conquest he may also unjustly conceive a jealousy that there may have been or that there still may be moments when poor virtue may be caught napping and the sum of female dishonour effected His peace of mind is gone and mutual wretchedness becomes the price of the mere moments of levity or the love of transient admiration  EVERY attempt for that purpose becomes criminal since the conclusion is often as uncertain as it is unexpected To call  aloud in public to men of gaiety to suffer an unmeaning whisper or to retire to a remote seat are acts which bring with them the cause of the most cruel scandal In private company to force yourself at table almost on the lap of your favorite to rivet your eye on his to catch frequently at his hand or every now and then to place your's on his knee or mutually to dangle your hands over the elbow chair that they may come unperceived in contact give as great disgust to the company as they do solid injury to the reputation of the fair offender whether she is married or whether she is single If the object of attraction be a married man how aggravated is the offence how pitiable is the situation of the poor injured spouse And yet this species of conduct is very frequent but never is passed unnoticed the encouragement either brings unhappiness on the thoughtless fair or busy scandal fixes on her an indelible blot a cruel penalty yet she falls unpitied as it is brought on her by a criminal or insolent inattention to appearances  CAMBER  APPENDIX N  o    MISCELLANIES FLINTSHIRE PETITION  THE clamors raised in the year and the apparent discontents grew to such a height that I thought it prudent that the county of  Flint  should add its weight to the petition so that by prevaling on government to lessen every unnecessary burden the minds of the people might be eased and all ill consequences prevented for civil war was almost threatened I at all times professed my abhorrence of committees and associations Sir  Roger Mostyn  advised me to write to some of our principal gentlemen to inform them of the terms on which I undertook to excite the county to petition so that they might decline subscribing to the requisition in case they disliked my plan or if they did sign it support me to its full extent None to whom I wrote appeared at the meeting Mr  Yonge  one of the friends to whom I wrote disliked the petition and declined signing the requisition Sir  Stephen Glynn  bart and  Philip Lloyd Fletcher  esq approved my plan and promised it every support and to adhere to the very letter of it Mr  Fletcher  also  sent my letter along with the requisition to the gentlemen of his neighborhood that they might not mistake the terms on which they were to sign I came to the meeting in a full reliance on the faith of my countrymen but the dean of St  Asaph  burning after the glory of chairman of a committee and backed by friends he brought with him proposed a committee and carried his point  I DID intend to deliver the following speech but my spirits failed me  BEING totally unused to speak in public I beg leave in faultering words to lay before you the motives which induced me to promote this meeting  THE distresses of the times are too evident to admit of contradiction To have recourse to any legal method of alleviating our sufferings is extremely natural The only one which presents itself is 'by petition to the high court of parliament' a privilege preserved to us by the BILL of RIGHTS and which can never be exerted with more propriety than at present provided respect and moderation attend it  IT is said by an able speaker on the side of opposition 'that l may be annually saved by retrenching the emoluments of offices and abolishing the long train of useless placemen and pensioners' As I make no doubt but this gentleman can support his assertion let me observe that the above sum will at the rate of five per cent pay the interest of more than six millions of money and of course in the next year ease the allsupporting landlord and tenant from a burden equal to that sum  THIS alone in the necessitous state of our country which  from the nature of its trade suffers more in proportion than others ought to determine us to make use of the proposed method of relief leaving it to the wisdom of parlement severely to scrutinize into the nature of our grievances and to rectify every one which may be discovered to exist It is just to enquire before we condemn Let the accused if guilty suffer the penalty of their neglect if innocent acquitted with honor But let the minds of the people be eased by a proper enquiry into the foundation of the national discontent  THAT invaluable compilation the  Redbook  Edition pages  furnishes me with a very singular instance of a place of little moment attended with a high salary I cannot but smile at seeing the representative of one of our first cities and one of the lords commissioners of the admiralty unite with that important charge the post of  lettercarrier  to the court with the lavish salary of l a year The duty might perhaps be performed if any there is by a less respectable person for s d a day and I will not pay a very worthy gentleman so bad a compliment as to suppose that his principles will be in the lest altered by being free from such a degrading office  MANY similar instances may probably be found all worthy of being lopped off but let me do the times the justice to say that few of them are of recent formation they are the antient marks of regal state created in prosperous days In the progress of enquiry it will be worthy to remark the periods when they ceased to be ornaments to the crown and became the instruments of corruption  THE affair of contracts is beyond my power to speak to It will be our wish that parlement would guard against the abuse of them and examine whether the princely state in which our contractors live arises from any thing beyond the fair profits of their business  IN attending to the report of any party on that subject or any other we ought to take particular care not to be too credulous I say this because of the alarm that has I trust causelessly arisen among  us  of a design of altering the courts of justice in the principality in a manner grievous to the  Welch  let us wait with patience till the honorable member has laid open his design and if it is then found to be a grievance let us resist it with the same firmness as we did the treasury warrant I hereby declare not only in my own name but in that of many respectable friends great and small freeholders that we do not by signing the petition before us exclude ourselves from seeking legal redress from any innovation which may appear unjust and burdensome let it come from any quarter whatsoever  THE body of us petitioners consists of a stupendous multitude of persons actuated with very different objects I believe I may say with confidence that there is not an individual in this assembly who has not the most laudable motives in view abstracted from every party spirit whatsoever  THERE are many very worthy and wellmeaning gentlemen who think we have chosen an improper season for petitioning amidst the rage of war But let it be observed that the strength of government consists in the variety of its resources and if we are able to point out a most important one we rather accelerate than impede its motion In the peaceable times to refuse supplies  would be a proper insult to an obstinate minister but NOW in the moment of RETURNING VICTORY  Lord  Rodney  's defeat of the  Spanish  sleet  January  th  it would be a measure fraught with certain danger and possible parricide  I AM not of consequence enough to trouble you with professions especially as I have no other object than to add my mite to serve my country I shall only detain you while I acquaint you with the steps I took after I had formed the resolution of exciting the county to assemble on this occasion I drew up the requisition to the sheriff I sent it accompanied with a letter experssive of my sentiments to the three worthy gentlemen before mentioned That I did not send it to more was for want of time not of respect From my letter and from the substance of a petition I sent with it they might judge of the utmost limits of my intentions that in case they disapproved of my design they might decline subscribing to my requisition It was returned to me signed by an ample number to whom I beg leave to return thanks for the compliment they were pleased to pay me  I objected in that letter and I do now in the strongest manner object to all partyassociations and for myself decline the honors of committeeman  THE former may end in combinations injurious to our peace and perhaps fatal at the last to those who embark in them We MUST not send our representative to the house with our prayer in one hand and a dagger in the other We MUST not attempt to intimidate the house from freedom of debate at the time we are striving to wrest from men of power the pestilential baits  of corruption we MUST not wound when we wish to amend the diseases of our constitution we MUST be consistent with ourselves The parlement will suffer a civil death in less than a twelvemonth it will be the fault of the people if they chuse another composed of members with whom they are at present so discontented They will when that period arrives have an opportunity of legally rejecting those candidates whom they disapprove and selecting those only worthy of their confidence  MY mention of petitioning with a dagger in one hand gave great offence but I thought myself vindicated by the indecent language of some of the petitioners of which the following is a specimen  SUCH were the people who agreed to the petition on which I now lean Oeconomy in the expenditure of the public money is all they ask Will any man vote for rejecting so modest so reasonable a request I hope not Will any man vote that this petition be not brought up No man I trust will dare do it The minister will not dare do it because he knows he ought not to dare it But there is another thing also which he ought not to dare and that is to attempt to defeat the object of it If the minister is so inclined with the turn of his finger he may destroy it but let him beware how he directs his influence against it Let me advise him to beware how he institutes an enquiry into the merits of the petition it speaks for itself and the petitioners will look upon such an enquiry as a mockery as a parlementary or ministerial trick to put an indirect negative upon their petition When they met to draw it up they were unarmed they had  neither muskets nor staves but if you mock them they will I'll leave blanks for the sagacity of the house to fill up  LORD  Ongly  reprobated the idea of threats notwithstanding he was a petitioner and voted in this instance with the minority  LORD  Ongly  reprobated in severe terms the connection that subsisted between the petition and county associations Threats had been hinted and more than hinted if the prayer of this and of other similar petitions should be rejected This alone in his lordship's opinion was sufficient to damn the petition It puts me in mind said he of the man who went about robbing under pretence of selling rabbits He held out the rabbits in one hand and a pistol in the other and very civilly asked those he chanced to meet whether they chose to buy any rabbits Such is the conduct of the petitioners in the different counties a conduct which if it is not checked in the bud may be productive of the most fatal consequences to the liberty and happiness of this country  THE clamor continued I was attacked in the papers and I put an end to the war by the following answer  Downing March    MR MONK  PERMIT me through your paper to thank the gentlemanlike freeholder of the county of  Flint  for his explanation of the mysterious word  Associations  I so fully approve the end which he intends that provided he would secure them from  proceeding any farther I do declare that had I not seen the name of our representative in the glorious list of the lamented minority of I would at the next general election have voted but not associated against him Now let the gloomy idea of the word and the  airdrawn dagger  vanish But I must remain master of myself Neither KING nor People shall have the sole keeping of my political conscience Free was I born free have I lived and free I trust will die  THOMAS PENNANT  APPENDIX N  o    A LETTER TO A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT ON MAILCOACHES  FACIT INDIGNATIO  By THOMAS PENNANT Esq    A LETTER c  DEAR SIR  I AM much obliged to you for your favor of the th instant I pay such deference to your opinion that I entirely lay aside all thoughts of troubling your honorable house with the affair of repealing the act of exemption of mailcoaches from the payment of tolls I would avoid every adventure which does not promise success and should be much mortified to be unhorsed and laid sprawling on the  arena  of  St Stephen  's  YET I shall be extremely sorry that any member of your house should through any quickness of misapprehension wilful or natural imagine me to be so wild as to think of an attempt that was not founded on reasonable and honest principles  I AM sensible that the exemption of the mails from the payment of tolls commenced very early I think first by an act of  William  and  Mary  which was afterwards repeated in several others till it was oppressively confirmed by that of the th  Geo  III  THE most secondsighted of your house could never have foreseen that the usage of the single horse and postboy afterwards in many parts converted into the light mailcart drawn by one horse would be superseded by a  royal  carriage drawn by four horses and filled by passengers who before rode in the common stages and contributed to support the roads which they passed over This unfortunate change proceeded  from an extent of prerogative repined at only when perverted to the injury of the subject as this most incontestably must be allowed to have done  UNDER the sanction of the first act turnpike gates were erected and immense sums of money lent on the national faith For a long time the security was esteemed good and in  Wales  where five per cent was given people at first were happy to place their money on mortgages they imagined so safe The transfer was then easy and the public rested perfectly content The commissioners did their duty fully they laid out the money to the best advantage nor did they desist till the lowering of the tolls by the fatal change of the mode of conveyance had taken place  I WILL exemplify the hardships only in the country I live Other places equally remote from the capital must come in for their share of the grievance but they will fall under the common description  BEFORE the institution of mailcoaches two stagecoaches ran through the county of  Flint  And were it not for an evasion the change of horses between gate and gate in the  Mostyn  district one of the districts principally aggrieved each would have paid forty pounds a year This unhappily was left unguarded in the act By the help of that evasion both together only paid that sum and even that sum had we not been deprived of it would have enabled us to take up l more and given us the power of repairing every part of the road which was not unexceptionably good  MANY parts may have been allowed to have been indifferent but they were adequate to the uses of the country not only for  the use of the farmers and the carriers but also for the luxury of carriages  IN this state they were found at the introduction of mailcoaches These soon occasioned the suppression of the common stages and deprived us at once of forty pounds of annual income In the year a person was sent from the general postoffice to survey the roads From his report and by the orders of the postoffice indictments were preferred at the great sessions at  Mold  against the whole extent of road in the narrow but long county of  Flint  In some instances I fear the grand jury made a strain of their consciences in finding the bills for some of the indicted places were in most admirable repair But we were unwilling to obstruct any thing that tended to promote the public good  FINES to the amount of l were imposed on the several townships many of which were very small and the inhabitants composed of small farmers and laborers poor and distressed to the highest degree  Two of these townships had a great extent of road and only a few labourers and a few miserable teams to perform their statute duty One of these townships terrified with the prospect of ruin by the execution of the  summum jus  performed twentytwo days duty upon the road The other township had only a single farmer living in it who performed a duty of twentyeight days  THE vast expences which the commissioners had been at in the repairs of the roads had almost exhausted the credit in some totally so that at present l cannot be obtained for l worth of our parchment securities  AT this period I was moved with compassion at the complaint and distresses of the poor This induced me to write my circular letter to the several grand juries of  England  and  Wales  in order to induce them to unite in a common cause I blush at my want of success resulting from either ignorance of or indifference to the first principles of security of property I was simple enough to think that the justice of the cause would have insured an approbation of my plan Instead of that I am told that in some places it was even treated with rudeness and contempt I ventured even to write to two gentlemen with whom I was not personally acquainted they never paid the lest attention to my letter they forgot my character and they forgot their own  I TOOK the liberty of getting my circular letter conveyed to a third gentleman high in office with whom I was acquainted It was returned with written on a corner of it "Mr  Pennant  is in the wrong and I will have no concern in the affair" The gentleman may be politically right but I am confident that Mr  Pennant  is not morally wrong  THERE has certainly been a strong misapprehension of my meaning I did not intend the abolition of mailcoaches they have their objections whether we consider the barbarity with which the poor horses are treated or the very frequent destruction of the passengersour old  Jehus  may have slain their thousands our modern their tens of thousands I only wished that they might not prove oppressive to many of our counties by causes I have before mentioned True it is that in my first circular letter I did most rashly and unadvisedly hint that they might without injury be converted into the mailcart  The gentlemen of  Somersetshire  who I must confess did admit that something should be done for us very justly fired on the idea of sending their  Thespis  again into his cart A worthy friend of mine of that county warmly but kindly expostulated with me on the subject but I hope this my declaration of repentance will be admitted and atone for my error  THE grand juries of  Cheshire Berkshire Monmouthshire  and those of  North Wales  united in the support of my design The rest of the counties proved to me the truth of the remark of  Swift  That he never knew any person who did not bear the misfortunes of another perfectly like a Christian  FAR the majority of the roads in  England  have great revenues arising from the multitude of stagecoaches that keep their ground in defiance of mails Our stages the obliged to desist from travelling and give the former a most unjust and oppressive monopoly The counties interested in them feel not our unhappiness and want generosity to contribute to the alleviation of the distresses we suffer  WE should have made a claim on the justice of the house had we had the most distant prospect of success We are now in the case of creditors defrauded by the superior cunning of an artful debtor Had an individual received an adequate mortgage on his estate and had afterwards the dexterity to lessen the income what name would he have deserved The highest term of reproach but such a one that could never be applied the most remotely to any member of your honorable house  THIS affair has never yet been seriously considered Good men I trust will now awake as from a sleep and stand amazed and confused at the sad delusion they discovered that they had labored under Favourite systems run away with mankind  and totally annihilate all attention to the inconveniences they occasion The act was obtained late in the sessions hurried through a very thin house and with the slightest opposition The legislature obliges a certain time of notice to be given before the introduction of a common turnpike bill Let me ask Should not at lest the interval of a session have been given for the discussion of so strange and unequal a taxation  WHAT may I ask could make the individual liable to censure and the actions of the collective body be passed over without blame Either the numbers defend or some daemon like the ghostly father of  Charles  I has whispered in your ears Have a double conscience one that is to make you consult the plain dictates of honesty the other telling you to support some fancied public good at the expence of a certain number of persons who in times not very remote had trusted their money to the security of the public faith  OR may you not hold the same doctrine as the nuns in  Tristram Shandy  that the divisibility of sin may enable you to fritter it away into almost nothingYou certainly have the advantage The nuns were but two you are five hundred and fiftytwo to bear the featherweight of the wrong decision you had most unwarily been induced to make  LET me now ask Are there no instances of repeal of acts on far less important occasions I well recollect two The first is the  Jew Act  which had in fact no consequences to be feared religious or political The other was the cyder tax esteemed like ours a partial grievance and yet its overthrow was easily effected I reflect on these two acts repeated without cause and on our oppressions continued in defiance of every principle of justice  SINCE your honorable house was determined to weaken our securities ought it not to have first paid off every turnpike mortgage and then you might have had full liberty of doing what you pleased with the income of the gates  I BEG leave to lay before you a case in which your house once shewed a most scrupulous attention to the rights of creditors That was by the repeal of a clause in the  Kingsland  turnpike act Part of it leads from  Shoreditch  to  Ware  and this part was crossed by the  Newmarket  road and tolls were taken by the commissioners of the  Ware  road from all travellers to and from that seminary of virtue merely for crossing the road On the renewing of the  Kingsland  turnpike act the  Newmarket  people insisted that they should pass free of tolls A clause was inserted in the new act for that purpose and the crossgates were pulled down The creditors of the  Kingsland  turnpike petitioned to the house of commons for redress they succeeded and the crossgates were again erected and the tolls taken till the whole of the creditors were paid  NEWMARKET ROAD  SHOREDITCH TO WARE  I IMAGINE that there is not a member of the house who has not acted as a commissioner of the turnpikes Let me request him to call to mind whether he has not in that character or in the character of a magistrate treated with a harsh severity the delinquent who through poverty has defrauded the gate of ninepence What pleas of conscience have not the commissioners urged for maintaining the interests of the gates and discharging their trust like men of honor Is there not a  Lethean  atmosphere in the chapel of  St Stephen  so suddenly to efface all memory of transactions in the common air of the world I trust that there is otherwise the individual who in one place and in one character had been so strenuous to save a poor ninepence should in another place and in another character vote as a perquisite to the comptrollergeneral of the postoffice an exemption of the mails from toll a sum amounting to not less than l a year on which he has a most considerable poundage besides some very good pickings from other articles This I am assured of by a worthy member of your house I think his salary is but l per ann What a monstrous quantity of sack is allowed to his halfpennyworth of bread  So liberally supplied as the comptroller has been with the means cannot something be deducted to relieve our complaint If the honorable house does not choose this mode a small a very small tax on the passengers and on the immense sums got by the carriage of parcels would compensate for the loss of exemption of tolls The rich  English  districts would be above taking advantage of this diminution of revenue to the comptrollergeneral It is only for the poor  Welch  districts and a few others like circumstanced for which it is humbly asked  I HAVE a respect for the plan of the mailcoaches and for the inventor but I never could think of applying to him as the  nizam al muluc  the regulator of the postingempire There ought not to be in our constitution such a monster as a comptroller uncontrollable by his legislature or his superiors in office legislature must now see its imprudence in permitting a latitude of so dangerous a nature I an individual never could bear the thought I looked for redress to the postmaster general or to the three estates of the kingdom  I FEAR too great a veneration has been paid to this newcreated office and mode of conveying the mail I always wish to pay every individual and every office a due respect but in this case I must preserve the independent and useful man and endeavour to correct every abuse that falls within my sphere as a provincial magistrate What I am going to say may be deemed foreign to a legislative friend yet as it may prove useful to many who behold these new vehicles with a kind of veneration I shall mention an affair which happened in our county in the last autumn Let me premise that those protectors of the mail the guards relying on the name of royalty had in the course of the  Irish  road through  North Wales  committed great excesses One on a trifling quarrel shot dead a poor old gatekeeper a coroner's jury was huddled up and in defiance of the tears of the widow no judicial notice has been taken of the affair to this very day In  Anglesey  another of these guards discharged his pistol wantonly in the face of a chaise horse drawing his master the Rev  John Bulkely  who was flung out and died either on the spot or soon aster These guards shoot at dogs hogs sheep and poultry  as they pass the road and even in towns to the great terror and danger of the inhabitants I determined to put a stop to these excesses and soon had an opportunity  A NEIGHBORING gatekeeper laid before me a complaint that one of the guards had threatened to blow his brains out and had actually shot a dog that had offended him by his barking I issued out my warrant had the guard seized and brought before me He was a man who for his great beauty and elegant person was called the  Prince  of  Wales  I did not hesitate to play the Judge  Gascoigne  but from the goodness of his appearance and the propriety of his behaviour I did not go quite the length that famous magistrate did I took bail for his appearance at our quarter sessions He appeared before us when by the permission of the chairman I took the lead in speaking I represented to the audience that the guards were intrusted with arms merely for the protection of the mail and the passengers not for the terror of his Majesty's subjects that a mailcoach was no sanctuary that the bailiff might drag the debtor out of it the constable the felon the exciseman might rummage it for contraband goods and that with as little ceremony as if it had been a higler's cart I farther added had the driver been the offender as the guard was he should have been taken into custody and the postmaster of the district left to provide another to convey the mail to the next stage The behaviour of the delinquent was so becoming his situation that by the leave of the court I dismissed the offender with such a reprimand as became the high station of a  British  justice of the peace an office in dignity and constitutional utility inferior to none in the land Young men of the age early initiate yourselves into that great character  I BEG pardon for detaining you so long but so much I thought was due to myself and to the public A few papers I have subjoined will fling some farther light on the subject as well as on my proceedings from the beginning I remain with much regard  DEAR SIR  Your faithful and affectionate humble servant THOMAS PENNANT  Georgestreet Hanoversquare  March    Downing  Feb    P S Notwithstanding the lenity shewn to the mail guard the drivers of the coaches continue their insolencies It has been a common practice with them to divert themselves with flinging out their lashes at harmless passengers by way of sun Very lately one of these wretches succeeded so well as to twist his lash round a poor fellow's neck in the parish I live He dragged the man under the wheels by which one of his arms was broken If ample satisfaction is not made an action shall be commenced against the proprietors of the coach who are certainly answerable for the misconduct of their people  LETTER to  Thomas Williams  Esq of  Llanidan  Member for the Borough of  Marlow  Downing  Oct    DEAR SIR  I AM much indebted to you for your late favor with an official letter inclosed I have no kind of doubt but that the comptroller general will on cool reconsideration of his design of altering the course of the  Irish  mail be induced to lay it totally aside He will admit the importance of the county of  Chester  in its ancient staple of the cheese on which our fleets and armies so greatly depend The city itself if I may judge by the frequent advertisements is about to enter deeply on the fustian manufacture The great remittances of taxes from the county and from great part of  North Wales  and the remittances to and from  Ireland  and those occasioned by the great biennial linen fairs must be flung into the scale  THE port of  ParkGate  has of late years risen into much consequence It at present maintains four stout pacquets which uninterruptedly ply between that port and  Dublin  The correspondencies of the numbers of passengers embarking or disembarking and the great remittances through this channel are of no small moment and of great general concern  THE county of  Flint  little as it is of itself thanks to you and other companies settling among us is now rising into an amazing state of opulence few perhaps can rival it Our ancient  cient lead trade was always considerable but by the introduction of the copper and cotton business  Holywell  its environs and their dependencies may boast of commercial property probably to the amount of a million sterling  I HAVE always considered Mr  Palmer  's plan as useful to his country and an honor to himself except in one article I can never suppose that he will persist in deviating from the utility of his scheme by diverting the mail from such a country as I have described  Shrewsbury  has already its mail after  Oswestry  is past the greatest part of the road to  Conwy  is mountainous poor and half depopulated  IT gives me concern to find our interests clash with those of the county of  Salop  I must allow the excellency of the great staples of its capital brawn and rich cakes but still we have the balance in our favor for on the most exact and impartial calculation I do not find that at present the annual consumption of both together can possibly exceed the sum of l s ¾d  THE exceptionable article I allude to is the exemption of the mailcoaches from tolls This falls heavy on the lesser districts possibly we might have endured even that had we not been insulted with indictments and compelled to repairs beyond the real wants of the country That is now over we only wish the restoration of our lost tolls to enable us to support the roads in the present state and to take away all future grounds of complaint from every quarter This will induce me to persist in my design of applying to parlement for redress of the grievance that affects the gates from  Chester  to  Conwy  let the rich  English  districts take what share they please in their own concerns There is one difficulty in  Flintshire  in respect to the road itselfI mean  Rhiallt Hill  the alteration is beyond the power of the poor parish it lies in and beyond the power of the poor  Mostyn  district to effect Possibly the improvement may cost from l to l a sum adequate to the estimate has been raised by the voluntary subscription of the neighboring gentlemen and the placo mostly complained of has been most nobly improved at the expence of l s d I wish a small sum might be got from parlement for that and the relief of a few other poor townships I cannot bear to drive over roads smoothed by the bread of the poor peasantry If the mail will be permanent I will cheerfully subscribe fifty guineas towards that improvement I shall conclude with saying that a small addition to the fare of passengers between  Chester  and  Conwy  will indemnify the coach from the loss by toll Let Mr  Palmer  who cannot but be fertile in expedients consider of the matter My earnest wish is to have harmony restored and the strongest mutual efforts made for the general good  I am DEAR SIR Your most obedient humble servant THOMAS PENNANT  A LETTER to the worshipful  Peter Broster  Esq Mayor of  Chester  Downing  January    SIR  ON  Thursday  two letters were laid by Mr  Smalley  before the commissioners of the  Flint Holywell  and  Mostyn  districts signed  D Smith  and  G Boulton  in which our attention was requested to the repair of the roads which lay in our county in the course of the mail It falls to my lot to desire you to communicate to your respectable corporation what the commissioners have done and what they intend to do of their own proper motions not from the fear of any of the very unbecoming menaces sent forth  ON the road from  Holywell  to the extremity of the district which is called the  Flint  has been laid out within two years l in the space of five miles great part of which long before the indictments was in most admirable repair  THE  Mostyn  district begins at the western end of the  Flint  much of it is in very good order part is very indifferent owing to the impoverished state of the  Mostyn  district and to the inability of the poor inhabitants of the township in which  Rhiallthill  lies to repair that part which is bad by nature I propose a subscription you see my offer in the inclosed We look up to the city of  Chester  as both are engaged in a common cause  THE  Holywell  district is excepting near  Halkin  in excellent  repair The part complained of will be attended to at the next meeting at  Holywell  at eleven o'clock on  Wednesday  the th of  February  We shall be happy to see any gentlemen on the part of your city  EXCUSE me if I remind the city of  Chester  the county and also the county of  Flint  that our importance is such that our demand of a mail is a matter of right not a petition for favor How superior is the justice of our claim to that of  Salop  which had long since its independent mail  IN respect to my particular actings I never will persist in any thing that is wrong nor desist from any thing that is right Our clame for abolishing the exemption from tolls is founded on common honesty My seizing on the guard was the act of an attentive magistrate to prevent future murders Two if not three had been committed one near  Conwy  another in  Anglesey  besides the terror spread along the whole road by the wanton conduct of the profligate guards I brought the affair before our quartersession more to set it in the true light than to punish the offender I was aspersed in your city but the examination wiped away the dirty paragraph  I am SIR Your most obedient humble servant THOMAS PENNANT  To the worshipful the Mayor of Chester  To the Printer of the SHREWSBURY CHRONICLE  Downing  August    SIR  I REQUEST you to lay before the public the following advertisement addressed by the commissioners of the  Mostyn  turnpike district in order to avert in future the hardships several of the townships of the county of  Flint  labor under in the repairs of the roads The advertisement itself relates to the greater part of the grievances It was sent to the paper too late to inform the  English  circuits but has been approved by the grand juries of  Cheshire Denbighshire  and  Flintshire  at the Spring assizes and by that of  Berkshire  and  Monmouthshire  being the Autumn assizes Let me here inform you that by indictments from the General PostOffice fines to the amount of l have been laid on the several townships lying in the course of the postroads in the little county of  Flint  many of which are very small and labour under the greatest poverty One in particular has a vast extent of road to repair and only a few labourers and four miserable teams to perform their statute labor Under those circumstances terrified with the prospect of ruin they performed twentytwo days statute duty The French  corvées  now so reasonably abolished were introduced on British ground yet in vain for a fine of l s was imposed on the poor people So little interested were they and  numbers of others of the  Welsh  townships in the passage of the mailcoach that possibly they do not receive a letter in a year yet these townships must suffer equally with the most opulent and commercial towns Many of the roads were unexceptionably repaired the rest were in sufficient repair for the uses of the farmer for the uses of the gentlemen's carriages and for the uses of the mail before the late unguarded innovations We are like the  Israelites  required to make brick without straw The means of repair are taken from us and we are fined for not performing impossibilities A postroad is a national concern that to a neighboring kingdom doubly so and certainly that consideration should induce legislature to afford an aid in such cases in which it is found necessary and if a road must be finished with finical perfection the expence ought never to fall on those who are totally uninterested in it Justice can never require that the poor should keep pace with the innovations made for the benefit of commerce or luxury Much of the roadlaws calls loudly for a reform in all laws there should be a point of limitation The attention of the grand juries is requested at the ensuing assizes It is hoped that they will direct their representatives to make the mailcoaches liable to tolls We mean no injury to Mr  Palmer  let him before the meeting of parlement suggest any remedy for the evil and we shall rest content They will certainly do away the great parlementary opprobrium of the act passed by their predecessors which lessens a security granted on the faith of parlement And much more may be said on this subject but the detail is reserved for another occasion you may be again  troubled with my complaints as well as some account of a township grievance brought on it by those whose peculiar office it was to have guarded against the deceptions which imposed on their judgment and brought on a most erroneous and disgraceful adjudication  I am Sir Your most obedient humble servant THOMAS PENNANT  GENERAL TURNPIKE CONCERN  AT a meeting of the trustees of the  Mostyn  turnpike held at the house of  Joseph Roberts  at the  Blue Bell  on  Saturday July  the state of the roads was taken into consideration  WHEN it appeared that parts of the coalroad were greatly out of repair the trade in which was the original foundation of this turnpike  THAT the present annual tolls are very inadequate to remedy the evil  THAT the failure of the tolls does not arise from any decay of trade in the country but from the exemption granted by parliament by the th  Geo  III c to the mailcoaches from the payment of any tolls  THAT by such exemption the common stagecoaches have been obliged to desist from travelling by reason of the burthen they are singly to sustain and which the mailcoaches are freed from and now in many places monopolize the business  THAT the  Mostyn  district alone suffers a loss of l a year which is the interest of l the loss of which prevents the trustees from the repairing of road equal to the expenditure of such a sum  THAT the clause of exemption in favor of the mailcoaches  is highly detrimental to the credit of the tolls and the fecurity of the lenders who had lent their money under the pledge of parliamentary faith  ORDERED That the expediency of petitioning parliament on this subject be farther taken into consideration and that these resolutions be published in the next  Chester  paper as they are public concerns every postroad and its several creditors being interested therein  THAT the sum of ten guineas be paid into the hands of the solicitor towards the expences of the proposed bill for repealing the exemption of tolls of the mailcoaches and for subjecting them to tolls in case such bill be brought into parliament and that the commissioners of the several turnpike districts in  Great Britain  be invited to correspond by their treasurers on the subject with  Samuel Small  treasurer of the  Flint  and  Holywell  districts and  John Lloyd  assistant treasurer of that of  Mostyn  THAT the thanks of the commissioners be given to the foremen and grand juries of the counties of  Cheshire Denbighshire  and  Flintshire  for their liberal concurrence with the resolutions of the commissioners of the  Mostyn  district  THAT it is requested of the gentlemen of this county to attend at  Mold  on  Saturday  the th of  April  to give a sanction to this proposal and to prepare one or more petitions or to give necessary instruction to the representatives of the county and borough c as may then be thought proper  AND in order to give force to this reasonable clame  on parliament it is recommended to the gentlemen of neighboring counties who may attend the duty of their country on the ensuing grand juries to take the above into consideration and add their weight to the common cause  Signed by order of the commissioners JOHN LLOYD  Assistant Clerk and Treasurer  APPENDIX N  o    MY LAST AND BEST WORK  THE dangerous designs of the  French  at this time became so evident as to induce some of my neighbors to call on me and request that I would take the lead and form an association for the defence of our religion constitution and property after the example of some of the  English  counties cities and towns my zeal readily prompted me to comply with their request and I drew up a requisition for a meeting in the following plain terms  REQUISITION  To the INHABITANTS and LANDOWNERS of the Parishes of
