 ROSINA A COMIC OPERA IN TWO ACTS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN  DUBLIN PRINTED BY B SMITH FOR THE COMPANY OF BOOKSELLERS MDCCLXXXIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE favourable reception this little Piece has met with from the Public demands my warmest acknowledgments nor can I say too much of the support it has received both from the music admirably adapted to the words and the spirited and judicious performance of the several characters which surpassed my most sanguine wishes  The decorations designed and executed in that style of elegant and characteristic simplicity which the subject requir'd add greatly to the effect of the whole  The fable of this piece taken from the book of Ruth a fable equally simple moral and interesting has already furnished a subject for the beautiful Episode of Palemon and Lavinia in Thomson's Seasons and a pleasing Opera of Mons Favart of both I have availed myself as far as the difference of my plan would allow but as we are not however extraordinary it may appear so easily satisfied with mere sentiment as our more sprightly neighbours the French I found it necessary to diversify the story by adding the comic characters of William and Phoebe which I hop'd might at once relieve and heighten the sentimental cast of the other personages of the drama  Some of the songs and a few short passages of the dialogue printed with inverted commas though judiciously omitted in the representation from the apprehension of making the Opera too long are here restor'd as tending to mark the characters with more precision  Dramatis

a spring of water rushes from the side and falls into a natural bason below on the right side a cottage at the door of which is a bench of stone At a distance a chain of mountains The manorhouse in view A field of corn fills up the scene  In the first act the sky clears by degrees the morning vapour disperses the sun rises and at the end of the act is above the horizon at the beginning of the second he is past the height and declines till the end of the day This progressive motion should be made imperceptibly but its effect should be visible through the two acts  ACT I SCENE  The day begins to break a few stars still appear after the Trio the sun is seen to rise The door of the cottage is open a lamp burning just within  Dorcas  seated on the bench is spinning  Rosina  and  Phoebe  just within the door are measuring a bushel of corn  William  comes from the top of the stage they sing the following Trio  WILLIAM ROSINA PHOEBE  WHEN the rosy morn appearing  Paints with gold the verdant lawn  Bees on banks of thyme disporting  Sip the sweets and hail the dawn  Warbling birds the day proclaiming  Carol sweet the lively strain  They forsake their leafy dwelling  To secure the golden grain  See content the humble gleaner  Take the scatter'd ears that fall  Nature all her children viewing  Kindly bounteous cares for all    William  retires  Ros  See my dear Dorcas what we glean'd yesterday in Mr Belville's fields  Coming forward and shewing the corn at the door  Dorc  Lord love thee but take care of thyself thou art but tender  Ros  Indeed it does not hurt me Shall I put out the lamp  Dor  Do dear the poor must be sparing    Rosina  going to put out the lamp  Dorcas  looks after her and sighs she returns hastily  Ros  Why do you sigh Dorcas  Dor  I canno' bear it its nothing to Phoebe and me but thou wast not born to labour  Rising and pushing away the wheel  Ros  Why should I repine Heaven which deprived me of my parents and my fortune left me health content and innocence Nor is it certain that riches lead to happiness Do you think the nightingale sings the sweeter for being in a gilded cage  Dor  Sweeter I'll maintain it than the poor little linnet which thou pick'st up half starv'd under the hedge yesterday after its mother had been shot and brought'st to life in thy bosom Let me speak to his honor he's main kind to the poor  Ros  Not for worlds Dorcas I want nothing you have been a mother to me  Dor  Wou'd I cou'd wou'd I cou'd I ha' work'd hard and 'arn'd money in my time but now I am old and feeble and am push'd about by every body  "Because I this summer am turn'd of fourscore  "They flout me and lay straws across at my door  "The bairns wicked bairns both at church and at green  "Make faces and jeer 'tis a shame to be seen  "Where I go I'm the jest of the lads and the lasses  "'Tis thus in life's winter a woman's time passes"  More's the pity I say it was not so in my young time but the world grows wicked every day  Ros  Your age my good Dorcas requires rest go into the cottage while Phoebe and I join the gleaners who are assembling from every part of the village  Dor  Many a time have I carried thy dear mother an infant in these arms little did I think a child of her's would live to share my poor pittanceBut I wo'not grieve thee    Dorcas  enters the cottage looking back affectionately at  Rosina  Phoe  What makes you so melancholy Rosina Mayhap it's because you have not a sweetheart But you are so proud you won't let our young men come anear you You may live to repent being so scornful  AIR  When  William  at eve meets me down at the stile  How sweet is the nightingale's song  Of the day I forget all the labour and toil  Whilst the moon plays yon branches among  By her beams without blushing I hear him complain  And believe every word of his song  You know not how sweet 'tis to love the dear swain  Whilst the moon plays yon branches among  During the last stanza  William  appears at the end of the scene and makes signs to  Phoebe  who when it is finish'd steals softly to him and they disappear  Ros  How small a part of my evils is poverty And how little does Phoebe know the heart she thinks insensible  The heart which nourishes a hopeless passion I blest like others Belville's gentle virtues and knew not that 'twas love Unhappy lost Rosina  AIR  The morn returns in saffron drest  But not to sad  Rosina  rest  The blushing morn awakes the strain  Awakes the tuneful choir  But sad  Rosina  ne'er again  Shall strike the sprightly lyre  Rustic  Between the Scenes  To work my hearts of oak to work here the sun is half an hour high and not a stroke struck yet  Enters singing followed by Reapers  AIR  See ye swains yon streaks of red  Call you from your slothful bed  Late you till'd the fruitful soil  See where harvest crowns your toil  CHORUS OF REAPERS  Late you till'd the fruitful soil  See where harvest crowns your toil  RUSTIC  As we reap the golden corn  Laughing Plenty fills her horn  What would gilded pomp avail  Should the peasant's labour fail  CHORUS OF REAPERS  What would gilded pomp avail  Should the peasant's labour fail  RUSTIC  Ripen'd fields your cares repay  Sons of labour haste away  Bending see the waving grain  Crown the year and chear the swain  CHORUS OF REAPERS  Bending see the waving grain  Crown the year and chear the swain  Rust  Hist there's his honor Where are all the lazy Irishmen I hir'd yesterday at market  Enter  Belville  followed by two  Irishmen  and Servants  st  Irish  Is it us he's talking of Paddy Then the devil may thank him for his good commendations  Bel  You are too severe Rustic the poor fellows came three miles this morning therefore I made them stop at the manorhouse to take a little refreshment  st  Irish  God love your sweet face my jewel and all those that take your part Bad luck to myself if I would not with all the veins of my heart split the dew before your feet in a morning  To  Belville  Rus  If I do speak a little cross it's for your honor's good  The Reapers cut the corn and make it into sheaves  Rosina  follows and gleans  Rus  seeing  Rosina    What a dickens does this girl do here Keep back wait till the reapers are off the field do like the other gleaners  Ros  Timidly  If I have done wrong Sir I will put what I have glean'd down again  She lets fall the ears she had glean'd  Bel  How can you be so unfeeling Rustic she is lovely virtuous and in want Let fall some ears that she may glean the more  Rus  Your honour is too good by half  Bel  No more gather up the corn she has let fall Do as I command you  Rus  There take the whole field since his honor chuses it  Putting the corn into her apron  Ros  I will not abuse his goodness  Retires gleaning  d  Irish  Upon my soul now his honor's no churl of the wheat whate'er he may be of the barley  Bel  Looking after  Rosina    What bewitching softness There is a blushing bashful gentleness an almost infantine innocence in that lovely countenance which it is impossible to behold without emotions She turns this way What bloom on that cheek 'Tis the blushing down of the peach  AIR  Her mouth which a smile  Devoid of all guile  Half opens to view  Is the bud of the rose  In the morning that blows  Impearl'd with the dew  More fragrant her breath  Than the flowerscented heath  At the dawning of day  The hawthorn in bloom  The lily's perfume  Or the blossoms of May  Enter Capt  Belville  in a riding dress  Capt Bel  Good morrow brother you are early abroad  Bel  My dear Charles I am happy to see you

desarve  this of you William But I'm rightly  sarved  for being such an easy fool You think mayhap I'm at my last prayers but you may find yourself mistaken  Will  You do right to cry out first you think belike that I did not see you take the posy from Harry  Phoe  And you belike that I did not catch you tying up one of the cornflowers and wild roses for the miller's maid But I'll be fool'd no longer I have done with you Mr William  Will  I shan't break my heart Mrs Phoebe The miller's maid loves the ground I walk on  AIR Duet  Will  I've kiss'd and I've prattled to fifty fair maids  And

the newshorn flock  Her breath like the newmade hay  Phoe  He's tall and he's strait as the poplar tree  His cheeks are as fresh as the rose  He looks like a 'squire of high degree  When drest in his Sunday cloaths  Phoe  There's fifty young men  c  Will  I've kiss'd and I've prattled  c  Go off on different sides of the stage  As they go off  Rosina  runs across the stage Capt  Belville

precious When the gleaning season is over will you make up my loss  Capt Bel  Yes  Ros  Will it be any advantage to you to make me lose my day's work  Capt Bel  Yes  Ros  Would it give you pleasure to see me pass all my days in idleness  Capt Bel  Yes  Ros  We differ greatly then Sir I only wish for so much leisure as makes me return to my work with fresh spirit We labour all the week 'tis true but

Dorc  And to what your honor may I owe this kindness  Capt Bel  You have a charming daughter  Dorc  Aside  I thought as much A vile wicked man  Capt Bel  Beauty like hers might find a thousand resources in London the moment she appears there she will turn every head  Dorc  And is your honour sure her own won't turn at the same time  Capt Bel  She shall live in affluence and take care of you too Dorcas  Dorc  I guess your honor's meaning but you are mistaken Sir If I must be a trouble to the dear child I had rather owe my bread to her labor than her shame  Goes into the cottage and shuts the door  Capt Bel  These women astonish me but I won't give it up so  AIR  From flower to flower gay roving  The wanton butterfly  Does Nature's charms descry  From flower to flower gay roving  The

William  turns looks at her whistles and plays with his stick  Will  That's Harry's posy the slut likes me still  Phoe  A side  That's a copy of his countenance I'm  sartin  he can no more help following me  nor  he can be hang'd  William crosses again singing  Of all the fair maidens that dance on the green  The maid of the mill for me  Phoe  I'm ready to choak  wi'  madness but I'll not

gay or silken glove  With eager haste I ran to buy  For what is gold compar'd to love  My posy on her bosom plac'd  Could Harry's sweeter scents exhale  Her auburn locks my ribbon grac'd  And flutter'd in the wanton gale  With scorn she hears me now complain  Nor can my rustic presents move  Her heart prefers a richer swain  And gold alas has banish'd love  Will  "I see Kate waiting for me Bye Phoebe"  Phoe  "Good bye to you"  Will  coming back  Let's part friendly howsomever Bye Phoebe I shall always wish you well  Phoe  Bye William  Cries wiping her eyes with her apron  Will  aside  My heart begins to melt a little  aloud  I lov'd you very well once Phoebe but you are grown so cross and have such vagaries  Phoe  I'm sure I never had no vagaries with you William But go mayhap Kate may be angry  Will  And who cares for she I never minded her  anger nor her coaxing neither till you were cross to me  Phoe  Holding up her hands  O the father I cross to you William  Will  Did not you tell me this very morning as how you had done wi' me  Phoe  One word's as good as a thousand Do you love me William  Will  Do I love thee Do I love dancing on the green better than thrashing in the barn Do I love a wake a harvesthome  Phoe  Then I'll never speak to Harry again the longest day I have to live  Will  I'll turn my back o' the miller's maid the first time I meet her  Phoe  Will you indeed and indeed  Will  Marry will I and more  nor  that I'll go speak to the parson this moment  Kisses her  I'm happierzooks I'm happier  nor  a lord or a squire of five hundred a year  Phoe  "Why dost talk of Lords and squires William we poor folks are happier by far if so be we are but content Did not the parson bid us mind how the storm bow'd the great trees on the hills whilst the little shrubs in the valley ne'er bent a head for the matter"  Will  "Thou say'st true Phoebe"  AIR Duet  Phoe  In gaudy courts with aching hearts  The great at Fortune rail  The hills may higher honours claim  But peace is in the vale  Will  See highborn dames in rooms of state  With midnight revels pale  No youth admires their fading charms  For beauty's in the vale  Both  Amid the shades the virgin's sighe  Add fragrance to the gale  So they that will may take the hill  Since love is in the vale  Exeunt arm in arm  Enter  Belville  Bel  I tremble at the impression this lovely girl has made upon my heart My chearfulness has left me and I am grown insensible even to the delicious pleasure of making those happy who depend on my protection  AIR  Ere bright  Rosina  met my eyes  How peaceful pass'd the joyous day  In rural sports I gain'd the prize  Each virgin listen'd to my lay  But now no more I touch the lyre  No more the rustic sport can please  I live the slave of fond desire  Lost to myself to mirth and ease  The tree that in a happier hour  It's boughs extended o'er the plain  When blasted by the lightning's power  Nor charms the eye nor shades the swain  Enter  William  He speaks between the scenes  Will  "Here's his honor Phoebe wait for me at the stile  bowing  Please your honor I am sent to tell you Dorcas and Rosina have found a purse  Bel  Does any body claim it  Will  No Sir  Bel  Let them keep it William  Will  But they charg'd me please your honor to give it you  Bel  Go William and carry it back  Will  aside  He put it there himself I thought so 'tis so like him I shall your honor"  Exit  William  Bel  Since the sun rose I have been in continual exercise I feel exhausted and will try to rest a quarter of an hour on this bank  Lies down on a bank by the fountain  Gleaners pass the stage with sheaves of corn on their heads last  Rosina  who comes forward singing  AIR  Light as thistle down moving which floats on the air  Sweet gratitude's

Bel  Forget this you are safe But tell me Rosina for the question is to me of importance have I not seen you wear this ribbon  Ros  Forgive me Sir I did not mean to disturb you I only meant to shade you from the too great heat of the sun  Bel  To what motive do I owe this tender attention  Ros  Ah Sir Do not the whole village love you  Bel  "At this moment Rosina think me a brother or a friend a thousand times more affectionate than a brother" You tremble why are you alarm'd  DUET  BELVILLE AND ROSINA  Belville  taking her hand  For you my sweet maid nay be not afraid    Rosina  withdraws her

"Dear soul not a bit of pride"  Bel  Rosina has referr'd me to you Dorcas for an account of her birth which I have long suspected to be above her present situation  Dorc  To be sure your honor since

portion They say if Rosina had a friend she might get the estate again by paying the mortgage  Bel  And her father  Dor  Was a brave gentleman too a colonel A charming couple they were and lov'd one another so it would have done your heart good to see them His honor went to the Eastern Indies to better his fortune and Madam would go wi' him The ship was lost and they with all the little means
