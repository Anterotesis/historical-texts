A surly farmer  Landlord  Puritan  Countryman  WOMEN  Mrs  Wealthy  Wife to Wealthy  Maria  Her daughter in love with Trueman  Betty  The maid in the interest of Maria  Mrs  Blunt  Wife to Blunt  Wife to Puritan  Waiters Children Mob  and  Attendants  The Representation of particular Scenes is submitted to Mr Hogarth's excellent Prints of an Election  THE COUNTRY ELECTION  ACT I  SCENE I  A Room  Enter  MARIA  and  BETTY  meeting  BETTY  _LORD Miss Maria not dressed yet Why there'll be a world of folks here presentlyespecially as my master has given it out that he intends keeping open house till the day of Election in favour of Sir Harry Simple  MARIA  Don't talk to me of dress nor Sir Harry neither I hate himI wish  he  had been fixed to a stake and burnt yesterday instead of his effigy  BETTY  O fie Miss you should not wish such cruel wishes as that  MARIA  Indeed I do But prithee trouble me no more about  him  have you seen Mr Trueman today  BETTY  Love as the saying is has given him wings I saw him fly by the house once or twice but  could not get to speak to him He's purely busy in Squire Artful's cause not indeed out of any respect to him but merely to oppose that goose SimpleWell I  do  think it a whimsical notion of my master not to marry his daughter but to one of those  yeaandnay  creatures called a Member of Parliament  MARIA  Marry BettyWhy if he carries his Election I won't have himI'd run to Scotland first a poor shallowpated fop so he may save himself both the trouble and expence  BETTY  So say I Miss To be sure Mr Trueman is a much more  properer  man and as we say in our country  has  got some guts in his brains  MARIA  If it was not for my mamma my pappa would be well enough but she's always dinging in his ears family places interest and such stuff For my part I don't see what interest she'd have if all her relations were in parliament unless it were to frank her nonsense into every part of the kingdom which now she can't convey without adding something to the revenue  BETTY  Why there would be something in that and not the worse for us for the more she'd write the less she'd talk Butbless me who comes yonder If Mr Trueman is not coming thro' the hall in disguise with some of the folks  MARIA  Is he indeedrun then Betty and take care neither my pappa and mamma comes into the room while he is here  BETTY  Make good use of your time for depend upon it you can't be long together  Exit  Enter  TRUEMAN  in Boots disguised like a Countryman  TRUEMAN  looking about  HistMariaare we alone  MARIA  I would not for the world Mr Trueman any of the family should see you here I should lead a weary life if they did  TRUEMAN  It happens very fortunately for us that your father now keeps open house as I can slip in and out unperceived I provided this dress on purpose as in case we  should  be seen together I may pass off undiscovered  MARIA  'Twas a good thought but tell me how have you sped  TRUEMAN  As well as I could wish I  do  believe the day's our own Artful readily accepted of my services and I have been indefatigable in his interest up night and day you see my life what  you  can spur me to I shall think my labour well repaid if but at last I call Maria  mine  MARIA  I make no doubt but both my pappa and mamma may be brought to give their consent if we can but upset this scheme of Simple's  TRUEMAN  Never doubt it I'll try  my  best for it I hav'n't been within a pair of sheets these six nights no  messenger or mailcarrier has rid at once more miles with greater expedition than I in canvassing this country for Votes But when Love dictates its votaries must obey  MARIA  Indeed Mr Trueman I am greatly obliged to you and heartily wish you may succeed  TRUEMAN  Pray heaven we may but believe me 'tis hot work Simple tho' a mere fool seems to have plenty of money which he makes fly like wild fire and gold Maria in this as well as in every other case is the most prevailing argument a man can use I could get no admittance any where without first shewing my ticket Indeed Artful's tongue being so well oiled saves him many a guinea the women are all in his interest and then you know the men they follow of course  MARIA  If gaining the favour of the women Mr Trueman is necessary he could not have a better friend on this occasion than you  TRUEMAN  bows  Gad so your mother  BETTY  without loud  Miss Maria's in the next room Ma'am shall I call her  Mrs  W  without  No no I'll go to her  Enter  BETTY  frightened running before and Mrs  WEALTHY  in seeming haste when she sees  TRUEMAN  she stops short  MARIA  to  TRUEM  I am persuaded Sir your giving your vote to Sir Harry will greatly oblige my father  Mrs  W  Who is this man daughter  MARIA  He tells me he belongs to the next parish mamma that he is a freeholder and has influenced several neighbours in favour of Sir Harry  TRUEM  in a feigned voice  An I had twenty Votes I'd gee um aal to he if t'were only on Squoire Wealthy's account  BETTY  aside  Faith leave  him  alone for a scheme O he's a charming man  Mrs  W  confused  My good neighbour I beg your pardonI thought it had been someIndeed Sir I thank you and when Mr Wealthy sees you he shall thank you too I assure you Sir Harry is a very  fine  gentleman and more than that is determined if chose right or wrong  always  to vote against the court  Aside to Maria  I tell  him  so you know tho' that would not be the way to swell our interest and get a place for your cousin Tom  To Trueman  For the courtWell go backward friend into the saloon you will see many of your acquaintance there and get something to refresh you for you seem almost choaked with dust  Exit Truem looking at Maria  MARIA  aside  A lucky escape indeed  Mrs  W  Come girl go get your cap on at present you are hardly fit to be seen I expect Sir Harry here shortly 'Twill be a charming thing Maria if he gets chose for the county 'twill be the  making of us all Your father shall have a place in the  Chequer  for he loves to be counting of money I'll be mistress of the robes you shall be a woman of the bedchamber and as for cousin Tom he shall beWhat shall he beNo matter I'll think for  him  byandby  BETTY  And I Madam you have forgot me  Mrs  W  Behave but well and you shall belet me see you shall besweeper of the Mall  MARIA  Ay but mamma  Mrs  W  Come away away don't stand talking I have always told you one talker in a family's enough go get yourself dressed  Exit Maria  BETTY  aside  And that she's determined shall be herself for she'll let nobody hardly edge in a wordSweeper of the Mall  going  Mrs  W  Betty  BETTY  Ma'am  Mrs  W  Is the drawing room fit to receive company  BETTY  Yes Ma'am  Mrs  W  Go then tell your master to make haste into the saloon to his guests  Betty going  and d'ye hear  returning  tell John to hang the silver cistern up in the saloon and let it run with port  wine till the clock strikes four  going    and stay  returning  let me seetell Willare the two ventilators fixed I am sure we shall have need of them for the whole house smells now as hot and frouzy as a beggar's bedchamber with these dirty fellows in itHah why don't you answer me  BETTY  They are Ma'am  Mrs  W  Wellthen you may go  Betty going  But heark'ye  returning  tell Will I'd have him wait above  going  and  returning  let that new sleepy fellow with the scripture name there  BETTY  Hezekiah  Mrs  W  Ay I don't know what you call himtell  him  to attend the door keep both his eyes open and watch that nothing is taken out of the house  Betty going  and  returning  see that every thing is as it should be  Exit  BETTY  If every thing  was  as it should be one would think your tongue  should be  tired but that's out of the nature of things  Exit  SCENE

Mob  break their heads a parcel of scoundrels  They fight Artful's mob is beat off Exit Mob hollowing  'Fore Gad nothing like a little gold to make one beloved  CRAFTY  If gold will do and faith I never knew it fail yet we shall carry it in spite of Artful's devilish hypocrisy  QUIRK  I never was fond of clandestine proceedings buthowever of two evils we are to choose the least now bribery alone is  not  so bad as bribery and hypocrisy together  Sir  HARRY  Let Artful salve over the matter as he pleases if he gives but a penny he comes within the oath as much as if he gave a pound  QUIRK  And let him give it under what pretence he will in  foro conscientiae  'tis bribery nevertheless therefore we have this satisfaction that if we are no  better  than other people thank heaven and our own virtue we are no  worse  Sir  HARRY  to  CRAFTY  Have you ordered the music and cleavers to meet us in CocksheetHollow on Wednesday morning in time  CRAFTY  I have appointed them there by ten lest Artful's party should parade it into town before us  Sir  HARRY  warmly  Confound Artful and his party too Double my numbers Quirk and not suffer the scoundrels to enter the town at all  QUIRK  Nothat won't dothat won't do were we to carry it under those circumstances it would be deemed no election they'd bring it into the house and swear their voters could not poll for fear of their lives  Sir  HARRY  Well gentlemen I shall leave these matters wholly to you I hope there is not much doubt of success  CRAFTY  Nothing is certain but by what I can see we have as good as if not better of it than Artful  QUIRK  You must spare no expence if you do in my opinion 'tis over with you Artful's plea upon all occasions is  I'm no Courtier  tho' 'twas but the other day I saw him following the breech of my Lord M'Sawney into the great house at the bottom of St James's Street  Sir  HARRY  You should tell some devilish lie or another Can't you say that I'll get the militia bill and the beer act repealed ortell 'em I'll get an act passed that every man shall be at liberty to leave his wife at the expiration of three years if he does not like her and marry again  CRAFTY  Ha ha ha I don't know what that indeed might do but as to the militia bill and the beer act they'll now go no more down with the people than stale small beer to a man that is not thirsty  Sir  HARRY  apart  'Twill be confounded hard to lose it after spending so much moneyLose itI must not think of itIf I do I'm ruinedI have been now obliged to borrow a considerable sum However if I get the girl she has fortune enough to set all to rights again  QUIRK  apart to  CRAFTY  Who shall touch him for the next five hundred you or I  CRAFTY  apart to  QUIRK  No matter whichI will you had the last  to Sir Harry  Why so thoughtful Sir  Harry  keep up your spirits man or we lose the cause  Sir  HARRY  I have been considering gentlemen how much I am obliged to you What could I have done without you  Should  I succeed you shall not find me ungrateful  QUIRK  Should  Let us not suppose a doubtMoney must certainly carry it The generality of freeholders especially the lower sort would not only sell their country but they'd part with their wives and children could they get any thing for 'em  CRAFTY  The great inconsistency of these people often makes me smile they sell themselves and then wonder and are displeased at being sold  Sir  HARRY  'Fore Gad that's true enough  to Quirk  How have you done in the lower part of the county  QUIRK  Damn the lower part I found 'em as mercenary and venal as they could well be Many of them turned up their noses at  five  pieces I was obliged to give them ten and at one place I was under a necessity of entertaining the girls with the humours of Mr Punch  that  cost me fifty I should have done nothing if I had'nt for the tongues of the men and women in that place are like the strings of a fiddle equally tuned in perfect unison What one cries the other answers  Sir  HARRY  The women in some places have a wonderful attraction ha ha ha Have  you  Crafty finished in the upper part  CRAFTY  Not quite I have a parish or two to canvass yet indeed I should not have been here had'nt I got to the bottom of my purseI must have another five hundred  Sir  HARRY  taking out a pocket book and giving him a note  Must you Blessings go with it then Nothing venture they say nothing have A day or two now will determine all My friend Wealthy has opened his house in my interest and I have promised to attend him every day between this and Wednesday therefore you must excuse me I presume I shall see you some time tomorrow you will find me either there or at the old place  Exit  QUIRK  Now we are alone tell me Crafty how you succeeded last week  CRAFTY  I'll deal frankly with you for rogues are generally honest to one anotherI made a complete thousandI got a cool hundred out of one parish  QUIRK  Then you have done better than I for what with presents balls feasting and puppetshews I hav'n't been able to save quite seven hundred and when I gave him in the account he thought I had been too profuse  CRAFTY  Zounds man you don't take the right step Did you make the landlords of public houses your friends tip them but a piece or two extraordinary and they'll give you a receipt for double  the money you spend They daren't cry out for fear of betraying themselves  QUIRK  All  that  I took care to do  CRAFTY  Did you enter in your account so much to ringers so much to fidlers so much to tatlers  QUIRK  Tatlers who are they  CRAFTY  Why the old women  QUIRK  Indeed I never thought of them  CRAFTY  Not fee the old women then you hav'n't done either Sir Harry or yourself justiceIt would not only have swelled the account but tip an old woman's tongue with gold and she'll talk you off in such gilded strains as shall do you more essential service than all you give besides Oh the old women the tatlers as I call them have a power of talking you black or white just as disposition leads 'em Whatever you dosecure the old women  QUIRK  Live and learn's an old proverbI presume you include the parson and the apothecary in the number of the old women  CRAFTY  DoubtlessThey are the belweathers of a parish they are the main springs that set the female tongue agoing Nothing in this point can ever be done without the parson and the apothecary  QUIRK  'Tis impossible Simple could have employed a better man in this business than you Crafty you seem perfectly acquainted with it and can fall in with the taste of all ranks of peopleI'll be bold to say you will eat drink lie swear and whore with any man in the three kingdoms  CRAFTY  Ha ha ha Necessity has no law there's no carrying the point without it The better we keep up the spirit of the thing the greater advantage we shall reap I'd see Simple at the devil before I'd take so much pains if I hadn't a feeling in it If he is returned he marries the girl her fortune is paid and I hope we shall have some of the fingering it If not as we shall have the bonds he has given us ready in force we'll execute the writs and secure the money while he has any to pay  Apeing Sir Harry  I have been considering gentlemen how much I amobliged to youHah Quirkbut come let's away we'll defer our settling till the business is done  Exeunt  SCENE IV  A Room in an Alehouse  Enter  ARTFUL  and  LANDLORD  ARTF  I hope she'll send him back again Landlord  LANDL  No fear your honourI never knew her ge'an to falsifications in my born days  ARTF  Well make us a bowl of your best punch probably he may be here by that time    Exit  Landlord    Never was I more at a loss in my life than I am at present how I shall heat this surly wretch apply to him I must as I am told he has great influence among his neighbours'Tis according as it hitsI shall be heartily glad when this day's over  Reenter  LANDLORD  LANDL  Measter Blunt's just come your honour  ARTF  Oh he ispray desire him to walk inand bring the liquor  Exit Landl  Now must I have all my wits about me  Reenter  LANDLORD  with a bowl of punch and  BLUNT  ARTF  running and squeezing Blunt by the hand  My dear friend Mr Blunt I am heartily glad to see you  BLUNT  aside  Mayhap so but 'tis for his own ends I supposeWhy hadn't he kissed me as he did my wife  to Artf  Your servant Sir What is your business with me  ARTF  As to business Mr Bluntwe'll leave that alone I never talk of business so abruptly Come sit down and take a glass of punch  BLUNT  aside  I never am against that  ARTF  You have no objections to our Landlord's company I hope  BLUNT  None at all Bluffer's an  honest  fellow  They all sit  ARTF  Here's your good health Mr Blunt  drinks  BLUNT  Thank you Sirto yours  drinks  ARTF  Landlord fill your glass and drink to our good friend here  LANDL  Measter Blunt my service to you  drinks  BLUNT  shaking his head aside  All this won't do  to Landl  Measter Bluffer I thank you  ARTF  What's the best news Mr Blunt in this part of the country  BLUNT  News quotherThis damn'd militia bill continues to make such confusion in this place that I wish that man's tail had been on fire that first proposed it  ARTF  I am very sorry you should entertain so bad an opinion  BLUNT  interrupting him  Sorrybad an opinionpox on'tdon't tell me that we're to maintain the brats of a parcel of lazy idle scoundrels that at certain times make it their business to loiter about the country pilfering and stealing every thing they can lay their hands on No no Mr ArtfulSir Harry Simple thinks as I do  ARTF  Whatever Sir Harry may  think  I am convinced the act has now been so long established 'tis out of any man's power to alter it  BLUNT  And then there's your beer and cyder act add to that the exorbitant price of provisions look about look about the poor are  starving  every where  ARTF  Starving Mr Blunt  BLUNT  aping  ARTF  Starving Mr Bluntyes starvingWould you have 'em eat horsedung  ARTF  Bread  seems to be the most material thing and I cannot see how they can lower the price of that without injuring the farmer Rents are dear taxes are high and hands scarce  LANDL  Indeed they are No one can tell where the shoe pinches so well as he that wears it I hav'n't above ten acres and yet  I  can feel it  BLUNT  Bread neighbour Bluffer's the least on't let 'em take the taxes off other articles and then we shall see who's to fault the Parliament or the farmer  ARTF  Nothing would make me happier than to have it in my power to be instrumental to the good of my countrymen Give me leave to drink to your good families health Landlord here's Mrs Blunt and her little ones    drinks    all drink    You have three mighty pretty children Mr Blunt  BLUNT  They are well

BLUNT  May hap I haveand mayhap I hav'n't that's nothing to no body  ARTF  to  LANNDL  Mr Blunt is right a freeholder in that respect is a  free  man and I have this opinion of Mr Blunt that no money or interest will induce him to give his vote from his friend  BLUNT  aside  But you're damnably mistaken  ARTF  to  BLUNT  And I flatter myself my good man that I have always lived in such repute as to have the voice of every one in this place and among the rest that of yours  BLUNT  aside  AdodThat's flattery with a vengeance  ARTF  But come my friend drink t'other glass  helps him  Here's prosperity to this place  they all drink  BLUNT  I don't know You called on my wife she tells me  ARTF  About two hours ago and was pleased to see her look so well  BLUNT  Yes  ARTF  And I told her

very frank indeedbut as I often say  He that plays at bowls must expect some rubs  Exit  END of ACT I  ACT II  SCENE I  A Parlour  Enter  BETTY  BETTY  The continual noise and hurry in this house ever since my master has opened his doors has almost made me distracted There's nothing done but running backwards and forwards all day long I never saw so much eating and drinking in any house since I've been a servant Guttle guttle guttle and then as to liquor in my mind as fast as they pour it in it runs out I do believe John hasn't emptied our large pewter jordan less than  twenty  times this morning  going out meets Maria entering  A letter from Mr Trueman Miss  giving a letter  MARIA  Is any one waiting  BETTY  The man that brought it said it did not require an answer  MARIA  reads the

Betty  Enter  MARIA  Mrs  W  Maria is it not very unaccountable that your father should send no kind of word  MARIA  Perhaps it goes hard against Sir Harry and my Papa waits till the poll takes a better turn  Mrs  W  Tell me not of  better  or  worse  I believe in my heart if he does not carry it I shall go distracted  MARIA  I'm sorry mamma to see you so much concerned about it what advantage will it be to you if he is returned  Mrs  W  How can you ask that nonsensical question Will it be no advantage to have the disposal of  many places about the Court Will it be no advantage to be importuned for our interest Will it be no advantage to have one's daughter the wife of a member of parliament  MARIA  Mamma you quite astonish me do you think  Mrs  W  If he does not gain it I'll have nothing to say to himyou shan't have him let Mr Wealthy say what he will  MARIA  With respect to that you may be perfectly easy for I would not be the wife of so illiterate a fop was he possessed of the first seat in the House of Lords  Mrs  W  You're thinking of that low bred fellow Trueman now  MARIA  Mr Trueman is a gentleman a man of some honour and had  he  stood for the county would have carried it in spite of fate but Sir Harry is such an ignorant coxcomb that had he spent ten times the sum he has I'm persuaded it must have been to little purposeI fear you have only disgraced yourselves in espousing  his  cause  Mrs  W  Girl cease your impertinence  MARIA  If you and my pappa are determined your soninlaw shall be a knight of the shire you need only consent to my marriage with Mr Trueman support him as heartily as you have done Sir Harry and I'll be bound you'll succeed  Mrs  W  How's that Maria  listening greedily  MARIA  I say mamma as I am an only child and my pappa does not want for money let him consent to my marrying Mr Trueman put him up for the county the next vacancy support him as he has done Sir Harry and there's no doubt he'll carry it for in his canvass

calculations in my life  Mrs  W  Some of 'em surely must have turned tail or Artful could never have carried it two to one  Mr  W  Trueman was the means of his succeeding had  he  opposed 'em he'd have thrown 'em both  MARIA  Just as I said mamma  Mrs  W  Said  you foolI hav'n'r patience Where's Sir Harry  Mr  W  There I supposeI left him among 'em We made a pretty appearance toobutFortune was

Harrytherehe's ruined and charges me with his undoing he says he was obliged to borrow a large sum on account of this election that he depended on success and thought to have repaid it with my daughter's fortune that he has been betrayed by Quirk and Crafty that bonds he's given are put in execution against him that he has not a farthing left has therefore gone out of the way and says nothing can retrieve him but an alliance with my familya mighty pretty scoundrelThis wife is  your  doing  Mrs  W  My  doing Mr Wealthy You know as how we thought he was a man of fortune or I never should have consented to his marrying my daughter  MARIA  'Tis well pappa 'tis no worse I am delivered from a bad husband and you freed from a wicked villain  Mr  W  I question whether the scoundrel's a  Baronet  TRUEM  If report speaks true he's all that's bad Many an honest man in town will be a loser by him the publican's bills I fear will come short of payment  BETTY  to  MARIA  'Tis an ill wind that blows no body good  Mr  W  All the praises of the day have been in favour of that Trueman had I stirred as much for him  as I've done for t'other we should not have set down under this disgrace  Mrs  W  You may do that next time for your daughter's determined to have him and I'm resolved my soninlaw shall be in parliament  MARIA  Indeed pappa Mr Trueman is possessed of such good qualities as do honour to the gentleman tho' he is not so rich as some you are sensible a fortune with us is not so great an object of attention as honour and honesty  Mr  W  All that without book huzzy  MARIA  Besides Sir my future happiness is wrapt up in  him  and I have always had reason to believe you wish for nothing more than to see your only child settled  happily  in the world  Mrs  W  I have given  my  consent to the match ever since I heard of Artful's being returned and would have  you  do so too  aside  besides I would do it purely to be revenged of  Simple  c  ing us with his ruina paltry fellow  Mr  W  Well I'll hear what he has to say one of these days  TRUEM  throwing off his disguise  Then let that day be nowSee Sir before you that Trueman you have been pleased to think so favourably of and suffer him to say that if he could obtain your consent    addressing himself to  both    to marry miss Maria the daily study of his life should be to make her happy and repay your kindness with filial gratitude  WEALTHY  astonished  How's all this  TRUEM  Meeting with the man appointed to deliver that letter and desiring to see the object of my love I procured this upper habit at the expence of a crown promising to deliver it for himHe is waiting at the next public house for an answer  Mrs  W  angrily  We'll  send him an answer presently  Mr  W  That man must be an unaccountable being that does not respect one of whom the whole country speaks so well Let us then repair a broken alliance which must have been dreadful in its consequences by that of one which bodes a deal of good Take my girl  joining Trueman's and Maria's hand  with all a father's wishes make her a good husband and teach the world that  honesty is the best policy  and that 'tis more noble to espouse integrity than to stand forth in the cause of iniquity  Exeunt omnes  END of ACT II  FINIS
