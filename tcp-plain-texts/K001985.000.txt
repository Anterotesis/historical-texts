 LOVE  for  LOVE  A COMEDY Acted at the THEATRE in  LittleLincoln'sInnFields  BY His Majesty's Servants  Written by Mr  CONGREVE  Nudus agris nudus nummis paternis  Insanire parat certa ratione modoque  Hor  The FOURTH EDITION  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  And Sold by  R Wellington G Strahan  and  B Lintott    To the Right Honourable CHARLES Earl of  Dorset  and  Middlesex  Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter c  MY LORD  A Young Poet is liable to the same Vanity and Indiscretion with a Young Lover and the Great Man that smiles upon one and the Fine Woman that looks kindly upon t'other are each of 'em in Danger of having the Favour publish'd with the first Opportunity  But there may be a different Motive which will a little distinguish the Offenders For tho' one should have a Vanity in ruining another's Reputation yet the other may only have an Ambition to advance his own And I beg leave my Lord that I may plead the latter both as the Cause and Excuse of this Dedication  Whoever is King is also the Father of his Country and as no Body can dispute Your Lordship's  Monarchy  in  Poetry  so all that are concern'd ought to acknowledge Your Universal Patronage And it is only presuming on the Privilege of a Loyal Subject that I have ventur'd to make this my Address of Thanks to your Lordship which at the same time includes a Prayer for Your Protection  I am not Ignorant of the Common Form of Poetical Dedications which are generally made up of Panegyricks where the Authors endeavour to distinguish their Patrons by the shining Characters they give them above other Men But that my Lord is not my Business at this time nor is Your Lordship  now  to be distinguish'd I am contented  with the Honour I do my self in this Epistle without the Vanity of attempting to add to or explain Your Lordship's Character  I confess it is not without some struggling that I behave my self in this Case as I ought For it is very hard to be pleased with a Subject and yet forbear it But I chuse rather to follow  Pliny  's Precept than his Example when in his Panegyrick to the Emperor  Trajan  he says  Nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati  possint Quam quid virtutibus debeatur  I hope I may be excus'd the Pedantry of a Quotation when it is so justly apply'd Here are some Lines in the Print and which Your Lordship read before this Play was Acted that were omitted on the Stage and particularly one whole Scene in the Third Act which not only helps the Design forward with less Precipitation but also heightens the ridiculous Character of  Foresight  which indeed seems to be maim'd without it But I found my self in great Danger of a long Play and was glad to help it where I could Tho' notwithstanding my Care and the kind Reception it had from the Town I could heartily wish it yet shorter But the Number of different Characters represented in it would have been too much crowded in less room  This Reflection on Prolixity a Fault for which scarce any one Beauty will attone warns me not to be tedious now and detain Your Lordship any longer with the Trifles of  MY LORD  Your Lordship's most Obedient and most Humble Servant William Congreve  A PROLOGUE FOR The Opening of the New PlayHouse  propos'd to be spoken by Mrs  Bracegirdle  in Man's Cloaths  Sent from an unknown Hand  CUstom which every where bears mighty Sway  Brings me to Act the Orator to Day  But Women you will say are ill at Speeches  'Tis true and therefore I appear in Breeches  Not for Example to you CityWives  That by Prescription's settled for your Lives  Was it for Gain the Husband first consented  O yes their Gains are mightily augmented  Making Horns with her Hands over her Head  And yet methinks it must have cost some Strife  A Passive Husband and an Active Wife  'Tis aukward very aukward by my Life  But to my Speech Assemblies of all Nations  Still are suppos'd to open with Orations  Mine shall begin to shew our Obligations  To you our Benefactors lowly Bowing  Whose Favours have prevented our Undoing  A long  Egyptian  Bondage we endur'd  'Till Freedom by your Justice we procur'd  Our Taskmasters were grown such very Jews  We must at length have Play'd in Wooden Shoos  Had not your Bounty taught us to refuse  Freedom's of  English  Growth I think alone  What for lost  English  Freedom can attone  A Freeborn Player loaths to be compell'd  Our Rulers Tyranniz'd and We Rebell'd  Freedom the Wise Man's Wish the Poor Man's Wealth  Which you and I and most of us enjoy by Stealth  The Soul of Pleasure and the Sweet of Life  The Woman's Charter Widow Maid or Wife  This they'd have cancell'd and thence grew the Strife  But you perhaps wou'd have me here confess  How we obtain'd the FavourCan't you guess  Why then I'll tell you for I hate a Lie  By Brib'ry errant Brib'ry let me die  I was their Agent but by  Jove  I swear  No honourable Member had a share  Tho' young and able Members bid me Fair  I chose a wiser way to make you willing  Which has not cost the House a single Shilling  Now you suspect at least I went a Billing  Y  see I'm Young and to that Air of Youth  Some will add Beauty and a little Truth  These pow'rful Charms improv'd by pow'rful Arts  Prevail'd to captivate your op'ning Hearts  Thus furnish'd I preferr'd my poor Petition  And brib'd ye to commiserate our Condition  I laugh'd and sigh'd and sung and leer'd upon ye  With roguish loving Looks and that way won ye  The Young Men kiss'd me and the Old I kiss'd  And luringly I led them as I list  The Ladies in meer Pity took our Parts  Pity's the Darling Passion of their Hearts  Thus Bribing or thus Brib'd fear no Disgraces  For thus you may take Bribes and keep your Places  PROLOGUE  Spoken at the Opening of the New House By Mr  Betterton  THE Husbandman in vain renews his Toil  To cultivate each Tear a hungry Soil  And fondly hopes for rich and generous Fruit  When what shou'd feed the Tree devours the Root  Th' unlanden Boughs he sees bode certain Dearth  Unless transplanted to more kindly Earth  So the poor Husbands of the Stage who found  Their Labours lost upon th' ungrateful Ground  This last and only Remedy have prov'd  And hope new Fruit from ancient Stocks remov'd  Well may they hope when you so kindly aid  And plant a Soil which you so rich have made  As Nature gave the World to Man's first Age  So from your Bounty we receive this Stage  The Freedom Man was born to you've restor'd  And to our World such Plenty you afford  It seems like  Eden  fruitful of its own Accord  But since in  Paradise  frail Flesh gave way  And when but two were made both went astray  Forbear your Wonder and the Fault forgive  If in our larger Family we grieve  One falling  Adam  and one tempted  Eve  We who remain would gratefully repay  What our Endeavours can and bring this Day  The Firstfruit Off'ring of a Virgin Play  We hope there's something that may please each Taste  And tho' of homely Fare we make the Feast  Yet you will find Variety at least  There's Humour which for chearful Friends we got  And for the thinking Party there's a Plot  We've something too to gratifie ill Nature  If there be any here and that is Satire  Tho' Satire scarce dares grin 'tis grown so mild  Or only shews its Teeth as if it smil'd  As Asses Thistles Poets mumble Wit  And dare not bite for fear of being bit  They hold their Pens as Swords are held by Fools  And are afraid to use their own EdgeTools  Since the  PlainDealer  's Scenes of Manly Rage  Not one has dar'd to lash this Crying Age  This time the Poet owns the bold Essay  Yet hopes there's no ill Manners in his Play  And he declares by me he has design'd  Affront to none but frankly speaks his Mind  And shou'd th' ensuing Scenes not chance to hit  He offers but this one Excuse 'Twas writ  Before your late Encouragement of Wit  EPILOGUE  Spoken at the Opening of the New House By Mrs  Bracegirdle  SURE Providence at first design'd this Place  To be the Player's Refuge in Distress  For still in every Storm they all run hither  As to a Shed that shields 'em from the Weather  But thinking of this Change which last befel us  It's like what I have heard our Poets tell us  For when behind our Scenes their Suits are pleading  To help their Love sometimes they show their Reading  And wanting ready Cash to pay for Hearts  They top their Learning on us and their Parts  Once of Philosophers they told us Stories  Whom as I think they call'd  PyPythagories  I'm sure 'tis some such  Latin  Name they give 'em  And we who know no better must believe 'em  Now to these Men say they such Souls were given  That after Death ne'er went to Hell nor Heaven  But liv'd I know not how in Beasts and then  When many Years were past in Men again  Methinks we  Players  resemble such a Soul  That does from Bodies we from Houses stroll  Thus  Aristotle  's Soul of old that was  May now be damn'd to animate an Ass  Or in this very House for ought we know  Is doing painful Pennance in some  Beau  And this our Audience which did once resort  To shining Theatres to see our Sport  Now find us toss'd into a TennisCourt  These Walls but t'other Day were fill'd with Noise  Of roaring Gamesters and your  Damme Boys  Then bounding Balls and Rackets they encompass'd  And now they're fill'd with Jests and Flights and Bombast  I vow I don't much like this Transmigration  Strolling from Place to Place by Circulation  Grant Heaven we don't return to our first Station  I know not what these think but for my Part  I can't reflect without an aking Heart  How we should end in our Original a Cart  But we can't fear since you're so good to save us  That you have only set us up to leave us  Thus from the past we hope for future Grace  I beg it  And some here know I have a begging Face  Then pray continue this your kind Behaviour  For a clear Stage won't do without your Favour  Personae Dramatis  MEN

ACT I SCENE I  Valentine  in his Chamber Reading  Jeremy  Waiting Several Books upon the Table  Val  JEremy  Jere  Sir  Val  Here take away I'll walk a Turn and digest what I have read  Jere  You'll grow Devilish Fat upon this PaperDiet  Aside and taking away the Books  Val  And d'ye here go you to BreakfastThere's a Page doubled down in  Epictetus  that is a Feast for an Emperor  Jere  Was  Epictetus  a real Cook or did he only write Receipts  Val  Read read Sirrah and refine your Appetite learn to live upon Instruction feast your Mind and mortifie your Flesh read and take your Nourishment in at your Eyes shut up your Mouth and chew the Gud of Understanding So  Epictetus  advises  Jere  O Lord I have heard much of him when I waited upon a Gentleman at  Cambridge  Pray what was that  Epictetus  Val  A very rich ManNot worth a Groat  Jere  Humph and so he has made a very fine Feast where there is nothing to be eaten  Val  Yes  Jere  Sir you're a Gentleman and probably understand this fine Feeding But if you please I had rather be at BoardWages Does your  Epictetus  or your  Seneca  here or any of these poor rich Rogues teach you how to pay your Debts without Mony Will they shut up the Mouths of your Creditors Will  Plato  be Bail for you Or  Diogenes  because he understands Confinements and liv'd in a Tub go to Prison for you 'Slife Sir what do you mean to mew your self up here with three or four musty Books in Commendation of Starving and Poverty  Val  Why Sirrah I have no Mony you know it and therefore resolve to rail at all that have And in that I but follow the Examples of the wisest and wittiest Men in all Ages these Poets and Philosophers whom you naturally hate for just such another Reason because they abound in Sense and you are a Fool  Jere  Ay Sir I am a Fool I know it And yet Heav'n help me I'm poor enough to be a WitBut I was always a Fool when I told you what your Expences would bring you to your Coaches and your Liveries your Treats and your Balls your being in Love with a Lady that did not care a Farthing for you in your Prosperity and keeping Company with Wits that car'd for nothing but your Prosperity and now when you are poor hate you as much as they do one another  Val  Well and now I am poor I have an opportunity to be reveng'd on 'em all I'll pursue  Angelica  with more Love than ever and appear more notoriously her Admirer in this Restraint than when I openly rival'd the rich Fops that made Court to her so shall my Poverty be a Mortification to her Pride and perhaps make her compassionate the Love which has principally reduc'd me to this Lowness of Fortune And for the Wits I'm sure I'm in a Condition to be even with them  Jere  Nay your Condition is pretty even with theirs that's the truth on't  Val  I'll take some of their Trade out of their Hands  Jere  Now Heav'n of Mercy continue the Tax upon Paper you don't mean to Write  Val  Yes I do I'll write a Play  Jere  HemSir if you please to give me a small Certificate of three Linesonly to certifie those whom it may concern That the Bearer hereof  Jeremy Fetch  by Name has for the space of seven Years truly and faithfuly serv'd  Valentine Legend  Esq  and that he is not now turn'd away for any Misdemeanour but does voluntarily dismiss his Master from any future Authority over him  Val  No Sirrah you shall live with me still  Jere  Sir it's impossibleI may die with you starve with you or be damn'd with your Works But to live even three Days the Life of a Play I no more expect it than to be Cannoniz'd for a Muse after my Decease  Val  You are witty you Rogue I shall want your helpI'll have you learn to make Couplets to tag the Ends of Acts d'ye hear get the Maids to Crambo in an Evening and learn the knack of rhiming you may arrive at the height of a Song sent by an unknown Hand or a ChocolateHouse Lampoon  Jere  But Sir is this the way to recover your Father's Favour Why Sir  Sampson  will be irreconcilable If your younger Brother shou'd come from Sea he'd never look upon you again You're undone Sir you're ruin'd you won't have a Friend left in the World if you turn PoetAh Pox confound that  Will  's CoffeeHouse it has ruin'd more Young Men than the  RoyalOak  LotteryNothing thrives that belongs to't The Man of the House would have been an Alderman by this time with half the Trade if he had set up in the CityFor my part I never sit at the Door that I don't get double the Stomach that I do at a HorseRace The Air upon  BansteadDowns  is nothing to it for a Whetter yet I never see it but the Spirit of Famine appears to me sometimes like a decay'd Porter worn out with Pimping and carrying  Billetdoux  and Songs not like other Porters for Hire but for the Jest's sake Now like a thin Chairman melted down to half his Proportion with carrying a Poet upon Tick to visit some great Fortune and his Fare to be paid him like the Wages of Sin either at the Day of Marriage or the Day of Death  Val  Very well Sir can you proceed  Jere  Sometimes like a bilk'd Bookseller with a meagre terrify'd Countenance that looks as if he had written for himself or were resolv'd to turn Author and bring the rest of his Brethren into the same Condition And lastly in the Form of a wornout Punk with Verses in her Hand which her Vanity had preferr'd to Settlements without a whole Tatter to her Tail but as ragged as one of the Muses or as if she were carrying her Linnen to the PaperMill to be converted into Folio Books of Warning to all young Maids not to prefer Poetry to good Sense or lying in the Arms of a needy Wit before the Embraces of a wealthy Fool  Enter  Scandal  Scan  What  Jeremy  holding forth  Val  The Rogue has with all the Wit he could muster up been declaiming against Wit  Scan  Ay Why then I'm afraid  Jeremy  has Wit For whereever it is it's always contriving its own Ruin  Jere  Why so I have been telling my Master Sir Mr  Scandal  for Heaven's sake Sir try if you can dissuade him from turning Poet  Scan  Poet He shall turn Soldier first and rather depend upon the outside of his Head than the Lining Why what the Devil has not your Poverty made you Enemies enough Must you needs shew your Wit to get more  Jere  Ay more indeed for who cares for any Body that has more Wit than himself  Scan  Jeremy speaks like an Oracle Don't you see how worthless great Men and dull rich Rogues avoid a witty Man of small Fortune Why he looks like a Writ of Enquiry into their Titles and Estates and seems Commission'd by Heav'n to seize the better half  Val  Therefore I would rail in my Writings and be reveng'd  Scan  Rail At whom the whole World Impotent and Vain Who would die a Martyr to Sense in a Country where the Religion is Folly You may stand at Bay for a while but when the full Cry is against you you won't have fair Play for your Life If you can't be fairly run down by the Hounds you will be treacherously shot by the HuntsmenNo turn Pimp Flatterer Quack Lawyer Parson be Chaplain to an Atheist or Stallion to an Old Woman any thing but Poet a Modern Poet is worse more servile timorous and fawning than any I have nam'd Without you could retrieve the Ancient Honours of the Name recal the Stage of  Athens  and be allow'd the force of open honest Satire  Val  You are as inveterate against our Poets as if your Character had been lately expos'd upon the StageNay I am not violently bent upon the Trade  One knocks  Jeremy  see who's there  Ex  Jeremy    But tell me what you would have me doWhat do the World say of me and my forc'd Confinement  Scan  The World behaves it self as it used to do on such Occasions some pity you and condemn your Father others excuse him and blame you only the Ladies are merciful and wish you well since Love and pleasurable Expence have been your greatest Faults  Enter  Jeremy  Val  How now  Jere  Nothing new Sir I have dispatch'd some half a Dozen Duns with as much Dexterity as a hungry Judge do's Causes at Dinnertime  Val  What Answer have you given 'em  Scan  Patience I suppose the old Receipt  Jere  No Faith Sir I have put 'em off so long with Patience and Forbearance and other fair Words that I was forc'd now to tell 'em in plain downright  English    Val  What  Jere  That they should be paid  Val  When  Jere  To Morrow  Val  And how the Devil do you mean to keep your Word  Jere  Keep it Not at all it has been so very much stretch'd that I reckon it will break of course by to Morrow and no Body be surpriz'd  at the Matter  Knocking  Again Sir if you don't like my Negotiation will you be pleas'd to answer these your self  Val  See who they are  Exit  Jere  By this  Scandal  you may see what it is to be great Secretaries of State Presidents of the Council and Generals of an Army lead just such a Life as I do have just such Crowds of Visitants in a Morning all solliciting of past Promises which are but a civiller sort of Duns that lay claim to voluntary Debts  Scan  And you like a true great Man having engaged their Attendance and promis'd more than ever you intend to perform are more perplex'd to find Evasions than you would be to invent the honest Means of keeping your Word and gratifying your Creditors  Val  Scandal  learn to spare your Friends and do not provoke your Enemies this Liberty of your Tongue will one Day bring a Confinement on your Body my Friend  Reenter  Jeremy  Jere  O Sir there's  Trapland  the Scrivener with two suspicious Fellows like lawful Pads that would knock a Man down with PocketTipstavesAnd there's your Father's Steward and the Nurse with one of your Children from  Twitnam  Val  Pox on her cou'd she find no other time to fling my Sins in my Face Here give her this  Gives Mony  and bid her trouble me no more a thoughtless twohanded Whore she knows my Condition well enough and might have overlaid the Child a Fortnight ago if she had had any Forecast in her  Scan  What is it bouncing  Margery  and my Godson  Jere  Yes Sir  Scan

shall take the Air shortly  Val  Scandal  don't spoil my Boy's MilkBid  Trapland  come in If I can give that  Cerberus  a Sop I shall be at rest for one day  Exit  Jeremy  Enter  Trapland  and  Jeremy

his Wine Sirrah refund the Sack  Jeremy  fetch him some warm Water or I'll rip up his Stomach and go the shortest way to his Conscience  Trap  Mr  Scandal  you are uncivil I did not value your Sack but you cannot expect it again when I have drank it  Scan  And how do you expect to have your Mony again when a Gentleman has spent it  Val  You need say no more I understand the Conditions they are very hard but my Necessity is very pressing I agree to 'em take Mr  Trapland  with you and let him draw the WritingMr  Trapland  you know this Man he shall satisfie you  Trap  Sincerely I am loth to

of mine that was sent to Sea three Years ago This Brother my Father hears is landed whereupon he very affectionately sends me word If I will make a Deed of Conveyance of my Right to his Estate after his Death to my younger Brother he will immediately furnish me with four thousand  Pound to pay my Debts and make my Fortune This was once propos'd before and I refus'd it but the present Impatience of my Creditors for their Mony and my own Impatience of Confinement and Absence from  Angelica  force me to consent  Scan  A very desperate Demonstration of your Love to  Angelica  And I think she has never given you any Assurance of hers  Val  You know her Temper she never gave me any great reason either for Hope or Despair  Scan  Women of her airy Temper as they seldom think before they act so they rarely give us any Light to guess at what they mean But you have little reason to believe that a Woman of this Age who has had an Indifference for you in your Prosperity will fall in love with your ill Fortune besides  Angelica  has a great Fortune of her own and great Fortunes either expect another great Fortune or a Fool  Enter  Jeremy  Jere  More Misfortunes Sir  Val  What another Dun  Jere  No Sir but Mr  Tattle  is come to wait upon you  Val  Well I can't help ityou must bring him up He knows I don't go abroad  Exit  Jeremy  Scan  Pox on him I'll be gone  Val  No prithee stay  Tattle  and you should never be asunder you are Light and Shadow and shew one another he is perfectly thy Reverse both in Humour and Understanding and as you set up for Defamation he is a Mender of Reputations  Scan  A Mender of Reputations ay just as he is a Keeper of Secrets another Virtue that he sets up for in the same manner For the Rogue will speak aloud in the posture of a Whisper and deny a Woman's Name while he gives you the Marks of her Person He will forswear receiving a Letter from her and at the same time shew you her Hand upon the Superscription And yet perhaps he has counterfeited the Hand too and sworn to a Truth but he hopes not to be believ'd and refuses the Reputation of a Ladies Favour as a Doctor says No to a Bishoprick only that it may be granted himIn short he is a publick Professor of Secresie and makes Proclamation that he holds private IntelligenceHe's here  Enter  Tattle  Tatt  Valentine  good Morrow  Scandal  I am yoursthat is when you speak well of me  Scan  That is when I am yours for while I am my own or any body's else that will never happen  Tatt  How Inhuman  Val  Why  Tattle  you need not be much concern'd at any thing that he says For to converse with  Scandal  is to play at  Losing Loadum  you must lose a good Name to him before you can win it for your self  Tatt  But how barbarous that is and how unfortunate for him that the World shall think the better of any Person for his CalumniationI thank Heav'n it has always been a part of my Character to handle the Reputation of others very tenderly  Scan  Ay such rotten Reputations as you have to deal with are to be handl'd tenderly indeed  Tatt  Nay but why rotten Why should you say rotten when you know not the Persons of whom you speak How cruel that is  Scan  Not know 'em Why thou never hadst to do with any Body that did not stink to all the Town  Tatt  Ha ha ha nay now you make a Jest of it indeed For there is nothing more known than that no Body knows any thing of that nature of me As I hope to be sav'd  Valentine  I never expos'd a Woman since I knew what Woman was  Val  And yet you have convers'd with several  Tatt  To be free with you I haveI don't care if I own thatNay more I'm going to say a bold Word now I never could meddle with a Woman that had to do with any Body else  Scan  How  Val  Nay Faith I'm apt to believe himExcept her Husband  Tattle  Tatt  Oh that  Scan  What think you of that Noble Commoner Mrs  Drab  Tatt  Pooh I know Madam  Drab  has made her Brags in three or four places that I said this and that and writ to her and did I know not whatBut upon my Reputation she did me wrongWell well that was MaliceBut I know the bottom of it She was brib'd to that by one that we all knowA Man too Only to bring me into Disgrace with a certain Woman of Quality  Scan  Whom we all know  Tatt  No matter for thatYes yes every Body knowsNo doubt on't every Body knows my SecretsBut I soon satisfy'd the Lady of my Innocence for I told herMadam says I there are some Persons who make it their Business to tell Stories and say this and that of one and t'other and every thing in the World and says I if your Grace  Scan  Grace  Tatt  O Lord what have I said my unlucky Tongue  Val  Ha ha ha  Scan  Why  Tattle  thou hast more Impudence than one can in reason expect I shall have an Esteem for thee well and ha ha ha well go on and what did you say to her Grace  Val  I confess this is something extraordinary  Tatt  Not a Word as I hope to be sav'd an errant  Lapsus Linguae  Come let's talk of something else  Val  Well but how did you acquit your self  Tatt  Pooh pooh nothing at all I only rally'd with youa Woman of ord'nary Rank was a little jealous of me and I told her something or other FaithI know not whatCome let's talk of something else  Hums a Song  Scan  Hang him let him alone he has a Mind we should enquire  Tatt  Valentine  I Supp'd last Night with your Mistress and her Uncle Old  Foresight  I think your Father lyes at  Foresight  's  Val  Yes  Tatt  Upon my Soul  Angelica  's a fine WomanAnd so is Mrs  Foresight  and her Sister Mrs  Frail  Scan  Yes Mrs  Frail  is a very fine Woman we all know her  Tatt  Oh that is not fair  Scan  What  Tatt  To tell  Scan  To tell what Why what do you know of Mrs  Frail  Tatt  Who I Upon Honour I don't know whether she be Man or Woman but by the smoothness of

may dream of her  Mrs Fore  Mr  Scandal  you had best go to Bed and dream too  Scan  Why Faith I have a good lively Imagination and can dream as much to the purpose as another if I set about it But  Dreaming is the poor Retreat of a lazy hopeless and imperfect Lover 'tis the last glimpse of Love to wornout Sinners and the faint Dawning of a Bliss to wishing Girls and growing Boys  There's nought

to Day  Scan  Would he have  Angelica  acquainted with the Reason of his Design  Jere  No Sir not yetHe has a mind to try whether his playing the Madman won't make her play the Fool and fall in Love with him or at least own that she has lov'd him all this while and conceal'd it  Scan  I saw her take Coach just now with her Maid and think I heard her bid the Coachman drive hither  Jere  Like enough Sir for I told her Maid this Morning my Master was run stark mad only for Love of her Mistress I hear a Coach stop if it should be she Sir I believe he would not see her 'till he hears how she takes it  Scan  Well I'll try her'tis she here she comes  Enter  Angelica  with  Jenny  Ang  Mr  Scandal  I suppose you don't think it a Novelty to see a Woman visit a Man at his own Lodgings in a Morning  Scan  Not upon a kind Occasion Madam But when a Lady comes tyrannically to insult a ruin'd Lover and make manifest the cruel Triumphs of her Beauty the Barbarity of it something surprizes me  Ang  I don't like Raillery from a serious Facepray tell me what is the matter  Jere  No strange matter Madam my Master's mad that's all I suppose your Ladyship has thought him so a great while  Ang  How d'ye mean mad  Jere  Why faith Madam he's mad for want of his Wits just as he was poor for want of Mony his Head is e'en as light as his Pockets and any body that has a mind to a bad Bargain can't do better than to beg him for his Estate  Ang  If you speak Truth your endeavouring at Wit is very unscasonable  Scan  She's concern'd and loves him  Aside  Ang  Mr  Scandal  you can't think me guilty of so much Inhumanity as not to be concern'd for a Man I must own my self oblig'd topray tell me Truth  Scan  Faith Madam I wish telling a Lie would mend the matter But this is no new Effect of an unsuccessful Passion  Ang  aside  I know not what to thinkYet I should be vext to have a Trick put upon meMay I not see him  Scan  I'm afraid the Physician is not willing you should see him yet

the Recovery of  Valentine  Therefore I conjure you as you are his Friend and as you have Compassion upon one fearful of Affliction  o tell me what I am to hope forI cannot speakBut you may tell me tell me for you know what I would ask  Scan  So this is pretty plainBe not too much concerned Madam I hope his Condition is not desperate An Acknowledgment of Love from you perhaps may work a Cure as the Fear of your Aversion occasion'd his Distemper  Ang  aside  Say you so nay then I'm convinc'd And if I don't play Trick for Trick may I never taste the pleasure of RevengeAcknowledgment of Love I find you have mistaken my Compassion and think me guilty of a Weakness I am a Stranger to But I have too much Sincerity to deceive you and too much Charity to suffer him to be deluded with vain Hopes Good Nature and Humanity oblige me to be concern'd for him but to Love is neither in my Power nor Inclination And if he can't be cur'd without I suck the Poison from his Wounds I'm afraid he won't recover his Senses 'till I lose mine  Scan  Hey brave Woman I'faithWon't you see him then if he desire it  Ang  What signifie a Madman's Desires Besides 'twould make me uneasieIf I don't see him perhaps my Concern for him may lessenIf I forget him 'tis no more than he has done by himself and now the Surprize is over methinks I am not half so sorry as I was  Scan  So Faith good Nature works apace you were confessing just now an Obligation to his Love  Ang  But I have consider'd that Passions are unreasonable and involuntary if he loves he can't help it and if I don't love I can't help it no more than he can help his being a Man or I my being a Woman or no more than I can help my want of Inclination to stay longer hereCome  Jenny  Exit  Ang  and  Jenny  Scan  HumhAn admirable

Oaths renew  But to be plain I never would be true    For by our weak and weary Truth I find  Love hates to center in a Point assign'd  But runs with Joy the Circle of the Mind  Then never let us

our selves and since you have lov'd me you must own I have at length deserv'd you should confess it  Ang  Sighs  I would I had lov'd youfor Heaven knows I pity you and could I have foreseen the bad Effects I would have striven but that's too late  Sighs  Val  What sad EffectsWhat's too late My seeming Madness as deceiv'd my Father and procur'd me Time to think of Means to reconcile me to him and preserve the Right of my Inheritance to his Estate which otherwise by Articles I must this morning have resign'd And this I had inform'd you of to Day but you were gone before I knew you had been here  Ang  How I thought your Love of me had caus'd this Transport in your Soul which it seems you only counterfeited for by mercenary Ends and sordid Interest  Val  Nay now you do me wrong for if any Interest was considered it was yours since I thought I wanted more than Love to make me worthy of you  Ang  Then you thought me mercenaryBut how am I deluded by this Interval of Sense to reason with a Madman  Val  Oh 'tis barbarous to misunderstand me longer  Enter  Jeremy  Ang  Oh here's a reasonable Creaturesure he will not have the Impudence to persevereCome  Jeremy  acknowledge your Trick and

I have not found him very quiet at this present Who's there  One knocks  Val  Go see you Sot I'm very glad that I can move your Mirth tho' not your Compassion  Exit  Jeremy  Ang  I did not think you had Apprehension enough to be exceptious But Madmen shew themselves most by overpretending to a sound Understanding as Drunken Men do by overacting Sobriety I was half inclining to believe you 'till I accidentally touch'd upon your tender Part But now you have restor'd me to my former Opinion and Compassion  Enter  Jeremy  Jere  Sir your Father has sent to know if you are any better yetWill you please to be mad Sir or how  Val  Stupidity You know the Penalty of all I'm worth must pay for the Confession of my Senses I'm mad and will be mad to every Body but this Lady  Jere  SoJust the very

hither  Jenny  Yes Madam Sir  Sampson  will wait upon you presently  Aside to  Angelica  Val  You are not leaving me in this Uncertainty  Ang  Would any thing but a Madman complain of Uncertainty  Uncertainty and Expectation are the Joys of Life Security is an insipid thing and the overtaking and possessing of a Wish discovers the Folly of the Chase Never let us know one another better for the Pleasure of a Masquerade is done when we come to shew Faces But I'll tell you two things before I leave you I am not the Fool you take me for and you are mad and don't know it  Exit  Ang  and  Jenny  Val  From a Riddle you can expect nothing but a Riddle There's my Instruction and the Moral of my Lesson  Reenter  Jeremy  Jere  What is the Lady gone again Sir I hope you understood one another before she went  Val  Understood she is harder to be understood than a Piece of  Aegyptian  Antiquity or an  Irish  Manuscript you may pore 'till you spoil your Eyes and not improve your Knowledge  Jere  I have heard 'em say Sir they read hard  Hebrew  Books backwards may be you begin to read at the wrong End  Val  They say so of a Witches Prayer and Dreams and  Dutch  Almanacks are to be understood by contraries But there's Regularity and Method in that she is a Medal without a Reverse or Inscription for Indifference has both Sides alike Yet while she does not seem to hate me I will pursue her and know her if it be possible in spight of the Opinion of my Satyrical Friend  Scandal  who says  That Women are like Tricks by Slight of Hand  Which to admire we should not understand  Exeunt  The End of the Fourth Act  ACT V SCENE I  A Room in  Foresight  's House  Enter  Angelica  and  Jenny  Ang  WHERE is Sir  Sampson  Did you not tell me he would be here before me  Jenny  He's

fair Lady a great whileOdd Madam you have reviv'd meNot since I was Five and Thirty  Ang  Why you have no great reason to complain Sir  Sampson  that is not long ago  Sir Samp  Zooks but it is Madam a very great while to a Man that admires a Fine Woman as much as I do  Ang  You're an absolute Courtier Sir  Sampson  Sir Samp  Not at all Madam Odsbud you wrong me I am not so old neither to be a bare Courtier only a Man of Words Odd I have warm Blood about me yet and can serve a Lady any wayCome come let me tell you you Women think a Man old too soon Faith and Troth you doCome don't despise Fifty odd Fifty in a hale Constitution is no such contemptible Age  Ang  Fifty a contemptible Age Not at all a very fashionable Age I thinkI assure you I know very considerable Beaus that set a good Face upon Fifty Fifty I have seen Fifty in a SideBox by Candlelight outblossom Five and Twenty  Sir Samp  O Pox Outsides Outsides a pize take 'em meer Outsides Hang your SideBox Beaus no I'm none of those none of your forc'd Trees that pretend to Blossom in the Fall and Bud when they should bring forth Fruit I am of a long liv'd Race and inherit Vigour none of my Family married 'till Fifty yet they begot Sons and Daughters 'till Fourscorce I am of your Patriarchs I a Branch of one of your  Antideluvian  Families Fellows that the Flood could not wash away Well Madam what are your Commands Has any young Rogue affronted you and shall I cut his Throat or  Ang  No Sir  Sampson  I have no Quarrel upon my HandsI have more occasion for your Conduct than your Courage at this time To tell you the Truth I'm weary of living single and want a Husband  Sir Samp  Odsbud and 'tis pity you shouldOdd wou'd she wou'd like me then I should hamper my young Rogues Odd  wou'd she wou'd Faith and Troth she's devilish Handsom  Aside  Madam you deserve a good Husband and 'twere a pity you should be thrown away upon any of these young idle Rogues about the Town Odd there's ne'er a young Fellow worth hangingthat is a very young FellowPize on 'em they never think beforehand of any thingAnd if they commit Matrimony 'tis as they commit Murder out of a Frolick And are ready to hang themselves or to be hang'd by the Law the next MorningOdso have a care Madam  Ang  Therefore I ask your Advice Sir  Sampson  I have Fortune enough to make any Man easie that I can like if there were such a thing as a young agreeable Man with a reasonable Stock of good Nature and SenseFor I would neither have an absolute Wit nor a Fool  Sir Samp  Odd you are hard to please Madam to find a young Fellow that is neither a Wit in his own Eye nor a Fool in the Eye of the World is a very hard Task But Faith and Troth you speak very discreetly for I hate both a Wit and a Fool  Ang  She that marries a Fool Sir  Sampson  commits the Reputation of her Honesty or Understanding to the Censure of the World And she that marries a very witty Man submits both to the Severity and insolent Conduct of her Husband I should like a Man of Wit for a Lover because I would have such an one in my Power but I would no more be his Wife than his Enemy For his Malice is not a more terrible Consequence of his Aversion than his Jealousie is of his Love  Sir Samp  None of old  Foresight  's  Sybills  ever utter'd such a Truth Odsbud you have won my Heart I hate a Wit I had a Son that was spoil'd among 'em a good hopeful Lad 'till he learn'd to be a WitAnd might have risen in the StateBut a Pox on't his Wit run him out of his Mony and now his Poverty has run him out of his Wits  Ang  Sir  Sampson  as your Friend I must tell you you are very much abus'd in that matter he's no more mad than you are  Sir Samp  How Madam Would I could prove it  Ang  I can tell you how that may be doneBut it is a thing that would make me appear to be too much concern'd in your Affairs  Sir Samp  Odsbud I believe she likes me  Aside  Ah Madam all my Affairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your Feet and I wish Madam they stood in a better Posture that I might make a more becoming Offer to a Lady of your incomparable  Beauty and MeritIf I had  Peru  in one Hand and  Mexico  in t'other and the  Eastern  Empire under my Feet it would make me only a more glorious Victim to be offer'd at the Shrine of your Beauty  Ang  Bless me Sir  Sampson  what's the matter  Sir Samp  Odd Madam I love youAnd if you would take my Advice in a Husband  Ang  Hold hold Sir  Sampson  I ask'd your Advice for a Husband and you are giving me your ConsentI was indeed thinking to propose something like it in Jest to satisfie you about  Valentine  For if a Match were seemingly carried on between you and me it would oblige him to throw off his Disguise of Madness in apprehension of losing me For you know he has long pretended a Passion for me  Sir Samp  Gadzooks a most ingenious ContrivanceIf we were to go throw with it But why must the Match only be seemingly carried onOdd let it be a real Contract  Ang  O fie Sir  Sampson  what would the World say  Sir Samp  Say they would say you were a wise Woman and I a happy Man Odd Madam I'll love you as long as I live and leave you a good Jointure when I die  Ang  Ay but that is not in your Power Sir  Sampson  for when  Valentine  confesses himself in his Senses he must make over his Inheritance to his younger Brother  Sir Samp  Odd you're cunning a wary Baggage Faith and Troth I like you the betterBut I warrant you I have a Proviso in the Obligation in Favour of my selfBody o'me I have a Trick to turn the Settlement upon the Issue Male of our two Bodies begotten Odsbud let us find Children and I'll find an Estate  Ang  Will you well do you find the Estate and leave the t'other to me  Sir Samp  O Rogue But I'll trust you And will you consent Is it a Match then  Ang  Let me consult my Lawyer concerning this Obligation and if I find what you propose practicable I'll give you my Answer  Sir Samp  With all my HeartCome in with me and I'll lend you the BondYou shall consult your Lawyer and I'll consult a Parson Odzooks I'm a young Man Odzooks I'm a young Man and I'll make it appearOdd you're devilish Handsom Faith and Troth you're very Handsom and I'm very  Young and very LustyOdsbud Hussy you know how to chuse and so do IOdd I think we are very well metGive me your Hand Odd let me kiss it 'tis as warm and as softas whatOdd as t'other Handgive me t'other Hand and I'll mumble 'em and kiss 'em 'till they melt in my Mouth  Ang  Hold Sir  Sampson  You're profuse of your Vigor before your time You'll spend your Estate before you come to it  Sir Samp  No no only give you a Rentroll of my PossessionsAh BaggageI warrant you for little  Sampson  Odd  Sampson  's a very good Name for an able Fellow Your  Sampsons  were strong Dogs from the Beginning  Ang  Have a care and don't overact your PartIf you remember the strongest  Sampson  of your Name pull'd an old House over his Head at last  Sir Samp  Say you so HussyCome let's go then Odd I long to be pulling

You were abus'd Sir I never was distracted  Fore  How Not Mad Mr  Scandal  Scan  No really Sir I'm his Witness it was all Counterfeit  Val  I thought I had ReasonsBut it was a poor Contrivance the Effect has shewn it such  Sir Samp  Contrivance what to cheat me to cheat your Father Sirrah could you hope to prosper  Val  Indeed I thought Sir when the Father endeavour'd to undo the Son it was a reasonable return of Nature  Sir Samp  Very good SirMr  Buckram  are you readyCome Sir will you Sign and Seal  Val  If you please Sir but first I would ask this Lady one Question  Sir Samp  Sir you must ask me leave first that Lady no Sir you shall ask that Lady no Questions 'till you have ask'd her Blessing Sir that Lady is to be my Wife  Val  I have heard as much Sir but I would have it from her own Mouth  Sir Samp  That's as much as to say I lie Sir and you don't believe what I say  Val  Pardon me Sir But I reflect that I very lately counterfeited Madness I don't know but the Frolick may go round  Sir Samp  Come Chuck satisfie him answer himCome come Mr  Buckram  the Pen and Ink  Buck  Here it is Sir with the Deed all is ready    Val  goes to  Ang  Ang  'Tis true you have a great

Sir  Val  Yes Sir  Sir Samp  Where's your Plot Sir And your Contrivance now Sir Will you Sign Sir Come will you Sign and Seal  Val  With all my Heart Sir  Scan  'Sdeath you are not Mad indeed to ruin your self  Val  I have been disappointed of my only Hope and he that loses Hope may part with any thing I never valu'd Fortune but as it was subservient to my Pleasure and my only Pleasure was to please this Lady I have made many vain Attemps and find at last that nothing but my Ruin can effect it Which for that Reason I will Sign toGive me the Paper  Ang  Generous  Valentine  Buck  Here is the Deed Sir  Val  But where is the Bond by which I am oblig'd to Sign this  Buck  Sir  Sampson  you have it  Ang  No I have it and I'll use it as I would every thing that is an Enemy to  Valentine

very hard to make this utmost Trial of your Virtue  To  Val  Val  Between Pleasure and Amazement I am lostBut on my Knees I take the Blessing  Sir Samp  Oons what is the meaning of this  Ben  Mess here's the Wind chang'd again Father you and I may make a Voyage together now  Ang  Well Sir  Sampson  since I have plaid you a Trick I'll advise you how you may avoid such another Learn to be a good Father or you'll never get a second Wife I always lov'd your Son and hated your unforgiving Nature I was resolv'd to try him to the utmost I have try'd you too and know you both You have not more Faults than he has Virtues and 'tis hardly more Pleasure to me that I can make him and my self happy than that I can punish you  Val  If my Happiness could receive Addition this kind Surprize would make it double  Sir Samp  Oons you're a  Crocodile  Fore  Really Sir  Sampson  this is a sudden Eclipse  Sir Samp  You're an illiterate Fool and I'm another and the Stars are Liars and if I had Breath enough I'd curse them and you my self and every BodyOons Cully'd Bubbl'd Jilted Womanbobb'd at last I have not Patience  Exit Sir  Samp  Tatt  If the Gentleman is in this Disorder for want of a Wife I can spare him mine Oh are you there Sir I'm indebted to you for my Happiness  To  Jere  Jere  Sir I ask you Ten Thousand Pardons 'twas an errant MistakeYou see Sir my Master was never mad nor any thing like itThen how could it be otherwise  Val  Tattle  I thank you you would have interposed between me and Heav'n but Providence laid Purgatory in your wayYou have but Justice  Scan  I hear the Fiddles that Sir  Sampson  provided for his own Wedding methinks 'tis pity they should not be employ'd when the Match is so much mended  Valentine  tho' it be Morning we may have a Dance  Val  Any thing my Friend every thing that looks like Joy and Transport  Scan  Call 'em  Jeremy  Ang  I have done dissembling now  Valentine  and if that Coldness which I have always worn before you should turn to an extream Fondness you must not suspect it  Val  I'll prevent that SuspicionFor I intend to doat on at that immoderate rate that your Fondness shall never distinguish it self enough to be taken notice of If ever you seem to love too much it must be only when I can't love enough  Ang  Have a care of Promises You know you are apt to run more in Debt than you are able to pay  Val  Therefore I yield my Body as your Prisoner and make your best on't  Scan  The Musick stays for you  Dance  Scan  Well Madam you have done Exemplary Justice in punishing an inhuman Father and rewarding a faithful Lover But there is a third good Work which I in particular must thank you for I was an Infidel to your Sex and you have converted meFor now I am convinc'd that all Women are not like Fortune blind in bestowing Favours either to those who do not merit or who do not want 'em  Ang  'Tis an unreasonable Accusation that you lay upon our Sex You tax us with Injustice only to cover your own want of Merit You would all have the Reward of Love but few have the C  stancy to stay 'till it becomes your due Men are generally Hypocrites and Infidels they pretend to Worship but have neither Zeal nor Faith How few like  Valentine  would perserve even unto Martyrdom and sacrifice their Interest to their Constancy In admi  ing me you misplace the Novelty  The Miracle to Day is that we find  A Lover true Not that a Woman's kind  Exeunt Omnes  FINIS
