 A COLLECTION of POEMS  VOL III  A COLLECTION OF POEMS IN FOUR VOLUMES  BY SEVERAL HANDS  LONDON Printed for G PEARCH No CHEAPSIDE MDCCLXX  Isaac Taylor del et sculp  MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS AN ELEGY  Quod tibi vitae sors detraxit  Fama adjiciet posthuma laudi  Nostris longum tu dolor et honor  BUCH  THE balmy Zephyrs o'er the woodland stray  And gently stir the bosom of the lake  The fawns that panting in the covert lay  Now thro' the bloomy park their revels take  Pale rise the rugged hills that skirt the North  The wood glows yellow by the evening rays  Silent and beauteous flows the silver Forth  And Aman murmuring thro' the willows strays  But ah what means this silence in the grove  Where oft the wildnotes sooth'd the lovesick boy  Why cease in Mary's bower the songs of Love  The songs of Love of Innocence and Joy  When bright the lake reflects the setting ray  The sportive virgins tread the flowery green  And by the moon full oft in chearful May  The merry bridemaids at the dance are seen  But who these Nymphs that thro' the copse appear  In robes of white adorn'd with violet blue  Fondly with purple flowers they deck yon bier  And wave in solemn pomp the boughs of yew  Supreme in grief her eye confus'd with woe  Appears the Lady of th' aërial train  Tall as the sylvan Goddess of the bow  And fair as she who wept Adonis slain  Such was the pomp when Gilead's virgin band  Wandering by Judah's flowery mountains wept  And with fair Iphis by the hallowed strand  Of Siloe's brook a mournful sabbath kept  By the resplendent cross with thistles twin'd  'Tis Mary's Guardian Genius lost in woe  " Ah say what deepest wrongs have thus combin'd  " To heave with restless sighs thy breast of snow  " Oh stay ye Dryads nor unfinish'd fly  " Your solemn rites here comes no foot profane  " The Muses' son and hallowed is his eye  " Implores your stay implores to join the strain  " See from her cheek the glowing lifeblush flies  " Alas what faultering sounds of woe be these  " Ye Nymphs who fondly watch her languid eyes  " Oh say what music will her soul appease"  " Resound the solemn dirge the Nymphs reply  " And let the turtles moan in Mary's bower  " Let Grief indulge her grand sublimity  " And Melancholy wake her melting power  " For Art has triumph'd Art that never stood  " On Honour's side or generous transport knew  " Has dy'd its haggard hands in Mary's blood  " And o'er her fame has breath'd its blighting dew  " But come ye Nymphs ye woodland Spirits come  " And with funereal flowers your tresses braid  " While in this hallowed grove we raise the tomb  " And consecrate the song to Mary's shade  " O sing what smiles her youthful morning wore  " Her's every charm and every liveliest grace  " When Nature's happiest touch could add no more  " Heaven lent an angel's beauty to her face  " O whether by the moss grown bushy dell  " Where from the oak depends the misletoe  " Where creeping ivy shades the Druid's cell  " Where from the rock the gurgling waters flow  " Or whether sportive o'er the cowslip beds  " You thro' the haunted dales of Mona glide  " Or brush the upland lea when Cynthia sheds  " Her silvery light on Snowdon's hoary side  " Hither ye gentle Guardians of the Fair  " By Virtue's tears by weeping Beauty come  " Unbind the festive robes unbind the hair  " And wave the cypress bough at Mary's tomb  " And come ye fleet Magicians of the air  " The mournful Lady of the chorus cry'd  " Your airy tints of baleful hue prepare  " And thro' this grove bid Mary's fortunes glide  " And let the song with solemn harping join'd  " And wailing notes unfold the tale of woe"  She spoke and waking thro' the breathing wind  From lyres unseen the solemn harpings flow  The song began "How bright her early morn  " What lasting joys her smiling fate portends  " To wield the awful British scepters born  " And Gaul's young heir her bridalbed ascends  " See round her bed lightfloating on the air  " The little Loves their purple wings display  " When sudden shrieking at the dismal glare  " Of funeral torches far they speed away  " Far with the Loves each blissful omen speeds  " Her eighteenth April hears her widow'd moan  " The bridal bed the sable hearse succeeds  " And struggling Factions shake her native throne  " No more a Goddess in the swimming dance  " Mayst thou O Queen thy lovely form display  " No more thy beauty reign the charm of France  " Nor in Versailles' proud bowers outshine the day  " A nation stern and stubborn to command  " And now convuls'd with Faction's fiercest rage  " Commits its scepter to thy gentle hand  " And asks a bridle from thy tender age  " Domestic bliss that dear that sovereign joy  " Far from her hearth was seen to speed away  " Strait darkbrow'd Factions entering in destroy  " The seeds of peace and mark her for their prey  " No more by moonshine to the nuptial bower  " Her Francis comes by Love's soft fetters led  " Far other spouse now wakes her midnight hour  " Enrag'd and reeking from the harlot's bed  " Ah draw the veil" shrill trembles thro' the air  The veil was drawn but darker scenes arose  Another nuptial couch the Fates prepare  The baleful teeming source of deeper woes  The bridal torch her Evil Angel wav'd  Far from the couch offended Prudence fled  Of deepest crimes deceitful Faction rav'd  And rous'd her trembling from the fatal bed  The hinds are seen in arms and glittering spears  Instead of crooks the Grampian shepherds wield  Fanatic rage the plowman's visage wears  And red with slaughter lies the harvestfield  From Borthwick field deserted and forlorn  The beauteous Queen all tears is seen to fly  Now thro' the streets a weeping captive borne  Her woes the triumph of the vulgar eye  Again the vision shifts the fatal scene  Again forlorn from rebel arms she flies  And unsuspecting on a sister Queen  The lovely injur'd fugitive relies  When Wisdom baffled owns th' attempt in vain  Heaven oft delights to set the virtuous free  Some friend appears and breaks Affliction's chain  But ah no generous friend appears for thee  A prison's ghastly walls and grated cells  Deform'd the airy scenery as it past  The haunt where listless Melancholy dwells  Where every genial feeling shrinks aghast  No female eye her sickly bed to tend  A fact    " Ah cease to tell it in the female ear  A woman's stern command a proffer'd friend  " Oh generous passion peace forbear forbear  " And could oh Tudor could thy breast retain  " No softening thought of what thy woes had been  " When thou the heir of England's crown in vain  " Didst sue the mercy of a tyrant Queen  " And could no pang from tender memory wake  " And feel those woes that once had been thine own  " No pleading tear to drop for Mary's sake  " For Mary's sake the heir of England's throne  " Alas no pleading pang thy memory knew  " Dry'd were the tears which for thyself had flow'd  " Dark politics alone engag'd thy view  " With female jealousy thy bosom glow'd  " And say did Wisdom own thy stern command  " Did Honour wave his banner o'er the deed  " NoMary's fate thy name shall ever brand  " And ever o'er her woes shall Pity bleed  " The babe that prattled on his nurse's knee  " When first thy woeful captive hours began  " Ere heaven oh hapless Mary set thee free  " That babe to battle march'd in arms a man"  An awful pause ensuesWith speaking eyes  And hands half rais'd the guardian Wood Nymphs wait  While slow and sad the airy scenes arise  Stain'd with the last deep woes of Mary's fate  With dreary black hung round the hall appears  The thirsty sawdust strews the marble floor  Blue gleams the ax the block its shoulders rears  And pikes and halberts guard the iron door  The clouded moon her dreary glimpses shed  And Mary's maids a mournful train pass by  Languid they walk and listless hang the head  And silent tears pace down from every eye  Serene and nobly mild appears the Queen  She smiles on heaven and bows the injur'd head  The ax is liftedfrom the deathful scene  The Guardians turn'd and all the picture fled  It fled the Wood Nymphs o'er the distant lawn  As rapt in vision dart their earnest eyes  So when the huntsman hears the rustling sawn  He stands impatient of the starting prize  The sovereign Dame her awful eyeballs roll'd  As Cuma's maid when by the God inspir'd  " The depths of ages to my sight unfold"  She cries "and Mary's meed my breast has fir'd  " On Tudor's throne her Sons shall ever reign  " Age after age shall see their flag unfurl'd  " With sovereign pride whereever roars the main  " Stream to the wind and awe the trembling world  " Nor in their Britain shall they reign alone  " Age after age through lengthening time shall see  " Her branching race on Europe's every throne  " And Goths and Vandals bend to them the knee  " But Tudor as a fruitless gourd shall die  " I see her deathsceneOn the lowly flore  " Dreary she sits cold Grief has glass'd her eye  " And Anguish gnaws her till she breathes no more  But harkloud howling thro' the midnight gloom  Faction is rous'd and sends her baleful yell  Oh save ye generous few your Mary's tomb  Oh save her ashes from the blasting spell  " And see where Time with brighten'd face serene  " Points to yon far but gloricus opening sky  " See Truth walk forth majestic awful Queen  " And Party's blackening mists before her fly  " Falshood unmask'd withdraws her ugly train  " And Mary's virtues all illustrious shine  " Yes thou hast friends the godlike and humane  " Of latest ages injur'd Queen are thine"  The milky splendors of the dawning ray  Now thro' the grove a trembling radiance shed  With sprightly note the woodlark hail'd the day  And with the moonshine all the vision fled  The Author of this little Poem to the memory of an unhappy Princess is unwilling to enter into the controversy respecting her guilt or her innocence Suffice it only to observe that the following facts may be proved to demonstration The Letters which have been always esteemed as the principal proof of Queen Mary's guilt are forged Buchanan on whose authority Thuanus and other historians have condemned her has falsified several circumstances of her history and has cited against her public records which never existed And to add no more The treatment she received from her illustrious Cousin was dictated by a policy truly Machiavelian which trampled on the obligations of Honour of Humanity and Morality From whence it may be inferred That to express the indignation at the cruel treatment of Mary which History must ever inspire and to drop a tear on her sufferings is not unworthy of a writer who would appear in the cause of Virtue    HENGIST AND MEY A BALLAD  BY THE AUTHOR OF THE CONCUBINE  Haec novimus esse nihil  IN antient days when Arthur reign'd  Sir Elmer had no peer  And no young knight in all the land  The ladies lov'd so dear  His sister Mey the fairest maid  Of all the virgin train  Won every heart at Arthur's court  But all their love was vain  In vain they lov'd in vain they vow'd  Her heart they could not move  Yet at the evening hour of prayer  Her mind was lost in love  The Abbess saw the Abbess knew  And urg'd her to explain  " O name the gentle youth to me  " And his consent I'll gain"  Long urg'd long vext fair Mey reply'd  " His name how can I say  " An angel from the fields above  " Has rapt my heart away  " But once alas and never more  " His lovely form I spied  " One evening by the sounding shore  " All by the greenwood side  " His eyes to mine the love confest  " That glow'd with mildest grace  " His courtly mien and purple vest  " Bespoke his princely race  " But when he heard my brother's horn  " Fast to his ships he fled  " Yet while I sleep his graceful form  " Still hovers round my bed  " Sometimes all clad in armour bright  " He shakes a warlike lance  " And now in courtly garments dight  " He leads the sprightly dance  " His hair is black as raven's wing  " His skin as Christmas snow  " His cheeks outvie the blush of morn  " His lips like rosebuds glow  " His limbs his arms his stature shap'd  " By Nature's finest hand  " His sparkling eyes declare him born  " To love and to command"  The livelong year fair Mey bemoan'd  Her hopeless pining love  But when the balmy Spring return'd  And Summer cloath'd the grove  All round by pleasant Humber side  The Saxon banners flew  And to Sir Elmer's castle gates  The spearmen came in view  Fair blush'd the morn when Mey look'd o'er  The castlewall so sheen  And lo the warlike Saxon youth  Were sporting on the green  There Hengist Offa's eldest son  Lean'd on his burnish'd lance  And all the armed youth around  Obey'd his manly glance  His locks as black as raven's wing  Adown his shoulders flow'd  His cheeks outvied the blush of morn  His lips like rosebuds glow'd  And soon the lovely form of Mey  Has caught his piercing eyes  He gives the sign his bands retire  While big with love he sighs  " Oh thou for whom I dar'd the seas  " And come with peace or war  " Oh by that cross that veils thy breast  " Relieve thy Lover's care  " For thee I'll quit my father's throne  " With thee the wilds explore  " Or with thee share the British crown  " With thee the Cross adore"  Beneath the timorous virgin blush  With love's soft warmth she glows  So blushing thro' the dews of morn  Appears the opening rose  'Twas now the hour of morning prayer  When men their sins bewail  That Elmer heard king Arthur's horn  Shrill sounding thro' the dale  The pearly tears from Mey's bright eyes  Like April dew drops fell  When with a parting dear embrace  Her brother bade farewell  The cross with sparkling diamonds bright  That veil'd her snowy breast  With prayers to heaven her lily hands  Have fixt on Elmer's vest  Now with fivehundred bowmen true  He's march'd across the plain  Till with his gallant yeomandrie  He join'd king Arthur's train  Full forty thousand Saxon spears  Came glittering down the hill  And with their shouts and clang of arms  The distant valleys fill  Old Offa drest in Odin's garb  Assum'd the hoary god  And Hengist like the warlike Thor  Before the horsemen rode  With dreadful rage the combat burns  The captains shout amain  And Elmer's tall victorious spear  Far glances o'er the plain  To stop its course young Hengist flew  Like lightning o'er the field  And soon his eyes the wellknown cross  On Elmer's vest beheld  The slighted lover swell'd his breast  His eyes shot living fire  And all his martial heat before  To this was mild desire  On his imagin'd rival's steed  With furious force he prest  And glancing to the sun his sword  Resounds on Elmer's crest  The foe gave way the princely youth  With heedless rage pursu'd  Till trembling in his cloven helm  Sir Elmer's javelin stood  He bow'd his head slow dropt his spear  The reins slipt through his hand  And stain'd with blood his stately corse  Lay breathless on the strand  " O bear me off" Sir Elmer cried  " Before my painful sight  " The combat swimsYet Hengist's vest  " I claim as victor's right"  Brave Hengist's fall the Saxons saw  And all in terror fled  The bowmen to his castle gates  The bold Sir Elmer led  " Oh wash my wounds my sister dear  " O pull this Saxon dart  " That whizzing from young Hengist's arm  " Has almost pierc'd my heart  " Yet in my hall his vest shall hang  " And Britons yet unborn  " Shall with the trophies of today  " Their solemn feasts adorn  Alltrembling Mey beheld the vest  " Oh Merlin" loud she cried  " Thy words are truemy slaughter'd Love  " Shall have a breathless bride  " Oh Elmer Elmer boast no more  " That low my Hengist lies  " O Hengist cruel was thine arm  " My brother bleeds and dies"  She spakethe roses left her cheek  And Life's warm spirits fled  So nipt by Winter's lingering blasts  The Snowdrop bows the head  Yet parting life one struggle gave  She lifts her languid eyes  " Return my Hengist oh return  " My slaughter'd love" she cries  " Ohstill he liveshe smiles again  " With all his grace he moves  " I comeI come where bow nor spear  " Shall more disturb our loves"  She spakeshe died The Saxon dart  Was drawn from Elmer's side  And thrice he call'd his sister Mey  And thrice he groan'd and died  Where in the dale a mossgrown cross  O'ershades an aged thorn  Sir Elmer's and young Hengist's corse  Were by the spearmen borne  And there all clad in robes of white  With many a sigh and tear  The village maids to Hengist's grave  Did Mey's fair body bear  And there at dawn and fall of day  All from the neighbouring groves  The Turtles wail in widow'd notes  And sing their hapless loves  KNOWLEDGE AN ODE  BY THE SAME  Ducit in èrrorem variarum ambage viarum  OVID  HIGH on a hill's green bosom laid  At ease my careless Fancy stray'd  And o'er the landskip ran  Review'd what scenes the seasons show  And weigh'd what share of joy and woe  Is doom'd to toiling Man  The nibbling flocks around me bleat  The oxen low beneath my feet  Along the clover'd dale  The golden sheaves the reapers bind  The ploughman whistles near behind  And breaks the newmown vale  " Hail Knowledge gift of heaven I cried  " E'en all the gifts of heaven beside  " Compar'd to thee how low  " The blessings of the earth and air  " The beasts of fold and forest share  " But godlike Beings KNOW  " How mean the shortliv'd joys of Sense  " But how sublime the excellence  " Of Wisdom's sacred lore  " In Death's deep shades what nations lie  " Yet still can Wisdom's piercing eye  " Their mighty deeds explore  " She sees the little Spartan band  " With great Leonidas withstand  " The Asian world in arms  " She hears the heavenly sounds that hung  " On Homer's and on Plato's tongue  " And glows at Tully's charms  " The wonders of the spacious sky  " She penetrates with Newton's eye  " And marks the planets roll  " The human mind with Locke she scans  " With Cambray Virtue's flame she fans  " And lifts to heaven the soul  " How matter takes ten thousand forms  " Of metals plants of men and worms  " She joys to trace with Boyle  " This life she deems an infant state  " A gleam that bodes a light complete  " When done the mortal toil  " What numerous ills in life befal  " Yet Wisdom learns to scorn them all  " And arms the breast with steel  " E'en Death's pale face no horror wears  " But ah what horrid pangs and fears  " Unknowing wretches feel  " That breast excels proud Ophir's mines  " And fairer than the morning shines  " Where Wisdom's treasures glow  " But ah how void yon peasant's mind  " His thoughts how darken'd and confin'd  " Nor cares he more to know  " The last two tenants of the ground  " Of antient times his history bound  " Alas it scarce goes higher  " In vain to him is Maro's strain  " And Shakespeare's magic powers in vain  " In vain is Milton's fire  " Nor sun by day nor stars by night  " Can give his soul the grand delight  " To trace almighty power  " His team think just as much as he  " Of Nature's vast variety  " In animal and flower"  As thus I sung a solemn sound  Accosts mine ear I look'd around  And lo an antient Sage  Hard by an ivied oak stood near  That fenc'd the cave where many a year  Had been his hermitage  His mantle grey flow'd loose behind  His snowy beard wav'd to the wind  And added solemn grace  His broad bald front gave dignity  Attention mark'd his lively eye  And peace smil'd in his face  He beckon'd with his wrinkled hand  My ear was all at his command  And thus the Sage began  " Godlike it is to know I own  " But oh how little can be known  " By poor shortsighted man  " Go mark the Schools where letter'd Pride  " And starcrown'd Science boastful guide  " Display their fairest light  " There led by some pale meteor's ray  " That leaves them oft the Sages stray  " And grope in endless night  " Of Wisdom proud yon Sage exclaims  " Virtue and Vice are merely names  " And changing every hour  " Ashley how loud in Virtue's praise  " Yet Ashley with a kiss betrays  " And strips her of her dower  " Hark Bolingbroke his God arraigns  " Hobbs smiles on Vice Descartes maintains  " A godless passive cause  " See Bayle oft slily shifting round  " Would fondly fix on sceptic ground  " And wrest th' eternal laws  " And what the joy this lore bestows  " Alas no joy no hope it knows  " Above what Brutes may claim  " To quench our noblest native fire  " That bids to nobler worlds aspire  " Is all its hope its aim  " Not Afric's wilds nor Babel's waste  " Where Ignorance her tents hath plac'd  " More dismal scene display  " A scene where Virtue sickening dies  " Where Vice to dark extinction flies  " And scorns the future day  " Wisdom you boast to you is given  " At night then mark the fires of heaven  " And let thy mind explore  " Swift as the lightning let it fly  " From star to star from sky to sky  " Still still are millions more  " Th' immense ideas strike the soul  " With pleasing horror and controul  " Thy Wisdom's empty boast  " What are theyThou canst never say  " Then silent adoration pay  " And be in wonder lost  " Say how the selfsame roots produce  " The wholesome food and poisonous juice  " And adders balsams yield  " How fierce the lurking tyger glares  " How mild the heifer with thee shares  " The labours of the field  " Why growling to his den retires  " The sullen pard while joy inspires  " Yon happy sportive lambs  " Now scatter'd o'er the hill they stray  " Now weary of their gambling play  " All  ingle out their dams  " Instinct directsBut what is That  " Fond man thou never canst say What  " Far short thy searches fall  " By stumbling chance and slow degrees  " The useful arts of men increase  " But this at once is all  " A trunk first floats along the deep  " Long ages still improve the ship  " Till she commands the shore  " But never bird improv'd her nest  " Each all at once of powers possest  " Which ne'er can rise to more  " That down the steep the waters flow  " That weight descends we see and know  " But why can ne'er explain  " Then humbly weighing Nature's laws  " To God's high will ascribe the cause  " And own thy wisdom vain  " For still the more thou knowest the more  " Shalt thou the vanity deplore  " Of all thy soul can find  " This life a sickly woful dream  " A burial of the soul will seem  " A palsy of the mind  " Tho' Knowledge scorns the peasant's fear  " Alas it points the secret spear  " Of many a nameless woe  " Thy delicacy dips the dart  " In rankling gall and gives a smart  " Beyond what he can know  " How happy then the simple mind  " Of yon unknowing labouring hind  " Where all is smiling peace  " No thoughts of more exalted joy  " His present bliss one hour destroy  " Nor rob one moment's ease  " The stings neglected Merit feels  " The pangs the virtuous soul conceals  " When crush'd by wayward fate  " These are not found below his roof  " Against them all securely proof  " Heaven guards his humble state  " Knowledge or wealth to few are given  " But mark how just the ways of heaven  " True joy to all is free  " Nor Wealth nor Knowledge grant the boon  " 'Tis thine O Virtue thine alone  " It all belongs to thee  " With theehow blest the Shepherd lives  " Gay is his morn his evening gives  " Content and sweet repose  " Without theeever ever cloy'd  " To sage or chief one weary void  " Is all that life bestows  " Then wouldst thou Mortal rise divine  " Let innocence of soul be thine  " With active goodness join'd  " Thy heart shall then confess thee blest  " And ever lively joyful taste  " The pleasures of the mind"  So spake the Sage my heart reply'd  " How poor how blind is human pride  " All joy how false and vain  " But that from Conscious Worth which flows  " Which triumphs in the midst of woes  " And boasts an endless reign"  POLLIO  It has been often said that Fiction is the most proper field for poetry If it is always so the writer of this little piece acknowledges it is a circumstance against him The following Ode was first suggested and the ideas contained in it raised on revisiting the ruins and woods that had been the scene of his early amusements with a deserving brother who died in his twentyfirst year  AN ELEGIAC ODE  WRITTEN IN THE WOOD NEAR R CASTLE  BY THE SAME  Haec Jovem sentire Deosque cunctos  Spem bonam certamque domum reporto  HOR  THE peaceful Evening breathes her balmy store  The playful schoolboys wanton o'er the green  Where spreading poplars shade the cottagedoor  The villagers in rustic joy convene  Amid the secret windings of the wood  With solemn meditation let me stray  This is the hour when to the wise and good  The heavenly Maid repays the toils of day  The river murmurs and the breathing gale  Whispers the gently waving boughs among  The star of evening glimmers o'er the dale  And leads the silent host of heaven along  How bright emerging o'er yon broomclad height  The silver empress of the night appears  Yon limpid pool reflects a stream of light  And faintly in its breast the woodland bears  The waters tumbling o'er their rocky bed  Solemn and constant from yon dell resound  The lonely hearths blaze o'er the distant glade  The bat lowwheeling skims the dusky ground  August and hoary o'er the sloping dale  The Gothic abbey rears its sculptur'd towers  Dull through the roofs resounds the whistling gale  Dark Solitude among the pillars lowers  Where yon old trees bend o'er a place of graves  And solemn shade a chapel's sad remains  Where yon scath'd poplar through the window waves  And twining round the hoary arch sustains  There oft at dawn as one forgot behind  Who longs to follow yet unknowing where  Some hoary shepherd o'er his staff reclin'd  Pores on the graves and sighs a broken prayer  High o'er the pines that with their darkening shade  Surround yon craggy bank the castle rears  Its crumbling turrets still its towery head  A warlike mien a sullen grandeur wears  So midst the snow of Age a boastful air  Still on the warworn veteran's brow attends  Still his big bones his youthful prime declare  Tho' trembling o'er the feeble crutch he bends  Wild round the gates the dusky wallflowers creep  Where oft the knights the beauteous dames have led  Gone is the bower the grot a ruin'd heap  Where bays and ivy o'er the fragments spread  'Twas here our sires exulting from the fight  Great in their bloody arms march'd o'er the lea  Eying their rescu'd fields with proud delight  Now lost to them and ah how chang'd to me  This bank the river and the fanning breeze  The dear idea of my POLLIO bring  So shone the moon through these soft nodding trees  When here we wander'd in the eves of Spring  When April's smiles the flowery lawn adorn  And modest cowslips deck the streamlet's side  When fragrant orchards to the roseate morn  Unfold their bloom in heaven's own colours dy'd  So fair a blossom gentle POLLIO wore  These were the emblems of his healthful mind  To him the letter'd page display'd its lore  To him bright Fancy all her wealth resign'd  Him with her purest flames the Muse endow'd  Flames never to th' illiberal thought allied  The sacred sisters led where Virtue glow'd  In all her charms he saw he felt and died  Oh partner of my infant griefs and joys  Big with the scenes now past my heart o'erflows  Bids each endearment fair as once to rise  And dwells luxurious on her melting woes  Oft with the rising sun when life was new  Along the woodland have I roam'd with Thee  Oft by the moon have brush'd the evening dew  When all was fearless innocence and glee  The sainted well where yon bleak hill declines  Has oft been conscious of those happy hours  But now the hill the river crown'd with pines  And sainted well have lost their cheering powers  For Thou art goneMy guide my friend oh where  Where hast thou fled and left me here behind  My tenderest wish my heart to Thee was bare  Oh now cut off each passage to thy mind  How dreary is the gulph how dark how void  The trackless shores that never were repast  Dread separation on the depth untry'd  Hope faulters and the soul recoils aghast  Wide round the spacious heavens I cast my eyes  And shall these stars glow with immortal fire  Still shine the  lifeless  glories of the skies  And could thy bright thy  living  soul expire  Far be the thoughtThe pleasures most sublime  The glow of friendship and the virtuous tear  The towering wish that scorns the bounds of time  Chill'd in this vale of Death but languish here  So plant the vine on Norway's wintery land  The languid stranger feebly buds and dies  Yet there's a clime where Virtue shall expand  With godlike strength beneath her native skies  The lonely shepherd on the mountain's side  With patience waits the rosy opening day  The mariner at midnight's darksome tide  With chearful hope expects the morning ray  Thus I on Life's stormbeaten ocean tost  In mental vision view the happy shore  Where POLLIO beckons to the peaceful coast  Where Fate and Death divide the friends no more  Oh that some kind some pitying kindred shade  Who now perhaps frequents this solemn grove  Would tell the awful secrets of the Dead  And from my eyes the mortal film remove  Vain is the wishyet surely not in vain  Man's bosom glows with that celestial fire  Which scorns earth's luxuries which smiles at pain  And wings his spirit with sublime desire  To fan this spark of heaven this ray divine  Still oh my soul still be thy dear employ  Still thus to wander thro' the shades be thine  And swell thy breast with visionary joy  So to the darkbrow'd wood or sacred mount  In antient days the holy Seers retir'd  And led in vision drank at Siloe's fount  While rising extasies their bosoms fir'd  Restor'd Creation bright before them rose  The burning desarts smil'd as Eden's plains  One friendly shade the wolf and lambkin chose  The flowery mountain sung "Messiah reigns"  Tho' fainter raptures my cold breast inspire  Yet let me oft frequent this solemn scene  Oft to the abbey's shatter'd walls retire  What time the moonshine dimly gleams between  There where the cross in hoary ruin nods  And weeping yews o'ershade the letter'd stones  While midnight silence wraps these drear abodes  And sooths me wandering o'er my kindred bones  Let kindled Fancy view the glorious morn  When from the bursting graves the just shall rise  All Nature smiling and by angels borne  Messiah's cross far blazing o'er the skies  EPIGRAM ADDRESSED TO THE AUTHOR OF THE NOTE ON THE FOLLOWING LINES OF POPE  " Let modest FOSTER if he will excel  " Ten Metropolitans in preaching well"  BY THE REV MR HENLEY  WHILE Wisdom shines with light divine  Whate'er SCURRILITY may say  Good FOSTER's name shall ne'er decline  Then cease vain cur the Moon to bay  THE SHAFT  BY THE SAME  BY the side of the stream that strays thro' the grove  I met in a ramble the blithe God of Love  His bow o'er his shoulder was carelessly ty'd  His quiver in negligence clanck'd at his side  A handful of arrows he held to my view  Each wing'd with a feather of different hue  " This fledg'd from the eagle he smiling begun  " I aim at the heart that no dangers will shun  " And this from the peacock all gaudy array'd  " The breast of Sir Fopling is sure to invade  " When I aim at the prattler who talks void of wit  " My shaft in the plume of a parrot will hit  " And when I've a mind that the jealous should smart  " I pierce with an owlfeather'd arrow his heart  " For the youth in whom truth and fondness reside  " From the breast of a dove my dart is supply'd  " This I value the most'twas this that I found  " From you O my Delia that gave me the wound"  IRIS TO PHILUS  BY THE SAME  IF slighted Iris can your pity move  If slighted Iris can recall your love  If e'er with joy you heard her softest vow  Renew the dear idea hear her now  You once was faithful oh the tender bliss  The sweet endearment and the thrilling kiss  These witness'd once when I for ever true  Plighted my heart a prey to love and you  And you untainted by the vice of art  Yielded to me in solemn faith your heart  Oh say the cause the cause I long to find  You dear deceitful man why now unkind  Hath Iris for her Philus now no charms  For him no pleasures in her vacant arms  Methinks I see while torture wounds my rest  Methinks I see you clasping to your breast  Some rosy blooming maid whose beating veins  Throb with soft tumults with extatic pains  While on her cheeks the deepening blushes rise  And melting raptures sparkle in her eyes  Such were the joys when I incautious maid  Too fondly trusting was by you betray'd  Such were the joys oh call the scene to mind  When Iris yielding all her soul resign'd  Ah then you swore the accents now I hear  Your turtles constant coo them to my ear  That hoary Time and joyconsuming Age  The ardors of your flame should ne'er asswage  But tho' unchang'd by age or hoary time  You slight my ripen'd charms my blushing prime  All fondness once upon my breast you lay  And sweetly sigh'd the hasty hours away  But ah how chang'd my fate forlorn I'm left  Of every kindlysoothing hope bereft  Whate'er was wont to court the roving eye  Now swells the tear and heaves th' unbidden sigh  Where'er I turn all Nature's charms seem fled  The sun withdrawn the sunflower droops her head  Robb'd of the prop where once she fondly clung  The faded woodbine trails the earth along  Unchang'd alone the mournful yew remains  And midst each varying blast its hue retains  Its leaves unchang'd my faithless swain reprove  But ah they cannot teach him how to love  If e'er for her you felt the slightest care  Whose form too often you've pronounc'd most fair  Whene'er I die and die ah soon I must  Whene'er this body moulders into dust  This only favour at your hands I crave  With mournful yews to shade my untimely grave  These mournful yews shall this memorial bear  Iris lov'd Philus and she dy'd sincere  LOVE ELEGY  BY THE SAME  AH cruel Delia must I still remain  In anxious doubt will nought your pity move  Must I still languish must I still complain  Still are you deaf to every plea of love  A stranger to the odious wiles of art  The coxcomb's chatter and the beau's grimace  I spoke the honest dictates of my heart  Nor mask'd deceit beneath the lover's face  I never boasted heaps of treasur'd gold  No dirty acres ever were my theme  The sordid wretch beneath contempt I hold  Who dares with love such worthless trifles name  And let the fair whom glittering dust delights  In lieu of jointure barter bliss and peace  Insipid pleasures waste her tedious nights  And jealous wranglings wear away her days  Not such the hours I hop'd with you to share  Not thus to tread the vulgar path of life  Such base such brutal joys can ne'er endear  Can ne'er insure the fond the tender wife  'Tis then O then we feel th' inraptur'd bliss  When lost in soft confusion sweetly coy  Each virgin charm glows with the melting kiss  And Nature faints beneath th' excess of joy  Tho' this would cloy if pleasures more refin'd  Forebore their influence o'er the breast to shed  Virtue alone secures the generous mind  She with fresh transport crowns the bridal bed  If words can tell let those whose hearts unite  In virtuous love absolv'd from all controul  Confess the pleasure the sublime delight  Th' extatic sense of mingling soul with soul  INSCRIPTION UNDER THE SHADE OF A LADY GIVEN BY HER TO THE AUTHOR  BY THE SAME  INVENTIVE Love parent of every art  That courts the fancy or that wins the heart  By

Aided by grief more deadly creeps at length  Thro' every vein and undermines my strength  Already Death hath summon'd me away  And Love fond Love scarce gains an hour's delay  Yet without dread Death's awful call I hear  No dark presages chill my soul with fear  No unrepented follies dread the grave  And one short moment more with anguish crave  Prepar'd I'm call'd from every terror free  Save that for ever I must part from thee  But when on thee my thoughts reflecting rove  And all the pleasures of our virtuous love  To think how blest we were how soon must part  One deepfelt pang would pierce the dullest heart  To cast one longing lingering look behind  Can be no guilty weakness of the mind  Methinks when heaven hath kindly blest us here  Fond Love at parting sheds a pious tear  Still with each comfort will I cheer my heart  Resign'd to God tho' trembling to depart  Short is man's knowledge of a future state  Perplex'd with doubts and ignorant of fate  This one important truth we only know  Bliss waits the good the bad eternal woe  But what those blessings what those woes shall be  Thro' Life's dull casement since no eye can see  Let Fancy paint the raptures

charm more dear  From every dangerous step those feet to guide  Which here to follow was my virtuous pride  When wrath provokes or fortune proves unkind  To lull the raging tumults of thy mind  The

regions of quiet and joy  As led by the Muses you stray  Oh think that your Damon is by  And that such are the words he would say  Such may be the words he might say  But what words can his passion

 Yet thy love was not equal to mine  THE HERMIT  AT the close of the day when the hamlet is still  And mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove  When nought but the torrent is heard on the hill  And nought but the nightingale's song in the grove  'Twas then by the cave of a mountain reclin'd  An Hermit his nightly complaint thus began  Tho' mournful his voice his heart was resign'd  He thought as a sage but he felt as a man  " Ah why thus abandon'd to mourning and woe  " Why thus lonely Philomel slows thy sad strain  " For Spring shall return and a lover bestow  " And thy bosom no trace of dejection retain  " Yet if pity inspire thee ah cease not thy lay  " Mourn sweetest complainer man calls thee to mourn  " O soothe him whose pleasures like thine pass away  " Full swiftly they pass but they never return  " Now gliding remote on the verge of the sky  " The moon half extinct her wan crescent displays  " Yet lately I saw where majestic on high  " She shone and the stars were conceal'd in her rays  " Roil on thou fair orb and with gladness pursue  " The path that conducts thee to splendor again  " But man's faded glory no change shall renew  " Ah fool to exult in a glory so vain  " 'Tis dark and the landscape is lovely no more  " I mourn not ye woodlands I mourn not for you  " For morn shall return all your charms to restore  " Perfum'd with fresh fragrance and glittering with dew  " Nor yet for the ravage of Winter I mourn  " Kind Nature the embryo blossoms shall save  " But when shall Spring visit the mouldering urn  " Oh when shall it dawn on the gloom of the grave"  DEATH A POETICAL ESSAY  BY DR PORTEUS  FIRST PRINTED AT CAMBRIDGE  FRIEND to the wretch whom every friend forsakes  I woo thee Death In Fancy's fairy paths  Let the gay Songster rove and gently trill  The strain of empty joyLife and its joys  I leave to those that prize themAt this hour  This solemn hour when Silence rules the world  And wearied Nature makes a general pause  Wrapt in Night's sable robe through cloysters drear  And charnels pale tenanted by a throng  Of meagre phantoms shooting cross my path  With silent glance I seek the shadowy vale  Of DeathDeep in a murky cave's recess  Lav'd by Oblivion's listless stream and fenc'd  By shelving rocks and intermingled horrors  Of yew' and cypress' shade from all intrusion  Of busy noontidebeam the Monarch sits  In unsubstantial Majesty enthron'd  At his right hand nearest himself in place  And frightfulness of form his parent Sin  With fatal industry and cruel care  Busies herself in pointing all his stings  And tipping every shaft with venom drawn  From her infernal store around him rang'd  In terrible array and strange diversity  Of uncouth shapes stand his dread Ministers  Foremost Old Age his natural ally  And firmest friend next him diseases thick  A motley train Fever with cheek of fire  Consumption wan Palsy half warm with life  And half a claycold lump jointtorturing Gout  And evergnawing Rheum Convulsion wild  Swol'n Dropsy panting Asthma Apoplex  Fullgorg'dThere too the Pestilence that walks  In darkness and the Sickness that destroys  At broad noonday These and a thousand more  Horrid to tell attentive wait and when  By Heaven's command Death waves his ebon wand  Sudden rush forth to execute his purpose  And scatter desolation o'er the Earth  Illfated Man for whom such various forms  Of Misery wait and mark their future prey  Ah why AllRighteous Father didst thou make  This Creature Man why wake th' unconscious dust  To life and wretchedness O better far  Still had he slept in uncreated night  If this the Lot of BeingWas it for this  Thy Breath divine kindled within his breast  The vital flame For this was thy fair image  Stampt on his soul in godlike lineaments  For this dominion given him absolute  O'er all thy creatures only that he might reign  Supreme in woe From the blest source of Good  Could Pain and Death proceed Could such foul Ills  Fall from fair Mercy's hands Far be the thought  The impious thought God never made a Creature  But what was good He made a living Man  The Man of Death was made by Man himself  Forth from his Maker's hands he sprung to life  Fresh with immortal bloom No pain he knew  No fear of death no check to his desires  Save one command That one command which stood  'Twixt him and ruin the test of his obedience  Urg'd on by wanton curiosity  He brokeThere in one moment was undone  The fairest of God's works The same rash hand  That pluck'd in evil hour the fatal fruit  Unbarr'd the gates of Hell and let loose Sin  And Death and all the family of Pain  To prey upon Mankind Young Nature saw  The monstrous crew and shook thro' all her frame  Then fled her newborn lustre then begar  Heaven's chearful face to low'r then vapours choak'd  The troubled air and form'd a veil of clouds  To hide the willing Sun The Earth convuls'd  With painful throes threw forth a bristly crop  Of thorns and briars and Insect Bird and Beast  That wont before with admiration fond  To gaze at Man and fearless croud around him  Now fled before his face shunning in haste  Th' infection of his misery He alone  Who justly might th' offended Lord of Man  Turn'd not away his face he full of pity  Forsook not in this uttermost distress  His bestlov'd work That comfort still remain'd  That best that greatest comfort in affliction  The countenance of God and thro' the gloom  Shot forth some kindly gleams to chear and warm  Th' offender's sinking soul Hope sent from Heaven  Uprais'd his drooping head and shew'd afar  A happier scene of things the Promis'd Seed  Trampling upon the Serpent's humbled crest  Death of his sting disarm'd and the dank grave  Made pervious to the realms of endless day  No more the limit but the gate of life  Chear'd with the view Man went to till the ground  From whence he rose sentenc'd indeed to toil  As to a punishment yet ev'n in wrath  So merciful is Heaven this toil became  The solace of his woes the sweet employ  Of many a livelong hour and surest guard  Against disease and DeathDeath tho' denounc'd  Was yet a distant Ill by feeble arm  Of Age his sole support led slowly on  Not then as since the shortliv'd sons of men  Flock'd to his realms in countless multitudes  Scarce in the course of twice five hundred years  One solitary ghost went shivering down  To his unpeopled shore In sober state  Through the sequester'd vale of rural life  The venerable Patriarch guileless held  The tenor of his way Labour prepar'd  His simple fare and Temperance rul'd his board  Tir'd with his daily toil at early eve  He sunk to sudden rest gentle and pure  As breath of evening Zephyr and as sweet  Were all his slumbers with the Sun lie rose  Alert and vigorous as He to run  His destin'd course Thus nerv'd with Giant Strength  He stem'd the tide of time and stood the shock  Of ages rolling harmless o'er his head  At life's meridian point arriv'd he stood  And looking round saw all the vallies fill'd  With nations from his loins fullwell content  To leave his race thus scatter'd o'er the Earth  Along the gentle slope of life's decline  He bent his gradual way till full of years  He dropt like mellow fruit into his grave  Such in the infancy of time was Man  So calm was life so impotent was Death  O had he but preserv'd these few remains  These shatter'd fragments of lost happiness  Snatch'd by the hand of heaven from the sad wreck  Of innocence primaeval still had he liv'd  Great ev'n in ruin tho' fall'n yet not forlorn  Though mortal yet not every where beset  With Death in every shape But He impatient  To be compleatly wretched hastes to fill up  The measure of his woes 'Twas Man himself  Brought Death into the world And Man himself  Gave keenness to his darts quicken'd his pace  And multiplied destruction on mankind  First Envy EldestBorn of Hell embru'd  Her hands in blood and taught the Sons of Men  To make a Death which Nature never made  And God abhorr'd with violence rude to break  The thread of life ere half its length was run  And rob a wretched brother of his being  With joy Ambition saw and soon improv'd  The execrable deed 'Twas not enough  By subtle fraud to snatch a single life  Puny impiety whole kingdoms fell  To sate the lust of power more horrid still  The foulest stain and scandal of our nature  Became its boastOne Murder made a Villain  Millions a HeroPrinces were privileg'd  To kill and numbers sanctified the crime  Ah why will Kings forget that they are Men  And Men that they are brethren Why delight  In human sacrifice Why burst the ties  Of Nature that should knit their souls together  In one soft bond of amity and love  Yet still they breathe destruction still go on  Inhumanly ingenious to find out  New pains for life new terrors for the grave  Artificers of Death Still Monarchs dream  Of universal Empire growing up  From universal ruinBlast the design  Great God of Hosts nor let thy creatures fall  Unpitied victims at Ambition's shrine  Yet say should Tyrants learn at last to feel  And the loud din of battle cease to roar  Should doveey'd Peace o'er all the earth extend  Her olive branch and give the world repose  Would Death be foil'd Would health and strength and youth  Defy his power Has he no arts in store  No other shafts save those of warAlas  Ev'n in the smile of Peace that smile which sheds  A heavenly sunshine o'er the soul there basks  That serpent Luxury War its thousands slays  Peace its ten thousands In th' embattled plain  Though Death exults and claps his raven wings  Yet reigns he not ev'n there so absolute  So merciless as in yon frantic scenes  Of midnight revel and tumultuous mirth  Where in th' intoxicating draught conceal'd  Or couch'd beneath the glance of lawless Love  He snares the simple youth who nought suspecting  Means to be blestBut finds himself undone  Down the smooth stream of life the Stripling darts  Gay as the morn bright glows the vernal sky  Hope swells his sails and Fancy steers his course  Safe glides his little bark along the shore  Where Virtue takes her stand but if too far  He launches forth beyond Discretion's mark  Sudden the tempest scowls the surges roar  Blot his fair day and plunge him in the deep  O sad but sure mischance O happier far  To lie like gallant Howe midst Indian wilds  A breathless corse cut off by savage hands  In earliest prime a generous sacrifice  To Freedom's holy cause than so to fail  Tern immature from life's meridian joys  A prey to Vice Intemperance and Disease  Yet die ev'n thus thus rather perish still  Ye Sons of Pleasure by th' Almighty stricken  Than ever dare though oft alas ye dare  To lift against yourselves the murderous steel  To wrest from God's own hand the sword of Justice  And be your own avengersHold rash Man  Though with anticipating speed thou'st rang'd  Through every region of delight nor left  One joy to gild the evening of thy days  Though life seem one uncomfortable void  Guilt at thy heels before thy face despair  Yet gay this scene and light this load of woe  Compar'd with thy hereafter Think O think  And ere thou plunge into the vast abyss  Pause on the verge awhile look down and see  Thy future mansionWhy that start of horror  From thy slack hand why drops th' uplifted steel  Didst thou not think such vengeance must await  The wretch that with his crimes all fresh about him  Rushes irreverent unprepar'd uncall'd  Into his Maker's presence throwing back  With insolent disdain his choicest gift  Live then while Heaven in pity lends thee life  And think it all too short to wash away  By penitential tears and deep contrition  The scarlet of thy crimes So shalt thou find  Rest to thy soul so unappall'd shalt meet  Death when he comes not wantonly invite  His lingering stroke Be it thy sole concern  With innocence to live with patience wait  Th' appointed hour too soon that hour will come  Tho' Nature run her course But Nature's God  If need require by thousand various ways  Without thy aid can shorten that short span  And quench the lamp of lifeO when he comes  Rous'd by the cry of wickedness extreme  To Heaven ascending from some guilty land  Now ripe for vengeance when he comes array'd  In all the terrors of Almighty wrath  Forth from his bosom plucks his lingering Arm  And on the miscreants pours destruction down  Who can abide his coming Who can bear  His whole displeasure In no common form  Death then appears but starting into Size  Enormous measures with gigantic stride  Th' astonish'd Earth and from his looks throws round  Unutterable horror and dismay  All Nature lends her aid Each Element  Arms in his cause Ope fly the doors of Heaven  The fountains of the deep their barriers break  Above below the rival torrents pour  And drown Creation or in floods of fire  Descends a livid cataract and consumes  An impious raceSometimes when all seems peace  Wakes the grim whirlwind and with rude embrace  Sweeps nations to their grave or in the deep  Whelms the proud wooden world full many a youth  Floats on his watery bier or lies unwept  On some sad desert shoreAt dead of night  In sullen silence stalks forth Pestilence  Contagion close behind taints all her steps  With poisonous dew no smiting Hand is seen  No sound is heard but soon her secret path  Is mark'd with desolation heaps on heaps  Promiscuous drop No friend no refuge near  All all is false and treacherous around  All that they touch or taste or breathe is Death  But ah what means that ruinous roar why fail  These tottering feetEarth to its centre feels  The Godhead's power and trembling at his touch  Through all its pillars and in every pore  Hurls to the ground with one convulsive heave  Precipitating domes and towns and towers  The work of ages Crush'd beneath the weight  Of general devastation millions find  One common grave not ev'n a widow left  To wail her sons the house that should protect  Entombs its master and the faithless plain  If there he flies for help with sudden yawn  Starts from beneath himShield me gracious Heaven  O snatch me from destruction If this Globe  This solid Globe which thine own hand hath made  So firm and sure if this my steps betray  If my own mother Earth from whence I sprung  Rise up with rage unnatural to devour  Her wretched offspring whither shall I fly  Where look for succour Where but up to thee  Almighty Father Save O save thy suppliant  From horrors such as theseAt thy good time  Let Death approach I reck notlet him but come  In genuine form not with thy vengeance arm'd  Too much for Man to bear O rather lend  Thy kindly aid to mitigate his stroke  And at that hour when all aghast I stand  A trembling Candidate for thy compassion  On this World's brink and look into the next  When my soul starting from the dark unknown  Casts back a wishful look and fondly clings  To her frail prop unwilling to be wrench'd  From this fair scene from all her custom'd joys  And all the lovely relatives of life  Then shed thy comforts o'er me then put on  The gentlest of thy looks Let no dark Crimes  In all their hideous forms then starting up  Plant themselves round my couch in grim array  And stab my bleeding heart with two edg'dtorture  Sense of past guilt and dread of future woe  Far be the ghastly crew and in their stead  Let chearful Memory from her purest cells  Lead forth a goodly train of Virtues fair  Cherish'd in earliest youth now paying back  With tenfold usury the pious care  And pouring o'er my wounds the heavenly balm  Of conscious innocenceBut chiefly Thou  Whom softey'd Pity once led down from Heaven  To bleed for Man to teach him how to live  And oh still harder Lesson how to die  Disdain not Thou to smooth the restless bed  Of Sickness and of PainForgive the tear  That feeble Nature drops calm all her fears  Wake all her hopes and animate her faith  Till my rapt Soul anticipating Heaven  Bursts from the thraldom of incumbering clay  And on the wing of Extasy upborn  Springs into Liberty and Light and Life  THE DAY OF JUDGMENT A POETICAL ESSAY  BY DR GLYNN  THY justice heavenly King and that great day  When Virtue long abandon'd and forlorn  Shall raise her pensive head and Vice that erst  Rang'd unreprov'd and free shall sink appall'd  I sing adventurousBut what eye can pierce  The vast immeasurable realms of space  O'er which Messiah drives his flaming car  To that bright region where enthron'd he sits  Firstborn of heaven to judge assembled worlds  Cloath'd in celestial radiance Can the Muse  Her feeble wing all damp with earthly dew  Soar to that bright empyreal where around  Myriads of angels God's perpetual choir  Hymn Halelujah's and in concert loud  Chaunt songs of triumph to their Maker's praise  Yet will I strive to sing albeit unus'd  To tread poetic soil What tho' the wiles  Of Fancy me enchanted ne'er could lure  To rove o'er fairy lands to swim the streams  That thro' her vallies weave their mazy way  Or climb her mountain tops yet will I raise  My feeble voice to tell what harmony  Sweet as the music of the rolling spheres  Attunes the moral world that Virtue still  May hope her promis'd crown that Vice may dread  Vengeance tho' late that reasoning Pride may own  Just tho' unsearchable the ways of heaven  Sceptic whoe'er thou art who say'st the soul  That divine particle which God's own breath  Inspir'd into the mortal mass shall rest  Annihilate 'till Duration has unroll'd  Her neverending line tell if thou know'st  Why every nation every clime tho' all  In laws in rites in manners disagree  With one consent expect another world  Where wickedness shall weep Why Paynim bard  Fabled Elysian plains Tartarean lakes  Styx and Cocytus Tell why Hali's sons  Have seign'd a paradise of mirth and love  Banquets and blooming nymphs Or rather tell  Why on the brink of Orellana's stream  Where never Science rear'd her sacred torch  Th' untutor'd Indian dreams of happier worlds  Behind the cloudtopt hill why in each breast  Is plac'd a friendly monitor that prompts  Informs directs encourages forbids  Tell why on unknown evil grief attends  Or joy on secret good Why conscience acts  With tenfold force when sickness age or pain  Stands tottering on the precipice of Death  Or why such horror gnaws the guilty soul  Of dying sinners while the good man sleeps  Peaceful and calm and with a smile expires  Look round the world with what a partial hand  The scale of bliss and misery is sustain'd  Beneath the shade of cold obscurity  Pale Virtue lies no arm supports her head  No friendly voice speaks comfort to her soul  Nor softey'd Pity drops a melting tear  But in their stead Contempt and rude Disdain  Insult the banish'd wanderer on she goes  Neglected and forlorn Disease and Cold  And Famine worst of ills her steps attend  Yet patient and to heaven's just will resign'd  She ne'er is seen to weep or heard to sigh  Now turn your eyes to yon sweetsmelling bower  Where flush'd with all the insolence of wealth  Sits pamper'd Vice For him th' Arabian gale  Breathes forth delicious odours Gallia's hills  For him pour nectar from the purple vine  Nor think for these he pays the tribute due  To heaven of heaven he never names the name  Save when with imprecations dark and dire  He points his jest obscene Yet buxom Health  Sits on his rosy cheek yet Honour gilds  His high exploits and downy pinion'd Sleep  Sheds a soft epiate o'er his peaceful couch  See'st thou this righteous Father See'st thou this▪  And wilt thou ne'er repay Shall good and ill  Be carried undistinguish'd to the land  Where all things are forgotAh no the day  Will come when Virtue from the cloud shall burst  That long obscur'd her beams when Sin shall fly  Back to her native hell there sink eclips'd  In penal darkness where nor star shall rise  Nor ever sunshine pierce th' impervious gloom  On that great day the solemn trump shall sound  That trump which once in heaven on man's revolt  Convok'd the astonish'd seraphs at whose voice  Th' unpeopled graves shall pour forth all their dead  Then shall th' assembled nations of the earth  From every quarter at the judgmentseat  Unite Egyptians Babylonians Greeks  Parthians and they who dwelt on Tyber's banks  Names fam'd of old or who of later age  Chinese and Russian Mexican and Turk  Tenant the wide Terrene and they who pitch  Their tents on Niger's banks or where the sun  Pours on Golconda's spires his early light  Drink Ganges' sacred stream At once shall rise  Whom distant ages to each other's sight  Had long denied before the throne shall kneel  me great progenitor while at his side  Stands his descendant thro' a thousand lines  Whate'er their nation and whate'er their rank  Heroes and patriarchs slaves and scepter'd kings  With equal eye the God of all shall see  And judge with equal love What tho' the great  With costly pomp and aromatic sweets  Embalm'd his poor remains or thro' the dome  A thousand tapers shed their gloomy light  While solemn organs to his parting soul  Chaunted slow orisons Say by what mark  Dost thou discern him from that lowly swain  Whose mouldering bones beneath the thorn bound turf  Long lay neglectedAll at once shall rise  But not to equal glory for alas  With howlings dire and execrations loud  Some wail their fatal birthFirst among these  Behold the mighty murtherers of mankind  They who in sport whole kingdoms slew or they  Who to the tottering pinnacle of power  Waded thro' seas of blood How will they curse  The madness of ambition how lament  Their dearbought laurels when the widow'd wife  And childless mother at the judgmentseat  Plead trumpettongu'd against themHere are they  Who sunk an aged father to the grave  Or with unkindness hard and cold disdain  Slighted a brother's sufferingsHere are they  Whom fraud and skilful treachery long secur'd  Who from the infant virgin tore her dower  And eat the orphan's breadwho spent their stores  In selfish luxury or o'er their gold  Prostrate and pale ador'd the useless heap  Here too who stain'd the chaste connubial bed  Who mix'd the poisonous bowlor broke the ties  Of hospitable friendshipand the wretch  Whose listless soul sick with the cares of life  Unsummon'd to the presence of his God  Rush'd in with insult rude How would they joy  Once more to visit earth and tho' oppress'd  With all that Pain and Famine can inflict  Pant up the hill of life Vain wish the Judge  Pronounces doom eternal on their heads  Perpetual punishment Seek not to know  What punishment for that th' Almighty Will  Has hid from mortal eyes and shall vain man  With curious search refin'd presume to pry  Into thy secrets Father No let him  With humble patience all thy works adore  And walk in all thy paths so shall his meed  Be great in heaven so haply shall he 'scape  The immortal worm and neverceasing fire  But who are they who bound in tenfold chains  Stand horribly aghast This is the crew  Who strove to pull Jehovah from his throne  And in the place of heaven's Eternal King  Set up the phantom Chance For them in vain  Alternate seasons chear'd the rolling year  In vain the sun o'er herb tree fruit and flower  Shed genial influence mild and the pale moon  Repair'd her waning orbNext these is plac'd  The vile blasphemer he whose impious wit  Profan'd the sacred mysteries of faith  And 'gainst the impenetrable walls of heaven  Planted his feeble battery By these stands  The arch Apostate he with many a wile  Exhorts them still to foul revolt Alas  No hope have they from black despair no ray  Shines thro' the gloom to chear their sinking souls  In agonies of grief they curse the hour  When first they left Religion's onward way  These on the left

band whom mercy mild  God's best lov'd attribute adorn'd whose gate  Stood ever open to the stranger's call  Who fed the hungry to the thirsty lip  Reach'd out the friendly cup whose care benign  From the rude blast secur'd the pilgrim's side  Who heard the widow's tender tale and shook  The galling shackle from the prisoner's feet  Who each endearing tye each office knew  Of meekey'd heavendescended Charity  O Charity thou nymph divinely fair  Sweeter than those whom antient Poets bound  In amity's indissoluble chain  The Graces How shall I essay to paint  Thy charms celestial maid and in rude verse  Blazon those deeds thyself didst ne'er reveal  For thee nor rankling envy can infect  Nor rage transport nor high o'erweening pride  Puff up with vain conceit ne'er didst thou

shall cease when knowledge is no more  And this great day is come thou by the throne  Shalt sit triumphant Thither lovely maid  Bear me O bear me on thy soaring wing  And thro' the adamantine gates of heaven  Conduct my steps safe from the fiery gulph  And dark abyss where Sin and Satan reign  But can the Muse her numbers all too weak  Tell how that restless element of fire  Shall wage with seas and earth intestine war  And deluge all creation Whether so  Some think the comet as thro' fields of air  Lawless he wanders shall rush headlong on  Thwarting th' Ecliptic where th' unconscious earth  Rolls in her wonted course whether the sun  With force centripetal into his orb  Attract her long reluctant or the caves  Those dread Vulcanos where engendering lye  Sulphureous minerals from their

cities sepulchres and domes  Trophies and pillarsWhere is Egypt's boast  Those lofty pyramids which high in air  Rear'd their aspiring heads to distant times  Of Memphian pride a lasting monument  Tell me where Athens rais'd her towersWhere Thebes  Open'd her hundred portalsTell me where  Stood seagirt AlbionWhere imperial Rome  Propt by seven hills sat like a sceptred Queen  And aw'd the tributary world to peace  Shew me the rampart which o'er many a hill  Thro' many a valley stretch'd its wide extent  Rais'd by that mighty monarch to repel  The roving Tartar when with insult rude  'Gainst Pekin's towers he bent th'unerring bow  But what is mimic Art Even Nature's works  Seas meadows pastures the meandering streams  And everlasting hills shall be no more  No more shall Teneriff cloudpiercing height  O'erhang th' Atlantic SurgeNor that fam'd cliff  Thro' which the Persian steer'd with many a sail  Throw to the Lemnian Isle its evening shade  O'er half the wide AegeanWhere are now  The Alps that confin'd with unnumber'd realms  And from the Black Sea to the Ocean stream  Stretch'd their extended armsWhere's Ararat  That hill on which the faithful Patriarch's Ark  Which seven long months had voyaged o'er its top  First rested when the Earth with all her sons  As now by streaming cataracts of fire  Was whelm'd by mighty watersAll at once  Are vanish'd and dissolv'd no trace remains  No mark of vain distinction heaven itself  That azure vault with all those radiant orbs  Sinks in the universal ruin lost  No more shall planets round their central sun  Move in harmonious dance no more the moon  Hang out her silver lamp and those fix'd stars  Spangling the golden canopy of night  Which oft the Tuscan with his optic glass  Call'd from their wonderous height to read their names  And magnitude some winged minister  Shall quench and surest sign that all on earth  Is lost shall rend from heaven the mystic bow  Such is that awful that tremendous day  Whose coming who shall tell for as a thief  Unheard unseen it steals with silent pace  Thro' night's dark gloomPerhaps as here I sit  And rudely carol these incondite lays  Soon shall the hand be check'd and dumb the mouth  That lisps the faultering strainO may it ne'er  Intrude unwelcome on an illspent hour  But find me wrapt in meditations high  Hymning my great Creator  " Power supreme  " O Everlasting King to thee I kneel  " To thee I lift my voice With fervent heat  " Melt all ye elements And thou high heaven  " Shrink like a shrivell'd scroll But think O Lord  " Think on the best the noblest of thy works  " Think on thine own bright Image Think on him  " Who died to save us from thy righteous wrath  " And 'midst the wreck of worlds remember man"  TO A LADY GOING TO BATHE IN THE SEA  BY GEORGE KEATE ESQ  VENUS most histories agree  Sprung from the ferment of the sea  Yet I confess I'm always loth  To think such beauty was but froth  Or that the ocean which more odd is  Should from a bubble spawn a Goddess  Tho' hence my Laura learned fellows  Of such its wonderous powers still tell us  That every mother brings her daughter  To dip in this specific water  Expecting from the briny wave  Charms which it once to Venus gave  These charms my Laura strive to gain  And that you may not bathe in vain  I'll here as well as I am able  Give you a Moral to this Fable  Would you a Goddess reign o'er all  From the wide flood its virtues call  Free from each stain thy bosom keep  Clear be it as this azure deep  Which no capricious passion knows  But duly ebbs and duly flows  Tho' sometimes ruffled calm'd as soon  Still constant to its faithful moon  At whose approach with pride it swells  And to each shore its chaste love tells  Heedless of every change of weather  That wafts a straw or coxcomb feather  Which only on the surface play  And unobserv'd are wash'd away  Reflect that lodg'd within its breast  The modest pearl delights to rest  While every gem to Neptune known  Is there with partial bounty sown  In years thus ever may we trace  Each sparkling charm each blushing grace  To these let judgment value give  And in that seat of Beauty live  This Moral keep before your eyes  Plungeand a newborn Venus rise  PROLOGUE TO THE PLAY OF KING JOHN ACTED AT MR NEWCOMB'S AT HACKNEY IN MARCH MDCCLXIX  BY THE SAME  THE Bard whose scenes this night your thoughts engage  Has somewhere told us  All the world's a stage    Where all in one great farce their talents try  Are born love wed grow covetousand die  From hence I think we fairly may infer  That NATURE is or should be  manager  And yet in NATURE's spite we every day  Cast cur own parts  ourselves and spoil her play  Some vain conceit disturbs her sober plan  And ART debauches that strange creature man  Hence ere Life's  curtain drops  this truth is plain  That few the characters they take sustain  See CATOlike in Freedom's boasted cause  The maddening PATRIOT raves of dying Laws  With ready lash pursues the venal tribe  But what's the sequel  Exit  with a bribe  Not less a Player the METHODIST appears  In some hir'd barn his casual stage he rears  Prophane loquacious insolent and loud  The grave  JackPudding  of a sniveling crowd  Who promis'd heaven in change for pence receive  For those who teach  to die  know how  to live  The PRUDE austere who shuns each forward spark  Meets less reserv'd her footman in the dark  The gay COQUET the COXCOMB and the WIT  Across Life's stage like airy phantoms flit  Applause nor pity sure their parts command  The mark of scorn let  Affectation  stand  If then the  finish'd  man can sometimes err  And make mistakes on the World's Theatre  Desert himself as various passions call  And prove at last no character at all  We ask your candour if in us appears  Th'  imperfect  growth of unexperienc'd years  Tho' buds yet Learning like the sun has power  To rear the stem and paint the future flower  If JOHN should not each stroke of guilt impart  Nor CONSTANCE triumph o'er the feeling heart  Think in Life's happy morn we cannot know  The sad extent of baseness or of woe  Boys as we are to us each scene is new  If sometimes wrong e'en there we copy

was ever Woman's glory  Who has not heard of fam'd XANTIPPE's lute  That play'd her philosophic husband mute  Or her whose artful notes so well could slander  Her rival and subdue great ALEXANDER  What gifts of speech had EGYPT's QUEEN to boast  Who talk'd till ANTONY  the world well lost  Think of the Maid of ORLEANS JOAN of ARC  There was an enterprizing female spark  Whole armies she harangued whole hosts withstood  Her tongue was surely more than flesh and blood  Tho' last not least shall BESS of ENGLAND stand  Who box'd her courtiers with her own fair hand  To female rules profess'd a brave dislike  Her majesty could swear as well as strike  Ladies might I advise let's urge our power  Dethrone usurping man and take him lower  He'd only have us learn the gentle arts  Of

skies  Deep frowning clouds on clouds arise  Fraught with the thunder's roar  With fury heaves the raging main  When foaming billows lash in vain  The hoarseresounding shore  No flowery vale now charms the eye  No tuneful warblers of the sky  Now chear the lingering hours  No genial ray the groves illume  No zephyrs waft their mild perfume  From sighs o'er vernal flowers  Tho' blooming scenes are now no more  That aid the raptur'd soul to soar  Poetic thoughts refine  Yet still the moralizing page  To warm an unattentive age  These hoary scenes combine  With this I hail the opening year  Address the God whose works appear  Through each harmonious round  Who rules serenely rules the storm  Who gave the lurid lightnings form  Whose thunders rock the ground  O Thou alike where perfect day  In bright refulgent glories play  Around thy awful throne  When seraphs glow with sacred fires  When angels tune celestial lyres  To hymn thy praise alone  Still may thy providential care  With blessings crown the rising year  Impending ills restrain  Thy wisdom guide my youthful Muse  Thy sacred eloquence diffuse  And consecrate my strain  While thus revolving seasons roll  Obsequious to thy wise controul  Obedient to thy plan  With silent eloquence they preach  The most important lessons teach  To cold unthinking man  Behold thyself reflected here  The Spring proclaims thine infant year  Gay life the Summer's bloom  Mild Autumn speaks maturer age  Confirms thee Fool or hails thee Sage  While Winter shews the tomb  Or view the image of thy soul  As now the mountain surges roll  In wild tumultuous roar  Fit emblem of the wrathful mind  To Anger's tyrant sway consign'd  Where reason rules no more  Unlike its placid form serene  When Zephyr breathing o'er the scene  Sheds balmy peace around  Bless'd emblem of the conquering soul  Whose every passion knows controul  While conscious joys abound  That this may prove my bounteous share  Ascends my everconstant prayer  To thee allperfect Mind  O aid me in the arduous strife  Through each perplexing maze of life  To all thy ways resign'd  THE CONTENTED PHILOSOPHER  BY THE SAME  DEEP silence reign'd and dewy Night  Her silver vestment wore  The western gale breath'd calm delight  And busy day was o'er  To hail Reflection's hour I rose  Each throbbing care at rest  For sacred peace in mild repose  Had lull'd my anxious breast  The breezy mount the misty vale  Alternately I stray'd  The Gothic spire the lonely cell  My wandering eye survey'd  'Till where the trembling beams of night  O'er limpid currents play'd  Meanderingfix'd my roving sight  On deep Retirement's shade  The unambitious dome conceal'd  Fear'd no intrusive foes  From deepembowering trees reveal'd  The seat of calm repose  'Twas Sophron's grove an aged sire  Who vers'd in Wisdom's lore  Now tun'd his consecrated lyre  To close the silent hour  The hallowed strain inflam'd my breast  I gain'd the rustic cell  The courteous father bless'd his guest  Then gave th' instructive tale  " How false the aim of erring life  How fruitless the employ  That treads the pompous maze of strife  In quest of solid joy  The plumy tribes unceasing roam  Each verdant bough survey  But fix at last their leafy home  Where Silence wooes their stay  Where no alarming hinds invade  No fear their peace destroys  Remote in the sequester'd shade  They rear their callow joys  Thus restless Nature loves to range  Thro' life's gay scenes to rove  'Till Reason prompts the happier change  To Contemplation's grove  When Fortune smil'd when Pleasure woo'd  How indolently gay  Life's transitory stream I view'd  Unheeded waste away  The gay delusive dream once o'er  Calm Reason's thoughts arise  Obey'd the monitorial power  That whisper'd "Now be wise"  This silent grove my search survey'd  Where Peace displays her charms  How free Contentment's humble shade  From Fortune's wild alarms  Now free from each fantastic strife  Untroubled and serene  I wait the closing hour of life  To leave its empty scene  For tides of blifs that boundless roll  Around th' eternal throne  Shall waft the persevering soul  To joys on earth unknown"  But lo the fading stars declare  The eastern herald blows  " The hour of rosy morn is near  " And Nature claims repose"  I sigh'd and thought it soon to part  From Wisdom's ivyed cell  How ill my sympathizing heart  Could bid the Sage"Farewell"  For wealth be smiling Peace my share  With Friendship's generous love  And lost to each ambitious care  Be mine the flowery grove  There studious thought would wear the day  In each instructive page  Or happier speed the hours away  In converse with the Sage  Taught by the awful voice of Truth  Life's syren snares to fly  By Reason's card conduct my youth  And like my Sophron die  IL BELLICOSO  MDCCXLIV  BY MR MASON  HENCE dull lethargic Peace  Born in some hoary Beadsman's cell obscure  Or in Circaean bower  Where Manhood dies and Reason's vigils cease  Hie to congenial climes  Where some seraglio's downy tyrant reigns  Or where Italian swains  Midst wavy shades and myrtleblooming bowers  Lull their ambrosial hours  And deck with languid trills their tinkling rhymes  But rouse thou God by Furies drest  In helm with Terror's plumed crest  In adamantine steel bedight  Glistening formidably bright  With step unfix'd and aspect wild  Jealous Juno's raging child  Who thee conceiv'd in Flora's bower  By touch of rare Olenian flower  Oft the goddess sigh'd in vain  Envying Jove's prolific brain  And oft she stray'd Olympus round  Till this specific help she found  Then fruitful grown she quits the skies  To Thracia's sanguine plain she hies  There teems thee forth of nervous mold  Haughty furious swift and bold  Names thee Mars and bids thee call  The world from Pleasure's flowery thrall  Come then Genius of the war  Roll me in thy iron car  And while thy coursers pierce the sky  Breathing fury as they fly  Let Courage hurry swift before  All stain'd around with purple gore  And Victory follow close behind  With wreath of palm and laurel join'd  While high above fair Fame assumes  Her place and waves her eagle plumes  Then let the trumpet swell the note  Roaring rough thro' brazen throat  Let the drum sonorous beat  With thick vibrations hoarsely sweet  Boxen hautboys too be found  Nor be miss'd the fife's shrill sound  Nor yet the bagpipe's swelling strain  Solace sweet to Highland swain  Whether on some mountain's brow  Now squeaking high now droning low  He plays deft lilts to Scottish lass  Tripping it o'er the pliant grass  Or whether in the battle's fray  He lively pipes a bolder lay  The bolder lay such magic reigns  In all its moving Phrygian strains  Disperses swift to all the train  Fury stern and pale Disdain  Strikes every fire from every mind  Nor leaves one latent spark behind  Bear me now to tented ground  Where gaudy streamers wave around  Where Britain's ensigns high display'd  Lend the earth a scarlet shade  And pikes and spears and lances gay  Glitter in the solar ray  Here I'll join the hardy crowd  As they sport in gamesome mood  Wrestling on the circled ground  Wreathing limbs with limbs around  Or as they pitch the massy bar  Or teach the disk to whizz in air  And when night returns regale  With chat full blunt and chirping ale  While some voice of manly base  Sings my darling ChevyChace  How the child that's yet unborn  May rue earl Percy's hound and horn  How Witherington in doleful dumps  Fought right valiant on his stumps  And many a knight and 'squire full gay  At morn at night were clad in clay  While first and last we join and sing  " God prosper long our noble king"  And when Midnight spreads around  Her sable vestments on the ground  Hence I'll for a studious seat  To some strong citadel retreat  By ditch and rampart high ypent  And battery strong and battlement  There in some stateroom richly dight  With maily coats and faulchions bright  Emblazon'd shields of quaint impress  And a whole army's glittering dress  While the taper burneth blue  As Brutus erst was wont to do  Let me turn the ample page  Of some grave historic Sage  Or in Homer's sacred song  Mix the Grecian bards among  Nestor wise with silver'd head  And Ajax stern and Diomed  And many more whose wonderous might  Could equal e'en the gods in fight  Or list to Virgil's epic lyre  Or lofty Lucan wrapp'd in fire  But rather far let Shakespeare's Muse  Her genuine British fires diffuse  And briskly with her magic strain  Hurry me to Gallic plain  Just when each patriot Talbot bleeds  Or when heavenprosper'd Harry leads  His troops with sevenfold courage steel'd  To Agincourt's immortal field  But when th' imbattled troops advance  O Mars my every thought intrance  Guide me thundering martial god  Guide thro' Glory's arduous road  While hailing bullets round me fly  And human thunders shake the sky  While crowds of heroes heap the ground  And dying groans are heard around  With armour clanking clarions sounding  Cannons bellowing shouts rebounding  Guide me thundering martial god  Guide thro' Glory's arduous road  But should on land thy triumphs cease  Still lead me far from hated Peace  Me bear dread Power for warlike sport  To some waveincircled fort  Or if it yield more open sight  To some hoar promontory's height  Whose higharch'd brow o'erlooks the scene  Where Tritons blue and Naiads green  Sportive from their coral cave  Through the fluid chrystal lave  There eagerly I ken from far  All the waste of naval War  And catch a sympathetic rage  While the numerous fleets engage  And every distant shore rebounds  To the cannons rattling sounds  And the sulphurous fireship rends  And thousand fates around her sends  And limbs dissever'd hurl'd on high  Smoke amid th' affrighted sky  Then let black clouds above my head  With gleams of scarlet thick bespread  With lightning's flash and thunder's growl  Suit the spleen that shades my soul  There too let cranes a numerous flight  With beaks and claws rage bloody flight  And airy knights from every cloud  Prick forth their armour rattling loud  With blazing swords and comets drear  Dragging a trail of flaming hair  Such as diffus'd their baneful gleam  Over besieg'd Jerusalem  Or hung o'er Rome ere Julius fell  And if old Sages rightly spell  Were ever deemed to soreshow  Changes in our realms below  And when at length cold creeping Age  Freezes the torrent of my rage  Let me live amongst a crew  Of invalids of kindred hue  Of some main limb berest by War  Or blest with some deep glorious scar  Scar that endless glory draws  From Liberty and Albion's cause  Then oft well pleas'd with them retire  To circle round a seacoal fire  And all our past campaigns recite  Of Vigo's sack and Blenheim's fight  How valiant Rooke majestic trod  How Marlbro' thunder'd half a god  And then with sage prophetic eye  In future battles to descry  That Britain shall not fail to yield  Equal generals for the field  That France again shall pour her blood  And Danube roll a purpled flood  And when my children round me throng  The same grand theme shall grace my tongue  To teach them should fair England need  Their blood 'tis theirs to wish to bleed  And as I speak to mark with joy  New courage start in every boy  And gladsome read in all their eyes  Each

WRITTEN AT CLAVERTON NEAR BATH  BY THE REV MR GRAVES  AGAIN the balmy Zephyr blows  Fresh verdure decks the grove  Each bird with vernal rapture glows  And tunes his notes to love  Ye gentle warblers hither fly  And shun the noontide heat  My shrubs a cooling shade supply  My groves a safe retreat  Here freely hop from spray to spray  Or weave the mossy nest  Here rove and sing the livelong day  At night here sweetly rest  Amidst this cool translucent rill  That trickles down the glade  Here bathe your plumes here drink your fill  And revel in the shade  No schoolboy rude to mischief prone  E'er shews his ruddy face  Or twangs his bow or hurls a stone  In this sequestered place  Hither the vocal Thrush repairs  Secure the Linnet sings  The Goldfinch dreads no slimy snares  To clog her painted wings  Sad Philomel ah quit thy haunt  Yon distant woods  Warley Woods  among  And round my friendly grotto chaunt  Thy sweetlyplaintive song  Let not the harmless Redbreast fear  Domestic bird to come  And seek a sure asylum here  With one that loves his home  My trees for you ye artless tribe  Shall store of fruit preserve  Oh let me thus your friendship bribe  Come feed without reserve  For you these cherries I protect  To you these plums belong  Sweet is the fruit that you have pick'd  But sweeter far your song  Let then this league betwixt us made  Our mutual interests guard  Mine be the gift of fruit and shade  Your songs be my reward  UNDER AN HOURGLASS IN A GROTTO NEAR THE WATER AT CLAVERTON  BY THE SAME  THIS bubbling stream not uninstructive flows  Nor idly loiters to its destin'd main  Each flower it feeds that on its margin grows  And bids thee blush whose days are spent in vain  Nor void of moral tho' unheeded glides  Time's current stealing on with silent haste  For lo each falling sand his folly chides  Who lets one precious moment run to waste  ON THE ANCIENT CITY OF BATH  WRITTEN ON THE FINISHING THE CIRCUS  BY THE SAME  'MIDST flowery meads and Avon's winding floods  Romantic hills wild rocks and pendent woods  Behold fair Bath her stately front advance  In all the pomp of Latian elegance  The hills that rise in rich profusion round  With gardens deck'd or splendid villas crown'd  There Health and Pleasure hand in hand appear  And smiling weave their roseate arbours there  Deep in their mossy cells beneath these hills  The bounteous Naiads form the gushing rills  There various springs their mineral virtues blend  And warm in salutary streams descend  These streams to mortals balmy health restore  The Gout grows mild and Cholics are no more  Here languid nymphs regain the bloom of May  Here cripples dance and hurl the crutch away  Hither with lavish hand fresh peasants bring  The fruits of Autumn and the flowers of Spring  Whilst lowing herds from richest pastures pour  The draught salubrious in their milky store  Each bird of various plume that haunts the wood  Or wings the heath or dives the liquid flood  The spreading sea fish and the scaly fry  Contiguous coasts or neighbouring streams supply  Thus Art and Nature join in friendly strife  To shower on Bath the blandishments of life  Oh Bath thrice happy if to man 'twere given  T' enjoy with temperate use the gifts of heaven  Didst thou thy partial fate but truly prize  Didst thou increase in virtue as in size  Were Luxury banish'd with each baneful Vice  Th' infernal arts of Scandal Cards and Dice  The vagrant herds that every street infest  And Insolence with vigorous care suppress'd  Did no base miscreants to themselves unjust  By mean exactions liberal minds disgust  From distant counties Thanes in crowds should fly  Proud in thy domes to shun the wintery sky  Augusta's self should half deserted stand  And Bath possess the riches of the land  A FATHER's ADVICE TO HIS SON  BY JOHN GILBERT COOPER ESQ  DEEP in a grove by cypress shaded  Where mid day sun had seldom shone  Or noise the solemn scene invaded  Save some afflicted Muse's moan  A Swain towards full ag'd manhood wending  Sat sorrowing at the close of day  At whose fond side a Boy attending  Lisp'd half his father's cares away  The father's eyes no object wrested  But on the smiling prattler hung  Till what his throbbing heart suggested  These accents trembled from his tongue  " My youth's first hopes my manhood's treasure  " My prattling innocent attend  " Nor fear rebuke or sour displeasure  " A father's loveliest name is Friend  " Some truths from long experience flowing  " Worth more than royal grants receive  " For truths are wealth of heaven's bestowing  " Which kings have seldom power to give  " Since from an ancient race descended  " You boast an unattainted blood  " By yours be their fair fame attended  " And claim by birthright to be good  " In love for every fellowcreature  " Superior rise above the crowd  " What most ennobles human nature  " Was ne'er the portion of the croud  " Be thine the generous heart that borrows  " From others joys a friendly glow  " And for each hapless neighbour's sorrows  " Throbs with a sympathetic woe  " This is the temper most endearing  " Tho' wide proud Pomp her banners spreads  " An heavenlier power goodnature bearing  " Each heart in willing thraldom leads  " Taste not from Fame's uncertain fountain  " The peacedestroying streams that flow  " Nor from Ambition's dangerous mountain  " Look down upon the world below  " The princely pine on hills exalted  " Whose lofty branches cleave the sky  " By winds long brav'd at last assaulted  " Is headlong whirl'd in dust to lie  " Whilst the mild rose more safely growing  " Low in its unaspiring vale  " Amidst retirement's shelter blowing  " Exchanges sweets with every gale  " Wish not for Beauty's darling features  " Moulded by Nature's fondling power  " For fairest forms 'mong human creatures  " Shine but the pageants of an hour  " I saw the pride of all the meadow  " At noon a gay Narcissus blow  " Upon a river's bank whose shadow  " Bloom'd in the silver waves below  " By noontide's heat its youth was wasted  " The waters as they pass'd complain'd  " At eve its glories all were blasted  " And not one former tint remain'd  " Nor let vain Wit's deceitful glory  " Lead you from Wisdom's path astray  " What Genius lives renown'd in story  " To happiness who found the way  " In yonder mead behold that vapor  " Whose vivid beams illusive play  " Far off it seems a friendly taper  " To guide the traveller on his way  " But should some hapless wretch pursuing  " Tread where the treacherous meteors glow  " He'd find too late his rashness rueing  " That fatal quicksands lurk below  " In life such bubbles nought admiring  " Gilt with false light and fill'd with air  " Do you from pageant crowds retiring  " To peace in Virtue's cot repair  " There seek the neverwasted treasure  " Which mutual love and friendship give  " Domestic confort spotless pleasure  " And bless'd and blessing you will live  " If Heaven with children crowns your dwelling  " As mine its bounty does with you  " In fondness fatherly excelling  " The example you have felt pursue"  He paus'dfor tenderly caressing  The darling of his wounded heart  Looks had means only of expressing  Thoughts language never could impart  Now Night her mournful mantle spreading  Had rob'd with black the horizon round  And dank dews from her tresses shedding  With genial moisture bath'd the ground  When back to city follies flying  'Midst Custom's slaves he liv'd resign'd  His face array'd in smiles denying  The true complexion of his mind  For seriously around surveying  Each character in youth and age  Of fools betray'd and knaves betraying  That play'd upon this human stage  Peaceful himself and undesigning  He loath'd the scenes of guile and strife  And felt each secret wish inclining  To leave this fretful farce of life  Yet to whate'er above was fated  Obediently he bow'd his soul  For what allbounteous Heaven

 For tender faithful love this sad return  For innocence and truth Was it for this  By Virtue and the smiling Graces led  Fair types of long succeeding years of joy  She twin'd the votive wreath at Hymen's shrine  So soon to fade and die Yet O reflect  Chaste partner of his life you ne'er deplor'd  His alienated heart distrous state  Condition worse than death the sacred torch  Burnt to the last

CONTEMPLATION  BY MISS WHATELY  QUEEN of the halycon breast and heavenward eye  Sweet Contemplation with thy ray benign  Light my lone passage thro' this vale of life  And raise the siege of Care This silent hour  To thee is sacred when the star of Eve  Like Dian's Virgins trembling ere they bathe  Shoots o'er the Hesperian wave its quivering ray  All Nature joins to fill my labouring breast  With high sensations awful silence reigns  Above around the sounding winds no more  Wild thro' the fluctuating forest fly  With gust impetuous Zephyr scarcely breathes  Upon the trembling foliage flocks and herds  Retir'd beneath the friendly shade repose  Fann'd by Oblivion's wing Ha is not this  This the dread hour as ancient fables tell  When flitting spirits from their prisons broke  By moonlight glide along the dusky vales  The solemn churchyard or the dreary grove  Fond to revisit their once lov'd abodes  And view each friendly scene of past delight  Satyrs and fawns that in sequester'd woods  And deepembowering shades delight to dwell  Quitting their caves where in the reign of Day  They slept in silence o'er the daisied green  Pursue their gambols and with printless feet  Chase the fleet shadows o'er the waving plains  Dryads and Naiads from each spring and grove  Trip blithsome o'er the lawns or near the side  Of mossy fountains sport in Cynthia's beams  The fairy elves attendant on their queen  With light steps bound along the velvet mead  And leave the green impression of their dance  In rings mysterious to the passing swain  While the pellucid glowworm kindly lends  Her silver lamp to light the festive scene  From yon majestic pile in ruin great  Whose lofty towers once on approaching foes  Look'd stern defiance the sad bird of night  In mournful accent to the moon complains  Those towers with venerable ivy crown'd  And mouldering into ruin yield no more  A safe retirement to the hostile bands  But there the lonely bat that shuns the day  Dwells in dull solitude and screaming thence  Wheels the night raven shrill with hideous note  Portending death to the dejected swain  Each plant and flowret bath'd in evening dews  Exhale refreshing sweets from the smooth lake  On whose still bosom sleeps the tall tree's shade  The moon's soft rays reflected mildly shine  Now towering Fancy takes her airy flight  Without restraint and leaves this earth behind  From pole to pole from world to world she flies  Rocks seas nor skies can interrupt her course  Is this what men to thought estrang'd miscall  Despondence this dull Melancholy's scene  To trace th' Eternal Cause thro all his works  Minutely and magnificently wise  Mark the gradations which thro' Nature's plan  Join each to each and form the vast design  And tho' day's glorious guide withdraws his beams  Impartial chearing other skies and shores  Rich intellect that scorns corporeal bands  With more than midday radiance gilds the scene  The mind now rescu'd from the cares of day  Roves unrestrain'd thro' the wide realms of space  Where thought stupendous systems infinite  In regular confusion taught to move  Like gems bespangle yon etherial plains  Ye sons of Pleasure and ye foes to Thought  Who search for bliss in the capacious bowl  And blindly woo Intemperance for Joy  Durst ye retire hold converse with yourselves  And in the silent hours of darkness court  Kind Contemplation with her peaceful train  How won'd the minutes dance on downy feet  And unperceiv'd the midnight taper waste  While intellectual pleasure reign'd supreme  Ye Muses Graces Virtues heavenborn maids  Who love in peaceful solitude to dwell  With meekey'd Innocence and radiant Truth  And blushing Modesty that frighted fly  The dark intrigue and midnight masquerade  What is this pleasure which inchants mankind  'Tis noise 'tis toil 'tis frenzy like the cup  Of Circe fam'd of old who tastes it finds  Th' etherial spark divine to brute transform'd  And now methinks I hear the Libertine  With supercilious leer cry "Preach no more  " Your musty morals hence to desarts fly  " And in the gloom of solitary caves  " Austerely dwell what's life debarr'd from joy  " Crown then the bowl let Music lend her aid  " And Beauty her's to soothe my wayward cares"  Ah little does he know the Nymph he styles  A foe to pleasure pleasure is not more  His aim than her's with him she joins to blame  The hermit's gloom and savage penances  Each social joy approves Oh without thee  Fair Friendship Life were nothing without thee  The page of Fancy would no longer charm  And Solitude disgust e'en pensive minds  Nought I condemn but that excess which clouds  The mental faculties to soothe the sense  Let Reason Truth and Virtue guide thy steps  And every blessing Heaven bestows be thine  LIBERTY AN

earthly care's at rest  And musing Silence reigns  Then active Fancy takes her flight  Wide o'er th' etherial plains  Soars thro' the trackless realms of space  Sees endless systems roll  Whilst all

fades  Mixing with surrounding shades  Let the Muse in Fancy's glass  Catch the phantoms as they pass  See they rise A nymph behold  Careless wanton young and bold  Mark her devious hasty pace  Antic dress and thoughtless face  Smiling cheeks and roving eyes  Causeless mirth and vain surprise  Tripping at her side a boy  Shares her wonder and her joy  This is Folly Childhood's guide  That is Childhood at her side  What is he succeeding now  Myrtles blooming on his brow  Bright and blushing as the morn  Not on earth a mortal born  Wings the flying to pursue  Shafts to pierce the strong in view  Victim of his power behind  Stalks a slave of human kind  Whose disdain of all the free  Speaks the mind's captivity  Love's the tyrant Youth's the slave  Youth in vain is wise or brave  Love with conscious pride defies  All the brave and all the wise  Who art thou with anxious mien  Stealing o'er the shifting scene  Eyes with tedious vigils red  Sighs by doubts and wishes bred  Cautious step and glancing leer  Speak thy woes and speak thy fear  Arm in arm what wretch is he  Like thyself who walks with thee  Like thy own his fears and woes  All thy pangs his bosom knows  Well too well my boding breast  Knows the thoughts your looks suggest  Anxious busy restless pair  Manhood link'd by Fate to Care  Wretched state and yet 'tis dear  Fancy close the prospect here  Close it or recall the past  Spare my eyes my heart the last  Vain the wish the last appears  While I gaze it swims in tears  Age my future self I trace  Moving slow with feeble pace  Bending with disease and cares  All the load of life he bears  White his locks his visage wan  Strength and ease and hope are gone  Death the shadowy form I know  Death o'ertakes the dreadful foe  Swift they vanish mournful sight  Night succeeds imperious night  What these dreadful glooms conceal  Fancy's glass can ne'er reveal  When shall Time the veil remove  When shall light the scene improve  When shall Truth my doubts dispel  Awful period who can tell  A MORAL THOUGHT  BY THE SAME  THRO' groves sequester'd dark and still  Low vales and mossy cells among  In silent paths the careless rill  Which languid murmurs steals along  Awhile it plays with circling sweep  And lingering leaves its native plains  Then pours impetuous down the steep  And mingles with the boundless main  O let my years thus devious glide  Through silent scenes obscurely calm  Nor wealth nor strife pollute the tide  Nor honour's sanguinary palm  When labour tires and pleasure palls  Still let the stream untroubled be  As down the steep of age it falls  And mingles with eternity  EPISTLE FROM LORD WILLIAM RUSSEL TO WILLIAM LORD CAVENDISH  This epistle is supposed to have been written by Lord RUSSEL on friday night July in Newgate that prison having been the place of his confinement for some days immediately preceding his execution    BY GEO CANNING ESQ  LOST to the world tomorrow doom'd to die  Still for my country's weal my heart beats high  Tho' rattling chains ring peals of horror round  While night's black shades augment the savage sound  'Midst bolts and bars the active soul is free  And flies unfetter'd CAVENDISH to thee  Thou dear companion of my better days  When hand in hand we trod the paths of Praise  When leagu'd with patriots we maintain'd the cause  Of true religion liberty and laws  Disdaining down the golden stream to glide  But bravely stemm'd Corruption's rapid tide  Think not I come to bid thy tears to flow  Or melt thy generous soul with tales of woe  No view me firm unshaken undismay'd  As when the welcome mandate I obey'd  Heavens with what pride that moment I recall  Who would not wish so honour'd thus to fall  When England's Genius hovering o'er inspir'd  Her chosen sons with love of Freedom fir'd  Spite of an abject servile pension'd train  Minions of Power and worshippers of Gain  To save from Bigotry its destin'd prey  And shield three nations from tyrannick sway  'Twas then my CA'NDISH caught the glorious flame  The happy omen of his future fame  Adorn'd by Nature perfected by Art  The clearest head and warmest noblest heart  His words deep sinking in each captiv'd ear  Had power to make even Liberty more dear  While I unskill'd in Oratory's lore  Whose tongue ne'er speaks but when the heart runs o'er  In plain blunt phrase my honest thoughts express'd  Warm from the heart and to the heart address'd  Justice prevail'd yes Justice let me say  Well pois'd her scales on that auspicious day  The watchful shepherd spies the wolf afar  Nor trusts his flock to try the unequal war  What tho' the savage crouch in humble guise  And check the fire that flashes from his eyes  Should once his barbarous fangs the fold invade  Vain were their cries too late the shepherd's aid  Thirsting for blood he knows not how to spare  His jaws distend his fiery eyeballs glare  While ghastly Desolation stalking round  With mangled limbs bestrews the purple ground  Now Memory fail nor let my mind revolve  How England's Peers annull'd the just resolve  Against her bosom aim'd a deadly blow  And laid at once her great Palladium low  Degenerate nobles Yes by Heaven I swear  Had BEDFORD's self appear'd delinquent there  And join'd forgetful of his country's claims  To thwart the exclusion of apostate JAMES  All filial ties had then been left at large  And I myself the first to urge the charge  Such the fix'd sentiments that rule my soul  Time cannot change nor Tyranny controul  While free they hung upon my pensive brow  Then my chief care my pride and glory now  Foil'd I submit nor think the measure hard  For conscious Virtue is its own reward  Vain then is force and vain each subtile art  To wring retraction from my tortured heart  There lie in marks indelible engrav'd  The means whereby my country must be sav'd  Are to thine eyes those characters unknown  To read my inmost heart consult thine own  There wilt thou find this sacred truth reveal'd  Which shall to morrow with my blood be seal'd  Seek not infirm expedients to explore  But banish JAMES or England is no more  Friendship her tender offices may spare  Nor strive to move the unforgiving pair  Hopeless the tyrant's mercyseat to climb  Zeal for my country's freedom is my crime  Ere that meets pardon lambs with wolves shall range  CHARLES be a saint and JAMES his nature change  Press'd by my friends and RACHEL's fond desires  Who can deny what weeping love requires  Frailty prevail'd and for a moment quell'd  Th' indignant pride that in my bosom swell'd  I suedthe weak attempt I blush to own  I sued for mercy prostrate at the throne  O blot the foible out my noble friend  With human firmness human feelings blend  When Love's endearments softest moments seize  And Love's dear pledges hang upon the knees  When Nature's strongest ties the soul enthrall  Thou canst conceive for thou hast felt them all  Let him resist their prevalence who can  He must indeed be more or less than man  Yet let me yield my RACHEL honour due  The tenderest wife the noblest heroine too  Anxious to save her husband's honest name  Dear was his life but dearer still his fame  When suppliant prayers no pardon could obtain  And wonderous strange ev'n BEDFORD's gold prov'd vain  The informer's part her generous soul abhorr'd  Though life preserv'd had been the sure reward  Let impious ESCRICK act such treacherous scenes  And shrink from death by such opprobrious means  O my lov'd RACHEL allaccomplish'd fair  Source of my joy and soother of my care  Whose heavenly virtues and unfading charms  Have bless'd through happy years my peaceful arms  Parting with thee into my cup was thrown  Its harshest dregs else had not forc'd a groan  But all is o'erthese eyes have gaz'd their last  And now the bitterness of death is past  BURNET and TILLOTSON with pious care  My fleeting soul for heavenly bliss prepare  Wide to my view the glorious realms display  Pregnant with joy and bright with endless day  Charm'd as of old when Israel's prophet sung  Whose words distill'd like manna from his tongue  While the great bard sublimest truths explor'd  Each ravish'd hearer wonder'd and ador'd  So rapt so charm'd my soul begins to rise  Spurns the base earth and seems to reach the skies  But when descending from the sacred theme  Of boundless power and excellence supreme  They would for man and his precarious throne  Exact obedience due to Heaven alone  Forbid resistance to his worst commands  And place God's thunderbolts in mortal hands  The vision sinks to life's contracted span  And rising passion speaks me still a man  What shall a tyrant trample on the laws  And stop the source whence all his power he draws  His country's rights to foreign foes betray  Lavish her wealth yet stipulate for pay  To shameful falshoods venal slaves suborn  And dare to laugh the virtuous man to scorn  Deride Religion Justice Honour Fame  And hardly know of Honesty the name  In Luxury's lap lie screen'd from cares and pains  And only toil to forge his subjects chains  And shall he hope the publick voice to drown  The voice which gave and can resume his crown  When Conscience bares her horrors and the dread  Of sudden vengeance bursting o'er his head  Wrings his black soul when injured nations groan  And cries of millions shake his tottering throne  Shall flattering churchmen soothe his guilty ears  With tortured texts to calm his growing fears  Exalt his power above the Aetherial climes  And call down Heaven to sanctify his crimes  O impious doctrineServile priests away  Your Prince you poison and your God betray  Hapless the monach who in evil hour  Drinks from your cup the draught of lawless power  The magic potion boils within his veins  And locks each sense in adamantine chains  Reason revolts insatiate thirst ensues  The wild delirium each fresh draught renews  In vain his people urge him to refrain  His faithful servants supplicate in vain  He quaffs at length impatient of controul  The bitter dregs that lurk within the bowl  Zeal your pretence but wealth and power your aims  You ev'n could make a SOLOMON of JAMES  Behold the pedant thron'd in aukward state  Absorb'd in pride ridiculously great  His courtiers seem to tremble at his nod  His prelates call his voice the voice of God  Weakness and vanity with them combine  And JAMES believes his majesty divine  Presumptuous wretch almighty power to scan  While every action proves him less than man  By your delusions to the scaffold led  Martyr'd by you a royal CHARLES has bled  Teach then ye sycophants O teach his son  The gloomy paths of tyranny to shun  Teach him to prize Religion's sacred claim  Teach him how Virtue leads to honest fame  How Freedom's wreath a monarch's brows adorns  Nor basely sawning plant his couch with thorns  Point to his view his people's love alone  The solid basis of his stedfast throne  Chosen by them their dearest rights to guard  The bad to punish and the good reward  Clement and just let him the sceptre sway  And willing subjects shall with pride obey  Shall vie to execute his high commands  His throne their hearts his sword and shield their hands  Happy the Prince thrice firmly fix'd his crown  Who builds on publick good his chaste renown  Studious to bless who knows no second aim  His people's interest and his own the same  The ease of millions rests upon his cares  And thus Heaven's high prerogative he shares  Wide from the throne the blest contagion spreads  O'er all the land its gladdening influence sheds  Faction's discordant sounds are heard no more  And soul Corruption flies the indignant shore  His ministers with joy their courses run  And borrow lustre from the royal sun  But should some upstart train'd in Slavery's school  Learn'd in the maxims of despotick rule  Full fraught with forms and grave pedantick pride  Mysterious cloak the mind's defects to hide  Sordid in small things prodigal in great  Saving for minions squandering for the state  Should such a miscreant born for England's bane  Obscure the glories of a prosperous reign  Gain by the semblance of each praiseful art  A pious prince's unsuspecting heart  Envious of worth and talents not his own  Chase all experienc'd merit from the throne  To guide the helm a motley crew compose  Servile to him the king's and country's foes  Meanly descend each paltry place to sill  With tools of power and plandars to his will  Brandishing high the scorpion scourage o'er all  Except such slaves as bow the knee to Baal  Should Albion's fate decree the baneful hour  Short be the date of his detested power  Soon may his sovereign break his iron rods  And hear his people for their voice is God's  Cease then your wiles ye fawning courtiers cease  Suffer your rulers to repose in peace  By Reason led give proper names to things  God made them men the people made them kings  To all their acts but legal powers belong  Thus England's Monarch never can do wrong  Of right divine let soolish FILMER dream  The publick welfare is the law supreme  Lives there a wretch whose base degenerate soul  Can crouch beneath a tyrant's stern controul  Cringe to his nod ignobly kiss the hand  In galling chains that binds his native land  Purchas'd by gold or aw'd by slavish sear  Abandon all his ancestors held dear  Tamely behold that fruit of glorious toil  England's Great Charter made a russian's spoil  Hear unconcern'd his injured country groan  Nor stretch an arm to hurl him from the throne  Let such to freedom forfeit all their claims  And CHARLES's minious be the slaves of JAMES  But soft awhileNow CAVENDISH attend  The warm effusions of thy dying friend  Fearless who dares his inmost thoughts reveal  When thus to Heaven he makes his last appeal  Allgracious God whose goodness knows no bounds  Whose power the ample universe surrounds  In whose great balance infinitely just  Kings are but men and men are only dust  At thy tribunal low thy suppliant falls  And here condemn'd on thee for mercy calls  Thou hear'st not Lord an hypocrite complain  And sure with thee hypocrisy were vain  To thy allpiercing eye the heart lies bare  Thou know'st my sins and knowing still canst spare  Though partial power its ministers may awe  And murder here by specious forms of law  The axe which executes the harsh decree  But wounds the flesh to set the spirit free  Well may the man a tyrant's frown despise  Who spurning earth to Heaven for refuge flies  And on thy mercy when his foes prevail  Builds his firm trust that rock can never fail  Hear then Jehovah hear thy servant's prayer  Be England's welfare thy peculiar care  Defend her laws her worship chaste and pure  And guard her rights while Heaven and Earth endure  O let not ever fell Tyrannick Sway  His bloodstain'd standard on her shores display  Nor fiery Zeal usurp thy holy name  Blinded with blood and wrapt in rolls of flame  In vain let Slavery shake her threatening chain  And Persecution wave her torch in vain  Arise O Lord and hear thy people's call  Nor for one man let three great kingdoms fall  O that my blood may glut the barbarous rage  Of Freedom's foes and England's ills asswage  Grant but that prayer I ask for no repeal  A willing victim for my country's weal  With rapturous joy the crimson stream shall flow  And my heart leap to meet the friendly blow  But should the fiend tho' drench'd with human gore  Dire Bigotry insatiate thirst for more  And arm'd from Rome seek this devoted land  Death in her eye and bondage in her hand  Blast her fell purpose blast her foul desires  Break short her sword and quench her horrid fires  Raise up some champion zealous to maintain  The sacred compact by which monarchs reign  Wise to foresee all danger from afar  And brave to meet the thunders of the war  Let pure religion not to forms confin'd  And love of freedom fill his generous mind  Warm let his breast with sparks coelestial glow  Benign to man the tyrant's deadly foe  While sinking nations rest upon his arm  Do thou the great Deliverer shield from harm  Inspire his councils aid his righteous sword  Till Albion rings with Liberty restor'd  Thence let her years in bright succession run  And Freedom reign coaeval with the sun  'Tis done my CA'NDISH Heaven has heard my prayer  So speaks my heart for all is rapture there  To Belgia's coast advert thy ravish'd eyes  That happy coast whence all our hopes arise  Behold the Prince perhaps thy future king  From whose green years maturest blessings spring  Whose youthful arm when allo'erwhelming Power  Ruthless march'd forth his country to devour  With firm brac'd nerve repell'd the brutal force  And stopp'd th' unwieldy giant in his course  Great William hail who sceptres could despise  And spurn a crown with unretorted eyes  O when will princes learn to copy thee  And leave mankind as Heaven ordain'd them free  Haste mighty chief our injur'd rights restore  Quick spread thy sails for Albion's longing shore  Haste mighty chief ere millions groan enslav'd  And add three realms to one already saved  While Freedom lives thy memory shall be dear  And reap fresh honours each returning year  Nations preserv'd shall yield immortal fame  And endless ages bless thy glorious name  Then shall my CA'NDISH foremost in the field  By justice arm'd his sword conspicuous wield  While willing legions crowd around his car  And rush impetuous to the righteous war  On that great day be every chance defied  And think thy RUSSELL combats by thy side  Nor crown'd with victory cease thy generous toil  Till firmest peace secure this happy isle  Ne'er let thine honest open heart believe  Professions specious forg'd but to deceive  Fear may extort them when resources fail  But O reject the baseless flattering tale  Think not that promises or oaths can bind  With solemn ties a Romedevoted mind  Which yields to all the holy juggler saith  And deep imbibes the bloody damning faith  What though the Bigot raise to Heaven his eyes  And call the Almighty witness from the skies  Soon as the wish'd occasion he explores  To plant the Roman cross on England's shores  All all will vanish while his priests applaud  And saint the perjurer for the pious fraud  Far let him fly these freedombreathing climes  And seek proud Rome the fosterer of his crimes  There let him strive to mount the Papal chair  And scatter empty thunders in the air  Grimly preside in Superstition's school  And curse those kingdoms he could never rule  Here let me pause and bid the world adieu  While Heaven's bright mansions open to my view  Yet still one care one tender care remains  My bounteous friend relieve a father's pains  Watch o'er my Son inform his waxen youth  And mould his mind to virtue and to truth  Soon let him learn fair liberty to prize  And envy him who for his country dies  In one short sentence to comprize the whole  Transfuse to his the virtues of thy soul  Preserve thy life my too too generous friend  Nor seek with mine thy happier fate to blend  Live for thy country live to guard her laws  Proceed and prosper in the glorious cause  While I though vanquish'd scorn the field to fly  But boldly face my foes and bravely die  Let princely MONMOUTH courtly wiles beware  Nor trust too far to fond paternal care  Too oft dark deeds deform the midnight cell  Heaven only knows how noble ESSEX fell  SIDNEY yet lives whose comprehensive mind  Ranges at large through systems unconfin'd  Wrapt in himself he scorns the tyrant's power  And hurls defiance even from the Tower  With tranquil brow awaits the unjust decree  And arm'd with virtue looks to follow me  CA'NDISH farewell may Fame our names entwine  Through life I lov'd thee dying I am thine  Wh pious rites let dust to dust be thrown  And thus inscribe my monumental stone  " Here RUSSEL lies enfranchis'd by the grave  " He priz'd his birthright nor would live a slave  " Few were his words but honest and sincere  " Dear were his friends his country still more dear  " In parents children wife supremely bless'd  " But that one passion swallow'd all the rest  " To guard her freedom was his only pride  " Such was his love and for that love he died"  Yet fear not thou when Liberty displays  Her glorious flag to steer his course to praise  For know whoe'er thou art that read'st his fate  And think'st perhaps his sufferings were too great  Bless'd as he was at her imperial call  Wife children parents he resign'd them all  Each fond affection then forsook his soul  And AMOR PATRIAE occupied the whole  In that great cause he joy'd to meet his doom  Bless'd the keen axe and triumph'd o'er the tomb  The hour draws nearBut what are hours to me  Hours days and years hence undistinguish'd flee  Time and his glass unheeded pass away  Absorb'd and lost in one vast flood of day  On Freedom's wings my soul is borne on high  And soars exulting to its native sky  A BIRTHDAY OFFERING TO A YOUNG LADY FROM HER LOVER  BY THE SAME  ERE this short winter's day be gone  My MARY ANNE is twenty one  Of days still shorter just a Lent  Patch'd up from different years is spent  Since her Devoted fairly reckon'd  The close of year the thirtysecond  Bending beneath the weight of years  Full as infirm as he appears  What can a wornout lover do  With twentyone at thirtytwo  For such a phrenzy no defence is  The girl has clearly lost her senses  Perhaps deceiv'd by some fond notion  Embrac'd in rapture of devotion  I quote such fancies to expose 'em  She dreams of bliss in Abraham's bosom  And chuses an Antique the rather  With better grace to call him father  Perhapsbut fiction be suppress'd  While real joy expands my breast  My faithful flame her heart approves  And O transporting thought she loves  When Souls by impulse sympathetick  By intuition most prophetick  By feelings which they cannot smother  Leap at first glance to meet each other  When each itself in t'other traces  What matter for their different cases  Of kin perhaps in preexistence  Without dull Reason's slow assistance  They recollect the happy union  And long to recommence communion  I must confess that such attraction  For ease convenience satisfaction  Were best if on deliberation  It met with Reason's approbation  Not as of absolute dominion  To rule by dint of dark opinion  Not as a Lord of sovereign sway  Whom love must worship and obey  But merely as the herd inferior  May judge the acts of Powers superior  As my poor intellect or thine  May scan authority divine  In short I'd have our simple love  Not  against  reason but  above  Two birds suppose of various feather  Hung in one room by chance together  To airs melodious tune their voices  While each the other's ear rejoices  If without half a note erroneous  The song be perfectly harmonious  What matter for the forms or ages  Of bills of feathers and of cages  DEAN SWIFT whose talent lives no more  His Stella sung at fortyfour  And breath'd an idle wish to split  In twain her beauty years and wit  Of half her charms he made a proffer  For youth but Time disdain'd his offer  Far happier I who well could spare  Of each accomplishment a share  Yet leave an ample store of charms  To bring Elysium to my arms  Am not reduc'd those charms to barter  And cry to heedless Time for quarter  Fly Sluggard on thy swiftest wing  My charmer yields not All till Spring  Then firm in Constancy's reliance  I bid thy cruel scythe defiance  Deal when thou wilt the deadly blow  Thou canst but separate below  Thy first can but for moments sever  Thy second reunites for ever  Perhaps suspending mortal rage  By silent sap and creeping age  By subtile secret slow approaches  As mildew on the blade incroaches  Thou hop'st malignant fiend to tame  The ardour of love's fiercest flame  Vain shalt thou find thy keenest blast  Bliss once possess'd thy power is past  Can years while sense remains destroy  The memory of transcendent joy  Can years bright Innocence impair  Can years make Virtue look less fair  But Beauty by thy influence curst  May sickenTyrant do thy worst  I know thy power and am prepar'd  To meet thy sharpest darts unscar'd  Though Body Mind thou canst controul  Own thy survivor in the Soul  Whose perfect bliss is not enjoy'd  Till thou art utterly destroy'd  Ev'n here as health and beauty fail  While lilies o'er the rose prevail  Long ere thy menac'd ills can harm  Though every hour should steal a charm  Long ere by twenty stars a day  The spangled Heavens would wear away  Unconscious of the gradual wane  As years their empire slowly gain  While my Ideas in the race  Observe a dueproportioned pace  And limbs grow cold and senses faulter  I sha'nt perceive her Person alter  When Age her dimpled cheek beguiles  And wrinkles plants instead of smiles  Though every Cupid he should smother  I'll think her handsome as their mother  When steady to his barbarous plan  To spoil my lovely MARY ANNE  The savage unrelenting creature  Has robb'd her face of every feature  And to conceptions merely common  My charmer seems a plain old woman  Still in my heart she'll hold her throne  Still in my eyes be twentyone  AN ELEGY

rang'd  In sweet society with Peace and Love  Oft in the silent evening all alone  When solemn twilight shades the face of day  The plaintive Muse shall hither waft her moan  With tenderest passion here inspire my lay  These hours allotted to that Muse's hand  To latest time thy memory shall endear  While soft ideas rise at her command  And in luxurious sorrow prompt the tear  Recal soft fame of

Tore my fond soul from all it held so dear  Twas o'erfarewelmy joys sweet hope adieu  Adieu my loveWe part for ever here  No in the still of night my restless thought  Pursues thy image thro' its change unknown  Steals oft unnotic'd to the dreary vault  And in that vale of Sorrow pours my own  Nor since the hour that clos'd our blooming scene  Once has it wander'd from its darling trust  It

 You that have lost an angelpity me  Thy smiles were minewere oft and only mine  Nor yet forsook me in the face of death  E'en now they livestill o'er thy beauties shine  For Fancy's magic can restore

every bloom that Fancy can supply  Reflection bends not on a point so mean  Nor courts this moment since the next we die  The dearest objects hasten to decay  An aweful lesson to the pensive mind  My Charlotte's beauties so soon pass'd away  Nor left but in my heart a wreck behind  A SONG  BY DR O  NOW Evening had tinged the gay landskip with gold  The swains were retired and their flocks in the fold  When Delia complain'd in the woodland alone  Loud ecchoes retain'd and replied to her moan  The warblers sat listening around on the spray  And the gale stole in murmurs as soft as her lay  " Ah my Strephon twas thus the fair mourner begun  How cruel to leave me thus lost and undone  Your vows like the wind you forget or despise  You slight my complaints and are deaf to my cries  The frown once so dreadful ah where is its power  The voice heard with transport gives transport no more  " Though the Sylvans to please me exert all their powers  Though the swains crown my head with a garland of flowers  Though they swear that my eyes like the morning are gay  That my song is more sweet than the nightingales lay  Yet while Strephon is absent dejected dismay'd  I droop like a flower that repines in the shade  " O return gentle Shepherd return to my prayer  Ah think how I sigh in unpitied despair  But in vain all my hopes all my wishes are vain  While the streams and the breezes thus hear me complain  While the birds to my anguish reply from the bough  He flies from my arms and regards not my woe  " Ah too easy to trust all the oaths that he swore  When he vow'd that no Nymph had e'er charm'd him before  Be warn'd then ye Fair nor too rashly believe  Think the men when they flatter but want to deceive  That the fond easy promise was ne'er meant to bind  And believe when they swear that their oaths are all wind"  THE TULIP AND LILY  BY MR BY  HIGH o'er the bed conspicuous seen  A Tulip rose the garden's queen  Never on Holland's foggy strand  Was taller rear'd by Dutchman's hand  Never was Flora known t' imprint  On Tulip's leaf a brighter tint  Or lead with more fantastic freak  On Tulip's leaf the varying streak  Beneath the tow'ring Tulip's shade  In nought but simple white array'd  And shelter'd from th' intruding view  A Lily of the valley grew  The humblest plant of all the train  That deck the mountain or the plain  Or on the river's margin blow  And paint the dancing scene below  Unenvying she the praise could hear  Of finer flow'rs that flaunted near  And she could see without a sigh  The saucy Zephyr pass her by  To woo the Pink more gayly drest  Or pant upon the Rose's breast  It chanc'd upon a Mayday morn  When blossoms crowd the whitening thorn  With more than usual lustre bright  The genial God of heat and light  Thro' the blue heavens pursu'd his course  And shone with more than Summer force  Each flow'r that glow'd in bright array  Witness'd the lifeimparting day  The Tulip too above the rest  The vig'rous warmth with joy confest  What transport in her bosom swell'd  Each varying streak when she beheld  Withdraw from the pursuing eye  And shift into the neighb'ring dye  The Lily's charms and humbler state  She view'd with boundless joy elate  And thus unable to refrain  Broke out in contumelious strain  " How vary midst the garden's race  " The marks of bounteous Nature's grace  " How boasts th' imperial Tulip's flow'r  " The effort of her vig'rous pow'r  " Who e'er could view without surprise  " Th' expanded leaf and glossy dyes  " The colours that together run  " And wave and brighten in the sun  " Whilst she that blossoms in my shade  " As tho' to spring from earth afraid  " No leaf expands nor dye displays  " Nor wins surprise nor merits praise  " Behold yon butterfly so sine  " Whose brightness almost equals mine  " That hovers o'er the gay parterre  " And hangs on wav'ring wings in air  " What tho' from flow'r to flow'r he sport  " And pay to all a passing court  " In vain with deepen'd tints they glow  " And fletter to the flutt'ring bean  " In vain each envious rival burns  " To kindred finery still he turns  " On me at length delights to rest  " And spread his plumage o'er my breast"  To these proud taunts and more beside  The Lily not a word replied  But hung her head with modest grace  Nor look'd th' insulter in the face  Not so the Bee who murmur'd near  And chanc'd th' opprobrious strain to hear  Illpleas'd to see the flow'r neglected  Which she so honour'd and respected  From whose full cup she daily drew  So large a share of precious dew  Whilst from her high and mighty neighbour  She scarcely got what paid her labour  Thus settled on the Lily's breast  Her indignation she exprest  " And whence proceeds the haughty strain  " Thou flow'r so useless and so vain  " Forget you then from whence you sprung  " The tawdry child of sordid dung  " What tho' in varying colours bright  " You glare awhile upon the sight  " The transient hour of blooming o'er  " Your faded charms attract no more  " And all your finery quite forgot  " Unmarkt you wither and you rot  " Now hither turn but your reflection  " You'll kiss the rod of my correction  " This flow'r on whom so rude you prest  " In Nature's simplest cloathing drest  " From her our num'rous tribes derive  " The choicest sweets that store the hive  " And she meek daughter of the vale  " That growing scents the passing gale  " Not less revives the ravish'd sense  " When rooted and remov'd from hence  " On Chloe's breast still seen to blow  " Adds whiteness to the dazzling snow  " And dealing sweetness tho' in death  " Perfumes e'en Chloe's fragrant breath"  THE INVITATION  BY THE SAME  AWAKE my fair the morning springs  The dewdrops glance around  The heifer lows the blackbird sings  The cchoing vales resound  The simple sweets would STELLA taste  That breathing morning yields  The fragrance of the flow'ry waste  And freshness of the fields  By uplands and the greenwoodside  We'll take our early way  And view the valley spreading wide  And opening with the day  Nor uninstructive shall the scene  Unfold its charms in vain  The fallow brown the meadow green  The mountain and the plain  Each dewdrop glist'ning on the thorn  And trembling to its fall  Each blush that paints the cheek of morn  In Fancy's ear shall call  " O ye in Youth and Beauty's pride  " Who lightly dance along  " While Laughter frolicks at your side  " And Rapture tunes your song  " What though each grace around you play  " Each beauty bloom for you  " Warm as the blush of rising day  " And sparkling as the dew  " The blush that glows so gaily now  " But glows to disappear  " And quiv'ring from the bending bough  " Soon breaks the pearly tear  " So pass the beauties of your prime  " That e'en in blooming die  " So shrinking at the blast of Time  " The treach'rous graces fly"  Let those my STELLA slight the strain  Who fear to find it true  Each fair of transient beauty vain  And youth as transient too  With charms that win beyond the sight  And hold the willing heart  My STELLA shall await their flight  Nor sigh when they depart  Still graces shall remain behind  And beauties still controul  The graces of the polish'd mind  And beauties of the soul  THE METAMORPHOSE  BY THE SAME  WITH rolling time that all things change  Has oft been said and oft been sung  One instance more the difference strange  'Twixt WITWOUD old and WITWOUD young  In youth compound of curls and lace  Of giggle fidget and of froth  One simper dimpled in his face  No butterfly more void of wrath  Pleas'd with himself with all wellpleas'd  The flutterer scarce could give offence  Or if he teaz'd with nought he teaz'd  But simple pure impertinence  Now view him in declining age  Assume the four satyric frown  On friends and foes discharge his rage  The very SCARECROW of the town  So Flies in frisk and buzz and play  That harmless through the summer past  When ready to be swept away  Grow blind and sting us at the last  THE SINE QUÔ NON  BY THE SAME  WITH MUCKWORM lately as in chat  I pass'd the sober hours  The mice for MUCKWORM keeps no cat  Came trooping in by scores  When famine leads what thing can daunt  Our courage what abate  Each mouse was as the mastiff gaunt  That growl'd before the gate  Their mien so grim alarm'd I spied  And looks of desperate woe  " And why neglect my friend" I cried  " To chase the threatening foe  " True 'tis that any more than you  " They cannot eat your pelf  " But then of other food in lieu  " They may devour yourself  " And think how odd th' account would sound  " Should future annals tell  " MUCKWORM fell not by hungry hound  Alluding to the Fable of Actaeon    " By hungry mice he sell  " Then drive the furious vermin hence  " To ward such dire mishap  " Nor fret I pray you for th' expence  " Myself will lend the trap"  " Your offer's kind" friend MUCKWORM cried  " And highly do I rate it  " But when the trap's by you supplied  " Who'll lend the cheese to bait it  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF CHESTERFIELD ON HIS LATE RECOVERY FROM A DANGEROUS ILLNESS  BY THE REV WALTER HARTE  Sed nihil dulcius est bene quam munita tenere  Edita

mountains stray  Snowdon's rude cliffs or huge Plinlimmon's height  Or in rough Conway's foaming floods delight  That down the steep rocks urge their headlong way  There chaunts the raptur'd bard in solemn strain  Malgo's strong lance Cadwallin's puissant reign  High deeds recorded yet in druid songs  Or swells his woewild notes of power to spread  Chill horror round the ruthless tyrant's head  For Urien's fate for bleeding Modred's wrongs  And smites the harp in dreadful harmony  Or does she love to lie  In the mild shade of Hulla's softer groves  And twine the vermeil wreath to grace the

towers rejoicing to behold  Forth walk'd the orient sun array'd in gold  First on their glittering tops t' impress his beams  Thence glancing downwards sparkled on the tide  That bends along yon hoar grove's mossgrown side  And scattered crimson o'er its azure streams  The Naiads hasting from their coral caves  Beneath the chrystal waves  In pearled braids their amber tresses bound  Thrice wav'd their hands and hail'd the rising towers  The woodnymphs too with florisht chaplets crown'd  Forsook their groves forsook their broidered bowers  And thrice their hands they wav'd and thrice they said

fall  Soft trickling from his urn in murmurs musical  Then on the stately structure's towery height  With conscious pride he fix'd his raptur'd eyes  And as past scenes of ancient glory rise  Arrang'd on Fancy's field in order bright  He paus'd then graceful bow'd his reverend head  And thus in lofty strain due homage paid  " Ye strongbas'd battlements ye gorgeous walls  " Ye princely structures

INSCRIBED TO CLEORA  BY MR ROBERTSON  Frons mitior aspici  Innubique nitens are meridies  CASIM lib I od xvii  OF damask cheeks and radiant eyes  Let other poets tell  Within the bosom of the fair  Superior beauties dwell  There all the sprightly powers of wit  In blithe assemblage play  There every social virtue sheds  Its intellectual ray  But as the sun's refulgent light  Heaven's wide expanse refines  With sovereign lustre through the soul  Celestial Sweetness shines  This mental beam dilates the heart  And sparkles in the face  It harmonizes every thought  And heightens every grace  One glimpse can sooth the troubled breast  The heaving sigh restrain  Can make the bed of sickness please  And stop the sense of pain  Its power can charm the savage heart  The tyrant's pity move  To smiles convert the wildest rage  And melt the soul to love  When Sweetness beams upon the throne  In majesty benign  The awful splendors of a crown  With milder lustre shine  In scenes of poverty and woe  Where melancholy dwells  The influence of this living ray  The dreary gloom dispels  Thus when the blooming spring returns  To chear the mournful plains  Through earth and air with genial warmth  Etherial mildness reigns  Beneath its bright auspicious beams  No boisterous passions rise  Moroseness quits the peaceful scene  And baleful Discord flies  A thousand nameless beauties spring  A thousand virtues glow  A smiling train of Joys appear  And endless blessings flow  Unbounded Charity displays  Her sympathizing charms  And Friendship's pure seraphic flame  The generous bosom warms  Almighty Love exerts his power  And spreads with secret art  A soft sensation through the frame  A transport through the heart  Nor shall the storms of age which cloud  Each gleam of sensual joy  And blast the gaudy flowers of Pride  These blest effects destroy  When that fair form shall sink in years  And all those graces fly  The beauty of thy heavenly mind  Shall length of days defy  TO FLORELLA PUTTING ON A FLOWERED HAT  BY THE SAME  FLORELLA veil those radiant eyes  Those lovely seatures hide  For which a thousand nymphs have wish'd  A thousand swains have sigh'd  Then

the kind officious cloud  That shades the dazzling rays  BARREAUX's CELEBRATED SONNET  GRAND Dieu tes jugemens sont remplis d'equité  Toujours tu prens plaisir à nous être propice  Mais j'ai tant fait

vengeance run  Which is not hallowed by the blood  Of thy beloved Son  MONODY TO THE MEMORY OF A YOUNG LADY  BY MR SHAW  YET do I live O how shall I sustain  This vast unutterable weight of woe  This worse than hunger poverty or pain  Or all the complicated ills below  She in whose life my hopes were treasur'd all  Is gonefor ever fled  My dearest EMMA's dead  These eyes these tearswoln eyes beheld her fall  Ah noshe lives on some far happier shore  She livesbut cruel thought she lives for me no more  I who the tedious absence of a day  Remov'd wou'd languish for my charmer's sight  Wou'd chide the lingering moments for delay  And fondly blame the slow return of night  How how shall I endure  O misery past a cure  Hours days and years successively to roll  Nor ever more behold the comfort of my soul  Was she not all my fondest wish could frame  Did ever Mind so much of Heaven partake  Did she not love me with the purest flame  And give up friends and fortune for my sake  Though mild as evening skies  With downcast streaming eyes  Stood the stern frown of supercilious brows  Deaf to their brutal threats and faithful to her vows  Come then some Muse the saddest of the train  No more your bard shall dwell on idle lays  Teach me each moving melancholy strain  And O discard the pageantry of phrase  Ill suit the flowers of speech with woes like mine  Thus haply as I paint  The source of my complaint  My soul may own the impassion'd line  A flood of tears may gush to my relief  And from my swelling heart discharge this load of grief  Forbear my fond officious friends forbear  To wound my ears with the sad tales you tell  " How good she was how gentle and how fair"  In pity ceasealas I know too well  How in her sweet expressive face  Beam'd forth the beauties of her mind  Yet heighten'd by exterior grace  Of manners most engaging most refin'd  No piteous object could she see  But her soft bosom shar'd the woe  Whilst smiles of affability  Endear'd whatever boon she might bestow  Whate'er the emotions of her heart  Still shone conspicuous in her eyes  Stranger to every female art  Alike to feign or to disguise  And O the boast how rare  The secret in her faithful breast repos'd  She ne'er with lawless tongue disclos'd  In sacred silence lodg'd inviolate there  O feeble wordsunable to express  Her matchless virtues or my own distress  Relentless Death that steel'd to human woe  With murderous hands deals havock on mankind  Why cruel strike this deprecated blow  And leave such wretched multitudes behind  Hark Groans come wing'd on every breeze  The sons of Grief prefer their ardent vow  Oppress'd with sorrow want or dire disease  And supplicate thy aid as I do now  In vainPerverse still on the unweeting head  'Tis thine thy vengeful darts to shed  Hope's infant blossoms to destroy  And drench in tears the face of joy  But oh fell tyrant yet expect the hour  When Virtue shall renounce thy power  When thou no more shalt blot the face of day  Nor mortals tremble at thy rigid sway  Alas the daywheree'er I turn my eyes  Some sad memento of my loss appears  I fly the fatal housesuppress my sighs  Resolv'd to dry my unavailing tears  But ah In vainno change of time or place  The memory can efface  Of all that sweetness that enchanting air  Now lost and nought remains but anguish and despair  Where wer the delegates of Heaven oh where  Appointed Virtue's children safe to keep  Had Innocence or Virtue been their care  She had not dy'd nor had I liv'd to weep  Mov'd by my tears and by her patience mov'd  To see her force the endearing smile  My sorrows to beguile  When Torture's keenest rage she prov'd  Sure they had warded that untimely dart  Which broke her thread of life and rent a husband's heart  How shall I e'er forget that dreadful hour  When feeling Death's resistless power  My hand she press'd wet with her falling tears  And thus in faultering accents spoke her fears  " Ah my lov'd lord the transient scene is o'er  " And we must part alas to meet no more  " But oh if e'er thy EMMA's name was dear  " If e'er thy vows have charm'd my ravish'd ear  " If from thy lov'd embrace my heart to gain  " Proud friends have frown'd and Fortune smil'd in vain  " If it has been my sole endeavour still  " To act in all obsequious to thy will  " To watch thy very smiles thy wish to know  " Then only truly blest when thou wert so  " If I have doated with that fond excess  " Nor Love could add nor Fortune make it less  " If this I've done and moreoh then be kind  " To the dear lovely babe I leave behind  " When time my oncelov'd memory shall efface  " Some happier maid may take thy EMMA's place  " With envious eyes thy partial fondness see  " And hate it for the love thou bore to me  " My dearest S forgive a woman's fears  " But one word more I cannot bear thy tears  " Promiseand I will trust thy faithful vow  " Oft have I try'd and ever sound thee true  " That to some distant spot thou wilt remove  " This fatal pledge of hapless EMMA's love  " Where safe thy blandishments it may partake  " And oh be tender for its mother's sake  " Wilt thou  " I know thou wiltsad silence speaks assent  " And in that pleasing hope thy EMMA dies content"  I who with more than manly strength have bore  The various ills impos'd by cruel Fate  Sustain the firmness of my soul no more  But sink beneath the weight  Just Heaven I cry'd from Memory's earliest day  No comfort has thy wretched suppliant known  Misfortune still with unrelenting sway  Has claim'd me for her own  But Oin pity to my grief restore  This only source of bliss I askI ask no more  Vain hopeth' irrevocable doom is past  Ev'n now she looksshe sighs her last  Vainly I strive to stay her fleeting breath  And with rebellious heart protest against her death  When the stern tyrant clos'd her lovely eyes  How did I rave untaught to bear the blow  With impious wish to tear her from the skies  How curse my fate in bitterness of woe  But whither would this dreadful frenzy lead  Fond man forbear  Thy fruitless sorrow spare  Dare not to task what Heaven's high will decreed  In humble reverence kiss th' afflictive rod  And prostrate bow to an offended God  Perhaps kind Heaven in mercy dealt the blow  Some saving truth thy roving soul to teach  To wean thy heart from groveling views below  And point out bliss beyond Misfortune's reach  To shew that all the flattering schemes of joy  Which towering Hope so fondly builds in air  One fatal moment can destroy  And plunge th' exulting Maniac in despair  Then O with pious fortitude sustain  Thy present losshaply thy future gain  Nor let thy EMMA die in vain  Time shall administer its wonted balm  And hush this storm of grief to no unpleasing calm  Thus the poor bird by some disastrous fate  Caught and imprison'd in a lonely cage  Torn from its native fields and dearer mate  Flutters awhile and spends its little rage  But finding all its efforts weak and vain  No more it pants and rages for the plain  Moping awhile in sullen mood  Droops the sweet mournerbut ere long  Prunes its light wings and pecks its food  And meditates the song  Serenely sorrowing breathes its piteous case  And with its plaintive warblings saddens all the place  Forgive me Heavenyetyet the tears will flow  To think how soon my scene of bliss is past  My budding joys just promising to blow  All nipt and wither'd by one envious blast  My hours that laughing wont to fleet away  Move heavily along  Where's now the sprightly jest the jocund song  Time creeps unconscious of delight  How shall I cheat the tedious day  And Othe joyless night  Where shall I rest my weary head  How shall I find repose on a sad widow'd bed  Come  Laudanum  Theban drug the wretch's only aid  To my torn heart its former peace restore  Thy votary wrapp'd in thy Lethean shade  Awhile shall cease his sorrows to deplore  Haply when lock'd in Sleep's embrace  Again I shall behold my EMMA's face  Again with transport hear  Her voice soft whispering in my ear  May steal once more a balmy kiss  And taste at least of visionary bliss  But ah the unwelcome morn's obtruding light  Will all my shadowy schemes of bliss depose  Will tear the dear illusion from my sight  And wake me to the sense of all my woes  If to the verdant fields I stray  Alas what pleasures now can these convey  Her lovely form pursues wheree'er I go  And darkens all the scene with woe  By Nature's lavish bounties chear'd no more  Sorrowing I rove  Thro' valley grot and grove  Nought can their beauties or my loss restore  No herb no plant can medicine my disease  And my sad sighs are borne on every passing breeze  Sickness and sorrow hovering round my bed  Who now with anxious haste shall bring relief  With lenient hand support my drooping head  Asswage my pains and mitigate my grief  Should worldly business call away  Who now shall in my absence fondly mourn  Count every minute of the loitering day  Impatient for my quick return  Should aught my bosom discompose  Who now with sweet complacent air  Shall smooth the rugged brow of Care  And soften all my woes  Too faithful MemoryCease O cease  How shall I e'er regain my peace  O to forget herbut how vain each art  Whilst every virtue lives imprinted on my heart  And thou my little cherub left behind  To hear a father's plaints to share his woes  When Reason's dawn informs thy infant mind  And thy sweetlisping tongue shall ask the cause  How oft with sorrow shall mine eyes run o'er  When twining round my knees I trace  Thy mother's smile upon thy face  How oft to my full heart shalt thou restore  Sad memory of my joysah now no more  By blessings once enjoy'd now more distrest  More beggar by the riches once possest  My little darlingdearer to me grown  By all the tears thou'st caus'dO strange to hear  Bought with a life yet dearer than thy own  Thy cradle purchas'd with thy mother's bier  Who now shall seek with fond delight  Thy infant steps to guide aright  She who with doating eyes would gaze  On all thy little artless ways  By all thy soft endearments blest  And clasp thee oft with transport to her breast  Alas is goneYet shalt thou prove  A father's dearest tenderest love  And O sweet senseless smiler envied state  As yet unconscious of thy hapless fate  When years thy judgment shall mature  And Reason shews those ills it cannot cure  Wilt thou a father's grief to asswage  For virtue prove the Phoenix of the earth  Like her thy mother dy'd to give thee birth  And be the comfort of my age  When sick and languishing I lie  Wilt thou my EMMA's wonted care supply  And oft as to thy listening ear  Thy mother's virtues and her fate I tell  Say wilt thou drop the tender tear  Whilst on the mournful theme I dwell  Then fondly stealing to thy father's side  Whene'er thou seest the soft distress  Which I would vainly seek to hide  Say wilt thou strive to make it less  To sooth my sorrows all thy cares employ  And in my cup of grief infuse one drop of joy  AN EVENING ADDRESS TO A NIGHTINGALE  BY THE SAME  SWEET bird that kindly perching near  Pourest thy plaints melodious in mine ear  Not like base worldlings tutor'd to forego  The melancholy haunts of Woe  Thanks for thy sorrowsoothing strain  For surely thou hast known to prove  Like me the pangs of hapless love  Else why so feelingly complain  And with thy piteous notes thus sadden all the grove  Say dost thou mourn thy ravish'd mate  That oft enamour'd on thy strains has hung  Or has the cruel hand of Fate  Bereft thee of thy darling young  Alas for BOTH I weep  In all the pride of youthful charms  A beauteous bride torn from my circling arms  A lovely babe that should have liv'd to bless  And fill my doating eyes with frequent tears  At once the source of rapture and distress  The flattering prop of my declining years  In vain from death to rescue I essay'd  By every art that Science could devise  Alas it languish'd for a mother's aid  And wing'd its flight to seek her in the skies  Then O our comforts be the same  At evening's peaceful hour  To shun the noisy paths of wealth and fame  And breathe our sorrows in this lonely bower  But why alas to thee complain  To theeunconscious of my pain  Soon shalt THOU cease to mourn thy lot severe  And hail the dawning of a happier year  The genial warmth of joyrenewing spring  Again shall plume thy shatter'd wing  Again thy little heart shall transport prove  Again shall slow thy notes responsive to thy love  But O for ME in vain may seasons roll  Nought can dry up the fountain of my tears  Deploring still the COMFORT OF MY SOUL  I count my sorrows by encreasing years  Tell me thou Syren Hope deceiver say  Where is the promis'd period of my woes  Full three long lingering years have roll'd away  And yet I weep a stranger to repose  O what delusion did thy tongue employ  " That EMMA's fatal pledge of love  " Her last bequestwith all a mother's care  " The bitterness of sorrow should remove  " Soften the horrors of despair  " And chear a heart long lost to joy"  How oft when fondling in mine arms  Gazing enraptur'd on its angelface  My soul the maze of Fate would vainly trace  And burn with all a father's fond alarms  And O what flattering scenes had Fancy feign'd  How did I rave of blessings yet in store  Till every aching sense was sweetly pain'd  And my full heart could bear nor tongue could utter more  " Just Heaven I cry'd"with recent hopes elate  " Yet I will livewill live tho' EMMA's dead  " So long bow'd down beneath the storms of Fate  " Yet will I raise my woedejected head  " My little EMMA now my ALL  " Will want a father's care  " Her looks her wants my rash resolves recal  " And for her sake the ills of life I'll bear  " And oft together we'll complain  " Complaint the only bliss my soul can know  " From me my child shall learn the mournful strain  " And prattle tales of woe  " And O in that auspicious hour  " When Fate resigns her persecuting power  " With duteous zeal her hand shall close  " No more to weepmy sorrowstreaming eyes  " When death gives misery repose  " And opes a glorious passage to the skies  Vain thought it must not beShe too is dead  The flattering scene is o'er  My hopes for everever fled  And vengeance can no more  Crush'd by misfortuneblasted by disease  And nonenone left to bear a friendly part  To meditate my welfare health or ease  Or sooth the anguish of an aching heart  Now all one gloomy scene till welcome death  With lenient hand O falsly deem'd severe  Shall kindly stop my griefexhausted breath  And dry up every tear  Perhaps obsequious to my will  But ah from my affections far remov'd  The last sad office strangers may fulfil  As if I ne'er had been belov'd  As if unconscious of poetic fire  I ne'er had touch'd the trembling lyre  As if my niggard hand ne'er dealt relief  Nor my heart melted at another's grief  Yetwhile this weary life shall last  While yet my tongue can form the impassion'd strain  In piteous accents shall the Muse complain  And dwell with fond delay on blessings past  For O how grateful to a wounded heart  The tale of misery to impart  From others' eyes bid artless sorrows flow  And raise esteem upon the base of woe  Even HE  Lord Lyttelton  the noblest of the tuneful throng  Shall deign my love lorn tale to hear  Shall catch the soft contagion of my song  And pay my pensive Muse the tribute of a tear  THE DEATH OF ARACHNE AN HEROICOMITRAGICPOEM  THE shrinking brooks and russet meads complain'd  That Summer's tyrant fervid Sirius reign'd  Full west the sun from heaven descending rode  And six the shadow on the dial show'd  Philo tho' young to musing much inclin'd  A shameless sloven in his gown had din'd  From table sneaking with a sheepish face  Before the circle was dismiss'd with grace  And smoaking now his desk with books o'erspread  Thick clouds of incense roll around his head  His head which save a quarter's growth of hair  His woollen cap long since scratch'd off was bare  His beard three days had grown of golden hue  Black was his shirt uncomely to the view  Crosslegg'd he sat and his ungartered hose  Of each lean limb half hide and half expose  His cheek he lean'd upon his hand below  His nutbrown slipper hung upon his toe  Now with abstracted flight he climbs apace  High and more high through pure unbounded space  Now mere privation fails the wings of thought  He drops down headlong through the vast of nought  A friendly vapour Mathesis supplies  Born on the surging smoak he joys to rise  Matter thro' modes and qualities pursues  Now caught entranc'd its naked essence views  Now wakes the vision fading from his sight  Leaves doubts behind the mists of mental night  Existing not but possible alone  He deems all substance and suspects his own  Like wave by wave impell'd now questions roll  Does soul in ought subsist or all in soul  Is space extension nothing but a name  And mere idea Nature's mighty frame  All power all forms to intellect confin'd  Place agent subject instrument combin'd  Is spirit diverse yet from number free  Conjoin'd by harmony in unity  Truth's spotless white what piercing eye descries  When the ray broken takes Opinion's dyes  In vain now Philo seeks the sacred light  In Chaos plung'd where embryo systems fight  In this dark hour unnotic'd Cloe came  His studydoor admits the shining dame  With Nature's charms she join'd the charms of art  Wife of his choice and mistress of his heart  What on her head she wore erect and high  Unnam'd above is call'd on earth a fly  In wanton ringlets her fair tresses fell  Her breasts beneath transparent muslin swell  Studded with flaming gems a buckle bound  Th' embroidered zone her slender waist around  Thence to her feet a vast rotund display'd  The mingling colours of the rich brocade  This aiding fancy blending shame and pride  Inflames with beauties it was meant to hide  With careless ease the Nymph first snapp'd her fan  Roll'd round her radiant eyes and thus began  " How canst thou Philo here delight to sit  " Immers'd in learning nastiness and wit  " Clean from the chest where various odours breathe  " And dying roses their last sweets bequeath  " A shirt for thee by my command the maid  " Three hours ago before the fire display'd  " The barber waiting to renew thy face  " Holds thy wig powder'd in the pasteboard case  " Thy silken breeches and thy hose of thread  " Coat waistcoat all lie ready on the bed  " Renounce that odious pipe this filthy cell  " Where silence dust and pagan authors dwell  " Come shall the ladies wait in vain for thee  " Come taste with us the charms of mirth and tea"  As Philo heard confus'd the silver sound  His soul emerges from the dark profound  On the bright vision full he turn'd his eyes  Touch'd as he gaz'd with pleasure and surprize  The first faint dawnings of a smile appear'd  And now in act to speak he strok'd his beard  When from a shelf just o'er the fair one's head  Down dropt ARACHNE by the viscous thread  Back starts the Nymph with terror and dismay  " The Spider oh"was all that she could say  At this the Sage resum'd the look severe  " Renounce with woman's folly woman's fear"  He said and careful to the shelf convey'd  The hapless rival of the blueey'd maid  Th' enormous deed astonish'd Cloeview'd  And rage the crimson on her cheek renew'd  " Must then said she such hideous vermin crawl  " Indulg'd protected o'er the cobwebb'd wall  " Destroy her quicklyhere her life I claim  " If not for love or decency for shame"  " Shame be to guilt replies the man of thought  " To slaves of custom ne'er by reason taught  " Who spare no life that touches not their own  " By fear their cruelty restrain'd alone  " No blameless insect lives its destin'd hour  " Caught in the murdering vortex of their power  " For me the virtues of the mind I learn  " From sage ARACHNE for whose life you burn  " From her when busy all the summer's day  " She weaves the curious woof that snares her prey  " I learn fair industry and art to prize  " Admiring Nature providently wise  " Who tho' her bounty unexhausted flows  " Not daily bread on idleness bestows  " ARACHNE still superior to despair  " Restores with art what accidents impair  " The thousandth time the broken thread renews  " And one great end with fortitude pursues  " To me her toil is ne'er renew'd in vain  " Taught what the wise by perseverance gain  " Warm'd by example to the glorious strife  " And taught to conquer in the fight of life  " When now with rest amidst her labours crown'd  " She watchful patient eyes the circle round  " I learn when toil has well deserv'd success  " Hope's placid calm expectance to possess  " With care to watch with patience still to wait  " The golden moment tho' delay'd by Fate"  Impatient Cloe thus again replied  " How soon is error thro' each veil descried  " Still boasting Reason's power how weak are we  " How blind alas to all we would not see  " Else how could Philo in a Spider's cause  " Talk thus of mercy with deserv'd applause  " Or call aught virtuous industry and skill  " Exerted only to surprize and kill  " The blameless insect whom no murder feeds  " For her the victim of her cunning bleeds  " Cunning which when to wisdom we compare  " Is but to her to men what monkeys are"  " Hold Philo cries and know the same decree  " Gave her the fly which gives the lamb to thee  " Or why those wings adapted to the snare  " Why interceptive hangs the net in air  " As plain in these the precept "kill and eat"  " As in thy skill to carve the living treat"  To this she cries "Persuade me if you can  " Man's lord of all and all was made for man"  " Vain thought the child of ignorance and pride"  " Disdainful smiling quickly he replied  " To man vain reptile tell me of what use  " Are all that Afric's peopled wastes produce  " The nameless monsters of the swarming seas  " The pigmy nations wafted on the breeze  " The happy myriads by his eyes unseen  " That bask in flowers and quicken all the green  " Why live these numbers blest in Nature's state  " Why lives this spider object of thy hate  " Why man but life in common to possess  " Wide to diffuse the stream of happiness  " Blest stream the o'erflowing of the parent mind  " Great without pride and without weakness kind"  With downcast eyes and sighs and modest air  Thus in soft sounds replied the wily fair  " This fatal subtilty thy books impart  " To baffle truth when unsustain'd by art  " For this when Cloe goes at twelve to bed  " Till three you sit in converse with the dead  " No wonder then in vain my skill's employ'd  " To prove it best that vermin be destroy'd  " But tho' you proudly triumph o'er my sex  " Joy to consute and reason but to vex  " Yet if you lov'd me to oblige your wife  " What could you less you'd take a spider's life  " Once to prevent my wishes Philo flew  " But Time that alters all has alter'd you  " Yet still unchang'd poor Cloe's love remains  " These tears my witness which your pride disdains  " These tears at once my witness and relief"  Here paus'd the fair all eloquent in grief  He who had often and alone o'erturn'd  Witlings and sophists when his fury burn'd  Now yields to love the fortress of his soul  His eyes with vengeance on ARACHNE roll  " Curs'd wretch thou poisonous quintessence of ill  " Those precious drops unpunish'd shalt thou spill"  He said and stooping from his foot he drew  Black as his purpose what was once a shoe  Now high in air the fatal heel ascends  Reason's last effort now the stroke suspends  In doubt he stoodwhen breath'd from Cloe's breast  A struggling sigh her inward grief exprest  Fir'd by the sound "Die sorceress die" he cried  And to his arm his utmost strength applied  Crush'd falls the foe one complicated wound  And the smote shelf returns a jarring sound  On Ida's top thus Venus erst prevail'd  When all the sapience of Minerva fail'd  Thus to like arts a prey as poets tell  By Juno lov'd in vain great Dido fell  And thus for ever Beauty shall controul  The saint's the sage's and the hero's soul  But Jove with hate beheld th' atrocious deed  And Vengeance follows with tremendous speed  In Philo's mind she quench'd the ray that fir'd  With love of science and with verse inspir'd  Expung'd at once the philosophic theme  All sages think and all that poets dream  Yields him thus chang'd a vassal to the fair  And forth she leads him with a victor's air  Drest to her wish he mixes with the gay  As much a trifle and as vain as they  To fix their power and rivet fast the chain  They lead where Pleasure spreads her soft domain  Where drown'd in music Reason's hoarser call  Love smiles triumphant in thy groves Vauxhall  STUDLEY  TO MISS B F  NOR Phoebus nor his tuneful choir  To notes poetic wake my string  A mortal Muse demands my lyre  O were she present while I sing  To soar aloft beyond the ken  Of human eyes let others boast  'Tis BETSY that directs my pen  My verse not seen by her were lost  No longer prate ye critics vain  That poets are not made but born  If BETSY smile upon the strain  Your censure's keenest lash I scorn  Yet were my creeping Muse to soar  Sure Reason's good might still be given  STUDLEY was Paradise before  But BETSY's presence made it heaven  O for a quill pluck'd from the eaglewing  Of bright Imagination first of Powers  Then might my earthborn Muse aspire to sing  Strains not unworthy STUDLEY's charming bowers  Come Nymph and with thee Memory kind maid  The sweet remembrancer of pleasures past  How there with BETSY hand in hand I stray'd  Ay me such pleasures were too great to last  She comes she comes enthron'd in F's eyes  She deigns to smile on such a wretch as me  Her fostering art its kindly aid supplies  And from gross film my visual nerve sets free  Conduct me Goddess to that blest retreat  In union fair where all the Graces join  Where Elegance has fix'd her bestlov'd seat  And Taste and Nature every power combine  And lo the Park first opens to the view  Mark well its verdant hills its flowery dells  Not Windsorforest nobler scenes can shew  Not Stowe where Cobham dwelt where Temple dwells  The curious eye intranc'd in wonder sees  Here gurgling streamlets tremble thro' the shade  Here nimble squirrels gambol in the trees  There bounding fawns trip wanton thro' the glade  Look back on Rippon's venerable pile  There cloistered Monks their nightly vespers sung  While thro' the solemn gloomy Gothic aile  The hollow vaults responsive echoes rung  See slopes on slopes th' enchanting prospect bound  Nor knows the dubious Fancy where to rest  New sweets invite above below around  Giddy with rapture she scarce feels she's blest  The gates fly ope Elysium stands confest  And bursts upon us in a blaze of charms  E'en such a transport throbs in Damon's breast  When yielding Chloe melts into his arms  No more ye gaudy poets deck with flowers  Your fairy gardens on the Western shore  Or add fresh bloom to fam'd Alcinous' bowers  Vain Greece thy fabled Tempe boast no more  Whate'er creation form'd or rules could frame  Refin'd or simple natural or new  Compound together Can it need a name  View STUDLEY's lawns and own the picture true  Where to begin where end the labouring soul  Lost and bewilder'd in a world of sweets  Vainly attempts at once to grasp the whole  Such various joy its various senses greets  Ambrosial scents the ravish'd smell regale  Each shrub around a balmy odour flings  Such as Arabia's spicy groves exhale  Wafted by Zephyrs on their rosy wings  The birds salute us with their artless notes  The bulfinch linnet nightingale and thrush  Wild harmony strain'd thro' a thousand throats  Trills in each tree and dies in every bush  Proud to adorn the pendent shades it laves  Seest thou that lake its heaving bosom swell  In headlong sheets pour its enamour'd waves  Amidst such beauties well content to dwell  But other waves to other waves succeed  Coursing each other to the seat they love  With eager haste they glide along the mead  And murmuring struggle thro' the grot above  Retir'd from publick haunt one  The Banquetinghouse  structure stands  Sacred to Comus and his festive train  Where genial Freedom unrestrain'd commands  Where none are strangers deem'd but Care and Pain  All elegance and ease without within  They bid defiance to the frowns of Fate  Nor care what man goes out or who comes in  Whirl'd in the topsyturvy wheel of state  Climb we yon lofty summit crown'd with wood  The quivering poplar the widebranching oak  The taper fir the ash for all things good  Long may they long defy the woodman's stroke  Here rest we thenand each way turn our eyes  No where our eyes an empty chasm can find  Domes temples obelisks at each point arise  We half forget the wonders left behind  Objects at every point our sight invade  Yet the keen judgment finds not where to chide  AISLABIE still calls Nature to his aid  Nor makes a sacrifice of sense to pride  But can we then that ruined reverend  Fountain's Abbey  tower  Leave undistinguish'd 'midst the common throng  There many a hoary devotee of yore  Awak'd the skylark with his early song  What tho' the lazy bat and screech owl dire  Reign sole possessors of the gloomy fane  Souls once were there in whom poetic fire  Beat in each pulse and glow'd in every vein  Observe its mouldering base and mossgrown head  Threaten its final dissolution nigh  To man what better lesson can be read  What moralist can better teach to die  Ah let us ere the fatal die be cast  Think well for surely one day think we must  That stately STUDLEY's pride must fall at last  And lovely BETSY's form submit to dust  ANODE  BY SL JN L L D  STERN Winter now by Spring repress'd  Forbears the longcontinued strife  And Nature on her naked breast  Delights to catch the gales of Life  Now o'er the rural kingdom roves  Soft Pleasure with her laughing train  Love warbles in the vocal groves  And Vegetation plants the plain  Unhappy whom to beds of pain  The author being ill of the gout  Arthritic Tyranny consigns  Whom smiling Nature courts in vain  Tho' Rapture sings and Beauty shines  Yet tho' my limbs Disease invades  Her wings Imagination tries  And bears me to the peaceful shades  Where's humble turrets rise  Here stop my Soul thy rapid flight  Nor from the pleasing groves depart  Where first great Nature charm'd my sight  Where Wisdom first inform'd my heart  Here let me thro' the vales pursue  A guide a father and a friend  Once more great Nature's work renew  Once more on Wisdom's voice attend  From false caresses causeless strife  Wild hope vain fear alike remov'd  Here let me learn the use of life  When best enjoy'd when most improv'd  Teach me thou venerable bower  Cool Meditation's quiet seat  The generous scorn of venal power  The silent grandeur of retreat  When Pride by guilt to greatness climbs  Or raging Factions rush to war  Here let me learn to shun the crimes  I can't prevent and will not share  But lest I fall by subtler foes  Bright Wisdom teach me Curio's art  The swelling passions to compose  And quell the rebels of the heart  THE MIDSUMMER WISH  BY THE SAME  O Phoebus down the western sky  Far hence diffuse thy burning ray  Thy light to distant worlds supply  And wake them to the cares of day  Come gentle Eve the friend of Care  Come Cynthia lovely queen of night  Refresh me with a cooling breeze  And chear me with a lambent light  Lay me where o'er the verdant ground  Her living carpet Nature spreads  Where the green bower with roses crown'd  In showers its fragrant foliage sheds  Improve the peaceful hour with wine  Let music die along the grove  Around the bowl let myrtles twine  And every strain be tun'd to Love  Come STELLA queen of all my heart  Come born to fill its vast desires  Thy looks perpetual joys impart  Thy voice perpetual love inspires  While all my wish and thine complete  By turns we languish and we burn  Let sighing gales our sighs repeat  Our murmurs murmuring brooks return  Let me when Nature calls to rest  And blushing skies the morn foretell  Sink on the down of STELLA's breast  And bid the waking world farewell  AUTUMN AN ODE  BY THE SAME  ALAS with swift and silent pace  Impatient Time rolls on the year  The Seasons change and Nature's face  Now sweetly smiles now frowns severe  'Twas Spring 'twas Summer all was gay  Now Autumn bends a cloudy brow  The flowers of Spring are swept away  And Summer fruits desert the bough  The verdant leaves that play'd on high  And wanton'd on the western breeze  Now trod in dust neglected lie  As Boreas strips the bending trees  The fields that wav'd with golden grain  As russet heaths are wild and bare  Not moist with dew but drench'd in rain  Nor Health nor Pleasure wanders there  No more while thro' the midnight shade  Beneath the moon's pale orb I stray  Soft pleasing woes my heart invade  As Progne pours the melting lay  From this capricious clime she soars  O would some God but wings supply  To where each morn the Spring restores  Companion of her flight I'd fly  Vain wish me Fate compels to bear  The downward Season's iron reign  Compels to breathe polluted air  And shiver on a blasted plain  What bliss to life can Autumn yield  If glooms and showers and storms prevail  And Ceres flies the naked field  And flowers and fruits and Phoebus fail  Oh what remains what lingers yet  To cheer me in the darkening hour  The Grape remains the friend of Wit  In Love and Mirth of mighty power  Haste press the clusters fill the bowl  Apollo shoot thy parting ray  This gives the sunshine of the soul  This God of Health and Verse and Day  Still still the jocund strain shall flow  The pulse with vigorous rapture beat  My STELLA with new charms shall glow  And every bliss in wine shall meet  WINTER AN ODE  BY THE SAME  NO more the morn with tepid rays  Unfolds the flower of various hue  Noon spreads no more the genial blaze  Nor gentle eve distills the dew  The lingering hours prolong the night  Usurping Darkness shares the day  Her mists restrain the force of light  And Phoebus holds a doubtful sway  By gloomy twilight half reveal'd  With sighs we view the hoary hill  The leafless wood the naked field  The snowtopt cott the frozen rill  No music warbles thro' the grove  No vivid colours paint the plain  No more with devious steps I rove  Thro' verdant paths now sought in vain  Aloud the driving tempest roars  Congeal'd impetuous showers descend  Haste close the window bar the doors  Fate leaves me STELLA and a friend  In Nature's aid let Art supply  With light and heat my little sphere  Rouze rouze the fire and pile it high  Light up a constellation here  Let Music sound the voice of joy  Or Mirth repeat the jocund tale  Let Love his wanton wiles employ  And o'er the Season Wine prevail  Yet Time Life's dreary Winter brings  When Mirth's gay tale shall please no more  Nor Music charm tho' STELLA sings  Nor Love nor Wine the Spring restore  Catch then O catch the transient hour  Improve each moment as it flies  Life's a short Summer man a flower  He dies alas how soon he dies  THE WINTER's WALK  BY THE SAME  BEHOLD my fair where'er we rove  What dreary prospects round us rise  The naked hill the leafless grove  The hoary ground the frowning skies  Nor only thought the wasted plain  Stern Winter in thy force confess'd  Still wider spreads thy horrid reign  I feel thy power usurp my breast  Enlivening Hope and fond Desire  Resign the heart to Spleen and Care  Scarce frighted Love maintains her fire  And Rapture saddens to Despair  In groundless hope and causeless fear  Unhappy man behold thy doom  Still changing with the changeful year  The slave of sunshine and of gloom  Tir'd with vain joys and false alarms  With mental and corporeal strife  Snatch me my STELLA to thy arms  And screen me from the ills of Life  A SONG  BY THE SAME  NOT the soft sighs of vernal gales  The fragrance of the flowery vales  The murmurs of the chrystal rill  The vocal grove the verdant hill  Not all their charms tho' all unite  Can touch my bosom with delight  Not all the gems on India's shore  Not all Peru's unbounded store  Not all the power nor all the fame  That heroes kings or poets claim  Nor knowledge which the learn'd approve  To form one wish my soul can move  Yet Nature's charms allure my eyes  And knowledge wealth and fame I prize  Fame wealth and knowledge I obtain  Nor seek I Nature's charms in vain  In lovely STELLA all combine  And lovely STELLA thou art mine  AN EVENING ODE  TO STELLA  BY THE SAME  EVENING now from purple wings  Sheds the grateful gifts she brings  Brilliant drops bedeck the mead  Cooling breezes shake the reed  Shake the reed and curl the stream  Silver'd o'er with Cynthia's beam  Near the checquer'd lonely grove  Hears and keeps thy secrets Love  STELLA thither let us stray I  Lightly o'er the dewy way  Phoebus drives his burning car  Hence my lovely STELLA far  In his stead the Queen of night  Round us pours a lambent light  Light that serves but just to shew  Breasts that beat and cheeks that glow  Let us now in whisper'd joy  Evening's silent hours employ  Silence best and conscious shades  Please the hearts that Love invades  Other pleasures give them pain  Lovers all but Love disdain  THE NATURAL BEAUTY  TO STELLA  BY THE SAME  WHETHER STELLA's eyes are found  Fix'd on earth or glancing round  If her face with pleasure glow  If she sigh at others woe  If her easy air express  Conscious worth or soft distress  STELLA's eyes and air and face  Charm with undiminish'd grace  If on her we see display'd  Pendant gems and rich brocade  If her chintz with less expence  Flows in easy negligence  Still she lights the conscious flame  Still her charms appear the same  If she strikes the vocal strings  If she's silent speaks or sings  If she sit or if she move  Still we love and still approve  Vain the casual transient glance  Which alone can please by chance  Beauty which depends on art  Changing with the changing heart  Which demands the toilet's aid  Pendant gems and rich brocade  I those charms alone can prize  Which from constant Nature rise  Which nor circumstance nor dress  E'er can make or more or less  THE VANITY OF WEALTH AN ODE  BY THE SAME  NO more thus brooding o'er yon heap  With Avarice painful vigils keep  Still unenjoy'd the present store  Still endless sighs are breath'd for more  O quit the shadow catch the prize  Which not all India's treasure buys  To purchase Heaven has gold the power  Can gold remove the mortal hour  In life can Love be bought with gold  Are Friendship's pleasures to be sold  Noall that's worth a wish a thought  Fair Virtue gives unbrib'd unbought  Cease then on trash thy hopes to bind  Let nobler views engage thy mind  With Science tread the wonderous way  Or learn the Muse's moral lay  In social hours indulge thy soul  Where Mirth and Temperance mix the bowl  To virtuous Love resign thy breast  And be by blessing Beauty blest  Thus taste the feast by Nature spread  Ere Youth and all its joys are fled  Come taste with me the balm of life  Secure from pomp and wealth and strife  I boast whate'er for man was meant  In health and STELLA and content  And scorn oh let that scorn be thine  Mere things of clay that dig the mine  TO MISS ON HER GIVING THE AUTHOR A GOLD AND SILK NETWORK PURSE OF HER OWN WEAVING  BY THE SAME  THOUGH gold and silk their charms unite  To make thy curious web delight  In vain the varied work would shine  If wrought by any hand but thine  Thy hand that knows the subtler art  To weave those nets that catch the heart  Spread out by me the roving coin  Thy nets may catch but not confine  Nor can I hope thy silken chain  The glittering vagrants shall restrain  Why SYLVIA was it then decreed  The heart once caught should ne'er be freed  A TRANSLATION OF THE LATIN EPITAPH ON SIR THOMAS HANMER  BY THE SAME  THOU who survey'st these walls with curious eye  Pause at this tomb where HANMER's ashes lie  His various worth through varied life attend  And learn his virtues while thou mourn'st his end  His force of genius burn'd in early youth  With thirst of knowledge and with love of truth  His learning join'd with each endearing art  Charm'd every ear and gain'd on every heart  Thus early wise the endanger'd realm to aid  His country call'd him from the studious shade  In life's first bloom his publick toils began  At once commenc'd the Senator and Man  In business dextrous weighty in debate  Thrice ten long years he labour'd for the state  In every speech persuasive Wisdom flow'd  In every act refulgent Virtue glow'd  Suspended Faction ceas'd from rage and strife  To hear his eloquence and praise his life  Resistless merit fix'd the Senate's choice  Who hail'd him Speaker with united voice  Illustrious Age how bright thy glories shone  When HANMER fill'd the chair and ANNE the throne  Then when dark arts obscur'd each fierce debate  When mutual frauds perplex'd the maze of state  The moderator firmly mild appear'd  Beheld with love with veneration heard  This task perform'd he sought no gainful post  Nor wish'd to glitter at his country's cost  Strict on the right he fix'd his stedfast eye  With temperate zeal and wise anxiety  Nor e'er from Virtue's path was lur'd aside  To pluck the flowers of Pleasure or of Pride  Her gifts despis'd Corruption blush'd and fled  And Fame pursu'd him where Conviction led  Age call'd at length his active mind to rest  With honour sated and with cares opprest  To letter'd ease retir'd and honest mirth  To rural grandeur and domestic worth  Delighted still to please mankind or mend  The Patriot's fire yet sparkled in the Friend  Calm Conscience then his former life survey'd  And recollected toils endear'd the shade  Till Nature call'd him to the general doom  And Virtue's sorrow dignify'd his tomb  TO MISS ON HER PLAYING UPON THE HARPSICORD IN A ROOM HUNG WITH SOME FLOWERPIECES OF HER OWN PAINTING  BY THE SAME  WHEN STELLA strikes the tuneful string  In scenes of imitated Spring  Where Beauty lavishes her powers  On beds of neverfading flowers  And Pleasure propagates around  Each charm of modulated sound  Ah think not in the dangerous hour  The Nymph fictitious as the flower  But shun rash youth the gay alcove  Nor tempt the snares of wily love  When charms thus press on every sense  What thought of flight or of defence  Deceitful Hope and vain Desire  For ever flutter o'er her lyre  Delighting as the youth draws nigh  To point the glances of her eye  And forming with unerring art  New chains to hold the captive heart  But on these regions of delight  Might Truth intrude with daring flight  Could STELLA sprightly fair and young  One moment hear the moral song  Instruction with her flowers might spring  And Wisdom warble from her string  Mark when from thousand mingled dyes  Thou seest one pleasing form arise  How active light and thoughtful shade  In greater scenes each other aid  Mark when the different notes agree  In friendly contrariety  How Passion's wellaccorded strife  Gives all the harmony of life  Thy pictures shall thy conduct frame  Consistent still though not the same  Thy musick teach the nobler art  To tune the regulated heart  TO MYRTILIS THE NEW YEAR'S OFFERING  MADAM  LONG have I look'd my tablets o'er  And find I've much to thank you for  Outstanding debts beyond account  And newwho knows to what amount  Tho' small my wealth not small my soul  Come then at once I'll pay the whole  Ye Powers I'm rich and will command  The host of slaves that round me stand  Come Indian quick disclose thy store  And hither bring Peruvian ore  Let yonder negroe pierce the main  The choicest largest pearl to gain  Let all my slaves their arts combine  To make the blushing ruby mine  From eastern thrones the diamonds bear  To sparkle at her breast and ear  Swift Scythian point th' unerring dart  That strikes the Ermine's little heart  And search for choicest furs the globe  To make my MYRTILIS a robe  Ah no Yon Indian will not go  No Scythian deigns to bend his bow  No sullen Negroe shoots the flood  How slavesOr am I understood  All all my empty power disown  I turn and find myself alone  'Tis Fancy's vain illusion all  Nor Moor nor Scythian waits my call  Call I command can I consign  Alas what earthly thing is mine  Come then my Muse companion dear  Of poverty and soul sincere  Come dictate to my grateful mind  A gift that may acceptance find  Come gentle Muse and with thee bear  An offering worthy thee and her  And tho' thy presents be but poor  My MYRTILIS will ask no more  An heart that scorns a shameful thing  With love and verse is all I bring  Of love and verse the gift receive  'Tis all thy servant has to give  If all whate'er my verse has told  Golconda's gems and Afric's gold  If all were mine from pole to pole  How large her share who shares my soul  But more than these may Heaven impart  Be thine the treasures of the heart  Be calm and glad thy future days  With Virtue's peace and Virtue's praise  Let jealous Pride and sleepless Care  And wasting Grief and black Despair  And languor chill and Anguish fell  For ever shun thy grove and cell  There only may the happy train  Of Love and Joy and Peace remain  May Plenty with exhaustless store  Employ thy hand to feed the poor  And ever on thy honour'd head  The prayer of Gratitude be shed  A happy mother may'st thou see  Thy smiling virtuous progeny  Whose sportful tricks and airy play  Fraternal love and prattle gay  Or wonderous tale or joyful song  May lure the lingering hours along  Till Death arrive unselt unseen  With gentle pace and placid mien  And waft thee to that happy shore  Where wishes can have place no more  THE THREE WARNINGS A TALE  BY MRS THRALE  THE tree of deepest root is found  Least willing still to quit the ground  'Twas therefore said by antient sages  That love of life increas'd with years  So much that in our latter stages  When pains grow sharp and sickness rages  The greatest love of life appears  This great affection to believe  Which all confess but few perceive  If old assertions can't prevail  Be pleas'd to hear a modern tale  When sports went round and all were gay  On neighbour Dobson's weddingday  Death call'd aside the jocund groom  With him into another room  And looking grave "You must says he  " Quit your sweet bride and come with me"  " With you and quit my Susan's side  " With you the hapless husband cry'd  " Young as I am 'tis monstrous hard  " Besides in truth I'm not prepar'd  " My thoughts on other matters go  " This is my weddingnight you know"  What more he urg'd I have not heard  His reasons could not well be stronger  So Death the poor delinquent spar'd  And left to live a little longer  Yet calling up a serious look  His hourglass trembled while he spoke  " Neighbour he said farewell No more  " Shall Death disturb your mirthful hour  " And further to avoid all blame  " Of cruelty upon my name  " To give you time for preparation  " And fit you for your future station  " Three several Warnings you shall have  " Before you're summon'd to the grave  " Willing for once I'll quit my prey  " And grant a kind reprieve  " In hopes you'll have no more to say  " But when I call again this way  " Wellpleas'd the world will leave"  To these conditions both consented  And parted perfectly contented  What next the hero of our tale befell  How long he liv'd how wise how well  How roundly he pursu'd his course  And smok'd his pipe and strok'd his horse  The willing Muse shall tell  He chaffer'd then he bought he sold  Nor once perceiv'd his growing old  Nor thought of Death as near  His friends not false his wife no shrew  Many his gains his children few  He pass'd his hours in peace  But while he view'd his wealth increase  While thus along Life's dusty road  The beaten track content he trod  Old Time whose haste no mortal spares  Uncall'd unheeded unawares  Brought on his eightieth year  And now one night in musing mood  As all alone he sate  Th' unwelcome messenger of Fate  Once more before him stood  Half kill'd with anger and surprize  " So soon return'd old Dobson cries"  " So soon d'ye call it Death replies  " Surely my friend you're but in jest  " Since I was here before  " 'Tis sixandthirty years at least  " And you are now fourscore"  " So much the worse the Clown rejoin'd  " To spare the aged would be kind  " However see your search be legal  " And your authorityIs't regal  " Else you are come on a fool's errand  " With but a ecretary's warrant  " Besides you promis'd me Three Warnings  " Which I have look'd for nights and mornings  " But for that loss of time and ease  " I can recover damages"  " I know cries Death that at the best  " I seldom am a welcome guest  " But don't be captious friend at least  " I little thought you'd still be able  " To stump about your farm and stable  " Your years have run to a great length  " I wish you joy tho' of your strength"  " Hold says the Farmer not so fast  " I have been lame these four years past"  " And no great wonder Death replies  " However you still keep your eyes  " And sure to see one's loves and friends  " For legs and arms would make amends"  " Perhaps says Dobson so it might  " But latterly I've lost my sight"  " This is a shocking story faith  " Yet there's some comfort still says Death  " Each strives your sadness to amuse  " I warrant you hear all the news"  " There's none cries he and if there were  " I'm grown so deaf I could not hear"  " Nay then the spectre stern rejoin'd  " These are unjustifiable yearnings  " If you are lame and deaf and blind  " You've had your three sufficient Warnings  " So come along no more we'll part"  He said and touch'd him with his dart  And now old Dobson turning pale  Yields to his fateso ends my tale  THE EXCURSION  HAPPY thrice the harmless swain  Tenant of the peaceful plain  Far from business noise and strife  Blest with every sweet of life  Far from all the toil of state  All oppressions of the great  D  cing blythe his Nymph he leads  O'er the carpet of the meads  While his neighbour's pipe or horn  Lulls the night or cheers the morn  Healthy joy from labour springs  Healthy joy the wish of kings  Here Providence in bounty flows  And joys on every sense bestows  Here Earth affords her kind increase  With virtue gain'd enjoy'd in peace  The harvest rich the fruitage fair  Repay the cultivator's care  Hills where sportive lambkins stray  Flocks that fleecy tribute pay  Crystal streams whose murmuring rills  Stray between the flowery hills  Meeting from a hundred dells  Till the foaming river swells  Swells beyond restraint and laves  Happy lands with welcome waves  While the crystal of the floods  Mocks the waving of the woods  Here flowers in sweet confusion strown  O'er the verdant mead are blown  Narcissus near the rivers fair  Smiles at itself reflected there  Sad emblem of that lover's pride  Who for himself too fondly died  The crowfoot here with golden hue  The cowslips sweet the violets blue  The blushing pinks and lilies pale  Like virgins fair like virgins frail  Soft daffodils of early bloom  And daisies earful of the gloom  But ah those beauties soon must fall  The ruthless scythe which levels all  Must sweep their harmless sweets away  And give their colours to decay  Here lofty groves invade the sky  And all the tempest's rage defy  The solid oak that awes the main  The spreading elm of coarser grain  The elastic eugh whose distant wound  With England's rivals heap'd the ground  The stubborn holly rough and bold  That spreads her verdure to the cold  And boasts her berries fair and ripe  Beneath December's icy gripe  All all Destruction's power shall feel  And fall before the fatal steel  See this ye fair ye wise ye brave  And sink together in the grave  The squirrel climbs the nuttree bough  And strips the clusters as they grow  The little mouse with humbler hope  Tastes Nature's bounties as they drop  See all the feather'd warblers sing  To welcome the returning spring  The blackbird linnet finch and thrush  Pour out their songs from every bush  The tuneful lark whose towering flight  Fatigues the disappointed sight  These little songsters mounted high  Harmonious carrol to the sky  To heaven their tuneful offering pay  And seem to hail the newborn day  Sweet bird instructed by thy lays  Can man forget his Maker's praise  Reviving from the shades of night  Can he behold the allquickening light  Can he unclose his fluggish eyes  Nor send one rapture to the skies  At eve in softly mournful strains  The lovelorn nightingale complains  While as it strains its little throat  Pleas'd Echo dwells on every note  And sighs to hear the plaintive moan  And grief expressive of her own  How blest my soul how blest are those  Who pass a life in such repose  Who still in rural shades abide  Where all their hours thus smoothly glide  Whose humble aims no higher tend  Than to enjoy a book and friend  Whom anxious projects ne'er molest  Nor war nor love disturb their rest  Who form no wish of rising higher  But learn betimes to check desire  Whose happy and yet humble state  Provokes no threatening frowns of Fate  So humble shrubs in safety grow  When storms the lofty pine o'erthrow  O hear ye Powers a suppliant's voice  Indulge my wish approve my choice  O grant me wheresoe'er ye please  A life of privacy and ease  No more those pleasures to pursue  Which Fancy paints to Folly's view  Nor falsly fond nor idly gay  To waste the fashionable day  No more with craving heart to go  From toy to toy from show to show  All day to counterfeit delight  And long to end the cheat for night  Afford me pleasures more serene  Give me to range the sylvan scene  Where Ceres' fullear'd sheaves abound  And Flora paints th' enamel'd ground  To feel from every pressure free  The joys of Truth and Poetry  Let Contemplation string my lyre  And Zeal supply poetic fire  Then let me Nature's wonders sing  And praise the power of Nature's King  While as by chance I turn my sight  New objects strike with new delight  Till fresh ideas hourly spring  And urge Imagination's wing  Here Knowledge quicken'd by Delight  Shall rouse the soul to vigorous flight  Rapt with the thought methinks I rise  To meditate my kindred skies  At once the past and present view  Compare the former with the new  Survey the world from pole to pole  Join clime to clime and grasp the whole  To each effect the cause conjoin  And trace the Original divine  Awaken'd Hope directs my way  Thro' all the spacious realms of day  Views the resplendent courts above  Blest mansion of seraphic love  Refulgent throne of power divine  Where calm celestial splendors shine  Whence beams of emanating light  From Nature chase retiring night  Quick to my breast new beauties rise  I pant to range my native skies  But here encumber'd with her clay  My Soul must wait the final day  And now but short excursions make  And joys thro' long perspectives take  Such joys as virtuous souls improve  And heighten wonder into love  Then fill'd with reverence and delight  Back to the world I take my flight  Back to my much lov'd groves again  Where honest joys alternate reign  Where thro' Creation's mighty round  Unnumber'd miracles abound  And form'd instruction to convey  The Almighty Father's power display  Amaz'd I view the splendid dye  Of this enamel'd butterfly  Amaz'd each reptile insect see  Each blest with life as well as we  Wherever we direct our eyes  Ten thousand various forms arise  On each a life of different mode  By boundless Providence bestow'd  From small to less from high to higher  Till Reason Sense and Fancy tire  While all in due proportion shine  To prove the economy divine  With serious joy the enlighten'd soul  Surveys a part admires the whole  Nor always silently surveys  But fir'd by gratitude to praise  In holy confidence is blest  And calmly waits eternal rest  ALEXIS A PASTORAL BALLAD  IN TWO PARTS  BY A LADY  ALEXIS the pride of the plain  Beside a clear brook lay reclin'd  His complaint was fair Daphne's disdain  Who had prov'd to the shepherd unkind  His flock was no longer his care  His pipe now no longer could please  He neglected his dress and his hair  And by solitude fed his disease  " Poor shepherd he wildly exclaim'd  " Alas what avails all thy moan  " The joys thy fond fancy had fram'd  " With Daphne for ever are flown  " How could you O Daphne deceive  " A swain not unworthy your love  " Why didst thou Alexis believe  " Such a maid could thy passion approve  " Her form is replete with each grace  " The diamond beams forth in her eye  " The lily expands o'er her face  " And the rosebud imparts its soft dye  " No warbler can rival her song  " Philomela with envy complains  " The streams glide in silence along  " The glad Zephyrs diffuse her soft strains  " When Daphne appear'd in the mead  " Her presence enliven'd the morn  " Now the winds roughly blow round my head  " And the sun's chearful beams are withdrawn  " No longer these meadows look green  " Now the warblers abandon the grove  " The air breathes no longer serene  " All Summer is fled with my love  " Oh Daphne you heard my fond sighs  " You did not my passion disdain  " When I gaz'd with delight on your eyes  " My soft glances you did not restrain  " But now you make sport of my woes  " And laugh at the sufferings I feel  " I enjoy not the sweets of repose  " Nor can I my torments conceal  " Farewell ye sad scenes of my love  " I shall never revisit you more  " Adieu to the mead an he grove  " 'Twas here I first learn'd to adore  " I will banish this wretch from her sight  " I know not what fate may ensue  " Never more can I taste of delight  " To every enjoyment adieu"  PART THE SECOND  WITH a torrent of heartbursting grief  Alexis continues his moan  Tears gave him some little relief  Yet he ceas'd not to sigh and to groan  Pastora by chance hasten'd by  She saw the poor shepherd's despair  Soft pity appear'd in her eye  She ask'd him the source of his care  " What cause has Alexis to weep"  With looks of compassion she said  " Have you lost e'er a lamb or a sheep  " Or is Tray the poor favourite dead  " Or perhaps your fair Daphne's unkind  " Perhaps for her coyness you grieve  " Ah 'tis jealousy poisons your mind  " But appearances often deceive"  The shepherd just rais'd up his head  He thank'd the kind maid for her care  He confess'd that all comfort was fled  And nothing was left but despair  Pastora e'en wept at the tale  And wish'd she could ease his distress  Could her interest with Daphne prevail  His suffering should soon find redress  He gaz'd on the fair with surprize  And admir'd the goodnature she shew'd  When she went he withdrew not his eyes  But with pleasure her footsteps pursu'd  Her sweetness her beauty and truth  With Daphne's late falshood compar'd  So charm'd so astonish'd the youth  That his heart for a change was prepar'd  Yet still his fond wish would arise  " Ah was but my Daphne thus kind  " I would wipe off these tears from my eyes  " And give up my sighs to the wind"  He said and arose from the ground  Then instant return'd to his cot  Soon in sleep every suffering was drown'd  And Daphne's unkindness forgot  With the sun the next morn he arose  Pastora he sought in the grove  He repeated the tale of his woes  And mourn'd the sad fate of his love  Pastora heard every complaint  Again he imparted his grief  He talk'd without fear or constraint  And found from her converse relief  The friendship he felt for the fair  Each meeting still serv'd to improve  He then blest his late cause of despair  And became a true votary to Love  'Twas no longer for beauty he sigh'd  He no longer to merit was blind  'Twas his joy and a laudable pride  That he valu'd the charms of the mind  Pastora with blushes confest  That she felt all the force of true love  But that reason her passion supprest  Yet that now she must own and approve  She soon gave her hand to the swain  Who proclaim'd to each shepherd this truth  He had met a reward for his pain  More lasting than beauty and youth  When Spring decks with verdure the mead  Love wafts milder fragrance around  When Summer invites to the shade  Love strews with fresh flowrets the ground  In Autumn thro' cornfields they rove  And their loves as in Springtime appear  Tho' Winter disrobes the known grove  Yet their love varies not with the year  Ye Nymphs to this maxim attend  Tho' beauty awhile may allure  Yet to fix in the lover the friend  'Tis virtue alone is secure  Ye Swains who are caught by a face  Know that beauty will quickly decay  That virtue still heightens each grace  And imparts more than Time steals away  SONNET TO A ROBINREDBREAST  BY MISS MO  DEAR social bird that oft with fearless love  Giv'st thy soft form to man's protective care  Pleas'd when rude tempests vex the ruffled air  For the warm roof to leave the naked grove  Kindest and last of Summer's tuneful train  Ah do not yet give o'er thy plaintive lay  But charm mild Zephyr to a longer stay  And oft renew thy sweetlyparting strain  So when rough Winter frowns with brow severe  And chilling blasts shall strip the sheltering trees  When meagre Want that shivering frame shall seize  And Death with dart uplifted hover near  My grateful hand the liberal crumbs shall give  My bosom warm thee and my kiss revive  ODE TO CONTENT  BY J C  CONTENT who oft art wont to dwell  Deep in the solitary dell  Near shady wood or limpid rill  Or on the side of some hoar hill  Attendant on the shepherd swain  Thou cheer'st his labours on the plain  With thee he pleas'd pursues his toils  Nor heeds fierce suns nor stubborn soils  Thee oft I met in Hertford's vale  What time the tuneful nightingale  Recited sweet her solemn song  The beeches and the oaks among  Upon the banks of Lee reclin'd  Thy visits sooth'd my pensive mind  And drove corroding pain away  And made the rural landscape gay  How verdant then appear'd the trees  How grateful was the western breeze  How sweet the scent of opening flowers  How fair the hedges and the bowers  How bright the sun's enlivening beam  How soft the murmurs of the stream  Adieu lov'd vale adieu smooth stream  Yet still CONTENT be thou my theme  'Tis thee sweet maid I wooe again  Attend thy constant lover's strain  Wheree'er 'tis his the lot to stray  O deign with him to take thy way  ODE TO SOLITUDE  BY THE SAME  HAIL silent matron ever hail  Thou lover of the wood or vale  When musing near yon aged tree  The votive song has flow'd to thee  Nor thou despise my numbers rude  Serious caelestial SOLITUDE  Oft in the still retired dell  Thou hear'st the solemn funeral bell  Or where the Ascetic's cottage stands  'Midst cheerless wastes and arid lands  Oft in the forest's umbrage deep  Thou yet art seen to sit and weep  For frequent falls thy tender tear  O'er Youth's cold grave or Beauty's bier  Teach me that Life's momentary day  However various or how gay  Is transient as the odorous flower  That blooms and withers in an hour  Teach me to aid the suppliant poor  Nor turn the pilgrim from my door  For others woes still prompt the sigh  O parent of Humanity  Accept these numbers wild and rude  Caelestial matron SOLITUDE  ODE TO HEALTH  BY THE SAME  NYMPH that flies the crowded street  And the proud lord's pompous seat  Now a Naïad of the wood  Now a Dryad of the flood  Ever blythe and young and gay  HEALTH accept the unpolish'd lay  Not the shade of spreading trees  Nor the cooling fragrant breeze  Nor the lov'd approach of morn  Nor the walk through waving corn  Nor the blackbird's serenade  Echoing from the distant shade  Nor the gifts of Summer's hand  Flowrets fair or odours bland  Or each cheerful rural sight  Yield or pleasure or delight  To the wretch that sighs for thee  Sighs for Health and Liberty  Nor disdain alllovely Fair  Thy everfervent suppliant's prayer  From some distant region haste  Norway's hills or Russia's waste  From Montpelier's vineyards wide  Or from Tajo's sunny side  Or Bermuda's western isle  Where eternal summers smile  'Midst our country deign to stray  Come and make our Britain gay  EPITAPH ON A SCHOOLFELLOW  BY THE SAME  LOV'D BANKS for thee I heave the frequent sigh  For thee the solemn tear bedews mine eye  No more thy converse blythe shall cheer my day  Or chase the gloom of anxious thought away  And art thou dear associate art thou gone  Long must thy friend his sudden loss bemoan  O'er the cold turf where thy pale reliques sleep  Shall fond Remembrance oft repair to weep  SONNET  BY THE SAME  OCCASIONED BY LEAVING BRN JULY THE AUTHOR TELLING THE LADIES "HE LOOKED UPON HIMSELF IN A WORSE SITUATION THAN ADAM BANISH'D PARADISE" WAS ENJOINED BY THEM TO EXPRESS THE SAME IN RHIME  WHEN our first Father thro' the dreary waste  From Eden's plains an exile sad must go  Oft he recall'd each scene of pleasure past  Felt the dire change and bade his sorrows flow  Yet still a sweet companion of his woe  With soft assiduous care attended near  Fond to relieve and resolute to show  The soothing smile or sympathizing tear  Far happier doom alas attends me here  Who leave of Nymphs so fair a train behind  Nor one is found the tedious way to chear  Or raise with converse sweet the drooping mind  Then tell me fair ones can I chuse but grieve  Who quit my Paradise without an EVE  ODE  THE charms which blooming Beauty shows  From faces heavenly fair  W to the lily and the rose  With semblance apt compare  With semblance apt for ah how soon  How soon they all decay  The lily droops the rose is gone  And beauty fades away  But when bright Virtue shines confess'd  With sweet Discretion join'd  When Mildness calms the peaceful breast  And Wisdom guides the mind  When charms like these dear Maid conspire  Thy person to approve  They kindle generous chaste desire  And everlasting love  Beyond the reach of Time or Fate  These graces shall endure  Still like the passion they create  Eternal constant pure  SONNET ON ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT  BY J S  BOAST not your state slaves of despotic sway  Where wanton Gallia 'midst her vineclad hills  Her olive bowers her myrtleshaded rills  Her mild air's fan her genial sun's survey  Nor ye where Asia like a queen sits gay  'Midst her rich groves where odorous balm distils  And the charm'd eye th' Elysian landscape fills  And hand in hand young Spring and Autumn play  Each boon to you your haughty lords deny  And at their will your frail lives you resign  Behold and 'midst your flowery scenes repine  Under bleak Albion's cloudenvelop'd sky  Her meanest sons secure enjoy their own  And bow to Heaven and Liberty alone  INSCRIPTION FOR A ROOTHOUSE  FOND man retire to this still cell  And bid the busy world farewel  Here seek the cherub Happiness  Who loves the quiet lone recess  And shuns the city's noisy scene  For pleasures tranquil and serene  How solemn is the oak's broad shade  The naked grove seen thro' the glade  The rock that high projects its steep  The distant prospect of the deep  Fond man here cheerful may'st thou spend  Thy swiftwing'd life nor fear thy end  Stealing thro' life as thro' the plain  Yon rill in murmurs seeks the main  Here when the saffronvested dawn  Spreads radiance o'er the dewy lawn  For hours exempt from woe and sin  Thy ardent orison begin  Here too at eve His praise display  Who led thee thro' the finish'd day  PROLOGUE  This Prologue and Epilogue were spoken by two young Gentlemen who performed some scenes from Shakespeare Moliere Zenobia and the Mayor of Garratt before the earl of Chesterfield their particular friend and patron and a private party of other noble and illustrious friends    BY A MURPHY ESQ  AS a young bird as yet unus'd to fly  On wings expanded thro' the liquid sky  With doubt and fear his first excursions tries  And shivers every feather with surprise  So various flutterings in our bosoms play  Eager yet anxious for our first essay  New to the world its vanity and care  And all the ills to which the flesh is heir  Two mischiefs we are told ordain'd by Fate  Twin at our birth and all our footsteps wait  Some by fierce Passion headlong down are thrown  And Ridicule marks others for her own  To steer thro' both by some unerring rule  This day we study in the Muse's school  To shun the first we look in Shakespeare's page  And THERE observe how the fell Passions rage  THERE mark the bounds of good and ill defin'd  And  Wisdom's jesses  once thrown off the mind  How every virtue is  let down the wind  Should we avoid on this dread rock to split  Thenfree from folly the true point to hit  Moliere instructs us with his comic wit  He of right manners doth the rule dispense  The lawgiver of decency and sense  This is our plan our growing minds to rear  Your kind applause will bid us persevere  EPILOGUE  BY D GARRICK ESQ  WHATE'ER you think good sirs in this agree  That we at least have given  variety  That we have posted on in prose and verse  Thro'  Tragedy  and  Comedy  and  Farce  Have you not had in me a strange farrago  Of  Rhadamistus Sturgeon  and  Iago  Nay we have run from  English  to the  French  And the great boy became a simple wench  Nature a simple wench much better teaches  To act our characters and wear the breeches  But why this motley mixture'Tis the fashion  The times are medleymedley all the nation  One day reigns  Tragedy  all gloom and sorrow  Then shift the scenesand enter  Farce  tomorrow  Now rise six thousand discontented sailors  Then comes the Farceup get as many taylors  These  kings of shreds and patches  touch'd in brain  Strut for a day and thencrosslegg'd again  Our Goddess  Liberty  from whom we own  Each blessing springsfor GEORGE is on the throne  Now  Magna Charta  and a  William  gives  Then scours the streets and with the rabble lives  Will drink huzza and rouse you from your beds  Break all your windows and perhaps your heads  Here taste opinions passions never fix  But rise and fall like stocksand politicks  That we should  ask  you to our medley treat  And GET you toowas saith no boyish feat  Are we not hopeful youthsDeal fair and tell us  And likely to turn out good sprightly fellows  I mean to have that kind of useful spirit  Which  modestly assures us  we have merit  We little folks like great ones are but show  Bold face oft hides what the faint heart doth know  Think ye we were not in a grievous fright  To have our  noble Patron  in our sight  Who knowsis known so well to  speak  and  write  We pray'd before our awful judge appearing  That our weak pipes were not within his hearing  One sense of his less keen than all the rest  Somewhat becalm'd the flutter of my breast  It gave some courage to our troubled thoughts  That  seeing only  mark'd but half our faults  " 'Tis an ill wind they say that blows no good"  And well the proverb now is understood  For what has long been mourn'd by all the nation  Is at this time  our  only consolation  ON LAURA's GRAVE  BENEATH yon flowery turf the fairest head  E'er slept on Earth's cold bosom lies asleep  O Earth enwrap her soft and o'er her dust  Let every Grace and every Virtue weep  The Morn as o'er the misty plain she treads  Shall sprinkle on the sod her pearly tears  And o'er her grave shall Eve delight to muse  While airy dirges sooth her listening ears  Oft the blue nightly taper's studious flame  Shall weeping Fancy leave and thro' the gloom  Steal a sad visitant to pour her plaints  And bend her pensive head o'er LAURA's tomb  Here shall she see the same due rites to pay  With silent pace in sable weeds array'd  Eyestreaming Sorrow and deepsighing Love  With trailing torch advance along the shade  The Muses come and scatter wreaths around  Weav'd by the fingers of the infant Year  Remembrance comes and hence departing loth  Oft turns the wishful look and drops a tear  SONNET TO A LADY OF INDISCREET VIRTUE  IN IMITATION OF SPENSER  BY T P  WHILE you fair ANNA innocently gay  And free and open all reserve disdain  Whereever Fancy leads securely stray  And conscious of no ill can fear no stain  Let calm Discretion guide with steady rein  Let early Caution twitch your gentle ear  She'll tell you Censure lays her wily train  To blast those beauties which too bright appear  Ah me I see the monster lurking near  I know her haggard eye and poisonous tongue  She scans your actions with malicious leer  Eager to wrest and represent them wrong  Yet shall your conduct circumspect and clear  Nor baleful touch nor fangs envenom'd fear  THE SHEPHERD's INVITATION A SONG  BY CHRISTOPHER MARLOE  COME live with me and be my love  And we will all the pleasures prove  That valleys groves or hill or field  Or wood or steepy mountain yield  There will we sit upon the rocks  And see the shepherds feed their flocks  By shallow rivers to whose falls  Melodious birds sing madrigals  There will I make thee beds of roses  With a thousand fragrant posies  A cap of flowers and a kirtle  Embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle  A gown made of the finest wool  Which from our pretty lambs we pull  Slippers lin'd choicely for the cold  With buckles of the purest gold  A belt of straw and ivy buds  With coral clasps and amber studs  And if these pleasures may thee move  Come live with me and be my love  Thy silver dishes for thy meat  As precious as the gods do eat  Shall on an ivory table be  Prepar'd each day for thee and me  The shepherdswains shall dance and sing  For thy delight each Maymorning  If these delights thy mind may move  Then live with me and be my love  THE NYMPH's ANSWER  BY SIR WALTER RALEIGH  IF all the world and love were young  And truth in every shepherd's tongue  These pretty pleasures might me move  To live with thee and be thy love  But Time drives flocks from field to fold  When rivers rage and rocks grow cold  And Philomel becometh dumb  The rest complain of cares to come  The flowers that bloom in wanton field  To wayward Winter reckoning yield  A honeytongue a heart of gall  Is Fancy's spring but Sorrow's fall  Thy gowns thy shoes thy beds of roses  Thy cap thy kirtle and thy posies  Soon break soon wither soon forgotten  In Folly ripe in Reason rotten  Thy belt of straw and ivy buds  Thy coral clasps and amber studs  All these in me no mind can move  To come to thee and be thy love  What should we talk of dainties then  Of better meat than's fit for men  These are but vain that's only good  Which God hath blest and sent for food  But could Youth last and Love still breed  Had Joy no date and Age no need  Then these delights my mind might move  To live with thee and be thy love  A POEM  BY THE SAME  SHALL I like an hermit dwell  On a rock or in a cell  Calling home the smallest part  That is missing of my heart  To bestow it where I may  Meet a rival every day  If she undervalues me  What care I how sair she be  Were her tresses angel gold  If a stranger may be bold  Unrebuked unafraid  To convert them to a brayde  And with little more ado  Work them into bracelets too  If the mine be grown so free  What care I how rich it be  Were her hands as rich a prize  As her hairs or precious eyes  If she lay them out to take  Kisses for goodmanners sake  And let every lover skip  From her hand unto her lip  If she seem not chaste to me  What care I how chaste she be  No she must be perfect snow  In effect as well as show  Warming but as snowballs do  Not like fire by burning too  But when she by change hath got  To her heart a second lot  Then if others share with me  Farewell her whate'er she be  IN IMITATION OF MARLOE  COME live with me and be my dear  And we will revel all the year  In plains and groves on hills and dales  Where fragrant air breeds sweetest gales  There shall you have the beauteous pine  The cedar and the spreading vine  And all the woods to be a screen  Lest Phoebus kiss my summer's green  The seat of your disport shall be  Over some river in a tree  Where silver sands and pebbles sing  Eternal ditties to the spring  There shall you see the Nymphs at play  And how the Satyrs spend the day  The fishes gliding on the sands  Offering their bellies to your hands  The birds with heavenlytuned throats  Possess wood's echo with sweet notes  Which to your senses will impart  A music to enflame the heart  Upon the bare and leafless oak  The ringdove's wooings will provoke  A colder blood than you possess  To play with me and do no less  In bowers of laurel trimly dight  We will outwear the silent night  While Flora busy is to spread  Her richest treasure on our bed  Ten thousand glowworms shall attend  And all their sparkling lights shall spend  All to adorn and beautify  Your lodging with more majesty  Then in my arms will I enclose  Lilies fair mixture with the rose  Whose nice perfections in Love's play  Shall tune me to the highest key  Thus as we pass the welcome night  In sportful pleasure and delight  The nimble Fairies on the ground  Shall dance and sing melodious sounds  If these may serve for to entice  Your presence to Love's Paradise  Then come with me and be my dear  And we will strait begin the year  MORNING  BY J CUNNINGHAM  IN the barn the tenant cock  Close to Partlet perch'd on high  Briskly crows the shepherd's clock  And proclaims the morning nigh  Swiftly from the mountain's brow  Shadows nurs'd by night retire  And the peeping sunbeam now  Paints with gold the villagespire  Now the pinetree's waving top  Gently greets the morning gale  And the newwak'd kidlings crop  Daisies round the dewy vale  Philomel forsakes the thorn  Plaintive where she prates at night  And the lark to greet the morn  Soars beyond the shepherd's sight  From the claybuilt cottageridge  See the chattering swallow spring  Darting thro' the onearch'd bridge  Quick she dips her dappled wing  Lo the busy bees employ'd  Restless till their task be done  Now from sweet to sweet uncloy'd  Sipping dew before the sun  Trickling thro' the crevic'd rock  See the silver stream distill  Sweet refreshment for the flock  When 'tis sundrove from the hill  Ploughmen for the promis'd corn  Ripening o'er the banks of Tweed  Anxious hear the huntsman's horn  Soften'd by the shepherd's reed  Sweet oh sweet the warbling throng  On the white emblossom'd spray  All is music mirth and song  At the jocund dawn of day  NOON  BY THE SAME  FERVID now the sunbeam glows  Drinking deep the morning gem  Not a dewdrop's left the rose  To refresh her parent stem  By the brook the shepherd dines  From the fierce meridian heat  Shelter'd by the branching pines  Pendent o'er his grassy seat  See the flocks forsake the glade  Where uncheck'd the sunbeams fall  Sure to find a pleasing shade  By the ivy'd abbey wall  Echo in her airy round  O'er the river rock and hill  Cannot catch a single sound  Save the clack of yonder mill  Cattle court the breezes bland  Where the streamlet wanders cool  Or with languid silence stand  Midway in the marshy pool  But from mountain dell or stream  Not a fluttering Zephyr springs  Fearful lest the piercing beam  Scorch its soft its silken wings  Not a leaf has leave to stir  Nature's lull'd serene and still  Quiet e'en the shepherd's cur  Sleeping on the heathclad hill  Languid is the landscape round  Till the fresh descending shower  Kindly cools the thirsty ground  And revives each fainting flower  Now the hill the hedge is green  Now the warbler's throat's in tune  Blithsome is the vernal scene  Brighten'd by the beams of noon  EVENING  BY THE SAME  AS the plodding ploughman goes  Homeward to the hamlet bound  Giantlike his shadow grows  Lengthen'd o'er the level ground  O'er the mead the bullock strays  Freethe furrow'd task is done  And the village windows blaze  Burnish'd by the setting Sun  Mark him from behind the hill  Strike the purplepainted sky  Can the pencil's mimic skill  Copy the refulgent dye  Where the rising forest spreads  Round the timedecaying dome  To their highbuilt airy beds  See the rooks returning home  As the lark with varied tune  Carrols to the evening loud  Mark the mild resplendent moon  Breaking thro' a parted cloud  Now the hermit howlet peeps  From the barn or twisted brake  And the curling vapour creeps  O'er the lilyborder'd lake  As the trout in speckled pride  Playful from its bosom springs  To the banks a ruffled tide  Verges in successive rings  Tripping thro' the silken grass  O'er the pathdivided dale  See the rosecomplexion'd lass  With the wellpois'd milkingpail  Linnets with unnumber'd notes  And the cuckoo bird with two  Tuning sweet their mellow throats  Bid the setting sun adieu  ON MAY  WRITTEN IN APRIL MDCCLXI  BY THE SAME  THE virgin when soften'd by May  Attends to the villager's vows  The birds sweetly bill on the spray  And poplars embrace with their boughs  On Ida bright Venus may reign  Ador'd for her beauty above  We shepherds that live on the plain  Hail May as the mother of Love  From the west as it wantonly blows  Fond Zephyr caresses the pine  The bee steals a kiss from the rose  And willows and woodbines entwine  The pinks by the rivulet's side  That border the vernal alcove  Bend downwards to kiss the soft tide  For May is the mother of Love  May tinges the butterfly's wing  He flutters in bridal array  If the larks and the linnets now sing  Their music is taught them by May  The stockdove recluse with her mate  Conceals her fond bliss in the grove  And murmuring seems to repeat  That May is the mother of Love  The goddess will visit you soon  Ye virgins be sportive and gay  Get your pipes oh ye shepherds in tune  For music must welcome the May  Would Damon have Phillis prove kind  And all his keen anguish remove  Let him tell a soft tale and he'll find  That May is the mother of Love  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME  INDEX TO THE THIRD VOLUME  MARY Queen of Scots an Elegy  Page  Hengist and Mey a Ballad  By the Author of the Concubine  Knowledge an Ode  By the same
