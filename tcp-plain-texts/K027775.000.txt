 POEMS BY WILLIAM COWPER Of the INNER TEMPLE ESQ  Sicut aquae tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis  Sole repercussum aut radiantis imagine lunae  Omnia pervolitat laté loca jamque sub auras  Erigitur summique ferit laquearia tecti  VIRG AEN VIII  So water trembling in a polish'd vase  Reflects the beam that plays upon its face  The sportive light uncertain where it falls  Now strikes the roof now flashes on the walls  Nous sommes nés pour la vérité et nous ne pouvons souffrir son abord les figures les paraboles les emblémes sont toujours des ornements nécessaires pour qu'elle puisse s'annoncer et soit quon craigne qu'elle ne découvre trop brusquement le défaut qu'on voudroit cacher ou qu'enfin elle n'instruise avec trop peu de ménagement ou veut en la recevant qu'elle soit déguisée

TABLE TALK  Si te fortè meae gravis uret sarcina chartoe  Abjicito  HOR LIB I EPIS  A  YOU told me I remember glory built  On selfish principles is shame and guilt  The deeds that men admire as half divine  Stark naught because corrupt in their design  Strange doctrine this that without scruple tears  The laurel that the very light'ning spares  Brings down the warrior's trophy to the dust  And eats into his bloody sword like rust  B  I grant that men continuing what they are  Fierce avaricious proud there must be war  And never meant the rule should be applied  To him that fights with justice on his side  Let laurels drench'd in pure Parnassian dews  Reward his mem'ry dear to ev'ry muse  Who with a courage of unshaken root  In honour's field advancing his firm foot  Plants it upon the line that justice draws  And will prevail or perish in her cause  Tis to the virtues of such men man owes  His portion in the good that heav'n bestows  And when recording history displays  Feats of renown though wrought in antient days  Tells of a few stout hearts that fought and dy'd  Where duty plac'd them at their country's side  The man that is not mov'd with what he reads  That takes not fire at their heroic deeds  Unworthy of the blessings of the brave  Is base in kind and born to be a slave  But let eternal infamy pursue  The wretch to naught but his ambition true  Who for the sake of filling with one blast  The post horns of all Europe lays her waste  Think yourself station'd on a tow'ring rock  To see a people scatter'd like a flock  Some royal mastiff panting at their heels  With all the savage thirst a tyger feels  Then view him selfproclaim'd in a gazette  Chief monster that has plagu'd the nations yet  The globe and sceptre in such hands misplac'd  Those ensigns of dominion how disgrac'd  The glass that bids man mark the fleeting hour  And death's own scythe would better speak his pow'r  Then grace the boney phantom in their stead  With the king's shoulder knot and gay cockade  Cloath the twin brethren in each other's dress  The same their occupation and success  A  'Tis your belief the world was made for man  Kings do but reason on the self same plan  Maintaining your's you cannot their's condemn  Who think or seem to think man made for them  B  Seldom alas the power of logic reigns  With much sufficiency in royal brains  Such reas'ning falls like an inverted cone  Wanting its proper base to stand upon  Man made for kings those optics are but dim  That tell you sosay rather they for him  That were indeed a kingenobling thought  Could they or would they reason as they ought  The diadem with mighty projects lin'd  To catch renown by ruining mankind  Is worth with all its gold and glitt'ring store  Just what the toy will sell for and no more  Oh bright occasions of dispensing good  How seldom used how little understood  To pour in virtue's lap her just reward  Keep vice restrain'd behind a double guard  To quell the faction that affronts the throne  By silent magnanimity alone  To nurse with tender care the thriving arts  Watch every beam philosophy imparts  To give religion her unbridl'd scope  Nor judge by statute a believer's hope  With close fidelity and love unfeign'd  To keep the matrimonial bond unstain'd  Covetous only of a virtuous praise  His life a lesson to the land he sways  To touch the sword with conscientious awe  Nor draw it but when duty bids him draw  To sheath it in the peacerestoring close  With joy beyond what victory bestows  Blest country where these kingly glories shine  Blest England if this happiness be thine  A  Guard what you say the patriotic tribe  Will sneer and charge you with a bribe  B  A bribe  The worth of his three kingdoms I defy  To lure me to the baseness of a lie  And of all lies be that one poet's boast  The lie that flatters I abhor the most  Those arts be their's that hate his gentle reign  But he that loves him has no need to feign  A  Your smooth eulogium to one crown address'd  Seems to imply a censure on the rest  B  Quevedo as he tells his sober tale  Ask'd when in hell to see the royal jail  Approv'd their method in all other things  But where good Sir do you confine your kings  Theresaid his guide the groupe is full in view  Indeed Replied the Donthere are but few  His black interpreter the charge disdain'd  Few fellow There are all that ever reign'd  Wit undistinguishing is apt to strike  The guilty and not guilty both alike  I grant the sarcasm is too severe  And we can readily refute it here  While Alfred's name the father of his age  And the Sixth Edward's grace th' historic page  A  King's then at last have but the lot of all  By their own conduct they must stand or fall  B  True While they live the courtly laureat pays  His quitrent ode his peppercorn of praise  And many a dunce whose fingers itch to write  Adds as he can his tributary mite  A subject's faults a subject may proclaim  A monarch's errors are forbidden game  Thus free from censure overaw'd by fear  And prais'd for virtues that they scorn to wear  The fleeting forms of majesty engage  Respect while stalking o'er life's narrow stage  Then leave their crimes for history to scan  And ask with busy scorn Was this the man  I pity kings whom worship waits upon  Obsequious from the cradle to the throne  Before whose infant eyes the flatt'rer bows  And binds a wreath about their baby brows  Whom education stiffen'd into state  And death awakens from that dream too late  Oh is servility with supple knees  Whose trade it is to smile to crouch to please  If smooth dissimulation skill'd to grace  A devil's purpose with an angel's face  Is smiling peeresses and simp'ring peers  In compassing his throne a few short years  If the gilt carriage and the pamper'd steed  That wants no driving and disdains the lead  If guards mechanically form'd in ranks  Playing at beat of drum their martial pranks  Should'ring and standing as if struck to stone  While condescending majesty looks on  If monarchy consist in such base things  Sighing I say again I pity kings  To be suspected thwarted and withstood  Ev'n when he labours for his country's good  To see a band call'd patriot for no cause  But that they catch at popular applause  Careless of all th' anxiety he feels  Hook disappointment on the public wheels  With all their flippant fluency of tongue  Most confident when palpably most wrong  If this be kingly then farewell for me  All kingship and may I be poor and free  To be the Table Talk of clubs up stairs  To which th' unwash'd artificer repairs  T' indulge his genius after long fatigue  By diving into cabinet intrigue  For what kings deem a toil as well they may  To him is relaxation and mere play  To win no praise when wellwrought plans prevail  But to be rudely censur'd when they fail  To doubt the love his fav'rites may pretend  And in reality to find no friend  If he indulge a cultivated taste  His gall'ries with the works of art well grac'd  To hear it call'd extravagance and waste  If these attendants and if such as these  Must follow royalty then welcome ease  However humble and confin'd the sphere  Happy the state that has not these to fear  A  Thus men whose thoughts contemplative have dwelt  On situations that they never felt  Start up sagacious cover'd with the dust  Of dreaming study and pedantic rust  And prate and preach about what others prove  As if the world and they were hand and glove  Leave kingly backs to cope with kingly cares  They have their weight to carry subjects their's  Poets of all men ever least regret  Increasing taxes and the nation's debt  Could you contrive the payment and rehearse  The mighty plan oracular in verse  No bard howe'er majestic old or new  Should claim my fixt attention more than you  B  Not Brindley nor Bridgewater would essay  To turn the course of Helicon that way  Nor would the nine consent the sacred tide  Should purl amidst the traffic of Cheapside  Or tinkle in 'Change Alley to amuse  The leathern ears of stockjobbers and jews  A  Vouchsafe at least to pitch the key of rhime  To themes more pertinent if less sublime  When ministers and ministerial arts  Patriots who love good places at their hearts  When Admirals extoll'd for standing still  Or doing nothing with a deal of skill  Gen'rals who will not conquer when they may  Firm friends to peace to pleasure and good pay  When freedom wounded almost to despair  Though discontent alone can find out where  When themes like these employ the poet's tongue  ear as mute as if a syren sung  Or tell me if you can what pow'r maintains  A Briton's scorn of arbitrary chains  That were a theme might animate the dead  And move the lips of poets cast in lead  B  The cause tho' worth the search may yet elude  Conjecture and remark however shrewd  They take perhaps a welldirected aim  Who seek it in his climate and his frame  Lib'ral in all things else yet nature here  With stern severity deals out the year  Winter invades the spring and often pours  A chilling flood on summer's drooping flow'rs  Unwelcome vapors quench autumnal beams  Ungenial blasts attending curl the streams  The peasants urge their harvest plie the fork  With double toil and shiver at their work  Thus with a rigor for his good design'd  She rears her fav'rite man of all mankind  His form robust and of elastic tone  Proportion'd well half muscle and half bone  Supplies with warm activity and force  A mind well lodg'd and masculine of course  Hence liberty sweet liberty inspires  And keeps alive his fierce but noble fires  Patient of constitutional controul  He bears it with meek manliness of soul  But if authority grow wanton woe  To him that treads upon his freeborn toe  One step beyond the bound'ry of the laws  Fires him at once in freedom's glorious cause  Thus proud prerogative not much rever'd  Is seldom felt though sometimes seen and heard  And in his cage like parrot fine and gay  Is kept to strut look big and talk away  Born in a climate softer far than our's  Not form'd like us with such Herculean pow'rs  The Frenchman easy debonair and brisk  Give him his lass his fiddle and his frisk  Is always happy reign whoever may  And laughs the sense of mis'ry far away  He drinks his simple bev'rage with a gust  And feasting on an onion and a crust  We never feel th' alacrity and joy  With which he shouts and carols  Vive le Roy    Fill'd with as much true merriment and glee  As if he heard his king saySlave be free  Thus happiness depends as nature shews  Less on exterior things than most suppose  Vigilant over all that he has made  Kind Providence attends with gracious aid  Bids equity throughout his works prevail  And weighs the nations in an even scale  He can encourage slav'ry to a smile  And fill with discontent a British isle  A  Freeman and slave then if the case be such  Stand on a level and you prove too much  If all men indiscriminately share  His fost'ring pow'r and tutelary care  As well be yok'd by despotism's hand  As dwell at large in Britain's charter'd land  B  No Freedom has a thousand charms to show  That slaves howe'er contented never know  The mind attains beneath her happy reign  The growth that nature meant she should attain  The varied fields of science ever new  Op'ning and wider op'ning on her view  She ventures onward with a prosp'rous force  While no base fear impedes her in her course  Religion richest favour of the skies  Stands most reveal'd before the freeman's eyes  No shades of superstition blot the day  Liberty chaces all that gloom away  The soul emancipated unoppress'd  Free to prove all things and hold fast the best  Learns much and to a thousand list'ning minds  Communicates with joy the good she finds  Courage in arms and ever prompt to show  His manly forehead to the fiercest foe  Glorious in war but for the sake of peace  His spirits rising as his toils increase  Guards well what arts and industry have won  And freedom claims him for her firstborn son  Slaves fight for what were better cast away  The chain that binds them and a tyrant's sway  But they that fight for freedom undertake  The noblest cause mankind can have at stake  Religion virtue truth whate'er we call  A blessing freedom is the pledge of all  Oh liberty the pris'ners pleasing dream  The poet's muse his passion and his theme  Genius is thine and thou art fancy's nurse  Lost without thee th' ennobling pow'rs of verse  Heroic song from thy free touch acquires  Its clearest tone the rapture it inspires  Place me where winter breathes his keenest air  And I will sing if liberty be there  And I will sing at liberty's dear feet  In Afric's torrid clime or India's fiercest heat  A  Sing where you please in such a cause I grant  An English Poet's privilege to rant  But is not freedom at least is not our's  Too apt to play the wanton with her pow'rs  Grow freakish and o'er leaping ev'ry mound  Spread anarchy and terror all around  B  Agreed But would you sell or slay your horse  For bounding and curvetting in his course  Or if when ridden with a careless rein  He break away and seek the distant plain  No His high mettle under good controul  Gives him Olympic speed and shoots him to the goal  Let discipline employ her wholesome arts  Let magistrates alert perform their parts  Not skulk or put on a prudential mask  As if their duty were a desp'rate task  Let active laws apply the needful curb  To guard the peace that riot would disturb  And liberty preserv'd from wild excess  Shall raise no feuds for armies to suppress  When tumult lately burst his prison door  And set Plebeian thousands in a roar  When he usurp'd authority's just place  And dar'd to look his master in the face  When the rude rabbles watchword was destroy  And blazing London seem'd a second Troy  Liberty blush'd and hung her drooping head  Beheld their progress with the deepest dread  Blush'd that effects like these she should produce  Worse than the deeds of galleyslaves broke loose  She loses in such storms her very name  And fierce licentiousness should bear the blame  Incomparable gem thy worth untold  Cheap though bloodbought and thrown away  sold  May no foes ravish thee and no false friend  Betray thee while professing to defend  Prize it ye ministers ye monarchs spare  Ye patriots guard it with a miser's care  A  Patriots alas the few that have been foun  Where most they flourish upon English ground  The country's need have scantily supplied  And the last left the scene when Chatham died  B  Not sothe virtue still adorns our age  Though the chief actor died upon the stage  In him Demosthenes was heard again  Liberty taught him her Athenian strain  She cloath'd him with authority and awe  Spoke from his lips and in his looks gave law  His speech his form his action full of grace  And all his country beaming in his face  He stood as some inimitable hand  Would strive to make a Paul or Tully stand  No sycophant or slave that dar'd oppose  Her sacred cause but trembl'd when he rose  And every venal stickler for the yoke  Felt himself crush'd at the first word he spoke  Such men are rais'd to station and command  When providence means mercy to a land  He speaks and they appear to him they owe  Skill to direct and strength to strike the blow  To manage with address to seize with pow'r  The crisis of a dark decisive hour  So Gideon earn'd a vict'ry not his own  Subserviency his praise and that alone  Poor England thou art a devoted deer  Beset with ev'ry ill but that of fear  The nations hunt all mark thee for a prey  They swarm around thee and thou standst at bay  Undaunted still though wearied and perplex'd  Once Chatham sav'd thee but who saves thee next  Alas the tide of pleasure sweeps along  All that should be the boast of British song  'Tis not the wreath that once adorn'd thy brow  The prize of happier times will serve thee now  Our ancestry a gallant christian race  Patterns of ev'ry virtue ev'ry grace  Confess'd a God they kneel'd before they fought  And praised him in the victories he wrought  Now from the dust of antient days bring forth  Their sober zeal integrity and worth  Courage ungrac'd by these affronts the skies  Is but the fire without the sacrifice  The stream that feeds the wellspring of the heart  Not more invigorates life's noblest part  Than virtue quickens with a warmth divine  The pow'rs that sin has brought to a decline  A  Th' inestimable estimate of Brown  Rose like a paperkite and charm'd the town  But measures plann'd and executed well  Shifted the wind that rais'd it and it fell  He trod the very selfsame ground you tread  And victory refuted all he said  B  And yet his judgment was not fram'd amiss  Its error if it err'd was merely this  He thought the dying hour already come  And a complete recov'ry struck him dumb  But that effeminacy folly lust  Enervate and enfeeble and needs must  And that a nation shamefully debas'd  Will be despis'd and trampl'd on at last  Unless sweet penitence her pow'rs renew  Is truth if history itself be true  There is a time and justice marks the date  For longforbearing clemency to wait  That hour elaps'd th'incurable revolt  Is punish'd and down comes the thunderbolt  If mercy  then  put by the threat'ning blow  Must she perform the same kind office  now    May she and if offended heav'n be still  Accessible and pray'r prevail she will  'Tis not however insolence and noise  The tempest of tumultuary joys  Nor is it yet despondence and dismay  Will win her visits or engage her stay  Pray'r only and the penitential tear  Can call her smiling down and fix her here  But when a country one that I could name  In prostitution sinks the sense of shame  When infamous venality grown bold  Writes on his bosom  to be lett or sold    When perjury that heav'n defying vice  Sells oaths by tale and at the lowest price  Stamps God's own name upon a lie just made  To turn a penny in the way of trade  When av'rice starves and never hides his face  Two or three millions of the human race  And not a tongue enquires how where or when  Though conscience will have twinges now and then  When profanation of the sacred cause  In all its parts times ministry and laws  Bespeaks a land once christian fall'n and lost  In all that wars against that title most  What follows next let cities of great name  And regions long since desolate proclaim  Nineveh Babylon and antient Rome  Speak to the present times and times to come  They cry aloud in ev'ry careless ear  Stop while ye may suspend your mad career  O learn from our example and our fate  Learn wisdom and repentance e'er too late  Not only vice disposes and prepares  The mind that slumbers sweetly in her snares  To stoop to tyranny's usurp'd command  And bend her polish'd neck beneath his hand  A dire effect by one of nature's laws  Unchangeably connected with its cause  But providence himself will intervene  To throw his dark displeasure o'er the scene  All are his instruments each form of war  What burns at home or threatens from afar  Nature in arms her elements at strife  The storms that overset the joys of life  Are but his rods to scourge a guilty land  And waste it at the bidding of his hand  He gives the word and mutiny soon roars  In all her gates and shakes her distant shores  The standards of all nations are unfurl'd  She has one foe and that one foe the world  And if he doom that people with a frown  And mark them with the seal of wrath press'd down  Obduracy takes place callous and tough  The reprobated race grows judgment proof  Earth shakes beneath them and heav'n roars above  But nothing scares them from the course they love  To the lascivious pipe and wanton song  That charm down fear they frolic it along  With mad rapidity and unconcern  Down to the gulph from which is no return  They trust in navies and their navies fail  God's curse can cast away ten thousand sail  They trust in armies and their courage dies  In wisdom wealth in fortune and in lies  But all they trust in withers as it must  When he commands in whom they place no trust  Vengeance at last pours down upon their coast  A long despis'd but now victorious host  Tyranny sends the chain that must abridge  The noble sweep of all their privilege  Gives liberty the last the mortal shock  Slips the slave's collar on and snaps the lock  A  Such lofty strains embellish what you teach  Mean you to prophecy or but to preach  B  I know the mind that feels indeed the fire  The muse imparts and can command the lyre  Acts with a force and kindles with a zeal  Whate'er the theme that others never feel  If human woes her soft attention claim  A tender sympathy pervades the frame  She pours a sensibility divine  Along the nerve of ev'ry feeling line  But if a deed not tamely to be borne  Fire indignation and a sense of scorn  The strings are swept with such a pow'r so loud  The storm of music shakes th' astonish'd crowd  So when remote futurity is brought  Before the keen enquiry of her thought  A terrible sagacity informs  The poet's heart he looks to distant storms  He hears the thunder e'er the tempest low'rs  And arm'd with strength surpassing human pow'rs  Seizes events as yet unknown to man  And darts his soul into the dawning plan  Hence in a Roman mouth the graceful name  Of prophet and of poet was the same  Hence British poets too the priesthood shar'd  And ev'ry hallow'd druid was a bard  But no prophetic fires to me belong  I play with syllables and sport in song  A  At Westminster where little poets strive  To set a distich upon six and five  Where discipline helps op'ning buds of sense  And makes his pupils proud with silverpence  I was a poet toobut modern taste  Is so refin'd and delicate and chaste  That verse whatever fire the fancy warms  Without a creamy smoothness has no charms  Thus all success depending on an ear  And thinking I might purchase it too dear  If sentiment were sacrific'd to sound  And truth cut short to make a period round  I judg'd a man of sense could scarce do worse  Than caper in the morrisdance of verse  B  Thus reputation is a spur to wit  And some wits flag through fear of losing it  Give me the line that plows its stately course  Like a proud swan conq'ring the stream by force  That like some cottage beauty strikes the heart  Quite unindebted to the tricks of art  When labour and when dullness club in hand  Like the two figures at St Dunstan's stand  Beating alternately in measur'd time  The clockwork tintinabulum of rhime  Exact and regular the sounds will be  But such mere quarterstrokes are not for me  From him who rears a poem lank and long  To him who strains his all into a song  Perhaps some bonny Caledonian air  All birks and braes though he was never there  Or having whelp'd a prologue with great pains  Feels himself spent and fumbles for his brains  A prologue interdash'd with many a stroke  An art contriv'd to advertise a joke  So that the jest is clearly to be seen  Not in the wordsbut in the gap between  Manner is all in all whate'er is writ  The substitute for genius sense and wit  To dally much with subjects mean and low  Proves that the mind is weak or makes it so  Neglected talents rust into decay  And ev'ry effort ends in pushpin play  The man that means success should soar above  A soldier's feather or a lady's glove  Else summoning the muse to such a theme  The fruit of all her labour is whiptcream  As if an eagle flew aloft and then  Stoop'd from his highest pitch to pounce a wren  As if the poet purposing to wed  Should carve himself a wife in gingerbread  Ages elaps'd e'er Homer's lamp appear'd  And ages e'er the Mantuan swan was heard  To carry nature lengths unknown before  To give a Milton birth ask'd ages more  Thus genius rose and set at order'd times  And shot a dayspring into distant climes  Ennobling ev'ry region that he chose  He sunk in Greece in Italy he rose  And tedious years of Gothic darkness pass'd  Emerg'd all splendor in our isle at last  Thus lovely Halcyons dive into the main  Then show far off their shining plumes again  A  Is genius only found in epic lays  Prove this and forfeit all pretence to praise  Make their heroic pow'rs your own at once  Or candidly confess yourself a dunce  B  These were the chief each interval of night  Was grac'd with many an undulating light  In less illustrious bards his beauty shone  A meteor or a star in these the sun  The nightingale may claim the topmost bough  While the poor grasshopper must chirp below  Like him unnotic'd I and such as I  Spread little wings and rather skip than fly  Perch'd on the meagre produce of the land  An ell or two of prospect we command  But never peep beyond the thorny bound  Or oaken fence that hems the paddoc round  In Eden e'er yet innocence of heart  Had faded poetry was not an art  Language above all teaching or if taught  Only by gratitude and glowing thought  Elegant as simplicity and warm  As exstasy unmanacl'd by form  Not prompted as in our degen'rate days  By low ambition and the thirst of praise  Was natural as is the flowing stream  And yet magnificent a God the theme  That theme on earth exhausted though above  'Tis found as everlasting as his love  Man lavish'd all his thoughts on human things  The feats of heroes and the wrath of kings  But still while virtue kindled his delight  The song was moral and so far was right  'Twas thus till luxury seduc'd the mind  To joys less innocent as less refin'd  Then genius danc'd a bacchanal he crown'd  The brimming goblet seiz'd the thyrsus bound  His brows with ivy rush'd into the field  Of wild imagination and there reel'd  The victim of his own lascivious fires  And dizzy with delight profan'd the sacred wires  Anacreon Horace play'd in Greece and Rome  This Bedlam part and others nearer home  When Cromwell fought for pow'r and while he reign'd  The proud protector of the pow'r he gain'd  Religion harsh intolerant austere  Parent of manners like herself severe  Drew a rough copy of the Christian face  Without the smile the sweetness or the grace  The dark and sullen humour of the time  Judg'd ev'ry effort of the muse a crime  Verse in the finest mould of fancy cast  Was lumber in an age so void of taste  But when the second Charles assum'd the sway  And arts reviv'd beneath a softer day  Then like a bow long forc'd into a curve  The mind releas'd from too constrain'd a nerve  Flew to its first position with a spring  That made the vaulted roofs of pleasure ring  His court the dissolute and hateful school  Of wantonness where vice was taught by rule  Swarm'd with a scribbling herd as deep inlaid  With brutal lust as ever Circe made  From these a long succession in the rage  Of rank obscenity debauch'd their age  Nor ceas'd 'till ever anxious to redress  Th' abuses of her sacred charge the press  The muse instructed a well nurtur'd train  Of abler votaries to cleanse the stain  And claim the palm for purity of song  That lewdness had usurp'd and worn so long  Then decent pleasantry and sterling sense  That never gave nor would endure offence  Whipp'd out of sight with satyr just and keen  The puppy pack that had defil'd the scene  In front of these came Addison In him  Humour in holiday and sightly trim  Sublimity and attic taste combin'd  To polish furnish and delight the mind  Then Pope as harmony itself exact  In verse well disciplin'd complete compact  Gave virtue and morality a grace  That quite eclipsing pleasure's painted face  Levied a tax of wonder and applause  Ev'n on the fools that trampl'd on their laws  But he his musical finesse was such  So nice his ear so delicate his touch  Made poetry a mere mechanic art  And ev'ry warbler has his tune by heart  Nature imparting her satyric gift  Her serious mirth to Arbuthnot and Swist  With droll sobriety they rais'd a smile  At folly's cost themselves unmov'd the while  That constellation set the world in vain  Must hope to look upon their like again  A  Are we then left  B  Not wholly in the dark  Wit now and then struck smartly shows a spark  Sufficient to redeem the modern race  From total night and absolute disgrace  While servile trick and imitative knack  Confine the million in the beaten track  Perhaps some courser who disdains the road  Snuffs up the wind and flings himself abroad  Cotemporaries all surpass'd see one  Short his career indeed but ably run  Churchill himself unconscious of his pow'rs  In penury confum'd his idle hours  And like a scatter'd seed at random sown  Was left to spring by vigor of his own  Lifted at length by dignity of thought  And dint of genius to an affluent lot  He laid his head in luxury's soft lap  And took too often there his easy nap  If brighter beams than all he threw not forth  'Twas negligence in him not want of worth  Surly and slovenly and bold and coarse  Too proud for art and trusting in mere force  Spendthrift alike of money and of wit  Always at speed and never drawing bit  He struck the lyre in such a careless mood  And so disdain'd the rules he understood  The laurel seem'd to wait on his command  He snatch'd it rudely from the muses hand  Nature exerting an unwearied pow'r  Forms opens and gives scent to ev'ry flow'r  Spreads the fresh verdure of the field and leads  The dancing Naiads through the dewy meads  She fills profuse ten thousand little throats  With music modulating all their notes  And charms the woodland scenes and wilds unknown  With artless airs and concerts of her own  But seldom as if fearful of expence  Vouchsafes to man a poet's just pretence  Fervency freedom fluency of thought  Harmony strength words exquisitely sought  Fancy that from the bow that spans the sky  Brings colours dipt in heav'n that never die  A soul exalted above earth a mind  Skill'd in the characters that form mankind  And as the sun in rising beauty dress'd  Looks to the westward from the dappl'd east  And marks whatever clouds may interpose  E'er yet his race begins its glorious close  An eye like his to catch the distant goal  Or e'er the wheels of verse begin to roll  Like his to shed illuminating rays  On ev'ry scene and subject it surveys  Thus grac'd the man asserts a poet's name  And the world chearfully admits the claim  Pity Religion has so seldom found  A skilful guide into poetic ground  The flow'rs would spring where'er she deign'd to stray  And ev'ry muse attend her in her way  Virtue indeed meets many a rhiming friend  And many a compliment politely penn'd  But unattir'd in that becoming vest  Religion weaves for her and half undress'd  Stands in the desart shiv'ring and forlorn  A wint'ry figure like a wither'd thorn  The shelves are full all other themes are sped  Hackney'd and worn to the last flimsy thread  Satyr has long since done his best and curst  And loathsome ribaldry has done his worst  Fancy has sported all her pow'rs away  In tales in trifles and in children's play  And 'tis the sad complaint and almost true  Whate'er we write we bring forth nothing new  'Twere new indeed to see a bard all fire  Touch'd with a coal from heav'n assume the lyre  And tell the world still kindling as he sung  With more than mortal music on his tongue  That he who died below and reigns above  Inspires the song and that his name is love  For after all if merely to beguile  By flowing numbers and a flow'ry stile  The taedium that the lazy rich endure  Which now and then sweet poetry may cure  Or if to see the name of idol self  Stamp'd on the wellbound quarto grace the shelf  To float a bubble on the breath of fame  Prompt his endeavour and engage his aim  Debas'd to servile purposes of pride  How are the powers of genius misapplied  The gift whose office is the giver's praise  To trace him in his word his works his ways  Then spread the rich discov'ry and invite  Mankind to share in the divine delight  Distorted from its use and just design  To make the pitiful possessor shine  To purchase at the foolfrequented fair  Of vanity a wreath for self to wear  Is profanation of the basest kind  Proof of a trifling and a worthless mind  A  Hail Sternhold then and Hopkins hail  B  Amen  If flatt'ry folly lust employ the pen  If acrimony slander and abuse  Give it a charge to blacken and traduce  Though Butler's wit Pope's numbers Prior's ease  With all that fancy can invent to please  Adorn the polish'd periods as they fall  One Madrigal of their's is worth them all  A  'Twould thin the ranks of the poetic tribe  To dash the pen through all that you proscribe  B  No matterwe could shift when they were not  And should no doubt if they were all forgot  THE PROGRESS OF ERROR  Si quid loquar audiendum  HOR LIB OD  SING muse if such a theme so dark so long  May find a muse to grace it with a song  By what unseen and unsuspected arts  The serpent error twines round human hearts  Tell where she lurks beneath what flow'ry shades  That not a glimpse of genuin light pervades  The pois'nous black insinuating worm  Successfully conceals her loathsome form  Take if ye can ye careless and supine  Counsel and caution from a voice like mine  Truths that the theorist could never reach  And observation taught me I would teach  Not all whose eloquence the fancy fills  Musical as the chime of tinkling rills  Weak to perform though mighty to pretend  Can trace her mazy windings to their end  Discern the fraud beneath the specious lure  Prevent the danger or prescribe the cure  The clear harangue and cold as it is clear  Falls soporific on the listless ear  Like quicksilver the rhet'ric they display  Shines as it runs but grasp'd at slips away  Plac'd for his trial on this bustling stage  From thoughtless youth to ruminating age  Free in his will to chuse or to refuse  Man may improve the crisis or abuse  Else on the fatalists unrighteous plan  Say to what bar amenable were man  With nought in charge he could betray no trust  And if he fell would fall because he must  love reward him or if vengeance strike  His recompence in both unjust alike  Divine authority within his breast  Brings every thought word action to the test  Warns him or prompts approves him or restrains  As reason or as passion takes the reins  Heav'n from above and conscience from within  Cry in his startled ear abstain from sin  The world around solicits his desire  And kindles in his soul a treach'rous fire  While all his purposes and steps to guard  Peace follows virtue as its sure reward  And pleasure brings as surely in her train  Remorse and sorrow and vindictive pain  Man thus endued with an elective voice  Must be supplied with objects of his choice  Where'er he turns enjoyment and delight  Or present or in prospect meet his sight  These open on the spot their honey'd store  Those call him loudly to pursuit of more  His unexhausted mine the sordid vice  Avarice shows and virtue is the price  Here various motives his ambition raise  Pow'r pomp and splendor and the thirst of praise  There beauty woes him with expanded arms  E'en Bacchanalian madness has its charms  Nor these alone whose pleasures less refin'd  Might well alarm the most unguarded mind  Seek to supplant his unexperienced youth  Or lead him devious from the path of truth  Hourly allurements on his passions press  Safe in themselves but dang'rous in th' excess  Hark how it floats upon the dewy air  O what a dying dying close was there  'Tis harmony from yon sequester'd bow'r  Sweet harmony that sooths the midnight hour  Long e'er the charioteer of day had run  His morning course th' enchantment was begun  And he shall gild yon mountains height again  'er yet the pleasing toil becomes a pain  Is this the rugged path the steep ascent  That virtue points to Can a life thus spent  Lead to the bliss she promises the wise  Detach the soul from earth and speed her to the skies  Ye devotees to your ador'd employ  Enthusiasts drunk with an unreal joy  Love makes the music of the blest above  Heav'ns harmony is universal love  And earthly sounds though sweet and well combin'd  And lenient as soft opiates to the mind  Leave vice and folly unsubdu'd behind  Grey dawn appears the sportsman and his train  peckle the bosom of the

Charg'd with the folly of his life's mad scene  He takes offence and wonders what you mean  The joy the danger and the toil o'erpays  'Tis exercise and health and length of days  Again impetuous to the field he flies  Leaps ev'ry fence but one there falls and dies  Like a slain deer the tumbril brings him home  Unmiss'd but by his dogs and by his groom  Ye clergy while your orbit is your place

rueful jest  A cassock'd huntsman and a fiddling priest  He from Italian songsters takes his cue  Set Paul to music he shall quote him too  He takes the field the master of the pack  Cries well done Saintand claps him on the back  Is this the path of sanctity Is this  To stand a waymark in the road to bliss  Himself a wand'rer from the narrow way  His silly sheep what wonder if they stray  Go cast your orders at your Bishop's feet  Send your dishonour'd gown to Monmouth Street  The sacred function in your hands is made  Sad sacrilege No function but a trade  Occiduus is a pastor of renown  When he has pray'd and preach'd the sabbath down  With wire and catgut he concludes the day  Quav'ring and semiquav'ring care away  The full concerto swells upon your ear  All elbows shake Look in and

much not ev'n Occiduus more  Love joy and peace make harmony more meet  For sabbath evenings and perhaps as sweet  Will not the sickliest sheep of ev'ry flock  Resort to this example as a rock  There stand and justify the foul abuse  Of sabbath hours with plausible excuse  If apostolic gravity be free  To play the fool on Sundays why not we  If he the tinkling harpsichord regards  As inoffensive what offence in cards  Strike up the fiddles let us all be gay  Laymen have leave to dance if parsons play  Oh Italy Thy sabbaths will be soon  Our sabbaths clos'd with mumm'ry and buffoon  Preaching and pranks will share the motley scene  Our's parcell'd out as thine have ever been  God's worship and the mountebank between  What says the prophet Let that day be blest  With holiness and consecrated rest  Pastime and bus'ness both it should exclude  And bar the door the moment they intrude  Nobly distinguish'd above all the six  By deeds in which the world must never mix  Hear him again He calls it a delight  A day of luxury observ'd aright  When the glad soul is made heav'ns welcome guest  Sits banquetting and God provides the feast  But triflers are engag'd and cannot come  Their answer to the call is  Not at home  Oh the dear pleasures of the velvet plain  The painted tablets dealt and dealt again  Cards with what rapture and the polish'd die  The yawning chasm of indolence supply  Then to the dance and make the sober moon  Witness of joys that shun the sight of noon  Blame cynic if you can quadrille or ball  The snug close party or the splendid hall  Where night downstooping from her ebon throne  Views constellations brighter than her own  'Tis innocent and harmless and refin'd  The balm of care elysium of the mind  Innocent Oh if venerable time  Slain at the foot of pleasure be no crime  Then with his silver beard and magic wand  Let Comus rise Archbishop of the land  Let him your rubric and your feasts prescribe  Grand metropolitan of all the tribe  Of manners rough and coarse athletic cast  The rank debauch suits Clodio's filthy taste  Rufillus exquisitely form'd by rule  Not of the moral but the dancing school  Wonders at Clodio's follies in a tone  As tragical as others at his own  He cannot drink five bottles bilk the score  Then kill a constable and drink five more  But he can draw a pattern make a tart  And has the ladies etiquette by heart  Go fool and arm in arm with Clodio plead  Your cause before a bar you little dread  But know the law that bids the drunkard die  Is far too just to pass the trifler by  Both baby featur'd and of infant size  View'd from a distance and with heedless eyes  Folly and innocence are so alike  The diff'rence though essential fails to strike  Yet folly ever has a vacant stare  A simp'ring count'nance and a trifling air  But innocence sedate serene erect  Delights us by engaging our respect  Man nature's guest by invitation sweet  Receives from her both appetite and treat  But if he play the glutton and exceed  His benefactress blushes at the deed  For nature nice as lib'ral to dispense  Made nothing but a brute the slave of sense  Daniel ate pulse by choice example rare  Heav'n bless'd the youth and made him fresh and fair  Gorgonius sits abdominous and wan  Like a fatsquab upon a Chinese fan  He snuffs far off th' anticipated joy  Turtle and ven'son all his thoughts employ  Prepares for meals as jockeys take a sweat  Oh nauseous an emetic for a whet  Will providence o'erlook the wasted good  Temperance were no virtue if he cou'd  That pleasures therefore or what such we call  Are hurtful is a truth confess'd by all  And some that seem to threaten virtue less  Still hurtful in th' abuse or by th' excess  Is man then only for his torment plac'd  The center of delights he may not taste  Like fabled Tantalus condemn'd to hear  The precious stream still purling in his ear  Lipdeep in what he longs for and yet curst  With prohibition and perpetual thirst  No wranglerdestitute of shame and sense  The precept that injoins him abstinence  Forbids him none but the licentious joy  Whose fruit though fair tempts only to destroy  Remorse the fatal egg by pleasure laid  In every bosom where her nest is made  Hatch'd by the beams of truth denies him rest  And proves a raging scorpion in his breast  No pleasure Are domestic comforts dead  Are all the nameless sweets of friendship fled  Has time worn out or fashion put to shame  Good sense good health good conscience and good fame  All these belong to virtue and all prove  That virtue has a title to your love  Have you no touch of pity that the poor  Stand starved at your inhospitable door  Or if yourself too scantily supplied  Need help let honest industry provide  Earn if you want if you abound impart  These both are pleasures to the feeling heart  No pleasure Has some sickly eastern waste  Sent us a wind to parch us at a blast  Can British paradise no scenes afford  To please her sated and indiff'rent lord  Are sweet philosophy's enjoyments run  Quite to the lees And has religion none  Brutes capable should tell you 'tis a lye  And judge you from the kennel and the sty  Delights like these ye sensual and profane  Ye are bid begg'd besought to entertain  Call'd to these crystal streams do ye turn off  Obscene to swill and swallow at a trough  Envy the beast then on whom heav'n bestows  Your pleasures with no curses in the close  Pleasure admitted in undue degree  Enslaves the will nor leaves the judgment free  'Tis not alone the grapes enticing juice  Unnerves the moral pow'rs and marrs their use  Ambition av'rice and the lust of fame  And woman lovely woman does the same  The heart surrender'd to the ruling pow'r  Of some ungovern'd passion ev'ry hour  Finds by degrees the truths that once bore sway  And all their deep impression wear away  So coin grows smooth in traffic current pass'd  'Till Caesar's image is effac'd at last  The breach though small at first soon op'ning wide  In rushes folly with a full moon tide  Then welcome errors of whatever size  To justify it by a thousand lies  As creeping ivy clings to wood or stone  And hides the ruin that it feeds upon  So sophistry cleaves close to and protects  Sin's rotten trunk concealing its defects  Mortals whose pleasures are their only care  First wish to be impos'd on and then are  And lest the fulsome artifice should fail  Themselves will hide its coarseness with a veil  Not more industrious are the just and true  To give to virtue what is virtue's due  The praise of wisdom comeliness and worth  And call her charms to public notice forth  Than vice's mean and disingenuous race  To hide the shocking features of her face  Her form with dress and lotion they repair  Then kiss their idol and pronounce her fair  The sacred implement I now employ  Might prove a mischief or at best a toy  A trifle if it move but to amuse  But if to wrong the judgment and abuse  Worse than a poignard in the basest hand  It stabs at once the morals of a land  Ye writers of what none with safety reads  Footing it in the dance that fancy leads  Ye novellists who marr what ye would mend  Sniv'ling and driv'ling folly without end  Whose corresponding misses fill the ream  With sentimental frippery and dream  Caught in a delicate soft silken net  By some lewd Earl or rakehell Baronet  Ye pimps who under virtue's fair pretence  Steal to the closet of young innocence  And teach her unexperienc'd yet and green  To scribble as you scribble at fifteen  Who kindling a combustion of desire  With some cold moral think to quench the fire  Though all your engineering proves in vain  The dribbling stream ne'er puts it out again  Oh that a verse had pow'r and could command  Far far away these fleshflies of the land  Who fasten without mercy on the fair  And suck and leave a craving maggot there  Howe'er disguis'd th' inflammatory tale  And covered with a finespun specious veil  Such writers and such readers owe the gust  And relish of their pleasure all to lust  But the muse eaglepinion'd has in view  A quarry more important still than you  Down down the wind she swims and sails away  Now stoops upon it and now grasps the prey  Petronius all the muses weep for thee  But ev'ry tear shall scald thy memory  The graces too while virtue at their shrine  Lay bleeding under that soft hand of thine  Felt each a mortal stab in her own breast  Abhorr'd the sacrifice and curs'd the priest  Thou polish'd and high finish'd foe to truth  Gray beard corruptor of our list'ning youth  To purge and skim away the filth of vice  That so refin'd it might the more entice  Then pour it on the morals of thy son  To taint  his  heart was worthy of  thine own  Now while the poison all high life pervades  Write if thou can'st one letter from the shades  One and one only charg'd with deep regret  That thy worst part thy principles live yet  One fad epistle thence may cure mankind  Of the plague spread by bundles left behind  'Tis granted and no plainer truth appears  Our most important are our earliest years  The mind impressible and soft with ease  Imbibes and copies what she hears and sees  And through life's labyrinth holds fast the clue  That education gives her false or true  Plants rais'd with tenderness are seldom strong  Man's coltish disposition asks the thong  And without discipline the fav'rite child  Like a neglected forrester runs wild  But we as if good qualities would grow  Spontaneous take but little pains to sow  We give some latin and a smatch of greek  Teach him to fence and figure twice a week  And having done we think the best we can  Praise his proficiency and dub him man  From school to Cam or Isis and thence home  And thence with all convenient speed to Rome  With rev'rend tutor clad in habit lay  To teaze for cash and quarrel with all day  With memorandumbook for ev'ry town  Aud ev'ry post and where the chaise broke down  His stock a few French phrases got by heart  With much to learn but nothing to impart  The youth obedient to his sire's commands  Sets off a wand'rer into foreign lands  Surpriz'd at all they meet the goslin pair  With aukward gait stretch'd neck and silly stare  Discover huge cathedrals built with stone  And steeples tow'ring high much like our own  But show peculiar light by many a grin  At Popish practices observ'd within  E'er long some bowing smirking smart Abbé  Remarks two loit'rers that have lost their way  And being always primed with  politesse  For men of their appearance and andress  With much compassion undertakes the task  To tell them more than they have wit to ask  Points to inscriptions wheresoe'er they tread  Such as when legible were never read  But being canker'd now and half worn out  Craze antiquarian brains with endless doubt  Some headless hero or some Caesar shows  Defective only in his Roman nose  Exhibits elevations drawings plans  Models of Herculanean pots and pans  And sells them medals which if neither rare  Nor antient will be so preserv'd with care  Strange the recital from whatever cause  His great improvement and new lights he draws  The 'Squire once bashful is shamefac'd no more  But teems with pow'rs he never felt before  Whether encreas'd momentum and the force  With which from clime to clime he sped his course  As axles sometimes kindle as they go  Chaf'd him and brought dull nature to a glow  Or whether clearer skies and softer air  That make Italian flow'rs so sweet and fair  Fresh'ning his lazy spirits as he ran  Unfolded genially and spread the man  Returning he proclaims by many a grace  By shrugs and strange contortions of his face  How much a dunce that has been sent to roam  Excels a dunce that has been kept at home  Accomplishments have taken virtue's place  And wisdom falls before exterior grace  We slight the precious kernel of the stone  And toil to polish its rough coat alone  A just deportment manners grac'd with ease  Elegant phrase and figure form'd to please  Are qualities that seem to comprehend  Whatever parents guardians schools intend  Hence an unfurnish'd and a listless mind  Though busy trifling empty though refin'd  Hence all that interferes and dares to clash  With indolence and luxury is trash  While learning once the man's exclusive pride  Seems verging fast towards the female side  Learning itself receiv'd into a mind  By nature weak or viciously inclin'd  Serves but to lead philosophers astray  Where children would with ease discern the way  And of all arts sagacious dupes invent  To cheat themselves and gain the world's assent  The worst is scripture warp'd from it's intent  The carriage bowls along and all are pleas'd  If Tom be sober and the wheels well greas'd  But if the rogue have gone a cup too far  Left out his linchpin or forgot his tar  It suffers interruption and delay  And meets with hindrance in the smoothest way  When some hypothesis absurd and vain  Has fill'd with all its fumes a critic's brain  The text that sorts not with his darling whim  Though plain to others is obscure to him  The will made subject to a lawless force  All is irregular and out of course  And judgment drunk and bribed to lose his way  Winks hard and talks of darkness at noon day  A critic on the sacred book should be  Candid and learn'd dispassionate and free  Free from the wayward bias bigots feel  From fancy's influence and intemp'rate zeal  But above all or let the wretch refrain  Nor touch the page he cannot but profane  Free from the domineering pow'r of lust  A lewd interpreter is never just  How shall I speak thee or thy pow'r address  Thou God of our idolatry the press  By thee religion liberty and laws  Exert their influence and advance their cause  By thee worse plagues than Pharaoh's land befel  Diffus'd make earth the vestibule of hell  Thou fountain at which drink the good and wise  Thou everbubbling spring of endless lies  Like Eden's dread probationary tree  Knowledge of good and evil is from thee  No wild enthusiast ever yet could rest  Till half mankind were like himself possess'd  Philosophers who darken and put out  Eternal truth by everlasting doubt  Church quacks with passions under no command  Who fill the world with doctrines contraband  Discov'rers of they know not what confin'd  Within no bounds the blind that lead the blind  To streams of popular opinion drawn  Deposit in those shallows all their spawn  The wriggling fry soon fill the creeks around  Pois'ning the waters where their swarms abound  Scorn'd by the nobler tenants of the flood  Minnows and gudgeons gorge th' unwholesome food  The propagated myriads spread so fast  E'en Leuwenhoek himself would stand aghast  Employ'd to calculate th' enormous sum  And own his crabcomputing pow'rs o'ercome  Is this Hyperbole The world well known  Your sober thoughts will hardly find it one  Fresh confidence the speculatist takes  From ev'ry harebrain'd proselyte he makes  And therefore prints Himself but halfdeceiv'd  'Till others have the soothing tale believ'd  Hence comment after comment spun as fine  As bloated spiders draw the flimsy line  Hence the same word that bids our lusts obey  Is misapplied to sanctify their sway  If stubborn Greek refuse to be his friend  Hebrew or Syriac shall be forc'd to bend  If languages and copies all cry No  Somebody prov'd it centuries ago  Like trout pursued the critic in despair  Darts to the mud and finds his safety there  Women whom custom has forbid to fly  The scholar's pitch the scholar best knows why  With all the simple and unletter'd poor  Admire his learning and almost adore  Whoever errs the priest can ne'er be wrong  With such fine words familiar to his tongue  Ye ladies for indiff'rent in your cause  I should deserve to forfeit all applause  Whatever shocks or gives the least offence  To virtue delicacy truth or sense  Try the criterion 'tis a faithful guide  Nor has nor can have scripture on its side  None but an author knows an author's cares  Or fancy's fondness for the child she bears  Committed once into the public arms  The baby seems to smile with added charms  Like something precious ventur'd far from shore  'Tis valued for the dangers sake the more  He views it with complacency supreme  Solicits kind attention to his dream  And daily more enamour'd of the cheat  Kneels and asks heav'n to bless the dear deceit  So one whose story serves at least to show  Men lov'd their own productions long ago  Wooed an unfeeling statue for his wife  Nor rested till the Gods had giv'n it life  If some mere driv'ler suck the sugar'd fib  One that still needs his leading string and bib  And praise his genius he is soon repaid  In praise applied to the same part his head  For 'tis a rule that holds for ever true  Grant me discernment and I grant it you  Patient of contradiction as a child  Affable humble diffident and mild  Such was Sir Isaac and such Boyle and Locke  Your blund'rer is as sturdy as a rock  The creature is so sure to kick and bite  A muleteer's the man to set him right  First appetite enlists him truth's sworn foe  Then obstinate selfwill confirms him so  Tell him he wanders that his error leads  To fatal ills that though the path he treads  Be flow'ry and he see no cause of fear  Death and the pains of hell attend him there  In vain the slave of arrogance and pride  He has no hearing on the prudent side  His still refuted quirks he still repeats  New rais'd objections with new quibbles meets  'Till sinking in the quicksand he defends  He dies disputing and the contest ends  But not the mischiefs they still left behind  Like thistleseeds are sown by ev'ry wind  Thus men go wrong with an ingenious skill  Bend the strait rule to their own crooked will  And with a clear and shining lamp supplied  First put it out then take it for a guide  Halting on crutches of unequal size  One leg by truth supported one by lies  They sidle to the goal with aukward pace  Secure of nothing but to lose the race  Faults in the life breed errors in the brain  And these reciprocally those again  The mind and conduct mutually imprint  And stamp their image in each other's mint  Each sire and dam of an infernal race  Begetting and conceiving all that's base  None sends his arrow to the mark in view  Whose hand is feeble or his aim untrue  For though e'er yet the shaft is on the wing  Or when it first forsakes th' elastic string  It err but little from th' intended line  It falls at last far wide of his design  So he that seeks a mansion in the sky  Must watch his purpose with a stedfast eye  That prize belongs to none but the sincere  The least obliquity is fatal here  With caution taste the sweet Circaean cup  He that sips often at last drinks it up  Habits are soon assum'd but when we strive  To strip them off 'tis being flay'd alive  Call'd to the temple of impure delight  He that abstains and he alone does right  If a wish wander that way call it home  He cannot long be safe whose wishes roam  But if you pass the threshold you are caught  Die then if pow'r Almighty save you not  There hard'ning by degrees 'till double steel'd  Take leave of nature's God and God reveal'd  Then laugh at all you trembl'd at before  And joining the freethinkers brutal roar  Swallow the two grand nostrums they dispense  That scripture lies and blasphemy is sense  If clemency revolted by abuse  Be damnable then damn'd without excuse  Some dream that they can silence when they will  The storm of passion and say  Peace    be still    But "  Thus far and no farther    To the wild wave or wilder human breast  Implies authority that never can  That never ought to be the lot of man  But muse forbear long flights forebode a fall  Strike on the deeptoned chord the sum of all  Hear the just law the judgment of the skies  He that hates truth shall be the dupe of lies  And he that  will  be cheated to the last  Delusions strong as

right way if you chuse the wrong  Take it and perish but restrain your tongue  Charge not with light sufficient and left free  Your willful suicide on God's decree  Oh how unlike the complex works of man  Heav'ns easy artless unincumber'd plan  No meretricious graces to beguile  No clust'ring ornaments to clog the pile  From ostentation as from weakness free  It stands like the caerulean arch we see  Majestic in its own simplicity  Inscrib'd above the portal from afar  Conspicuous as the brightness of a star  Legible only by the light they give  Stand the soulquick'ning wordsBELIEVE AND LIVE  Too many shock'd at what should charm them most  Despise the plain direction and are lost  Heav'n on such terms they cry with proud disdain  Incredible impossible and vain  Rebel because 'tis easy to

virgin wrong'd a friend  Or stabb'd a man to serve some private end  Was blasphemy his sin Or did he stray  From the strict duties of the sacred day  Sit long and late at the carousing board  Such were the sins with which he charg'd his Lord  Nothe man's morals were exact what then  'Twas his ambition to be seen of men  His virtues were his pride and that one vice  Made all his virtues gewgaws of no price  He wore them as fine trappings for a show  A praying synagogue frequenting beau  The selfapplauding bird the peacock see  Mark what a sumptuous Pharisee is he  Meridian sunbeams tempt him to unfold  His radiant glories azure green and gold  He treads as if some solemn music near  His measur'd step were govern'd by his ear  And seems to say ye meaner fowl give place  I am all splendor dignity and grace  Not so the pheasant on his charms presumes  Though he too has a glory in his plumes  He christian like retreats with modest mien  To the close copse or far sequester'd green  And shines without desiring to be seen  The plea of works as arrogant and vain  Heav'n turns from with abhorrence and disdain  Not more affronted by avow'd neglect  Than by the mere dissemblers feign'd respect  What is all righteousness that men devise  What but a fordid bargain for the skies  But Christ as soon would abdicate his own  As sloop from heav'n to sell the proud a throne  His dwelling a recess in some rude rock  Book beads and mapledish his meagre stock  In shirt of hair and weeds of canvass dress'd  Girt with a bellrope that the Pope has bless'd  Adust with stripes told out for

mine differ What's a name  I say the Bramin has the fairer claim  If suff'rings scripture no where recommends  Devis'd by self to answer selfish ends  Give saintship then all Europe must agree  Ten starvling hermits suffer less than he  The truth is if the truth may suit your ear  And prejudice have left a passage clear  Pride has attain'd its most luxuriant growth  And poison'd every virtue in them both  Pride may be pamper'd while the flesh grows lean  Humility may cloath an English Dean  That grace was Cowper'shis confess'd by all  Though plac'd in golden Durham's second stall  Not all the plenty of a Bishop's board  His palace and his lacqueys and my Lord  More nourish pride that condescending vice  Than abstinence and beggary and lice  It thrives in misery and abundant grows  In misery fools upon themselves impose  But why before us Protestants produce  An Indian mystic or a French recluse  Their sin is plain but what have we to fear  Reform'd and well instructed You shall hear  Yon antient prude whose wither'd features show  She might be young some forty years ago  Her elbows pinion'd close upon her hips  Her head erect her fan upon her lips  Her eyebrows arch'd her eyes both gone astray  To watch yon am'rous couple in their play  With boney and unkerchief'd neck defies  The rude inclemency of wintry skies  And sails with lappethead and mincing airs  Duely at clink of bell to morning pray'rs  To thrift and parsimony much inclin'd  She yet allows herself that boy behind  The shiv'ring urchin bending as he goes  With slipshod heels and dew drop at his nose  His predecessors coat advanc'd to wear  Which furture pages are yet doom'd to share  Carries her bible tuck'd beneath his arm  And hides his hands to keep his fingers warm  She half an angel in her own account  Doubts not hereafter with the saints to mount  Though not a grace appears on strictest search  But that she fasts and item goes to church  Conscious of age she recollects her youth  And tells not always with an eye to truth  Who spann'd her waist and who where'er he came  Scrawl'd upon glass Miss Bridget's lovely name  Who stole her slipper fill'd it with tokay  And drank the little bumper ev'ry day  Of temper as invenom'd as an asp  Censorious and her every word a wasp  In faithful mem'ry she records the crimes  Or real or fictitious of the times  Laughs at the reputations she has torn  And holds them dangling at arms length in scorn  Such are the fruits of sanctimonious pride  Of malice fed while flesh is mortified  Take Madam the reward of all your pray'rs  Where hermits and where Bramins meet with theirs  Your portion is with them nay never frown  But if you please some fathoms lower down  Artist attendyour brushes and your paint  Produce themtake a chairnow draw a Saint  Oh sorrowful and sad the streaming tears  Channel her cheeks a Niobe appears  Is this a Saint Throw tints and all away  True piety is chearful as the day  Will weep indeed and heave a pitying groan  For others woes but smiles upon her own  What purpose has the King of Saints in view  Why falls the gospel like a gracious dew  To call up plenty from the teeming earth  Or curse the desart with a tenfold dearth  Is it that Adam's offspring may be sav'd  From servile fear or be the more enslav'd  loose the links that gall'd mankind before  Or bind them faster on and add still more  The freeborn Christian has no chains to prove  Or if a chain the golden one of love  No fear attends to quench his glowing fires  What fear he feels his gratitude inspires  Shall he for such deliv'rance freely wrought  Recompense ill He trembles at the thought  His masters int'rest and his own combin'd  Prompt ev'ry movement of his heart and mind  Thought word and deed his liberty evince  His freedom is the freedom of a Prince  Man's obligations infinite of course  His life should prove that he perceives their force  His utmost he can render is but small  The principle and motive all in all  You have two servantsTom an arch sly rogue  From top to toe the Geta now in vogue  Genteel in figure easy in address  Moves without noise and swift as an express  Reports a message with a pleasing grace  Expert in all the duties of his place  Say on what hinge does his obedience move  Has he a world of gratitude and love  No not a spark'tis all mere sharpers play  He likes your house your housemaid and your pay  Reduce his wages or get rid of her  Tom quits you with your most obedient Sir  The dinner serv'd Charles takes his usual stand  Watches your eye anticipates command  Sighs if perhaps your appetite should fail  And if he but suspects a frown turns pale  Consults all day your int'rest and your ease  Richly rewarded if he can but please  And proud to make his firm attachment known  To save your life would nobly risque his own  Now which stands highest in your serious thought  Charles without doubt say youand so he ought  One act that from a thankful heart proceeds  Excels ten thousand mercenary deeds  Thus heav'n approves as honest and sincere  The work of gen'rous love and filial fear  But with averted eyes th'omniscient judge  Scorns the base hireling and the slavish drudge  Where dwell these matchless Saints Old Curio cries  Ev'n at your side Sir and before your eyes  The favour'd few th' enthusiasts you despise  And pleas'd at heart because on holy ground  Sometimes a canting hypocrite is found  Reproach a people with his single fall  And cast his filthy raiment at them all  Attendan apt similitude shall show  Whence springs the conduct that offends you so  See where it smoaks along the sounding plain  Blown all aslant a driving dashing rain  Peal upon peal redoubling all around  Shakes it again and faster to the ground  Now flashing wide now glancing as in play  Swift beyond thought the light'nings dart away  Ere yet it came the traveller urg'd his steed  And hurried but with unsuccessful speed  Now drench'd throughout and hopeless of his case  He drops the rein and leaves him to his pace  Suppose unlook'd for in a scene so rude  Long hid by interposing hill or wood  Some mansion neat and elegantly dress'd  By some kind hospitable heart possess'd  Offer him warmth security and rest  Think with what pleasure safe and at his ease  He hears the tempest howling in the trees  What glowing thanks his lips and heart employ  While danger past is turn'd to present joy  So fares it with the sinner when he feels  A growing dread of vengeance at his heels  His conscience like a glassy lake before  Lash'd into foaming waves begins to roar  The law grown clamorous though silent long  Arraigns him charges him with every wrong  Asserts the rights of his offended Lord  And death or restitution is the word  The last impossible he fears the first  And having well deserv'd expects the worst  Then welcome refuge and a peaceful home  Oh for a shelter from the wrath to come  Crush me ye rocks ye falling mountains hide  Or bury me in oceans angry tide  The scrutiny of those all seeing eyes  I dare notand you need not God replies  The remedy you want I freely give  The book shall teach you read believe and live  'Tis donethe raging storm is heard no more  Mercy receives him on her peaceful shore  And justice guardian of the dread command  Drops the red vengeance from his willing hand  A soul redeem'd demands a life of praise  Hence the complexion of his future days  Hence a demeanor holy and unspeck'd  And the world's hatred as its sure effect  Some lead a life unblameable and just  Their own dear virtue their unshaken trust  They never sinor if as all offend  Some trivial slips their daily walk attend  The poor are near at hand the charge is small  A slight gratuity atones for all  For though the Pope has lost his int'rest here  And pardons are not sold as once they were  No Papist more desirous to compound  Than some grave sinners upon English ground  That plea refuted other quirks they seek  Mercy is infinite and man is weak  The future shall obliterate the past  And heav'n no doubt shall be their home at last  Come thena still small whisper in your ear  He has no hope that never had a fear  And he that never doubted of his state  He may perhapsperhaps he maytoo late  The path to bliss abounds with many a snare  Learning is one and wit however rare  The Frenchman first in literary fame  Mention him if you pleaseVoltaire The same  With spirit genius eloquence supplied  Liv'd long wrote much laugh'd heartily and died  The scripture was his jestbook whence he drew  Bon môts  to gall the Christian and the Jew  An infidel in health but what when sick  Oh then a text would touch him at the quick  View him at Paris in his last career  Surrounding throngs the demigod revere  Exalted on his pedestal of pride  And fum'd with frankincense on ev'ry side  He begs their flattery with his latest breath  And smother'd in't at last is prais'd to death  Yon cottager who weaves at her own door  Pillow and bobbins all her little store  Content though mean and chearful if not gay  Shuffling her threads about the livelong day  Just earns a scanty pittance and at night  Lies down secure her heart and pocket light  She for her humble sphere by nature fit  Has little understanding and no wit  Receives no praise but though her lot be such  Toilsome and indigent she renders much  Just knows and knows no more her bible true  A truth the brilliant Frenchman never knew  And in that charter reads with sparkling eyes  Her title to a treasure in the skies  Oh happy peasant Oh unhappy bard  His the mere tinsel her's the rich reward  He prais'd perhaps for ages yet to come  She never heard of half a mile from home  He lost in errors his vain heart prefers  She safe in the simplicity of hers  Not many wise rich noble or profound  In science win one inch of heav'nly ground  And is it not a mortifying thought  The poor should gain it and the rich should not  Nothe voluptuaries who ne'er forget  One pleasure lost lose heav'n without regret  Regret would rouse them and give birth to pray'r  Pray'r would add faith and faith would fix them there  Not that the Former of us all in this  Or aught he does is govern'd by caprice  The supposition is replete with sin  And bears the brand of blasphemy burnt in  Not sothe silver trumpet's heav'nly call  Sounds for the poor but sounds alike for all  Kings are invited and would kings obey  No slaves on earth more welcome were than they  But royalty nobility and state  Are such a dead preponderating weight  That endless bliss how strange soe'er it seem  In counterpoise flies up and kicks the beam  'Tis open and ye cannot enterwhy  Because ye will not Conyers would reply  And he says much that many may dispute  And cavil at with ease but none refute  Oh bless'd effect of penury and want  The seed sown there how vigorous is the plant  No soil like poverty for growth divine  As leanest land supplies the richest wine  Earth gives too little giving only bread  To nourish pride or turn the weakest head  To them the sounding jargon of the schools  Seems what it is a cap and bells for fools  The light they walk by kindled from above  Shows them the shortest way to life and love  They strangers to the controversial field  Where deists always foil'd yet scorn to yield  And never check'd by what impedes the wise  Believe rush forward and possess the prize  Envy ye great the dull unletter'd small  Ye have much cause for envybut not all  We boast some rich ones whom the gospel sways  And one that wears a coronet and prays  Like gleanings of an olive tree they show  Here and there one upon the topmost bough  How readily upon the gospel plan  That question has its answerwhat is man  Sinful and weak in ev'ry sense a wretch  An instrument whose chords upon the stretch  And strain'd to the last screw that he can bear  Yield only discord in his maker's ear  Once the blest residence of truth divine  Glorious as Solyma's interior shrine  Where in his own oracular abode  Dwelt visibly the lightcreating God  But made long since like Babylon of old  A den of mischiefs never to be told  And she once mistress of the realms around  Now scatter'd wide and no where to be found  As soon shall rise and reascend the throne  By native pow'r and energy her own  As nature at her own peculiar cost  Restore to man the glories he has lost  Go bid the winter cease to chill the year  Replace the wand'ring comet in his sphere  Then boast but wait for that unhop'dfor hour  The selfrestoring arm of human pow'r  But what is man in his own proud esteem  Hear him himself the poet and the theme  A monarch cloath'd with majesty and awe  His mind his kingdom and his will his law  Grace in his mien and glory in his eyes  Supreme on earth and worthy of the skies  Strength in his heart dominion in his nod  And thunderbolts excepted quite a God  So sings he charm'd with his own mind and form  The song magnificent the theme a worm  Himself so much the source of his delight  His maker has no beauty in his sight  See where he sits contemplative and fixt  Pleasure and wonder in his features mixt  His passions tam'd and all at his controul  How perfect the composure of his soul  Complacency has breath'd a gentle gale  O'er all his thoughts and swell'd his easy sail  His books well trimm'd and in the gayest stile  Like regimented coxcombs rank and file  Adorn his intellects as well as shelves  And teach him notions splendid as themselves  The bible only stands neglected there  Though that of all most worthy of his care  And like an infant troublesome awake  Is left to sleep for peace and quiet sake  What shall the man deserve of human kind  Whose happy skill and industry combin'd  Shall prove what argument could never yet  The bible an imposture and a cheat  The praises of the libertine profess'd  The worst of men and curses of the best  Where should the living weeping o'er his woes  The dying trembling at their awful close  Where the betray'd forsaken and oppress'd  The thousands whom the world forbids to rest  Where should they find those comforts at an end  The scripture yields or hope to find a friend  Sorrow might muse herself to madness then  And seeking exile from the sight of men  Bury herself in solitude profound  Grow frantic with her pangs and bite the ground  Thus often unbelief grown sick of life  Flies to the tempting pool or felon knife  The jury meet the coroner is short  And lunacy the verdict of the court  Reverse the sentence let the truth be known  Such lunacy is ignorance alone  They knew not what some bishops may not know  That scripture is the only cure of woe  That field of promise how it flings abroad  Its odour o'er the Christians thorny road  The soul reposing on assur'd relief  Feels herself happy amidst all her grief  Forgets her labour as she toils along  Weeps tears of joy and bursts into a song  But the same word that like the polish'd share  Ploughs up the roots of a believer's care  Kills too the flow'ry weeds wheree'r they grow  That bind the sinner's Bacchanalian brow  Oh that unwelcome voice of heav'nly love  Sad messenger of mercy from above  How does it grate upon his thankless ear  Crippling his pleasures with the cramp of fear  His will and judgment at continual strife  That civil war imbitters all his life  In vain he points his pow'rs against the skies  In vain he closes or averts his eyes  Truth will intrudeshe bids him yet beware  And shakes the sceptic in the scorner's chair  Though various foes against the truth combine  Pride above all opposes her design  Pride of a growth superior to the rest  The subtlest serpent with the loftiest crest  Swells at the thought and kindling into rage  Would hiss the cherub mercy from the stage  And is the soul indeed so lost she cries  Fall'n from her glory and too weak to rise  Torpid and dull beneath a frozen zone  Has she no spark that may be deem'd her own  Grant her indebted to what zealots call  Grace undeserv'd yet surely not for all  Some beams of rectitude she yet displays  Some love of virtue and some pow'r to praise  Can lift herself above corporeal things  And soaring on her own unborrow'd wings  Possess herself of all that's good or true  Assert the skies and vindicate her due  Past indiscretion is a venial crime  And if the youth unmellow'd yet by time  Bore on his branch luxuriant then and rude  Fruits of a blighted size austere and crude  Maturer years shall happier stores produce  And meliorate the well concocted juice  Then conscious of her meritorious zeal  To justice she may make her bold appeal  And leave to mercy with a tranquil mind  The worthless and unfruitful of mankind  Hear then how mercy slighted and defied  Retorts th' affront against the crown of pride  Perish the virtue as it ought abhorr'd  And the fool with it that insults his Lord  Th' atonement a Redeemer's love has wrought  Is not for you▪ the  ighteous need it not  ooing all she meets  of the public streets  Herself from morn to night from night to morn  Her own abhorrence and as much your scorn  The gracious show'r unlimited and free  Shall fall on her when heav'n denies it thee  Of all that wisdom dictates this the drift  That man is dead in sin and life a gift  Is virtue then unless of christian growth  Mere fallacy or foolishness or both  Ten thousand sages lost in endless woe  For ignorance of what they could not know  That speech betrays at once a bigot's tongue  Charge not a God with such outrageous wrong  Truly not Ithe partial light men have  My creed persuades me well employed may save  While he that scorns the noonday beam perverse  Shall find the blessing unimprov'd a curse  Let heathen worthies whose exalted mind  Left sensuality and dross behind  Possess for me their undisputed lot  And take unenvied the reward they sought  But still in virtue of a Savior's plea  Not blind by choice but destin'd not to see  Their fortitude and wisdom were a flame  Celestial though they knew not whence it came  Deriv'd from the same source of light and grace  That guides the christian in his swifter race  Their judge was conscience and her rule their law  That rule pursued with rev'rence and with awe  Led them however fault'ring faint and slow  From what they knew to what they wish'd to know  But let not him that shares a brighter day  Traduce the splendor of a noontide ray  Prefer the twilight of a darker time  And deem his base stupidity no crime  The wretch that slights the bounty of the skies  And sinks while favour'd with the means to rise  Shall find them rated at their full amount  The good he scorn'd all carried to account  Marshalling all his terrors as he came  Thunder and earthquake and devouring flame  From Sinai's top Jehovah gave the law  Life for obedience death for ev'ry flaw  When the great sov'reign would his will express  He gives a perfect rule what can he less  And guards it with a sanction as severe  As vengeance can inflict or sinners fear  Else his own glorious rights he would disclaim  And man might safely trifle with his name  He bids him glow with unremitting love  To all on earth and to himself above  Condemns th' injurious deed the sland'rous tongue  The thought that meditates a brother's wrong  Brings not alone the more conspicuous part  His conduct to the test but tries his heart  Hark universal nature shook and groan'd  'Twas the last trumpetsee the judge enthron'd  Rouse all your courage at your utmost need  Now summon ev'ry virtue stand and plead  What silent Is your boasting heard no more  That selfrenouncing wisdom learn'd before  Had shed immortal glories on your brow  That all your virtues cannot purchase now  All joy to the believer He can speak  Trembling yet happy confident yet meek  Since the dear hour that brought me to thy foot  And cut up all my follies by the root  I never trusted in an arm but thine  Nor hop'd but in thy righteousness divine  My pray'rs and alms imperfect and defil'd  Were but the feeble efforts of a child  Howe'er perform'd it was their brightest part  That they proceeded from a grateful heart  Cleans'd in thine own allpurifying blood  Forgive their evil and accept their good  I cast them at thy feetmy only plea  Is what it was dependence upon thee  While struggling in the vale of tears below  That never fail'd nor shall it fail me now  Angelic gratulations rend the skies  Pride falls unpitied never more to rise  Humility is crown'd and faith receives the prize  EXPOSTULATION  Tantane tam patiens nullo certamine tolli  Dona sines  VIRG  WHY weeps the muse for England  What appears  In England's case to move the muse to tears  From side to side of her delightful isle  Is she not cloath'd with a perpetual smile  Can nature add a charm or art confer  A new found luxury not seen in her  Where under heav'n is pleasure more pursued  Or where does cold reflection less intrude  Her fields a rich expanse of wavy corn  Pour'd out from plenty's overflowing horn  Ambrosial gardens in which art supplies  The fervor and the force of Indian skies  Her peaceful shores where busy commerce waits  To pour his golden tide through all her gates  Whom fiery suns that scorch the russet spice  Of eastern groves and oceans floor'd with ice  Forbid in vain to push his daring way  To darker climes or climes of brighter day  Whom the winds waft where'er the billows roll  From the world's girdle to the frozen pole  The chariots bounding in her wheelworn streets  Her vaults below where ev'ry vintage meets  Her theatres her revels and her sports  The scenes to which not youth alone resorts  But age in spite of weakness and of pain  Still haunts in hope to dream of youth again  All speak her happylet the muse look round  From East to West no sorrow can be found  Or only what in cottages confin'd  Sighs unregarded to the passing wind  Then wherefore weep for England what appears  In England's case to move the muse to tears  The prophet wept for Israel wish'd his eyes  Were fountains fed with infinite supplies  For Israel dealt in robbery and wrong  There were the scorner's and the sland'rer's tongue  Oaths used as playthings or convenient tools  As Int'rest biass'd knaves or fashion fools  Adult'ry neighing at his neighbour's door  Oppression labouring hard to grind the poor  The partial balance and deceitsul weight  The treach'rous smile a mask for secret hate  Hypocrisy formality in pray'r  And the dull service of the lip were there  Her women insolent and selfcaress'd  By vanity's unwearied finger dress'd  Forgot the blush that virgin fears impart  To modest cheeks and borrowed one from art  Were just such trifles without worth or use  As silly pride and idleness produce  Curl'd scented furbelow'd and flounc'd around  With feet too delicate to touch the ground  They stretch'd the neck and roll'd the wanton eye  And sigh'd for ev'ry fool that flutter'd by  He saw his people slaves to ev'ry lust  Lewd avaricious arrogant unjust  He heard the wheels of an avenging God  Groan heavily along the distant road  Saw Babylon set wide her two leav'd brass  To let the military deluge pass  Jerusalem a prey her glory soil'd  Her princes captive and her treasures spoil'd  Wept till all Israel heard his bitter cry  Stamp'd with his foot and smote upon his thigh  But wept and stamp'd and smote his thigh in vain  Pleasure is deaf when told of future pain  And sounds prophetic are too rough to suit  Ears long accustom'd to the pleasing lute  They scorn'd his inspiration and his theme  Pronounc'd him frantic and his fears a dream  With selfindulgence wing'd the fleeting hours  Till the foe found them and down fell the tow'rs  Long time Assyria bound them in her chain  Till penitence had purg'd the public stain  And Cyrus with relenting pity mov'd  Return'd them happy to the land they lov'd  There proof against prosperity awhile  They stood the test of her ensnaring smile  And had the grace in scenes of peace to show  The virtue they had learn'd in scenes of woe  But man is frail and can but ill sustain  A long immunity from grief and pain  And after all the joys that plenty leads  With tiptoe step vice silently succeeds  When he that rul'd them with a shepherd's rod  In form a man in dignity a God  Came not expected in that humble guise  To sift aud search them with unerring eyes  He found conceal'd beneath a fair outside  The filth of rottenness and worm of pride  Their piety a system of deceit  Scripture employ'd to sanctify the cheat  The pharisee the dupe of his own art  Selfidolized and yet a knave at heart  When nations are to perish in their sins  'Tis in the church the leprosy begins  The priest whose office is with zeal sincere  To watch the fountain and preserve it clear  Carelessly nods and sleeps upon the brink  While others poison what the flock must drink  Or waking at the call of lust alone  Infuses lies and errors of his own  His unsuspecting sheep believe it pure  And tainted by the very means of cure  Catch from each other a contagious spot  The foul forerunner of a general rot  Then truth is hush'd that heresy may preach  And all is trash that reason cannot reach  Then God's own image on the soul impress'd  Becomes a mock'ry and a standing jest  And faith the root whence only can arise  The graces of a life that wins the skies  Loses at once all value and esteem  Pronounc'd by gray beards a pernicious dream  Then ceremony leads her bigots forth  Prepar'd to fight for shadows of no worth  While truths on which eternal things depend  Find not or hardly find a single friend  As soldiers watch the signal of command  They learn to bow to kneel to sit to stand  Happy to fill religion's vacant place  With hollow form and gesture and grimace  Such when the teacher of his church was there  People and priest the sons of Israel were  Stiff in the letter lax in the design  And import of their oracles divine  Their learning legendary false absurd  And yet exalted above God's own word  They drew a curse from an intended good  Puff'd up with gifts they never understood  He judg'd them with as terrible a frown  As if not love but wrath had brought him down  Yet he was gentle as soft summer airs  Had grace for other sins but none for theirs  Through all he spoke a noble plainness ran  Rhet'ric is artifice the work of man  And tricks and turns that fancy may devise  Are far too mean for him that rules the skies  Th' astonish'd vulgar trembl'd while he tore  The mask from faces never seen before  He stripp'd th' impostors in the noonday sun  Show'd that they follow'd all they seem'd to shun  Their pray'rs made public their excesses kept  As private as the chambers where they slept  The temple and its holy rites profan'd  By mumm'ries he that dwelt in it disdain'd  Uplifted hands that at convenient times  Could act extortion and the worst of crimes  Wash'd with a neatness scrupulously nice  And free from ev'ry taint but that of vice  Judgment however tardy mends her pace  When obstinacy once has conquer'd grace  They saw distemper heal'd and life restor'd  In answer to the fiat of his word  Confess'd the wonder and with daring tongue  Blasphem'd th' authority from which it sprung  They knew by sure prognostics seen on high  The future tone and temper of the sky  But grave dissemblers could not understand  That sin let loose speaks punishment at hand  Ask now of history's authentic page  And call up evidence from ev'ry age  Display with busy and laborious hand  The blessings of the most indebted land  What nation will you find whose annals prove  So rich an int'rest in almighty love  Where dwell they now where dwelt in antient day  A people planted water'd blest as they  Let Egypt's plagues and Canaan's woes proclaim  The favours pour'd upon the Jewish name  Their freedom purchas'd for them at the cost  Of all their hard oppressors valued most  Their title to a country not their own  Made sure by prodigies 'till then unknown  For them the state they left made waste and void  For them the states to which they went destroy'd  A cloud to measure out their march by day  By night a fire to cheer the gloomy way  That moving signal summoning when best  Their host to move and when it stay'd to rest  For them the rocks dissolv'd into a flood  The dews condens'd into angelic food  Their very garments sacred old yet new  And time forbid to touch them as he flew  Streams swell'd above the bank enjoin'd to stand  While they pass'd through to their appointed land  Their leader arm'd with meekness zeal and love  And grac'd with clear credentials from above  Themselves secur'd beneath th' Almighty wing  Their God their captain  Vide Joshua v  lawgiver and king  Crown'd with a thousand vict'ries and at last  Lords of the conquer'd soil there rooted fast  In peace possessing what they won by war  Their name far publish'd and rever'd as far  Where will you find a race like theirs endow'd  With all that man e'er wish'd or Heav'n bestow'd  They and they only amongst all mankind  Receiv'd the transcript of th' eternal mind  Were trusted with his own engraven laws  And constituted guardians of his cause  Theirs were the prophets theirs the priestly call  And theirs by birth the Saviour of us all  In vain the nations that had seen them rise  With fierce and envious yet admiring eyes  Had sought to crush them guarded as they were  By power divine and skill that could not err  Had they maintain'd allegiance firm and sure  And kept the faith immaculate and pure  Then the proud eagles of allconqu'ring Rome  Had found one city not to be o'ercome  And the twelve standards of the tribes unfurl'd  Had bid defiance to the warring world  But grace abus'd brings forth the foulest deeds  As richest soil the most luxuriant weeds  Cur'd of the golden calves their fathers sin  They set up self that idol god within  View'd a Deliv'rer with disdain and hate  Who left them still a tributary state  Seiz'd fast his hand held out to set them free  From a worse yoke and nail'd it to the tree  There was the consummation and the crown  The flow'r of Israel's infamy full blown  Thence date their sad declension and their fall  Their woes not yet repeal'd thence date them all  Thus fell the best instructed in her day  And the most favor'd land look where we may  Philosophy indeed on Grecian eyes  Had pour'd the day and clear'd the Roman skies  In other climes perhaps creative art  With pow'r surpassing theirs perform'd her part  Might give more life to marble or might fill  The glowing tablets with a juster skill  Might shine in fable and grace idle themes  With all th' embroid'ry of poetic dreams  'Twas theirs alone to dive into the plan  That truth and mercy had reveal'd to man  And while the world beside that plan unknown  Deified useless wood or senseless stone  They breath'd in faith their welldirected pray'rs  And the true God the God of truth was theirs  Their glory faded and their race dispers'd  The last of nations now though once the first  They warn and teach the proudest would they learn  Keep wisdom or meet vengeance in your turn  If we escap'd not if Heav'n spar'd not us  Peel'd scatter'd and exterminated thus  If vice receiv'd her retribution due  When we were visited what hope for you  When God arises with an awful frown  To punish lust or pluck presumption down  When gifts perverted or not duly priz'd  Pleasure o'ervalued and his grace despis'd  Provoke the vengeance of his righteous hand  To pour down wrath upon a thankless land  He will be found impartially severe  Too just to wink or speak the guilty clear  Oh Israel of all nations most undone  Thy diadem displac'd thy sceptre gone  Thy temple once thy glory fall'n and ras'd  And thou a worshipper e'en where thou mayst  Thy services once holy without spot  Mere shadows now their antient pomp forgot  Thy Levites once a consecrated host  No longer Levites and their lineage lost  And thou thyself o'er ev'ry country sown  With none on earth that thou canst call thine own  Cry aloud thou that sittest in the dust  Cry to the proud the cruel and unjust  Knock at the gates of nations rouse their fears  Say wrath is coming and the storm appears  But raise the shrillest cry in British ears  What ails thee restless as the waves that roar  And fling their foam against thy chalky shore  Mistress at least while Providence shall please  And tridentbearing queen of the wide seas  Why having kept good faith and often shown  Friendship and truth to others findst thou none  Thou that hast set the persecuted free  None interposes now to succour thee  Countries indebted to thy pow'r that shine  With light deriv'd from thee would smother thine  Thy very children watch for thy disgrace  A lawless brood and curse thee to thy face  Thy rulers load thy credit year by year  With sums Peruvian mines could never clear  As if like arches built with skilful hand  The more 'twere press'd the firmer it would stand  The cry in all thy ships is still the same  Speed us away to battle and to fame  Thy mariners explore the wild expanse  Impatient to descry the flags of France  But though they fight as thine have ever fought  Return asham'd without the wreaths they sought  Thy senate is a scene of civil jar  Chaos of contrarieties at war  Where sharp and solid phlegmatic and light  Discordant atoms meet ferment and fight  Where obstinacy takes his sturdy stand  To disconcert what policy has plann'd  Where policy is busied all night long  In setting right what faction has set wrong  Where flails of oratory thresh the floor  That yields them chaff and dust and nothing more  Thy rack'd inhabitants repine complain  Tax'd 'till the brow of labour sweats in vain  War lays a burthen on the reeling state  And peace does nothing to relieve the weight  Successive loads succeeding broils impose  And sighing millions prophecy the close  Is adverse providence when ponder'd well  So dimly writ or difficult to spell  Thou canst not read with readiness and ease  Providence adverse in events like these  Know then that heav'nly wisdom on this ball  Creates gives birth to guides consummates all  That while laborious and quickthoughted man  Snuffs up the praise of what he seems to plan  He first conceives then perfects his design  As a mere instrument in hands divine  Blind to the working of that secret pow'r  That balances the wings of ev'ry hour  The busy trifler dreams himself alone  Frames many a purpose and God works his own  States thrive or wither as moons wax and wane  Ev'n as his will and his decrees ordain  While honour virtue piety bear sway  They flourish and as these decline decay  In just resentment of his injur'd laws  He pours contempt on them and on their cause  Strikes the rough thread of error right athwart  The web of ev'ry scheme they have at heart  Bids rottenness invade and bring to dust  The pillars of support in which they trust  And do his errand of disgrace and shame  On the chief strength and glory of the frame  None ever yet impeded what he wrought  None bars him out from his most secret thought  Darkness itself before his eye is light  And Hell's close mischief naked in his sight  Stand now and judge thyselfhast thou incurr'd  His anger who can waste thee with a word  Who poises and proportions sea and land  Weighing them in the hollow of his hand  And in whose awful sight all nations seem  As grasshoppers as dust a drop a dream  Hast thou a sacrilege his soul abhors  Claim'd all the glory of thy prosp'rous wars  Proud of thy fleets and armies stol'n the gem  Of his just praise to lavish it on them  Hast thou not learn'd what thou art often told  A truth still sacred and believ'd of old  That no success attends on spears and swords  Unblest and that the battle is the Lord's  That courage is his creature and dismay  The post that at his bidding speeds away  Ghastly in feature and his stamm'ring tongue  With doleful rumor and sad presage hung  To quell the valor of the stoutest heart  And teach the combatant a woman's part  That he bids thousands fly when none pursue  Saves as he will by many or by few  And claims for ever as his royal right  Th' event and sure decision of the fight  Hast thou though suckl'd at fair freedom's breast  Exported slav'ry to the conquer'd East  Pull'd down the tyrants India serv'd with dread  And rais'd thyself a greater in their stead  Gone thither arm'd and hungry returned full  Fed from the richest veins of the Mogul  A despot big with pow'r obtain'd by wealth  And that obtain'd by rapine and by stealth  With Asiatic vices stor'd thy mind  But left their virtues and thine own behind  And having truck'd thy soul brought home the fee  To tempt the poor to sell himself to thee  Hast thou by statute shov'd from its design  The Savior's feast his own blest bread and wine  And made the symbols of atoning grace  An officekey a picklock to a place  That infidels may prove their title good  By an oath dipp'd in sacramental blood  A blot that will be still a blot in spite  Of all that grave apologists may write  And though a Bishop toil to cleanse the stain  He wipes and scours the silver cup in vain  And hast thou sworn on ev'ry slight pretence  'Till perjuries are common as bad pence  While thousands careless of the damning sin  Kiss the book's outside who ne'er look within  Hast thou when heav'n has cloath'd thee with disgrace  And long provok'd repaid thee to thy face  For thou hast known eclipses and endur'd  Dimness and anguish all thy beams obscur'd  When sin has shed dishonour on thy brow  And never of a sabler hue than now  Hast thou with heart perverse and conscience sear'd  Despising all rebuke still persever'd  And having chosen evil scorn'd the voice  That cried repentand gloried in thy choice  Thy fastings when calamity at last  Suggests th' expedient of an yearly fast  What mean they Canst thou dream there is a pow'r  In lighter diet at a later hour  To charm to sleep the threat'nings of the skies  And hide past folly from allseeing eyes  The fast that wins deliv'rance and suspends  The stroke that a vindictive God intends  Is to renounce hypocrisy to draw  Thy life upon the pattern of the law  To war with pleasures idolized before  To vanquish lust and wear its yoke no more  All fasting else whate'er be the pretence  Is wooing mercy by renew'd offence  Hast thou within thee sin that in old time  Brought fire from heav'n the sexabusing crime  Whose horrid perpetration stamps disgrace  Baboons are free from upon human race  Think on the fruitful and wellwater'd spot  That fed the flocks and herds of wealthy Lot  Where Paradise seem'd still vouchsaf'd on earth  Burning and scorch'd into perpetual dearth  Or in his words who damn'd the base desire  Suff'ring the vengeance of eternal fire  Then nature injur'd scandaliz'd defil'd  Unveil'd her blushing cheek look'd on and smil'd  Beheld with joy the lovely scene defac'd  And prais'd the wrath that lay'd her beauties waste  Far be the thought from any verse of mine  And farther still the form'd and fixt design  To thrust the charge of deeds that I detest  Against an innocent unconscious breast  The man that dares traduce because he can  With safety to himself is not a man  An individual is a sacred mark  Not to be pierc'd in play or in the dark  But public censure speaks a public foe  Unless a zeal for virtue guide the blow  The priestly brotherhood devout sincere  From mean selfint'rest and ambition clear  Their hope in Heav'n servility their scorn  Prompt to persuade expostulate and warn  Their wisdom pure and giv'n them from above  Their usefulness insur'd by zeal and love  As meek as the man Moses and withal  As bold as in Agrippa's presence Paul  Should fly the world's contaminating touch  Holy and unpollutedare thine such  Except a few with Eli's spirit blest  Hophni and Phineas may describe the rest  Where shall a teacher look in days like these  For ears and hearts that he can hope to please  Look to the poorthe simple and the plain  Will hear perhaps thy salutary strain  Humility is gentle apt to learn  Speak but the word will listen and return  Alas not so the poorest of the flock  Are proud and set their faces as a rock  Denied that earthly opulence they chuse  God's better gift they scoff at and refuse  The rich the produce of a nobler stem  Are more intelligent at least try them  Oh vain enquiry they without remorse  Are altogether gone a devious course  Where beck'ning pleasure leads them wildly stray  Have burst the bands and cast the yoke away  Now borne upon the wings of truth sublime  Review thy dim original and prime  This island spot of unreclaim'd rude earth  The cradle that receiv'd thee at thy birth  Was rock'd by many a rough Norwegian blast  And Danish howlings scar'd thee as they pass'd  For thou wast born amid the din of arms  And suck'd a breast that panted with alarms  While yet thou wast a grov'ling puling chit  Thy bones not fashion'd and thy joints not knit  The Roman taught thy stubborn knee to bow  Though twice a Caesar could not bend thee now  His victory was that of orient light  When the sun's shafts disperse the gloom of night  Thy language at this distant moment shows  How much the country to the conqu'ror owes  Expressive energetic and refin'd  It sparkles with the gems he left behind  He brought thy land a blessing when he came  He found thee savage and he left thee tame  Taught thee to cloath thy pink'd and painted hide  And grace thy figure with a soldier's pride  He sow'd the seeds of order where he went  Improv'd thee far beyond his own intent  And while he rul'd thee by the sword alone  Made thee at last a warrior like his own  Religion if in heav'nly truths attir'd  Needs only to be seen to be admir'd  But thine as dark as witch'ries of the night  Was form'd to harden hearts and shock the sight  Thy Druids struck the wellstrung harps they bore  With fingers deeply dy'd in human gore  And while the victim slowly bled to death  Upon the tolling chords rung out his dying breath  Who brought the lamp that with awak'ning beams  Dispell'd thy gloom and broke away thy dreams  Tradition now decrepid and worn out  Babbler of antient fables leaves a doubt  But still light reach'd thee and those gods of thine  Woden and Thor each tott'ring in his shrine  Fell broken and defac'd at his own door  As Dagon in Philistia long before  But Rome with sorceries and magic wand  Soon rais'd a cloud that darken'd ev'ry land  And thine was smother'd in the stench and fog  Of Tiber's marshes and the papal bog  Then priests with bulls and briefs and shaven crowns  And griping fists and unrelenting frowns  Legates and delegates with pow'rs from hell  Though heav'nly in pretension fleec'd thee well  And to this hour to keep it fresh in mind  Some twigs of that old scourge are left behind  Which may be found at Doctors Common  Thy soldiery the pope's wellmanag'd pack  Were train'd beneath his lash and knew the smack  And when he laid them on the scent of blood  Would hunt a Saracen through fire and flood  Lavish of life to win an empty tomb  That prov'd a mint of wealth a mine to Rome  They left their bones beneath unfriendly skies  His worthless absolution all the prize  Thou wast the veriest slave in days of yore  That ever dragg'd a chain or tugg'd an oar  Thy monarchs arbitrary fierce unjust  Themselves the slaves of bigotry or lust  Disdain'd thy counsels only in distress  Found thee a goodly spunge for pow'r to press  Thy chiefs the lords of many a petty fee  Provok'd and harrass'd in return plagu'd thee  Call'd thee away from peaceable employ  Domestic happiness and rural joy  To waste thy life in arms or lay it down  In causeless feuds and bick'rings of their own  Thy parliaments ador'd on bended knees  The sov'reignty they were conven'd to please  Whate'er was ask'd too timid to resist  Comply'd with and were graciously dismiss'd  And if some Spartan soul a doubt express'd  And blushing at the tameness of the rest  Dar'd to suppose the subject had a choice  He was a traitor by the gen'ral voice  Oh slave with pow'rs thou didst not dare exert  Verse cannot stoop so low as thy desert  It shakes the sides of splenetic disdain  Thou selfentitled ruler of the main  To trace thee to the date when yon fair sea  That clips thy shores had no such charms for thee  When other nations flew from coast to coast  And thou hadst neither fleet nor flag to boast  Kneel now and lay thy forehead in the dust  Blush if thou canst not petrified thou must  Act but an honest and a faithful part  Compare what then thou wast with what thou art  And God's disposing providence confess'd  Obduracy itself must yield the rest  Then thou art bound to serve him and to prove  Hour after hour thy gratitude and love  Has he not hid thee and thy favour'd land  For ages safe beneath his shelt'ring hand  Giv'n thee his blessing on the clearest proof  Bid nations leagu'd against thee stand aloof  And charg'd hostility and hate to roar  Where else they would but not upon thy shore  His pow'r secur'd thee when presumptuous Spain  Baptiz'd her fleet invincible in vain  Her gloomy monarch doubtful and resign'd  To ev'ry pang that racks an anxious mind  Ask'd of the waves that broke upon his coast  What tidings and the surge repliedall lost  And when the Stuart leaning on the Scot  Then too much fear'd and now too much forgot  Pierc'd to the very center of thy realm  And hop'd to seize his abdicated helm  'Twas but to prove how quickly with a frown  He that had rais'd thee could have pluck'd thee down  Peculiar is the grace by thee possess'd  Thy foes implacable thy land at rest  Thy thunders travel over earth and seas  And all at home is pleasure wealth and ease  'Tis thus extending his tempestuous arm  Thy Maker fills the nations with alarm  While his own Heav'n surveys the troubled scene  And feels no change unshaken and serene  Freedom in other lands scarce known to shine  Pours out a flood of splendour upon thine  Thou hast as bright an int'rest in her rays  As ever Roman had in Rome's best days  True freedom is where no restraint is known  That scripture justice and good sense disown  Where only vice and injury are tied  And all from shore to shore is free beside  Such freedom isand Windsor's hoary tow'rs  Stood trembling at the boldness of thy pow'rs  That won a nymph on that immortal plain  Like her the fabled Phoebus woo'd in vain  He found the laurel onlyhappier you  Th' unfading laurel and the virgin too  Alluding to the grant of Magna Charta which was extorted from king John by the Barons at Runnymede near Windsor  Now think if pleasure have a thought to spare  If God himself be not beneath her care  If bus'ness constant as the wheels of time  Can pause one hour to read a serious rhime  If the new mail thy merchants now receive  Or expectation of the next give leave  Oh think if chargeable with deep arrears  For such indulgence gilding all thy years  How much though long neglected shining yet  The beams of heav'nly truth have swell'd the debt  When persecuting zeal made royal sport  With tortur'd innocence in Mary's court  And Bonner blithe as shepherd at a wake  Enjoy'd the show and danc'd about the stake  The sacred book its value understood  Receiv'd the seal of martyrdom in blood  Those holy men so full of truth and grace  Seem to reflection of a diff'rent race  Meek modest venerable wise sincere  In such a cause they could not dare to fear  They could not purchase earth with such a prize  Nor spare a life too short to reach the skies  From them to thee convey'd along the tide  Their streaming hearts pour'd freely when they died  Those truths which neither use nor years impair  Invite thee wooe thee to the bliss they share  What dotage will not vanity maintain  What web too weak to catch a modern brain  The moles and bats in full assembly find  On special search the keeney'd eagle blind  And did they dream and art thou wiser now  Prove itif better I submit and bow  Wisdom and goodness are twinborn one heart  Must hold both sisters never seen apart  So thenas darkness overspread the deep  'Ere nature rose from her eternal sleep  And this delightful earth and that fair sky  Leap'd out of nothing call'd by the Most High  By such a change thy darkness is made light  Thy chaos order and thy weakness might  And he whose pow'r mere nullity obeys  Who found thee nothing form'd thee for his praise  To praise him is to serve him and fulfil  Doing and suff'ring his unquestion'd will  'Tis to believe what men inspir'd of old  Faithful and faithfully inform'd unfold  Candid and just with no false aim in view  To take for truth what cannot but be true  To learn in God's own school the Christian part  And bind the task assign'd thee to thine heart  Happy the man there seeking and there found  Happy the nation where such men abound  How shall a verse impress thee by what name  Shall I adjure thee not to court thy shame  By theirs whose bright example unimpeach'd  Directs thee to that eminence they reach'd  Heroes and worthies of days past thy sires  Or his who touch'd their hearts with hallow'd fires  Their names alas in vain reproach an age  Whom all the vanities they scorn'd engage  And his that seraphs tremble at is hung  Disgracefully on ev'ry trifler's tongue  Or serves the champion in forensic war  To flourish and parade with at the bar  Pleasure herself perhaps suggests a plea  If int'rest move thee to persuade ev'n thee  By ev'ry charm that smiles upon her face  By joys possess'd and joys still held in chace  If dear society be worth a thought  And if the feast of freedom cloy thee not  Reflect that these and all that seems thine own  Held by the tenure of his will alone  Like angels in the service of their Lord  Remain with thee or leave thee at his word  That gratitude and temp'rance in our use  Of what he gives unsparing and profuse  Secure the favour and enhance the joy  That thankless waste and wild abuse destroy  But above all reflect how cheap soe'er  Those rights that millions envy thee appear  And though resolv'd to risk them and swim down  The tide of pleasure heedless of his frown  That blessings truly sacred and when giv'n  Mark'd with the signature and stamp of Heav'n  The word of prophecy those truths divine  Which make that Heav'n if thou desire it thine  Awful alternative believ'd belov'd  Thy glory and thy shame if unimprov'd  Are never long vouchsaf'd if push'd aside  With cold disgust or philosophic pride  And that judicially withdrawn disgrace  Error and darkness occupy their place  A world is up in arms and thou a spot  Not quickly found if negligently sought  Thy soul as ample as thy bounds are small  Endur'st the brunt and dar'st defy them all  And wilt thou join to this bold enterprize  A bolder still a contest with the skies  Remember if he guard thee and secure  Whoe'er assails thee thy success is sure  But if he leave thee though the skill and pow'r  Of nations sworn to spoil thee and devour  Were all collected in thy single arm  And thou couldst laugh away the fear of harm  That strength would fail oppos'd against the push  And feeble onset of a pigmy rush  Say not and if the thought of such defence  Should spring within thy bosom drive it thence  What nation amongst all my foes is free  From crimes as base as any charg'd on me  Their measure fill'dthey too shall pay the debt  Which God though long forborn will not forget  But know that wrath divine when most severe  Makes justice still the guide of his career  And will not punish in one mingled crowd  Them without light and thee without a cloud  Muse hang this harp upon yon aged beech  Still murm'ring with the solemn truths I teach  And while at intervals a cold blast sings  Through the dry leaves and pants upon the strings  My soul shall sigh in secret and lament  A nation scourg'd yet tardy to repent  I know the warning song is sung in vain  That few will hear and fewer heed the strain  But if a fweeter voice and one design'd  A blessing to my country and mankind  Reclaim the wand'ring thousands and bring home  A flock so scatter'd and so wont to roam  Then place it once again between my knees  The sound of truth will then be sure to please  And truth alone where'er my life be cast  In scenes of plenty or the pining waste  Shall be my chosen theme my glory to the last  HOPE  doceas iter et sacra ostia pandas  VIRG EN  ASK what is human lifethe sage replies  With disappointment low'ring in his eyes  A painful passage o'er a restless flood  A vain pursuit of fugitive false good  A scene of fancied bliss and heartfelt care  Closing at last in darkness and despair  The poor inur'd to drudgery and distress  Act without aim think little and feel less  And no where but in feign'd Arcadian scenes  Taste happiness or know what pleasure means  Riches are pass'd away from hand to hand  As fortune vice or folly may command  As in a dance the pair that take the lead  Turn downward and the lowest pair succeed  So shifting and so various is the plan  By which Heav'n rules the mixt affairs of man  Vicissitude wheels round the motley crowd  The rich grow poor the poor become purseproud  Bus'ness is labour and man's weakness such  Pleasure is labour too and tires as much  The very sense of it foregoes its use  By repetition pall'd by age obtuse  Youth lost in dissipation we deplore  Through life's sad remnant what no sighs restore  Our years a fruitless race without a prize  Too many yet too few to make us wise  Dangling his cane about and taking snuff  Lothario cries what philosophic stuff  Oh querulous and weak whose useless brain  Once thought of nothing and now thinks in vain  Whose eye reverted weeps o'er all the past  Whose prospect shows thee a disheartning waste  Would age in thee resign his wintry reign  And youth invigorate that frame again  Renew'd desire would grace with other speech  Joys always priz'd when plac'd within our reach  For lift thy palsied head shake off the gloom  That overhangs the borders of thy tomb  See nature gay as when she first began  With smiles alluring her admirer man  She spreads the morning over eastern hills  Earth glitters with the drops the night distils  The sun obedient at her call appears  To fling his glories o'er the robe she wears  Banks cloath'd with flow'rs groves fill'd with sprightly sounds  The yellow tilth green meads rocks rising grounds  Streams edg'd with osiers fatt'ning ev'ry field  Where'er they flow now seen and now conceal'd  From the blue rim where skies and mountains meet  Down to the very turf beneath thy feet  Ten thousand charms that only fools despise  Or pride can look at with indiff'rent eyes  All speak one language all with one sweet voice  Cry to her universal realm rejoice  Man feels the spur of passions and desires  And she gives largely more than he requires  Not that his hours devoted all to care  Hollowey'd abstinence and lean despair  The wretch may pine while to his smell taste sight  She holds a Paradise of rich delight  But gently to rebuke his aukward fear  To prove that what she gives she gives sincere  To banish hesitation and proclaim  His happiness her dear her only aim  'Tis grave philosophy's absurdest dream  That Heav'n's intentions are not what they seem  That only shadows are dispens'd below  And earth has no reality but woe  Thus things terrestrial wear a diff'rent hue  As youth or age persuades and neither true  So Flora's wreath through colour'd chrystal seen  The rose or lily appears blue or green  But still th' imputed tints are those alone  The medium represents and not their own  To rise at noon sit slipshod and undress'd  To read the news or fiddle as seems best  'Till half the world comes rattling at his door  To fill the dull vacuity 'till four  And just when evening turns the blue vault grey  To spend two hours in dressing for the day  To make the sun a bauble without use  Save for the fruits his heav'nly beams produce  Quite to forget or deem it worth no thought  Who bids him shine or if he shine or not  Through mere necessity to close his eyes  Just when the larks and when the shepherds rise  Is such a life so tediously the same  So void of all utility or aim  That poor JONQUIL with almost ev'ry breath  Sighs for his exit vulgarly call'd death  For he with all his follies has a mind  Not yet so blank or fashionably blind  But now and then perhaps a feeble ray  Of distant wisdom shoots across his way  By which he reads that life without a plan  As useless as the moment it began  Serves merely as a soil for discontent  To thrive in an incumbrance e'er half spent  Oh weariness beyond what asses feel  That tread the circuit of the cistern wheel  A dull rotation never at a stay  Yesterday's face twin image of today  While conversation an exhausted stock  Grows drowsy as the clicking of a clock  No need he cries of gravity stuff'd out  With academic dignity devout  To read wise lectures vanity the text  Proclaim the remedy ye learned next  For truth selfevident with pomp impress'd  Is vanity surpassing all the rest  That remedy not hid in deeps profound  Yet seldom sought where only to be found  While passion turns aside from its due scope  Th' enquirer's aim that remedy is hope  Life is his gift from whom whate'er life needs  And ev'ry good and perfect gift proceeds  Bestow'd on man like all that we partake  Royally freely for his bounty sake  Transient indeed as is the fleeting hour  And yet the seed of an immortal flow'r  Design'd in honour of his endless love  To fill with fragrance his abode above  No trifle howsoever short it seem  And howsoever shadowy no dream  Its value what no thought can ascertain  Nor all an angel's eloquence explain  Men deal with life as children with their play  Who first misuse then cast their toys away  Live to no sober purpose and contend  That their creator had no serious end  When God and man stand opposite in view  Man's disappointment must of course ensue  The just Creator condescends to write  In beams of inextinguishable light  His names of wisdom goodness pow'r and love  On all that blooms below or shines above  To catch the wand'ring notice of mankind  And teach the world if not perversely blind  His gracious attributes and prove the share  His offspring hold in his paternal care  If led from earthly things to things divine  His creature thwart not his august design  Then praise is heard instead of reas'ning pride  And captious cavil and complaint subside  Nature employ'd in her allotted place  Is handmaid to the purposes of grace  By good vouchsaf'd makes known superior good  And bliss not seen by blessings understood  That bliss reveal'd in scripture with a glow  Bright as the covenantinsuring bow  Fires all his feelings with a noble scorn  Of sensual evil and thus hope is born  Hope sets the stamp of vanity on all  That men have deem'd substantial since the fall  Yet has the wond'rous virtue to educe  From emptiness itself a real use  And while she takes as at a father's hand  What health and sober appetite demand  From fading good derives with chymic art  That lasting happiness a thankful heart  Hope with uplifted foot set free from earth  Pants for the place of her ethereal birth  On steady wing sails through th' immense abyss  Plucks amaranthin joys from bow'rs of bliss  And crowns the soul while yet a mourner here  With wreaths like those triumphant spirits wear  Hope as an anchor firm and sure holds fast  The Christian vessel and defies the blast  Hope nothing else can nourish and secure  His newborn virtues and preserve him pure  Hope let the wretch once conscious of the joy  Whom now despairing agonies destroy  Speak for he can and none so well as he  What treasures center what delights in thee  Had he the gems the spices and the land  That boasts the treasure all at his command  The fragrant grove th' inestimable mine  Were light when weigh'd against one smile of thine  Though clasp'd and cradl'd in his nurse's arms  He shine with all a cherub's artless charms  Man is the genuine offspring of revolt  Stubborn and sturdy a wild ass's colt  His passions like the wat'ry stores that sleep  Beneath the smiling surface of the deep  Wait but the lashes of a wintry storm  To frown and roar and shake his feeble form  From infancy through childhood's giddy maze  Froward at school and fretful in his plays  The puny tyrant burns to subjugate  The free republic of the whipgig state  If one his equal in athletic frame  Or more provoking still of nobler name  Dares step across his arbitrary views  An Iliad only not in verse ensues  The little Greeks look trembling at the scales  'Till the best tongue or heaviest hand prevails  Now see him launched into the world at large  If priest supinely droning o'er his charge  Their fleece his pillow and his weekly drawl  Though short too long the price he pays for all  If lawyer loud whatever cause he plead  But proudest of the worst if that succeed  Perhaps a grave physician gath'ring fees  Punctually paid for length'ning out disease  No COTTON whose humanity sheds rays  That make superior skill his second praise  If arms engage him he devotes to sport  His date of life so likely to be short  A soldier may be any thing if brave  So may a tradesman if not quite a knave  Such stuff the world is made of and mankind  To passion int'rest pleasure whim resign'd  Insist on as if each were his own pope  Forgiveness and the privilege of hope  But conscience in some awful silent hour  When captivating lusts have lost their pow'r  Perhaps when sickness or some fearful dream  Reminds him of religion hated theme  Starts from the down on which she lately slept  And tells of laws despis'd at least not kept  Shows with a pointing finger and no noise  A pale procession of past sinful joys  All witnesses of blessings foully scorn'd  And life abus'dand not to be suborn'd  Mark these she says these summoned from afar  Begin their march to meet thee at the bar  There find a Judge inexorably just  And perish there as all presumption must  Peace be to those such peace as earth can give  Who live in pleasure dead ev'n while they live  Born capable indeed of heav'nly truth  But down to latest age from earliest youth  Their mind a wilderness through want of care  The plough of wisdom never ent'ring there  Peace if insensibility may claim  A right to the meek honours of her name  To men of pedigree their noble race  Emulous always of the nearest place  To any throne except the throne of grace  Let cottagers and unenlightened swains  Revere the laws they dream that heav'n ordains  Resort on Sundays to the house of pray'r  And ask and fancy they find blessings there  Themselves perhaps when weary they retreat  T' enjoy cool nature in a country seat  T' exchange the center of a thousand trades  For clumps and lawns and temples and cascades  May now and then their velvet cushions take  And seem to pray for good example sake  Judging in charity no doubt the town  Pious enough and having need of none  Kind souls to teach their tenantry to prize  What they themselves without remorse despise  Nor hope have they nor fear of aught to come  As well for them had prophecy been dumb  They could have held the conduct they pursue  Had Paul of Tarsus lived and died a Jew  And truth propos'd to reas'ners wise as they  Is a pearl castcompletely cast away  They dieDeath lends them pleas'd and as in sport  All the grim honours of his ghastly court  Far other paintings grace the chamber now  Where late we saw the mimic landscape glow  The busy heralds hang the sable scene  With mournful 'scutcheons and dim lamps between  Proclaim their titles to the crowd around  But they that wore them move not at the sound  The coronet placed idly at their head  Adds nothing now to the degraded dead  And ev'n the star that glitters on the bier  Can only say nobility lies here  Peace to all such'twere pity to offend  By useless censure whom we cannot mend  Life without hope can close but in despair  'Twas there we found them and must leave them there  As when two pilgrims in a forest stray  Both may be lost yet each in his own way  So fares it with the multitudes beguil'd  In vain opinion's waste and dang'rous wild  Ten thousand rove the brakes and thorns among  Some eastward and some westward and all wrong  But here alas the fatal diff'rence lies  Each man's belief is right in his own eyes  And he that blames what they have blindly chose  Incurs resentment for the love he shows  Say botanist within whose province fall  The cedar and the hyssop on the wall  Of all that deck the lanes the fields the bow'rs  What parts the kindred tribes of weeds and flow'rs  Sweet scent or lovely form or both combin'd  Distinguish ev'ry cultivated kind  The want of both denotes a meaner breed  And Chloe from her garland picks the weed  Thus hopes of every sort whatever sect  Esteem them sow them rear them and protect  If wild in nature and not duly found  Gethsemane in thy dear hallowed ground  That cannot bear the blaze of scripture light  Nor cheer the spirit nor refresh the sight  Nor animate the soul to Christian deeds  Oh cast them from thee are weeds arrant weeds  Ethelred's house the center of six ways  Diverging each from each like equal rays  Himself as bountiful as April rains  Lord paramount of the surrounding plains  Would give relief of bed and board to none  But guests that sought it in th' appointed ONE  And they might enter at his open door  Ev'n till his spacious hall would hold no more  He sent a servant forth by ev'ry road  To sound his horn and publish it abroad  That all might mark knight menial high and low  An ord'nance it concern'd them much to know  If after all some headstrong hardy lowt  Would disobey though sure to be shut out  Could he with reason murmur at his case  Himself sole author of his own disgrace  No the decree was just and without flaw  And he that made had right to make the law  His sov'reign pow'r and pleasure unrestrain'd  The wrong was his who wrongfully complain'd  Yet half mankind maintain a churlish strife  With him the donor of eternal life  Because the deed by which his love confirms  The largess he bestows prescribes the terms  Compliance with his will your lot insures  Accept it only and the boon is yours  And sure it is as kind to smile and give  As with a frown to say do this and live  Love

That man will freely take an unbought bliss  Will trust him for a faithful gen'rous part  Nor set a price upon a willing heart  Of all the ways that seem to promise fair  To place you where his saints his presence share  This only canfor this plain cause express'd  In terms as plain himself has shut the rest  But oh the strife the bick'ring and debate  The tidings of unpurchas'd heav'n create  The flirted fan the bridle and the toss  All speakers yet all language at a loss  From stucco'd walls smart arguments rebound  And beaus adepts in ev'ry thing profound  Die of disdain or whistle off the sound  Such is the clamor of rooks daws and kites  Th' explosion of the levell'd tube excites  Where mould'ring abbeywalls o'erhang the glade  And oaks cooeval spread a mournful shade  The screaming nations hov'ring in mid air  Loudly resent the stranger's freedom there  And seem to warn him never to repeat  His bold intrusion on their dark retreat  Adieu Vinoso cries e'er yet he sips  The purple bumper trembling at his lips  Adieu to all morality if grace  Make works a vain ingredient in the case  The Christian hope iswaiter draw the cork  If I mistake notblockhead with a fork  Without good works whatever some may boast  Mere folly and delusionSir your toast  My firm persuasion is at least sometimes  That heav'n will weigh man's virtues and his crimes  With nice attention in a righteous scale  And save or damn as these or those prevail  I plant my foot upon this ground of trust  And silence every fear withGod is just  But if perchance on some dull drizzling day  A thought intrude that says or seems to say  If thus th' important cause is to be tried  Suppose the beam should dip on the wrong side  I soon recover from these needless frights  And God is mercifulsets all to rights  Thus between justice as my prime support  And mercy fled to as the last resort  I glide and steal along with heav'n in view  Andpardon me the bottle stands with you  I never will believe the col'nel cries  The sanguinary schemes that some devise  Who make the good Creator on their plan  A being of less equity than man  If appetite or what divines call lust  Which men comply with e'en because they must  Be punish'd with perdition who is pure  Then theirs no doubt as well as mine is sure  If sentence of eternal pain belong  To ev'ry sudden slip and transient wrong  Then heav'n enjoins the fallible and frail  An hopeless task and damns them if they fail  My creed whatever some creedmakers mean  By Athanasian nonsense or Nicene  My creed is he is safe that does his best  And death's a doom sufficient for the rest  Right says an ensign and for aught I see  Your faith and mine substantially agree  The best of ev'ry man's performance here  Is to discharge the duties of his sphere  A lawyer's dealing should be just and fair  Honesty shines with great advantage there  Fasting and pray'r sit well upon a priest  A decent caution and reserve at least  A soldier's best is courage in the field  With nothing here that wants to be conceal'd  Manly deportment gallant easy gay  An hand as lib'ral as the light of day  The soldier thus endow'd who never shrinks  Nor closets up his thought what'er he thinks  Who scorns to do an injury by stealth  Must go to heav'nand I must drink his health  Sir Smug he cries for lowest at the board  Just made fifth chaplain of his patron lord

he takes his glass  Which they that wooe preferment rarely pass  Fallible man the churchbred youth replies  Is still found fallible however wise  And differing judgments serve but to declare  That truth lies somewhere if we knew but where  Of all it ever was my lot to read  Of critics now alive or long since dead  The book of all the world that charm'd me most  Was welladay the titlepage was lost  The writer well remarks an heart that knows  To take with gratitude what heav'n bestows  With prudence always ready at our call  To guide our use of it is all in all  Doubtless it isto which of

honour'd name  And yet our lot is giv'n us in a land  Where busy arts are never at a stand  Where science points her telescopic eye  Familiar with the wonders of the sky  Where bold enquiry diving out of sight  Brings many a precious pearl of truth to light  Where nought eludes the persevering quest  That fashion taste or luxury suggest  But above all in her own light array'd  See mercy's grand apocalypse display'd  The sacred book no longer suffers wrong  Bound in the fetters of an unknown tongue  But speaks with plainness art could never mend  What simplest minds can soonest comprehend  God gives the word the preachers throng around  Live from his lips and spread the glorious sound  That sound bespeaks salvation on her way  The trumpet of a liferestoring day  'Tis heard where

voice of turtle in your land is heard  Nor grateful eglantine regales the smell  Of those that walk at ev'ning where ye dwell  But winter arm'd with terrors here unknown  Sits absolute on his unshaken throne  Piles up his stores amid'st the frozen waste  And bids the mountains he has built stand fast  Beckons the legions of his storms away  From happier scenes to make your land a prey  Proclaims

obscure the sight  Of one whose birth was in a land of light  Shall answer Hope sweet Hope has set me free  And made all pleasures else mere dross to me  These amidst scenes as waste as if denied  The common care that waits on all beside  Wild as if nature there void of all good  Play'd only gambols in a frantic mood  Yet charge not heav'nly skill with having plann'd  A plaything world unworthy of his hand  Can see his love though secret evil lurks  In all we touch stamp'd plainly on his works  Deem life a blessing with its num'rous woes  Nor spurn away a gift a God bestows  Hard task indeed o'er arctic seas to roam  Is hope exotic grows it not at home  Yes but an object bright as orient morn  May press the eye too closely to be borne  A distant virtue we can all confess  It hurts our pride and moves our envy less  Leuconomus beneath wellsounding Greek  I slur a name a poet must not speak  Stood pilloried on infamy's high stage  And bore the pelting scorn of half an age  The very butt of slander and the blot  For ev'ry dart that malice ever shot  The man that mentioned  him  at once dismiss'd  All mercy from his lips and sneer'd and hiss'd  His crimes were such as Sodom never knew  And perjury stood up to swear all true  His aim was mischief and his zeal pretence  His speech rebellion against common sense  A knave when tried on honesty's plain rule  And when by that of reason a mere fool  The world's best comfort was his doom was pass'd  Die when he might he must be damn'd at last  Now truth perform thine office waft aside  The curtain drawn by prejudice and pride  Reveal the man is dead to wond'ring eyes  This more than monster in his proper guise  He lov'd the world that hated him the tear  That dropped upon his Bible was sincere  Assail'd by scandal and the tongue of strife  His only answer was a blameless life  And he that forged and he that threw the dart  Had each a brother's interest in his heart  Paul's love of Christ and steadiness unbrib'd  Were copied close in him and well transcrib'd  He followed Paul his zeal a kindred flame  His apostolic charity the same  Like him cross'd chearfully tempestuous seas  Forsaking country kindred friends and ease  Like him he labour'd and like him content  To bear it suffer'd shame where'er he went  Blush calumny and write upon his tomb  If honest eulogy can spare thee room  Thy deep repentance of thy thousand lies  Which aim'd at him have pierc'd th' offended skies  And say blot out my sin confess'd deplor'd  Against thine image in thy saint oh Lord  No blinder bigot I maintain it still  Than he that must have pleasure come what will  He laughs whatever weapon truth may draw  And deems her sharp artillery mere straw  Scripture indeed is plain but God and he  On scriptureground are sure to disagree  Some wiser rule must teach him how to live  Than that his Maker has seen fit to give  Supple and flexible as Indian cane  To take the bend his appetites ordain  Contriv'd to suit frail nature's crazy case  And reconcile his lusts with saving grace  By this with nice precision of design  He draws upon life's map a zigzag line  That shows how far 'tis safe to follow sin  And where his danger and God's wrath begin  By this he forms as pleas'd he sports along  His well pois'd estimate of right and wrong  And finds the modish manners of the day  Though loose as harmless as an infant's play  Build by whatever plan caprice decrees  With what materials on what ground you please  Your hope shall stand unblam'd perhaps admir'd  If not that hope the scripture has requir'd  The strange conceits vain projects and wild dreams  With which hypocrisy for ever teems  Though other follies strike the public eye  And raise a laugh pass unmolested by  But if unblameable in word and thought  A  man  arise a man whom God has taught  With all Elijah's dignity of tone  And all the love of the beloved John  To storm the citadels they build in air  And smite th' untemper'd wall 'tis death to spare  To sweep away all refuges of lies  And place instead of quirks themselves devise  LAMA SABACTHANI before their eyes  To prove that without Christ all gain is loss  All hope despair that stands not on his cross  Except the few his God may have impress'd  A tenfold frenzy seizes all the rest  Throughout mankind the Christian kind at least  There dwells a consciousness in ev'ry breast  That folly ends where genuine hope begins  And he that finds his heav'n must lose his sins  Nature opposes with her utmost force  This riving stroke this ultimate divorce  And while religion seems to be her view  Hates with a deep sincerity  the true    For this of all that ever influenced man  Since Abel worshipp'd or the world began  This only spares no lust admits no plea  But makes him if at all completely free  Sounds forth the signal as she mounts her car  Of an eternal universal war  Rejects all treaty penetrates all wiles  Scorns with the same indiff'rence frowns and smiles  Drives through the realms of sin where riot reels  And grinds his crown beneath her burning wheels  Hence all that is in man pride passion art  Powr's of the mind and feelings of the heart  Insensible of truth's almighty charms  Starts at her first approach and sounds to arms  While bigotry with welldissembled fears  His eyes shut fast his fingers in his ears  Mighty to parry and push by God's word  With senseless noise his argument the sword  Pretends a zeal for godliness and grace  And spits abhorrence in the Christian's face  Parent of hope immortal truth make known  Thy deathless wreaths and triumphs all thine own  The silent progress of thy pow'r is such  Thy means so feeble and despis'd so much  That few believe the wonders thou hast wrought  And none can teach them but whom thou hast taught  Oh see me sworn to serve thee and command  A painter's skill into a poet's hand  That while I trembling trace a work divine  Fancy may stand aloof from the design  And light and shade and ev'ry stroke be thine  If ever thou hast felt another's pain  If ever when he sigh'd hast sigh'd again  If ever on thine eyelid stood the tear  That pity had engender'd drop one here  This man was happyhad the world's good word  And with it ev'ry joy it can afford  Friendship and love seem'd tenderly at strife  Which most should sweeten his untroubl'd life  Politely learn'd and of a gentle race  Goodbreeding and good sense gave all a grace  And whether at the toilette of the fair  He laugh'd and trifled made him welcome there  Or if in masculine debate he shar'd  Insur'd him mute attention and regard  Alas how chang'd expressive of his mind  His eyes are sunk arms folded head reclind  Those awful syllables hell death and sin  Though whisper'd plainly tell what works within  That conscience there performs her proper part  And writes a doomsday sentence on his heart  Forsaking and forsaken of all friends  He now perceives where earthly pleasure ends  Hard task for one who lately knew no care  And harder still as learnt beneath despair  His hours no longer pass unmark'd away  A dark importance saddens every day  He hears the notice of the clock perplex'd  And cries perhaps eternity strikes next  Sweet music is no longer music here  And laughter sounds like madness in his ear  His grief the world of all her pow'r disarms  Wine has no taste and beauty has no charms  God's holy word once trivial in his view  Now by the voice of his experience true  Seems as it is the fountain whence alone  Must spring that hope he pants to make his own  Now let the bright reverse be known abroad  Say man's a worm and pow'r belongs to God  As when a felon whom his country's laws  Have justly doom'd for some atrocious cause  Expects in darkness and heartchilling fears  The shameful close of all his mispent years  If chance on heavy pinions slowly borne  A tempest usher in the dreaded morn  Upon his dungeon walls the lightnings play  The thunder seems to summon him away  The warder at the door his key applies  Shoots back the bolt and all his courage dies  If then just then all thoughts of mercy lost  When Hope long ling'ring at last yields the ghost  The sound of pardon pierce his startled ear  He drops at once his fetters and his fear  A transport glows in all he looks and speaks  And the first thankful tears bedew his cheeks  Joy far superior joy that much outweighs  The comfort of a few poor added days  Invades possesses and o'erwhelms the soul  Of him whom hope has with a touch made whole  'Tis heav'n all heav'n descending on the wings  Of the glad legions of the King of Kings  'Tis more'tis God diffus'd through ev'ry part  'Tis God himself triumphant in his heart  Oh welcome now the sun's once hated light  His noonday beams were never half so bright  Not kindred minds alone are call'd t' employ  Their hours their days in list'ning to his joy  Unconscious nature all that he surveys  Rocks groves and streams must join him in his praise  These are thy glorious works eternal truth  The scoff of wither'd age and beardless youth  These move the censure and illib'ral grin  Of fools that hate thee and delight in sin  But these shall last when night has quench'd the pole▪  And heav'n is all departed as a scroll  And when as justice has long since decreed  This earth shall blaze and a new world succeed  Then these thy glorious works and they that share▪  That Hope which can alone exclude despair  Shall live exempt from weakness and decay  The brightest wonders of an endless day  Happy the bard if that fair name belong  To him that blends no fable with his song  Whose lines uniting by an honest art  The faithful monitors and poets part  Seek to delight that they may mend mankind  And while they captivate inform the mind  Still happier if he till a thankful soil  And fruit reward his honorable toil  But happier far who comfort those that wait  To hear plain truth at Judah's hallow'd gate  Their language simple as their manners meek  No shining ornaments have they to seek  Nor labour they nor time nor talents waste  In sorting flowers to suit a fickle taste  But while they speak the wisdom of the skies  Which art can only darken and disguise  Th' abundant harvest recompence divine  Repays their workthe gleaning only mine  CHARITY  Quâ nihil majus meliusve terris  Fata donavere boni{que} divi  Nec dabunt quamvis

and all in all above  Prosper I press thee with a pow'rful plea  A task I venture on impell'd by thee  Oh never seen but in thy blest effects  Nor felt but in the soul that heav'n selects  Who seeks to praise thee and to make thee known  To other hearts must have thee in his own  Come prompt me with benevolent desires  Teach me to kindle at thy gentle fires  And though disgrac'd and slighted to redeem  A poet's name by making thee the theme  God working ever on a social plan  By various ties attaches man to man  He made at first though free and unconfin'd  One man the common father of the kind  That ev'ry tribe though plac'd as he sees best  Where seas or desarts part them from the rest  Diff'ring in language manners or in face  Might feel themselves allied to all the race  When Cooklamented and with tears as just  As ever mingled with heroic dust  Steer'd Britain's oak into a world unknown  And in his country's glory sought his own  Wherever he found man to nature true  The rights of man were sacred in his view  He sooth'd with gifts and greeted with a smile  The simple native of the newfound isle  He spurn'd the wretch that slighted or withstood  The tender argument of kindred blood  Nor would endure that any should controul  His freeborn brethren of the southern pole  But though some nobler minds a law respect  That none shall with impunity neglect  In baser souls unnumber'd evils meet  To thwart its influence and its end defeat  While Cook is loved for savage lives he saved  See Cortez odious for a world enslaved  Where wast thou then sweet Charity where then  Thou tutelary friend of helpless men  Wast thou in Monkish cells and nunn'ries found  Or building hospitals on English ground  NoMammon makes the world his legatee  Through fear not love and heav'n abhors the fee  Wherever found and all men need thy care  Nor age nor infancy could find thee there  The hand that siew 'till it could slay no more  Was glued to the swordhilt with Indian gore  Their prince as justly seated on his throne  As vain imperial Philip on his own  Trick'd out of all his royalty by art  That stripp'd him bare and broke his honest heart  Died by the sentence of a shaven priest  For scorning what they taught him to detest  How dark the veil that intercepts the blaze  Of heav'ns mysterious purposes and ways  God stood not though he seem'd to stand aloof  And at this hour the conqu'ror feels the proof  The wreath he won drew down an instant curse  The fretting plague is in the public purse  The canker'd spoil corrodes the pining state  Starved by that indolence their mines create  Oh could their antient Incas rise again  How would they take up Israel's taunting strain  Art thou too fall'n Iberia do we see  The robber and the murth'rer weak as we  Thou that hast wasted earth and dared despise  Alike the wrath and mercy of the skies  Thy pomp is in the grave thy glory laid  Low in the pits thine avarice has made  We come with joy from our eternal rest  To see th' oppressor in his turn oppress'd  Art thou the God the thunder of whose hand  Roll'd over all our desolated land  Shook principalities and kingdoms down  And made the mountains tremble at his frown  The sword shall light upon thy boasted pow'rs  And waste them as thy sword has wasted ours  'Tis thus Omnipotence his law fulfils  And vengeance executes what justice wills  Againthe band of commerce was design'd  T' associate all the branches of mankind  And if a boundless plenty be the robe  Trade is the golden girdle of the globe  Wise to promote whatever end he means  God opens fruitful nature's various scenes  Each climate needs what other climes produce  And offers something to the gen'ral use  No land but listens to the common call  And in return receives supply from all  This genial intercourse and mutual aid  Cheers what were else an universal shade  Calls nature from her ivymantled den  And softens human rockwork into men  Ingenious Art with her expressive face  Steps forth to fashion and refine the race  Not only fills necessity's demand  But overcharges her capacious hand  Capricious taste itself can crave no more  Than she supplies from her abounding store  She strikes out all that luxury can ask  And gains new vigour at her endless task  Hers is the spacious arch the shapely spire  The painters pencil and the poets lyre  From her the canvass borrows light and shade  And verse more lasting hues that never fade  She guides the finger o'er the dancing keys  Gives difficulty all the grace of ease  And pours a torrent of sweet notes around  Fast as the thirsting ear can drink the sound  These are the gifts of art and art thrives most  Where commerce has enrich'd the busy coast  He catches all improvements in his flight  Spreads foreign wonders in his country's sight  Imports what others have invented well  And stirs his own to match them or excel  'Tis thus reciprocating each with each  Alternately the nations learn and teach  While Providence enjoins to ev'ry soul  An union with the vast terraqueous whole  Heav'n speed the canvass gallantly unfurl'd  To furnish and accommodate a world  To give the Pole the produce of the sun  And knit th' unsocial climates into one  Soft airs and gentle heavings of the wave  Impel the fleet whose errand is to save  To succour wasted regions and replace  The smile of opulence in sorrow's face  Let nothing adverse nothing unforeseen  Impede the bark that plows the deep serene  Charg'd with a freight transcending in its worth  The gems of India nature's rarest birth  That flies like Gabriel on his Lord's commands  An herald of God's love to pagan lands  But ah what wish can prosper or what pray'r  For merchants rich in cargoes of despair  Who drive a loathsome traffic gage and span  And buy the muscles and the bones of man  The tender ties of father husband friend  All bonds of nature in that moment end  And each endures while yet he draws his breath  A stroke as fatal as the scythe of death  The sable warrior frantic with regret  Of her he loves and never can forget  Loses in tears the far receding shore  But not the thought that they must meet no more  Depriv'd of her and freedom at a blow  What has he left that he can yet forego  Yes to deep sadness sullenly resign'd  He feels his body's bondage in his mind  Puts off his gen'rous nature and to suit  His manners with his fate puts on the brute  Oh most degrading of all ills that wait  On man a mourner in his best estate  All other sorrows virtue may endure  And find submission more than half a cure  Grief is itself a med'cine and bestow'd  T' improve the fortitude that bears the load  To teach the wand'rer as his woes encrease  The path of wisdom all whose paths are peace  But slav'ryvirtue dreads it as her grave  Patience itself is meanness in a slave  Or if the will and sovereignty of God  Bid suffer it awhile and kiss the rod  Wait for the dawning of a brighter day  And snap the chain the moment when you may  Nature imprints upon whate'er we see  That has a heart and life in it be free  The beasts are charteredneither age nor force  Can quell the love of freedom in a horse  He breaks the cord that held him at the rack  And conscious of an unincumber'd back  Snuffs up the morning air forgets the rein  Loose fly his forelock and his ample mane  Responsive to the distant neigh he neighs  No stops till overleaping all delays  He finds the pasture where his fellows graze  Canst thou and honour'd with a Christian name  Buy what is womanborn and feel no shame  Trade in the blood of innocence and plead  Expedience as a warrant for the deed  So may the wolf whom famine has made bold  To quit the forest and invade the fold  So may the ruffian who with ghostly glide  Dagger in hand steals close to your bedside  Not he but his emergence forc'd the door  He found it inconvenient to be poor  Has God then giv'n its sweetness to the cane  Unless his laws be trampled onin vain  Built a brave world which cannot yet subsist  Unless his right to rule it be dismiss'd  Impudent blasphemy so folly pleads  And av'rice being judge with ease succeeds  But grant the plea and let it stand for just  That man make man his prey because he  must    Still there is room for pity to abate  And sooth the sorrows of so sad a state  A Briton knows or if he knows it not  The Scripture plac'd within his reach he ought  That souls have no discriminating hue  Alike important in their Maker's view  That none are free from blemish since the fall  And love divine has paid one price for all  The wretch that works and weeps without relief  Has one that notices his silent grief  He from whose hands alone all pow'r proceeds  Ranks its abuse among the foulest deeds  Considers  all  injustice with a frown  But  marks  the man that treads his fellow down  Begone the whip and bell in that hard hand  Are hateful ensigns of usurp'd command  Not Mexico could purchase kings a claim  To scourge him weariness his only blame  Remember heav'n has an avenging rod  To smite the poor is treason against God  Trouble is grudgingly and hardly brook'd  While life's sublimest joys are overlook'd  We wander o'er a sunburnt thirsty soil  Murm'ring and weary of our daily toil  Forget t' enjoy the palmtree's offer'd shade  Or taste the fountain in the neighb'ring glade  Else who would lose that had the pow'r t' improve  Th' occasion of transmuting fear to love  Oh 'tis a godlike privilege to save  And he that scorns it is himself a slave  Inform his mind one flash of heav'nly day  Would heal his heart and melt his chains away  `Beauty for ashes' is a gift indeed  And slaves by truth enlarg'd are doubly freed  Then would he say submissive at thy feet  While gratitude and love made service sweet  My dear deliv'rer out of hopeless night  Whose bounty bought me but to give me light  I was a bondman on my native plain  Sin forg'd and ignorance made fast the chain  Thy lips have shed instruction as the dew  Taught me what path to shun and what pursue  Farewell my former joys I sigh no more  For Africa's once lov'd benighted shore  Serving a benefactor I am free  At my best home if not exiled from thee  Some men make gain a fountain whence proceeds  A stream of lib'ral and heroic deeds  The swell of pity not to be confin'd  Within the scanty limits of the mind  Disdains the bank and throws the golden sands  A rich deposit on the bord'ring lands  These have an ear for  his  paternal call  Who makes some rich for the supply of all  God's gift with pleasure in his praise employ  And THORNTON is familiar with the joy  Oh could I worship aught beneath the skies  That earth hath seen or fancy can devise  Thine altar sacred liberty should stand  Built by no mercenary vulgar hand  With fragrant turf and flow'rs as wild and fair  As ever dress'd a bank or scented summer air  Duely as ever on the mountain's height  The peep of morning shed a dawning light  Again when evening in her sober vest  Drew the grey curtain of the fading west  My soul should yield thee willing thanks and praise  For the chief blessings of my fairest days  But that were

From Sparta hither and art here at home  We feel thy force still active at this hour  Enjoy immunity from priestly pow'r  While conscience happier than in antient years  Owns no superior but the God she fears  Propitious spirit yet expunge a wrong  Thy rights have suffer'd and our land too long  Teach mercy to ten thousand hearts that share  The fears and hopes of a commercial care  Prisons expect the wicked and were built  To bind the lawless and to punish guilt  But shipwreck earthquake battle fire and flood  Are mighty mischiefs not to be withstood  And honest merit stands on slipp'ry ground  Where covert guile and artifice abound  Let just restraint for public peace design'd  Chain up the wolves and tigers of mankind  The foe of virtue has no claim to thee  But let insolvent innocence go free  Patron of else the most despised of men  Accept the tribute of a stranger's pen  Verse like the laurel its immortal meed  Should be the guerdon of a noble deed  I may alarm thee but I fear the shame  Charity chosen as my theme and aim  I must incur forgetting HOWARD'S name  Blest with all wealth can give thee to resign  Joys doubly sweet to feelings quick as thine  To quit the bliss thy rural scenes bestow  To seek a nobler amidst scenes of woe  To traverse seas range kingdoms and bring home  Not the proud monuments of Greece or Rome  But knowledge such as only dungeons teach  And only sympathy like thine could reach  That grief sequester'd from the public stage  Might smooth her feathers and enjoy her cage  Speaks a divine ambition and a zeal  The boldest patriot might be proud to feel  Oh that the voice of clamor and debate  That pleads for peace 'till it disturbs the state  Were hush'd in favour of thy gen'rous plea  The poor thy clients and heaven's smile thy fee  Philosophy that does not dream or stray  Walks arm in arm with nature all his way  Compasses earth dives into it ascends  Whatever steep enquiry recommends  Sees planetary wonders smoothly roll  Round other systems under her controll  Drinks wisdom at the milky stream of light  That cheers the silent journey of the night  And brings at his return a bosom charged  With rich instruction and a soul enlarged  The treasured sweets of the capacious plan  That heav'n spreads wide before the view of man  All prompt his pleased pursuit and to pursue  Still prompt him with a pleasure always new  He too has a connecting pow'r and draws  Man to the center of the common cause  Aiding a dubious and deficient sight  With a new medium and a purer light  All truth is precious if not all divine  And what dilates the pow'rs must needs refine  He reads the skies and watching ev'ry change  Provides the faculties an ampler range  And wins mankind as his attempts prevail  A proudcer station on the gen'ral scale  But reason still unless divinely taught  Whate'er she learns learns nothing as she ought  The lamp of revelation only shows  What human wisdom cannot but oppose  That man in nature's richest mantle clad  And graced with all philosophy can add  Though fair without and luminous within  Is still the progeny and heir of sin  Thus taught down falls the plumage of his pride  He feels his need of an unerring guide  And knows that falling he shall rise no more  Unless the pow'r that bade him stand restore  This is indeed philosophy this known  Makes wisdom worthy of the name his own  And without this whatever he discuss  Whether the space between the stars and us  Whether he measure earth compute the sea  Weigh sunbeams carve a fly or spit a flea  The solemn trifler with his boasted skill  Toils much and is a solemn trifler still  Blind was he born and his misguided eyes  Grown dim in trifling studies blind he dies  Selfknowledge truly learn'd of course implies  The rich possession of a nobler prize  For self to self and God to man reveal'd  Two themes to nature's eye for ever seal'd  Are taught by rays that fly with equal pace  From the same center of enlight'ninggrace  Here stay thy foot how copious and how clear  Th' o'erflowing well of Charity springs here  Hark 'tis the music of a thousand rills  Some through the groves some down the sloping hills  Winding a secret or an open course  And all supplied from an eternal source  The ties of nature do but feebly bind  And commerce partially reclaims mankind  Philosophy without his heav'nly guide  May blow up selfconceit and nourish pride  But while his province is the reas'ning part  Has still a veil of midnight on his heart  'Tis truth divine exhibited on earth  Gives Charity her being and her birth  Suppose when thought is warm and fancy flows  What will not argument sometimes suppose  An isle possess'd by creatures of our kind  Endued with reason yet by nature blind  Let supposition lend her aid once more  And land some grave optician on the shore  He claps his lens if haply they may see  Close to the part where vision ought to be  But finds that though his tubes assist the sight  They cannot give it or make darkness light  He reads wise lectures and describes aloud  A sense they know not to the wond'ring crowd  He talks of light and the prismatic hues  As men of depth in erudition use  But all he gains for his harangue isWell  What monstrous lies some travellers will tell  The soul whose sight allquick'ning grace renews  Takes the resemblance of the good she views  As di'monds stript of their opaque disguise  Reflect the noonday glory of the skies  She speaks of him her author guardian friend  Whose love knew no beginning knows no end  In language warm as all that love inspires  And in the glow of her intense desires  Pants to communicate her noble fires  She sees a world stark blind to what employs  Her eager thought and feeds her flowing joys  Though wisdom hail them heedless of her call  Flies to save some and feels a pang for all  Herself as weak as her support is strong  She feels that frailty she denied so long  And from a knowledge of her own disease  Learns to compassionate the sick she sees  Here see acquitted of all vain pretence  The reign of genuine Charity commence  Though scorn repay her sympathetic tears  She still is kind and still she perseveres  The truth she loves a sightless world blaspheme  'Tis childish dotage a delirious dream  The danger they discern not they deny  Laugh at their only remedy and die  But still a soul thus touch'd can never cease  Whoever threatens war to speak of peace  Pure in her aim and in her temper mild  Her wisdom seems the weakness of a child  She makes excuses where she might condemn  Reviled by those that hate her prays for them  Suspicion lurks not in her artless breast  The worst suggested she believes the best  Not soon provoked however stung and teaz'd  And if perhaps made angry soon appeas'd  She rather waves than will dispute her right  And injur'd makes forgiveness her delight  Such was the pourtrait an apostle drew  The bright original was one he knew  Heav'n held his hand the likeness must be true  When one that holds communion with the skies  Has filled his urn where these pure waters rise  And once more mingles with us meaner things  'Tis ev'n as if an angel shook his wings  Immortal fragrance fills the circuit wide  That tells us whence his treasures are supplied  So when a ship well freighted with the stores  The sun matures on India's spicy shores  Has dropt her anchor and her canvas furl'd  In some safe haven of our western world  'Twere vain enquiry to what port she went  The gale informs us laden with the scent  Some seek when queazy conscience has its qualms  To lull the painful malady with alms  But charity not feign'd intends alone  Another's goodtheirs centers in their own  And too shortlived to reach the realms of peace  Must cease for ever when the poor shall cease  Flavia most tender of her own good name  Is rather careless of a sister's fame  Her superfluity the poor supplies  But if she touch a character it dies  The seeming virtue weigh'd against the vice  She deems all safe for she has paid the price  No charity but alms aught values she  Except in porcelain on her mantletree  How many deeds with which the world has rung  From pride in league with ignorance have sprung  But God o'erules all human follies still  And bends the tough materials to his will  A conflagration or a wintry flood  Has left some hundreds without home or food  Extravagance and av'rice shall subscribe  While fame and selfcomplacence are the bribe  The brief proclaim'd it visits ev'ry pew  But first the 'Squire's a compliment but due  With slow deliberation he unties  His glitt'ring purse that envy of all eyes  And while the clerk just puzzles out the psalm  Slides guinea behind guinea in his palm  'Till finding what he might have found before  A smaller piece amidst the precious store  Pinch'd close between his finger and his thumb  He half exhibits and then drops the sum  Gold to be surethroughout the town 'tis told  How the good 'Squire gives never less than gold  From motives such as his though not the best  Springs in due time supply for the distress'd  Not less effectual than what love bestows  Except that office clips it as it goes  But lest I seem to sin against a friend  And wound the grace I mean to recommend  Though vice derided with a just design  Implies no trespass against love divine  Once more I would adopt the graver stile  A teacher should be sparing of his smile  Unless a love of virtue light the flame  Satyr is more than those he brands to blame  He hides behind a magisterial air  His own offences and strips others bare  Affects indeed a most humane concern  That men if gently tutor'd will not learn  That muleish folly not to be reclaim'd  By softer methods must be made asham'd  But I might instance in St Patrick's dean  Too often rails to gratify his spleen  Most sat'rists are indeed a public scourge  Their mildest physic is a farrier's purge  Their acrid temper turns as soon as stirr'd  The milk of their good purpose all to curd  Their zeal begotten as their works rehearse  By lean despair upon an empty purse  The wild assassins start into the street  Prepar'd to poignard whomsoe'er they meet  No skill in swordsmanship however just  Can be secure against a madman's thrust  And even virtue so unfairly match'd  Although immortal may be prick'd or scratch'd  When scandal has new minted an old lie  Or tax'd invention for a fresh supply  'Tis called a satyr and the world appears  Gath'ring around it with erected ears  A thousand names are toss'd into the crowd  Some whisper'd softly and some twang'd aloud  Just as the sapience of an author's brain  Suggests it safe or dang'rous to be plain  Strange how the frequent interjected dash  Quickens a market and helps off the trash  Th' important letters that include the rest  Serve as a key to those that are suppress'd  Conjecture gripes the victims in his paw  The world is charm'd and Scrib escapes the law  So when the cold damp shades of night prevail  Worms may be caught by either head or tail  Forcibly drawn from many a close recess  They meet with little pity no redress  Plung'd in the stream they lodge upon the mud  Food for the famish'd rovers of the flood  All zeal for a reform that gives offence  To peace and charity is mere pretence  A bold remark but which if well applied  Would humble many a tow'ring poet's pride  Perhaps the man was in a sportive fit  And had no other playplace for his wit  Perhaps enchanted with the love of fame  He sought the jewel in his neighbour's shame  Perhapswhatever end he might pursue  The cause of virtue could not be his view  At ev'ry stroke wit flashes in our eyes  The turns are quick the polish'd points surprise  But shine with cruel and tremendous charms  That while they please possess us with alarms  So have I seen and hasten'd to the sight  On all the wings of holiday delight  Where stands that monument of antient pow'r  Named with emphatic dignity the tow'r  Guns halberts swords and pistols great and small  In starry forms disposed upon the wall  We wonder as we gazing stand below  That brass and steel should make so fine a show  But though we praise th' exact designer's skill  Account them implements of mischief still  No works shall find acceptance in that day  When all disguises shall be rent away  That square not truly with the Scripture plan  Nor spring from love to God or love to man  As he ordains things sordid in their birth  To be resolved into their parent earth  And though the soul shall seek superior orbs  Whate'er this world produces it absorbs  So self starts nothing but what tends apace  Home to the goal where it began the race  Such as our motive is our aim must be  If this be servile that can ne'er be free  If self employ us whatsoe'er is wrought  We glorify that self not him we ought  Such virtues had need prove their own reward  The judge of all men owes them no regard  True Charity a plant divinely nurs'd  Fed by the love from which it rose at first  Thrives against hope and in the rudest scene  Storms but enliven its unfading green  Exub'rant is the shadow it supplies  Its fruit on earth its growth above the skies  To look at him who form'd us and redeem'd  So glorious now though once so disesteem'd  To see a God stretch forth his human hand  T' uphold the boundless scenes of his command  To recollect that in a form like ours  He bruis'd beneath his feet th' infernal pow'rs  Captivity led captive rose to claim  The wreath he won so dearly in our name  That thron'd above all height he condescends  To call the few that trust in him his friends  That in the heav'n of heav'ns that space he deems  Too scanty for th' exertion of his beams  And shines as if impatient to bestow  Life and a kingdom upon worms below  That sight imparts a neverdying flame  Though feeble in degree in kind the same  Like him the soul thus kindled from above  Spreads wide her arms of universal love  And still enlarg'd as she receives the grace  Includes creation in her close embrace  Behold a Christianand without the fires  The founder of that name alone inspires  Though all accomplishments all knowledge meet  To make the shining prodigy complete  Whoever boasts that namebehold a cheat  Were love in these the world's last doting years  As frequent as the want of it appears  The churches warm'd they would no longer hold  Such frozen figures stiff as they are cold  Relenting forms would lose their pow'r or cease  And ev'n the dipt and sprinkled live in peace  Each heart would quit its prison in the breast  And flow in free communion with the rest  The statesman skill'd in projects dark and deep  Might burn his useless Machiavel and sleep  His budget often filled yet always poor  Might swing at ease behind his study door  No longer prey upon our annual rents  Nor scare the nation with its big contents  Disbanded legions freely might depart  And slaying man would cease to be an art  No learned disputants would take the field  Sure not to conquer and sure not to yield  Both sides deceiv'd if rightly understood  Pelting each other for the public good  Did Charity prevail the press would prove  A vehicle of virtue truth and love  And I might spare myself the pains to show  What few can learn and all suppose they know  Thus have I sought to grace a serious lay  With many a wild indeed but flow'ry spray  In hopes to gain what else I must have lost  Th' attention pleasure has so much engross'd  But if unhappily deceiv'd I dream  And prove too weak for so divine a theme  Let Charity forgive me a mistake  That zeal not vanity has chanc'd to make  And spare the poet for his subject sake  CONVERSATION  Nam ne{que} me tantum venientis sibilus austri  Nec percussa juvant fluctû tam litora nec quae  Saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valles  VIRG ECL  THOUGH nature weigh our talents and dispens  ▪  To ev'ry man his modicum of sense  And Conversation in its better part  May be esteemed a gift and not an art  Yet much depends as in the tiller's toil  On culture and the sowing of the soil  Words learn'd by rote a parrot may rehearse  But talking is not always to converse  Not more distinct from harmony divine  The constant creaking of a country sign  As alphabets in ivory employ  Hour after hour the yet unletter'd boy  Sorting and puzzling with a deal of glee  Those seeds of science called his ABC  So language in the mouths of the adult  Witness its insignificant result  Too often proves an implement of play  A toy to sport with and pass time away  Collect at evening what the day brought forth  Compress the sum into its solid worth  And if it weigh th' importance of a fly  The scales are false or Algebra a lie  Sacred interpreter of human thought  How few respect or use thee as they ought  But all shall give account of ev'ry wrong  Who dare dishonour or defile the tongue  Who prostitute it in the cause of vice  Or sell their

them dumb  His wise forbearance has their end in view  They fill their measure and receive their due  The heathen lawgivers of antient days  Names almost worthy of a Christian praise  Would drive them forth from the resort of men  And shut up ev'ry satyr in his den  Oh come not ye near innocence and truth  Ye worms that eat into the bud of youth  Infectious as impure your blighting pow'r  Taints in its rudiments the promised flow'r  Its odour perish'd and its charming hue  Thenceforth 'tis hateful for it smells of you  Not ev'n the vigorous and headlong rage  Of adolescence or a firmer age  Affords a plea allowable or just  For making speech the pamperer of lust  But when the breath of age commits the fault  'Tis nauseous as the vapor of a vault  So wither'd stumps disgrace the sylvan scene  No longer fruitful and no longer green  The sapless wood divested of the bark  Grows fungous and takes fire at ev'ry spark  Oaths terminate as Paul observes all strife  Some men have surely then a peaceful life  Whatever subject occupy discourse  The feats of Vestris or the naval force  Asseveration blust'ring in your face  Makes contradiction such an hopeless case  In ev'ry tale they tell or false or true  Well known or such as no man ever knew  They fix attention heedless of your pain  With oaths like rivets forced into the brain  And ev'n when sober truth prevails throughout  They swear it 'till affirmance breeds a doubt  A Persian humble servant of the sun  Who though devout yet bigotry had none  Hearing a lawyer grave in his address  With adjurations ev'ry word impress  Supposed the man a bishop or at least  God's name so much upon his lips a priest  Bowed at the close with all his graceful airs  And begg'd an int'rest in his frequent pray'rs  Go quit the rank to which ye stood preferred  Henceforth associate in one common herd  Religion virtue reason common sense  Pronounce your human form a false pretence  A mere disguise in which a devil lurks  Who yet betrays his secret by his works  Ye pow'rs who rule the tongue if such there are  And make colloquial happiness your care  Preserve me from the thing I dread and hate  A duel in the form of a debate  The clash of arguments and jar of words  Worse than the mortal brunt of rival swords  Decide no question with their tedious length  For opposition gives opinion strength  Divert the champions prodigal of breath  And put the peaceablydisposed to death  Oh thwart me not Sir Soph at ev'ry turn  Nor carp at ev'ry flaw you may discern  Though syllogisms hang not on my tongue  I am not surely always in the wrong  'Tis hard if all is false that I advance  A fool must now and then be right by chance  Not that all freedom of dissent I blame  Nothere I grant the privilege I claim  A disputable point is no man's ground  Rove where you please 'tis common all around  Discourse may want an animatedNo  To brush the surface and to make it flow  But still remember if you mean to please  To press your point with modesty and ease  The mark at which my juster aim I take  Is contradiction for its own dear sake  Set your opinion at whatever pitch  Knots and impediments make something hitch  Adopt his own 'tis equally in vain  Your thread of argument is snapt again  The wrangler rather than accord with you  Will judge  himself  deceiv'd and prove it too  Vociferated logic kills me quite  A noisy man is

scrupulous good man  Yesyou may catch him tripping if you can  He would not with a peremptory tone  Assert the nose upon his face his own  With hesitation admirably slow  He humbly hopes presumes it may be so  His evidence if he were called by law  To swear to some enormity he saw  For want of prominence and just relief  Would hang an honest man and save a thief  Through constant dread of giving truth offence  He ties up all his hearers in suspense  Knows what he knows as if he knew it not  What he remembers seems to have forgot  His sole opinion whatsoe'er befall  Cent'ring at last in having none at all  Yet though he teaze and baulk your list'ning ear  He makes one useful point exceeding clear  Howe'er ingenious on his darling theme  A sceptic in philosophy may seem  Reduced to practice his beloved rule  Would only prove him a consummate fool  Useless in him alike both brain and speech  Fate having placed all truth above his reach  His ambiguities his total sum  He might as well be blind and deaf and dumb  Where men of judgment creep and feel their way  The Positive pronounce without dismay  Their want of light and intellect supplied  By sparks absurdity strikes out of pride  Without the means of knowing right from wrong  They always are decisive clear and strong  Where others toil with philosophic force  Their nimble nonsense takes a shorter course  Flings at your head conviction in the lump  And gains remote conclusions at a jump  Their own defect invisible to them  Seen in another they at once condemn  And though selfidolized in ev'ry case  Hate their own likeness in a brother's face  The cause is plain and not to be denied  The proud are always most provok'd by pride  Few competitions but engender spite  And those the most where neither has a right  The point of honour has been deemed of use  To teach good manners and to curb abuse  Admit it true the consequence is clear  Our polished manners are a mask we wear  And at the bottom barb'rous still and rude  We are restrained indeed but not subdued  The very remedy however sure  Springs from the mischief it intends to cure  And savage in its principle appears  Tried as it should be by the fruit it bears  'Tis hard indeed if nothing will defend  Mankind from quarrels but their fatal end  That now and then an hero must decease  That the surviving world may live in peace  Perhaps at last close scrutiny may show  The practice dastardly and mean and low  That men engage in it compelled by force  And fear not courage is its proper source  The fear of tyrant custom and the fear  Lest fops should censure us and fools should sneer  At least to trample on our Maker's laws  And hazard life for any or no cause  To rush into a fixt eternal state  Out of the very flames of rage and hate  Or send another shiv'ring to the bar  With all the guilt of such unnat'ral war  Whatever use may urge or honour plead  On reason's verdict is a madman's deed  Am I to set my life upon a throw  Because a bear is rude and surly No  A moral sensible and wellbred man  Will not affront me and no other can  Were I empow'rd to regulate the lists  They should encounter with wellloaded fists  A Trojan combat would be something new  Let DARES beat ENTELLUS black and blue  Then each might show to his admiring friends  In honourable bumps his rich amends  And carry in contusions of his scull  A satisfactory receipt in full  A story in which native humour reigns  Is often useful always entertains  A graver fact enlisted on your side  May furnish illustration well applied  But sedentary weavers of long tales  Give me the fidgets and my patience fails  'Tis the most asinine employ on earth  To hear them tell of parentage and birth  And echo conversations dull and dry  Embellished with  he said  and  so said I  At ev'ry interview their route the same  The repetition makes attention lame  We bustle up with unsuccessful speed  And in the saddest part crydroll indeed  The path of narrative with care pursue  Still making probability your clue  On all the vestiges of truth attend  And let  them  guide you to a decent end  Of all ambitions man may entertain  The worst that can invade a sickly brain  Is that which angles hourly for surprize  And baits its hook with prodigies and lies  Credulous infancy or age as weak  Are fittest auditors for such to seek  Who to please others will themselves disgrace  Yet please not but affront you to your face  A great retailer of this curious ware  Having unloaded and made many stare  Can this be true an arch observer cries  Yes rather moved I saw it with these eyes  Sir I believe it on that ground alone  I could not had I seen it with my own  A tale should be judicious clear succinct  The language plain and incidents welllink'd  Tell not as new what ev'ry body knows  And new or old still hasten to a close  There centring in a focus round and neat  Let all your rays of information meet  What neither yields us profit or delight  Is like a nurse's lullaby at night  Guy Earl of Warwick and fair Eleanore  Or giantkilling Jack would please me more  The pipe with solemn interposing puff  Makes half a sentence at a time enough  The dozing sages drop the drowsy strain  Then pause and puffand speak and pause again  Such often like the tube they so admire  Important trifles have more smoke than fire  Pernicious weed whose scent the fair annoys  Unfriendly to society's chief joys  Thy worst effect is banishing for hours  The sex whose presence civilizes ours  Thou art indeed the drug a gard'ner wants  To poison vermin that infest his plants  But are we so to wit and beauty blind  As to despise the glory of our kind  And show the softest minds and fairest forms  As little mercy as he grubs and worms  They dare not wait the riotous abuse  Thy thirstcreating steams at length produce  When wine has giv'n indecent language birth  And forced the floodgates of licentious mirth  For seaborn Venus her attachment shows  Still to that element from which she rose  And with a quiet which no fumes disturb  Sips meek infusions of a milder herb  Th' emphatic speaker dearly loves t' oppose  In contact inconvenient nose to nose  As if the gnomon on his neighbour's phiz  Touched with a magnet had attracted his  His whisper'd theme dilated and at large  Proves after all a windgun's airy charge  An extract of his diaryno more  A tasteless journal of the day before  He walked abroad o'ertaken in the rain  Called on a friend drank tea stept home again  Resumed his purpose had a world of talk  With one he stumbled on and lost his walk  I interrupt him with a sudden bow  Adieu dear Sir lest you should lose it now  I cannot talk with civet in the room  A fine pussgentleman that's all perfume  The sight's enoughno need to smell a beau  Who thrusts his nose into a rareeshow  His odoriferous attempts to please  Perhaps might prosper with a swarm of bees  But we that make no honey though we sting  Poets are sometimes apt to mawl the thing  'Tis wrong to bring into a mixt resort  What makes some sick and others  alamort    An argument of cogence we may say  Why such an one should keep  himself  away  A graver coxcomb we may sometimes see  Quite as absurd though not so light as he  A shallow brain behind a serious mask  An oracle within an empty cask  The solemn fop significant and budge  A fool with judges amongst fools a judge  He says but little and that little said  Owes all its weight like loaded dice to lead  His wit invites you by his looks to come  But when you knock it never is at home  'Tis like a parcel sent you by the stage  Some handsome present as your hopes presage  'Tis heavy bulky and bids fair to prove  An absent friend's fidelity and love  But when unpack'd your disappointment groans  To find it stuff'd with brickbats earth and stones  Some men employ their health an ugly trick  In making known how oft they have been sick  And give us in recitals of disease  A doctor's trouble but without the fees  Relate how many weeks they kept their bed  How an emetic or cathartic sped  Nothing is slightly touched much less forgot  Nose ears and eyes seem present on the spot  Now the distemper spite of draught or pill  Victorious seem'd and now the doctor's skill  And nowalas for unforeseen mishaps  They put on a damp nightcap and relapse  They thought they must have died they were so bad  Their peevish hearers almost wish they had  Some fretful tempers wince at ev'ry touch  You always do too little or too much  You speak with life in hopes to entertain  Your elevated voice goes through the brain  You fall at once into a lower key  That's worsethe dronepipe of an humble bee  The southern sash admits too strong a light  You rise and drop the curtainnow its night  He shakes with coldyou stir the fire and strive  To make a blazethat's roasting him alive  Serve him with ven'son and he chuses fish  With soalthat's just the sort he would not wish  He takes what he at first profess'd to loath  And in due time feeds heartily on both  Yet still o'erclouded with a constant frown  He does not swallow but he gulps it down  Your hope to please him vain on ev'ry plan  Himself should work that wonder if he can  Alas his efforts double his disttess  He likes yours little and his own still less  Thus always teazing others always teazed  His only pleasure isto be displeas'd  I pity bashful men who feel the pain  Of fancied scorn and undeserv'd disdain  And bear the marks upon a blushing face  Of needless shame and selfimposed disgrace  Our sensibilities are so acute  The fear of being silent makes us mute  We sometimes think we could a speech produce  Much to the purpose if our tongues were loose  But being tied it dies upon the lip  Faint as a chicken's note that has the pip  Our wasted oil unprofitably burns  Like hidden lamps in old sepulchral urns  Few Frenchmen of this evil have complained  It seems as if we Britons were ordained  By way of wholesome curb upon our pride  To fear each other fearing none beside  The cause perhaps enquiry may descry  Selfsearching with an introverted eye  Concealed within an unsuspected part  The vainest corner of our own vain heart  For ever aiming at the world's esteem  Our selfimportance ruins its own scheme  In other eyes our talents rarely shown  Become at length so splendid in our own  We dare not risque them into public view  Lest they miscarry of what seems their due  True modesty is a discerning grace  And only blushes in the proper place  But counterfeit is blind and skulks through fear  Where 'tis a shame to be ashamed t' appear  Humility the parent of the first  The last by vanity produced and nurst  The circle formed we sit in silent state  Like figures drawn upon a dialplate  Yes ma'am and no ma'am utter'd softly show  Ev'ry five minutes how the minutes go  Each individual suffering a constraint  Poetry may but colours cannot paint  As if in close committee on the sky  Reports it hot or cold or wet or dry  And finds a changing clime an happy source  Of wise reflection and welltimed discourse  We next enquire but softly and by stealth  Like conservators of the public health  Of epidemic throats if such there are  And coughs and rheums and phtisic and catarrh  That theme exhausted a wide chasm ensues  Filled up at last with interesting news  Who danced with whom and who are like to wed  And who is hanged and who is brought to bed  But fear to call a more important cause  As if 'twere treason against English laws  The visit paid with extasy we come  As from a seven years transportation home  And there resume an unembarrass'd brow  Recov'ring what we lost we know not how  The faculties that seem'd reduc'd to nought  Expression and the privilege of thought  The reeking roaring hero of the chase  I give him over as a desp'rate case  Physicians write in hopes to work a cure  Never if honest ones when death is sure  And though the fox he follows may be tamed  A mere foxfollower never is reclaimed  Some farrier should prescribe his proper course  Whose only fit companion is his horse  Or if deserving of a better doom  The noble beast judge otherwise his groom  Yet ev'n the rogue that serves him though he stand  To take his honour's orders cap in hand  Prefers his fellowgrooms with much good sense  Their skill a truth his master's a pretence  If neither horse nor groom affect the squire  Where can at last his jockeyship retire  Oh to the club the scene of savage joys  The school of coarse good fellowship and noise  There in the sweet society of those  Whose friendship from his boyish years he chose  Let him improve his talent if he can  'Till none but beasts acknowledge him a man  Man's heart had been impenetrably sealed  Like theirs that cleave

the list'ning lover with delight  Forget his harmony with rapture heard  To learn the twitt'ring of a meaner bird  Or make the parrot's mimickry his choice  That odious libel on an human voice  Nonature unsophisticate by man  Starts not aside from her Creator's plan  The melody that was at first design'd  To cheer the rude forefathers of mankind  Is note for note deliver'd in our ears  In the last scene of her six thousand years  Yet Fashion leader of a chatt'ring train  Whom man for his own hurt permits to reign  Who shifts and changes all things but his shape  And would degrade her vot'ry to an ape  The fruitful parent of abuse and wrong  Holds an usurp'd dominion o'er his tongue  There sits and prompts him with his own disgrace  Prescribes the theme the tone and the grimace

folly worthy of the nurse's lap  Give it the breast or stop its mouth with pap  Is it incredible or can it seem  A dream to any except those that dream  That man should love his Maker and  that  fire  Warming his heart should at his lips transpire  Know then and modestly let fall your eyes  And vail your daring crest that braves the skies  That air of insolence affronts your God  You need his pardon and provoke his rod  Now in a posture that becomes you more  Than that heroic strut assumed before  Know your arrears with ev'ry hour accrue  For mercy shown while wrath is justly due  The time is short and there are souls on earth  Though future pain may serve for present mirth  Acquainted with the woes that fear or shame  By fashion taught forbade them once to name  And having felt the pangs you deem a jest  Have prov'd them truths too big to be express'd  Go seek on revelation's hallow'd ground  Sure to succeed the remedy they found  Touch'd by that pow'r that you have dared to mock  That makes seas stable and dissolves the rock  Your heart shall yield a liferenewing stream  That fools as you have done shall call a dream  It happened on a solemn eventide  Soon after He that was our surety died  Two bosomfriends each pensively inclined  The scene of all those sorrows left behind  Sought their own village busied as they went  In musings worthy of the great event  They spake of him they loved of him whose life  Though blameless had incurred perpetual strife  Whose deeds had left in spite of hostile arts  A deep memorial graven on their hearts  The recollection like a vein of ore  The farther traced enrich'd them still the more  They thought him and they justly thought him one  Sent to do more than he appear'd to have done  T' exalt a people and to place them high  Above all else and wonder'd he should die  E're yet they brought their journey to an end  A stranger joined them courteous as a friend  And asked them with a kind engaging air  What their affliction was and begged a share  Informed he gather'd up the broken thread  And truth and wisdom gracing all he said  Explained illustrated and searched so well  The tender theme on which they chose to dwell  That reaching home the night they said is near  We must not now be parted sojourn here  The new acquaintance soon became a guest  And made so welcome at their simple feast  He blessed the bread but vanish'd at the word  And left them both exclaiming 'twas the Lord  Did not our hearts feel all he deigned to say  Did they not burn within us by the way  Now theirs was converse such as it behoves  Man to maintain and such as God approves  Their views indeed were indistinct and dim  But yet successful being aimed at him  Christ and his character their only scope  Their object and their subject and their hope  They felt what it became them much to feel  And wanting him to loose the sacred seal  Found him as prompt as their desire was true  To spread the newborn glories in their view  Wellwhat are ages and the lapse of time  Matched against truths as lasting as sublime  Can length of years on God himself exact  Or make that fiction which was once a fact  Nomarble and recording brass decay  And like the graver's mem'ry pass away  The works of man inherit as is just  Their authors frailty and return to dust  But truth divine for ever stands secure  Its head as guarded as its base is sure  Fixt in the rolling flood of endless years  The pillar of th' eternal plan appears  The raving storm and dashing wave defies  Built by that architect who built the skies  Hearts may be found that harbour at this hour  That love of Christ in all its quick'ning pow'r  And lips unstained by folly or by strife  Whose wisdom drawn from the deep well of life  Tastes of its healthful origin and flows  A Jordan for th' ablution of our woes  Oh days of heav'n and nights of equal praise  Serene and peaceful as those heav'nly days  When souls drawn upward in communion sweet  Enjoy the stillness of some close retreat  Discourse as if released and safe at home  Of dangers past and wonders yet to come  And spread the sacred treasures of the breast  Upon the lap of covenanted rest  What always dreaming over heav'nly things  Like angelheads in stone with pigeonwings  Canting and whining out all day the word  And half the night fanatic and absurd  Mine be the friend less frequent in his pray'rs  Who makes no bustle with his soul's affairs  Whose wit can brighten up a wintry day  And chase the splenetic dull hours away  Content on earth in earthly things to shine  Who waits for heav'n e'er he becomes divine  Leaves saints t' enjoy those altitudes they teach  And plucks the fruit plac'd more within his reach  Well spoken Advocate of sin and shame  Known by thy bleating Ignorance thy name  Is sparkling wit the world's exclusive right  The fixt feesimple of the vain and light  Can hopes of heav'n bright prospects of an hour  That come to waft us out of sorrow's pow'r  Obscure or quench a faculty that finds  Its happiest soil in the serenest minds  Religion curbs indeed its wanton play  And brings the trifler under rig'rous sway  But gives it usefulness unknown before  And purifying makes it shine the more  A Christian's wit is inoffensive light  A beam that aids but never grieves the sight  Vig'rous in age as in the flush of youth  'Tis always active on the side of truth  Temp'rance and peace insure its healthful state  And make it brightest at its latest date  Oh I have seen nor hope perhaps in vain  E'er life go down to see such sights again  A vet'ran warrior in the Christian field  Who never saw the sword he could not wield  Grave without dullness learned without pride  Exact yet not precise though meek keeneyed  A man that would have foiled at their own play  A dozen wouldbe's of the modern day  Who when occasion justified its use  Had wit as bright as ready to produce  Could fetch from records of an earlier age  Or from philosophy's enlighten'd page  His rich materials and regale your ear  With strains it was a privilege to hear  Yet above all his luxury supreme  And his chief glory was the gospel theme  There he was copious as old Greece or Rome  His happy eloquence seem'd there at home  Ambitious not to shine or to excel  But to treat justly what he lov'd so well  It moves me more perhaps than folly ought  When some green heads as void of wit as thought  Suppose  themselves  monopolists of sense  And wiser men's ability pretence  Though time will wear us and we must grow old  Such men are not forgot as soon as cold  Their fragrant mem'ry will out last their tomb  Embalmed for ever in its own perfume  And to say truth though in its early prime  And when unstained with any grosser crime  Youth has a sprightliness and fire to boast  That in the valley of decline are lost  And virtue with peculiar charms appears  Crown'd with the garland of life's blooming years  Yet age by long experience well informed  Well read well temper'd with religion warmed  That fire abated which impells rash youth  Proud of his speed to overshoot the truth  As time improves the grape's authentic juice  Mellows and makes the speech more fit for use  And claims a rev'rence in its short'ning day  That 'tis an honour and a joy to pay  The fruits of age less fair are yet more sound  Than those a brighter season pours around  And like the stores autumnal suns mature  Through wintry rigours unimpaired endure  What is fanatic frenzy scorned so much  And dreaded more than a contagious touch  I grant it dang'rous and approve your fear  That fire is catching if you draw too near  But sage observers oft mistake the flame  And give true piety that odious name  To tremble as the creature of an hour  Ought at the view of an almighty pow'r  Before his presence at whose awful throne  All tremble in all worlds except our own  To supplicate his mercy love his ways  And prize them above pleasure wealth or praise  Though common sense allowed a casting voice  And free from bias must approve the choice  Convicts a man fanatic in th' extreme  And wild as madness in the world's esteem  But that disease when soberly defin'd  Is the false fire of an o'erheated mind  It views the truth with a distorted eye  And either warps or lays it useless by  'Tis narrow selfish arrogant and draws  Its sordid nourishment from man's applause  And while at heart sin unrelinqush'd lies  Presumes itself chief fav'rite of the skies  'Tis such a light as putrefaction breeds  In flyblown flesh whereon the maggot feeds  Shines in the dark but usher'd into day  The stench remains the lustre dies away  True bliss if man may reach it is composed  Of hearts in union mutually disclosed  And farewell else all hope of pure delight  Those hearts should be reclaim'd renew'd upright  Bad men profaning friendship's hallow'd name  Form in its stead a covenant of shame  A dark confed'racy against the laws  Of virtue and religion's glorious cause  They build each other up with dreadful skill  As bastions set pointblank against God's will  Enlarge and fortify the dread redoubt  Deeply resolv'd to shut a Saviour out  Call legions up from hell to back the deed  And curst with conquest finally succeed  But souls that carry on a blest exchange  Of joys they meet with in their heav'nly range  And with a fearless confidence make known  The sorrows sympathy esteems its own  Daily derive encreasing light and force  From such communion in their pleasant course  Feel less the journey's roughness and its length  Meet their opposers with united strength  And one in heart in int'rest and design  Gird up each other to the race divine  But Conversation chuse what theme we may  And chiefly when religion leads the way  Should flow like waters after summer show'rs  Not as if rais'd by mere mechanic pow'rs  The Christian in whose soul though now distress'd  Lives the dear thought of joys he once possess'd  When all his glowing language issued forth  With God's deep stamp upon its current worth  Will speak without disguise and must impart  Sad as it is his undissembling heart  Abhors constraint and dares not feign a zeal  Or seem to boast a fire he does not feel  The song of Sion is a tasteless thing  Unless when rising on a joyful wing  The soul can mix with the celestial bands  And give the strain the compass it demands  Strange tidings these to tell a world who treat  All but their own experience as deceit  Will they believe though credulous enough  To swallow much upon much weaker proof  That there are blest inhabitants of earth  Partakers of a new aethereal birth  Their hopes desires and purposes estranged  From things terrestrial and divinely changed  Their very language of a kind that speaks  The soul's sure int'rest in the good she seeks  Who deal with scripture its importance felt  As Tully with philosophy once dealt  And in the silent watches of the night  And through the scenes of toilrenewing light  The social walk or solitary ride  Keep still the dear companion at their side  Noshame upon a selfdisgracing age  God's work may serve an ape upon a stage  With such a jest as fill'd with hellish glee  Certain invisibles as shrewd as he  But veneration or respect finds none  Save from the subjects of that work alone  The world grown old her deep discernment shows  Claps spectacles on her sagacious nose  Peruses closely the true Christian's face  And finds it a mere mask of sly grimace  Usurps God's office lays his bosom bare  And finds hypocrisy closelurking there  And serving God herself through mere constraint  Concludes his unfeign'd love of him a feint  And yet God knows look human nature through  And in due time the world shall know it too  That since the flow'rs of Eden selt the blast  That after man's defection laid all waste  Sincerity towards th' heartsearching God  Has made the newborn creature her abode  Nor shall be found in unregen'rate souls  Till the last fire burn all between the poles  Sincerity Why 'tis his only pride  Weak and imperfect in all grace beside  He knows that God demands his heart entire  And gives him all his just demands require  Without it his pretensions were as vain  As having it he deems the world's disdain  That great defect would cost him not alone  Man's favourable judgment but his own  His birthright shaken and no longer clear  Than while his conduct proves his heart sincere  Retort the charge and let the world be told  She boasts a confidence she does not hold  That conscious of her crimes she feels instead  A cold misgiving and a killing dread▪  That while in health the ground of her support  Is madly to forget that life is short  That fick she trembles knowing she must die  Her hope presumption and her faith a lie  That while she doats and dreams that she believes  She mocks her maker and herself deceives  Her utmost reach historical assent  The doctrines warpt to what they never meant  That truth itself is in her head as dull  And useless as a candle in a scull  And all her love of God a groundless claim  A trick upon the canvass painted flame  Tell her again the sneer upon her face  And all her censures of the work of grace  Are insincere meant only to conceal  A dread she would not yet is forc'd to feel  That in her heart the Christian she reveres  And while she seems to scorn him only fears  A poet does not work by square or line  As smiths and joiners perfect a design  At least we moderns our attention less  Beyond th' example of our sires digress  And claim a right to scamper and run wide  Wherever chance caprice or fancy guide  The world and I fortuitously met  I ow'd a trifle and have paid the debt  She did me wrong I recompens'd the deed  And having struck the balance now procecd  Perhaps however as some years have pass'd  Since she and I conversed together last  And I have liv'd recluse in rural shades  Which seldom a distinct report pervades  Great changes and new manners have occurr'd  And blest reforms that I have never heard  And she may now be as discreet and wise  As once absurd in all discerning eyes  Sobriety perhaps may now be found  Where once intoxication press'd the ground  The subtle and injurious may be just  And he grown chaste that was the slave of lust  Arts once esteem'd may be with shame dismiss'd  Charity may relax the miser's fist  The gamester may have cast his cards away  Forgot to curse and only kneel to pray  It has indeed been told me with what weight  How credibly 'tis hard for me to state  That fable's old that seem'd for ever mute  Reviv'd are hast'ning into fresh repute  And gods and goddesses discarded long  Like useless lumber or a stroller's fong  Are bringing into vogue their heathen train  And Jupiter bids fair to rule again  That certain feasts are instituted now  Where Venus hears the lover's tender vow  That all Olympus through the country roves  To consecrate our few remaining groves  And echo learns politely to repeat  The praise of names for ages obsolete  That having proved the weakness it should seem  Of revelation's ineffectual beam  To bring the passions under sober sway  And give the moral springs their proper play  They mean to try what may at last be done  By stout substantial gods of wood and stone  And whether Roman rites may not produce  The virtues of old Rome for English use  May much success attend the pious plan  May Mercury once more embellish man  Grace him again with long forgotten arts  Reclaim his taste and brighten up his parts  Make him athletic as in days of old  Learn'd at the bar in the paloestra bold  Divest the rougher sex of female airs  And teach the softer not to copy theirs  The change shall please nor shall it matter aught  Who works the wonder if it be but wrought  'Tis time hoewever if the case stand thus  For us plain folks and all who side with us  To build our altar confident and bold  And say as stern Elijah said of old  The strife now stands upon a fair award  If Is'rael's Lord be God then serve the Lord  If he be silent faith is all a whim  Then Baal is the God and worship him  Digression is so much in modern use  Thought is so rare and fancy so profuse  Some never seem so wide of their intent  As when returning to the theme they meant  As mendicants whose business is to roam  Make ev'ry parish but their own their home  Though such continual zigzags in a book  Such drunken reelings have an aukward look  And I had rather creep to what is true  Than rove and stagger with no mark in view  Yet to consult a little seem'd no crime  The freakish humour of the present time  But now to gather up what seems dispers'd  And touch the subject I design'd at first  May prove though much beside the rules of art  Best for the public and my wisest part  And first let no man charge me that I mean  To cloath in sables every social scene  And give good company a face severe  As if they met around a father's bier  For tell some men that pleasure all their bent  And laughter all their work is life mispent  Their wisdom bursts into this sage reply  Then mirth is sin and we should always cry  To find the medium asks some share of wit  And therefore 'tis a mark fools never hit  But though life's valley be a vale of tears  A brighter scene beyond that vale appears  Whose glory with a light that never fades  Shoots between scattered rocks and opening shades  And while it shows the land the soul desires  The language of the land she seeks inspires  Thus touched the tongue receives a sacred cure  Of all that was absurd profane impure  Held within modest bounds the tide of speech  Pursues the course that truth and nature teach  No longer labours merely to produce  The pomp of sound or tinkle without use  Where'er it winds the salutary stream  Sprightly and fresh enriches ev'ry theme  While all the happy man possess'd before  The gift of nature or the classic store  Is made subservient to the grand design  For which heav'n form'd the faculty divine  So should an ideot while at large he strays  Find the sweet lyre on which an artist plays  With rash and aukward force the chords he shakes  And grins with wonder at the jar he makes  But let the wise and wellinstructed hand  Once take the shell beneath his just command  In gentle sounds it seems as it complained  Of the rude injuries it late sustained  'Till tun'd at length to some immortal song  It sounds Jehovah's name and pours his praise along  RETIREMENT  studiis florens ignobilis oti  VIRG GEOR LIB  HACKNEY'D in business wearied at that oar  Which thousands once fast chain'd to quit no more  But which when life at ebb runs weak and low  All wish or seem to wish they could forego  The statesman lawyer merchant man of

He may possess the joys he thinks he sees  Lay his old age upon the lap of ease  Improve the remnant of his wasted span  And having liv'd a trifler die a man  Thus conscience pleads her cause within the breast  Though long rebell'd against not yet suppress'd  And calls a creature formed for God alone  For heaven's high purposes and not his own  Calls him away from selfish ends and aims  From what debilitates and what inflames  From cities humming with a restless crowd  Sordid as active ignorant as loud  Whose highest praise is that they live in vain  The dupes of pleasure or the slaves of gain  Where works of man are cluster'd close around  And works of God are hardly to be found  To regions where in spite of sin and woe  Traces of Eden are still seen below  Where mountain river forest field and grove  Remind him of his Maker's pow'r and love  'Tis well if look'd for at so late a day  In the last scene of such a senseless play  True wisdom will attend his feeble call  And grace his action e'er the curtain fall  Souls that have long despised their heav'nly birth  Their wishes all impregnated with earth  For threescore years employed with ceaseless care  In catching smoke and feeding upon air  Conversant only with the ways of men  Rarely redeem the short remaining ten  Invet'rate habits choak th' unfruitful heart  Their fibres penetrate its tend'rest part  And draining its nutritious pow'rs to feed  Their noxious growth starve ev'ry better seed  Happy if full of daysbut happier far  If e'er we yet discern life's evening star  Sick of the service of a world that feeds

that he has made  To trace in nature's most minute design  The signature and stamp of pow'r divine  Contrivance intricate express'd with ease  Where unassisted sight no beauty sees  The shapely limb and lubricated joint  Within the small dimensions of a point  Muscle and nerve miraculously spun  His mighty work who speaks and it is done  Th' invisible in things scarce seen reveal'd  To whom an atom is an ample field  To wonder at a thousand insect forms  These hatch'd and those resuscitated worms  New life ordain'd and brighter scenes to share  Once prone on earth now buoyant upon air  Whose shape would make them had they bulk and size  More hideous foes than fancy can devise  With helmed heads and dragon scales adorn'd  The mighty myriads now securely scorn'd  Would mock the majesty of man's high birth  Despise his bulwarks and unpeople earth  Then with a glance of fancy to survey  Far as the faculty can stretch away  Ten thousand rivers poured at his command  From urns that never fail through ev'ry land  These like a deluge with impetuous force  Those winding modestly a silent course  The cloudsurmounting alps the fruitful vales  Seas on which ev'ry nation spreads her sails  The sun a world whence other worlds drink light  The crescent moon the diadem of night  Stars countless each in his appointed place  Fastanchor'd in the deep abyss of space  At such a sight

and rulers what have courts to show  Thus studied used and consecrated thus  Whatever  is  seems form'd indeed for us  Not as the plaything of a froward child  Fretful unless diverted and beguiled  Much less to feed and fan the fatal fires  Of pride ambition or impure desires  But as a scale by which the soul ascends  From mighty means to more important ends  Securely though by steps but rarely trod  Mounts from inferior beings up to God  And sees by no fallacious light or dim  Earth made for man and man himself for him  Not that I mean t' approve or would inforce  A superstitious and monastic course  Truth is not local God alike pervades  And fills the world of traffic and the shades  And may be fear'd amid the busiest scenes  Or scorn'd where business never intervenes  But 'tis not easy with a mind like ours  Conscious of weakness in its noblest pow'rs  And in a world where other ills apart  The roving eye misleads the careless heart  To limit thought by nature prone to stray  Wherever freakish fancy points the way  To bid the pleadings of selflove be still  Resign our own and seek our maker's will  To spread the page of scripture and compare  Our conduct with the laws engraven there  To measure all that passes in the breast  Faithfully fairly by that sacred test  To dive into the secret deeps within  To spare no passion and no fav'rite sin  And search the themes important above all  Ourselves and our recov'ry from our fall  But leisure silence and a mind releas'd  From anxious thoughts how wealth may be encreas'd  How to secure in some propitious hour  The point of int'rest or the post of power  A soul serene and equally retired  From objects too much dreaded or desired  Safe from the clamours of perverse dispute  At least are friendly to the great pursuit  Op'ning the map of God's extensive plan  We find a little isle this life of man  Eternity's unknown expanse appears  Circling around and limiting his years  The busy race examine and explore  Each creek and cavern of the dang'rous shore  With care collect what in their eyes excells  Some shining pebbles and some weeds and shells  Thus laden dream that they are rich and great  And happiest he that groans beneath his weight  The waves o'ertake them in their serious play  And ev'ry hour sweep multitudes away  They shriek and sink survivors start and weep  Pursue their sport and follow to the deep  A few forsake the throng with lifted eyes  Ask wealth of heav'n and gain a real prize  Truth wisdom grace and peace like that above  Seal'd with his signet whom they serve and love  Scorn'd by the rest with patient hope they wait  A kind release from their imperfect state  And unregretted are soon snatch'd away  From scenes of sorrow into glorious day  Nor these alone prefer a life recluse  Who seek retirement for its proper use  The love of change that lives in ev'ry breast  Genius and temper and desire of rest  Discordant motives in one center meet  And each inclines it's vot'ry to retreat  Some minds by nature are averse to noise  And hate the tumult half the world enjoys  The lure of av'rice or the pompous prize  That courts display before ambitious eyes  The fruits that hang on pleasure's flow'ry stem  Whate'er enchants them are no snares to them  To them the deep recess of dusky groves  Or forest where the deer securely roves  The fall of waters and the song of birds  And hills that echo to the distant herds  Are luxuries excelling all the glare  The world can boast and her chief fav'rites share  With eager step and carelessly array'd  For such a cause the poet seeks the shade  From all he sees he catches new delight  Pleas'd fancy claps her pinions at the sight  The rising or the setting orb of day  The clouds that flit or slowly float away  Nature in all the various shapes she wears  Frowning in storms or breathing gentle airs  The snowy robe her wintry state assumes  Her summer heats her fruits and her perfumes  All all alike transport the glowing bard  Success in rhime his glory and reward  Oh nature whose Elysian scenes disclose  His bright perfections at whose word they rose  Next to that pow'r who form'd thee and sustains  Be thou the great inspirer of my strains  Still as I touch the lyre do thou expand  Thy genuine charms and guide an artless hand  That I may catch a fire but rarely known  Give useful light though I should miss renown  And poring on thy page whose ev'ry line  Bears proof of an intelligence divine  May feel an heart enrich'd by what it pays  That builds its glory on its Maker's praise  Woe to the man whose wit disclaims its use  Glitt'ring in vain or only to seduce  Who studies nature with a wanton eye  Admires the work but slips the lesson by  His hours of leisure and recess employs  In drawing pictures of forbidden joys  Retires to blazon his own worthless name  Or shoot the careless with a surer aim  The lover too shuns business and alarms  Tender idolator of absent charms  Saints offer nothing in their warmest prayr's  That he devotes not with a zeal like theirs  'Tis consecration of his heart soul time  And every thought that wanders is a crime  In sighs he worships his supremely fair  And weeps a sad libation in despair  Adores a creature and devout in vain  Wins in return an answer of disdain  As woodbine weds the plants within her reach  Rough elm or smoothgrain'd ash or glossy beech  In spiral rings ascends the trunk and lays  Her golden tassels on the leafy sprays  But does a mischief while she lends a grace  Streight'ning its growth by such a strict embrace  So love that clings around the noblest minds  Forbids th' advancement of the soul he binds  The suitor's air indeed he soon improves  And forms it to the taste of her he loves  Teaches his eyes a language and no less  Refines his speech and fashions his address  But farewell promises of happier fruits  Manly designs and learning's grave pursuits  Girt with a chain he cannot wish to break  His

always free  To carve his rustic name upon a tree  To snare the mole or with illfashion'd hook  To draw th' incautious minnow from the brook  Are life's prime pleasures in his simple view  His flock the chief concern he ever knew  She shines but little in his heedless eyes  The good we never miss we rarely prize  But ask the noble drudge in stateaffairs  Escap'd from office and its constant cares  What charms he sees in freedom's smile express'd  In freedom lost so long now repossess'd  The tongue whose strains were cogent as commands  Revered at home and felt in foreign lands  Shall own itself a stamm'rer in that cause  Or plead its silence as its best applause  He knows indeed that whether dress'd or rude  Wild without art or artfully subdued  Nature in ev'ry form inspires delight  But never mark'd her with so just a sight  Her hedge row shrubs a variegated store  With woodbine and wild roses mantled o'er  Green baulks and furrow'd lands the stream that spreads  Its cooling vapour o'er the dewy meads  Downs that almost escape th' enquiring eye  That melt and fade into the distant skie  Beauties he lately slighted as he pass'd  Seem all created since he travell'd last  Master of all th' enjoyments he design'd  No rough annoyance rankling in his mind  What early philosophic hours he keeps  How regular his meals how sound he sleeps  Not sounder he that on the mainmast head  While morning kindles with a windy red  Begins a long lookout for distant land  Nor quits till eveningwatch his giddy stand  Then swift descending with a seaman's haste  Slips to his hammock and forgets the blast  He chuses company but not the squire's  Whose wit is rudeness whose good breeding tires  Nor yet the parson's who would gladly come  Obsequious when abroad though proud at home  Nor can he much affect the neighb'ring peer  Whose toe of emulation treads too near  But wisely seeks a more convenient friend  With whom dismissing forms he may unbend  A man whom marks of condescending grace  Teach while they flatter him his proper place  Who comes when call'd and at a word withdraws  Speaks with reserve and listens with applause  Some plain mechanic who without pretence  To birth or wit nor gives nor takes offence  On whom he rests well pleas'd his weary pow'rs  And talks and laughs away his vacant hours  The tide of life swift always in its course  May run in cities with a brisker force  But no where with a current so serene  Or half so clear as in the rural scene  Yet how fallacious is all earthly bliss  What obvious truths the wisest heads may miss  Some pleasures live a month and some a year  But short the date of all we gather here  Nor happiness is felt except the true  That does not charm the more for being new  This observation as it chanced not made  Or if the thought occurr'd not duely weigh'd  He sighsfor after all by slow degrees  The spot he loved has lost the pow'r to please  To cross his ambling poney day by day  Seems at the best but dreaming life away  The prospect such as might enchant despair  He views it not or sees no beauty there  With aching heart and discontented looks  Returns at noon to billiards or to books  But feels while grasping at his faded joys  A secret thirst of his renounced employs  He chides the tardiness of every post  Pants to be told of battles won or lost  Blames his own indolence observes though late  'Tis criminal to leave a sinking state  Flies to the levee and receiv'd with grace  Kneels kisses hands and shines again in place  Suburban villas highwayside retreats  That dread th' encroachment of our growing streets  Tight boxes neatly sash'd and in a blaze  With all a July sun's collected rays  Delight the citizen who gasping there  Breathes clouds of dust and calls it country air  Oh sweet retirement who would baulk the thought  That could afford retirement or could not  'Tis such an easy walk so smooth and strait  The second milestone fronts the garden gate  A step if fair and if a show'r approach  You find safe shelter in the next stagecoach  There prison'd in a parlour snug and small  Like bottled wasps upon a southern wall  The man of bus'ness and his friends compress'd  Forget their labours and yet find no rest  But still 'tis ruraltrees are to be seen  From ev'ry window and the fields are green  Ducks paddle in the pond before the door  And what could a remoter scene show more  A sense of elegance we rarely find  The portion of a mean or vulgar mind  And ignorance of better things makes man  Who cannot much rejoice in what he can  And he that deems his leisure well bestow'd  In contemplations of a turnpike road  Is occupied as well employs his hours  As wisely and as much improves his pow'rs  As he that slumbers in pavilion's graced  With all the charms of an accomplish'd taste  Yet hence alas Insolvencies and hence  Th' unpitied victim of illjudg'd expence  From all his wearisome engagements freed  Shakes hands with bus'ness and retires indeed  Your prudent grand mammas ye modern belles  Content with Bristol Bath and Tunbridgewells  When health requir'd it would consent to roam  Else more attach'd to pleasures found at home  But now alike gay widow virgin wife  Ingenious to diversify dull life  In coaches chaises caravans and hoys  Fly to the coast for daily nightly joys  And all impatient of dry land agree  With one consent to rush into the sea  Ocean exhibits fathomless and broad  Much of the pow'r and majesty of God  He swathes about the swelling of the deep  That shines and rests as infants smile and sleep  Vast as it is it answers as it flows  The breathings of the lightest air that blows  Curling and whit'ning over all the waste  The rising waves obey th' increasing blast  Abrupt and horrid as the tempest roars  Thunder and flash upon the stedfast shores  'Till he that rides the whirlwind checks the rein  Then all the world of waters sleeps again  Nereids or Dryads as the fashion leads  Now in the floods now panting in the meads  Vot'ries of pleasure still where'er she dwells  Near barren rocks in palaces or cells  Oh grant a poet leave to recommend  A poet fond of nature and your friend  Her slighted works to your admiring view  Her works must needs excel who fashion'd you  Would ye when rambling in your morning ride  With some unmeaning coxcomb at your side  Condemn the prattler for his idle pains  To waste unheard the music of his strains  And deaf to all the impertinence of tongue  That while it courts affronts and does you wrong  Mark well the finish'd plan without a fault  The seas globose and huge th' o'erarching vault  Earth's millions daily fed a world employ'd  In gath'ring plenty yet to be enjoy'd  'Till gratitude grew vocal in the praise  Of God beneficent in all his ways  Grac'd with such wisdom how would beauty shine  Ye want but that to seem indeed divine  Anticipated rents and bills unpaid  Force many a shining youth into the shade  Not to redeem his time but his

 And whistling as if unconcern'd and gay  Curried his nag and look'd another way  Convinc'd at last upon a nearer view  'Twas he the same the very Jack he knew  O'erwhelm'd at once with wonder grief and joy  He press'd him much to quit his base employ  His countenance his purse his heart his hand  Infl'ence and pow'r were all at his command  Peers are not always gen'rous as wellbred  But Granby

some by deep disgust  Some selfimpoverish'd and because they must  But few that court Retirement are aware  Of half the toils they must encounter there  Lucrative offices are seldom lost  For want of pow'rs proportion'd to the post  Give ev'n a dunce th' employment he desires  And he soon finds the talents it requires  A business with an income at its heels  Furnishes always oil for its own wheels  But in his arduous enterprize to close  His active years with indolent repose  He finds the labours of that state exceed  His utmost faculties severe indeed  'Tis easy to resign a toilsome place  But not to manage leisure with a grace  Absence of occupation is not rest  A mind quite vacant is a mind distress'd  The vet'ran steed excused his task at length  In kind compassion of his failing strength  And turn'd into the park or mead to graze  Exempt from future service all his days  There feels a pleasure perfect in its kind  Ranges at liberty and snuffs the wind  But when his lord would quit the busy road  To taste a joy like that he has bestow'd  He proves less happy than his favour'd brute  A life of ease a difficult pursuit  Thought to the man that never thinks may seem  As natural as when asleep to dream  But reveries for human minds will act  Specious in show impossible in fact  Those flimsy webs that break as soon as wrought  Attain not to the dignity of thought  Nor

outline of the present transient state  And after poising her advent'rous wings  Settling at last upon eternal things  Far more intelligent and better taught  The strenuous use of profitable thought  Than ye when happiest and enlighten'd most  And highest in renown can justly boast  A mind unnerv'd or indispos'd to bear  The weight of subjects worthiest of her care  Whatever hopes a change of scene inspires  Must change her nature or in vain retires  An idler is a watch that wants both hands  As useless if it goes as when it stands  Books therefore not the scandal of the shelves  In which lewd sensualists print out themselves  Nor those in which the stage gives vice a blow  With what success let modern manners show  Nor his who for the bane of thousands born  Built God a church and laugh'd his word to scorn  Skilful alike to seem devout and just  And stab religion with a sly sidethrust  Nor those of learn'd philologists who chase  A panting syllable through time and space  Start it at home and hunt it in the dark  To Gaul to Greece and into Noah's ark  But such as learning without false pretence  The friend of truth th' associate of sound sense  And such as in the zeal of good design  Strong judgment lab'ring in rhe scripture mine  All such as manly and great souls produce  Worthy to live and of eternal use  Behold in these what leisure hours demand  Amusement and true

rank odor upon thorny lands  And while experience cautions us in vain  Grasp seeming happiness and find it pain  Despondence selfdeserted in her grief  Lost by abandoning her own relief  Murmuring and ungrateful discontent  That scorns afflictions mercifully meant  Those humours tart as wines upon the fret  Which idleness and weariness beget  These and a thousand plagues that haunt the breast  Fond

Island of  JUAN FERNANDEZ      I AM monarch of all I survey  My right there is none to dispute  From the center all round to the sea  I am lord of the fowl and the brute  Oh solitude where are the charms  That sages have seen in the face  Better dwell in the midst of alarms  Than reign in this horrible place    I am out of humanity's reach  I must finish my journey alone  Never hear the sweet music of speech  I start at the sound of my own  The beasts that roam over the plain  My form with indifference see  They are so unacquainted with man  Their tameness is shocking to me    Society friendship and love  Divinely bestow'd upon man  Oh had I the wings of a dove  How soon wou'd I taste you again  My sorrows I then might assuage  In the ways of religion and truth  Might learn from the wisdom of age  And be cheer'd by the fallies of youth    Religion what treasure untold  Resides in that heav'nly word  More precious than silver and gold  Or all that this earth can afford  But the sound of the church going bell  These vallies and rocks never heard  Ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell  Or smil'd when a sabbath appear'd    Ye winds that have made me your sport  Convey to this desolate shore  Some cordial endearing report  Of a land I shall visit no more  My friends do they now and then send  A wish or a thought after me  O tell me I yet have a friend  Though a friend I am never to see    How fleet is a glance of the mind  Compar'd with the speed of its flight  The tempest itself lags behind  And the swift winged arrows of light  When I think of my own native land  In a moment I seem to be there  But alas recollection at hand  Soon hurries me back to despair    But the sea fowl is gone to her nest  The beast is laid down in his lair  Ev'n here is a season of

The sweets that I was wont to share  The banquet of thy smiles    The great the gay shall they partake  The heav'n that thou alone canst make  And wilt thou quit the stream  That murmurs through the

set them unhappily wrong  The point in dispute was as all the world knows  To which the said spectacles ought to belong    So the Tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause  With a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning  While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws  So fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning    In behalf of the Nose it will quickly appear  And your lordship he said will undoubtedly find  That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear  Which amounts to possession time out of mind    Then holding the spectacles up to the court  Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle  As wide as the ridge of the Nose is in short  Design'd to sit close to it just like a saddle    Again would your lordship a moment suppose  'Tis a case that has happen'd and may be again  That the visage or countenance had not a Nose  Pray who wou'd or who cou'd wear spectacles then    On the whole it appears and my argument shows  With a reasoning the court will never condemn  That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose  And the Nose was as plainly intended for them    Then shifting his side as a lawyer knows how  He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes  But what were his arguments few people know  For the court did not think they were equally wise    So his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone  Decisive and clear without one if or but  That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on  By daylight or candlelightEyes should be shut  On the Burning of  LORD MANSFIELD'S  Library together with his MSS by the Mob in the Month of June    SO thenthe Vandals of our

well he might  The keen demands of appetite  When looking eagerly around  He spied far off upon the ground  A something shining in the dark  And knew the glowworm by his spark  So stooping down from hawthorn top  He thought to put him in his crop  The worm aware of his intent  Harangu'd him thus right eloquent  Did you admire my lamp quoth he  As much as I your minstrelsy  You would abhor to do me wrong  As much as I to spoil your song  For 'twas the selfsame power divine  Taught you to sing and me to shine  That you with music I with light  Might beautify and cheer the night  The songster heard his short oration  And warbling out his approbation  Releas'd him as my story tells  And found a supper somewhere else  Hence jarring sectaries may learn  Their real int'rest to discern  That brother should not war with brother  And worry and devour each other  But sing and shine by sweet consent  'Till life's poor transient night is spent  Respecting in each other's case  The gifts of nature and of grace  Those christians best deserve the name  Who studiously make peace their aim  Peace both the duty and the prize  Of him that creeps and him that flies  VOTUM  O matutini rores

GOLDFINCH  starved to Death in his Cage    TIME was when I was free as air  The thistles downy seed my fare  My drink the morning dew  I perch'd at will on ev'ry spray  My form genteel my plumage gay  My strains for ever new    But gawdy plumage sprightly strain  And form genteel were all in vain  And of a transient date  For caught and caged and starved to death  In dying sighs my little breath  Soon pass'd the wiry grate    Thanks gentle swain for all my  And thanks for this effectual close  And cure of ev'ry ill  More cruelty could none express  And I if you had shewn me less  Had been your

spoiler came  And search'd for crannies in the frame  Urg 'd his attempt on ev'ry side  To ev'ry pane his trunk applied  But still in vain the frame was tight  And only pervious to the light  Thus having wasted half the day  He trimmed his flight another way  Methinks I said in thee I find  The sin and madness of mankind  To joys forbidden man aspires  Consumes his soul with vain desires  Folly the spring of his pursuit  And disappointment all the fruit  While Cynthio ogles as she passes  The nymph between two chariot glasses  She is the pine apple and he  The silly unsuccessful bee  The maid who views with pensive air  The showglass fraught with glitt'ring ware  Sees watches bracelets rings and lockets  But sighs at thought of empty pockets  Like thine her appetite is keen  But ah the cruel glass between  Our dear delights are often such  Expos'd to view but not to touch  The sight our foolish heart inflames  We long for pine apples in frames  With hopeless wish one looks and lingers  One breaks the glass and cuts his fingers  But they whom truth and wisdom lead  Can gather honey from a weed  HORACE Book the d ODE the th    RECEIVE dear friend the truths I teach  So shalt

worm is known to stray  That shews by night a lucid beam  Which disappears by day    Disputes have been and still prevail  From whence his rays proceed  Some give that honour to his tail  And others to his head    But this is surethe hand of might  That kindles up the skies  Gives  him  a modicum of light  Proportion'd to his size    Perhaps indulgent nature meant  By such a lamp bestow'd  To bid the trav'ler as he went  Be careful where he trod    Nor crush a worm whose useful light  Might serve however small  To shew a stumbling stone by night  And save him from a fall    Whate'er she meant

pleases him  He chooses it the rather    Fond of the speculative height  Thither he wings his airy flight  And thence securely sees  The bustle and the rareeshow  That occupy mankind below  Secure and at his ease    You think no doubt he sits and muses  On future broken bones and bruises  If he should chance to fall  No not a single thought like that  Employs his philosophic pate  Or troubles it at all    He sees that this great roundabout  The world with all its motley rout  Church army physic law  Its customs and its businesses  Are no concern at all of his  And says what says he Caw    Thrice

Every dish and spoil the best  Frisking thus before the fire  Thou hast all thine heart's desire    Though in voice and shape they be  Form'd as if akin to thee  Thou surpassest happier far  Happiest

Sought with an indignant mien  Counsel of her country's gods    Sage beneath a spreading oak  Sat the Druid hoary chief  Ev'ry burning word he spoke  Full of rage and full of grief    Princess if our aged eyes  Weep upon thy matchless wrongs  'Tis because resentment ties  All the terrors of our tongues    Rome shall perishwrite that word  In the blood that she has spilt  Perish hopeless and abhorr'd  Deep in ruin as in guilt    Rome for empire far renown'd  Tramples on a thousand states  Soon her pride shall kiss the ground  Hark the Gaul is at her gates    Other Romans shall arise  Heedless of a soldier's name  Sounds not arms shall win the prize  Harmony the path to fame    Then the progeny that springs  From the forests of our land  Arm'd with thunder clad with wings  Shall a wider world command    Regions Caesar never knew  Thy posterity shall sway  Where his eagles never flew  None invincible as they    Such the bards prophetic words  Pregnant with celestial fire  Bending as he swept the chords  Of his sweet but awful lyre    She with all a monarch's pride  Felt them in her bosom glow  Rush'd to battle fought and died  Dying hurl'd them at the foe    Ruffians pittiless as proud  Heav'n awards the vengeance due  Empire is on us bestow'd  Shame and ruin wait for you  HEROISM  THERE was a time when Aetna's silent fire  Slept unperceiv'd the mountain yet entire  When conscious of no danger from below  She towr'd a cloudcapt pyramid of snow  No thunders shook with deep intestine sound  The blooming groves that girdled her around  Her unctuous olives and her purple vines  Unfelt the fury of those bursting mines  The peasant's hopes and not in vain assur'd  In peace upon her sloping sides matur'd  When on a day like that of the last doom  A conflagration lab'ring in her womb  She teem'd and heav'd with an infernal birth  That shook the circling seas and solid earth  Dark and voluminous the vapours rise  And hang their horrors in the neighb'ring skies  While through the stygian veil that blots the day  In dazzling streaks the vivid light'nings play  But oh what muse and in what pow'rs of song  Can trace the torrent as it burns along  Havock and devastation in the van  It marches o'er the prostrate works of man  Vines olives herbage forests disappear  And all the charms of a Sicilian year  Revolving seasons fruitless as they pass  See it an uninform'd and idle mass  Without a soil t'invite the tiller's care  Or blade that might redeem it from despair  Yet time at length what will not time atchieve  Cloaths it with earth and bids the produce live  Once more the spiry myrtle crowns the glade  And ruminating flocks enjoy the shade  Oh bliss precarious and unsafe retreats  Oh charming paradise of short liv'd sweets  The selfsame gale that wafts the fragrance round  Brings to the distant ear a sullen sound  Again the mountain feels th' imprison'd foe  Again pours ruin on the vale below  Ten thousand swains the wasted scene deplore  That only future ages can restore  Ye monarchs whom the lure of honour draws  Who write in blood the merits of your cause  Who strike the blow then plead your own defence  Glory your aim but justice your pretence  Behold in Aetna's emblematic fires  The mischiefs your ambitious pride inspires  Fast by the stream that bounds your just domain  And tells you where ye have a right to reign  A nation dwells not envious of your throne  Studious of peace their neighbours and their own  Illfated race how deeply must they rue  Their only crime vicinity to you  The trumpet sounds your legions swarm abroad  Through the ripe harvest lies their destin'd road  At ev'ry step beneath their feet they tread  The life of multitudes a nation's bread  Earth seems a garden in its loveliest dress  Before them and behind a wilderness  Famine and pestilence her firstborn son  Attend to finish what the sword begun  And ecchoing praises such as fiends might earn  And folly pays resound at your return  A calm succeedsbut plenty with her train  Of heartfelt joys succeeds not soon again  And years of pining indigence must show  What scourges are the gods that rule below  Yet man laborious man by slow degrees  Such is his thirst of opulence and ease  Plies all the sinews of industrious toil  Gleans up the refuse of the general spoil  Rebuilds the towr's that smok'd upon the plain  And the sun gilds the shining spires again  Increasing commerce and reviving art  Renew the quarrel on the conqu'rors part  And the sad lesson must be learn'd once more  That wealth within is ruin at the door  What are ye monarchs laurel'd heroes say  But Aetnas of the suff'ring world ye sway  Sweet nature stripp'd of her embroider'd robe  Deplores the wasted regions of her globe  And stands a witness at truth's awful bar  To prove you there destroyers as ye are  Oh place me in some heav'nprotected isle  Where peace and equity and freedom smile  Where no Volcano pours his fiery flood  No crested warrior dips his plume in blood  Where pow'r secures what industry has won  Where to succeed is not to be undone  A land that distant tyrants hate in vain  In Britain's isle beneath a George's reign

condemned to dwell  For ever in my native shell  Ordain'd to move when others please  Not for my own content or ease  But toss'd and buffeted about  Now  in  the water and now  out  'Twere better to be born a stone  Of ruder shape and feeling none  Than with a tenderness like mine  And sensibilities so fine  I envy that unfeeling shrub  Fastrooted against ev'ry rub  The plant he meant grew not far off  And felt the sneer with scorn enough  Was hurt disgusted mortified  And with asperity replied  When cry the botanists and stare  Did plants call'd sensitive grow there  No matter whena poet's muse is  To make them grow just where she chuses  You shapeless nothing in a dish  You that are but almost a fish  I scorn your coarse insinuation  And have most plentiful occasion  To wish myself the rock I view  Or such another dolt as you  For many a grave and learned clerk  And many a gay unletter'd spark  With curious touch examines me  If I can feel as well as he  And when I bend retire and shrink  Says well'tis more than one would think  Thus life is spent oh fie upon't  In being touch'd and crying don't  A poet in his evening walk  O'erheard and check'd this idle talk  And your fine sense he said and yours  Whatever evil it endures  Deserves not if so soon offended  Much to be pitied or commended  Disputes though short are far too long  Where both alike are in the wrong  Your feelings in their full amount  Are all upon your own account  You in your grottowork inclos'd  Complain of being thus expos'd  Yet nothing feel in that rough coat  Save when the knife is at your throat  Wherever driv'n by wind or tide  Exempt from every ill beside  And as for you my Lady Squeamish  Who reckon ev'ry touch a blemish  If all the plants that can be found  Embellishing the scene around  Should droop and wither where they grow  You would not feel at all not you  The noblest minds their virtue prove  By pity sympathy and love  These these are feelings truly fine  And prove
