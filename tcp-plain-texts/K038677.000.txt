 A LETTER FROM A Right Honourable PERSON And the Answer to it Translated into Verse as nearly as the different Idioms of PROSE and POETRY will allow With Notes Historical Critical Political  c  LONDON Printed for W NICOLL in St Paul's Church Yard MDCCLXI  The PREFACE  WHEN first of a thousand times I read these curious epistles which here I consecrate to rhime and immortality when I found them equally fraught with historical truth as with political wisdom equally distinguished for elegance of manners and accuracy of style I lamented that they were composed of perishable prosaick materials With what sincere concern did I reflect that they must soon too soon be lost to remembrance or be sent in their newspapers perhaps to  Jamaica  to exercise the criticism of sugarplanters Negroes and Creolians I deplored the fate of the great man to whom the second letter is addressed whose  good  fame  o tempera o mores  is hardly likely to survive his virtue even in a monument erected to the VIRO IMMORTALI  I CONSIDERED from whence this calamity could arise and I was immediately convinced that if Homer had written the wrath of Achilles or Virgil the loves of Dido in prose the hero and the heroine must have long since experienced the common fate of mortality The Muses the Muses alone have the privelege of giving immortality  Musa vetat mori  Yet even the Muses cannot give it in prose Shall it then hereafter be said that two such personages as these writers  appear to be in each other's Letters so eminently distinguished for their integrity patriotism abilities and how tender is the expression for their  kind friendship  Vid Mr Pt's Letter  shall they die like mere mortals  quia carent vate sacro  because  No bard had they to make all time their own  ANIMATED by these and other reflections equally powerful I determined to snatch these charming letters from oblivion to give them to immortality by  doing  them into verse as nearly as the different idioms of prose and poetry can allow and then to place them in friendly opposition to each other like pictures hung in contrast to illustrate each other's beauties  THAT they are equally susceptible of all the most luxurious ornaments of poetry every critick must allow nor if he be a critick of any tolerable sagacity can he hesitate even a moment in pronouncing that they are the works of the same master Is there not the same everlasting length of period the same manly disregard to grammar the same loose unconnected texture of expression the same inconclusive unconsequential reasoning so peculiarly fitted to the freedom and ease of epistolary writing Beauties like these it is confessed have a kind of originality which it is almost impossible to preserve in a translation Yet the reader will find it hath been boldly attempted and his candour will determine I hope not unfavourably of the success  IN an humble consciousness of having merited that  success  by the  fidelity  of this translation I shall venture to assert what few modern translators can presume to assert that it sometimes rises superior in sublimity and beauty even to the original This superiority no doubt proceeds  from a secret charm that in general animates the language of poetry and particularly from the harmony of the numbers which I have not injudiciously chosen Be it known therefore to all our minor poets that doggrel is the proper measure for the sublime ideas of modern patriotism panegyrick and addresses of which I shall convince the world as soon as a certain address to his My I beg pardon I mean to his minister shall make its appearance  BUT not panegyrick alone nor patriotism have their proper and peculiar measures in poetry When the ladies write love letters all the numbers are elegiack When our patriotcommoner raises his voice to assert the rights of the people to deplore the errour of administration or to vindicate his own injured reputation from the misrepresentations of credulity and calumny his diction instantly assumes the pomp of blank verse Lastly when Mr Pt and Mr Bd oblige the world with a private publick correspondence the mutual acknowledgments of each other's merit their  kind  professions of friendship and esteem naturally sink together into doggrel  HOWEVER I am in christian charity I bear no malice to prose or prosemen I think it falls down very naturally in notes remarks and annotations to the bottom of the page Witness doctor Wn's two huge coloumns of criticism to support and explain two lines of Mr Pope's poetry In humble imitation of this rightreverend canonist in criticism I have bottomed my pages with notes  variorum  I do not mean the  variorum  of persons only but of learning morality criticism politicks and panegyrick I confess I have almost exhausted my common placebook no matter I shall easily fill it again with quotations of learning from our illustrious moderns and maxims of politicks from the common council at Guildhall  THE publick no doubt ingratitude as well as curiosity will expect to be informed WHO and WHAT are the writers to whom they are obliged for these letters who have published them for their own  spontaneous  bounty  unsolicited  and  unmerited  as the pension of Kings who is this right honourable person and his friend Mr this  pius Aeneas  and his  fidus Achiates  this second Sir James Hs who vouches for the sentiments of the city  THE last Hague Gazette has translated one of these letters into French and assures us that it is writen by the right honourable Mr Pitt to the Lord Mayor of London whom it frequently styles MON CHER MOXSIEUR It likewise informs us that Mr Pitt although dismissed from his Office yet regularly attends the frequent Councils held at Court But as we have some reason to believe that this intelligence is a little premature that it is at present and probably will be for ever a mistake we may therefore believe there may possibly be some mistake in the other instance If indeed it were only a trivial anachronism in calling Mr Bd MY LORD or might we think it prophetick of the next Year's Mayorality then would I cry out with Coreggio  I too am a Painter  Then should creolian Bd like himself  Start from the Canvas in his Native Hues  The bronze tartarean and Jamaica Tint  Sunburnt and deep enamell'd  Then should he stand in Oratorial Attitude haranguing  loud  His and his Friend's fifteen Aldermen their hundred commoncouncil  BUT to my task adventurous  Casta O Lucina fave Diva producas sobolem and give the springing birth to light  A LETTER from a Right Honourable Person to in the City faithfully  done  into Verse  c  DEAR SIR  Finding with Surprise  Original  Voyant a mon grand etonnement  says the Hague Gazette How does a Dutch or a French man dare to translate the Writings of our British Minister Can they have any Conception of his sublime Ideas He has expressed by the Word  surprise  the gentlest emotion of the human Heart while that of  etonnement  implies not only a turbulence of Passion but a Disorder of the Understanding unworthy of the right honourable Person  Nil admirari  is the motto of a great Man  MONITOR  Having found with Surprise that my late  Resignation  Why Resignation I hate the Word No it was an envious malignant Faction at a certain Board that forced from his Majesty's Conucils the only Person capable of directing them that compelled him to quit the Service of the Publick His Advice was rejected The Plans he had formed and the Measures he had calculated for the Good of the Nation were opposed After all his Labours of  Fidelity  and  Success  a Peace dishonourable  no doubt  and disadvantageous was to be concluded He therefore prudently quitted an Employment where he could not continue with Honour and where neither his Abilities nor his Integrity could be any longer serviceable to his Country  VOX POPULI  Resignation  Both in Manner and Cause by  Is grossly misrepresented c  Original  sont deguis√©s a la ville  Hague Gazette What a cold Expression of that animated Indignation which fires the Original  Grossly misrepresented  In these two Words he proves his Integrity justifies his Conduct and vindicates the Consciousness of his own Worth What Ideas are these What Power of Language No wonder that the French Tongue should sink under such imagery when the French Monarchy has already sunk under his Abilities and the Weight of his Administration  MONITOR  Misrepresentation  Hath been grossly abus'd that his Majesty's Grace  Which follow'd  Spontaneous  That the King's Bounty was uncontrouled uninfluenced and freely flowing from the munificence of his own Nature no Man ever doubted none ever denied Such we apprehend is the Meaning of the Word  spontaneous  To say that this Bounty was  unmerited  is indeed a Compliment justly paid to his Majesty's Generosity though paid perhaps not without some Reproach to his Discernment That it was  unsolicited  is urged rather too incautiously and may hereafter admit of a Dispute Happy for the right honourable Person had he rested his Defence in this Article of it upon the natural Goodness of his Prince A grateful People would have unanimously acknowledged the Justice of his Plea  ALL THE COMMENTATORS IN ALL THE LANGUAGES OF EUROPE  spontaneous  my quitting my Place  Hath been slander'd most basely and vilely perverted  To a  Traduced as a Bargain  Yes an infamous betraying Bargain Princes however bounteous and munificent however naturally inclined to Acts of Grace and Favour are not apt to reward the Person who refuses to serve them and with some very disobliging Circumstances refuses There must therefore such is the strong Conclusion have been some secret Merit in this otherwise unaccountable Resignation and more than Royal Bounty in this Grant of Pensions and Honours  THE TEST  Bargain for having the Publick deserted  The Truth of these Facts I am forc'd to proclaim  And the Manner  In the Original  in a manner which I am sure no Gentleman will contradict  How greatly has the English Language as well as the English Nation been obliged to the Writer of this Epistle How many new Words or new Meanings for old ones how many new Modes of Expression has he introduced into it How is it possible therefore to mention either him or them without a Note of Admiration  WITH regard to the Instance before us to  contradict  the Assertion of an Opinion a Fact a Truth or Falshood by asserting the contrary is the constant Meaning and Usage of the word This  contradicting  the manner is totally new to our Language The French Translator no wonder hath wholly lost the elegant jargon of the original expression and ideas when he renders it  a' une maniere qui ne repugne nullement a la probite A manner by no means repugnant to probity  Our English translator too has lost the spirit of the sentiment by coldly endeavouring to make it intelligible  The manner no gentleman surely will blame  CRITICAL REVIEW  And the Manner no Gentleman surely will blame  That I and the Council  I will not interrupt my Reader's good Humour or damp my own Spirit of Poetry or lose the Pleasure of contemplating admiring and criticising these excellent Epistles by entering at present into a grave Inquiry into the Honourable Gentleman's Reasons for resigning If any of my readers however are impatient to see this Affair set in its true Light and considered in all its Circumstances with that Attention it certainly deserves they may find at the latter end of this Work their Curiosity sufficiently gratified  THE TRANSLATOR  That I and the Council were of different Opinions  Of Importance to Britain her Crown and Dominions  Regarding the Measures we should take against Spain  Yet pray my dear Sir understand what I mean  Not founded on what she may now be designing  But what she has done was my cause for resigning  LORD TEMPLE Le Lord Temple says the Gazettebut why not in capital Letters What an Indignity to the noble Lord Correct it therefore all ye Readers of Delicacy and Taste according to the Honour with which the Great man honours his Lordship and read with the Original LORD TEMPLE moi avons soumis  tres humblement  au Roi nos sentimens sign√©s  de notre main  What a Parcel of Blunders are here To controul his Majesty's Prerogative to take from Him his private Right of judging to govern his Council and to  guide  his Measures these were indeed their  most humble Sentiments  but where did this Translator find their  tres humblement  their Humility of submitting these Sentiments to THE BEST OF SOVEREIGNS Then the  sign√©s de notre main  what a miserable Translation of that Hardiness of Expression superior to the formal Rules of Grammar  We submitted in Writing and signed by us  But all the Men of Learning among the French are now studying our Language and will hereafter be sensible of the untranslatable Beauties of this divine Epistle  CRITICAL REVIEW  AH Poor Lord Temple When according to a facetious Friend of mine he had opened the Sentence in so CAPITAL a Manner he ought surely to have held his Dignity to the End of it If I remember rightly his Lordship too has resigned Was there then no  secret  Merit in his Resignation that might entitle Him to the  Honour  of a Pension or was he introduced here insignificanly as into the Cabinet  tantum ut exiret  THE TEST  LORD TEMPLE and I submitted in writing  And sign'd by us both our Project for fighting  But as the whole Council against us combin'd  On the fifth of this instant the Seals I resign'd  That I might not hereafter for measures be try'd  Which I was no longer  c We have in this Passage an incontestable Proof of the Precipitation with which this Letter was given to the Publick a remainder perhaps of that Spirit which hurried the Gentleman to resign In the last Sentence  a Difference of Opinion was the Cause of my resigning the Seals  but here  I resigned the Sealsin Order not to remain responsible  c  We do not mention these Mistakes in any Suspicion of the Right Honourable Person's Veracity He hath given the World a most convincing Proof of his Zeal for  the Honour of Truth  by divulging those Secrets which he was engaged never to reveal without his My's Permission  IMPARTIAL  Which I was not allow'd any longer to guide  Most gracious the Marks of the King's Approbation  Followed my Resignation  How pitiable is it to see a great Man in the Distress of endeavouring to vindicate his Reputation by nice and subtle Distinctions or palliating an infamous  Bargain  with trivial Circumstances of to day and to morrow  HUMANITY  What does this impertinent Critick mean by his  pitiable  a Term that implies more of Contempt than Compassion Is this the Tenderness to  human Frailty  for which he assumes the Title of HUMANITY But to whom is the Gentleman supposed to make these subtle these palliating Distinctions To whom is he responsible for having  graciously  and  gratefully  accepted these Honours and Pensions the  spontaneous  marks of his Mty's Bounty Certainly not to the People It were an Indignity to Virtue a betraying her sacred Interests for Horace hath long since determined that Virtue  Nec sumit nec ponit secures  Arbitrio popularis aurae  With regard to his Pension why should it be expected that this Gentleman should make himself the single romantick Instance of being virtuous for nothing  Quis enim virtutem amplectitur ipsam Praemia si tollas  Did not Sir Ts Rn and L  d  H and c resign for their Pensions Or look upon the List of Irish Patriots and Pensioners then tell me Critick whether Pensions can be infamous  CLASSICKS AND HISTORY  The Gentleman hath lately given us another Distinction that he did not resign because he was not allowed to guide but because he would not be responsible for Measures which he was no longer allowed to guide This Distinction I confess is too subtle for my Understanding  SIMPLICITY  That follow'd not went before my Resignation  No Merit I boasted no Pension I crav'd  Yet with Pride from the best of all Sovereigns receiv'd  FOR the Honour of Truth I these Matters explain  Nor any Man's Confidence wish to regain  Who with a Credulity weak as unjust  Can suspect one of basely betraying his Trust  Who long serv'd his Country with Zeal and success  And rais'd her to glory c  This Line it is acknowledged is not in the Original It is given to the Gentleman's singular Modesty in speaking of Himself  TRANSLATOR  And rais'd her to glory from Shame and Distress  Who justly the candid and upright reveres  But the base and capricious nor values nor fears  I beg my dear Sir my best Thanks you'll receive  For all your  Kind Friendship  How amiable are these acknowledgments in a great Man In general if Ingratitude be all the vices  ingratum si dixeris  then certainly Gratitude is all the Virtues But what Obligations what proofs of this  kind Friendship  could our great Man have received from the Gentleman to whom this Letter is supposed to have been written except the following Specimen of his Genius for Panegyrick may be deemed an Obligation It has not yet been given to the Publick but whoever is the least acquainted with him will acknowledge it to be genuine Indeed his Manner his Language and his Elocution are all equally inimitable It is only necessary to inform my Readers that the Speech from which this little Extract is taken was pronounced upon the Motion made by the Minister for erecting a Monument to the Memory of General Wolfe  SIR  I have listened to every Word that  has fell  from my honourable Friend and I  rise up  to second his motion It were Presumption in me or in any Man to attempt to add any thing to what he has said on this melancholy Occasion But while I feel for the General I also feel for the Minister who called him forth to this Expedition Here  was  no Parliamentary Interests no family Connexions no aristocratical Views No nothing of  that there  Kind Wolfe was made for the Statesman and the Statesman was made for Wolfe There were many Circumstances similar between them Wolfe had Gentleness and Modesty so had the Minister Wolfe lost his Life and the Minister has hazarded his Head for his Country I had not the Honour of being acquainted with General Wolfe but I never saw any Man look more like a Soldier He was a Soldier and a Soldier's FriendI confess Sir I am much embarrassedand yetI am not usually much embarrassed  Here the assembly as sorry as they were burst out a laughing  kind Friendship  and always believe  That I am c c c  END of the first LETTER  The following Letter was generously communicated to us by the Writer himself  DEAR SIR  The City of London  What an Opening is here The  vastoque immanis hiatu  is nothing to it How alarming How full of Expectation Criticks may tell us of the modest Opening befitting an Epick Poem but if Aristotle were to rise from the Dead and give us Rules for epistolary Writing he would take from this Example the pathetick animating Spirit of beginning all future Letters THE CITY OF LONDON that is the Capital of the World the Mistress of Commerce the Centre of Trade whose Shopkeepers are Politicians whose Aldermen are Instructors to their Representatives in Parliament and whose CommonCouncil Men areit is impossible to say what they are What Ideas are these What Images  ALL THE COMMENTATORS  passim universaliter  What a Parcel of ignorant Blockheads are all the Commentators past present and to come with their  passim universaliter  which for aught I know may be better than our City Latin Not to know that the City of London  are  only fifteen Aldermen and ninety CommonCouncilMen Yet these Fellows call themselves Criticks forsooth and Commentators  SIR JAMES HODGES  What My old Friend Sir James again got into Print and presenting us  with the Key of Knowledge  Yet his Knighthood might have remembered that six thousand Persons in London vote for Members of Parliament and that  his  City who  send their  Instructions to those Members  are  very little more than one poor paltry hundred What then The Secretary acknowledges their Authority and bows himself to their Title In one unstopped Period of an hundred and eighty Words brave Words indeed magnanimous and sounding he requests Sir James  to express his high Sense of the signal Honour  then  their condescending and favourable Resolution  then once again the  Honour which he receives with true Reverence and Gratitude not without Confusion at his own small Deservings  Was there ever such a Farce  THE TEST  THE City of London must for ever forget  Or always remember They are much in Your Debt  And that  You accepted the Seals  What Condescension He suffered himself to be prevailed on to accept As a further Proof of his Modesty he informed the late King when he  accepted  the Seals that he had never turned his Thoughts to consider the Nature of that Office or had ever read any Treatise upon the Subject Yet even then he was determined not to accept of any other Employment  ANECDOTE  You accepted the Seals when the Nation  Never was Country reduced c  The Writer here brings to our Remembrance the inglorious State of our Affairs when the honourable Person accepted the Seals He fills the Scene with every gloomy melancholy Circumstance that he may afterwards present us with a more chearful Prospect of our Situation when the Gentleman resigned Thus an able Painter deepens and darkens the Ground of his Pictures to give a greater Warmth to his Colouring and a bolder Relief to his Figures  TASTE  These may possibly be Remarks of Taste with regard to painting but the LetterWriter might well have been forgiven if he had a little less wantonly indulged himself in the Pleasure of describing the Calamities of his Country Who does not honour his Friend's Abilities and acknowledge his good Fortune Yet surely it was by no means necessary to the Vindication of his Integrity or Wisdom in resigning to set him in Opposition to the noble Duke who had the Conduct of our Affairs at that Time of national Disgrace and Distress Let it however be remembered that our Patriot covered his Grace from the publick Resentment by a mock Inquiry and then joined with him in Administration  HISTORICAL REGISTER  Sure never was Country in such Tribulation  That our Armies were beaten our Navy was laid  Inactive in Port and expos'd was our Trade  That our Credit was bankrupt with all Correspondents  Abroad was Contempt  After this just and animated Description I do declare I verily believe that my Brother who alone raised the Nation from this Distress is not only the greatest but the only Man in the Kingdom that in himself he is King Lords Commons and Cabinetcouncil that he is the Sailor's Intrepidity the Soldier's Courage and all the Money in the Treasury that he was Wolfe's happy Temerity Amherst's Conduct and Prince Ferdinand's good Fortune especially at the Battle of Minden that he was Anson's Knowledge Hawke's Resolution and Keppel's Ardour that he withdrew his Spirit from Lord George and from that Moment his Lordship sunk into a Cd All this and more I firmly believe  LORD TEMPLE's CREED  Must we not conclude from his Lordship's Declaration of his political Faith so solemnly pronounced that Mr Secretary had by the Power of his Office created the thirty thousand Troops he sent to Germany and coined his twenty annual Millions for continental Armies Subsidies and Expeditions How could a Nation  reduced to a State of Bankruptcy  raise these Millions how could  our beaten Armies  reassume the Courage of Britons Impossible One Miracle more we must acknowledge he has performed He has made his noble Brother equally an Orator in the House and a Politician in the Cabinet  CREDULITY  The Stocks the great Measure of publick Credit were twenty per cent higher when the honourable Person accepted the Seals than when he resigned them  MATTER OF FACT  Abroad was Contempt and at home was Despondence  The City must also remember for ever  That when you resign'd our Affairs were quite clever  Our Armies triumphant our Navies victorious  And our Trade in a State which it ne'er knew before us  Our Credit restor'd and the People more willing  To lend you a Million than borrow a Shilling  Our Foes in Despair at our high Exultation  Amazement and Veneration among all neutral Nations  Who could imagine that all these fine Words  nothing but Exultation at home Confusion and Despair among our Enemies  could end in our being treated by those very Enemies with Insolence and Contempt The French it seems  were reduced so low as to sue for a Peace though their Haughtiness was too great and our Successes too many for any Terms to be agreed on  Who can explain this Jargon Impossible Such reasoning has something too absurd for Laughter too perplexed to be explained Whence is it that two Gentlemen who are such excellent Speakers can be such lamentable Writers Why did they not employ some of the critical Reviewers why did they wholly rely upon their City Scribe Sir James Even the Monitor could have expressed something like a Meaning for them But what shall be said of the Minister whose  Fidelity and Success  have rendered his Country thus contemptibly glorious and thus impotently successful  COMMON SENSE  And the Neutrals amaz'd in profound Veneration  That the French were reduc'd to so low a Condition  As to sue for a Peace and we heard their Petition  But they were too haughty and we were too great  Our successes too many to know how to treat  But if Knaves have taught Fools  The old Division of Mankind in Matters of Religion Politicks Morals Genius Arts and Sciences All who are of our Opinion are wise and honest all who are of a contrary Opinion are Knaves and Fools  UNIVERSAL  But if Knaves have taught Fools to call your Resignation  Betraying your Trust and deserting your Station  When you are prevented alas from pursuing  The Measures that still might preserve us from Ruin  If they in the Light of a Pension regard  A Reward that scarce merits c A foolish Figure  in the Language of Polonius a rhetorical Antithesis for which both the honourable and right honourable Gentlemen are equally distinguished Yet this Reward that so it seems to this Alderman's Generosity  scarce deserves the Name of Reward  may possibly cost the Nation an hundred thousand Pounds A Nation almost exhausted by the profusion and Projects of this very Minister  CRITICISM AND HISTORY  This Reward I do assert was as inconsiderable with regard to his Fortune as it was unequal to his Merit This paltry three thousand a Year was not sufficient to maintain a set of Horses They must have cost him three hundred He was therefore forced to advertise THE RIGHT HONOURABLE M  r  PITT's SETT OF HORSES TO BE SOLD  THE MONITOR  What our Patriot Minister at last takes a Reward for serving his Country Surely the very Name of Patriotism will become a Term of Mockery and Ridicule Yet I remember when the late Mr Pulteney after being the Patriot of a twenty year's Opposition was buried in Infamy and an Earldom another Haranguer for Liberty arose and was believed A People who can lightly give away their Confidence to these Talkers will never want such Patriots  DAILY JOURNAL  A Reward that scarce merits the Name of Reward  Yet the City of London from one End to t'other  Hope ne'er to be rank'd among one or the other  They are sensible all for the Good of the Realm  That You still are on Board tho' you've quitted the Helm  And will always be ready  Pensioner as you are  Says the Original a Liberty of Expression which the Translator dares not venture Yet however always vehement and sometimes eloquent against Pensioners the right honourable Person was never in his Heart an Enemy to Pensions Witness a Letter still in Being to a noble Duke and dated some five years ago soliciting his Grace's Interest with his late Majesty for a Pension  SECRET HISTORY  And Peerage  Why was this most honourable Part of the Reward forgotten by the Writer of this Letter Yet with regard to this Barony of Chatham which is to descend to his Posterity what a noble Disregard hath he shewn for the Pride and Vanity of Titles by giving them to his Lady and Son Gewgaws fit for Women and Children while he himself continues a Commoner and one of the People while he holds his Seat among their Representatives  TRANSLATOR  spite of Pensions and Peerage  Over Rocks and through Quicksands to manage the Steerage  To warn him and the Crew  The Commons of Great Britain by their Representatives in Parliament assembled are the Crew supposed to be on board this ancient Type of the Commonwealth But what  Part  will our Minister  act  on board this imaginary Vessel Will he who has resigned his Employment from motives of Honour and Conscience will he sit down in silent Approbation of publick Measures or will he with his own dictatorial Spirit oppose in Parliament what he disapproved in Council Can Honour and Conscience can Patriotism and the Arguments of Reason lose their eternal Nature by the trivial Alterations of Place or Employment But I fear I am asking Questions which his Passions do not at present allow him and which his judgement never will be able to answer  ANONYMOUS  The Crew to advise and the Pilot to guide  Till safe in her Port the good Vessel shall ride  These Sir are the Sentiments zealous and fervent  I believe of the City  Let the Reader acknowledge and admire our Alderman's Integrity Through the whole long Length of his Letter he has positively affirmed that these are the Sentiments of the City But here upon better Recollection he modestly confesses that he only  believes  CANDID  Difficult as it was and arduous my Task is finished Let me then congratulate my Readers and myself that we shall part in the same good humour with which we met The right honourable Gentleman and his Citizen may perhaps bring us together again by generously obliging the Publick with their future Correspondance Neither do I despair of once more hearing our Patriot Commoner exerting his Eloquence against continental Measures and once more declaring  "Not a man not a single Guinea shall ever be sent to Germany"  His Friends already assure us that he holds himself uninfluenced by any Obligations Honours or Pensions and that whenever the Distress or Danger of his Country demands his Assistance he will stand forth in her Defence A motley Kind of Eloquence indeed between the servile Compliances of a pensioned Courtier and the patriot Spirit of a Tribune of the People  THE TRANSLATOR  I believe of the City I am sure of your Servant and most obedient c  END of the Second LETTER  General REFLECTIONS upon these Letters  NEITHER in the Petulance of attempting to be a Wit nor for the  poor Renown of being smart  nor yet to vindicate as may possibly be suspected my Reason by my Risibility did I assume the Tone and Air of Pleasantry The right honourable Person has made his Appeal to the Publick and every Individual of that Publick is authorised to deliver his Sentiments upon it in his own Manner according to the Measure of his Knowledge his Abilities and Understanding For my Part I was determined to try the Gentleman's Conduct by every Kind of Proof even by that of Ridicule If he sinks under this Proof which is generally allowed to be no mean Test of Truth his Resignation is blameable and then it is of little Importance by what Forms of Trial he stands condemned If he can stand this Process he will come forth from it like Gold from the Furnace brighter and purer and certainly not injured in his Weight  SOME Expressions in these Papers may possibly be taxed with too much Levity and others charged with too much Severity yet when in the first of these Letters whoever  withdraws his good Opinion  from the right honourable Person is represented as  capricious  and  ungenerous  and rated for  a Credulity weak as injurious  I presume the Gentleman means unjust when in the second Letter all who differ from the Writer's Sentiments are frankly called Fools and Knaves surely such Coarseness of Expression will justify all Kinds of Language in return  I DO not make any overearnest Professions of my own Impartiality I do not think myself exempted from that common Lot of all human  Understandings the being placed between Reason and Passion between Prejudice and Impartiality I greatly fear that our Friends are not always impartial I truly believe that our Enemies are not always malignant  I CONFESS I did not imagine this extraordinary Resignation was an Object of such present Importance or probably productive of such future Consequences either good or evil as to require any mighty Solemnity in the Manner of treating it and perhaps the following Reflexions may convince my Readers it was not for want of many a serious Argument that I have chosen those of Raillery and Ridicule But here let me be permitted to lay before the Publick some Circumstances concerning it of which they have not yet been informed and upon which they may with absolute Certainty rely  WHEN the right honourable Gentleman entered into Ministry he found every thing yielding to his Ambition The late King whose Love for his native Country may justly be numbered among his Virtues must have certainly been highly satisfied with a Minister who so largely gratified his favourite Passion who poured forth the Blood and Treasures of Great Britain into Hanover with a Profusion which no other Minister durst have ventured or must have ventured at the Hazard of his Head Such were the effects of that Influence which he had gained over the People by repeated Professions of his Zeal for their Service as if their Interests were not united with those of the other great Members of the State or as if they could even in Idea be separated from those of the Sovereign His Majesty's Servants in council silently acquiesced nor would I willingly impute it to  them as a Crime in this continental Prodigality Every part of Administration concurred in a Compliance with his Directions I am ashamed to say in an implicite Obedience to his Commands Fleets were equipped Regiments were raised Expeditions appointed and the Treasury gave forth its Millions to his Order  THUS did he exercise a Kind of Despotism unknown to the Constitution and destructive of every Idea of Liberty until he was opposed for the first Time even by his own Account opposed in a Measure too precipitate too important and too unjust to be complied with either by his Majesty or his Servants He proposed an immediate Declaration of War against Spain at a Time when she was giving us every Assurance of her Inclination to preserve the Peace and Amity subsisting between the two Nations and which it is their mutual Interest to preserve  IT is hardly conceivable that he could either desire or expect to succeed in such an extravagant Proposal What to declare War and commence Hostilities against a friendly Nation without asking a Satisfaction for any supposed Insults a Redress of Injuries or even an Explanation of Grievances The Laws of Nature and Nations the Obligations of Treaties the common Sense of Equity and Reason equally disclaim a Proceeding as unjust as precipitate  BUT what have the Spaniards  already done  to provoke the Gentleman's Indignation and justify his Resentment He neither urged any particular Instance of their Partiality to the French nor any new Violations of our longcontested Rights to cutting Logwood nor even their Injustice with regard to the Antigallican and her Prize which besides some other Indignities he temperately endured through the  whole Course of his administration But so it seems the Fulness of Time for his resigning was not yet arrived he was not yet tired of  guiding  and governing But when he had taken a nearer View of the Port to which the Vessel was driving with all the Sails he had crowded upon her when he saw the Rocks and Shallows and Breakers that threatened his Entrance into the Harbour when he saw the Coast covered with the shipwrecked Reputations of former Ministers he prudently quitted the Helm and retired a simple Passenger to his Cabin  BUT really what had Spain  already done  She had written to France to desire her good Offices with Great Britain that when her Minister was forming the general Articles of Peace he might likewise pay some Attention to certain Matters of mutual Complaint between us and the Spaniards which might possibly occasion some future Rupture between the two Kingdoms and disturb the Tranquility of Europe What is there either so injurious or offensive in this Proceeding that could have justified the Nation in declaring War or could particularly justify the Minister who had borne with rather a too passive Spirit some real Indignities from the Spaniards some real Injustice  MR BUSSY probably exceeded his Commission or executed it with Insolence or if this Letter could reasonably give Umbrage to us why not call for an Explanation of it Why not demand a Copy of it and if denied  "No the Spaniards will certainly declare War against us Let us prevent them"  When it was urged that they would think twice before they declared War against this Kingdom  "I will not give them Leave to think"  was the spirited Answer of our Minister  "This is the Time let us crush the  whole House of Bourbon But if the Members of this Board are of another Opinion this is the last Time I shall ever mix in its Councils I was called into Ministry by the Voice of the People and to them I hold myself answerable for my Conduct I am to thank the Ministers of the  late  King for their Support I have served my Country with Success but I will not be responsible for the Conduct of the War any longer than while I have the Direction of it"  This last Declaration was by no means equivocal It was a frank and open Demand of an unlimited Authority and unconditional Obedience  THE noble Lord who presided in this Council to whom Years have added the Wisdom of Experience without abating the Vigour and Fire of Youth whose natural and acquired Abilities are unquestionable as great as ever this Gentleman could boast who was himself as bold a Minister as ever directed the Affairs of this Nation made him this temperate Reply  "I find the Gentleman is determined to leave us nor can I say I am sorry for it since he would otherwise have certainly compelled us to leave  Him  But if he be resolved to assume the Right of advising his Majesty and directing the Operations of the War to what purpose are we called to this Council When he talks of being responsible to the People he talks the Language of the House of Commons and forgets that at this Board he is only responsible to the King However though he may possibly have convinced himself of his Infallibility still it remains that we should be equally convinced before we can resign our Understandings to his Direction or join with him in the Measure he proposes"  HE bore the Rebukings of this Answer without making any Reply but he had gone too far though perhaps not without repenting to retreat He therefore resigned the Seals which were received with an Ease and Firmness that he probably very little expected The King with his usual Goodness expressed his Concern for the Loss of so able a Servant and to shew the favourable Sense he entertained of his Services was graciously pleased to make him an Offer of any Rewards in the Power of the Crown to bestow His Majesty then added with regard to the Measure proposed that he would certainly have found Himself under the greatest Difficulty how to have acted even though the whole Council had concurred in supporting it A Sentiment of infinite Honour to him who uttered it not only as it asserts a royal Prerogative which for the Good of his People He should ever preserve but as it vindicates those nobler Prerogatives of his Reason his Understanding and his Conscience But these Prerogatives in all Probability the right honourable Gentlem√†n never thought of However this Condescension with which he was treated affected him strongly  "I confess Sir I had but too much Reason to expect your Majesty Displeasure I did not come prepared for this exceeding Goodness Pardon me Sirit overpowers it oppresses me"  He burst into Tears  HIS Lady's Title and his own Pension were settled next Day between Lord Bute and Him when certainly the Title and probably the Sum of the Pension was of his own  free  Choice His Friends at first warmly disclaimed the Insinuation of his taking a Pension They called it a base and momentary Artifice to blast his Reputation They disdained his receiving any Honours from a Master whom he no longer thought proper to serve "What Title" thus  they exclaimed  "can be half so honourable as being styled the Patriot Minister the Minister of the People What Honour can descend to his Posterity equal to the historical Truth that he has saved his Country from Ruin and Reproach that he has raised her to Glory and Happiness"  But since it is no longer an Insinuation that he has received his Pension since his accepting a Title for his Lady can be no longer an  Artifice of his Enemies  his Friends endeavour to defend his  blasted  Reputation  THE best attempt for this Purpose yet offered to the publick is in a Pamphlet entitled  The Conduct of a right honourable Gentleman justified by Facts and upon the Principles of the British Constitution  It is written with Temper and has a Degree of Knowledge though certainly not that of the British Constitution rarely found among us Pamphleteers His first Proposition is  that  Mr Pitt  could not consistently with his own Safety continue in the high Post he held after being forced to deviate from the great Lines of conduct he had chalked out when he first entered upon it  In page he tells us  thus I think I have fully demonstrated my first Proposition  As he has not thought proper to inform us what these  great Lines of Conduct  are perhaps not much straighter than Hogarth's Line of Beauty from whence the right honourable Person  was forced to deviate  nor told us why or by whom he was thus forced we cannot be quite convinced that he has demonstrated his first Proposition But how demonstrated By a tedious Detail of Injuries committed against us by Spain a Detail of uncertain unauthenticated Facts Let me not seem to suspect the Writer's own Belief of these Facts but granting them true granting that Mr Pitt was convinced of their Truth yet it never can be demonstrated either from their Truth or  his Conviction that his Resignation was necessary to his Safety The Rectitude or Error of his conduct in this Instance arises from the Reason which he himself hath given for it that he was  no longer allowed to guide  THE great Chillingworth repeatedly cries out the Bible the Bible is the Religion of Protestants Thus would I repeat the Law the Law is the British Constitution Where therefore is the Law by which Mr Pitt's Safety could have been affected if he had continued in Office after the Measure he proposed of declaring War against Spain was rejected  "But evil Councellors are liable by the Law to punishment"  True and may they ever be liable Yet the Minister who does not give any Counsel who enters his Protest against the Counsel given by others shall be liable to Punishment as an evil Counsellor If for the sake of preserving that unanimity so necessary at this dangerous Crisis of our Affairs if in a modest Diffidence of his own Judgment or a less outrageous Contempt for that of others Mr Pitt had silently complied with the united Opinions of His Majesty and all the Members of the Cabinet could such Compliance ever be imputed to him as a Crime could it endanger his Safety If there be any Law that declares the Guilt of such Compliance or threatens his Safety for it let it be produced or let it never be urged hereafter even by his Fears whether they be real or affected  OUR Writer so learned in the  Principles and Maxims of the British Constitution  is candid enough to acknowledge Pag  that neither the Constitution nor Laws of this Country define the post or power of a Minister of State or even suppose that any such can exist  True  indeed The Constitution disclaims abhors and dreads even the Idea of such a Minister Yet strange proof how a bad cause can pervert a good Understanding The very Gentleman who makes this candid Concession founds Mr Pitt's Defence upon his being not only a Minister but  a first a directing  Minister Terms as new as unknown to the Constitution as that of  guiding  and as heartily to be detested  IT is the peculiar Excellence of this Constitution that the Powers of Government are divided among the three Estates of which it is composed Should any one of these Estates become possessed of more than its proper share of Power the Constitution with all its Blessings of Religion Liberty and Property is instantly dissolved The King becomes a Tyrant the House of Lords an Aristocracy and the People a Democracy Shall one Man therefore a simple Citizen dare to assume to himself all the different Powers of Government Shall he presume to make War and Peace Shall he raise Armies fit out Fleets plan Expeditions and lavish away the publick Treasure under this newinvented Title  a guiding  Minister The very Claim of such a Power is an insolent Outrage to the Laws the Constitution the Liberty of our Country and this Right Honourable Person is the first that ever made this outrageous Claim If any one Man were capable of executing such a Power yet never should it be intrusted I speak with all possible Reverence and Respect no not for a Moment to any one Man even to THE BEST OF SOVEREIGNS  IF among the great Lines of this Gentleman's Conduct he determined never to join in any Measure which he was not  allowed to guide  or in somewhat modester Language if he resolved to resign  whenever he was unable to convince the other Members of the Council of the Wisdom the Justice or Utility of the Measures he proposed permit me to ask what must be the Consequence if every other Member and his equal Right I presume will not be denied should take the same Resolution In vain will his Majesty call together a Number of his Servants for their Advice in Matters of Doubt and Importance if each of them in his Turn may withdraw himself from his Duty to his Country for I presume such a Duty will be acknowledged whenever his Opinion is contradicted  BUT it seems the right honourable Person is not disabled by his Resignation  from offering his opinion to his Majesty his Parliament and his Council with as much Freedom and with more weight than he could have had had he retained the Seals of his Office  In what manner he will exert his Abilities or shew forth his Zeal for his Country and his inviolable Attachment to the Interests of the People he probably has not yet determined Perhaps he will endeavour to convince the House of Commons that he is endowed with some peculiar Spirit some certain superior Instinct fitted for planning and executing all the great Measures of Government But I truly hold it of little Importance to the State of the Nation whether he sits in the silence of his Pension or rises in the Spleen of disappointed Ambition a futile Declaimer against the Measures of Government  FINIS
