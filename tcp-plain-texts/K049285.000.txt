lashing for his life    Not  Cpe  fly swifter    A General famous for an expeditious retreat tho' not quite so deliberate as that of the ten thousand  Greeks  from  Persia  having unfortunately forgot to bring his army along with him  Than I to leave the meagre fiend behind  Fr  Exert your Talents Nature ever kind  Enough for happiness bestows on all  'Tis sloth or pride that finds her gifts too

his own the greatest pens of the age  So well rewards a genius like his own  Grnvle  and  Bth  illustrious need I name  Grnvle  and  Bth c  Two Noblemen famous in their day for nothing more than their fortitude in bearing the scorn and reproach of their country  For sober dignity and spotless fame  Or  Pt  th' unshaken  Abdiel  yet unsung    Or  Pt  th' unshaken  Abdiel c  Abdiel  according to  Milton  was the only seraph that preserved his integrity in the midst of corruption  Among innumerable false unmov'd  Unshaken unseduc'd unterrify'd  Thy candour  Chly  and thy truth O  Ynge  P  Th' advice is good the question only whether  These names and virtues ever dwelt together  But what of that the more's the poet's claim  That can create as well as cherish fame  But one thing morehow loud must I repeat  To gain th'ingag'd attention of the Great  Amus'd perhaps with  C  's prolific bum    Amus'd perhaps with  C  's prolific bum    This alludes to a phaenomenon not more strange than true The person here meant having actually laid upwards of forty eggs as several physicians and fellows of the ryl scity can attest one of whom we hear has undertaken the incubation and will no doubt favour the world with an account of his success Some virtuosi affirm that such productions must be the effect of a certain intercourse of organs not fit to be named  Or rapt amidst the transports of a drum    Transports of a drum    This is a riotous assembly of fashionable people of both sexes at a private house consisting of some hundreds not unaptly stiled a drum from the noise and emptiness of the Entertainment There are also drummajor rout tempest and hurricane differing only in degrees of multitude and uproar as the significant name of each declares  While the grim porter watches ev'ry door  Stern foe to tradesmen poets and the poor  Th' Hesperian dragon not more fierce of old  By ev'ry charm unmov'd but that of gold  Thus at hell gates th' affrighted shade must drop  For ev'ry

Shall I then follow with the venal tribe  And on the threshold the fell mongrel bribe  Bribe him to feast my muteimploring eye  With some proud Lord that smiles a gracious lie  A Lie that captivates my heedless youth  Absorpt at once my talents and my truth  While fool'd with hope revolves my joyless day  And friends and fame and fortune fleet away  'Till scandal indigence and scorn my lot  The dreary jail entombs me where I rot  Is there ye varnish'd ruffians of the state  Not one among the millions whom ye cheat  That while he totters on the brink of woe  Dares ere he fall attempt th' avenging blow  A steady blow his languid soul to feast  And rid his country of one curse at least  Fr  What turn assassin  P  Let th' assassin bleed  My fearless verse shall justify the deed  'Tis he that lures th' unpractis'd mind astray  Then leaves the wretch to misery a prey  Perverts the race of virtue just begun  And stabs the publick in its ruin'd son  Fr  Heav'ns how you rail the man's consum'd by spite  If  Lkmn  's fate attends you when you write  Lkmn  's fate    To be little read and less approv'd  Let prudence more propitious arts inspire  The lower still you crawl you'll climb the higher  Go then with ev'ry supple virtue stor'd  And thrive the favour'd valet of my Lord  Is that denied a boon more humble crave  And minister to him that serves a slave  Be sure you fasten on promotion's scale  Ev'n if you seize some footman by the tail  Th' ascent is easy and the prospect clear  From the smirch'd scullion to th' embroider'd Peer  Th' ambitious drudge preferr'd postilion rides  Advanc'd again the chair benighted guides  Here doom'd if nature strung his sinewy frame  The slave perhaps of some insatiate dame  But if exempted from th'  Herculean  toil  A fairer field awaits him rich with spoil  There shall he shine with ming'ling honours bright  His master's pathic pimp and parasite  Then strut a Captain if his wish be war  And grasp in hope a truncheon and a star  Or if the sweets of peace his soul allure  Bask at his ease in some boon sinecure  His fate in consul clerk or agent vary  Or cross the seas an envoy's secretary  Compos'd of falshood ignorance and

owes his present affluence to the most infamous qualifications  P  Eternal infamy his name surround  Who planted first that vice on  British  ground  A vice that 'spite of sense and nature reigns  And poisons genial love and manhood stains  Pollio  the pride of science and its shame  The muse weeps o'er thee while she brands thy name  Abhorrent views that prostituted groom  Th' indecent grotto and polluted dome  Who starts to find the spurious passion glow  Where not one laurel decks the Caitif's brow  Obscene with crimes avow'd of every dye  Corruption lust oppression perjury  Let  Chrdn  with

white for the entertainment of his guests  The taste of  Maro  and  Anacreon  plead  " Sir  Flaccus  knew to live as well as write  " And kept like me two boys array'd in white  Worthy to feel that appetence of fame  That rivals  Horace  only in his shame  Let  Isis  wail in murmurs as she runs    Let  Isis  wail in murmurs as she runs  c  In allusion to the unnatural Orgies said to be solemnized on the banks of this river particularly at one place where a much greater sanctity of morals and taste might be expected  Her tempting fathers and her yielding sons    While dullness screens  c  This is a decent and parental office in which dullness is employed namely to conceal the failings of her children and exactly conformable to that instance of filial piety which we meet with in the son of  Noah  who went backward to cover the nakedness of his father when he lay exposed from the scoffs and insults of a malicious world  While Dullness screens the failings of the church  Nor leaves one sliding Rabbi in the lurch  Such be the fate of  Fntn Shlly Cpe      Such be the fate of  Fntn Shy Cpe  Three courtly Knights great admirers of that taste which the  Greeks  stiled    For swinish bliss the filthy jakes to grope  Far other raptures let the breast contain  Where heavenborn taste and emulation reign  Fr  Shall not a thousand virtues then atone  In thy strict sensure for the breach of one  If  Bubo  keeps a catamite or whore  His bounty feeds the beggar at his door  And tho' no mortal credits  Curio  's word  A score of laquies fatten at his board  To Christian meekness sacrifice thy spleen  And strive thy neighbour's weaknesses to screen  P  Scorn'd be the bard and wither'd all his fame  That wounds a brother weeping o'er his shame  But if an impious wretch with frantic pride  Throws honour truth and decency aside  Th' indignant muse to Virtue's aid shall rise  And fix the brand of infamy on vice  What if arous'd at his imperious call  An hundred footsteps echo thro' his hall  And on high Columns rear'd his lofty dome  Proclaims th' united art of  Greece  and  Rome  What tho' whole Hecatombs his  Crew  regale  And each  Dependant  slumbers o'er his ale  While the remains through Mouths unnumber'd past  Indulge the beggar and the dogs at last  Say friend is it benevolence of soul  Or pomp'ous vanity that prompts the whole  These sons of sloth that by profusion thrive  His pride inveigled from the public hive  And numbers pine in solitary woe  That furnish'd out this phantasie of shew  When silent misery assail'd his eyes  Did e'er his throbbing bosom sympathize  Or his extensive charity pervade  To those that languish in the barren shade  Where oft by want and modesty suppress'd  The bootless talent warms the lonely breast  No petrify'd by dulness and disdain  Beyond the feeling of another's pain  The tear of pity ne'er bedew'd his eye  Nor his lewd bosom felt the social sigh  Fr  Alike to thee his virtue or his vice  If his hand lib'ral owns thy merit's price  P  Sooner in hopeless anguish would I mourn  Than owe my fortune to the man I scorn  What new Resourse  Fr  A thousand yet remain  That bloom with honours or that teem with gain  These artsare they beneathbeyond thy care  Devote thy studies to th' auspicious Fair  Of truth divested let thy tongue supply  The hinted slander and the whisper'd lie  All merit mock all qualities depress  Save those that grace th' excelling patroness  On others' follies trophies to her raise  And heard with joy by defamation praise  To this collect each faculty of face  And ev'ry feat perform of sly grimace  Let the grave sneer sarcastic speak thee shrewd  The smutty joke ridiculously lewd  And the loud laugh thro' all its changes rung  Applaud th' abortive sallies of her tongue  Enroll'd a member in the sacred list  Soon shalt thou sharp in company at whist  Her midnight rites and revels regulate    Her midnight rites  c  These are mysteries perform'd like those of the goddess  Bona  by females only consequently it cannot be expected that we should here explain them We have notwithstanding found means to learn some anecdotes concerning them which we shall reserve for another opportunity  Priest of her love and Daemon of her hate  P  But say what recompence for all this waste  Of honour truth attention time and taste  To shine confess'd her Zany and her fool  And fall by what I rose low ridicule  Again shall  Handel  raise his laurel'd brow  Again shall harmony with rapture glow  The spells disolve the combination breaks  And rival Punch no more in terror squeaks  Lo  Rssl  falls a sacrifice to whim    Lo  Rssl  falls  c  The person here meant by the qualifications above described had insinuated himself into the confidence of certain Ladies of Quality who engaged him to set up a puppetshew in opposition to the oratorio's of  Hdl  against whom they were unreasonably prejudiced But the town not seconding the capricious undertaking they deserted their manager whom they had promised to support and let him sink under the expence they had entailed upon him He was accordingly thrown into prison where his disappointment got the better of his reason and he remain'd in all the extasy of despair till at last his generous patronesses after much sollicitation were prevailed upon to collect five pounds on the payment of which he was admitted into Bedlam where he continues still happily bereft of his understanding  And starts amaz'd in  Newgate  from his dream  With trembling hands implores their promis'd aid  And sees their favour like a vision fade  Is this ye faithless  Syrens  this the joy  To which your smiles th' unwary wretch decoy  Naked and shackled on the pavement prone  His mangled flesh devouring from the bone  Rage in his heart distraction in his eye  Behold inhuman Hags your Minion lye  Behold his gay career to ruin run  By you seduc'd abandon'd and undone  Rather in garret pent secure from dun    Rather in garret  c  These are the dreams and fictions of  Grubstreet  with which the good people of this metropolis are daily alarmed and entertained  The town with rapes and murders let me stunn  Or plunge in politics with patriot zeal  And snarl like  Gthrie  for the publick weal    Snarl like  Gthie c  A political writer noted for gall  Than crawl an Insect in a  Beldame  's power  And dread the crush of caprice ev'ry hour  Fr  'Tis wellenjoy that petulance of stile  And like an evious adder lick the file    And like an envious adder lick the file    This alludes to the fable of the viper and file applicable to all the unsuccessful efforts of malice and envy  What 'tho' success will not attend on all  Who bravely dares must sometimes risk a fall  Behold the bounteous board of fortune spread  Each weakness vice and folly yields thee bread  Wouldst thou with prudent condescension strive  On the long settled terms of life to thrive  P  What join the Crew that pilfer one another  Betray my friend and persecute my brother  Turn usurer o'er  cent per cent  to brood  Or quack to feed like fleas on human blood  Fr  Or if thy soul can brook the gilded curse  Some changeling heiress steal    Some changeling heiress steal    Why changelingbecause no woman of common sense can be supposed capable of sacrificing her fortune and reputation to a passion for a common sharper the true character of all fortunehunters  P  Why not a purse  Two things I dread my conscience and the law  Fr  How dread a mumbling bear without a claw    A mumbling bear without a claw    Consequently a very inoffenfive adversary  Nor this nor that is fatal right or wrong  'Till minted by the mercenary tongue  And what is conscience but a fiend of strife  That chills the joys and damps the schemes of life  The wayward child of vanity and fear  The peevish dam of poverty and care  Unnumber'd woes engender in the breast  Of him that entertains th' ungrateful guest  P  Hail sacred pow'r my glory and my guide  Fair source of mental peace what e'er betide  Safe in thy shelter let disaster roll  Eternal hurricanes around my soul  My soul serene amidst the storms shall reign  And smile to see their fury spent in vain  Fr  Too coy to flatter and too proud to serve  Thine be the joyless dignity to starve  P  Nothanks to discord war shall be my friend  And moral rage heroic courage lend  To pierce the gleaming squadron of the foe  And win renown by some distinguish'd blow  Fr  Renown ay dounkennel the whole pack  Of military cowards on thy back  What difference say 'twixt him that bravely stood  And him that sought the bosom of the wood    What difference say 'twixt him that bravely stood    And him that sought the bosom of the wood    This last line relates to the behaviour of a General on a certain occasion who discovered an extreme passion for the cool shade during the heat of the day  Invenom'd calumny the First shall brand  The Last enjoy a ribbon and command  P  If such be life its wretches I deplore  And long to quit th' unhospitable shore  FINIS
