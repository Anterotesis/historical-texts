 MEMOIRS OF Count  TARIFF  c  Omnibus in terris quae sunt à Gadibus usque  Auroram Gangem pauci Dignoscere possunt  Vera bona atque illis multûm diversa remotâ  Erroris Nebulâ  Juv Sat  LONDON  Printed for  John Morphem  near  StationersHall  Price  s  MEMOIRS OF Count TARIFF c  COUNT  Tariff  whose History we are now to write is a Person who has been so much misrepresented among us and painted in such monstrous Shapes that 'tis but a piece of Justice to a Stranger to rescue his Character from the Mob and to search what may be found in ancient History concerning him  So far as we have search'd into Antiquity we find him lineally descended from the ancient Line of the  Tariffs  a Family of such Quality as well as Antiquity in  France  that they trace their Genealogy as high as any History can be  found and they appear equal in Birth to  Commerce  it self whose Antiquity no Body doubts of  The present Count  Tariff  the chief of his Family is a Person who as well for his proper Merit as his high Birth as aforesaid has been esteemed and respected all over  Europe  and for the great Interest he has in his Country has been sought unto by most of the Nations in  Europe  upon many occasions  He always appear'd to be a Patron of Trade as what he esteem'd was exceedingly conducive to the general Good of Mankind As this was his especial Aim so he did not so much apply himself to this or that particular Branch or part of Trade but endeavour'd upon all occasions to shew himself a Friend to universal Commerce as it respected the Improvement and general Advantage of the World and from this Rule he constantly employ'd the Influence he had on Affairs  which was not small  to the Regulation and good Government of Trade in his own Country  He took on him the general Management of Commerce on the th of  September  which being the first time of his publick Appearance in the World  we shall not enquire into any part of his Conduct before that time  He had no sooner settled and made publick  his Rules  of Commerce but all the Trading part of the World were made sensible of the Advantage they receiv'd thereby and consequently began to entertain a true and very great Opinion of his Worth and very quickly courted his Friendship This Nation especially made great Advantage of his Correspondence for he was a particular Friend to the  English Trade  and encourag'd it upon all Occasions It is true he acted upon open Measures of Correspondence and was a Friend to universal Trade  as above  He abhorr'd Prohibitions Restrictions and Exclusion of Nations in Trade but if he had any Peculiar if he treated any one Nation with Distinction more than another it was  England  which was all the Reason that has yet been assign'd why some People in the Kingdom have treated him with such Rudeness and Disrespect ever since But however they have used him it is most certain  England  felt the sensible Advantage of his Acquaintance and corresponded with him to their great Profit as well as Satisfaction for several Years receiving every Year  great Sums of Money from him and by his means  He was particularly a very great Friend to the  English  Manufacture He always appear'd at Court in a Suit of  English Broad Cloth  and cloth'd all his Servants in the same and tho' his Liveries were plain they were handsomer and richer than any in that Country  It happen'd however after some time Divisions prevailing there as well as in other Courts that he began to be in less Repute with some People than before yet he still went on as well as Circumstances would admit in his own way  viz  of encouraging Trade he receiv'd all the Equipages of his Servants and Furniture of his Houses from  England  Notwithstanding the fine Brocades and rich Silks which are made in  France  he cloathed his Countess and the young Ladies his Daughters and their Attendants in rich  EastIndia  Silks fine Muslins  c  bought in  England  and brought from the  Indies  by the  English EastIndia  Company  Upon building his fine CountrySeat of TARIFFCASTLE in  France  all the fine Locks and Keys and several other parts of the Furniture came from  England  the Roof was cover'd with Lead to distinguish his Respect for the  English  Commerce and all the Vessels and Utensils of his Family which it was proper to have so were of  English  Pewter  This particular Conduct of the Count with respect to the  English  Trade gave some Umbrage in  France  and whether it were by the Artifice of some of his Neighbours who always envy'd and rivall'd the  English  or whether it was meerly the Inclination of the People there to set up Manufactures of their own Authors are not agreed about it but it procured Count  Tariff  many Enemies at home as is before observ'd nay even his own Tenants and Neighbours complain'd that he favour'd Foreigners and foreign Manufactures alledging that his Coaches were lined with  English  CLOTH his Rooms hang'd with  English  STUFFS that all his Servants smoaked TOBACCO and other Circumstances falling in with this at the same time the  Count  was oblig'd to alter his Measures and first declined some part of the  English  Trade by several publick Acts as particularly on the th of  April  the th of  December  and at last he was obliged wholly to renounce it on the th  of  September  Upon these Disturbances Count  Tariff  being necessitated as abovesaid to lay aside all Correspondence with his  English  Friends they on the other hand acted the weakest part that ever was known among Trading Men and Merchants for however he had been their Friend and however absur'd it was on their side to forbid the Exportation of their own Manufactures yet they took that simple Step and without respect to Count  Tariff  or the Injury they did to their own Workmen in the Countries and their Families truly they cut off their own Trade and would not suffer any more BroadCloth or Serges Stuffs Bays Kersies Dozens or any Woollen Manufactures or other Goods to be sent to Count  Tariff  by which piece of Wisdom they lost their Country the Exportation of above Six hundred thousand Pounds a Year in Goods of their own Growth or Manufactures besides those of the Growth and Produce of their Plantations and other Countries  Count  Tariff  being treated thus by his  English  Friends it was not to be wondred if Mynheer  Coopmanschap  an old Carrier and a cunning tricking circumventing  sharping  Dutch  Broker fell in with him This  Coopmanschap  was a great Dealer in the Manufactures and Produce of other Countries but had very few or none at all of his own He drove indeed a great Trade to most parts of the World It was he who made that famous Voyage to  Japan  where when he was asked by the Emperour whether he was a  Christian  or not he answer'd he was a a HOLLANDER He had been all over the  EastIndies  and particularly was Governour at  Amboyna  upon a certain Butcherly occasion which  Authors say  is nothing to the purpose now because it was a great while ago He has driven a great Trade ever since by Interloping into the Trade of other Nations but is especially remarkable for keeping his Word no longer than he finds it for his Gain and then complaining that others DO SO It was not many Years before this that he was in Partnership with a great  German  Merchant one Mynheer  Leopoldus  of  Vienna  in which they had agreed not to lay down their Trade but by mutual Consent and particularly old  Coopmanschap  bound himself not to contract any Partnership without the Consent of  Leopoldus  and without taking him in  but he broke his Word and left old  Leopoldus  in the Lurch before the Voyage was half finish'd which is mention'd for their Service who pretend to say he was injured lately  that may  himself  Count  Tariff  was not ignorant of the Subtilty and Knavery of this Tricking  Dutchman  for he had heard his Character and had dealt with him before but his Circumstances requiring him to settle a Correspondence  some where  and having been ill used where he inclined to settle he found it for his Advantage to engage with  Mynheer  and accordingly Articles of Partnership were sign'd between them on the th of  December    It was no small Surprize to the rest of the Trading Nations of  Europe  that Count  Tariff  had settled with  Mynheer  and tho' it had been better for them all that he had continu'd to Trade with the whole World on equal Terms as before yet when they found that could not be they would all have been glad to have had him exclusively to themselves but old  Coopmanschap  according to Custom was too cunning for them all and knowing the Worth of the  Count  he supplanted all the World and got him to himself  One of the principal Businesses of  Mynheer  after he had secur'd Count  Tariff  to himself was to prevent his Trading with any Body else and fain he would have had the Count have entered into some exclusive Terms with him which at first he could not obtain it being not included in their Articles but it fell in afterwards upon the occasion of some of his old Correspondents prohibiting their Factors to send him any Woollen Manufactures  as aforesaid  No sooner had old  Coopmanschap  and the Count engaged but the  Dutchman  began to insult all Count  Tariff  's old Correspondents and put the Dice upon all that Traded with him before for no Body could Trade with Count  Tariff  at all NOW but they must pay TOLL to old  Coopmanschap  no Goods could be sent to Count  Tariff  but in old  Coopmanschap  's Waggons and Ships so that he became the general  Carryer  to all the Trade of that side of the World and got something by every thing that  other People  dealt in  This made him so Insolent that if any Proposals of Peace or Trade were made to him his Answer was always Count  Tariff  Count  Tariff ick vil hab  Count Tariff  nothing must be done without Count  Tariff  At last  Mynheer  thinking he had effectually secured all the Trade of the World and that he was able to keep every Body else out of it truly he began to use Count  Tariff  himself very scurvily and on several Occasions abused him very grosly insomuch that  the Count  who easily saw himself maltreated grew weary of him He found that this  Coopmanschap  was but a Jobber of other Peoples Trade a meer  Pedlar  a  Waggoner  or  Carrier  for other Merchants that all the Goods he Count  Tariff  bought of him were brought to him at  Second Hand  and that he might much better have them directly from the Makers and Manufacturers and the Countries where they were produced Wherefore he Count  Tariff  resolved at last to put an end to it and accordingly he wrote him a very plain Letter telling him what a cozening old Knave he had been how rich he was grown by means of the Partnership and yet how basely he had treated his Partner▪ and in short told him in so many Words at the end of his Letter that he would have no more to do with him  It is not to be wondred if  Mynheer  was Thunderstruck at this surprizing Letter for by it on a sudden he lost all those Advantages which had for some time raised up both his Purse and his Pride and which had enabled him to hold up his Head and think himself equal with the richest Merchant in  Europe  But from this Disappointment he began to alter his Tone and talk a little humbler than he was wont to do mean time he omitted nothing to recover his former Interest in Count  Tariff  and if possible to retrieve the Partnership and to that purpose he dispatched two of his Factors to go to Count  Tariff  's House and to try if they could by any Offers Submissions and Promises and on any Conditions whatsoever retrieve this Blow that he might preserve his governing Influence on the Trade of  Europe  But after several vain Attempts of this nature  he found  that it was impracticable and that Count  Tariff  was resolved  for his sake  that he would never more engage in a separate Partnership but that he had reassumed his former generous Principle  viz  of  encouraging universal Commerce  a thing that did not suit with Mynheer's Designs at all who always  advanced himself by encroaching on other Mens Trade rather than by carrying on any particular Trade of his own as is evident by his Trade to the  EastIndies  which he rifled a great  Portuguese  Merchant of his  Herring Fishery  which he got by Encroachment on the Scots Merchants and by his Trade to the  Brazils  and  Surinam  which he stole from the  Spaniards  and the like  But Mynheer who never used to give a Game over while he had any Cards left in his hand to play when he found he could not get Count  Tariff  to himself his next Concern was to take care that the Count should not engage with any body else and particularly he was sensible it would be a very great Loss to him if any English Merchants should embark with him It seems he had had some private Intimation that Count  Tariff  was about making a new Partnership with one Mr  Traffick  an eminent Merchant and Alderman of  London  This Mr  Traffick  traded it seems in Company with one  Harry Woolpack  a famous Clothier in the West and together they two manag'd the whole Trade of the Woollen Manufacturers on that side of the World  It was a mortal Blow to Mynheer to think that Count  Tariff  should engage with these People and it put him into a cold Sweat immediately for these were the very Men that he had bubbled for so many Years past for having kept Count  Tariff  under his Thumb he got all the Trade into his own Hand made those English Merchants glad to sell their Woollen Manufactures to him some  finish'd  some  unfinish'd  as he pleased to take them and at  what Price  he pleased to give for them so that they only furnish'd Count  Tariff  at secondhand and old  Coopmanschap  got the Profit  All the while he did thus he wheedled Mr Alderman  Traffick  and  Harry Woolpack  with fine Stories of his being their only Friend of his taking off such vast Quantities of their Manufactures more than other Nations nay sometimes he would say more than all the Nations of the World and that no body could do this but he  whereas the Truth was  that all this while he was only the  Middleman  or Broker between both for Count  Tariff  was really the Man who procured most of the Trade and made the great Consumption of the Woollen Manufactures by encouraging the wearing  thereof as aforesaid among his Tenants and Servants and this subtle Dutchman had only been a Pickpocket on both Sides As soon as Mr  Traffick  and  Harry Wo  lpack  and their other Partners came to understand this it gave them a most contemptible Opinion of old  Coopman schap  and made them reflect with great Regret on those Councils which had led them into such a Noose and caused them to be so dup'd and made Fools of by this old Dutch Man for so many Years to the Ruin of their Trade and the enriching of him and his Hangers on When their Eyes were thus opened and they saw clearly how they had been play'd upon and cozen'd they entertained with great Readiness the Proposals of  a new Partnership  with Count  Tariff  which the Count by his Agents had offered them about that time  Upon this the Treaty of Partnership between Alderman  Traffick  and the Count having gone on with great Sincerity and Application on both sides it was concluded and signed between Arbitrators employed by both Parties on the st of  March  tho' this was not brought to pass without a mighty Opposition of old  C  opmanschap  and his Friends  It was thought at first that the Treaty having been thus finished and all Parties being thus agreed there could not have been any room for a Miscarriage after that and it was not doubted but Messieurs  Traffick and Company  would have driven a gallant Trade the next Year with Count  Tariff  but it proved quite otherwise by the Subtilty and indefatigable Cunning and Diligence of that old Fox  Coopmanschap  the Particulars of whose Intrigues make the next part of our Story  Old  Coopmanschap  having been alarmed as is said already by the Report of a Treaty being set on foot between Count  Tariff  on one hand and the said Mr Alderman  Traffick  of  London  and his Partners in the Country  on the other hand  he found there was no time to be lost for these as aforesaid were the greatest Dealers in the  British  Woollen Manufactures that were in the World and the very same Men who he had bought all the Woollen Goods of which he had supplied Count  Tariff  with during their late Partnership he knew also if the Count sell in with them he should not only be circumvented and become useless in the Trade but that all his Cunning  and Knavery would be exposed on either Hand That first Count  Tariff  would see how he had made him pay thro' the Nose for every thing which he had bought and that he could buy cheaper of Alderman  Traffick  and Company and not only so but the Alderman and his Partners would discover also how when he had beaten down the Price and brought them to sell their Goods so monstrous cheap that their poor Workmen could hardly get Bread by their Labour he sold those Goods at the same time for a great Price to Count  Tariff  and so he had gotten the Profit of all the Trade to himself  He was conscious that when both Sides came thus to see into his Knavery they would equally resent his former Correspondence with them and never have any thing to do with him in that respect again that by this means he should lose his Cullies and be quite stript of the Advantage he had always made by them  Upon this and many other Mischiefs which he foresaw would follow he resolved to go over for  England  and by all means possible endeavour to prevent the Partners making their new Treaty of Partnership EFFECTUAL  He was encouraged to make this Attempt by a secret Correspondence which he always held in that Country with a certain CLUB or Society of Men who having certain private wicked Projects of their own to carry on by his Assistance were declared Enemies to Count  Tariff  for his sake and by consequence would be sure right or wrong to oppose the new Partnership Count  Tariff  was making with their FellowCitizens however it might be to the prejudice of their Country or of themselves Envy and Revenge being the most Selfdenying Vices in the World These People pretended indeed to be very great Friends to Alderman  Traffick  and  Henry Woollpack  his Partner yet they had given several sufficient Testimonies of their being willing to Sacrifice them both for the Interest of old  Coopmanschap  and even to sell them and their Country too into Slavery to him to work in his  Rasphouse  in  Amsterdam  rather than not oblige him to be their Friend in those other Projects which they were carrying on as aforesaid  Having such an Interest there he made the best of his way for  England  and had the good Luck to come there before the Articles of Copartnership which  the Arbitrators on both Sides had made between Count  Tariff  and his new Partners were arrived  As soon as he was come to  London  he gave notice to his trusty Friend Sir  Politick Falshood  who was generally Chairman of that Society that he Purposed to be at the Club the next Day who accordingly intimated the same to the whole Party in order to have a full Assembly  Being come to the Club and having saluted the Members he stood up and made a Speech to them to the following Purpose  Here follows an Account of the Speech which Mynheer VAN COOPMANSCHAP made at his first Appearance in the Club  FIrst He gave them thanks for the great Services they had done him upon all Occasions in time past and the great Obligations which they had laid upon him  for That  not regarding their Country their Liberty their present Advantages or their Posterity they had with a steady and unshaken Zeal always preferred his  Interest  to THEIR OWN  He acknowledged that in a former Partnership wherein they had been engaged with him they never insisted upon his paying in the Proportions of STOCK agreed upon between them But had very kindly carried on  their own Part  and most of  his too  tho' at the same time they were fain to run themselves into heavy Debts  more than ever they were like to have paid  besides several other Inconveniencies to  do  it and also altho' the  greatest part  of the Profit of the Partnership fell to HIS SHARE all which he told them added to the Generosity of their Treatment of him and which therefore obliged him to this grateful Remembrance thereof  He owned and  therewith he made them a Grimace  that they had been very Friendly to him in not examining his Accounts relating to the said Partnership but had passed them upon  his Credit  which he being utterly unable to make a fair Account was very much obliged to them for  He could not forget  he said  how frankly they had furnished the greatest part of the Ships employed in their Partnership even without charging him for his share of the Freight whereby he  had been at leisure to carry on the  NorthSeasTrade  which was quite out of the Partnership at their Expence and which had encouraged him to charge even those Ships also which were employed in the said separate Trade to the  NorthSeas  as if employed in the said Partnership to his unspeakable Advantage for which he said he was infinitely obliged to them  That whereas they had been equally concerned for several Years past in carrying on an Undertaking for the French PHILOSOPHERS STONE which as it had been both hazardous and expensive so it had been owned to be  as such Projects generally are  very unlikely to succeed especially to the height that some proposed he told them he thought himself obliged to confess that they had generously supplied more Workmen for the said Undertaking than they were bound to furnish by their Agreement and yet had not made him pay toward the extraordinary Charge of it It is true▪  said  he you once proposed to me that in Consideration thereof I should break my Partnership with Count  Ta    and have no more to do with him  upon my representing to  you faithfully how much it would be to my Prejudice tho' to your Advantage you were so kind as not to insist upon it which I acknowledge  said he and made them a Dutch Bow  was a great Instance of  Selfdenial  in you and disinterested Friendship to me  But  he told them  he had yet greater things than those to thank them for and particularly that  bold Step  they took on his Account and which few Partners but they would have ventur'd at  viz  That when several of his principal Correspondents in  England  were in danger of being turned out of their Shops and Employments by their LANDLADY the Club had appeared so much interested in their Behalf as to depute some of their RUDEST Members to Her to tell her  very respectfully  that she ought not to do so that she ought to have consulted them in the Management of her Servants and Family that if she ventur'd to do it she would entirely lose their Favour and did not stick to threaten her  tho' she was their own Landlady  too that in such case they would shew their Resentment and would neither give her or her Tenants or her Workmen Credit for one Farthing of  Mony nor suffer any body else to do it nay nor pay her their Rent neither if they could help it which Threatning tho' it did not succeed according to Expectation yet was such an extraordinary Step in his Favour as he could not but think himself very much obliged to them for it  He told them farther that he was particularly obliged to thank them for another Instance of their Zeal for his Interest  viz  that when some British Merchants came over to a Place called  Ʋtrecht  a City in his Country in order to recover a certain Branch of Trade out of his Hands which he had circumvented them of before the Society had endeavoured to expose and ruin those Merchants loudly declaring in all their Societies as well  Grecian  as  English  that it was neither just nor honest to take any thing away from Mynheer  Van Coopmanschap  or to get any thing for Alderman  Traffick  and Company without letting him have an equal Share of it  or in short  to disoblige him in any respect whatsoever So that they justified him highly in the Practice of what every one knew was his Principle  viz  That what every one else got should  be part of it his and what he himself got should be all his own  He thank'd them  he said that in their late famous Voyage or Adventure to  Terra  Gertrudenburg  Incognita  in which they had been also Partners yet the Club had generously left the Management of the whole Voyage to him owning themselves not fit to be trusted in Affairs tho' their own of so nice a nature by which had not his unhappy native Avarice prompted him to grasp the Shadow and let slip the Substance he might have made a very good Voyage for himself at the Expence of all the rest of his Partners but as he had no body to blame for the Miscarriage but himself so he thank'd them for their Goodwill whatever Loss he sustain'd by the Voyage  It was true he said that another Miscarriage of his had been the Effect of their Advice to him  viz  when they perswaded him to adhere to the Executors of old  Leopoldus  and preferr his GermanPartnership to all other Engagements which piece of Council overthrew the whole Voyage for as  on the one hand  he slip'd a good Opportunity and refused an advantageous Offer  of another Partnership which he inclined to embark in and which had he closed with it would have prevented the dismal Events that followed So  on the other hand  he not only was disappointed in all his chimerical Hopes of that Voyage but had all his Vessels plundered his Goods and Merchandizes taken away and most of his Agents and Servants were knock'd on the Head and thrown overboard or carried into Slavery which forced him at last shamefully to quit the said  German Partnership  and to lose all those Advantages that had been offered him at first as aforesaid however he said as he believed the Society did it for the best and had only acted by him as they did for themselves and according to their kown Politicks viz  Never to know when they are well  so he could not blame them in the least  He acknowledged that their general Conduct had been always with an Eye to his Interest and Grandeur which they had given him so many Testimonies of that it was very much to his Satisfiction and which he had so far depended upon as had made him talk in a different Tone from what he used  to do to several of his other Partners for that he knew they were always ready to back him in and approve of all the Measures he took for advancing his own Trade and that they were always willing to sink their own Stocks and throw away their own Estates rather than he should be a Sufferer  He told them also that he thankfully remembred how they had given him timely notice when they designed to ruin the Publick Credit if it had been in their Power that he might have sufficient time to draw out his Mony whereas had their Design succeeded he might without such notice have been a very great Loser  It was true  he said  he had observed that altho' they had informed him that their  Landlady  was a Bankrupt and her Credit broke and perswaded him not to lend her Mony yet as soon as she had offered them a small Advantage in the Loan they all run in privately and lent their own Mony leaving him out But as this was nothing but what he taught them and as he would have done by them if it had been in his Power he was not at all disobliged by it knowing they would make him amends for it many other ways  He told them he was in a particular manner obliged to them in other Affairs of their Partnership especially for drawing up proper Memorials for him upon certain Occasions in which they were so zealou for his Interest and so willing to make him popular that they had frequently ventur'd to Print them before they had been delivered and if at any time his secret Management had been discovered and the People began to entertain a mean Opinion of his Honesty they always had employed their whole Set of Pamphleteers to vindicate him who had covered the foulest of his Actions with the most popular Lyes they could invent of which they were very fruitful and by an infinite number of Abuses Invectives and Libels even against  their Landlady herself  and all her Family and Servants they had diverted the Rage of the People and impos'd upon them in such a manner that his Character which was much in Danger by some Mistakes he had fallen into stood very right again with the People and as he had maintained a kind of Correspondence  from the Teeth outward only  with their  Landlady  which however he  was alwas ready to break off when their Interest should require it he had thereby he hop'd kept himself in a Condition to requite the Favours he had received from them  That for his part he said tho' he should not boast of his Merit yet he hoped he had not been wanting on all Occasions to shew his respect to them and to lay all the Obligations upon them which it was in his Power to do That upon all Occasions he had supported them in their private Designs and Contrivances against their  Landlady  and her Adherents Family and Servants that he had acquiesced in all the Memorials they had drawn up for him and been as well satisfied with them when they were drawn up at the farther End of  Piccadilly  as when they were done at  Amsterdam  which also had saved him a great deal of Trouble and tho' in one of those Memorials they had committed a fatal Mistake in acknowledging the Fact which it was intended to deny  viz  about his having not supplyed the Quota of Ships to the Partnership which he had agreed to furnish yet he was very well satisfied with the Invention they found out to cover it whether it were Truth of Fact or no  He modestly put them in mind of his great Concern for them in another Affair wherein he had made himself Arbitrator for the Succession of their Trade in the next Age and preserving a Partnership which it was agreed should be entered into after a certain Engagement was expired with some Merchants of  Brunswick  which tho' they all knew there was not the least need of that it was in it self nothing at all that Contract being effectually secured by the Circumstances and nature of the thing yet as it was of use to them otherways and served to make the Reputation of the Club swell among some People so he had done it to serve them at the same time taking such effectual Care to preserve their Trade in  Flanders  by securing it all into his own Hands that he hoped it was to their exceeding great Satisfaction He put them in mind how for their sakes he had continued his Partnership with the Executors of old  Leopolaus  Merchant of  Vienna  altho' Count  Tariff  had made him very great Offers to break the same and altho' he had met with very great Losses in carrying it on and altho' one Merchant  Eugene  who was Factor  for the said Partnership had imposed upon him and outstood his Market having been outwitted by Count  Tariff  's Factors and so had spoiled the whole Voyage as he had just now told them  He assured them in the next place that as he had served them with all his  usual  Sincerity in these and many other occasions so he was still ready to assist and stand by them in their private Concerns and to renew the Partnership they had carried on so long and which they had so successfully been engaged in for as many Years as they should think fit that especially he was ready to support them and assist them in any Measures which they should think proper against their Landlady whether to expose ridicule and affront her Person and the Management of her Family and Houshold or to oppose any of her Designs however laudable and useful for the good of her Tenants at which words the Assembly in token of Gratitude and accepting the Offer stood all up and Mynheer making another  Dutch  Bow went on  He told them that he was still very ready to settle Matters of Trade for this part of the World if they would but stick fast to their old Maxims of leaving  it all to him and being willing that his Interest should be secured first and then their own brought in as subservient and finally he profest himself ready to require their Kindness at all times if he might but enjoy the Benefit of their Trade exclusive of themselves  as he had d  ne  He then came to the main Point He told them that he understood there was a private Clandestine Negociation on foot between Merchant  Traffick  of  London  and his Partner  Henry Woolpack  of the  West  for a Partnership with Count  Tariff  of  France  the Articles whereof if they came to be  made Effectual  would be very prejudicial to his Affairs and that therefore he desired their utmost Assistance against is He told them that this Count  Tariff  was always Partner with him and had left him without warning that it would disable him from driving his Trade and consequently from buying so many Woollen Manufactures  as he used to do because Count  Tariff  would take them here himself and in s  rt he told them that if they had any Respect for him or expected any of his Assistance in their other secret Affair  which he had always  been their Friend in they must stand his Friend at this time and prevent the Articles of this Partnership from being MADE EFFECTUAL  Then he fell to railing at Count  Tariff  told them he was a  Frenchman  and a  Papist  and a tricking false Fellow that never kept his word with any Body that he was a Bankrupt and not able to make good what he had promised that he would crowd them with his own Goods such as Wine Brandy Silk Linnen Paper c but would take little or nothing of them in return only give them large Promises and good Words with which he would feed them till the Partnership was settled and made effectual and then he would laugh at them and with much more of this kind he ended his Speech  Mynheer  Coopmanschap  having thus finished his Speech and sat down Sir  Pol  the Chairman seeing the Club in an unusual Agitation and mightily incensed against Count  Tariff  and also against Alderman  Traffick  and his Partners called for a Bottle of  NeatPort  for they always drink  Port  at that Club and beginning a Health  which for their Reputations sake as they pretend to be  Christians  is not fit to be named the unnatural Pleasure of that Infamous practice took them a little off of their Fury Indeed Authors do not say it cooled the Ferment they were in but it turned it another way tho' by a worse Inflamation and having twice Cursed the  Landlady  and five times her Servants Sir  Pol  stood up and addressing himself to  Mynheer  he spoke in the Name of the whole Society by way of Answer to his Speech to the purpose following  'FIrst He told him they were very glad the Endeavours of the Club had been of Service to him that they had faithfully pursued his Interest at all times without respect to any Obligation they were under to the contrary either to their  Landlady  or otherwise and that it was very much to their Satisfaction that he was sensible thereof  They condoled with him  he said  in all his Misfortunes particularly that which he had mentioned to them  viz  of having the  British  Merchants get the better of him in all his projects of Trade especially that with the  Spanish  Merchant D  Philippo  and his Factor Seignior  which he could not but be sensible  they had done their Endeavour to prevent however it might be against the Honour and the Interest of their Country'  'He told him  the Club  was very sorry they had been any way instrumental to the loss of that Voyage of his where his Ships were taken his Goods plundered and his Men thrown overboard or carryed into Slavery but that the Advice they gave him for adhering to his  German Partnership  was chiefly founded on the Assurances which he had sent them word were given him that Merchant  Eugene  who was Factor for Mynheer  Leopoldus  would carry on that Trade successfully without any farther help or any Auxiliary Stock and that they never suspected that those Promises of  Merchant Eugene  had been all but meer Gasconades and that he was not able to perform them for that the said  Eugene  was always esteemed an expert Merchant and one who being bred to Business always  kept right Accounts  and might be depended upon in Adventures of the nicest Nature that therefore the Miscarriage ought to be placed to Merchant  Eugene  's Account and not to theirs who had advised him for the best'  ' He told him the Society were sorry he had been obliged to quit his  German Partnership  in such a manner as he did but they were glad  for his sake  that he had at last put an end to it being afraid his  German  Partner would ruin himself by following the precipitant Measures of his said Factor Merchant  Eugene  especially in carrying on that Trade which was too hazardous and expensive for  his  Strength of Stock and that it was rumoured already upon Change that his Bills had been protested in divers parts of  Europe  so that it was feared we should quickly hear there was a Commission of Bankrupt taken out against him and that he would make a Composition with his Creditors'  'He told him tho' the Society had been disappointed in every thing they had undertaken for him and were at this time but in mean Circumstances their Character declining their Reputation very low and most of their valuable Men gone off from them to the Interest of their  Landlady  having by her Advice joined in a new Partnership with Merchant  Moderation  an old and known Enemy to the whole Society yet as their Spirit  Malice  was not in  the least abated and that they had yet Members enough left to make a great Effort Noise in his Favour so he might depend upon their utmost Assistance in every thing whatsoever that he desired in return whereof they hoped  Mynheer  would continue to be their constant Friend and Correspondent in the same manner as he had done before adding that they had one farther Request to make to him  viz  That whereas they might probably find it needful sometimes in carrying on his Intrigues or their own to make themselves obnoxious to the Law and which was likely to be very frequent to fly from Justice run away from Bail and  such like  he would engage to receive their Criminals and make them Burgesses in his Cities and free Denizens Naturalizing them among the Servants of his Family as would be most suitable to them and to him also whether they were feloniousBankrupts Murtherers of Nobility Duellers Scots Libellers Traytors or what kind of Offenders soever'  'That as to the new Treaty of Partnership with Count  Tariff  he told him there was no doubt but the Club would  espouse his Cause  right  or  wrong  against that  Frenchman  and all his Attempts that the name of  French  would make it exceeding Popular and they would presently spread it over the whole Nation that he was a Pickpocket a Conjurer and dealt with the Devil and they doubted not to have him Mobb'd if he came hither'  'He  told him  that as to Alderman  Traffick  he knew he was an eminent Dealer and understood Trade and perhaps he might be steady as to his old Notions of the Liberty of Trade but as for honest  Woolpack  he knew him well enough that he was a wellmeaning CountryFellow but very Passionate and Ignorant and he did not question but the Club would find means to Impose upon his Judgment by telling him a hundred Stories and Shams of this  Frenchman Count Tariff  and if they did but once make him believe that  Count Tariff  would take off none of his Manufactures he would go stark Mad and break off the new Partnership at once or quarrel with Alderman  Traffick  his Partner and refuse to go on with the Trade concluding upon the whole in the Name of the Society  that he might depend upon it they were all  Mynheers  hearty Friends more than their own'  The Chairman having ended his Speech a Tool of his who sat at his Elbow lately turned Malecontent because he was left out of a certain Commission made a motion to the Club that they should declare their Assent to all that Sir  Pol  had said which was done the following Minute being extracted out of the Journal of the Club  Resolved Nemine Contradicente  That the Thanks of the Club be given to Sir  Pol Falshood  the Chairman for his excellent Speech to Mynheer  van Coopmanschap  Sir  Pol  having gone thus far proceeded then to put the  grand Question  which was also carried as follows  Resolved Nemine Contradicente  That this Club will stand by assist and support  Mynheer van Coopmanschap  their old and constant Partner Confederate and Ally with all their Art and Skill not only against  Count Tariff  and Alderman  Traffick  but against all the  Harry Woolpacks  in  England  and against all other Opposers whatsoever  Landlady  and all  This Vote being past Sir  Pol  stood up and made another Speech and directed himself then to the  Club Mynheer  being withdrawn in which he spoke with a great deal of Heat and with all that Sense and Passion he used to speak with elsewhere  'He told them that having heard what had been said by  Mynheer van Coopmanschap  and what return had been made to him he expected no other but that they would Resolve to assist and stand by him  c  as they had done and that now having thus entered upon the thing the next and immediate Step was that they should consider of  Ways  and  Means  to put in execution what they had Resolved on that no time was to be lost that they expected every Post to hear that Count  Tariff  was come over and that the Articles of Partnership between him and Alderman  Traffick  c would presently be Ratifyed and a Law pass to make them EFFECTUAL and that then all was lost and their fast Friend  Coopmanschap  would be ruined'  'Then he run out in the praise of  Mynheer  how necessary it was to them to Support him how they could never hope to carry on their secret Designs  against the  Landlady  if they lost  Mynheer  and that all their Trade juggling which they had carried on so long with  Mynheer van Coopmanschap  would be spoiled if they did not prevent it just now'  '  Then he fell foul upon Count Tariff  you have heard his Character said he from  Mynheer van Coopmanschap  's own Mouth what a Tricking Cozening Bankrupt Fellow he is and what a Trade we are like to have with him if this Partnership should proceed and therefore  continued Sir Pol  my good Friends I would not have you be deceived by those who talk of your having a great Trade with him It is all a Cheat How should he want any of your Manufactures when he can make them all himself by his own Tenants and Servants whom he has lately set up and given great Encouragement to them out of his own Estate and as to the defect of Wooll which they pretend to say will prevent this that is effectually Answered by the News which came to me by the last Post and which I thought fit to communicate to you that it may by your Diligence and Correspondence in the Country be spread about among the Woollen Manufacturers and Clothiers of  Britain viz    That this Count  Tariff  has found out a new Invention not only to supply his own Tenants and Servants with good Woollen Manufactures but that in a little time he would be able to supply the whole World with Woollen Manufactures even  Britain  and all for that by this new Invention they could make FINE Manufactures of COARSE Wooll and he was told of another new Project setting up just now among them of making all the  English  Manufactures in  France without any Wooll AT ALL  which if they should bring to Perfection  as he feared they would  the  English  Trade would be quite ruined and the  French  Tenants of Count  Tariff  would Undersell them at all the Markets in  Europe  so that he doubted not but  the Club  would be convinced that it was their own Interest as well as his to prevent Count  Tariff  entering into any Measures here'  The Club were mightily affected with this part of Sir  Pol  's Speech and the Noise interrupted him for some time they appeared in a great Consternation as well they might at the mention of such a Project being set on foot in  France  for making  BroadCloth Sarges  c WITHOUT  WOOLL and a wise Senator of the Club wrs observed to shake his Head and with a deep Sigh to send forth this Ejaculation LAURD said he  What will become of poor  England  This will ruin us all with a Witness  What  The  French  Manufactures  without Wooll good lack  This is the effect of making Peace with the  French  This is a  French  Popish Project indeed I'll warrant the  New Ministry  have a Hand in it We shall be all undone alas poor  England  There was a general Murmur thro the whole Society on this surprizing Information insomuch that the House seemed in some Commotion and Sir  Pol  could not yet proceed but the wise Expressions which on that Occasion dropt from sundry Members of the Society being yet reserved in Whispers only History has made mention of no more than what is hinted above which Silence has been a sensible loss to Posterity who are thereby deprived of the many weighty Sentences dropt on that Occasion  After some time the Club being a little recovered Sir  Pol  reassumed his former Discourse and went on to lay down his Measures which  as he said  he would have them take to prosecute this Design  and the Ways and Means thereof as aforesaid And  First  'He told them he had been with  Alderman Traffick  and it is true  says he  I found him inflexible he talked loudly of the vast Advantages of the Partnership with Count  Tariff  the great Quantities of  English  Manufactures he was formerly accustomed to take off and would now again take off of our Hands but said Sir  Pol  I will confute them all by one piece of Conduct of mine for since  Alderman Traffick  cannot be brought over we must overpower him and run him down by our Numbers and Noise for this end  says he  it is absolutely necessary to separate  Harry Woolpack  from him  that is  to sow such Jealousies and Misunderstandings between the Country Manufacturers and the Merchants that they may not join together in this Partnership and therefore  continues he  I design in the next place to attack my old Acquaintance  Harry Woolpack  and I doubt not with a little help to make this Affair so popular that I will make  Harry  ashamed to show his Face in the Country if he does not break off this Partnership with  Tariff  '  ' To this purpose  says he  we must in the first place set to work all our Agents to expose bespatter villify blacken and defame Count  Tariff  and that not only here in the Town which we can do by the Assistance of our Friends at  North  's and at the  Amsterdam  CoffeeHouses not forgetting our learned Statesmen at the  Grecian  but also in all the Cloathing and Manufacturing Towns and Countries throughout  England  for this Work  says he  turning to two  BlackwellHallFactors  who sat next him here's my Friend  Josiah WhiteCloth  and  Phil Medley  Men of Interest in the Country shall write our Minds to  Harry Woolpack  and if they should not be able to prevail there's old  Joshua Doubledozen  the  Yorkshire  Man shall threaten him with his Mob out of the  North  and there is no doubt but  Harry Woollpack  will come up to Town and tell Alderman  Traffick  to his Face that he will have nothing to do with Count  Tariff  '  Sir  Poll  received several Humms and other Testimonies of Applause from the Club as he went on with this by which they signified their full Approbation of  every thing he said to them which encouraged him to proceed as follows  '  He told them  the breaking of  Harry Woollpack  from his Engagements with Alderman  Traffick  was  tho' in it self a Trifle  of very great Consequence to many other of their Designs as well as this of Count  Tariff  for it would immediately affect all the People of  Britain  it would alarm all the Manufacturers and make them believe their Trade was to be lost and undone and that they should be ruined it will make  says he  all the Clothing Towns write up to their Representatives and perswade them that all is at stake and that they'll CHOOSE them NO MORE if they do not take care about it in Parliament nay  says Sir Poll in some Extacy  it is not to be imagined how far we may run this Thought I question not  srys he  but we shall make it a  DOCTOR SACHEVERELL  to us and perhaps may make as good use of it for our purpose as was made by other People of that Affair of Dr  Sacheverell  's which it is evident was improved to a quite contrary purpose to what it was designed for and as the former part said he will be easily managed by  our Assistants at the places before named so we can never want a Detachment of Bullies from  Jenny Man  's and  St James  's Coffeehouse to assist in the latter and make a Tumult for us if there be occasion'  'Our Business then  continued he  is to raise  Harry Wool pack  's Passions for he is naturally a hotheaded Fellow and as furious and inconsiderate  as my self  when he is moved and when we have screw'd him up to a pitch he'll make  such a Noise  no body  else  shall be heard all over the Kingdom but he besides he has a prodigious Interest in the Country as well  Landedmen  and  Tradingmen  as  Moniedmen  they are all of his side and if once he raises his Voice he can call a strange multitude about him There's  Sergius Perpetuanus  the  Spaniard  of  Exeter  is always at his Elbow with an hundred thousand  Devonshiremen  and as many from  Tauntondean  There's  Joshua Doubledozen  and  Tom Kersie  out of the  North  from  Hallifax  and  Leeds  they were famous for their Numbers in Qu  Elizabeth  's time Then there's  Goad Cotton  Esq  and  Flanel ap Plane  the Welchman they are all at his Beck and are able to raise  all  NorthWales Shropshire  and  Lancashire  for him besides  Henry Stroudwater  of  Cirencester  Sir  Isaac ReBay  of  Colchester Jack AllStuff  of  Norwich Benjamin Drugget  of  Newberry  and several others who are all such Dependants upon this  Woollpack  that if he does but hold up his Finger they are at his Beck so that  in short  the Sum of this Matter is to perswade  Harry Woollpack  to break this Bargain and to fright him with the Apprehensions of losing all his Trade Let us get but this done then  says he  and we need not value  Old Traffick  for if he insists upon it never so much if  Woolpack  does not come in it can never go on or be made EFFECTUAL'  'It follows next says  Sir Pol  that we consider of the Methods to bring this to pass and the only way to do this  as I said before  is to bespatter Count  Tariff  and heap up all the Scandal we can upon him by which we shall make him frightful and odious to  Woollpack  and his Friends and if he should venture after this to come over hither to get the Articles of his new Partnership made EFFECTUAL we'll bring  Harry Woollpack  in as Plaintiff get him Indicted  for a Cheat and a Pickpocket and have him Tried for his Life  This Speech was too full of Gall PartyRage and particular Malice not to suit well and be very acceptable to the whole Assembly for Temper and Moderation was long ago hiss'd out of the Club as an Enemy to the Being and Nature of their Constitution like a Coward who is Troop'd out of a Camp by  Beat of Drum  as a Person of no manner of use in the Army  Being then sufficiently prepared by this Plan of their Proceedings laid down by  Sir Poll  they fell to work immediately and first they voted that Count  Tariff  was a  Frenchman  and therefore let the Gain of the Partnership be what it would we had better be without him This was voted with such a Clamour in the Club that nothing could be heard for a great while but the repeated Cry of No  French Man  no  French Wine  no  French Trade  no  Brandy  sell no Manufactures to a  Frenchman  and the like  'The last Word startled a certain  Warehouseman  in the Club whose Interest could not tell how to lye like the rest  Hold there a little says he  sell no Manufactures to a  Frenchman  Hang it  says he  I can't go that Length neither for I sold one of Count  Tariff  's Friends a thousand Pounds worth of Druggets and Serges but last Week  That won't do says he  and so taking the Opportunity of the Hurry he sneak'd out of the Club'  But the Vote passed  as above  with too much Noise for any thing of Reason or Argument to be heard This was no sooner over but another Wiseman stands up whether he was a  Salter  or a  Grocer  Authors are not agreed about it But addressing himself to the Chair  '  Sir Pol  says he I understand this Count  Tariff  is a  Frenchman  then to be sure he is a  Jacobite  and will bring in the  Pretender  upon us  ergo  all they who are for Count  Tariff  are  Jacobites  I desire it may be put to the Question which was done thus'  RESOLVED That it is the Opinion of this Society that all those who are for Trading with a  Frenchman  are  JACOBITES  Upon which the House divided  Yeas No's    So it was carried by a great Majority But that not being satisfactory to the Citizen who proposed it  who was for thorough Work  he moved again and said it was a  Dishonour to the Club that such a significant Vote  as that  should not have passed  Nemine contradicente  and therefore the  No  's ought to be Expelled the House  which was accordingly done  The Members who were voted expell'd desired to explain themselves but a Scots Pamphleteer  since fled from Justice  stood up  and said  the Tories condemned a Peer to lose his Head in his Country for offering an Explanation to a publick Act and he was sure those Members were Tories in Disguise for sure none but a Tory would Trade with a  Frenchman  and therefore he was for farther Prosecution against them  Ʋpon which  the withdrew for fear of some of his Justice  The next Question was  What Religion Count  Tariff  was of  This produced a hideous Cry of a  Papish  a  Papish  a  Papish  no Trade with a  Papish  no Trade with a  Papish  and such as that and this rung round the ClubRoom like a Vote in the CommonHall when a Sheriff is put up from the Hustings which is usually a Quarter of an Hour a sounding  After many Debates of this nature  it was resolved  That the Votes of the Club should be made publick and be sent down  into the  West  to their honoured Friend  Henry Woollpack  Esq  and that he be admonished by his trusty Correspondent  Josiah Whitecloth  and  Phil Medley  that as it is resolved in the Committee that it cannot be safe for  England  that he should trade with Count  Tariff  who is a  Frenchman  a  Jacobite  and a  Papist  so that this is the Advice of the whole Club to him and that he should take care not to be wheedled into it by Alderman  Traffick  for that altho' the said  Traffick  was an experienc'd Merchant and generally speaking an honest Man yet he was lately turned about and was on the wrong Side that it was to be feared he was inclined to the  Pretender  and therefore he should have a care of him for if he was drawn in to join in the Partnership he was undone  Nor did they stop here  but they order'd that the Character of Count  Tariff  should be defamed and bespattered as much as possible by their Scots Pamphleteer aforesaid as long as he durst stay for fear of the Pillory and by their  Lying Posts  their daily Libels circular Letters and scurrilous Prints of every kind for which they had their Authors and Printers of the Society always in Pay and they gave them  a general Order not to stick at any thing so it would but blacken Count  Tariff  and Alderman  Traffick  nor to stick at any Person that spake in their behalf tho' it were the  Landlady  herself agreeing also that they would carry on the same Design themselves in all their Conversation and at all the Committees of their Society held at the usual Places  to wit  the  Grecian Jenny Man  's  St James  's and those in the City  viz North  's the  Amsterdam Hamlin  's c and that this should be carried on universally without Respect of Persons as aforesaid but especially upon their  Landlady  who they reported to be sick and dying and openly acknowledged they  wish'd it was so  till the Brewer in  Thamesstreet  was taken up for it which terrified the disbanded Officer aforesaid and others his Neighbours and made them more careful of their Tongues  In the mean time Alderman  Traffick  whose Genius was turned for Trade and who understood it better than Sir  Pol  or any of them being convinc'd that the Partnership with Count  Tariff  was wellgrounded and that it was calculated for the general Good not of himself only but of his Partner  Harry Woollpack  and all his Dependants he resolved to regard  none of them but to go on steadily in his Design of making the Partnership EFFECTUAL  But the Alderman knowing what sort of People he had to do with and what he was to expect from them afterwards that he might leave them without Excuse resolved to have their own Testimonials to what he was doing and therefore long before he concluded the Treaty for this Partnership by his Agents abroad he s  nt Letters down into the Country not only to  Harry Woollpack  himself but to all his  f  rementioned Friends and Dealers such as  Joshua Doubledozen  of  Leeds Tom  Perpetuanus  of  Exet    Sir  Isaac  of Colchester Goad Cotton  Esq  and  Flannel ap Plane  Clothiers of  NorthWales  and to many more which it would be too long to name here signifying his Intention of entering into Partnership with Count  Tariff  and asking their Opinion of the same whether they thought it might be for the Publick Advantage or no particularly and expresly desiring them if they had any Objections to make or any thing to propose for their own Advantage in the said Trade and Partnership with Count  Tariff  that they would send up their said Requests and Objections  before the Partnership was concluded and particularly their Opinions as to the Trade it self after it should be agreed whether it was for the Publick Advantage or no  In Answer to this  Harry Woollpack  in particular and all the rest also however they have been misguided since sent up long Memorials and Representations expressing their full Satisfaction in the said Partnership and proposing such and such Alterations and Additions as they thought necessary to be provided against altered or added upon doing whereof  they all  gave it under their hands that the said  Partnership  would be very advantageous to them and that a Trade with Count  Tariff  had been  before  and would be  again  with such Regulations a very beneficial Trade to them and all their Neighbours Which Memorials and Representations under their Hands are yet to be produced to their Faces when occasion requires  As Alderman  Traffick  was thus confirmed in his Opinion of the Goodness of his Design not only by his own Judgment but by the said Memorials and Representations of  Harry Woollpack  and all his Friends he gave Count  Tariff  an Invitation  to come over to  England  in order to have the Partnership consummated and the Articles MADE EFFECTUAL who accordingly arrived here the st Day of  March  last being the same Day that Sir  Pol  laid the Plan in the Club for his Destruction as aforesaid  No sooner was the  Count  arrived but the Club began to put their Measures  which they had resolved on  in Execution And FIRST In order to make the Affair of the said Partnership a  PartyCause  they railed at him as a  Jacobite  and caused a Report to be spread all over the Kingdom that he had brought the  Pretender  with him and particularly they took care to make  Harry Woollpack  really believe it which was the first beginning of the Breach on that Side  The poor  Count  who never knew what  Whig  and  Tory  meant and was of no Party but for the Universal Good of Mankind was surprized to hear them call him a  Jacobite  and askt  What Trade that was  'He told them he never concerned himself with Government it was his Business always to submit to the legal Establishment of the Country he was in to pay Customs and Duties chearfully and not only to augment the Revenues  of the Princes who Reigned but to assist and enable their People to pay chearfully and willingly whatever the Laws obliged them to that it was his constant Custom to acknowledge the Power but never concerned himself about the Persons Reigning much less about those who should or should not succeed and that for being a  Jacobite  he knew nothing of it'  But let the  Count  say what he would it was to no purpose Sir  Pol  and his Club had Voted it and the Cry was gone out into the Country that Count  Tariff  was come over with the  French  Ambassador and had brought over the  Pretender  nay and that he was actually lodged in  Somersethouse  The Design of this was to have the  Count  Mobb'd and torn to pieces in the Street  or else  which would answer  Mynheer Coopmanschap  's end better that he should be terrified with the Apprehensions of it and should be obliged to retire with him to  Holland  But they were disappointed in the first part of their Project for the  Count  having given Alderman  Traffick  full Satisfaction that he was a Person wholly concerned in Matters of Trade and in them only and that he desired to have no  other Busines here the  Alderman  protected him from the Mob and from the fury of Sir  Pol  and also cleared up his Character as to  Jacobitism  well enough  The Party then finding themselves unable to hurt the  Count  this way apply themselves to their OTHER METHOD  viz  To attack his Character as to Trade and here indeed they met with better Success tho' it was by the help of the most scandalous Methods and the unjust Practices in the World as will appear in the sequel of our History  To enter into the better Description of these things we must go back to the  Club  and to Sir  Pol  their Director Sir  Pol  who is naturally Cholerick and abominably revengeful having been heated with the Disappointment he had received  as above  and not being able to get the  Count  Mobb'd for a  Jacobite  and for bringing over the  Pretender  he called  a Club  on a  Saturday  Night late and coming into the Assembly in a great Passion told them the Alderman had basely entertained Count  Tariff  by Authority and that he believed that even the LANDLADY her self was a  Jacobite  and he did not question but the  Pretender  might have been found hid under Count  Tariff  's Cloak  or was pack'd up in his Equipage if the Officers might have searched him whereas Alderman  Traffick  had forbidden them to Affront him but that he had been even both with the  Alderman  and the  Landlady  too for that and had taken Care they should be both Exposed for it over the whole Nation and upon this he called for the  Scots  Pampleeter who pulled out two Printed Ballads which he said would do their Business one was  The Merchant Alamode  the other  The Ambassadresses Speech  which he gave about to the whole Club and ordered Copies to be distributed to  Harry Woollpack  and his Friends by the Printer to the Society  It was true  that those Wicked Measures of Sir  Pol  and his Fraternity did a little stagger  Harry Woollpack  and his Friends so that they began to decline the Partnership which Alderman  Traffick  had made and sent up Letters and Addresses to the  Alderman  not to go on with it and made some Clamours against making it EFFECTUAL as shall be shewn in its place which Proceedings occasioned some delay in the Matter at first but their Eyes were soon opened and they were all convinced of their Mistake at last and  tho' 'tis true it was too late to retrieve the first Damages of the thing yet it taught them to know Sir  Pol  a little better than they did before and to have a care of him accordingly which tended in the end to the Effectual settling the Affair But to return to Sir  Pol  and the Club  The Club received his last Harangue with great Satisfaction and were more especially diverted with the Ballads for any thing that affronted their  Landlady  was always agreeable to the Club But their Mirth was almost spoiled by an unlucky Motion made by one of their own Body  tho' Innocently  for he was as much a wellwisher to Sir  Pol  and to his Country's disorder as any of them but was not let into the whole Secrets of Management and did not know that the Work was to be done  Per fas  aut  Ne fas  This grave Citizen was a  Warehouseman  by Occupation and therefore mightily concerned for the Woollen Manufacture tho' History has not recorded his Name This Man standing up in his place told the Chairman that he approved very well of what Sir  Pol  had proposed as to defaming and blackning Count  Tariff  and his Adherents to  Harry Woolpack  and his Friends  against the proposed Partnership and to raise the Mob upon  Count Tariff  only  says he  'I think it would be necessary to get a certain eminent old Citizen whom I was formerly acquainted with on our Side in all we do of this Nature one says he you have all heard of for he fined for Alderman in the time of Sir  William Turner  was well acquainted with the  French  Trade and might be a match for old Alderman  Traffick  or any of them and this is old Merchant FACT for  continues he  the Reputation of this old Gentleman is such that no Body will question what we say if he is on our Side and on the other hand if Count  Tariff  should get him  from us  it will put us to a very great  Nonplus  '  Upon this Motion Sir  Pol  stood up and first looking about to see if the Door was shut and none of the Drawers in the Room  'GENTLEMEN  says he  what Deputy …… has proposed is very good and would be to the Purpose and I have been trying some time to get this old Gentleman on our Side but I must tell you  in Confidence  that he is gone out of the way and  I fear  is gone over to the Enemy or at least  has withdrawn himself whereupon having seriously bethought my self I have found out two Expedients in order to supply his Place'  ' Says he I own 'tis absolutely necessary to make  Harry Woolpack  and his People believe that Merchant FACT is really on our Side and therefore I have resolved to take that part upon my self and set up a Counterfeit Merchant FACT in his room which I will show to the Mob as I find occasion nay rather than fail says Sir  Pol  I'll counterfeit Merchant FACT my self indeed I must be concealed from those People's View who are well acquainted with his Countenance or with his Mind but as to  Harry Woollpack  he will take any thing we say to him upon Trust and we have nothing to do as to him but to say we have got Merchant FACT on our Side and he will presently cry out of all that Count  Tariff  and his Friends can say that  it is all Lyes  and therefore if you please leave this to my Management it is but putting a good Face to it I make no question but we shall carry it as well as if we had Merchant FACT along with us for Noise and Falshood at this time of  Day will with good Management go as far as Fact and Truth can do'  ' To carry on this Disguise with the greater certainty of Success continues he I have found out an excellent Assistant and one that stood a fast Friend to me in former Days when the Citizens our Ancestors had just such another Game to play upon King  Charles  II  This Assistant  says he  has misled the City these thirty Years with such Dexterity and such admirable Success that no Body has discovered or detected him yet having thirteen or fourteen Hands of the principal Merchants of  London  to a Certificate of his Integrity in the Year these he drew in at that time without any enquiry to Vouch for him taking all he said upon Trust And that I may hold you in suspence no longer this is the famous SCHEME OF TRADE brought up with old  Whiston  the Devil's Broker and as accurate a Lvar as ever his Master was'  The Assembly received this Proposal of Sir  Pol  's with a general Approbation and recommended to him the necessary Dispatch In the mean time Count  Tariff  began to appear abroad again and Alderman  Traffick  declared that he had entered  into Partnership with him and that he had resolved to apply to the  Landlady  to have the Articles of the said Partnership MADE EFFECTUAL by Law  Now was Sir  Pol  to play his Game or never for Alderman  Traffick  pushed on his Design to a Hearing before such Judges as the LANDLADY had directed it to be laid before wherefore  in the First place  Sir  Pol  attacks him with publick Defamation  as was agreed before  and spread a thousand Clandestine Stories about of his Behaviour as that he was Clandestinely run away from his Partners abroad that he had broke his word there and never kept his Articles with any Body so that there was no depending upon any thing he said that he was a Bankrupt and had not paid his Debts and therefore it was not safe to enter into any Treaty of Partnership with him that he pretended to come hither for Trade and to buy a great many Woollen Manufactures but that his Design was of another kind that he was no Friend to Trade at all but a meer  Papish  and a  Jacobite  and had a Design to bring in the  Pretender  that he intended not to buy any of our Manufactures and was so far from  wanting Woollen Manufactures at home that he was the Inventor and Encourager of that new Invention among his own Tenants of making  fine  Goods of  coarse  Wooll as abovesaid and of making sundry Woollen Manufactures without any Wooll AT ALL in which he had made a very considerable Progress now tho' among Merchants this way of Defaming a Man is very Barbarous and Infamous also yet Count  Tariff  bore it without any Concern and went on with his Business  Sir  Pol  and his Party then finding this would not do neither and that  Count Tariff  's Reputation was so clear that if they did not find out some other way to Ruin him he would not carry his Point they resolved to spring their  last Mine  and blow him up at once to this purpose OLD SCHEME the Fellow mentioned before who  as above  had lived several Years by Cheating and Counterfeiting Names making false Accounts forming Abstracts of the CustomHouse Books  and the like  is brought out to act his part upon Count  Tariff  to get him Indicted for a Cheat and so they resolved to bring him to a Tryal This old  Knight of the Post  having his Lesson given  him alledged that the  Count  came hither to sell his Goods for ready Mony and carry it away in Specie contrary to the Act of Parliament in that Case made and provided that he had Contracted to turn OWLER and carry away our Wooll  Ʋnmanufactured  into  France  that all the Accounts given by Alderman  Traffick  of the large Commissions the  Count  had brought from  France  for buying  English  Woollen Manufactures was a meer Cheat that he had Ships already upon the Coast loaden with Wine and Brandy which must be all paid for in Mony the Bills being drawn already and accepted that he was in a Plot to introduce the French Wines to be the common Draught instead of  neatPort  contrary to the Inclination of our  Soveraign Lord the People  and to poison us all with  French  Brandy our own Malt Spirits being known to be much wholsomer  These and many other heinous Crimes being laid to Count  Tariff  's Charge by this suborner old SCHEME they pushed on the Process and got Count TARIFF arraigned for a Cheat in the Name and at the Suit of  Henry Woollpack  and Company tho' without their actual Consent too  The  Count  who knew his own Innocence did not question but in such a Religious Nation as this was fam'd to be he should have Justice done him and therefore tho' he might have pleaded  to the Jurisdiction of the Court  as having entered into a Partnership which those who contracted it with him were  undoubtedly impowered  by their own  Natural Right  to engage in and that without giving an Account to any Body  and tho' also  he might have pleaded the Law of Nations for Protection yet waving all these things he frankly offered himself to the Court and desired to be brought  to Tryal  which accordingly was done  Upon his Tryal the usual Forms having passed and  the Charge  being read the first thing that gave the Court some Diversion was the detecting Sir  Pol  for he had Disguised himself and appeared in Court under the Name of MERCHANT FACT but as he was personating the old Man and endeavouring also to speak as if he had lost his Teeth that he might conceal the Hesitations which  want of Truth  obliged him frequently to make by great Misfortune all on a sudden his FALSE BEARD  fell  off  this made him be more strictly observed and some Persons in Court who formerly had some Acquaintance with the real Merchant FACT spoke openly and offered to prove that this was not the Man upon which all the honest People that stood by hissed at him most intolerably and if ever he could have Blushed in his Life it was thought it would have been at this time  Tho' he found himself thus detected yet wanting no Assurance he turned it off with a ready shift that indeed he was not Merchant FACT of  London  but he was Goodman FACT of  Gloucestershire  and he hoped he said that if he was a true FACT the Difference of CityFact or CountryFACT would not be much  The Court allowed that in his favour and then put him to the proof of what he had said for which he appealed all along to his FACTOR old  Scheme  The whole Charge being read and all Sir  Pol  and his Voucher  old Scheme  had to say being heard with the utmost patience by the Court Count  Tariff  was allowed to speak for himself  He spoke with great Modesty of himself He said  'That he was no Cheat  and had no Evil Design that he had  always been a Friend to the  British  Commerce and that he had been suspected in his own Country on that Account that he came to reside here for the Benefit of  GreatBritain  that he could have had very advantageous Conditions if he would have joined with  Mynheer van Coopmanschap  and never have come here at all and that he could still be very well received if he would engage with him instead of the  English  Merchants that he was so far from being in Debt abroad that on the contrary  Mynheer van Coopmanschap  owed him twenty Millions of Guilders and he was ready to prove it by his Books but that he feared very much he should never get his Money'  '  He told them  that considering how well it was known that he came hither with no other Intent but purely to do the Nation Service and that the  Dutch  might not run away with their Trade he was surprized that he should meet with such Treatment That he expected better Usage that he had been promised he should be Amicably received when he came hither and that by some who  he saw  appeared very warm against him now and who he  took for Men of more Honour'  This Reflected upon  Harry Woollpack  and his Friends who indeed began to be ashamed of Sir  Pol  and to sneak away one by one  He went on  to Complain  'That the Witnesses who appeared against him were scandalous Fellows that Merchant  Fact  was personated indeed but it was a Counterfeit for Merchant FACT was his old Acquaintance and Correspondent and he knew him very well he was a  middle sized  FAIR  Gentleman  of an honest Countenance and a calm composed Temper But as to that tall black passionate hangman look'd Fellow who called himself Merchant FACT he was not in the least like him and he much wondered he said that any Court of Justice should admit  counterfeit  FACTS for  true  especially after they were so openly Detected'  'Then a to OLD SCHEME  he said  he was an Upstart that indeed he had not heard of before but upon hearing his Evidence he would undertake to prove upon the spot that he was guilty of  Lying  and  Counterfeiting  and that he had practised those things ever  since the Year and he desired he might call his Witnesses to this'  The Court was very much moved at this Discourse and readily gave the  Count  leave to call his Witnesses which made every Body believe that he would carry his Cause and indeed Sir  Pol  's Friends began to despair for him for the  Count  in the first place produced a whole Cartload of Books Draughts Accounts and other Papers from the Customhouse with the proper Officers attending to Vouch their being Authentick and the Commissioners Hands to them upon Examining whereof it appeared that OLD SCHEME had really drawn false Accounts counterfeited the Names who he had pretended had attested them and that none of all the Accounts he had produced agreed with the Originals in the Customhouse Books from whence he pretended he had copied them  This caused the Court very much to resent the Usage they had met with from the old Knave and some Authors affirm that it was moved he should be exposed and his Accounts burnt by the Hangman but the turn that afterwards happened to  these things saved him from receiving his just Reward  at that time  This put Sir  Pol  's Party into a great Consternation But Sir  Pol  who never was at a loss produced in the next place a great Number of Petitions from Country and City  the first  procured by the two  BlackwellHall  Factors formerly mentioned These had sent blank Petitions of their own drawing up to  Harry Woollpack  's Friends all over  England  telling the Country Clothiers by Letters that if they did not Sign them they were undone and their Trade would be all given away to  France the last  was from the Weavers and Companies in  London  procured by the same Sollicitation and most of the said last Petitions having the same Hands to them all  Against these Alderman  Traffick  in behalf of Count  Tariff  produced a Multitude of Representations from all parts of  England  to himself being the same formerly mentioned entreating him to invite Count  Tariff  over hither and to engage in Partnership with him expressing their great Satisfaction and how advantageous it would be to the Nation if he could be prevailed upon to become Partner with  Harry Woolpack  and himself  as aforesaid representing also what an advantageous Trade  GreatBritain  enjoyed formerly when the old real Merchant FACT and the  Count  corresponded together And that which was most surprizing in this part of the  Count  's Defence was that many of these Petitions and Representations were from the very same Places and Signed by the very same Hands which had Signed Sir  Pol  's Petitions  viz  from  Harry Woollpack  and his Friends abovenamed which was a clear Proof that Party and Faction had procured the  last  and Truth and Reason had procured the  first  Sir  Pol  finding that it thus went against him and that he was in danger of losing his Cause had got one Card left to play which indeed carried the whole Cause and ruined all the Measures which  Alderman Traffick  had laid for making this Partnership EFFECTUAL and this was to bring a MOB and make a Tumult round about the Court These  old Scheme  had prepared for his Attendants consisting of  Harry Woollpack  's Servants and Dependants tho' their Master was withdrawn as before  viz  Clothworkers Dyers Packers Calenders Setters Hotpressers  BlackwellHall  FACTORS with  their Apprentices Porters Carmen and whatever Sir  Pol  and  Scheme  by their mighty Interest could get together These raised a Hubbub without the Court crying out no Count  Tariff  no  Tariff  send away Count  Tariff  Let the  Dutch  or the Devil have Count  Tariff  and Alderman  Traffick  too we care not no TARIFF no TARIFF likewise all the while the Court were considering of the Case and preparing to give their Opinion Sir  Pol  and  old Scheme  who had now no other Game to play and were at their Wits end interrupted them with a hideous Noise and Clamour crying no  Tariff  no  Tariff  nay some it seems cryed no  Trade  no  Tariff  This  as Noise generally does in the like Cases  was said to have influenced many whether it intimidated any or no History is silent as to that but Sir  Pol  saw evidently that it had turned the Scale very much on his Side At length a certain  Suffolk Gentleman  then in Court desired leave to offer an Expedient to appease the present Tumult and satisfy all Parties which having been granted he began to speak He acknowledged  '  That  he had been as forward as any for the  Count  's coming over he said  that  he was still of the  Opinion that Count  Tariff  was capable of laying a good Foundation for the Interest of  GreatBritain  and  that  he abhorred the Tricks and Forgeries of Sir  Pol  and his ShamEvidence  Old Scheme  as much as any one did  that  he had given his Assistance in drawing the Partnership now in Debate and did think the Articles of it were a sufficient Ground to establish the Commerce of the Nation upon  But that  in regard the Noise was so great and the Clamour without doors so loud  that  neither the Count nor his Witnesses could be heard and that the Term being now expiring  the Court  could not sit long enough to determine a thing of so great Consequence he proposed therefore  that  Persons might be chosen on both sides and appointed  to adjust such Matters as were not fully settled  and to  explain the several Meanings  of both sides so that  an entire Scheme of the Trade  which Count  Tariff  proposed  might be framed which might fully answer the good Intentions of the LANDLADY for the Good and Welfare of her Tenants  And that to this purpose the Debate about confirming the Articles of the Partnership with Count  Tariff  and making the same EFFECTUAL  might be delayed for the present to be reassumed the first Cause next  MichaelmasTerm  and then to be fully discussed try'd and determined by a Jury of  LandedMen  to be returned by all the High Sheriffs of  GreatBritain  and that in the mean time Direction might be given that the Court might be imposed upon by no more Counterfeits no more Goodman FACTS but that the true Merchant FACT of  London  might be found out and desired to appear to whom all due Respect Honour and Regard should be shewn by the Court'  This after some Debate being put to the Question and carry'd by a Majority of nine Voices the Cause was put off accordingly  As soon as Mynheer  Van Coopmanschap  who lay all this while concealed at a certain Lawyer's Chamber in the  Temple  had an Account of this Success he came down to the Club with great Joy having first by Advice of Sir  Pol  and other Members of his Acquaintance sent several Loads of Fagots to  Basinghallstreet Spittlefields Ludgatebill  and other convenient Places to make Bonfires and please their Mob  Being come into the Club  'he return'd them his hearty Thanks for the great Service they had done him which he assured them he would endeavour to return upon all occasions if they should have any need of him whether upon falling out with their LANDLADY or in whatever Business they should require his Assistance'  He told them  'He hop'd they would continue the same Care for his Affairs against the next Term and especially to provide good Advocates to plead for him He likewise told them he doubted not but he should renew his Partnership with Count  Tariff  the next Morning for he was a Person that could not be out of Business'  And so making a  very low Bow  he offered to take his Leave  But Sir  Pol  making a Sign to him to stay stood up and spoke to him to the following Purpose  He told him  The Society was very glad they had been serviceable to him in this Affair that they were well satisfied that he should enter into the Partnership with Count  Tariff  as he desired tho' thereby he should engross all the Trade to himself that they would not fail to use their Interest to  get him good Lawyers to plead for him against next Term and particularly he told him that they would use their Endeavours to get the High Sheriffs to return him a good Jury who should be as willing to give up the Trade of the Kingdom to him as the Club had been which he said required a great deal of Art and good Management on their part to bring to pass  He put him in mind however  That the Club had pawn'd their Credit with  Harry Woolpack  and his Friends in the Country and with all the Mob that they had gotten together to make a Noise for him that he  Mynheer  and his Partners in  Holland  would take off all their Woollen Manufactures and Fish and that they should have no Loss by their refusing the Partnership with Count  Tariff  which if  I  had not done  says Sir Pol  and my good Friend here Mr SCHEME you had had no Appearance for you to day and had certainly lost your Point And therefore  Mynheer  said Sir  Pol  we hope you will be as good as your Word and keep up our Credit with the Country without which we shall never be able to get you a good Jury chosen  Mynheer  chang'd the Air of his Countenance upon this Proposal and told them  coldly  he would do them what Service he could but that as to the FishTrade it was out of his way to buy any in  Britain  he having Ships of his own with which he could catch them on our  Northcoasts  sooner than we did our selves  But as to our Woollen Manufactures he said he would take a pretty large Quantity of  Glocestershirecloths  and  Exeterserges  only he said he must have the Cloths WHITE and the Serges in the GREASE because the Dying Dressing  c  was to be done in  Holland  that his own poor Servants might be employed'  Having said thus he withdrew and the next Morning having enter'd into a Parnership with Count  Tariff for one Year certain  they went away together for  Amsterdam  where as we are informed they drive a very great Trade and Count  Tariff  in particular has already bought a very great Quantity of  EastIndia  Goods of him with Hogsheads of  Guelderland  Tobacco and other Goods in proportion  The Club being thus disappointed appeared very much dejected and we hear that  Harry Woollpack  and his Friends are gone home into the Country in a Fret disoblig'd and dissatisfied as they might very well be their Manufactures being thrown back upon their hands by the  Dutchman  now his own Ends were served  Mynheer  Van Coopmanschap  being gone and Count  Tariff  also the Chairman thought fit to appoint that the Committee should meet every Evening to concert Measures for the carrying on the Interest of  Mynheer  according to their Promise and to oppose every one that in the least countenanced the Partnership with Alderman  Traffick  And to the end that this might be done more effectually Sir  Pol  proposed that they should send for their Scots Pamphleteer who had formerly done them very good Service in frequent publishing their Scandals and who being lately fled from Justice had been entertained in  Coopmanschap  's Family abroad This was no sooner agreed to but the Fugitive appeared in the Club having been lurking about the Town for some time and was set immediately to work to write Pamphlets in Favour of Mynheer  Coopmanschap  It cannot be expected we can collect all the scurrilous Invectives which History has given an Account of that were written upon this Occasion as well against Count  Tariff  as against the LANDLADY her self the first were especially directed to reconcile the People to the breaking off the Partnership between Count  Tariff  and Alderman  Traffick  and to inflame  Harry Woollpack  again so that instead of being sensible of his Loss and the Injury done to his Trade he should like well to have all the Business go through old  Coopmanschap  's Hands and himself be a  Jackholdmystaff  to the  Dutchman  This was the more difficult for them to effect because  Harry Woollpack  had been so ill used by  Mynheer  and had seen so much of his Knavery in the  late Tryal  especially when the pretended Merchant FACT's false Beard  dropt off  and discover'd him to be no FACT but meer  Sir Pol Falshood  disguised in the Habit of the true Merchant FACT that he was gone down in the Country disgusted and had openly said they were a Pack of Knaves and that he would never have any more to do with them that they were in a Confederacy with  Old Coopmanschap  to enrich him at the Expence  of their Country and to let him make a Monopoly of the English Trade  Sir  Pol  was not ignorant that it was absolutely necessary in order to prevent their present Design that they should bring over this  Harry Woollpack  again and to this end they were to set all their Engines at work to blow Dust into his Eyes that he should not see too far into their Measures The Methods they took for this as is said before are too many to be inserted in this place but the Histories of those Times cannot fail to supply the Want It may suffice to let the Reader know that this was diligently endeavoured by charging Alderman  Traffick  with the Breach of a Partnership he had been engaged in with  Don Sebastian  a  Portuguese  Merchant and with threatning what a great Damage it would be to  Harry Woollpack  if  Don Sebastian  should take the Pett and refuse to Trade with him and his Friends altho' it was well known that  Don Sebastian  had no other Market for his own Goods nor could he be supplied any other way with such Goods as  Harry Woollpack  Traded in and besides all that  Don Sebastian  was so Embarrassed with reference to a neighbouring Merchant who demanded great Arrears from him of an  old Contract that was between them which amounted to more than the said  Don Sebastian  was able to pay that he was fain to make use of Alderman  Traffick  and his Interest to prevent a very great Suit at  Law  being commenc'd against him and it was very improbable that he would do any thing so very affronting to Alderman  Traffick  as what these Men talked of at the same time that he was so much obliged to him other ways  On the other hand  Don Sebastian  saw that there was so much Necessity for what Alderman  Traffick  had done with respect to some Particulars of their Partnership that he appeared very well satisfied therewith and did not pretend to take any Step that look'd as if there was any Unkindness between them So that all the Clamour on that side ceased and  Don Sebastian  very freely offered to renew his Partnership with Alderman  Traffick  upon Terms of Friendship and good Correspondence and to Trade together as much as ever they did On the other hand Alderman  Traffick  espoused the Interest of  Don Sebastian  so heartily and so effectually being made Arbitrator between him and his Neighbour  Don Philippo  the  Spanish  Merchant that he got that Breach  amicably made up and a chargeable Suit at Law which he was threatned with effectually prevented  This was such a piece of Service to  Don Sebastian  and he being a Person of great Honour and Gratitude was made so sensible of it that it prevented all manner of Misunderstanding between him and Alderman  Traffick  to the great Mortification of Sir  Pol  and his Friends who had made a mighty great Noise of this Business  Being disappointed in their Measures in this Particular and not able to bring over  Harry Woollpack  as they designed to do to their Party the next thing they went about was to see what they were able to do as to getting a pack'd Jury against Count  Tariff  's Tryal came on  Writing Pamphlets and filling the Country with most abominable Untruths Scandal Slander and false Rumours to make the People uneasy this was their stated neverfailing Method but the main Point was to bring the Character of Count  Tariff  into Contempt to which nothing was wanting that could possibly be done by Men who neither valued their own Reputation or any Man's else nay even the LANDLADY her self was in  a most unchristian manner insulted by their Writers and treated with the greatest Indecency imaginable although they knew her to be the best of Landladies and though they enjoyed their Shops with the utmost Quiet under her paying as little Rent as could be expected and although she had successfully protected them against all those who would have disturbed them  Whenever these Pamphleteers had printed any thing that treated their said LANDLADY either disrespectfully or injuriously or that insulted her in the Government of her own Affairs the Club industriously conveyed those Prints throughout the whole Kingdom and spread them among all her Tenants and Servants in order to accustom and inure them to treat her in the same manner  As to her immediate Servants they were treated by these People in the most scandalous manner imaginable and upon all Occasions so scurrilously and injuriously used in their ordinary Business and in the Discharge of their Duty to their  Landlady  and  Mistress  that it look'd not only as if these Men had a Right superior even to their  Landlady  her self but that she was not lawfully Lady of the Manour  or were not rightful Possessor of the Tenements which she had let to them  This they thought was useful to awe and browbeat those good Country People whose proper Business it was to bring the Names of those Gentlemen to the High Sheriffs  c  who were to return the Jury by whom Count  Tariff  was to be tryed  But this had a quite contrary Effect for when the Country Tenants especially  Harry Woollpack  and his People came to see how their good  Landlady  was served for whom they had an unseigned Zeal and Affection and upon what Account and with what little Reason she was so unmannerly and undutifully handled it raised their Passions to the highest degree and they resolved to have nothing to do with Sir  Pol  and his Party  This also had a good effect the other way for it discovered the Designs of Sir  Pol  and his CLUB and it gave the People Warning against being farther imposed upon by which means there appears a general good Disposition among them all to choose such a Jury as shall hear the Cause of Count  Tariff  with Impartiality and that will not be bullied by Sir  Politick Falshood  and his  Falsebeard  or be put off from doing Justice by the Noise of his Rabble so that there is no Question but the Partnership between Count  Tariff  and Alderman  Traffick  will be approved and the Articles thereof upon a fair and full hearing of the Cause be made EFFECTUAL  POSTSCRIPT  SInce the aforesaid Memoirs were written we are given to understand that there are divers Accounts come from abroad of the great Joy which the rejecting Count  Tariff  in  England  had occasioned in  France  especially among the Manufacturers of Woollen Goods in the several Provinces of  Languedoc Pictou Anjou  c where upon the first News of the Treaty of a Partnership between Count  Tariff  and  Harry Woollpack  Alderman  Traffick  and others in  London  the People were under the greatest Consternation imaginable knowing that if that  Partnership  went on and should be made EFFECTUAL by Alderman  Traffick  's  Landlady  and that Count  Tariff  had come off at his Tryal with that Applause which they heard was expected their several Undertakings of Woollen Manufactures in those Places would be ruined  They had represented this before to Count  Tariff  himself humbly Addressing  and Entreating him not to enter into Partnership with Alderman  Traffick  for that it would be to the ruin of his own Country if he did They also applyed themselves to their own  Landlord  to try if he could be prevailed upon to prevent Count  Tariff  from entering into any Engagement which would be so fatal to all his Tenants  But the  Landlord  's Circumstances were at that time such that he could not conveniently interpose in the Matter for Alderman  Traffick  's  Landlady  and he had newly ended a long and chargeable SUIT at LAW and being made Friends he was unwilling to Disoblige her tho' he complyed with Conditions which at other Times he would not have done nor had the Partnership with Count  Tariff  ever been made upon such advantageous Terms if it had not been so  Being thus repulsed by their  Landlord  the poor Manufacturers had no recourse but to Count  Tariff  entreating him not to engage with Alderman  Traffick  and representing that it would be their utter ruin  if they did  that they should never get any WOOLL to go on with their Manufactures and without which it was impossible for them to carry on their  Trade They knew  they said  that Alderman  Traffick  and his Partner  Harry Woollpack  were utter Enemies to them and to their Employment and would Effectually put a stop to their having any Wooll from  GreatBritain  or  Ireland  without which they should be all undone whereas those People who had managed the Trade in  GreatBritain  formerly were very easie in that Affair and at least were slack in preventing the Exportation of their Wooll so that they could get over whatever Quantity they had occasion for  They farther represented to him that if he went on with this Partnership it would bring in such a prodigious Quantity of  Woollen Manufactures  from  England  upon them and that so much better than any they could make at home that no one would buy their Goods made in  France  As to the high Duties which they were informed he would take off they represented that the  English  Manufactures would not only be better than theirs but would thereby be  cheaper also  for that notwithstanding their People worked as cheap and fared as hard as any People in the World yet they were but young and unexperienced in the Trade  and had not the Arts of doing every thing so at first hand as the  English  Nor had they Materials as the  English  had but at very remote distances and upon much dearer Terms than the  English  had so that AS it had been impossible for them to set up their several Manufactures if it had not been for Count  Tariff  's breaking off his former Partnerships in  Britain  in the Years and by which the Markets were their own and they were admitted to sell at what Price they pleased SO it would be impossible for them to go on with any Success if he should renew his said Business and engage anew with the said  Traffick  and  Woollpack  who were sworn Enemies to their Trade  These Representations however importunate and made by vast Numbers of the said  Count  's Tenants and Servants yet could not prevail with the  Count  at all especially when Alderman  Traffick  's  Landlady  interposed her good Offices to have the Partnership agreed on  so that  as you have heard the Affair went on successfully and the Partnership was concluded only that it wanted some Ratifications to make the same EFFECTUAL among  Harry Woollpack  's Friends and others as has been shewn  The poor Manufacturers being thus repulsed were driven even to Despair and had no remedy but Prayers and Tears for they are not such noisie Fellows as our Sir  Pol  and old  Scheme  brought along with them to the Parliament They dare not come up with their Mob at their heels and interrupt the Assembly and Parliaments of their Country with their Clamours and Cries of  no Tariff  no  Tariff  no  English Partnership  and the like but seeing the same like to go on they sat down with a profound Submission to their  Landlord  but at the same time crying universally to one another that they were all undone and their Trade ruined  As their Grief was inexpressible at the prospect of the opening of the  English  Commerce into  France  so when they understood how things were like to go in  England  they began to revive in their Hopes and having their trusty Agents in the Club in self at  London  by whom they had Intelligence every Post how things went on those Agents did not fail to push forwards Sir  Pol  and the  Club  to insult Count  Tariff  as much as possible and in order to this they scattered about private Papers signifying that Count  Tariff  had little or  no Influence on the Woollen Manufactures in his own Country that they were now come to that Perfection that they valued  no English  Manufactures  at all  but made them better at home and were able not only to supply themselves but all the World and even  Britain  it self  These were the Men that put it into Sir  Pol  's Head to impose a distracted Notion upon the Club  viz  That there was a Project set up in  France  to make Woollen Manufactures without WOOLL at all and thus they help'd blow the Coals up in the Club against Count  Tariff  when at the same time they in  France  were in the utmost Consternation for fear his Articles with Alderman  Traffick  should be made EFFECTUAL  But it is impossible to express the Joy of the poor People all over the aforesaid Provinces where the Woollen Manufactures are made when their Agents in the Club wrote them the following Letter which being written in  French  we thought fit to Translate for the benefit of the Publick  Messieurs  WE do our selves the Honour to acquaint you that we are just now returned from the Assembly of Estates of this Country where the Case of Count  Tariff  and his new Partnership was brought to a Tryal we have been assisting in the Club of the CityMalecontents  and others  in raising an hideous outcry in the Streets and outer Courts of the Parliament where we met with a great Number of their Canaille to say  no Tariff no Tariff  which has had the desired Success for the Court has refused to make the said Partnership EFFECTUAL and have put off the Cause till the next Meeting So  Messieurs  you are secure of enjoying your Manufactures for one whole Year longer and that you may carry them on the more successfully we have according to your Order bought you a large parcel of fine Wooll to be ready as usual when your Boats shall come for it which with what we formerly Shipp'd off from  Ireland  will be of great Service to you  Your most Obedient Servants  c  P S The Club are very well satisfied that you should have what Wooll can be conveyed away tho'  Traffick  and  Woollpack  had Proposals ready for the preventing it if their Partnership had gone forward  London  August  This News occasioned such a Universal Joy thro' all that Country that nothing could exceed it except the Extravancies of the Club and their Agents in  Britain  tho' History has not yet let us know how their Friends reconciled it to Reason that both the  French  could rejoyce and they also upon the same Occasion perhaps Time may assist us to unfold the Mystery  FINIS
