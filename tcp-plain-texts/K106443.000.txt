 POEMS TO THESPIA  Oh true Name of Love  Tender Affection Genuine Source of bliss  Immaculate and pure The transient blaze  Of passion soon subsides thy steadier fire  Time but increases Soft coercive Band  Connecting Souls without thee what is Life  Sweet Halcyon of the breast whose summer wing  Lulls each tempestuous care To thee the Wise  The Good still sacrifice the Soul refined  From vulgar dross Nor any but the Dull  Whom Nature niggard of her bounty cast  In narrow mould or whom with iron hand  Tyrannic Custom rules despise thy sway  EXETER  PRINTED BY W GRIGG BOOKSELLER IN THE  ForeStreet    SCorning with studied art to drag along  The doubled epithet of monstrous length  Join in the jingling of th' affected song  Court feeble melody and banish strength  No labour'd no fictitious strains I bring  But unreserved pour forth my honest heart  Nature and true Affection bade me sing  I felt the wound of no pretended dart  Oh may my pen fall from my palsied hand  When I survive to real taste a Pest  Or place in nice array with Orders' wand  The hasty ebullitions of my breast  My theme is chosen 'mid the British Fair  No antique Bards for lovethoughts I explore  No fabled Gods from Greece and Rome I bear  No Nymphs or Dryads from the Classic shore  Such ornaments may please the shallow mind  Exotic gewgaws twisted into rhime  But Elegance delights in chaplet twined  By Nature's hand and inmates of the Clime  Nor here hath Love disdain'd his gifts to shed  The feeling Soul is not unfrequent here  And genuine Rapture by the Graces led  Oft tunes the lyre

streaks which deck the sky  The widestretch'd plain and mountain high  But when the Sun unveils his face  The Landscape glows with heighten'd grace  Should raging Tempests Heaven deform  If final Victor of the Storm  The same illustrious Lord of day  Full blazes with triumphant ray  All Nature owns his influence bright  And bends before the glorious light  Nursed by his warmth the latent grain  With future harvests gilds the plain  His power pervades the deeper Mine  And moulds the Embryo Gem to shine  See Youth exulting in his May  What newborn joys before Him play  His sprightly feet expatiate round  And all He sees is Fairy ground  When Love unfolds his pinions nigh  And wafts his Soul to extasy  Say that Adversity should bring  Her livid plagues her Scorpion sting  And the collected venom dart  Remorseless on the Human heart  Love soothes to rest it's fiercest pain  And gives it vital strength again  Each softer energy refined  He kindles in the darken'd Mind  And from their hidden seat calls forth  The zealous deeds of generous Worth  Thou pure Enlightener of the breast  Oh shine thro' all my life confest  Nor cease thy gentler warmth to shed  In latest Evening on my head  There let thy beams still ling'ring fall  Till Fate's black gloom incloses All  II  THE truest Love is most reserved and shy  No look of confidence or boldness wears  Known by the humble brow and soften'd eye  And full of wavering doubts and anxious fears  When I perceived that THESPIA had o'ercome  My yielding heart and fix'd her empire there  That from her voice I must receive my doom  And all my future weal must flow from her  How did my bosom fluctuate with the pain  Of native bashfulness and strong desire  What varying conflicts did I not sustain  How struggled soft respect with passion's fire  Oft did I wish the secret to have told  But awe witheld and modest dread prevail'd  Her presence all my faculties controul'd  And every settled resolution fail'd  At length with firm intent I sought the Fair  With firm intent to pour out all my heart  At once display the story of my care  And the long misery of consuming smart  To a sequester'd grove her steps I drew  She without guile went innocently free  No ill suspecting for no ill she knew  Nor fear'd to trust herself alone with me  At first my usual converse I assay'd  Hoping from thence to gain a tranquil air  And as along the winding paths We stray'd  With frequent blossoms deck'd her flowing hair  But still my shorten'd breath fast went and came  O'er my embarrass'd limbs a stiffness hung  My heart throbb'd strong and shook my labouring frame  And fears I know not how unnerved my tongue  Resolved to speak some secret power restrain'd  Ashamed and angry with myself I grew  With crimson consciousness my cheeks were stain'd  And quick again the conscious stains withdrew  She whether unobservant all the while  Or else this strange confusion to relieve  Talks with her wonted ease and careless smile  But brief and vague each answer which I give  Then changed my fickle will it's first design  Determined sudden on some future day  Then would I each perplexity untwine  And every ardent wish before her lay  A transient calm succeeded in my breast  Yet sure thought I they were not so conceal'd  But she th' emotions of my heart hath guess'd  She too may haply wish they were reveal'd  Tho' now my faultering tongue its aid denies  She must have read the language of my soul  Nor have I mark'd displeasure in her eyes  When forth from mine the glance of love hath stole  Then turning round in haste as if afraid  Lest Diffidence again might intervene  Not daring to erect my timid head  My hesitating lips disclosed my pain  III  IN nothing was I learn'd but only how  To pen my flocks and drive them to the field  In the strait furrow to direct my plough  And when my hoe and pruninghook to wield  Uncultivated was my mind and mean  My abject thoughts low fasten'd to the earth  Till Love with hand benign brake Custom's chain  And bade me soar beyond my humble birth  With beauty fired I look'd around and saw  The charms of nature never seen before  O Love a willing Vassal to thy law  I bend I feel thy blessings and adore  Prompted by thee as yet with trembling tongue  I call'd the Muses and desired their aid  My woodnotes in the hazel copse I sung  And caught th' attention of the listening Maid  She listen'd to my strains She heard my tale  While deepening blushes o'er her cheeks arise  The soft consenting sigh my lips inhale  I see the yielding languor of her eyes  No witness Truth if ever I estrange  This grateful heart which only beats for thee  Why utter needless vows I cannot change  Fix'd are my bonds nor will I e'er be free  Fix'd is thy gentle sway by thee my Mind  Avarice and all its sordid acts disdains  The common vice of Passion unrefined  The common vice among our country Swains  Hence stinging cares hence groveling they behold  The state of riches with an envious eye  They think not aught beyond the power of gold  Nor know how Love can lift the soul on high  Oh come my Fair One I have thatch'd above  And whiten'd all around my little cot  Shorn are the hedges leading to the grove  Nor is the seat and willow bower forgot  Low is the path of life in which I move  Yet wilt thou not regret the higher sphere  Of wealth and noisy pride while faithful Love  And Innocence and sweet Content are here  IV  AH whence my Thespia can that anguish flow  That silent anguish of expressive woe  That sigh which from thy struggling bosom stole  That look which pierces to my inmost soul  Ah say my Thespia I conjure thee say  To me the hidden cause unblamed display  Half of thyself I claim my lawful share  Yet would to Heaven that I the whole might bear  Unveil thy thoughts in confidence to me  And trust a bosom fraught with sympathy  From thee would I my labouring heart confine  And are not all its deepest secrets thine  Wretch that I am am I who thee from pain  To shield would pour out life at every vein  Am I the cause and could'st Thou ever spy  A look of coldness glancing from my eye  To thee a cold blank look Oh too refined  And subtile error of thy feeling mind  A delicacy apt too deep to dive  To each nice touch too tenderly alive  Tho' I esteem it as a blessing sent  As the more polish'd Minds' chief ornament  A sacred spark kindled by Heaven's own ray  Yet let not Sensibility betray  Thou weep'st where did my tongue profanely rove  How could I blame thee 'twas excess of love  Oh let me circle thee with strict embrace  Warm breast to breast and glowing face to face  My fixed lips while speechless rapture ties  Imbibe the lucid moisture of thine eyes  Thy melting spirit in each breath inhale  Gaze on thee till the nerves of vision fail  And quite o'erpower'd by Love's imperious sway  Feel all my fainting soul dissolve away  V  STILL blooming Health thy modest graces shed  O'er the clear surface of my Thespia's cheek  There let thy fresh thy glowing tints be spread  Thy smiles enlightening and complacence meek  Protect her where she goes ye gentle Powers  Pure Denizons of undulating air  Whether from fervid Noontide's sultry hours  Or Evening's dewy shades protect the Fair  'Tis true my Thespia I indeed confess  That selfish are the prayers and vows I pay  With no disinterested voice I bless  The Gods or pour the supplicating lay  For ah from thee and from thy looks I find  Warm to my heart each cordial joy must flow  Sweetening the ills of life from thee my mind  Must taste it's keenest sense of piercing woe  Thine is the masterkey each spring to rule  Each hidden movement of my secret thought  Sure thou wert bred in some Enchanter's school  Who all his spells and mystic charms hath taught  Yet then would Holy Truth with thee reside  Truth which unbounded confidence my trust  Yet then would mean Deceit fly far aside  And wild Caprice confounding false and just  Would'st Thou have said as I struck dumb with fear  Tremblingly pointed out my humble bower  Haply Tranquility and Peace are there  For them I scorn the gaudy farce of Power  O Thou Sincerest how shall I repay  The endless debt of gratitude I owe  Quickly my Fair point out to Me the way  And shew the path for Thou alone canst shew  Tho' silent is thy tongue thy speaking eye  The modest blushes o'er thy cheeks which rove  That deepdrawn breath that panting breast reply  The sole return is tenderness and love  Will this suffice and dost Thou ask no more  What the spontaneous feelings needs must give  Oh let Me lavish on thee all my store  Nor cease to love thee till I cease to live  For ever rivetted within my heart  Thy dear unsullied image shall remain  When from that seat I bid it to depart  May I by some tremendous stroke be slain  No common death I shall deserve to die  To pine by inches on a barren strand  Scorch'd by the vengeful Sun's severest eye  Nor by one sportive wandering Zephyr fann'd  To freeze on some bleak rock to glut the rage  Of howling beasts within the dreary waste  Or live in youth despised in helpless age  The extremities of want and woe to taste  To walk a moving plague among Mankind  Shunn'd hated and refused the alms I crave  Refused Despair's last only wish to find  A still retirement in the peaceful grave  In that fond hope to be deceived to hear  With soul yet conscious in the churchyard way  The fierce invective cast upon my bier  And scornful Laughter dancing o'er my clay  All this and more I shall deserve to prove  When led by changeful Fancy's wanton eye  I turn a faithless Truant to thy love  And on the wings of vagrant Falshood fly  VI  SHALL the fair Form of smiling Love no more  Sport o'er the lawn with Freedom by his side  Diffusing blessings from his ample store  On the fond Bridegroom and the happy Bride  Who led by choice and inclination's fire  Breathing delicious sympathy of soul  To the thick shady nuptial bower retire  Attempering rapture warm with chaste controul  For such of yore to grace their marriage day  The flocks exulting danced with nimbler tread  The tribes aerial tuned their softest lay  And earth's green lap with fresher flowers was spread  Then were the laws of Avarice held in scorn  Now unopposed and absolute her reign  If haply Two with nobler souls are born  The gloomy clouds of malice intervene  O Error fond to think that wealth bestows  Our only bliss Say blushing Grandeur say  Whether thy breast that heartfelt pleasure knows  Which gilds the shade of life's sequester'd way  Say in the morning dost Thou cheerlier rise  Or were thy slumbers sweeter in the night  Doth Nature's noontide lustre strike thine eyes  Or evening's milder beam with more delight  Art thou not tortured with desire of fame  Smarts not thy soul with Envy's secret goad  And do not conscious honour generous shame  And tender Love fly thy unblest abode  Ye purest Virtues wheresoe'er I rove  And Thou lastnamed most valued of the three  Whom language fails to praise Celestial Love  Ne'er shall your laws be unobserved by me  And wilt not Thou my Thespia own their power  Shall not their guardian care on thee attend  And teach thee in reflection's silent hour  To cast a thought upon thy more than Friend  On Him whose heart with truest ardour beats  Whose zeal nor time nor absence shall assuage  Blooming unsullied by youth's scorching heats  And undecaying in the frost of age  Lasting as life For not the vagrant beams  Of wanton Fancy raised a sudden fire  No spark of passion whose extatic dreams  Vivid and gay in quick disgust expire  Not that with cool and philosophic eye  Not that with unenraptured mind I view  Beauty's alluring grace her vermeil die  Her winning smiles and loveinspiring hue  But bearing Friendship's unsuspected seal  Into thy presence frequently I stole  Young artless Innocence removed the veil  And shew'd in all it's charms thy spotless soul  I gazed Enamour'd every Virtue bright  In that pure temple each Ethereal Form  Stood visible before my mental sight  And my breast throbb'd with holy transport warm  Can I the shrine forsake while constant Truth  While filial Piety's engaging deed  Goodnature loveliest crown of smiling youth  And Pity meek forbid Me to recede  What feelings then can tempt Me to betray  The rights of Love what interest not my own  For Thou to Me art Fortune's prosperous ray  From thee exiled how dreadful is her frown  The Mind which claims our passions to controul  Why is it not allknowing and allwise  To pierce the deep recesses of the soul  And see the bounds where sense and errors lies  Then would not Beauty e'er be sold and bought  From thy embrace I should not then be torn  Condemn'd should'st Thoubut Treason's in that thought  To curse the fatal hour when I was born  No far be pale Suspicion I detest  The haggard Fiend Hush'd then be every fear  My hopes I treasure up within thy breast  And Oh I charge thee keep them sacred there  VII  YES far my Gentle Maid from thee  And every haunt of Joy I stray  Shall not thy wishes go with me  To cheer my faint and lonely way  Shall not within thy faithful breast  Remembrance it's sweet blossoms bear  Shall not it's plant by thee carest  Take root and bloom unfaded there  Wilt Thou not often steal unseen  Through dewy field and trackless plain  Or utter to the copses green  Thy soft and melancholy strain  Tho' Fate hath torn the bond of Love  Wilt Thou not often cast thine eye  To where expell'd and sad I rove  And breathe a tender pitying sigh  Be witness conscious Heaven my soul  Shall ne'er a thought of thee resign  No power it's fervour can controul  Unchanged and stamp'd for ever shine  Yet tho' by mutual Faith assured  What racking torment thus to part  What bleeding woe must be endured  What anguish must distract the heart  VIII  WAS it a dignity of shape an eye  Or face instinct with beauty's dazzling ray  Whose power at once bade vanquish'd reason fly  And swiftly stole Me from Myself away  Had that been all tho' strong had been my grief  Not to have won the object of my care  Time would with lenient hand have brought relief  The cure Another equally as Fair  But tho' a thousand now I should behold  And own them fairer than the Maid I love  My heart to all their beauties would be cold  No charms my former passion could remove  For youthful Prepossession knit the tye  Which our consenting hearts together drew  With years the pleasing partiality  And soft attractive impulse firmer grew  Fancy meantime unnumber'd visions spread  In which no seas were rough no tempests lour'd  We saw our hopes with extasy We fed  And in each other's bosom fondly pour'd  And can I with these loved ideas part  Can I this dear dear sympathy forego  First from their place the strings of life shall start  And the warm ruddy drops forget to flow  Of thee bereftOh 'twere the worst of ills  Deep penetrates the thought with sore annoy  My shuddering heart my inmost soul it chills  And blasts each future scene of rising joy  Of thee bereftIt shall not cannot be  Spite of the wayward accidents of life  Yet once again our actions shall be free  And Oh my Love O dearer name my Wife  Again shall I infold thee in my arms  And breathe my soul into thy faithful breast  The o'erpast evil with fresh transport warms  The pangs of absence make Us doubly blest  IX  I Was not form'd for glory's arduous ways  The hidden depths of science to explain  To cloathe me in ambition's golden rays  Or combat death and tread the carnaged plain  In the broad open face of public life  To some Heaven gives conspicuously to move  Enamour'd of the scenes of noise and strife  To Me a mind all indolence and love  Unhappiness and care to Kings I give  Exposed they stand to every stormy gale  On yonder hill's green side secure I live  Or walk with vacant step along the dale  Enough for Me to meet my Thespia there  Arm lock'd in arm along the wood to roam  Lost but to Love to stray we know not where  And wonder how we got so far from home  For her the hedgeflower garland to intwine  At her command invoke the artless Muse  Press close her chaste her glowing cheek to mine  Or on her breast all my whole soul effuse  My thoughts to more extatic pleasures rise  Here sacred Wedlock bring thy closest veil  And from the busy ken of prying eyes  Thy holy rites and mysteries conceal  Such were the strains which in the jocund prime  Of life when Fancy takes delight to dream  I sung nor spent a thought on future time  Where rural Alphin winds his scanty stream  I sung each object struck Me with delight  The edying rivulet the newshorn flock  The meads with flowers of various hue bedight  The verdant hillock and the barren rock  Yet tho'by kindest Nature form'd to stray  The sweet oblivious path of life along  Fate's tyrant voice and unrelenting sway  Impells the Novice mid the bustling throng  I go yet once more let me cast my eyes  On you ye wellknown scenes a parting view  Tho' I with fondest estimation prize  Your longfrequented haunts for aye adieu  But Oh my Thespiathere th' imperfect sound  Hangs unpronounced upon my trembling tongue  Cold damps of dewy sweat my brow surround  And every nerve and sinew is unstrung  Once more receive Me to thy panting breast  Would I could rivet Me forever there  Such agonies no language e'er express'd  Death cannot bring a torture so severe  X  WHAT have I done what crime in me is found  What secret evil lurking in my breast  That while all Nature else is smiling round  Heaven hath on Me it's heaviest stroke impress'd  Have I e'er dropp'd a wish of Other's harm  Or done an ill tho' ne'er to be reveal'd  Have I not always breathed th' emotion warm  On the chaste lip of social Virtue seal'd  Ah is it not enough that far away  From my own native happy fields I rove  Far from each friendly name condemn'd to stray  And torn by cruel force from her I love  But must thro' her the barbed steel be sent  Which piercing with severest torture wounds  Shall She I love convey the punishment  Which Justice must confess exceeds its bounds  On Me rain all your woes Ye righteous Powers  Tho' hard I'll strive the misery to bear  View sickness steal away my lingering hours  On tainted wing nor drop a pining tear  But ah the gentle Virgin's tender Frame  O Brighthair'd Chastity O Angel Truth  If ye are aught beyond an empty name  Save save in pity Innocence and youth  Shield shield Me from the racking thought I spy  From her cold cheek the bland suffusion fled  Dead is the piercing magic of her eye  The lustredarting beam of sense is dead  She calls on meOh snatch the last embrace  Woods rivers mountains countries intervene  Oh curse of curses ne'er that lovely face  Again shall I behold e'en the last scene  Some dreary satisfaction might afford  Some solace to the madness of Despair  Gloating in secret on his gloomy hoard  With eye intorted viewing what is there  XI  AH can they be of gentle Woman born  Are they not rather cast in iron mould  Who love as if it were a weakness scorn  And place their sum of happiness in gold  Who nothing of that sweet alliance know  That tender union of connected hearts  Whence only transports unalloy'd can flow  Transports which brave affliction's venom'd darts  O genuine Offspring of the native soul  As yet unfashion'd by the hand of Vice  Ye thoughts which point the way to Honour's goal  Ye thoughts whence every Virtue takes its rise  Ye warm Inspirers of the breast of Youth  Ye Handmaids which compose the smiling train  Of Innocence and unsuspecting Truth  Say were ye form'd so wond'rous fair in vain  Did Nature plant you in the human Mind  That Tyrant Art might thence her work displace  That your free limbs might be in chains confined  That harden'd Interest might your charms deface  Ah no far otherwise her equal law  And kind maternal tenderness decreed  She will'd her infant scyons there to grow  To bloom and ripen into golden seed  Hence gave She all that more than Eloquence  Which speaks in Virgin Beauty's bashful eye  Hence left the soul of Youth without defence  Glowing with warm susceptibility  Hence panting wishes undissembled fears  Her ardent Votaries felt hence fancy wild  And love sincere and vows unfeign'd were theirs  And Awe shrunk back and Hope the Cherub smiled  O Thespia We these ardent Votaries were  Have I not fix'd my fainting sight on thee  Till trickling down my cheek the emphatic tear  Hath in mute language told my extasy  While from thy conscious but more timid eye  The downcast rays thy secret flame confess'd  While the quickvarying blush and struggling sigh  Disclosed the pure emotions of thy breast  How roves the Vagrant Mind to future days  How credulous is Love with magic wand  What visions cannot soothing error raise  How thick around the selfdelusions stand  Duped by their flattery Nature's just design  We saw with Us to it's perfection brought  Saw each acceding year more firmly twine  The mental wreathe our younger Fancies wrought  They painted to our view the lowly Cot  Where Neatness bland with meek Contentment play'd  Look'd up to Heaven and bless'd their tranquil lot  Nor envied Guilt in glaring pride array'd  With treacherous smile the farm retired they shew'd  It's verdant meads it's fields and sylvan bowers  The grazing lambs the waving corn the wood  Of tufted elm and garden deck'd with flowers  Obscure the scenes their pleasing pencil drew  Obscure but blest with unaffected joy  We hated mad Ambition's noisy crew  Convinced that love with reason could not cloy  Our rural Neighbours to the friendly feast  We bid their simple hearts intent to gain  Where Pride inspires not the fastidious breast  Envy will seek to wound it's peace in vain  False tho' enchanting prospects yet no fault  No crime of our's hath rendered them Untrue  But hide the causeCheck every murmuring thought  To Virtue this sad sacrifice is due  Yet let me curse stern Avarice odious Fiend  Let Me lament th' unhappiest of their kind  All other passions dead compell'd to bend  Beneath this last slow fever of the Mind  Rather than feel this dire distemper's sway  Than with this thirst be scorch'd in life's decline  May I ne'er see again the cheerful day  Fo ever doom'd to labour in the Mine  May every terror fate reserves in store  For wretched Man assault this drooping head  May Want may Famine enter at my door  May Pain and restless care surround my bed  Or should My Thespia all our trials past  Should We before the sacred altar stand  May Heaven in mercy with the lightning's blast  Strike Me at once and tear the destined band  XII  WHY was I born in this more polish'd clime  Amid the scenes of artificial Life  Where Custom rules longsanctified by Time  And Fashion holds with Nature endless strife  A thousand Wants start up a thousand Fears  To shackle Love or interrupt his course  He struggles yet the galling burthen bears  Sighs with regret but owns their Sovereign force  Eager to follow where th' Emotions lead  Hides every wish by violence supprest  Gazes with ardour on the blooming Maid  But dreads the future anguish of her breast  Our liberty We boast on Britain's shore  Yet Slaves to Gold it's tyrant power obey  Our Vices spring from it's creative ore  And e'en our Virtues feel it's quickening ray  Perils and crimes We scruple not to dare  Or act the meanest part intent on gold  Yet may the soul refused it's gifts to share  With conscious pride sublimer traits unfold  Hence generous Youth with riches unendow'd  The Mistress of his bosom scorns to gain  Grief may advance Affliction threaten loud  Firm He supports th' accumulated pain  Happy the freeborn Hunters of the wild  Their only art how best to urge the chace  No thoughts of wealth their passions e'er beguiled  No rank they claim for equal is the Race  They suffer not the torments of desire  They are not doom'd to pour the fruitless tear  To combat with the strong the tender fire  And pine from month to month from year to year  Happy the Natives of more southern skies  With softer manners softer forms endued  Where all around spontaneous harvests rise  Where from each tree depends ambrosial food  Of cruel bonds they utter no complaint  The gentle Virgin hears his amorous tale  Smiles on her favour'd Youth without restraint  And crowns his wishes in the spicy vale  Just are thy words my Thespiawhat delight  Could passive brutal Ignorance impart  Disgust at once would rise before my sight  My heart would loathe th' unsympathising heart  Nor could I to the joys of sense resign'd  The sportive Wanton to my bosom press  Forget the pure desire the will refined  Th' exalted sentiment and chaste caress  A single glance from Virtue's melting eye  The soul with more extatic pleasure warms  A blush of Innocence one pitying sigh  Transcends all Luxury's prostituted charms  Still let us cherish hope whate'er befalls  And see where Reason Wisdom take their stand  Drive the fierce passions from their hallow'd walls  And lead Cherubic Patience by the hand  Say that entangled in the social chain  Wants fears and griefs intrude a numerous crew  Tho' more dilated flows the stream of pain  The source of pleasure is augmented too  Just are thy wordsBut when the present Ill  Afflicts this curious web We idly twine  Nature and Passion are victorious still  O'erwhelm'd is my philosophy and thine  XIII  DEAR Anxious Maid whose apprehensive love  Hath form'd of tender fears a numerous train  These looks of fond solicitude remove  Fled is the gloomy progeny of Pain  Fled is each sullen image from my mind  O'er its corporeal yokemate brooding dull  The thoughts of thee alone are left behind  Of thee in every part my soul is full  Warm to my breast the vital spirits flow  Kindle anew each strong affection there  The mutual ardour corresponding glow  And grateful tumult which I scarce can bear  Such as I feel when from thy speaking eye  Dart unrestrain'd the beams of melting love  While meek Sincerity stands smiling by  And Innocence displays her wings above  Such as I feel when to Myself I vow  The sacred trust inviolably sure  Guarded by steady Faith which scorns to bow  Whose ties the purest energies secure  Reserve and distant coyness tutor'd arts  Let these be goads to vitiated desire  Nature's true colours charm untainted hearts  Love begets love creates and feeds the fire  Ambition's Sons who climb her airy way  What feelings can you boast compared with mine  On you Content ne'er shed her tranquil ray  Tho' in th' external glare of pomp You shine  This eve more real joy my breast inspired  Than you can in a thousand ages know  Joy which reflection can behold untired  Amid whose blooms no thorns of anguish grow  Thou too reflect unblamed my darling Fair  And pleasure in thy generous heart be found  Thy confidence meets confidence sincere  Thy truth with undissembled truth is crown'd  This night may Sleep unfold his gentlest wing  The softest plume upon thy eyelids lay  Delightful be thy dreams as laughing Spring  Enchanting as the firstborn gales of May  Ye level Meads ye winding Streams be seen  Your fringed sides with bending osiers graced  Let Us exulting tread your margin green  Mix the warm sigh embrace and be embraced  Impart the secret dictates of our soul  The wish the passion unreserved and free  Conscious that equal choice can ne'er controul  That perfect love is perfect liberty  XIV  IT is not strange that in my Thespia's eye  Amaze and anger should appear when told  That gentle Doris had without a sigh  Resign'd her charms to Age for worthless gold  In all her features Delicacy reign'd  What bright transparent tints her cheeks o'erspread  The snow beneath as it that veil disdain'd  With softest swell seem'd vanquishing the red  Mild were her glances as the ray of Eve  When the Lark sits and meditates his flight  Her voice might Anguish of it's sting bereave  Or smoothe like Philomel the frowns of Night  Her sentiments proclaim'd a spotless heart  Where dwelt the nicest sense of praise and shame  Nature's Disciple undisguised by Art  She seem'd as born for Love's and Friendship's flame  No wonder Thou My Thespia should'st the tale  Astonisht hear more skill'd in Humankind  Versed in their failings I myself turned pale  Such youth such beauty such deceit to find  Thou see'st how Avarice may her serpent face  Amid the flowers of female sweetness hide  How thinking We behold each female grace  We view the complicated mask of pride  Hapless who thus around Love's soaring wing  Can bind the glittering ignominious chain  Stop Nature's current taint her limpid spring  And prostitute thro' choice their souls for gain  On these Who boast a Woman's form alone  Let not my Thespia waste a single thought  Her's be the robe of Honour Virtue's zone  And fame and generous love and charms unbought  Should Youth the most adorn'd with wealth combine  My soul at ease would not a Rival dread  For constancy hath fix'd with rosy twine  The neverfading chaplet on her head  Should Fate a decent competence supply  Redundant treasure would Her be given  Should It while Love was granted that deny  For it's best gift her thanks would rise to Heaven  The Mean My Fair and Abject of thy sex  Yield not the faintest light to judge of Thee  My settled faith no jarring doubts perplex  Thy hopes thy fears are center'd all in Me  E'en beneath Poverty's incumbent load  Our hearts would glow with unextinguish'd fire  While We together trod th' uneven road  A groan would not be heard a sigh transpire  Should I be doom'd Another's flock to tend  Without regret the change  I see  thee bear  To Duty's humblest step serene descend  My love the full reward of every care  With what reluctance at the break of day  Bid We adieu How oft reverts my sight  How do We chide the tardy Sun's delay  And with what rapture hail the approach of night  While Temperance pleased surveys our homely fare  Our slender beverage while Content supplies  Let festive Luxury cull her viands rare  Grateful We sit and uninvidious rise  Then e'er with fondness We retire to rest  Conversing bland Life's mingled scenes We view  From these Delight gaybeaming warms our breast  And those impearl our cheeks with Pity's dew  Or not forsaken by the tuneful Nine  With sweetest descant I the Time beguile  Mark how my Thespia's eyes with transport shine  Nor covet aught but her approving smile  The rural Matron and the greyhair'd Sire  Devoutly wish their Children's lot the same  Thy prudence meekness neatness of attire  My industry and love their precepts frame  Oh Thespia not the wealth of Worlds could buy  From thee a link of our soulbracing chain  And should Affliction should Misfortune try  To break it's union they would strive in vain  Thou know'st to value Love how incomplete  Without his aid how small is Pleasure's store  Without his aid how wretched are the Great  Favour'd by Him what joys may bless the Poor  XV  HENCE rash Belief may thy wild thoughts again  Ne'er thro' the cells of busy fancy rove  Oblivion snatch their memory from my brain  Nor leave a thought injurious to my Love  But ever thus in your most pleasing dress  Ye dear Ideas croud upon my soul  There each rejoicing avenue possess  And fill with extasy the vital goal  Place her as now before my mental eye  The sweet unrivall'd spotless tender Fair  Pure as the fleecy whiteness of the sky  Gentle as breezes mild of Vernal air  Can'st Thou not guess what torments seized my heart  For each soft passion nicer sense is thine  How thro' each nerve swift ran the venom'd smart  When my eyes glanced along the dubious line  Not for the Eastern Tyrant's gorgeous robe  For all the slaves that at his feet have knelt  Not for the wealth of all this ample globe  Would I e'er feel again what then I felt  Reflection was o'erwhelm'd It's power was lost  Upon my brow a cold damp vapour hung  My brain a thousand vague ideas cross'd  Made by heart sick and chain'd my palsied tongue  Striving to read my eyes their task refused  Again I strove and forced their straining gaze  I thoughtyet could not think I was abused  I wish'dbut all was darkness and amaze  Then all that I had read or heard or knew  Of Women's guile and how with arts they blind  Unguarded Man to true love most Untrue  Rush'd headlong in and harrow'd up my Mind  Can I this want of confidence forgive  To Me who would for her thro' sultry climes  Thro' frozen seas have pass'd not whilest I live  'Tis treason perfidy the worst of crimes  To cast a shade o'er infamy of vice  The bosom friend to fix the mutual seal  Surely Herself will ne'er be overnice  Who could Another's shame so well conceal  Why did She beg the Paper from my hand  But that it proves her conduct base and light  With trembling earnestness behind Me stand  Then haste away to shun my piercing sight  It cannot besome cursed Mistake is here  Yet still  that Woman  's life confirms the deed  Why doubt too true alas the grounds of fear  If true my wounded heart must ever bleed  These a few thoughts from out the many were  Which thro' my mind with fervid motion roll'd  Disorder contradiction dread was there  And hope quick yielding to suspicion bold  Lo I approach thy presenceWhile my knees  Can scarce support their tottering weight along  My cheeks now glow now on a sudden freeze  Now pauses my weak heart now vibrates strong  Thy hand I press'd but did not as before  Feel thrilling pleasure harmonize my frame  That magic touch alas prevailed no more  Emotions rose which now I blush to name  Then first with illdissembled tenderness  I wrapp'd thy soft confusion in my arms  No accents were prepared thy ears to bless  My soul was firmly closed against thy charms  Yet did I pity thee Yes witness Heaven  Compassion view'd thee tho' I could not love  I saw thee from my bleeding bosom riven  And sunk below Me while I soar'd above  Yes I look'd down with pity on thy state  As on a Cherub whom I once admired  I loved thee not and yet I could not hate  Mourn'd thee guiltspotted but no more desired  With hesitation my reproach began  What rapturous pleasure did thy answer bear  Superior joy ne'er bathed the soul of Man  From the pure stream of bliss and fount sincere  Ah Fool who would not rather have divined  Likeness of namesCould I with mean disgrace  Thus taint that inborn rectitude of Mind  Disclosed in each bright feature of thy face  Could I thus stamp with guilt sensations sprung  From thought most delicate which shrinks afraid  From the rude breath of censure from the tongue  Ungenerous daring without cause upbraid  Oh for the honour of thy Sex and thee  Still be it mine my darling Fair to err  Ne'er may thy gentle graces veil to Me  Be innocence thy genuine character  But be it thine to pardon to display  Thy meekness frankness so shall ardent love  Tho' dimm'd awhile shine with intenser ray  And even time it's steadier warmth improve  XVI  O My soul's only Joy My promised Wife  For whom I breathe for whom the stream of life  Swift courses thro' my veins Thou generous Maid  By Truth and young Sincerity array'd  In unsuspecting honour Nobly free  Placing th' excess of confidence in Me  Who heedless of th' insipid prudish art  Own'st all the genuine dictates of thy heart  From Me no word no action shalt thou find  To soil thy innate loveliness of Mind  From Me thy innocence hath nought to fear  To Me be still unboundedly sincere  Still gaze on Me with love's complacent eye  Still give Me tear for tear and sigh for sigh  In my fond bosom hide thy blushing face  Be more than passive still to my embrace  Dearest of Women Oh without controul  Indulge these finest movements of the soul  My breast is not with vulgar passion fraught  I glory in my dignity of thought  Tis true I feel within the kindling fire  I feel the madd'ning anguish of desire  The agonizing joy the rapturous pain  Goads each idea of my swimming brain  Yet this tho' sympathising Thou appear  To faintness and to sickness can I bear  Nay e'en to death itself e'er Thou shalt see  A deed unworthy of Myself and Thee  XVII  HAppy the Few who in retirement find  Those sweet delights which shun tumultuous noise  Who feast on pleasures suited to their mind  And barter idle shew for solid joys  Far from the City and it's Revelers gay  To shades and bubbling springs Love takes his flight  He hates the scenes of their fantastic day  And longprotracted vigils of their night  In crouded Towns how rarely Virtue dwells  How seldom is the genuine Muse carest  They range th' untainted lawns and rural dells  Adorn the Maid or fire her Shepherd's breast  And are We doom'd to this abhorr'd abode  Forbid again to breathe serener air  To stray as erst along the secret road  Untrod by Vice by Vanity and Care  Here Avarice sits there bursting Reason's mound  Impertinence rolls on her giddy tide  With thoughtless mirth the lofty domes resound  The streets reflect the garish rays of pride  Should We a moment wish the din to cease  Would I my Thespia frame the soothing lay  Some worthless Visitors disturb our peace  And force th' alluring images away  Friendship their idle bosoms never graced  Not to it's finer voice their nerves are strung  Scandal and Folly regulate their taste  And prompt the quick vibrations of their tongue  Who bred in Cities view the lovely beam  Fresh darted from the Morn's expanding eye  Till noon the Fair indulge their slothful dream  Wake to complain and breathe the languid sigh  Th' important hours are then resign'd to dress  The fancied Form of Elegance is near  But She far other minds intent to bless  Seeks with Simplicity a different sphere  In trifling Parties Evening's ear is cloy'd  With mingled converse which no Sense can hit  Each theme exhausted cards supply the void  Poor particolour'd Emblems of their wit  Impell'd by Vanity they seek the dance  Their hair newmodell'd or their vesture new  With hearts unfeeling t'ward the Stage advance  To Pity deaf to Selflove only true  Or turn'd Enthusiasts Music's charms admire  How sweetly rapt on it's harmonious wings  Yet no delight it's tenderest notes inspire  Then pleased alone when straining Discord sings  With such as these will faithful Love remain  Whate'er the whispering Coxcomb may protest  Their forms their souls surveying with disdain  To Pomp and Avarice He resigns their breast  Loathing it's shape how shall I Vice describe  What terrors will it's hideous aspect raise  Thy Mind will shrink from her detested Tribe  Nor dare behold them painted in my lays  Here for th' unwary Craft inweaves his snares  Honour's just trophies Envy's force o'erturns  Seduction his enticing baits prepares  And with unhallow'd flames the Matron burns  Led by example all her charms displaced  By education tho' her will She hides  From fear from interest is the Virgin chaste  While thro' her veins the subtile poison glides  Intemperate Riot now his orgies holds  See abject Treachery e'en his Friend betray  The Flatterer here his base deceptions moulds  And there the nightly Robber prowls for prey  And must We ever with these Inmates dwell  Must we perforce these odious mansions choose  Can We ne'er break pernicious custom's spell  Oh Form'd for love for virtue and the Muse  Form'd with the warmest best sincerest heart  Form'd to perceive to act by Judgment's light  Form'd with the purest taste unsoil'd by art  To urge swift Fancy on or check her flight  No let Us vow when that auspicious hour  Expected long together joins our fate  To seek with Nature her congenial bower  Remote from envy tumult and debate  Or should our chains be too severely bound  That no contagious atoms may infest  With strictest watch to guard our doors around  And thus Inclosed escape the dangerous pest  Meanwhile O lightplumed Youth haste not away  Veil not th' enchanting ardour of thy face  Let thy eyes glistening dart the vivid ray  With transport speak and move with native grace  Ah much I fear e'er that auspicious hour  No more thy bloom softmantling will be seen  Fading as shrink before the Solar power  May's fragrant blossoms and her cheerful green  With thee must Joy must smiling Love retreat  Shall the quick stream which warms the heart be cold  Shall Sensibility desert her seat  And Fancy's radiant visions clouds infold  Shall Innocence no more her blush bestow  Tender Humanity the pitying sigh  No more enraptured shall the spirits flow  At Honour's call To Us shall Virtue die  Forbid it all Ye Powers whose bounteous hands  Our soulconnecting wreathe at first intwined  Let Us rejoin your unpolluted bands  And leave th' infected city far behind  Still still awhile retard the wings of Youth  Give Us Retirement's genuine bliss to share  Let mutual Faith Sincerity and Truth  The Blameless Muse and ardent Love be there  XVIII  WHO elevated by the sacred flame  Of Poesy sublime their Minds debase  Spotted with indecorous deeds of shame  And imitating Man's inferior race  How little They the Muse's Votary know  Who think his soul from constancy will swerve  While the pure current whence his Numbers flow  Each artery fills and strengthens every nerve  These truths my Thespia on thy memory seal  Are there who boast to join her chosen train  Fickle and wavering of affections frail  Pursuing joys fantastic light and vain  Who stoop to vaunting Pride Who covet gold  Who scorn the least of Honour's generous ties  Rude in their manners pert obtrusive bold  The Muse surveys them with indignant eyes  No warm originality is theirs  Genius retired or frown'd upon their birth  Mechanic Rhimesters to mechanic ears  The frigid groveling Progeny of earth  Idly They strive t' ascend the forked hill  It's arduous paths and rocks abrupt to climb  Forever at it's base tho' labouring still  Then swept unnoticed down the vale of time  Confiding in their oathsOh Luckless Fair  What woes what tortures follow close behind  Unprincipled their giddy bark they steer  It suits their native littleness of mind  Not thus on Whom the true Phoeboean ray  It's influence sheds his bosom glowing bright  Free are his numbers as the beams of day  Ardent and chaste as that celestial light  Should He amid the fervid hours of Youth  Be drawn by Pleasure's specious wiles aside  Soon he retreats led back by radiant Truth  Nor e'er forsakes again his bounteous Guide  To Fashion's mode He varies not his strain  Nature and Taste impart their liberal rules  No Flatterer He no Slave to sordid gain  And independent on the breath of Fools  For no peculiar day no age He sings  The time will come when Judgment shall prevail  For late Posterity He spreads his wings  And lives when marble monuments shall fail  Firmness and Dignity possess his soul  No wild caprice or trifles fond beguile  His steady course is bent t'ward Honour's goal  The Virtues praise Him and the Graces smile  How True to Fame How tenderly alive  To Pity's soft emotions How sincere  How vainly the tumultuous Passions strive  Toshake his breast They claim no empire there  No change he knows ne'er roves his devious eye  On Him the Virgin's heart it's faith reclines  He estimates a tear of Her's a sigh  Above Potosi's or Golconda's mines  Doth not on Him her every hope depend  Shall Love shall Innocence repent the trust  Can Rectitude it's deeds with Falsehood blend  Or can the Muse's Offspring be unjust  Haply their spurious Brood at strains like these  May scoff and Dissipation laugh aloud  But Nature allconsistent in her ways  With the Sun's essence mingles not a cloud  In the same breast She places not desires  Of adverse sort discriminating nice  Nor kindles strong Imagination's fires  In the cold head or lukewarm heart of Vice  XIX  FROM the first hour when I beheld the light  No time compared with this have I survey'd  No day e'er rose with lustre half so bright  No minutes shone in plumes so fair array'd  At length Adversity hath spent her store  Or with false aim her poison'd arrows fly  Our spirits long deprest again can soar  No tears but those of bliss shall wet our eye  O my Beloved this day shall ever stand  With Me the golden period of the year  This day good Fortune waved her potent wand  Dispersing all the mists of doubt and fear  Ne'er may they rise again our joys between  Ye unexpected ties propitious prove  Fairer and brighter still be every scene  Pourtray'd by tenderness illumed by love  XX  This Elegy is principally imitated from the first of Tibullus  LET Some heap wealth with neverceasing pain  Try every art and brave all ills for gain  Let Others toil in war whom glory charms  Their slumbers broken by the din of arms  Me neither emulous of pomp or praise  Choice to a life of indolence betrays  Nor small the pleasure which the Country yields  It's rills untainted and innoxious fields  Now from th' incircling weed the plant I free  Now shake the ripen'd Apple from the tree  My thriving nursery view or lands which bear  The frugal portion of the future year  In hope my sheaves arranged with skill survey  Or homeward borne and safely piled away  I blush not in my hardy palm to take  The sharpen'd sickle or collecting rake  To turn the furrow in the loosen'd plain  And throw with liberal hand the yellow grain  Or when unheeded by it's careless Dam  To foster by my fire a tender Lamb  This is the place where life with joy is spent  These are the haunts which cherish sweet Content  Oh when a vacant interspace I find  To tread the paths myself have taught to wind  Where the trim hedgerows neatly pleach'd around  Defend my farm and circumscribe it's bound  To break my fence and ramble void of car  Across the hills and dales I know not where  How struck with awe or pleasure should my eye  A blasted Oak unseen before espy  Or my ear catch the song of rustic Hind  Borne on the pinions of the breathing wind  Tho' slender are my means nor large my store  Yet not unhospitable is my door  Oft shall my honest Neighbours enter there  And own that tho' not rich I am sincere  There helpless Age shall gain some small supply  Nor lift in vain the supplicating eye  Oh may my fields the bursting torrent spare  Nor sweep away the produce of the year  Oh wholesome be the gales which o'er them blow  So shall my grazing flock no taintworm know  So shall my healthy Oxen draw the plough  My kine with welldistended udders low  Be to my humble prayer propitious Heaven  Nor thus make less the little Thou hast given  That little is enough with that I'm blest  And feel each wish abundantly possest  Yes 'tis enough what Luxury ne'er knows  Each eve I steep my limbs in calm repose  Should I awake how pleased to lye and hear  The raging winds without assail my ear  And should my Thespia at the tempest start  To strain the trembling Fair One to my heart  Or when the wintry rain descends in streams  Then to be buried in Elysian dreams  This be  my  lot let Him be rich for Me  Who dares the terrors of th' uncertain sea  The pointed rocks and hidden quicksands braves  And all the fury of the winds and waves  This be  my  lot Content shall league with Health  Nor give one anxious thought to pride or wealth  My luxury the summers fervid sun  In some o'erarching cave or grove to shun  Seek the deepshaded stream which steals along  And pour my unpremeditated song  When Winter drives my Cattle to the fold  And the shrunk Aether is benumb'd with cold  To heap the crackling fuel and at ease  Enjoy the spreading lustre of the blaze  Or bid my distant household Train draw nigh  And catch the pleasure beaming from their eye  Riches I give them to the windto Me  They shine unnoticed and my Fair to thee  Riches again I give You to the wind  Say can you add one pleasure to the Mind  Root out the everwithering branch of care  Or plant one vegetative virtue there  Widestraying Fancy whither dost Thou rove  O Thespia all these thoughts I owe to love  From thee they spring by thee my breast was fired  And reason sanctifies what love inspired  Had not thy wishes breathed an humble life  I might perhaps with base diseases rife  Have join'd the sordid thronghave dogg'd the train  Of abject Pride and clank'd my golden chain  Now do I know to live My Thespia now  To live indeed for Thou hast taught Me how  For thee My Love no toil would I disdain  But vie in labour with the meanest Swain  My Oxen join when day begins to peep  Or on the lonely mountain feed my sheep  And while my arms thy gentle form surround  Enjoy soft slumbers on the rugged ground  Who on th' embroider'd couch would wish to lye  If scornful love expand his sleepless eye  Ah wretch soft melody's enchanting strain  The downy pillow tempts repose in vain  Let Vanity in empty shew delight  To glitter in the Gazer's wondring sight  Let proud Ambition to the court repair  There the mean brow of servile flattery wear  Cringe to some worthless Pander every hour  Creep on the dirty ground to rise to power  Let Avarice looking on his tumid store  Exulting lift his head and curse the Poor  Thou fill'st my every wish and while the fire  Of life shall burn no other shall transpire  E'en at the last Thou still my sight shalt bless  And my weak hand shall strive thy hand to press  How wilt Thou mourn and droop thy pensive head  When on my bed of death I shall be laid  Yes Thou wilt mourn my pale cold limbs embrace  And bathe with ineffectual tears my face  Thou hast no flinty heart which cannot feel  Thy bosom is not braced with chains of steel  With streaming eyes see Me inhumed in clay  Nor force shall tear thee from my grave away  Yet Oh thy cheeks at that dread moment spare  Nor rend the flowing tresses of thy hair  Tho' torn from thee by Death's relentless will  My conscious soul shall fondly view thee still  Meantime let Love be ours too soon will spread  The sable cloud round each devoted head  Too soon Old Age steals on whose frosted hair  Forbids the genial blandishments to share  Now let the Fugitive be our's for now  On our flush'd cheeks sits well his fervent glow  Now it becomes to mix th' endearing scene  And scatter sweet protervity between  Far be the bustling World it's trivial joys  It's fame it's wealth it's honours I despise  XXI  HATH the flaming Car of day  Roll'd it's annual course away  Since my Thespia to my arms  Yielded first her Virgin charms  Since the meeklyblushing Fair  Whisper'd softly in my ear  Anxious grief and doubt are flown  Take Me I am all thy own  Yes the rapid hours are past  Fled with more than winged haste  Swift indeed is Pleasure's tread  Swift Ye Hours of joy Ye fled  Everenchanting Evernew  Still with fondest look I view  The gentle beams which from thy heart  Thro' thy eyes expressive dart  Still I feel a Lover's fire  Tenderest thoughts and warm desire  The bridal Graces round thee play  Young Unconscious of decay  Hence reproach and satire vain  Fools may feel the galling chain  Freedom for Us the garland wove  Connecting Hymen close with Love  Doth possession render less  The sweet zest of happiness  How with pity We behold  The groveling soul and slaves of gold  XXII  I Call no Virgin of the Nine  I bend not low at Fancy's shrine  To truth alone these strains belong  She guides my pen and prompts my song  O Thespia Time which can controul  The wilder fervours of the soul  Before whom falsehood stands confest  Of frailty the decisive test  Hath while the stillprogressive year  Surrounded twice the solar sphere  Added new strength to tender love  The passion nicer spirits prove  Hath tried thy soul and found it right  Hath brought new graces forth to light  Discover'd beauties in the Wife  Which could not bloom in single life  How poor is Wealth how low is Power  Compared with thy superior dower  Thine are the charms of Innocence  Of unaffected native sense  From that springs chaste and humorous Mirth  And this to Decency gives birth  The band without whose modest tye  Mirth is unmeaning revelry  Thine is Compassion's breath sincere  Her gentle sigh and generous tear  Prudential caution artless ease  That sweet solicitude to please  Which never fails my soul to bless  And renders every trouble less  Let Fortune frown let Friendship fade  Disown the promises it made  Let Flattery cringe her baits display  And leagued with selfish Fraud betray  Whatever winds across my course  Blow adverse and whate'er their force  Thou still shalt soothe my ruffled breast  With thee Peace builds her Halcyon nest  Thou wilt Content's pure joys impart  And calm Serenity of heart  I hate no more by thee refined  But only wonder at Mankind  And tho' I know my prayer is vain  And they are fetter'd by the chain  Of Folly Malice Pride and Pelf  Wish They were happy as Myself  XXIII  THERE are who think Mankind are born to rove  By nature vagrant as th' uncertain gale  Who laugh at vows of constancy and love  As dreams of fancy or a Dotard's tale  To these my Thespia silence is the best  The only answer can be justly given  Let them enjoy their dull unmeaning jest  Can creeping Mists pollute the face of Heaven  They know not real love nor ever knew  And bent on vulgar scenes of low delight  Can never Virtue's genuine beauties view  Or the true ray of pleasure mildly bright  In fashion's bowers they flit their little day  And eager from their souls to banish thought  To idle dissipation homage pay  And giddy drink her variousmingled draught  For them let secret Pity drop a tear  And nobly conscious of sublimer joys  Selfsatisfied her happier fortune bear  And leave to change and vanity their toys  Conscious the darling Object ne'er can tire  True love to each external good is blind  Fixt is the wavering pinion of desire  Thought answers thought and Mind embraces Mind  Who think like Us like Us who love to those  Can wealth or power an added pleasure give  Their tender sympathy still stronger grows  Till memory dies their warm affections live  Them do their smiling Progeny amuse  The infant race their mutual cares employ  This gift should wisest Providence refuse  They in each other center every joy  Not accident or time can e'er divide  The attractive firm indissoluble chain  The band which cordial Amity hath tyed  No Power but Death itself can break in twain  XXIV  London  February    HERE mid the giddy and the vain I rove  In cheerless solitude nor taste of joy  My mind retreats to those dear scenes of love  Those scenes where pleasure reigns without alloy  Unsatisfied from gayety I turn  What charms has luxury or pride for Me  Methinks I view departed Virtues Urn  And sorrowing fix my longing thoughts on thee  On thee her living Image in whose soul  Dwells every grace which harmonizes life  Which gilds with bliss the moments as they roll  And makes Me venerate the name of Wife  Here mid the croud unknowing and unknown  I pass in gloomy sullenness along  Each entertainment now is odious grown  The dance insipid tiresome is the song  Ah I perceive that nought on earth can please  When wanting thee sole object of delight  Thy eyes emit their soft expressive rays  And pleasure smiles enamour'd at the sight  Alone I bear a dull and lifeless load  My thoughts are moping comfortless and cold  Thy presence is the warm inciting goad  Which cheers each sense and renders fancy bold  How wretched They who in the mazy round  Of idle fashion urge their fruitless chace  Who every tender sentiment confound  And Nature's laws submit to Folly base  Here every hour the Ideot train I spy  The busy fluttering gay unthinking Crew  In every place they meet the sated eye  And wanton Licence sickens at the view  They know my Love no happiness serene  Tho' in the wild pursuit their lives are spent  They die unconscious of the soothing strain  Which charms the listening ear of sweet Content  Mistaken Fair Ones Idle thoughtless Tribe  Victims to vice to vanity and play  Say could the World and all its riches bribe  Thy nobler heart my Thespia thus to stray  Thus to abandon the domestic scene  Where gentlest Peace forever waves her wing  Where Honour Virtue Mild affection reign  And Hymen wears th' eternal vest of spring  No never Thou incircled in my arms  Own'st every wish and every joy compleat  While I with rapture gazing on thy charms  Despise the mean ambition of the great  Ye sluggish Hours haste haste more swift away  That I may fly to all my soul holds dear  Thy banner chaste Connubial Love display  And guide Me safely to her breast sincere  XXV  YE Nymphs who tend each blooming grove  Of shady  Hants  receive My Fair  Oh heed th' intreating voice of Love  And guard her with peculiar care  A Worthier Guest Ye never knew  Ne'er hail'd a Soul of more unspotted hue  If thus my Thespia tread the plain  A favourite of the Sylvan Powers  Or in the friendly dome remain  Where glide Life's pure unruffled hours  Say will not her reflecting Mind  Oft trace the pleasing scenes She left behind  It will awhile Herself She cheats  And thinks the distant vision near  With newraised joy her bosom beats  But soon it fades and melts in air  Wishing the real scenes to spy  With downcast look She checks the tender sigh  From my own thoughts I judge of thine  The same illusions float around  But ah too quickly I resign  Th' ideal form the ideal sound  Thy graces like the Meteor's ray  Thy voice like feeble Echo's dies away  On Isca's margin green I rove  Or hurry t'ward the rural Cot  But unobserved by social Love  The varied landscape charms Me not  Only by thee attractive made  Deck'd with it's beauteous tints of light and shade  Oh come Thou Wanderer Pleasures beam  Now setting shall again arise  With Love United pour it's stream  Of radiance and adorn the skies  Come Gentle Wanderer to my heart  Return return my Soul's far dearer part  XXVI  NOW Issuing from his northern reign  Stern Winter rushes o'er the plain  And proudly boasts his power  The Genius of the forest sighs  While pensive Nature shivering lyes  Beneath her leafless bower  Who Thespia shall the season cheer  Relax the rigour of the year  And e'en in Winter's arms  Bid Fancy place gayblooming Spring  And frolic Zephyr wave his wing  In homage to her charms  Ah who but Love within the breast  By his enchanting influence blest  Perennial roses grow  Ethereal Mildness harbours there  No furious storms or nipping air  His sweet Enthusiasts know  They view wellpleased a different clime  To them a different date of time  Another Sun belongs  While allunseen by vulgar eye  Ten thousand plumed Pleasures fly  And chaunt their vernal songs  If haply human Passions swell  And shake awhile their peaceful cell  They strive with idle force  Soon mutual Fondness in her chains  The momentary blasts restrains  And smiling checks their course  Soon as before the lillies bloom  Again the roses breathe perfume  And fresher colours spread  Again the Pleasures wave their wing  Again their warbled transports sing  Around the nuptial bed  O Thespia days and Years pass by  The varying seasons We espy  To Us no change is known  With Us perpetual verdure blows  For Us with constant beauty glows  A Season of our own  XXVII  SAY can the Muse with all her magic power  Tho' every grace attends her fairy train  Tho' She hath cull'd each bloom which decks the bower  Of Elegance to ornament her strain  Can She the soul of Hymeneal Love  Can She its tender sympathies pourtray  While Harmony expands her wings above  And Passion yields to Friendship's steadier ray  Ah no 'tis Her's the suffering Lover's tears  His feverish hopes and wild desires to paint  His giddy transports jealous doubts and fears  But who can trace the charms of full Content  The soft complacence of the conscious heart  Mocks the rude touches of Poetic Art  XXVIII  THO' I have broke by force the dazzling spell  No longer by its bright illusions sway'd  Tho' plunged in action I have bid farewell  To soothing Fancy to each tuneful Maid  Yet at thy call I take a transient view  And for a moment seek the Muses' shrine  Freshblooming chaplets on their Altar strew  To their enchantments deaf but ruled by thine  Yes witness Nuptial Love No other Power  Could now evoke the longforgotten strain  With glancing sunbeam cheer the clouded hour  And urge Me to their roseate paths again  With thee I trace each lawn each meadow green  Thy voice is that of reason science truth  With thee I visit each Ideal scene  The rapturebreathing haunts of early Youth  Wellpleased the Son of Venus I behold  Wellpleased behold Him aim his thrilling dart  And generous Ardour scorning sordid gold  And Faith ingenuous linking heart to heart  And adverse Fate prepared to break the tye  But idlystriving with malicious hand  And Perseverance with intrepid eye  And Hope gaywaving her ethereal wand  And Hymen with a fragrant garland crown'd  By the soft fingers of the graces wove  Scattering profuse a thousand blessings round  And holding converse sweet with smiling Love  With smiling Love still converse sweet He holds  To no ideal scenes We need repair  The Muse's hallow'd shrine his wing infolds  And the Bard offers his just homage there  His be the chaplets his the Votive lay  Let others dwell on thoughts of past delight  He gilds the beams of this auspicious day  And sheds o'er all the Fane his influence bright  This morn to gratulate for many a year  May I with joy awake the slumbering lyre  My Numbers which to Thespia first were dear  Will at her bidding reassume their fire  I ask not fame Misjudging Croud begone  The Muse ye vilify sings not for You  She sings for Thespia and from her alone  Expects the palm to constant passion due  XXIX  Bath  December    YE Nymphs Who o'er these mystic springs preside  Which the laborious search of Art deride  By whom alone is traced their winding course  Who know each seed impregnating their source  And whether chymic heat or real flame  Preserves their warmth thro' countless years the same  Great is your Virtue and with praises due  Hygeia oft hath tuned the lyre to You  But Oh Ye Chastebreath'd Harmonies whose sway  And gentle impulse Minds select obey  Who in the softer purer heart reside  Each thought refine and each emotion guide  Who from that seat expel intruding care  And bid serene complacence harbour there  Bid Patience spread her wing Ethereal Guest  And charm the sullen passious into rest  Without your aid how vain the boasted waves  Would issue from their subterraneous caves  In vain the Nymphs would cause them still to flow  Steam in the Bath or in the Chrystal glow  Say then my Thespia shall not I e'erlong  The blueey'd Sisters hail with grateful song  Who to these streams no doubt inspired by Heaven  Such matchless force and energy have given  Yes Pristine Health must soon again be Mine  For all the mental Harmonies are thine  XXX  O Thou who climb'st at morn the mountain high  Viewing th' impurpled East with joyful eye  Thence with light step descending to the vale  Imbibest with extasy the breezy gale  Or piercing thro' some covert yet untried  Beating the moist o'erhanging boughs aside  Still movest delighted on with nimble pace  The sprinkled dewdrops glittering in thy face  Listening the brook which idly brawls along  And every plumed Warbler's matin song  Or when the burnish'd Car by Phoebus roll'd  Darts more intense it's rays of liquid gold  Beneath some ivyfringed cave reclined  Fancy's bright Visions rushing on thy Mind  With spirits bland nursed by the genial Powers  Soothest with melodious notes the sultry hours  Nor less when each gay verdant scene is lost  And Winter shoots his darts of polar frost  With Exercise thy Sister pleased to brave  The Winds fierce issuing from their stormy cave  Fleet o'er the smooth and icebound lake to skim  While the blood glows in every active limb  To follow where the Hounds direct their speed  Urging o'er hill and dale the rapid Steed  Or by the social blaze with cheerful breast  Prompting the tale of mirth and frolic jest  The rural laugh which springs from heartfelt glee  The sprightly dance and artless minstrelsy  Hygeia Fairest Nymph of Dian's train  Ah why by Me so long pursued in vain  I see thee not when beams Morn's purple light  When shines the Sun with midday fervour bright  I meet thee not upon the mountain's brow  In the wild woodland or the vale below  Nor by the pratling brook with osiers crown'd  Nor in the cave with flaunting ivy bound  And when the Minstrel sings with heartfelt glee  To Him confest thy charms are hid from Me  Hygeia Fairest Nymph of Dian's train  Ah why by me so long pursued in vain  Yet sometimes at a distance I survey  But dim and thro' a cloud thy paler ray  I snatch the lucid interval and soar  Awhile with swiftwing'd Fancy as of yore  The Muses invocate with zealous prayer  Nor unpropitious do the Muses hear  Till the cloud thickening veils thy beams in Night  Fancy prone sinks from her aerial height  Pain whets his stings their torpid force prevails  The venom spreads the mental ardour fails  Still fly Hygeia drooping Fancy fly  A sacred Power there is forever nigh  Love in thy shape My Thespia stands unmoved  Love ne'er deserts what once it truly loved  Sickness still more forbids it's bonds to start  And pity softens more it's tender heart  A gentler but more strong attraction reigns  And milder energies newbrace it's chains  While then My Thespia's looks each care beguile  While in her presence pain and languor smile  While on the mind She pours an healing balm  And binds it's tempests in an Halcyon calm  Awakens hope and banishes despair  And tho' I feel yet teaches Me to bear  Still fly Hygeia Thou too Fancy fly  A strengthening soulinspiring Power is nigh  Let That her influence This her strains refuse  Thou shalt be Health my Thespia Thou the Muse  XXXI  AT least in plumes unborrow'd I present  These Elegies of Love to Thespia's eye  She hates with Me the florid ornament  And gawdy Muse whose strains her soul belie  To Thespia only and the Few whose taste  Accords with Her's the tender lays belong  Life's real scenes domestic simple chaste  Form for the Vulgar no attractive song  Envy might hasten to depreciate fame  And Critics sneer with many a lowbred jest  Join with their groveling wit her spotless name  Studious t' affect with pain her modest breast  They might perhaps with base illiberal art  Each weaker number cull for who can build  The perfect rhime and from the excepted part  Pronounce the Whole with faults unseemly fill'd  Or hating Living Worth some Author dead  Produce his sainted page contrast with mine  And think the wreathe must fade upon my head  Because his laurels spite of Malice shine  Not thus They would aver Tibullus wove  His gentle song to Delia's matchless praise  Not Hammond thus the favour'd Priest of Love  Taught by each Grace pour'd his mellifluous lays  Their Muse no doubt entire Perfection crowns  No little lapse no flaw we can espy  Insensible are They to Envy's frowns  They do not live t' offend Detractions' eye  No Bard I seek to rival in my strain  As Nature dictated the Roman wrote  Hammond in elegant and easy vein  Hath sweetly copied what Tibullus thought  As Nature dictated with sovereign will  So rose my thoughts so flow'd my easy lay  The quick sensations fly from tardy skill  Yet Elegance may move as swift as They  For with the Sentiment th' Expression springs  From the same lucid chamber of the Mind  Coarseness it's speed must check retract it's wings  And hovering ound long strive to be refined  But Thespia smilesShe all the verse inspired  Form'd each idea sees each feeling true  Love is the only Judge to be desired  Where only Love the genuine portraits drew  Hence then away Ye mean Invidious Bands  And the vile Croud which iterates your voice  These strains my Thespia shall escape their hands  Such is thy purer wish and such my choice  Some Friends Alone our faithful loves shall read  Consentient Minds who cannot will not blame  From Envy from each grosser passion freed  Whose thoughts are hallow'd whose esteem is Fame  Passages in the First Second Elegy of Tibullus alluded to Page  I  DIVITIAS alius fulvo sibi congerat auro  Et teneat culti jugera magna soli  Quem labor assiduus vicino terreat hoste  Martia cui somnos classica pulsa fugent  Me mea paupertas vitae traducit inerti  Ipse seram teneras maturo tempore vites  Rusticus et sacili grandia poma manu  Nec spes destituat sed frugum semper acervos  Praebeat  Nam veneror seu stipes habet desertus in agris  Seu vetus in trivio florida serta lapis  Sed canis aestivos ortus vitare sub umbra  Arboris ad rivos praetereuntis aquae  Nec tamen interdum pudeat tenuisse bidentem  Aut stimulo tardos increpuisse boves  Non agnamve sinu pigeat foetumve capellae  Desertum oblita matre referre domum  At vos exiguo pecori furesque lupique  Parcite  Parva seges satis est parvo requiescere lecto  Si licet et solito membra levare toro  Quam juvat immites ventos audire cubantem  Et dominam tenero continuisse sinu  Aut gelidas hybernus aquas cum fuderit Auster  Securum somnos imbre juvante sequi  Hoc mihi contingat sit dives jure furorem  Qui maris et tristes ferre potest pluvias  O quantum est auri pereat  Te spectem suprema mihi cum venerit hora  Et teneam Moriens deficiente manu  Flebis et arsuro positum Me Delia lecto  Tristibus et lacrymis oscula mista dabis  Flebis non tua sunt duro praecordia serro  Vincta nec in tenero stat tibi corde silex  Illo non juvenis poterit de funere quisquam  Lumina non virgo sicca referre domum  Tu Manes ne laede meos sed parce solutis  Crinibus et teneris Delia parce genis  Interea dum fata sinunt jungamus amores  Iam veniet tenebris mors adoperta caput  Iam subrepet iners aetas neo amare decebit  Dicere nec cano blanditias capite  Nunc levis est tractanda Venus dum frangere postes  Non pudet et rixas inseruisse juvat  Ferte et opes ego composito securus acervo  Despiciam dites  II  IPSE boves mea si tecum modo Delia possim  Iungere et in folo pascere monte pecus  Et te dum liceat teneris retinere lacertis  Mollis et inculta sit mihi somnus humo  Quid Tyrio recubare toro sine amore secundo  Prodest cum fletu nox vigilanda venit  Nam neque tum plumae nec stragula picta soporem  Nec sonitus placidae ducere possit aquae
