OF Gross Heresy Blasphemy Idolatry Po∣pery in BRITAIN  IN TWO LETTERS TO A FRIEND  IN WHICH The Doctrine of the Westminster Confession of Faith relative to Toleration of a False Religion and the power of the Civil Magistrate about Sacred Mat∣ters and the Nature Origin Ends and Obligation of the National Covenant and Solemn League are candidly represented and defended  BY JOHN BROWN Minister of the Gospel in HADDINGTON  GLASGOW Printed by JOHN BRYCE And Sold by the Booksellers in Town and Country MDCCLXXX  LETTER I On the absurdity of  Authoritative  TOLERATION of  gross Heresy Blasphemy  or  Idolatry  SIR  HOW God himself connected religion and the civil welfare of nations in his ancient laws almost the whole of the Old Testament doth bear witness That religion is the great basis of civil happiness was the common the avowed belief of e∣very sensible Heathen It was for ought I know the infamous monster Tiberius who first pretended  That the Gods alone ought to regard or resent the injuries done them  Before the happy Reformation the Popish clergy had reduced civil rulers into mere tools for exe∣cuting their pleasure in religious matters and pre∣tended that they  had no power of judging  in them To free these rulers from such Antichristian claims the Protestant reformers every where as their Confessi∣ons of faith and other writings make evident loudly maintained That to magistrates themselves indepen∣dent of clergymen belongs a distinguished power in the  reformation  and  preservation  of religion Not long after Erastus a German physician and his fol∣lowers to curry favour with their respective princes pretended That magistrates are the proper lords of the Christian church from whom her ministers and other rulers derive their whole power and to whom they must be accountable This notion exceedingly flattering their ambition was too greedily embraced by most of the Protestant princes nor do I know of one Protestant church which hath not suffered by  means of it Meanwhile the German Anabaptists having experienced the frowns and sometimes the improper severities of magistrates copied after the ancient Donatists in the like circumstances and warm∣ly contended That magistrates have no more power about religious matters than any private person and ought to punish none for different sentiments in doc∣trine or forms of worship The Socinians and re∣monstrant Arminians except when magistrates favour∣ed themselves and promoted their cause zealously contended for the same notion at least in the case of ministers and worship which were not maintained at the public expence Many if not most of the Eng∣lish Independents in the last century were much of the same mind and hence by their influence some pas∣sages in the Westminster Confession of Faith could ne∣ver obtain a ratification by the English Parliament or a place in their own  Savoy Confession  Part of these passages relative to the magistrate's power are also dropt from the Confession of Faith agreed to by the Independents of New England in Most of the English Dissenters of this century seem to be much of the same mind especially such as might otherwise have been exposed to danger on account of their open maintenance of Arian Socinian and Quakerish blas∣phemiesLocke and bishop Hoadly and some others of the Episcopalian party warmly espoused the same cause  This notion never received much countenance in Scotland till Mr Glass of Tealing commenced a fu∣rious newfashioned Independent He mightily con∣tended That the Jewish nation was an ecclesiastical one and their kings ecclesiastical rulers that Chris∣tian magistrates have no more power in religious mat∣ters than private Christians and ought not to employ their power in advancing the true religion or in mak∣ing laws with penalties in favour of it or in restraining or punishing heretics or false teachers nor ought they to give more encouragement to good Christians than to other peaceable subjectsthat the example of the re∣forming kings of Judah in punishing idolatry and false worship and in promoting the true religion is not now to be imitated and that our fathers national  covenanting against Popery and other wickedness in favour of the true religion was  unwarrantable  and is  not binding  upon us  Dr Wisheart Principal of the college of Edinburgh  in his sermons contended That magistrates have only a right to punish such crimes as strike immediately against the persons or property of men but not to punish any thing which strikes im∣mediately against the honour of God as blasphe∣my or heresy that all men ought to have civil liber∣ty to think and speak as they please providing they make no attack upon the welfare of civil society that none ought to be hampered in their search after truth by any requirement of their subscriptions to  Formu∣las  or  Confessions of Faith  that children in their edu∣cation ought never to be biassed to a side by learning catechisms which maintain the peculiar principles of a party These or the like notions have been adopt∣ed by not a few of the pretenders to modern illumi∣nation  In her  public Standards  the Church of Scotland hath renounced and in her solemn covenants hath abjured both these extremes In her  Old Confession of Faitb  which is expresly sworn to in the national cove∣nant of  c  as  in all points the undoubted truth of God  Art xxiv she asserts that  "the power and authority of magistrates is God's  holy ordinance  or∣dained for manifestation of his own glory and for the singular profit of mankindthey are the  lieutenants of God  in whose sessions God himself doth fit and judgeto whom by God is given the sword to the praise and defence of good men and to punish all o∣pen malefactors To kings princes rulers and ma∣gistrates chiefly and most principally the conservati∣on and purgation of religion appertains so that not only are they appointed for civil policy but also for maintenance of the true religion and for suppression of all idolatry and superstition whatsoever"  This doctrine is further asserted and explained in her second book of discipline chap ix The doctrine of her  Westminster Confession of Faith  the WHOLE of which is solemnly espoused and engaged to by every Presby∣terian minister and elder in Scotland in his ordination vows is that  "for their publishing opinions or main∣taining  practices contrary to the light of nature and the known principles of Christianity whether concerning faith worship or conversation or to the power of godliness or such erroneous opinions or practices as either in their own nature or in the manner of pub∣lishing and maintaining them are destructive to the external peace and order which Christ hath establi∣shed in the church they may be lawfully called to account and proceeded against bythe power of the civil magist  ate" Chap xx  that  "God the su∣preme Lord and King of all the world hath ordained civil magistrates to be under him over the people for his own glory and the public goodthey ought especially in managing their office to maintain PI∣ETY justice and peace according to the  wholesome  laws of each commonwealthThat the civil magis∣trateHATH authority and it IS his duty to take order that unity and peace be preserved in the church and that the truth of God be kept pure and entire that all blasphemies and heresies be suppressed all cor∣ruptions and abuses in worship and discipline prevent∣ed and reformed and all the ordinances of God du∣ly settled administered and observed For the better effecting of which he hath power to call Synods to be present at them and to provide that whatsoever is transacted in them be according to the mind of God" Chap xxiii  "The duties required in the second commandment arethe disapproving detest∣ing opposing all false worship and according to each one's place and calling removing it and all monu∣ments of idolatryThe sins forbidden in the second commandment are all devising counselling com∣manding using and any ways approving any religi∣ous worship not instituted by God himself tolerating a false religion" Lar Cat Q  These de∣clarations are an authentic explication of the power of the magistrate in  maintaining and preserving the true religion  the defence of which is expresly sworn in their solemn covenants with God If therefore Sir you discredit this doctrine and plead the toleration of idolatry blasphemy heresy and that magistrates ought to meddle with nothing in religion be so ho∣nest as openly to renounce your ordination vows and  the Confession of Faith and Catechisms as well as the national Covenant and Solemn League  To illustrate the above doctrine of our excellent standards it is proper to observe God alone is the necessarily existent and absolutely independent Creator and preserver and therefore original and su∣preme proprietor and governor of all things in hea∣ven or earth Exod iii Gen i Psal civ and xxiv xxxiii lxxxiii xlvii Ezek i Col i Dan iv All right ci∣vil natural or spiritual whether of conscience or of persons or of husbands parents masters magis∣trates ministers or even of Christ as mediator must therefore wholly originate from God alone Psalm cxv Rom ii Heb ii Acts x Cor v Psal lxxv Dan ii iv Mat xxviii ii John v To suppose any real  right or being whatsoever unoriginating from him is to give up with the necessary existence of God and to plunge into the very  depths of Atheism  All right and authority of conscience persons hus∣bands parents magistrates ministers or even of Christ as mediator being wholly derived from God ought necessarily ought wholly to be improved or exercised in his name in conformity and subordinati∣on to his law as the supreme rule and in order to promote his declarative glory as the chief end of it Prov xvi Rom ii Pet iv Cor x John v viii vii Eph iii No right or authority derived from God can therefore be lawfully improven or exercised in protecting encou∣raging allowing or commanding any thing which God himself on account of his infinite perfection in holi∣ness justice goodness and truth cannot commandor in discouraging disallowing or prohibiting any thing which God in his law requires It is absurd to suppose it that God can give men a power which he hath not himself and shocking blasphemy to sup∣pose him capable of giving men a right and authority to contemn or counteract his own law as their rule or his own glory as their chief end in every thing they do Tim ii Hab i Exod xv Deut xxxii Zeph iii James i All the diversified forms of right and authority in conscience  husbands parents masters magistrates ministers and even in Christ as mediator being derived from the  same God of infinite wisdom and order  each of them may and ought to be wholly exercised within its proper de∣partment and in a manner answerable to its nature and never in the way of invading the place or inter∣rupting the exercise of any other right or authority No right of conscience can be exercised to the inter∣ruption of the due exercise of marital parental ma∣gisterial magistratical ministerial or Christ's media∣torial authority nor can any regular exercise of these powers interrupt the due exercise of the power of conscience or of one another Cor xiv vii All these different forms of power and authority being derived from the  same God  may have the same things for their object but viewed in different respects The same man may be subject to the power of his conscience as he is a rational crea∣turesubject to the power of parents as a childsubject to the power of masters as a servantsubject to the power of magistrates as a member of the com∣monwealthsubject to the power of churchrulers as a member of an organized visible churchsubject to the mediatorial power of Christ as a member of his mystical body or an agent for promoting the wel∣fare of itThe same good work of piety or virtue may or ought to be required by conscience by pa∣rents masters magistrates ministers and even by Christ as mediator in different respects as calculated to promote the welfare of the persons families nati∣ons and churches concernedin subordination to the glory of God as their respective proprietor and superior The performance of the same good work may be encouraged by rewards from all these diffe∣rent powers answerable to their respective formsThe same vices of idolatry blasphemy calumny trea∣son theft murder  c  as in different respects hurt∣ful to persons families civil societies and churches may and ought to be prohibited by all these different powers and resented by each as hurtful to itself as subordinated to Godin a manner answerable to its particular nature and departmentby conscience with stinging rebukesby parents with correction disin∣heriting  or the likeby masters with frowns stripes abridgment of wages or the likeby magistrates with public dishonour fining imprisonment or deathby church rulers with ecclesiastical rebuke excom∣municationby Christ with temporal spiritual or eternal judgment Acts xxiv Josh xxiv Psal ci Mat v vi vii  c  All these powers of conscience husbands parents masters magistrates churchrulers and of Christ as mediator proceeding from an infinitely wise powerful and good God are each of them in its own place altogether sufficient to gain its own endNevertheless it mightily tends to the advantage of each that all of them be rightly exercised at once and to the hurt os all the rest if any of them be not If conscience act faithfully this promotes the regular and comfortable exercise of the power of husbands parents masters magistrates or ministers  c  And it is to the advantage of consci∣ence if they regularly exercise their power and espe∣cially if Christ exercise his in a remarkable manner It is much to the advantage of Church and State if husbands parents and masters faithfully exercise their power in their respective departments and much to their hurt if they do not If the rulers in Church and State faithfully discharge their trust it will tend much to promote the welfare of families The more faithfully ministers labour in winning souls to Christ and teaching men to live soberly righte∣ously and godly in view of Christ's second coming the more easy will the work of magistrates and the great∣er the happiness of the commonwealth beThe more faithfully magistrates act in curbing of crimes and promoting obedience to God the King of nations as a mean of securing his felicitating blessing to the commonwealth the more delightfully will churchpower be exercised and the more abundantly it will tend to the welfare of the church Nay though the mediatorial power of Christ be infinitely sufficient in its own place to answer its own ends yet the delight∣ful exercise and success of it is not a little promoted by the faithful exercise of the powers of conscience husbands parents masters magistrates and churchrulers Acts xxiv Tim i Eph ivvi Col  iii iv Tim Titus iiii Pet iiv Psalm ii Rev ii xvii xxi Isa xlix lx Though the marital pa∣rental magisterial magistratical and ministerial pow∣ers be altogether distinct from and independent of one another and each of them have its own particu∣lar exercises pertaining to it aloneyet the same per∣son in respect of different relations may be at once superior or inferior to another personand so may be required to fulfil the particular duties of his station by one who hath not any lawful right to perform them himself Thus magistrates and ministers as such may require husbands to perform their duties to their wives parents to perform theirs to their children or masters theirs to their servants as a mean of promot∣ing the welfare of the commonwealth and of the church in obedience to God and aiming at his glo∣ry An uncrowned husband of a queen may com∣mand her faithfully to exercise her magistratical power as a means of honour and happiness to his family and she as queen may command him in eve∣ry thing relating to the welfare of the state as her of∣ficer or subject A parent may require his son as such faithfully to exercise his ministerial magistra∣tical or magisterial power as a mean of honour and happiness to his family A son may command his fa∣ther who is his servant in every thing pertaining to the service due from him and even to order his fami∣ly aright in so far as it tends to promote that service Ministers as the ambassadors of Christ have power to require magistrates  as church members  faithfully to exercise their magistratical power so as may best promote the honour of Christ and the welfare of his church And on the other hand magistrates have power to require ministers  as their subjects  faithfully to exercise their ministerial power as a mean of ren∣dering the nation pious and virtuous in order to pro∣mote its happinessand all this in subordination to the law and to promote the glory of God as the su∣preme governor of families churches or nations Though the marital parental magisterial ma∣gistratical and ministerial powers have each of them  something for its peculiar and distinguishing object in which no other power can interfere with itThus it is always unlawful for husbands parents mas∣ters or ministers  as such  to assume the power of civil magistrates in levying taxes adjudging criminals to deathalways unlawful for parents masters or ma∣gistrates  as such  to preach the gospel dispense sacra∣ments or churchcensuresyet if the exercise of some of these powers be fearfully neglected or abused the other powers may be exercised in order to rec∣tify the disorders occasioned further than would be proper if there were no such neglect abuse or dis∣order Thus if husbands parents or masters fear∣fully abuse their power relative to wives children or servants the rulers of church or state for the be∣nefit of these societies may interfere more with their familyconcerns than would be proper in other cir∣cumstances If churchrulers be notoriously negli∣gent or wicked magistrates  as churchmembers  and to  promote the welfare of the state  may do more in the re∣formation of the church than would be proper for them if church rulers were diligent and faithful And if through the indolence or wickedness of ma∣gistrates the affairs of the nation be thrown into terri∣ble confusion ministers  as members of the commonwealth and to promote the welfare of the church  may do more in the rectification of affairs than would be proper if the magistrates were faithful Kings xi Chron xxiii All governing authority empowers the possessors of it to issue forth laws or commandments binding on the subject of it But these laws or com∣mandments can extend their binding force no further than the particular department belonging to that pow∣er as by that every particular form of authority de∣rived from God is limited The laws or command∣ments of parents masters magistrates and churchrulers extend only to external things in the family commonwealth or church These of conscience and of Christ extend also to that which is inward in the heartAnd as all human superiors are imperfect in knowledge themselves and cannot enable their sub∣jects perfectly to understand their whole duty it is ne∣cessary that laws of families or nations or constituti∣ons  of churches require  nothing but what is plainly a∣greeable to the law of God  and nothing in religion but what is  plainly required by the word of God  that so no∣thing may be contrary to these laws but what is not only  really  but  plainly  contrary to the word of God And the weaker the subjects are the more conde∣scension ought to be exercised towards them in this matter Rom xv As men cannot bow the hearts of their inferiors unto subjection they ought always to issue forth their commandments in the most prudent mild and gaining manner It is very im∣proper to issue forth any law doubtful or obscure or which most of the subjects are not likely to be got peaceably to comply with This ought especially to be attended to in the framing and imposing of  laws and constitutions relative to religion  which ought to be a  reasonable  and  voluntary  service As noth∣ing particularly in religion ought to be contrary to any law of church or state but what is plainly con∣trary to the law of God and nothing ought to be held  censurable  by the laws of the church or  punishable  by the laws of the state but what is  plainly contrary  to these laws and hath become  duly public  in the pro∣vidence of God without requiring the party concern∣ed to be his own accuserSo on account of the weakness or number of the offenders or the disorder∣ed state of the society  many real scandals  in the church must be forborne without centure and  many real crimes  against the state forborne without punishment notwithstanding it would be extremely wicked  au∣thoritatively  to license or tolerate them in either If your children be very young raving in a fever deli∣rious or apt to fall into convulsive fits it might be very prudent and dutiful for you to forbear severe chastisement of them for playing on the Lord's day repeating some wicked expressions they had heard from their fellow children or the like But would it be lawful in you to give them a parental licence to profane the Sabbath or name of God and promise them protection in so doing You dare not pretend it God himself wisely forbears the punishment of many things which his law forbids As it is never errors or corruptions  of the heart  but wick∣ed  words and deeds sufficiently and regularly mani∣fested which are to be corrected in families punish∣ed in commonwealths or censured in churches Deut xiii xvii Heb x Tim v So even in punishing manifest crimes especially in mat∣ters of religion all proper mildness ought to be exer∣cised never proceeding to extremities where there is any hope of reformation or where as in the case of heresy or blasphemy confession and repentance can make any kind of restitution Mat xviii Among the Hebrews not one appears to have been punished for idolatry if he professed repentance and reformation The princes of Israel first attempted to bring the Reubenites and Gadites whom they sup∣posed guilty of it to repentance Josh xxii Never in the reformation by Asa Hezekiah or Jofiah have we one instance of a penitent idolater slain The idolaters condemned to death Deut xiii xvii are re∣presented as  men of Belial  presumptuous and obsti∣nate in their wickedness The prophets of Baal whom Elijah caused be put to death Kings xviii and Mattan the priest who was slain by Jehoiada's or∣ders Kings xi were no doubt of this sort and probably also guilty of promoting the murder of the Lord's prophets and people The man put to death for profanation of the Sabbath appears to have acted presumptuously Num xv Asa and his subjects covenanted to put to death such as obstinately adhered to idolatry Chron xv Ma∣gistrates ought never to attempt  forcing  men to believe with their hearts even the most fundamental truths of religion or to practise any religious dutythat be∣ing no means appointed by God for convincing them of the truth or inducing them to a cordial perfor∣mance of religious duties Cor x But it would be highly absurd hence to infer That magis∣trates  may not restrain  men from robbing nations or churches of those divine truths which God hath gra∣ciously entrusted to them and which are inexpressi∣bly profitable to themor  restrain  them from propa∣gating gross heresies blasphemies idolatries which undermine and exclude the true religion provoke God o destroy nations and are the fruitful seeds of  contention confusion and every evil work No ma∣gistrate can compel me to love my neighbour as my self or can justly compel me to divide mine inheritance with him but he may lawfully punish me for calum∣niating or robbing him  It is therefore extremely uncandid in the advocates for magistratical tolerations of heresy blasphemy and idolatry always to attempt blending or placing on an equal level  true  and  false  religion  mere neglect  of some positive duties of religion and  shocking insults  u∣pon and  opposition  to the duties of religion  lesser  and  secret mistakes  in religion and the  most damnable  heresies blasphemies and idolatries openly and ob∣stinately professed and practised as if these were e∣qually objects of toleration restraint or punishmentor to confound a  mere forbearance  to punish with an  authoritative licence  openly to prosess and practise what is criminal respecting religion The true religion ought never to need a toleration It ought always to have an establishment Whereas a false one ought never to be established magistrates having no power against the truth but for the truth There are  many mere neglects  or  lesser mistakes  in religion against which it would not be proper for magistrates to enact civil laws in this present state of imperfection And if there be no civil law against them they cannot be punishable as crimes  "Where no law is there can be no transgression"  Mere forbearance to punish what is plainly contrary to law is in some cases ne∣cessary and in imitation of God himself and gives no positive encouragement to wickedness Whereas a  positive  or  authoritative  toleration proclaims to men a liberty to sin and promiseth them protection in so doing If the provider for an army deliver to them fine flour mixed with some particles of bran and a large quantity of arsenic Is his delivery of the sine flour or even of the mixture of bran as criminal and punishable as that of the mixture of arsenic No man that is not mad will pretend it For the fine flour he deserves the highest  encouragement  for the bran he may be justiy  forborne  but for the arse∣nic he deserves to be  hanged  The toleration which I mean to oppose if plainly and candidly expressed would run thus  "We the King and Parliament of as  powers or∣dained of Godministers of God for good  to menas the  ordinance of God  for the  terror  and  punishment of evil doers  and the  praise of them that do well  as  nursing fathers  to the church of Christin or∣der that all our subjects may  come to the knowledge of the truth  and  lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty  Do hereby in the  name and authority  of The Most High GOD from whom we have derived all that governing power which we possess that we  ruling in his fear  may exercise it wholly in obedience to his law and to promote his declarative glory in the worldGrant to all and every one of you our said subjects an  authorita∣tive toleration  or legal licenceopenly and obsti∣nately to pervert contradict and revile the decla∣rations of God contained in his wordand in the most in solent and abusive manner to blaspheme his nature perfections purposes and works par∣ticularly of the redemption of mankindand to corrupt his worship represent him in it in the most absurd and abominable formsor rob him of it giving it to devils monsters of wickedness brutes stocks or stones in his steadand with all your might to exert yourselves in making your fellow subjects do the likeAnd we hereby do In  the same name and authority  of God the King of nations promise you every kind and degree of ci∣vil protection in all such behaviour as you can pro∣fess or pretend your consciences do dictate or al∣lowproviding always that you commit your out∣rage only against God your and our Maker and Sovereignbut do not disturb the external peace of the nation in reviling the civil character seizing or hurting the civil property or any way abusing the body of any of your fellow sinners of mankind"  The correspondent warrant of conscience which we mean to impugn if honestly expressed would run thus  "I Conscience as the  great deputy  of The Most High GOD Lord and Lawgiver of the world implanted in every man's breast for  his temporal spiritual and eternal advantage Do hereby  In God's name and authority  and in the ex∣ercise of my power which is wholly derived from him and to be exercised for his glory in  trying all things by his law  and  approving  and  holding fast that which is good  Warrant and authorize all and eve∣ry one of you sons and daughters of men to de∣vise believe openly and obstinately profess and zealously propagate every damnable heresy and blasphemous opinion and to practise and propa∣gate every absurd and abominable form of idolatry which Satan who deceiveth the world and a heart deceitful above all things and desperately wick∣ed and given up of God to strong delusion belief of lies vile affections and a reprobate sense can make you think innocent or properAnd I do hereby In the  same name and authority  Grant  you my sacred claim of right  to all manner of liberty and protection from the civil magistrate in so do∣ingproviding always that you commit such in∣jury and outrage only against God your infinitely excellent high and gracious Proprietor and Su∣perior and do no civil injury to the body charac∣ter or property of your fellow creatures"  Such is indeed the toleration which many praise or plead for and this I proceed to impugn by the following arguments  I Mens pleadings for it do all of them necessarily proceed on their adopting such  atheistical principles  as the following Mens natural or civil rights to their property liberty profits and honours are not ori∣ginally derived from Godand ought to protect them in their most outragious sinning against him Mens consciences have a right and authority unde∣rived from and independent of God by which it can warrant them to think and speak of or act to∣wards God as insolently and blasphemously as they please That if the law of God be any rule to men it is not so in respect of any intrinsic meaning affixed to it by him but merely as it is understood by every man particularly in that which relates to their behaviour towards God All men being ready to mistake we ought always to believe that our op∣ponents  may have as just a view of the scriptures as ourselves and never to condemn them for that which they do not own to be blasphemy idolatry or heresy Magistrates right and authority to govern others doth not originate in God as the Creator Preserver and King of nations but in magistrates themselves  or in their subjects  and so may be exercised as they please particularly in requiring or allowing their sub∣jects to belie blaspheme or rob God Magis∣trates may be moral governors deputies or lieutenants under God without having any power or authority relating to religion or his honour Not the law of God natural or revealed but the laws of nations ought to be the  supreme  standard of all civil govern∣ment Not the declarative glory of God as the Most High over all the earth but the civil peace and prosperity of nations ought to be the  chief end  of ma∣gistrates in all their acts of government Mens natural rights of conscience or their civil rights or the authority of magistrates may or ought to empow∣er warrant or protect them in gross heresy blasphe∣my idolatry or other outragious abuse and injury of God but can by no means warrant or protect them in calumny theft murder or any other injuries a∣gainst men There is no real difference between moral good and evil at least in things pertaining to God and so true and false religion are equally cal∣culated to promote the welfare of civil society and the virtues which render men good peaceable useful and honourable rulers or subjectsand hence here∣tics blasphemers and idolaters may be  good subjects  The favour or indignation of God is of no im∣portance to civil society and therefore magistrates ought to use no means to procure his favour by the encouragement of true religion or to avert his indig∣nation by the restraint of gross heresy blasphemy or idolatrybut only labour to procure the friendship of men and prevent their injuring the character pro∣perty or bodies of their subjectsThat all these propositions are  really atheistical  is manifest They all give up with the necessary existence infinite excel∣lency and absolute supremacy of God without any of which he cannot be God at allThat Locke  Hoadly Blackburn Voltaire and others advocates for  authoritative toleration  of false religion found their pleadings on the above propositions is no less e∣vident to every judicious and unbiassed observerNay did not modesty forbid I might defy all the world to plead for  such toleration  without taking all or some of the above or like atheistical propositions for granted  II The scriptures plainly represent magistrates granting of men an unrestrained freedom to profess and practise a false religion as extremely sinful and hurtful It is in the name of God to give a  li∣berty to the flesh  of which  heresics  and  idolatry  are the manifest and damning works Gal v with Rom viii It is not merely to  pity  and  spare  but to  encourage  such as seek to draw away their subjects from God contrary to Deut xiii Eph xiv Tim iii Pet ii In so doing magistrates as political shepherds not only suffer the flock of God the King of nations under their charge to  wander  or be  driven  from their fold and pasture but encourage them in itcontra∣ry to Ezek xxxiv Acts xx It marks a heavy judgment of God upon and an anarchy in a commonwealth when every man is left without restraint and doth that which is right in his own eyes in matters of religion Judges xvii Zech xi Chron xx Amos iv In granting  such liberty  magistrates are not for Christ by whom they rule Prov viii but against him in encouraging and protecting the doctrines and works of the devil which he came to destroy John viii Tim iv Rev xvi with John iii Zech xiii False religion eats out the true doctrine of Christ and the true piety and virtue which proceed from the faith of itwhich are like joints and bands to connect and establish a nati∣on Isa liii Tim ii Gal v Heresies produce  divisions  Cor xi make men  wanton filthy dreamers despisers  and  revilers  of magistrates Jude ver Pet ii they render times  perilous  and make men  traitors heady  high minded trucebreakers false accusers fierce with∣out natural affection despisers of those that are good  Tim iii They produce  envy strifes evil sur∣misings  and  perverse disputings  Tim vi Gal v they spoil Christ's vines Song ii False religion deprives a nation of God's protecting hedge of favourable providence and opens an inlet or the floods of destructive judgments Exod xxxii Ezek xiii and xxii Magistrates indulgence of a false religion is represented as  a kicking  at the true religion and  an honouring  of the corrupters  above God  and brings a charge of the wickedness upon the tolerators of it Hence Eli the judge of Israel is represented as  kicking at God's sacrifice honouring his  profane  sons  bove God  and  making himself fat  with God's portion of the sacrifices because he did not effectu∣ally re  orm his sons Sam ii Eph v and Nehemiah contended with the rulers of Judah for suffering the worship of God to be neglected and the Sabbath profaned Neh xiii Such indulgence of false or corrupt religion is represented as tending to make men abhor the true religion and speak evil of it Sam ii Pet ii  III The scriptures represent magistrates as having power to make civil laws relative to the external con∣cerns of religion subordinated to the law of God and answerable to their own department They have in charge the keeping of the whole law of God Deut xvii Kings ii Josh i Chron xxiii Job xxix Rom xiii It is never hinted that they have no charge with respect to religion but the contrary God chose Moses the magistrate not Aaron the Highpriest to publish his laws relative to religionAbijah avers that in maintaining the true worship of God he had kept the charge of the Lord which Jeroboam the introducer of a false reli∣gion had not Chron xiii God pro∣mised to the Jews good magistrates in order to root out abusive practices and monuments of false religion Isa i Now if they had power to root these out they had certainly power to make laws for that effect They ought to repeal wicked and perse∣cuting  laws and free their subjects from being bound over to punishment by them for their faithful service of God Psalm xciv Isa x Mic vi Hos v If they can repeal wicked laws they must have power to establish what is contrary to them Dan iii and vi If magistrates can make laws encou∣raging the true religion and church of Christ by an∣nexation of civil favours to the profession or practice of gospeltruth they can also by law annex civil pu∣nishment to the contempt of or rebellion against these laws they being for the  terror and punishment of evil doers  as well as for the  praise of them that do well  Rom xiii Pet ii Dan vi iii Ezra i vi vii By enacting such laws they neither invade the office of ecclesiastical rulers who have no power to connect civil rewards or punishments with any thing religiousnor do they transgress any law of GodWhat then can hinder their having power to make them If all sorts of men church members and officers as well as others be subject to civil magistrates they must have power and ought to make civil laws calcu∣lated to promote their advantage in all these stations Rom xiii Pet ii Tim ii Unless magistrates have a power to make good laws relative to the external profession and practice of religion clergymen if generally corrupt will have it in their power by Synodical constitutions or other∣wise to devour and poison their subjects with the seeds of confusion profaneness and every evil work without any possibility of any legal restraint For to allow magistrates to act without law is to introduce tyranny and arbitrary government  But in magistrates making laws respecting religion it is necessary that They first in order care∣fully acquaint themselves with the law of God that they may form all their laws in agreeableness and su∣bordination to itthey having no power against the truth but for it Deut xvii Josh i Psalm cxix Cor xiii They ought to consult with faithful ministers of the church either as met in Synods or otherwise as it may be expected they know the laws of God relative to reli∣gion  Deut xvii Mal ii Chron xv Thus in making these laws churchrulers help magistrates with their  direction  while magistrates help them with their  civil encouragements  Chron xix Ezek xliv They ought to require the ministers who are in their dominions faithfully to instruct their subjects in the whole coun∣sel of God contained in his word relative to those points of religion about which they intend to make laws that they may be thus prepared  willingly  to re∣ceive and obey themThus Jehoshaphat first sent  teachers  and then  judges  throughout his dominions Chron xvii xix In all matters of religion great care ought to be taken to establish the laws with and by the consent of the subjects or their re∣presentativesthus strengthening these laws through their binding men who are  willing  to obey themand the rather as the principal end of such laws is lost unless men willingly obey them Chron xv xx Jonah iii In these laws a special regard ought to be shewn to persons of a weak and tender conscience Political shepherds ought never to over drive their flock but to carry the lambs in their bosom And that the very weakest of their sub∣jects may be qualified to obey their laws they ought never to establish any thing in religion but what is  plainly  as well as  really  established by God in his lawthat so nothing may be contrary to their law but what is plainly contrary to God's law Ezek xxxiv  IV Though the law of God allows not of magis∣trates attempting to  force  men into the faith professi∣on or practice of the true religion or of their puni∣shing any thing relative to it which is not an open and manifest violation of the law of God and plainly de∣structive of the welfare of the commonwealthyet it requires them to  restrain  and even  seasonably  and  suitably  to  punish  blasphemy idolatry and like grosser corruptions and insults upon the true religion when they become openly notorious and especially if obsti∣nately continued in to the just offence and hurt of o∣thers Such  restraint  and  punishment  are repre∣sented in scripture as an eminent service done to God Exod xxxii Sam xv xviii  Rev xvii xix Song ii in which last text the word rendered TAKE ordinarily signifies an external and forcible taking compare Sam i Judges xii xvi Psalm cxxxix Exod iv Gen xxv xxii The end of God's ap∣pointment of magistrates is the GOOD of the subjects Rom xiv Now such corruptions in religion impair  that good  in preventing the spread and success of the gospel which are so exceedingly calculated to render men virtuous and happy even in this life Tim iv Pet iii Tit ii and in promoting the hurt of mens morals safety estate peace or li∣berty Rom i xvi Pet ii Jude ver Tim iv iii ii Tim iv vi Such re∣straint and punishment are represented in scripture as a  blessing  to be prayed for Tim ii and as a  blessing  for which God ought to be thanked Ezra vii Rev xi It is promised that such restraint and punishment should be produc∣ed by the effusion of the holy Ghost upon the Chris∣tian church Zech xii with xiii and that they should tend to the advantage even of some seducers who should be brought to account the in∣flicters their real FRIENDS Zech xiii The scripture represents EVIL as removed and GOOD both moral and civil as obtained by such restraints and punishments Deut xvii Kings xviii Chron xiv and wickedness and misery as overflowing a nation when neglec∣ted Eccl viii Judg xvii Sam ii and iv Ezek xxii When the proper judges neglected such restraint and punishment God raised up some in an extraordinary way to execu  e it Thus Elijah caused slay the pro∣phets of Baal Kings xviii Jehu caused slay o∣thers of them Kings x The Jews under the direction of Jehoiada slew Mattan the priest of Baal and Christ himself once and again drove the buyers and sellers out of the temple John ii Mat xxi Why ought not magistrates who are  his vicegerents as God to imitate his conduct Psal lxxxii Chron xix Rom xiii The scripture affords many approven instances of such restraint or punishment of gross corruptions in religi∣on as by Jacob Gen xxxv by the judges in the time and country of Job Job xxxi by Mo∣ses Exod xxxii by the rulers of the ten tribes Josh xxii by Asa Chron xv by Jehoshaphat Chron xix by Josiah Chron xxxiv Kings xxiii by Nehemiah Neh x by Nebuchadnezzar Dan iii by Artaxerxes Ezra vii and by the Pro∣testant destroyers of Antichrist Rev xvii  V Beside their power as men to try all things by the law of God manifested to them and their power of Christian discretion if they are Christians to judge by the word of God what is for their own spiri∣tual and eternal advantage magistrates as such have a power of POLITICALLY judging and determining what and how principles and practices of  the true re∣ligion  are to be connected with political rewards or encouragements or what ought to be professed and practised by persons as members of their political so∣ciety in order to promote the real welfare of it in subordination to the glory of God as King of nati∣ons If they may enact laws in the matters of God as hath been proven and may judge in what is fundamental in religionor in that which is con∣tained in express words of scriptureor in matters of the second table of the moral lawthen they must have power to judge of that which is plainly deducible from the express words of scripture by necessary con∣sequenceand in those matters of the first table of the moral law which as much belong to the law of nature as any in the secondhave power politi∣cally to judge why and how such a religious profes∣sion and practice is to be encouraged by the civil au∣thority and how and why that which is notorious∣ly opposite to the true religion is to be discouraged Without this  political  judging of them magis∣trates could never determine Whether the decisions of ecclesiastical courts ought to be ratisied by their ci∣vil authority or not Thess v Acts xvii If  in judging of those things magistrates improve the Word the Spirit and the faithful ministers of God for their counsellors they bid fair to have a  divine sentence in their lips and not to err in judgment  Deut xvii Psal cxix Prov xvi Isa xxxii If neglecting to consult these magis∣trates give a corrupt sentence they ly open to the judgment of Godto the restraint and correction of the collective body of the subjects or their represen∣tativesand also to ecclesiastical censure if they be churchmembers If magistrates be  nursing fa∣thers  to the Christian church Isa xlix they ought to prevent her being poisoned with corrupt food and hence must have a power  politically  to judge what is corrupt and what is not If the magistrate be the keeper of the peace of the kingdom then if a party in the church complaining of the gross errors of the other should form a furious schism he must have power  politically  to judge who is in the right or in the wrongwho adhere to the truths established by law and who do notand to shew favour accor∣dingly Thess v If magistrates may re∣strain and punish evil doers they may exercise this power over church officers if in their Synods they make blasphemous or idolatrous decrees which tend to disturb the commonwealth and dishonour God the King of nationsand hence must  politically  judge of their conduct by the laws of God and the landNo covenanted subjection to church judica∣tures as a member of the church can deprive them of this  political  judgment any more than of their right of  cognition  and  discretion  as men and Christians Ma∣gistrates  political  judgment how principles or practi¦ces are to be connected with civil encouragements or discouragements is no infallible rule of church courts judging how principles and practices ought to be connected with ecclesiastical encouragements or cen∣sures nor are the decisions of ecclesiastical courts any infallible rule to direct magistrates But the law of God is the  only infallible  and  supreme  rule to both Nor is the decision of the one  subordinate  to that of the other but both as well as every man's right to judge for himself according to the law of God what he is  to believe and practise in order to his own peace and comfort and his joyful answering in the final judg∣ment of God are  supreme  in their respective depart∣ments subordinated only to the judgment of God himselfBut to argue the matter still more particularly  If magistracy conscience and human rights natural and civil be all  derived from God  as all but Atheists must allow magistrates can have no more power  authoritatively  to tolerate sin than God him∣self can command it If God by virtue of the infinite perfection of his nature have no will no power  au∣thoritatively  to proclaim liberty to commit sin he can∣not communicate any such power to the magistrate Nor can the magistrate account to God for exceeding his power in licensing that which is infinitely injurious to him more than the British king's Lionkeeper hath power or could be accountable for loosing and hunt∣ing out the lions in the Tower upon His Majesty If conscience derive all its power from God it can have no more power to enjoin any thing sinful than Lord North hath to hire ruffians to assassinate his Sovereign If all human rights be derived from God the prima∣ry and supreme proprietor of all things it is impossi∣ble they can  authorize  men to contrive or commit any thing sinful or can  protect  them in it  Mens state in this world is neither  separated  nor  separable  from but closely connected with their eter∣nal state And magistracy is an  ordinance of God  ap∣pointed by him for his own glory and to promote the chief end of mankind in glorifying him Rom xiii Prov xvi Cor x Pet iv Rom xii But how Sir do magistrates promote this end if they give the same  degree of protection  though per∣haps not of encouragement to the soulruining and practicecorrupting delusions and abominations of Satan as they do the eternally saving religion of God and his Christif they give the same countenance to them who to the corruption of mens moral beha∣viour and their eternal damnationdefame Jeho∣vah to them as  mere matter  a  mere man  a  mere crea∣ture  a  worker of contradiction and nonsense  as they do to those who faithfully proclaim his infinite ex∣cellencies  and glorious works of redemption publish his truths and promote the present and future holi∣ness and happiness of mankindIf God chiefly aim at the glorifying of himself in the advancement of the kingdom of Christ how can magistrates who are appointed by him as his vicegerents for promot∣ing his glory on earth be allowed far less obliged by him to exert their power as much for protecting or promoting the kingdom of the devil as for the ad∣vancement of the kingdom of Christ Indeed magis∣trates are not the deputies of Christ as mediator but they are of God Father Son and Holy Ghost and all their administrations are by him subjected to Christ as  "Head over all things to his church"  Prov viii Mat xxviii Eph i Why then ought they not to concur with God in advanc∣ing the kingdom of Christ especially as this mightily promotes the temporal as well as the eternal welfare of their subjects Prov xiv Isa i iii Psal cxii cxxvii cxxviii  Magistrates are expresly represented in scripture  as ministers of God for good to men  rulers deputed by and under him Rom xiii But how can they be  ministers deputies  or  vicegerents  of God without having power to restrain and  if proper  and  seasonable  to punish that which openly affronts and horridly in∣sults himblasphemously gives him the lie basely misrepresents him or devotes the worship due to him to his adversary the devilor any other crimes which immediately strike against himIf they be God's ministers they must transact all their magis∣tratical managements in his nameand how can God empower  his own ministers  as such and acting in his name to promote his highest dishonour licen∣sing encouraging and protecting gross heresy blas∣phemy and idolatrygiving as much encourage∣ment to the vilest delusions of Satan as to the new Testament in Jesus bloodHow can they be mini∣sters of God for good to men without having power to restrain such as like wolves and murderers go a∣bout corrupting the principles and practices and de∣stroying the sons of his and their subjects How can  they be ministers of God the father of spirits  for good universal good  to men who are not brutes but endowed with precious and immortal souls which are more beneficial in commonwealths than their bodies without having power to promote the cultivation and welfare of souls as a means of promoting the happi∣ness of that state How can they be ministers of God  for good to men  if they have power only to punish these crimes which strike immediately against their bodies or external property but no power to punish crimes as they provoke God's wrath against the na∣tionif they have power to restrain the petty thief robber or other less hurtful thingsbut none to prevent the kindling of God's wrath against the nati∣on and the debauching of mens consciences and mo∣rals by blasphemy heresy idolatry  c  which may quickly do more real mischief to a nation than ten thousand thieves or robbers could doAfter God hath expresly commanded to punish murderers as  destroyers of his image  Gen ix have his mini∣sters no power to punish murder as a destruction of his rational creatures or a sacrificing them to devils Psal cvi If murder ought to be punished as an injury and dishonour to God why not also public blasphemy idolatry and heresy obstinately continu∣ed in  Magistrates are appointed of God for the  terror  and  punishment of evil doers  and for the  praise of them that do well  Rom xiii Pet ii And are not Sir idolaters blasphemers profaners of the Sab∣bath by teaching of damnable errors or practising of abominable idolatries on it  evil doers  in God's ac∣count as well as revilers of men thieves traitors murderers  c  Are not heresies and idolatries ex∣presly declared by him  damning works of the fleshevil deeds  Gal v Thess ii Rev xiv Are not heretical teachers declared  evil workers  Phil iii Tit i It must there∣fore necessarily follow that magistrates are appointed by God not to be licensers protectors and encou∣ragers but to be terrors to and punishers of them as is  suitable  and  seasonable  The power which magistrates have as  ministers of God for good  to men ought to be so exercised as most effectually conduceth to make all their subjects live a quiet and peaceable life in all GODLINESS and honesty and make all men come to the saving know∣ledge of the truth Tim ii But how Sir can their  authoritative  allowing or protecting of men in ungodliness blasphemy and idolatry pro∣mote such an end Hath not God himself testified that heresies as well as blasphemy and idolatry  as a canker  eat out the doctrine which is according to godliness and  increase unto more and more ungodliness  and make men  worse and worse  till they be monstrous∣ly wicked Tim ii iv iii Thess ii Tim iv vi Pet ii Rom i If magistrates protect and encourage obstinate seducers in blasphem∣ing God reproaching his Son as a mere creature or as an impostor or in furiously rending his well com∣pacted body the church or in corrupting the princi∣ples and morals and ruining the souls of neighbours children or servants how can such as are truly se∣rious and ardently zealous for God fail to have their righteous souls vexed from day to day with the dam∣nable doctrines and filthy conversation of these wick∣ed Psal cxix lxix Pet ii To truly zealous saints a  den of thieves  is not a more grievous neighbour than a  Synagogue of Sa∣tan  All magistrates ruling over men must  be just ruling in the fear of the Lord  Sam xxiii But how can they be  just  if they dispose of  that protection  or  encouragement  to that which dishonours and provokes God to the highest saps the foundation of all true virtue and natively produces the most ruinous prac∣tices  which is due  to that doctrine worship and practice which is  according to godliness  and promotes glory honour immortality eternal life How can they rule  in the fear of God  if in their magistratical administrations they shew no regard to that religion by which his declarative glory is advanced but instead thereof license protect and encourage that which infinitely dishonours and offends him  The fourth commandment the obligation of which is certainly moral and  perpetually binding  on magistrates as well as on heads of families commands them to cause the weekly Sabbath to be sanctified by all  within their gates  i e all their subjects Exod xx Jer xvii And to this the approven example of Nehemiah corresponds Neh xiii Now if magistrates cannot answer to God for en∣couraging or protecting their subjects in their  civil bu∣siness  which is of itself lawful and usefulon the the Sabbathhow will they account to him for pro∣tecting and encouraging men in teaching  blasphemous errors  or practising  abominable idolatries  on that day How can this commandment bind them to restrain what is in itself lawful and usefuland yet bind them not to restrain but  allow encourage  and  protect  that which is in itself infinitely dishonourable to God their superior and ruinous to his and their subjects in both temporal and eternal interestsOr dare you pretend that the observance of the weekly Sab∣bath depends one whit less on Revelation than the doctrine of the Trinity of persons in the Godhead doth  If magistrates have power on proper occasions to appoint  religious fasts  as means of turning away God's wrath and of procuring or obtaining his bles∣sings to their commonwealth as it is certain yourself and perhaps every advocate for  authoritative toleration  acknowledge Jonah iii Sam vii Chron xx Ezra viii Neh ix Jer xxxvi they cannot but have power to e∣stablish that religion and  only that religion  which an∣swers to those ends and to restrain that damnable he∣resy blasphemy and idolatry which provoke God's wrath against his subjects To command their sub∣jects to mourn over the grounds of his anger and sup∣plicate his favour while at the same time they encou∣raged and protected them in gross heresy public blas∣phemy and idolatry than which nothing can more provoke his indignation would be fearful dissimu∣lation with the Most High Psalm lxvi Ezek xiv If magistrates have power to appoint a Christian fast and to punish the public contemners  of it or of their authority in appointing itHow can they but have power to establish the true Christi∣an religion and to punish  if seasonable  the public and insolent contemners and corrupters of it and despi∣sers of their authority in establishing itDare you pretend that the upright profession and practice of the Christian religion is less calculated to promote the happiness of a nation in subordination to the honour of God than an occasional fast Or that a Christian fast can be observed without entering into the very marrow of the doctrines of Revelationor that ma∣gistrates ought merely to require the day to be obser∣ved in fasting leaving the manner and object of the worship wholly to the choice of their subjectsrecom∣mending the worship of devils as much as that of Je∣hovah and supposing the one as able and ready to avert calamities and bestow necessary blessings as the other If you pretend that God rewarded Ahab or the Nine∣vites for worshipping their idols you must prove that God is so far from being highly displeased with ido∣latry as himself often declares Deut xxxii Judges ii Kings xvii Psalm cvi Jer xlviii l  c  that he is ready to accept and reward the worship of idols de∣vils bulls dogs cats saints leeks onions conse∣crated wafers  c  if men be sincere in it Rare doctrine this for a Presbyterian clergyman of this  enlightened age  If every parent or master ought for the welfare of his family in subordination to the honour of the God of all families to establish the true religion in it Gen xviii Josh xxiv to remove idols out of it G  n xxxv and to refuse seducing he∣reties a lodging in it John x And if accor∣ding to this injunction and those approved examples he ought to extrude a seducer who had entered or even a member of the family who obstinately en∣deavoured to corrupt the rest with damnable error blasphemy or idolatryin order to prevent the in∣fection of the family and hinder the destructive wrath of God from falling on themWhy must not ma∣gistrates who are  God's ministers for good  be allowed  power and authority to establish and promote the true Christian religion in their  large political families  and to repress or exclude notorious murderers of souls and kindlers of the wrath of God The relation of a parent or master is  no more spiritual  than that of a magistrate makes no man either member or officer of Christ's mystical body any more than magistracy dothAnd I dare defy all the Tolerants on earth to point out one thing relative to religion competent to masters and parents as such but magistrates may do what is similar or to prove that the true know∣ledge faith profession and practice of revealed religi∣on is one whit less necessary and useful in common∣wealths than in families  If the power of ecclesiastical rulers extends to all the  civil transactions  of  churchmembers  all the  ma∣gistratical  and  military managements  of kings or empe∣rors not excepted in so far as they are regulated by the law of Christ and are immediately connected with his honour and the good of his churchthere is e∣qual reason that the power of magistrates should ex∣tend to religious matters in so far as they are con∣nected with the welfare of the state in subordination to the honour of God as King of nations No rea∣son can be assigned why the vicegerents of God should as such act as atheists regardless of religion any more than the messengers of Christ Nor till it be proven that God the King of nations is more inclined to damnable heresy blasphemy and idola∣latry than Christ the Head of the church can it be possible to prove that magistrates have one whit more power  authoritatively  to license encourage or pro∣mise them protection than churchrulers havethough as the church is a  select holy society  called out of the world which lieth in wickedness founded on and having all her adult members instructed by the revelation of Christ the same degree of forbearance to censure in the church as to punish in the state is by no means proper  Unless true and false religion be equally calcu∣lated to render men  good subjects or magistrates  and to promote the peace and prosperity of common∣wealths in subordination to the honour of God as  King of nations they can never deserve or lawfully enjoy equal encouragement protection or libertyBut the true religion  exalteth a nation  Prov xiv renders it  quiet and prosperous  Chron xiv it teacheth men to  deny ungodliness and worldly

Rev xi "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ"  Even the law of nature plainly requires That magistrates maintain and promote the honour of that God who gave them all their power and authoritythat God who is the original and supreme proprie∣tor and Sovereign of nations and societies and the allsufficient source of all their happinessthat they govern their subjects not as if they were dogs  or swine having nothing but their bodies to care for but as men endowed with rational and immortal soulsthat as righteousness exalteth a nation and sin is the reproach of any people they should exercise their whole power and authority as is best calculated to make all their subjects behave most agreeably to the law and declarative glory of God and most

obey itthat if magistrates ought to restrain and punish gross im∣moralities they ought to restrain that error or wor∣ship which being a manifestly damning work of the flesh natively leads men into

ought to be restrainedIf heresy blasphe∣my and idolatry established or authoritatively tolerat∣ed eminently and notoriously provoke God to punish nations with sword famine pestilence poverty de∣cay of trade desolation captivity or the like as they have often done even among Heathens Common sense requires That every magistrate from regard to the welfare of his subjects ought to restrain them as far as his circumstances can prudently permitinstead of giving them as much liberty encouragement or protection as he gives to the religion of Jesus Christ which hath the promises of this life and of that which is to come Tim iv Titus iii Proverbs xiv  If Sir as you pretend magistrates ought to tolerate heresy idolatry and blasphemythen a pow∣er and office derived from God ought to be employed and executed in encouraging the most shocking dis∣honours and outrage against himthe authority of God placed in and exercised by magistrates ought to be set in opposition to his own  immediate  authority

of his Son and to introduce the most accursed and damnable er∣rors into their place in his churchought to give the devil and his agents as much countenance and as∣sistance in driving men to hell as they give to Jesus Christ and his faithful servants in leading them to hea∣venought to give a company of wizards as much countenance and protection in worshipping the de∣vil and his angels as a society of precious saints wor∣shipping the Lord and his Christ in the beauty of holinessIn short  authoritative tolerations  of he∣resy blasphemy or idolatry are solemn proclamations issued forth by the deputies of God in his name bear∣ing that Satan and his emissaries have full liberty grant∣ed them to cast forth their floods of error and every abomination that proceeds from it for the dishonour of God and the temporal and eternal destruction of men Nor for ought I know have they ever ne∣glected to improve their opportunity as the issues of the tolerations granted by Cromwell K James VII and

oblige conscience to these actings or take any cognizance of them They cannot free it from any guilt contracted by them or reward it if it doth well or punish or censure it if it doth amiss Nor are their constituti∣ons but God's law the standard by which it shall be judged at the last dayBut they may make laws or constitutions which as originating from subordi∣nated to and adopted and ratisied by the law of God bind men to obey for conscience sake Rom xiii Mat xviii God's being the only Lawgiver of men under the Old Testament as much as now did not hinder Moses David Asa Jehoshaphat He∣zekiah Josiah Nehemiah Nebuchadnezzar the Chal∣dean Darius the Mede Cyrus Darius and Artaxer∣xes Persians or the king of Nineveh to make civil laws in favours of the true religion If God alone be the Lawgiver and Lord of the conscience it nece∣ssarily follows that magistrates and conscience who are his deputies can have no power to warrant li∣cense or protect any thing forbidden by his law Cor xiii  OBJECT II  "Every man hath a natural right to judge for himself what he ought to do or forbear especially in religion He is to be fully persuaded in his own mind and to follow the dictates of his own conscience Even the law of God is a rule to him as he understands it in his own conscience To force  any man to do any thing contrary to his conscience is to force him to sin for whatsoever is not of saith is sin and to punish him for following the dictates of his conscience is to punish him for doing his duty"  ANSW Already you have made mens consci∣ence the supreme governor of their actions exalting it above The Most High GOD Every man hath a natural right derived from God to  judge all things by the law of God and hold fast that which is good  Thess v He hath a right to judge by the law of God what is necessary to be professed and practised in order to the peace of his conscience and his fellow∣ship with and receiving of favours from God But that no more hinders magistrates  politically  to judge what profession and practice are proper for men as members of such a particular commonwealthor what relative to religion is to be connected with civil encouragements or discouragementsthan it hinders churchrulers ecclesiastically to judge and define what profession or practice is necessary in order to comfortable fellowship with such a particular church Mens conscience is no Lawgiver at all but a  witness  of their conduct and a  judge  which enquires into the meaning of God's law and directs according∣lyand which compares their qualities profession and practice with the law of God and if faithful approves or disapproves accordingly The law of God not men's conscience is their  supreme and on∣ly insallible rule  which binds even conscience itself Mark xii John v and whatever men do con∣trary to it is sinful let their conscience approve it as much as they will John iii Lev v Acts xxvi Tim i Whatever pro∣ceeds not from the persuasion of a good conscience founded on the word of God is sin It is a sin for mens conscience to err in dictating any thing not per∣fectly agreeable to the law of GodHow absurd to pretend that this fin can render another sin duty or a duty sinful in itself If mens conscience in itself or in its directing persuading or instigating influence be sustained as the immediate rule of their conduct without respect to the word of God then either their conscience must be  insallible  in its dictates  which it certainly is not in either saints or sinners in this world Rom vii Prov xxviii Jer xvii Rom viii Tit i or if it be  fallible  God must have established for men a  fallible  and  de∣ceitful rule  of  truth  and  holiness  and so be the author of confusion in religion since different consciences dictate different things in itTo make mens con∣science their rule in religion would make God the au∣thor and commander of wickednessby conscience requiring the transgression of his own lawIt would make him not only acquit from criminality but ap∣prove as duty the most damnable errors horrid blasphe∣mies detestable abominations and cruel barbarities if but dictated by the consciences of Heathens Maho∣tans Papists  c  in their religionIt would make him the author of mens ruin if it were procured by a way which seemed right in their own eyes Prov xvi It would render it absolutely impossible to convince men of the sinfulness of any thing they had done according to the dictates of their conscience be it ever so contrary to the law of God It would ren∣der it improper for men to repent of or mourn over any blasphemy murder of saints or the like which their deluded conscience had dictated to them or to ask receive or praise God for the pardoning of it contrary to Tim i with Acts xxvi Gal i Phil iii It would open a wide gap for mens doing whatever they pleased without being chargeable by at least any man for itIf men should be executed for the most horrid blasphemy or abo∣minable idolatry high treason or any other deed dic∣tated by their conscience they would die martyrs for righteousness sakeAnd men ought to believe what∣ever their conscience dictated to them concerning their state experience or duty however contrary to the testimony of God contained in his wordcontrary to Psalm iii xvi xlii Rev iii To pretend that the law of God not in itself but  as understood by mens conscience  is their rule is absurd It in the Popish manner represents the law of God as destitute of sense and authority in itself and as deriving it from a creature It in the Quake∣rish manner makes the  light within  the rule of mens  conduct It exalts every man to an equality with or rather superiority above God having power to give regulating sense and authority to his word ac∣cording as an erroneous and defiled conscience pleas∣eth It abolisheth every real standard of religion eve∣ry man's particular apprehensions of the meaning of God's word being his binding rule The same word of God becomes the standard of  Calvinism Popery Socinianism  c as different men understand it It saps the foundation of all mutual trust and confidence among men and opens a wide inlet for all manner of villany and dissimulation According to it mens pro∣mises oaths vows and covenantstheir sworn and subscribed Creeds Articles Confessions Formulas  c  bind them not according to the common mean∣ing of the wordsbut according to the meaning which their conscience however seared biassed or deluded puts upon them In fine it plunges men into the depths of Atheism according to which every man be∣lieves and acts what is right in his own eyes If mens private judgment of their own acts hindered the magistrates supreme  political  judgment no laws could be made in matters of religion or any thing else as some would be readily of a different mind even in the fundamentals of religion and virtueWhile some believed that Christ was not true God or true man or that idols might be worshipped others would believe that oaths might be lawfully violated heretical princes assassinated or women and goods used in com∣mon If other mens private judgment be allow∣ed to be their supreme rule and reason of conduct it will necessarily follow that magistrates private judg∣ment must be the rule of their conduct and that they ought to make and execute such laws as they believe in their own heart to be proper be they as ar∣bitrary and tyrannical as they will It is not with mens conscience and its judgment in religion any more than in matters of common honesty that ma∣gistratical authority intermeddles but with their ex∣ternal words and deeds It only restrains and punish∣eth such of those as are  manifestly contrary to the laws of God and the land  and  as they are hurtful to the com∣monwealth  and  the public honour of God as King of na∣tions  If all proper means of conviction be us∣ed with men who obstinately persist in gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry without effect their mistake doth not arise from a conscience regulating duty but from one stiffened against duty And it is perhaps sometimes as difficult to convince a hardened thief robber or adulterer of his mistake as it is to convince a hardened heretic Men are punishable not for what their conscience as the deputy of God dictates but for what they would not have done if they had any proper conscience of duty If men sloth∣fully and especially wilfully refuse to use the means of ealightening their conscience by the word of God they but add to their crimes both before God and men by pretending conscience Mens conscience being as much a director in their conduct towards men as in their conduct towards God its influence must have as much force to keep them from accountableness  men for their theft murder calumny as for their gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry  OBJECT III  "To allow magistrates such power of judging and of making and executing laws about religious matters is to render Christians the  servants of men  contrary to Cor vii "  ANSW If so Christ himself rendered his redeemed favourites  servants of men  under the Old Testament If so church rulers being men as well as magistrates their restraints and censures appointed by Christ himself must as much render Christians  servants of men  Nay to comply with the religious orders of families would make them  servants of men  Servilely to comply with the vain fancies humours sinful lusts or laws of men particularly in religion is to be the  ser∣vants  of men in the sense of this text but to comply with scriptural restraints censures or punishments of wickedness is to act as  servants of Christ  and his Father and Spirit  OBJECT IV  "To restrain men from what they think right in religion and especially to punish them for it is contrary to that Christian charity which  suffereth long and is kindenvieth notthinketh no e∣vil beareth all things believeth all things and hopeth all things  Cor xlii contrary to that meek∣ness  mercy and peaceableness exemplified in Christ and required in Christians Rom xv Gal vi Eph iv Tim ii James iii "  ANSW Christian charity rejoiceth  not in iniquity  but rejoic∣eth  in the truth  It requires that nothing should be done out of malice or envy or rashly on bare surmi∣ses or without due examination of facts and circum∣stances but not that rulers either of church or state should overlook every scandal or crime contrary to the law of God Even the undue delay of censure or punishment encourageth men in wickedness much more would the total overlooking of it Eccl viii The texts quoted in the objection are directed to Christians and churchrulers Is therefore all their holy zeal and activity in restraining and censuring the corrupters of the church according to Christ's com∣mand Rev ii Rom xvi Gal v Tit iii Tim i contrary to Christian charity meekness or mercifulness Had Moses quite abandoned his un∣paralelled meekness when he so zealously punished the Hebrew idolaters Num xxxii with Exod xxxii Was Jesus Christ destitute of all meekness and mercy when he appointed the restraints and pe∣nalties under the old Testament and at least the tre∣menduous censure of excommunication under the new Was he destitute of all charity meekness and mercy in never giving us a hint that these laws are now repealed as having been cruel and tyrannical Was he desti∣tute of all charity meekness and mercy when the zeal of his Father's house did eat him upwhen he repea∣tedly drove the buyers and sellers from the temple John ii Mat xxi  OBJECT V  "Even under the law Moses tole∣rated mens divorcing of their wives for slight causes Much more doth the gospel dispensation call for liber∣ty to men"  ANSW It is blasphemous to pretend that the gospeldispensation allows any more liberty to fin than the legal did Must the grace of God be turned into lasciviousness Jude ver Gal v To prevent worse consequences Moses directed a deliberate and solemn manner of divorce which ten∣ded to render divorces less frequent or irregular but never warranted divorce for slight causes Per∣haps  you cannot prove that the perpetual continu∣ance of marriage relation flows as necessarily from the nature of God as gross heresy blasphemy and ido∣latry are contrary to it God therefore might sovereign∣ly dispense with the one though not with the other This objection is rather calculated to prove that magistrates should license or tolerate murder adul∣tery theft and other sins against the second table of the moral law than that they should tolerate heresy blasphemy and idolatry which pertain to the first table  OBJECT VI  "Gamaliel's counsel  "Refrain from these men and let them alone for if this work be of men it will come to nought but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it"  was certainly prudent and Gallio's conduct who cared for no disputes relative to religion Acts v xviii "  ANSW Prove that Gamaliel's speech was inspired as a rule to us in all religious disputes or that magistrates or others ought to be mere scep∣tics in religion That which Gamaliel pled to be let alone was evidently good calculated to pro∣mote the welfare of both church and state and so ought to have had the utmost encouragement from him and his fellow rulers Prove if you can that the Holy Ghost approves Gallio's carelessness or that magistrates like him ought to allow parties at the bar to beat one another  OBJECT VII  "Under the gospel it is promised That men should beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and that there should be none to hurt or destroy in God's holy moun∣tain Isa ii Micah iv "  ANSW These texts import that quarrelsome dispositions and inju∣rious slaughter of men should be remarkably restrain∣ed by the gospel but not that magistrates should no more  bear the sword  or be  terrors  to and  punishers  of evil doers Rom xiii Pet ii they no more import that magistrates should not restrain or  seasonably  or  suitably  punish blasphemy and idola∣try than that they should not restrain theft or mur∣der The restraint or punishment we plead for being God's institution cannot hurt but profit men  making many fear and avoid such horrible wicked∣ness Deut xvii nay sometimes do much good to the restrained and punished persons Zech xiii If heretics blasphemers and idolaters be as mis∣chievous persons as above described from the oracles of God the restraint of them is a necessary mean to secure the peace of nations and churches If such scorners be cast out contention strife and reproach are repressed Prov xxii  OBJECT VIII  "Our Saviour commands his ser∣vants to let the  tares  grow with the wheat Mat xiii "  ANSW He rather represents that till the last judgment the righteous should never be fully sepa∣rated from the wicked If it were a command it is given to church rulers rather than to magistrates and so might with more apparent propriety be pled in favours of ecclesiastical toleration of heretics ido∣laters blasphemers If these  tares  mean only hypocrites who have a visible appearance of holiness or innocency we plead that neither magistrates nor ministers ought to attempt plucking them up If they mean all the  children of the devil  as ver your ob∣jection ought honestly to plead that no crimes of theft murder  c  manifesting them to be such ought to be restrained or punished  OBJECT IX  "By rebuking his disciples who would have commanded fire from heaven to consume those Samaritans who refused him lodging in his way to Jerusalem and by his declaring That he came  not to destroy mens lives but to save  them Luke ix our benevolent Saviour plainly intimated That under the gospel magistrates ought to lay no restraint on heresy blasphemy or idolatry"  ANSW As these Samaritans did not live under magistrates or laws which established the true religion it is not pled that even their gross heresy blasphemy or ido∣latry however notorious and obstinate could have been regularly punishable by men They were in this matter guilty of no heresy blasphemy or idolatryor of attempting to seduce or disturb Christ or his dis∣ciplesbut merely of not giving lodging to a mean∣like Jew of whose Messiahship they had but little if any information or proof Though the Samari∣tans  had been guilty of gross heresy blasphemy and ido∣latry publicly and obstinately professed and practised contrary to the civil laws of the country and been re∣gularly punishableChrist's disciples being no ma∣gistrates in that place had no right to call them to ac∣count The disciples never sought to have the contempt shown to themselves and their Master pu∣nished by the civil law but by the  miraculous vengeance of God  Without any warrant from God and to gra∣tify their own proud passionate and revengeful tem∣per they would have required him to work a miracle for the destruction of these poor ignorant SamaritansSo if you will drag in this text it ought to be to prove That neither God nor ministers ought to restrain heretics blasphemers or idolaters While Christ was in his debased state obeying and suffering for the salvation of mankind it would have been extremely improper for God visibly to punish every slight put upon him But his coming to  save men  with an everlasting salvation can no more infer that he came to protect criminals from just punish∣ment by men than that he came to save obstinate un∣believers from hell He came to  save mens lives  by saving them from their sins not by protecting and warranting them in a public and obstinate commission of them There is no hint in scripture that he who was manifested to destroy the works of the devil came to procure men a liberty of conscience or a ma∣gistratical licence or protection in public and gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry more than in theft murder adultery It would be highly blasphemous to suppose it  OBJECT X  "Christ requires us not to judge othersto judge nothing before the time Mat vii Cor iv We ought to believe our own opi∣nions in religion to be as probably erroneous as those of our opponents and if they do not acknowledge themselves heretics blasphemers or idolaters we ought never to hold them such or plead for their being restrai∣ned as such"  ANSW We must never rashly or uncharitably judge others or judge their hearts and intentions which God alone knoweth But that will no more infer that magistrates ought to give no judg∣ment  about religious matters than that magistrates and ministers should judge of nothing at all respecting either God or men but encourage every person to live as his inclinations direct him Is there in∣deed no certainty in religion If men ought to be  complete Sceptics  in it why not as well  downright ath∣eists  If mens own acknowlegments be sustained as the standard of our judgment concerning them what rare work must ensue None ought to be held blasphemers heretics or idolaters till they have be∣come penitent convicts None ought to be held thieves murderers calumniators  c  till they acknowledge themselves such All impenitent criminals must thus escape every degree of infamy restraint or punishment  OBJECT XI  "Men ought to be  persuaded  not  forced  into faith and holiness It is in vain to attempt rooting out corruptions especially in religion out of mens outward behaviour unless they be first rooted out of their hearts"  ANSW It re∣quires no small share of  ignorance impudence  and  fraud  to insinuate that the many thousands of Pro∣testant advocates for the magistrates power to restrain gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry plead for the FOR∣CING of men to faith and holiness when they so har∣moniously plead for the contrary None ought to be forced into the faith and profession of the true religion as hath been repeatedly declared but all proper methods taken to render their compliance ju∣dicious and voluntary Yet that will not infer that no man ought to be restrained from or even  suitably  and  seasonably  punished for open and gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry which while they publicly op∣pose insult and undermine the true religionpro∣duce terrible immoralities and disorders in churches and nations and draw upon them the ruinous ven∣geance of Godand far less will it infer that ma∣gistrates as vicegerents of God ought in his name and authority to  license  a false religion and promise men protection and encouragement in it No magis∣trate hath power to force me to esteem love delight in sympathize with maintain or even commend my neighbour But he hath power to refuse me a warrant to calumniate rob or murder him and even  to restrain or punish me for so doing It would be absurd to attempt forcing of the British Jacobites to believe and solemnly profess that K George not the Pretender is rightful Sovereign of this kingdom But would it therefore be absurd to restrain and punish them for publicly and insolently reviling him as an u∣surperor seducing their fellow subjects to dethrone himor for taking arms against him or paying his just revenues to the Pretender It is certain that Christ who hath power over the hearts of all men curbed the external corruptions of the Jewish buyers and sellers in the temple without first casting the corruptions out of their heart And pray would you have all thieves robbers murderers  c  to have full liberty in their courses till their wickedness can be got rooted out of their heart  OBJECT XII  "Such is the reasonableness and the glory of divine truths that if they be but freely clearly and distinctly preached their native lusire will render them victorious over every error and corrup∣tion in religion however boldly published or craftily varnished What a singular advantage hath it been to Britain that Deists have had full freedom to make their attacks upon the Christian religion and so to occasion so many glorious defences of it"  ANSW Did not God under the Old Testament know the conquering power of his truth as well as you do Did not Christ know it when he drove the buyers and sellers from the temple Did the inexpressibly amiable and edifying conduct of Jesus Christ the way the truth and the life render him the universal the fixed DARLING of the Jewish nation among whom he went about doing good You dare not pretend it And yet it is certain that examples do more affect than instructions You must not only with Pelagi∣ans deny original sin but effectually disprove it be∣fore your objection can have any sense in itWhile men are so blinded by Satan and their own lusts and so full of enmity against God they cannot but be much more disposed to receive and practise error than to discern embrace and practise gospeltruths however clearly and faithfully preached Cor ii Rom viii Cor iv Isa liii vi  The common experience of every one who attempt  to instruct children and servants in the truths of God even when they are young and their minds most un∣biassed irrefragably demonstrates that almost any thing is more readily embraced than the plain truths of the gospel and that earnest prayers serious admo∣nitions external encouragements and Christian nur∣ture have all enough and too often more than e∣nough of work to make men learn them If pro∣fessed Christians by encouraging others in gross error and wickedness provoke God to give up themselves to strong delusions that they may believe lies will the native lustre of divine truths then enlighten and cap∣tivate them Farvery far from it Thess ii Tim iii iv If we do evil in licensing encouraging or protecting the free propa∣gation of gross errors that good reputation may be thereby occasioned our damnation is just Romans iii Few of those boasted  glorious desenders of Christianity  are real and thorough friends to the gospel of Christ but often proceed upon the Arminian and sometimes the Socinian scheme the last of which is as bad if not worse than Heathenism itselfAnd it is certain that TENS if not HUNDREDS have been seduced by deistical publications for every ONE that has been been converted from Deism by almost all these defences of the Christian religion  OBJECT XIII  "Christ hath appointed for his church rulers of her own who govern her in every duty of religion"  ANSW This can no more prove that magistrates ought to make and execute no laws respecting the duties required by the first table of the moral law than it will prove that they ought to make no laws respecting duties of the second tablesince churchrulers are as much authorized by God to govern in the one as in the other Let magistrates and churchrulers be allowed to govern their distinct departments in their different manner in the very same things and nothing but harmony order and advantage will ensue Magistrates as well as church rulers are divinely denominated  Rulers Watchmen Shepherds  and therefore ought  politically  to direct govern and feed their subjects as members  of the commonwealth by making and executing wholsome laws relative to both tables of God's lawwhile ministers  ecclesiastically  feed them as  members of the visible church  by preaching the gospel admini∣string the sacraments and exercising church govern∣ment and discipline Tim ii Rom xiii Chron xiii xvii xix Neh xiii Ezek xxxiv  OBJECT XIV  "The church hath  sufficient  power in herself to obtain every end necessary to her own wel∣fare That cannot be an ordinance of Jesus Christ which needs any  foreign  assistance to gain its proper end"  ANSW The church hath as sufficient power to gain her ends with respect to the duties of the s  cond table as to gain her ends in what respects the first table Will it therefore follow that magis∣trates ought to make no laws respecting murder un∣chastity theft calumny  c  Public transgres∣sions of the first table of the moral law injure  the state  as well as they do the church The state which also hath a power in itself sufficient to gain all its ends ne∣cessary to promote its own welfare ought therefore to restrain or punish such transgressions  as crimes  inju∣rious to itself while the church restrains and censures them as  scandals  defiling and hurtful to herself If soundness in the faith purity in worship holiness in practice and beautiful order in the church be an excellent mean of promoting the happiness of that na∣tion where the church hath her residence magis∣trates ought to promote those things out of a regard to the prosperity of their state in subordination to the honour of God However complete the in∣trinsic power of the church be it is manifest that it can be exercised to more advantage if parents mas∣ters and magistrates regularly exert their power in promoting the true religion in their different departmentsIt is no less certain that after the church hath done her utmost by conference in∣junction and censure some turbulent heretics or blas∣phemers may do as much if not more hurt to her than before unless magistrates restrain or punish them  OBJECT XV  "For almost three hundred years after Christ the truths of the gospel gloriously pre∣vailed against errors and corruptions without any care of magistrates to restrain or punish the errone∣ous"  ANSW It was proper that the Christian religion should be spread in the world not only with∣out the countenance of the civil magistrate but also in opposition to his severe laws and bloody persecuti∣ons that it might the more abundantly appear to be of God In that period it prevailed notwith∣standing the most furious opposition and the cruel persecution and murder of millions of its adherents as well as without magistratical assistance Will you therefore plead that peace and freedom in preaching the gospel ought to be hated and avoided and furi∣ous persecution coveted and prayed for In that period the miraculous powers which attested the doctrines of Christ did more than balance the want of magistratical helpfulness to the truth Heb ii In that period the hardships to which Christians were exposed deterred such naughty persons from entering the church as might have plagued her with their blasphemies and heresies And neverthe∣less even then blasphemers and heretics did no small hurt to the church If God had not reckoned the magistratical countenance a real blessing to his church he had never promised it as in the texts a∣bove quoted  OBJECT XVI  "It is horrid cruelty and unchris∣tian persecution to restrain or punish men for believ∣ing teaching and worshipping according to the dictates of their own conscience as charity obligeth us to believe is the case with heretics blasphemers and idolatersIt is  altogether diabolical  the  very worst part of Popery  and that which  peculiarly supports the whole Antichristian scheme  Men ought to follow the dictates even of an erring conscience"  ANSW Where is your proof from either scripture or rea∣son that an erring conscience binds men to believe teach or practise gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry any more than their promises or vows to do evil bind to performanceor than it can bind them to theft murder adultery calumny or the likeIf we  have an erring conscience our immediate duty is to get rid of that error by the illumination of God's word as being sinful in itself especially if procured through sloth or wickedness it will hinder our right performance of duty but can never make fin lawful If Sir you can believe that an erring conscience can outdo the almighty power of God in making he∣resy blasphemy or idolatry innocent things you may quickly believe that a Romist priest can outdo his Maker in making a God and then eating him in the mystery of transubstantiation Even when conscience is perfectly clear pure and unbiassed it is wholly subordinated and subjected to the authority of God's lawHow can the entrance of sinful error into it exalt it above his law and make such a God of it as can stamp its wicked dictates into incontroulable laws in opposition to the mandates of Jehovah him∣selfThis will not only prove that Adam and Eve became Gods by the entrance of fin but go far to justify Popes and devils in the whole of their conduct If the devil who deceiveth the world get into mens conscience by his strong delusions hath God allotted him that as a quiet city of refuge from which no means ought to be used to dislodge him and from which he may use the whole man unrestrained in his servicein sacrificing children to Moloch murder∣ing saints blaspheming God  c  Where is your proof that I ought to believe that the man who hath access to the Bible acts according to the dictates of his conscience in gross heresy blasphemy or idola∣try any more than that he acts according to them in murder treason theft unchastity  c  Men have laboured and suffered as much in courses of the latter kind as in those of the former and died as im∣penitently at last If pretence of conscience and more than pretence in favours of sin we can never be certain of be a sufficient ground for magistrates licensing encouraging and protecting men in contra∣dicting and blaspheming God or robbing him of his worship to bestow it on devilsor in robbing his church of his oracles or ordinancesin murdering the souls of men and sowing the seeds of confusion and every evil workWhy ought it not to warrant  their licensing encouraging and protecting them in high treason calumny theft robbery murderIt is hoped you who are so generous in allowing men if they can but pretend conscience for it to a∣bused and rob Jehovah will be as ready to allow them equal freedom if they can but pretend conscience in abusing and injuring yourself If God's giving up men to  strong delusions  that they may believe lies warrant magistrates to encourage or protect them in spreading gross heresy or in open blasphemy and idolatry Why ought not his giving them up to  vile affections  to their own hearts lusts equally to warrant their encou∣raging and protecting of them in open whoredom be∣stiality incest robbery  c  Men can as little con∣quer their lusts and cleanse their hearts as they can rectify the errors of their conscience It is infal∣libly certain that God himself under the Old Tes∣tament appointed magistrates to restrain and punish men for blasphemy and idolatry let their conscience dictate them as strongly as it pleasedHad men in these early ages no conscience to govern them Or did God then like the old fashioned Protestants not understand human liberty and the rights of mens con∣scienceDid he indeed then so far mistake his way as to appoint what is so  cruel  and  diabolical  what is the very  worst part of Popery  and the  principal support of that abominable system  Or hath God or the na∣ture of sin cruelty and tyranny been changed How shocking the thought  OBJECT XVII  "As mens natural and civil rights nowise depend upon their being orthodox Christians magistrates ought to protect them in these privileges be their opinions and worship what they will nay to give them legal security for their protection of them in these opinions and worship that they may not be exposed to the caprices of particular magistrates"  ANSW The Christian liberty which Christ pur∣chased is not a liberty to commit sin but a spiritual freedom from it Gal v Luke i Heb xii Christ came not to save mens lives from restraint or punishment required by his own law in order that they by spreading gross heresy blasphe∣my  and idolatry might ruin nations and damn mens souls You might have forborne to demand  le∣gal  or  authoritative  licenses for men to blaspheme God worship devils in his stead  c  till you had proven Satan to be the absolute proprietor and governor of this world and the primary granter of all civil and natural rights to menor proven that God who is infinitely holy just and good hath or can give men natural or civil rights protecting them in public blas∣phemy idolatry or the like any more than rights protecting them in incest robbery murder or that magistrates as his ministers ought in his name and authority to grant men such rights If God hath so frequently turned men out of their civil property and life for their idolatry and blasphemy Isa x xiv xxxvii xlvi xlvii Jer xlviii li Ezek xxxvhow absurd to require magistrates who are  his ministers for good  to men to execute their office which is  his ordinance  Rom xiii in encouraging and pro∣tecting men in openly and insolently contradicting blaspheming rebelling against and robbing himOught the Sheriff and Justices of peace in Britain as the  king's ministers for good  to the nation to have exe∣cuted their office in protecting the archrebels in and in the undisturbed enjoyment of all their civil rights or to have given them new legal securities in order to enable them more boldly and successfully to carry on their treacherous and murde∣rous rebellion against his Majesty Or ought they by proclamation to warrant all the subjects in their re∣spective counties to revile rob and take arms against our king and parliament and promise them protecti∣on in so doing but always prohibiting them to injure their fellow subjects  OBJECT XVIII  "Magistrates ought not to rule their subjects by the Bible but by the civil laws of the nation according to which they are admitted to their power by their subjects from whom all their power originates"  ANSW That magistrates power o∣riginates from their subjects is a notion  plainly atheisti∣cal  It originates in God himself Rom xiii Rom xi Psalm lxxv Dan ii If ma∣gistrates must regulate their government by no other  law than that which they or their subjects have esta∣blished for themselves or one another they must act as atheists independent of God in the execution of an office wholly derived from him and for every act of which they must be accountable to him If the use∣ful laws of one nation may be adopted into the civil law of another Why may not the will of God the supreme governor of nations declared in his laws of nature and revelation be also adopted into it Are God's laws more dishonourable or dangerousmore unfit to be adopted into our civil law than those of our sinful neighbours Is the Scotch law the worse that many of God's statutes prescribed in his word have been adopted into itnay that all the leading doctrines of Christianity contained in our two Confes∣sions of Faith and Catechisms have been adopted into it and the Confessions themselves expresly ingrossed into acts of ParliamentIndeed if nations adopt no∣thing of the manifested will of God into their civil law it will contain nothing but useless trifles Will these be fit for directing the administrations of  mini∣sters of God for good  to men or for securing and pro∣moting the important welfare of any nation under heaven If all civil authority to make laws re∣sident either in subjects or magistrates be necessarily derived from God as  Former  and  King of nations  If magistrates be  ordained of God  to be  ministers of God for good  to men to be for  terror  and  punishment  and  revengers of evil doers  and a  praise of them that  well  and to  be obeyed  for  conscience sakefor the Lord's sake  Rom xiii Pet ii Common sense loudly demands That neither their will nor that of their subjects but the manifested will of God their independent and infinitely high superior should be the  supreme rule and standard  of all their administrati∣ons and that no civil law should or can bind either magistrates or their subjects but in so far as it is agree∣able and subordinated to the laws of God  OBJECT XIX  "Magistracy being an office not founded in revelation but in the law of nature the whole execution of it ought to be regulated by that law of nature not by the will of God revealed in scripture"  ANSW I thank you for so quickly  overturning your preceding objection and adopting the  divine law  of nature instead of  your civil law  as the supreme standard of magistratical administration According to your objection parents masters children and servants must regulate their performance of relative duties merely by the law of nature with∣out taking the smallest assistance from the directions of the Holy Ghost in scripture No parents or mas∣ters must instruct their children or servants in the knowledge of the doctrines promises laws worship or virtue required in the Bible as these relations  de∣pend no more on Revelation than magistracy doth  I de∣fy you to prove they do In performing the duty of our natural or civil relations we must act as  mere de∣ists  ignorant of or pouring contempt on the inspired oracles of the Great GOD our SaviourWhat hurt have the laws of revelation done to such relative duties that they must be thus infamously excluded from being any part of a rule of them No man can truly obey the law of nature without heartily em∣bracing and chearfully improving whatever revelations God is pleased to bestow on himas such revelations proceed from the same divine authority as the law of nature and must be a noted means of promoting true and proper obedience to itTo exclude divine reve∣lation when granted from regulating our perfor∣mance of relative duties must therefore not only a∣mount to an  heathenish  contempt of the scriptures but to an  atheistical  contempt of the law of nature which necessarily requires us to adopt divine Revelation for our supreme rule whenever it is graciously granted to us  OBJECT XX  "Many of the abovementioned in∣stances of magistrates care about religion and their re∣straint and punishment of idolaters blasphemers and false prophets related merely to the Jewish Theocra∣cy which was  typical  and therefore not now to be co∣pied"  ANSW Many of the abovementioned instances particularly those respecting Heathens or contained in the promises to the gospel church have not the least appearance of being typical Nay I de∣fy you to prove that the instances of Jewish rulers were  merely  typical These typical magistrates of the  Jewish nation also exercised laws relative to murder theft unchastity treason and other matters of the second table of the moral law Ought therefore no magistrates now to do so The laws respecting duties of the second table pertained as much to the Jewish Theocracy as those relating to the first Must there∣fore the Christian magistrate for fear of copying the Jewish Theocracy meddle with no morality at all Must every thing that was once typical be now under the gospel excluded from regulating authority Must all the excellent patterns of Abel Enoch Noah Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Job Moses Aaron Samuel David and other Hebrew saints be rejected as typical and uselessMust all the laws directing to elect men  fearing God and hating covetousness  to be magistrates or directing them to judge justly im∣partially and prudently and to punish murderers a∣dulterers thieves robbers  c  be discarded as typi∣cal Must the weekly Sabbath public fasts and thanks∣givings be laid aside as typicala mere sign between God and the Israelites Must the ten commandments and all the explications of them in the Old Testament be discarded as published in a typical manner and to a typical people and used as the principal part of their rule of government in the Jewish Theocracy As the Jewish church was a REAL church and not MERELY TYPICAL so their State was a REAL commonwealth or kingdom and not MERELY TY∣PICAL Whatever therefore pertained to it  as a real commonwealth  is imitable in any other The Jewish Church and State were as REALLY DIS∣TINCT as the Church and State are now though I do not say precisely in the same manner They differed in respect of REGULATING LAWS The ceremonial law directed the Jewish church The ju∣dicial directed the affairs of their state They differed in their respective ACTS The Jews worship∣ped God offered sacrifices and received sacraments not as members of that state but as members of that church They punished evil doers by fines im∣prisonment banishment burning stoning and hang∣ing and fought with enemies  c  not as a church  but as a state They differed in respect of CON∣TROVERSIES To the church pertained the  matters of the Lord  and a judging of leprosies and between statutes and judgments To the state belonged the  matters of the king  and to judge between blood and blood Chron xix Deut xvii They differed in respect of OFFICERS The priests were the only stated officers in the church and pro∣phets a kind of occasional ones Elders Judges and Kings were governors in the State The priests might not take the civil sword out of the hand of the ma∣gistrates nor the magistrates offer sacrifices burn in∣cense or otherwise execute the priest's office They differed in respect of CONTINUANCE When the Jewish civil power was taken away by the Ro∣mans the constitution of their church remained in the days of our Saviour's debasement And even now the Jews pretend to be a church but not to be a state They differed in respect of VARIATION The constitution of their church remained much the same under Moses Joshua the Judges the Kings and after the captivity But the form of the state underwent great alterations They differed in respect of MEMBERS Proselytes of the covenant were complete members of the Jewish church but had not the same dignities or marriages allowed them in the State as the natural Israelites Nor had the proselytes of the gate any church privileges though they had some civil ones They were governed by different COURTS The church had her courts of the Synagogue and her ecclesiastical SanhedrinThe state had her courts of the gate  c  and her civil Sanhedrinthough often some Levites were judges in both as our ruling elders in the church may at the same time be civil judges Exod xxiv Deut xvii Chron xxxiii xxvi Chron xix Jer xxvi xviii with Deut xvii Ezek vii Kings vi Zech vii Psal cvii Ezek xiii Mat ii xvi xxi xxvi xxvii Luke xxii Acts iv Some Jew∣ish Rabbins expresly distinguish between their judges and their church elders in the same places They  differed in their CENSURE of offenders In the church offenders were suspended from sacred fellow∣ship by  a casting out of the Synagogue  or  a cutting off from God's people or congregation  John ix xii Exod xii Num xix Lev xxii with Gen iv Lev vii with v Cor v with Exod xii Gen xvii with Acts iii Psal i Gen xxv In the state they were cast off by death or ontlawry Profane and scandalous persons were excluded from the Jewish templeservice and passover while they retained their civil rights in the state Ezek xliv Deut xxiii Jer vii Ezek xxiii Chron xxiii with Cor v Psal cxviii xv xxiv l E∣zek xxvi Ezra x vi  See Gillespy's  Aaron's Rod blossoming  Part I Leus∣den's  Philologus Hebraeo mixtus  P  There was no such difference between the Jewish magistracy especially after their rejection of the Theo∣cracy under Samuel Sam viii xii and the magistracy in Christian countries as it is often pretended The Jewish magistracy was an  ordinance of God  Exod xviii Num xi Deut i xvii xvi Magistracy is still an ordinance of God to be submitted to for the Lord's sake Rom xiii Pet ii Notwithstanding God's appointment of particular persons to be their kings the Hebrew nation had the power of electing and ad∣mitting them to their office Sam x xi xvi Sam ii v Chron xii Our magistrates are  pow∣ers ordained of God  Rom xiii and yet an  ordi∣nance of men  Pet ii God himself was the supreme governour of the Hebrew nation Deut xii Hos xiii God is still  King of nations Most High King of the whole earth  Jer x Psalm lxxxiii xlvii The Israelites were God's peculiar kingdom Sam xii Hos xiii Na∣tions which generally profess the Christian religion are the  kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ  Rev xi The Jewish magistrates were deputies and vicegerents of God the sovereign King Chronicles  xxix Chron ix Psal lxxxii Ma∣gistrates are still  powers ordained of God ministers of God for good  to whom we must be subject for consci∣ence sakefor the Lord's sake Rom xiii Pet ii By Christ kings still reign and princes decree justice even all the judges of the earth Prov viii with Eph i The manifested will of God was the proper statute book of the Jewish civil law Deut xvii The will of God manifested in the laws of nature and revelation are the supreme standard of all civil laws in the world in which every human constitution ought to be founded and by which the whole binding force of it is circumscribed Acts iv v Psal ii and hence hu∣man laws become an  ordinance of God  Rom xiii The judicial laws of the Hebrew nation regulat∣ed that which pertained to their kings judges war∣riors fields houses injuries crimes punishments mortgages marriages  c  Exod xxixxiii Deut xviii xx Lev xviii xx Num xxxvixxxviii  c  Our civil laws regulate the same things Among the Jews notorious disobedience to the declared will of God was held rebellion against him the King of the nation and to be condignly punished as it tended to the good of the state Heb ii x Noto∣rious disobedience to the manifested will of God ought to be still held as rebellion against Him as king of nations and to be condignly punished as tends to the welfare of the statemagistrates being still set up by God to be  terrors revengers  and  punishers of evil doers  and bound  not to bear the sword in vain  Rom xiii Pet ii Nor hath it been yet proven That our magistrates who have the scrip∣tures ought to pay less real regard to them in the stat∣ing of crimes than the Jewish rulers did The Jewish magistrates were appointed to promote the wel∣fare of the church in order to promote the welfare of the state in subordination to the honour of God the King of the nation Magistrates are still bound to do the same as they have opportunity Isa xlix lx Rev xvii xxi Rom xiii Pet ii Tim ii The Jewish church and state as hath been just  now proven were really distinct from and indepen∣dent of each other having different laws officers courts privileges penalties  c  The christian church and the civil state of Christians are no less distinct and indepen∣dant of each other Nevertheless the purity of the Jewish church contributed much to the welfare of their state and the right management of their state to the prosperity of their church and bad manage∣ment in the one always tended to the hurt of the other Deut xxviiixxxii Lev xxvi Judges ixiii Sam iito Chron xxxvi Isa ito Mal iv Isa i iii And still righ∣teousness exalteth a nation and sin is the reproach and ruin of any people Prov xiv God never commanded the Jewish magistrates to  force  their true religion upon their Heathen neighbours Phili∣stines Moabites Ammonites or Syrians whom they conquered or to put them to death for their idolatry Nor hath He ever commanded magistrates who have embraced the true Christian religion to FORCE men by fire or sword or any like punishments to embrace and profess itor to inslict t  e same punishments u∣pon blasphemers or idolaters in unenlightened coun∣tries which they may do upon such as obstinately re∣bel against and apostatize from the truth amidst plen∣tiful means of conviction and establishment in it Never did God that I know of require the Jewish magistrates to punish any of their subjects for  lesser faults  however open or manifest or to punish them for the  simple neglect  of duties  strictly religious  or to annex sentences of outlawry and of death to ecclesias∣tical  cutting off  by excommunication from the church Nor can I find that he hath enjoined any such thing upon the Christian magistrate Among the Jews some things partaking of both a civil and religi∣ous nature did in these different respects fall under the government of both Church and State Even cir∣cumcision itself was a national badge as well as a reli∣gious seal of God's covenantAmong Christians public fasts and thanksgivings calling of Synods  c  do in different respects fall under the power of both church and statePretend therefore no more that there is a  total difference  between the case of our ma∣gistrates  and that of the Jewish recorded in scrip∣ture  OBJECT XXI  "To allow magistrates a power of judging making and executing laws about religion and of punishing men for erroneous opinions or for disturbing the peace and order of the church as in cur Confession of Faith and Second Book of Disci∣pline altogether confounds the kingdoms of Christ with the kingdoms of this world contrary to John xviii "  ANSW Sir Have you in an honest and orderly manner renounced these Confessions of Faith as plainly and publicly as you solemnly avowed if not also subscribed a stedfast adherence to the Westmin∣ster one at your ordination Dare you one day call God angels and men to witness that you sincere∣ly avow that Confession of Faith to be the Confession of your Faith and that you sincerely believe the WHOLE DOCTRINE contained in it to be found∣ed on the word of God and will constantly adhere to and maintain the same all the days of your lifeand the next slight reproach revile and attempt to con∣fute an important article of it  See the wickedness of such conduct excellently exposed in Walker's Vindication of the Discipline and Constitutions of the Church of Scotland  Have you suffered as much for a zealous maintenance of the intrinsic powerof the church and of Christ's sole head∣ship over her as his spiritual kingdom as the compi∣lers and cordial adherers to that Confession have done If not modesty as well as equity might have restrai∣ned your revilings Suppose that contrary to my judgment I should allow that magistrates  as such  have not that power relative to religious matters men∣tioned in our Confessions and solemnly avowed in our Covenants yet being Christians they are bound  as such  to execute their civil offices in that manner which most effectually promotes the honour and king∣dom of Christeven as parents or masters who are Christians are bound to exercise their power in their families as may best maintain and propagate the knowledge faith and obedience of the gospel Eve∣ry other character or office which a Christian hath must be subordinated to his character as a Christian  Pet iv Col iii Eph v vi Col iii iv Tim ii Tit ii iii Pet ii iii Rom xiii If to prevent confounding of the king∣dom of Christ with the kingdoms of this world magistrates who are heads of large political fami∣lies must be excluded from all that care about religion which is allotted them in our Confession of Faith Heads of families must for the same reason be excluded from establishing the gospelworship of God in their houses and from instruc∣ting their children or servants in the truths of di¦vine revelation at least from requiring them to at∣tend such instructions and worship You pretend there is a difference But Sir I insist on your stat∣ing it precisely and proving from scripture and rea∣son that headship over families is a more spiritual re∣lation than headship over multitudes of families or that magistrates cannot without sin do what is simi∣lar to every thing which parents and masters as such are commanded to do If to prevent confoun∣ding of the church with the state magistrates must ex∣ercise no care about religionmust punish no public∣ly obstinate heretic blasphemer idolater profan∣er of the Sabbath or reviler of the oracles and ordi∣nances of Christ  as a criminal against the welfare of the state  Churchcourts must censure  as scandals  a∣gainst the welfare of the church no theft murder robbery treason unlawful war perversion of civil judgment or the like as these pertain to the king∣doms of this world Though the powers of ci∣vil and ecclesiastical government be COORDINATE each standing on its proper basis and the right exer∣cise of church power contributing mightily to the welfare of the stateand of civil power to the advance∣ment of the churchyet they are not COLLATERAL inseparable from or dependent upon each other but are altogether distinct from and different in many respects  See this point excellently handled in the Hundred and E∣leven Propositions of the Assembly republished by Al∣ston Edinburgh    Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their FOUN∣DATION Magistracy is founded on God's universal dominion over all nations and hence the law of na∣ture is the  immediate supreme rule  of its administrati∣ons and the scriptures become the rule of them only as introduced by the law of nature requiring magis∣trates as well as others to believe and obey whatever revelation duly attested God is pleased to grant themor by magistrates subjecting their consciences as followers of Christ to the scriptures as their only rule to direct them how to glorify God and enjoy him for ever But ecclesiastical power is founded in the oeconomical or mediatorial headship of Jesus Christ over his church as his spiritual kingdom and hence the immediate standard for regulating the exercise of it is that Revelation which God hath given to and by him in his wordand the laws of nature have a regulating force in the church by virtue of the gene∣ral precepts of scripture as Cor xiv vi xvi Phil iv Mat vii  Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their IM∣MEDIATE OBJECT Magistratical power immediate∣ly relates only to  things external  pertaining to the outward man Even when exercised about sacred things it hath that which is  external  for its  immediate object  It removes external hindrances of spiritual exercises and provides external opportunities and ac∣commodations for the performance of them If ma∣gistrates call a Synod they do not properly call it as a  court of Christ  or as  ministers of Christ  but as a meet∣ing of subjects whose joint deliberations are calculat∣ed to promote the honour of God the King of nati∣ons and the happiness of their country by the right government of the church If a magistrate command persons to compear before a churchcourt to be judg∣ed or to bear witness be commands them not as spiritual members of Christ's mystical body but as his own and Jehovah's subjects to take their trial or at∣test the truth before proper arbitrators of their cause that God may be honoured and through keeping of order in the church the welfare of the city or nation may be advanced and consirmed If he punish inso∣lent contemners of the authority and censures of the  church he punisheth them not as  scandalous persons  but as  criminals  insulters of that true religion which the civil law hath established and contemners of these judicatories which it hath authorized and to which themselves have solemnly engaged all due subjectionand thus as treacherous disturbers of the good or∣der and peace of his kingdom and tramplers on the laws of the Most High Sovereign of the nationBut churchpower hath that which is  spiritual  for its only proper object It properly deals with mens  consciences and heart  and with their outward man only in or∣der to affect those in the way of conviction reforma∣tion comfort  c  It considers the persons with whom it deals not as  mere men  or as  members of a ci∣vil  society but as members of the  spiritual and mysti∣cal body of Christ  in the visible form of it  Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their TORM Though magistrates be the  ministers of God  for good to men their power over their subjects is of a LORDLY nature They are  lordly  fathers who by making and enforcing civil laws can  compel  the disobedientIn this view if they establish any thing pertaining to the church they establish it as a mean of honouring God their Superior in the advancement of the welfare of the common wealth If they punish faults they con∣sider them as  crimes  injurious to the happiness of the state dishonouring God its supreme Governor and provoking his wrath against it and they punish those crimes only on the outward man by fining imprison∣ment death  c  But church power is altogether MINISTERIAL distributing to men reproofs admo∣nitions and other ordinances according to the in∣spired prescriptions of Christ Mat xvi xviii Cor iv Christ being her alone Lord Churchrulers have no power to make any  laws pro∣perly so called  Isa xxxiii James iv In deal∣ing with offenders they consider faults even oppres∣sion tyranny sinful wars and leagues perversion of judgment bribery or the like in magistrates who are members not  as crimes  but merely  as scandals  desil∣ing and ruining mens souls plaguing the church and dishonouring and provoking Christ and his Father in  him against it They have no  compulsory power  can punish no man either in his person or his external property can use no weapons but such as are  spiritual  mighty through God administring church censures not as punishments but as spiritual privileges and divinely instituted means of bringing offenders to a thorough repentance of their sins to the eternal sal∣vation of their soulsAnd this whole power must be used only in the name of Jesus Christ as Head of his church Cor i x xiii ii Cor v  Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their PRO∣PER END The  formal end of magistratical power  is to advance the glory of God the King of nations in promoting the welfare of the commonwealthand the establishment of the true religion and care to pro∣mote the prosperity and propagation of the church are used as eminent means of gaining that end Or the good of the church may also be considered as an  accessory end  of civil administration as the better civil justice be executed open  breakings restrained and virtue encouraged by the magistrate the fewer will probably be the scandals and the greater the pu∣rity and prosperity of the church Nay though the advancement of the church's welfare be not the for∣mal end of magistracy yet as Christ is made Head over all things to his church every magistrate who professeth the Christian religion ought to pursue the formal end of his office as subordinated to his  Christian end  of promoting the glory of God in the wel∣fare of the church and eternal salvation of menBut the formal  end  of all church power is the glorify∣ing of God in Christ by promoting the spiritual con∣viction conversion and edification of mens souls and the welfare of nations is but an  accessory  or  subor∣dinate  end at which churchrulers as subjects in the state ought always to aimas the better they pro∣secute and obtain the end of their office the fewer will be the crimes the better both subjects and magis∣trates and the more numerous and valuable the bles∣sings of God on the nation  Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their PRO∣PER EFFECTS The  proper effects  of magistratical  power rightly exercised is the good of the common∣wealth in their commodious enjoyment of civil privi∣leges in a manner mightily calculated to promote the honour of God as the Most High over all the earthand the purity peace and prosperity of the church arising from the right administration of justice dis∣couragement of evil doers and praise of them that do well is but an  accessory effect  But the  proper effect  of church power rightly exercised is the conversion of men to Jesus Christ fellowship with him and growth in grace and good works to the praise of his glory and the advantage accruing to cities or nations by the virtuous laws and fervent prayers of churchmem∣bers is but an  accessory effect  of it  Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their SUB∣JECTS of residence No ecclesiastical power can re∣side in a heathen a woman or a child and no pow∣er of jurisdiction in a single personas civil power often may or doth Nor can one ecclesiastic officer delegate his power to another  They differ in their FORMAL CONSIDERATION OF THE PERSONS UPON WHOM THEY ARE EXER∣CISED A magistrate's power extends over all per∣sons resident in his territory be their moral character what it will Jews Heathens  c  Rom xiii But churchpower extends only to the professed members of Christ's mystical body the Church Corinth v  Civil and ecclesiastical power differ in respect of their DIVIDED EXERCISE The one may and ought to be exercised whether the other be so or notThe  end of churchcensure  being to gain sinners to repentance and salvation scandalous persons appear∣ing penitent ought to be seasonably absolved from it and restored to communion with the church in sealing ordinances But the  end of civil punishment  being the satisfaction of the law and the deterring of others from the like faults criminals however penitent and fully restored to churchfellowship may as the na∣ture of their crime demands be punished even unto death And suppose a churchmember should have satisfied the demands of the civil law for a crime he ought to be prosecuted and censured for it as a scan∣dal  by the ecclesiastical courts till he appear duly penitent Not only ought churchrulers to censure scandalous persons when magistrates take no no∣tice of their faults but even to censure magistrates who are churchmembers for what wickedness they commit under colour of countenance from the civil law And where magistrates punish and churchrulers censure the same persons for the same faults the processes ought to be kept entirely distinct from and independent of each otherthough to prevent unnecessary swearing the proof taken in one court may sometimes be produced and judged of also in the other  OBJECT XXII  "Magistrates not being proper judges of the doctrines of Revelation cannot be ca∣pable to judge concerning religious matters and par∣ticularly to determine who are heretics blasphemers or idolaters"  ANSW That they have a right to judge in these matters hath been already established God who knows all things admits private Chris∣tians to be capable of judging what is heresy blas∣phemy and idolatry and who are heretics blasphe∣mers and idolaters and hence commands them to keep themselves from these sins and to avoid such sedu∣cers and debar them from their houses Rom xvi Tim iii Cor v John iv v John Now what hinders Christi∣an magistrates to have as much good sense and  s much capacity of judging in these matters as common Christians The gross errors blasphemies and idolatries which magistrates ought to restrain and  sui∣tably  and  seasonably  punish are so plainly condemned by the word of God which magistrates ought carefully to search under the direction of the Holy Spirit that any unbiassed person of common capacity may easily discern them The advice of faithful ministers and the common consent of Christian churches may assist magistrates in discerning from the word of God what is gross or damnable heresy blasphemy idolatry  OBJECT XXIII  "If magistrates as such have a power of judging in religious matters then Heathen magistrates must also be allowed to make laws concer∣ning religion and the church while in the mean time  they cannot be censured by the church if they do a∣miss"  ANSW What could you gain if I should plead that it is magistrates Christianity requiring them to execute their office in subordination to it that is the immediate origin of their power about the mat∣ters of religion even as it is parents Christianity that warrants them to receive baptism for their in∣fants But Heathen magistrates with God's di∣rection and approbation have made laws respecting religion Ezra vii vi i Dan iii vi Jonah iii Dare you condemn the Al∣mighty Heathen magistrates have the same power as Christian magistrates but are less capable to use it aright even as heathen parents and masters have the same power over their children and servants as Christians but are less qualified to discern and per∣form their duty Neither heathen nor Christian magistrates have any power at all against the truth but for the truthany power for the destruction of the church but for her edification Cor xiii Heathen magistrates therefore ought carefully to improve what assistance they have by the light of nature and works of creation and providence or by any Revelation from God to which they have accessalways taking heed to make no laws but such as they certainly know to be agreeable to the law of GodIt is not to be expected that civil laws can forbid every fault and require every thing good in externals but they ought never to encourage sin or discourage duty  OBJECT XXIV  "To allow magistrates a power of judging about the matters of religion will make them churchrulers"  ANSW No more than it made Nebuchadnezzar Darius Cyrus Darius and Artaxerxes and the king of Nineveh churchrulers No more than churchrulers taking cognizance of murder adultery incest theft robbery or even of the conduct of Christian magistrates relative to ad∣ministration of justice wars alliances  c  will make them magistrates How often must you be told that churchrulers judge how such profession or prac∣tice ought to stand connected with ecclesiastical encon∣couragements  discouragements or censure but ma∣gistrates judge how such profession or practice ought to be connected with civil encouragements or discou∣ragements Churchrulers warn against and censure mens public faults  only as scandals  disgraceful and hurtful to the church Magistrates judge of and pu∣nish them  only as crimes  hurtful to the prosperity of the State In church courts matters are considered as the  matters of the Lord  In civil courts they are considered as the  matters os the king  Chron xix Ministers as the deputies of Christ require magistrates to execute their office for the honour of Christ and welfare of his church and censure them if churchmembers if they do not Magistrates as vicegerents of God the King of nations require mi∣nisters faithfully to execute their office particularly as stated by the laws of the land in order to promote virtue and happiness among the subjects and draw the blessing of God upon them and they punish them  as undutiful subjects  if they notoriously transgress Kings ii Magistrates have NO ECCLESIASTICAL POWER at all They have no power to restrain or hinder the free and full exercise of church power But by giving full opportunity encouragement and excitement to church officers they have power to pro∣vide that church power be freely and faithfully exer∣cised in their dominions They have no power to transact any thing ecclesiastical as in admission of members into the church or to the seals of God's co∣venantno power to choose or ordain church offi∣cersno power to preach the gospel dispense the sa∣crament inflict censures or absolve from themThey have no power to prescribe or enact any eccle∣siastical laws but they have power to adopt such law∣ful and expedient constitutions as have been made by the churchcourts into their civil code by a legal ra∣tificationand power to enact such  political laws  as are necessary for the more advantageous execution of these ecclesiastical constitutions They have no power to frame a religion for their subjects or ratify a false religion already received or framed or to establish a∣ny thing in religion which is not founded in the word of God but they have a power to adopt the law of  God and the religion prescribed by it as a part of their civil law in order to promote the glory of God in the welfare of the nationThe more public church courts be and the more extensive his influence upon his subjects and the welfare of the nationthe more right hath the civil magistrate to exercise his  po∣litical power  about them The church having an in∣trinsic right and power from Christ to call Synods for government whenever her circumstances require it the magistrate hath no power to deprive her of this right But while the church calls them as courts of Christ constituted of church rulers appointed by him to act in his name the magistrate may call them as courts established by the civil law and necessary to to promote the peace order and piety and so the prosperity of his subjectsas courts which consist of his principal subjects and to which place and protecti∣on must be given in his dominions The magistrate hath no power of deputing to Synods such members as he pleaseth Acts xv Chron viii or to hin∣der or recal those whom the church hath deputed unless the safety of the state plainly require it But he may compel members and parties who have causes before the court to attend if the case of the church require it as a mean of repressing a malicious and turbulent faction who have or may hurt the State It is not necessary that either the magistrate or his Commissioner attend ecclesiastical Synodsthough to secure their protection curb unruly troublers of the court and to witness the propriety of their pro∣cedure he may attendIf he attend He hath a power to judge for himself how matters are ecclesias∣tically transacteda power  politically  to provide That the members meddle with no political affairs which do not belong to them as a court of Christand to take care that members and others present observe that due decency in reasoning voting submitting or hearing which the nature of the court requires If any cause be partly civil and partly ecclesiastical he is to judge the civil part himself and leave the ecclesi∣astical to the church courtEven in ecclesiastical causes he may give his advice nay he may propose and require Synods to examine and decide concerning  points of doctrine or practice if necessary for the sa∣tisfaction of his own conscience or the instruction and edification of his subjects in order to promote the welfare of the state in subordination to the glory of God But he hath no power to hinder others to pro∣pose their difficulties or grievances before the Synod for satisfaction or redress unless the cause be partly of a political nature a Synodical decision of which at that time endangers the stateHe hath no pow∣er to preside in the Synod or give his decisive vote in any of their transactions But as a man and Christi∣an he hath right to a  judgment of discretion  Whether their decisions be according to the law of God or notand as a magistrate he hath a power of  political judgment  by which he doth not properly judge Whe∣ther these decisions be true or false good or bad in themselves but Whether and How far they ought to be ratified and as it were adopted into the laws of the State and connected with civil rewards forbear∣ance or punishments Thus the power of the ma∣gistrate  in nothing  interferes with the power of the Synod Nothing is done by the one as a magistrate that the other can do as a court of Christ And as the decisions of Synods are  supreme in the ecclesiastic order  from which there is no appeal but to Jesus ChristBy remonstrating as a churchmember and commanding them as their King the magistrate may cause the Synod reconsider its own deeds but he can∣not reverse them himselfso the magistrate's deed concerning the civil ratification of churchdeeds is  su∣preme in its kind  from which there is no appeal but to God himself The Synod may require him as a Churchmember and as subjects they may remon∣strate and supplicate his reconsideration of his own deed but they cannot reverse it themselves  OBJECT XXV  "To allow magistrates to judge in matters of religion for others and to restrain and punish corruptions in it is to render them Lords of mens faith and consciencea power which even the inspired apostles disclaimed For if magistrates impose any religion at all upon their subjects it must be what their own conscience dictates and then what shall become of the private rights of conscience among  their subjects"  ANSW Did then God who of old commanded magistrates to judge about matters of religion and to restrain and punish blasphemers idolaters seducers profaners of the Sabbath Deut xiii xvii Lev xxiv Song ii Num xv command them to lord it over mens conscience If it was not so then it can∣not be so now as conscience tyranny and murder are the same in every age The objection strikes with equal force against all ecclesiastical establish∣ment of the true religion and against all creeds and Confessions of Faith and against all ecclesiastical judging and censuring of men for heresy blasphemy or idolatry contrary to Rev ii Titus iii Gal v as against magistrates judging about esta∣blishing religion or punishing the public insulters of it Magistrates act in this matter as  his ministers  and vicegerents by virtue of his commandment who is the alone Lord of conscience and restrain or punish nothing but what men under any proper influence of faith and conscience would abstain from as for∣bidden by the Lord of conscience who is to be their future judge and hath appointed magistrates as his substitutes to avenge the open injuries done to him in this world Rom xiii And if men persist in sins plainly forbidden in his law he holds them as sin∣ners against and condemned by their conscience Tit iii The absurdity of mens consciences being sustained as a standard as well as the proper me∣thod of magistrates making laws relative to religion have been already manifested Magistrates conscien∣ces have no more just claim to God bead than those of their meanest subjects Not therefore magistrates pretences to conscience but plain and evident marks of the authority of God manifested in and from the scriptures must determine their subjects to receive a religion in obedience to their authority as subordinat∣ed to the authority of God the Most High superior of both  OBJECT XXVI  "In Rom xiii where the power of magistrates is more fully described than any where else in the New Testament only the commands of the  second table of the moral law are subjoined to mark that it only extends to the concerns of men one with another"  ANSW Who authorized the objector to put asunder the two Testaments and the two tables which God hath joined Or to separate the first part of that chapter from the last which certainly relates to religion any more than from verse th The magistrate's character  minister of God for good terror  to and  revenger of evil doers  and his duty to love his neighbours as himself there hinted cannot admit of his having no care about religion and the first table of the moral law To oblige men carefully to search the whole scriptures God hath seldom if ever ma∣nifested his whole will relative to any thing in one passage  OBJECT XXVII  "If we allow magistrates any power at all about religious matters we must plunge ourselves into inextricable difficulties as the precise limits of civil and ecclesiastical power can never be fix∣edand every small mistake in religious opinions or neglect of religious duties must bring men to the gib∣bet as theft draws down the wrath of God on nati∣ons as well as blasphemy and idolatry do"  ANSW There is no more difficulty in limiting the power of magistrates about either religion or virtue than in fixing precise limits to the power of churchrulers re∣lative to those matters Do you fix precise limits to churchpower according to the word of God and I shall next moment fix as precise limits for the power of the magistrate If you limit the exercise of church power to duties required and sins forbidden in the first table of the moral lawyou naturally leave the care of the duties required in the second table to the magistrate But then whether a church of Christ having no care or power about morality toward menor a deputed kingdom of God without any care or power about any thing relating to the honour of God be most absurd and devilish I know not If you a∣ver That the power of churchrulers extends to the external obedience or disobedience of churchmembers to both tables of God's law not as  civil  but as  spiri∣tual  conduct tending to the spiritual advantage or hurt of the church and therefore connected with the  spiritual encouragements or frowns of Christ's visible church and that they meddle not with sins against the second table  as crimes  against mens person or pro∣perty but  as scandals  against the spiritual edification of the church and the glory of Jesus Christ therein concernedI immediately reply That precisely in like manner the power of magistrates extends to the external obedience or disobedience of  civil subjects as such  to both tables of God's law  not as it is of a spiritual nature  but  as it affects the civil welfare or hurt of the nation  or honour of God as the King of it and so ought to stand connected with civil encou∣ragements or discouragements If you pretend that it will be still hard to shew how far magistrates may in that view proceed in matters of the first table par∣ticularly with respect to offending clergymen I an∣swer that it is not one whit harder than to shew how far church courts may proceed in matters of the se∣cond table particularly with respect to offensive ma∣gistratical administrations Your pretence that if magistrates punish any faults in religion they must punish all known faults in the same form and degree is but a deceitful insult on the Most High who in his word appointed the capital punishment of idolaters and blasphemers and yet never warranted the punish∣ment of many faults relative to religion in like man∣ner nay for ought I see hath not required magistrates at all to punish any thing but the most atrocious faults in it If you insult Christ who hath not command∣ed any faults but atrocious ones obstinately continu∣ed in to be censured with excommunication and hath never commanded many lesser neglects and infirmities of churchmembers to be censured at allIt is an in∣sult on common sense Would you or any man in his wits either censure or punish men  as severely  for a simple neglect of a religious duty as for an open and blasphemous insulting of religion Would you censure or punish the stealing of a single straw as se∣verely as the stealing of a man or woman Would you censure or punish a prick with a pin as severely as the cutting of a man's throat or the ripping up of a woman with child  OBJECT XXVIII  "Either every error in doc∣trine and mistake in worship must be punished by the magistrate or only that which is more glaring and notorious If it is only the latter How are the limits of what is punishable and what is not and the degree of punishment proper for each to be precisely fixed"  ANSW If every species of duty must be neglected and the contrary sin allowed where it is difficult to fix the precise boundaries of sin or dutyor where it is difficult to fix the precise degrees of encourage∣ment to be given to such obedience or of censure or punishment due to such sin men must be left to live like absolute atheists in both church and state every man doing that which is right in his own eyes Unless you prove that every insult of and outrage a∣gainst God and his religion ought to pass unpunished and even be licensed and authorized yourself must be equally embarrassed in fixing what is punishable and what is not and what must be the form and degree of punishment annexed to each punishable fault Nay unless you prove that all deeds however hor∣rid ought to be tolerated in both church and state How are you to fix precisely what deeds are censur∣able or punishable and what notand what form and degree of censure or punishment is proper for each in every particular form and circumstance A man may as really and for ought men can prove a∣gainst him as justly pretend conscience for his wicked deeds of treason murder robbery  c  as for his damnable heresies blasphemies and idolatrous wor∣ship Wicked deeds if God be true are the native fruits of gross errors and idolatrous worship A con∣science which under the clear light of scripture reve∣lation approves the whole system of Popery or Soci∣nianism may as reasonably dictate the murder of saints dethronement of lawful Sovereigns community of women and goods  c  Let once the plea of consci∣ence be admitted in the case of treason theft robbery murder and the like and I will undertake it shall be as commonly pled as in the case of gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry and it will be as impossible for judges to disprove it in the one case as in the oth∣er Nothing therefore will truly answer your tole∣rant  scheme but that every man be allowed to pro∣fess worship and act as he pleaseth Let there∣fore magistrates as well as churchrulers in their punishing and censuring work make God's word their rule and if they do not perceive from it clearly the proper degrees of punishment and censure let them rather err on the charitable side than in approach∣es to severity  OBJECT XXIX  "But how are heretics blas∣phemers and idolaters to be got judged in order to punishment They must be judged only by their Peers by persons of the same station as themselves quite impartial and no wise attached to the contrary sentiments or practices"  ANSW But how can you prove from scripture or reason that such crimi∣nals must be judged only by their Peersor that there is a nation under heaven in which criminals are judg∣ed by such Peers as you mention Allowing that our juries consist of the proper Peers of the cri∣minals yet they judge not concerning the relevancy of the crime or the form or degree of punishments but of the proof of the factwhich in the case of heresy blasphemy or idolatry is ordinarily no more difficult than in the case of adultery incest theft murder  c  Nothing can be more absurd than to pretend that mens detestation of heresy blasphe∣my and idolatry disqualifies them from judging he∣retics blasphemers and idolaters What Doth mens abhorrence of theft murder adultery disqua∣lify them to judge of and punish those crimes Do God's infinite holiness and equity disqualify him from judging of sinners  OBJECT XXX  "If heretics blasphemers and i∣dolaters be punishable orthodox magistrates who happen to become governors of heretical blasphemous and idolatrous nations must kill the most of their subjects"  ANSW We hold none punishable espe∣cially in any severe manner till they appear openly obstinate in it notwithstanding sufficient means of conviction which these subjects are not supposed to have had and so are not punishable at all by magis∣trates Nothing and particularly the infliction of punishment ought to be done merely because it  is lawful till it also become expedient Cor vi x Eccl iii Now it would be highly inex∣pedient to proceed to extremities against the greater part of a society Nay in the case supposed they would prove a barbarously sinful mean of prejudicing men against the gospel of Christ Great diffe∣rence ought to be made between such as were never reformed from a false religion and those who obsti∣nately apostatize from the true religion to a false onebetween such as live in a nation generally corrupted with a false religion and those who live in a nation generally enlightened and reformed by the gospel of Christand between such as are only seduced and those who exert themselves to seduce others Much more forbearance is due to the former than to the lat∣ter for However peremptorily the Jews were commanded by God to punish even unto death the obstinate false prophets idolaters and blasphemers of their own church or nation they were never required to punish their idolatrous tributaries in their conquer∣ed countries of Syria Philistia Edom Ammon or Moab And meanwhile were never allowed and never did grant them any  legal establishment  or  autho∣ritative toleration  of their idolatry Even God himself for the ends of his glory exerciseth much forbearance towards heretics blasphemers and idola∣ters but never grants them any  legal establishment  or  authoritative toleration  securing them of protection in their wickedness Let magistrates who are  his mini∣sters for good  to men go and do so like wise  OBJECT XXXI  "The Christian law of doing to others that which we would have them do to us de∣mands That we should allow every man to think pro∣fess and act in religion as he pleaseth If we think men heretics blasphemers or idolaters our proper method is to manifest the utmost kindness and famili∣arity to them that we may gain them to the truth Every other method is no less dangerous than uncha∣ritable If orthodox Christian magistrates restrain and punish the spreading of Heathen Mahometan and Popish errors or worshipHeathen Mahometan and Popish princes will be thereby tempted to restrain and punish the spread of gospeltruth in their dominions  and can plead the very same right for their conduct"  ANSW Strange Did not God know the mean∣ing of his own law of equity and kindness between man and man and the true method of securing or propagating his own religion when he made or en∣couraged the laws against seducers idolaters and blasphemers above mentionedwhen he commanded his people to avoid false teachers and not so much as to lodge them in their houses With all your pretended benevolence Would you familiarly lodge in your family a notorious pick pocket or an harlot along with your own children in order to gain them to the ways of piety and virtue You would not Why then in direct contradiction to the command of God do you plead for familiarity with robbers of God defilers or murderers of souls The Christian law of kindness and equity requires me to do all that for the real welfare of my neighbour in subordinati∣on to the glory of God which I could lawfully wish him in like circumstances to do for me But must I do evil that good may come rendering my damna∣tion just Must I procure my just liberty to believe and serve God according to his own appointment by granting my neighbour an unjust an authoritative li∣cence to insult and blaspheme God and worship the devil in his stead Because I wish my neighbour to be helpful to me in honouring God and in labouring to render myself and others happy in time and eterni∣ty Must I assist and encourage them in horribly dis∣honouring God and destroying themselves and others None but an atheist who believes no real difference between moral good and evil can pretend it When and Where have Faithful adherents to gospeltruth got much liberty and safety by means of their friends encouraging and protecting gross herely blas∣phemy and idolatry Since Protestants became so kind to Papists in their dominions Have not the Po∣pish powers in return cruelly murdered banished or oppressed their Protestant subjects in Hungary Poland Germany France  c  till they have left few of them remaining While Britons were lavishly expending their blood and treasure in support of the Popish house of Austria about and She  returned our kindness in the most villanous destruc∣tion of about Congregations of our Protestant brethren in Silesia and Hungary Ought Elijah to have spared nay protected and encouraged the pro∣phets of Baal as a mean of securing for himself the protection of Ahab and Jezebel or because she was disposed to avenge their death Must thieves and rob∣bers be benevolently used protected and suffered to pass unpunished for fear of provoking their associ∣aus to revenge the just severities used towards them Let magistrates do their duty and leave events to God Till you honestly profess yourself an atheist who believes no  intrinsical difference between moral good and evil  never pretend that magistrates who have their whole power from God have any power against the truth or have a right to exercise that power de∣rived from God for the good of mankind to his dis∣honour and to the hurt of mankind Astonishing I Because a power originating from God may be right∣fully exercised in promoting his declarative glory the spread or protection of his gospel and the happi∣ness of mankindMay it must it therefore in the hand of other magistrates be rightfully exercised in promoting blasphemy and robbery of God and wor∣shipping of devilsBecause it may be rightfully ex∣ercised in punishing obstinate and notorious heretics blasphemers and idolatersMay it must it therefore be rightfully exercised in persecuting and murdering the faithful preachers and professors of Gospeltruths and worshippers of the true GodBecause magis∣trates in Britain have a right to punish thieves and murderers must these in France have as good a right to use Alms givers and skilful and diligent Physicians in the same mannerBecause that which tends to the highest honour of God and temporal and eternal happiness of mankind ought to be authoritatively to∣lerated nay established every wheremaymust that which tends to his highest dishonour and the most dreadful temporal and eternal ruin of mankind be every where in like manner tolerated or establish∣edBecause in a dearth benevolent persons may be tolerated nay highly encouraged in freely distribut∣ing wholsome provisions to the poor and needy may  or must malicious murderers be therefore tolerated and encouraged in distributing their poisoned morsels especially if abundantly sweetened among the unwary infants or others The restraint or  suitable  and  seasonable  punishment of that which is contrary to God's law being commanded by himself can never have any tendency to introduce corruptions in religi∣on or persecution for an adherence to gospeltruth And if some will abuse their power that must not hin∣der others either in church or state to use theirs a∣right  OBJECT XXXII  "If infidelity and difference in religion do not make void magistrates right to govern nations much less can heresy idolatry or blasphe∣my invalidate subjects right to protection or of ad∣mission to all the privileges of other subjects"  ANSW In almost every case the restraint or punishment of superiors is more difficult than that of inferiors If the professors of the true religion be the mino∣rity in number and power both scripture and reason demand their subjection to their common rulers in all their lawful commands till they become manifest tyrants and Providence afford a proper opportunity of shaking off their yoke But if the professors of the true religion be the majority in a nation or society both scripture and reason forbid their setting up a magistrate of a false religion or a wicked practiceand allow that if after his advancement he aposta∣tize and obstinately attempt to promote a false religi∣on or notoriously wicked practice he may be depos∣ed and even punished as far as the general welfare of the society in subordination to the glory of God can admit Psal xv Do you pretend to be wiser than God himself Without any apprehended inconsistency he commanded the Jews not  authori∣tatively to tolerate  protect and encourage but to punish blasphemers profaners of the Sabbath idola∣ters and false prophets Lev xxiv Num xv Deut xiv xvii Zech xiii and yet commanded them when they were the small mino∣rity in the Chaldean empire to serve the

Father must be excluded from all share in the tolera∣tion you plead for on account of their intolerant dis∣position unless they be infinitely altered from what they were in antient times You have already given up all your care for procuring the favour of the Popish powers to your Protestant brethren abroad by means of tolerating Papists Never pretend zeal against atheism till you be able to maintain your  tolerant  scheme upon other than the atheistical prin∣ciples mentioned near the beginning of this missive and to which you have had repeated recourse in your objectionsand till you allow mens rights or preten∣ces of conscience to warrant them to defame abuse rob and murder yourself as you allow with respect to God Your present objection is partly found∣in atheism Papists are excluded from toleration not at all as notorious blasphemers and idolaters but merely as not very like to prove faithful subjects to Protestant magistrates Atheists are excluded not as daring blasphemers or intentionally malicious murde∣rers of Jehovah but merely because they cannot give proper security for their good behaviour to magistrates and fellow subjects Thus no more regard is shewed to God the  King of nations  than might be expected among a nation of Atheists and the interests of men are altogether I might say infinitely preferred to his How are you to fix the  precise

zealously propagate the doctrines of devils and do worship them in idols and follow the pernicious practices abovementioned as the native consequences of error and idolatry Are not they plainly subject to another Head even the God of this world who is not much more friendly to magistrates and nations than the Romish Pope If men have conscience villainously to wrest the scrip∣ture to prove that Christ was originally a  mere mar  a  mere creature  and is now a  made God  What more security can we have by their oath than if they were professed Atheists None who plead tor the  au∣thoritative toleration  of heretics blasphemers and ido∣lators by the State can with any selfconsistent candor disallow of all toleration in the churchGod the King of nations hates these abominations as much as Christ the Head of the church Churchrulers have no other infallible rule to direct them in their decisi∣ons than magistrates have They are as unfit to judge of more refined errors as magistrates are to judge of gross errors blasphemies idolatries They have as little allowance from Christ to lord over mens consci∣ences or to impose their own opinions for articles of faith or rules of duty as magistrates have from God It is as difficult to fix precisely What is  censurable  and what not and the  proper degree of censure  answer∣able to every seandal in every circumstance as to six precisely  what  and  how  crimes ought to be punished by the magistrate Unrighteous censures for an adhe∣rence to truth and duty are as  real  and  more severe perfecution  than unrighteous punishments Articles and Confessions of Faith imposed by ecclesiastical an∣thority as much cramp Christian liberty as if they were established by the state Clergymen h  e as of∣ten abused their power about religion as e  States∣men did Their constitutions and councils have done as much hurt to it as these of magistrates ever did If it be difficult to get gross heretics blasphemers and idolaters judged restrained or punished by the State it will be found as hard to get ALL errors and ALL practical mistakes censured by the church Nay for  once that magistrates have erred in punishing heretics blasphemers and idolaters I believe clergymen have erred ten if not an hundred times in their censures And seldom have ever magistrates persecuted men for righteousness sake but when they were instigated to it by some clergymen  OBJECT XXXIV  "No carnal influence of ma∣gistrates relative to religion is consistent with the spi∣ritual nature of the kingdom of Christ which is not of this world John xviii The apostles used no carnal weapons of warfare in promoting it Cor x "  ANSW Why do not you state precisely what you mean by the  spiritual nature  of Christ's kingdom and its not being  of this world  Is it  so spiritual  that the members and subordinate rulers in it are not at the same time members in a civil state and interested in the welfare or hurt of it Is it  so spiritual  that it hath no manner of connexion or fellowship with the kingdom of God over the nation in which it resides and neither gives nor receives from it any more help∣fulness than from the kingdom of Belial Is it  so spi∣ritual  that the power of it cannot touch any part of mens conduct toward one another or even the ma∣gistratical administrations of its members Is it  so spi∣ritual  as to exclude the Most High King of nations and his deputed vicegerents from all regard to the honour of God and his religion and the welfare of the State as connected therewith leaving them no more concern therewith than if nations were herds of swine The question under consideration is not concerning the nature of Christ's kingdom of which the civil magistrate is not a ruler of any kind as hath been already manifested but Whether all care about the church and her religion as tending to promote the welfare of nations ought to be excluded from  God's kingdom  as the  Sovereign of nations  and he and his vicegerents obliged to manage that department as if there were no God in the earth Had Christ no  spiritual kingdom  in the days of Moses and the pro∣phets when God required magistrates to take care a∣bout religion and to restrain and punish the public atrocious insulters of it Had he  no spiritual kingdom  not of this world when he repeatedly drove the buy∣ers  and sellers out of the temple That the spi∣ritual nature of Christ's kingdom rendered it perfectly consistent with the full exercife of the magistratical power in the Roman empire or any other state which is what he meant in his answer to Pilate we readily grant but the inspired promises which have been re∣peatedly quoted Isa xlix lx Psal ii lxxii Rev xi xvii xxi sufficiently prove that the spiri∣tual nature of Christ's kingdom doth not exclude ma∣gistrates helpfulness to the truth in authorizing the profession and practice of it by their civil laws and in restraining the open and insolent blasphemers of it Though the weapons of ministers warfare in propagating the gospel be not carnal What is that to the case of magistrates And as the spiritual weapons of churchofficers reach as much to sins against the se∣cond table of the moral law as to those against the sirst they no more exclude the use of the magistrates carnal weapons against the atrocious sins against the first ta∣ble than with respect to those against the second Cor x Cor v Magistratical influence cannot set up Christ's kingdom in mens heart or o∣blige mens conscience to obey his laws in an acceptable manner but it can remove many external hindran∣ces and afford many external opportunities of his own setting up by means of his word and Spirit It can restrain burning of Bibles or abusing and murder∣ing of preachers and hearers of the gospel It can spread the scriptures and protect preachers of the truths contained in them and by command example and otherwise encourage the subjects to search the scriptures and to hear learn profess and practise the plain doctrines of the gospel In thus endeavour∣ing to make their subjects attend on receive and ob∣serve the doctrines of the gospel all  appearance of force  should be carefully avoided as that is apt to pro∣voke a dislike rather than to promote a chearful em∣bracement of them But force may be used to re∣strain or  duly  and  seasonably  punish the insolent op∣posers and revilers of the true religion which is esta∣blished And on no account ought such plagues of  nations as well as of churches to receive any  autho∣ritative licence  to commit such wickedness  OBJECT XXXV  "The annexing of temporal en∣couragements to the profession and practice of the Christian religion or external discouragements to the profession or practice of such

such as appeared notoriously wicked Psal cxix ci Neh vii xiii Nay David before hand publicly intimated his resolution to prefer only pious and faith∣ful menAnd why not when such bid fairest to be eminently useful officers in the state Why may not men even by external advantages be encouraged to an external attendance upon gospelordinances which by the blessing of God and the working of his Spirit may issue in rendering them eminently useful subjects and in their eternal salvation even as chil∣dren may be hired to that reading of their Bible and learning of their Catechism which may issue in their conversion and everlasting life Regard to the command of parents masters magistrates and mini∣sters all at once in our religious profession and prac∣tice is no way inconsistent with but may be delight∣fully subordinated to a supreme regard to the autho∣rity  of God in them Do you really think that those who believe neither a God nor a heaven nor a hell ought under pretence of civil right to be as readily admitted to places of power and trust in ci∣vil governments as the most piousNay are not even a profession and practice of the Christian religi∣on much more profitable in a nation than open blas∣phemy impiety and idolatry which we have heard from God's own word exceedingly corrupt mens mo∣rals and pull down the wrath of God on the society If such things only be restrained and punished as are plainly contrary to the law of God and a right conscience and never punished till after sufficient means of conviction have been afforded and trampled on how can that

a∣gainst innocence or virtue Punishment of men for what is plainly contrary to the word of God is no per∣secution for conscience sake but a proper correction of them for trampling on and murdering their consci∣ence  If by the blessing of God parents can do much to advance religion in their families without any furious or hurtful beating of their childrenand ministers do much to promote it in their congregati∣ons without proceeding perhaps once in their life to the higher excommunication and if both may do much to render their children and people useful mem∣bers of the commonwealth without having power to fine imprison or kill them why may not magistrates by their appointments encouragements and example much promote the profession and practice of revealed religion without proceeding unless very rarely to any disagreeable severitiesThe point we attemp∣ted directly to establish is that  magistrates ought never to grant an authoritative toleration to gross heresy blas∣phemy idolatry  you therefore act uncandidly in per∣petually haling in the affair of punishments even capital ones just as your tolerant friends the antient Remonstrants perpetually haled in the doctrine of re∣probation in order to render the sovereignty of God's grace odious to the people If magistrates take heed never to punish on the head of religious mat∣ters but when the CRIME is plainly relevant and ma∣nisest plainly contrary to the laws of God as well as to those of the land and that the punishment be SUITABLE and SEASONABLE circumstantially calcu∣lated to promote the real welfare of the

is plain Let magistrates and subjects impartially and earnestly search the ora∣cles of God depending on the illuminating influence of his SpiritLet every thing not contained in the scripture be thrown out of both civil and ecclesiastical establishments of religion and every thing plainly ap∣pointed therein for the gospel church be authorized Let the whole administration of government in church and

cir∣cumstances not a little difficult But not cavils how∣ever specious nor difficulty of upright performance of duty but demonstrative arguments of its sinful∣ness  will warrant my renouncing a principle which I have so solemnly espoused in ordination vows and co∣venants with God and far less to admit That mens conscience and magistrates ought in the name of God to  warrant encourage  and  protect  men in  gross here∣sy blasphemy  and  idolatry  though they cannot war∣rant encourage or protect them in doing any civil injury to men Perhaps Tindal alone hath raised as many shrewd objections against the divine authority of our Bible as have or can be raised against that power of magistrates mentioned in our Standards and yet Wo wo wo for ever to my soul if on that account I

authoritative toleration  of gross heresy blasphemy and ido∣latry to many if not all the Burgess Oaths in our country and to the established oaths of allegiance to His Majesty or even to his own Coronation Oath to maintain the true Protestant religion as by law esta∣blished in his dominions and to our Solemn vows in Baptism and the Lord's Supper I leave to some fit∣ter hand and shall only represent it as a violation of these public covenants with God which our fathers framed as their strongest human securities against gross heresy blasphemy idolatry Popery and every thing fimilar  Being treacherously and cruelly opposed in their re∣formation of religion by their two Popish Queens the Protestant Lords and others in Scotland entered into five several bonds A D in which they solemnly engaged to assist and protect each other in promoting the free exercise of the Protestant religion It was only the smaller part of the Protestants in our land which entered into these bondsnor doth it appear they were intended as ge∣neral obligationsBut when the Papists abroad were labouring with all their might to extirpate the Pro∣testant religion and the Pope was found to have granted dispensations for qualifying his votaries to undermine it in our landthe  National Covenant  was formed and sworn in in order to frustrate their attempts and secure the reformation attained In it the abominations of Popery were expresly and parti∣cularly abjured and it was understood as adhered to and renewed in every religious bond that sollowed After God had marvellously frustrated the attempts of the Spaniards and other Papists against Britain our fathers in thankfulness to Himand to secure themselves against the Popish confederates abroad and their friends at homewith much unanimity and joy renewed their  National Covenant  A D along with the subscription of a General Bond for preserva∣tion of the Protestant religion and the King's Majes∣ty In apprehensions of danger from the Po∣pish Lords and the treacherous regard shewed them by K James and especially a very extraordinary effu∣sion of the Holy Ghost on the General Assembly is∣sued in much solemn mourning for sin and renovati∣on of their covenant with God After forty years of fearful perfidious apostacy and much sinful veering towards the abjured abominations of Popery they awakened by K Charles and Archbishop Laud's im∣position of an almost Popish  Liturgy  and  Book of Ca∣nons  Searched out and lamented their perfidy to God as the cause of their manifold miseries and so∣lemnly renewed their covenant with Him as a mean of obtaining his gracious assistance and securing their Protestant religion and liberties Affrighted by the Papists massacring of about two hundred thousand  Protestants in Ireland instigated by their distresses in England and encouraged by the remarkable coun∣tenance of God's Spirit and Providence to the Scotch covenanters Most of the English and Irish Protestants in and along with them entered into a Solemn League and Covenant with God and with one another in which they expresly abjured Popery and Prelacy as a branch of itK Charles had scarce granted a peace a kind of establishment of their re∣ligion to the murderous Papists in Ireland and Duke Hamilton's attempts to restore him to his throne with∣out giving any security for religion or liberty miscar∣ried in England when the Scots and not a few of the Irish renewed their Covenant with a solemn acknow∣ledgment of sins and engagement to dutiesTo manifest the fearful perfidy of all  authoritative tolera∣tion  of gross heresy blasphemy idolatry Popery and every other form of encouragement to or recep∣tion of them the  solemn  the  religious  nature of these covenants and their  extensive  and  perpetual obligati∣on  must be considered  God alone bath a supreme and unlimited authority and right to regulate his own and the conduct of all his creatures Psal lxxxiii Dan iv James iv But the very constitution of a rational crea∣ture implies a power derived from him to govern it∣self even as mens standing in the relation of parents masters magistrates or churchrulers necessarily im∣plies their power to govern others  in subordination to him  By virtue of their divinely originated authority over others parents masters and other rulers make laws or binding rules for directing the external be∣haviour of those who are committed to their charge And by their authority derived from God to  rule their own  Spirit and to  govern  and  keep in subjection their whole body  Prov xvi James iii Cor ix all men are empowered to make for themselves laws of self engagement in promises oaths vows and co∣venants which extend to their purposes and inclinati∣ons as well as to their external acts And as all the authority which men have over themselves or others is derived srom that supreme and independent autho∣rity which is in God himself and is communicated  to them by an act of his will and is implied in his giving them such a nature and station it is plain that no human laws of authority or selfengagement can have any obligation or binding force but what are re∣gulated by and subordinated to the divine laws of na∣ture or revelation Cor xiii and that if such laws and engagements be lawful God not only doth but must necessarily ratify them his law requiring the fulsilment of them under pain of his highest dis∣pleasure Rom xiii Mat v  As no  deputed authority  derived from God can increase that supreme that infinite authority which he hath in himself so no human command or engagement can increase that infinite obligation to duty which his law hath  in itself  But if lawful they have in them a  real obligation distinct  though neither  separated  nor  separable  from the obligation of God's law To pre∣tend with Bellarmine and other Papists that our pro∣mises or vows do not bind us  in moral duties  comman∣ded by the law of God is manifestly absurd It ne∣cessarily infers that all human commands of superiors as well as human promises oaths vows and cove∣nants are in themselves destitute of  all binding force  except in so far as they relate to such trifling things as the law of God doth not require of men in such particular truths and thus saps the foundation of all relative order and mutual trust and confidence among mankind Commands of superiors must be  mere de∣clarations  of the will of God in his law and promises oaths vows and covenants must be nothing but  mere acknowledgments  that God's law requires such things from usin so far as relating to moral duties It re∣presents the authority which God hath in himself and with which he hath invested men as his deputies as so inconsistent and mutually destructive of each other that men cannot be bound to the same thing by both It represents the law of God as necessarily destructive of the being of an ordinance appointed by itself to promote the more exact observance of itselfin so far as that ordinance binds to a conscientious and diligent obedience to it It is contrary to the common sense of mankind in every age who have all along consi∣dered  mens promises oaths and covenants as  binding  them to pay their  just debts  perform their  just duties  of allegiance or the like and to declare the truth and nothing but the truth in witness bearing  c  It is contrary to scripture which represents promises pro∣missory oaths vows and covenants as things which are to be  performed paid  or  fufilled  and which may possibly be  transgressed and broken  Mat v Deut xxviii Eccl v Psal xxii l lxi lxvi lxxvi cxvi cxix Isa xix Judges xi Isa xxiv Jer xxxiv which represents an oath as a strong and decisive  confirmation  putting an end to all doubt or strife Heb vi and which in one of the plainest and least figurative chapters of it repeatedly represents a vow as constituted by our  binding ourselves binding our own souls with a bond  and represents a vow as a  bond  or  obligation  Heb ISSAR  a very fast and strait binding bond  or  obligation  as  our own bond  that stands upon or against us Num xxx  Selfbinding self engagements  is so much the  essential form  of vows and of all covenants promises or promis∣sory oaths whether of God or man that they can∣not exist at all or even be conceived of without it any more than a man without a soul or an angel with∣out an understanding and will To represent vowing as a  placing of ourselves more directly under the law of God  or any command of it or as a  placing of ourselves in some new relation to the law  is but an at∣tempt to render unintelligible that which the Holy Ghost hath in the abovementioned chapter labour∣ed to make plain if it doth not also import that we can place ourselves  more directly  under the moral law than God hath or can place us or more directly than Christ was placedTo pretend that mens commands or engagements derive their whole obligation from the  law of God's requiring  us to  obey  the oneand  pay  or  fulfil  or  perform  the other is no less absurdThese divine commands requiring us to obey pay perform or fulfil human laws and engagements  plain∣ly suppose  an  intrinfic  obligation in these laws and en∣gagements and powerfully enforce it But no law of God can require me to OBEY a human law or ful∣fil  an engagement which hath no obligation in itself any more than the laws of Britain can oblige me to PAY a Bill or FULFIL a Bond consisting of nothing but mere cyphers  The  intrinsic obligation  of promises oaths vows and covenants which constitutes their very essence or essential form is totally and manifestly distinct from the obligation of the law of God in many respects In his law God by the declaration of his will as our supreme Ruler binds us Deut xii In promises vows covenants and promissory oaths we as his deputygovernors over ourselves by a declaration of our will  bind ourselves with a bond bind our  uls with our own bond our own vow  Num xxx Psalm lxvi cxix  c  The obligation of our promises oaths and covenants is alway subject to examination by the standard of God's law as to both its matter and manner Thess v But it would be presumption blasphemous presumption to examine Whether what we know to be the law of God be right and obligatory or not James iv Isa viii Deut v The law of God ne∣cessarily binds all men to the  most absolute perfection in holiness  be they as incapable of it as they will Matth v Pet i No man can without mock∣ing and tempting of God bind himself by vow or oath to any thing but what he is able to perform No man may vow to do any thing which is not in his own power and for the performance of which he hath no promise of ability from God But no mere man since the fall is able in this life either in himself or by any grace received from God  perfectly  to keep the commandments of God Eccl vii James iii While God remains God his law can demand no less than absolute perfection in holiness While his word remains true no mere man since the fall in this life can possibly attain to it and therefore ought never to promise or vow it The least imperfection in holi∣ness however involuntary breaks the law of God and is even contrary to the duty of our relative stati∣ons of hushands parents masters magistrates mini∣sters wives children servants or people John iii Rom vii But it is only by that  which is in some respect  voluntary sinfulness  that we break our lawful vows Psal xliv Nothing can more clearly mark the distinction of the two obligati∣ons than this particular There is no evading the force of it but either by adopting the Arminian  new law  of sincere obedience or by adopting the Popish perfection of saints in this life The law of God binds  all men for ever  whether in heaven or hell Psal iii No human law or selfengagement binds men but  only in this life  in which they remain imperfect and are encompassed with temptations to seduce them from their duty In heaven they have no need of such helps to duty and in hell they can∣not be profited by them  The obligation of lawful promises oaths vows and covenants as well as of human laws respecting moral duties however  distinct  is no more separable from the obligation of God's law than Christ's  two distinct natures  are separable the one from the other but closely connected in manifold respects In binding ourselves to necessary duties and to other things so long and so far as is conducive thereto God's law as the only rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy him is made the rule of our engagement Our vow is no  new rule  of duty but a  new  bond to make the law of God  our rule  Even Adam's engagement to perfect obedience in the covenant of works was noth∣ing else His sallibility in his estate of innocence made it proper that he should be bound by his own consent or engagement as well as by the authority of God Our imperfection in this life and the temp∣tations which surround us make it needful that we in like manner should be bound to the same rule both by the authority of God and our own engage∣ments It is in the law of God that all our deputed authority to command others or to bind ourselves is allotted to us The requirement of moral duties by the law of God obligeth us to use all lawful means to promote the performance of them and hence requires human laws and selfengagements and the observance of them as conducive to it Nay they are also expres∣ly required in his law as his ordinances for helping and hedging us in to our duty In making lawful  vows as well as in making human laws we exert the  deputed authority  of God  the supreme Lawgiver  grant∣ed to us in his law in the manner which his law prescribes and in obedience to its prescription In forming our vows as an instituted ordinance of God's worship which he hath required us to receive observe and keep pure and entire Psal lxxvi cxix lvi Isa xix xlv xliv Jer l Cor viii we act precisely according to the direction of his law and in obedience to his au∣thority in it  binding ourselves with a bond binding our soul with a bond  Num xxx  binding our∣selves by that which we utter with our lips  ver  binding ourselves with a binding oathbinding our∣selvesbinding our soul by our own vowour own bond  ver In forming our vow we according to the prescription of his own law solemnly constitute God who is the supreme Lawgiver and Lord of the consciencethe witness of our selfengagement and the Guarantee graciously to reward our evangelical fulfilment of it and justly to punish our perfidious violation of it The more punctual and faithful ob∣servation of God's law notwithstanding our mani∣fold infirmities and temptations and the more effec∣tual promoting of his glory therein is the END of our selfengagements as well as of human laws of autho∣rity And by a due regard to their binding force as above stated is this end promotedas hereby the ob∣ligation of God's law is the more deeply impressed on our minds and we are shut up to obedience to it and deterred from transgressing itIn consequence of our formation of our vow with respect to its matter manner and end as prescribed by God He doth and necessarily must ratify it in all its awful solemnities requiring us by his law to  pay  it as a bond of  debt  to  perform  and  fulfill  it as an engagement to duties and an  obligation  which  stands upon  or  against  us Num xxx with Deut xxiii Psalm lxxvi l Eccl v Mat v In o∣bedience to this divine requirement and considering our vow in that precise form in which God in his law adopts and ratifies it and requires it to be ful∣filled  We pay perform and fulfil it  as a bond  wherewith we in obedience to Him  have bound ourselves  to endeavour universal obedience to his law as our only rule of faith and manners Who∣ever doth not in his attempts to obey human laws or to fulfil selfenagements consider them as having that binding force which the law of God allows them he pours contempt on them as ordinances of God and on the law of God for allowing them a  binding force  Thus through maintaining the  superadded  but  subor∣dinate  obligation of human laws and of selfengage∣ments to moral duties we do not make void but es∣tablish the obligation of God's law  The obligation of a vow by which we engage our∣selves to necessary duties commanded by the law of God must therefore be INEXPRESSIBLY SOLEMN Not only are we required by the law of God before our vow was made but we are bound in that per∣formance to fulfil our vow as an engagement or o∣bligation founded in the supreme authority of his law warranting us to make it We are bound to fulfil it as a  mean of further impressing  his authority manifested in his law upon our own consciencesas a bond se∣curing and promoting a faithful obedience to all his commandments We are bound to fulfil it in obe∣dience to that divine authority by derived power from which we as governors of ourselves made it to pro∣mote his honour In those or like respects our ful∣filment of our vows is a direct obedience to his whole lawWe are moreover bound to fulfil it as a so∣lemn ordinance of God's worship the essential form of which lies in  selfobligation  and must be received observed kept pure and entire and holily and reve∣rently used and so in obedience to Command I II III We are bound to fulfil it as an ordinance of God in which we have  pledged our own truth sincerity and faithfulness  and so in obedience to Command IX I II III We are bound to fulfil it as a solemn deed or grant in which we have made over our persons property and service to the Lord and his church and so in obedience to Command I II VIII nay in obedience to the whole law of love and equity Mat xxii vii We are bound to fulfil it  from regard to the declarative glory of God as the witness of our making of it that he may appear to have been called to attest nothing but sincerity and truth and so in obedience to Command I III IX We are bound to fulsil it from a regard to  truth honesty  and  reverence of God  as things not only com∣manded by his law but good in themselves agree∣able to his very nature and therefore necessarily com∣manded by himand from a detestation of falsehood injustice and contempt of God as things intrinsically evil contrary to his nature and therefore necessarily forbidden in his law and thus in regard to his au∣thority in his whole law as necessarily holy just and good We are bound to fulfil it from a regard to the holiness justice faithfulness majesty and other perfections of God as the Guarantee of it into whose hand we have committed the determination and exe∣cution of its awful sanctionas the gracious rewar∣der of our fidelity or just revenger of our perfidyand hence in regard to our own happiness as con∣cerned in that sanctionIn fine We are bound to fulfil it in obedience to that command of God which adopts and ratifies it requiring us to  pay fulfil  or  per∣form  our vow oath or covenant Psal l lxxvi Eccl v Deut xxiii Mat v  In VIOLATING such a vow We do not merely transgress the law of God as requiring the duties en∣gaged before the vow was made But we also rebel against and profane that divine warrant which we had to make our vow We profane that authority over ourselves in the exercise of which we made the vow and consequentially that supreme authority in God from which ours was derived and so strike a∣gainst the foundation of the whole law We mani∣fest a contempt of that law which regulated the mat∣ter and manner of our vow We profane the vow as an ordinance of God's worship appointed in his law By trampling on a noted mean of promoting obedience to all the commands of God We mark our hatred of them and prepare ourselves to transgress them and endeavour to remove the awe of God's au∣thority and terror of his judgments from our conscien∣ces We blasphemously represent the Most High as  a willing Witness to our treachery and fraud We pour contempt on him as the Guarantee of our en∣gagements as if he inclined not or durst not avenge our villainy Contrary to the truth and faithfulness required in his law and pledged in our vow we plunge ourselves into the most criminal deceit and falsehood Contrary to equity we rob God and his church of that which we had solemnly devoted to their service Contrary to devotion we banish the serious impression of God's adorable perfections Contrary to good neighbourhood we render ourselves a plague and curse and encourage others to the most enor∣mous wickedness Contrary to the design of our creation and preservation we reject the glory of God and obedience to his law from being our end Mean∣while we trample on the ratification of our vow by the divine law in all its awful solemnities and mani∣fold connections with itselfand requirement to pay it  It is manifest that our covenanting ancestors un∣derstood their vows in the manner above represented They never represent them as  mere acknowledgments  of the obligation of God's law or as placing themselves in  some new relation to God's law  or  more directly under  any command of it But declare that a man  binds him∣self  by a promissory oath to what is good and justIt cannot oblige to sin but in any thing not sinful being taken it binds to performanceBy a vow  we more strictly bind ourselves to necessary duties  Confess

of them  II These public covenants of our ancestors in which they abjured the Popish and other abominati∣ons may be called NATIONAL because the represen∣tatives or the greater or better part of the nation jointly entered into them as covenants of duty graft∣ed upon the covenant of grace But they ought never to be called  national  or  civil  in order to exclude them from being  churchcovenants  and thus diminish the solemnity or continuance of their obligation Both church and state jointly promoted them and in dif∣ferent respects they related to both being at once cove∣nants of men with God and with one another In so far as therein they covenanted with one another with an  immediate  view to promote or preserve what belong∣ed to the state they served instead of a civil bond But at the same time they covenanted with one ano∣ther as churchmembers in subordination to their covenanting with God himself as their principal partyThe ratifications given to these covenants by the State were really  civil ratifications  which adopted them as a part of the laws of the StateBut that no more rendered them  merely civil  covenants than the civil ratifications given to and embodying our Confessions of Faith made them  merely civil con∣fessions  and mere acts of Parliamentor than the repeated legal establishment of our Protestant religion in doctrine worship discipline and government made it a mere  civil religion  These covenants were some∣times used as means of promoting civil purposes But that will no more prove them merely civil than the  use of fasting and prayer for advancing or securing the welfare of the State will prove them a  mere civil worshipping of God  These covenants were formed for promoting the happiness of both church and state and were calculated to answer that end But so is the chris∣tian religion and all the ordinances of it if duly obser∣ved Tim i Prov xiv I admit that there was sometimes too mixed an interference of civil and ec∣clesiastical power in enjoining these covenants But abuse of things doth not alter their nature God's ordinances are too often used in a carnal sensual and devilish manner without ever being rendered such themselves It is only as  really religious covenants  and not as  civil  or  state covenants  they can be adopt∣ed into ordination vows or baptismal engagements And that they were such the following arguments evince  The Covenanters themselves who best knew their own intentions do times without number re∣present them as Vows which their Confession de∣clares to be a  religious ordinance  as  covenants with God  which must be  religious  if any dealings with him be so  Chap XXII Lar Cat Q Calderwood's Hist P Dickson Henderson and Cant's answers to doctors of Aberdeen p Act of Assembly p

covenant with God and among ourselvesIf it should seem meet to your prudence to think of joining in the  religious fellowship  of such a covenant"  How absurd for persons of weaker capacities and less instructed by the Spirit of God to pretend at this distance of time to know better the nature of their covenants than themselves did  Except perhaps in the church in her Ge∣neral Assemblies or Commissions took the lead in promoting the covenanting work And the state when it did any thing did little more than ratify the deeds of the church appointing these covenants to be sworn  Calderwood P

ordinance  To protect them from the insults of Popish and other profane op∣posers the ministers in A D had a royal com∣mission and a number of attendants appointed them when they administered the

accord to the na∣ture of a religious engagement As Christians and not merely as civil lords they bound themselveschiefly to promote the true religion according to God's wordHad K James been not only the original adviser but even the framer of the  National Covenant  it might nevertheless have been a religious bond The psalms which K David penned and James versified are not thereby rendered

merely civil  though in and the State took the lead in the ratification and establishment before any General Assembly of these periods It is not improbable that the ministers of the church had a principal hand in the origination of our national covenant In James was about fourteen years of age and by no transcendent genius qualified for the work Just before and quickly after we find him

sessions of the Assembly October by some parasite of the court Calderwood's history at least his printed abridgment is imperfect on this period He only says that  "the second Confession of Faith i e

ministers to see that this Confession of Faith be subscribed by all under their chargeThe Assem∣bly in February enjoined all ministers to deal with noblemen and gentry to subscribe this Confession of FaithIn March the privy council at the earnest desire of the Assembly appointed about ninetysix ministers to conveen before them persons of all ranks to subscribe the Confession and general BondThe

The origination of the Solemn League and Cove∣nant was equally consistent with a  religious vow  Not a few of the most pious clergymen in England had all along from Elizabeth's establishment of the Protestant religion hated part of the ceremonies and the lord∣ly power of the bishops Many of these driven from their charge by the Prelatical persecution under Eli∣zabeth and James and Charles I had been compas∣sionately taken into the families of great men for the education of their children Their instruction and e∣xample were remarkably blessed for rendering their pupils and others intelligent and pious They per∣ceived the encroachments made upon their religion and liberties by Abp Laud and his assistants and not a few of them conceived a strong relish for what was then called Puritanism The success of the Scotch covenanters in their struggles with the tyrannical court made many of the English wish and hope for a similar deliverance In their treaty with Charles the Scots requested that the English should be brought to a reformed uniformity with themselves in religion The Scotch ministers who attended their Commissio∣ners at London in forming that treaty of peace by their instructions and example recommended their Presbyterian reformation not a little to many of the most learned and pious of the English A correspon∣dence for promoting a religious uniformity between the two churches was carried on by a number of the English clergymen with the Scotch Assemblies and by the English parliament with the Assemblies At their request the As∣sembly appointed Messrs Henderson Rutherford Gil∣lespy and others to assist the Westminster Assembly in compiling  ecclesiastical Standards  of doctrine wor∣ship discipline and government Alarmed by the terrible massacre of the Protestants in Ireland and re∣duced to stra  ts in their war with K Charles the English Parliament requested that for promoting and  establishing uniformity in religion and preserving their respective liberties the two nations might be more closely connected by a mutual League The Letter from a multitude of English ministersthe papers from the English parliament and their Commissioners and the Scotch Assembly's answers manifest that an uniformity of religion was the principal thing propos∣ed by this League Henry Vane and perhaps some o∣ther English Commissioners nevertheless from a dis∣like of the Scotch Presbyterianism thought to have gone no further than a  civil  league but the Scots be∣ing positive for a  religious  one he yielded It appear∣ed from that readiness and avidity with which the Solemn League was received in England that it an∣swered to the wishes of his constituents After the Westminster Assembly had examined and approved it the English Parliament appointed it to be sworn by persons of all ranks and issued forth instructions and an exhortation for promoting that work  Neal's history of Puritans Vol I II III Naphtali p Stevenson Vol III Baillie's Let Vol I Acts

whatever else should by the word of God be found contrary to said doctrine worship discipline and government and holy practice The preservation of the King's person and authority and of the rights and

that all these expressions in their several bonds represent men  merely as members of a commonwealth  employed in  mere statecovenanting  The ends of their covenanting expressed in their several bonds are  religious  not  merely civil  In and they covenanted in order to  pro∣mote and preserve the profession and practice of the true Protestant religion  in order to  advance the kingdom of Christ  as the  principal  and the welfare of their country as their  subordinate  endIn they cove∣nanted as a  means of obtaining the Lord's special sa∣vour  and of  recovering the purity of religion

such a deep sense of reli∣gion as all the profaneness and persecution of twenty eight years could not eradicateis no contemptible evidence that He looked upon them as religious not merely state covenants It is at our infinite hazard if we call that  common and unclean  which God hath so singularly honoured  OBJECT I  "Our Covenanters characterizing themselves  Noblemen Barons Burgesses  and

himself King of Israel in his Proverbs and Ecclesiastes rendered these two books merely civil not religious If in a Bond or Bill I denominate myself  minister of the gos∣pel  Will that render the Bond

mark the great harmo∣ny of all ranks for the encouragement of their friends and the terror of their malicious enemies There was no irreligion in subjecting themselves and all their honours to the service of Jesus Christ as made of God Head over all things to his Church Revel xxi  OBJECT II  "In and they framed their covenants to admit Episcopalians and Indepen∣dents whom they would not have admitted to the sacraments"  ANSW As in taking these covenants men bound themselves to the regular reformation of every thing found sinful when tried by the word of God our ancestors agreeable to Rom xiv Isaiah xxxv were willing to help forward the weak and admit to their covenant and church fellowship every person who appeared willing to receive more light even though they were not in every respect e∣qually enlightened and reformed as themselves But I defy you to prove that they excluded one upright covenanter from their religious communion The covenants of and were not framed to admit any who resolved obstinately to adhere to Episcopacy or Independency In the bond of men bound themselves to forbear the practice of Episcopa∣lian government and of the articles of Perth till they should be TRIED and ALLOWED in a free General Assembly The covenanters declare that their inten∣tion in that bond was against all innovations and corruptions  Stevenson's hist P  In the covenant of

civil penalties to partake at least once a year of the Lord's Supper rendered it a merely civil ordinance An ordinance may re∣main  religious  though a civil sanction should be sin∣fully annexed to it If which I do not you be∣lieve that Asa and Josiah by penal laws compelled men to take their covenants you can scarce condemn our covenanters annexing civil penalties to the refusal of their bonds especially as they knew it would scarce come from any but such as were malignant ene∣mies to the civil as well as religious liberties of the na∣tion In and these covenants had no penalty either civil or ecclesiastical annexed to the not swearing of them without any hint from the covenanters that this altered the na∣ture of the engagement  OBJECT IV  "Our ancestors gave up with their covenanting work whenever they got the state of the  nation settled by means of it and having got their civil liberties otherwise secured at the Revolution they never covenanted at all"  ANSW Did ten years of murderous invasion and outrageous conten∣tion and twentyeight years of horrible profaneness and persecution make our nation so happy that co∣venanting with God our deliverer was no more nece∣ssary Or Have the fearful profanation of the name of God by unnecessary and wicked oaths or the shocking bribery and perjury too common in the e∣lection of our Representatives in Parliament and our other outrageous abominations rendered Britain so holy that these covenants need no more be regard∣ed Not the alteration of the national affairs to the better but the alteration of mens hearts to the worse made covenanting with God to be so contemned at the Restoration and Revolution  III That these  solemn  and  religious  covenants with God in which all gross heresy blasphemy idolatry Popery and other abominations have been repeatedly abjured bind not only the immediate swearers or sub∣scribers but  all their posterity and other representees in all generations following to a saithful performance of every thing engaged  must now be demonstrated  That which is engaged in these covenants being moral duty commanded by the law of God is of  perpetual obligation  The whole faith and practice to which we therein engage are stated from the oracles of God in our excellent Standards If the matter in itself were contrary to God's law no human cove∣nant could bind us or any represented by us to it for a moment We can have no power from God to bind ourselves or others to any thing sinful Cor xiii Nor can any human deed be valid in opposi∣tion to his supreme authorityIf the matter were indifferent no vow or promissory oath could lawful∣ly constitute a  perpetual obligation  as the alteration of circumstances might render it very unexpedient and unedifying Cor vi x xvi Rom xiv But if that which is engaged be precisely what every person in every age or circumstance is  bound to by the antecedent tie of the law of God no man can be in the least abridged of any lawful liberty by being brought under the most solemn obli∣gation of an oath or vowThe strictest fulfilment of it cannot but tend to the real profit of every one concerned both in his personal and his social capaci∣ty Psal xix Cor xv Isa iii Proverbs xiv Rom ii It is therefore for the ad∣vantage of us and our posterity to be hedged in and bound up to the most exact conformity to God's law by every mean which he requires or allows in his wordeven as it is for our advantage to have our li∣berty bounded by the ledges of bridgesThe law of God requires us to do every thing which is calculat∣ed to promote or secure our own or our children's walking in the truth Gen xvii Psal xlv lxxviii Isa xxxviii John ver It re∣presents solemn vows as a mean most effectual to an∣swer this purpose Psal cxix lxxvi l lvi lxvi lxi cxvi cxxxii Gen xxviii Deut v xxix Josh xxiv Chron xv xxiii xxiv xxxiv Ezra x Neh ix x Isa xix xliv xlv Jer l Cor vii  By the repeated judicial acts of both church and state approving and imposing these covenants they were constituted the  adopted laws  of both proper to be acknowledged and submitted to by all their mem∣bers in the most solemn manner which their circum∣stances permittedSeveral of these acts as well as the best duties of Christians had their sinful infirmities particularly on the head of penalties which I mean not to defend But in so far as these acts approved and authorized these covenants which bound men to receive and hold fast such temporal and spiritual pri∣vileges as God had given them and thankfully im∣prove them to his gloryand required a Christian regular and seasonable taking of themthey were certainly good and valid Being good in themselves and the exact performance of them calculated to pro∣mote the glory of God and eminent welfare of both church and state these covenants if once regularly  adopted as laws must remain obligatory upon the a∣dopting societies while they exist Civil rulers being ordained  ministers of God for good  to men Rom xiii and church officers appointed by Christ for the  edifying of his body  Eph iv have no power against the truth but for the truth Corinth xiii and so can no more repeal a law which promotes only that which is morally good any more than they can give validity to a sinful oneThese covenants must therefore in the view of God and conscience continue binding as laws divinely ratifi∣ed upon us as subjects and as Christians But it is their much more solemn obligation as  public Vows  and  Covenants with God  which I mean to establish par∣ticularly with reference to Scotland  The matter of these vows being morally good calculated to promote the holiness and happiness of e∣very person in every age the immediate covenanters were such as laid every possible foundation of trans∣mitting the obligation of their vow to the whole church and nation to all generations The REPRESENTA∣TIVES of both church and statethe MAJORITY of the Society and our own PARENTS in their respec∣tive stations took these covenants What could tran∣smit and extend an obligation to posterity if all this did not You cannot but allow that even in private civil deeds the obligation is extended far beyond the  immediate engagers  In bonds respecting money or service men bind not only themselves but their suc∣cessors and assigns especially if they have the con∣tinued right to or possession of that fund or property from which that money or service natively ariseth The obligations contained in a call to a minister fix on the whole congregation if subscribed by the majority without any regular dissentand on such as after∣wards accede to it The treaties of peace traffick  c  contracted by Kings Parliaments Magistrates are held binding on their subjects and even on their posterity They who accede to any society fall un∣der the binding force of its social engagements for debt duty  c  If bonds and covenants did only bind immediate contractors nothing but the wildest disorder would ensue If the immediate engagers  quickly after died they who trusted to their engage∣ment might be totally ruinedA minority who had been silent during the transaction might in a few days overturn a bond or contract of the majori∣ty Subjects might at their pleasure render void the contracts and treaties of their rulers To pretend that men may not use the same freedom in binding their representees and posterity to God as in binding them to men is highly absurd and shocking as it represents God as more dangerous and less honoura∣ble and useful to be dealt with than the very worst of men Why may not a parent in offering his child to God in baptism take hold of God to be his God and the God of his seed after him to all generationsand dedicate not only that child but all his poste∣rity to God as his honoured vassals and servants Gen xvii Acts ii Is this less dutiful safe or honourable than to infeft himself and them in some earthly property and bind them as possessors of it to be the vassals of some sinful superiorIf the majority of a society especially in distress may put the whole under the authority and protection of a man who is a great sinner why must they act either wickedly or foolishly if by a solemn dedication they put it under the especial care and protection of the Great GOD our Saviour Rev xi Psal ii xxii If the representatives of a people may bind them to live peaceably and trade honestly with earthly neighbours or may in some cases sub∣ject them to the power laws or exactions of other earthly superiorswhy allow them no power to stu∣dy peace with God and to follow peace with all men and holinessNo power to surrender them to God to be ruled by his lawand to render him his due re∣venues of honourHath not God an original and supreme right to all men as his creatures subjects and children Are they not all bound by his law to the whole of that duty to which we contend any man ought to be bound by a vow of  perpetual obliga∣tion  Is it not inexpressibly honourable safe and pro∣fitable to stand under the special care of and in rela∣tion to God in Christ Deut iv xxxiii  Why then more shy of devoting posterity or other representees to him than to a sinful man and his ser∣vice  In covenants with men a proper and timely dissent may frequently be well founded and may effectually divert this obligation from the dissenters But how there could be a lawful dissent from an engagement carefully to keep all the commandments of God and nothing else I know not Had the whole or even the body of the Hebrew nation timely and regularly dissented from the treaty made by their princes with the Gibeonites it might have diverted its obligation from themInslead of this they appear to have a∣greed to the final stating of it without a single mur∣mur Josh ix But if these princes had by cove∣nant devoted themselves and their tribes to a careful keeping of God's commandments I know not how the people's dissent could have diverted the obligation from themselvesIn covenants with men the nonfulfilment of some condition or some dispensation or remission may weaken if not perfectly annul the ob∣ligation But none can dispense with or grant re∣missions in the matters of God Covenants made with God are more absolute and less clogged with conditions and so  more obliging  The covenants of which we now treat being about indispensible duties of morality upon which dependeth the glory of God the advancement of the kingdom of Jesus Christ the honour and happiness of magistrates and the public liberty safety and peace of the nation and the good of posterity in all time coming ought to have their obligation allowed to fix wherever any ground can be found while Christ hath a kingdom and the cove∣nanters a posterity particularly in Scotland for  Our civil Representatives by these covenants devoted themselves in their station and their subjects in so far as under their power to the service of God In and King James and his privy council took the  National Covenant  and required their sub∣jects to follow their example In the privy council again took it as it stood in In the members of Parliament took it as explained by the Assembly to abjure  Prelacy  and the  five ar∣ticles  of Perth  and appointed it to be sworn by all the members of every future Parliament It was sworn by the members of Parliament In the national covenant and the Solemn League which was materially the same were renewed by the members of Parliament with solemn fasting and humiliation The oath framed in to be sworn by members of Par∣liament at taking their seats expresly approved the national covenant King Charles I gave a solemn approbation of it King Charles II and other magis∣trates took the covenants in and Now if a covenant made by the princes of Israel with the representatives of the Gibeonites in a matter which concerned the  Lord's land  and the  remote service os his altar  extended its obligation to the whole nation of Israel who consented to it no otherwise than by si∣lence at the final stating of itand to their posterity for many generationsthat four hundred years after they were punished with a famine on account of Saul's breach of it Josh ix with Sam xxi and to the Gibeonites and their posterityWhy not allow the covenanting deed of our Princes to extend its obliga∣tion in like manner If magistrates be the  ministers of God for good  to men Why should they not be ca∣pable to surrender themselves and their subjects to the special care and service of God their common and beneficent Superior If they possess the powers assign∣ed them in our excellent Standards Why may they not as  nursing sathers  of the church devote them∣selves and their subjects of the same true religion to the enjoyment of God himself in his oracles and or∣dinances and to serve Him regularly in Christ If Joshua could bind himself and his family to serve the Lord why may not magistrates bind themselves and their subjects of the same true religion to receive and hold fast the like honour and happiness If for the benefit of their subjects magistrates may in a time of need subject themselves and their people to some powerful Monarch whose fury is terrible but his fa∣vour extremely profitable or may approve and ratify some former grant of that kindWhy may they not for the same end devote themselves and subjects to the Great GOD our Saviour and Prince of the kings  of the earth Why may they not bring their glory in∣to the church and as judges kiss the Son of God solemnly approving and in their station ratifying that grant which his Father made to him of the outer∣most ends of the earth Rev xxi xi Prov viii Psal ii  In these covenants our Representatives in the church in their station devoted themselves and their people to the faith profession and obedience of Christ In April the General Assembly unanimously approved the  national covenant  and then in October ensuing in the name of Christ appointed it to be sub∣scribed by all Protestants In and they made further acts for promoting this subscription The general Assemblies of and the Commissions or Assemblies of enjoined the swearing of the covenant by all a∣dult churchmembers I do not know of one Presby∣terian minister or ruling elder in Scotland who in a∣ny of the covenanting periods of declined taking it Now if ci∣vil representatives may bind their subjects and their posterity by civil contracts Why ought not the har∣monious dedication of themselves and people to God by churchrulers to have a like binding force If in public prayers ministers may devote themselves and congregations to Christ why may not they and ruling elders conjunctly do it by public covenant But we do not chiefly rest the matter on these grounds for  It is beyond all contradiction that the lawful and public covenants civil or religious which are made by parents do bind their posterity The oath of Esau in which he resigned his birthright to Jacob bound his posterity never to attempt recovering the privileges of it from Jacob or his descendents Hence Esau and his family after the death of Isaac remov∣ed intirely from Canaan Gen xxv xxxvi Even the public curse which the Jews took upon themselves and their children hath been manifestly binding on them these seventeen hundred years past Mat xxvii The vow of parents in the antient circumcision or the Christian baptism of their infants  extends to these childrennay according to the ex∣tent of God's covenant and promise to all their future seed Gen xvii Acts ii Hence what∣ever any of them do contrary to that vow must at once be perfidy and rebellion against God Nor will their wilful or slothful ignorance of that obligation or their nonconsent to it when grown up free them from that guilt any more than ignorance of Adam's covenant or of the breach of it can free his posterity from the guilt of his first sin or from perfidy in their personal violations of that covenant of works In Deut v God by Moses declares that the co∣venant made with the Israelites at Sinai was not made with them only but with all that new generation of their children and grand children who survived them Num xxvi In Deut xxix he declares that the covenant taken by that new genera∣tion in the plains of Moab did not only bind them who were alive and present at the entrance into it but also others even their posterityTheir covenant with the Gibeonites did not only bind the immediate engagers and consenters but also their posterity ma∣ny ages afterward Josh ix with Sam xxi Now these covenants of allegiance to God and duty to men of which we are treating were sworn and subscribed by our own  natural  tho' now  mediate  parents and when it is considered how FREQUENT∣LY that covenant the same in substance in the seve∣ral Bonds was sworn or subscribed and how GENE∣RALLYand how readily some covenanted on one occasion whose ancestors had not on a precedingand how families have been since intermixed it will scarce remain probable that there is a Scotchman at least on the continent of Britain or Ireland who is not descended from some covenanter If any to his own disgrace will contend that in all these and diffe∣rent periods of covenanting  c  all his progenitors were such mere neutrals or malignant opposers of the true reli∣gion and liberties of the country that none of them took the covenant let him take heed lest after all God his Creditor find him a perjured transgressor of the covenant of his fathersor at least of the cove∣nant  made by his church and nation and their respec∣tive Representatives  That lawful covenants made by the greater part of a society bind the whole and every future acceder to itat least unless the minority or acceders have by a proper dissent diverted the obligation from themselvesand that if remarkably calculated to promote the common advantage they bind the mem∣bers of it while it continues a societyCommon sense will not allow us to doubt That the exact ful∣filment of our covenants with God is remarkably cal∣culated to promote the honour of Christ and his Fa∣ther and the welfare of both church and state hath been formerly hinted No person therefore could or can by any lawful dissent divert their binding force from himself Nor do I remember of any who regularly attempted it in Scotland  Without doubt the majority nay body of the Scotch nation nation entered into their Solemn Cove∣nant with God In both the privy council and the General Assembly in their respective acts enjoined the taking of the National Covenant  "In this year in

that the Irish Prelates had exclaimed against it and concurred with Lord lieutenant Strafford in imposing an oath renouncing itThe Scots who were generally dissenters  i e Presbyterians  took arms against the Popish  massacrers  and were the first that appeared in Ulster against the common enemy who were then exercising unheard of crueltyWith the Scotch army of six thousand under Gener Alexan∣der Lesly which were sent to check the ravage of the murderous Papists ministers were sent to attend the several regiments who associating themselves with some formerly in Ireland formed themselves into a Presbytery in which Lesly and several other officers of the army sat as ruling eldersThey preached both in camp and countryAt this time those who  had fled from Ireland on account of the oath impos∣ed by Strafford before the massacre begun returned in great numbers and joined with the Scotch army and Sir John Clotworthy a zealous puritan so that he with his party scoured the whole county of Antrim  from massacring Papists  When the established  i e  Episcopalian clergy were generally destroyed by the massacre or had fled the work of the ministry was mostly in the hands of Presbyterians who with in∣defatigable industry attended both camp and country not without comfortable successIn the I∣rish Protestants petitioned the Scotch General Assem∣bly that some ministers of the gospel might be sent to comfort them in their great calamity when by the massacre left as without shepherds and particularly that their own ministers who had been formerly ba∣nished by Abp Laud's

people and trusting to his covenant of grace and promise and not to their covenant or engagement We in these lands have devoted ourselves to the Lord in which we were warranted by many scripture precedentsNever was an action done more se∣dately and advisedlyThe binding obligation of it upon us is plain If we have the benefit of that reli∣gion to which our forefathers swore we must be heirs of that oath they came under to the Most High as Levi paid tithes in his father's loins so we in our forefathers swore to this covenant We are obli∣ged to stand to it though it were never so many years

prevarication therefore in favours of Pre∣lacy or Independency cannot free them from the ob∣ligation of an oath which strikes against both As the Scots stood bound by their National Covenant to every duty contained in the Solemn League long before the English had a thought of covenanting a∣long with them and did also swear the solemn league no neglect or prevarication of either English or Irish can free us from our obligation It was neither to the English nor to the Irish but chiefly to the faithful and unchangeable God of all grace that our fathers bound themselves and their seed The Assembly in their  Letter to the council of London  justly observe  "It is not in the power of any human authority to absolve you from adhering to this so solemnly sworn League and Covenant"  And in another letter  "The cove∣nant hath been broken by many in both kingdomsWe do not doubt but there are  many seven thou∣sands  in England who have retained their integrity in that business"  And in their  Warning    "The violation of the covenant by some in England doth not set us free from the obligation of it No laws nor authority on earth can absolve us from so solemn an obligation to the Most HighWe are not acquit∣ted from the obligation of our solemn covenants be∣cause of the troublesIn the worst of times all those duties whereunto by covenant we oblige our∣selves do still ly upon usWe have sworn and we must perform it"  And in their  Warning    "Al∣beit the League and Covenant be despised by that pre∣vailing party in England yet the obligation of that covenant is  perpetual  and all the duties contained  therein are constantly to be minded and prosecuted by every one of us and our  posterity  according to their place and station"  And in their  Letter to breth∣ren in England  "Although there were none in the one kingdom who did adhere to the covenant yet were not the other kingdom nor any person in either of them absolved from the bond thereof since in it we have not only sworn by the Lord but also cove∣nanted with him It is not the failing of one or more that can absolve others from their duty or TIE to him Besides the duties therein contained being in them∣selves lawful and the grounds of our TIE thereto moral though others forget their duty yet doth not their defection free us from that obligation which lies upon us by the covenants in our places and stations The covenant being intended as one of the best means of stedfastness it were strange to say that the back∣slidings of any should absolve others from the TIE thereof especially seeing our engagement therein is  not only national  but personalAll these kingdoms joining together to abolish that oath by law could not dispense therewith much less can any one of them or any party in either do the sameThey are testi∣monies which the Lord Christ hath entred as protesta∣tions to preserve his right in these ends of the earth long ago given unto him for his possession and of late confirmed by solemn covenant"  OBJECT III  "The influence of the Highland thiefs and the gross ignorance of the Scotch islands together with the general dislike of the covenant at the Restoration and Revolution are  internal eviden∣ces  that but a part perhaps a small part of the Scots took the covenant"  ANSW I boldly defy you to in∣validate the proofs I have brought to the contrary Nay for ought I know you cannot produce one of these perjured Prelatists that pretended that only the smaller part of the Scotch nation took the covenant especially in Were the Highland chiefs and the gross ignorance of the islan∣ders occasioned by the negligence of the curates a whit more able to withstand the enlightening and heartbowing power of God so remarkably manifest∣ed on these occasions than K Charles and many o∣thers  on the continent Have we not produced evi∣dence that multitudes of the Highlanders entered into the reformers covenant and were not Argyle Mar and many other Highland chiefs zealous cove∣nanters Did not such as were otherwise minded take the covenant of as imposed by the Privy coun∣cil according to its original meaning Did not even the Doctors and Prelatic inhabitants of Aberdeen take that bond without approving the council's limitation of it to its original meaning You can produce no evidence that the covenanting work was not carried on in the Scotch islands but such as we have that ne∣ver a Hebrew child was circumcised on the th day from Isaac to John Baptistor that never a weekly Sabbath was observed from the creation till the manna fell around the Hebrew camp  i e  want of positive evidence to the contraryand that too in places of which to this moment we have little account except what relates to their situation soil product or the like It is highly absurd to pretend that the so general disregard of the covenants twelve or forty years after the last taking of them is  internal evidence  that few had taken them Will it irrefragably prove that Adam was never made after the image of God or taken into covenant with him because within a few days or hours he had become a sinner hating both God and his covenantor that devils were never created holy and happy because within a few days they had left their first estate Will the gene∣ral concurrence of the Hebrews in worshipping the gol∣den calf prove that they had not entered into solemn covenant with God about forty days before Will their subsequent apostasies prove that but few of them had covenanted with God under Joshua Asa Joash Hezekiah Josiah Ezra and Nehemiah Will Peter's fearfully heinous and repeated denial of Christ prove that he had not a few hours before solemnly engaged against it  OBJECT IV  "Force or fear caused many to cove∣nant"  ANSW Though force or sear should have rendered the manner of covenanting unacceptable to God they cannot render void an oath which is sworn I will never contend that the penalty annexed by  law to the refusal of the covenant in or even on some other occasions was proper But after a labo∣rious search I find no proper evidence that any force was ever used in Scotland to make any take the cove∣nant except in by Montrose and Monro two military men without any warrant from either church or statethe former if not both of whom afterward turned out a malignant murderer of his covenanting brethren Never Sir pick up or retail the mere in∣ventions of perjured violators of these covenants who were glad to say any thing to conceal or excuse their own wickedness In when the covenanting was most universal the bishops and some other anti∣covenanters afraid of prosecution for their enormous debts or for their oppressive and other wicked deedsand perhaps chiefly to calumniate the covenanters at court did flee their country But none were obli∣ged to do so for refusing the covenant Fear of dan∣ger probably restrained some from reviling a Bond which the nation so highly esteemed But none that I know of were thereby constrained to swear it Some mobs happened occasioned by the king's suspension of the common exercise of the civil law and the sitting of its courts But these were detested by the zealous covenanters and not one of them appears either to have been intended or to have issued in favours of the covenant If the influences of God's Spirit and the affecting appearances of his Providenceas at Sinai or in the apostolic age awed or allured numbers to take the covenant whose hearts were not sincere before himshould we quarrel with the Almighty on that ac∣countBut Sir Henderson Dickson and Cant who being the principal leaders of the covenanting work that year affirm to the doctors of Aberdeen who were eager to have detected them of falsehood if it had been possible  "No pastors in our knowledge have been either forced to flee or have been threatened with the want of their stipends for refusing their sub∣scription but some have of their own accord gone to court for procuring protection against their credi∣torsand have made lies between the king and his people Others have wilfully refused to abide with their flocks for no reason but because the people  have subscribedArguments have been taken from promised augmentation of stipends to hinder sub∣scription Fear of worldly loss rather hinders men to subscribe than scruples of conscienceThe prelates flight seems rather to have proceeded from inward fu∣ries of accusing consciences  c  In this day of the Lord's power his people have  most willingly offered  themselves in multitudes like the dew of the morning Others of no small note have offered their subscrip∣tions and have been refused till time should try their fincerity from love to the cause and  not from the fear of man  No threatenings have been used except of the deserved judgments of God nor force except the force of reason from the high respects which we owe to religion to our king to our native country to ourselves and to our posterity  Answers to doctors of Aberdeen P  The General Assembly in their act Ses th appear so far from forcing men into their covenant that they earnest∣ly enjoin and appoint the utmost caution to be used for preven∣ting such persons taking of it as did not sincerely approve it and resolve to prosecute the ends of it  "  Since the covenanting work was so remarkably countenanced by the Holy Ghostattended with perhaps more sincere mourning for sinmore serious repentance and solid conversion to God than hath within an equal space of time and place happened any where in the world since the apostolic ageand since the covenanters in their vow deponed that they covenanted  without any world∣ly respect or inducement  as far as human in firmity would allowTake heed Sir lest after your objection hath manifested the carnality selfishness and dissimu∣lation of your own religious appearancesGod at last should publicly expose you as a blasphemer of his great work and a malicious slanderer of his peo∣ple as  wilfully perjured  OBJECT V  "It is impossible our covenanters could understand their bonds particularly in that which relates to Popery in the  notional covenant  or to prelacy in the  solemn league  "  ANSW Ignorance indeed hin∣ders a right and acceptable swearing of oaths or cove∣nants but cannot invalidate their binding force if once they be sworn otherwise millions in Britain would  through ignorance be freed from all their solemn en∣gagements in Baptism and the Lord's supper and thousands freed from all obligation of their oaths of allegiance or fidelity to magistrates or even their oaths to declare the truth and nothing else in witness bearing Candidates for the ministry needed but keep themselves in a great measure ignorant of the doctrines of the Confession of Faith and duties of the ministeri∣al office in order to render their ordination vows or subscriptions  altogether unobligatory  Being trai∣ned up in the abominations of popery or prelacy or having frequent access to witness them our covenan∣ting ancestors who had common sense might have more knowledge of them than most clergymen in Scotland now have even as a common sailor who hath served years in a man of war may have more knowledge of her tackling and other pertinents than all the learned doctors of fix British universities  OBJECT VI  "If nothing be engaged to in these covenants but what God hath declared or required in his word they  never could lay any obligation  upon the covenanters much less a perpetual obligation upon their posterity It is absolutely inconsistent with sound philosophy Christianity or common sense to imagine that any human deed can bind to any thing de∣clared in the word or required by the law of God"  ANSW Then it seems the common Protestant doc∣trine of our Confession of Faith which in your ordi∣nation vows you solemnly declared to be  founded on the word of God  viz  That a man  BINDS HIMSELF  by oath to what is  GOOD  and  JUST that  in  ANY THING  not sinful it  BINDS  to performance  That by a vow we  more strictly  BIND OURSELVES TO NECESSARY DU∣TIES  c  must be grosly erroneous Instruct∣ed by some Papist or some ringleader in the perjuri∣ous violation of these covenants in the last century you have indeed now hit upon a sentiment which if proven would effectually undermine the obligation of our covenants and for ought I know all religionall moralityall mutual trust and order among man∣kind along with it If our promises oaths vows or covenants can have no  binding force  except in things to which the revelation and law of God cannot reach  neither Adam nor Christ as Mediator could bind themselves to fulfil God's law and so there must be no proper no real covenant of works or of grace and so no religion among mankind And for the same reason the promises of God in so far as their matter corresponds to his natural excellencies can have  no binding  force and thus the foundation of our faith and hope is quite overturned All engagements in Baptism or the Lord's Supper to believe what God re∣veals receive what he offers and do what he com∣mands must be absolutely  null and void  destitute of all  binding force  Jesuitical equivocation and mental reservation are no more necessary in the making of promises covenants or vows or in swearing promis∣sory oaths of allegiance fidelity or witness bearing or in subscribing Articles Creeds or Confessions of Faith Calls to ministers Bonds or Bills of service or debtIf the law of God which is exceeding broad can but reach to the matter of them and require the believing maintaining or practising of what is therein engaged that alone renders them  null and void and not binding  to all intents and purposes And so there can be no such a thing as  perjury perfidy  or  breach of promise  except it be with respect to such things as the law of God could not directly or indirect∣ly reachwhich if it be as perfect and exceeding broad as the Bible affirms must certainly be very few and very trislingfor  where there is no law  no binding of a law  there can be no transgression  Mens promi∣ses covenants oaths and vows in word or writ in so far as they respect things to which the law of God can reach must be mere  villainous impositions  seeming  to bind  while they do not in the smallest degree and therefore ought to be detested instead of being requir∣ed made or trustedFor the same reason no com∣mands of parents masters magistrates or any other superiors being  human deeds  can have any  binding force  in any thing relative to religion equity kindness  c  to which the law of God can reach its requirements and hence cannot be  lawfully  OBEYED or their autho∣rity regarded except when they commend what is  ab∣solutely indifferent and trisling  If human engage∣ments and commands can only bind men to that which  is  absolutely indifferent  it is plain that we can only be answerable to men for such parts of our conduct as the law of God did not reachbut let men once firmly believe that their promises covenants oaths or vows and the commands of superiors have  no bin∣ding force  but in that which is left absolutely indiffe∣rent by the law of God and that they are answerable to men only for such parts of their conduct as the law of God could not reachhow naturally they will rush headlong into all manner of profligacy every man doing that which is right in his own eyes in every thing important How absurd to pretend honouring of religion or of the law of God by making it the murderer of that  deputed authority  which God hath by it granted to men or of these covenants oaths or vows which He hath therein appointed as means of his worshipNot only scripture but even common sense dictates that the authority of God in his law cannot be rightlyregarded unless in a way of also regard∣ingthat authority which he hath deputed to men and all the commands or self engagements which proceed from it in due subordination to it If I read my Bible daily in obedience to the command of God as my God in Christin obedience to Christ as appointed by God to be my mediatorial prophet and kingand at the same time in due subordination heretoin obedience to my civil ruler as the minister of God for good to menin obedience to my pastor or church judicature as the messenger of Christ to mein obedience to my parents or masters as God's deputygovernors over meand in fulfilment of the vow which I as God's de∣putygovernor over myself have laid myself under according to his appointment Where is the inconsis∣tency Must I wickedly put asunder the  immediate  and  deputed  authority of God which he hath so closely and delightfully joined together God forbid  OBJECT VII  "What have we to do with our fa∣ther's engagements in religion to which we never gave any personal consent especially after we have become capable to judge and choose for ourselvesnay to do with engagements which I cannot prove my ancestors ever took"  ANSW To rest obligation to pay debt or perform duty on the  debtor's  proving the contraction of it or engagement to it is highly ab∣surd  in itself and opens a wide door for breaking through almost every engagement According to this scheme you may hold your ancestors who lived years ago unbaptized Heathens and perhaps yourself too and so renounce your baptism because you  can∣not prove  that ever you received it If God who is our  creditor  in these covenants can prove our ances∣tors taking of them he will hold us bound by their deed and even though they did not take them he will hold us bound by the deed of the society and its representatives You know that Lord about four hundred years ago granted your ancestor the valuable estate of to be held under him and his heirs for a very small honorary service as an ac∣knowledgment of vassalage and that the celebrated farmer  A B  about six years ago took a ninetynine years lease of one of your farms at a very high rent Have you certified the present heirs of that Lord and Farmer That they are nowise bound by their proge∣nitors deeds unless they have given their own personal consentand that the one may recal your estate and the other may keep your farm and refuse to pay you any rentYou have not nor ever will You al∣low such freedoms only to be used with Godnot with yourselftoo strong a presumption That you more value your estate and rent than all that you hold of God in religion and all the honour you owe to him If our fathers bound us to any thing in religion which is not warranted by the word of God we have nothing to do with it but to bewail their sin in such engagement But if they bound us to what is commanded by the law of God we must stand boundtill we prove from scripture that vows binding to duty are not lawful or that fathers have no right to devote their children to God's service No slothful or wilful ignorance or withholding of personal con∣sent can so much as excuse the nonperformance of such engagements Nothing can free from their  binding force  which would not annual our baptismal vows Once more Sir be pleased to review these public covenants of our fathers in their princi∣pal contents and meaning They were a  solemn acqui∣escence  in and  confirmation  of God's grant of the utmost ends of the earth to his Son Jesus Christ for hs posses∣sion  They implied a  solemn acceptance  of God him∣self in Christ as the God Saviour and portion of the covenanters and their posterity freely granted to them in the gospeland of his oracles and ordinances as the means of familiar fellowship with Hima  resolution  through his grace to retain him and them as their inestimable privilegesand a  solemn engagement  thank∣fully to improve these privileges in an holy obedience to all his commandments to promote his glory and the temporal spiritual and eternal advantage of these covenanters and their seed Now Sir do you so heartily envy our Redeemer his Father's grant of the ends of the earth for his possession Psal ii that you would gladly renounce our ancestors solemn ac∣quiescence in it Do do you so heartily dislike the hav∣ing of a reconciled God in Christ for your and your posterity's God Saviour and portion and his pure o∣racles and ordinances for your privileges that you would fondly renounce a solemn acceptance of God's gracious grant of them sealed and consirmed by the re∣markable influences of his Spirit Do you so under∣value these enjoyments and hate a grateful and selfprofiting obedience to all the commandments of God that you would gladly renounce a solemn obligation to it Or are you offended with the declared ends of these covenants  viz  the glorifying of God the pre∣servation and reformation of religion and promoting the welfare of the nationand that God may delight to dwell among us to the latest posterityYou will perhaps pretend that you love our reformed doctrine worship Presbyterian government and discipline but hate to be bound to them especially by others than yourself But Sir for the same reason you must re∣nounce your baptismal engagements and state your quarrel with God himself who hath appointed vows as his ordinance for hedging up men to their duty and who hath entered into covenants with parents for their posterity as well as for themselves Moreover it is scarce credible that you can love every thing engaged to in a vow and yet hate to be bound by it after God hath signally countenanced it It is scarce possible that my wife can dearly love her husband and the or∣der and enjoyments of my family if she hate and wish to renounce her marriage Vow  FINIS  BOOKS Sold by JOHN
