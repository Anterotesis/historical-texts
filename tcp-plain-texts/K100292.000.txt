AMELIA  WHEN Addresses of this Sort are made to Persons of your Royal Highness's elevated State it is I believe usual previously to supplicate Leave for their ReceptionBut here I presume it would have been as equally needless for the author to have implored your royal highness's name for protectress in the Cause of Virtue as it would be for the Master of the Mint to petition in Form your royal Father for Leave to stamp his Name on our coin to give Sanction to its Currency  The Inducements Madam to throw this Piece therefore under your royal highness's protection were solely from considering it as an act of duty added to the Pride of having the high honour to subscribe myself  May it please Your Royal Highness  Your Highness's most obedient Most devoted humble Servant The Author  PROLOGUE  Spoken by a Gentleman  AS in the airy Regions of Romance  Th' adventrous Knight sets out with Shield and Lance  Strait his disinterested Valour flies  To helpless Damsels and to Beauty's Cries  This only Motive rising in his Breast  The Godlike Pleaof Innocence distress'd  Thus dares our AuthorErrant of ToNight  In Virtue's Aid romantically fight  Sacred to Her the Champion Pen he draws  Enough rewardedto support her Cause  ToNight his honest Labour means to prove  A lowborn Virtue worth a great Man's Love  An honest Pride where conscious Honour glows  An artless Innocencewhence Truth still flows  A Sense proceeding but from Nature's Light  For little Knowledge serves us to be right  A Merit greatly poor that far outshines  The Glare of Titles or the Wealth of Mines  Such stedfast Honesty should find Success  O'er the abandon'd Authors of Distress  O'er those who glory to betray a Maid  Who welcome Guilt and make Deceit a Trade  Yet some there are less liable to blame  Who only want Reflection to reclaim  Who bend unthinking to the Syren's Voice  The Reprobates of Custom not of Choice  Who deaf to Precept plead Example still  And think the Mode indemnifies the Ill  To such our Author offers this Address  Not certain nor despairing of Success  Amongst this Cast of Men he hopes to find  Some Convertsfor the Honour of Mankind  On Minds like these his Morals may prevail

Isaac  MERCY on us why this House is going to be turn'd topsyturvy to be sure  Harry  Why did not I tell thee some strange Combustion would happen from my Dream  Isaac  Nay to be sure Dreams Dreams are great Prognosticators  Harry  PrognosticatorsAy marry be they they never fair'd me yet  Benj  Nor mefor ye all know the very next Day after I dream'd I fell into the Horsepond and  Arthur  here took me out half drown'd and brought me to the Kitchen Fire and methought being mortal weak I fell out of the Chair and was scorch'd most fearfully and to be sure the next Dayaythe very next Daywas I taken with the Ague and Fever  Arth  Why my Book of Dreams gives 'mazing Accounts  of Robbers being taken and Murders brought to light seven Years after they were done  Isaac  To be sureto be sureBut prithee  Harry  tell us thy Dream  Benj  Arth  Ay let's hear it let's hear it  Harry  Why last Marketday I came home as 'twere a little tipsy and laid me down i'th' Stable on a Truss of Straw and fell fast asleep and there what should I dream but that our House was turn'd into a Windmill  All  Merciful Sirs  Harry  Ay a Windmilland that Mrs  Jewkes  Master's  Lincolnshire  House keeper was the Miller's Man and we four to be sure turn'd into Assesandmurrain take hernothing would serve her turn but she would have us to draw in place o'th' Horsesbut methought we were plaguy restyfor to be sure never was the like heard of and jirk us about she did most cruelly  Isaac  Ay they say she's a mortal cross WomanWell well but so  Harry  So methought at a little Distance from the Mill was good Mrs  Jervis  our Housekeeper here and pretty Mrs  Pamela  my late Lady's waiting Woman with each a Bundle under their Arms as if so be they were going to seek their FortunesAnd is not all this now plainly made outis not the whole House in a Quandary and a terrible Uproar Is not the 'Squire as it were turn'd to another sort of a Man and mainly alter'd for the worse And are not Mrs  Jervis  and Mrs  Pamela  discharged out of their Service and ordered to gather up their Things and provide themselves  Isaac  Ay and does not Master  Longman  the Steward say the 'Squire talks of sending for that same Mrs  Jewkes  Benj  Ay and then comes our Share of this woeful Dream  Harry  Well but my Lads I have some sweet  bitter tooI overheard Master  Longman  tell Mrs  Jervis  the 'Squire was looking out for a Wife and that will be a rare Time for Vails for to be sure we shall have more Comers and Goers than a Beehive in a Summer's Day  Arth  Ay marry those wou'd be joyful Times indeed and I wish with all my Heart the poor dear Souls Mrs  Jervis  and Mrs  Pamela  were to stay and take part  Benj  What a murrain makes the 'Squire in such a Fluster with them tho'  Harry  Why you must know Mrs  Pamela  they say has been a little too bold and given Master untoward Answers and you know he's deadly haughty and passionate but poor Soul I wonder how it should chance so for to be sure I never heard her give any living Soul in the House a wry Word  Isaac  Nor Ishe's as gentle as a Lamb  Benj  No more Gall than a Pidgeon  Harry  Why so Mrs  Jervis  told Master and talk'd a little roundly they say which made his Honour in such a desperate Passion that he ordered her to provide tooOdsheart that same  Pamela  's a dainty Girlbut deadly shy I don't think a Servant in the House durst ever give her so much as a civil Salute  Isaac  Well well no matter for that she's a precious goodnatur'd SoulOdso here's the Steward and Mrs  Jervis  she's giving up her Chargeand 'twon't become us to be seen loitering here  Omnes  Away away  Exeunt  SCENE II  Enter Mr LONGMRN and Mrs JERVIS  Mrs  Jerv  I hope Mr  Longman  you find every Thing properly and justly accounted for  Mr  Long  So justly good Mrs  Jervis  that I am under great Concern to find my Master's Warmth of Temper so little consistent with his Interest to discharge a Person from his Family who has many Years with  such Prudence and Justice so well acquitted her Trust  Mrs  Jerv  Your Approbation of my Conduct Mr  Longman  next to that of our Master's is its best Justification  Mr  Long  You have more than that good Mrs  Jervis  the Approbation and good Wishes of the whole Family which seldom go hand in hand with a Frugality like yours for the good Opinion of the lower Servants in a Family is rarely obtain'd but by Indulgencies hurtful to the Interest of its MasterAnd I cou'd wish you'd give me Leave for the Advantage and Pleasure of our's to solicit Mr  Belvile  for your Continuance  Mrs  Jerv  Why Mr  Longman  there are many prevailing Reasons to accept with Pleasure your kind offerAnd what I am apt to think may induce his Honour not to reject it is the Removal of the dear unhappy tho' innocent Occasion of his Resentment to me  Mr  Long  The lovely  Pamela  you mean Oh Mrs  Jervis  there is I fear another Motive which your Discretion and Regard to my Master's Honour has concealed that renders his Resentment as you call it inexcusable to both  Mrs  Jerv  But his complying with the good Girl's earnest Request to be sent home to her Father and Mother is I think a sufficient Proof of his Resolution no longer to entertain such Thoughts that might as you but too justly suspect prove hurtful to dear  Pamela  's Virtue and his own Honour  Mr  Long  'Tis trueand I am heartily rejoiced to find the Temptation will be remov'd from both for 'twou'd be a hard Task Mrs  Jervis  for poor  Pamela  strong as she is in Virtue to withstand the artful insinuating Snares of a handsome wealthy Man like our Master and I fear a much harder for him to overcome his too warm Desire for so tempting an Object were they to have constant Opportunities of seeing each other  Mrs  Jerv  I shou'd have few Fears of her Side were I certain he would employ no other Power than Persuasion  Mr  Long  Why I think the young Creature's almost unequall'd by any of her tender Years in the Principles of Piety and VirtueAnd it warms my very Heart that one so young should so earnestly prefer sharing the Poverty of her good Parents with the Preservation of her Honesty to all the enticing Baits of Finery and Grandeur with the Loss of itbut however 'tis better as it isBut it is now pretty near the Time his Honour order'd me to attend him in his Closet with your Accounts and then I'll make bold to tell him my Opinion in relation to you Mrs  Jervis  a good Day to you  Mrs  Jerv  And to you worthy Mr  Longman  Exeunt  SCENE III  BELVILE alone  How weakly founded is the Opinion that Happiness is seated in large Possessions tho' till lately I have had but little Reason to dissent from that Opinion and have ever made my Fortune subservient to my Pleasuresand shall I now suffer a peevish low born Girl to interrupt their Course and with the musty Principles of Virtue preach me from my PurposeNo I am determin'd not to sacrifice my Pursuits of Pleasure and substantial Joy to her wild imaginary Notions of Virtue and Honour'Tis certainly the first Time they ever took such deep Root in a Cottage and I'll yet try if I have not Force enough to destroy these wondrous rural Battlements and reduce the romantic Governor to capitulate  SCENE IV  BELVILE and LONGMAN  Belv  Well Mr  Longman  have you look'd over this insolent Housekeeper's Accounts  Long  Yes Sir and find them in every Article just to a Tittleand I hope Sir you'll not be offended if  I presume to say I fear 'twill be difficult for your Honour to meet with a Servant with less Insolence and so much Fidelity  Belv  Why thou imaginest the chief Merit of Servants consists in their Honesty  Long  I confess Sir I think it is so in all Mankind  Belv  'Tis a Sign thou hast convers'd but little with the gay WorldAmongst them the strongest Cement of Regard is the mutual Indulgence of each others Pleasuresand Morals make up no Part of their Friendshipsbut in Servants 'tis an absolute Duty to conform to their Master's Foibles and shew an implicit Obedience to all his Commands  Long  May I take the Liberty Sir of giving my Opinion on this Head tho' it differs from your's  Belv  Ay freely  Long  Why then Sir were it possible and I think it hardly so that your Honour should impose any Commands on me which my little Portion of Reason informed me would prove prejudicial to your Morals Character and Reputation I should think myself as much bound in Duty to  reject  such Commands and use my weak Endeavours to convince you of their Consequence as I have thought myself bound to  obey  you in all you have hitherto been pleas'd to honour me with  Belv  Sure this old Fellow has no Suspicion of my Attempts on  Pamela  aside  But Mr  Longman  do you think me capable of imposing any Commands on Mrs  Jervis  that might prove pernicious to my Honour  Long  Pardon me good SirYou were pleased to mention an implicit Duty necessary in Servants and that drew from me my Opinion  Belv  Perhaps I mightbut as the Sentiments of others not my ownand I am so well convinced of Mrs  Jervis  's Regard both to my Honour and Interest that now Passion has subsided were she to make a Concession I would restore her  Long  Sir she makes the humblest and by me intreats your Goodness to replace her  Belv  Did she employ you for that Purpose  Long  She did Sir and I hope not in vain  Belv  Well she may continuebut I'll be sworn you have no such Commission from that obstinate Baggage  Pamela  Long  No Sirthe poor young Creature is so much transported with the Thoughts of returning and paying her Duty to her good Parents she seems little employed about any other Concern yet often expresses the most grateful Acknowledgments for the bountiful Favours bestowed on her by you Sir and my good Lady your Mother  Belv  You mistake her  Longman  she's quite insensible to all Gratitude and looks upon 'em merely as due to her great Merit  Long  Merit Sir With Submission I have always observ'd in her the greatest Meekness and Humility and that's the Character the whole Family gives her  Belv  Ay she's a very Idol with you allbut no more of herOrder  Robin  my  Lincolnshire  Coachman to attend me an Hour hence  Long  I shall Sir  Exit  SCENE V  BELVILE alone  I find in spite of all my Pride and Resolution this little Gipsey is still fluttering round my Hearthave her I mustyet I see but slender Hopes of a Complianceand Force is base and brutalnor would I give Sixpence for her Person without her InclinationAh I am far gone that's plainheretofore Minds had no Share in my Amours'Sdeath I shall turn an errant whining CoxcombWelland perhaps that may sooner bring Madam about than the haughty commanding Airs I have given myselffor she has a gentle Softness about her  That Pride will sooner startle than engage  The soothing Trap's the surest at her Age  Exit  SCENE VI  JOHN ARNOLD booted with a Letter  I'th' Name of ill Luck how came the 'Squire to pick me out for this untowardly JobA murrain on't to be sure he read in my face I was falseheartedtho'f I can't call to mind any foul playsave thisI ever did to the poorest mortal breathingand thismore out of Fear than any ill will towards the Partiesfor to be sure they ne'er deserv'd it at my Handsfor to say Truth there is not a better wellnatured young Body in this County or the next than Mrs  Pamela  and 'twou'd melt a Heart of Stone to see the good old Folks her Parents take on about herand good notable Folk they are Adod the old Man wou'd ha' made a special Parson Well to be sure if any of 'em should do otherwise than well for want of these plaguy Letters his Honour has ta'en from me I shall never be able to sleep in a Room by myselfHey day why what a dickens be all the wenches got together for I trowI'll step aside and hearken  Retires  SCENE VII  RACHEL JANE HANNAH CICELY and JOHN ARNOLD  Rach  Well to be sure this is joyful News  Jane  By my troth the best News we've had t'Year  Han  I should not be more overjoy'd at a new Sweetheart  Cicely  Sweetheart I fakins I don't think I should have been half so merry had I been married  Rach  May I never be married if I believe thee  Jane  Han  Nor I  Rach  For certain Mrs  Jervis  is a mighty good sort of a woman and we are all overjoy'd she stays but  there's no manner of Comparison between a Man and a Woman  Jane  Han  None at all none at all  John  I cant make out what they are in this taking for  comes forward  How now my Lasses what's all this Merriment about  Cicely  To be sure he has not heard it  Jane  Why where hast thou been mopingnot to hear the happiest Tidings that e'er came to Hall  John  What Tidings  All  Why Mrs  Jewkes    John  Is dead I hope  All  No no no no  John  One at a time good Lasses one at a time  Cicely  Why then Mrs  Jewkes  who put us all in such a dismal Pucker about his Honour's sending for her thither is to stay where she is and Mrs  Jervis  holds her own and keeps her place  John  Why marry these are joyful Tidings indeed for that same Mrs  Jewkes  would have made fearful workfor my part I'd have look'd out for a new Service  All  And I  Cicely  Now if Mrs  Pamela  were but to stay too we shou'd be as happy as the Day's long  Jane  Ah she'll ne'er bring her proud Heart down to ask  Han  Why I wonder  Jane  how it shou'd fall out so but the poor young Body never had half so good a Word from thee as from all the rest of her Fellow Servants  John  Why because she's envious and can't endure to hear all the Servants praise the young Woman her Goodnature and her featly Person  Jane  Perhaps there are people who may think others as fearly as she  Cicely  And if there were poor soul I'll be sworn she'd bear 'em no malice  Han  Ay but you know  Jane  has a sneaking kindness for our  Harry  and ever since he praised Mrs  Pamela  so hugely one night in the kitchen  Jane  cou'd ne'er endure the sight of her  Jane  Who told you forsooth I had a sneaking kindness for  Harry  Han  Why the Fortuneteller told us all so for she describ'd  Harry  to a hair and you redden'd up to the Eyes and was as shameface'd as if she had told you you were breeding  All  Ha ha ha ha  Jane  The Father why you're all full of your jeers and may hap I could jeer upon others if I was minded to't  Han  Say your worst of me I put you to the defiance  All  And I  John  Come come Lasses ne'er wrangle who has a mind to fall too firstI'll pass my word none of you design to lead Apes in Hell as they sayCome let's go and take part of the Bowl Master  Jonathan  the Butler has prepared for us all to drink a good journey to Mrs  Pamela  and her wellbeing with her Father and Mother  And then we'll drink that every Lad and Lass  Be ask'd i' th' Church before the Summer pass  Exeunt  End of the First Act  ACT II SCENE I  PAMELA discovered at a Table folding up a Letter  WELL my dear Father and Mother thank Heaven this will be the last Scrowl you'll be troubled with from your poor  Pamela  and I have no Fears about me but that I shall return to you innocent as your Wishes and my ownTho' Heaven has  been pleased to put me upon the severest Trials for its preservationbut let me not repine No my heart should rather overflow with thankfulness at my happy blest deliverance and my Master's Resolution in permitting me to return to my dear Parents with that Blessing which will cheer their honest Minds and make 'em shed Tears of Joy and Gladness over their innocent Child tho' almost beat down with poverty and old Age  Wiping her Eyes  SCENE II  Enter Mrs JERVIS  Jerv  What still disconsolate my dear  Pamela  I thought thy Heart had now been easy and thou hadst done with Tears  Pam  With all that gave me pain I hope I have but these Mrs  Jervis  fall from a quite different cause the reflecting on the comfortable Joy I shall both give and receive in meeting my good old Parents  Jerv  Well thou art a miracle of innocence and duty I shall never be able to bear the House when thou art gone'twill break my Heartbut let me hear from thee my dearest  Pamela  and don't forget me  Pam  Dear Mrs  Jervis  I should have little Title to that Goodness and merit you have often praised in me cou'd I be capable of forgetting that tender and even motherly affection you have always shewn me and be assured next the Love and Duty I owe my dear Parents you have the largest share in the heart of poor  Pamela  who can only testify her Gratitude by Words  Jerv  Dearest Child I want no other Proofs but my good Girl why dost thou keep on these Cloaths still are you resolved to go in them  Pam  Ay no doubtthey are the properest these I can wear without reproach from my poor neighbours or to myself at the Fruit of innocence alone and honest industry  Jerv  Why so you may many others my good old Lady gave you  Pam  No they'll all appear too fine and flaunting for my humble Station nor when they are gone can the circumstances of my poor Parents afford me any like 'em  Jerv  Thou art a dear prudent SoulWell  Pamela  his honour has ordered the TravellingChariot to carry you and  Lincolnshire Robin  to drive but he directed me to tell you he must see you before you go and that he has something particular to advise you about  Pam  What am I to undergo more persecution I hoped he wou'd have suffered me to depart with that Ease and Quietness of mind into which I had composed myself  Jerv  Don't be alarm'd my Dearhe seems quite changed and reflected with great concern upon the injuries he had offered you and I verily think you might even venture to stay which with a very serious grave Look he ordered me to tell you you might if you thought fit without the least apprehensions of his renewing his Attempts upon you  Pam  That may be trueand for his Sake I hope it is but staying I am sure would be a strong Inducement to the renewing his Attempts since that would give him sufficient Reason to conclude my resenting his Treatment was what I have heard it called the little Artifice and Cunning of my Sexand not a determined Resolution to preserve my Innocence  Jerv  Well thou art best able to distinguish and I'll not pretend to give my Advice where there's such Prudence and Understandingbut I think however 'twill be right to see him since he has requested it in such a manner  Pam  Wou'd he had not requested it for notwithstanding this Alteration of Behaviour you describe my Apprehensions of seeing him bring back to my Remembrance all his pernicious Plots and barbarous Usage of meand yet if I refuse it he'll reproach  me with Insolence and Ingratitude and a Multitude of Crimes my poor Heart's a Stranger to  Jerv  Come Come my dear  Pamela  be comforted I am certain you may see him safely and that his Repentance is sincere  Pam  Heav'n grant it may  But still my Heart is torn with anxious Pain  And doubts his Power his Virtue to maintain  Exeunt  SCENE III  BELVILE alone  If I can't prevail upon this little Baggage to stay I shall have a rare ringing Lecture from my outrageous Sister she'll conclude I have stormed the Fort and not finding the Plunder answer my Expectation have just carried off what I thought most valuable and left the commanding Officer to dispose of what remains in the best Manner she canBut 'tis a Question faith whether the Lady will think fit to do me the Honour of an Interviewand to confess the Truth I have given her pretty substantial Reasons to be alarmedO here comes Mademoiselle  la Governante  Enter Mrs JERVIS  Well Mrs  Jervis  did you let Mrs  Pamela  know I desired to see her before she went  Jerv  Yes Sir and she attends without to wait your Commands  Belv  Bid her come inStayI'll go myself  Exit  Jerv  Wou'd to Heav'n the poor Creature were safe at Home  Exit  SCENE IV  BELVILE aad PAMELA  Belv  Prithee dear  Pamela  what needs all this Ceremony now You should no longer look upon yourself in the Character of a Servant  Pam  It would be the highest Presumption Sir to consider myself in any other Character and the Remembrance of it will always fill me with the most grateful pleasing Thoughts  Belv  If the bare Recollection can furnish such pleasing Ideas I should conclude the Continuance of the Possession might be more desireableand that  Pamela  wholly depends upon your own Choice  Pam  Persons in my humble State of Life Sir ought very seldom if at all to govern their Actions by their Choice nay sometimes even those of high Condition are apt to make very fatal Mistakes by a too blind Obedience to their Choice in the Pursuit of what they call Pleasures  Belv  Ha well said my little RemembrancerI assure you canted forth with great SolemnityEgad I fancy the good old Lady my Mother mistook both thy Sex and Genius and instead of teaching thee to raise Paste and make Cordials thou shouldst have been instructed in administring spiritual Comfortsand a smart pretty  Levite  thou hadst been S'death you Baggage what Havock you'd have made among the Maids  Pam  Mrs  Jervis  informed me Sir you had something to say to me of a more serious Sort  Belv  Why you little wicked Slut can any thing be more serious than turning Parson but I have something very serious to say to thee 'tis upon Matrimony and if that is not a serious Subject I am at a Loss to furnish one In short  Pamela  I have been thinking to make thee some Amends for all the Rogues Tricks I have play'd thee by getting thee a good Husband I have a Chaplain in  Lincolnshire  I have promised to provide for one  Williams  he's a likely young Fellow if you'll stay I'll send for him directly the Parson has Taste and I'm sure must be struck with all this Youth and Beauty  kisses her  S'death I could almost marry thee myself  Pam  Sir I beg you'll give me Leave to withdraw  Bel  You shan't stir by Heaven  Pam  Then I must take the Liberty to insist Sir upon a different Behaviour  Bel  Well well it shall have its own Humour but what say you to this Parson Child  Pam  I say Sir I think the Subject in general of too solemn a kind to be treated of in the light manner you are pleased to express yourself and as to my particular Thoughts of itI have never yet entertain'd any nor could I suppose you serious in what you say have I a right to entertain such Thoughts without first receiving the Approbation of those who have an undoubted Power over my Mind and Person  Belv  Well I'll immediately send Word to your Father of my Intention and if he concurs desire him to come hither directly  Pam  Sir in an Act of such Importance 'tis certainly my Duty first to make a personal Application and 'twill be necessary I should myself have some longer Time to reflect upon an Act on which the future Happiness or Misery of my Life depends therefore Sir I hope I have Leave to pursue my Resolution of returning home  Belv  Well Madam since my Friendship meets with so ungrateful a Reception you are at Liberty to pursue what Resolutions you please  Pam  I humbly thank you Sir but let me intreat you not to think so hardly of the unhappy  Pamela  low as she is to interpret that ungrateful which was the Effect of Duty and a Desire to enjoy that Liberty which even Slaves are allow'd on such Occasions  Bel  Come come Insolent I see plainly under all this Mask of Duty there lurks a base arrogant Suspicion of my Sincerity in the Proposalbut be assured  Enter HARRY  Har  Lady  Davers  Sir is just alighted  Belv  I'll wait upon her  Exit  Harry  The Chariot Madam is ready to wait upon you when you please  Pam  My humblest Acknowledgments Sir for this and every other bounteous Favour I have received I have no Power to express but by these silent Witnesses of their Sincerity and Truth  Exit weeping  Belv  Certainly Art and Nature were never so agreeably blended as in this Creature every Moment I find myself more deeply affected by her and the oftner I turn am but the farther entangled in this Labyrinth'Slife I had forgot my SisterO here she comes and if I'm not mistaken in a Disposition to refresh my Memory a little  Enter Lady DAVEZS and SMATTER  L Da  I am extremely sorry Sir my impertinent Visit has broke in upon your more agreeable Amusements and a Conversation so polite as that of your Servants must necessarily affordbut I only just step'd up to convince you  Bel  That you are in a violent Warmth without one Jot of Reason prithee dear Child endeavour to subdue these boisterous Passions and recollect the Advice I have often given you Ever to distinguish between the easy dispassionate Behaviour proper for a Woman of Quality and the clamorous turbulent Outrages of the Ladies who have received their Education about  CoventGarden  Smatt  I gad that's a Stinger Ha ha ha  Aside  L  Da  By the Company that just now left you Sir and the extraordinary Delicacy in expressing yourself one might reasonably conclude truly the Creatures you mention had engrossed the largest Share of your Conversation  Belv  Why ay Child you know one can't avoid giving great Part of one's Time to so near a Relation as a Sister Ha ha ha  L  Dav  Sir  Belv  Nay nay my dear Lady  Davers  you must be laugh'd out of these ridiculous Flights  Smat  Why upon my Soul Sir  Belv  Sir pray excuse me upon my Word I did not see you  Smat  Why 'faith Sir I did imagine the lively Brilliancy of my Lady's Fire had as it were struck upon the visionary Nerves and obscured me from Observation  L  Dav  Insolent Coxcomb dar'st thou to affront me with thy saucy Raillery  Smat  Let me perish Madam but 'tis extremely severe to construe the Effects of Wit and Genius into an Affront  Belv  Upon my Word my dear this Resentment is most unreasonably founded  Pamela  who is returning to her Father just before your Coach stop'd was come to pay her Compliment of Leave and I was only just giving her a short Lesson of Instruction for her future Conduct and  L  Dav  Yes yes I make no doubt she has received very notable Lessons of Instruction which will shortly produce speaking Instances of her Tutor's Care  Belv  Upon my Honour you injure both the Girl and me I think her sincerely virtuous and possessed of every other Quality that should compose the amiable and good and more particularly so in her high Sense of Duty to her Parents which so remarkably appears in giving up her advantageous Situation in my Family to return to their Comfort and Assistance who it seems are in a very advanced and declining Age  Nay I promise you I have a much better Opinion of the Girl than you and if she has preserved her Innocence 'tis wholly owing to her Conduct and Prudence  Belv  Well I'll not dispute the Point with you what think you of a turn in the Garden before Tea  L  Da  No I chuse to see the Girl before she goesPray order somebody to send her to me  Bel  With all my HeartSir do you choose walking  Smat  By all means Sir I wait upon you with infinite Pleasure  Extt Bel and Smat  L  Da  Notwithstanding this seeming Indifference I am convinced there must be some very particular Reasons for this Girl's leaving the Family more than he cares I should be acquainted with my Authority over her may perhaps influence her to give me some farther Light into this Affair  Enter PAMELA  Pam  Has your Ladyship any Commands for me  L  Da  Ay Child my Brother tells me you are leaving the Family I am concerned at the Occasion  Pam  'Tis an Occasion Madam that to me affords a double Motive for Concern the leaving a Family where I have rather been indulged like Child than treated as a Servant and the unhappy melancholy Cause that renders my leaving it unavoidable  L Da  Why ay I'm afraid 'tis an unhappy melancholy Cause indeedBut Child is it not rather of the latest to reflect upon that now  Pam  The latest Heav'n forbid  L Da  Invoking Heav'n is presumptious while we are apparently under its Resentment  Pam  Surely Madam 'tis no Presumption in a Child to supplicate Heav'n in the Defence of its afflicted Parents  L Da  Ha she has her Lesson thoroughly perfect why that's mighty pretty truly but Child those little Arts won't do with me I see thro' 'em  Pam  I am sorry Madam you think me fall'n so deep in Wickedness to effect a Sorrow where the strongest Ties of Duty and Religion enforce the tenderest and most sincere  L Da  You wou'd then really persuade me that you have no other Motive for leaving this Family but Duty to your Parents forsooth  Pam  Your Ladyship must think me guilty of the highest Ingratitude and Folly to be induced to leave it from any Reasons that arise from Want of Countenance or Indulgence  L Da  No noI'm only afraid you've had too much Countenance and Indulgence  Pam  I hope Madam that has not appear'd in any Part of my Behaviour  L Da  Then plainlyI imagine my Brother and you  Pam  Madam I must humbly take the Liberty to interrupt your Ladyship and prevent a Charge which nothing but the Guilt of cou'd so sensibly shock me as the bare Suspicionand I hope my Innocence will plead for my Presumption  Enter HARRY  Harry  Mrs  Pamela  Mrs  Jervis  order'd me to let you know the Chariot is ready  L Da  Indeed  Exit Harry  Pam  Madam I humbly take my Leave  L Da  Well  Pamela  I hope my Suspicions are without Foundation and that you deserve my best Wishes for your Welfare which you may always depend upon while you maintain your Character of Innocence  Pam  Madam your Ladyship's most obedient Servant  Exit  Lady DAVERS alone  The ChariotThis particular Mark of Favour is not without its particular Motives I am convinc'd and yet in the Girl's Behaviour there really appear'd no signs of GuiltHowever I am determin'd to make a strict Enquiry after her Ladyship's Conduct at her Father's and what Rambles and Jaunts my good Brother takesThey shall manage their Affairs cunningly indeed if they disguise them from my KnowledgeAnd if they do carry on any secret  CorrespondenceI'll take care it shan't long continue so I warrant me  Exit  Enter SMATTER  Ha ha ha Yonder's poor  Belvile  dying for Love of his own Maid and can't subdue her harden'd Heart Ha ha haWhat weak trifling Mortals some Men of Fortune areIf this Abigail is really coy she has certainly seen some more desireable ObjectA Girl with a Country Education may have Taste
