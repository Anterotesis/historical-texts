leave the Nets a little and see that the Fish is sorted as I directed you    To the Girls    Dear me I've a great deal of Business to mind but no Matter for that And now my Child I want to talk to theeBless the Heart on thee don't be dismayed my Goodman has promised to let thee know the Moment he hears any Tidings of thy Father he likes thee welland for that Matter so do I too but no Matter for that  Pol  I am pleased to hear you say so and Lassure you  Cur  I know what you was going to say but there's no Occasion for your telling me that you'll do every Thing you can to deserve it I say it again I love thee but 'tis no Matter for thatAnd 'tis not every young Girl would come so far after her Father no not if he was twenty Times over sold for a Slave  Pol  Ah me If I could but find where he is I should then be easy but if I never find him I shall always  Curt  I know what you was going to say that you'd always remember our Civility  Pol  I was indeed  Curt  Look ye there now I said so we understand one another very well And now tell me what was that I cunningly drew from you as we were walking last Night by the River's SideSee how she blushesDon't be asham'd Childthe  more ready you was to part with your Lover the more Duty you shewed for your Father  Pol  Why surely I did not tell you any Thing that  Curt  I know what you was going to say that you did not as one may say tell me directly who he is Why Child I confess that but I was once fifteen myself and I remember very well I was just such a sweet little tender delicate Morsel as you are nowI warrant thou hast made a prudent Choice  Pol  My Father thought so for he consented that we should be married upon my Lover's return from Sea  Curt  Is he a Sailor I said you had made a prudent Choice my Husband has been a Sailor and Heaven knows we should now have been comfortably settled in  England  with the little we had got by the Sea if upon our Voyage we had not been taken by those wicked  Algerines  We were made Slaves to the Great Bashaw  Abdallah  and my Husband worked in the Gardens while I attended the Ladies of the Seraglio But we were so kindly used that at last we plucked up Heart of Grace and told the Bashaw all our Misfortunes What do you think he did He gave us our Liberty set us up in this Business and ever since we have served the whole Seraglio with FishBut if I stand idling here I shall he scolded by my old ManAh you smile at thatAnd well you mayHe scold mePoor Soul  Pol  Indeed you seem very happy  Curt  Why as he often says People are never unhappy but it is in some Measure their own FaultsLet me see'Tis forty Summers since we first came together and in all that Time we  have seen nothing but smiling Days 'Tis true when we first fettled the Indians came down upon us and plundered us of all we had and from the Fright and one Thing or other I had like to have died of a Fever and once when he was at Sea he was very near being swallowed up by a Shark we were afterwards shipwrecked then sold for Slaves after that we were confined in a close Dungeon and every Body said we should certainly be strangled But no Matter for that we had no bad Actions to tax ourselves with and we were determined not to be frightened at any Thing    Exit into the Cottage  Enter  Goodwill  to  Polly  Good  Ha My little Charge I have charming News for you  Pol  Oh dear have you heard any Thing of my Father  Good  Yes I have seen him myself  Pol  I wish I had seen him tooPray where is he  Good  Oh he's a very fortunate Man what would many a one give for such a SituationI would rather be as he is than Overseer to a Cadi  Pol  Is not he a Slave then  Good  O yes he's a Slave  Pol  Dear dear  Good  But to such a MasterWhy do you know that he has the Honour to work in the Garden of the Seraglio of  Abdallah  the Great Bashaw  Pol  Dame  Curtis  has been telling me what a good Man the Bashaw is But yet I wish my Father was not a Slave to any body  Good  Oh that Bashaw will never give over doing good Things What do you think I heard just now  Pol  Nay I don't know  Good  Why  Hali Hassan  told me that an  English  Lady was made a Slave yesterday and the first Thing he did upon her coming to the Seraglio was to let her choose her own Apartments nay 'tis actually said if she behaves well she'll be suffered to have her own Servants to wait upon her  Pol  But what of my Father  Good  I could not stay with him long for I was ordered into the Bashaw's Presence but I did not forget to tell him that I had great Interest and bid him hope for better Days  Pol  Bless you for it  Good  Yes but when I told him so he smiled and said he believed his good Days were over However I am going again by and by with some Fish and then we shall see what's to be done  Pol  If you are going again will you take a Letter for meOh dear I am so happy  Good  Why you seem pleas'd  Pol  I am indeed pleas'd  Good  With the Thoughts of writing to your Father I suppose Thou art a good Girl  Pol  No 'tis to the Bashaw I shall write  Good  To the Bashaw Why Child do you know how to address such a great Man as him  Pol  I know but little yet I think if I was to write I should prevail on him to give my Father Liberty  Good  Then I'm sure I'll not be your Hindrance But take Care what you are about His Title begins Most high and most illustrious and in the  Letter you must tell him two or three Times that he's a Serpent in Wisdom and a Phoenix in Goodness  Pol  Alas I am a Stranger to these Things  AIR  I have not the Grace and I know not the Art  In fine Words my poor Mind to array  But express ev'ry Thought as it flows from my Heart  And as Nature shall point out the Way  Yet yet will I write and am sure to prevail  While to save my poor Father I try  In the Language of Nature I'll dress a plain Tale  And Duty the rest shall supply  Good  Well well go and get your Letter ready I must see after the Men  Fishermen    At a Distance    Yo yea  Good  Ahoy Lads I'll among you    Exeunt  Goodwill  and  Polly  SCENE  A Street  Enter  Frederick Venture Reef Gunnell  and other Sailors Afterwards  Polly  Fred    Coming on    My brave Fellows you have bound me to you for ever but follow my Fortunes no longer No my Pursuit is at an End my Lydia's in Slavery and I cannot expect that you should stay to witness the mad Excesses of a doating Lover who is determined to rescue her or fall in the Attempt  Reef  And so Master Frederick you think that like a Parcel of Pirates we are to take Possession of the Ship and leave you ashore in an Enemy's Country As I take it that's the Bearing of the Thing  Fred  Come come I know your Kindness but  Venture  here will be all the Assistance I shall want  Vent  And little enough too I believeBut Sir if you'll give me leaveif you should redeem this Lady from Captivity unless they stay how will you get a Vessel to transport us from hence  Fred  Oh I know enough of Turky to manage that however stand off to the other Shore for two Days and if in the Course of that Time I have any Success you shall hear from me if not I beg you will make what Expedition you can to our Friends in  England  Farewel then my Lads and may we meet in more prosperous Times  Reef  and the Sailors retire to a Corner of the Stage  AIR  Here each Morn and ev'ry Eve  In dewy Ray returning  Shall share the Sorrows that I breathe  Shall witness to my Mourning  Echo catch the plaintive Lay  To her Heart discover  How for her forlorn I stray  How well how true I love her  If forbidden to renew  The Vows which once we plighted  My Lydia's Fate I will pursue  In Death at least united  The latest Breath that warms this Clay  At parting shall discover  How I sigh my Soul away  How well how true I love her    Exeunt  Frederick  and  Venture  Reef    After a Pause    Hark'ee  Jack Gunnel  Gun  What dost say my Hearty  Reef  An't my Name  Tom Reef  Gun  Why you may as well ask me which is the Hatchway  Reef  Well and an't I Master and Commander of the  Lovely Betty  Gun  To be sure you are  Reef  And an't I beholden for every Bit of spun Yarn about her to this young Man and his noble Father  Gun  Ay ay you tell us often enough of that you are too good a Seaman to forget who gave you your Prefarment  Reef  And now tell me Have I ever in all my Command kept a wrong Reckoning tack'd about when I should have bore away or done any Thing that could make you take a Notion aboard your Head that I did not know every Rope in the Ship and how to steer her in all Weathers  Gun  Never Master  Reef  Why  Gunnel  you lie for 'tis impossible if I had not some how or other behaved in an unseamanlike Way that my Master  Frederick  could have set me adrift in such a Manner as he has  Gun  Why I thought to myself thinks I the young Youth does not know his Soundings  Reef  Know his Soundings Why he'll run bump ashore for want of a Pilot but I'll watch him closely for though he won't take me in tow as I said before I am obliged to him and his Father  for all the Cargo I have and if there's a Call for it he shall find that for all this I'll stand by him as long as my Timbers will stick together Will you let me pilot you  All  Ay ay  Reef  Then all Hands aboard I'll only just take an Observation of our Bearings and be after you in less Time than you can count three Ratlings in the Mizen ShroudsAway    The Sailors go off  Pol    Coming on    I have got my Letter ready now to have it sent  Reef  I have been overhauling the Logbook of my Remembrance and can't find how I have derserved this UsageEhIs not that Polly  Pol  How's thisSurely I dreamDear  Tom  Reef  Why my sweet Girl how happens it that I should come along Side of you  Polly  Indeed you may well ask I have a long Story to tell you of how I came here but 'tis enough at present to say that I followed my Father who is a Slave to the Bashaw of this Place and I have written a Letter to him to beg he'll accept of me in his Stead 'Till my Father is released I can think of nothing else  Reef  Why then give me thy Letter and if I don't get him out of the Bilboes say I have bore up to you under false Colours that's all  Pol  And will you think of me when we are parted  Reef  Think of thee When a Heart like mine is moor'd to the Affection of such a sweet Girl as thee art you may as well pretend to heave up the Peak of  Teneriffe  as break it from its Moorings  Pol  Heigh ho  Reef  Don't be downhearted if we must part  we must but it shall go hard if we don't soon bring to in a better Latitude  AIR  I  Blow high blow low let Tempest tear  The Mainmast by the Board  My Heart with Thoughts of thee my dear  And Love well stor'd  Shall brave all Danger scorn all Fear  The roaring Wind the raging Sea  In hopes on Shore to be once more  Safe moor'd with thee  II  Aloft while Mountains high we go  The whistling Winds that scud along  And the Surge roaring from below  Shall my Signal be  To think or thee  And this shall be my Song  Blow high c  III  And on that Night when all the Crew  The Mem'ry of their former Lives  Our flowing Cans of Flip renew  And drink their Sweethearts and their Wives  I'll heave a Sigh and think of thee  And as the Ship rowls

Always beware of a Lawyer with your Estate in his Hands and a Turk with his Scymetar at your Throat  Good  Why to be sure though they are very generous when you trust them they are very Devils if you deceive them  Wil  I hope therefore this Plot was well devised  Good  Why don't I fell you I managed it myselfWell devised ay ay but I'll go and put off a little in the Boat as if I was fishing and so
