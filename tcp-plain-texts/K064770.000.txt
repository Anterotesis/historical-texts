 AN ESSAY Towards a  New Theory  OF VISION  By GEORGE BERKELEY M A Fellow of  Trinity College    Dublin  DUBLIN  Printed by AARON RHAMES at the Back of  Dick  's  CoffeeHouse  for JEREMY PEPYAT Bookseller in  SkinnerRow  MDCCIX  To the Right Honourable Sir  John Percivale  Bar  t  ONE OF Her Majesty's Most Honourable  PRIVY COUNCIL  IN THE Kingdom of  Ireland  SIR  I Cou'd not without doing Violence to my Self forbear upon this Occasion to give some publick Testimony of the Great and Wellgrounded Esteem  I have conceiv'd for You ever since I had the Honour and Happiness of Your Acquaintance The outward Advantages of Fortune and the early Honours with which You are Adorn'd together with the Reputation You are known to have amongst the Best and most Considerable Men may well imprint Veneration and Esteem on the Minds of those who behold You from a Distance But these are not the chief Motives that Inspire me with the Respect I bear You A nearer Approach has given me the View of something in Your Person infinitely beyond  the External Ornaments of Honour and Estate I mean an Intrinsic Stock of Vertue and good Sense a True Concern for Religion and disinterested Love of Your Country Add to these an uncommon proficiency in the best and most useful Parts of Knowledge together with what in my Mind is a Perfection of the first Rank a surpassing Goodness of Nature All which I have Collected not from the uncertain Reports of Fame but from my own Experience Within these few Months that I have the Honour to be known unto You the many delightful Hours  I have pass'd in Your Agreeable and Improving Conversation have afforded me the opportunity of Discovering in You many Excellent Qualities which at once fill me with Admiration and Esteem That one at those Years and in those Circumstances of Wealth and Greatness shou'd continue Proof against the Charms of Luxury and those Criminal Pleasures so fashionable and predominant in the Age we live in That He shou'd preserve a sweet and modest Behaviour free from that insolent and assuming Air so familiar to those who are placed above  the ordinary Rank of Men That He shou'd manage a great Fortune with that Prudence and Inspection and at the same time expend it with that Generosity and Nobleness of Mind as to shew Himself equally remote from a sordid Parsimony and a lavish inconsiderate Profusion of the good Things He is intrusted with This surely were Admirable and Praise worthy But that He shou'd moreover by an impartial Exercise of His Reason and constant Perusal of the Sacred Scriptures endeavour to attain a right Notion of the Principles of Natural and Revealed  Religion That He shou'd with the Concern of a true Patriot have the Interest of the Publick at Heart and omit no means of Informing Himself what may be Prejudicial or Advantageous to his Country in order to prevent the one and promote the other In fine that by a constant Application to the most severe and useful Studies by a strict Observation of the Rules of Honour and Vertue by frequent and serious Reflections on the mistaken Measures of the World and the true End and Happiness of Mankind He shou'd in all respects qualify Himself bravely to run the Race that is set before Him to  deserve the Character of  Great  and  Good  in this Life and be ever Happy hereafter This were amazing and almost incredible Yet all this and more than this SIR might I justly say of you did either your Modesty permit or your Character stand in Need of it I know it might deservedly be thought a Vanity in me to imagine that any thing coming from so obscure a Hand as mine cou'd add a lustre to your Reputation But I am withal sensible How far I advance the Interest of my own by laying hold on this Opportunity to make it known that I am admitted into some degree of Intimacy with a Person  of Your Exquisite Judgment And with that View I have ventur'd to make You an Address of this Nature which the Goodness I have ever experienced in You inclines me to hope will meet with a favourable Reception at Your Hands Tho' I must own I have Your Pardon to ask for touching on what may possibly be Offensive to a Vertue You are possest of in a very distinguishing Degree Excuse me SIR if it was out of my Power to mention the Name of SIR JOHN PERCIVALE without paying some Tribute to that Extraordinary  and surprising Merit whereof I have so lively and affecting an  Idea  and which I am sure cannot be expos'd in too full a light for the Imitation of Others Of late I have been agreeably imploy'd in considering the most Noble Pleasant and Comprehensive of all the Senses The fruit of that Labour shall I call it or Diversion is what I now Present You with in Hopes it may give some Entertainment to one who in the midst of Business and Vulgar Enjoyments preserves a Relish for the more Refin'd  Pleasures of Thought and Reflexion My Thoughts concerning  Vision  have led me into some Notions so far out of the common Road that it had been improper to Address them to one of a narrow and contracted  Genius  But You SIR being Master of a large and free Understanding rais'd above the Power of those Prejudices that enslave the far greater Part of Mankind may deservedly be thought a proper Patron for an Attempt of this Kind Add to this that You are no less dispos'd to Forgive than qualify'd  to discern whatever Faults may occur in it Nor do I think You defective in any one Point necessary to form an Exact Judgment on the most abstract and difficult Things so much as in a just Confidence of Your own Abilities And in this one Instance give me leave to say You shew a manifest weakness of Judgment With Relation to the following  Essay  I shall only add that I beg Your Pardon for laying a Trifle of that Nature in your Way at a time when you are engag'd in the Important  Affairs of the Nation and desire you to think that I am with all Sincerity and Respect  SIR  Your most Faithful And most Humble Servant

emancipate  p l r  Objects  p l r  nothing  p l r  acquiesced  p l r  Homogeneous  p l r  Figures  p l for  this  r  their  p l r  it is  AN ESSAY TOWARDS  A New Theory of Vision  I Design  MY Design is to shew the manner wherein we perceive by Sight the Distance Magmtude and Situation of  Objects  Also to consider the Difference there is betwixt the  Ideas  of Sight and Touch and whether there be any  Idea  common to both Senses In treating of all which it seems to me the Writers of  Optics  have proceeded on wrong Principles  II Distance of it self Invisible  It is I think agreed by all that  Distance  of it self and immediately cannot be seen For  Distance  being a Line directed endwise to the Eye it projects only one Point in the Fund of the Eye Which Point remains invariably the same whether the Distance be longer or shorter  III Remote Distance perceiv'd rather by Experience than by Sense  I find it also acknowledg'd that the Estimate we make of the Distance of  Objects  considerably remote is rather an Act of Judgment grounded on  Experience  than of  Sense  For Example When I perceive a great number of intermediate  Objects  such as Houses Fields Rivers and the like which I have experienced to take up a considerable Space I thence form a Judgment or Conclusion that the  Object  I see beyond them is at a great Distance Again when an  Object  appears Faint and Small which at a near Distance I have experienced to make a vigorous and large Appearance I instantly conclude it to be far off And this 'tis  evident is the result of  Experience  without which from the Faintness and Littleness I should not have infer'd any thing concerning the Distance of  Objects  IV Near Distance thought to be perceived by the  Angle  of the  Optic Axes  But when an  Object  is placed at so near a Distance as that the Interval between the Eyes bears any sensible Proportion to it It is the receiv'd Opinion that the two  Optic Axes  the Fancy that we see only with one Eye at once being exploded concurring at the  Object  do there make an  Angle  by means of which according as it is Greater or Lesser the  Object  is perceiv'd to be nearer or farther off  V Difference between this and the former manner of perceiving Distance  Betwixt which and the foregoing manner of Estimating Distance there is this remarkable Difference That whereas there was no apparent necessary Connexion between small Distance and a large and strong Appearance or between great Distance and a little and faint Appearance Yet there appears a very necessary Connexion  between an obtuse Angle and near Distance and an acute Angle and farther Distance It does not in the least depend upon Experience but may be evidently known by any one before he had experienc'd it that the nearer the Concurrence of the  Optic Axes  the greater the  Angle  and the remoter their Concurrence is the lesser will be the  Angle  comprehended by them  VI Also by Diverging Rays  There is another way mention'd by the  Optic Writers  whereby they will have us judge of those Distances in respect of which the breadth of the  Pupil  hath any sensible bigness And that is the greater or lesser Divergency of the Rays which issuing from the visible Point do fall on the  Pupil  That Point being judged nearest which is seen by most diverging Rays and that remoter which is seen by less diverging Rays And so on the apparent Distance still increasing as the Divergency of the Rays decreases till at length it becomes infinite when the Rays that fall on the  Pupil  are to  Sense Parallel And after this manner it is said we perceive Distances when we look only with one Eye  VII This depends not on Experience  In this Case also 'tis plain we are not beholding to Experience It being a certain necessary Truth that the nearer the direct Rays falling on the Eye approach to a  Parallelism  the farther off is the Point of their Intersection or the visible Point from whence they flow  VIII These the common Accounts but not satisfactory  I have here set down the common current Accounts that are given of our perceiving near Distances by Sight which tho' they are unquestionably receiv'd for true by  Mathematicians  and accordingly made use of by them in determining the apparent Places of  Objects  do nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory And that for these following Reasons  IX Some  Ideas  perceived by the mediation of others  First  It is evident that when the Mind perceives any  Idea  not immediately and of it self it must be by  the means of some other  Idea  Thus for Instance the Passions which are in the Mind of another are of themselves to me invisible I may nevertheless perceive them by Sight tho' not immediately yet by means of the Colours they produce in the Countenance We do often see Shame or Fear in the Looks of a Man by perceiving the Changes of his Countenance to Red or Pale  X No  Idea  which is not it self perceived can be the means of perceiving another  Moreover it is evident that no  Idea  which is not it self perceiv'd can be to me the means of perceiving any other  Idea  If I do not perceive the Redness or Paleness of a Man's Face themselves it is impossible I shou'd perceive by them the Passions which are in his Mind  XI Distance perceived by means of some other  Idea  Now from  Sect  II 'Tis plain that Distance is in it's own nature imperceivable and yet it is perceiv'd by Sight It remains therefore that it be brought into view by means of some other  Idea  that is it self immediately perceiv'd in the Act of  Vision  XII Those Lines and Angles mentioned in  Optics  are not themselves perceiv'd  But those  Lines  and  Angles  by means whereof  Mathematicians  pretend to explain the Perception of Distance are themselves not at all perceiv'd nor are they in Truth ever thought of by those unskilful in  Optics  I appeal to any ones Experience whether upon Sight of an  Object  he compute it's Distance by the bigness of the  Angle  made by the meeting of the two  Optic Axes  Or whether he ever think of the greater or lesser Divergency of the Rays which arrive from any Point to his  Pupil  Nay whether it be not perfectly impossible for him to perceive by Sense the various Angles wherewith the Rays according to their greater or lesser Divergence do fall on his Eye Every one is himself the best Judge of what he perceives and what not In vain shall all the  Mathematicians  in the World tell me that I perceive certain  Lines  and  Angles  which introduce into my Mind the various  Ideas  of  Distance  so long as I my self am conscious of no such thing  XIII Hence the Mind doth not perceive Distance by Lines and Angles  Since therefore those  Angles  and  Lines  are not themselves perceiv'd by Sight it follows from  Sect  X that the Mind does not by them judge of the Distance of  Objects  XIV Also because they have no real Existence  Secondly  The Truth of this Assertion will be yet farther evident to any one that considers those  Lines  and  Angles  have no real Existence in Nature being only an  Hypothesis  fram'd by  Mathematicians  and by them introduc'd into  Optics  that they might treat of that Science in a  Geometrical  way  XV And because they are insufficient to explain the Phaenomena  The  Third  and Last Reason I shall give for my Rejecting that Doctrine is that tho' we should grant the real Existence of those  Optic Angles  c and that it was possible for the Mind to perceive them yet these Principles wou'd not be found sufficient to explain the  Phaenomena  of  Distance  As shall be shewn hereafter  XVI The  Ideas  that suggest Distance are  st  the Sensation arising from the turn of the Eyes  Now It being already shewn that Distance is suggested to the Mind by the Mediation of some other  Idea  which is it self perceiv'd in the Act of Seeing It remains that we enquire what  Idea  or  Sensations  there be that attend  Vision  unto which we may suppose the  Ideas  of Distance are connected and by which they are introduced into the Mind And  First  It is certain by Experience that when we look at a near  Object  with both Eyes according as it approaches or recedes from us we alter the Disposition of our Eyes by lessening or widening the Interval between the  Pupils  This Disposition or Turn of the Eyes is attended with a Sensation which seems to me to be that which in this Case brings the  Idea  of greater or lesser Distance into the Mind  XVII Betwixt which and Distance there is no necessary Connexion  Not that their is any natural or necessary Connexion between the  Sensation we perceive by the Turn of the Eyes and greater or lesser Distance But because the Mind has by constant  Experience  found the different Sensations corresponding to the different Dispositions of the Eyes to be attended each with a Different Degree of Distance in the  Object  There has grown an Habitual or Customary Connexion between those two sorts of  Ideas  So that the Mind no sooner perceives the Sensation arising from the different Turn it gives the Eyes in order to bring the  Pupils  nearer or farther asunder but it withal perceives the different  Idea  of Distance which was wont to be connected with that Sensation Just as upon hearing a certain Sound the  Idea  is immediately suggested to the Understanding which Custom had united with it  XVIII Scarce room for Mistake in this matter  Nor do I see how I can easily be mistaken in this Matter I know evidently that Distance is not perceived  of it self That by consequence it must be perceived by means of some other  Idea  which is immediately perceiv'd and varies with the different Degrees of Distance I know also that the Sensation arising from the Turn of the Eyes is of it self immediately perceiv'd and various Degrees thereof are connected with different Distances which never fail to accompany them into my Mind when I view an  Object  distinctly with both Eyes whose Distance is so small that in respect of it the Interval between the Eyes has any considerable Magnitude  XIX No regard had to the Angle of the  Optic Axes  I know it is a receiv'd Opinion that by altering the disposition of the Eyes the Mind perceives whether the Angle of the  Optic Axes  is made greater or lesser And that accordingly by a kind of  Natural Geometry  it judges the Point of their Intersection to be nearer or farther off But that this is not true I am convinc'd  by my own Experience Since I am not conscious that I make any such use of the Perception I have by the Turn of my Eyes And for me to make those Judgments and draw those Conclusions from it without knowing that I do so seems altogether incomprehensible  XX Judgment of Distance made with both Eyes the Result of  Experience  From all which it plainly follows that the Judgment we make of the Distance of an  Object  view'd with both Eyes is entirely the  Result of Experience  If we had not constantly found certain Sensations arising from the various Disposition of the Eyes attended with certain degrees of Distance We shou'd never make those sudden Judgments from them concerning the Distance of  Objects  no more than we wou'd pretend to judge of a Man's Thoughts by his pronouncing Words we had never heard before  XXI dly Confusedness of Appearance  Secondly  An  Object  placed at a certain Distance from the Eye to which the breadth of the  Pupil  bears a considerable Proportion being made to approach is seen more confusedly And the nearer it is brought the more confused Appearance it makes And this being found constantly to be so there arises in the Mind an  Habitual  Connexion between the several Degrees of Confusion and Distance The greater Confusion still implying the lesser Distance and the lesser Confusion the greater Distance of the  Object  XXII This the occasion of those Judgments attributed to diverging Rays  This confused Appearance of the  Object  doth therefore seem to me to be the  Medium  whereby the Mind judges of Distance in those Cases wherein the most approv'd Writers of  Optics  will have it judge by the different Divergency with which the Rays flowing from the Radiating Point fall on the  Pupil  No  Man I believe will pretend to see or feel those imaginary Angles that the Rays are supposed to form according to their various Inclinations on his Eye But he cannot choose seeing whether the  Object  appear more or less confused It is therefore a manifest Consequence from what has been Demonstrated that instead of the greater or lesser Divergency of the Rays the Mind makes use of the greater or lesser Confusedness of the Appearance thereby to determine the apparent Place of an  Object  XXIII Objection answer'd  Nor doth it avail to say there is not any necessary Connexion between confused  Vision  and Distance great or small For I ask any Man What necessary Connexion he Sees between the Redness of a Blush and Shame And yet no sooner shall he behold that Colour to arise in the Face of another But it brings into his Mind the  Idea  of that Passion  which has been observ'd to accompany it  XXIV What deceives the Writers of  Optics  in this matter  What seems to have misled the Writers of  Optics  in this Matter is that they imagine Men judge of Distance as they do of a Conclusion in  Mathematics  betwixt which and the Premises it is indeed absolutely requisite there be an apparent necessary Connexion But it is far otherwise in the sudden Judgments Men make of Distance We are not to think that Brutes and Children or even grown reasonable Men whenever they perceive an  Object  to approach or depart from them do it by vertue of  Geometry  and  Demonstration  XXV The Cause why one  Idea  may suggest another  That one  Idea  may suggest another to the Mind it will suffice that they have been observ'd to go together without any demonstration of the necessity of their Coexistence or without so much as knowing  what it is that makes them so to Coexist Of this there are innumerable Instances of which no one can be Ignorant  XXVI This applyed to Confusion and Distance  Thus greater Confusion having been constantly attended with nearer Distance no sooner is the former  Idea  perceiv'd but it suggests the latter to our Thoughts And if it had been the ordinary Course of Nature that the farther off an  Object  were placed the more Confused it shou'd appear It is certain the very same Perception that now makes us think an  Object  approaches would then have made us to imagine it went farther off That Perception abstracting from  Custom  and  Experience  being equally fitted to produce the  Idea  of great Distance or small Distance or no Distance at all  XXVII  dly  The straining of the Eye  Thirdly  an  Object  being placed at the Distance above specified and  brought nearer to the Eye we may nevertheless prevent at least for some time the Appearance's growing more confus'd by straining the Eye In which Case that Sensation supplys the place of confused  Vision  in aiding the Mind to judge of the Distance of the  Object  It being esteemed so much the nearer by how much the effort or straining of the Eye in order to distinct  Vision  is greater  XXVIII The Occasions which suggest Distance have in their own Nature no Relation to it  I have here set down those Sensations or  Ideas  that seem to me to be the constant and general Occasions of introducing into the Mind the different  Ideas  of near Distance 'Tis true in most Cases that divers other Circumstances contribute to frame our  Idea  of Distance  viz  the particular Number Size Kind  c  of the things seen Concerning which as well as all other the forementioned Occasions which suggest Distance I  shall only observe they have none of them in their own Nature any Relation or Connexion with it Nor is it possible they shou'd ever signifie the various Degrees thereof otherwise than as by  Experience  they have been found to be connected with them  XXIX A difficult Case proposed by Dr  Barrow  as repugnant to all the known  Theories  I shall proceed upon these Principles to account for a  Phaenomenon  which has hitherto strangely puzzled the Writers of  Optics  and is so far from being accounted for by any of their  Theories  of  Vision  that it is by their own Confession plainly repugnant to them And of Consequence if nothing else cou'd be objected were alone sufficient to bring their Credit in Question The whole Difficulty I shall lay before you in the Words of the Learned Doctor  Barrow  with which he concludes his  Optic Lectures  Haec sunt quae circa partem  Opticae  praecipuè  Mathematicam  dicenda mihi suggessit meditatio Circa reliquas quae  sunt adeóque saepiusculè pro certis principiis

Thoughts have suggested to me concerning that part of  Optics  which is more properly  Mathematical  As for the other parts of that Science which being rather  Physical  do consequently abound with plausible Conjectures instead of certain Principles there has in them scarce any thing occur'd to my Observation different from what has been already said by  Kepler    Scheinerus    Descartes  c And methinks I had better say nothing at all than repeat that which has been so often said by others I think it therefore high time to take my leave of this Subject But before I quit it for good and all the fair and ingenuous Dealing that I owe both to You and to Truth obliges me to acquaint you with a certain untoward Difficulty which seems directly opposite to the Doctrine I  have been hitherto inculcating at least admits of no Solution from it In short it is this  Before the double Convex Glass or Concave  Speculum  EBF let the Point A be placed at such a Distance that the Rays proceeding from A after Refraction or Reflection be brought to Unite somewhere in the Ax AB And suppose the Point of Union  i e  the Image of the Point A as hath been already set forth to be Z between which and B the  Vertex  of the Glass or  Speculum  conceive the Eye to be any where placed The Question now is Where the Point A ought to appear Experience shews that it doth not appear behind at the Point Z and it were contrary  to Nature that it shou'd since all the Impression which affects the Sense comes from towards A But from our Tenents it shou'd seem to follow that it wou'd appear before the Eye at a vast Distance off so great as shou'd in some Sort surpass all sensible Distance For since if we exclude all Anticipations and Prejudices every  Object  appears by so much the farther off by how much the Rays it sends to the Eye are less Diverging And that  Object  is thought to be most remote from which Parallel Rays proceed unto the Eye Reason wou'd make one think that  Object  shou'd appear at yet a greater Distance which is seen by converging Rays Moreover it may in general be asked concerning this Case what it is that determines the apparent Place of the Point A and maketh it to appear after a constant manner sometimes nearer at other times farther off To which doubt I see nothing  that can be answer'd agreeable to the Principles we have laid down except only that the Point A ought always to appear extreamly remote But on the contrary we are assur'd by Experience that the Point A appears variously Distant according to the different Situations of the Eye between the Points B and Z And that it doth almost never if at all seem farther off than it wou'd if it were beheld by the naked Eye but on the contrary it doth sometimes appear much nearer Nay it is even certain that by how much the Rays falling on the Eye do more converge by so much the nearer does the  Object  seem to approach For the Eye being placed close to the Point B the  Object  A appears nearly in it's own natural Place if the Point B is taken in the Glass or at the same Distance if in the  Speculum  The Eye being brought back to O the  Object  seems to draw near And  being come to P it beholds it still nearer And so on by little and little till at length the Eye being placed somewhere suppose at Q the  Object  appearing extreamly near begins to vanish into meer Confusion All which doth seem Repugnant to our Principles at least not rightly to agree with them Nor is our Tenent alone struck at by this Experiment but likewise all others that ever came to my Knowledge are every whit as much endanger'd by it The ancient one especially which is most commonly receiv'd and comes nearest to mine seems to be so effectually overthrown thereby that the most learned  Tacquet  has been forc'd to reject that Principle as false and uncertain on which alone he had built almost his whole  Catoptrics  and consequently by taking away the Foundation hath himself pulled down the Superstructure he had raised on it Which nevertheless  I do not believe he wou'd have done had he but consider'd the whole matter more throughly and examin'd the Difficulty to the bottom But as for me neither this nor any other Difficulty shall have so great an Influence on me as to make me renounce that which I know to be manifestly agreeable to Reason Especially when as it here falls out the Difficulty is founded in the peculiar Nature of a certain odd and particular Case For in the present Case something peculiar lies hid which being involv'd in the Subtilty of Nature will perhaps hardly be discover'd till such Time as the manner of  Vision  is more perfectly made known Concerning which I must own I have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the least shew of  Probability  not to mention  Certainty  I shall therefore leave this Knot to be united by you wishing you may have better Success in it than I have had  XXX This Case contradicts a receiv'd Principle in  Catoptrics  The ancient and receiv'd Principle which Dr  Barrow  here mentions as the main Foundation of  Tacquet  's  Catoptrics  is that  every visible Point seen by Reflexion from a  Speculum  shall appear placed at the Intersection of the reflected Ray and the Perpendicular of Incidence  Which Intersection in the present Case happening to be behind the Eye it greatly shakes the Authority of that Principle whereon the aforemention'd Author proceeds throughout his whole  Catoptrics  in determining the apparent Place of  Objects  seen by Reflexion from any kind of  Speculum  XXXI It is shewn to agree with the Principles we have laid down  Let us now see how this  Phaenomenon  agrees with our Tenents The Eye the nearer it is placed to the Point B in the above Figures the more distinct is the Appearance of the  Object  but as it recedes to O the Appearance grows more Confused and at P it sees  the  Object  yet more Confused and so on till the Eye being brought back to Z sees the  Object  in the greatest Confusion of all Wherefore by  Sect  XXI the  Object  shou'd seem to approach the Eye gradually as it recedes from the Point B  viz  at O it shou'd in consequence of the Principle I have laid down in the aforesaid  Section  seem nearer than it did at B and at P nearer than at O and at Q nearer than at P and so on till it quite vanishes at Z Which is the very matter of Fact as any one that pleases may easily satisfie himself by Experiment  XXXII This  Phaenomenon  Illustrated  This Case is much the same as if we shou'd suppose an  Englishman  to meet a Foreigner who used the same Words with the  English  but in a direct contrary Signification The  Englishman  wou'd not fail to make a wrong Judgment of the  Ideas  annexed to  those Sounds in the Mind of him that used them Just so in the present Case the  Object  speaks if I may so say with Words that the Eye is well acquainted with  viz  Confusions of Appearance but whereas heretofore the greater Confusions were always wont to signifie nearer Distances they have in this Case a direct contrary Signification being connected with the greater Distances Whence it follows that the Eye must unavoidably be mistaken since it will take the Confusions in the Sense it has been used to which is directly opposed to the True  XXXIII It confirms the Truth of the Principle whereby it is explained  This  Phaenomenon  as it entirely subverts the Opinion of those who will have us judge of Distance by Lines and Angles on which Supposition it is altogether inexplicable so it seems to me no small Confirmation of the Truth of that Principle whereby it is explain'd  But in order to a more full Explication of this Point and to shew how far the  Hypothesis  of the Mind's judging by the various Divergency of Rays may be of use in determining the apparent Place of an  Object  it will be necessary to premise some few Things which are already well known to those who have any Skill in  Dioptrics  XXXIV Vision when Distinct and when Confus'd  First  Any radiating Point is then distinctly seen when the Rays proceeding from it are by the refractive Power of the Crystalline accurately reunited in the  Retina  or Fund of the Eye But if they are reunited either before they arrive at the  Retina  or after they have past it then there is confused Vision  XXXV The different Effects of Parallel Diverging and Converging Rays  Secondly  Suppose in the adjacent Figures NP represent an Eye duly framed and retaining its natural  Figure In  Fig  the Rays falling nearly Parallel on the Eye are by the Crystalline AB refracted so as their  Focus  or Point of Union F falls exactly on the  Retina  But if  Fig  Fig  Fig  the Rays fall sensibly diverging on the Eye as in  Fig  then their  Focus  falls beyond the  Retina  Or if the Rays are made to converge by the  Lens  QS before they come at the Eye as in  Fig  their  Focus  F will fall before the  Retina  In which two last  Cases 'tis evident from the foregoing  Section  that the Appearance of the Point Z is confused And by how much the greater is the Convergency or Divergency of the Rays falling on the  Pupil  by so much the farther will the Point of their reunion be from the  Retina  either before or behind it and consequently the Point Z will appear by so much the more Confused And this by the Bye may shew us the difference between Confused and Faint Vision Confused Vision is when the Rays proceedings from each distinct Point of the  Object  are not accurately recollected in one corresponding Point on the  Retina  but take up some Space thereon So that Rays from different Points become mix'd and confused together This is opposed to distinct Vision and attends near  Objects  Faint Vision is when by reason of the Distance of the  Object  or grossness of the interjacent  Medium  few Rays arrive from the  Object  to the Eye This is oppos'd to vigorous or clear Vision and attends remote  Objects  But to return  XXXVI How Converging and Diverging Rays come to suggest the same Distance  The Eye or to speak truly the Mind perceiving only the Confusion it self without ever considering the Cause from which it proceeds doth constantly annex the same Degree of Distance to the same Degree of Confusion Whether that Confusion be occasion'd by Converging or by Diverging Rays it matters not Whence it follows that the Eye viewing the  Object  Z thro' the Glass QS which by Refraction causeth the Rays ZQ ZS  c  to converge shou'd judge it to be at such a Nearness at which if it were placed it wou'd radiate on the Eye with Rays diverging to that Degree as wou'd produce the same Confusion which is now produced by Converging  Rays  i e  wou'd cover a Portion of the  Retina  equal to DC  vid Fig    Sup  But then this must be understood to use Dr  Barrow  's Phrase  Seclusis praenotionibus praejudiciis  In case we abstract from all other Circumstances of Vision such as the Figure Size Faintness  c  of the visible  Objects  all which do ordinarily concur to form our  Idea  of Distance the Mind having by frequent Experience observed their several Sorts or Degrees to be connected with various Distances  XXXVII A Person extream Purblind wou'd judge aright in the foremention'd Case  It plainly follows from what has been said that a Person perfectly Purblind  i e  that cou'd not see an  Object  distinctly but when placed close to his Eye wou'd not make the same wrong Judgment that others do in the foremention'd Case For to him greater Confusions constantly suggesting greater Distances he must as he recedes from the Glass and the  Object  grows more Confus'd  judge it to be at a farther Distance contrary to what they do who have had the Perception of the  Object's  growing more Confused connected with the  Idea  of Approach  XXXVIII Lines and Angles why useful in  Optics  Hence also it doth appear there may be good use of computation by Lines and Angles in  Optics  not that the Mind judges of Distance immediately by them but because it judges by somewhat which is connected with them and to the determination whereof they may be subservient Thus the Mind judging of the Distance of an  Object  by the Confusedness of it's Appearance and this Confusedness being greater or lesser to the naked Eye according as the  Object  is seen by Rays more or less Diverging it follows that a Man may make use of the Divergency of the Rays in computing the apparent Distance tho' not for it's own sake yet on account of the Confusion with which it is connected  But so it is the Confusion it self is entirely neglected by  Mathematicians  as having no necessary relation with Distance such as the greater or lesser Angles of Divergency are conceiv'd to have And these especially for that they fall under  Mathematical  Computation are alone regarded in determining the apparent Places of  Objects  as tho' they were the sole and immediate Cause of the Judgments the Mind makes of Distance Whereas in Truth they shou'd not at all be regarded in themselves or any otherwise than as they are supposed to be the Cause of Confused Vision  XXXIX The not understanding this a cause of Mistake  The not considering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing Oversight For Proof whereof we need go no farther than the Case before us It having been observed that the most Diverging Rays brought into the Mind the  Idea  of nearest Distance and that still as  the Divergency decreas'd the Distance increas'd and it being thought the connexion between the various Degrees of Divergency and Distance was immediate this naturally leads one to conclude from an ill grounded Analogy that Converging Rays shall make an  Object  appear at an immense Distance And that as the Convergency increases the Distance if it were possible shou'd do so likewise That this was the Cause of Dr  Barrow  's Mistake is evident from his own Words which we have Quoted Whereas had the learned Doctor observ'd that Diverging and Converging Rays how opposite soever they may seem do nevertheless agree in producing the same effect  viz Confusedness of Vision  greater Degrees whereof are produced indifferently either as the Divergency or Convergency of the Rays increaseth And that it is by this effect which is the same in both that either the Divergency or Convergency  is perceived by the Eye I say had he but consider'd this 'tis certain he wou'd have made a quite contrary Judgment and rightly concluded that those Rays which fall on the Eye with greater degrees of Convergency shou'd make the  Object  from whence they proceed appear by so much the nearer But 'tis plain it was impossible for any Man to attain to a right Notion of this Matter so long as he had regard only to Lines and Angles and did not apprehend the true Nature of  Vision  and how far it was of  Mathematical  Consideration  XL A Query propos'd by Mr  Molyneux  in his  Dioptrics  consider'd  Before we dismiss this this Subject 'tis fit we take Notice of a Query relating thereto proposed by the Ingenious Mr  Molyneux  in his Treatise of  Dioptrics    Par    Prop    Sect  where speaking of the Difficulty we have been explaining he has these Words  And so he  i e  Dr  Barrow  leaves this Difficulty to the Solution of Others which I after so great an Example shall do likewise but with the Resolution of the same admirable Author of not quitting the evident Doctrine which we have before laid down for determining the  Locus Objecti  on account of being Press'd by one Difficulty which seems inexplicable till a more intimate Knowledge of the Visive Faculty be obtain'd by Mortals In the mean time I propose it to the Consideration of the Ingenious Whether the  Locus Apparens  of an  Object  placed as in this th  Section  be not as much before the Eye as the distinct Base is behind the Eye  To which Query we may venture to answer in the Negative For in the present Case the Rule for determining the Distance of the distinct Base or respective  Focus  from the  Glass is this  As the difference between the Distance of the  Object  and  Focus ∶  is to the  Focus  or Focal Length  ∷  So the Distance of the  Object  from the Glass  ∶  to the Distance of the respective  Focus  or Distinct Base from the Glass Vid  Molyneux  Dioptr Par    Prop  Let us now suppose the  Object  to be placed at the Distance of the Focal Length and one half of the Focal Length from the Glass and the Eye close to the Glass Hence it will follow by the Rule that the Distance of the Distinct Base behind the Eye is double the true Distance of the  Object  before the Eye If therefore Mr  Molyneux  's Conjecture held good it wou'd follow that the Eye shou'd see the  Object  twice as far off as it really is And in other Cases at three or four times it's due Distance or more But this manifestly contradicts Experience the  Object  never appearing at farthest beyond its due Distance Whatever  therefore is built on this Supposition  vid Corol    Prop    ibid  comes to the Ground along with it  XLI One Born Blind wou'd not at first have any  Idea  of Distance by Sight  From what hath been premis'd it is a manifest Consequence that a Man Born Blind being made to see wou'd at first have no  Idea  of Distance by Sight The Sun and Stars the remotest  Objects  as well as the nearer wou'd all seem to be in his Eye or rather in his Mind The  Objects  intromitted by Sight wou'd seem to him as in truth they are no other than a new Set of Thoughts or Sensations each whereof is as near to him as the Perceptions of Pain or Pleasure or the most inward Passions of his Soul For our judging  Objects  perceiv'd by Sight to be at any Distance or without the Mind is  vid Sect  XXVIII intirely the effect of Experience which one in those Circumstances  cou'd not yet have attained to  XLII This not agreeable to the common Principles  It is indeed otherwise upon the common Supposition that Men judge of Distance by the Angle of the  Optic Axes  just as one in the Dark or a BlindMan by the Angle comprehended by two Sticks one whereof he held in each Hand For if this were true it wou'd follow that one Blind from his Birth being made to See shou'd stand in need of no new Experience in order to perceive Distance by Sight But that this is False has I think been sufficiently demonstrated  XLIII The proper  Objects  of Sight not without the Mind nor the Images of any thing without the Mind  And perhaps upon a strict Inquiry we shall not find that even those who from their Birth have grown up in a continu'd Habit of Seeing are irrecoverably prejudiced on the other side  viz  in thinking what they See to be at a Distance from them For at this  time it seems agreed on all Hands by those who have had any thoughts of that Matter that Colours which are the proper and immediate  Object  of Sight are not without the Mind But then say you by Sight we have also the  Ideas  of Extension and Figure and Motion all which may well be thought without and at some Distance from the Mind tho' Colour shou'd not In answer to this I appeal to any Man's Experience whether the visible Extension of any  Object  do not appear as near to him as the Colour of that  Object  Nay whether they do not both seem to be in the very same Place Is not the Extension we see Colour'd and is it possible for us so much as in Thought to separate and abstract Colour from Extension Now where the Extension is there surely is the Figure and there the Motion too I speak of those which are perceiv'd by Sight  XLIV This more fully explain'd  But for a fuller Explication of this Point and to shew that the immediate  Objects  of Sight are not so much as the  Ideas  or Resemblances of things placed at a Distance 'tis requisite we look nearer into the Matter and carefully observe what is meant in common Discourse when one says that which he sees is at a Distance from him Suppose for Example That looking at the Moon I shou'd say it were Fifty or Sixty Semidiameters of the Earth distant from me Let us see what Moon this is spoken of 'Tis plain it cannot be the visible Moon or any thing like the visible Moon or that which I see which is only a round luminous Plain of about Thirty visible Points in Diameter For in case I am carry'd from the place where I stand directly towards the Moon 'tis manifest the  Object  varies still as I  go on and by the time that I am advanced Fifty or Sixty Semidiameters of the Earth I shall be so far from being near a small round luminous Flat that I shall perceive nothing like it this  Object  having long since disappear'd and if I wou'd recover it it must be by going back to the Earth from whence I set out Again Suppose I perceive by Sight the faint and obscure  Idea  of something which I doubt whether it be a Man or a Tree or a Tower but judge it to be at the Distance of about a Mile 'Tis plain I cannot mean that what I see is a Mile off or that it is the Image or Likeness of any thing which is a Mile off Since that every Step I take towards it the Appearance alters and from being Obscure Small and Faint grows Clear Large and Vigorous And when I come to the Mile's end that which I saw  first is quite lost neither do I find any thing in the likeness of it  XLV In what Sense we must be understood to see Distance and external Things  In these and the like Instances the truth of the Matter I find stands thus Having of a long time experienced certain  Ideas  perceivable by Touch as Distance Tangible Figure and Solidity to have been connected with certain  Ideas  of Sight I do upon perceiving these  Ideas  of Sight forthwith conclude what Tangible  Ideas  are by the wonted ordinary course of Nature like to follow Looking at an  Object  I perceive a certain Visible Figure and Colour with some degree of Faintness and other Circumstances which from what I have formerly observ'd determin me to think that if I advance forward so many Paces Miles  c  I shall be affected with such and such  Ideas  of Touch So that in truth and strictness of Speech I neither see Distance it self nor any  thing that I take to be at a Distance I say neither Distance nor things placed at a Distance are themselves or their  Ideas  truly perceiv'd by Sight This I am perswaded of as to what concerns my self And I believe whoever will look narrowly into his own Thoughts and examin what he means by saying he sees this or that thing at a Distance will agree with me that what he sees only suggests to his Understanding that after having passed a certain Distance to be measur'd by the Motion of his Body which is perceivable by Touch he shall come to perceive such and such Tangible  Ideas  which have been usually connected with such and such Visible  Ideas  But that one might be deceived by these suggestions of Sense and that there is no necessary Connexion between Visible and Tangible  Ideas  suggested by them we need go no farther than the next LookingGlass or Picture  to be convinced Note that when I speak of Tangible  Ideas  I take the Word  Idea  for any the immediate  Object  of Sense or Understanding in which large Signification it is commonly used by the Moderns  XLVI Distance and Things placed at a Distance not otherwise perceived by the Eye than by the Ear  From what we have shewn it is a manifest Consequence that the  Ideas  of Space Outness and things placed at a Distance are not strictly speaking the  Object  of Sight They are no otherwise perceived by the Eye than by the Ear Sitting in my Study I hear a Coach drive along the Streets I look through the Casement and see it I walk out and enter into it Thus common Speech wou'd incline one to think I heard saw and touch'd the same Thing  viz  the Coach It is nevertheless certain the  Ideas  intromitted by each Sense are widely different and distinct from each other but having been observed constantly to go  together they are spoken of as one and the same thing By the variation of the Noise I perceive the different Distances of the Coach and know that it approaches before I look out Thus by the Ear I perceive Distance just after the same manner as I do by the Eye  XLVII The  Ideas  of Sight more apt to be confounded with the  Ideas  of Touch than those of Hearing are  I do not nevertheless say I hear Distance in like manner as I say that I see it the  Ideas  perceiv'd by Hearing not being so apt to be confounded with the  Ideas  of Touch as those of Sight are So likewise a Man is easily convinced that Bodies and external Things are not properly the  Object  of Hearing but only Sounds by the Mediation whereof the  Idea  of this or that Body or Distance is suggested to his Thoughts But then one is with more difficulty brought to discern the difference there is betwixt the  Ideas  of Sight and Touch Tho' it be certain a Man no more Sees and Feels the same  Thing than he Hears and Feels the same Thing  XLVIII How this comes to pass  One Reason of which seems to be this It is thought a great Absurdity to imagine that one and the same thing shou'd have any more than one Extension and one Figure But the Extension and Figure of a Body being let into the Mind two ways and that indifferently either by Sight or Touch it seems to follow that we see the same Extension and the same Figure which we Feel  XLIX Strictly speaking we never see and feel the same thing  But if we take a close and accurate View of the Matter it must be acknowledg'd that we never See and Feel one and the same thing That which is Seen is one thing and that which is felt is another If the Visible Figure and Extension be not the same with the Tangible Figure and Extension we are not to infer that one and the same  thing has divers Extensions The true Consequence is that  the  Objects  of  Sight  and  Touch  are two distinct things  It may perhaps require some Thought rightly to conceive this Distinction And the difficulty seems not a little increas'd because the Combination of Visible  Ideas  hath constantly the same Name as the Combination of Tangible  Ideas  wherewith it is connected Which does of necessity arise from the use and end of Language  L  Objects  of  Sight  twofold Mediate and Immediate  In order therefore to treat accurately and unconfusedly of  Vision  we must bear in Mind that there are two sorts of  Objects  apprehended by the Eye The one primarily and immediately the other secondarily and by intervention of the former Those of the first sort neither are nor appear to be without the Mind or at any distance off They may indeed grow Greater  or Smaller more Confused or more Clear or more Faint But they do not cannot Approach or even seem to Approach or Recede from us Whenever we say an  Object  is at a Distance whenever we say it draws near or goes farther off we must always mean it of the latter sort which properly belong to the  Touch  and are not so truly perceived as suggested by the Eye in like manner as Thoughts by the Ear  LI These hard to separate in our Thoughts  No sooner do we hear the Words of a familiar Language pronounced in our Ears but the  Ideas  corresponding thereto present themselves to our Minds In the very same instant the Sound and the Meaning enter the Understanding So closely are they United that 'tis not in our Power to keep out the one except we exclude the other also We even act in all respects as tho' we heard the very  Thoughts themselves So likewise the Secondary  Objects  or those which are only suggested by Sight do often more strongly affect us and are more regarded than the proper  Objects  of that Sense along with which they enter into the Mind and with which they have a far more strict and near Connexion than  Ideas  have with Words Hence it is we find it so difficult to discriminate between the immediate and mediate  Objects  of Sight and are so prone to attribute to the former what belongs only to the latter They are as it were most closely twisted blended and incorporated together And the Prejudice is confirm'd and riveted in our Thoughts by a long tract of Time by the use of Language and want of Reflexion However I doubt not but any one that shall attentively consider what we have already said and shall say upon this Subject before  we have done especially if he pursue it in his own Thoughts may be able to deliver himself from that Prejudice Sure I am 'tis worth some Attention to whoever wou'd understand the true nature of  Vision  LII The received Accounts of our perceiving Magnitude by Sight false  I have now done with Distance and proceed to shew how it is that we perceive by Sight the Magnitude of Objects It is the Opinion of some that we do it by Angles or by Angles in Conjuction with Distance But neither Angles nor Distance being perceivable by Sight And the things we see being in truth at no Distance from us it follows that as we have demonstrated Lines and Angles not to be the  Medium  the Mind makes use of in apprehending the Apparent Place so neither are they the  Medium  whereby it apprehends the Apparent Magnitude of Objects  LIII Magnitude perceiv'd as immediately as Distance  It is well known that the same Extension at a near Distance shall subtend a greater Angle and at a farther Distance a lesser Angle And by this Principle we are told the Mind estimates the Magnitude of an  Object  comparing the Angle under which it is seen with its Distance and thence infering the Magnitude thereof What inclines Men to this Mistake beside the Humour of making one see by  Geometry  is that the same Perceptions or  Ideas  which suggest Distance do also suggest Magnitude But if we examine it we shall find they suggest the latter as immediately as the former I say they do not first suggest Distance and then leave it to the Judgment to use that as a  Medium  whereby to collect the Magnitude but they have as close and immediate a Connexion with the Magnitude as with the Distance and suggest Magnitude as independently of Distance  as they do Distance independently of Magnitude All which will be evident to whoever considers whathas been already said and what follows  LIV Two kinds of sensible Extension neither of which is infinitely Divisible  It has been shewn there are two sorts of  Objects  apprehended by Sight each whereof hath its distinct Magnitude or Extension The one properly Tangible  i e  to be perceiv'd and measur'd by Touch and not immediately falling under the Sense of Seeing The other properly and immediately Visible by Mediation of which the former is brought in View Each of these Magnitudes are greater or lesser according as they contain in them more or fewer Points they being made up of Points or  Minimums  For whatever may be said of Extension in  Abstract  it is certain sensible Extension is not infinitely Divisible There is a  Minimum Tangibile  and a  Minimum Visibile  beyond which Sense cannot perceive  This every ones Experience will inform him  LV The Tangible Magnitude of an  Object  steddy the Visible not  The Magnitude of the  Object  which exists without the Mind and is at a Distance continues always invariably the same But the Visible  Object  still changing as you approach to or recede from the Tangible  Object  it hath no fixed and determinate Greatness Whenever therefore we speak of the Magnitude of any thing for Instance a  Tree  or a  House  we must mean the Tangible Magnitude otherwise there can be nothing steddy and free from Ambiguity spoken of it Now tho' the Tangible and Visible Magnitude do in truth belong to two distinct Objects I shall nevertheless especially since those Objects are called by the same Name and are observ'd to coexist to avoid tediousness and singularity of Speech sometimes speak of them as belonging to one and the same thing  LVI By what means Tangible Magnitude is perceiv'd by Sight  Now in order to discover by what means the Magnitude of Tangible Objects is perceived by Sight I need only reflect on what Passes in my own Mind And observe what those things be which introduce the  Ideas  of  greater  or  lesser  into my Thoughts when I look on any  Object  And these I find to be First the Magnitude or Extension of the Visible  Object  which being immediately perceived by Sight is connected with that other which is Tangible and placed at a Distance Secondly The Confusion or Distinctness And Thirdly The Vigorousness or Faintness of the aforesaid Visible Appearance  Caeteris paribus  by how much the greater or lesser do I conclude the Tangible  Object  to be But be the  Idea  immediately perceived by Sight never so large yet if it be withal Confused  I judge the Magnitude of the thing to be but small If it be Distinct and Clear I judge it greater And if it be Faint I apprehend it to be yet greater What is here meant by Confusion and Faintness has been Explain'd in  Sect  XXXV  LVII This farther enlarged on  Moreover the Judgments we make of Greatness do in like manner as those of Distance depend on the Disposition of the Eyes also on the Figure Number of intermediate Objects and other Circumstances that have been observ'd to attend great or small Tangible Magnitudes Thus for Instance The very same Quantity of Visible Extension which in the Figure of a Tower doth suggest the  Idea  of great Magnitude shall in the Figure of a Man suggest the  Idea  of much smaller Magnitude That this is owing to the Experience we have had of the usual Bigness of  a Tower and a Man no one I suppose need be told  LVIII No necessary Connexion between Confusion or Faintness of Appearance and small or great Magnitude  It is also evident that Confusion Faintness  c  have no more a necessary Connexion with little or great Magnitude than they have with little or great Distance As they suggest the latter so they suggest the former to our Minds And by Consequence if it were not for  Experience  we shou'd no more judge a faint or confused Appearance to be connected with great or little Magnitude than we shou'd that it was connected with great or little Distance  LIX The Tangible Magnitude of an  Object  more heeded than the Visible and why  Nor will it be found that great or small Visible Magnitude hath any necessary Relation to great or small Tangible Magnitude So that the one may certainly and infallibly be infer'd from the other But before we come to the Proof of this 'tis fit we consider the difference  there is betwixt the Extension and Figure which is the proper Object of  Touch  and that other which is termed  Visible  and how the former is principally tho' not immediately taken notice of when we look at any  Object  This has been before mention'd but we shall here enquire into the Cause thereof We regard the Objects that environ us in proportion as they are adapted to benefit or injure our own Bodies and thereby produce in our Minds the Sensations of Pleasure or Pain Now Bodies operating on our Organs by an immediate Application And the Hurt and Advantage arising therefrom depending altogether on the Tangible ang not at all on the Visible Qualities of any Object This is a plain Reason why those shou'd be regarded by us much more than these And for this End chiefly the  Visive Sense  seems to have been bestowed  on Animals  viz  that by the Perception of Visible  Ideas  which in themselves are not capable of affecting or any wise altering the Frame of their Bodies they may be able to foresee from the Experience they have had what Tangible  Ideas  are connected with such and such Visible  Ideas  the Damage or Benefit which is like to ensue upon the Application of their own Bodies to this or that Body which is at a Distance Which Foresight how necessary it is to the preservation of an Animal every ones Experience can inform him Hence it is that when we look at an  Object  the Tangible Figure and Extension thereof are principally attended to whilst there is small heed taken of the Visible Figure and Magnitude which tho' more immediately perceiv'd do less sensibly affect us and are not fitted to produce any Alteration in our Bodies  LX An Instance of this  That the Matter of Fact is true will be evident to any one who considers that a Man placed at Ten Foot Distance is thought as great as if he were placed at the Distance only of Five Foot which is true not with Relation to the Visible but Tangible greatness of the  Object  The Visible Magnitude being far greater at one Station than it is at the other  LXI Men do not Measure by Visible Feet or Inches  Inches Feet  c  are settled stated Lengths whereby we measure Objects and estimate their Magnitude we say for Example an  Object  appears to be Six Inches or Six Foot long Now that this cannot be meant of Visible Inchches  c  is evident because a Visible Inch is it self no constant determinate Magnitude and cannot therefore serve to mark out and determin the Magnitude of any other  thing Take an Inch mark'd upon a Ruler view it successively at the Distance of Half a Foot a Foot a Foot and a Half  c  from the Eye at each of which and at all the intermediate Distances the Inch shall have a different Visible Extension  i e  there shall be more or fewer Points discerned in it Now I ask which of all these various Extensions is that Stated determinate one that is agreed on for a common Measure of other Magnitudes No reason can be assign'd why we shou'd pitch on one more than another And except there be some invariable determinate Extension fixed on to be mark'd by the Word  Inch  'tis plain it can be used to little Purpose and to say a Thing contains this or that Number of  Inches  shall imply no more than that it is extended without bringing any particular  Idea  of that Extension into the Mind Farther an  Inch and a Foot from different Distances shall both exhibit the same Visible Magnitude and yet at the same time you shall say that one seems several times greater than the other From all which it is manifest that the Judgments we make of the Magnitude of Objects by Sight are altogether in reference to their Tangible Extension Whenever we say an  Object  is Great or Small of this or that determinate Measure I say it must be meant of the Tangible and not the Visible Extension which tho' immediately perceiv'd is nevertheless little taken Notice of  LXII No necessary Conexion between Visible and Tangible Extension  Now that there is no necessary Connexion between these two Distinct Extensions is evident from hence Because our Eyes might have been framed in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what were less than the  Minimum Tangibile  In which Case it's not  impossible we might have perceived all the Immediate Objects of Sight the very same that we do now But unto those Visible Appearances there wou'd not be Connected those different Tangible Magnitudes that are now Which shews the Judgments we make of the Magnitude of Things placed at a Distance from the various Greatness of the Immediate Objects of Sight do not arise from any Essential or Necessary but only a Customary Tye which has been observ'd betwixt them  LXIII Greater Visible Magnitude might signifie Lesser Tangible Magnitude  Moreover it is not only certain that any  Idea  of Sight might not have been Connected with this or that  Idea  of Touch we now observe to accompany it But also that the greater Visible Magnitudes might have been Connected with and Introduced into our Minds lesser Tangible Magnitudes and  Vice Versa  Nay that it often is so we  have daily Experience that  Object  which makes a strong and large Appearance not seeming near so great as another the Visible Magnitude whereof is much less but more faint  LXIV The Judgments we make of Magnitude depend altogether on Experience  From which and from  Sect  LVII and LVIII it is manifest that as we do not perceive the Magnitude of Objects immediately by Sight so neither do we perceive them by the Mediation of any thing which has a necessary Connexion with them Those  Ideas  that now suggest unto us the various Magnitudes of External Objects before we touch them might possibly have suggested no such thing Or they might have signified them in a direct contrary manner so that the very same  Ideas  on the Perception whereof we judge an  Object  to be small might as well have serv'd to make us conclude it great Those  Ideas  being in their  own Nature equally fitted to bring into our Minds the  Idea  of Small or Great or no Size at all of outward Objects Just as the Words of any Language are in their own Nature indifferent to signifie this or that thing or nothing at all  LXV Distance and Magnitude seen as Shame or Anger  As we see Distance so we see Magnitude And we see both in the same way that we see Shame or Anger in the Looks of a Man Those Passions are themselves Invisible they are nevertheless let in by the Eye along with Colours and alterations of Countenance which are the immediate  Object  of  Vision  And which signifie them for no other Reason than barely because they have been observ'd to accompany them Without which Experience we shou'd no more have taken Blushing for a Sign of Shame than of Gladness  LXVI But we are prone to think otherwise and why  We are nevertheless exceeding Prone to imagine those things which are perceived only by the Mediation of others to be themselves the immediate Objects of Sight Or at least to have in their own Nature a Fitness to be suggested by them before ever they had been experienced to Coexist with them From which prejudice every one perhaps will not find it easy to emanicipate himself by any the clearest Convictions of Reason And there are some Grounds to think that if there was one only invariable and universal Language in the World and that Men were born with the Faculty of speaking it it wou'd be the Opinion of some that the  Ideas  in other Mens Minds were properly perceived by the Ear or had at least a necessary and inseparable Tye with the Sounds that were affixed to them All which seems to  arise from want of a due Application of our Discerning Faculty thereby to Discriminate between the  Ideas  that are in our Understandings and consider them apart from each other which wou'd preserve us from confounding those that are different and make us to see what  Ideas  do and what do not include or imply this or that other  Idea  LXVII The Moon seems greater in the  Horizon  than in the  Meridian  There is a Celebrated  Phaenomenon  the Solution whereof I shall attempt to give by the Principles that have been laid down in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by Sight the Magnitude of Objects It is as follows The apparent Magnitude of the Moon when placed in the  Horizon  is much greater than when it is in the  Meridian  Tho' the Angle under which the Diameter of the Moon is seen be not observ'd greater in the former Case than  in the latter Moreover the Horizontal Moon doth not constantly appear of the same Bigness but at some times seemeth far greater than at others  LXVIII The cause of this Phaenomenon assigned  Now in order to explicate the reason of the Moon's appearing greater than ordinary in the  Horizon  it must be observ'd that the Particles which compose our Atmosphaere do intercept the Rays of Light proceeding from any  Object  to the Eye and by how much the greater is the Portion of Atmosphaere interjacent between the  Object  and the Eye by so much the more are the Rays intercepted and by consequence the Appearance of the  Object  render'd more Faint Every  Object  appearing more Vigorous or more Faint in Proportion as it sendeth more or fewer Rays unto the Eye Now between the Eye and the Moon when situated in the  Horizon  there lies  a far greater Quantity of Atmosphaere than there does when the Moon is in the  Meridian  Whence it comes pass that the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon is fainter and therefore by  Sect  LVI it shou'd be thought bigger in that Situation than in the  Meridian  or in any other Elevation above the  Horizon  LXIX The Horizontal Moon why greater at one time than another  Farther The Air being variously impregnated sometimes more and sometimes less with Vapours and Exhalations fitted to retund and intercept the Rays of Light it follows that the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon hath not always an equal Faintness and by Consequence that Luminary tho' in the very same Situation is at one time judged greater than at another  LXX The Account we have given prov'd to be true  That we have here given the true Account of the  Phaenomena  of the Horizontal Moon will I suppose  be farther Evident to any one from the following Considerations  First  'Tis plain that which in this Case suggests the  Idea  of greater Magnitude must be something which is it self perceiv'd for that which is unperceiv'd cannot suggest to our Perception any other thing  Secondly  It must be something that does not constantly remain the same but is subject to some Change or Variation since the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon varies being at one time greater than at another  Thirdly  It must not lie in the External Circumjacent or Intermediate Objects but be an Affection of the very Visible Moon it self Since by looking thro' a Tube when all other Objects are excluded from Sight the Appearance is as great as ever And yet  Fourthly  It cannot be the Visible Figure or Magnitude since that remains the same or is rather  lesser by how much the Moon is nearer to the  Horizon  It remains therefore that the true Cause is that Affection or Alteration of the Visible Appearance which proceeds from the greater Paucity of Rays arriving at the Eye and which I term  Faintness  Since this answers all the foremention'd Conditions and I am not conscious of any other Perception that does  LXXI And confirmed by the Moon's appearing greater in a Mist  Add to this that in misty Weather it is a common Observation that the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon is far larger than usual which greatly conspires with and strengthens our Opinion Neither wou'd it prove in the least Irreconcilable with what we have said If the Horizontal Moon shou'd chance sometime to seem enlarged beyond its usual Extent even in more Serene Weather For we must not only have regard to the Mist which happens to be in  the place where we stand we ought also to take into our Thoughts the whole Sum of Vapours and Exhalations which lie betwixt the Eye and the Moon All which cooperating to render the Appearance of the Moon more Faint and thereby increase it's Magnitude it may chance to appear greater than it usually does even in the Horizontal Position at a time when tho' there be no extraordinary Fog or Haziness just in the place where we stand yet the Air between the Eye and the Moon taken all together may be loaded with a greater quantity of interspersed Vapours and Exhalations than at other times  LXXII Objection answer'd  It may be Objected That in Consequence of our Principles the Interposition of a Body in some degree Opaque which may Intercept a great Part of the Rays of Light shou'd render the Appearance  of the Moon in the  Meridian  as large as when it is viewed in the  Horizon  To which I answer 'tis not Faintness any how apply'd that suggests greater Magnitude There being no necessary but only an experimental Connexion between those two things It follows that the Faintness which enlarges the Appearance must be applied in such Sort and with such Circumstances as have been observed to attend the Vision of great Magnitudes When from a Distance I speak with the Vulgar we behold great Objects the Particles of the intermediate Air and Vapours which are themselves unperceivable do interrupt the Rays of Light and thereby render the Appearance less Strong and Vivid now Faintness of Appearance caused in this Sort hath been experienced to coexist with great Magnitude But when it is caused by the Interposition of an Opaque  sensible Body this Circumstance alters the Case so that a Faint Appearance this way caused does not suggest greater Magnitude because it hath not been experienced to coexist with it  LXXIII The way wherein Faintness suggests greater Magnitude Illustrated  Faintness as well as all other  Ideas  or Perceptions which suggest Magnitude or Distance does it in the same way that Words suggest the Notions to which they are annexed Now it is known a Word pronounced with certain Circumstances or in a certain Context with other Words hath not always the same Import and Signification that it hath when pronounced in some other Circumstances or different Context of Words This well consider'd may perhaps prevent some Objections that might otherwise be made against what we have offer'd as the true Explication of the Appearance of the Horizontal Moon  LXXIV Appearance of the Horizontal Moon why thought difficult to explain  If we attentively consider the  Phaenomenon  before us we shall find the not discerning between the Mediate and Immediate Objects of Sight to be the chief Cause of the Difficulty that occurs in the Explication of it The Magnitude of the Visible Moon or that which is the proper and immediate  Object  of Vision is no greater when the Moon is in the  Horizon  than when it is in the  Meridian  How comes it therefore to seem greater in one Situation than the other What is it can put this Cheat on the Understanding It has no other Perception of the Moon than what it gets by Sight And that which is seen is of the same Extent I say the Visible Appearance hath the very same or rather a lesser Magnitude when the Moon is view'd in the  Horizontal  than when in the  Meridional  Position And yet it is Esteemed  greater in the former than in the latter Herein consists the Difficulty which doth Vanish and admit of a most easy Solution if we consider that as the Visible Moon is not greater in the  Horizon  than in the  Meridian  so neither is it thought to be so It hath been already shewn that in any act of  Vision  the Visible  Object  absolutely or in it self is little taken notice of the Mind still carrying its View from that to some  Tangible Ideas  which have been observ'd to be Connected with it and by that means come to be suggested by it So that when a thing is said to appear Great or Small or whatever Estimate be made of the Magnitude of any Thing this is meant not of the Visible but of the Tangible  Object  This duly consider'd it will be no hard matter to reconcile the seeming Contradiction there is that the Moon shou'd appear of  a different Bigness the visible Magnitude thereof remaining still the same For by  Sect  LVI the very same visible Extension with a different Faintness shall suggest a different Tangible Extension When therefore the Horizontal Moon is said to appear greater than the Meridional Moon this must be understood not of a greater  Visible  Extension but of a greater  Tangible  Extension which by reason of the more than ordinary  Faintness  of the Visible Appearance is suggested to the Mind along with it  LXXV Attempts towards the Solution of it made by several but in vain  Many Attempts have been made by Learned Men to account for this Appearance  Gassendus    Descartes    Hobbs  and several others have employ'd their Thoughts on that Subject But how fruitless and unsatisfactory their Endeavours have been is sufficiently shewn by Mr  Molyneux    vid Philos Trans  Numb    p  where you may see their several Opinions at large set forth and confuted not without some Surprize at the gross Blunders that Ingenious Men have been forced into by endeavouring to reconcile this Appearance with the ordinary Principles of  Optics  Since the Writing of which Discourse there hath been Publish'd in the Transactions  Numb    p  another Paper relating to the same Affair by the Celebrated Dr  Wallis  wherein he pretends to account for that  Phaenomenon  which tho' it seems not to contain any thing new or different from what had been said before by others I shall nevertheless consider in this place  LXXVI The Opinion of Dr  Wallis  His Opinion in short is this We judge not of the Magnitude of an  Object  by the Optic Angle alone but by the Optic Angle in Conjunction with the  Distance Hence tho' the Angle remain the same or even becomes less yet if withal the Distance seem to have been increas'd the  Object  shall appear greater Now one way whereby we estimate the Distance of any thing is by the Number and Extent of the intermediate Objects When therefore the Moon is seen in the  Horizon  the Variety of Fields Houses  c  together with the large Prospect of the wideextended Land or Sea that lies between the Eye and the utmost Limb of the  Horizon  suggest unto the Mind the  Idea  of greater Distance and consequently magnify the Appearance And this according to Dr  Wallis  is the true Account of the extraordinary Largeness attributed by the Mind to the Horizontal Moon at a time when the Angle subtended by its  Diameter  is not one jot greater than it us'd to be  LXXVII It is shewn to be unsatisfactory  With reference to this Opinion not to repeat what has been already said concerning  Distance  I shall only observe  First  That if the Prospect of interjacent Objects be that which suggests the  Idea  of farther Distance and this  Idea  of farther Distance be the Cause that brings into the Mind the  Idea  of greater Magnitude it should hence follow that if one look'd at the Horizontal Moon from behind a Wall it would appear no bigger than ordinary For in that Case the Wall interposing cuts off all that Prospect of Sea and Land  c  which might otherwise increase the apparent Distance and thereby the apparent Magnitude of the Moon Nor will it suffice to say the Memory doth even then suggest all that Extent of Land  c  which lies within the Horizon which Suggestion occasions  a sudden Judgment of Sense that the Moon is farther off and larger than usual For ask any Man who from such a Station beholding the Horizontal Moon shall think her greater than usual whether he have at that time in his Mind any  Idea  of the intermediate Objects or long Tract of Land that lies between his Eye and the extream Edge of the Horizon And whether it be that  Idea  which is the Cause of his making the aforemention'd Judgment He will without doubt reply in the Negative and declare the Horizontal Moon shall appear greater than the Meridional tho' he never thinks of all or any of those things that lie between him and it And as for the Absurdity of any  Idea  's introducing into the Mind another whilst it self is not perceiv'd this has already fallen under our Observation and is too evident to  need any farther Enlargement on it  Secondly  It seems impossible by this  Hypothesis  to account for the Moon's appearing in the very same Situation at one time greater than at another Which nevertheless has been shewn to be very agreeable to the Principles we have laid down and receives a most easie and natural Explication from them  LXXVIII How Lines and Angles may be of use in computing apparent Magnitudes  This  Phaenomenon  of the Horizontal Moon is a clear Instance of the Insufficiency of Lines and Angles for explaining the way wherein the Mind perceives and estimates the Magnitude of outward Objects There is nevertheless a use of Computation by them in order to determin the apparent Magnitude of things so far as they have a Connexion with and are Proportional to those other  Ideas  or Perceptions which are the true and immediate  Occasions that suggest to the Mind the apparent Magnitude of Things But this in general may I think be observ'd concerning Mathematical Computation in  Optics  That it can hardly be very Precise and Exact since the Judgments we make of the Magnitude of External Things do often depend on several Circumstances which are not Proportional to or capable of being defin'd by  Lines  and  Angles  LXXIX One born Blind being made to See what Judgment he'd make of Magnitude  From what has been said we may safely deduce this Consequence  viz  That a Man born Blind and made to See wou'd at first opening of his Eyes make a very different Judgment of the Magnitude of  Objects  intromitted by them from what others do He wou'd not consider the  Ideas  of Sight with reference to or as having any Connexion with the  Ideas  of  Touch His View of them being intirely terminated within themselves he can no otherwise judge them  Great  or  Small  than as they contain a greater or lesser Number of Visible Points Now it being certain that any Visible Point can cover or exclude from View only one other Visible Point it follows that whatever  Object  intercepts the View of another hath an equal Number of Visible Points with it and consequently they shall both by him be thought to have the same Magnitude Hence it's evident one in those Circumstances would judge his Thumb with which he might hide a Tower or hinder its being seen equal to that Tower or his Hand the Interposition whereof might conceal the Firmament from his View equal to the Firmament How great an Inequality soever there may in our Apprehensions seem  to be betwixt those two things because of the customary and close Connexion that has grown up in our Minds between the  Objects  of  Sight  and  Touch  whereby the very different and distinct  Ideas  of those two Senses are so blended and confounded together as to be mistaken for one and the same thing out of which Prejudice we cannot totally extricate our selves without some Labour and Striving of Thought  LXXX The  Minimum Visibile  the same to all Creatures  For the better clearing up the Nature of  Vision  and setting the manner wherein we perceive Magnitudes in a due Light I shall proceed to make some Observations concerning Matters relating thereto whereof the want of Reflexion and duly separating between  Tangible  and  Visible Ideas  is apt to create in us mistaken and confused Notions And  First  I shall observe that the  Minimum  Visibile  is exactly equal in all Beings whatsoever that are endow'd with the Visive Faculty No exquisite Formation of the Eye no peculiar Sharpness of Sight can make it less in one Creature than in another For it not being distinguishable into Parts nor in any wise consisting of them it must necessarily be the same to all For suppose it otherwise and that the  Minimum Visibile  of a Mite for Instance be less than the  Minimum Visibile  of a Man the latter therefore may by Detraction of some part be made equal to the former It doth therefore consist of Parts Which is inconsistent with the Notion of a  Minimum Visibile  or Point  LXXXI Objection answer'd  It will perhaps be objected that the  Minimum Visibile  of a Man doth really and in it self contain Parts whereby it surpasses that of a Mite tho' they are not  perceivable by the Man To which I answer the  Minimum Visibile  having in like manner as all other the Proper and Immediate  Objects  of Sight been shewn not to have any Existence without the Mind of him who sees it it follows there cannot be any part of it that is not actually perceiv'd and therefore Visible Now for any  Object  to contain several distinct visible Parts and at the same time to be a  Minimum Visibile  is a manifest Contradiction  LXXXII The Eye at all times perceives the same number of visible Points  Of these Visible Points we see at all times an equal Number It is every whit as great when our View is contracted and bounded by near  Objects  as when it is extended to larger and remoter ones For it being impossible that one  Minimum Visibile  should obscure or keep out of Sight more than one other it's a plain  Consequence that when my View is on all sides bounded by the Walls of my Study I see just as many visible Points as I cou'd in case that by the Removal of the StudyWalls and all other Obstructions I had a full Prospect of the circumjacent Fields Mountains Sea and open Firmament For so long as I am shut up within the Walls by their Interposition every Point of the External  Object  is cover'd from my View But each Point that is seen being able to cover or exclude from Sight one only other corresponding Point It follows that whilst my Sight is confin'd to those narrow Walls I see as many Points or  Minima Visibilia  as I should were those Walls away by looking on all the External  Objects  whose Prospect is intercepted by them Whenever therefore we are said to have a greater Prospect at one  time than another this must be understood with relation not to the proper and immediate but the secondary and mediate  Objects  of Vision which as hath been shewn do properly belong to the  Touch  LXXXIII Two Imperfections in the  Visive Faculty  The  Visive Faculty  consider'd with reference to it's immediate  Objects  may be found to Labour of two Defects  First  In respect of the Extent or Number of visible Points that are at once perceivable by it which is narrow and limited to a certain Degree It can take in at one View but a certain determinate Number of  Minima Visibilia  beyond which it cannot extend it's Prospect  Secondly  Our Sight is defective in that its View is not only narrow but also for the most part confus'd Of those things that we take in at one Prospect we can see but a few  at once clearly and unconfusedly And the more we fix our Sight on any one  Object  by so much the Darker and more Indistinct shall the rest appear  LXXXIV Answering to which we may conceive two Perfections  Corresponding to these two Defects of Sight we may imagine as many Perfections  viz    st  That of comprehending in one View a greater number of Visible Points  dly  Of being able to View them all equally and at once with the utmost Clearness and Distinction That these Perfections are not actually in some Intelligences of a different Order and Capacity from ours it is impossible for us to know  LXXXV In neither of these two Ways do Microscopes improve the Sight  In neither of these two Ways do  Microscopes  contribute to the improvement of Sight For when we look thro' a  Microscope  we neither see more Visible Points nor are the Collateral Points more Distinct  than when we look with the naked Eye at  Objects  placed in a due Distance A  Microscope  brings us as it were into a new World It presents us with a new Scene of Visible  Objects  quite different from what we behold with the naked Eye But herein consists the most remarkable Difference  viz  That whereas the  Objects  perceived by the Eye alone have a certain Connexion with  Tangible Objects  whereby we are taught to Foresee what will ensue upon the Approach or Application of distant  Objects  to the Parts of our own Body which much conduceth to it's Preservation there is not the like Connexion between things  Tangible  and those Visible  Objects  that are perceiv'd by help of a fine  Microscope  LXXXVI The Case of Microscopical Eyes consider'd  Hence it's evident that were our Eyes turned into the Nature of  Microscopes  we shou'd not be much  benefited by the Change We shou'd be depriv'd of the foremention'd Advantage we at present receive by the  Visive  Faculty and have left us only the empty Amusement of  Seeing  without any other benefit arising from it But in that Case it will perhaps be said our Sight wou'd be endued with a far greater Sharpness and Penetration than it now hath But I wou'd fain know wherein consists that  Sharpness  which is esteem'd so great an Excellency of Sight It is certain from what we have already shewn that the  Minimum Visibile  is never Greater or Lesser but in all Cases constantly the same And in the Case of Microscopical Eyes I see only this difference  viz  that upon the Ceasing of a certain observable Connexion betwixt the divers Perceptions of  Sight  and  Touch  which before enabled us to regulate our Actions by the Eye It wou'd  now be render'd utterly unserviceable to that Purpose Which whether it be a desirable Perfection or no I leave it to any one to determin  LXXXVII The Sight admirably adapted to the ends of Seeing  Upon the whole my Opinion is That if we consider the Use and End of  Sight  together with the present State and Circumstances of our Being we shall not find any great Cause to complain of any Defect or Imperfection in it or easily conceive how it cou'd be mended With such admirable Wisdom is that Faculty contriv'd both for the Pleasure and Conveniency of Life  LXXXVIII Difficulty concerning Erect Vision  Having finish'd what I intended to say concerning the  Distance  and  Magnitude  of  Objects  I come now to treat of the Manner wherein the Mind perceives by Sight their  Situation  Among the Discoveries of the last Age it is reputed none of the  least that the manner of  Vision  has been more clearly Explain'd than ever it had been before There is at this Day no one Ignorant that the Pictures of External  Objects  are Painted on the  Retina  or Fund of the Eye That we can see no thing which is not so Painted And that according as the Picture is more Distinct or Confused so also is the Perception we have of the  Object  But then in this Explication of  Vision  there occurs one mighty Difficulty The  Objects  are Painted in an inverted Order on the Bottom of the Eye The  upper  part of any  Object  being Painted on the  lower  part of the  Eye  and the  lower  part of the  Object  on the  upper  part of the  Eye  And so also as to  Right  and  Left  Since therefore the Pictures are thus inverted it is demanded how it comes to pass that we see the  Objects  erect and in their natural Posture  LXXXIX The common way of explaining it  In answer to this Difficulty we are told that the Mind perceiving an impulse of a Ray of Light on the upper part of the Eye considers this Ray as coming in a direct Line from the lower part of the  Object  and in like manner tracing the Ray that strikes on the lower part of the Eye it is directed to the upper part of the  Object  Thus in the adjacent Figure  C  the lower Point of the  Object ABC  is projected on  c  the upper part of the Eye So likewise  the highest Point A is projected on  a  the lowest part of the Eye which makes the Representation  cba  inverted But the Mind considering the Stroak that is made on  c  as coming in the  straight Line  C c  from the lower End of the  Object  and the Stroak or Impulse on  a  as coming in the Line  Aa  from the upper End of the  Object  is directed to make a right Judgement of the Situation of the  Object ABC  notwithstanding the Picture of it be inverted Moreover this is illustrated by conceiving a Blind Man who holding in his Hands two Sticks that cross each other doth with them touch the extremities of an  Object  placed in a perpendicular Situation It is certain this Man will judge that to be the upper part of the  Object  which he touches with the Stick held in the undermost Hand and that to be the lower part of the  Object  which he touches with the Stick in his uppermost Hand This is the common Explication of the erect Appearance of  Objects  which is generally receiv'd and acquiesed in being as Mr  Molyneux  tells us  Dioptr par    c    p    allowed by all Men as Satisfactory  XC The same shewn to be false  But how reasonable and satisfactory soever this account may be thought by others to me certainly it does not seem in any degree True Did I perceive those Impulses Decussations and Directions of the Rays of Light in like manner as hath been set forth then indeed it wou'd not at first view be altogether void of Probability And there might be some Pretence for the Comparison of the BlindMan and his cross Sticks But the Case is far otherwise I know very well that I perceive no such thing And of Consequence I cannot thereby make an Estimate of the Situation of  Objects  Moreover I appeal to any one's Experience whether he be conscious to himself that he thinks on the Intersection made by the Radious Pencils or pursue the Impulses  they give in right Lines whenever he perceives by Sight the Position of any  Object  To me it seems evident that Crossing and Tracing of the Rays  c  is never thought on by Children Idiots or in Truth by any other save only those who have applyed themselves to the Study of  Optics  And for the Mind to judge of the Situation of  Objects  by those things without perceiving them or to perceive them without knowing it take which you please 'tis Perfectly beyond my Comprehension Add to this that the explaining the manner of  Vision  by the Example of cross Sticks and Hunting for the  Object  along the Axes of the Radious Pencils doth suppose the proper  Objects  of Sight to be perceived at a Distance from us contrary to what hath been Demonstrated We may therefore venture to pronounce this Opinion concerning the way wherein  the Mind perceives the Erect Appearance of  Objects  to be of a Piece with those other Tenents of Writers in  Optics  which in the foregoing Parts of this Treatise we have had occasion to Examine and Refute  XCI Not distinguishing between  Ideas  of Sight and Touch Cause of Mistake in this Matter  It remains therefore that we look for some other Explication of this Difficulty And I believe it not impossible to find one provided we Examine it to the Bottom and carefully distinguish between the  Ideas  of  Sight  and  Touch  which cannot be too oft inculcated in treating of  Vision  But more especially throughout the consideration of this Affair we ought to carry that Distinction in our Thoughts For that from want of a right Understanding thereof the Difficulty of Explaining  Erect Vision  seems chiefly to arise  XCII The Case of one Born Blind proper to be consider'd  But in order to Disentangle our Minds from whatever Prejudices we may entertain with relation to the Subject in hand Nothing seems more apposite than the taking into our Thoughts the Case of one Born Blind and afterwards when grown up made to see And tho' perhaps it may not be a Task altogether easy and familiar to us to divest our selves intirely of the Experiences receiv'd from Sight So as to be able to put our Thoughts exactly in the Posture of such a one's We must nevertheless as far as possible endeavour to frame true Conceptions of what might reasonably be supposed to pass in his Mind  XCIII Such a one might by Touch attain to have  Ideas  of  Upper  and  Lower  It is certain that a Man actually Blind and who had continued so from his Birth wou'd by the Sense of Feeling attain to have  Ideas  of  Upper  and  Lower  By  the Motion of his Hand he might discern the Situation of any Tangible  Object  placed within his Reach That part on which he felt himself supported or towards which he perceiv'd his Body to gravitate he wou'd term  Lower  and the contrary to this  Upper  And accordingly denominate whatsoever  Objects  he touch'd  XCIV Which Modes of Situation he'd attribute only to things Tangible  But then whatever Judgments he makes concerning the Situation of  Objects  are confin'd to those only that are perceivable by  Touch  All those things that are intangible and of a spiritual Nature his Thoughts and Desires his Passions and in general all the Modifications of his Soul to these he wou'd never apply the Terms  Upper  and  Lower  except only in a Metaphorical Sense He may perhaps by way of Allusion speak of High or Low Thoughts But those Terms in their proper Signification  wou'd never be applyed to any thing that was not conceiv'd to exist without the Mind For a Man Born Blind and remaining in the same State cou'd mean nothing else by the Words  Higher  and  Lower  than a greater or lesser Distance from the Earth Which Distance he wou'd measure by the Motion or Application of his Hand or some other Part of his Body It is therefore evident that all those things which in respect of each other wou'd by him be thought Higher or Lower must be such as were conceiv'd to exist without his Mind in the ambient Space  XCV He'd not at first Sight think any thing he saw High or Low Erect or Inverted  Whence it plainly follows that such a one if we suppose him made to See wou'd not at first Sight think that any thing he saw was High or Low Erect or Inverted for it hath been already Demonstrated in  Sect  XLI that  he wou'd not think the Things he perceived by Sight to be at any Distance from him or without his Mind The Objects to which he had hitherto been used to apply the Terms  Up  and  Down    High  and  Low  were such only as affected or were some way perceiv'd by his Touch But the proper Objects of  Vision  make a new Set of  Ideas  perfectly distinct and different from the former and which can in no sort make themselves perceiv'd by  Touch  There is therefore nothing at all that cou'd induce him to think those Terms applicable to them Nor wou'd he ever think it till such time as he had observ'd their Connexion with Tangible Objects and the same Prejudice begin to insinuate it self into his Understanding which from their Infancy had grown up in the Understandings of other Men  XCVI This Illustrated by an Example  To set this Matter in a clearer Light I shall make use of an Example Suppose the abovementioned Blind Person do by his Touch perceive a Man to stand Erect Let us enquire into the manner of this By the application of his Hand to the several Parts of a Human Body he had perceiv'd different Tangible  Ideas  which being collected into sundry complex ones have distinct Names annexed to them Thus one Combination of a certain Tangible Figure Bulk and Consistency of Parts is called the  Head  another the  Hand  a Third the  Foot  and so of the rest All which Complex  Ideas  cou'd in his Understanding be made up only of  Ideas  perceivable by Touch He had also by his Touch obtain'd an  Idea  of Earth or Ground towards which he perceives the Parts of his Body to have a natural Tendency  Now by  Erect  nothing more being meant than that perpendicular Position of a Man wherein his Feet are nearest to the Earth If the Blind Person by moving his Hand over the Parts of the Man who stands before him do perceive the Tangible  Ideas  that compose the Head to be farthest from and those that compose the Feet to be nearest to that other Combination of Tangible  Ideas  which he calls  Earth  He will denominate that Man  Erect  But if we suppose him on a sudden to receive his Sight and that he behold a Man standing before him It's evident in that Case he wou'd neither judge the Man he sees to be  Erect  nor  Inverted  for he never having known those Terms applied to any other save Tangible Things or which existed in the Space without him and what he sees neither being Tangible nor perceived as existing without he cou'd  not know that in propriety of Language they were applicable to it  XCVII By what means he'd come to denominate Visible  Objects  high or low c  Afterwards when upon turning his Head or Eyes up and down to the right and left he shall observe the Visible Objects to change and shall also attain to know that they are call'd by the same Names and Connected with the Objects perceiv'd by Touch then indeed he will come to speak of them and their Situation in the the same Terms that he has been us'd to apply to Tangible Things And those that he perceives by turning up his Eyes he will call  Upper  and those that by turning down his Eyes he will call  Lower  XCVIII Why he shou'd think those  Objects  highest which are Painted on the lowest part of his Eye and  vice versa  And this seems to me the true Reason why he shou'd think those Objects uppermost that are Painted on the lower part of his Eye For by turning the Eye  up  they shall be distinctly seen as likewise  they that are Painted on the highest part of the Eye shall be distinctly seen by turning the Eye  down  and are for that Reason esteemed lowest For we have shewn that to the immediate Objects of Sight consider'd in themselves he'd not attribute the Terms  High  and  Low  It must therefore be on account of some Circumstances which are observ'd to attend them And these 'tis plain are the Actions of turning the Eye up and down which suggest a very obvious Reason why the Mind shou'd denominate the Objects of Sight accordingly  High  or  Low  And without this Motion of the Eye this turning it up and down in order to discern different Objects doubtless  Erect    Inverse  and other the like Terms relating to the Position of Tangible Objects wou'd never have been transfer'd or in any degree apprehended to belong to the  Ideas  of Sight The meer  act of Seeing including nothing in it to that Purpose whereas the different Situations of the Eye naturally direct the Mind to make a suitable Judgement of the Situation of  Objects  intromitted by it  XCIX How he wou'd perceive by Sight the Situation of External Objects  Farther when he has by Experience learn'd the Connexion there is between the several  Ideas  of Sight and Touch he will be able by the Perception he has of the Situation of Visible Things in respect of one another to make a sudden and true Estimate of the Situation of Outward Tangible things corresponding to them And thus it is he shall perceive by Sight the Situation of External  Objects  which do not properly fall under that Sense  C Our propension to think the contrary no Argument against what hath been said  I know we are very prone to think that if just made to see we shou'd judge of the Situation of Visible Things as we do now  But we are also as prone to think that at first Sight we shou'd in the same way apprehend the Distance and Magnitude of Objects as we do now Which hath been shewn to be a false and groundless Perswasion And for the like Reasons the same Censure may be past on the positive Assurance that most Men before they have thought sufficiently of the Matter might have of their being able to determine by the Eye at first view whether  Objects  were  Erect  or  Inverse  CI Objection  It will perhaps be objected to our Opinion that a Man for instance being thought Erect when his Feet are next the Earth and inverted when his Head is next the Earth it doth hence follow that by the meer act of Vision without any Experience or altering the Situation of the Eye we shou'd have determined whether he were Erect or Inverted For  both the Earth it self and the Limbs of the Man who stands thereon being equally perceiv'd by Sight One cannot chuse seeing what part of the Man is nearest the Earth and what part farthest from it  i e  whether he be Erect or Inverted  CII Answer  To which I answer the  Ideas  which constitute the Tangible Earth and Man are intirely different from those which constitute the Visible Earth and Man Nor was it possible by virtue of the Visive Faculty alone without superadding any Experience of  Touch  or altering the Position of the Eye ever to have known or so much as suspected there had been any Relation or Connexion between them Hence a Man at first view wou'd not denominate any thing he saw  Earth  or  Head  or  Foot  And consequently he cou'd not tell by the meer act of  Vision  whether  the Head or Feet were nearest the Earth Nor indeed wou'd he have thereby any thought of  Earth  or  Man    Erect  or  Inverse  at all Which will be made yet more evident if we nicely observe and make a particular Comparison between the  Ideas  of both Senses  CIII An Object cou'd not be known at first Sight by the Colour  That which I see is only variety of Light and Colours That which I feel is Hard or Soft Hot or Cold Rough or Smooth What Similitude what Connexion have those  Ideas  with these Or how is it possible that any one shou'd see reason to give one and the same Name to combinations of  Ideas  so very different before ever he had experienced their Coexistence We do not find there is any necessary Connexion betwixt this or that Tangible Quality and any Colour whatsoever And we may sometimes perceive Colours where there is nothing to be felt  All which doth make it manifest that no Man at first receiving of his Sight wou'd know there was any Agreement between this or that particular  Object  of his Sight and any  Object  of Touch he had been already acquainted with The Colours therefore of the Head wou'd to him no more suggest the  Idea  of  Head  than they wou'd the  Idea  of  Feet  CIV Nor by the Magnitude thereof  Farther we have at large shewn  vid Sect  LXIII and LXIV there is no discoverable necessary Connexion between any given Visible Magnitude and any one particular Tangible Magnitude But that it is intirely the result of Custom and Experience and depends on foreign and accidental Circumstances that we can by the Perception of Visible Extension inform our selves what may be the Extension of any  Tangible Object  connected therewith Hence  'tis certain that neither the Visible Magnitude of Head or Foot wou'd bring along with them into the Mind at first opening of the Eyes the respective Tangible Magnitudes of those Parts  CV Nor by the Figure  By the foregoing  Section  'tis plain the Visible Figure of any Part of the Body hath no necessary Connexion with the Tangible Figure thereof so as at first Sight to suggest it to the Mind For  Figure  is the Termination of Magnitude Whence it follows that no Visible Magnitude having in it's own Nature an aptness to suggest any one particular Tangible Magnitude so neither can any Visible Figure be inseparably Connected with its corresponding Tangible Figure So as of it self and in a way  prior  to Experience it might suggest it to the Understanding This will be farther evident if we consider that what seems Smooth and Round  to the Touch may to Sight if view'd thro' a  Microscope  seem quite otherwise  CVI In the first act of Vision no Tangible Thing wou'd be suggested by Sight  From all which laid together and duly consider'd we may clearly deduce this Inference  viz  In the first act of Vision no  Idea  entering by the Eye wou'd have a perceivable Connexion with the  Ideas  to which the Names  Earth    Man    Head    Foot  c were annexed in the Understanding of a Person Blind from his Birth So as in any sort to introduce them into his Mind or make themselves be called by the same Names and reputed the same things with them as afterwards they come to be  CVII Difficulty proposed concerning Number  There doth nevertheless remain one Difficulty which to some perhaps may seem to press hard on our Opinion and deserve not to be pass'd over For tho' it be granted that neither the Colour  Size nor Figure of the Visible Feet have any necessary Connexion with the  Ideas  that compose the Tangible Feet so as to bring them at first sight into my Mind or make me in danger of confounding them before I had been us'd to and for some time experienced their Connexion Yet thus much seems undeniable Namely that the Number of the Visible Feet being the same with that of the Tangible Feet I may from hence without any Experience of Sight reasonably conclude that they represent or are connected with the Feet rather than the Head I say it seems the  Idea  of  Two  Visible Feet will sooner suggest to the Mind the  Idea  of  Two  Tangible Feet than of  one  Head So that the Blind Man upon first reception of the Visive Faculty might know which were the Feet or Two and which the Head or One  CVIII Number of things Visible wou'd not at first Sight suggest the like number of things Tangible  In order to get clear of this seeming Difficulty we need only observe that Diversity of Visible Objects does not necessarily infer Diversity of Tangible Objects corresponding to them A Picture Painted with great variety of Colours affects the Touch in one uniform manner It is therefore evident that I do not by any necessary Consecution independent of Experience judge of the number of things Tangible from the number of things Visible I shou'd not therefore at first opening my Eyes conclude that because I see Two I shall feel Two How therefore can I before Experience teaches me know that the Visible Legs because  Two  are connected with the Tangible Legs Or the Visible Head because  One  connected with the Tangible Head The Truth on't is the things I see are so very different and heterogeneous  from the things I feel That the Perception of the one wou'd never have suggested the other to my Thoughts or enabled me to pass the least Judgment thereon until I had Experienced their Connexion  CIX Number the Creature of the Mind  But for a fuller Illustration of this Matter it ought to be consider'd that  Number  however some may reckon it amongst the Primary Qualities is nothing fix'd and settled really existing in things themselves It is intirely the Creature of the Mind considering either a Simple  Idea  by it self or any Combination of Simple  Ideas  to which it gives one Name and so makes it pass for an Unite According as the Mind variously Combines it's  Ideas  the Unite varies And as the Unite so the Number which is only a Collection of Unites doth also vary We call a Window  one  a Chimney  one  and yet a House  in which there are many Windows and many Chimneys has an equal right to be called  one  And many Houses go to the making of  one  City In these and the like Instances it's evident the  Unite  constantly relates to the particular Draughts the Mind makes of it's  Ideas  to which it affixes Names and wherein it includes more or less as best suits it's own Ends and Purposes Whatever therefore the Mind considers as one that is an Unite Every Combination of  Ideas  is consider'd as one thing by the Mind and in token thereof is mark'd by one Name Now this Naming and Combining together of  Ideas  is perfectly Arbitrary and done by the Mind in such sort as Experience shews it to be most convenient Without which our  Ideas  had never been collected into such sundry distinct Combinations as they now are  CX One Born Blind wou'd not at first Sight number Visible Things as others do  Hence it follows that a Man Born Blind and afterwards when grown up made to see wou'd not in the first act of Vision parcel out the  Ideas  of Sight into the same distinct Collections that others do who have experienced which do regularly coexist and are proper to be bundled up together under one Name He wou'd not for Example make into one Complex  Idea  and thereby esteem an unite all those particular  Ideas  which constitute the Visible Head or Foot For there can be no Reason assign'd why he shou'd do so barely upon his seeing a Man stand upright before him There croud into his Mind the  Ideas  which compose the Visible Man in company with all the other  Ideas  of Sight perceiv'd at the same time But all these  Ideas  offer'd at once to his View he'd not distribute into sundry distinct  Combinations till such time as by observing the Motion of the Parts of the Man and other Experiences he comes to know which are to be separated and which to be collected together  CXI The Situation of any Object determin'd with respect only to Objects of the same Sense  From what hath been premised 'tis plain the Objects of Sight and Touch make if I may so say two Sets of  Ideas  which are widely different from each other To Objects of either Kind we indifferently attribute the Terms  High  and  Low    Right  and  Left  and such like denoting the Position or Situation of things But then we must well observe that the Position of any  Object  is determin'd with respect only to  Objects  of the same Sense We say any  Object  of Touch is  High  or  Low  according as it is more or less distant from the Tangible Earth And in like manner we denominate any  Object  of Sight  High  or  Low  in proportion as it is more or less Distant from the Visible Earth But to define the Situation of Visible Things with relation to the Distance they bear from any Tangible Thing or  vice versa  This were absurd and perfectly unintelligible For all Visible Things are equally in the Mind and take up no part of the External Space And consequently are Equidistant from any Tangible Thing which exists without the Mind  CXII No Distance great or small between a Visible and Tangible Thing  Or rather to speak truly the proper  Objects  of Sight are at no Distance neither near nor far from any Tangible Thing For if we inquire narrowly into the Matter we shall find that those things only are compar'd together in respect of Distance which exist after the same manner or appertain unto the same Sense For by the  Distance  between any Two  Points nothing more is meant than the Number of intermediate Points If the given Points are Visible the Distance between them is mark'd out by the Number of the interjacent Visible Points If they are Tangible the Distance between them is a Line consisting of Tangible Points But if they are one Tangible and the other Visible the Distance between them doth neither consist of Points perceivable by Sight nor by Touch  i e  it is utterly inconceivable This perhaps will not find an easy Admission into all Men's Understandings However I shou'd gladly be informed whether it be not True by any one who will be at the pains to Reflect a little and apply it home to his Thoughts  CXII The not observing this cause of difficulty in Erect Vision  The not observing what has been deliver'd in the two last  Sections  seems to have occasion'd no small  part of the Difficulty that occurs in the Business of  Erect Appearances  The Head which is Painted nearest the Earth seems to be farthest from it and on the other Hand the Feet which are Painted farthest from the Earth are thought nearest to it Herein lies the Difficulty which vanishes if we express the thing more clearly and free from Ambiguity thus How comes it that to the Eye the Visible Head which is nearest the Tangible Earth seems farthest from the Earth and the Visible Feet which are farthest from the Tangible Earth seem nearest the Earth The Question being thus propos'd who sees not the Difficulty is founded on a Supposition that the Eye or Visive Faculty or rather the Soul by means thereof shou'd judge of the Situation of Visible Objects with Reference to their Distance from the Tangible Earth Whereas it's evident  the Tangible Earth is not perceiv'd by Sight And it hath been shewn in the two last preceding  Sections  that the Location of Visible Objects is determin'd only by the Distance they bear from one another and that it is Nonsense to talk of Distance far or near between a Visible and Tangible Thing  CXIV Which otherwise includes nothing unaccountable  If we confine our Thoughts to the proper Objects of Sight the whole is plain and easy The Head is Painted farthest from and the Feet nearest to the Visible Earth And so they appear to be What is there strange or unaccountable in this Let us suppose the Pictures in the Fund of the Eye to be the immediate Objects of Sight The Consequence is that things shou'd appear in the same Posture they are Painted in And is it not so The Head which is seen seems farthest from the Earth which  is seen and the Feet which are seen seem nearest to the Earth which is seen And just so they are Painted  CXV What is meant by the Pictures being inverted  But say you the Picture of the Man is  inverted  and yet the Appearance is  Erect  I ask what mean you by the Picture of the Man or which is the same thing the Visible Man's being inverted You tell me 'tis inverted because the Heels are uppermost and the Head undermost Explain me this You say that by the Head's being undermost you mean that it is nearest to the Earth and by the Heels being uppermost that they are farthest from the Earth I ask again what Earth you mean You cannot mean the Earth that is Painted on the Eye or the Visible Earth For the Picture of the Head is farthest from the Picture of the Earth and the Picture of the Feet nearest to the Picture  of the Earth and accordingly the Visible Head is farthest from the Visible Earth and the Visible Feet nearest to it It remains therefore that you mean the Tangible Earth And so determine the Situation of  Visible  Things with respect to  Tangible  Things contrary to what hath been demonstrated in  Sect  CXI and CXII The two distinct Provinces of  Sight  and  Touch  shou'd be consider'd apart and as tho' their  Objects  had no Intercourse no manner of Relation to one another in point of Distance or Position  CXVI Cause of Mistake in this Matter  Farther What greatly contributes to make us mistake in this Matter is that when we think of the Pictures in the Fund of the Eye we imagine our selves looking on the Fund of another's Eye or another looking on the Fund of our own Eye and beholding the Pictures Painted thereon Suppose  two Eyes  A  and  B A  from some distance looking on the Pictures in  B  sees them inverted and for that reason concludes they are inverted in  B  But this is wrong There are projected in  little  on the Bottom of  A  the Images of the Pictures of suppose  Man    Earth  c which are Painted on  B  And besides these the Eye  B  it self and the  Objects  which environ it together with another Earth are projected in a larger Size on  A  Now by the Eye  A  these larger Images are deemed the  true Objects  and the lesser only  Pictures  in miniature And it is with respect to those greater Images that it determines the Situation of the smaller Images So that comparing the little Man with the great Earth  A  judges him inverted or that the Feet are farthest from and the Head nearest to the great Earth Whereas if  A  compare the little Man with the  little Earth then he will appear Erect  i e  his Head shall seem farthest from and his Feet nearest to the little Earth But we must consider that  B  does not see two Earths as  A  does It sees only what is represented by the little Pictures in  A  and consequently shall judge the Man  Erect  For in truth the Man in  B  is not inverted for there the Feet are next the Earth But it is the Representation of it in  A  which is inverted for there the Head of the Representation of the Picture of the Man in  B  is next the Earth and the Feet farthest from the Earth meaning the Earth which is without the Representation of the Pictures in  B  For if you take the little Images of the Pictures in  B  and consider them by themselves and with respect only to one another they are all  Erect  and in their natural Posture  CXVII Images in the Eye not Pictures of external Objects  Farther there lies a Mistake in our imagining that the Pictures of External  Objects  are Painted on the Bottom of the Eye It hath been shewn there is no resemblance between the  Ideas  of Sight and things Tangible It hath likewise been demonstrated that the proper  Objects  of Sight do not exist without the Mind Whence it clearly follows that the Pictures Painted on the Bottom of the Eye are not the Pictures of External  Objects  Let any one consult his own Thoughts and then tell me what Affinity what Likeness there is between that certain Variety and Disposition of Colours which constitute the Visible Man or Picture of a Man and that other Combination of far different  Ideas  sensible by Touch which compose the Tangible Man But if this be the Case how come they to be accounted  Pictures  or  Images  since  that supposes them to copy or represent some Originals or other  CXVIII In what Sense they are Pictures  To which I answer In the foremention'd Instance the Eye  A  takes the little Images included within the Representation of the other Eye  B  to be Pictures or Copies whereof the  Archetypes  are not things existing without but the larger Pictures projected on it's own Fund And which by  A  are not thought Pictures but the Originals or true Things themselves Tho' if we suppose a third Eye  C  from a due distance to behold the Fund of  A  Then indeed the things projected thereon shall to  C  seem Pictures or Images in the same Sense that those projected on  B  do to  A  CXIX In this Affair we must carefully distinguish between Ideas of Sight and Touch  Rightly to conceive the Business in hand we must carefully distinguish between the  Ideas  of  Sight  and  Touch  between the Visible and Tangible Eye for certainly on the Tangible Eye nothing either is or seems to be Painted Again the Visible Eye as well as all other Visible Objects hath been shewn to exist only in the Mind which perceiving its own  Ideas  and comparing them together doth call some Pictures in respect of others What hath been said being rightly comprehended and laid together does I think afford a full and genuine Explication of the Erect Appearance of Objects which  Phaenomenon  I must confess I do not see how it can be explain'd by any  Theories  of  Vision  hitherto made publick  CXX Difficult to explain by Words the true  Theory  of  Vision  In treating of these things the use of Language is apt to occasion some Obscurity and Confusion and create in us wrong  Ideas  For Language being accomodated  to the common Notions and Prejudices of Men it is scarce possible to deliver the naked and precise Truth without great Circumlocution Impropriety and to an unwary Reader seeming Contradictions I do therefore once for all desire whoever shall think it worth his while to understand what I have written concerning  Vision  that he'd not stick in this or that Phrase or manner of Expression but candidly collect my meaning from the whole Sum and Tenor of my Discourse and laying aside the Words as much as possible consider the bare Notions themselves and then judge whether they are agreeable to Truth and his own Experience or no  CXXI The Question whether there is any Idea common to  Sight  and  Touch  stated  We have shewn the way wherein the Mind by Mediation of Visible  Ideas  doth perceive or apprehend the  Distance    Magnitude  and  Situation  of Tangible Objects I come now to enquire more particularly concerning the Difference betwixt the  Ideas  of  Sight  and  Touch  which are call'd by the same Names and see whether there be any  Idea  common to both Senses From what we have at large set forth and demonstrated in the foregoing parts of this Treatise 'tis plain there's no one selfsame numerical Extension perceiv'd both by Sight and Touch But that the particular Figures and Extensions perceiv'd by Sight however they may be called by the same Names and reputed the same Things with those perceiv'd by Touch are nevertheless different and have an Existence very distinct and Separate from them So that the Question is not now concerning the same numerical  Ideas  but whether there be any one and the same sort or  Species  of  Ideas  equally  perceivable to both Senses Or in other Words whether Extension Figure and Motion perceiv'd by Sight are not specifically distinct from Extension Figure and Motion perceived by Touch  CXXII Abstract Extension enquir'd into  But before I come more particularly to Discuss this Matter I find it proper to take into my Thoughts Extension in  Abstract  For of this there is much talk and I am apt to think that when Men speak of  Extension  as being an  Idea  common to Two Senses it is with a secret Supposition that we can single out Extension from all other Tangible and Visible Qualities and frame thereof an Abstract  Idea  which  Idea  they will have common both to Sight and Touch We are therefore to understand by  Extension in Abstract  an  Idea  of Extension  v g  a Line or Surface intirely stript of all other sensible  Qualities and Circumstances that might determine it to any particular Existence It is neither Black nor White nor Red nor hath it any Colour at all or any Tangible Quality whatsoever And consequently it is of no finite determinate Magnitude For that which bounds or distinguishes one Extension from another is some Quality or Circumstance wherein they disagree  CXXIII It is incomprehensible  Now I do not find that I can perceive imagine or any wise frame in my Mind such an abstract  Idea  as is here spoken of A Line or Surface which is neither Black nor White nor Blue nor Yellow  c  Nor Long nor Short nor Rough nor Smooth nor Square nor Round  c  is perfectly incomprehensible This I am sure of as to my self how far the Faculties of other Men may reach they best can tell  CXXIV Abstract Extension not the Object of Geometry  I know 'tis commonly said that the  Object  of  Geometry  is Abstract Extension To this I cannot agree for  Geometry  contemplates Figures Now Figure is the Termination of Magnitude but we have shewn that Extension in Abstract hath no finite determinate Magnitude whence it clearly follows that it can have no Figure and consequently is not the  Object  of  Geometry  I know it is a Tenent as well of the Modern as the Ancient Philosophers that all general Truths are concerning Universal Abstract  Ideas  without which we are told there cou'd be no Science no Demonstration of any general Proposition in  Geometry  But it were no hard matter did I think it necessary to my present Purpose to shew that Propositions and Demonstrations in  Geometry  might be Universal tho' they who make 'em  never think of Abstract general  Ideas  of Triangles or Circles  CXV The general Idea of a Triangle consider'd  After reiterated Efforts and pangs of Thought in order to apprehend the general  Idea  of  v g  a Triangle I have found it altogether incomprehensible And surely if any one were able to let that  Idea  into my Mind it must be the deservedly admir'd Author of the Essay  concerning Human Understanding  He who has so far distinguish'd himself from the generality of Writers by the Clearness and Significancy of what he Says Let us therefore see how that great Man describes the general or which is the same thing the Abstract  Idea  of a Triangle  It must be  says he  neither Oblique nor Rectangle neither Equilateral Equicrural nor Scalenon but  all and none  of these at once In effect it is somewhat imperfect that cannot exist  an  Idea  wherein some Parts of several different and inconsistent  Ideas  are put together  Essay on Hum Understand b  iv  c    s    This is the  Idea  which he thinks needful for the enlargement of Knowledge which is the Subject of Mathematical Demonstration and without which we cou'd never come to know any general Proposition concerning Triangles Sure I am if this be the Case 'tis impossible for me to attain to know even the first Elements of  Geometry  Since I have not the Faculty to frame in my Mind such an  Idea  as is here describ'd That Author acknowledges it doth  require some Pains and Skill to Form this general  Idea  of a Triangle  ibid  But had he call'd to mind what he says in another place  viz  that  Ideas  of mix'd Modes wherein any inconsistent  Ideas  are put together cannot so much as exist in the Mind  i e  be conceiv'd  vid b  iii  c    s    ibid  I say had this occur'd to his Thoughts 'tis not improbable he'd have own'd it above all the Pains and Skill he was Master of to form the abovemention'd  Idea  of a Triangle which is made up of manifest staring Contradictions That a Man of such a clear Understanding who thought so much and so well and laid so great a Stress on Clear and Determinate  Ideas  shou'd nevertheless talk at this rate seems very surprising But my Wonder is lessen'd when I consider that the Source whence this Opinion of Abstract Figures and Extension flows is the prolific Womb which has brought forth innumerable Errors and Difficulties in all Parts of Philosophy and in all the Sciences But this Matter taken in its full Extent were a Subject too vast and comprehensive to be insisted on in this place I shall only observe that your Metaphysicians  and Men of Speculation seem to have Faculties distinct from those of ordinary Men when they talk of General or Abstracted Triangles and Circles  c  and so peremptorily declare them to be the Subject of all the Eternal Immutable Universal Truths in  Geometry  And so much for Extension in  Abstract  CXXVI Vacuum or pure Space not common to Sight and Touch  Some perhaps may think pure Space  Vacuum  or Trine Dimension to be equally the  Object  of Sight and Touch But tho' we have a very great Propension to think the  Ideas  of Outness and Space to be the immediate  Object  of Sight yet if I mistake not in the foregoing Parts of this Essay That hath been clearly Demonstrated to be a meer Delusion arising from the quick and sudden Suggestion of Fancy which so closely Connects the  Idea  of Distance with those of Sight that we are apt to think it is it self  a proper and immediate  Object  of that Sense till Reason corrects the Mistake  CXXVII There is no Idea or kind of Idea common to both Senses  It having been shewn that there are no Abstract  Ideas  of Figure and that it is impossible for us by any Precision of Thought to frame an  Idea  of Extension separate from all other Visible and Tangible Qualities which shall be common both to Sight and Touch The Question now remaining is whether the particular Extensions Figures and Motions perceiv'd by Sight be of the same Kind with the particular Extensions Figures and Motions perceiv'd by Touch In answer to which I shall venture to lay down the following Proposition  viz The Extension Figures and Motions perceiv'd by Sight are specifically Distinct from the  Ideas  of Touch called by the same Names nor is there any such thing as an  Idea  or kind of  Idea  common to  both Senses  This Proposition may without much Difficulty be collected from what hath been said in several Places of this Essay But because it seems so remote from and contrary to the receiv'd Notions and settled Opinion of Mankind I shall attempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the following Arguments  CXXVIII First Argument in Proof hereof  First  When upon Perception of an  Idea  I range it under this or that sort it is because it's perceiv'd after the same manner or because it has a Likeness or Conformity with or affects me in the same way as the  Ideas  of the sort I rank it under In short it must not be intirely new but have something in it Old and already perceiv'd by me It must I say have so much at least in common with the  Ideas  I have before known and nam'd as to make me give it the same Name with them  But it has been if I mistake not clearly made out that a Man Born Blind wou'd not at first reception of his Sight think the things he saw were of the same Nature with the  Objects  of Touch or had any thing in common with them but that they were a new Set of  Ideas  perceiv'd in a new manner and intirely different from all he had ever perceiv'd before So that he wou'd not call them by the same Name nor repute them to be of the same Sort with any thing he had hitherto known And surely the Judgment of such an unprejudic'd Person is more to be relied on in this Case than the Sentiments of the generality of Men Who in this as in almost every thing else suffer themselves to be guided by Custom and the erroneous Suggestions of Prejudice rather than Reason and sedate Reflexion  CXXIX Second Argument  Secondly  Light and Colours are allow'd by all to constitute a Sort or  Species  intirely different from the  Ideas  of Touch Nor will any Man I presume say they can make themselves perceiv'd by that Sense But there is no other immediate  Object  of Sight besides Light and Colours It is therefore a direct Consequence that there is no  Idea  common to both Senses  CXXX Visible Figure and Extension not distinct Ideas from Colour  It is I know a prevailing Opinion even amongst those who have Thought and Writ most Accurately concerning our  Ideas  and the Ways whereby they enter into the Understanding that something more is perciev'd by Sight than barely Light and Colours with their Variations The Excellent Mr  Locke  termeth Sight  The most Comprehensive of all our Senses conveying to our Minds the  Ideas  of Light and Colours which are peculiar only to that Sense and also the far different  Ideas  of Space Figure and Motion  Essay on Hum Understand b  ii  c    s    Space or Distance we have shewn is no otherwise the  Object  of Sight than of Hearing  vid Sect  XLVI And as for Figure and Extension I leave it to any one that shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct  Ideas  to decide whether he has any  Idea  intromitted immediately and properly by Sight save only Light and Colours Or whether it be possible for him to frame in his Mind a distinct Abstract  Idea  of Visible Extension or Figure exclusive of all Colour and on the other hand whether he can conceive Colour without Visible Extension For my own part I must confess I am not able to attain so great a nicety of Abstraction I know very well that in a strict  Sense I see nothing but Light and Colours with their several Shades and Variations He who beside these doth also perceive by Sight  Ideas  far different and distinct from them hath that Faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than I can pretend to I own indeed that by the mediation of Light and Colours other far different  Ideas  are suggested to my Mind But then upon this Score I see no reason why the Sight shou'd be thought more Comprehensive than the Hearing Which beside Sounds which are peculiar to that Sense doth by their Mediation suggest not only Space Figure and Motion but also all other  Ideas  whatsoever that can be signified by Words  CXXXI Third Argument  Thirdly  It is I think an Axiom universally receiv'd that  Quantities of the same Kind may be added together and make one intire  Sum  Mathematicians add Lines together but they do not add a Line to a Solid or conceive it as making one Sum with a Surface These three Kinds of Quantity being thought incapable of any such mutual Addition and consequently of being compared together in the several ways of Proportion are by them for that reason esteem'd intirely Disparate and Heterogeneous Now let any one try in his Thoughts to add a Visible Line or Surface to a Tangible Line or Surface So as to conceive them making one continu'd Sum or Whole He that can do this may think 'em Homogenuous but he that cannot must by the foregoing Anxiom think them Heterogeneous I acknowledge my self to be of the latter Sort A Blue and and a Red Line I can conceive added together into one Sum and making one continu'd Line but  to make in my Thoughts one continu'd Line of a Visible and Tangible Line added together is I find a Task far more difficult and even insurmountable by me And I leave it to the Reflexion and Experience of every particular Person to determine for himself  CXXXII Confirmation drawn from Mr  Molyneux  's Problem of a Sphere and a Cube publish'd by Mr  Locke  A further Confirmation of our Tenent may be drawn from the Solution of Mr  Molyneux  's Problem publish'd by Mr  Locke  in his  Essay  Which I shall set down as it there lies together with Mr  Locke  's Opinion of it  Suppose a Man Born Blind and now Adult and taught by his Touch to distinguish between a Cube and a Sphere of the same Metal and nighly of the same Bigness so as to tell when he felt one and t'other which is the Cube and which the Sphere Suppose then the Cube and Sphere placed on a Table and the Blind Man  to be made to See  Quaere  Whether by his Sight before he Touch'd them he could now distinguish and tell which is the Globe which the Cube  To which the acute and judicious Proposer Answers  Not For though he has obtain'd the experience of how a Globe how a Cube affects his Touch yet he has not yet attained the Experience that what affects his Touch so or so must affect his Sight so or so Or that a protuberant Angle in the Cube that pressed his Hand unequally shall appear to his Eye as it doth in the Cube  I agree with this thinking Gentleman whom I am proud to call my Friend in his Answer to this his Problem and am of opinion that the Blind Man at first Sight would not be able with certainty to say which was the Globe which the Cube whilst he only saw them  Essay on Human Understand b  ii  c    s    CXXXIII Which is falsly solved if the common Supposition be true  Now if a Square Surface perceiv'd by Touch be of the same Sort with a Square Surface perceived by Sight It is certain the Blind Man here mention'd might know a Square Surface as soon as he saw it It is no more but introducing into his Mind by a new Inlet an  Idea  he has been already well acquainted with Since therefore he is suppos'd to have known by his Touch that a Cube is a Body terminated by Square Surfaces and that a Sphere is not terminated by Square Surfaces Upon the Supposition that a Visible and Tangible Square differ only  in Numero  it follows that he might know by the unerring Mark of the Square Surfaces which was the Cube and which not whilst he only saw them We must therefore allow either that Visible Extension and Figures are Specifically distinct from Tangible  Extension and Figures or else that the Solution of this Problem given by those two very thoughtful and ingenious Men is wrong  CXXXIV More might be said in proof of our Tenent but this suffices  Much more might be laid together in Proof of the Proposition I have advanced But what has been said is if I mistake not sufficient to convince any one that shall yield a reasonable Attention And as for those that will not be at the Pains of a little Thought no Multiplication of Words will ever suffice to make them understand the Truth or rightly conceive my Meaning  CXXXV Farther Reflexion on the foregoing Problem  I cannot let go the abovemention'd Problem without some Reflexion on it It hath been made evident that a Man Blind from his Birth wou'd not at first Sight denominate any thing he saw by the Names he had been us'd to appropriate to  Ideas  of Touch  vid Sect  CVI  Cube    Sphere    Table  are Words he has known applied to Things perceivable by Touch but to Things perfectly Intangible he never knew them apply'd Those Words in their wonted application always mark'd out to his Mind Bodies or Solid Things which were perceiv'd by the Resistance they gave But there is no Solidity no Resistance or Protrusion perceiv'd by Sight In short the  Ideas  of Sight are all new Perceptions to which there be no Names annex'd in his Mind he cannot therefore understand what is said to him concerning them And to ask of the two Bodies he saw placed on the Table which was the Sphere which the Cube Were to him a Question down right Bantering and Unintelligible Nothing he sees being able to suggest to his Thoughts the  Idea  of Body Distance or in general of any thing he had already known  CXXXVI The same thing doth not affect both Sight and Touch  'Tis a Mistake to think the same thing affects both Sight and Touch If the same Angle or Square which is the  Object  of Touch be also the  Object  of Vision What shou'd hinder the Blind Man at first Sight from knowing it For tho' the manner wherein it affects the Sight be different from that wherein it affected his Touch yet there being beside this Manner or Circumstance which is new and unknown the Angle or Figure which is old and known he cannot chuse but discern it  CXXXVII Tho same Idea of Motion not common to Sight and Touch  Visible Figure and Extension having been demonstrated to be of a Nature intirely Different and Heterogeneous from Tangible Figure and Extension it remains that we inquire concerning  Motion  Now that Visible Motion is not of the same Sort with Tangible Motion seems to need no farther Proof  it being an evident Corollary from what we have shewn concerning the Difference there is betwixt Visible and Tangible Extension But for a more full and express Proof hereof we need only observe that one who had not yet experienced Vision wou'd not at first Sight know Motion Whence it clearly follows that Motion perceivable by Sight is of a Sort distinct from Motion perceivable by Touch The Antecedent I prove thus By Touch he cou'd not perceive any Motion but what was up or down to the right or left nearer or farther from him besides these and their several Varieties or Complications it's impossible he shou'd have any  Idea  of Motion He wou'd not therefore think any thing to be Motion or give the name  Motion  to any  Idea  which he cou'd not range under some or other of those particular Kinds thereof But from  Sect  XCV it's  plain that by the meer act of Vision he cou'd not know Motion upwards or downwards to the right or left or in any other possible Direction From which I conclude he'd not know Motion at all at first Sight As for the  Idea  of Motion in  Abstract  I shall not waste Paper about it but leave it to my Reader to make the best he can on't To me 'tis perfectly Unintelligible  CXXXVIII The way wherein we apprehend Motion by Sight easily collected from what hath been said  The Consideration of Motion may furnish a new Field for Inquiry But since the manner wherein the Mind apprehends by Sight the Motion of Tangible  Objects  with the various Degrees thereof may be easily collected from what has been said concerning the manner wherein that Sense doth suggest their various Distances Magnitudes and Situations I shall not enlarge any farther on this Subject But proceed to enquire what  may be alleg'd with greatest appearance of Reason against the Proposition we have Demonstrated to be true For where there is so much Prejudice to be encounter'd a bare and naked Demonstration of the Truth will scarce suffice We must also satisfie the Scruples that Men may Start in favour of their preconceiv'd Notions shew whence the Mistake arises how it came to spread and carefully disclose and root out those false Perswasions that an early Prejudice might have implanted in the Mind  CXXXIX  Qu  How Visible and Tangible  Ideas  came to have the same Name if not of the same Kind  First  Therefore it will be demanded how Visible Extension and Figures come to be call'd by the same Name with Tangible Extension and Figures if they are not of the same Kind with them It must be something more than Humour or Accident that cou'd occasion a Custom so constant and universal  as this which has obtain'd in all Ages and Nations of the World and amongst all Ranks of Men the Learned as well as the Illiterate  CXL This accounted for without supposing them of the same Kind  To which I Answer we can no more Argue  e g  a Visible and Tangible Square to be of the same  Species  from their being call'd by the same Name than we can that a Tangible Square and the Monosyllable consisting of Six Letters whereby it is mark'd are of the same Species because they are both call'd by the same Name It is customary to call written Words and the Things they signify by the same Name For Words not being regarded in their own Nature or otherwise than as they are marks of Things it had been superfluous and beside the design of Language to have given them Names distinct from those of the Things marked by them The same Reason  holds here also Visible Figures are the marks of Tangible Figures and from  Sect  LIX it is plain that in themselves they are little regarded or upon any other Score than for their Connexion with Tangible Figures which by Nature they are ordain'd to signifie And because this Language of Nature does not vary in different Ages or Nations hence it is that in all Times and Places Visible Figures are call'd by the same Names as the respective Tangible Figures suggested by them And not because they are alike or of the same sort with them  CXLI  Obj  That a Tangible Square is liker to a Visible Square than to a Visible Circle  But say you surely a Tangible Square is liker to a Visible Square than to a Visible Circle It has four Angles and as many Sides so also has the Visible Square but the Visible Circle has no such thing being bounded by one uniform Curve without right Lines or Angles  which makes it unfit to represent the Tangible Square but very fit to represent the Tangible Circle Whence it clearly follows that Visible Figures are Patterns of or of the same  Species  with the respective Tangible Figures represented by them that they are like unto them and of their own Nature fitted to represent them as being of the same sort and that they are in no respect arbitrary Signs as Words  CXLII  Ans  That a Visible Square is fitter than a Visible Circle to represent a Tangible Square  I Answer it must be acknowledg'd the Visible Square is fitter than the Visible Circle to represent the Tangible Square but then it is not because it's liker or more of a Species with it But because the Visible Square contains in it several distinct Parts whereby to mark the several distinct corresponding Parts of a Tangible Square whereas the Visible Circle  doth not The Square perceiv'd by Touch hath four distinct equal Sides so also hath it four distinct equal Angles It is therefore necessary that the Visible Figure which shall be most proper to mark it contain four distinct equal Parts corresponding to the four Sides of the Tangible Square as likewise four other distinct and equal Parts whereby to denote the four equal Angles of the Tangible Square And accordingly we see the Visible Figures contain in them distinct Visible Parts answering to the distinct Tangible Parts of the Figures signify'd or suggested by them  CXLIII But it doth not hence follow that a Visible Square is like a Tangible Square  But it will not hence follow that any Visible Figure is like unto or of the same  Species  with its corresponding Tangible Figure unless it be also shewn that not only the Number but also the Kind of the Parts be the same in both  To Illustrate this I observe that Visible Figures represent Tangible Figures much after the same manner that written Words do Sounds Now in this respect Words are not Arbitrary it not being indifferent what written Word stands for any Sound But it is requisite that each Word contain in it as many distinct Characters as there are Variations in the Sound it stands for Thus the single Letter  a  is proper to mark one simple uniform Sound and the Word  Adultery  is accommodated to represent the Sound annext to it in the Formation whereof there being Eight different Collisions or Modifications of the Air by the Organs of Speech each of which produces a difference of Sound it was fit the Word representing it shou'd consist of as many distinct Characters thereby to mark each particular Difference or Part of the whole Sound And yet  no Body I presume will say the single Letter  a  or the Word  Adultery  are like unto or of the same Species with the respective Sounds by them Represented It is indeed Arbitrary that in general Letters of any Language represent Sounds at all but when that is once agreed it is not Arbitrary what Combination of Letters shall represent this or that particular Sound I leave this with the Reader to pursue and apply it in his own Thoughts  CXLIV Why we are more apt to confound Visible with Tangible  Ideas  than other Signs with the Things signify'd  It must be confest that we are not so apt to confound other Signs with the Things signified or to think them of the same Species as we are Visible and Tangible  Ideas  But a little Consideration will shew us how this may well be without our supposing them of a like Nature These Signs are constant and universal this Connexion with Tangible  Ideas  has been  learnt at our first Entrance into the World and ever since almost every Moment of our Lives it has been occurring to our Thoughts and fastening and striking deeper on our Minds When we observe that Signs are variable and of Human Institution when we remember there was a time they were not connected in our Minds with those things they now so readily suggest but that their Signification was learned by the slow Steps of Experience This preserves us from confounding them But when we find the same Signs suggest the same Things all over the World when we know they are not of Human Institution and cannot remember that we ever learn'd their Signification but think that at first Sight they would have suggested to us the same Things they do now All this perswades us they are of the same  Species  as the  Things respectively represented by them and that is by a natural Resemblance they suggest them to our Minds  CXLV Several other Reasons hereof assign'd  Add to this that whenever we make a nice Survey of any  Object  successively directing the  Optic Axis  to each Point thereof there are certain Lines and Figures describ'd by the Motion of the Head or Eye which being in Truth perceiv'd by Feeling do nevertheless so mix themselves as it were with the  Ideas  of Sight that we can scarce think but they appertain to that Sense Again the  Ideas  of Sight enter into the Mind several at once more distinct and unmingled than is usual in the other Senses beside the Touch Sounds for Example perceiv'd at the same Instant are apt to coalesce if I may so say into one Sound But we can perceive at the same  time great variety of Visible Objects very separate and distinct from each other Now Tangible Extension being made up of several distinct coexistent parts we may hence gather another Reason that may dispose us to imagine a Likeness or Analogy between the immediate Objects of Sight and Touch But nothing certainly does more contribute to blend and confound them together than the strict and close Connexion they have with each other We cannot open our Eyes but the  Ideas  of Distance Bodies and Tangible Figures are suggested by them So swift and sudden and unperceiv'd is the  Transit  from Visible to Tangible  Ideas  that we can scarce forbear thinking 'em equally the immediate Object of Vision  CXLVI Reluctancy in rejecting any Opinion no Argument of its Truth  The Prejudice which is grounded on these and whatever other Causes may be assign'd thereof  sticks so fast on our Understandings that it is impossible without obstinate Striving and Labour of the Mind to get intirely clear of it But then the Reluctancy we find in rejecting any Opinion can be no Argument of its Truth to whoever considers what has been already shewn with regard to the Prejudices we entertain concerning the  Distance    Magnitude  and  Situation  of Objects Prejudices so familiar to our Minds so confirm'd and inveterate as they will hardly give way to the clearest Demonstration  CXLVII Proper Objects of Vision the Language of Nature  Upon the whole I think we may fairly conclude that the proper Objects of Vision constitute the Universal Language of Nature whereby we are instructed how to regulate our Actions in order to attain those things that are necessary to the Preservation and Wellbeing of our Bodies as  also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them It's by their Information that we are principally guided in all the Transactions and Concerns of Life And the manner wherein they signify and mark out unto us the Objects which are at a distance is the same with that of Languages and Signs of Human Appointment which do not suggest the things signify'd by any Likeness or Identity of Nature but only by an Habitual Connexion that Experience has made us to observe between 'em  CXLVIII In it there is much admirable and deserving our attention  Suppose one who had always continu'd Blind be told by his Guide that after he has advanced so many Steps he shall come to the Brink of a Precipice or be stopt by a Wall must not this to him seem very admirable and surprizing He can't conceive how 'tis possible for Mortals  to frame such Predictions as these which to him would seem as strange and unaccountable as Prophesy does to others Even they who are Blessed with the Visive Faculty may tho' Familiarity make it less observ'd find therein sufficient Cause of Admiration The wonderful Art and Contrivance wherewith it is adjusted to those Ends and Purposes for which it was apparently design'd the vast Extent Number and Variety of Objects that are at once with so much Ease and Quickness and Pleasure suggested by it All these afford Subject for much and pleasing Speculation and may if any thing give us some Glimmering Analogous Praenotion of Things that are placed beyond the certain Discovery and Comprehension of our present State  CXLIX Question propos'd concerning the Object of Geometry  I do not design to trouble my self much with drawing Corollaries from the Doctrine I have hitherto laid down If it bears the Test others may so far as they shall think convenient employ their Thoughts in extending it farther and applying it to whatever Purposes it may be subservient to Only I cannot forbear making some Inquiry concerning the  Object  of Geometry which the Subject we have been upon does naturally lead one to We have shewn there's no such  Idea  as that of Extension in Abstract and that there are two kinds of sensible Extension and Figures which are intirely Distinct and Heterogeneous from each other Now it is natural to enquire which of these is the  Object  of  Geometry  CL At first View we are apt to think Visible Extension the Object of Geometry  Some things there are which at first sight incline one to think  Geometry conversant about Visible Extension The constant use of the Eyes both in the Practical and Speculative Parts of that Science doth very much induce us thereto It would without doubt seem odd to a Mathematician to go about to convince him the Diagrams he saw upon Paper were not the Figures or even the Likeness of the Figures which make the Subject of the Demonstration The contrary being held an unquestionable Truth not only by Mathematicians but also by those who apply themselves more particularly to the Study of  Logick  I mean who consider the Nature of Science Certainty and Demonstration It being by them assign'd as one Reason of the extraordinary Clearness and Evidence of Geometry that in that Science the Reasonings are free from those Inconveniences which attend the use of  Arbitrary Signs The very  Ideas  themselves being Copied out and exposed to View upon Paper But by the bye how well this agrees with what they likewise assert of Abstract  Ideas  being the Object of Geometrical Demonstration I leave to be consider'd  CLI Visible Extension shewn not to be the Object of Geometry  To come to a Resolution in this Point we need only observe what has been said in  Sect  LIX LX LXI where it is shewn that Visible Extensions in themselves are little regarded and have no settled determinate Greatness and that Men measure altogether by the Application of Tangible Extension to Tangible Extension All which makes it evident that Visible Extension and Figures are not the Object of Geometry  CLII Words may as well be thought the Object of Geometry as Visible Extension  It is therefore plain that Visible Figures are of the same Use in Geometry that Words are And the one may as well be accounted the  Object  of that Science as the other neither of them being any otherwise concern'd therein than as they represent or suggest to the Mind the particular Tangible Figures connected with them There is indeed this Difference betwixt the Signification of Tangible Figures by Visible Figures and of  Ideas  by Words That whereas the Latter is variable and uncertain depending altogether on the Arbitrary Appointment of Men the Former is fix'd and immutably the same in all Times and Places A Visible Square for Instance suggests to the Mind the same Tangible Figure in  Europe  that it doth in  America  Hence it is that the Voice of Nature which  speaks to our Eyes is not liable to that Misinterpretation and Ambiguity that Languages of Human Contrivance are unavoidably subjected to From which may in some measure be derived that peculiar Evidence and Clearness of Geometrical Demonstrations  CLIII It is propos'd to enquire what Progress an Intelligence that cou'd see but not feel might make in Geometry  Tho' what has been said may suffice to shew what ought to be determin'd with relation to the  Object  of Geometry I shall nevertheless for the fuller Illustration thereof take into my Thoughts the Case of an Intelligence or Unbody'd Spirit which is suppos'd to see perfectly well  i e  to have a clear Perception of the proper and immediate Objects of Sight but to have no Sense of  Touch  Whether there be any such Being in Nature or no is beside my Purpose to enquire It suffices that the Supposition contains no Contradiction in it Let  us now examine what Proficiency such a one may be able to make in  Geometry  Which Speculation will lead us more clearly to see whether the  Ideas  of Sight can possibly be the  Object  of that Science  CLIV He cannot understand those parts which relate to Solids and their Surfaces and Lines generated by their Section  First then 'tis certain the aforesaid Intelligence could have no  Idea  of a Solid or Quantity of three Dimensions which follows from its not having any  Idea  of Distance We indeed are prone to think that we have by Sight the  Ideas  of Space and Solids which arises from our imagining that we do strictly speaking see Distance and some parts of an  Object  at a greater Distance than others which has been demonstrated to be the Effect of the Experience we have had what  Ideas  of Touch are connected with such and such  Ideas  attending Vision But the Intelligence here  spoken of is suppos'd to have no Experience of Touch He wou'd not therefore judge as we do nor have any  Idea  of Distance Outness or Profundity nor consequently of Space or Body either immediately or by Suggestion Whence it is plain he can have no Notion of those parts of Geometry which relate to the Mensuration of Solids and their Convex or Concave Surfaces and contemplate the Properties of Lines generated by the Section of a Solid The conceiving of any part whereof is beyond the Reach of his Faculties  CLV Nor even the Elements of plain Geometry  Farther he cannot comprehend the manner wherein Geometers describe a right Line or Circle The Rule and Compass with their Use being things of which it's impossible he should have any Notion Nor is it an easier matter for him to conceive the placing of  one Plain or Angle on another in order to prove their Equality Since that supposes some  Idea  of Distance or External Space All which makes it evident our pure Intelligence could never attain to know so much as the first Elements of plain Geometry And perhaps upon a nice Enquiry it will be found he cannot even have an  Idea  of Plain Figures any more than he can of Solids Since some  Idea  of Distance is necessary to form the  Idea  of a Geometrical Plain as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it  CLVI The proper Objects of Sight incapable of being managed as Geometrical Figures  All that is properly perceiv'd by the Visive Faculty amounts to no more than Colours with their Variations and different Proportions of Light and Shade But the perpetual Mutability and Fleetingness of those immediate Objects of Sight render them incapable of being managed after the manner  of Geometrical Figures nor is it in any Degree useful that they should It's true there be divers of 'em perceiv'd at once and more of some and less of others But accurately to compute their Magnitude and assign precise determinate Proportions between Things so Variable and Inconstant if we suppose it possible to be done must yet be a very trifling and insignificant Labour  CLVII The Opinion of those who hold plain Figures to be the immediate Objects of Sight consider'd  I must confess it seems to be the Opinion of some very Ingenious Men that flat or plain Figures are immediate Objects of Sight tho' they acknowledge Solids are not And this Opinion of their's is grounded on what is observ'd in Painting wherein say they the  Ideas  immediately imprinted in the Mind are only of Plains variously colour'd which by a sudden Act of the Judgment are changed into Solids But with a little Attention  we shall find the Plains here mention'd as the immediate Objects of Sight are not Visible but Tangible Plains For when we say that Pictures are Plains we mean thereby that they appear to the  Touch  Smooth and Uniform But then this Smoothness and Uniformity or in other Words this Plainness of the Picture is not perceiv'd immediately by Vision For it appeareth to the Eye Various and Multiform  CLVIII Plains no more the immediate Objects of Sight than Solids  From all which we may conclude that Plains are no more the immediate  Object  of Sight than Solids What we strictly see are not Solids nor yet Plains variously colour'd they are only Diversity of Colours And some of these suggest to the Mind Solids and others Plain Figures just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one or the other So that we see Plains in the same way that we  see Solids Both being equally suggested by the immediate Objects of Sight which accordingly are themselves Denominated  Plains  and  Solids  But tho' they are called by the same Names with the Things mark'd by them they are nevertheless of a Nature intirely different as hath been Demonstrated  CLIX Difficult to enter precisely into the Thoughts of the above mention'd Intelligence  What has been said is if I mistake not sufficient to Decide the Question we propos'd to Examine concerning the Ability of a pure Spirit such as we have describ'd to know  Geometry  It is indeed no easy matter for us to enter precisely into the Thoughts of such an Intelligence because we cannot without great Pains cleverly Separate and Disintangle in our Thoughts the proper Objects of Sight from those of Touch which are Connected with them This indeed in a compleat Degree  seems scarce possible to be perform'd Which will not seem strange to us if we consider how hard it is for any one to hear the Words of his Native Language which is familiar to him pronounced in his Ears without understanding them Tho' he endeavour to disunite the meaning from the Sound it will nevertheless intrude into his Thoughts and he shall find it extream Difficult if not impossible to put himself exactly in the Posture of a Foreigner that never learnt the Language so as to be affected barely with the Sounds themselves and not perceive the Signification annexed to them  CXL The Object of Geometry its not being sufficiently understood cause of Difficulty and useless Labour in that Science  By this time I suppose 'tis clear that neither Abstract nor Visible Extension makes rhe  Object  of  Geometry  The not discerning of which might perhaps have created some Difficulty and useless Labour in  Mathematics  Sure I am that somewhat relating thereto has occur'd to my Thoughts which tho' after the most anxious and repeated Examination I am forced to think it true doth nevertheless seem so far out of the common road of  Geometry  that I know not whether it may not be thought Presumption if I shou'd make it publick in an Age wherein that Science hath receiv'd such mighty Improvements by new Methods great Part whereof as well as of the Ancient Discoveries may perhaps lose their Reputation and much of that Ardor with which Men study the  Abstruse and Fine Geometry  be abated if what to me and those few to whom I have imparted it seems evidently True shou'd really prove to be so  FINIS
