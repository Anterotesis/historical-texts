 A NEW TEST OF THE Church of ENGLAND's Loyalty OR  Whiggish Loyalty  AND Church Loyalty COMPAR'D  A NEW TEST OF THE Church of  ENGLAND  's Loyalty  IN all the unhappy Contentions among Parties and Factions in this brangling Nation the Champions of the Church of  England as they would have themselves call'd  have laid it down as the distinguishing Mark of their Hiearchy that it is her Practice and has been deriv'd from her very Constitution as well as Doctrine to six in all her Members Principles of unshaken Loyalty to her Prince entire and undisputed Obedience to all her Commands and an Abhorrence of the very Thoughts of those Hellish Principles  That it can be lawful on any Account whatsoever to resist the Establish'd Power of their Kings▪  'T wou'd be endless to quote the Reverend Dr  Bge  who from the Text in the  Resist not the Powers  c  for whatsoever Powers are be ordain'd of God whosoever therefore resisteth the Power resisteth the Ordinance of God  tells us  'That if the King shou'd by his Royal Command execute the greatest Violence upon either our Penson or Estate our Duty was to submit by Prayers and Tears first to God Almighty to turn the Wrath of His Vicegerent from His Servant  and by humble Entreaty to beg his Majesties Grace and Pardon but  to lift up the Hand against the Lord's Anointed or resist the Evil of Punishment he thought sit to inflict  this were a Crime unpardonable either before God or Man and a Crime says the Reverend Doctor which we bless God the very Principles of our  Ever Loyal Mother  the Church of  England  abhors and detests  'Let Incendiaries Phanaticks and Bloody Peacebreaking Whigs says another Learned Divine nourish the Vip'rous Principles of Treason and Rebellion and let them meet the due Reward of their Factious Doings in the Resentments of a Righteous but Provok'd Nation But God be praised our Mother the Church of  England  has always brought up her Sons in an unspotted Loyalty and Obedience none have been found lifting up their Hands against their Sovereign or possessing the Rights of the Anointed of God  c  'The very Being and Life the Original and Principles of the Church of  England  says another th of  January  Sermon is Loyalty and Fidelity to God as the immediate Supream and to the King as the lively Image of Divine Authority whose Power is immediately deriv'd from holds of and is accountable to none but to God himself  To avoid Prolixity of Quotation the Reader is desir'd to accept of these as sufficient Proofs of what I lay down  upon this Condition nevertheless  that besides the general Appeal which I might make to the Memory of most Men I oblige my self upon Demand to produce Ten Thousand fair Quotations out of the Writings of our late modern Authors since the Restauration wherein the Doctrines of Nonresistance of Princes Passive Obedience and the Divine Authority of the Kingly power is own'd and declar'd to be an Essential part of the Profession and Practice of the Church of  England  and upon this Foot which I hold to be sufficient I think I cannot be censured if I take it for granted  Now as this too much divided Nation has always been compos'd of two contending Parties those Parties have been  distinguish'd  as in like Cases  by Names of Contempt and tho' they have often chang'd them on either side as Cavalier and Roundhead Royalists and Rebels Malignants and Phanaticks Tories and Whigs yet the Division has always been barely  the Church and the Dissenter  and there it continues to this Day  As the Church of  England  Party have boasted of their own Loyalty so they have branded the Dissenter with Rebellion and Faction not only in their Nature but in their very Principles they have laid it down in their Writings and Sermons and multitudes of their ignorant Hearers believe it that  the very Doctrine of the Dissenter is made up of Principles in their own Nature tending to Confusion and Rebellion  they wont be content that we should own there may be Men among all Parties of bad Designs and who wou'd on all Occasions embroil their Native Country but it must be woven with the very Articles of Faith and that 'tis the Religion of a Dissenter to disturb Government kill Kings and oppose Laws  'The Phanatical Enemies of our King and Church says the Learned Dr  Pn  drink in Rebellion as Water 'tis the very Substance of their Schismatical Doctrine to overwhelm and destroy and Commonwealths and Confusions are the Doctrines they preach  He that lays out one Groat with a Dissenter says the worthy Sir  Roger  in one of his famous  Observators  contributes just so much as the Profits of that Groat amounts to in Trade towards the Subversion of the Monarchy and erecting a Commonwealth for the very Nature and Tendency of their Profession is destructive of Kingly power and the Government of the Nation  This has been the Opinion of the Church of  England  both of themselves on one Hand and of the Dissenters on the other Hand I should be glad if I cou'd only say  It has been  for we find 'tis still too much their Opinion  Let no Man say that the Author of these Sheets is either widening or keeping unheal'd the Breaches of this Nation for if I can make it appear that there is really no occasion of such  unnatural Divisions and that neither the extraordinary Opinion of themselves nor the Contempt of their Neighbours as to the matter of Loyalty is a becoming Principle no nor a rational one neither For that as to Loyalty Passive Obedience Nonresistance  c  there is really no great Difference between one side or other I go as far towards healing the Breach as any Man for there can be no better way to end the Strife on both sides than to prove that neither side has any just cause to contend  To examine the Matter on both sides seems very useful at this time in order to reconcile Parties and to settle the Universal Character of the Nation  The Government of  England  is a limited Monarchy composed of King Lords and Commons Each have their several their separate and conjunctive Powers which acting in concert make the Harmony of the Constitution I shall not invade the Province of those Learned Gentlemen who have undertaken to set forth the Branches of the Constitution in all their Powers Limitations and Prerogatives 'Tis enough to say the Constitution is known the Government is confin'd by Laws the Crown limited by Statutes and the People's Right confirm'd by concession of Ages  To this Government all Distinction of Names set apart I am of the Opinion all Parties have in their Turns been equally Loyal I was going to say equally Disloyal And if I were to use the Language of late Times it wou'd be a very proper way of speaking  Affirming without demonstrating is an absurd way of Arguing and therefore it will be needful to come to particulars and to examine the several Acts and Deeds of both Parties when the Kingly Prerogative has shock'd or clash'd with the People  In order to this 'tis needful to examine the Date of the Difference and so to enter a little into History  Our first Reformation from Popery was in the Days of King  Edward  the VI I call it the first because 'twas under him that the whole Nation and the Government embrac'd the Protestant Reform'd Religion▪ this Protestant Religion  was establish'd by that  Zealous KING  and by his Parliament back'd with the force of Laws and confirm'd by all the Sanction of Authority it was capable of and here it began to be call'd the Church of  England  Some enquiring Christians were for making farther Steps and carrying on the Reformation to a higher Degree and if that good reforming King had liv'd his Zeal and Integrity was such that there was no doubt he would have gone on to perfect every Thing he had begun as new Light or more Knowledge had encreased but the return of Popery under Queen  Mary  put a Stop to the Work in general and went very far towards overturning the whole Structure of the Reformation  Queen  Elizabeth  restor'd it again but as she was a zealous Protestant Queen yet she was not for subjecting the Reformation to any amendment Not that she believ'd it perfect but she was a Politick Princess surrounded with Enemies that were not to be dally'd with and she was loth to suppose such Defects in the Reformation as were alledg'd because 'twas to lessen the Reputation of it and consequently her Interest in the World  Those who insisted upon the further Reformation were then call'd  Puritans  because they set up for greater Purity of Worship and they separated themselves from the establish'd Church because as they said their Consciences inform'd them that they could serve God more agreeable to his Will  I shall not meddle with the Arguments made use of on both Sides either to defend or expose this Principle 'tis sufficient to acquaint my Reader that this is the true Original of the Dissenters We are now to examine a little further back Before this Reformation there was no such thing as Church of  England  it was then the Church of  Rome  that was the establish'd National Church  The Protestants under the Titles of  Lollards Wickliffians Hussites  c what did they do Did they  as our Modern People say every Body shou'd  confirm to what the Government  Commanded No the present Church of  England  Party were the Dissenters the Schismaticks and Phanaticks in the Days of King  Henry  VIII were persecuted for not coming to Church many of them put to Death and always treated with Scorn and Contempt as Enemies to the Government Broachers of new Opinions and Contemners of Authority as in the case of that famous ProtoMartyr of Christ's Church  John Lambert  and others  In the next Ages these come to have the Power in their Hands and forgetting that they had found it  righteous in the Sight of God to obey God rather than Man  they treat those whose Consciences oblige them to dissent from them with the same Contempt which themselves had receiv'd from the  Roman  Government  Thus far they are upon even Terms as to Obedience to their Superiors  The Dissenters have the first Occasion after this to show their Submission under extraordinary Pressures Queen  Elizabeth  discountenanc'd them continually and as good a Queen as she was put some of them to Death King  James  I hunted them quite out of the Kingdom made Thousands of them fly into  Holland  and  Germany  and at last to  NewEngland  During the long Reign of these two Princes we find no Charge of Treason or Rebellion upon them they bore the Displeasure of their Princes with Patience and Passive Obedience  if I may be allow'd that Ridiculous Phrase  being persecuted in one City they fled to another they bore illegal Prosecutions and things contrary to their Right as  English  Men but never took up Arms against their Prince  Under the Reign of King  Charles  I the Case alter'd the King and Parliament fell out about Matters of Civil Right and Invasion of the Liberty and Properties of the People the  Puritans  or Dissenters call them what we please fell in unanimously with the Parliament  And here 'tis worthy Remark that the first Difference between the King and the  English  Parliament did not respect Religion but Civil Property nor were the Majority of the  House of  Puritans  but true Church Protestants and  English  Men who stood upon the Rights of the People as  English  Men and none were more Zealous in the first Disputes than the Lord  Digby  Sir  Thomas Wentworth  and such as were afterwards deep Sufferers for the King  But the Parliament finding the Puritan Party stuck close to their Cause they also came over to them when things came to a Rupture and so the War begun on the Score of Right Invasion of Liberty Breach of  he Laws Private Leagues and Male Administration a Game we have seen play'd over again by the very same Church of  England  that have exclaim'd so much against it so damn'd it and so damn'd themselves by Oaths Declarations Tests and God knows what against it  'Tis allow'd here the Puritan broke thro' his Loyalty and his former Obedience and fought his Way to the Liberty he demanded Well the War ended to his Advantage he subdued his Sovereign and brought him to the Block to the Astonishment of the whole World  I wont dispute here which or which Party did or did not do it but to give the Enemy all just Advantage I am willing to grant it in the largest Sense that the Dissenters or Phanaticks or Whigs call them as you please did embrue their Hands in the Blood of the Lord's Anointed put to Death that blessed Martyr King  Charles  the I whom a learned Divine in a Sermon on the th of  January  before the Parliament compares both in the manner of his Sufferings and the People by whom to our Saviour and the Jews and boldly runs on in the Blasphemous Parallel to shew that the Indignities and Sufferings of King  Charles  exceed those of Jesus Christ  I think I have granted as largely as a fair Adversary can desire for I have yielded for Peacesake to several things which I cou'd fairly disprove  Nor shall I return to a Repitition of the ill Usage the Dissenters have receiv'd from the contrary Party on this Account for above Years the constant Reproaches they and  their Children after them have met with from those Gentlemen who on all Occasions have as I hinted before particularly taken care to extol their own unshaken Fidelity to their Prince till at last an Occasion presents to touch them in the same most sensible Part  their Right and Property  and  alas  their Loyalty what became of it Truly the  Faithful Passively Obedient Ʋnshakenly Loyal  Church return'd to the Original Nature of their Neighbours and did the same thing exactly which the Whigs  the Factious Rebellious Whigs  had done before  'No that's false says a Disciple of Dr  Sherlock  's we did not kill our King we did not dip our Hands in Royal Blood nor hurt the Lord's Anointed  No that's true but the Lord's Anointed may thank himself for that for my part I think the Difference only lyes here the Whigs in to took up Arms against their King and having conquer'd him and taken him Prisoner cut off his Head  because they had him  The Church of  England  took Arms against their King in and did not cut off his Head  because they had him not  King  Charles  lost his Life  because he did not run away  and his Son King  James  sav'd his Life  because he did run away  'Tis such a Jest such a Banter to say We did take up Arms but we did not kill him  Bless us kill our King we wou'd not have hurt a Hair of his Head  Why every Bullet shot at the Battle of the  Boyne  was a killing the King for if you did not 'twas because you cou'd not hit him  If a Highwayman fires at you upon the Road when he is taken and brought upon his Trial our learned Recorder before he pronounces Sentence of Death barangues him in this manner  And besides all this Sir you are plainly guilty of Murther for you not only assaulted this honest Man in order to take away his Money but you endeavour'd to murther him for you shot at him in order to kill him and the Intention of Murther is Equally Criminal in the Eyes of God with the Act it self  Now who did we shoot at at the  Boyne 'Tis true King  James  generally stood out of the way  But who did we shoot at What was our Orders to  sight against both small and great  and not against the King of  Israel Had your Bullets Commission to show their Loyalty and not to touch the Lord's Anointed If he had Charg'd in the first Squadrons of his Horse had you not kill'd him if you cou'd I think this need no further Proof  Nay if Arguments may be allow'd to have equal Weight on both Sides the Whigs have been the honester of the two for they never profest any such blind absolute and undisputed Obedience to Princes as the others have done  It has always been their Opinion That Government was originally contrived by the Consent and for the mutual Benefit of the Parties Govern'd that the People have an Original Native Right to their Property the Liberty of their Persons and Possessions  unless forefaulted to the Laws  that they cannot be divested of this Right but by their own Consent and that all Invasion of this Right is destructive of the Constitution and dissolves the Compact of Government and Obedience  They have always declar'd That they understand their Allegiance to their Governors to be  supposing they Govern them according to the Laws of the Land  and that if Princes break this Bond of Government the Nature of it is inverted and the Constitution ceases of course  Buchanan  in  Scotland Algernoon Sidney  in  England  have set their Names  and the latter his Blood  to this Doctrine and the Author of the  Trueborn Englishman  is worth quoting in the Case  The Government's ungirt when Justice dies  And Constitutions are NonEntities  The Nation's all a Mob there's no such thing  As Lords or Commons Parliament or King  A great promiscuous Crowd the Hydra lyes  Till Laws revive and mutual Contract ties  A Chaos free to chuse for their own Share  What case of Government they please to wear  If to a King they do the Reigns commit  All Men are bound in Conscience to submit  But then that King must by his Oath assent  To Postulata's of the Government  Which if he breaks he cuts off the Entail  And Power Retreats to its Original  Trueborn Englishman  P    This has been the avow'd Doctrine of the Dissenters and is indeed the true Sense of the Constitution it self pursuant to this Doctrine they thought they had a Right to oppose Violence with Force believing that when Kings break Coronation Oaths the Solemn Compact with their People and encroach upon their Civil Rights contrary to the Laws of the Land by which they are sworn to Rule they cease to be the Lord's Anointed any longer the Sanction of their Office is vanish'd and they become Tyrants and Enemies of Mankind and may be treated accordingly  Now 'tis no wonder to find People of these Principles vigorously withstanding their Governors when they tread upon the tender fore places of the Constitution 'tis nothing but what they all along pretended to and declar'd to be their Opinion  But to find the Church of  England  Men whose Loyalty has been the Subject of a Thousand Learned Authors and numberless Sermons whose Character and Mark of Distinction has been chosen more for her steddy Adherence and Fidelity to her Prince than to God Almighty whose Obedience to her Monarchs has been declar'd to be Inviolate and Immoveable and who pretends to be Famous thro' the whole World for their Faithfulness to Kings  for her  as soon as ever the King did but as it were seem to aim at crushing her Authority as soon as he did but begin to call her Clergy to an Account and clap up her  Golden Candlesticks  for Disobedience  for her  to winch and kick fly to foreign Princes for Protection and rise in Arms against her Prince O  Pelin  O  Brady  O  Sherlock  O  Hominem  O  Mores  Where's the worthy Dr  Bge  's Loyalty now His Immoveable Loyalty that after all his Absolute Submission is so far from being a Martyr to his own Doctrine that he cou'd not lose a small Benefice for it  VVhere is the Famous Dr  Sk  VVho having stood out long in his old antiquated Doctrine of Passive Obedience and confirm'd the Faith of his Suff'ring Brethren by strong and wonderful Arguments at last at the powerful Instigation of a VVife and a good Sallary  has Sold all his Loyalty for a Mess of Pottage  solving his Honesty with the wretched Distinction of a Power  De Facto  and a Power  De Jure  as if the Church of  England  's Credit cou'd be sav'd by such an impotent Shift or as if he cou'd make amends to the Prebendary for his helping him to Sacrifice his Brethren to Father his Conversion upon reading honest Dr  Overall  whose Doctrine 'tis well known the Doctor knew before but that he was loath Dr  South  shou'd have the Honour of bringing him over to such Old Phanatick Principles  Behold the Loyalty of the Church of  England  now let's examine their Conscience as to taking Oaths and if I do not bring them to be all VVhigs and  FortyOneMen  or else prove them all Perjur'd then I do nothing  The Clergy all the Magistrates and Officers of the Houshold of the Civil or Military Government were Members of the Church of  England  otherwise they cou'd not be employ'd the Sacramental Test has done the Dissenters this Kindness that 'tis plain all the Managing Hands in the Kingdom were Disciples of the Church and as an additional Circumstance the Oath of Allegiance which they took and which was God be praised of their own making bound them to that same Absolute Blind Obedience which they profest and confin'd it to the King his Heirs and Successors  If this Oath be consider'd literally I am content to be silenc'd when one fair Argument can be brought to evade it the Declaration follow'd it wherein they detest and abhor that devilish Doctrine that 'tis lawful  on any pretence whatsoever  Mark the Emphasis  to take up Arms against the King▪ this  equal to an Oath  is declar'd in the presence of God and the Particulars being material to our purpose are as follows  I  A B  do Declare and Believe that it is not Lawful upon any Pretence whatsoever to take up Arms against the King and that I do abhor that Traiterous Position of taking Arms by his Authority against those that are Commissioned by him  So help me God  Notwithstanding this you have taken up Arms against deposed and as far as you were able put to Death your lawful King the very King you swore Allegiance to  Now  pray Gentlemen give Commission to some worthy Champion of your Church's Loyalty to bring you fairly off of your Oath and Declaration if you can  and till you do be not angry with us for making one of these Conclusions from the Premises and you shall chuse for your selves  First  That this Doctrine of Absolute Passive and Nonresistant Obedience is an Absurdity in it self contradictory to the Nature of Government and Allegiance and politically introduc'd by State Engines into the Church of  England  to abuse her and betray her Members into unforeseen Mischiefs and Inconveniences  Or  Secondly  That the Members of the Church of  England  are all Apostates from the very Fundamental Doctrine of their Church Perjur'd in the Sight of God and Man Notorious Hypocrites and Deceivers who having sworn Obedience without Reserve to their Prince are become Traitors Rebels and Murtherers of the Lord's Anointed and their Lawful Sovereign and not having the Fear of God before their Eyes have depos'd and traiterously dethron'd their Rightful King God Almighty's Vicegerent accountable to no Earthly Power Supream under God Absolute and from Divine Institution Undoubted Sole Lord of them and their Country  Or  Lastly  That they only are the true Church of  England  who according to their avow'd Profession have firmly adher'd to their King in all his Sufferings and Solitude have never blacken'd their Consciences nor gone back from their Obedience forgotten their Oaths nor fullied their Reputation with the horrid Crimes of Treason and Rebellion as they think it to be  Now as a fair Disputant I am willing the Respondent shall chuse which of these Three Consequences he will stand by in behalf of the Church of  England  's Loyalty but if they wou'd take the Advice of  a Friend to the honest Part of them  I wou'd recommend the first Conclusion to be fittest for them for the following Reason  Because since humane Infallibility is  and with good Reason  disown'd by the Church of  England  both for her Self and every Body else it can be no Diminution to her Reputation when she has found her self mistaken and impos'd upon to acknowledge her Error  a wise Man will always own rather than defend a mistake  Because 'tis my Opinion that their Way is hedg'd up against any other pretence Evasion or Reservation and therefore 'tis with me the only thing that Charity can say for them and must remain so till I find something else said that is more to the Purpose  But the Mischief of all is that if this be honestly acknowledg'd  as is doubtless most true  that the Church of  England  was mistaken and impos'd upon to espouse a Sensless Absurd Principle contrary to the Nature of Government and Allegiance  c  why then they come over to this Consequence  That Government and Allegiance are both Conditional and Oaths of Subjects are always to be consider'd in a Constructive Sence with Conditions of Protection and the like a thing which is without question the real Meaning of all Oaths of Allegiance otherwise Subjects may be put under an absolute Necessity of Perjury or State Martyrdom by often swearing what may be impossible for them to perform  The Town of  Aeth  in  Flanders  has been about times and the Town of  Rhinebergh  in  Gueldre  about times taken and retaken and as often as new Masters had Possession of the Place so often the poor Inhabitants have sworn to their new Lords What can the meaning of such an Oath be but that they will be faithful to them so long as they keep Possession of the Place 'Twou'd be ridiculous to imagine the Imposers of the Oath requir'd any more  If our Zealous Churchmen worded an Oath contrary to the very Nature of Swearing Allegiance let them answer for it who first made it then took it then broke it But the Nature of the thing can leave Room for no other Suggestion that I know of  Till then some further Argument is produc'd it must rest here that the Church of  England  was Mistaken Imposed upon  c  that she finds when the Laws are Broken the Right of the People Invaded the Root of the Government Struck at Church and State Undermin'd and Dispotick Tyranny at the Door the Native Right of the People is Superior and they may assume a Power to Right themselves  And so we are brought back to Whiggism and    and Gentlemen there is no remedy for it help it if you can  Where now is the Difference between Church Loyalty and Whiggish Loyalty Roundhead or Cavalier Churchman or Dissenter Whig or Tory All are alike they are pleas'd when legally Govern'd Quarrelsome and Unruly if Opprest and will Defend themselves if Assaulted tho' it be by their Kings or any Body else  Why then is the Difference kept up Methinks they might all be friends together for they are all alike the Dissenters have been in their times as Loyal and the Church of  England  in their time as Disloyal as one another  Vice versa  the Dissenters have been as Disloyal and the Churchmen as Loyal as one another upon the same Occasion they have been both Sufferers and have submited to the Government ay and to the Oppressions and Persecutions of their Superiors and Sovereigns and again upon the like Occasions they  have both of them been Rebels  if their own Language may so far be us'd  they have both of them in their Turn taken Arms against and depos'd their Rightful and Lawful Kings  So that in my Opinion  with a Latitude to all that think otherwise to think as they please  the Church of  England  and their Neighbours the Dissenters have nothing to quarrel with one another about as to Loyalty as to other Matters I have nothing to say to them nor shall not mingle it with this Discourse  Nor do I think I am writing a Satyr against the Church of  England  nor is it at all intended to be so and to stop all Pretences that way I take the Freedom to say here has been no Crime the Church of  England  has been in the right of it not in taking Arms but the Error was in Espousing Crying up and Pretending to a Blind Absolute Obedience to Princes be their Commands never so Absolute Tyrannical or Illegal this neither the Doctrine nor Practice of the Church of  England  nor of any Church or People in the Christian World ever pretended to and therefore the Fault lay in those people who being themselves Members of the Church of  England  suffer'd themselves to be deluded by StateMinisters to foster a Tenent upon the Church which her Original Constitution never pretended to and then call it the Doctrine of the Church of  England  The first beginning of their pretended Doctrine was found in  Manwaring  's and  Sibthorp  's Libels in the Days of King  Charles  I cajoling the King and then to please him endeavouring to wheedle the People into a Belief of the Divine Right of Kingly Government and affirming that the King was not oblig'd by the Laws in the Administration of the Government  Upon this preposterous Foundation they built the Illegitimate Structure of Absolute Undisputed Obedience for if Kingly power were once prov'd to be immediately deriv'd from Divine Authority Absolute Obedience wou'd be a Consequence no body could dispute since the same Obedience without reserve wou'd be due to the Delegated power as to the Power delegating  And though this is a point easily enough confuted yet being willing to keep the present Dispute within as small a compass as we can I think our Argument has nothing at all to do with it  Whether Government be of Divine Original or not seems not the Question here for if it be not so then as before the Church of  England  have been mistaken and imposed upon and if it be so then the Church of  England  has trampled underfoot their own Doctrine turn'd Rebels to God and Apostates from the Faith they have profest have Sacrilegiously and Traiterously taken up Arms against their Prince assaulted the Lord's Anointed  Resisted the Powers which are the Ordinance of God  deposed their lawful Sovereign broken their Allegiance and consequently  are a Parcel of Perjur'd Rebels  every jot as bad as the worst Roundhead Regicide and Rebel of the Year Forty One  What more or less can be said I profess I know not and am in great Expectation of something new in the Matter for I cannot find in all the Writings I have met with any thing to contradict it  The bringing Government and Obedience to the proper Circumstances of mutual Compact between King and People seems to me to be the only Method to unravel this Skein of entangl'd Principles the Nature of Government has made it the necessary Consequence of all Argument relating to Power and I could give Instances in all the Nations in the World that some time or other even the Right of Succession to Government  which must be as sacred as the Power  has been interrupted and limited by the People in case of Tyranny and Illegal Governing and every Nation  and this among the rest  have often times depos'd their Princes for the preservation of the State when either Incapacity for Government Tyrannical Usurpation or other MaleAdministration has been the Case  But this I think also needless here every one that is vers'd in History can read the numerous Examples in the Roman Grecian and Persian Histories  even Sacred Histories where  Kings were more particularly of Divine Right than any where  are full of them the Histories of  Spain Portugal France Lombardy  the Empires of  Germany  and  Muscovy  even the Papal Chair have suffer'd Convulsions and Revolutions the Deposing and Displacing their Sovereigns when the People's Good  which is and ever was the Soul the Center the End and the Cause of all Government  came to be in the Dispute  But to return to the Principles of the Two Parties we are now discoursing of the Whigs as before have always asserted this to be their Notion of Government and Governors and the Church of  England however some among them have topt an empty Notion upon them  have all along and  now at last once for all  own'd it by their Practice  That Kings when they descend to Tyranny  Dissolve the Bond and leave the Subject free  True Born Eng Man  pag    The Act for the further Limitation of the Crown past in the last Parliament and the Right of the People therein declar'd and recogniz'd I would ask my Opponent whose Act and Deed it was Will they say it was a Whiggish Act made by a Phanatical House of Commons  I dare say there was not Ten Dissenters in the House  let them descend with us into Particulars let them draw out a  Black List  of Members who in that Loyal Honest English Parliament gave their Hands to the last Settlement and Declaration of Right and let us  tell No  s  and put a Brand upon the  Phanaticks  among them  Will they tell us it was a  Phanatical Parliament  that set the Crown upon the Queen's Head I hope they will own Her Majesty and their Lordships the Bishops are part of the Church of  England  for if the Head and the principle Members are not we know not who are  Will they tell us that Sir  E S  Sir  B S  Sir  J B  Mr  Hy  Sir  Cr M    and a hundred more of that Side were Whigs and Commonwealth men  How comes it to pass in  England  that no Papist can inherit  Divine Right  ought to supercede all Precautions and the  young Prince of  Savoy not the  House of  Hannover ought to Reign with a  Non Obstante  to all Humane Limitation if all was from Heaven Where are our RightLineMen now Why truly the Reason is plain the  Church of  England  People of  England  a Church of  England  Parliament of  England have thought fit to declare that for the Good of the People  to which all Right of Succession to Power must give way because from them all power it self does derive  and by the Voice of that People in which Authority sufficient is legally grounded it is Unanimously agreed that  we will not have a Papist to Reign over us  All this is too plain to admit of a Dispute and now to me it seems preposterous why any Men shou'd keep up the Distinction between Parties as to Loyalty when indeed there is no manner of Difference in the Case  I have talk'd several times of bearing suffering being persecuted and oppress'd as the Dissenters in their time have been more than enough and again in their Turn the Church of  England  have been persecuted too for as I noted before they were once the  Schismaticks  the  Whigs  and the  Dissenters  Now I think 'tis not very foreign to my Argument to examine whether of the Two behav'd themselves under their Sufferings with the greatest Submission who show'd most absolute Obedience to their Superiors and who  first or oftnest Rebell'd  against their lawful Sovereign  The Protestants under  Henry  VIII were the first Dissenters they were kept under persecuted and put to death as Rebels and Schismaticks Now upon due search it will be sound that under the protection of two Protestant Queens Wives of King  Henry  VIII they had more than once form'd such Interest at Court and in the Kingdom as to begin to be formidable to the Popish powers then reigning and the Fall of the Lord  Cromwell  was thought a necessary Policy in King  Henry  to prevent the Plots of the  Phanatical Church of England Hereticks  a long Account of which may be read in the Life of that Prince  King  Edward  the VI a zealous and pious Prince made no scruple for the propagation of the Protestant Church of  England  of which he was the Glorious founder to set Aside the Lawful and Undisputed Succession of his own Sisters to Establish the Crown in the Lady  Jane Grey  who he knew wou'd carry on the Work of Reformation  There's an Instance of the Zeal for Succession in the Right Line in the First Protestant Head that ever the Church of  England  had  After this the Gospellers  that is the Church of  England  Protestants of  Suffolk having some sense of Injury done to the Princess  Mary  and willing to have the Succession go on in the Right Line provided they cou'd both preserve their Religion and Loyalty too capitulate with her and promise to stand by her provided she wou'd promise to preserve and make no Alteration in their Establish'd Church of  England  Here the Church of  England  Men own'd the Liberty of their Religion to be superior to their Loyalty to her and that they had a Right to Submit or not to Submit as their Liberty was or was not secure and accordingly Conditioned with her before they wou'd Acknowledge her to be their Queen  And we see how Heaven punish'd them for venturing on the Word of a Prince when their Religion and Liberty was at Stake  In this Queen's Time the Church having been again Suppressed and Popery Erected Sir  Thomas Wyatt  an Honest Church of  England  Protestant with a very good Body of Men took up Arms against their Lawful Prince for breaking her Word in Defence of  their Dear Religion Establish'd by Blessed King  Edward which were the very Words of the Manifesto they Publish'd The Londoners with Men sent by the Queen against them thought it no Treachery to Desert their Lawful Popish Queen and go over to their Protestant Church of  England  Brethren  We have nothing to do with the justification of this Fact 'tis sufficient that so it was▪ and that these were Protestants  of the Church of  England  in the first and purest Part of their Principles and let them justifie the Fact if they please  Queen  Elizabeth  Succeeds and then the Church of  England  shone in its Meridian Glory and then grew up some who aiming  as I said before  at a further Reformation and the Church refusing to hearken to it form'd a new party of Dissenters and those were call'd  Puritans  and since that  Phanaticks  Now I Challenge the Defender of this Cause to tell me one Dissoyal Act one Plot against the Government one Disturbance of the Civil Peace among these Dissenters from the begining of this Queen which was their own begining to the Reign of King  Charles  I which was a continu'd Term of Years and yet during this time they suffer'd all manner of Indignities Reproaches Finings Imprisonings Banishment Confiscations and Corporal Punishments  So that hitherto the Passive Obedience of the Dissenters hath far exceeded that of the Church of  England  These had but Five Years Oppression under Queen  Mary  and in that Five Years they once Capitulated with their Sovereign to make her Queen upon Conditions and once took Arms against her after she was Queen and  by that  I must always understand that if they did not Depose and Destroy her it was because they cou'd not  and if they had done it no doubt they had cause sufficient to justifie them before God and Man  The  Puritans  after this suffered all that their  too cruel Breth'en  of the Church of  England  laid upon them during Three tedious Reigns before they so much as made the least offer at doing themselves Justice and for Years together exercis'd that Passive Obedience which they never pretended to  A last they took Arms and when they did they did it to Purpose carried all before them subdued Monarchy cut off their King's Head and  all that  After the Restoration things began to return to their old Cha  e  and Years more the Dissenters endur'd a  other Egyptian Servitude were Persecuted Plunder'd Indicted Imprison'd plagu'd with Impositions Stigmatiz'd with a  Thousand Reproaches their Meetinghouses Demolish'd their Estates Confiscated their Persons Excommunicated and Anathamatis'd Sworn into Plots they never heard of and into Crimes they never Commited Dragg'd to Goals Gibbets and Scaffolds Pand the like  All this while Passive Obedience if there were any such thing  was found among them more than any where else for here was no Rebellions no Insurrection nor breaking of the Peace by the Dissenters notwithstanding all these Oppositions  After this comes King  James  the Second to the Crown and he turn'd the Scale and together with Invasion of Liberty falls upon the Church begins to Rifle her of her Trophies  for no Essentials had been touch'd  and how long did She bear it Not Years not  Years no not so many Months  What did she do Truly nothing but what she ought to have done Defend her Liberty and Religion by Force against unjust Invasion and Tyranny nothing but what all the Nations in the World have done and wou'd do again if they cou'd  The only Error we Charge upon the Church of  England  was setting up pretences of what they really wou'd not Practice crying up themselves for Fools when we knew they were Wiser Men calling themselves humble Slaves but when the Tryal came proving Stubborn Refractory  LibertyMongers  even as bad as the worst Whig or Phanatick of them all  For the Future then if a Humble Moderator might be permited to give Advice to the Gentlemen of the Church of  England  it shou'd be in these short and friendly Terms  Pray Gentlemen never be Imposed upon to pretend to more Loyalty and more slavish Principles than you intend to Practice  Never pretend to more Obedience than your Sovereign Requires Our Late King who I am not asham'd to show as a Patern for future Ages requir'd and Her present Majesty  without Affront to Her Majesty's Authority it may be said  requires no further Obedience from the People of  England  than the Laws of  England  requires  To Govern according to Law is a full Satisfaction to the People and to obey according to Law is a full Satisfaction to the Sovereign The Laws are the Test both of the Royal Authority and of the Subjects Obedience and to pretend to more Obedience than the Law requires is abusing your Prince and abusing your Selves  Never be asham'd to own with  your Brethren the Whigs  that you are willing to Submit to Authority but that you expect to be Govern'd according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm  Let the Scotch Motto be set upon your Liberties and according to your constant Practice  as well as ours  Let all Men know you design to make it Good  Nemo me Impune Lacessit  And as it really never was the Principle of the Church of  England nor were a hundreth Part of the Members of the Church tainted with it  so for the future 'tis hoped you will not suffer such to Mingle themselves among you or to Act in the Name of the Church of  England  who pretend to a Blind Absolute Obedience to Princes  And  Lastly  Gentlemen a little more Modesty to your Humble Servants you Protestant Brethren the Dissenters or Whigs I mean as to Matter of Loyalty For in Truth Gentlemen we do not see any Reason you have to Reproach us in that Matter you being in every Particular as faulty that way as your Neighbours  FINIS
