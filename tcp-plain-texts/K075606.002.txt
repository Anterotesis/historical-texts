BIOGRAPHICAL AND HISTORICAL  THE SECOND VOLUME  LONDON PRINTED BY AND FOR J NICHOLS RED LION PASSAGE FLEETSTREET MDCCLXXX  A SELECT COLLECTION OF MISCELLANY POEMS  THE ECLOGUES OF VIRGIL  ECLOGUE I  BY MR JOHN CARYLL  John Caryll  Esq  was probably a Sussex man and wrote two plays "The English Princess or the Death of Richard III " quarto and "Sir Salomon or the Cautious Coxcomb " quarto It may be conjectured that he was of the Roman Catholic persuasion being secretary to Queen Mary the wife of James the Second and one who followed the fortunes of his abdicating master How long he continued in this service is unknown but he was in England in the reign of Queen Anne and recommended the subject of Mr Pope's "Rape of the Lock" to that author who on its publication addressed it to him He was alive in and at that time must have been a very old man See three of his Letters in "Additions to Pope" vol II p R    MELIBOEUS  IN peaceful shades which aged oaks diffuse  You Tityrus enjoy your royal Muse  We leave our home and once our pleasant fields  The native swain to rude intruders yields  While you in songs your happy love proclaim  And every grove learns Amaryllis name  The reader may be pleased to observe that Virgil under the name of Tityrus personates himself newly saved by the favour of Augustus Caesar from the general calamity of his Mantuan neighbours whose lands were taken from them and divided amongst the veteran soldiers for having been dipt as may be presumed in the same guilt with their borderers of Cremo  a who in the civil wars joined with Cassius and Brutus These Mantuans are likewise personated by Meliboeus as also by Amaryllis the city of Rome by Galatea that of Mantua are represented The drift of this E  logue is to celebrate the munificence of Augustus towards Virgil whom he makes his tutelar God and the better to set this off he brings in Meliboeus  his Mantuan neighbours pathetically relating their own deplorable condition and at the same time magnifying the felicity of Tityrus This his exemption from the common calamity of his countrymen Virgil shadows over with the allegory of a slave recovering his liberty And because slaves did not commonly use to be infranchised till age had made them useless for labour to follow the trope he makes himself an old man as by the Candidior Barba and the Fortunate Senex sufficiently appears though in reality Virgil at that time was young and then first made known to Augustus by the recommendation of his verses and of his friends Varus and Maecenas CARYLL    TITYRUS  A God to me he always shall be so  O Meliboeus did this grace bestow  The choicest lamb which in my flock does feed  Shall each new moon upon his altar bleed  He every blessing on his creatures brings  By him the herd does graze by him the herdsman sings  MELIBOEUS  I envy not but I admire your fate  Which thus exempts you from our wretched state  Look on my goats that browze my kids that play  Driven hence myself these I must drive away  And this poor mother of a newfall'n pair  The herd's chief hope alas but my despair  Has left them in yon brakes beside the way  Expos'd to every beast and bird of prey  Had not some angry planet struck me blind  This dire calamity I had divin'd  'Twas oft foretold me by heaven's loudest voice  Rending our tallest oaks with dismal noise  Ravens spoke too though in a lower tone  And long from hollow trees were heard to groan  But say what God has Tityrus reliev'd  TITYRUS  The place call'd Rome I foolishly believ'd  Was like our Mantua where on marketdays  We drive our wellfed lambs the shepherd's praise  So whelps I knew so kids their dams express  And so the great I measur'd by the less  But other towns when you to her compare  They creeping shrubs to the tall cypress are  MELIBOEUS  What great occasion call'd you hence to Rome  TITYRUS  Freedom which came at last though slow to come  She came not till cold Winter did begin  And age some snow had sprinkled on my chin  Nor then till Galatea I forsook  For Amaryllis deign'd on me to look  No hope for liberty I must confess  No hope nor care of wealth did me possess  Whilst I with Galatea did remain  For though my flock her altars did maintain  Though often I had made my cheesepress groan  Largely to furnish our ungrateful town  Yet still with empty hands I trotted home  MELIBOEUS  I wonder'd Galatea whence should come  Thy sad complaints to heaven and why so long  Ungather'd on their trees thy apples hung  Absent was Tityrus thee every dale  Mountain and spring thee every tree did call  TITYRUS  What should I do I could not here be free  And only in that place could hope to see  A God propitious to my liberty  There I the heavenly youth did first behold  Whose monthly feast while solemnly I hold  My loaded altars never shall be cold  He heard my prayers go home he cry'd and feed  In peace your herd let forth your bulls for breed  MELIBOEUS  Happy old man thy farm untouch'd remains  And large enough though it may ask thy pains  To clear the stones and rushes cure by drains  Thy teeming ewes will no strange pastures try  No murrain fear from tainted company  Thrice happy swain guarded from Syrian beams  By sacred springs and longacquainted streams  Look on that bordering fence whose osier trees  Are fraught with flowers whose flowers are fraught with bees  How with their drowsy tone the whistling air  Your sleep to tempt a concert does prepare  At farther distance but with stronger lungs  The woodman joins with these his rustic songs  Stockdoves and murmuring turtles tune their throat  Those in a hoarser these a softer note  TITYRUS  Therefore the land and sea shall dwellers change  Fish on dry ground stags shall on water range  The Parthians shall commute their bounds with Francs  Those shall on Soane these drink on Tygris' banks  Ere I his godlike image from my heart  Suffer with black ingratitude to part  MELIBOEUS  But we must roam to parts remote unknown  Under the Torrid and the Frigid Zone  These frozen Scythia and parch'd Africk those  Cretan Oaxis others must inclose  Some 'mongst the utmost Britains are confin'd  Doom'd to an isle from all the world disjoin'd  Ah must I never more my country see  But in strange lands an endless exile be  Is my eternal banishment decreed  From my poor cottage rear'd with turf and reed  Must impious soldiers all these grounds possess  My fields of standing corn my fertile leyes  Did I for these barbarians plow and sow  What dire effects from civil discord flow  Graft pears O Meliboeus plant the vine  The fruit shall others be the labour thine  Farewell my goats a happy herd when mine  No more shall I in the refreshing shade  Of verdant grottoes by kind nature made  Behold you climbing on the mountain top  The flowery thyme and fragrant shrubs to crop  I part with every joy parting from you  Then farewell all the world verses and pipe adieu  TITYRUS  At least this night with me forget your care  Chesnuts and wellprest cheese shall be your fare  For now the mountain a long shade extends  And curling smoke from village tops ascends  ECLOGUE II  BY MR NAHUM TATE  Born about the middle of the reign of king Charles II in the kingdom of Ireland where he received his education He was made poet laureat to king William upon the death of Shadwell and held that place till the accession of George I on whom he lived to write the first birthday ode which is executed with unusual spirit He was a man of goodnature great probity and competent learning but so extremely modest that he was never able to make his fortune or to raise himself above necessity The earl of Dorset was his patron but the chief use he made of him was to screen himself from the persecution of his creditors He died in the Mint August and was succeeded in the laurel by Mr Eusden He was the author of nine dramatic performances a great number of poems and of a version of the Psalms in conjunction with Dr Nicholas Brady He was a man of wit and parts yet not thought to possess any very great genius as being deficient in what is its first characteristic namely invention Thus far the Biographical DictionaryHis miscellaneous poems are enumerated by Jacob who says Tate's poem on the Death of Queen Anne which was one of the last is  "one of the best poems he ever wrote"  His share in the "Second Part of Absalom and Achitophel" is far from inconsiderable and may be seen in the English Poets vol XIII p He published also "Memorials for the Learned collected out of eminent Authors in History c " vo and his "Proposal for regulating of the Stage and Stage Plays Feb " is among Bishop Gibson's MSS in the Lambeth Library N    A HOPELESS flame did Corydon destroy  The lov'd Alexis was his master's joy  No respite from his grief the shepherd knew  But daily walk'd where shady beeches grew  Where stretch'd on earth alone he thus complains  And in these accents tells the groves his pains  Cruel Alexis hast thou no remorse  Must I expire and have my songs no force  'Tis now high noon when herds to coverts run  The very lizards hide that love the sun  The reapers home to dinner now repair  While busy Thestylis provides both sauce and fare  Yet in the raging heat I search for thee  Heat only known to locusts and to me  Oh was it not much better to sustain  The angry days of Amaryllis' reign  And still be subject to Menalcas' sway  Though he more black than night and thou more fair than day  O lovely boy presume not on thy form  The fairest flowers are subject to a storm  Thou both disdain'st my person and my flame  Without so much as asking who I am  How rich in he  fers all as white as snow  Or cream with which they make my dairies flow  A thousand ewes within my pastures breed  And all the year upon new milk I feed  Besides the fam'd Amphion's songs I sing  That into Theban walls the stones did bring  Nor am I so deform'd for t'other day  When all the dreadful storm was blown away  As on the cliffs above the sea I stood  I view'd my image in the seagreen flood  And if I look as handsome all the year  To vie with Daphnis' self I would not fear  Ah would'st thou once in cottages delight  And love like me to wound the stag in flight  Where wholesome mallows grow our kids to drive  And in our songs with Pan himself to strive  From Pan the reed's first use the shepherd knew  'Tis Pan preserves the sheep and shepherd too  Disdain not then the tuneful reed to ply  Nor scorn the pastime of a deity  What task would not Amyntas undergo  For half the noble skill I offer you  A pipe with quills of various size I have  The legacy Damaetas dying gave  And said Possess thou this by right 'tis thine  Am  ntas then stood by and did repine  Besides two kids that I from danger bore  With streaks of lovely white enamel'd o'er  Who drain the bagging udder twice aday  And both at home for thy acceptance stay  Oft Thestylis for them has pin'd and she  Shall have them since thou scorn'st my gifts and me  Come to my arms thou lovely boy and take  The richest presents that the spring can make  See how the nymphs with lilies wait on thee  Fair Naïs scarce thyself so fair as she  With poppies daffadils and violets join'd  A garland for thy softer brow has twin'd  Myself with downy peaches will appear  And chesnuts Amaryllis' dainty cheer  I'll crop my laurel and my myrtle tree  Together bound because their sweets agree  Unbred thou art and homely Corydon  Nor will Alexis with thy gifts be won  Nor canst thou hope if gifts his mind could sway  That rich Iölas would to thee give way  Ah me while I fond wretch indulge my dreams  Winds blast my flowers and boars bemire my streams  Whom fly'st thou Gods themselves have had abode  In woods and Paris equal to a God  Let Pallas in the towns she built reside  To me a grove's worth all the world beside  Lions chace wolves those wolves a kid in prime  That very kid seeks heaths of flowering thyme  While Corydon pursues with equal flame  Alexis thee each has his several game  See how the ox unyok'd brings home the plough  The shades increasing as the sun goes low  Blest fields reliev'd by night's approach so soon  Love has no night 'tis always raging noon  Ah Corydon what frenzy fills thy breast  Thy vineyard lies half prun'd and half undrest  Luxurious sprouts shut out the ripening ray  The branches shorn not yet remov'd away  Recall thy senses and to work with speed  Of many utensils thou stand'st in need  Fall to thy labour quit the peevish boy  Time or some new desire shall this destroy  THE SAME ECLOGUE  The shepherd Corydon woos Alexis but finding he could not prevail he resolves to follow his affairs and forget his passion CREECH    BY MR THOMAS CREECH  See an account of Mr Creech vol I p N    ALEXIS  YOUNG Corydon hard fate an humble swain  Alexis lov'd the joy of all the plain  He lov'd but could not hope for love again  Yet every day through groves he walk'd alone  And vainly told the hills and woods his moan  Cruel Alexis can't my verses move  Hast thou no pity must I die for love  Just now the flocks pursue the shades and cool  And every lizard creeps into his hole  Brown Thestylis the weary reapers seeks  And brings their meat their onions and their leeks  And whilst I trace thy steps in every tree  And every bush poor insects sigh with me  Ah had it not been better to have borne  The peevish Amaryllis' frown and scorn  Or else Menalcas than this deep despair  Though he was black and thou art lovely fair  Ah charming beauty 'tis a fading grace  Trust not too much sweet youth to that fair face  Things are not always us'd that please the sight  We gather blackberries when we scorn the white  Thou dost despise me thou dost scorn my flame  Yet dost not know me nor how rich I am  A thousand tender lambs a thousand kine  A thousand goats I feed and all are mine  My dairy's full and my large herd affords  Summer and winter cream and milk and curds  I pipe as well as when through Theban plains  Amphion fed his flocks or charm'd the swains  Nor is my face so mean I lately stood  And view'd my figure in the quiet flood  And think myself though it were judg'd by you  As fair as Daphnis if that glass be true  Oh that with me thee humble plains would please  The quiet fields and lowly cottages  Oh that with me you'd live and hunt the hare  Or drive the kids or spread the fowling snare  Then we would sing like Pan in shady groves  Pan taught us pipes and Pan our art approves  Pan both the sheep and harmless shepherd loves  Nor must you think the pipe too mean for you  To learn to pipe what won't Amyntas do  I have a pipe wellseason'd brown and try'd  Which good Damaetas left me when he died  He said Here take it for a legacy  Thou art my second it belongs to thee  He said and dull Amyntas envy'd me  Besides I found two wanton kids at play  In yonder vale and those I brought away  Young sportive creatures and of spotted hue  Which suckle twice aday I keep for you  These Thestylis hath begg'd and begg'd in vain  But now they 're hers since you my gifts disdain  Come lovely boy the nymphs their baskets fill  With poppy violet and daffadil  The rose and thousand other fragrant flowers  To please thy senses in thy softest hours  These Naïs gathers to delight my boy  Come dear Alexis be no longer coy  I'll seek for chesnuts too in every grove  Such as my Amaryllis us'd to love  The glossy plumbs and juicy pears I'll bring  Delightful all and many a pretty thing  The laurel and the neighbouring myrtle tree  Confus'dly planted 'cause they both agree  And prove more sweet shall send their boughs to thee  Ah Corydon thou art a foolish swain  And coy Alexis doth thy gifts disdain  Or if gifts could prevail if gifts could woo  Iölas can present him more than you  What doth the madman mean he idly brings  Storms on his flowers and boars into his springs  Ah whom dost thou avoid whom fly the Gods  And charming Paris too have liv'd in woods  Let Pallas she whose art first rais'd a town  Live there let us delight in woods alone  The boar the wolf the wolf the kid pursues  The kid her thyme as fast as t' other does  Alexis Corydon and him alone  Each hath his game and each pursues his own  Look how the wearied ox brings home the plough  The sun declines and shades are doubled now  And yet my passion nor my cares remove  Love burns me still what flame so fierce as Love  Ah Corydon what fury's this of thine  On yonder elm there hangs thy halfprun'd vine  Come rather mind thy useful work prepare  Thy harvest baskets and make those thy care  Come mind thy plough and thou shalt quickly find  Another if Alexis proves unkind  ECLOGUE III OR PALAEMON  Menalcas and Dametas upbraid each other with their faults by and by they challenge one another and pipe for a wager Palaemon coming that way by chance is chosen judge he hears them pipe but cannot determine the controversy CREECH    BY THE SAME  MENALCAS  TELL me Dametas tell whose sheep these are  DAMETAS  Aegon's for Aegon gave them to my care  MENALCAS  Whilst he Neaera courts but courts in vain  And fears that I shall prove the happier swain  Poor sheep whilst he his hopeless love pursues  Here twice an hour his servant milks his ewes  The flock is drain'd the lambkins swigg the teat  But find no moisture and then idly bleat  DAMETAS  No more of that Menalcas I could tell  And you know what for I remember well  I know when where and what the fool design'd  And what had happen'd but the nymphs were kind  MENALCAS  Twas then perhaps when some observ'd the clown  Spoil Mico's vines and cut his olives down  DAMETAS  Or rather when where those old beeches grow  You broke young Daphnis' arrows and his bow  You saw them given to the lovely boy  Illnatur'd you and envy'd at his joy  But hopes of sweet revenge thy life supply'd  And hadst thou not done mischief thou hadst died  MENALCAS  What will not master shepherds dare to do  When their base slaves pretend so much as you  Did not I see not I you pilfering for  When you lay close and snapt rich Damon's goat  His spochdog bark'd I cry'd The robber see  Guard well your flock you skulkt behind a tree  DAMETAS  I tell thee shepherd 'twas before my own  We two pip'd for him and I fairly won  This he would own and gave me cause to boast  Though he refus'd to pay the goat he lost  MENALCAS  You pipe with him thou never hadst a pipe  Well join'd with wax and fitted to the lip  But under hedges to the longear'd rout  Wert wont dull fool to toot a screeching note  DAMETAS  And shall we have a tryal of our skill  I'll lay this heifer 'twill be worth your while  Two calves she suckles and yet twice aday  She fills two pails now speak what dare you lay  MENALCAS  I cannot stake down any of my flock  My fold is little and but small my stock  Besides my father's covetously cross  My stepdame curst and they will find the loss  For both strict eyes o'er all my actions keep  One counts my kids and both twice count my sheep  But yet I'll lay what you must grant as good  Since you will lose two cups  This passage with Nestor's cup in Homer is admirably illustrated in Mr Clarke's Connexion of Clarke on Coins p N  of beechen wood  Alcimedon made them 'tis a work divine  And round the brim ripe grapes and ivy twine  So curiously he hits the various shapes  And with pale ivy cloaths the blushing grapes  It doth my eyes and all my friends delight  I'm sure your mouth must water at the sight  Within two figures neatly carv'd appear  Conon and he who was't that made the sphere  And shew'd the various seasons of the year  What time to shear our sheep what time to plough  'Twas never us'd I kept it clean till now  DAMETAS  Aleimedon too made me two beechen pots  And round the handles wrought smooth ivy knots  Orpheus within and following woods around  With bended tops seem listening to the sound  I never us'd them never brought them forth  But to my h  ifer these are little worth  MENALCAS  I'll pay thee off I'm ready come let's try  And he shall be our judge that next comes by  See 'tis Palaemon come I'll ne'er give o'er  Till thou shalt never dare to challenge more  DAMETAS  Begin I'll not refuse the skilful'st swain  I scorn to turn my back for any man  I know myself but pray judicious friend  'Tis no small matter carefully attend  PALAEMON  Since we have chosen a convenient place  Since woods are cloath'd with leaves the fields with grass  The trees with fruit the year seems fine and gay  Demetas first then next Menalcas play  By turns for verse the Muses love by turns  DAMETAS  My Muse begin with Jove all's full of Jove  The God loves me and doth my verses love  MENALCAS  And Phoebus mine on Phoebus I'll bestow  The blushing hyacinth and laurel bough  DAMETAS  Sly Galatea drives me o'er the green  And apples throws then hides yet would be seen  MENALCAS  But my Amyntas doth his passion tell  Our dogs scarce know my Delia half so well  DAMETAS  I'll have a gift for Phyllis cre 'tis long  I know where stockdoves build I'll take their young  MENALCAS  I pluck'd my boy fine pears I sent him ten  'Twas all I had but soon I'll send again  DAMETAS  What things my nymph did speak what tales of love  Winds bear their musick to the Gods above  MENALCAS  What boots it boy you not contemn my flame  Since whilst I hold the net you hunt the game  DAMETAS  My birthday comes send Phyllis quickly home  But at my shearingtime Iölas come  MENALCAS  And I love Phyllis for her charms excell  She sigh'd Farewell dear youth a long farewell  DAMETAS  Wolves ruin flocks wind trees when newly blown  Storms corn and me my Amaryllis' frown  MENALCAS  D  w swells the corn kids browze the tender tree  The goats love sallow  A species of the willowtree N  fair Amyntas me  DAMETAS  Mine Pollio loves though 'tis a rustic song  Muse feed a steer for him that reads thee long  MENALCAS  Nay Pollio writes and at the king's command  Muse feed the bulls that push and spurn the sand  DAMETAS  Let Pollio have whate'er thy wish provokes  Myrrh from his thorns and honey from his oaks  MENALCAS  He that loves Bavius' songs may fancy thine  The same may couple wolves and shear his swin    DAMETAS  Ye boys that pluck the beauties of the spring  Fly fly a snake lies hid and shoots a sting  MENALCAS  Beware the stream drive not the sheep too nigh  The bank may fail the rain is hardly dry  DAMETAS  Kids from the river drive and sling your hook  Anon I'll wash them in the shallow brook  MENALCAS  Drive to the shades when milk is drain'd by heat  In vain the milkmaid stroaks an empty teat  DAMETAS  How lean my bull is in my fruitful field  Love has the herd and Love the herdsman kill'd  MENALCAS  Sure these feel none of Love's devouring flames  Mere skin and bone and yet they drain the dams  Ah me what sorceress has bewitch'd my lambs  DAMETAS  Tell me where heaven is just three inches broad  And I'll believe thee prophet or a God  MENALCAS  Tell me where names of kings in rising flowers  Are writ and grow and Phyllis shall be yours  PALAEMON  I cannot judge which youth does most excell  For you deserve the steer and he as well  Rest equal happy both and all that prove  A bitter or else fear a pleasing love  But my work calls let's break the meeting off  Boys shut your streams the fields have drunk enough  ⁂Eclogue IV by Mr

N  MELIBOEUS ECLOGUE VII  BY MR WILLIAM ADAMS  This gentleman's memory is preserved by "Fifteen Discourses occasionally delivered before the University of Oxford By William Adams MA late student of Christ Church and rector of Staunton upon Wye in Herefordshire Published by Henry Sacheverell DD " This volume of which a second edition was published the same year is inscribed to Richard Hopton esq knight of the shire for the county of Hereford to whom Mr Adams had been tutor at Christ Church an employment be appears to have been well qualified for discharging In his younger years he gave many admirable specimens of his polite genius in his accurate performances in Poetry and Oratory and had afterwards the honour to be chosen his master Dr Busby's first Catachetical Lecturer in Oxford To answer the pious and charitable design of that great founder of learning he bent the whole course of his studies to Divinity of which he is said to have drawn out a comprehensive and useful plan which at his death he directed his executors to destroy with all his MSS except the volume of Discourses which appeared by his express injunction In the Catalogue of Oxford Graduates there are  three  ChristChurch men of the name of  Will  am Adams  each of them MA and all nearly of the same standing N    This Eclogue is wholly pastoral and consists of the contention of two shepherds Thyrsis and Corydon to the hearing of which Mcliboeus was invited by Daphnis and thus relates it  WHILE Daphnis sate beneath a whispering shade  Thyrsis and Corydon together fed  Their mingling flocks his sheep with softest wool  Were cloath'd his goats of sweetest milk were full  Both in the beauteous spring of blooming youth  The worthy pride of blest Arcadia both  Each with like art his tuneful voice could raise  Each answer readily in rural lays  Hither the father of my flock had stray'd  While shelters I for my young myrtles made  Here I fair Daphnis saw when me he spy'd  Come hither quickly gentle youth he cry'd  Your goat and kids are safe O seek not those  But if you've leisure in this shade repose  Hither to water the full heifers tend  When lengthening shadows from the hills descend  Mincius with reeds here interweaves his bounds  And from that sacred oak a busy swarm resounds  What should I do Nor was Alcippe there  Nor Phyllis who might of my lambs take care  Yet to my business I their sports prefer  For the two swains with great ambition strove  Who best could tune his reed or best could sing his love  Alternate verse their ready Muses chose  In verse alternate each quick fancy flows  These sang young Corydon young Thyrsis those  CORYDON  Ye muchlov'd Muses such a verse bestow  As does from Codrus my lov'd Codrus flow  Or if all can't obtain the gift divine  My pipe I'll consecrate on yonder pine  THYRSIS  Y' Arcadian swains with ivy wreaths adorn  Your youth that Codrus may with spite be torn  Or if he praise too much apply some charm  Lest his ill tongue your future poet harm  CORYDON  These branches of a stag this wildboar's head  By little M  con's on thy altar laid  If this continue Delia thou shalt stand  Of smoothest marble by the skilful'st hand  THYRSIS  This milk these cakes Priapus every year  Expect a little garden is thy care  Thou 'rt marble now but if more land I hold  If my flock thrive thou shalt be made of gold  CORYDON  O Galatea sweet as Hybla's rhyme  White as more white than swans are in their prime  Come when the herds shall to their stalls repair  O come if e'er thy Corydon's thy care  THYRSIS  O may I harsh as bitterest herbs appear  Rough as wild myrtle vile as seaweeds are  If years seem longer than this tedious day  Haste home my glutton herd haste haste away  CORYDON  Ye mossy springs ye pastures softer far  Than thoughtless hours of sweetest slumbers are  Ye shades protect my flock the heats are near  On the glad vines the swelling buds appear  THYRSIS  Here on my hearth a constant flame does play  And the fat vapour paints the roof each day  Here we as much regard the cold northwind  As streams their banks or wolves do number mind  CORYDON  Look how the trees rejoice in comely pride  While their ripe fruit lies scatter'd on each side  All nature smiles but if Alexis stay  From our sad hills the rivers weep away  THYRSIS  The dying grass with sickly air does fade  No field's unparch'd no vines our hills do shade  But if my Phyllis come all sprouts again  And bounteous Jove descends in kindly rain  CORYDON  Bacchus the vine the laurel Phoebus loves  Fair Venus cherishes the myrtle groves  Phyllis the hazels loves while Phyllis loves that tree  Myrtles and laurels of less fame shall be  THYRSIS  The lofty ash is glory of the woods  The pine of gardens poplar of the floods  If oft thy swain fair Lycidas thou see  To thee the ash shall yield the pine to thee  MELIBOEUS  These I remember well  While vanquish'd Thyrsis did contend in vain  Thence Corydon young Corydon does reign  The best the sweetest on our wondering plain  PHARMACEUTRIA  Another translation of this Eclogue is in vol I p by Mr W Bowles N  ECLOGUE VIII  BY MR STAFFORD  Most probably Mr Richard Stafford of Magdalen Hall Oxford where he took the degree of BA Oct and afterwards of MA  "He went to one of the Temples to study the Law and is now a frequent writer"  Wood Fa  i II Wood mentions only one of his pieces "Of Happiness" c to There was a thin vo volume of poems published in by a Mr  P  Stafford N    SAD Damon's and Alphesiboeus' Muse  I sing to hear whose notes the herds refuse  Their needful food the salvage lynxes gaze  And stopping streams their pressing waters raise  I sing sad Damon's and Alphesiboeus' lays  And thou whatever part is blest with thee  The rough Timavus or Illyrian sea  Smile on my verse is there in fate an hour  To swell my numbers with my emperour  There is and to the world there shall be known  A verse that Sophocles might deign to own  Amidst the laurels on thy front divine  Permit my humble ivy wreath to twine  Thine was my earliest Muse my latest shall be thine  Night scarce was past the morn was yet so new  And wellpleas'd herds yet roll'd upon the dew  When Damon stretch'd beneath an olive lay  And sung Rise Lucifer and bring the day  Rise rise while Nisa's falsehood I deplore  And call those Gods to whom she vainly swore  To hear my sad expiring Muse and me  To Maenalus my pipes and Muse tune all your harmony  On Maenalus stand everechoing groves  Still trusted with the harmless shepherds loves  Here Pan resides who first made reeds and verse agree  To Maenalus my pipes and Muse tune all your harmony  Mopsus is Nisa's choice how just are lovers fears  Now mares with griffins join and following years  Shall see the hound and deer drink at a spring  O worthy bridegroom light thy torch and fling  The nuts see modest Hesper quits the sky  To Maenalus my pipes and Muse tune all your harmony  O happy nymph blest in a wondrous choice  For Mopsus you contemn'd my verse and voice  For him my beard was shaggy in your eye  For him you laugh'd at every deity  To Maenalus my pipes and Muse tune all your harmony  When first I saw thee young and charming too  'Twas in the fences where our apples grew  My thirteenth year was downy on my chin  And hardly could my hands the lowest branches win  How did I gaze how did I gazing die  To Maenalus my pipes and Muse tune all your harmony  I know thee Love on mountains thou wast bred  And Thracian rocks thy infant fury fed  Hardsoul'd and not of human progeny  To Maenalus my pipes and Muse tune all your harmony  Love taught the cruel mother to imbrue  Her hands in blood 'twas Love her children slew  Was she more cruel or more impious he  An impious child was Love a cruel mother she  To Maenalus my pipes and Muse tune all your harmony  Now let the lamb and wolf no more be foes  Let oaks bear peaches and the pine the rose  From reeds and thistles balm and amber spring  And owls and daws provoke the swan to sing  Let Tityrus in woods with Orpheus vie  And soft Arion on the waves defy  To Maenalus my pipes and Muse tune all your harmony  Let all be Chaos now farewell ye woods  From you high cliff I'll plunge into the floods  O Nisa take this dismal legacy  Now cease my pipes and Muse cease all your harmony  Thus he Alphesiboeus' song rehearse  Ye sacred Nine above my rural verse  Bring water altars bind wi  h mystic bands  Burn gums and vervain and lift high the wands  We'll mutter sacred magic till it  rms  My icy swain 'tis verse we want  my charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  By charms compell'd the trembling moon descends  And Circe chang'd by charms Ulysses' friends  By charms the serpent burst ye powerful charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  Behold his image with three sillets bound  Which thrice I drag the sacred altars round  Unequal numbers please the Gods my charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  Three knots of treblecolour'd silk we tie  Haste Amaryllis knit them instantly  And say These Venus are thy chains my charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  Just as before this fire the wax and clay  One melts one hardens let him waste away  Strew corn and salt and burn those leaves of bay  I burn these leaves but he burns me my charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  Let Daphnis rage as when the bellowing kind  Mad with desire run round the woods to find  Their mates when tir'd their trembling limbs they lay  Near some cool stream nor mind the setting day  Thus let him rage unpitied too my charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  These garments once were my persidious swain's  Which to the earth I cast ah dear remains  Ye owe my Daphnis to his nymph my charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  Moeris himself these herbs from Pontus brought  Pontus for every noble poison sought  Aided by these he now a wolf becomes  Now draws the buried stalking from their tombs  The corn from field to field transports my charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  Cast o'er your head the ashes in the brook  Cast backward o'er your head nor turn your look  I strive but Gods and art he slights my charms  Return return return my Daphnis to my arms  Behold new flames from the dead ashes rise  Blest be the omen blest the prodigies  For Hylax barks shall we believe our eyes  Or do we lovers dream cease cease my charms  My Daphnis comes he comes he flies into my arms  GALLUS ECLOGUE X  BY THE SAME  SICILIAN nymph assist my mournful strains  The last I sing in rural notes to swains  Grant then a verse so tender and so true  As even Lycoris may with pity view  Who can deny a verse to grief and Gallus due  So when thy waters pass beneath the tide  Secure from briny mixture may they glide  Begin my Gallus' love and hapless vows  While on the tender twigs the cattle browze  Nothing is deaf woods listen while we sing  And echoing groves resound and mountains ring  Ye Naiades what held you from his aid  When to unpitied flames he was betray'd  Nor Aganippe tempted you away  Nor was Parnassus guilty of your stay  The bays whose honours he so long had kept  The lofty bays and humble herbage wept  When stretch'd beneath a rock he sigh'd alone  The mountain pines and Maenalus did groan  And cold Lycaeus wept from every stone  His flock surrounded him nor think thy fame  Impair'd great poet by a shepherd's name  Ere thou and I our sheep to pastures led  His flocks the Goddesslov'd Adonis fed  The shepherds came the sluggish neatherd swains  And swineherds reeking from their mast and grains  All ask'd from whence this frenzy Phoebus came  To see his poet Phoebus ask'd the same  And is he cry'd that cruel nymph thy care  Who flying thee can for thy rival dare  The frosts and snow and all the frightful forms of war  Sylvanus came thy fortune to deplore  A wreath of lilies on his head he wore  Pan came and wondering we beheld him too  His skin all dy'd of a vermilion hue  He cry'd What mad designs dost thou pursue  Nor satisfy'd with dew the grass appears  With browze the kids nor cruel love with tears  When thus and sorrow melted in his eyes  Gallus to his Arcadian friends replies  Ye gentle swains sing to the rocks my moan  For you Arcadian swains should sing alone  How calm a rest my wearied ghost would have  If you adorn'd my love and mourn'd my grave  O that your birth and business had been mine  To feed a flock or press the swelling vine  Had Phyllis or had Galatea been  My love or any maid upon the green  What if her face the nutbrown livery wear  Are violets not sweet because not fair  Secure in that unenvied state among  The poplars I my careless limbs had flung  Phyllis had made me wreaths and Galatea sung  Behold fair nymph what bliss the country yields  The flowery meads the purling streams the laughing fields  Next all the pleasures of the forest see  Where I could melt away my years with thee  But furious Love denies me soft repose  And hurls me on the pointed spears of foes  While thou but ah that I should find it so  Without thy Gallus for thy guide dost go  Through all the German colds and Alpine snow  Yet flying me no hardship may'st thou meet  Nor snow nor ice offend those tender feet  But let me run to desarts and rehearse  On my Sicilian reeds Euphorion's verse  Ev'n in the dens of monsters let me lie  Those I can tame but not your cruelty  On smoothest rinds of trees I'll carve my woe  And as the rinds increase the love shall grow  Then mixt with nymphs on Maenalus resort  I'll make the boar my danger and my sport  When from the vales the jolly cry resounds  What rain or cold shall keep me from my hounds  Methinks my ears the sprightly concert fills  I seem to bound through woods and mount o'er hills  My arm of a Cydonian javelin seiz'd  As if by this my madness could be eas'd  Or by our mortal woes the cruel God appeas'd  My frenzy changes now and nymphs and verse I hate  And woods for ah what toil can stubborn love abate  Should we to drink the frozen Hebrus go  And shiver in the cold Sithonian snow  Or to the swarthy Ethiops clime remove  Parch'd all below and burning all above  Ev'n there would Love o'ercome then let us yield to Love  Let this sad lay suffice by sorrow breath'd  While bending twigs I into baskets wreath'd  My rural numbers in their homely guise  Gallus because they came from me will prize  Gallus whose growing love my breast does rend  As shooting trees the bursting bark distend  Now rise for night and dew the fields invade  And juniper is an unwholsome shade  Blasts kill the corn by night and flowers with mildew fade  Bright Hesper twinkles from afar away  My kids for you have had a feast today  VIRGIL'S LAST ECLOGUE  TRANSLATED OR RATHER IMITATED AT THE DESIRE OF LADY GIFFARD  Sir William's favourite sister a lady of uncommon merit and goodness and companion to him in all his foreign embassies She was addressed by Sir W Giffard who dying during the courtship he begged the young lady to bear his name and to enable him to leave her his estate as a proof of his affection she was married to him on his deathbed by which means she became entitled to his large estate and that she might not shew herself unworthy of his esteem she made a vow though in her tender youth never to marry any other man but to live his widow and this she faithfully performed She died in at the age of An oldfashioned monument with an epitaph which seems to have been designed by Sir W Temple in his lifetime is erected in Westminster Abbey  "To himself and those most dear to him to his most beloved daughter to his most beloved wife and to Martha Giffard his best of sisters"  N      BY SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE BART  "Sir William Temple was descended from a younger branch of a family of that name seated at Temple Hall in Leicestershire His grandfather was secretary to the unfortunate earl of Essex favourite of queen Elizabeth and his father was Sir John Temple master of the rolls in Ireland He was as much above the common level of politicians as he was above the herd of authors He displayed his great abilities in several important treaties and negotiations the most considerable of which was the bringing to a happy conclusion the famous triple league betwixt England Sweden and Holland This alliance though the most prudent step ever taken by Charles II was soon defeated by the Cabal a set of men who were as great a disgrace to their country as Sir William Temple was an honour to it He was strongly solicited to go over to Holland in order to break that league which he had a little before concluded but he was too much a patriot to yield to any solicitations of that kind and chose to retire into the country where he was much better employed in writing his excellent "Observations on the United Provinces" and other elegant works Few authors have been more read or more justly admired than Sir William Temple He displays his great knowledge of book  and men in an elegant easy and negligent style much like the language of genteel conversation His vanity ofter prompts him to speak of himself but he and Montaigne a  never more pleasing than when they dwell on that difficul  subject It is a happy circumstance for his readers that s  polite and learned a writer was also a vain one they a  great gainers by his foible He is sometimes inaccurate but his inaccuracies escape us unseen or are very little attended to We can easily forgive a little incorrectness o  drawing in the paintings of a Correggio when there is so m  ch beauty and grace t  atone for it He died in January in his seventieth year"  Thus far from GrangerSir William's Posthumous Works were published by Dr Swift who is supposed to have written the Life A good edition  them was printed in in four volumes vo Th  mber of his poems being small he is but little known a  a poet though surely some of them are very beautiful I have by accident a thin volume in vo without title or date with MS corrections formerly belonging to Lady Giffard which there is great reason to believe was printed only for private use and never published whence the reader will be gratified with some poems which may not improperly be called original N  ONE labour more O Arethusa yield  Before I leave the shepherds and the field  Some verses to my Gallus ere we part  Such as may one day break Lycoris' heart  As she did his who can refuse a song  To one that lov'd so well and dy'd so young  So may'st thou thy belov'd Alpheus please  When thou creep'st under the Sicanian seas  Begin and sing Gallus' unhappy fires  Whilst yonder goat to yonder branch aspires  Out of his reach We sing not to the deaf  An answer comes from every trembling leaf  What woods what forests had intic'd your stay  Ye Naiades why came ye not away  When Gallus dy'd by an unworthy flame  Parnassus knew and lov'd too well his name  To stop your course nor could your hasty flight  Be stay'd by Pindus which was his delight  Him the fresh laurels him the lowly heath  Bewail'd with dewy tears his parting breath  Made lofty Maenalus hang his piny head  Lycaean marbles wept when he was dead  Under a lonely tree he lay and pin'd  His flock about him feeding on the wind  As he on love such kind and gentle sheep  Ev'n fair Adonis would be proud to keep  There came the shepherds there the weary hinds  Thither Menalcas parch'd with frosts and winds  All ask him whence for whom this fatal love  Apollo came his arts and herbs to prove  Why Gallus why so fond he says thy flame  Thy care Lycoris is another's game  For him she sighs and raves him she pursues  Thorough the midday heats and morning dews  Over the snowy cliffs and frozen streams  Through noisy camps Up Gallus leave thy dreams  She has left thee Still lay the drooping swain  Hanging his mournful head Phoebus in vain  Offers his herbs employs his counsel here  'Tis all refus'd or answer'd with a tear  What shakes the branches what makes all the trees  Begin to bow their heads the goats their knees  Oh 'tis Sylvanus with his mossy beard  And leafy crown attended by a herd  Of woodborn fatyrs see he shakes his spear  A green young oak the tallest of the year  Pan the A  cadian God forsook the plains  Mov'd with the story of his Gallus' pains  We saw him come with oatenpipe in hand  Painted with berries juice we saw him stand  And gaze upon his shepherd's bathing eyes  And what no end no end of grief he cries  Love little minds all thy consuming care  Or restless thoughts they are his daily fare  Nor cruel Love with tears nor grass with showers  Nor goats with tender sprouts nor bees with flowers  Are ever satisfy'd Thus spoke the God  And touch'd the shepherd with his hazle rod  He sorrowslain seem'd to revive and said  But yet Arcadians is my grief allay'd  To think that in these woods and hills and plains  When I am silent in the grave your swains  Shall sing my loves Arcadian swains inspir'd  By Phoebus Oh how gently shall these tir'd  And fainting limbs repose in endless sleep  While your sweet notes my love immortal keep  Would it had pleas'd the Gods I had been born  Just one of you and taught to wind a horn  Or wield a hook or prune a branching vine  And known no other love but Phyllis thine  Or thine Amyntas what though both are brown  So are the nuts and berries on the down  Amongst the vines the willows and the springs  Phyllis makes garlands and Amyntas sings  No cruel absence calls my love away  Farther than bleating sheep can go astray  Here my Lycoris here are shady groves  Here fountains cool and meadows soft our loves  And lives may here together wear and end  O the true joys of such a fate and friend  I now am hurried by severe commands  Into remotest parts among the bands  Of armed troops there by my foes pursued  Here by my friends but still by Love subdued  Thou far from home and me art wandering o'er  The Alpine snows the farthest western shore  The frozen Rhine When are we like to meet  Ah gently gently lest thy tender feet  Be cut with ice Cover thy lovely arms  The northern cold relents not at their charms  Away I 'll go into some shady bowers  And sing the songs I made in happier hours  And charm my woes How can I better chuse  Than among wildest woods myself to lose  And carve our loves upon the tender trees  There they will thrive See how my love agrees  With the young plants look how they grow together  In spight of absence and in spight of weather  Meanwhile I 'll climb that rock and ramble o'er  Yon woody hill I'll chace the grizly boar  I 'll find Diana's and her nymphs resort  No frosts no storms shall slack my eager sport  Methinks I 'm wandering all about the rocks  And hollowsounding woods look how my locks  Are torn with boughs and thorns my shafts are gone  My legs are tir'd and all my sport is done  Alas this is no cure for my disease  Nor can our toils that cruel God appease  Now neither nymphs nor songs can please me more  Nor hollow woods nor yet the chaf  d boar  No sport no labour can divert my grief  Without Lycoris there is no relief  Though I should drink up Heber's icy streams  Or Scythian snows yet still her fiery beams  Would scorch me up Whatever we can prove  Love conquers all and we must yield to Love  VIRGIL'S O FORTUNATOS c  Georg II seqq  TRANSLATED OR RATHER IMITATED UPON THE DESIRE OF MY LADY TEMPLE  BY THE SAME NOT IN HIS WORKS  O HAPPY swains if their own good they knew  Whom far from jarring arms the just and due  Returns of wellfraught fields with easy fare  Supply and chearful heavens with healthy air  What though no aged title grace the stock  What though no troops of early waiters flock  To the proud gates and with officious fear  First beg the porter's then the master's ear  What though no stately pile amuse the eye  Of every gazer though no scarlet dye  Stain the soft native whiteness of the wool  Nor greedy painter ever rob the full  Untainted bowls of liquid olives' juice  Destin'd for altars and for tables use  Though the bright dawn of gold be not begun  And nothing shine about the house but sun  Yet secure peace reward of harmless life  Yet various sorts of treasures free from strife  Or envy careless leisure spacious plains  Cool shades and flowery walks along the veins  Of branched streams yet soft and fearless sleep  Amidst the tender bleating of the sheep  Want not there hollow gloomy groves appear  And wilder thickets where the staring deer  Dare close their eyes there youth to homely fare  And patient labour age to chearful care  Accustom'd sacred rites and humble fear  Of Gods above fair Truth and Justice there  Trod their last footsteps when they left the earth  Which to a thousand mischiefs gave a birth  For me the Muses are my first desire  Whose gentle favour can with holy fire  Guide to great Nature's deep mysterious cells  Through paths untrac'd 'tis the chaste Muse that tel  s  Poor groveling mortals how the stars above  Some keep their station some unwearied move  Through the vast azure plains and what obscures  The midday sun how the faint moon endures  So many changes and so many fears  As by the paleness of her face appears  What shakes the bowels of the groaning earth  What gives the thunder what the hail a birth  Why the winds sometimes whistle sometimes roar  What makes the raging waves now brave it o'er  The towering cliffs now calmly backwards creep  Into the spacious bosom of the deep  But if cold blood about my heart shall damp  This noble heat of rifling Nature's camp  Then give me shady groves and purling streams  And airy downs then far from scorching beams  Of envy noise or cities busy fry  Careless and nameless let me live and die  Oh where where are the fields the waving veins  Of gentle mounts amidst the smoother plains  The nymphs fair walks Oh for the shady vale  Of some proud hill some fresh reviving gale  Oh who will lead me Whither shall I run  To find the woods and shroud me from the sun  Happy the man that Gods and causes knows  Nature's and Reason's laws that scorns the blows  Of Fate or Chance lives without smiles or tears  Above fond hopes above distracting fears  Happy the swain that knows no higher powers  Than Pan or old Sylvanus and the bowers  Of rural nymphs so oft by satires griev'd  All this unseen perhaps but well believ'd  Him move not princes frowns nor peoples heats  Nor faithless civil jars nor foreign threats  Not Rome's affairs nor transitory crowns  The fall of princes or the rise of clowns  All 's one to him nor grieves he at the sad  Events he hears nor envies at the glad  What fruits the laden boughs the willing fields  What pleasures innocence and freedom yields  He safely gathers neither skills the feat  Of arms or laws nor labours but to eat  Some rove through unknown seas with swelling sails  Some wait on courts and the uncertain gales  Of princes favour others led by charms  Of greedy honour follow fatal arms  Some mount the pulpit others ply the bar  And make the arts of peace the arts of war  One hugs his brooding bags and feels the woe  He fears and treats himself worse than his foe  Another breaks the banks lets all run out  But to be talk'd and gaz'd on by the rout  Some sow sedition blow up civil broils  And venture exile death and endless toils  Only to sleep in scarlet drink in gold  Though other fair pretences may be told  Meanwhile the swain rises at early dawn  And turns his fallow or breaks up the lawn  With crooked plough buries the hopeful grain  Folds his lov'd flock and lays a wily train  For their old foe prunes the luxurious vine  Pleas'd with the thoughts of the next winter's wine  Visits the lowing herd these for the pale  Those for the yoke designs the rest for sale  Each season of the sliding year his pains  Divides each season shares his equal gains  The youthful spring scatters the tender lambs  About the fields the parching summer crams  His spacious barns Bacchus the autumn crowns  And fair Pomona when the winter frowns  And curls his rugged brow with hoary frost  Then are his feasts then thoughts and cares are lost  In friendly bowls then he receives the hire  Of his year's labour by a chearful fire  Or else abroad he tries the arts and toils  Of war with trusty dog and spear he foils  The grizly boar with traps and trains and nets  The greedy wolf the wily fox besets  At home he leaves at home he finds a wife  Sharer of all that's good or bad in life  Prudent and chaste yet gentle easy kind  Much in his eye and always of his mind  He feeds no others children for his own  These have his kisses these his cares he's known  Little abroad and less desires to know  Friend to himself to no man else a foe  Easy his labours harmless are his plays  Just are his deeds healthy and long his days  His end nor wish'd nor fear'd he knows no odds  'Tween life and death but ev'n as please the Gods  Among such swains Saturn the sceptre bore  Such customs made the golden age before  Trumpets were heard or swords seen to decide  Quar  els of lust or avarice or pride  Or cruel men began to stain their feasts  With blood and slaughter of poor harmless beasts  Thus liv'd the ancient Sabines thus the bold  Et  urians so renown'd and fear'd of old  Thus Romulus and thus auspicious Rome  From slender low beginnings by the doom  Of Fates to such prodigious greatness came  Bounded by heavens and seas and vaster fame  But hold for why the country swain alone  Though he be blest cares not to have it known  HORACE BOOK I SAT I  BEING A TRANSLATION OR RATHER IMITATION OF HIS WAY OF WRITING UPON THE DESIRE OF MY LADY TEMPLE AND MY LADY GIFFARD  BY THE SAME NOT IN HIS WORKS  HOW is't Maecenas that no man abides  The lot which reason gives or chance divides  To his own share still praises other stars  Oh happy merchants broken with the wars  And age the soldier cries On t'other side  When the ship's tost by raging winds and tide  Happy the wars there in an hour one dies  Or conquers the repining merchant cries  The lawyer past the fear of being poor  When early clients taber at his door  And break his sleep forgets his easy gains  And mutters Oh how blest are country swains  Their time's their own But when th' unpractis'd clow  Summon'd by writ enters the busy town  Every man's prey or jest he meets How curst  His hap he cries in fields so rudely nurst  The rest of the same kind would make a theme  As long and tedious as a winter's dream  But to dispatch if any God shall say  Your vows are heard each has his wish away  Change all your stations soldier go and trade  Merchant go fight lawyer come take the spade  And plough in hand farmer put on the gown  Learn to be civil and leave off the clown  Why what d'ye mean good sirs make haste you'll find  Hardly one God another time so kind  Soft and consider they all stand and stare  Like what they would be worse than what they are  Well this is mirth and 'tis confest though few  Can tell me what forbids jests to be true  Or gentle masters to invite their boys  To spell and learn at first with plumbs and toys  But to grow serious he that follows arms  Physick or laws thriving by others harms  The fawning host and he that sweats at plough  Th' adventurous merchant all agree and vow  Their end's the same they labour and they care  Only that rest and ease may be their share  When they grow old and have secur'd the main  Just so we see the wise and heedful train  Of busy ants in restless journies spend  The summermonths to gather and to mend  Their little heap foreseeing winter's rage  And in their youth careful to store their age  But when it comes they snug at home and share  The fruits in plenty of their common care  A council safe and wise when neither fire  Nor sea nor frost nor steel tames thy desire  Of endless gain whilst there is any can  So much as tell thee of one richer man  Where is the pleasure with a timorous hand  And heart to bury treasures in the sand  Who would be rich must never touch the bank  You rout an army if you break a rank  But if ne'er touch'd what helps the sacred heap  Of hidden gold' thy sweaty hinds may reap  Large fields of corn and fill whole tuns with wine  But yet thy belly holds no more than mine  So the tann'd slave that 's made perhaps to stoop  Under the whole provisions of the troop  Upon their way alas eats no more bread  Than he that carried none upon his head  Or tell me what 't imports the man that lives  Within the narrow bounds that Nature gives  To plough a hundred or a thousand fields  Oh but to draw from a great heap that yields  More than is ask'd is pleasant sure but why  If mine though little gives me more than I  Or you can use where is the difference  Why is your fortune better or your sense  As if some traveller upon his way  Wanting one quart of water to allay  His raging thirst should scorn a little spring  And seek a river 't were a pleasant thing  And what comes on 't that such as covet more  Than what they need perhaps are tumbled o'er  Into the stream by failing banks whilst he  That only wants what can't be spar'd is free  And drinking at the spring nor water fears  Troubled with mud nor mingled with his tears  Yet most men say by false desire misled  Nothing 's enough because you 're valued  Just so much as you have What shall one say  Or do to such a man Bid him away  And he as wretched as he please himself  Whilst he so fondly doats on dirty pelf  A sordid rich Athenian to allay  The scorn of all the peoples tongues would say  They hiss me but I hug myself at home  While I among my endless treasures roam  Tantalus catches at the sl  ing streams  That still beguile him like a lover's dreams  Why dost thou laugh Of thee the fable 's told  Thou that art plunged in thy heaps of gold  And gazest on them with such wakeful eyes  And greedy thoughts yet dar'st not touch the prize  No more than if 't were sacred or enjoy'd  Like pictures which with handling are destroy'd  Dost thou not know what money 's worth what use  It yields let bread be bought and chearful juice  Of grapes warm easy cloaths and wood to burn  As much of all as serves kind Nature's turn  Or else go spend thy nights in broken dreams  Of thieves or fire by day try all extremes  Of pinching cold and hunger make thy fare  Of watchful thoughts and heartconsuming care  Are these thy treasures these thy goods may I  In want of all such riches live and die  But if thy body shakes with aguish cold  Or burns with raging fevers or grows old  Betimes with unkind usage thou art sped  With friends and servants that surround thy bed  Make broths and beg physicians to restore  A health now so bewail'd so lov'd before  By all thy dear relations Wretched man  Neither thy wife nor child nor servant can  Endure thou should'st recover all the boys  And girls thy neighbours hate thee make a noise  To break thy sleeps and dost thou wonder when  Thou lov'st thy gold far above Gods or men  Canst thou teach others love thyself have none  Thou may'st as well get children all alone  Then l  t there be some end of gain the more  Thou dost possess the less fear to be poor  And end thy labour when thou hast attain'd  What first thou hadst in  im nor be arraign'd  Like base Umidius who was wont to mete  His money as his neighbours did their wheat  By bushels yet a wretch to such degree  That he was cloath'd and fed as begga  ly  As the worst slave and to his very last  His fear of downright starving ne'er was past  But as the Gods would have it a brave t  ull  He kept with a plain hatchet cleft his skull  What is your counsel then I pray to swill  Like Nomentanus or like Moenius still  To pinch and cark Why go'st thou on to join  Things so directly opposite 'Tis fine  And does become thee if I bid thee fly  The prodigal a miser thou must die  Nor one nor t'other like my counsel sounds  There is a mean in things and certain bounds  Short or beyond the which the truth and right  Cannot consist nor long remain in sight  But to return from whence I parted where  Is there one miser does content appear  With what he is or has and does not hate  His own or envy at his neighbour's fate  Never regards the endless swarm of those  That so much poorer are but still outgoes  The next and then the next when he is past  Meeting still one or other stops his haste  Like a fierce rider in a numerous race  That starts and spurs it on with eager pace  While there is one before him vext in mind  But scorning all that he has left behind  Hence comes it that so seldom one is found  Who says his life has happy been and sound  And having fairly measur'd out the span  f posting age dies a contented man  r rises from the table like a guest  hat e'en has fill'd his belly at the feast  ON MRS PHILIPPS'S DEATH  Mrs Catharine Philipps better known by the poetical name of Orinda was the daughter of John Fowler merchant▪ and born in London as Wood and Ballard in according to Jacob was married to James Philipps of the Priory of Cardigan esq about the year and died in Fleetstreet in the month of June Her poems including two tragedies "Horace" and "Pompey" both translated from Corneille were collected in a folio volume and afterwards reprinted in octavo She was also the writer of  volume of Letters published many years after her death  Sir Charles Cotterel intituled "Letters from Orinda to P  +liarchus" which have been much admired  " Orinda's works with courtly graces stor'd  " True sense in nice expressions will afford"  Dr King vol III p  Mrs Philipps was as much famed for her friendship as  her poetry and had the good fortune to be equally esteem  by the best poet and the best divine of her age Dr Jeremy Taylor addressed his discourse "on the nature and effects of friendship" to this lady and Mr Cowley has celebrated her memory in an Ode particularly distinguished by the very learned and sagacious editor of his "Select Works"The industrious Mr Langbaine says  "she was one that equalled the Lesbian Sappho and Roman Sulpicia as they were praised by Horace Martial Ausonius and other antient poets so was this lady commended by the earls of Orrery and Roscommon by Cowley Flatman and other eminent poets"  Sir John Denham added a fifth act to her tragedy of "Horace" which was performed at court by persons of quality in In the prologue spoken by the duke of Monmouth it was observed that  " While a woman Horace did translate  " Horace did rise above a Roman state"  The commendation she received from Lord Roscommon is thus handsomely returned by Mrs Philipps  "Lord Roscommon is certainly one of the most promising young noblemen in Ireland He has paraphrased a Psalm admirably and a scene of Pastor Fido very finely in some places much better than Sir Richard Fanshaw This was undertaken merely  compliment to me who happened to say that it was the be  scene in Italian and the worst in English He was only two hours about it  It begins thus  " Dear happy groves and you the dark retreat  " Of silent horrour Rest's eternal seat"  From these lines which are since somewhat mended it appears that he did not think a work of two hours fit to endure the eye of criticism without revisal When Mrs Philipps was in Ireland some ladies that had seen her translation of Pompey resolved to bring it on the stage at Dublin and to promote their design Lord Roscommon gave them a prologue and Sir Edward Dering an epilogue "which" says she  "are the best performances of those kinds I eve  saw"  If this is not criticism it is at least gratitude▪ The thought of bringing Caesar and Pompey into Ireland▪ the only country over which Caesar never had any power▪ is luckyI need not point out the part of these remarks for which I am indebted to Lord Roscommon's incomparab  Biographer N    AT THE DESIRE OF MY LADY TEMPLE  BY THE SAME NOT IN HIS WORKS  WHY all these looks so solemn and so sad  Who is that one can die and none be glad  The rich leaves heirs the great makes room the wise  Pleases the foolish only when he dies  Men so divided are in hopes and fears  That none can live or die with general tears  'Tis sure some star is fallen and our hearts  Grow heavy as its gentle influence parts  Thus said I and like others hung my head  When straight 'twas whisper'd 'tis Orinda's dead  Orinda what the glory of our stage  Crown of her sex and wonder of the age  Graceful and fair in body and in mind  She that taught sullen Virtue to be kind  Youth to be wise Mirth to be innocent  Fame to be steady Envy to relent  Love to be cool and Friendship to be warm  Praise to do good and Wit to do no harm  Orinda that was sent the world to give  The best example how to write and live  The queen of poets whosoe'er 's the king  And to whose sceptre all their homage bring  Who more than men conceiv'd and understood  And more than women knew how to be good  Who learnt all young that age could e'er attain  Excepting only to be proud and vain  And made alone so rich amends for all  The faults her sex committed since the fall  Can she be dead Can any thing be great  And safe Can day advance and not retreat  Into the shady night But she was young  And might have liv'd to tune the world and sung  Us all asleep that now lament her fall  And Fate unjust Heaven unrelenting call  Alas can any fruit grow ripe in spring  And hang till autumn Nature gives this sting  To all below whatever thrives too fast  Decays too soon late growths may longer last  Orinda could not wait on slowpac'd Time  Having so far to go so high to climb  But like a flash of heavenly fire that falls  Into some earthly dwelling first it calls  The neighbours only to admire the light  And lustre that surprize their wondering sight  Till kindling all it grows a noble flame  Towering and spiring up from whence it came  But ere arrived at those azure walls  The house that lodg'd it here to ashes falls  Such was Orinda's soul But hold I see  A troop of mourners in deep elegy  Make room and listen to their charming lays  For they bring cypress here to trade for bays  And he deserves it who of all the rest  Praises and imitates Orinda best  ON MY LADY GIFFARD'S LOORY  From the description perhaps a species of singing par+rot N    OF all the questions which the curious raise  Either in search of knowledge or of praise  None seem so much perplexed or so nice  As where to find the seat of paradise  But who could once that happy region name  From whence the fair and charming Loory came  To end this doubt would give the best advice  For this was sure the bird of paradise  Such radiant colours from no tainted air  Such notes and humour from no lands of care  Such unknown smells could from no common earth  From no known climate could receive a birth  For he alone in these alive outvy'd  All the perfumes with which the phoenix died  About a gentle turtle's was the size  The sweetest shape that e'er surprized eyes  A longish hawked bill and yellow brown  A stick black velvet cap upon the crown  His back a scarlet mantle cover'd o'er  One purple sploach upon his neck he wore  His jetty eyes were circled all with flame  His swelling breast was with his back the same  All down his belly a deep violet hue  Was gently shaded to an azure blue  His spreading wings were green to brown inclin'd  But with a sweet pale strawcolour were lin'd  His tail above was purples mixt with green  Under a colour such as ne'er was seen  When like a fan it spread a mixture bold  Of green and yellow grideline and gold  Thus by fond nature was he drest more gay  Than eastern kings in all their rich array  For feather much as well as flower outvies  In softness silk in colour mortal dyes  But none his beauty with his humour dare  Nor can his body with his soul compare  If that was wonder this was prodigy  They differ'd as the finest earth and sky  If ever any reasonable soul  Harbour'd in shape of either brute or fowl  This was the mansion metamorphosy  Gain'd here the credit lost in poetry  No passion moving in a human breast  Was plainer seen or livelier exprest  No wit or learning eloquence or song  Acknowledg'd kindness or complain'd of wrong  With accents half so feeling as his notes  Look how he rages now again he doats  Brave like the eagle meek as is the dove  Jealous as men like women does he love  With bill he wounds you sudden as a dart  Then nibbling asks you pardon from his heart  He calls you back if e'er you go away  He thanks you if you are so kind to stay  When you return with exultation high  He raises notes that almost pierce the sky  But all in such a language that we guest  Though he spoke ours he found his own the best  Such a badeen  From the French  badin  a person full of play N  ne'er came upon the stage  So droll so monkey in his play and rage  Sprawling upon his back and pitching pyes  Twirling his head and flurring at the flies  A thousand tricks and postures would he show  Then rise so pleas'd both with himself and you  That the amaz'd beholders could not say  Whether the bird was happier or they  With a soft brush was tipt his wanton tongue  He lapt his water like a tiger young  His lady's teeth with this he prick'd and prun'd  With this a thousand various notes he tun'd  A chagrin  Q shagreen N  fine cover'd his little feet  Which to wild airs would in wild measures meet  With these he took you by the hand his prey  With these he seiz'd with these he hopt away  With these held up he made his bold defence  The arms of safety love and violence  With all these charms Loory endow'd and drest  Forsaking climates with such creatures blest  From eastern regions and remotest strands  Flew to the gentle Artemisa's hands  And when from thence he gave the fatal start  Went to the gentle Artemisa's heart  Fed with her hands and perch'd upon her head  From her lips water'd nested in her bed  Nurst with her cares preserved with her fears  And now alas embalmed with her tears  But sure among the griefs that plead just cause  This needs must be acquitted by the laws  For never could be greater passion  Concernment jealousy for mistress shown  Content in presence and at parting grief  Trouble in absence by return relief  Such application that he was i' th' end  Company lover playfellow and friend  Could I but hope or live one man to find  As much above the rest of humankind  As this above the race of all that fly  Long should I live contented should I die  Had such a creature heretofore appear'd  When to such various Gods were altars rear'd  Who came transformed down in twenty shapes  For entertainment love revenge or rapes  Loory would then have Mercury been thought  And of him sacred images been wrought  For between him sure was sufficient odds  And all th' Egyptian Gothic Indian Gods  Nay with more reason had he been ador'd  Than Gods that parjur'd Goddesses that whor'd  Yet such the greatest nations chose or found  And rais'd the highest plant from lowest ground  ARISTAEUS  Aristaeus was son of Cyrene daughter to one of the ancient kings of Arcadia and by Apollo as was believed or at least reported His birth was concealed and he was sent to be privately brought up among the shepherds of Arcadia where grown a man he applied himself wholly to the cares and stores of a country life in all which he succeeded so as to grow renowned for his knowledge and wealth He was esteemed the first inventor of cheese oil and honey or rather of the art of hiving bees which before were wild and their stocks found only by chance and in hollow trees For this he was worshiped among the Arcadians as son of Apollo and as other inventors of things necessary or most useful to human life He fell in love with Eurydice newly espoused to Orpheus and by his pursuit of her was the occasion of her death being bitten by a snake as she fled from him This was followed by the death of Orpheus after a long and incurable grief whereupon Aristaeus was by the nymphs companions of Eurydice plagued in all his stores but most of all in his bees of which he was fondest till he lost them all and was in despair ever to recover them but by the advice of his mother and of Proteus to whom she sent him he came to find out both the true cause of his loss and means of retrieving it TEMPLE    FROM VIRGIL'S GEORGICKS BOOK IV  BY THE SAME NOT IN HIS WORKS  THE shepherd Aristaeus grieving sees  The helpless loss of his beloved bees  In vain he with the strong contagion strives  The clustering stocks lie famish'd in their hives  Some from abroad return with droopy wing  With empty thighs and most without a sting  They with diseases he with sorrow pines  And to his spited grief himself resigns  Abandons all his wonted cares and pains  His flocks his groves his shepherds and his plains  Away he goes led by his raving dreams  To the clear head of the Peneian streams  Full of complaints he there his sorrow breaks  And thus reproaching to his mother speaks  Cyrene sometime mother whofe abodes  Are at the bottom of these crystal floods  If e'er Apollo charmed thy desire  As I am told or was my sacred sire  If ever thou brought'st forth this child the hate  And scorn of angry unrelenting Fate  What is his care Or where thy tender love  That bid me hope for blessed seats above  Is this th' advantage of immortal race  Are these the trophies that thy offspring grace  Is 't not enough I pass inglorious life  Among the country shades in toil and strife  With my hard fate but thou must envy bear  That I liv'd private void of hope or fear  Sprung from such seed I should a hero be  Is it too much to be content and free  What is the honour of poor sheep and bees  That thou should'st envy or deny me these  Thou art a Goddess I an humble swain  And can my rural fortunes give thee pain  If so then come and cut down all my groves  Parch all my eared sheaves and kill my droves  Famish my flocks and root up all my vines  He that is once undone no more repines  Thus went he on until at length the sound  Reach'd fair Cyrene she sat circled round  With all her nymphs in vaulted chambers spread  Under the great and sacred river's bed  There was Cydippe gentle sweet and fair  And bright Dycorias with golden hair  The first a virgin free from wanton stains  The other newly past Lucina's pains  Clio and Peroe from the ocean  Lately arrived each upon a swan  Opis and Ephyre and Deiopeia  Drymo Ligaea and the young Thalcia  Swift Arethusa had her quiver laid  And wanton Speio with her garland play'd  Some spin Milesian wools some entertain  The rest with stories of the pleasing pain  The gay Climene told the crafty wiles  Of jealous Vulcan how he Mars beguiles  How the sweet thefts are found the train is set  And how the lovers struggle in the net  Whilst to such tales they lend a willing ear  Their time and work away together wear  Till Ar  staeus' sad complaint begins  To make them listen then proceeding wins  All the attention of the crystal hall  But Arethusa moved before all  The rest starts up and rears her sprightly head  Above the waves that murmur'd as they fled  And Oh the Gods Cyrene cries she out  Sister Cyrene sister here without  Thy chiefest care sad Aristaeus stands  And sighs and swells and with his gentle hands  Wipes his wet eyes then to reproaches falls  And thee unkind and cruel mother calls  She struck and pale and feeling all the smart  That at such news could pierce a mother's heart  Cries Bring him to us bring him strait away  For him 'tis lawful Aristaeus may  Sprung of the Gods their sacred portals tread  Then she commands the hasty streams that fled  So fast away to stop and leave a room  Where the sad youth might to her palace come  The waters hear their Goddess's command  And rising from their bed in arches stand  He through the glazed vaults amaz'd descends  Guided by two of the kind nymphs his friends  Till the vast spacious caverns he descries  Where fair Cyrene's watery kingdom lies  And struck with wonder the new scene beheld  Where in vast regions mighty waters swell'd  Here gloomy groves repeat the hollow sound  Of falling floods there rocky cliffs rebound  The fainting echoes here great lakes remain  Enclos'd in caves reserv'd to fill some vein  Of failing streams there mighty rivers roll  In torrents raging and without control  Here gentle brooks with a soft murmur glide  Phasis and Lycus coasting by his side  Cold Cydnus hastening to Cicilian strands  Old Tyber winding through the tawny sands  The troubled Hypanis and Anio fair  All haste to show their heads in open air  That way the rapid Po in branched veins  Runs out to water many fertile plains  At length the noble swain is wondering brought  Into a great and round pavilion wrought  Out of a crystal rock with moss o'ergrown  Within 'twas paved all with pumicestone  The vaulted roof with motherpearl was spread  Fretted with coral in wild branches led  The wall in grotesque im  gery excels  Wrought in a thousand variouscolour'd shells  Some representing the fierce seagods rapes  Others the fair and flying nymphs escapes  Here Neptune with the Tritons in his train  There Venus rising from the foamy main  Twenty light ivory chairs and cover'd all  With mossy cushions stood about the hall  To one of these is Aristaeus led  Where sitting down at first he hung his head  Then sighing tells his story and his moan  Repeats but only lets reproach alone  Cyrene hearing all her son's complaints  Alas poor youth she cries alas he faints  Is it with fasting or with grief Go bring  A bowl of water from you crystal spring  And bring a flaggon of old sparkling wine  The nymphs dispatch some make the altar shine  With spicy flam  s some the white napkins get  And various dishes on the table set  She takes a cup of one great pearl and cries  First to the Ocean let us sacrifice  And while she holds it in her hand she prays  To the great Ocean sings the Ocean's praise  Invokes a hundred nymphs that him obey  But in a hundred groves and rivers sway  Thrice she pours wine upon the sacred fires  And thrice the flame to th' arched roof aspires  With which propitious signs Cyrene pleas'd  She thus her son's impatient grief appeas'd  In the Carpoethian gulph blue Proteus dwells  Great Neptune's prophet who the ocean quells  He in a glittering chariot courses o'er  The foaming waves him all the nymphs adore  Old Nereus too because he all things knows  The past the present and the future shows  So Neptune pleas'd who Proteus thus inspir'd  And with such wages to his service hir'd  Gave him the rule of all his briny flocks  That feed among a thousand ragged rocks  He's coasting now to the Emathian shore  Near fair Pallene where bright Thetis bore  This son of th' Ocean thou must him pursue  And seize and bind and make him tell the true  Cause and events of thy sad disastrous chance  By no fair words or prayers canst thou advance  Nor gentle means hard force will make him bend  And for his own be glad to serve thy end  When next the radiant sun shall scorch the plain  And thirsty cattle seek for shade in vain  I will myself conduct thee to the cells  And close retreats where this enchanter dwells  When he the ocean leaves and takes his rest  There seize him tired and with sleep opprest  And bind him fast with fetters and with chains  And still the more he struggles and he strains  The faster hold him and beware his wiles  By which he other mortals still beguiles  For into twenty various forms he'll turn  A marble pillar or a curved urn  A flash of fire or else a gushing flood  A shaggy lion smeared all with blood  A scaly dragon or a rugged bear  A chafed boar or tiger he'll appear  But thou the more he shifts his various shapes  Take the more care to hinder his escapes  And hold him faster till at length he rise  In the same form thou didst him first surprize  Then will he tell whose anger has thee griev'd  And how thy loss may be again retriev'd  Thus said Cyrene and with a gentle look  Upon her son her golden tresses shook  From whence ambrosian odours were diffus'd  About the room by which the shepherd us'd  So long to woe straight seemed to revive  And thought his loved bees again alive  His hair and weed the sweet perfume retains  And sprightly vigour runs through all his veins  There is a mighty gulph which many a tide  Had eaten out of a great mountain's side  Sometimes the foaming waves come braving o'er  The ragged cliffs that all infest the shore  And a great sea covers this mighty bay  But when with falling tides it steals away  Then does a dry and spacious strand appear  Which rough and scatter'd rocks does only bear  About the midst one above all the rest  With scraggy splints raises its lofty crest  The spreading roof has two unequal sides  Half undermined by the beating tides  Which make two hollow chambers on the strand  Arched with rock and floored with the sand  Of these the larger is the cool retreat  Which Proteus chooses from the scorching heat  Within the lesser fair Cyrene hides  Bold Aristaeus where the youth abides  Turn'd from the light and casting in his mind  How he may seize the bard and how him bind  Thus all prepar'd the nymph no longer stays  But in a mist away herself conveys  And as she rises all the sky grows clear  Phoebus begins his flaming head to rear  Parching the corn and scorching up the blades  The lowing cattle seek about for shades  The panting lions with the heat opprest  And tigers tamed lay them down to rest  The thirsty Indians hasten to their caves  And now the briny flocks forsake the waves  Here comes a Triton on a dolphin borne  There a great seahorse with his wreathed horn  The snarling seals crawl up the sloping shore  And deepmouth'd hounds that in Charybdis roar  Calves hogs and bears all monsters of the floods  But those resembling which frequent the woods  Roll on the sand or sprawling on their sides  In the hot sun they tan their tawny hides  Then Proteus wafted o'er the curling waves  Leaps on the shore and hastens to his caves  There sitting down he shakes his briny locks  And eyes his herds scatter'd among the rocks  Just as some aged shepherd ere the night  Approaches and the wolves begin to fright  His tender lambs gets on some rising ground  And gathers all his flocks about him round  Views them with care and numbers all his sheep  Then on the grass securely falls asleep  But Proteus scarce is laid upon the sands  In easy slumbers stretching out his hands  When the fierce youth in haste upon him runs  Seizes him fast and with amazement stuns  The frighted captive Then he clapson bands  Upon his fainting legs and trembling hands  Yet 'tis not long the elf forgets his arts  But at the first surprizing fright departs  Come to himself he is himself no more  Nothing appears of what he was before  But into twenty monstrous shapes he turns  Gushes like water or in flame he burns  A serpent hisses or a lion roars  A tiger's likeness or a grizly boar's  But the warn'd swain never lets go his hold  Till Proteus finding none of all his old  Accustom'd wiles succeed he silence breaks  And thus in human voice and shape he speaks  But who thou boldest of all mortal race  Has sent thee here my lonely steps to trace  And taught thee undiscerned thus to creep  nto the secret closets of the deep  Or what's the thing thou seek'st now I am ty'd  And in thy hands The shepherd straight reply'd  Thou askest what thou know'st for none can thee  eceive then think not of deceiving me  Tis by the Gods commands we here are come  To thee for help or else to know our doom  t this the prophet rolls his fiery eyes  And grinds his teeth awhile and then replies  'Tis not in vain or for light cause decreed  y angry Fates that thy fond heart should bleed  s well as his for whom this punishment  oo too unequ  l to thy crime is sent  Tis wretched Orpheus does thy life infest  nd both have lost what both have loved best  Thy heart was set upon thy rural stores  He nothing but Eurydice adores  Thou wert the cause of her untimely fate  And he pursues thee with an endless hate  The lovely bride was wandering o'er the plain  In hopes to meet her own desired swain  When thou bold youth enflamed by her charms  Would fain have caught her in thy lustful arms  Away she springs like a light doe that flies  The bloody hound her nimble feet she plies  Along the downs but whilst away she runs  And thy pursuit amaz'd and frighted shuns  Alas unwary she ne'er spy'd the snake  That as she pass'd lay lurking in the brake  Thus almost hopeless grown and out of breath  She 'scapes thy rage by an untimely death  But her last cries the echoes far report  The nymphs about her shrieking all resort  The hollow woods in murmur make their moan  Among their branches all the turtles groan  The Thracian mountains round with sorrow swell  The very tigers all about them yell  The towering heavens at her fate complain  And brokenhearted clouds fall down in rain  The following night her deepest sable wears  And the next morning weeps in dewy tears  But woeful Orpheus all in grief excels  All in complaints among the rocks he dwells  In tears dissolving and with sighing pin'd  Calling the Heavens unjust and Gods unkind  At length he takes up his melodious lyre  Which Phoebus ever used to inspire  Thinking to charm his woes and lovesick heart  A cure too hard for either time or art  For now his warbling harp would yield no sounds  But lost Eurydice Eurydice rebounds  From every trembling string thee still he sung  Thy gentle name among the woods he rung  Thee on the lonely shore amidst the rocks  Thee on the hills among the herds and flocks  Thee at the dawning of the morning gray  Thee at the closing of the weary day  But where alas thus wretched should he go  Tir'd with the light he seeks the shades below  To the Taenarian caves his course he bends  And by the deep infernal gates descends  Into the ghastly leasless woods that spread  Over the gloomy regions of the dead  Trunks without sap and boughs that never bear  Some pale with fear some black with deep despair  He crost the sooty plains and miry lakes  All full of croaking toads and hissing snakes  Came to the rusty iron gates that bring  To the black towers of the great dreadful king  Hoping to touch a heart with his sad care  That ne'er relented yet with human prayer  But at his powerful song the very seats  Of Erebus were moved the retreats  Of all the ghosts were open'd and they swarm  Like bees in clusters when the sun grows warm  Or when the evening drives them to the hive  Mothers and virgins as if still alive  Husbands and children heroes so renown'd  Mixt with the nameless croud and monarchs crown'd  'Mong sweaty hinds and slaves about him throng  Admire and listen to his charming song  The whole Tartarian regions all amaz'd  Stood and attended or upon him gaz'd  The slow Cocytus stops its muddy flood  And Styx about him nine times circling stood  The snaky tresses of th' Eumenides  Left off their hissing Cerberus at ease  Laid down his threefold head and ceas'd to roar  Ixion's restless wheel would turn no more  And now th' enchanting Orpheus had prevail'd  His songs had more than ever prayers avail'd  Eurydice's restor'd to human life  And he returns close follow'd by his wife  Hears but not sees her for that law was made  By Proserpine and was upon him laid  He should not once behold his lovely fair  Till both arriv'd above in open air  But when th' infernal mansions almost past  Approaching day a dawning twilight cast  Upon the lovers the unhappy swain  Forgetting all his woes and all his pain  Spent with desire and vanquish'd of his mind  Turn'd his impatient head and cast a kind  And longing look upon his gentle mate  Now heedless of the doom impos'd by fate  A venial fault if pity or if grace  Had ever grown among th' infernal race  But here his labour all ran out in vain  The unrelenting doom takes place again  Thrice from th' Avernian lake a horrid noise  Invades his ears and thrice the howling voice  Of Cerberus thrice shook the vaulted cave  And for the nymph open'd a second grave  She fainting cries What fury thee possest  What frenzy Orpheus seized on thy breast  Ah me once more undone Behold the Fates  Again recall me to their iron gates  Once more my eyes are seiz'd with endless sleep  And now farewell I sink into the deep  Oblivious cells surrounded all with night  No longer thine in vain to stop my flight  I stretch my arms in vain thou stretchest thine  In vain thou grievest I in vain repine  Thus said she and o' th' sudden from his eyes  Like smoke to air all vanishing she flies  And leaves him catching at the empty shade  In vain he call'd her and fond offers made  To follow for no more hard Fate allows  His wish'd return nor hearkens to his vows  Black guards of Orcus strongly him withstood  Nor suffer'd to approach the Stygian flood  What should he do where pass his woeful life  Twice had he got twice lost his dearest wife  With what new vows should he the heavens please  With what new songs should he the ghosts appease  She now grown pale and cold was wafting o'er  The Stygian lake and near the hated shore  Full seven long months in sad and raving dreams  Or restless thoughts he pass'd near Strimon's streams  Under a lonely rock or in wild dens  Seeking the savage beasts avoiding men's  Commerce or sight but with his doleful lays  He taught the flocking birds to  ing her praise  His own despair the very stones admire  And rolling follow his melodious lyre  He forc'd the heart of hardest oak to groan  And made fierce tigers leave their rage and moan  So the sweet nightingale that grieving stood  And saw th' untimely rape of her young brood  Snatch'd by some clown out of the downy nest  Under a poplar shade or else her breast  Against some thorn she spends the longsome night  In mournful notes and shuns th' approaching light  But the dark thicket fills with endless moan  Charming all others' sorrow but her own  No heats new Venus in him e'er could raise  No sense e'er mov'd him of reproach or praise  Along the streams of Tanaïs he goes  Alone he wanders o'er the Scythian snows  Seeks the rough mountains cover'd all with frost  And tells the trees Eurydice is lost  Curses the vain concession of the Fates  Himself and angry Gods and men he hates  Women he scorns since she must be no more  Whom only he and ever could adore  But the Cyconian dames too long despis'd  Too much desiring by him to be priz'd  Amidst the sacred rites of Bacchus' feast  Ripp'd up his vainly lov'd and loving breast  Tore him in pieces and about the fields  Scatter'd his limbs what fruits religion yields  And even then when into Heber's streams  They threw his head his eyes had lost their beams  His lips their ruddy hue but still his voice  Call'd in a low and now expiring noise  Eurydice Eurydice his tongue  In broken notes now chill and trembling sung  Eurydice the echoes sounded o'er  The neighbouring banks and down the rocky shore  Thus Proteus sung then leap'd into the main  For now the foaming tide return'd again  Among the rocks The shepherd stood amaz'd  But straight Cyrene came on whom he gaz'd  Like one enchanted with the dreary song  Of charming Proteus for the fatal wrong  Of Orpheus touch'd him now more than his own  In such sad notes and lively colours shown  She chear'd his troubled thoughts and thus began  No more complaints my son no more these wan  And careful looks the cause of all thy grief  Is now discover'd so is the relief  The angry Nymphs that haunt the shady groves  Where Orpheus and his bride began their loves  And many a dance had taught her in their rings  Whilst he so sweetly to their measures sings  'Tis they have plagued thee in all thy stores  Among thy sheep have caus'd so many sores  Blasted thy corn and made thy heifers pine  Blighted the fruitful olive and the vine  But above all thy bees have felt the smart  Because they knew thou hadst them most at heart  Therefore with offerings thou must them appease  They reconciled once will give thee ease  The nymphs are gentle may their rage allay  When thou begin'st to worship and to pray  But the whole order of their sacred rites  I must explain unknown to mortal wights  First choose four steers the fairest of thy herd  Which on Lycaean mountains thou hast rear'd  Four lovely heifers yet unhandled take  Then just as many unhewn altars make  Within the grove where ancient use allows  Arcadian swains to pay their holy vows  Unto the Nymphs There as the day shall rise  Of all these offerings make one sacrifice  Upon the altars pour the reeking blood  And leave the bodies in the shady wood  First strowed over with fresh oaken boughs  But when the ninth Aurora thee shall rouse  From thy soft sleep Lethaean poppies bring  And unto Orpheus solemn dirgies sing  With a black sheep his angry ghost appease  And a white calf Eurydice to please  Then to the grove return with humble gait  And heart devout and there expect thy fate  The swain instructed makes no long delay  Unto the shrine he straight begins his way  Raises the altars all the bullocks slays  Offers his humblest prayers and his praise  Unto the angry nymphs then home retires  And lays sweet incense on his houshold fires  Full eight long days but when the dawning light  Upon the ninth restor'd the morning bright  He to the grove returns and there he sees  Stupendous sight a thousand thousand bees  Out of the melted bowels of each steer  As from a mighty swarming hive appear  Bursting from out the sides with vital heat  From whence in clouds they rise then take their seat  Upon the leaning boughs till all the trees  Are hung with bunches of the clustering bees  Thus have I sung poor nymphs' and shepherds' dreams  Whilst Caesar thunders at Euphrates' streams  With conquering arms the vanquish'd nations awes  And to the willing people gives just laws  Treads the true path to great Olympus' hills  And wondering mortals with his praises fills  HORACE BOOK IV ODE VII  BY THE SAME  THE snows are melted all away  The fields grow flowery green and gay  The trees put out their tender leaves  And all the streams that went astray  The brook again into her bed receives  See the whole Earth has made a change  The Nymphs and Graces naked range  About the fields who shrunk before  Into their caves The empty grange  Prepares its room for a new summer's store  Lest thou should'st hope immortal things  The changing year instruction brings  The fleeting hour that steals away  The beggar's time and life of kings  But ne'er returns them as it does the day  The cold grows soft with western gales  The Summer over Spring prevails  But yields to Autumn's fruitful rain  As this to Winter storms and hails  Each loss the hasting moons repair again  But we when once our race is done  With Tullus and Anchises' son  Though rich like one like t'other good  To dust and shades without a sun  Descend and sink in deep oblivion's flood  Who knows if the kind Gods will give  Another day to men that live  In hope of many distant years  Or if one night more shall retrieve  The joys thou losest by thy idle fears  The pleasant hours thou spend'st in health  The use thou mak'st of youth and wealth  As what thou giv'st among thy friends  Escapes thy heirs so those the stealth  Of Time and Death where good and evil ends  For when that comes nor birth nor fame  Nor piety nor honest name  Can e'er restore thee Theseus bold  Nor chaste Hippolytus could tame  Devouring fate that spares nor young nor old  HORACE BOOK I ODE XIII  BY THE SAME  WHEN thou commend'st the lovely eyes  Of Telephus that for thee dies  His arms of wax his neck or hair  Oh how my heart begins to beat  My spleen is swell'd with gall and heat  And all my hopes are turn'd into despair  Then both my mind and colour change  My jealous thoughts about me range  In twenty shapes my eyes begin  The stealing drops as from a still  Like winter springs apace to fill  Fall down and tell what fires I feel within  When his reproaches make thee cry  fresh cheeks with paleness die  I burn to think you will be friends  When his rough hand thy bosom strips  Or his fierce kisses tear thy lips  I die to see how all such quarrel ends  Ah never hope a youth to hold  So haughty and in love so bold  What can him tame in anger keep  Whom all this fondness can't assuage  Who even kisses turns to rage  Which Venus does in her own nectar steep  Thrice happy they whose gentle hearts  Till death itself their union parts  An undisturbed kindness holds  Without complaints or jealous fears  Without reproach or spited tears  Which damps the kindest heats with sudden colds  UPON THE APPROACH OF THE SHORE AT HARWICH IN  JANUARY  BEGUN UNDER THE MAST AT THE DESIRE OF MY LADY GIFFARD  BY THE SAME  This poem is printed from Dr Swift's edition In Lady Giffard's copy there are some small variations which I hav  noticed in p N    WELCOME the fairest and the happiest earth  Seat of my hopes and pleasures as my birth  Mother of wellborn souls and fearless hearts  In arms renown'd and flourishing in arts  The island of goodnature and good cheer  That elsewhere only pass inhabit here  Region of valour and of beauty too  Which shews the brave are only fit to woo  No child thou hast ever approach'd thy shore  That lov'd thee better or esteem'd thee more  Beaten with journeys both of land and seas  Weary'd with care the busy man's disease  Pinch'd with the frost and parched with the wind  Giddy with rolling and with fasting pin'd  Spited and vex'd that winds and tides and sands  Should all conspire to cross such great commands  As haste me home with an account that brings  The doom of kingdoms to the best of kings  Yet I respire at thy reviving sight  Welcome as health and chearful as the light  How I forget my anguish and my toils  Charm'd at th' approach of thy delightful soils  How like a mother thou hold'st out thy arms  To save thy children from pursuing harms  And open'st thy kind bosom where they find  Safety from waves and shelter from the wind  Thy cliffs so stately and so green thy hills  This with respect with hope the other fills  All that approach thee who believe they find  A Spring for Winter that they left behind  Thy sweet inclosures and thy scatter'd farms  Shew thy secureness from thy neighbour's harms  Their sheep in houses and their men in towns  Sleep only safe thine rove about the downs  And hills and groves and plains and know no fear  Of foes or wolves or cold throughout the year  Their vast and frightful woods seem only made  To cover cruel deeds and give a shade  VARIATIONS IN LADY GIFFARD'S COPY  " To the wild beasts and wilder men that prey  " Upon whatever chances in their way"  The corrections I believe were made by Dr Swift N  To savage beasts who on the weaker prey  Or human savages more wild than they  Thy pleasant thickets and thy shady groves  Only relieve the heats and cover loves  Sheltering no other thefts or cruelties  But those of killing or beguiling eyes  Their famish'd hinds by cruel lords enslav'd  VARIATIONS IN LADY GIFFARD'S COPY  " Their famish'd hinds oppress'd by cruel lords  " Flea'd with hard taxes aw'd with soldiers' swords"  The corrections I believe were made by Dr Swift N  Ruin'd by taxes and by soldiers brav'd  Know no more ease than just what sleep can give  Have no more heart and courage but to live  Thy brawny clowns and sturdy seamen fed  VARIATIONS IN LADY GIFFARD'S COPY  " With the good beef that their own fields have bred"  The corrections I believe were made by Dr Swift N  With manly food that their own fields have bred  Safe in their laws and easy in their rent  Bless'd in their king and in their state content  When they are call'd away from herd or plough  To arms will make all foreign forces bow  And shew how much a lawful monarch saves  When twenty subjects beat an hundred slaves  Fortunate island if thou didst but know  How much thou dost to heaven and nature owe  And if thy humour were as good as great  Thy forces and as bless'd thy soil as seat  But then with numbers thou would'st be o'errun  Strangers to breathe thy air their own would shun  And of thy children none abroad would roam  But for the pleasure of returning home  Come and embrace us in thy saving arms  Command the

which should have been copied but that they are so interwoven with the story of the drama that it would be improper to separate them There is also a song in "Love "in a Nunnery" and another in "The Duke of Guise" but neither of them worth transcribing N    I  WHY should a foolish marriage vow  Which long ago was made  Oblige us to each other now  When passion is decay'd  We lov'd and we lov'd as long as we could  Till our love was lov'd out of us both  But our marriage is dead when the pleasures are fled  'Twas pleasure first made it an oath  II  If I have pleasures for a friend  And farther love in store  What wrong has he whose joys did end  And who could give no more  'Tis a madness that he  Should be jealous of me  Or that I should bar him of another  For all we can gain  Is to give ourselves pain  When neither can hinder the other  SONG FROM TYRANNIC LOVE  BY THE SAME NOT AMONG HIS POEMS  AH how sweet it is to love  Ah how gay is young desire  And what pleasing pains we prove  When we first approach love's fire  Pains of love be sweeter far  Than all other pleasures are  Sighs which are from lovers blown  Do but gently heave the heart  E'en the tears they shed alone  Cure like trickling balm their smart  Lovers when they lose their breath  Bleed away in easy death  Love and Time with reverence use  Treat them like a parting friend  Nor the golden gifts refuse  Which in youth sincere they send  For each year their price is more  And they less simple than before  Love like springtides full and high  Swells in every youthful vein  But each tide does less supply  Till they quite shrinkin again  If a flow in age appear  'Tis but rain and runs not clear  ON THE DEATH OF PRINCE HENRY AND PRINCESS MARY  From "Threni Cantabrigienses in Funere duorum Principum Henrici

that in he had the degree of BA and had obtained a fellowship though neither of those academical honours attended has name in One of his earliest productions written in the year he went to College is already printed in vol I p with a prologue and two epilogues to "The Duke of Guise" none of which are in any edition of his works If these poems had come to light before the publication of Dr Johnson's excellent Life of Dryden that judicious Biographer would certainly have made some alteration in the following paragraph  "At the university he does not appear to have been eager of  poetical  distinction or to have lavished his  early wit  either on fictitious subjects or publick occasions He probably considered that he who purposed to be an author ought first to be a student He obtained whatever was the reason  no fellowship  in the College Why he was excluded cannot now be known and it is vain to guess had he thought himself injured he knew how to complain In the Life of Pl  tarch he mentions his education in the College with gratitude but in a prologue at Oxford he has these lines  Oxford to him a dearer name shall be  Than his own motheruniversity  Thebes did his rude unknowing youth engage  He chooses Athens in his riper age  It was not till the death of Cromwell in that he became a  publick  candidate for fame by publishing  Heroick Stanza  on the late Lord Protector  which compared with the verses of Sprat and Waller on the same occasion were sufficient to raise great expectations of the rising poet"  I had not seen these poems when the note in vol I p

should employ his shaping tool  To make a God of me or a jointstool  Each knob he weigh'd on every inch did plod  And rather chose to turn me to a God  As a Priapus hence I grew ador'd  The fear of every thief and every bird  The rascals from their pilfering tricks desist  And dread each wooden finger of my fist  The reeds stuck in my cap the Peckers fright  From our new orchards far they take their flight  And dare not touch a pippin in my sight  When any of the rabble did decease  They brought them to this place to stink in peace  Unnoisome here the snusss of rogues went out  'Twas once a common grave for all the rout  Loose Nomentanus left his riots here  And lewd Pantalabus forgot to jeer  Nor in these pitholes might they put a bone  Could lie beneath a dunghill of its own  But now the ground for slaves no more they tear  Sweet are the walks and vital is the air  Myrtle and orangegroves the eye delight  Where sculls and shanks did mix a ghastly fight  While here I stand the guardian of the trees  Not all the Jays are half the grievances  As are those hags who diligent in ill  Are either poisoning or bewitching still  These I can neither hurt nor terrify  But every night when once the moon is high  They haunt these alleys with their shricks and groans  And pick up baneful herbs and human bones  I saw Canidia here her feet were bare  Black were her robes and loose her flaky hair  With her fierce Sagana went stalking round  Their hideous howlings shook the trembling ground  A paleness casting horror round the place  Sat dead and terrible on either's face  Their impious trunks upon the earth they cast  And dug it with their nails in frantic haste  A coleblack lamb then with their teeth they tore  And in the pit they pour'd the reeking gore  By this they force the tortur'd ghosts from hell  And answers to their wild demands compel  Two images they brought of wax and wool  The waxen was a little puling fool  A chidden image ready still to skip  Whene'er the woollen one but snapt his whip  On Hecate aloud this beldame calls  T  phone as loud the other bawls  A thousand serpents hiss'd upon the ground  And hellhounds compass'd all the gardens round  Behind the tombs to shun the horrid sight  The moon skulk'd down or out of shame or fright  May every crow and cuckow if I lye  Aim at my crown as often as they fly  And never miss a dab though ne'er so high  May villain Julius and his rascal crew  Use me with just such ceremony too  But how much time and patience would it cost  To tell the gabblings of each hag and ghost  Or how the earth the ugly beldame scrapes  And hides the beards of wolves and teeth of snakes  While on the fire the waxen image fries  Vex'd to the heart to see their sorceries  My ears torn with their bellowing sprights my guts  My figtree bowels wambled at the sluts  Mad for revenge I gather'd all my wind  And bounc'd like fifty bladders from behind  Scar'd with the noise they scud away to town  While Sagana's false hair comes dropping down  Canidia tumbles o'er for want of breath  And scatters from her jaws her set of teeth  I almost burst to see their labours crost  Their bones their herbs and all their devils lost  THE DEATH OF CAMILLA  FROM VIRGIL AENEID XI  BY THE SAME  ON death and wounds Camilla looks with joy  Freed from a breast the siercer to destroy  Now thick as hail her fatal darts she ssings  The twoedg'd ax now on their helmets rings  Her shoulders bore Diana's arms and bow  And if too strongly prest she sled before a foe  Her shafts revers'd did death and horror bear  And found the rash who durst pursue the fair  Near her fierce Tulla and Tarpeia ride  And bold Larina conquering by her side  These above all Camilla's breast did share  For faith in peace and gallantry in war  Such were the Thracian Amazonian bands  When first they dy'd with blood Thermodoon's sands  Such troops Hippolyta herself did head  And such the bold Penthesilca led  When female shouts alarm'd the trembling fields  And glaring beams shot bright from maiden shields  Who gallant virgin who by thee were slain  What gasping numbers strew'd upon the plain  Thy spear first through Eumenius passage found  Whole torents gush'd out of his mouth and wound  With gnashing teeth in pangs the earth he tore  And roll'd himself half delug'd in his gore  Then hapless Pegasus and Lyris bleed  The latter reining up his fainting steed  The first as to his aid he stretch'd his hand  Both at an instant headlong struck the sand  Her arm Amastrus next and Tereas feel  Then follows Chromis with her lifted steel  Of all her quiver not a shaft was lost  But each attended by a Trojan ghost  Strong Orphitus in arms unknown before  In battle an Apulian courser bore  His brawny back wrapt in a bullock's skin  Upon his head a wolf did fiercely grin  Above the rest his mighty shoulders show  And he looks down upon the troops below  Aim and 'twas easy while his fellows fled  She struck along and thus she triumph'd while he bled  Some coward game thou didst believe to chace  But hunter see a woman stops thy race  Yet to requiring ghosts this glory bear  Thy soul was yielded to Camilla's spear  The mighty Butes next receives her lance  While breast to breast the combatants advance  Clanging between his armour's joints it  ung  While on his arm his useless target hung  Then from Orsilochus in circle runs  And follows the pursuer while she shuns  For still with craft a narrow ring she wheels  And brings herself up to the chacer's heels  Her ax regardless of his prayers and groans  She crashes through his a  mout and his bones  Redoubled strokes the vanquish'd foe sustains  His reeking face bespatter'd with his brains  Chance brought unhappy Aunus to the place  Who stopping short star'd wildly in her face  Of all to whom Liguria fraud imparts  While Fate allow'd that fraud he was of subtlest arts  Who when he saw he could not shun the sight  Strives to avoid the virgin by his slight  And cries aloud What courage can you shew  By cunning horsemanship to cheat a foe  Forego your horse and strive not to betray  But dare to combat a more equal way  'Tis thus we see who merits glory best  So brav'd fierce indignation fires her breast  Dismounted from her horse in open field  Now first she draws her sword and lifts her shield  He thinking that his cunning did succeed  Reins round his horse and urges all his speed  His golden rowels hidden in his sides  When thus his useless fraud the maid derides  Poor wretch that swell'st with a deluding pride  In vain thy country's little arts are try'd  No more the coward shall behold his fire  Then plies her feet quick as the nimble fire  And up before his horse's head she strains  When seizing with a furious hand his reins  She wreaks her fury on his spouting veins  So from a rock a hawk soars high above  And in a cloud with ease o'ertakes a dove  His pounces so the grappled foe assail  And blood and seathers mingle in a hail  Now Jove to whom mankind is still in sight  With more than usual care beholds the fight  And urging Tarchon on to rage inspires  The furious deeds to which his blood he fires  He spurs through slaughter and his failing troops  And with his voice lifts every arm that droops  He shouts his name in every soldier's ears  Reviling thus the spirits which he chears  Ye sham'd and everbranded Tyrrhene race  From whence this terror and your souls so base  When tender virgins triumph in the field  Let every brawny arm let fall his shield  And break the coward sword he dare not wield  Not thus you fly the daring she by night  Nor goblets that your drunken throats invite  This is your choice when with lewd Bacchanals  Y' are call'd by the fat sacrifice it waits not when it calls  Thus having said  He spurs with headlong rage among his foes  As if he only had his life to lose  And meeting Venulus his arms he clasps  The armour dints beneath the furious grasps  High from his horse the sprawling foe he rears  And thwart his courser's neck the prize he bea  s  The Trojans shout the Latins turn their eyes  While swift as lightning airy Tarchon slies  Who breaks his lance and views his armour round  To find where he might fix the deadly wound  The foe writhes doubling backward on his horse  And to defend his throat opposes force to force  As when an eagle high his course does take  And in his griping talons bears a snake  A thousand folds the serpent casts and high  Setting his speckled scales goes whistling through the sky  The fearless bird but deeper gores his prey  And through the clouds he cuts his airy way  So from the midst of all his enemies  Triumphant Tarchon snatch'd and bore his prize  The troops that shrunk with emulation press  To reach his danger now to reach at his success  Then Aruns doom'd in spight of all his art  Surrounds the nimble virgin with his dart  And slily watching for his time would try  To join his safety with his treachery  Wheree'er her rage the bold Camilla sends  There creeping Aruns silently attends  When tir'd with conquering she retires from fight  He steals about his horse and keeps her in his sight  In all her rounds from him she cannot part  Who shakes his treacherous but inevitable dart  Chloreus the priest of Cybele did glare  In Phrygian arms remarkable afar  A foaming steed he rode whose haunches case  Like feathers scales of mingled gold and brass  He clad in foreign purple gall'd the foe  With Cretan arrows from a Lycian bow  Gold was that bow and gold his helmet too  Gay were his upper robes which loosely flew  Each limb was cover'd o'er with something rare  And as he sought he glister'd every where  Or that the temple might the trophies hold  Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold  Him the fierce maid pursues through all her foes  Regardless of the life she did expose  Him eyes alone to other dangers blind  And manly force employs to please a virgin's mind  His dart now Aruns from his ambush throws  And thus to heaven he sends his coward vows  Apollo oh thou greatest deity  Patron of blest Soractis and of me  For we are all thy own whole woods of pine  We heap in piles which to thy glory shine  And when we trample on the fire our soles  By thee preserv'd contemn the glowing coals  My mighty patron make me wipe away▪  The shame of this dishonourable day  Nor spoils nor triumph from the deed I claim  But trust my future actions with my fame  This raging female plague but overcome  Let me return unthank'd inglorious home  Apollo heard to half his prayer inclin'd  The rest he mingles with the fleeting wind  He gives Camilla's ruin to his prayer  To see his country that was lost in air  As singing o'er the f  eld the javelin slies  Upon the queen the army turn their eyes  But she intent upon her golden prey  Nor minds nor hears it cut the hissing way  Till in her side it takes its deadly rest  And drinks the virgin purple of her breast  The trembling Amazons run to her aid  And in their arms they catch the falling maid  More quick than they the fright'ned Aruns flies  And fee's a terror mingled with his joys  He trusts no more his safety to his spear  Ev'n her expiring courage gives him fear  So runs the wolf smear'd with some shepherd's blood  And strives to gain the shelter of a wood  Before the darts his panting sides assail  And claps between his legs his shivering tail  Conscious of the audacious bloody deed  As Aruns seeks his troops stretch'd on his speed  Where in their center quaking he attends  And skulks behind the targets of his friends  She strives to draw the dart but wedg'd among  Her ribs deep to the wound the weapon clung  Then fainting rolls in death her closing eyes  While from her cheeks the chearful beauty flies  To Acca thus she breathes her last of breath  Acca that shar'd with her in all but death  Ah friend you once have seen me draw the bow  But fate and darkness hover round me now  Make haste to Turnus bid him bring with speed  His fresh reserves and to my charge succeed  Cover the city and repel the foe  Thus having said her hands the reins forego  Down from her horse she sinks then gasping lies  In a cold sweat and by degrees she dies  Her drooping neck declines upon her breast  Her swimming head with slumber is opprest  The lingering soul th' unwelcome doom receives  And murmuring with disdain the beauteous body leaves  TO MY HEART  WHAT ail'st thou oh thou trembling thing  To pant and languish in my breast  Like birds that fain would try the callow wing  And leave the downy nest  Why hast thou fill'd thyself with thought  Strange new fantastic as the air  Why to thy peaceful empire hast thou brought  That restless tyrant Care  But oh alas I ask in vain  Thou answer'st nothing back again  But in soft sighs Amyntor's name  Oh thou betrayer of my liberty  Thou fond deceiver what's the youth to thee  What has he done what has he said  That thus has conquer'd or betray'd  He came and saw but 'twas by such a light  As scarce distinguish'd day from night  Such as in thickgrown shades is found  When here and there a piercing beam  Scatters faint spangled sunshine on the ground  And casts about a melancholy gleam  But so obscure I could not see  The charming eyes that wounded thee  But they like gems by their own light  Betray'd their value through the gloom of night  I felt thee heave at every look  And stop my language as I spoke  I felt my blood fly upward to my face  While thou unguarded lay  Yielding to every word to every gra    Fond to be made a prey  I left thee watching in my eyes  And listening in my ear  Discovering weakness in thy sighs  Uneasy with thy fear  Suffering imagination to deceive  I found thee willing to believe  And with the treacherous shade conspire  To let into thyself a dangerous fire  Ah foolish wanderer say what would'st thou do  If thou should'st find at second view  That all thou fanciest now were true  If thou should'st find by day those charms  Which thus observ'd threaten undoing harms  If thou should'st find that awful mien  Not the effects of first address  Nor of my conversation disesteem  But noble native sullenness  If thou should'st find that soft goodnatur'd voice  Unus'd to insolence and noise  Still thus adorn'd with modesty  And his mind's virtues with his wit agree  Tell me thou forward lavish fool  What reason could thy fate control  Or save the ruin of thy soul  Cease then to languish for the coming day  That may direct his wandering steps that way  When I again shall the lov'd form survey  CATO's ANSWER

whom we all adore  When search'd we still find rotten at the core  An old dry bawd or a young juicy whore  Their love all false their virtue but a name  And nothing in them constant but their shame  What satyrist then that's honest can sit still  And unconcern'd see such tide of ill  With an impetuous force o'erflow the age  And not strive to restrain it with his rage  On Sin's vast army seize wing rear and van  And like impartial Death not spare a man  For where alas where is that mighty he  That is from pride deceit and envy free  Or rather is not tainted with all three  Mankind is criminal their acts their thoughts  'Tis charity to tell them of their faults  And shew their failings in a faithful glass  For who won't mend who sees himself an ass  And this design 'tis that employs my Muse  That for her daily theme she 's proud to chuse  A theme that she 'll have daily need to use  Let other poets flatter fawn and write  To get some guineas and a dinner by 't  Such mercenary wretches should they starve  They meet a kinder fate than they deserve  But she could ne'er cringe to a lord for meat  Or praise a prosperous villain though he's great  Quite contrary her practice shall appear  Unbrib'd impartial pointed and severe  That way my nature leads compos'd of gall  I must write sharply or not write at all  Though Thyrsis wings the air in towering slights  And to a wonder panegyrick writes  Though he is still exalted and sublime  Scarce to be match'd by past or present time  Though smooth and lofty all his lines appear  The thoughts all noble the expression clear  With judgement wit and sancy shining every where  Yet what instruction can from hence accrue  'Tis flattery all too fulsome to be true  Urge not for 'tis to vindicate the wrong  It causes emulation in the young  A thirst to fame while some high act they read  That prompts them to the same romantic deed  As if some powerful magick lay in rhimes  That made them braver than at other times  'Tis false and fond heroes may huff and fight  But who can merit so as he can write  To say a glowworm is the morningstar  And that it may with ease be seen as far  Were most ridiculous so far from truth  It justly would deserve a sharp reproof  That slave is more to blame whose hireling pen  Calls knaves and coxcombs wise deserving men  Says the rank bawds are all with sweetness grac'd  Courtiers all just and all courtstrumpets chaste  If to be prais'd does give a man pretence  To glory learning honesty and sense  Cromwell had much to say in his defence  Who though a tyrant which all ills comprize  Has been extoll'd and lifted to the skies  Whilst living such was the applause he gave  Counted high princely pious just and brave  And with encomiums waited to his grave  Who then would give this for a poet's praise  Which rightly understood does but debase  And blast the reputation it would raise  Hence 'tis and 'tis a punishment that 's fit  They are contemn'd and scorn'd by men of wit  'Tis true some Scots may nibble at their praise  And think it great to stand i' th' front of plays  Though most to that stupidity are grown  They waive their patron's praise to write their own  And yet they never fail of their rewards  And faith in that I cannot blame the bards  If coxcombs will be coxcombs let them rue  If they love flattery let them pay for 't too  'Tis one sure method to convince the elves  They spare my pains and satirize themselves  In short nought helps like Satyr to amend  While in huge volumes motley priests contend  And let their vain disputes ne'er have an end  They plunge us in those snares we else should shun  Like tinkers make ten holes in mending one  Our dearest friends too though they know our faults  For pity or for shame conceal their thoughts  While we who see our failings not forbid  Loosely run on in the vain paths we did  'Tis Satyr then that is our truest friend  For none before they know their faults can mend  That tells us boldly of our foulest crimes  Reproves illmanners and reforms the times  How am I then to blame when all I write  Is honest rage not prejudice or spite  Truth is my aim with truth I shall impeach  And I'll spare none that comes within its reach  On then my Musethe world before thee lies  And lash the knaves and fools that I despise  SONG OF BASSET  BY SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE  See vol I p    LET equipage and dress despair  Since Basset is come in  For nothing can oblige the fair  Like Money and Morine  Is any countess in distress  She flies not to the beau  'Tis only Cony can redress  Her

company is met  Or silent stands or leaves the place  While all the talk 's Basset  Why ladies will you stake your hearts  Where a plain cheat is found  You first are rook'd out of those darts  That

THE EARL OF MIDDLETON  Charles Middleton the second earl of that title and baron Clairmont was secretary of state for Scotland from the year to the Revolution when he followed king James into France and was attainted by the Scots parliament in He married lady Catharine daughter of Robert earl of Cardigan by whom he had two sons John lord Clairmont and Charles Middleton  esq  who were both taken at sea by admiral Byng in the descent which the French intended upon Scotland in but by the queen's orders they were soon released and died in France without issue Their father was also aboard in that armament He had two daughters ladyElizabeth wife of Edward son of James earl of Perth and lady Mary wife of sir John Gifford knight  "He is one of the pleasantest companions in the world"  Macky  "Sir William Temple told me he was a very valuable man and a good scholar I once saw him"  SWIFT MSIn Harl MSS are several of his letters to the earl of Oxford in one of which he thus recommends the chevalier Ramsay  "To a great deal of erudition he joins as many and great good qualities as I ever met in any man"  In another he tells lord Oxford who wished to exchange some literary curiosities with the French king  "You are too modest and that is not the way to deal with the people of  this  country"  An affecting story of the honourable Charles Middleton second son of the earl is related

When the whole family combine  For public pride to make her shine  Her locks which long before lay matted  Are on this day comb'd out and platted  A diamond bodkin in each tress  The badges of her nobleness  For every stone as well as she  Can boast an ancient pedigree  These form'd the jewel e  st did grace  The cap of the first Grave o' th' race  Preferr'd by Graffin Marian  T' adorn the handle of her fan  And as by old record appears  Worn since in Renigunda's years  Now sparkling in the frokin's hair  No rocket breaking in the air  Can with her starry head compare  Such ropes of pearl her arms incumber  She scarce can deal the cards at Ombre  So many rings each finger freight  They tremble with the mighty weight  The like in England ne'er was seen  Since Holbein drew Hal and his Queen  But after these fantastic flights  The lustre's meaner than the lights  The thing that bears this glittering pomp  Is but a tawdry illbred romp  Whose brawny limbs and martial face  Proclaim her of the Gothic race  More than the mangled pageantry  Of all the father's heraldry  But there's another sort of creatures  Whose ruddy look and grotesque features  Are so much out of nature's way  You'd think them stamp'd on other clay  No lawful daughters of old Adam  'Mongst these behold a city madam  With arms in mittins head in muff  A dapper cloak and reverend ruff  No farce so pleasant as this maukin  And the soft sound of Highdutch talking  Here unattended by the Graces  The Queen of Love in a sad case is  Nature her active minister  Neglects affairs and will not stir  Thinks it not worth the while to please  But when she does it for her ease  Ev'n I her most devout adorer  With wandering thoughts appear before her  And when I'm making an oblation  Am fain to spur

the Usurpation was rector of Shipton in Gloucest  rshire born Aug was a bachelor of Edm  nd Hall Oxford AB in and soon after usher to the free school at Croydon In this situation some of h  s poetry having been handed about he was honoured with a visit by the earls of Rochester and Dorset Sir Charles Sedley and other persons of distinction In he was tutor to the son of Judge Thurland and in to a son of Sir William Hickes By the advice of Sir William and the assistance of Dr Lower he applied for about a year to the study of physic but poetry being predominant he hastened to London and became a perfect votary to the bottle yet without sinking into the debauchery of his contemporary wits As he was of a very different turn from his father the character of the old parson at the end of his works is supposed to have been designed for him It is perhaps the most extravagant caricature that ever was drawn He was patronized by the earl of Kingston who would have made him his chaplain if he would have qualified himself He lived with the earl however till his death which was occasioned by the smallpox Dec He was particularly esteemed by Mr Dryden who has done him great justice in "Verses to his Memory" English Poets vol XIV p His works have been frequently printed in one volum  vo in in two volumes mo with the Author's Life and very lately under the inspection of Captain Thompson in three

Kind cup that to the stars did go  To light poor drunkards here below  Let mine be so and give me light  That I may drink and revel by 't  Yet draw no shapes of armour there  No cask nor shield nor sword nor spear  Nor wars of Thebes nor wars of Troy  Nor any other martial toy  For what do I vain armour prize  Who mind not such rough exercise  But gentler sieges softer wars  Fights that cause no

nor Bull nor Dog nor Bear  Nor any of that monstrous fry  Of animals which stock the sky  For what are stars to my design  Stars which I when drunk outshine  Outshone by every drop of wine  I lack no polestar on the brink  To guide in the wide sea of drink  But would for ever there be tost  And wish no haven seek no coast  Yet gentle artist if thou 'lt try  Thy skill then draw me let me see  Draw me first a spreading vine  Make its arms the bowl entwine  With kind embraces such as I  Twist about my loving she  Let its boughs o'erspread above  Scenes of drinking scenes of love  Draw next the patron of that tree  Draw Bacchus and soft Cupid by  Draw them both in toping shapes  Their temples crown'd with cluster'd grapes  Make them lean against the cup  As 't were to keep the figures up

of an old blasted oak  Unmindful of himself Menalcas lean'd  He sought not now in heat the shade of trees  But shunn'd the flowing river's pleasing bank  His pipe and hook lay scatter'd on the grass  Nor fed his sheep together on the plain  Left to themselves they wander'd out at large  In this lamenting state young Corydon  His friend and dear companion of his hours  Finding Menalcas asks him thus the cause  CORYDON  Thee have I sought in every shady grove  By purling streams and in each private place  Where we have us'd to sit and talk of love  Why do I find thee leaning on an oak  By lightning blasted and by thunder rent  What cursed chance has turn'd thy chearful mind  And why wilt thou have woes unknown to me  But I would comfort and not chide my friend  Tell me thy grief and let me bear a part  MENALCAS  Young Astrophell is dead dear Astrophell  He that could tune so well his charming pipe  To hear whose lays nymphs left their crystal spring  The Fawns and Dryades forsook the woods  And hearing all were ravish'dswiftest streams  Withheld their course to hear the heavenly sound  And murmur'd when by following waves prest on  The following waves forcing their way to hear  Oft the fierce wolf pursuing of the lamb  Hungry and wildly certain of his prey  Left the pursuit rather than lose the sound  Of his alluring pipe The harmless lamb  Forgot his nature and forsook his fear  Stood by the wolf and listen'd to the sound  He could command a general peace and nature would obey  This youth this youth is dead The same disease  That carry'd sweet Orinda from the world  Seiz'd upon AstrophellOh let these tears  Be offer'd to the memory of my friend  And let my speech give way awhile to sighs  CORYDON  Weep on Menalcas for his fate requires  The tears of all mankind general the loss  And general be the grief Except by fame  I knew him not but surely this is he  Who sung learn'd  Spenser  Colin's and great  "Ode on the works of Ben Jonson " N  Aegon's praise  Dead ere he liv'd yet have new life from him  Did he not mourn lamented  Lord Rochester in "A Pastoral in imitation of Moschus" N  Bion's death  In verses equal to what Bion wrote  MENALCAS  Yes this was he oh that I say he was  He that could sing the shepherds deeds so well  Whether to praise the good he turn'd his pen  Or lash'd th' egregious follies of the bad  In both he did excel  His happy genius bade him take the pen  And dictated more fast than he could write  Sometimes becoming negligence adorn'd  His verse and nature shew'd they were her own  Yet art he us'd where art could useful be  And sweated not to be correctly dull  CORYDON  Had fate allow'd his life a longer thread  Adding experience to that wondrous fraught  Of youthful vigour how would he have wrote  Equal to mighty  DrydenThis and the two following lines are wanting in the copy prefixed to Oldham's Remains N  Pan's immortal verse  He that now rules with undisputed sway  Guide of our pens crown'd with eternal bays  MENALCAS  We wish for life not thinking of its cares  I mourn his death the loss of such a friend  But for himself he dy'd in the best hour  And carry'd with him every man's applause  Youth meets not with Detraction's blotting hand  Nor suffers aught from Envy's canker'd mind  Had he known age he would have seen the world  Put on its ugliest but its truest face  Malice had watch'd the droppings of his pen  And ignorant youths who would for critics pass  Had thrown their scornful jests upon his vein  And censur'd what they did not understand  Such was not my dear Astrophell he's dead  And I shall quickly follow him What's death  But an eternal sleep without a dream  Wrapt in a lasting darkness and exempt  From hope and fear and every idle passion  CORYDON  See thy complaints have mov'd the pitying skies  They mourn the death of Astrophell in tears  Thy sheep return'd from straying round thee gaze  And wonder at thy mourning Drive them home  And tempt thy troubled mind with easing sleep  Tomorrow's chearful light may give thee comfort  REMEDY OF LOVE  BY JOHN EVELYN  Son of the great natural philosopher and born at SayesCourt near Deptford upon the th of January and was there educated with great care He was sent to Oxford in the year where he remained in the house of Dr Bathurst then president of Trinitycollege before he was admitted a gentlemancommoner which was in Easterterm It is not clear at what time he left Oxford but Mr Wood seems to be positive that he took no degree there but returned to his father's house and prosecuted his studies under his directions It is supposed however that during his residence in Trinitycollege he wrote that elegant Greek poem which is prefixed to the second edition of the Sylva and is a noble proof of the strength of his genius and wonderful progress in learning in the early part of his life He discovered his proficiency soon afterwards both in the ancient and modern languages by his elegant translations as well as his intimate acquaintance with the Muses in some original poems which were much admired His works will be mentioned presently He married Martha daughter and coheiress of Richard Spencer  esq  and having a head as well turned for business as study became one of the commissioners of the revenue in Ireland He would probably have been advanced to higher employments if he had lived but he died at his house in London upon the th of March in the th year of his age He was father of the late sir John Evelyn who was born at SayesCourt upon the d of March and created a baronet by letters patent bearing date July th This gentleman's productions in the literary way were "Of Gardens four books first written in Latin verse by Renatus Rapinus and now made English by John Evelyn  esq  " vo Considering how much he must have been obliged to hear of gardens and plantations we need not wonder that he should employ himself upon this subject His father annexed the second book of this translation to his Sylva "The life of Alexander the Great translated from the Greek of Plutarch" This was printed in the fourth volume of Plutarch's Lives by several hands "The history of the grand visiers Mahomet and Achmet Coprogli of the three last grand seigniors their sultanas and chief favourites with the most secret intrigues of the seraglio" vo This was a translation from the French and has been esteemed an entertaining and instructive history He was also author of several occasional poems the best of which are here preserved N  ESQ  WOULD you be quite cur'd of love  From your

charming face  You may find a pleasing grace  Wit or motion dress or art  Thousand things that may divert  The torments of your throbbing heart  If in this no ease you find  But constant love still plagues your mind  To your former flame return  See if still her eyes do burn  With equal force you'll find perchance  Less warmth in every amorous glance  Seeing oft what we desire  Makes us less and less admire  And will in time put out the fire  Visit her betimes each morn  Stand by her when she does adorn  Her head perhaps some borrow'd hair  Some illcontriv'd affected snare  Lewd song on table found or prayer  Nonsensical may let you see  That what you thought divinity  Is but a piece of puppetry  If still thy passion does remain  And unseen charms thy heart inchain  If she break thy sleep by night  Fly again the witch's sight  Opium take that may invite  The gentle god to calm thy soul  Peaceful slumbers Love control  Have a care of purling brooks  Of silent groves and awful shade  They but to thy torment add  Love does there with ease invade  No music hear no dying looks  Behold read no romantic books  Books and music turn the head  Fools only sing and madmen read  They with false notions fill the brain  Are only fit to entertain  Women and fops that are more vain  Love and folly still are found  In those to make the deepest wound  Who think their passions to allay  By giving of them leave to sway  Awhile but they like winter torrents grow  And all our limits overflow  Never trust thyself alone  Frequent good company and wine  In generous wines thy passion drown  That will make thee all divine  Better 'tis to drink to death  Than sigh and whine away our breath  In friends and bottles we may find  More joys than in womankind  After enjoyment women pall  Intolerable plagues they 're all  Vain foolish fond proud whimsical  Dissembling hypocritical  Wines by keeping them improve  And real friends more firmly love  If one vintage prove severe  We 're doubly recompenc'd next year  If our dearest friends we lose  Others may succeed to those  Women only of all things  Have nothing to assuage their stings  Curs'd is the man that does pursue  The

mind and chearful heart  The world will call his virtue pride  His holy life design and art  The reign of Vice is absolute  While good men vainly strive to rise  They may declaim they may dispute  But

Design'd the liberty of Rome  In vain did Caesar's arms control  And at Pharsalia was o'ercome  His virtue constant in distress  In Ptolemy no pity bred  Who barely guided by success  Secur'd his

 Was Virtue which he had ador'd  Haunted by spectres overnight  Fell the next day on his own sword  If when his hope of victory lost  This noble Roman could exclaim  Oh Virtue whom I courted most  I

in Mr Walpole's Catalogue of engravers  " The printer's profit not my pride  " Hath this idea signified  " For he push'd out the merry play  " And Mr Gaywood made it gay"  These lines have misled Mr Granger who too hastily concluded that the facetious author must of course have been a  dramatic  writer His "Merry Play" was evidently no other than his "Norfolk Drollery" Though very possibly he possessed a  "share of that vanity which adheres to human nature"  his poems are certainly introduced by two modest dedications one to the most virtuous and ingenious Madam Mary Hunt of Sharington Hall the other to his noble friend Thomas Brown  esq  of Elsing Hall N    HERE let his reverend dust in silence sleep  I could add tears were't not a sin to weep  Which heathens wont what else in grief should we  But doubt or envy his felicity  Death as in duty came and snuff'd the light  As who should say to make it shine more bright  As to the shuttingin of nature's day  His evening red was but his morning grey  The elements disputed Death's control  Nature was loath to part with such a soul  As to his quality he doubly owes  But which to birth or breeding more who knows  The first has him among the great ones reckon'd  And in the second he to none was second  But some have troubled at his passion been  Why should they so a fly will have her spleen  He could be angry and who lives

each grateful stone presents  From th' humble base to th' highest battlements  Others themselves wrap up in lasting lead  But he wrapt up the church in his own stead  Whose pinacle he rear'd so high it even  Climbs up the clouds to reach his alms to heaven  Upon whose top St Peter may behold  His monitor in characters of gold  Not but in this others pretend a share  But the dead challenge what

Thrice has the frozen Ister stood and thrice  The Euxine sea been cover'd o'er with ice  Ten tedious years of siege the Trojans bore  But count my sorrow I have suffer'd more  For me alone old Chronus stops his glass  For years like ages slowly seem to pass  Long days diminish not my nightly care  Both night and day their equal portion share  The course of nature sure is chang'd with me  And all is endless as my misery  Do Time and Heaven their common motion keep  Or are the Fates that spin my thread asleep  In Euxine Pontus here I hide my face  How good the name but oh how bad the place  The people round about us threaten war  Who live by spoils and thieves or pirates are  No living thing can here protection have  Nay scarce the dead are quiet in their grave  For here are birds as well as men of prey  That swiftly snatch unseen the limbs away  Darts are slung at us by the neighbouring foe  Which oftentimes we gather as we go  He who dares plough but few there are who dare  Must arm himself as if he went to war  The shepherd puts his helmet on to keep  Not from the wolves but enemies his sheep  While mournfully he tunes his rural Muse  One foe the shepherd and his sheep pursues  The castle which the safest place should be  Within from cruel tumults is not free  Oft dire contentions put me in a fright  The rude inhabitants with Grecians fight  In one abode amongst a barbarous rout  I live but when they please they thrust me out  My hatred to these brutes takes from my fear  For they are like the beasts whose skins they wear  Ev'n those who as we think were born in Greece  Wrap themselves up in rugs and Persian frize  They easily each other understand  But I alas am forc'd to speak by hand  Ev'n to these men if I may call them so  Who neither what is right or reason know  I a Barbarian am hard fate to see  When I speak Latin how they laugh at me  Perhaps they falsely add to my disgrace  Or call me wretched exile to my face  Besides the cruel sword 'gainst Nature's laws  Cuts off the innocent without a cause  The marketplace by lawless arms possest  Has slaughterhouses both for man and beast  Now O ye Fates 'tis time to stop my breath  And shorten my misfortunes by my death  How hard my sentence is to live among  A cutthroat barbarous and unruly throng  But to leave you my friends a harder doom  Though banish'd here I left my heart at Rome  Alas I left it where I cannot come  After having continued long in favour at the court of Augustus he fell under that Emperor's displeasure in the fiftieth year of his age He says in several parts of his works the causes of his misery were two his having composed books on the Art of Love and his having  seen something  He does not tell what it was he saw but gives us to understand that his books contributed less to his disgrace than that did and on his complaining to Love that after labouring to enlarge  his  empire he obtained nothing for his reward but banishment Love answers  " Utque hoc sic utinam defendere caetera posses  " Scis aliud quod te laeserit esse magis"  De Ponto l iii ep  And in his second book De Tristibus l ii ver he compares himself to unfortunate Actaeon who had undesignedly seen Diana naked and suffered for it Various attempts have been made to conjecture what he  saw  but it still remains an uncertainty N    To be forbid the city I confess  That were but just my crime deserves no less  A place so distant from my native air  Is more than I deserve or long can bear  Why do I mourn the fate I here attend  Is a less grief than Caesar to offend  ELEGY ON DR WHITAKER  King's professor and master of St John's College Cambridge he died in This clegy was annexed to the "Carmen Funebre Caroli Horni " N    BY MR JOSEPH HALL  The reader is here presented with a beautiful poem at present entirely unknown by the ingenious and learned divine who early in life distinguished himself by his "Virgidemiarum Satires in six books " reprinted at Oxford vo He was born and educated at AshbydelaZouch and at was sent to Emanuel College Cambridge where he regularly obtained his degrees and a fellowship and read the rhetoric lecture in the public schools for two years with great applause In the prologue to the "Virgidemiarum" he calls himself the first satyrist in the English language  " I first adventure follow me who list  " And be the second English satyrist"  About he was presented to the rectory of Halsted in Suffolk and soon after married a wise with whom he lived happily years In he accompanied sir Edward Bacon to the Spa where he composed his second "Century of Meditations" In he took the degree of DD obtained the donative of Waltham Holy Cross in Essex and a little before had been made chaplain to prince Henry was made a prebendary of the collegiate church of Wolve  hampton dean of Worcester whilst absent in France on an embassy with lord Hay in attended the king into Scotland as chaplain in and was sent to the synod of Dort in where he preached an admired Latin sermon He refused the bishoprick of Gloucester in accepted that of E  eter in and in November was translated to Norwich He was committed to the Tower on the th of January whence in June he was released on giving l bail Withdrawing to Norwich he lived there in tolerable quiet till April But then the order for sequestering notorious delinquents being passed in which he was included by name all his rents were stopped and he had nothing to live on but what the parliament allowed him all the while suffering the greatest inconveniences which he has given an account of in a piece intitled his "Hard Measure" In the year he retired to a little estate which he rented at Higham near Norwich and in this retirement he ended his life on the th of September in the d year of his age He was buried in the churchyard of that parish without any memorial for in his will he has this passage  "I do not hold God's house a meet repository for the dead bodies of the greatest faints"  He is universally allowed to have been a man of great wit and learning and of as great meekness modesty and piety He was so great a lover of study that he earnestly wished his health would have allowed him to do it even to excess His works besides the Satires abovementioned make in all five volumes in folio and quarto and  "are filled says Mr Bayle with fine thoughts excellent morality and a great deal of piety"  His writings shew that he was very zealous against popery neither was he more favourable to those who separated from the motherchurch without an extreme necessity He lamented the divisions of protestants and wrote something with a view of putting an end to them N    BINDE ye my browes with mourning cyparisse  And palish twigs of deadlie poplar tree  Or if some

English Poets vol XI p N    OF all heaven's judgments that was sure the worst  When our bold fathers were at Babel curst  Man to whose race this glorious orb was given  Nature's lov'd darling and the joy of heaven  Whose powerful voice the subject world obey'd  And gods were pleas'd with the discourse he made  He who before did every form excel  Beneath the most ignoble creature fell  Every vile beast through the wide earth can rove  And where the sense invites declare his love  Sounds inarticulate move through all the  ace  And one short language serves for every place  But such a price did that presumption cost  That half our lives in trifling words are lost  Nor can their utmost force and power express  The soul's ideas in their native dress  Knowledge that godlike orn'ment of the mind  To the small spot where it is born 's confin'd  But he brave youth the toilsome fate repeals  While his learn'd pen mysterious truth reveals  So did of old the cloven tongues descend  And Heaven's commands to every ear extend  And 'twas but just that all th' astonish'd throng  Should understand the Galileans tongue  God's sacred law was for all Israel made  And in plain terms to every tribe display'd  On marble pillars his Almighty hands  In letters large wrote the divine commands  But scarce they were so much in pieces broke  When Moses' wrath the people did provoke  As has the sacred cowl been torn and rent  T' explain what the Allwise Dictator meant  But now t' our Egypt the great Prophet 's come  And eloquent Aaron tells the joyful doom  From the worst slavery at last we 're freed  And shall no more with stripes from error bleed  The learned Simon has th' hard task subdued  And holy tables the third time renew'd  Sinai be bless'd where was receiv'd the law  That ought to keep the rebel world in awe  And bless'd be he that taught us to invoke  God's awful name as God to Moses spoke  Nor does he merit less who could so well  From foreign language his great dictates tell  In our cold clime the pregnant soul lay hid  No virtual power mov'd the prolific seed  Till his kind genial heat preserv'd it warm  And to perfection wrought the noble form  Never did yet arrive so vast a store  Of solid learning on the British shore  T' export it thence has been the greatest trade  But he at last a full return has made  Raise up ye tuneful bards your voices raise  And crown his head with neverdying praise  And all ye Nimrod's mighty sons rejoice  While ev'ry workman knows the builder's voice  In Shinar's plain the lofty tower may rise  Till its vast head sustain the bending skies  In its own nature Truth is so divine  No sacred powers oppose this great design  So dark a veil obscur'd her reverend head  The wisest travellers knew not where to tread  Blind zeal and mad enthusiasts shew'd the way  While wandering meteors led their eyes astray  Through the dark maze without a clue they ran  And at best ended where they first began  But now at last we 're brought so

was one of the children of Mr Matthew Boyse of Leeds well known by his controversial writings against Abp KingSamuel was born in and received his education at Dublin at he was sent to the university of Glasgow and marrying before he was returned to Dublin with his wife where the conduct of neither was commendable The husband who had no graces of person and fewer still of conversation passed his time in abject trifling the wife in intrigue and their extravagance reduced his father to indigence In young Boyse resided at Edinburgh where he published a volume of poems addressed to the countess of Egleton the patroness of all men of wit Here also Mr Boyse particularly distinguished himself by an elegy called "The Tears of the Muses" on the death of the viscountess Stormont which introduced him to the noble viscount and also to the dutchess of Gordon who had engaged for him an office in the customs which he lost by an unpardonable remissness The dutchess sent him to London with recommendations to Mr Pope and the lord chancellor King He went to Twickenham but the po  not being at home he never repeated the visit by the peer he was most graciously received From this period he wrote many poems but those though excellent in their kind and sufficient it is said to have filled at least six volumes were lost to the world by being introduced with no advantage He had so strong a propensity to groveling that his acquaintance were generally of such a cast as could be of no service to him and those in higher life he addressed by letters not having sufficient confidence or politeness to converse familiarly with them a freedom to which he was intitled by the power of his genius His genius was not confined to poetry only but he had a taste for painting music and heraldry with the latter of which he was well acquainted Many of his poems are in the Gent Mag signed Y and Alceus In he published his "Albion's Triumph" an ode on the battle of Dettingen and in or about wrote an admirable poem called "The Deity" which Mr Pope declared on its publication contained many lines of which he should not be ashamed It was also commended by the late Henry Fielding who gave a quotation from it see Tom Jones B vii  and at the same time very justly styled it  a noble on  This unfortunate man by addicting himself to low vices among which were gluttony and extravagance rendered himself so contemptible and wretched that he frequently was without the least subsistence for days together After squan  ring away in a dirty manner any money which he acquired he has been known to pawn all his apparel and in that state was frequently confined to his bed sitting up with his arms through holes in a blanket writing verses in order to procure the means of existence It seems hardly credible but it is certainly true that he was more than once in that deplorable  ituation and to the end of his life never derived any advan  ge from the experience of his past sufferings A late col  ector of poems Mr Giles says he was informed by Mr  by the bookseller that this unhappy man at last was  nd dead in his bed with a pen in his hand and in the  of writing in the same manner

sacred seat of Stuart's majestic line  Those rising towers that known to ancient fame  Bear both the Monarch's and the Martyr's name  Near those fair lawns and intermingled groves  Where gentle Zephyrs breathe and sporting Loves  A frame there stands that rears its beauteous height  And strikes with pleasing ravishment the sight  Full on the front the orient sun displays  His chearful beams and as his light decays  Again adorns it with his western rays  Here wondering crowds admire the owner's state  And view the glories of the fair and great  Here falling statesmen Fortune's changes feel  And prove the turns of her revolving wheel  Then envy mighty Arlington thy life  That feels no tempest and that knows no strife  Whence every jarring sound is banish'd far  The restless vulgar and the noisy bar  But heavenly Peace that shuns the courtiertrain  And Innocence and conscious Virtue reign  Here when Aurora brings the purple day  And opening buds their tender leaves display  While the fair vales afford a smiling view  And the fields glitter with the morning dew  No rattling wheel disturbs the peaceful ground  Or wounds the ear with any jarring sound  Th' unwearied eye with ceaseless rapture strays  And still variety of charms surveys  The house and gardens were situated at the North E  corner of the Green Park where Arlingtonstreet stands N    Here watch the fearful deer their tender fawns  Stray through the wood or browze the verdant lawns  Here from the marshy glade the wildduck springs  And slowly moves her wet incumber'd wings  Around soft Peace and Solitude appear  And golden Plenty crowns the smiling year  Thy beauteous gardens charm the ravish'd sight  And surfeit every sense with soft delight  Wheree'er we turn our still transported eyes  New scenes of Art with Nature join'd arise  We dwell indulgent on the lovely scene  The lengthen'd vista or the carpet green  A thousand graces bless th' inchanted ground  And throw promiscuous beauties all around  Within thy fair parterres appear to view  A thousand flowers of various form and hue  There spotless lilies rear their sickly heads  And purple violets creep along the beds  Here shews the bright jonquil its gilded face  Join'd with the pale carnation's fairer grace  The painted tulip and the blushing rose  A blooming wilderness of sweets compose  In such a scene great Cupid wounded lay  To Love and Psyche's charms a glorious prey  Here felt the pleasing pain and thrilling smart  And prov'd too well his own resistless dart  High in the midst appears a rising ground  With greens and

unfriendly climate live  For when bleak Winter chills the rolling year  The guarded strangers find their safety here  And fenc'd from storms and the inclement air  They sweetly flourish ever green and fair  Their lively buds they shoot and blossoms show  And gaily bloom amidst surrounding snow  But when the genial Spring all Nature chears  And Earth renew'd her verdant honours wears  The golden

amorous joy  Unmindful of approaching night they sport  While circling pleasures new attention court  Or through the Maze forgetfully they stray  Lost in the pleasing sweetlywinding way  Or stretch'd at ease upon the flowery grass  In tales of love the starry night they pass  While the soft nightingale through all the groves  His song repeats and sooths his tender loves  Whose strains harmonious

songster who dost bring  Joy and music to the Spring  Welcome to our grateful swains  And the nymphs that grace the plains  How the youths thy absence mourn  What their joy at thy return  For their mirth and sports are done  All the year that thou are gone  But at thy approach their joys  Take new date from they dear voice  Every shepherd chooses then  Some fair nymph for Valentine  While the maid with equal love  Does the happy choice approve  Underneath some shade he sits  Where soft silence Love begets  And in artless fighs he bears  Untaught passion to her ears  No deceit is in his tongue  Nor she fears nor suffers wrong  But each other's faith believe  And each hour their loves revive  Often have I wish'd to be  Happy Damon blest as thee  Not that I for Sylvia pine  Sylvia who is only thine  But that Chloe cannot be  Kind as Sylvia is to thee  Thou dear bird whose voice may find  Charms perhaps to make her kind  Bear a message to her breast  And make me happy as the rest  In the place  London in the Plottime  where tumult dwells  Treasons lurk ambition swells  Pride erects her monstrous head  And Perjury swears the guiltless dead  Power oppresses Envy pines  Friends betray and Fraud designs  Fears and Jealousy surprize  Rest and slumber from our eyes  And where Vice all ill contains  And in gloomy glory reigns  Where the loyal brave and just  Are victims to fanatic lust  Where the noble Stafford's blood  Calls from Heaven revenge aloud  In this place there lives a maid  Bright as Nature ever made  Fair beyond dull beauty's name  Can express her lovely frame  In her charming eyes reside  Love Disdain Desire and Pride  Such we know not which to call  But has the excellence of all  The first blushes of the day  Or the newblown rose in May  Or the aich Sidonian dye  Wrought for Eastern majesty  Is not gayer than the red  Nature on her cheeks has spread  Her soft lips still feed new wishes  Of a thousand fancy'd kisses  Gently swelling plump and round  With young Smiles and Graces crown'd  Her round breasts are whiter far  Than the backs of ermins are  Or the wanton breast of Jove  When a swan for Leda's love  Eyes that charm whene'er they dart  And never miss the destin'd heart  Would'st thou have me tell thee more  And describe her beauties o'er  I perhaps might make a rape  On my Idea's naked shape  Therefore fly you'll quickly see  By this picture which is she  Tell her the loud winds are dumb  Winter's past and Spring is come  The delightful Spring that rains  Sweets and plenty o'er the plains  And with shady garlands crown'd  All the woods and groves around  If she see the winged quire  Chuse this season to retire  To the shelter of the grove  'Tis by instinct say of Love  If she see the herds and flocks  Wanton round the meads and rocks  Thus their wishing males to move  'Tis the instinct say of Love  If she see the bull among  Crowds of females sleek and young  Fight his rival of the drove  'Tis by instinct say of Love  If she see the blooming vines  In their season fold their twines  Round the oak that near her grows  Say 'tis Nature mix'd their boughs  Then if instinct these do move  We by reason ought to love  Tell the fairone every day  Youth and beauty steal away  And within a little space  Will destroy her charming face  Every grace and smile that lies  Languishing in lips and eyes  First he'll make his prey and then  Leave to Death what does remain  Who old Time does only send  To begin what he must end  If she ask what hour and place  Where and when Time wounds the face  Say it is not in the night  Nor when day renews her light  In the morning or at noon  Or at evening when alone  Or when entertain'd at home  Or abroad this hour will come  But swift Time is always by  First to perfect then destroy  And in vain you seek a cure  Since his wounds are every hour  Bid her view Aurelia's brow  Naked of her glories now  Yet she once could charm the throng  Conquering with her eyes and tongue  Now only 's left this weak relief  To support her years and grief  When she could she us'd her prime  And enjoy'd the fruits of time  And whereever she profest  Love or hate she kill'd or blest  While the neighbouring plains were fill'd  With their names she lov'd and kill'd  Oh when youth and beauty's past  That poor pleasure that does last  Is to think they were admir'd  And by every youth desir'd  While the dotage of each swain  She return'd with scorn again  Oh then let my Chloe know  When her youth is faded so  And a race of nymphs appears  Gay and sprightly in their years  Proud and wanton in their loves  While the shepherds of the groves  Strive with presents who shall share  Most the favours of the fair  And herself she does behold  Like Aurelia now grown old  Sighing to herself she'll say  I was once ador'd as they  Yet with pleasure think that she  Lov'd and was belov'd by me  Therefore bid her haste and prove  While she may the joys of Love  I will lead her to a soil  Where perpetual Summers smile  Without Autumn which bereaves  Fairest cedars of their leaves  Where she shall behold the meads  Ever green the groves with shades  Lasting flowers the banks shall wear  And birds shall warble all the year  Where the rustic swain does owe  Nothing to the spade and plow  For their harvest Nature's care  Without toil relieves them there  And no differing seasons bring  Changes to the constant Spring  In the morn she shall awake  With the noise the shepherds make  Chearing with the echoing sounds  Of their horns the eager hounds  Nymphs as well as shepherds too  In these groves the chace pursue  While at their backs their flowing hair  Loosely wantons in the air  Gilded quivers on their thighs  With darts less fatal than their eyes  Each the other's sloth does blame  While they seek the hart for game  Who poor fool his feet employs  And through woods and dales he flies  Over plains and rivers bounds  And outflies the winds and hounds  When perhaps some nymph whose eyes  Makes both men and beast her prize  Swifter than Camilla's pace  Soon o'ertakes the winged race  And with one bright glance she wounds  And his fancy'd hope confounds  Who reflecting his faint eyes  On her face with pleasure dies  When the sports are done they rest  Underneath some shade and feast  On sweet beds of violets crown'd  With sweet roses on the ground  Where they garlands weave and poses  Of green myrtle pinks and roses  For which grace the ravish'd swains  Pay soft kisses for their pains  Thus they dally till the light  Falls behind the scene of night  SONG  I  GO tell Amynta gentle swain  I would not die nor dare complain  Thy tuneful voice with numbers join  Thy words will more prevail than mine  To souls oppress'd and dumb with grief  The Gods ordain this kind relief  That music should in sounds convey  What dying lovers dare not say  II  A sigh or tear perhaps she'll give  But Love on Pity cannot live  Tell her that hearts for hearts were made  And Love with Love is only paid  Tell her my pains so fast encrease  That soon they will be past redress  But ah the wretch that speechless lies  Attends but Death to close his eyes  ON THE KING'S HOUSE BUILDING AT WINCHESTER  On or near the scite of King Arthur's Castle king Charles II in laid the foundation of a magnificent royal palace only the shell of which was finished A cupola was designed feet higher than the roof which would have been seen at sea and a street was intended leading from the West end of the chathedral to the centre of the front The length of the whole is feet A park was also projected ten miles in circumference but the death of the king prevented the progress and execution of this noble plan The palace is at present converted into a commodious prison for French prisoners of war See Warton's Description of Winchester p N    AS soon as mild Augustus could assuage  A bloody civil war's licentious rage  He made the blessing that he gave increase  By teaching Rome the softer arts of peace  The sacred temples wanting due repair  Had first their wounds heal'd with a pious care  Nor ceas'd his labour till proud Rome outvy'd  In glory all the subject world beside  Thus Charles in peace returning to our isle  With building did his regal cares beguile  London almost consum'd but to a name  He rescues from the fierce devouring flame  Its hostile rage the burning town enjoy'd  For he restor'd as fast as that destroy'd  'Twas quickly burnt and quickly built again  The double wonder of his halcyon reign  Of Windsor castle his belov'd retreat  From this vast city troublesomely great  'Twas Denham only with success could write  The nation's glory and the king's delight  On Winchester my Muse her song bestows  She that small tribute to her country owes  To Winchester let Charles be ever kind  The youngest labour of his fertile mind  Here ancient kings the British sceptre sway'd  And all kings since have always been obey'd  Rebellion here could ne'er erect a throne  For Charles that blessing was reserv'd alone  Let not the stately fabric you decree  An immature abortive palace be  But may it grow the mistress of your heart  And the full heir of Wren's stupendous art  The happy spot on which its sovereign dwells  With a just pride above the city swells  That like a loyal subject chose to lie  Beneath his feet with humble modesty  Fast by a  everend church extends its wings  And pays due homage to the best of kings  Nature like Law a monarch will create  He's situated head of Church and State  The graceful Temple that delights his eye  Luxurious toil of former piety  Has vanquish'd envious Time's devouring rage  And like Religion stronger grows by age  It stems the torrent of the flowing years  Yet gay as youth the sacred pile appears  Of its great rise we no records have known  It has outliv'd all memory but its own  About the year bishop Walkelyne began the present edifice on the s  ite of an older and finished the tower the choir the transept and probably the West end The whole was nobly improved by William of Wykeham the munificent founder of New College Oxford in and by bishop Fox the pious founder of Corpus Chris  i College in Oxford who was bishop of Winchester from to See Warton p seqq N    The monumental marbles us assure  It gave the Danish monarchs sepulture  Here Death himself inthrones the crowned head  For every tomb's a palace to the dead  But now my Muse nay rather all the nine  In a full chorus of applauses join  Of your great Wykeham  Wykeham whose name can mighty thoughts infuse  But nought can ease the travail of my Muse  Press'd with her load her feeble strength decays  And she's deliver'd of abortive praise  Here he for youth erects a nursery  The great coheiress of his piety  The first

officers of the choir See Warton p N    Where they through various tongues coy knowledge trace  This is the barrier of their learned race  From which they start and all along the way  They to their God and for their sovereign pray  And from their infancies are taught t' obey  Oh may they never vex the quiet nation  And turn apostates to their education  When with these objects Charles has fill'd

plate the glorious victor's meed  Over the course they rather fly than run  In a wide circle like the radiant sun  Then fresh delights they for their prince prepare  And hawks the swiftwing'd coursers

 ON THE DEATH OF MELANTHA  WEEP all ye virgins weep o'er this sad hearse  And you great goddess of immortal verse  Come here a while and mourn  Weave not with rosy crowns your hair  Let tears be all the gems you wear  And shed them plentifully on this urn  For 'tis Melantha 'tis that lovely fair  That lies beneath this weeping marble here  But would you know why she has took her flight  Into the bosom of eternal night  Before her beauties scarce had shew'd their light  Ha  k and lament her fate  As the young God of Love one day  Sat on a rock at play  And wantonly let fly his darts  Among the nymphs and shepherds hearts  Melantha by unhappy chance came by  Love jesting cry'd I'll make her prove  The godhead she contemn'd of Love  In scorn she bade him strike and did his shaft defy  While the boy slightly threw a dart  To wound but not destroy her heart  But greedy Death fond of this beauteous prey  Caught the swift arrow as it flew  And added to 't his own strength too  Which made so deep a wound that as she lay  In silent sighs she breath'd her soul away  Then all the little gods began to weep  Oh let your sighs with theirs due measure keep  For fair Melantha she is dead  Her beauteous soul to Death's dark empire 's fled  Flora the bounteous goddess of the plains  Who in fresh groves and sweetest meadows reigns  Hearing the fair Melantha dead  Brought all her odorous wealth to spread  Over the grave where she was laid  Then straight the infant spring began to fade  And all the fields where she did keep  And sold her bleating flocks of sheep  Their influence lost with her fair eyes decay'd  For fair Melantha by whose cruel pride  So many sad despairing swains had dy'd  Felt love at last but death she rather chose  Than own she lov'd or the hid flame disclose  Speak Muses for ye hold immortal state  With gods and know the mysteries of Fate  You all whatever 's past or present see  And read th' unwritten pages o'er  Of Time's great chronicle before  Events and Time had writ what Fate resolv'd should be  Tell me what Beauty is whose force controls  Reason and power and over mankind rules  Kings stoop to Beauty and the crowns they wear  Shine not with so much lustre as the Fair  Beauty a larger empire does command  Than the great monarch of the seas and land  She can the coldest anchorites inflame  Cool tyrants' rage and stroke their passions tame  She can call youth to her forsaken seat  In wither'd veins and give new life and heat  She can subdue the fierce the proud and strong  Give courage to the weak the fearful and the young  Beauty the only deity we know  With fear and awe we to her altars go  And there our purest zeal of prayers and vows bestow  Sure then it only seems to die  And when it leaves us mounts above  To the eternal roof of Jove  To be a constellation and inrich the sky  But should I search the spangled sphere  For metamorphos'd beauty there  Nothing of Helen now is seen  Nor the fair Egyptian queen  Or thou whose eyes were constellations here  Oh then thy fate we can't enough deplore  With thee thy beauty dy'd and 'tis no more  Then let us give Melantha's fate its due  Strew cypress on her hearse and wreaths of yew  For fair Melantha poor Melantha 's dead  Her sighing soul to Death's eternal empire 's fled  THE COURTPROSPECT  BY MR CHARLES HOPKINS  Son of Ezekiel bishop of Londonderry who married the lady Araminta one of the daughters of John lord Robartes of Truro afterwards earl of Radnor He was born at Exeter but his father being taken chaplain to Ireland by lord Robartes when lord lieutenant in our poet received the early part of his education at Trinity College Dublin and afterwards was a student at Cambridge On the rebellion in Ireland in he returned thither and exerted his early valour in the cause of his country religion and liberty When public tranquillity was restored he came again into England and fell into an acquaintance with gentlemen of the best wit whose age and genius were most agreeable to his own In he published some "Epistolary Poems and Translations" which will all be inserted in this volume and in he shewed his genius as a dramatic writer by "Pyrrhus king of Egypt" a tragedy to which Mr Congreve wrote the epilogue see English Poets vol XXIX p He published that year "The History of Love" a connexion of select fables from Ovid's Metamorphoses which by the sweetness of his numbers and easiness of his thoughts procured him considerable reputation With Mr Dryden in particular he became a great favourite He afterwards published the "Art of Love" which Jacob says  "added to his fame and happily brought him acquainted with the earl of Dorset and other persons of distinction who were fond of his company through the agreeableness of his temper and the pleasantry of his conversation It was in his power to have made his fortune in any scene of life but he was always more ready to serve others than mindful of his own affairs and by the excesses of hard drinking and a too passionate fondness for the fair sex he died a martyr to the cause in the th year of his age"  I shall preserve in this collection an admirable Hymn  "written about an hour before his death when in great pain"  His "CourtProspect" in which many of the principal nobility are very handsomely complimented is called by Jacob  "an excellent piece"  and of his other poems he adds  "that they are all remarkable for the purity of their diction and the harmony of their numbers"  Mr Hopkins was also the author of two other tragedies "Boadicea Queen of Britain" and "Friendship improved or the Female Warrior" with a humorous prologue comparing a poet to a merchant a comparison which will hold in most part  culars except that of accumulating wealth Our author who was at Londonderry when this tragedy came out inscribed it to Edward Coke of Norfolk esquire in a dedication dated Nov so modest and pathetic that I am persuaded I shall stand excused if I print it at full length  "The greatest and indeed almost the only advantage a poet reaps from what he writes is the opportunities he meets with of making himself known to the best and greatest men of his age A play is first made public in the theatre and when it comes to the press if any one has spoken kindly and favourably of it in the representation the poet chooses him for his patron he having before according to the author's construction chosen him for his poet The distance I am at from the city and even from the kingdom too will keep me ignorant for some time what success this play which I humbly offer to your patronage may meet with If the town is pleased with it I shall be pleased with myself for pleasing them if they condemn it I shall be apt to conclude so many in the right rather than my single self You saw it in manuscript and I have this early and auspicious advantage that you approve of it Boadicea pleased them and I received a very great additional satisfaction when I understood how particularly it pleased you I will not go to compare that play and this together nor follow the custom of reckoning the last performance best and shewing the greatest fondness of the youngest brat The rhyme was the only thing that recommended that and for aught I know the only thing too that can recommend this I could wish for something distinguishing in it because it is sacred to you and I should desire to be known to you at advantage If the pains in writing will endear it to you it cost me much more than the former It has some sort of design besides such as it is but I was never very guilty of plotting I can hardly keep the characters in my play from being as honest and sincere as I would be myself in a dedication A vicious character disturbs me while I draw it and it grates me to delineate a villain 'Tis certain no poet can excite any passion in another if he does not feel it first in himself Who then will choose to describe discontent envy or revenge when they may have such fair fields as honour and virtue to range in All there is bright before them and the flight the Muse takes the  s heavenwards Such characters artfully and justly drawn will excite the good and great to be patrons and such patrons as you Sir will soon teach poets to draw such characters You are endowed with all the blessings of Nature and Fortune and you are as liberal of the gifts of the latter to others as she has been to you So great is your estate it would be unwieldy to have it more and such good use is made of it that Envy does not wish it less It is not consumed in vain and superfluous equipage but laid out in maintaining the old open English hospitality Desert in want is supplied and Honesty in distress is succoured and sustained great without titles and good above greatness rich rather to others than yourself and seeming only as your own steward Your inclinations and endeavours are the general good of mankind and none ever went from you dissatisfied delighted in obliging others and pleased to see them pleased with your bounty Wishing the welfare of all men and speaking well of all men is a sure way to meet with an universal return of good will and good wishes He doubly enjoys his fortune who has it wished double by all that know him Among the prayers of others accept of the praises of the poet humbly and heartily though feebly offered I now begin to experience how much the mind may be influenced by the body My Muse is confined at present to a weak and sickly tenement and the winter season will go near to overbear her together with her houshold There are storms and tempests to beat her down or frosts to bind her  and kill her and she has no friend on her side but youth to bear her through if that can sustain the attack and hold out till spring comes to relieve me one use I shall make of farther life shall be to shew how much I am Sir your most devoted humble servant CHARLES HOPKINS"  His feelings were prophetic he died I believe in the course of that winter N    TO THE DUTCHESS OF ORMOND    MADAM that your Grace has been pleased to speak favourably of what I have already writ  is encouragement sufficient for a poet to boast of to the world and to embolden him to dedicate to your Grace  But I have more particular both obligations and excuses your illustrious consort's family having been the  constant pations of ours which now depress'd by the late wars and the chief pillar of it fallen must depend  for support on the first founders  The fate of this eminent but unfortunate prelate was extremely singular He was born at Sandford in Devonshire became choirister of Magdalen College Oxford in at the age of about was educated under Presbyterian a  d Independent discipline and about the time of the Restoration became assistant to Dr Spurstow of Hackney He was afterwards elected preacher at one of the city churches but the bishop of London refused to admit him as he was a popular preacher among the Fanatics He then obtained St Mary's church at Exeter was countenanced by bishop Ward and much admired for the comeliness of his person and elegance of preaching The lord Robartes in particular was so pleased with him that he gave him one of his daughters in marriage took him chaplain to Ireland in gave him the deanry of Raphoe and recommended him so effectually to his successor lord Berkeley that he was consecrated bishop of Raphoe October and translated to Londonderry in Driven thence by the forces under the earl of Tyrconnel in he retired into England and was elected minister of Aldermanbury in September where he died on the th of June He published expositions on the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments and five single Sermons N  Thus the thanks for past favours are only petitions for more as some men  pay off old debts in hopes to run deeper in for new I dare not hope the ensuing essay can merit your Grace's approbation let it if possible please others if it meets with your pardon it will abundantly satisfy the ambition of your Grace's most devoted most humble servant  CHARLES HOPKINS  TO THE READER  SOME writers perhaps may expect the thanks and favour of the nobility after attempting their praise but I am rather afraid of having incurred their displeasure they whom I have mentioned I doubt may with more reason find fault with me than they whom I have omitted for it is better not to be drawn at all than to be drawn imperfectly and lamely The poet however has the same excuse with the painter that art cannot equal nature nor the pencil nor the pen present a copy that comes up to her original The business of a poet is to please and he is very unhappy who gives offence where he designs acknowledgments or respects The whole body of the nobility of England would be a boundless subject painters own they find it more difficult to give a true and lively air and posture to a picture to place the legs and duly proportion all the parts than to draw the face and take the likeness but this piece was only intended for an halflength and that too is only a rough draught and in miniature Though the following lines may want an excuse with the criticks  I will not despair of pardon from the nobles to whom it was designed and if I have failed in describing their greatness I have at the same time given them an opportunity of shewing their goodness  ABOVE that bridge which lofty turrets crown  Joining two cities of itself a town  As far as fair Augusta's buildings reach  Bent like a bow along a peaceful beach  Her gilded spires the royal palace show  Towering to clouds and fix'd in floods below  The silver Thames washes her sacred sides  And pays her prince her tributary tides  Thither all nations of the earth resort  Not only England's now but Europe's court  Bless'd in the warriors which its walls contain  Bless'd most in William's residence and reign  Where in his royal robes and regal state  He meditates and dictates Europe's fate  His heroes and his nobles standing round  Better by them than his gold circle crown'd  O could I represent that glorious show  You whose great deeds form poets tell me how  But lest my Muse which much I fear should faint  What Dryden will not write let Dauly  From the manner in which this painter is mentioned he appears to have been a person of eminence in his profession His name however occurs neither in Mr Walpole's valuable work nor in Mr Pilkington's N  paint  Haste then and spread abroad thy canvass sheets  Wide as the fullblown sails that wing our fleets  Paint William first on an imperial throne  Large share of earth and all the seas his own  O'er land and ocean let his realm extend  And like his fame his empire never end  Give him that look which monarchs ought to have  Give him that awful look which nature gave  Mix majesty with mildness while he shows  Dear to his friends and dreadful to his foes  Seat him surrounded by his British peers  And make them seem his strength as he is theirs  No poet here dares sing the noble tribe  Which you can better draw than he describe  You can plant each in his peculiar place  Give each the noblest features in his face  Each has his charms and all some certain grace  Let England's Chancellor  The great lord Somers N  the foremost stand  That is his due whose laws support the land  Who governs influenc'd by his sovereign lord  And holds the balance as the king the sword  Give the good Shrewsbury the second seat  In trust in secrecy and council great  Great as the best will the great Ormond seem  But in the field thou must delineate him  Born with auspicious stars and happy fate  But more in merit than in fortune great  On higher things he bends his nobler aim  And in fierce wars has sought and purchas'd fame  Here could my grateful willing Muse have sung  Sweet as Cham flows when first her harp was strung  Here Somerset should she thy praise proclaim  And give thee what thou giv'st our Cambridge  The duke of Somerset was chancellor of Cambridge N  Fame  Let youthful Grafton there his station find  Grown man in body now but more in mind  His looks are in the mother's beauty drest  And all the father has inform'd his breast  Why wilt thou then to distant shores convey  Our hopes in thee Why trust the faithless sea  Why view the changing climates of the earth  And bless all realms but that which gave thee birth  Thy country lovely youth thy stay demands  And fears to venture thee in foreign lands  All thou hast seen and all thou goest to see  Will not improve but be improv'd in thee  A manly beauty is in Dev'nshire seen  And true nobility in Dorset's mien  But here great artist is thy skill confin'd  Thou canst not paint his nobler Muse and mind  No pen the praise he merits can indite  Himself to represent himself must write  Next let young Burlington receive his place  Adorn'd with every beauty every grace  Happy in fortune person and in parts  Himself not wanting them promoting arts  With him let Kingston be for ever join'd  Alike in quality alike in mind  For court or camp for love or glory fit  Possessing both both patronizing wit  Hither let Montague the treasures bring  Which while he offers let his Muses sing  The patron of the rest so justly grown  Who serv'd so well a nation with his own  Who seated on the sacred mountain's brow  Inspires and cherishes the train below  Draw Russel yonder order'd to maintain  The power and honour of the British main  Wrap him in curling smoak and circling flames  Yet unconcern'd as on his sovereign's Thames  While his loud cannon thunders through the deep  Makes seas attention give and silence keep  Then as he coasts the Mauritanian shores  Paint pale the faces of th' astonish'd Moors  Whence England gives surrounding nations law  And from the centre keeps the world in awe  No more let Poets name inconstant seas  For Neptune knows his sovereign and obeys  Fled from that fatal field the watery plain  No foe dares venture there our force again  Fierce Gallia challenges to Belgian fields  But still her chosen plain small harvest yields  The warlike Cutts the welcome tidings brings  The true brave servant of the best of kings  Cutts whose known worth no herald need proclaim  His wounds and his own verse can speak his fame  The dreadful news moves William with delight  Gladly he hears and gladly hastes to fight  Leaving his faithful substitutes behind  He trusts himself to his own seas and wind  The royal fleet a thousand heroes grace  And Mars in triumph rides o'er Neptune's face  Now out of sight of land they plough the main  And in some rolling tides make land again  Now sight of hostile tents their valour warms  And each encourages his mate to arms  Fancy can scarce so swift and eager run  Their lines are drawn and the campwork is done  The word is given and battle is begun  They who have seen an ocean lash its shore  When billows tumble and begin to roar  When from all quarters clouds and tempests fly  And from despairing sailors hide the sky  Such as have seen those elements at war  May guess what welldisputed battles are  DESCRIPTION OF A BATTLE  Hark 'tis at hand drums beat and trumpets sound  The horsemen mount the mounted horses bound  The soldiers leap transported from the ground  When such harmonious sounds invite to arms  'Tis sure that valiant men feel secret charms  Such William's is when from his foaming horse  He views the foe rejoicing at their force  Never so full of spirit and delight  Never so pleas'd as when prepar'd to fight  Paint him then yonder spurring from afar  Giving the charge guiding the raging war  Paint to the field party on party sent  Himself not waiting for the vast event  Now mingled in the war engage the whole  And of his martial troops make him the soul  Now from all parts death and destruction fly  The cries of grappling squadrons rend the sky  Mars rages and the rolling war runs high  Here horses rear at horses chest to chest  There desperate men encounter breast to breast  Here trampled under foot fall'n soldiers groan  For help they call but with unpitied moan  For every one now minds himself alone  The cannons roar and flaming balls fly round  Men fall and die and hardly feel the wound  Stones from the ground that nourish'd them are tost  And all the fashion of the field is lost  Mortars shoot flaming meteors through the air  And such as have not seen them fly would fear  The stars dissolv'd and the last judgement near  Death through the broken battle makes a lane  And horror and confusion fill the plain  Horses in troops without their riders run  Wild as were those of old that drew the sun  Madly they drag their reins and champ their bit  And bear down all before them whom they meet  Sol's offspring and their master's fate the same  All lost like him in thunder smoak and flame  As seamen fear yet struggle with a storm  The soldiers start at what themselves perform  Paint then a fear in every face and make  Ev'n William fearbut fear for Ormond's sake  Ormond who spurr'd amidst the thundering war  But to his sovereign's sorrow spurr'd too far  Dismounted make him ev'n in falling great  Wounded half dying yet despising fate  Make William view him with excess of grief  And strive but strive in vain to send relief  Till heaven inspires his very foes to save  A life as strangely fortunate as brave  Who for that life may to more praise aspire  Than if the day had been their own intire  Proud of their prize more furious than before  Make them press on make English fury more  Make shatter'd squadrons rally on the plain  And make enrag'd battalions charge again  Again make horses beat the suffering ground  And toss with restless hoofs the dust around  Again their riders couch their ready lance  And spurring them to warmth and foam advance  Foam which your pencil need not owe to chance  Make sheets of flame from smoaking culverins fly  And clouds of mounting smoak obscure the sky  Now draw beneath the dying and the dead  And deluges of blood in battle shed  O'erflowing Flanders in her waters stead  And now let clouds like feeble curtains fall  Protecting those that live and hiding all  Cast the black veil of night about the slain  Covering the purple horror of the plain  And now with solid darkness shut the scene  As tempests make the skies serene and clear  As thunder serves to purify the air  On rain as sunshine storms on calms attend  Peace is War's necessary certain end  DESCRIPTION OF THE GODDESS OF PEACE AND HER PALACE  Pardon the Muse if here she cannot hold  The sight of her own goddess makes her bold  She comeso'er fields of standing corn she walks  Not crush'd the tender ears nor bent the stalks  Her march attended with a numerous train  Yet with such discipline that none complain  Grass springs wheree'er she goes the flowery mead  Receives new flowers where she vouchsafes to tread  Her blooming beauties teeming earth displays  The lover's myrtle and the poet's bays  From every touch of her a perfume flows  The lovely hyacinth the blushing rose  And spreading jessamine fresh sweets disclose  Thick palaces as she approaches rise  And royal piles amaze beholders' eyes  Built on a sudden they the sight confound  And seem to start as from enchanted ground  None this or that can her apartment call  For she promiscuously resides in all  At home in every one and all she keeps  Silent but splendider than that of Sleep's  Which the reader will find described in a future poem N    Her spacious halls with useless arms are hung  With arrows broken and with bows unstrung  No murmurs through her numerous train are heard  She knows no danger and her court no guard  Secure as shades as skies unclouded bright  As active yet as noiseless as the light  No widows here their husbands deaths deplore  None hears the drum or thundering cannon roar  Only Love sighs which serves to lull her more  Plenty her bestlov'd favourite duly waits  And Pleasure enters at her palace gates  Roses and myrtles mingled make her bed  And heaps of flowers support her sacred head  Inspir'd by her the Muse around her sings  And Cupids fan her with expanded wings  No grief or anxious cares her peace molest  She folds her arms above her quiet breast  Delightful are her dreams and soft her rest  All at her rise their adoration pay  The Persians worship less the springing day  Sweet is her temper easy is her mien  Not the least frown in all her aspect seen  But gracious as our late lamented queen  Nor are her blessings to her court confin'd  But flow through nobles to the labouring hind  All they can wish her own domesticks share  Bestowing still yet has she still to spare  The grateful soil the jocund peasants plow  And with a certainty of reaping sow  Not now as heretofore with fears perplext  Tilling these fields and armies in the next  Now Spring comes on  And night and day in equal measures run  And mounting la  ks salute the morning sun  Then ripening fruits the loaded trees adorn  And laughing fields are crown'd with lofty corn  The Summer so accustom'd to alarms  Wonders she hears no more the sounds of arms  No trumpets echo through the spacious plain  Nor earthborn brethren by themselves are slain  The sun shines freely through the flowery field  And suffers no reflection from the shield  Men to the date of nature draw their breath  For nothing now but sickness causes death  Secure the merchants trade abroad for gain  And sailors unmolested sweep the main  Unrolling waves steal softly to the shore  They know their sovereign and they fear to roar  The conscious winds within their caverns keep  Like them the seas are hush'd and seem asleep  And halcyon Peace broods o'er the boundless deep  How are these blessings thus dispens'd and given  To us from William and to him from Heaven  Delight in blood let other heroes boast  Our ease and safety please our monarch most  For that he fought for that was all his care  He places all his pomp and glory there  Hail Peace of all things in confusion hurl'd  Hail thou Restorer of the Christian world  Thou to the world art Heaven's chief blessing given  And thou hast render'd back the world to Heaven  Thus in old times at our bless'd Saviour's birth  An universal calm was known on earth  GOD to his SON did the first gift assign  And lets the second miracle be thine  This compliment it must be acknowledged is extended to the verge of indecency N    How shall we thank thee for thy royal toil  Thou strength and glory of the British isle  What trophies shall thy grateful subjects raise  And what ambitious poets sing thy praise  Thy greatness surely is the stars' design  Thy hands our noblest palaces refine  On all our metals all the stamp is thine  Draw his triumphant entry Dauly  This painter see p is twice called by Dryden  D  i  He died Oct  at the age of N  draw  Him and his allies free  And all the rest of the whole world in awe  But see all peaceable our hero comes  No sound of trumpet nor alarm of drums  Long kept from rest by no inglorious foes  He goes to take what he has brought repose  His softer triumphs then prepare to grace  Prepare a train fit to attend on Peace  Chuse them from all that breathe the British air  And like the Goddess whom they wait on fair  Make beauteous Grafton  To this accomplished lady Mr Hopkins inscribed his History of Love see p She has been already men  oned p as daughter of the earl of Arlington N  with the first advance  Charming at every step with every glance  as her temper paint her heavenly face  Draw her but like you give your piece a grace  Blend for her all the beauties e'er you knew  For so his Venus fam'd Apelles drew  But holdto make her most divinely fair  Consult herself you'll find all beauty there  Whom shall we think on now there's scarce beside  Any that can compare with her but Hyde  Hyde who like her has beauties without blame  Hyde who like her is every poet's theme  Hyde by all eyes admir'd all hearts ador'd  Courteous to all kind only to her lord  Hyde who so many powerful charms commands  As will not shame the piece where Grafton stands  And now to make thy lasting fame renown'd  Let all be with illustrious Ormond crown'd  S  m all in her that's fair and good and great  Place her in Beauty's and in Virtue's seat  Paint sweetness in her eyes at once and awe  And make her looks give languishing and law  O if my Muse to her wish'd height could climb  Sweet as her subject as her theme sublime  The noble Ormond should engross her praise  Great Ormond's name should sanctify her lays  Hers and her most illustrious consort's blood  Takes pleasure still like Heaven in doing good  Ormond to whom fair lots on earth are given  Ormond who has her seat secur'd in Heaven  Stop herethough others may attract the sight  Your pencil and my pen  Dare not attempt to do so many right  Who strives to sing a patron or a friend  Though he omit some whom he should commend  Cannot be thought in justice to offend  And now you've finish'd so renown'd a piece  Boast safelychallenge either Rome or Greece  TO CHARLES EARL OF DORSET  "Of the earl of Dorset the character has been drawn so largely and so elegantly by Prior English Poets vol XXX p to whom he was familiarly known that nothing can be added by a casual handHe was a man whose elegance and judgement were universally confessed and whose bounty to the learned and witty was generally known"  Dr JOHNSONTo this short but comprehensive eulogy it would be presumption to think of adding N    BY THE SAME  AS Nature does in newborn infants frame  With their first speech their careful fosterer's name  Whose needful hands their daily food provide  And by whose aid they have their wants supply'd  You are my lord the Poet's earliest theme  And the first word he speaks is Dorset's name  To you the praise of every Muse is due  For every Muse is kept alive by you  Their boasted stream from your rich ocean pours  And all the Helicon they drink is yours  What other subject can the Muses chuse  Or who besides is worthy of a Muse  They shall to future ages make you known  Their verse shall give you fame but more your own  Immortal Wit shall its great patron boast  When others of an equal rank are lost  While eating Time all other tombs devours  No Mausoleum shall endure but yours  Life to yourself by your own verse you give  And only you and whom you please shall live  Thus you must Nassau's godlike acts proclaim  And farther than his trumpets sound his Fame  Whose hundred mouths of nothing else shall tell  But him who fought and him who sung so well  Ev'n after death you shall your honours share  You for improving Wit and He for War  TO WALTER MOYLE  This ingenious writer was born in Cornwall After passing some years at Oxford he was removed to the Temple where he entered deeply into the nobler parts of the law  "for there was a drudgery says Mr Hammond in the lawlucrative which he could not submit to"  Here first he formed an intimacy with Dryden Hammond Hopkins and other contemporary wits He was for some time a member of parliament where he always acted a very honourable and disinterested part and afterwards retired to his seat at Bake in Cornwall where he applied himself very diligently to study and died June Two volumes of his post humous writings were published in and those he had printed in his lifetime were collected in by his friend Mr Hammond who wrote his Life N  ESQ  BY THE SAME  TO you dear youth in these unpolish'd strains  And rural notes your exil'd friend complains  With pain this tedious banishment I bear  From the dear town and you the dearest there  Hourly my thoughts present before my view  Those charming joys which once alas I knew  In wine in love in friendship and in you  Now Fortune has withdrawn that pleasing scene  We must not for a while appear again  Here in its stead unusual prospects rise  That dull the fancy and disgust the eyes  Bleak groves of trees shook by the northern winds  And heavy aspects of unthinking hinds  No beauteous nymph to fire the youthful heart  No swain instructed in the Muses' art  Hammond alone is from this censure free  Hammond who makes the same complaint with me  Alike on both the want of you does strike  Which both repine at and lament alike  While here I stay condemn'd to desart fields  Deny'd the pleasures which the city yields  My fortunes by the chance of war deprest  Lost at these years when I might use them best  To crown your youth conspiring Graces join  Honour and bounty wealth and wit are thine  With charms united every heart you move  Esteem in men in vanquish'd virgins love  Though clogg'd with cares I drag my restless hours  I envy not the flowing ease of yours  Still may they roll with circling pleasures on  Nor you neglect to seize them as they run  Time hastes away with an impetuous flight  And all its joys soon vanish from our sight  Which we shall mourn we us'd not while we might  In full delights let sprightly Southerne live  With all that women and that wine can give  May generous Wycherley all sufferings past  Enjoy a welldeserv'd estate at last  Fortune with Merit and with Wit be friends  And sure though slowly make a large amends  Late very late may the great Dryden die  But when deceas'd may Congreve rise as high  To him my service and my love commend  The greatest wit and yet the truest friend  Accept dear Moyle a letter writ in haste  Which my impatient friendship dictates fast  Friendship like Love imperfectly exprest  Yet by their being so they 're both shown best  Each no cold leisure for our thoughts affords  But at a heat strikes out our eager words  The soul's emotion most her truth assures  Such as I feel while I subscribe me YOURS  TO ANTHONY HAMMOND  To this gentleman Mr Hopkins inscribed his "Epistolary Poems and Translations" in a dedication worth preserving  "The following verses ought in justice to be yours since not only the best part of them were made at your house but they were made designedly for you so that this is not a de  ication written to a book but a book written to a dedication which however is the nicest part a writer has to manage for the most deserving men are the most averse to be told so and what would please all their friends and acquaintance would displease themselves which makes the poet at a loss whether to dissatisfy one or many his readers or his patron But since I have already found it easier to you to oblige than to receive thanks for an obligation to do no violence to your modesty I must do one to my own justice and desist from a theme which I could so willingly enlarge upon but you so unwillingly read I shall say little of the following essays either of the originals I translated them from or the translations one thing in general I find from my own experience that where there is most life and spirit in the author the translator is carried on with the greater vigour and vivacity as a man swims faster in a stream than a standing water but where the original is flat and low the translator must be at the pains to raise him so that the best things are the easiest to be done and the dullest the most difficult It were presumption in one of my years to pretend to give an account of the authors whom I have chosen or their works to commend their excellences or condemn their faults and of the two I dare venture to say the least of Ovid when he himself and all that he has written have been already so well and so fully treated of in Mr Dryden's preface before his epistles But I cannot choose but wonder that a book so extremely delightful so soft and sweet as Tibullus has lain so long unattempted but there is a friend of ours whom I hope he has been all along reserved for and then he will be in the best hands he could have fallen into Of the three elegies that I have ventured on the first from toward the middle to the end and the whole third pleased me infinitely the second I did merely for the sake of the last ten or twelve lines Tibullus most certainly have felt all he wrote for he could never have feigned so much passion so well and I am apt to believe it was not his poetry made him so fond and tender a lover but rather his love that made him so sweet and excellent a poet Were it not that I should take him out of better hands I would have attempted to have englished him all for I flatter myself with a fancy that in some things I am somewhat of his temper and how far short soever I come or him in his poetry I resemble him but too nearly in some other circumstances I was almost running into a complaint that would have been both unjust and ingrateful for since I knew you all occasion of complaint has been taken from me Your acquaintance would have been of itself sufficient to endear you to any man but your favours to me began with and even outran your acquaintance I dare not proceed though on a subject which I am very loth to leave permit me to add only this that since most who ever wrote have sometimes stood in need of favours from other men and since the same fortune has attended me I am glad however that it threw me on you to receive them than whom I know none I could have been more willingly obliged to for them I am Sir your most affectionate obliged humble servant CHARLES HOPKINS"  Of Mr Hammond as a poet I shall have occasion to speak hereafter of his son the incomparable author of the "Love Elegies" much may be hoped for from Dr Johnson N  ESQ  BY THE SAME  AS when a prophet feels the God retir'd  By whom he had a long time lain inspir'd  His eyes no more with sacred fury roll  No more divine impulses move his soul  The fires that warm'd him with the God are gone  The Deity withdrawn the charm is done  So now my Muse can no more rapture boast  Since you went hence her inspiration's lost  Robb'd of her flame all languishing she lies  And swan like only sings before she dies  But you my friend to different fortune move  And crown your days with wine your nights with love  In endless bliss unbounded time you waste  Your ravishing delights for ever last  Long long ere this you've often been possest  Of all your wish could frame to make you blest  When you and Southerne Moyle and Congreve meet  The best good men with the bestnatur'd wit  Good wine good company the better feast  And whene'er Wycherley is present best  Then then your joys are perfectly compleat  And sacred Wit is at the noblest height  Oh how I long to be allow'd to share  And gain a fame by mingling with you there  The country now can be no longer borne  And since you first are gone I must return  I come I come dear Hammond to pursue  Pleasures I cannot know depriv'd of you  Restless as lovers till we meet I live  And envy this because 'twill first arrive  With joy I learnt Dryden designs to crown  All the great things he has already done  No loss no change of vigour can he feel  Who dares attempt the sacred Mantuan still  See Gent Mag p N    Adieu  And yet methinks I owe too much to you  To part so coldly with a bare adieu  But what requital can I make you more  You've put all recompence beyond my power  Fain would my working thoughts contrive a way  For every generous man's in pain to pay  'Tis not a suitable return I give  Yet what it is my bestgood friend receive  Take the best wishes of a grateful soul  Congreve and Moyle and you possess it whole  Take all the thanks a country Muse can send  And in accepting this oblige your friend  TO C C  The above initials I have not been able to discover N  ESQ  BY THE SAME  IN vain my friend so often I remove  I find that absence full increases Love  The barbarous foe like an ingrateful guest  Too strongly lodg'd possesses all my breast  Gladly I suffer'd him to share my soul  But now the traitor has usurp'd it whole  I burn with pains too great to be endur'd  And yet I neither can nor would be cur'd  In other ills all remedies we try  But fond of this we grow content to die  For all were useless here to help my grief  And I should strive in vain to find relief  In vain I rush'd amidst the thundering war  Endeavour'd all in vain to meet it there  In all the heat of fight I thought on her  If conquering camps refus'd to give me ease  The town at my return affords me less  W  thout concern its wealth and pomp I see  And all its pleasures are but lost on me  It with my friends I should to plays resort  Without a smile I see the comic sport  I mingle no applauses with the pit  Nor mind the action nor the author's wit  I see the shining beauties sit around  But have no room left for another wound  I fly for refuge to the country now  But that is savage and denies it too  Retirement still foments the raging fire  And trees and fields and floods and verse conspire  To spread the flame and heighten the desire  Wildly I range the woods and trace the groves  To every oak I tell my hopeless loves  Torn by my passion to the earth I fall  I kneel to all the Gods I pray to all  Nothing but Echo answers to my prayer  And she speaks nothing but despair despair  I give relentless Heaven this last reply  I do despair and will resolve to die  TO MRS MOHUN ON HER RECOVERY  BY THE SAME  AS when the Queen of Love engag'd in war  Was rashly wounded with a Grecian spear  All parties were concern'd to see her bleed  And he himself did first repent the deed  He left th' inglorious field with grief and shame  Where his late conquest had destroy'd his fame  So Sickness flies from you with such a grief  Asham'd that ever she began the strife  Better than Venus in the fight you fare  For though more wounded you're without a scar  All claim to you th' invader has resign'd  And left no marks of hostile rage behind  No signs no tracks of tyranny remain  But exil'd Beauty is restor'd again  Fix'd in a realm which was before her own  More firm than ever she secures the throne  Mildly ah mildly then your power maintain  And take example from Maria's reign  Wide may your empire under hers be seen  The fair Vicegerent of the fairest Queen  Through you may all our prayers to her be heard  Our humble verse be all by you preferr'd  No blessing can the pious suppliant want  Where she the Goddess is and you the Saint  TO A LADY  BY THE SAME  MUST all my life in fruitless love be spent  And never never will your heart relent  Too well my charming dear your power you know  And that which makes you play the tyrant so  For ever be the fatal moment curst  When fondly I confess'd my passion first  Oh that my flames had never been reveal'd  Oh that I now could keep the fire conceal'd  Resistless Love your victory secures  And you already know my soul is yours  It shews itself through all the forc'd disguise  Breaks through my lips and trembles at my eyes  My blood boils high and rages to be blest  My fluctuating thoughts will never rest  And know no calm till harbour'd in your breast  Relent at last my cruel Fair relent  And listen kindly to my just complaint  Think on the passion that 's already past  Think that the passion will for ever last  O  ee with what impatient fires I burn  And let your pitying heart make some return  M  flames are so sincere my love is such  Some you should shewyou cannot shew too much  How blest should I in your possession be  How happy might you make yourself in me  No Mistress ever led so sweet a life  As you should in th' exploded thinga Wife  Years should roll round on years and ages move  les crown'd in everlasting love  Our mutual joys should like your charms be new  And all my business be to merit you  What shall I say Lines after lines rehearse  Nought but the fondness in the former verse  On the dear theme I could for ever dwell  For while I speak to you  My faultering tongue can never speak farewell  In your cold breast let Love an entrance find  And think oh quickly think of growing kind  My flames no more with dull indifference treat  Indifference is the Lover's hardest fate  But if my ruin is your fix'd intent  Urge it I beg you with a closer bent  All glimmerings of the faintest hope remove  Say that you do not will not cannot love  Extremely kind or in extremes severe  Make sure my bliss or mad me with despair  Forbid me banish me your charming sight  Shut from my view those eyes that shine so bright  Shut your dear image from my dreams by night  Drive them somewhere as far as Pole from Pole  Let winds between us rage and waters roll  In distant climes let me my fate deplore  In some lone island on a desart shore  Where I may see your fatal charms no more  TO THE SAME LADY  I Thought in silence to suppress my pain  And never shew my fond concern again  Whate'er you shew'dindifference or disdain  But Love's great God the vain resolve withstands  At once inspires my breast and guides my hands  My soul flows out in every line I write  And rolls in numbers in my own despight  Then let me in poetic fury break  For I can write the things I dare not speak  My tongue still faulters as I move my suit  And awful Love confounds and keeps me mute  Out of your sight I can my wrongs proclaim  And with un  etter'd words confess my flame  Why do you use me thus ingrateful fair  Oppress'd with doubts yet bury'd 'bove despair  Like wounded fowl upon the flood I lie  Floating on wings with which they us'd to fly  Who would find ease could they but drown and die  Such still has been your conquering Beauty's spight  Cruel to wound not kind to kill outright  Be merciful and save or sink me quite  Toss not 'twixt hope and fear my labouring heart  Let us for ever join or ever part  You know I love you and you love me too  Which you have kindly let me know you do  All this I know oh there will be the fall  From heaven to hell  Should I be doom'd to lose you after all  But be not by mistaken notions led  Nor think that riches bless the nuptial bed  This shall my only consolation be  No Fool of Fortune can your merit see  Not have the wit and sense to love like me  Oh would that you had been but meanly born  Naked of friends abandon'd and forlorn  eft to the worldthen should this wish ensue  Oh would I had a world to offer you  You know this is no false poetic flight  You know I feel more than the Muse can write  Too well my cruel dear you keep the field  Too long hold out 'tis now high time to yield  Consent at last to mutual  oys resign  And let the smallest share of bliss be mine  Unalterable love your part secures  My interest humour all my soul is yours  I beg you let me know my doom at last  Nought worse than death can come then all is past  But think and do not make a rash decree  O think you never were nor e'er can be  So truly lov'd as you have been by me  TO DOCTOR GIBBONS  This is I believe Dr W Gibbons who died March  He succeeded Ratcliffe in his attendance on queen Anne when she was disgusted by the behaviour of the latter He is characterized in the Dispensary under the name of  M  mil  o  See what Ratcliffe said of him Life of Ratcliffe p R    BY THE SAME  THE fires that fell in ages past from Heaven  Were to the charge of Priests and Augurs given  Life the most active most exalted fire  The great creating Godhead could inspire  Breath'd into man while yet the world was new  Is now committed to the care of you  How you discharge your trust maintain your post  Though you are silent I have cause to boast  Again the rising Muse expands her wings  Again prepares to mount and mounting sings  Again would celebrate some sacred name  And chuses you who rais'd her for her theme  There are two poems expressive of gratitude to this physician in the "Works of the Muses" by Mr  John  Hopkins N    Ye conscious Poets be no longer vain  Confess your weakness and your pride contain  Quit your bold claim and end your idle strife  It is not yours to give immortal life  Ev'n you to him on all occasions fly  Without whose aid you and your Muses die  His succour is implor'd where Wit declines  Where Lovers languish and where Beauty pines  Where Monarchs faint beneath the weight of crowns  And sicken in their robes on silver thrones  His sacred art their sacred lives sustains  And strengthens them again to guide the reins  As Iris enter'd with her golden beams  The cave of Sleep and chac'd away the dreams  In  ases seem to fly at his approach  And c  cling blood keeps measure at his touch  l  aps the Lover's heart so beats and moves  When he lies folded in her arms he loves  S  influenc'd by the moon wide oceans  oll    And so the needle trembles to the pole  O Gibbons I am rais'd there 's nought I see  A  ove my reach when thus reviv'd by thee  Now could I paint a welldisputed field  O  praise proud Beauties till I made them yield  But gratitude a different song requires  M  breast enlarges and dilates my fires  the first blessing humankind can boast  which can never be restor'd when lost  En  ear'd by health from pain and sickness free  Is the bl  st gift bestow'd by Heaven and thee  How shall I then or Heaven or you regard  The care of both has been beyond reward  But grateful Poets offering up their lays  Find you content with thanks and Heaven with praise  O may your stream of life run smooth but strong  Long may you livethat others may live long  Till healing plants no more on mountains grow  Till mineral waters have forgot to flow  And paint the vallies where they glide below  While silver Helicon delights the taste  And while the Muses sacred mount shall last  Their songs for thee the sisters shall design  The grateful subject of the tuneful Nine  Oft shalt thou fill their songsand always mine  TO MR CONGREVE  BY THE SAME  LET other poets other patrons chuse  Get their best price and prostitute their Muse  With flattering hopes and fruitless labour wait  And court the slippery friendship of the great  Some trifling present by my lord is made  And then the patron thinks the poet paid  On you my surer nobler hopes depend  For you are all I wish you are a friend  From you my Muse her inspiration drew  All she performs I consecrate to you  You taught me first my genius and my power  Taught me to know my own but gave me more  Others may sparingly their wealth impart  But he gives noblest who bestows an art  Nature and you alone can that confer  And I owe you what you yourself owe her  O Congreve could I write in verse like thine  Then in each page in every charming line  Should gratitude and sacred friendship shine  Your lines run all on easy even feet  Clear is your sense and your expression sweet  Rich is your fancy and your numbers go  Serene and smooth as crystal waters flow  Smooth as a peaceful sea which never rolls  And soft as kind consenting virgins' souls  Nor does your verse alone our passions move  Beyond the poet we the person love  In you and almost only you we find  Sublimity of wit and candour of the mind  Both have their charms and both give that delight  'Tis pity that you should or should not write  But your strong genius Fortune's power defies  And in despight of Poetry you rise  To you the favour of the world is shown  Enough for any merit but your own  Your fortune rises equal with your fame  The best of poets but above the name  O may you never miss deserv'd success  But raise your fortunes till I wish them less  Here should I not to tire your patience end  But who can part so soon with such a friend  You know my soul like yours without design  You know me yours and I too know you mine  I owe you all I am and needs must mourn  My want of power to make you some return  Since you gave all do not a part refuse  But take this slender offering of the Muse  Friendship from servile interest free secures  My love sincerely and entirely yours  TO MR YALDEN IN OXON  BY THE SAME FROM LONDONDERRY  AUGUST  MY labouring Muse grown tir'd of being hurl'd  And tost about in a tempestuous world  Prays for a calm implores some quiet seat  And seeks what yours has found a sweet retreat  Now your blest fields their summer livery wear  Their fruits your loaded trees in season bear  But Learning flourishes throughout the year  From your full spring o'er Britain's isle it streams  And spreads like Isis when she meets the Thames  Rear'd on her banks the Muses' laurel grows  Adorn'd by yours adorning others brows  Sweet are her streams sweet the surrounding air  But sweeter are the songs she echoes there  There the great Ormond's daily praise is sung  There Addison's harmonious harp is strung  And there Lucretius  Translated by Creech N  learnt the English tongue  Well might I here the large account pursue  But you have stopt mefor I write to you  Methinks I see the tuneful sisters ride  Mounted like seanymphs on the swelling tide  The silver swans are silent while they play  Augusta hears their notes and puts to sea  Dryden and Congreve meet them half the way  All wa  ted by their own sweet voices move  And all is harmony  And all that's harmony is joy and love  All are in all the tuneful numbers skill'd  And now Apollo boasts his concert fill'd  Here listen while our English Maro sings  Borne like the Mantuan swan on equal wings  Mark the great numbers mind the lofty song  The sense as clear and just the lines as strong  Hark yonder where the Mourning Bride complains  And melt with pity at the moving strains  Wait the conclusion then allay your grief  Vice meets with ruin Virtue with relief  Walk thither and the charming musick leads  To murmuring waters and enchanting meads  Mark by the riverside along the plain  The dancing shepherdess and piping swain  Then see him take the kiss that crowns his pain  Then hearken where the knowing poet sings  Mysterious nature and the seeds of things  How in the teeming earth hard metals grow  From what far distant fountains rivers flow  What moves the stars above and feas below  Now see the charming concert sail along  Each tunes his harp and each prepares his song  To the Museum see them all repair  And see them all receive their laurels there  A learn'd and reverend circle ready stands  To crown the candidates with willing hands  Aldrich  The celebrated dean of ChristChurch N  who can the first large portion

out from such a train  For that who would not shift the tragic scene  Though tir'd of restless rambling up and down  Or a more restless settlement in town  Chang'd in the rest let this my love commend

prove  When the triumphant lover feels  None of those pains which once he bore  Or when reflecting on his ills  He makes his present pleasure more  To mariners who long have lain  On a tempestuous

look how each aspiring pile is rear'd  " View both alike thou shalt the cause resign  " And own that Men built yours but Gods built mine"  CATO'S CHARACTER  FROM THE SECOND BOOK OF LUCAN  BY THE SAME  SUCH Cato was of such exalted kind  Austere his manners and unmov'd his mind  He kept a mien and follow'd Nature's laws  Fought and fell bravely in his country's cause  Nor thought himself born for himself alone  But made the welfare of the world his own  Through cold he cloath'd himself through hunger fed  His house but fenc'd the weather from his head  Not lust but love of offspring made him wed  No loose desires debauch'd his noble life  Rome was at once his mistress and his wife  Just in all points firm and resolv'd he stood  Despising death when for his country's good  So great his soul his actions so divine  Free from all selfdesire or selfdesign  THE HISTORY OF LOVE  IN A LETTER TO A LADY  BY THE SAME  " Est quoque carminibus meritas celebrare puellas  " Dos mea  OVID  " Utinam modo dicere possem  " Carmina digna dea certè est dea carmina digna"  Ibid  TO THE DUTCHESS OF GRAFTON  MADAM Beauty as it is both the theme and inspirer of Poetry so it ought to be the patroness too and a poem of Love should in justice be sacred to none but the Loveliest it would therefore be adoring a false Deity should I offer up this at any shrine but yours As it is the best I can do and written on the most pleasing subject I was resolved to lay it at the feet of the most beautiful and had I been myself at a loss where to fix the universal opinion of the world would have directed me and pointed out your Grace for the patroness while the poem shall last and a poem of Love ought to last longer than any other succeeding ages shall read that your Grace was the ornament of this age It is an innocent and harmless ambition in poets whose only design in all they do is the pleasing others and in doing that please themselves best and as Beauty is the chief object they bend their studies to delight all poets ought to aspire to please your Grace in particular That ambition is the best excuse I can make for my presumption in this dedication since I am unknown to  your Grace and perhaps even unheardof yet but what is my crime is at the same time my plea for pardon or rather it is my merit The Athenians when they dedicated an altar to the Unknown God shewed more devotion and directed their devotion to a truer deity than when they adored the many they knew That I might be sure of something acceptable in this offering and not fail to delight in a poem of Love where all ought to be delightful I have taken all the most moving tender things that Ovid and  ibullus said to their mistresses to say to mine nor will I allow it to be a theft since I doubt not as it was their love that inspir'd them with those thoughts mine would have infused the same into me and no man that thinks naturally of love can avoid running into the same thoughts with them I have borrowed the examples to every passion from those stories which I thought the most pleasing in Ovid where certainly the most pleasing were to be met with some few places in every story I have translated but for the most part I have only kept him in view I have gone on with him and left him where I thought it proper and by that means have avoided the absurdities of his Metamorphoses save only that of Pigmalion's statue but that was a Metamorphosis that pleased me It was a delightful surprize to see life breathed into an inanimate beauty as it would be a killing affliction to see it taken away from one already animated it would occasion as much joy and wonder to have a Dutchess of GRAFTON made by Art if Art could do it as it would cause consternation to have the Gods unmake one But those miracles of  Art are now ceased and none but the Heavenly Artist could have drawn you who has drawn you so that he has left the painter and the poet at a loss to copy you As to the success of this poem I hope I am secure since it is sacred in general to the Fair Sex and committed in particular to the protection of the Fairest If they are once pleased who will dare to find fault or disoblige them by disliking what they approve Under the shelter of your Grace's patronage I shall stand like Aeneas guarded by the Goddess of Love and no Diomedes shall be found as desperate as the first to wound me through you Thus as all dedicating poets who write more to raise their own reputation than their patrons I have taken the most effectual means to establish mine and doubt not to make a strong party since every Lover will defend what is sacred to the Lovely Your Grace's most devoted most humble servant  CHARLES HOPKINS  " Thy forest Windsor and thy green retreats  " At once the Monarch's and the Muse's seats  " Invite my lays"  POPE  The imitation is here extremely evident N  YE woods and wilds serene and blest retreats  At once the Lovers' and the Muses' seats  To you I fly to you ye sacred groves  To tell my wondrous tale of wondrous Loves  Thee Delia thee shall every shepherd sing  With thy dear name the neighbouring woods shall ring  No name but thine shall on their barks be found  With none but thine shall echoing hills resound  My verse thy matchless beauties shall proclaim  Till thine outrival Sacharissa's fame  My verse shall make thee live while woods shall grow  While stars shall shine and while the seas shall flow  While there remains alive a tender maid  O  amorous youth or lovesick swain to read  Others may artfully the passions move  In me alone 'tis natural to love  While the world sees me write in such a strain  As shews I only feel what others feign  Thou darling of my youth my life's delight  By day my vision and my dream by night  Thou who alone dost all my thoughts infuse  And art at once my Mistress and my Muse  Inspir'd from thee flows every sacred line  Thine is the poetry the poet thine  Thy service shall my only business be  And all my life employ'd in pleasing thee  Crown'd with my songs of thee each day shall move  And every listening sun hear nought but Love  With flowing numbers every page shall roll  Where as you read my verse receive my soul  Should sense and wit and art refuse to join  In all I write and fail my great design  Yet with such passion shall my lines be crown'd  And so much softness in my poem found  Such moving tenderness the world shall see  Love could have been describ'd by none but me  Let Dryden from his works with justice claim  Immortal praise I from my sacred flame  Draw all my glory challenge all my fame  Believe me Delia Lovers have their wars  And Cupid has his camp as well as Mars  That age which suits a soldier best will prove  The fittest for the sharp fatigues of Love  None but young men the toils of war can bear  None but young men can serve and please the fair  Youth with the foe maintains the vigorous fight  Youth gives the longing maid the full delight  On either hand like hardship it sustains  Great are the soldier's great the lover's pains  Th' event of war no General can foreknow  And that alas of Love is doubtful too  In various fields whatever chance shall fall  The soldier must resolve to bear it all  With the like constancy must lovers wait  Enduring bad and hoping better fate  Through doubts and fears desires and wishes tost  Undaunted they must strain to reach the coast  All will a while look hideous to their eye  The threatening storm still thickening in the sky  No sight of land no friendly harbour nigh  Yet through all this the venturous lover steers  To reap the golden crop that Beauty bears  So the bold mariners the seas explore  Though winds blow hard and waves like thunder roar  Rather than live in poverty on shore  Embolden'd thus let every youth set sail  And trust to Fortune for a prosperous gale  Let them launch boldly from the lazy shore  Nor fear a storm which will at last blow o'er  Set all the reins to all their passions free  Give wings to their desires and love like me  Happy that youth who when his stars incline  His soul to Love can make a choice like mine  ADMIRATION  Thee Delia all that see thee must admire  And mankind in its own despight desire  As a blind man restor'd to sudden sight  Starts in amaze at the first flash of light  So was I struck such sudden wonder knew  When my eyes dazzled with the sight of you  I  aw whatever could inflame desire  up the veins and set the blood on fire  From every charm the pointed lightning came  And fast as they dispers'd I caught the flame  Like stars your glittering eyes were seen to shine  And  oll with motions that were all divine  Where majesty and softness mingled meet  And shew a soul at once sublime and sweet  I gaz'd and as I gaz'd from every view  N  w wonders I descried new passion drew  were the charms less powerful of your tongue  My ravish'd soul on every accent hung  Glow'd when you spoke and melted when you sung  Those lips unopen'd cannot fail to move  But silently are eloquent in Love  That face and neck those shoulders hands and arms  Each limb each feature has peculiar charms  ach of itself might singly win a soul  And never need th' assistance of the whole  On this one part a poet's praise might dwell  Did not this other part deserve as well  Beauty is surely near allied to Wit  Of which none can the just description hit  By their own selves they may be shewn the best  And only are in being seen exprest  Beauty's true charms no poem can present  Which but imperfectly are done in paint  That too comes short of life and only takes  Faint images of those which Nature makes  An imitation of part of the Fourth Book of Ovid's Me+tamorphoses Book IV N  Propitious chance led Perseus once to view  The fairest piece that ever Nature drew  Chain'd on a rocky shore the virgin stood  Naked and whiter than the foaming flood  Whom as he cours'd the confines of the sky  Amaz'd he saw and kept his wondering eye  So fix'd he had almost forgot to fly  Had not the winds dispers'd her flowing hair  And held it waving in the liquid air  Or had not streams of tears apace roll'd down  Her lovely cheeks he would have thought her stone  Straight he precipitates his hasty flight  Impatient to attain a nearer sight  Now all at once he feels the raging fires  Sees all the maid and all he sees admires  With awe and wonder mixt with love and fear  He stands as motionless as shame made her  Urg'don at last but still by slow degrees  Loth to offend he draws to what he sees  " Oh why he cries most matchless fairone why  Are you thus us'd Can you be doom'd to die  Have you done any guilt that guilt relate  How can such beauty merit such a fate  I am thy champion and espouse thy cause  In thy defence the Thunderer's offspring draws  Say if thou 'rt rescued by the son of Jove  Say for thy life wilt thou return thy love"  The bashful virgin no return affords  But sends ten thousand sighs instead of words  With grief redoubled with her shame she mourns  She weeps he joys she blushes and he burns  In chains extended at her length she lay  While he with transport took a full survey  Fain would her hands her conscious blushes hide  But  that  the fetters which they wore deny'd  What could she do all that she could she did  For drown'd in floods of tears her eyes she hid  Much urg'd to speak she turn'd her bashful look  Far as she could aside and trembling spoke  " My mother conscious of her beauty strove  Alas too conscious with the wife of Jove  Who by a cruel and unjust decree  To punish her takes this revenge on me  Here am I doom'd a dreadful monster's prey  Who now now now is issuing from the sea  Haste generous youth our common foe subdue  And if you save my life I live for you"  Thus spoke the maid half dying with her fears  When lo the monster from the sea appears  The dauntless hero mounts his flying horse  And o'er the waves directs his airy course  Let him alone his victory pursue  For dreadful war has nothing here to do  This short account will lovesick swains suffice  He slew his foe and straight receiv'd his prize  Thrice happy youth too fortunately blest  Who only came and conquer'd and possess'd  None of the pangs of Love your bliss annoy'd  You but beheld admir'd and so enjoy'd  All other lovers longer toils sustain  Desires Hopes Jealousies an endless train  DESIRE  From Ovid's Metamorphoses Book X N  How thou art envy'd let Pigmalion prove  Who by a miracle obtain'd his love  Who living in an age when women led  The lewdest lives all shame and honour fled  For a long time declin'd the nuptialbed  He saw them all debauch'd with monstrous crimes  No virtuous maid no Delia bless'd the times  Had she liv'd then his skill had ne'er been shewn  Nor the strange miracle that crown'd it known  There had he fix'd not form'd his fancy'd maid  Nor fondly been by his own art betray'd  The nymph in polish'd ivory glitter'd bright  So smooth she seem'd too slippery for his sight  So curious was her shape so just her frame  So quick her eyes appear'd so full of flame  They would have roll'd if not restrain'd by shame  From his strange art the statue had receiv'd  Such lively strokes one would have thought it liv'd  Ev'n he himself could hardly hardly know  But doubted long whether it liv'd or no  Yet from her as she was he gather'd fires  And fierce and boundless were his mad desires  He felt her flesh his fancy thought it such  And fear'd to hurt her with too rude a touch  He kiss'd her with belief so strong and vain  That he imagin'd how she kiss'd again  Now makes his court his mad addresses moves  And tells a long fond tale how well he loves  Presents her now with all he thought might please  With procious gums distill'd from weeping trees  Small singingbirds who strain their tuneful throats  And hovering round repeat their pretty notes  With sweetest flowers he crowns her lovely head  And lays her on the softest downy bed  In richest robes his charming idol drest  Bright sparkling gems adorn her neck and breast  And shelook'd well in all but look'd when naked best  Now Venus kept her feast a goodly train  Of lovesick youths frequent and fill her fane  The snowwhite heifers fall by sacred strokes  While with rich gums the loaden'd altar smokes  Among the rest the hopeless lover stands  Tears in his eyes and offerings in his hands  More furious than before he feels his fires  Ev'n his despair redoubles his desires  A long long time his orisons deferr'd  He durst not pray lest he should not be heard  Till urg'd by Love his timorous silence broke  Thus but still timorously at last he spoke  " If you ye sacred powers that rule above  And you great Goddess of propitious Love  If all we want is plac'd within your power  And you can give whatever we implore  Exert your Godhead now now lend your aid  Give me the wife I wish one like"he said  But durst not say "give me my ivory maid"  This finish'd thrice auspicious flashes rise  And wreaths of curling smoak ascended thrice  Half hoping now and yet still half afraid  With doubtful joy he seeks his ivory maid  Doats more than ever on her fancy'd charms  And closely clasps her in his longing arms  When all at once with joy and wonder fill'd  He feels her stubborn sides begin to yield  Soft was her bosom grown her throbbing breast  Heav'd with her breath swell'd gently to be prest  Surpriz'd and glad he feels her oft and oft  And more and more perceives her warm and soft  Warm were her lips and every pointed kiss  With melting touches met and moisten'd his  Her blood now circled and her pulses beat  And life at last enjoy'd a settled seat  Slowly she lifts her new and fearful sight  And sees at once her lover and the light  An unborn maid both life and lover found  And he too had his desperate wishes crown'd  Desperate indeed what prospect could he see  Or how at first hope any more than me  HOPE  From Ovid's Metamorphoses Book X N  Hippomanes alone with Hope inspir'd  Might well rejoice to find his wishes fir'd  Since well assur'd of all his wish desir'd  His passion was all life all soul and flame  He dauntless to the fatal barriers came  With joy his vanquish'd rivals he beheld  Assur'd to win where all besides had fail'd  He saw the lovely nymph outfly the wind  And leave her breathless suitors far behind  Saw Atalanta swift as lightning pass  Yet soft as Zephyrs sweep along the grass  He knew the law whose cruelty decreed  That every youth who lost the race should bleed  Yet if like them he could not run so fast  He saw her worth the dying for at last  Her every charm his praise and wonder mov'd  And still the more he prais'd the more he lov'd  Now had he view'd the last unhappy strife  And seen the vanquish'd youth resign his life  When with his love transported from his place  Lest any other first should claim the race  Rising he runs regardless of their fate  And presses where the panting virgin sate  With eyes all sparkling with his hope and love  And such a look as could not fail to move  " Tell me he cries why barbarous Beauty why  Are you so pleas'd to see these wretches die  Why have you with my feeble rivals strove  Betray'd to death by their too daring love  With me a less unequal race begin  With me exert your utmost speed to win  By my defeat you will your conquests crown  And in my fall establish your renown  Then undisturb'd you may your conquests boast  For none will dare to strive when I have lost"  Thus while the prince his bold defiance spoke  She eyes him with a soft relenting look  Already does his distant fate deplore  Concern'd for him though ne'er concern'd before  Doubtful she stands and knows not what to choose  And cannot wish to win nor yet to lose  But murmurs to herself "Ye powers divine  How hard alas a destiny is mine  Why must I longer such a law obey  And daily throw so many lives away  Why must I by their deaths my nuptials shun  Or else by marrying be myse  f undone  Why must I still my cruelty pursue  Why must a prince so charming perish too  Such is his youth his beauty valour such  Ev'n to myself I seem not worth so much  Fly lovely stranger ere 'tis yet too late  Fly from thy too ah too too certain fate  I would not send thee hence I would not give  Such a command could'st thou but stay and live  Thou with some fairer maid wilt happier be  The fairest maid might be in love with thee  So many suitors have already bled  Who rashly vent'red for my nuptial bed  I fear lest thou should'st run like them in vain  Should'st lose like them and ah like them be slain  Yet why should he alone my pity move  It is but pity sure it is not love  I wish bold youth thou would'st the race decline  Or rather wish thy speed could equal mine  Would thou hadst never seen this fatal place  Nor I alas thy too too charming face  Were I by rigorous fate allow'd to wed  Thou should'st alone enjoy and bless my bed  Were it but left to my own partial choice  Thou of all mankind should'st obtain my voice"  'Twas here she paus'd when urg'd with long delay  The trumpets sound to hasten them away  Strait at the summons is the race begun  And side by side for some short time they run  While the spectators from the barriers cry  "Fly prosperous youth with all thy vigour fly  Make haste make haste thy utmost speed enforce  Love give thee wings to win the noble course  See how unwillingly the virgin flies  Pursue and save thy life and seize the prize"  'Tis doubtful yet whether the general voice  Made the glad youth or virgin most rejoice  Oft in the swiftest fury of the race  The nymph would slacken her impetuous pace  And halt and gaze and almost fasten on his face  Then fleet away again as swift as wind  Not without sighs to leave him so behind  By this he saw his strength would ne'er prevail  But still he had a charm that could not fail  From his loose robe a golden apple drawn  With force he hurl'd along the flowery lawn  Strait at the sight the virgin could not hold  But starts aside to catch the rolling gold  He takes the wish'd occasion passes by  While all the field resounded shouts of joy  This she recovers with redoubled haste  Till he far off the second apple cast  Again the nymph diverts her near pursuit  And running ba  k secures the tempting fruit  But her strange speed recovers her again  Again the foremost in the flowery plain  Now near the goal he summons all his might  And prays to Venus to direct him right  With his last apple to retard her flight  Though sure to lose if she the race declin'd  For such a bribe the victory she resign'd  Pleas'd that she lost to the glad victor's arms  She gives the prize and yields her dearbought charms  He by resistless gold the conquest gain'd  In vain he ran till that the race obtain'd  Possess'd of that he could not but subdue  For gold alas would conquer Delia too  Yet oh thou bestbelov'd thou loveliest maid  Be not by too much avarice betray'd  Prize thyself high no easy purchase prove  Nor let a fool with fortune buy thy love  Like Atalanta's conqueror let him be  Brave generous young from every failing free  And to compleat him let him love like me  What pains against my wretched self I take  Ev'n I myself my jealousies awake  Such men there are blest with such gifts divine  Who if they knew thee would be surely thine  JEALOUSY  How wretched then alas should Daphnis grow  Gods how the very thought distracts him now  Ev'n now perhaps some youth with happier charms  Lies folded in the faithless Delia's arms  Ev'n now the favours you denied me seem  To be too prodigally heap'd on him  Close by your side all languishing he stands  And on your panting bosom warms his hands  Straight in your lap he lays his envied head  And makes the shrine of Love his sacred bed  Then glows his ravish'd soul with pointed flames  And thoughts of heavenly joys fill all his dreams  Let not your passion be to me reveal'd  But if you love keep him you love conceal'd  From Cephalus's tragic story read  What fatal mischiefs jealousy may breed  Hear that unhappy wretched huntsman tell  How by his hands his muchlov'd Procris fell  Hear him lamenting his mischance complain  In the soft Ovid's sadly charming strain  From Ovid's Metamorphoses Book X N  Happy a while thrice happy was my life  Blest in a beautiful and virtuous wife  Love join'd us first and Love made life so sweet  We prais'd the gods that 't was our lot to meet  Our breasts glow'd gently with a mutual flame  The same were our desires our fears the same  Whate'er one did the other would approve  For one our liking was as one our love  Then happy days were crown'd with happier nights  And some few months roll'd on in full delights  Joys crouded to appear and pleasures ran  A while in circles ere our woes began  Till I one fatal morn the chace pursu'd  Of a wild boar through an adjacent wood  Where as I hunted eager on my prey  Aurora stopp'd me in my hasty way  You may believe I do not dare not feign  For misery never made a man so vain  She though a goddess straight began to move  A fruitless suit and vainly talk'd of Love  Though she look'd bright as when she shines on high  In all the glories of a morning sky  Though earlier than the sun's her beams display  And shew the first approaches of the day  I told her "Procris all my soul possest  That she alone reign'd sovereign of my breast  Which never would admit another guest"  " Enjoy thy Procris then the goddess cry'd  Whom thou shalt one day wish th' hadst ne'er enjoy'd"  Stung with her words with doubts and fears oppress'd  A sudden jealousy destroys my rest  Mads all my brain and poisons all my breast  I thought the sex all false ev'n Procris too  Again I thought she could not but be true  Her youth and beauty kindled anxious cares  But her known chastity condemn'd my fears  But then my absence does again revive  And keep the torturing fancy still alive  I thought her faith too firmly fix'd to fall  Yet a true lover is afraid of all  I knew not what to think but straight I go  Resolv'd to cure or to compleat my woe  An habit different from my own I took  While with curst aid Aurora chang'd my look  To Athens straight unknown by all I came  Ev'n to myself I scarce could seem the same  Hardly I got admission to my house  But far far harder to my weeping spouse  The house itself from aught of blame was free  And every place express'd its grief for me  A dismal silence reign'd through every room  To mourn my loss already safe at home  Ev'n that sad pomp of woe some charms could boast  But when my Procris c  me she charm'd me most  Black were her robes her solemn pace was slow  Her dress was careless yet becoming too  A virtuous grief dwelt deeply in her face  But matchless beauty gave that grief a grace  Whole showers of tears her streaming eyes let fall  Yet something wondrous lovely shone through all  Scarce could I at the charming sight forbear  From running to embrace my mournful fair  Scarce hold from telling whom she saw though alter'd there  But yet at length my first design pursued  With words I flatter'd and with gifts I woo'd  All the most moving arguments I us'd  Oft pray'd and press'd but was as oft refus'd  She said another had before engross'd  All her affection and my suit was lost  Would any but a madman farther try  But ah that mad that desperate fool was I  I grew the more industrious to destroy  Her matchless truth and ruin all my joy  Redoubled presents and redoubled vows  I made and offer'd to betray my spouse  At last her staggering faith began to yield  And I 'ad just won the long disputed field  " Thy falsehood straight I cried too late I see  False to thy Cephalus for I am he  Since you are perjur'd since my Procris grew  Forsworn and false what woman can be true"  She at these words almost of sense bereav'd  With sad confusion found herself deceiv'd  Fix'd on the ground she kept her downcast eye  And silent with her shame made no reply  But to the mountains like an huntress hies  And for my sake from all mankind she slies  Which when I found abandon'd and alone  My dearer half through my own folly gone  Love fiercer than before began to burn  Till I was raging for my wife's return  My prayers dispatch'd with eagerness and haste  That she would pardon all offences past  Found her as kind as she was truly chaste  She came and crown'd my joys a second time  Forgot my jealousy forgave my crime  'Twas then I thought my greatest miseries o'er  But Fate it seems had worse far worse in store  Soon as each early sun began to rise  To glad th' enlighten'd earth and gild the skies  I with his first appearance rise and trace  The woods and hills that yielded game to chace  Alone I hunt a long and tedious way  And seldom fail to kill sufficient prey  Then spent with toil to cooler shades retreat  And seek a refuge from the scorching heat  Where pleasant valleys breathe a freer air  For my refreshment I address this prayer  See this burlesqued English Poets vol XX p N  " Come Air I cry joy of o'erlabour'd swains  Come and diffuse thyself through all my veins  Breathe on my burning lips and feverish breast  And reign at large an evergrateful guest  Glide to my soul and every vital part  Distill thyself upon my panting heart  By chance I other blandishments bestow  Or Destiny decreed it should be so  As O thou greatest Pleasure of the plains  Thou who assuagest all my raging pains  Thou who dost Nature's richest sweets excite  And mak'st me in these desart woods delight  Breathless and dead without thee should I be  For all the life I have I draw from thee"  While this I sung some one who chanc'd to hear  Thought her a nymph to whom I made my prayer  And told my Procris of her rival Air  She kind good soul half dying at the news  Would now condemn me now again excuse  Now hopes 'tis all a falsehood now she fears  Suspects my faith as I suspected hers  Resolv'd at last to trust no busy tongue  But be herself the witness of her wrong  When the next day with fatal haste came on  And I was to my lov'd diversion gone  She rose and sought the solitary shade  Where after hunting I was daily laid  Close in a thicket undiscern'd she stood  When I took shelter in the shady wood  Then stretching on the grass my fainting weight  " Come muchlov'd Air I cry oh come abate  With thy sweet breath this most immoderate heat"  At this a sudden noise invades my ear  And rustling boughs shewed something living there  I rashly thinking it some savage beast  Threw my unerring dart with heedless haste  Which pierc'd oh Gods my Procris through the breast  She at the wound with fearful shriekings fell  And I alas knew the dear voice too well  Thither distracted with my grief I flew  To give my dying Love a sad adieu  All bloody was her lately snowy breast  Her soul was hastening to eternal rest  With rage I tore my robe which close I bound  To stop the blood about the gaping wound  What pardons did I beg what curses frame  For my damn'd fate that was alone in blame  When weakly raising up her dying head  With a faint voice these few sad words she said  " Draw nearer yet dear author of my death  Hear my last  signs and snatch my parting breath  But ere I die by all that 's sacred swear  That you will never let my rival Air  Prophane my bed or find reception there  This I conjure you by your nuptial vow  The faith you gave me then renew me now  By all your love if any love remain  And by that love which dying I retain  Assure me but of this before I go  And I shall bless thee for the fatal blow"  To her sad speech abruptly I replied  In haste to shew her error ere she died  Quickly I ran the tragic story o'er  Which made her pleas'd amidst the pangs she bore  That done she rolls in death her dizzy eyes  And with a sigh which I receiv'd she dies  Here did the youth his doleful tale conclude  A tale too doleful to be long pursued  But this illchosen instance will not do  Unless my Delia could be jealous too  But she whene'er I wooe some other fair  Shews no resentment and betrays no care  She sees me court another as unmov'd  As she has always seen herself belov'd  That dreadful thought redoubles all my fear  That drowns my hopes and drives me to despair  DESPAIR  No foreign instance need of this be shown  To draw it best I must describe my own  Though of this kind all ages can produce  Examples proper for the mourning Muse  Yet all to me must the first place resign  None ever was so just so deep as mine  All day and night I sing and all day long  " I love and I despair" makes all my song  Revolving days the same sad music hear  Unchang'd those notes "I love and I despair"  To me as to the echo Fate affords  No power of speech but for those doleful words  Some glimpse of sun some chearful beams appear  Ev'n through the gloomiest season of the year  My clouded life admits no dawn of light  No ray can pierce through my eternal night  All there is dismal as the shades beneath  And all is dark as hell and sad as death  My anxious hours roll heavily away  Depriv'd of sleep by night and peace by day  My soul no respite from her sufferings knows  And sees no end of her eternal woes  I  a long line they run for ever on  And  ll increase and lengthen as they run  By fl  ght to lose my ills in vain I try  From my despairing self I cannot fly  Wheree'er I go I bear about my flame  In cities countries seas 'tis still the same  Scorch'd with my burning pains I shun my house  And strive in open air to seek repose  My  lames like torches shook in open air  Grow with dilated heat more furious there  Now to the most retir'd remotest place  Ev'n to obscurity I fly for ease  Retirement still foments the raging fire  And trees and fields and floods and verse conspire  To spread the flame and heighten the desire  Wildly I range the woods and trace the groves  To every oak I tell my hopeless loves  Torn by my passion to the earth I fall  I kneel to all the Gods I pray to all  Nothing but Echo answers to my prayer  And she speaks nothing but Despair Despair  From woods and wilds I no relief receive  But wander on to try what seas can give  Deep through the tide not knowing where I walk  To the deaf winds not knowing what I talk  Mad as the foaming main aloud I rave  While every tear keeps time with every wave  From Ovid's Metamorphoses Book X N  So in old times the mournful Orpheus stood  Drowning his sorrows in the Stygian flood  Whose lamentable story seems to be  The nearest instance of a wretch like me  Already had he pass'd the courts of Death  And charm'd with sacred verse the powers beneath  While Hell with silent admiration hung  On the soft music of his harp and tongue  And the black roofs restor'd the wondrous song  No longer Tantalus essay'd to sip  The springs that fled from his deluded lip  Their urn the fifty maids no longer fill  Ixion lean'd and list'ned on his wheel  And Sysiphus's stone for once stood still  The ravenous vulture had forsook his meal  And Titius felt his growing liver heal  Relenting Fiends to torture souls forbore  And Furies wept who never wept before  All Hell in harmony was heard to move  With equal sweetness as the spheres above  Nor longer was his charming prayer deny'd  All Hell consented to release his bride  Yet could the youth but short possession boast  For what his poem gain'd his passion lost  Ere they restor'd her back to him and life  They made him on these terms receive his wife  If till he quite had pass'd the shades of night  And reach'd the confines of aethereal light  He turn'd to view his prize his wretched prize  Again was doom'd to vanish from his eyes  Long had he wander'd on and long forborn  To look but was at last compell'd to turn  And now arriv'd where the sun's piercing ray  Struck through the gloom and made a doubtful day  Backwards his eyes th' impatient lover cast  For one dear look and that one look his last  Straight from his sight flies his unhappy wife  Who now liv'd twice and twice was robb'd of life  In vain to catch the fleeting shade he sought  She too in vain bent backwards to be caught  Gods what tumultuous raging passions toss'd  His anxious heart when he perceiv'd her lost  How wildly did his dreadful eyeballs roll  How did all Hell at once oppress his soul  To what sad height was his distraction grown  How deep his just despair how near my own  In vain with her he labour'd to return  All he could do was to sit down and mourn  In vain but ne'er before in vain he sings  At once the saddest and the sweetest things  " Stay dear Eurydice he cries ah stay  Why fleets the lovely shade so fast away  Why am not I permitted to pursue  Why will not rigorous Hell receive me too  Already has she reach'd the farther shore  And I alas allow'd to pass no more  Imprison'd closer in the dismal coast  She's now for ever ever ever lost  No charms a second time can set her free  Hell has her now again would Hell had me  From all his pains let Titius be releas'd  And in his stead unhappier Orpheus plac'd  He feels no torture I'll refuse to bear  Her loss is worse than all he suffers there  Is this your bounty then ye Powers below  And these the shortliv'd blessings you bestow  Why did you such a cruel covenant make  Which you but too well knew I needs must break  Ah by this artifice too late I find  Your envious nature never was inclin'd  To be intirely good or throughly kind  Had you persisted to refuse the grant  I should not then have known the double want  This was contriv'd by some malicious power  To swell my woes and make my miseries more  Plung'd in despair far deeper than at first  And blest a short short while to be for ever curs'd  Ah yet again relent again restore  My wretched bride be bounteous as before  Ah let the force of verse as powerful be  O'er you as was the force of love o'er me  And the dear forfeit once again resign  Which but for too much love had still been mine  By that immense and awful sway you bear  That silent horror that inhabits here  By these vast realms and that unquestion'd right  By which you rule this everlasting night  By these my tears and prayers which once could move  Once more I beg you to release my Love  Let her a little while with me remain  A little while and she is yours again  The date of mortal life is finish'd soon  Swift is the race and short the time to run  Inevitable Fate your right secures  And she and I and all at last are yours"  So sung the charming youth in such a strain  But sung and charm'd the second time in vain  No longer could he move the Powers below  Lost were his numbers then as mine are now  Torn with despair he leaves the Stygian lakes  And back to light a loathsome journey takes  No light could chear him in his cruel woes  Who bears about his grief wheree'er he goes  In sacred verse his sad complaints he vents  And all the day and all the night laments  Incessantly he sings whose moving song  Draws trees and stones and listening herds along  The Sylvan Gods and Woodnymphs stood around  And melting maids were ravish'd at the sound  All heard the wondrous notes and all that heard  With utmost art address'd the mournful bard  Not all their charms his constancy could move  Who fled the thoughts of any second love  When mad to see him slight their raging fire  To mortal hate converting fierce desire  With their own hands they made the youth expire  Such proofs my Delia would I gladly give  For thee I'd die without thee will not live  I've felt already the severest smart  Death can inflict for it was death to part  THE PARTING  What souls about to leave their bodies bear  Forc'd to forsake their longlov'd mansions there  The dying anguish the convulsive pain  And all the racking tortures they sustain  And most of all the doubt the dreadful fear  When thrust out thence to go they know not where  My soul such pangs such sad distractions knew  Forc'd by despairing love to part with you  Fix'd on that face where I could ever dwell  Charm'd into silence by some magic spell  I sigh'd and shook and could not say farewell  Down my sad cheeks did tears in torrents roll  And death's cold damp sate heavy on my soul  My trembling eyes swam in a native flood  As fast as they wept tears my heart wept blood  All signs of desperate grief possess'd my face  My sinking feet seem'd rooted to their place  And scarce could bear me to the last embrace  Gods where was then my soul that parting kiss  Was both the last and dearest taste of bliss  Ah since that fatal time I could not boast  Of love or life or soul all all is lost  When the last moment that I had to stay  Call'd me like one condemn'd to death away  With staggering steps I did my path pursue  Yet oft I turn'd to take another view  Oft gaz'd and sigh'd and murmur'd but adieu  Thus young Achilles in Bithynia's court  Had made a private and a long resort  Dress'd like a maid the better to improve  With his fair princess undiscover'd love  Where hours and days he might secure receive  The mighty bliss that mutual love could give  Where in full joys the youthful pair remain'd  And nought a while but laughing Pleasures reign'd  Till at the last the Gods were envious grown  To see the bliss of man surpass their own  All Greece was now with Helen's rape alarm'd  And all its princes to revenge her arm'd  When spiteful powers foretold them their descent  Would be in vain unless Achilles went  In vain they might the Phrygian coasts invade  Scale Troy in vain no onset could be made  That should succeed without that hero's aid  And now Ulysses by a crafty flight  Had found him out in his disguise's spite  Who though betray'd by his unhappy fate  Had too much sense of honour to retreat  Which when his charming Deidamia knew  She to her latediscover'd  Achilles had a long time lain disguised like a woman in the court of Nicomedes king of B  thynia making use of that habit the better to carry on his amours with Deidamia Nicomedes's daughter but he was at last discovered by the subtilty of Ulysses who putting a sword into his hands which he wielded too dextrously for a woman so betrayed him and carried him to the Trojan war the Greeks having been warned by the Oracle that Troy should never be taken unless Achilles assisted at the siege HOPKINS  lover flew  On his dear neck her snowy arms she hung  And streaming tears awhile restrain'd her tongue  But at the last her dismal silence broke  These mournful words the weeping princess spoke  " Whither ah whither would Achilles flee  From all he's dearest to from love and me  Are not my charms the same the same their power  Have I lost mine or has Bellona more  Oh let me not so poorly be forsook  But view me view me with your usual look  Would you unkind from these embraces break  Is glory grown so strong or I so weak  Glory is not your only call I fear  You go to meet some other mistress there  Go then ingrateful though from me you fly  You'll never meet with one so fond as I  But some campmistress lavish of her charms  Devoted to a thousand rival arms  Then will you think when she is common grown  On Deidamia who was all your own  Thus will I clasp thee to my panting breast  And thus detain thee to my bosom press'd  And while I fold thee thus and thus dispense  These kisses to restore thy wandering sense  What dismal sound of war shall snatch thee hence  What though the Gods have order'd you should go  Or Greece return inglorious from her foe  Have not the selfsame cruel Gods decreed  That if you went you should as surely bleed  Then since your fate is destin'd to be such  Ah think can any Troy be worth so much  Let Greece whate'er she please for vengeance give  Secure at home shall my Achilles live  Troy built by heavenly hands may stand or fall  You never shall obey the fatal call  Your Deidamia swears you shall not go  Life would be dear to you if she were so  If not your own at least my safety prize  For with Achilles Deidamia dies"  All this and more the lovely mournful maid  Told the sad youth who sigh'd at all she said  Yet would he not his resolution break  Where all his fame and honour lay at stake  Now would he think on arms but when he gave  A sidelong glance on her he was to leave  Then his tumultuous thoughts began to jar  And Love and Glory held a doubtful war  Till with a deepdrawn sigh and mighty course  Of tears which nothing else but love could force  To the dear maid he turns his watery eyes  And to her sad discourse as sad replies  " Thou late best blessing of my joyful heart  Now grown my grief since I must now depart  Behold the pangs I bear look up and see  How much I grieve to go and comfort me  Curse on that cunning traitor's smooth deceit  Whose craft has made me to my ruin great  Curse on that artifice by which I fell  Curse on these hands for wielding swords so well  Though I should ne'er so fit for battle prove  All my ambition 's to be fit for love  In his soft wars I would my life beguile  With thee contend in the transporting toil  Ravish'd to read my triumph in thy smile  Boldly I'd strive yet ev'n when conquering yield  To thee the glory of the bloodless field  With liquid fires melt thy rich beauties down  Rifle thy wealth yet give thee all my own  So should our wars be rapture and delight  But now I'm summon'd to another fight  'Tis not my fault that I am forc'd away  But when my honour calls I must obey  Durst I not death and every danger brave  I were not worthy of the bliss I have  More hazards than another would I meet  Only to lay more laurels at your feet  Oh do not fear that I should faithless prove  For you my only life have all my love  The thought of you shall help me to subdue  I'll conquer faster to return to you  But if my honours should be laid in dust  And I must fall as Heaven has said I must  Ev'n in my death my only grief will be  That I for ever shall be snatch'd from thee  That that alone occasions all my fears  Shakes my resolves and melts me into tears  My beating heart pants to thee as I speak  And wishes rather than depart to break  Feel how it trembles with a panic fright  Sure it will never fail me thus in fight  I cannot longer hold this fond discourse  For now the trumpets sound our sad divorce  Sound every trumpet there beat every drum  Use all your charms to make Achilles come  Farewell alas I have not time to tell  How wondrous loth I part once more farewell  Remember me as I'll remember you  Like me be constant and like me be true  Gods I shall ne'er be gone adieu adieu adieu"  ABSENCE  Happy that amorous youth whose mistress hear  His swelling sighs and sees his falling tears  What savage maid her pity can deny  A breaking heart and a still streaming eye  Absent alas hs spends them all in vain  While the dear cause is ignorant of his pain  Yet wretched as he is he might be blest  Would he himself contribute to his rest  Would he resolve to struggle through the net  And but a while endeavour to forget  But his mad thoughts run every passage o'er  And anxious memory makes his passion more  Perplexing memory that renews the scene  Of his past cares and keeps him still in pain  Keeps a poor wretch perpetually oppress'd  And never lets unhappy lovers rest  Lets them no pangs no cruel sufferings lose  But heaps their past upon their present woes  Such was Leander's memory when remov'd  And sunder'd by the seas from all he lov'd  The gather'd winds had wrought the tempest high  Toss'd up the ocean and obscur'd the sky  And at this time with an impetuous sway  Pour'd sorth their forces and possess'd the sea  When the bold youth stood raging on the beach  To view the muchlov'd coast he could not reach  His restless eyes ran all the distance o'er  And from afar discern'd his Hero's tower  Thrice naked in the waves his skill he try'd  And strove as he was us'd to stem the tide  But tumbling billows threaten'd present wreck  And rising up against him dash'd him back  Then like a gallant soldier forc'd to go  Full of brave wrath from a prevailing foe  Again to town he makes his sad resort  To see what ships would loosen from the port  Finding but one durst launch into the seas  He writes a letter fill'd with words like these  In imitation of Ovid Ep XVIII "Leander to Hero" N  " Read this yet be not troubled when you read  Your Lover comes not in his letter's stead  On you all health all happiness attend  Which I would much much rather bring than send  But now these envious storms obstruct my way  And only this bold bark durst put to sea  I too had come had not my parents' spies  Stood by to watch me with suspicious eyes  How many tedious days and nights are past  Since I was suffer'd to behold you last  Y  spightful Gods and Goddesses who keep  Your watery courts within the spacious deep  Why at this time are all the winds broke forth  Why swell the seas beneath the furious north  'Tis summer now when all should be serene  The sky's unclouded undisturb'd the main  Winter is yet unwilling to appear  But you invert the seasons of the year  Yet let me once attain the wish'dfor beach  Out of the now malicious Neptune's reach  Then blow ye winds ye troubled billows roar  Roll on your angry waves and lash the shore  Ruffle the seas drive the tempestuous air  Be one continued storm to keep me there  Ah Hero when to you my course is bent  I seem to slide along a smooth descent  But in returning thence I clamber up  And scale methinks some lofty mountain's top  Why when our souls by mutual love are join'd  Why are we sunder'd by the sea and wind  Either make my Abydos your retreat  Or let your Sestos be my muchlov'd seat  This plague of absence I can bear no more  Come what can come I'll shortly venture o'er  Not all the rage of seas nor force of storms  Nothing but death shall keep me from thy arms  Yet may that death at least so friendly prove  To float me to the coast of her I love  Let not the thought occasion any fear  Doubt not I will be soon and safely there  But till that time let this employ your hours  And shew you that I can be none but yours"  Mean while the vessel from the land withdrew  When Heaven took pity on a love so true  The winds to blow the waves to toss forbore  In leaps the ravish'd youth and ventures o'er  With a smooth passage to the farther shore  Now to the port the prosperous lover drives  And safely after all his toils arrives  Dissolv'd in bliss he lies the livelong night  Melts languishes and dies in vast delight  But that delight my Muse forbears to sing  She knows the weakness of her infant wing  As when the painter strove to draw the chief  Of all the Grecians in his height of grief  In every limb the wellshap'd piece excell'd  But coming to the face his pencil fail'd  There modestly he staid and held for fear  He should not reach the woe he fancied there  But round the mournful head a veil he threw  That men might guess at what he could not shew  So when our pleasure rises to excess  No tongue can tell it and no pen express  Love will not have his mysteries reveal'd  And Beauty keeps the joys it gives conceal'd  And till those joys my Delia lets me know  To me they shall continue ever so  Ah Delia would indulgent Love decree  Thy faithful slave that heaven of bliss with thee  What then should be my verse what daring flights  Should my Muse take reach what coelestial heights  Now in despair with drooping notes she sings  No dawn of hope to raise her on her wings  In the warm spring the warbling birds rejoice  And in the smiling sunshine tune their voice  Ba  k'd in the beams they strain their tender throats  Where chearful light inspires the charming notes  Such and so charming should my numbers be  If you my only light would smile on me  Your influence would inspire as moving airs  And make my song as soft and sweet as theirs  Would you but once auspiciously incline  To raise his fame who only writes for thine  I'd sing such notes as none but you could teach  And none but one who loves like me can reach  Secure of you what raptures could I boast  How wretched shall I be when you are lost  Ah think what pangs despairing lovers prove  And what a bless'd estate were mutual love  How might my soul be with your favour rais'd  And how in pleasing you myself be pleas'd  With what delight what transport could I burn  Did but my flames receive the least return  How would one tender look one pitying smile  Or one kind word from you reward my toil  It must and would your tenderest pity move  Were you but once convinc'd how well I love  By every Power that reigns and rules on high  By Love the mightiest power of all the sky  By your dear self my last great oath I swear  That neither life nor soul are half so dear  What need I these superfluous vows repeat  Already sigh'd so often at your feet  You know my passion is sincere and true  I love you to excess you know I do  No tongue no pen can what I feel express  Ev'n poetry itself must make it less  You haunt me still whereever I remove  There's no retreat secure from Fate or Love  My soul from yours no distance can divide  No rocks nor caves can from your presence hide  By day your lovely form fills all my sight  Nor do I lose you when I lose the light  You are the charming phantom of the night  Still your dear image dances in my view  And all my restless thoughts run still on you  You only are the sleeping poet's dream  And when awake you only are his theme  Were I by some yet harder fortune hurl'd  To the remotest parts of all the world  The coldest northern clime the torrid zone  Should hear me sing of you and you alone  That pleasing task should all my hours employ  Spent in a charming melancholy joy  The chorus of the birds the whispering boughs  And murmuring streams should join to sooth my woes  My thoughts of you should yield a sad delight  While joy and grief contend like day and night  With smiles and tears resembling sun and rain  To keep the pleasure I'd endure the pain  If such content my troubled soul could know  Such satisfaction mix'd with so much woe  If but my thoughts could keep my wishes warm  Ah how would your transporting presence charm  How pleasant would these pathless wilds appear  Were you alone my kind companion here  What should I then have left me to deplore  Oh what society to wish for more  No country thou art in can desart be  And towns are desolate depriv'd of thee  Banish'd with thee I could an exile bear  Banish'd from thee the banishment lies there  I to some lonely isle with thee could fly  Where not a creature dwells but thou and I  Wh  re a widespreading main around us roars  Besprinkling with its foam our desart shores  Where winds and waves in endless wars engage  And highwrought tides roll with eternal rage  Where ships far off their fearful courses steer  And no bold vessel ever ventures near  Should rising seas swell over every coast  Were mankind in a second deluge lost  Did only two of all the world survive  Only one man one woman left alive  And should the Gods that lot to us allow  Were I Deucalion and my Pyrtha thou  Contentedly I should my fate embrace  And would not beg them to renew our race  All my most ardent wishes should implore  All I should ask from each indulgent Power  Would be to keep thee safe and have no more  Your cruelty occ  sions all my smart  Your kindness could restore my bleeding heart  You w  rk me to a storm you make me calm  You give the wound and can infuse the balm  Of you I boast of you alone complain  My greatest pleasure and my greatest pain  Whene'er you grieve I can no comfort know  And when you first are pleas'd I must be so  While you are well there's no disease I feel  And I enjoy no health when you are ill  Whate'er you do my actions does direct  Your smile can raise me and your frown deject  Whome'er you love I by the selfsame fate  Love too and hate whatever wretch you hate  With yours my wishes and my passions join  Your humour and your interest all is mine  I share in all nor can my fortunes be  Unhappy let but Fortune smile on thee  You can preserve you only can destroy  Increase my sorrow or create my joy  From you and you alone my doom I wait  You are the Star whose influence rules my fate  On yours my being and my life depend  And mine shall last no more when yours must end  No toil would be too great no task too hard  Were you at last to be my rich reward  In serving you I'd spend my latest breath  Brave any danger run on any death  I live but for your sake and when I die  All I shall pray for is may you be by  No life like living with thee can delight  No death can please like dying in thy sight  Oh when I must by Heaven's severe decree  Be snatch'd from all that's dear be snatch'd from thee  May'st thou be present to disp  l my fear  And soften with thy charms the pangs I bear  While on thy lips I pour my panting breath  Look thee all o'er and clasp thee close in death  Sigh out my soul upon thy panting breast  And with a passion not to be express'd  Sink at thy feet into eternal rest  A PASTORAL ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF DELIA  BY THE SAME  " Quam referent Musae vivet dum robora tellus  " Dum coelum stellas dum vehet amnis aquas"  TIBULLUS I iv  THYRSIS  STAY wretched swain lie here and here lament  Press not too far your strength already spent  Long has distracting sorrow made you rove  Through every desart plain and dismal grove  Still silent with excess of grief and love  Feebly your trembling legs beneath you go  And bend o'erburdened with their load of woe  Stay and this melancholy grotto choose  A proper mansion for a mourning Muse  Lay your tir'd limbs extended on the moss  And tell the listening woods of Delia's loss  Here the sad Muse need no disturbance fear  For not a living thing inhabits here  Musick may give your sorrows some relief  And I by listening to you share your grief  DAPHNIS  What musick now can my sad numbers boast  What Muse invoke alas my Muse is lost  Long since my useless pipe was thrown aside  My reeds were broke that hour that Delia died  From her alone their inspiration came  She gave the verse and was the verse's theme  For ever should my sorrows keep me dumb  Silent as death and hush'd as Delia's tomb  Did not the force of Love unlock my tongue  Lest her dear beauties should remain unsung  Her charms let every Muse conspire to tell  And that once done let every Muse farewell  This the last tribute of my verse I bring  To sing her death and then no more to sing  Be still ye winds or in soft whispers blow  Ye purling streams with gentler murmurs flow  Let lambs forbear to bleat and herds to low  Let all in easy mournful numbers move  Let all be soft and artless as my Love  Oh she was every way divinely fair  Charming in person and in soul sincere  She was alas more than the Muse can tell  Well worthy love and was belov'd as well  She wasalas these tears that saying draws  Oh 'tis a cruel killing word  She was  Now she no more must tread the flowery plains  No more be gaz'd at by admiring swains  No more the choicest flowers and daisies choose  Or pluck the pasture for her tender ewes  Say ye poor flocks how often have ye stood  And from her lovely hands receiv'd your food  Now ye no more from those fair hands must feast  Those hands which gave the flowers a sweeter taste  Mourn her by whom ye were so often fed  And cry with me the shepherdess is dead  This the last tribute of my verse I bring  To sing her death and then no more to sing  Weep for her loss relenting Heaven and keep  Time with our tears Heaven seems apace to weep  In murmuring drops the mournful rain distills  And fable clouds wrap round the sides of hills  The goat forbears to browze the tender ewe  Will drink no longer of the falling dew  No morning larks their mounting wings display  Or chear with warbling airs the dusky day  On dropping boughs sad nightingales complain  Join in my songs but sing like me in vain  In doleful notes the murmuring turtles coo  Each of them seems t' have lost a Delia too  The melting air in mists its sorrows shews  And cold damp sweat the face of earth bedews  With tears the Rivergods enlarge their spring  Swans in sad strains on swelling waters sing  In sighs the God of Winds his passion vents  And all all Nature for her loss laments  This the last tribute of my verse I bring  To sing her death and then no more to sing  How often on the banks of silver Thames  My eyes on hers and hers upon the streams  Has she stood listening when I told my flames  How often has a sudden sidelong look  Seem'd to confess her pity when I spoke  Pity I had though I could never move  In her cold breast the least return of love  Pity from her more welcome did receive  Than all the love another fair could give  And it was some some small relief to see  She lov'd not others though she lov'd not me  Say gentle Thames how often have I stood  Viewing her dear reflection in your flood  When on her face I durst not gaze for fear  How often have I look'd and found it there  How often have I wish d my verse might prove  Smooth as your stream whene'er I writ of Love  Say how your courteous waves would never flow  O'er any path where she was us'd to go  Now let your river like my eyes run o'er  Insult with fuller tides the desart shore  And drown those banks where Delia walks no more  This the last tribute of my verse I bring  To sing her death and then no more to sing  Blue violets and blushing roses fade  Fold your silk leaves and hang your drooping head  Shut up your sweets and seem like Delia dead  Let Spring run backwards and the vintage blast  Let constant showers lay all the country waste  Let flames unto the centre downwards tend  And let the floods untoss'd by winds ascend  Let all things change and wear another face  Let Nature not appear the same she was  Let fowl to dwell beneath the waters try  And let the watery herd attempt to fly  Let wolves protect the flocks upon the plains  Let bashful virgins woo disdainful swains  Let savage Death its cruelty pursue  And since my Delia's dead let me die too  This the last tribute of my verse I bring  To sing her death and then no more to sing  See where the God of Love all sad appears  His smoaking torch extinguish'd with his tears  Well may he weep for his declining power  His charm is done since Delia is no more  Through her he conquer'd and through her he reign'd  Her beauties his decaying sway sustain'd  And she now gone his empire is disdain'd  See where Diana with a stately train  Of goodly nymphs descends upon the plain  Each of them weeps and leans upon her bow  And mourns her fellow Delia wanting now  The Goddess grieves to see her train decreas'd  And swelling sighs shake every virgin breast  Unhurt they let the stags beside them pass  Nor follow boars that tempt them to the chace  In several forms of woe their grief they vent  And all with me for Delia's loss lament  This the last tribute of my verse I bring  To sing her death and then no more to sing  Look yonder where the lovely nymph is laid  I'll go and on her earth recline my head  Choak with my sighs and hasten to the dead  Come hither all ye swains with garlands come  Pour out your richest perfumes on her tomb  Let myrtles on her grave unplanted grow  In ready wreaths for every lover's brow  Let flowers unknown before be daily seen  To raise their heads above the spacious green  Millions of blooming sweets her earth surround  And balmy gums distill upon the ground  Here let the tuneful Muse for ever cease  To give unutterable sorrow place  Let sighs and streaming tears resume their course  And my sad eyes be their eternal source  I'll go and choose some melancholy cave  As undisturb'd and secret as the grave  I'll feast my eyes with nothing fair on earth  Nor shall my ears hear any sound of mirth  Farewell ye charming choiristers that dwell  In sacred groves ye warbling birds farewell  Adieu ye nymphs adieu ye fellow swains  Ye silver streams sweet swans and flowery plains  Farewell all happy days and smiling hours  Refreshing valleys and delightful bowers  Adieu to every grotto every grove  Adieu to Poetry adieu to Love  PHOEBUS AND DAPHNE  FROM OVID'S METAMORPHOSES BOOK I  BY THE SAME  NO beauteous nymph could youthful Phoebus move  Till Daphne's charms inspir'd him first with love  A virgin sprung from Peneus' silver stream  Fair as the crystal waters whence she came  No blind effects of chance subdued the god  But just revenge which injur'd Cupid ow'd  For Phoebus saw him as his bow he drew  And scoffing cry'd "Those are not arms for you  To me your quiver and your shafts resign  They load your shoulders but sit well on mine  Your arrows drop from your enervate arm  And are not sent with force enough to harm  But when I shoot with my unerring hands  On the fleet shaft as fleet a death attends  Witness the monstrous Python lately slain  Against whose scales your darts had been in vain  He still had liv'd and ravag'd all the plain  In yonder vale by me behold him kill'd  Shedding his poisonous gore o'er all the field  Be you content to kindle amorous fires  Inspiring childish loves and soft desires  Attempt not things beyond your feeble powers  Hold your own empire and usurp not ours  The slighted God in short replies by thee  Let other breasts be pierc'd but thine by me  As human force is conquer'd by divine  So shalt thou find my powers excelling thine"  He spoke and spread his wings and mounted up  Nor rested till he reach'd Parnassus' top  From his full quiver all his darts he drew  And from them all he made his choice of two  Differing the passions which their points create  The one producing love the other hate  With this the beauteous virgin's breast he pierc'd  But he wounds Phoebus deeper with the first  High on the mountain's utmost cliff he stood  And took his fatal aim and shot the god  Swiftly it flies through his envenom'd reins  Fires all his blood and poisons all his veins  The deadly shafts their purpos'd ends obtain  Work love in him in her as fierce disdain  Her only joy was ranging through the grove  To shun her lovers and their tales of love  There the wild boars were wounded with her spear  Her only passion was to conquer there  All her attire was like Diana's train  Alike her humour in avoiding men  Her numerous courtiers met with numerous slights  She fled from Hymen and his hated rites  Oft had her father prompted her to wed  By fond desires of future grandsons led  Oft had he told her that she ow'd a debt  Of smiling nephews which he hop'dfor yet  She starts and thinks she understands him wrong  Nor would have heard it from another tongue  Then hanging on her father thus she pray'd  " Oh only lov'd of all your sex she said  Oh give me leave to live and die a maid"  He too indulgent yields but yields in vain  To what she cannot from herself obtain  That matchless form was made to be admir'd  And she is in her own despight desir'd  The youthful Phoebus courts her for his bride  And loves too fiercely to be long deny'd  With hopes he would not for his godhead lose  By his own oracles deceiv'd he wooes  As fi  es in spacious fields of stubble thrown  When the first blaze of flame is once begun  The winds with fury drive the torrent on  So burns the god and so receives the fires  And sooths with flattering hopes his fond desires  He sees her hair dishevel'd on her back  And part in circles twining round her neck  " If such their charms disorder'd thus he cry'd  Ah what if Nature were with Art supply'd"  He sees her sparkling eyes that shine like stars  But with an influence far more strong than theirs  He sees her balmy lips and longs to kiss  For oh he is not satisfy'd he sees  Her hands and arms fill his unwearied sight  He looks on all with wonder and delight  He sees her snowy thighs her swelling breast  If aught lay hid he still concludes it best  And yet in vain is all the God can say  The dear disdainful virgin will not stay  But flies the swifter as she hears him pray  " Stay Daphne stay it is no foe pursues  I follow not as lustful Satyrs use  The trembling deer fly from the lion so  The lambs from wolves each from his mortal foe  They by their swift pursuit their prey design  But love the tenderest love occasions mine  Beware dear maid lest any barbarous thorn  Tear those soft limbs too beauteous to be torn  Rough are the ways you follow with such speed  Ah yet beware be cautious how you tread  Or stay or do not make such dangerous haste  I too will stay or not pursue so fast  Stay Daphne stay ah whither do you run  Alas fond nymph you know not whom you shun  No rustic labouring hind no savage swain  I keep no lowing herds upon the plain  Delphos and Tenedos my rule obey  In several isles I several sceptres sway  All nations offer incense at my shrine  And all those beams that light the world are mine  Jove does acknowledge me his darling son  And gives me power the greatest next his own  I know what Time bears in her teeming womb  And all that was and is and is to come  I teach soft numbers to the mighty Nine  The wondrous harmony they make is mine  Sure are the wounds I send from every dart  But Love made surer when he pierc'd my heart  To the sick earth safe remedies I give  Allotting man a longer time to live  To me the use of every herb is known  Vain art alas since Love is cur'd by none  To all besides they do their aid afford  Unable only to relieve their Lord"  Much more he would have told the flying fair  But the regardless virgin would not hear  With doubled swiftness she outruns the wind  And leaves his yet unfinish'd speech behind  The winds that toss'd her flowing robes abroad  Shew'd a whole Heaven of beauty to the God  Her naked limbs to his full view display'd  The God the ravish'd God saw all the maid  Her every step inflames his fierce desires  Her every motion fans the raging fires  Still the fair nymph grew lovelier as she fled  Loose in the air her golden locks were spread  And her cheeks glow'd with an unusual red  Th' impatient God admits no more delay  And throws no more unheeded words away  Stronger his pliant limbs he strives to move  Love urges on he takes new force from love  So the swift greyhound when his game he views  With eager stretch o'er all the plain pursues  Now comes so near that he is forc'd to stoop  With the false hopes he has to snatch her up  The trembling hare runs on with dreadful doubt  Whether she is already seiz'd or not  She uses all her art to help her flight  And doubles just enough to scape the bite  So Daphne flies wing'd with her mortal fear  Wing'd with his love so Phoebus follows her  But he still gains advantage in the race  For Love redoubles his impetuous pace  With arms expanded he pursues the fair  And plies his eager feet so very near  She feels his breath warm through her flying hair  Now as her utmost force was wellnigh spent  And her o'erlabour'd legs began to faint  Her course to that delightful stream she bends  Which from her father's silver urn descends  With moving looks the water she surveys  And thus the sad and lovely suppliant prays  Oh save me yet ere I am quite betray'd  Exert your godhead and preserve a maid  To some new form change my too charming shape  Or let me lose my being to escape  Immediate grant was given her as she pray'd  And sudden numbness through her limbs was spread  Thin films o'er all her lovely frame are cast  And with close folds they compassin her waist  Her hair to leaves her arms to branches shoot  Her feet depriv'd of swiftness form the root  Her beauteous head chang'd to the leafy top  And yet not wholly ere the God came up  For now he ran with more immoderate speed  But not with haste enough t' embrace the maid  till lovely though of human shape bereft  And he still loves her in the shape she 'as left  He lays his hand upon the newmade plant  While yet her heart beneath the rind did pant  He clasp'd her with the thought of what she 'ad been  And oh he wish'd her still the same as then  With the same scorn his kisses she disdain'd  Her scorn alas was all she still retain'd  " I have thee now such as thou art he cry'd  And thou shalt be my tree though not my bride  My quiver shall be hung upon thy boughs  And thy dear leaves be wreath'd about my brows  Thou shalt the heads of demi gods adorn  And be by poets and their heroes worn  When Caesar shall from vanquish'd nations come  Drawn in his chariot through the streets of Rome  When to the capitol their spoils they bring  And Io Paeans make th  temple ring  Then planted at Augustus' gilded doors  Thou like an houshold god shalt guard his floors  And as the tresses on my youthful head  Keep their first lustre still and never fade  The verdant beauty of thy leaves shall last  Not to be wither'd by the Winter's blast"  Thus the God finish'd and the Laurel bow'd  Her branches down to thank the bounteous God  JUPITER AND EUROPA  FROM OVID'S METAMORPHOSES BOOK II  BY THE SAME  GReatness does always our desires oppose  And Majesty and Love are mortal foes  Jove knew too well it hinder'd the design  He could not compass in a form divine  He casts his eagle off and royal crown  And lets his bolts fall to the pavement down  Divested thus he quits the blest abode  Without one mark left to reveal the God  He that was wont to reign and rule on high  And shake the world with thunder from the sky  Of all the Gods the most ador'd and fear'd  Now changes to a bull and joins the he  d  Large curls adorn'd his front and hid his chest  Of all he seem'd by far the noblest beast  By something still distinguish'd from the rest  His whiteness did the new fall'n snow excel  While it remains unsullied as it fell  His horns were small like glittering jewels bright  And seem'd design'd for beauty more than fight  His peaceful look no signs of fury shows  He wears no marks of terror on his brows  The royal maid beheld him with delight  Surpriz'd with pleasure at th' unusual sight  Yet was her pleasure first allay'd with fear  Till by degrees at last advancing near  With flowers more welcome than his heavenly food  Given by those hands she fed the ravish  d God  Softly with secret joy those hands he prest  And too too eager to be wholly blest  Hardly ah hardly he forbears the rest  Now with large leaps he bounds upon the land  Anon he rolls along the golden sand  As ner fears vanish'd she approach'd the beast  And venturing farther stroak'd his panting breast  And crown'd his horns with flowers too venturous at the last  More favours thus th' unwary nymph bestow'd  Than she had given him had he seem'd a God  Still daring more down on his back she sate  Alas she knew not who sustain'd her weight  Then then the God rose with his wish'dfor prey  And wing'd with his success soon reach'd the sea  Vain were her cries all her resistance vain  While Jove in triumph bore her through the main  She casts her eyes on the forsaken coast  Which lessen'd till the view was wholly lost  She sigh'd and wept and look'd despairing back  Yet still she held his horns still clasp'd his neck  While with the winds her looser garments flow'd  And spread a grateful covering o'er the God  NARCISSUS AND ECHO  FROM OVID'S METAMORPHOSES BOOK III  BY THE SAME  THE vocal nymph this lovely huntsman view'd  As he into the toils his prey pursued  Though of the power of speaking first debarr'd  She could not hold from answering what she heard  The jealous Juno by her wiles betray'd  Took this revenge on the deceitful maid  For when she might have seiz'd her faithless Jove  Often in amorous thefts of lawless love  Her tedious talk would make the Goddess stay  And give her rivals time to run away  Which when she found she cried "For such a wrong  Small be the power of that deluding tongue"  Immediately the deed confirm'd the threats  For Echo only what she hears repeats  Now at the sight of the fair youth she glows  And follows silently wheree'er he goes  The nearer she pursued the more she mov'd  Through the dear track he trod the more she lov'd  Still her approach inflam'd her fierce desile  As sulphurous torches catch the neighbouring fire  How often would she strive but strive in vain  To tell her passion and confess her pain  A thousand tender things her thoughts suggest  With which she would have woo'd but they supprest  For want of speech lay bury'd in her breast  Begin she could not but she stay'd to wait  Till he should speak and she his speech repeat  Now several ways his young companions gone  And for some time Narcissus left alone  " Where are you all" at last she hears him call  And she strait answers him  Where are you all  Around he lets his wandering eyesight roam  But sees no creature whence the voice should come  " Speak yet again he cries is any nigh"  Again the mournful Echo answers  I    " Why come not you" says he appear in view  She hastily returns  Why come not you  Once more the voice th' astonish'd huntsman try'd  Louder he call'd and louder she reply'd  " Then let us join" at last Narcissus said  Then let us join  replied the ravish'd maid  Scarce had she spoke when from the woods she sprung  And on his neck with close embraces hung  But he with all his strength unlocks her fold  And breaks unkindly from her feeble hold  Then proudly cries "Life shall this breast forsake  Ere you loose Nymph on me your pleasure take"  On me your pleasure take  the Nymph replies  While from her the disdainful huntsman flies  Repuls'd with speed she seeks the gloomiest groves  And pines to think on her rejected loves  Alone laments her illrequired flame  And in the closest thickets shrouds her shame  Her rage to be refus'd yields no relief  But her fond passion is increas'd by grief  The thoughts of such a slight all sleep suppress'd  And kept her languishing for want of rest  Now pin  s she quite away with anxious care  Her skin contracts her blood dissolves to air  Nothing but voice and bones she now retains  These turn to stones but still the voice remains  In woods caves hills for ever hid she lies  Heard by all ears but never seen by eyes  Thus her and other nymphs his proud disdain  With an unheardof cruelty h  d slain  Many on mountains and in rivers borne  Thus perish'd underneath his haughty scorn  When one who in their sufferings bore a share  With suppliant hands address'd this humble prayer  " Thus may he love himself and thus despair"  Nor were her prayers at an ill hour preferr'd  Rhamnusia the revengeful Goddess heard  Nature had plac'd a crystal fountain near  The water deep but to the bottom clear  Whose silver spring ascended gently up  And bubbled softly to the silent top  The surface smooth as icy lakesappear'd  Unknown by herdsman undisturb'd by herd  No bending tree above its surface grows  Or scatters thence its leaves or broken boughs  Yet at a just convenient distance stood  All round the peaceful spring a stately wood  Through whole thick tops no sun could shoot his beams  Nor view his image in the silver streams  Thither from hunting and the scorching heat  The wearied youth was one day led by Fate  Down on his face to drink the spring he lies  But as his image in that glass he spies  He drinksin passion deeper at his eyes  His own reflection works his wild desire  And he himself sets his own self on fire  Fix'd as some statue he preserves his place  Intent his looks and motionless his face  Deep through the spring his eyeballs dart their beams  Like midnight stars that twinkle in the streams  His ivory neck the crystal mirror shows  His waving hair above the surface flows  His cheeks reflect the lily and the rose  His own perfection all his passions mov'd  He loves himself who for himself was lov'd  Who seeks is sought who kindles the desires  Is scorch'd himself who is admir'd admires  Oft would he the deceitful spring embrace  And seek to fasten on that lovely face  Oft with his downthrust arms he thought to fold  About that neck that still deludes his hold  He gets no kisses from those cozening lips  His arms grasp nothing from himself he slips  He knows not what he views and yet pursues  His desperate love and burns for what he views  Catch not so fondly at a fleeting shade  And be no longer by yourself betray'd  It borrows all it has from you alone  And it can boast of nothing of its own  With you it comes with you it stays and so  Would go away had you the power to go  Neither for sleep nor hunger would he move  But gazing still augments his hopeless love  Still o'er the spring he keeps his bending head  Still with that flattering form his eyes he fed  And silently surveys the treacherous shade  To the deafwoods at length his grief he vents  And in these words the wretched youth laments  " Tell me ye hills and dales and neighbouring groves  You that are conscious of so many loves  Say have you ever seen a lover pine  Like me or ever known a love like mine  I know not whence this sudden flame should come  I like and see but see I know not whom  What grieves me more no rocks nor rolling seas  No strongwall'd cities nor untrodden ways  Only a slender silver stream destroys  And casts the bar between our sundered joys  Ev'n he too seems to feel an equal flame  The same his passion his desires the same  As oft as I my longing lips decline  To join with his his mount to meet with mine  So near our faces and our mouths approach  That almost to ourselves we seem to touch  Come forth whoe'er thou art and do not f  y  From one so passionately fond as I  I've nothing to deserve your just disdain  But have been lov'd as I love you in vain  Yet all the signs of mutual love you give  And my poor hopes in all your actions live  When in the stream our hands I strive to join  Yours straight ascend and halfway grasp at mine  You smile my smiles when I a tear let fall  You shed another and consent in all  And when I speak your lovely lips appear  To utter something which I cannot hear  Alas 'tis I myself too late I see  My own deceitful shade has ruin'd me  With a mad passion for myself I 'm curs'd  And bear about those flames I kindled first  In so perplex'd a case what can I do  Ask or be ask'd shall I be woo'd or woo  All that I wish I have what would I more  Ah 'tis my too great plenty makes me poor  Divide me from myself ye Powers Divine  Nor let his Being intermix with mine  All that I love and wish for now retake  A strange request for one in love to make  I feel my strength decay with inward grief  And hope to lose my sorrows with my life  Nor would I mourn my own untimely fate  Where he I love allow'd a longer date  This makes me at my cruel stars repine  That his much dearer life must end with mine"  This said again he turns his watery face  And gazes wildly in the crystal glass  While streaming tears from his full eyelids fell  And drop by drop rais'd circles in the well  The several rings larger and larger spread  And by degrees dispers'd the fleeting shade  Which when perceiv'd "Oh whither would you go  He cries ah whither whither fly you now  Stay lovely shade do not so cruel prove  In leaving me who to distraction love  Let me still see what ne'er can be possess'd  And with the sight alone my frenzy feast"  Now frantic with his grief his robe he tears  And tokens of his rage his bosom bears  The cruel wounds on his pure body show  Like crimson mingling with the whitest snow  Like apples with vermilion circles stripe  Or a fair bunch of grapes not fully ripe  But when he looks and sees the wounds he made  Writ on the bosom of the charming shade  His sorrow would admit of no relief  But all his sense was swallow'd in his grief  As wax near any kindled fuel plac'd  Melts and is sensibly perceiv'd to waste  As morning frosts are found to thaw away  When once the sun begins to warm the day  So the fond Youth dissolves in hopeless fires  And by degrees consumes in vain desires  His lovely cheeks now lost their white and red  Diminish'd was his strength his beauty fled  His body from its just proportions fell  Which the scorn'd Echo lately lov'd so well  Yet though her first resentments she retain'd  And still remembered how she was disdain'd  She sigh'd and when the wretched lover cried  " Alas"  Alas  the woeful Nymph reply'd  Then when with cruel blows his hands would wound  His tender breast she still restor'd the sound  Now hanging o'er the spring his drooping head  With a sad sigh these dying words he said  " Ah boy belov'd in vain" Through all the plain  ECHO resounds  Ah boy belov'd in vain  "  " Farewell" he cries and with that word he died  Farewell  the miserable Nymph reply'd  Now pale and breathless on the grass he lies  For Death had shut his selfadmiring eyes  Now wafted over to the Stygian coast  The waters there reflect his wandering ghost  In loud laments his weeping sisters mourn  Which Echo makes the neighbouring hills return  All signs of desperate grief the nymphs express  Great is the moan yet is not Echo's less  The story of "Salmacis and Hermaphroditus" from the Fourth Book of Ovid and that of "Cinyras and Myrrha" from the Tenth Book are purposely omitted no elegance of numbers can atone for gross indecency N  SCYLLA'S PASSION FOR MINOS  FROM OVID'S METAMORPHOSES BOOK VIII  BY THE SAME  A Tower with sounding walls erected stands  The sacred fabric of Apollo's hands  His harp laid by the strings their airs dispense  And vocal stones receiv'd their virtue thence  This Scylla in the time of peace ascends  And thence her look o'er all the lawns extends  Now with delight she views the spacious town  Now pleas'd with dropping little pebbles down  Strikes a sweet music from the warbling stone  In times of war the selfsame prospect yields  The pleasing horror of the bloody fields  Long had they now in equal balance hung  And doubtful victory depended long  This gave her leisure to discern and know  The several leaders of the neighbouring foe  Minos their General most of all she knew  More than a virtuous virgin ought to do  Whether his helmet glitter'd from afar  And with its waving feathers threatened war  Whether his hands his shining sword would weild  Or his strong arm raise his refulgent shield  Whate'er she saw him do she prais'd and lov'd  And kept him still in view wheree'er he mov'd  Whene'er he sho  k a spear or cast a dart  She knew not which excell'd his strength or art  Whene'er he drew a shaft she'd swear that so  Ev'n Phoebus would himself discharge his bow  But when his naked visage he disclos'd  His charming face to public view expos'd  When on his foaming horse he rode the plains  Ruling with skilful hands the stubborn reins  Then like tempestuous seas her passions roll  Mad her sick brain and rack her troubled soul  Happy she calls the courser which he press'd  Happy the launce he couch'd within his rest  Happy the vamplate that secur'd his breast  Now would she think of flying to the foe  And would have gone had she a way to go  Now headlong from the tower herself have sent  And ventur'd life to reach her lover's tent  Open the brazen gates when Love inspir'd  Or act whate'er the foe she lov'd desir'd  Silent she  ate with a distracted look  Till passion gave her leave and then she spoke  " In this unhappy war and fatalstrife  I know not which to yield to joy or grief  Though 'tis my fate to love my country's foe  I had not seen him had he not been so  Yet might they let their fierce contentions fall  And making peace make me the pledge for all  Minos and I once join'd our wars might cease  And that alliance fix a lasting peace  Well might your mother's charms a God subdue  If ever she could charm dear Youth like you  Happy thrice happy had I wings to fly  To yonder tents where the lov'd foe does lie  I'd tell the dear disturber of my rest  All that I feel could it he all express'd  And pour my soul into the charmer's breast  Give all I can to make him once my own  All he should ask allbut my father's crown  This love sh  ll cease these fierce desires shall die  re I by treachery my wish enjoy  Yet when a generous foe disputes the field  It is not safest to resist but yield  The tragic destiny of his darling son  Has brought at last these fatal mischiefs on  In a just cause his vengeful sword he draws  Strong is his army to maintain his cause  Needs must my charming hero prosperous prove  Then let him owe his conquest to my love  Thus thousands will be sav'd who else must bleed  And daily perish if the wars proceed  Minos will thus be safe and I be blest  Else he may chance to perish with the rest  Some rash unknowing hand his spear may dart  Against my too too venturous hero's heart  For who without concern his wounds could see  Or who would wound him if he knew 't was he  'Tis then resolv'd lest such a chance should fall  On him I love so well I 'll hazard all  My country and myself one gift I'll join  And make the merit of his conquest mine  To will is nothing when we can't fulfil  For wretched want of power the things we will  The gates are kept with a sufficient'guard  And every night my father sees them barr'd  'Tis he destroys my bliss 'tis him I fear  Would he were with the dead or I were there  Might I not injuring him my bliss pursue  Indulgent Gods but why invoke I you  We our own Gods have power ourselves to bless  And from ourselves derive our own success  The only way to prosper is to dare  For Fortune listens not to lazy prayer  Others inflam'd with such a fierce desire  Have forc'd through all to quench their raging fire  Shall any other then more resolute prove  Through fire and sword I'd force my way to love  Yet to assist me here I need not call  For fire or sword my father's hair  "Opus est mihi crine paterno" Ovid Met viii The expression is explained by the commentators  "to betray the secret counsels of her father"  N  is all  That that must crown my joys and make me blest  Beyond whatever else can be possess'd  Beyond what can be by my words express'd"  CEYX AND HALCYONE  FROM OVID'S METAMORPHOSES BOOK XI  BY THE SAME  Ceyx the son of Lucifer and king of Trachis a city in Thessaly having been alarmed by several prodigies prepares to go and consult Apollo's oracle at Claros  "Ad Clarium parat ire Deum" Ovid Met xi N  to learn the will of Heaven and receive the Gods' instructions His voyage the description of a storm and shipwreck the description of the God of Sleep and his palace the lamentation of Halcyone the daughter of Aeolus and wife to Ceyx for the loss of her husband with the change of both into seafowls called after her name Halcyous are the subjects of the following verses beginning with her speech to her husband to dissuade him from his intended voyage  " HOW are you chang'd of late my Love how grown  So tir'd of me so pressing to be gone  What have I done to make my lord remove  So far from her who once had all his love  Is your Halcyone no longer dear  Or to whatever place your course you steer  Can you enjoy yourself and she not there  Yet if you went by land 't were some relief  For all that would torment me then were grief  But now at once with grief and fear opprest  A thousand anxious thoughts destroy my rest  And not on  dawn of comfort chears my breast  The faithless seas are what alas I fear  I must not let my Ceyx venture there  Oft have I heard their troubled waters roar  And seen their foaming waves surmount the shore  Oft seen the wreck come floating to the coast  And venturous wretches by their folly lost  Nor have I seldom sad inscriptions read  On marble tombs which yet inclos'd no dead  Let me alone my Ceyx be believ'd  And be not by your flattering hopes deceiv'd  Trust not the seas although my father binds  Within his rocky caves the struggling winds  If once broke loose nought can their rage restrain  They sweep o'er all the earth swell all the main  Drive clouds on clouds by an abortive birth  From their dark wombs flashing the thunder forth  More more than what my feeble words express  Which only represent their fury less  Let me persuade for I have seen them rage  Seen all the wars the fighting winds could wage  Did you like me their stern encounters know  As daring as you are you would not go  If all this fail to move your stubborn mind  And you will go oh leave not me behind  Take me along let me your fortunes share  There's nought too hard for love like mine to bear  In storms and calms together let us keep  Together brave the dangers of the deep  The grant of this my flattering love assures  Which knows no joys and feels no griefs but yours"  Thus spoke the lovely queen all drown'd in tears  Nor was her husband's passion less than hers  Yet would he not his first resolves recall  Nor suffering her to venture hazard all  He said whate'er he fancy'd might abate  Her griefs although his own were full as great  Yet all in vain he labour'd to remove  The tender fears of her prophetic love  Still the same sighs from her heav'd heart arise  And the same streams still bubble at her eyes  All this succeeding not "My love he cry'd  The last best speech that could be then apply'd  To you should Ceyx' absence tedious seem  Believe that yours is not less so to him  For by my father's brightest fires I swear  By your dear self believe my mournful dear  Ere twice the moon renews her blunted horns  If destiny permits your love returns"  This just suffic'd to ease her troubled heart  And of her many cares dispel a part  And now he bids them launch without delay  While she took truce with grief to sail away  That last command awak'd her sleeping fears  And she again seem'd all dissolv'd in tears  Around his neck her circling arms she threw  And mix'd with sighs forc'dout a faint adieu  Then as he left her hold too feeble grown  Robb'd of her dear support to stand alone  The last sad pangs at parting sunk her down  Th' impatient seamen call upon their lord  And almost bear him thence by force aboard  Then having fix'd their oars begin to sweep  And cleave with welltim'd strokes the yielding deep  Faintly her opening eyes the ship survey  Which bears her lord and her last hopes away  In their own tears her trembling eyeballs swim  Which hinder'd not but she distinguish'd him  Too distant now for words aloft he stands  On the tall deck and she upon the sands  Wafts her last farewell with her lifted hands  Then as the ship drove farther from the coast  And that dear object in the crowd was lost  The flying bark her following eyes pursue  That gone the sails employ'd her latest view  All out of sight she seeks the widow'd bed  Where Ceyx and herself so oft were laid  But now half fill'd the sad remembrance mov'd  Of the dear man who made the whole belov'd  By this the gathering winds began to blow  Their useless oars the joyful seamen stow  Then hoist their yards while loosen'd from the masts  The widestretch'd sails receive the coming blasts  DESCRIPTION OF A STORM AND SHIPWRECK  Now far from either shore they plough'd their way  And all behind them and before was sea  When with the growing night the winds rose high  And swelling seas presag'd a tempest nigh  Aloud the ma  ter crie  "  url all the sails  No longer spread to catch the flying gales"  But his commands are borne unheard away  Drown'd in the roar of a far louder sea  Yet of themselves their tasks the sailors know  And are by former storms instructed now  Some to the masts the struggling canvass bind  And leave free passage to the raging wind  Some stop the leaks while some the billows cast  Back on the sea which rolls them back as fast  Thus in confusion they their parts perform  While fighting winds increase th' impetuous storm  Amaz'd the pilot sees the waves come on  Too thick and fast for his weak skill to shun  On every side the threatening billows fall  And art is a  a loss to scape them all  The cries of men the rattling of the shrouds  Fl  ods dash'd on floods and clouds encountering clouds  Fierce winds beneath above a thundering sky  Unite their rage to work the tempest high  Vast billows after bil  ows tumbling come  And rolling seas grow white with angry foam  To mountainous heights the swelling surges rise  Waves pil'd on waves seem equal with the skies  Now rushing headlong with a rapid force  Look black as Hell to which they bend their course  The ship on rising seas is lifted up  And now seems seated on a mountain top  Surveying thence the Stygian lakes that flow  And roll their distant waters far below  Now downwards with the tumbling billows driven  From Hell's profoundest depth looks up to Heaven  Waves after waves the shatter'd vessel crush  All sides alike they charge on all they rush  While with a noise th' assaulting billows roar  As loud as battering rams that force a tower  As lions fearless and secure from harms  Rush with prodigious rage on pointed arms  Chaf'd if repuls'd they run the fiercer on  And lash themselves to fury as they run  So roll the seas with such resistless force  And gather strength in their impetuous course  Now start the planks and leave the vessel's sides  Wide open to receive the conquering tides  In at the breach the raging waters come  All pressing to pursue their conquest home  Fierce Neptune now who long alone had strove  As if too weak himself seeks aid from Jove  Whole Heaven dissolves in one continued rain  Descending in a deluge to the main  Whose mounting billows toss it back again  Seeming by turns each other to supply  The sky the seas and now the seas the sky  Showers join with waves and pour in torrents down  And all the floods of Heaven and Earth grow one  No glimpse of light is seen no sparkles fly  From friendly stars through the benighted sky  Double the horror of the night is grown  The tempest's darkness added to her own  Till thundering clouds strike out a dismal light  More dreadful than the depth of blackest night  Upwards the waves to catch the flames aspire  And all the rolling surges seem on fire  Now o'er the hatches mad with rage they tower  And strive possess'd of them to conquer more  As a brave soldier whom the strong desire  And burning thirst of glory set on fire  With more than common ardor in his breast  And higher hopes spurr'd farther than the rest  Oft scales in vain a welldefended town  But mounts at length and leaps victorious down  Alone of all the dreadful shock abides  While thousand others perish by his sides  So the tenth billow rolling from afar  More vigorous than the rest maintains the war  Now gains the deck and with success grown bold  Pours thence in triumph down and sacks the hold  Part still without the batter'd sides assail  And where that led the way attempt to scale  A  in a town already half possess'd  By foes within it and without it press'd  All tremble of their last defence bereft  And see no hope of any safety left  No aid their oft successful arts can boast  At once their courage and their skill is lost  Helpless they see the raging waters come  Each threatens death and each presents a tomb  One mourns his fate in loud complaints and tears  Another more astonish'd quite forbears  From sighs or words too faint to tell his fears  This calls them bless'd who funeral rites receive  Possess'd in quiet of a peaceful grave  This rears his suppliant hands unto the sky  And vainly looks to what he cannot spy  This thinks upon the friends he left behind  And his now orphan children rack his mind  Halcyone alone could Ceyx stir  His anxious thought ran all alone on her  One farewell view of her was all his care  And yet he then rejoic'd she was not there  For a last look fain would he turn his eyes  On her abode but knows not where it lies  The seas so whirl with such prodigious might  While pitchy clouds obscuring Heaven from sight  Increase the nativehorror of the night  Now splits the mast by furious whirlwinds torn  And now the rudder to the seas is borne  A billow with those spoils encourag'd rides  Aloft in triumph o'er the lower tides  Thence as some God had pluck'd up rocks and thrown  Whole mountains on the main she tumbles down  Down goes the ship with her unhappy freight  Unable to sustain the pressing weight  Part of her men along with her are borne  Sunk in a gulph whence they must ne'er return  Part catch at planks in hopes to float to shore  Or stem the tempest till its rage were o'er  Ev'n Ceyx of the like support possest  Swims undistinguish'd now among the rest  To his wife's father and his own prefers  His ardent vows for help which neither hears  To both repeats his stillneglected prayer  Calls oft on both but oftener calls on her  The more his danger grew the more it brought  Her dear remembrance to his restless thought  Whose dying wish was that the friendly stream  Would roll him to those coasts whence late he came  To her dear hands to be interr'd by them  Still as the seas a breathing space afford  Haleyone rehears'd forms every word  Half of her name his lips now sinking sound  When the remaining half in him was drown'd  An huge black arch of waters which had hung  High in the gloomy air and threatened long  Bu  sting asunder hurls the dreadful heap  All on his head and drives him down the deep  His father Lucifer that dismal night  Sought to retire to shun the tragic sight  But since he could not leave his destin'd sphere  Drew round the blackest clouds to veil him there  Meanwhile his wife counts every tedious hour  And knew not yet she was a wife no more  But works two robes against his wish'd return  To be by her and her dear Ceyx worn  She pays her vows to every power divine  But pays them frequentest at Juno's shrine  Bribes every goddess at a mighty cost  Of precious gums but still bribes her at most  Vain were the gifts she offer'd in her fane  She made her  aded altars smoak in vain  Where for his life and safe return she pray'd  Who was already lost already dead  " Let me again she cry'd my Ceyx see  And while away by your severe decree  Let him give none the love that's due to me  Let none she pray'd before me be preferr'd"  And this alone of all her prayers was heard  The pitying Goddess would no more receive  Vows for that succour which she could not give  But from her altar shakes her awful hand  And gives her faithful his this command  " Haste quickly where the drowsy God of Sleep  Remote from day does his dark mansions keep  Tell him I bid him in a dream reveal  To sad Haleyone how Ceyx fell  All her misfortunes in her sleep unfold  And by the vision let her loss be told"  Thus speaks the Queen of Heaven nor Iris stays  To make reply but as she speaks obeys  Straight in a thousandcolour'd robe array'd  And all her orient bow o'er Heaven display'd  Downwards she slides to find the dark abode  And bear her message to the slothful God  DESCRIPTION OF THE GOD OF SLEEP AND HIS PALACE  Near the Cimmerians hid from human sight  Lies a vast hollow cave all void of light  Where deep in earth the God his court maintains  And undisturb'd in ease and silence reigns  Not seen by Phoebus at his morning rise  Nor at midday with his most piercing eyes  Nor when at evening he descends the skies  Thick gloomy mists come steaming from the ground  And the fog spreads a dusky twilight round  No crested fowls foretell the day's return  Nor with shrill notes call forth the springing morn  No watchful dogs the secret entry keep  Nor geese more watchful guard the court of Sleep  No tame nor savage beast dwells there no breeze  Shakes the still boughs or whispers through the trees  No voice of man is heard no human call  Sounds through the cave deep silence reigns o'er all  Yet from the rock a silver spring flows down  Which purling o'er the stones glides gently on  Her easy streams with pleasing murmurs creep  At once inviting and assisting Sleep  At the cave's mouth spring pregnant poppies up  And hide the entrance with their baleful top  Whose drowsy juice affords the nightly birth  Of all the Sleep diffus'd and shed on earth  No guards the passage to this court secure  No jarring hinge sustains a creaking door  Yet in the midst with fable coverings spread  High but unshaken stands a downy bed  Where his soft limbs the slothful Monarch lays  Dissolv'd in endless luxury and ease  Fantastic dreams lie scatter'd on the ground  And compass him in various figures round  More numerous than the sands that bind the seas  Or ears of standing corn or leaves on trees  But Iris now arriv'd divinely bright  Fills all the palace with unusual light  Her garments flowing with diffusive beams  Gild the dark cell and chace the frighted Dreams  Away they fly to leave her passage clear  And shun the glories which they cannot bear  The God his eyelids struggling to unloose  Seal'd by his deep unbroken slumbers close  Half way his head uprears with sluggish pain  Which heavily anon sinks down again  Frequent attempts without success he makes  But at the last with long endeavour wakes  Half rais'd and half reclining in his bed  And leaning on his hands his nodding head  With faultering words he asks the heavenly fair  What message from her Goddess brought her there  At once the God and Goddess she obeys  Delivering her commands in words like these  " Thou Peace of mind thou most propitious Power  Thou meekest Deity that men adore  Thou who giv'st ease to every troubled breast  And set'st tir'd limbs and feverish souls at rest  Thou at whose presence cares and sorrows flee  Under whose guard the fetter'd slave is free  Lovers the worst of slaves still finding ease in thee  Send thou a Dream assuming Ceyx' form  Like him appearing shipwreck'd in a storm  From whose pale lips his widow'd queen may know  His certain loss and her as certain woe"  Here ends the shining Nymph who dares not stay  For farther words but flies in haste away  She feels the thickening mists begin to rise  And conquering Sleep steal o'er her yielding eyes  Thence by her painted bow her course she bends  And the same way she came again aseends  Around his drowsy offspring goes the God  And chuses Morpheus from among the crowd  None can like him a perfect man express  His speech and mien his a  ion and his dress  For he alone in human shape appears  While the less noble forms a second wears  Of snakes or birds of lions or of bears  Still there's a third still meaner in degree  Which shews a field a river or a tree  Of things inanimate presents the scene  Hills valleys ships or houses earth or main  These three to generals kings or courts belong  More vulgar Dreams wait the more vulgar throng  The f  rst of th  se their monarch sets at large  Dispatch'd to Trach  s on Thaumantia's charge  Then staggering he returns and seeks his bed  In whose soft down he sinks his drooping head  Again his eyelids are with sleep opprest  And the whole God dissolves again to rest  Swift as a thought and secret as the night  Morpheus on noiseless pinions takes his flight  His sleeting wings their silent course pursue  Soft as the liquid air they travel'd through  Who now arriv'd laysby his useless plumes  And Ceyx' form in his own court assumes  Naked he stood as late bereav'd of life  Close by the bed of his unhappy wife  His hair still dropping seem'd still wet his beard  Still shivering with the cold all his pale frame appear'd  When with a mournful gesture o'er the bed  Pensively hanging his dejected head  All drown'd in welldissembling tears he said  " Is not your Ceyx wretched woman known  Is he so alter'd or forgot so soon  Turn here Halcyone behold him lost  Or in your Ceyx' stead behold his ghost  To the relentless Gods in vain you pray'd  You are deceiv'd alas and I am dead  Surpriz'd by storms in the Aegean sea  Which cast my life and all my hopes away  Where as I call'd on thy lov'd name my breath  With half thy name pronounc'd was stopt in death  This from no doubtful messenger you hear  'Tis I who tell it I who perish'd there  Arise and weep now let your eyes run o'er  Your oncelov'd Ceyx is alas no more  Let a few tears be to my memory paid  And as you lov'd me living mourn she dead"  He speaks and adds to these his doleful words  A voice she too well knew express'd her lord's  The same the gesture of his hands appears  Unforc'd his action and unfeign'd his tears  She frighted with the vision sighs and weeps  Torn with most mortal anguish as she sleeps  Then stretches out her arms to hold him there  Which came back empty through the yielding air  " Stay stay she cries ah whither would you now  We 'll go together if again you go"  With her own voice and her dead husband's sight  Starting she leaves her dream but not her fright  Awak'd she turns her fearful eyes around  And looks for him who could no more be found  For now her maids rais'd with her shrieks were come  And with their lamps enlighten'd all the room  Not seeing what she sought enrag'd she tare  At once her face her habit and her hair  When ask'd the cause whence such despair should spring  And what sad loss could such distraction bring  She wrings her hands and beats her panting breast  Long silent with a load of sorrow prest  But thus at last her cruel loss confest  " There's no Halcyone ah none she cry'd  With Ceyx dearer than herself she died  Now let no sounds of comfort reach my car  All mention of a future hope forbear  Leave me oh leave me to my just despair  Ah these these eyes my shipwreck'd lord did see  And knew too well it could be none but he  These hands I stretch'd in hopes to make him stay  But from these hands he slid unfelt away  No mo  tal grasp could hold his fleeting ghost  And I a second time my Ceyx lost  He look'd not with the same majestic grace  As when he liv'd nor shone his awful face  With the peculiar glories of his heavenly race  His eyes were fix'd and all their fires gone out  No longer roll'd their sparkling beams about  The colour from his faded cheek was fled  And all his beauty with himself lay dead  Retaining nought of all except the shade  Retaining still though all the rest was gone  Too much alas to make his shadow known  Pale wan and meagre by the bed he stood  His hair still dropping with the briny flood  Here here in this ah this unhappy place  'Twas here he stood"she cry'd and sought to trace  But found no footsteps of his airy pace  " Oh this my too presaging soul divin'd  When you forsook me to pursue the wind  But since compell'd by rigorous Fate you went  And this was destin'd for the sad event  Oh that together we had put to sea  That so with you it might have swallow'd me  Absent I'm lost and ah though not with you  Yet am I wreck'd yet am I ruin'd too  Oh I were sprung from a most savage kind  My soul as barbarous as the seas or wind  If I now you are gone should wish to stay behind  No Ceyx no my muchlov'd lord I come  And though not laid together in a tomb  Though far from mine your floating corse is borne  Nor with my ashes mingled in an urn  Yet on one marble shall our names be told  And the same stone shall both our stories hold  Where ages yet unborn with praise shall read  How I disdain'd to live when you were dead"  Here choak'd with grief she the sad tale gave o'er  Her swelling sorrows would permit no more  Sobs mingling with her words their accents part  And sighs fly faster from her throbbing heart  Now dawns the day when she with fearful haste  Goes to that shore where she had seen him last  There while she stood reflecting on her loss  Forgetting nought that might augment her woes  " Here he took leave she cry'd and here she said  Unwilling to be gone again he staid  He gave me here alas the last embrace  Then launch'd from this ah this unhappy place"  While all that past she labour'd to recall  Severely for herself remembering all  And while around her watery eyes survey  The wavebeat coast and the stilltroubled sea  Something she spies from far come floating on  Though at the first too distant to be known  Which as the tide drove nearer to the coast  Presents a man in a late shipwreck lost  She pities him whom yet she does not know  And mourns his fate since Ceyx perish'd so  Pities his wife if he a wife had left  Like her of all she reckon'd dear bereft  Now floating nearer to the fatal shore  She eyes him more distinctly than before  While all her hopes diminish all her fears grow more  Apace her beating heart begins to pant  And all at once her sinking spirits faint  Now on the beach by tossing billows thrown  The corse was to her sad confusion known  Herself the wife she mourn'd the man her own  " 'Tis he she cry'd my dear my shipwreck'd lord  Whom I but too too justly have deplor'd"  Then with her hands stretch'd to him where he lay  She said what grief would give her leave to say  " Fed with false hopes have I your absence borne  And is it thus ah thus that you return  And do I live and you bereav'd of life  Ah wretched man but more more wretched wife"  Far in the sea a pier erected stood  To break the rapid fury of the flood  Thither almost beyond belief she springs  Borne through the yielding air on newgrown wings  Along the surface of the sea she flies  And wonders at her own unusual cries  Now hovering o'er his pale and bloodless corse  In newfound notes laments her sad divorce  Now stooping perches on his watery face  And gives him with her bill a strange embrace  Whether he felt it or the circling flood  Then chanc'd to move him is not yet allow'd  Yet he took sense from her transporting touch  Ev'n on the dead the force of love is such  Aloft his now reviving head he rears  And m  unts on pinions which resemble hers  Both chang'd to birds their wings together move  A  d  ght remain'd unchang'd except their love  In close embraces as before they join'd  And now o'er seas produce and spread their kind  Seven days she sits upon her floating nest  While each rude blast imprison'd and supprest  Close in its cavern leaves the sea at rest  Then every sail may safely trust the deep  While all the winds lie hush'd the waves asleep

Alike despising infamy and praise  With thee I could myself to work apply  Submit to any toil so thou we  t by  With my own hands my own possessions till  Drive my own herds so thou wert with me still

all his spacious fields nor pleasant house  Nor purling streams can lull him to repose  What foolish brave allow'd by thee to taste  Thy balmy breath to press thy panting breast  Rifle thy sweets and run o'er all thy charms  And melt thy beauties in his burning arms  Would quit the vast delights which thou could'st yield  For all the honours of the dusty field  Let such as he his highpriz'd wars

such a perplexing chain  Which tyrant Love will never loose again  Whether I merit her esteem or scorn  Offending or deserving still I burn  Ah cruel maid these scorching flames remove  Extinguish mine or teach yourself to love  Oh rather than endure the pains I feel  How would I chuse so to shake off my ill  To grow a senseless stone fix'd on a barren hill  Or a bl  ak rock amidst the seas be set  By raging winds and rolling billows beat  For now in torment I support the light  And in worse torment waste the lingering night  My crowding griefs on one another roll  And give no truce to my distracted s  ul  No succour now from sacred verse I find  Nor can their God himself compose my mind  The greedy maid will nought but gold receive  And that alas is none of mine to give  Hence hence unprofitable Muse remove  Hence if you cannot aid me in my love  No battles now my mournful lines recite  I sing not how the Roman legions fight  Nor how the sun performs his daily race  Nor how the moon at night supplies his place  All that I wish the charms of verse may prove  Is for a free access to her I love  For that alone is all my constant care  Be gone ye Muses if ye fail me there  But I by rapine must my gifts procure  Or lie unheard unpitied at her door  Or from the shrines of Gods the trophies bear  And what I rob from Heaven present to her  Treat her at other Goddesses expence and

accurst  Whoe'er began this trade in loving first  Whoe'er made silly Nymphs their value know  Who will not yield without their purchase now  He was the fatal cause of all this ill  And brought up customs we continue still  Hence first the doors of mistresses were barr'd  And howling dogs appointed for their guard  But if you bring the price the mighty rate  At which her beauties by herself are set  The bars unloos'd lay open every door  And ev'n the conscious mastiffs bark no more  Whate'er unwary inconsiderate God  Beauty on mercenary maids bestow'd  How ill to such was the vast present

speak your beauties or applaud my choice  None of their envious praises are desir'd  I would not have the Nymph I love admir'd  He that is wise will not his bliss proclaim  Nor trust it to the lavish tongue of Fame  But a safe silent privacy esteem  Which gives him joys unknown to all but him  To woods and wilds I could with thee remove  Secure of life when once secure of love  To wait on thee could desart paths explore  Where ne'er human footstep trod before  Peace of my soul and charmer of my cares  Thou courage of my heart thou conqueror of my fears  Disposer of my days unerring light  And safe conductress in my darkest night  Thou who alone art all I wish to see  Thou who alone art all the world to me  Should the bright Dames of Heaven the Wives of Gods  To court my bed forsake their blest abodes  With all their charms endeavouring to divert  My fix'd affections and estrange my heart  To thee vain rivals all the train should prove  Vain suit the glorious nymphs to me should move  Who would not change thee for the Queen of Love  All this I swear by all the Powers Divine  But swear by Juno most because she's thine  Fool that I am to let you know your power  On this confession you'll insult the more  In fiercer flames make your poor vassal burn  And treat your suppliant slave with greater scorn  But take it all all that I can confess  And oh believe me that I feel no less  To thee my fate entirely I resign  My love and life and all my soul is thine  You know my cruel Fair you know my pains  And pleas'd and proud you see me drag your chains  But if to Venus I for succour flee  She'll end your tyrant reign and rescue me  A FAREWELL TO POETRY  First printed in "The Monthly Miscellany" February with the following introduction by Mr P Motteux  "An ingenious gentleman seems to bid adieu to his Muse in the following lines but spight of his angry fit I hope that he is too much in love with her to be in earnest"  Mr Hopkins continued to write till within a few hours of his death as will appear by the poem which next follows N    BY THE SAME  AS famish'd men whom pleasing dreams delude  Seem to grow full with their imagin'd food  Appease their hunger and indulge their taste  With fancied dainties while their visions last  Till some rude hand breaks up the flattering scene  Awaken'd with regret they starve again  So the false Muse prepares her vainer feasts  And so she treats her disappointed guests  She promises vast things immortal fame  Vast honour vast applause a deathless name  But well awake we find it all a dream  Soft tales she tells with an enchanting tongue  And lul  s our souls with the bewitching song  How she alone makes heroes truly great  How dead long since she keeps them living yet  Shews her Parnassus like a flowery grove  Fair and delightful as the bowers above  The fittest place for Poetry and Love  We hunt the pleasures through the fairy coast  Till in our fruitless search ourselves are lost  So the great artist drew the lively scene  Where hungry birds snatch'd at the grapes in vain  Tir'd with the chace I give the phantom o'er  And am resolv'd to be deceiv'd no more  Thus the fond youth who long in vain has strove  With the fierce pangs of unsuccessful love  With joy like mine breaks the perplexing chain  Freed by some happy chance from all his pain  With joy like mine he grows himself again  A HYMN BY THE SAME ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IN GREAT PAIN  First printed in "The Student" N    TO thee my God though late at last I turn  Not for my sufferings but my sins I mourn  For all my crimes thy mercy I implore  And to those mercies thou hast shewn before  Add Lord thy grace that I may sin no more  I beg thy goodness to prolong my breath  And give me life but to prepare for death  Pardon O pardon my transgressions past  Lord I repent let my repentance last  Let me again this mortal race begin  Let me live on but not live on to sin  Which if thy heavenly wisdom find unfit  Thy will be done  I humbly do submit  But let thy sovereign mercy bear the sway  Let justice throw the flaming sword away  Or man can ne'er abide the dreadful day  O by the cross and passion of thy Son  Whose sacred death the life of man begun  By that dear blood which our redemption cost  And by the coming of the Holy Ghost  Deliver us amidst the life to come  In the last hour and at the day of doom  AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND  BY MR JOHN HOPKINS  Another son of the good bishop of Londonderry born Jan Like his elder brother his poetry was principally on subjects of Love like him too his prospects in life appear to have terminated unfortunately He published in "The Triumphs of Peace or the Glories of Nassau a pindarie poem occasioned by the conclusion of the peace between the Confederacy and France written at the time of his grace the duke of Ormond's entrance into Dublin"  "The design of this poem the author says in his preface begins after the method of Pindar to one great man and rises to another first touches the duke then celebrates the actions of the king and so returns to the praises of the duke again"  But the principal performance of Mr J Hopkins was "Amasia or the Works of the Muses a collection of poems in three volumes " Each of these little volumes is divided into three books and each book is inscribed to some beautiful patroness amongst whom the dutchess of Grafton stands foremost The last book is inscribed "To the memory of Amasia" whom he addresses throughout these volumes in the character of Sylvius There is a vein of seriousness if not of poetry runs through the whole performance Many of Ovid's stories are very decently imitated  "most of them he says have been very well performed by my brother and published some years since mine were written in another kingdom before I knew of his"  In one of his dedications he tells the lady Olimpia Robartes  "Your ladyship's father the late earl of Radnor when governor of Ireland was the kind patron to mine he raised him to the first steps by which he afterwards ascended to the dignities he bore to those which rendered his labours more conspi  uous and set in a more advantageous light those living merits which now make his memory beloved These and yet greater temporal honours your family heaped on him by making even me in some sort related and allied to you by his intermarriage with your sister the lady Araminta How imprudent a vanity is it in me to boast a father so meritorious how may I be ashamed to prove myself his son by poetry that only qualification he so much excelled in but yet esteemed no excellence I bring but a bad proof of birth laying my claim in that only thing he would not own These are however Madam but the products of immaturer years and riper age may I hope bring forth more solid works"  I have never seen any other of his writings nor have been able to collect any farther particulars of his life but have a portrait of him under his poetical name of Sylvius N    TO you dear youth now banish'd from the swains  Your rural friend in rural notes complains  From my blest groves those longlov'd mansions hurl'd  Urg'd by misfortunes I must view the world  But with as much regret to see it fly  As they to leave it who are doom'd to die  From these dear shades unwillingly I go  As men condemn'd to visit shades below  Since my late ills which will be ever new  Still fresh misfortunes your lost friend pursue  Amasia's fall struck me to deep despair  And now Fate's utmost malice I can bear  Inur'd to storms now let the billows roar  With fullspread sails I'll shun the lazy shore  He who has o  ce been wreck'd  Has f  lt the worst and cannot suffer more  Just o'er my head the breaking clouds have gone  The bolts have struck then sure their fury 's done  I fear no flashes nowlet the heavens thunder on  By grave acquaintance whom the world calls friends  I am advis'd to quit my purpos'd ends  But now long planted in the Muses land  I can no other language understand  All worldly gains beyond my reach must prove  For I am bent on Poetry and Love  Should frowning Heaven its usual storms abate  Which I can't think without a wrong to Fate  My joys would grow as now my sorrows great  But should no fortunes no success attend  The bold aspiring fondness of your friend  Trust me no disappointment shall I find  Nor be deceiv'd unless the Gods grow kind  In vain you move me with your charming strain  And tell of fancy'd generous nymphs in vain  The British beauties sure have noble souls  But still 'tis gold 'tis gold my friend controls  No charming Fair will hear the suppliant sue  Who sp  aks not golden words'tis gold must woe  And all despair who want it allbut you  Oh should s  me beauty in her heavenly bloom  To the embraces of your Sylvius come  Some bright dear maid fram'd of a nobler mould  Who scorns to sell her charms for sordid gold  Above her sex's meanest pride and generously bold  Blest by our nuptials sure we both should grow  I though the husband still the lover too  A mistress so divine should be for ever so  My loftiest Muse should sing her matchless fame  The fires of Love should yield my fancy flame  She should for ever live  Nam'd my Amasia and adorn the name  Give my respects to those few friends we know  To those few friends whom I found always so  My real service and chief thoughts commend  Who serves no mistress best can serve his friend  Borne on m  Muse's wings I haste to you  Leave these low vales and glory's heights pursue  Adieu my friend  Adieu dear shades adieu  TO THE LORD CUTTS  Of whom see p N    BY THE SAME    LET some with servile mean devices bow  And bend their souls as well as bodies low  Flatter the great cringe deep to gain esteem  And by their own dishono  r honour them  By wiles like these new  ours poorly claim  I pay your Lordship but what 's paid by fame  'Tis through your merits not my own I choose  Thus to salute you by my rising Muse  Not fawning low like others must she sue  She must fly up to pay respect to you  Let others spread their patrons feathers far  The toys of peace your laurels spread through war  Some pride in wreaths which bolder arms have made  But your own conquering hands have deckt your head  To you my Lord a double crown is due  At once the Hero and the Poet too  Since Nassau's actions still remain untold  While Dryden lives immortal yet he's old  'Tis you we hope will make them far ador'd  And serve him with your pen as well as sword  Beyond his trumpet's clangors make them known  Name Nassau's acts and all must know your own  With powers unequal I the task resign  A task too great for any strengthbut thine  What other genius can our Sovereign choose  War's your delight Bellona is your Muse  Your pen and sword with like success you wield  Fam'd through your study glorious through the field  With the same vigour and impulse of thought  Now may you write as through the plains you fought  In the attempt though my weak genius fail  Be pleas'd at least to recommend my zeal  Unknown this favour dare I humbly claim  Unknown to you my Lord unknown to fame  I like those soldiers which in war you led  Disdain to fear while I have you my head  Your wellrais'd greatness my success secures  I grow assur'd of fame by trusting yours  Great both in arts and arms our Jove in you  Secures his lightning and his thunder too  Thus should your judgment my presumption blame  Pleas'd shall this Semele expire in flame  To you my Lord most fit this suit I move  You who are plac'd at the right hand of Jove  SONG  BY LORD CUTTS  A soldier of most hardy bravery in king William's wars He was son of Richard Cutts esq of Matching in Essex where the family were settled about the time of Henry the sixth and had a great estate He entered early into the service of the duke of Monmouth was aiddecamp to the Duke of Lorrain in Hungary and signalized himself in a very extraordinary manner at the taking of Buda by the Imperialists in which important place had been for near a century and a half in the hands of the Turks Mr Addison in a Latin poem worthy of the Augustan age Musae Anglicanae Vol II p plainly hints at Mr Cutts's distinguished bravery at that siege Returning to England at the Revolution he had a regiment of foot was created Baron of Gowran in Ireland Dec appointed Governor of the Isle of Wight April was made a Majorgeneral and when the assassination project was discovered was captain of the King's guard He was Colonel of the Coldstream or second regiment of guards in when Mr Steele who was indebted to his interest for a military commission inscribed to him his first work "The Christian Hero" On the Accession of Queen Anne he was made a Lieutenantgeneral of the forces in Holland Commander in Chief of the forces in Ireland under the Duke of Ormond March and afterwards one of the Lords Justices of that kingdom to keep him out of the way of action a circumstance which broke his heart He died at Dublin Jan and is buried there in the cathedral of Christ Church He wrote a poem on the Death of Q Mary which is printed among the Court Poems and published in "Poetical Exercises written upon several occasions and dedicated to her royal highness Mary princess of Orange licensed March Roger L'Estrange" It contains besides the dedication signed J Cutts verses to that princess a poem on wisdom another to Mr Waller on his commending it seven more copies of verses one of them called "La Muse Cavalier" which has been ascribed to Lord Peterborough and as such mentioned by Mr Walpole in the list of that nobleman's writings and eleven songs the whole composing but a very thin volume which is by no means so scarce as Mr Walpole supposes it to be The author speaks of having more pieces by him N    ONLY tell her that I love  Leave the rest to Her and Fate  Some kind planet from above  May perhaps her pity move  Lovers on their stars must wait  Only tell her that I love  Why oh why should I despair  Mercy's pictur'd in her eye  If she once vouchsafe to hear  Welcome Hope and welcome Fear  She's too good to let me die  Why oh why should I despair  ELEGY ON THE EARL OF ROCHESTER  BY MRS WHARTON  See some particular of this lady vol I p And see in the English Poets vol VIII p Mr Waller's verses on the Elegy here printed and in p another copy on Mrs Wharton's "Paraphrase on the Lord's Prayer" His two cantos of Divine Poesy p were "occasioned upon sight of the d chapter of Isaiah turned into verse "by Mrs Wharton" Her "Verses to Mr Waller" are mentioned by Ballard and her translation of "Penelope to Ulysses" is printed in Tonson's edition of Ovid's Epistles In she was in France on account of her health as appears from several letters to her husband about she held a correspondence by letters with Dr Gilbert Burnet many of which are made public Dr Burnet wrote several poems which he sent her She died at Adderbury Oct and was buried at Winchenden N    DEEP waters silent roll so grief like mine  Tears never can relieve nor words define  Stop then stop your vain source weak springs of grief  Let tears flow from their eyes whom tears relieve  They from their heads shew the light trouble there  Could my heart weep its sorrows 'twould declare  When drops of blood my heart thou'st lost thy pride  The cause of all thy hopes and fears thy guide  He would have led thee right in Wisdom's way  And 'twas thy fault whene'er thou went'st astray  And since thou stray'd'st when guided and led on  Thou wilt be surely lost now left alone  It is thy Elegy I write not his  He lives immortal and in highest bliss  But thou art dead alas my heart thou'rt dead  He lives that lovely soul for ever fled  But thou 'mongst crowds on earth art buried  Great was thy loss which thou canst ne'er express  Nor was th' insensible dull nation's less  He civiliz'd the rude and taught the young  Made fools grow wise such artful magic hung  Upon his useful kind instructing tongue  His lively wit was of himself a part  Not as in other men the work of art  For though his learning like his wit was great  Yet sure all learning came below his wit  As God's immediate gifts are better far  Than those we borrow from our likeness here  He wasbut I want words and ne'er can tell  Yet this I know he did mankind excell  He was what no man ever was before  Nor can indulgent nature give us more  For to make him she exhausted all her store  AGAINST THE FEAR OF DEATH  BY SIR ROBERT HOWARD  Of whom see vol I p N    SINCE all must certainly to death resign  Why should we make it dreadful or repine  How vain is fear where nothing can prevent  The loss which he that loses can't lament  The fear of Death is by our folly brought  We fly th' acquaintance of it in a thought  From something into nothing is a change  Grown terrible by making it so strange  We always should remember Death is sure  What grows familiar most we best endure  For life and death succeed like night and day  And neither gives increase nor brings decay  No more or less by what takes birth or dies  And the same mass the teeming world supplies  From death we rose to life 'tis but the same  Through life again to pass from whence we came  With shame we see our passions can prevail  Where reason certainty and virtue fail  Honour that empty name can death despise  Scorn'd Love to Death as to a refuge flies  And sorrow waits for death with longing eyes  Hope triumphs o'er the thought of Death and Fate  Cheats fools and flatters the unfortunate  Perhaps deceiv'd by lustsupplying wealth  Nowenjoy'd pleasures and a present health  We fear to lose what a small time must waste  Till life itself grows the disease at  ast  Begging for life we beg for more decay  And to be long a dying only pray  No just and temperate thought can tell us why  We should fear death or grieve for them that die  The time we leave behind is ours no more  Nor our concern than time that was before  'Twere a fond sight if those that stay behind  For the same passage waiting for a wind  To drive them to their port should on the shore  Lamenting stand for those that went before  We all must pass through Death's dead sea of night  To reach the haven of eternal light  A PARAPHRASE FROM THE FRENCH  This poem has been ascribed to Mr Prior N    IN greyhair'd Celia's wither'd arms  As mighty Lewis lay  She cry'd "If I have any charms  My dearest let's away  For you my love is all my fear  Hark how the drums do rattle  Alas sir what should you do here  In dreadful day of battle  Let little Orange stay and fight  For danger's his diversion  The wise will think you in the right  Not to expose your person  Nor vex your thoughts how to repair  The ruins of your glory  You ought to leave so mean a care  To those who pen your story  Are not Boileau and Corneille paid  For panegyric writing  They know how heroes may be made  Without the help of fighting  When foes too saucily approach  'Tis best to leave them fairly  Put six good horses in your coach  And carry me to Marly  Let Bouflers to secure your fame  Go take some town or buy it  Whilst you great sir at Nostredame  Te Deum sing in quiet"
