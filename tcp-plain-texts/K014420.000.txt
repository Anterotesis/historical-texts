 THE WELCH HEIRESS A  COMEDY  London  PRINTED FOR RICHARD WHITE NO PICCADILLY    TO THE EARL OF HARCOURT  As I have attempted to write a Comedy at the flattering instigation of your Lordship the following scenes have a natural claim to your protection If when you prompted and encouraged me to court the Comic Muse you had imparted to me at the same time some share of your instinctive penetration into character of your elegant but impres∣sive ridicule of fashionable levitieshad you consigned to my hand the clue that guides you in the chace and detection of folly through the intricate windings of her labyrinth I should have presented to you a Comedy more worthy of your attention Such as it is it offers me an opportunity of publickly ac∣knowledging the high value I set upon a friendship which I have had the happiness of enjoying so many years  I have the honor to be Your most obedient Humble Servant EDWARD JERNINGHAM  PROLOGUE  TO THE WELCH HEIRESS  WRITTEN BY JOHN TAYLOR ESQ  Spoken by Mr Barrymore  "SHOOT Folly as it flies" Such is the game  At which 'tis said the Comic Muse should aim  The darker passions that the heart deform  And spread o'er groaning states the moral storm  Are pompous themes the sportive Maid resigns  To swell her solemn Sister's lofty lines  Yet when she fain would strike such tow'ring prey  The serious Damsel takes the safest way  Tho' proud yet prudentwounding guilt too high  To wake in you the selfreproaching sigh  In sluggish apathy you careless sit  Nor smart for crimes that you could ne'er commit  But in the comic province who shall dare  To touch the faults that you may haply share  For conscience then may strengthen the appeal  And bid you crush what forces her to feel  For Virtue zealous and disdaining awe  E'en fear'd by those too mighty for the law  The Stage through ev'ry station Vice has try'd  And honest Satire has her lash applied  Hence while the Comic Muse must fear to wound  She still is doom'd to course o'er beaten ground  Again bring forward what too well you know  Or if a novelty some monster shew  Tonight our Bard who long has struck the lyre  A modest minstrel of the plaintive choir  Attempts for once a harmless laugh to raise  More dreading censure than presuming praise  One point we fairly in his cause may plead  For know he dares to touch the scribbling breed  Dares strip from dull conceit its bold pretence  And prove an Author may be void of sense  Then let your candour countenance the grace  That freely owns the follies of his race  And sure our Bard e'en Malice need not fear  Could Malice lurk in specious ambush  here    E'en she may yield her pittance of applause  To him whose vent'rous pen a brother draws  For while thus sportive on a scribbling elf  Our simple Poet may deride himself  The following Lines written by the Rev Mr PRITCHARD Jun before he knew the Author was in possession of another Pro∣logue contain too much Merit to be sup∣pressed  THERE liv'd at Argos once a youth of fame  So Horace tells and Lycas was his name  Who if there is a joy which mad men know  And such as madness only can bestow  By the strong force of its prevailing pow'r  Wak'd to fresh transport ev'ry newborn hour  Each visionary scene that fancy drew  His mind embodied and confirm'd it true  Oft in the height of his distemper's rage  He saw or fancy'd that he saw a stage  Where as he heard the selfimagin'd sound  And trod or thought he trod dramatic ground  Where with nice skill in imitative art  Each son of Thespis seem'd to play his part  The fond conceit drew down his loud applause  As tho' reality had been the cause  And ev'ry member head hands lips and eyes  Profess'd their praise and testified surprize  If such the charm where fancy gave delight  Let truth not fiction plead our cause tonight  And as I come to take a nearer view  Pleading for him who strives to pleasure you  Oh may propitious Beauty  To the Boxes  smile reward  May Science  To the Pit  favour and the Gods  To the Galleries  regard  Sons of renown the bards of ancient days  Wore on their heads a circling crown of bays  These bloom eternal for to them belong  The grace the pride the energies of song  The tale welltold the animated line  The glow of sentiment and thought divine  Yet still there blossoms many a virgin flow'r  On the fair spot where Genius rears her bow'r  Of these our bard presents before your view  One of a simple but unsully'd hue  Should the mild off'ring kind acceptance share  Tis your's to weave the crown and his to wear  CHARACTERS  LORD MELCOURT  MR PALMER  MR FASHION  MR BARRYMORE  SIR PEPPER PLIN∣LIMMON  MR DODD  MR PHRENSY  MR BANNISTER JUN  MR FANCY  MR R PALMER  LADY BELLAIR  MISS FARREN  LADY PLINLIMMON  MISS POPE  MISS PLINLIMMON  MRS JORDAN  SCENEMELCOURTHALL near Town  THE WELCH HEIRESS  A COMEDY  ACT I  Enter Lady  BELLAIR  Mr  FASHION  Mr  FASHION  I AM happy at your Ladyship's arrival We ex∣pected you last night  Lady Bellair  I purposely avoided coming last night that I might not be complicated in the em∣barrassment of the Welch family's arrival whom I understand came yesterday What sort of crea∣tures are they How many did the caravan consist of I expect to see the whole race of Shenkin  Mr Fash  Do not be alarmed as to their num∣ber I will give your Ladyship a list of the  dra∣matis personae  and a faint sketch of their characters  Lady B  Pray do for I have seen nobody not even my brother the  padrone della casa  Mr Fash  Lord Melcourt I know is walked out I was just enquiring after him But to return to the subjectYesterday evening the family coach covered with dust and much damaged by the toil and length of the journey waddled up to  the halldoor in great labour and was happily de∣livered of Sir Pepper Plinlimmon Lady Plinlim∣mon Miss Plinlimmon and a  femme de chambre  two servants attended on Welch ponies The coach I must inform you contained originally five persons but it miscarried on the road of Mr Taffey their chaplain who could not bear the in∣side of a carriage He is however expected to∣morrow in the basket of some stagecoach  Lady B  I fancy we shall be able to do without Mr Taffey  Mr Fash  Indeed you are mistaken He is one of the essential personages in our drama for he is to join the hands of Lord Melcourt and Miss Plinlimmon  Lady B  What sort of a thing is the girl  Mr Fash  She is very well as to beauty her shape elegantly and harmoniously formed but when in motion ungraceful Her mind is a com∣pound of ignorance and information like the waving branches that give a checquered kind of light She made us laugh last night at supper with the childish simplicity of her questions and sometimes she excited our admiration at the quickness of her repartee and the solidity of her judgment in a word she appears to be an inspired ideot  Lady B  Now let me have the portrait of Sir Pepper  Mr Fash  Sir Pepper is a plain unassuming man subject at times to a warmth of temper and whose local train of impoverished ideas are quite unsuitable to the scene he is now entering upon and to the company with which he is now to asso∣sociate His mind has received a peculiar biass respecting the prophecies that have been floating of late and he is almost convinced the world will be at an end before his daughter has brought Lord Melcourt a son and heir  Lady B  I confess I like the whimsicallity of that notion it will serve to amuse us  Mr Fash  As for Lady Plinlimmon she has a considerable share of vanity half of which she spends in admiration of her daughterinlaw the other she consumes upon herself She imagines she has a refined taste for literature that she is a supreme judge of painting and  Lady B  Oh then she is intolerable  Mr Fash  By no means There is a broad goodhumour about her which makes her inoffensive She looks with impatience for the honour of ce∣menting an acquaintance with your Ladyship  Lady B  I think from your description it will not be unentertaining to pass a day or two with these Welch Emigrants But does my brother seem happy at his approaching nuptials  Mr Fash  Yesterday he seemed at first over∣come by the invasion of these Vandals but his native mirth rallied and at the close of the evening he was himself again But here he comes  Enter Lord  MELCOURT  Lord Mel  Sister you are welcome You look in high beauty The elegant circles in town will be eclipsed without you Have you seen our new kindred  Lady B  Not yet Mr Fashion has been giv∣ing me a slight sketch of them  Lord Mel  Well I am ready to consign Sir Pepper and Lady Plinlimmon to the full dis∣charge of your raillery but spare I intreat you my shepherdess of the Alps  Lady B  Never fear never fear  Lord Mel  Lady Plinlimmon looks for your arrival with all the flutter of anxious expectation Your fame like an artful prologue has smoothed  the way to a kind reception she talks of you as the paragon of excellence she will study your whole person observe every motion attitude and every article of your dress  Mr Fash  Lady Bellair may be said to be a capital picture from the gallery of fashion for Lady Plinlimmon to copy  Lady B  I will venture to say without the im∣peachment of vanity that the copy will not come up to the merit of the original  Mr Fash  Your Ladyship is perfectly right  Lady B  But tell me brother don't you feel independent of the charms of your young bride an uncommon elasticity of mind in the removal of the incumbrances which this marriage will effect  Lord Mel  Yes Upon that ground I plant the standard of my gaudiest streamer I have had a private conference with Sir Pepper and his im∣mediate relinquishing of his Brecknockshire estate will enable me to part with my Irish acres and satisfy all my noisy claimants who like a vora∣cious pack of hounds have chaced me from hill to dale and notwithstanding the windings of excuses and the intricate mazes of delay would have soon overtaken me had not this golden shower from the Welch mountains put an end to the chace  Lady B  Bravo Are we to expect any more company  Lord Mel  I have invited my friend Fancy the miniaturepainter I expect also Phrensy the poet whom you have often heard me talk of he will suit Lady Plinlimmon and their mutual ec∣centricities will divert us  Mr Fash  I am glad that oddity will be added to the group you have frequently amused me with anecdotes concerning him When will he be here  Lord Mel  I expect him every minute He writes word he will be here today but begs his  coming may be a secret and as he is not person∣nally known to any body but myself he desires to assume the name of Tombstone  Mr Fash  What a whim What can he mean  Lord M  Most likely he is afraid of his cre∣ditorshowever do not betray him to the rest of our society But here come our Welch relatives    Enter Sir  PEPPER PLINLIMMON  Lady  PLIN∣LIMMON  and Miss  PLINLIMMON  Give me leave to present Lady Bellair to your Ladyship  Lady Plin  Independent of the connection that is taking place between our families I rejoice at the opportunity that now offers of commencing an acquaintance with Lady Bellair  Lady B  Your Ladyship does me a great deal of honour I hope Sir Pepper you will like this part of the world sufficiently to engage you to stay among us some time  Lady Plin  What ease What elegance  Aside  Sir P Plin  I should wish to enjoy your Lady∣ship's society but I am rather disposed to return as soon as I can for if as Nostradamus says we are in the fifth act I should like to be at home when the curtain drops  Lady Plin  Dear Sir Pepper do not cloud the splendour of Lady Bellair's mind with the dark mists of your odious prophecies  Lady B  I beg your Ladyship will let Sir Pepper say what he chooses I am not easily alarm∣ed credulity is not my foible But this is a con∣versation of too severe a cast for our young bride you my dear may send your expecting eye through a long and gay perspective  Miss P  So I do I expect to have fine cloaths to go to a great many balls and I expect to be married  Sir P Plin  Your Ladyship will exuse the wild simplicity of my daughter  Lady B  Oh I am a great admirer of artless simplicity it is as rare to be met with as sincerity  Lady Plin  When she has exchanged the rude breezes of the mountain where she was bred for the gentler gales of polished society she will assimi∣late with the soft elegance of her new situation  Mr Fash  Lady Bellair herself could not have invented a metaphor more happily allusive  Sir P Plin  My wife is very metaphoricall  Miss Plin  Yes we all have our different  calls  mamma is metaphoricallpapa is propheticall I am comicallthe old curate near Plinlimmon Castle is classicall and his wife is dropsicall  Lady Plin  You must check this careless volu∣bility  Lord Mel  Suppose gentlemen we leave the ladies to confer by themselves Will you allow me Sir Pepper to shew you the Vandyke I men∣tioned last night  Sir P Plin  If you please  Exeunt Sir  PEPPER  Mr  FASHION  Lord  MELCOURT  Lady Plin  I should wish your Ladyship not to be impressed with an idea that my daughterinlaw is deficient in the great outline of education though she has not yet received the last touchings of embellishment I myself have been her tuto∣ress and have read to her several of the best En∣glish authors  Miss Plin  And all the Welch poets  Lady B  I am persuaded Miss Plinlimmon is deficient in nothing that is absolutely requisite for the station she is going to ascend as for those de∣licate finishings that fashionable elegance de∣mands  Lady Plin  Your Ladyship's society will supply I consign this young Alpine plant to your care 'tis yours to give the pliant branches their proper direction and to breathe on them a playful air of easy negligence With your permission I will now  withdraw for the purpose of my girls imbibing from your Ladyship those nameless graces you only can bestow  Exit Lady  PLINLIMMON  Miss Plin  What are those things mamma says you are to bestow upon me  Lady B  My friendship And you in return must have some friendship for me and speak to me with confidence upon every point that relates to your marriage with my brother By what he has said to me I find he is extremely attached to you I hope his attachment will meet with an equal return on your part  Miss Plin  That is as it may be  Lady B  I am sure Lord Melcourt is reckoned by all the ladies very handsome amiable enter∣taining and  Miss Plin  I know all that and I should be very partial to him if  Lady B  If what my dear  Miss Plin  If  Lady B  Has he done any thing to offend you  Miss Plin  No but he has done nothing to please me  Lady B  Does he appear to neglect you I re∣collect he was uncommonly assiduous in writing to you last winter  Miss Plin  Oh yes he frequently wrote to me and he used to say in his letters that when I should come to Melcourt Hall we should wander through the groves together and he would say such tender things to me by the riverside Now we were by the riverside yesterday evening and scarce one word did he say to me but conversed with my papa about the winding of his river egad I wish it was wound round his neck  Lady B  Fie child You must not imagine that Lord Melcourt's attention is to be totally devoted to you  Miss Plin  Am I then not to expect any share of his conversation Is there to be no time for wooing no flirtation no whispering no toying no innocent anticipation  Lady B  Miss Plinlimmon the manufacturing of love in Wales may perhaps be as coarse as a sackcloth but in this part of the world the cupids of fashion weave the fine texture with a light and invisible hand  Miss Plin  Invisible indeed But if I am never to partake of his company what am I come here for what shall I be the better for being married to him where is the advantage  Lady B  You will obtain the advantage of his name and title you will move in a higher sphere  Miss Plin  But I always understood that wed∣lock was a kind of travelling through life toge∣ther  Lady B  So it is but then it is like travelling in the double stagecoach you go the same jour∣ney together without seeing or incommoding one another  Miss Plin  I hate the double stagecoach I like a visavis much better However if Lord Mel∣court does not become more assiduous he may be supplantedFashion is much more attentive  Enter Lord  MELCOURT  Lord Mel  I ask pardon for interrupting you but the odd character I spoke of is arrived he begs to see me in private he is now coming  Lady B  We will retire immediately  Exeunt Lady  BELLAIR  and Miss  PLINLIMMON  Enter servantannounces Mr  TOMBSTONE  Enter Mr  PHRENSY  Mr Phrensy  Your servantI am obliged to you for your invitationI have an epithalamium for the occasion shall I read it  Lord Mel  All in good time tell me first why you assume another name  Mr Phrensy  You shall hear but do not betray me  Lord Mel  You may rely upon me  Mr Phrensy  Shall not I read the epithalamium first  Lord Mel  No no I am impatient for your history  Mr Phrensy  Well you shall hear itbut I am certain you will be pleased with the epithala∣mium  Lord Mel  I have no doubt but let me know the secret motive of your changing your name before we are interrupted  Mr Phrensy  Do you think your servants will know me  Lord Mel  I have an entire new set  Mr Phrensy  That makes me happy  Lord Mel  Was it the fear of your creditors  Mr Phrensy  No such terrestrial motive urged me to assume another name this liberty I have taken with myself flows from a more sublime cause than the apprehension of bailiffs I will now disclose the mysteryunless you choose to hear the epithalamium first  Lord Mel  Do not trifle any longer but let me know the purport of this mysterious conduct  Mr Phrensy  Envy which attends living au∣thors has pursued me with great implacability  Lord Mel  I do not recollect that I ever heard your works censured  Mr Phrensy  Likely enoughcensure would have excited noticenotice would have led to observationobservation to justicejustice to admirationno no Envy my Lord took another method with me she some how or other contriv∣ed to breathe over me and my works a dread repose The warehouse where my productions are deposited resembles a family vault where all my numerous progeny are at rest And are only distinguished from one another by labelssuch as Phrensy's comediesPhrensy's tragediesPhren∣sy's satiresPhrensy's  Lord Mel  But what has all this to do with the changing of your name  Mr Phrensy  I am now coming to the mark my friends have soothed me with the idea that posterity will do me justicethat posterity will say to these sleepers arise Then will my comedies my tragedies my odes shake off their dust and dazzle the admiring world  Lord Mel  What is all this to the purpose  Mr Phrensy  You shall hearinstead of pati∣ently waiting the natural process of time I con∣ceived a stratagem of anticipating my triumphs and of taking a short cut to posterity  Lord Mel  How do you meanby cutting your throat  Mr Phrensy  'Tis done 'tis done  Lord Mel  What's done  Mr Phrensy  I have killed myself that is to say I have given out that I am dead This is the reason for changing my nameenvy was never played such a trick before  Lord Mel  But why take the melancholy name of Tombstone  Mr Phrensy  That is to keep me in recollec∣tion that I am dead  Lord Mel  There is sense in that  Mr Phrensy  But this stratagem my Lord has not yet answered my sanguine expectation  Lord Mel  How so  Mr Phrensy  I have been three weeks dead and would you believe that there has not been in any of the papers an elegy a posthumous puff or a line in my commendation  Lord Mel  That is very strange  Mr Phrensy  Egad A tallowchandler might have slipt out of the world as easily as I have done  Lord Mel  How did you insert your death in the papers for it escaped my notice  Mr Phrensy  Simply thusyesterday died universally lamented the eminent poet Classical Phrensy Esq  Lord Mel  To be sure nothing could be more simple and modestbut I have an idea that I think will serve your scheme betterI will have it inserted in the papers and you shall draw up the paragraph to this purposeyesterday the emi∣nent poet Classical Phrensy Esq died suddenly at MelcourtHall where he was upon a visit to his friend Lord Melcourt  Mr Phrensy  Very goodexcellent concep∣tion  Lord Mel  The circumstance of making your exit at my countryhouse during the interesting moment of my nuptials will give your death an eclat  Mr Phrensy  This second edition of my death with additions will do admirably faith but what will your company say when they shall read the paragraph  Lord Mel  I shall take particular care that none of them shall see it  Mr Phrensy  But what does your Lordship smile at  Lord Mel  Another idea occurs which will serve to enrich the paragraph  Mr Phrensy  As how  Lord Mel  Fancy the miniaturepainter will be here to dayI shall tell him as a profound secret that you lie dead in the house and that it is unknown to the companyand I will beg of him as you are my friend to take a faint sketch of you  Mr Phrensy  This will as your Lordship says enrich the paragraph which may run thusMr Phrensy being the intimate friend of Lord Mel∣court an eminent painter from town was sent for to take a likeness of the great poet  Lord Mel  Admirable You have only to whiten your face and make yourself like a ghost in an opera the painter shall only peep at you and then finish the sketch from memorytrust to my contri∣vance you shall not be detected  Mr Phrensy  I will go and prepare the para∣graph  Phrensy going returns  your Lordship then does not wish to hear the epithalamium first  Lord Mel  No no I expect the painter every minute    Exit Mr  PHRENSY  Self conceit good humourwith absurdity are happily blend∣ed in that man's composition  Enter  SERVANT  Servant  Mr Fancy is arrived  Lord Mel  Bid him come in  Enter Mr  FANCY  Mr Fancy  I wish your Lordship joy I flatter myself you have not sent for me to be an idle spectatorI hope I shall have the honor of draw∣ing the bride  Lord Mel  Most assuredlythe art suffers when you are idle  Mr Fancy  Have you assembled many of your friends upon this occasion  Lord Mel  NoLady Bellair is come and Mr Fashion and a literary acquaintance of mine Mr Tombstone  Mr Fancy  I never heard of his name  Lord Mel  He has lived a great deal abroad he is lately returned from Africa I had another ingenious man here and he was my particular friend but a sudden death has deprived me of that invaluable person what I am going to relate is a secret nobody is acquainted with the terrible accident except a confidential servant Poor Phrensy the poet died suddenly last night he is now in the house and is to be removed this even∣ing I should be happy to have a resemblance of my old friend and if you would have the good∣ness to take a hasty sketch of him you would in∣finitely oblige me  Mr Fancy  I can have no objection  Lord Mel  Let all this transaction be as secret as the grave  Mr Fancy  You may depend upon me  Enter Mr  PHRENSY  with a paper  Mr Phrensy  Here is the paragraph for your inspection  Lord Mel  taking the paper  I shall look at it another time Let me have the satisfaction of in∣troducing two gentlemen to one another who are formed for each other's acquaintance Mr Tomb∣stone let me present you to Mr Fancy I must now beg permission to leave you together I shall return in a few moments  Exit Lord  MELCOURT  Mr Fancy  I am happy in commencing an ac∣quaintance with so ingenious a gentleman I should be proud to draw your portrait  Mr Phrensy  Smiling  You shall Mr Fancy I suppose the bride is to be embellished by your pencil  Mr Fancy  Of course But Lord Melcourt did not send for me merely to paint the young lady  Mr Phrensy  Your pencil will undoubtedly run through the whole family  Mr Fancy  Likely enough But I have another meaning I am sent forI am sure Mr Tomb∣stone may be trusted and as the first fruits of my friendship for you I will deposit in your breast a profound secret  Mr Phrensy  I will in return communicate to you the first secret that is whispered in my ear  Mr Fancy  I have then to inform you that there is a person lies dead in the house and Lord Melcourt has begged I would just catch a resem∣blance of his departed friend  Mr Phrensy  Who is it  Mr Fancy  Phrensy the poet  Mr Phrensy  Indeed Is that great and unri∣valled man no more  Mr Fancy  You are too magnificent in the epi∣thets you apply to Mr Phrensy  Mr Phrensy  By no means Reflect what an awful task is now imposed upon you Methinks I  see you advance with sublime emotion towards the honoured couch that bears the breathless image of that immortal man  Mr Fancy  But whence this enthusiasm After all it must be confessed that the friendship of Lord Melcourt was the highest feather in his cap  Mr Phrensy  Talk not to me of feather or of cap His head was encircled with laurel wove by the public hand For shame Mr Fancy is it thus you revere the illustrious dead  Mr Fancy  Don't be so warm Mr Tomb∣stone I am perhaps a little ungenerous in speak∣ing against the dead who cannot defend them∣selves but tell me dispassionately do you admire poor Phrensy's writings  Mr Phrensy  I do I know them by heart have you a mind to hear the sixteenth scene of his tragicomedy in six acts where the princess catches her  Mr Fancy  No no I will not give you the trouble of repeating your friend's verses  Mr Phrensy  My friend's verses you say right yes my intimate friend he never wrote a line without consulting me  Mr Fancy  But if he was so dear a friend how comes it you are not more affected by his death  Mr Phrensy  I am astonished stunned bewil∣dered at the dreadful secret you disclosed When the first impression is subsided grief will succeed Lord Melcourt out of affection for me secreted the melancholy event but I begin to feel myself overpowered  goes aside with his handkerchief to his eyes  Enter Lord  MELCOURT  Lord Mel  What is the matter with Mr Tomb∣stone  Mr Fancy  Inadvertantly I informed him of the death of Mr Phrensy not knowing the inti∣macy that subsisted between them  Lord Mel  How could you be so imprudent  goes up to Mr Phrensy  Dear Tombstone do not yield to this inordinate affliction  Mr Phrensy  How can I command my grief  throws his arms round Lord Melcourt's neck  Lord Mel  I take no inconsiderable share in your distress  Mr Phrensy  Undoubtedly you do in loosing Mr Phrensy you lose your panegyristthink how often he has regaled your Lordship with the thickest cream of dedication  Lord Mel  Forbear to remind me you affect me too much  Mr Fancy  What a situation I am in I thought I was invited to the abode of festivity instead of which I am come into the house of mourning I had better return to town  Lord Mel  By no means When this mutual sympathetic emotion is over we shall return to our former mirth  Mr Fancy  Your Lordship appeared very easy and jocund just now  Lord Mel  You then saw me during the inter∣vals of the first and second paroxism of grief  Mr Fancy  Is then your Lordship's affliction methodised into acts like a play with pauses be∣tween the divisions  Lord Mel  Indeed Mr Fancy this is not a mo∣ment for raillery let me entreat you to leave us we shall be more composed presently  Mr Fancy  Well I will obey your commands  Exit  Lord  MELCOURT  and Mr  PHRENSY  burst into laughing  Lord Mel  We shall have still more entertain∣ment with the painter when he has drawn your picture  Mr Phrensy  I am impatient for that scene I will go and prepare myself  Lord Mel  My valet de chambre who has my instructions and who is in our confidence will assist and furnish you with whatever is necessary for the purpose I must now join the company  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  Lord  MELCOURT  Mr  FANCY  with a pallet in his handa couch at some distance on which Mr  PHRENSY  lies disguised as dead  Lord Mel  Shall we now approach the venera∣ble remains of the great man  Mr Fancy  Give me leave to mingle my co∣lours a little  Lord Mel  I am afraid the task I have imposed upon you is unpleasant you feel I make no doubt very disagreeable sensations upon this occa∣sion  Mr Fancy  Not in the least a lifeless frame does not impress me with any disturbance I drew Lady Fidget's dead monkey the other day without any kind of perturbation  Lord Mel  But Mr Fancy do you make no dis∣tinction between Lady Fidget's dead monkey and the remains of my friend  Mr Fancy  As he was your friend I respect him but does your Lordship really think he is worthy of those encomiums that you and Mr Tombstone so profusely bestowed upon him  Lord Mel  My partiality may perhaps cast a little suffusion over my judgment But tell me do  you not venerate his memory Do you not ad∣mire his works  Mr Fancy  Perhaps as much as your Lordship 'tis impossible with so refined an understanding as yours to receive any entertainment from his writ∣ings the characters in his plays for example may be compared to the incongruities that we meet with on signposts things that never existed in nature such as blue boars black swans dragons and mermaidsI never felt a more pleasing invi∣tation to a slumber than I did at his last comedy which unfortunately I did not enjoy long for I was roused by a thousand catcalls    Mr  PHRENSY  starts up from the couch    Mr Phrensy  'Tis false 'tis false no catcall was heard at my comedy though I am dead I am not damned  Mr Fancy  Recovering from his fright  I per∣ceive it was a trick  Mr Phrensy  Trick or no trick my works will live when the memory of lady Fidget her monkey and yourself will be swept from the face of the earthbase calumniator  Lord Mel  I beg I may be the negociator of peace between the living and the dead in the first place I can assure Mr Fancy no indignity was meant to himMr Phrensy for particular rea∣sons having given out that he was dead I thought a portrait of the author by a celebrated painter would add lustre to the posthumous edition of his works  Mr Fancy  The I forgive him  Runs to embrace him  Mr Phrensy  But tell me first how can I for∣give the scurrilous observations you so liberally bestowed upon my compositions  Lord Mel  Dear Phrensy you do not imagine that the painter was in earnestflatter him a little  aside to Fancy  Mr Fancy  I hope I am not so destitute of taste So far from sleeping at your comedy I dis∣turbed the boxes with my peals of laughter  Mr Phrensy  Give me your hand  Mr Fancy  Then the parts were so chequered with sentimental and pathetic passages  Mr Phrensy  Excuse me there was nothing pathetic in my comedy nor any thing like senti∣ment  Mr Fancy  I only mean in the winding up of your comedy where the butcher's daughter kneels  Mr Phrensy  My dear Sir you are speaking of my tragedy  Lord Mel  Phrensy you must excuse him Fancy's mind has not yet recovered from the confusion your sudden bursting from the dead occasioned You had better retire and relapse into Tombstone  Mr Phrensy  I will follow your direction and as you Mr Fancy are acquainted with my secret historylet us for the future be friends  Exit Mr  PHRENSY  Mr Fancy  Now we are aloneI must de∣clare you was rather too hard upon me in expos∣ing me as you did to the indignation of the en∣raged poet  Lord Mel  I only intended a little innocent sport I did not think he would have rushed upon us so rudely it was his irritability in hearing him∣self abused that made him rise from the dead  Mr Fancy  Then it was my own doing for the abuse was all mine I must now prepare to draw the living the ladies I believe are now wait∣ing for me  Lord Mel  I will follow you  Exit Mr  FANCY  Enter Mr  FASHION  Lord Mel  I wish Fashion you had been here sometime agowe had an excellent scene be∣tween the painter and the dead poetthe painter was almost in an hysteric  Mr Fashion  I think these two characters will afford us still more entertainment  Lord Mel  I hope sofor I want something to draw off my attention and to prevent me from fixing too steady an eye upon this bride of mine I shall be ashamed to introduce her among my acquaintance next winter  Mr Fash  Do not be under any apprehension the instructions of Lady Bellair Mrs Townlife and Lady Angelica Worthless will refine the rude simplicity of your wild mountaingirl  Lord Mel  Though I have a high opinion of those able modern professors I am inclined to think this Welch girl will baffle all their skill she will never through them as through filtering stones divest herself of the heterogeneous matter the heavy particles the nauseous lees she has im∣bibed from her country education from the man∣ners of Sir Pepper and from the vulgarity of the motherinlawno no 'tis impossible  Mr Fash  I ask your pardonwhen she has been decanted off into polished society she will leave the dregs behind  Lord Mel  I wish it may be soI must now look for the painter who is going to draw the portrait of my bride elect  Mr Fash  I will not detain you  Exeunt  SCENE  The Saloon Lady Plinlimmon Miss Plinlimmon  Lady Plin  I beg you will put on your best looks and sit patiently to the painter that Lord Mel∣court may have a good resemblance of you  Miss Plin  What does he want my picture for will he not see me morning noon and night 'tis not likely he should forget my face or is it to hang me in effigy in case I should run away from him  Lady Plin  It is usual for the bride to present her portrait to the bridegroom so I beg you will make no difficulty about it  Enter Lord  MELCOURT  and  Mr FANCY  Mr Fancy  I hope I do not intrude upon your Ladyship  Lady Plin  By no means  Mr Fancy  This is the hour your Ladyship ap∣pointed and I confess I am impatient to commence the flattering task but to do justice to the charms of that young lady no pencil can have the pre∣sumption  Miss Plin  The painter I find mamma says finer things than the lover  Lord Mel  It is part of his profession to talk the language of bombast and inordinate adulation It becomes my situation to shew respect a delicate reserve a genuine but not an importunate attach∣ment a calm not a tempestuous solicitude in one word a silent adoration  Miss Plin  Silent enough egad I believe your adoration has a lock jaw  Lady Plin  Fie child don't talk so ridiculously pray Mr Fancy in what costume shall my daughter be drawn  Mr Fancy  Perhaps Miss Plinlimmon will point out herself what character she prefers  Miss Plin  I hope Mr Fancy will give my  face a good character for it has done no harm  Mr Fancy  I ask your pardon it has done a great deal of harm but if my opinion was consul∣ted I should recommend to Miss Plinlimmon to be painted in the attitude of reading  Miss Plin  I should like to be drawn reading for I know I have a pretty downcast look  Lady Plin  I must not forget to inform you that all the females of the Plinlimmon's have had a fa∣mily mole a little above the left eye for these two centuries Now Isabella's is too complicated with the eyebrow perchance you can make some slight alteration  Mr Fancy  By the omnipotence of the pen∣cil we can raise the beauty spot and place it in view  Lord Mel  But is not that departing from rea∣lity is it not a deceit a kind of pencil lie  Mr Fancy  It is only changing the local resem∣blance it is at the worst a skilful and elegant inac∣curacy the beautyspot is there I make no ad∣dition to what nature has already done I only bring to the eye of admiration what her Lady∣ship informs me nature has rather removed from the sight  Lady Plin  I declare Mr Fancy you defend yourself most ingeniously does he not my Lord  Lord Mel  Most skilfully indeed  Mr Fancy  I have taken a much greater licence than this without feeling any reproach of consci∣ence for example when I had the honor of draw∣ing Lady Frizlerump I broke the immeasurable length of her bald buff forehead by introducing two moles and a patch the patch you know is a thing ad libitum and as I knew Lady Frizlerump had a mole on each shoulder I removed them from their native spot they were well worth the carriage and I placed them in a more conspicuous situation there is no great deceit in this it is only  a kind of transplanting which ought to be as al∣lowable in painting as in gardening  Lord Mel  Well ladies you perceive how sportfully Mr Fancy discourses he has a mind to give you a specimen of his manner of entertaining his company when they are sitting to him  Lady Plin  But I think before we come to any determination about the dress it would be proper to consult the attic taste of Lady Bellair  Mr Fancy  Most assuredly you may shew her these miniatures which I have lately finished This is the portrait of Miss Harelip  gives the miniatures  which attracted the public eye the last exhibition This is only a profile of Miss Woolsack the Judge's daughter  Lady Plin  I will not detain you any longer at present  M Fancy  I will wait upon your Ladyship whenever you will favour me with your commands  Exit  Mr FANCY  Miss Plin  But why does your Lordship with so much to have my picture since I am to live with you do you want me duplicated don't you think one Miss Plinlimmon will be enough for you  Lord Melcourt  The mutual exchange of pic∣tures is one of the etiquettes of modern marriages  Lady Plin  Marriage itself may be said to be a mutual exchange of attention Indulgence and affection  Miss Plin  In this mutual exchange pray my Lord inform me which of us two will be the gainer  Lord Mel  If there is any calculation to be made I am undoubtedly the gainer  Miss Plin  give me leave to calculate my losses in marrying your Lordship I lose my nameI lose the society of papa and mammaI shall per∣haps lose my shapeand perhaps in time lose my reputation  Lady Plin  Peace to that flippant tongue of yours you are trying his Lordship's patience be∣fore the time A I must carry these miniatures to Lady Bellair your Lordship will excuse my leav∣ing youIsabella go to your papa  Exeunt Lady  PLINLIMMON  and Miss  PLINLIMMON  Lord Mel  Heaven and earth What a family am I going to be connected with But I must not pause upon that thought it would almost lead me to distraction  Exit Lord  MELCOURT  SCENE  Lady  BELLAIR'S  Apartment  Lady  BELLAIR  Lady  PLINLIMMON  Lady Bell  Here is a miniature of myself which was drawn when I was married I think the dress would suit Miss Plinlimmon  Lady Plin  Taking the miniature  'Tis beau∣tiful nor could it be otherwise while it presumed to have any resemblance of your Ladyshipbut you just now mentioned your marriage I know that you and Lord Bellair were separated not long after interested as I am in whatever re∣lates to your Ladyship do not imagine it is mere curiosity that solicits some illustration upon that point  Lady Bell  I am ready to give you every infor∣mation and the more so as illnature that mono∣tonous and dull commentator may have construed our separation in her invariable manner  Lady Plin  I am all attention  Lady Bell  Lord Bellair somewhat advanced in years palled and satiated with the pleasures of the town began to medicate a retreat but before he retired into the country from which he was never  to return he ranged through all the gay scenes of public resort to find a youthful associate to accompany him in his retirement  Lady Plin  Your mysterious history begins to unfold itself the beauteous flower that flourished in the bright sunshine of admiration grew pale and cheerless when it was transplanted to the soli∣tary gloom of the country  Lady B  I must confess your Ladyship's ex∣temporary apologue comprises my little story and makes my continuation unnecessary  Lady Plin  Not at allI beg you will continue your interesting narrative  Lady B  Lord Bellair amidst the innumerable beauties that at once attracted and bewildered his choice threw at length his selecting glance upon me  Lady Plin  His choice did honor to his taste  Lady B  It did not however contribute to his happinessthe single voice of my reluctance was lost in the chorus of approbation that resounded from all my relations and friendsI then sum∣moned all the fortitude I was capable of and took a courageous leave of the townadieu I cried to the flattery of mento the pleasing envy of the womenadieu to ballsadieu to the delight of charioteering in a phaeton through St James's Street every morningadieu to the easy instruc∣tions of the town to the contemplation of man∣ners in caracatureshops to the reading of Shakespear upon canvass and to the study of the English history upon wallsthe fatal hour arrived the carriage was at the door  Lady Plin  You really excite my compassion What ensued when you reached the ancient fa∣mily seat  Lady B  Say rather the family vaultI wrapt myself up in my resignation as in a winding sheet and thought to have buried myself in a husband  the fates decreed otherwise I broke forth from the ponderous marble beneath which I was quiet∣ly inurned and am come again to reside among the living  Lady Plin  The world is a considerable gainer be enjoying you once more Fortunate was the storm that blew such a flower upon the lap of so∣ciety But whence arose that storm Did it arise from Lord Bellair's illtemper however I am not curious indeed I can partly guess the soli∣tude of the country faintly checquered by the vi∣sits of the apothecary and the vicar's wife his Lordship's fulsome fondnesshis odious approaches  Lady B  My dear Lady Plinlimmon you are going on so rapidly It is of no use to reckon the slight imperceptible threads of discontent which grew at length into a cable Behold me restored to independence sufficiently affluent and almost as happy as a widow  Lady Plin  May nothing interrupt the happiness you possess and which you deserve Before I had the honour of your acquaintance I heard your merits highly extolled  Lady B  I am exceedingly obliged to those per∣sons who have smoothed my path to your Lady∣ship's partiality But to whom am I indebted  Lady Plin  The persons I allude to are friends of your Ladyship and are neighbours of our's in Wales they were in town last winter I mean Mrs Vandal and her sister  Lady B  Yes I recollect those old tapestry figures But you must not imagine there was any intimacy between us I endured them at my toilet They may be reckoned if you please among my morning friends but you may be sure I never ac∣knowledged the creatures in an evening  Lady Plin  That is charming I shall acquire  under your auspices the fashionable discriminations The morning and evening friend is a happy dis∣tinction But I fear I am trespassing upon your time  Offering to go  Lady B  I will wait upon you immediately With your permission I will send to the company to assemble in your bookroom where we will fix upon the plan of this evening's amusement  Exit Lady  PLINLIMMON  SCENE  BookRoom  Enter Lord  MELCOURT  Mr  PHRENSY  Lord Mel  We will wait till Lady Plinlimmon comes as she wishes extremely to commence a literary acquaintance with you  Mr Phrensy  She is comely faith I do not dislike her person  Lord Mel  She is the Ruben's style  Mr Phrensy  I hear her coming  Enter Lady  PLINLIMMON  Lady Plin  I hope gentlemen you have not been here long I feel myself peculiarly distin∣guished in the desire I understand you expressed of forming an acquaintance with me A man of your talents is not to be met with in every house  Mr  PHRENSY  bows very low  Lord Mel  That bow says more than a pompous train of words  Lady Plin  I am not insensible to its eloquence it flatters me as much as a dedication Pray sir are you engaged in any work at present  Mr Phrensy  I am only superintending a new  edition of the works of a dear friend whom I have lately lostthe immortal Classical Phrensy  Lord Mel  While Mr Tombstone is expatiating on the merits of his departed friend I will call upon Sir Pepper and return in a few minutes  Lady Plin  Pray do and bring Sir Pepper and Isabella along with you the company is to rendezvous here  Exit Lord  MELCOURT  In∣deed sir it is very amiable in you to suppress the effusions of your own powers to attend to the in∣terest of another  Mr Phrensy  It is not so much attending to the interest of my friend as it is consulting the interest of the nation while I am preparing this noble edi∣tion of his works for the general delight  Lady Plin  But I have been so unfortunate as never to hear of Phrensy's name  Mr Phrensy  What never heard of Classical Phrensy Esq  Lady Plin  No I protest I never heard his name till you pronounced it  Mr Phrensy  Let me tell you Lady Plinlim∣mon if the rays of his genius have not pierced the dense atmosphere of Wales that invelopes your mountains  Lady Plin  Mr Tombstone you alarm me I had no idea of degrading you friend I will pro∣mote the subscription among all my acquaintance and do every thing in my power to atone for my seeming disrespect  Mr Phrensy  I am calm again but you will ex∣cuse a little warmth in favour of a person who is as dear to me as myself We were inseparable we never differed upon the smallest point if one spoke the other listened if one slept the other nodded  Lady Plin  Ah such a friendship is seldom to be found I can assure you sir the warmth that  just now broke from you has only served to exalt me in your esteem and as a proof of what I am saying I beg I may lay the cornerstone of our acquaintance with this little brilliant  Gives him a ring  Mr Phrensy  This generosity subdues me  Lady Plin  Let the ring be as a passport to this apartment at all times And when you are at leisure I should wish to take some lessons of bo∣tany under your direction Lord Melcourt in∣forms me that every science is within the range of your mind  Mr Phrensy  I shall be happy in obeying your commands  Lady Plin  You think sir that botany is a pro∣per occupation for a female mind  Mr Phrensy  Nothing so proper Give me leave to cite a couplet composed by my lamented friend applicable to this subject It is a happy couplet he sent it to Lady Nightshade who is well versed in the loves of the plants it runs thus  Delightful emblem of her softer power  A woman's proper study is a flower  Lady Plin  Exquisite couplet What a great man your friend was  Mr Phrensy  The confidence you place in me this little twinkling monitor of your kindness your affability every thing prompts inclines urges commands compels me to undeceive you  Lady Plin  To undeceive me What can you mean Mr Tombstone  Mr Phrensy  I am not Mr Tombstone it is an assumed name a veil to cover me for certain purposes  Lady Plin  What purposes Who are you  Mr Phrensy  Bursting from my concealment  like Aeneas from his cloud know that I am Clas∣sical Phrensy 'Tis Phrensy speaks 'tis Phrensy kneels 'tis Phrensy's lips now touch this hand  Lady Plin  I did really imagine you was some great personage in disguise But explain the mys∣tery of all this  Mr Phrensy  Envy and her train have of late carried on so atrocious a war against me that I have been persuaded to sham a retreat and give out that I am dead  Lady Plin  Excellent idea  Mr Phrensy  In the mean time I am collecting subscriptions and shall return triumphantly to life under the cover of a superb edition of all my works  Lady Plin  I comprehend you perfectly and am delighted with the confidence you repose in me  Mr Phrensy  The family Mr Fashion the painter who is my particular friend are the only persons in the world who are intrusted with this lite∣rary secret  Lady Plin  I shall be as silent as Helicon  Mr Phrensy  The Heliconian stream is apt to babble it would be more accurate to say as silent as Lethe  Enter Sir  PEPPER  Miss  PLINLIMMON  Lord  MEL∣COURT  and Mr  FASHION  Lady Plin  This is the gentleman Sir Pepper whom Lord Melcourt speaks so highly of  Sir P Plin  I am Mr Tombstone's most obe∣dient My wife is fond of literature you will find her versed in some of the best authors She is fond of conversing with the dead or to speak more properly with the living dead  Mr Phrensy  Her Ladyship was conversing with the living dead when you entered  Lady Plin  And I must add a favourite author  Sir P Plin  Is your Lordship determined to set out for Ireland as soon as the ceremony is over  Lord Mel  The reason that compels me to leave you so soon is the business I have there which de∣mands immediate dispatch  Sir P Plin  I am surprised Mr Conscience the lawyer is not yet come with the writings  Lord Mel  He will certainly be here today  Miss Plin  What matters whether or no the lawyer comes I wish poor Taffey we left on the road was arrived for it is the parson who speaks the prologue to Love's play  Mr Fash  Aptly observed but the nuptial play Miss Plinlimmon is sometimes a tragico∣medy the dialogue frequently uncouth vehe∣ment and boisterous What do you think your's will be  Miss Plin  Oh our's will be a gay farce of three acts  Enter Lady  BELLAIR  Lady B  Now we are all assembled let the master of the ceremonies instruct us what we are to do  Lord Mel  The carriages are at the door sup∣pose we take an airing through the park and lounge at the different buildings  Lady B  Let me be mistress of the revels for this evening We will imagine the phaetons are triumphal cars and they shall convey us to the temple of Mars where Mr Tombstone shall read to the company his new translation of the Battle of the Frogs  Lady Plin  Excellent I love analogy  Lady B  And as your Ladyship is fond of ana∣logy we will take some whipt syllabub in the pavi∣lion of friendship and regale ourselves with icecreams in the temple of Hymen  Mr Fash  A little severe I think  Lord Mel  "Where more is meant then meets the ear"  Offering his hand to Miss  PLINLIMMON  Exeunt  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE  The Temple of Hymen The Company eating IceCreams  Sir  PEPPER PLINLIMMON  Miss  PLINLIMMON  Lord  MELCOURT  Mr  FASHION  and Lady  BELLAIR  Sir P Plin  I think my Lord this Temple of Hymen the most beautiful building in your park  Mr Fash  This ice is excellent  Miss Plin  Cold food for the Temple of Hy∣men  Mr Fash  'Tis not the only food  Miss Plin  You mean bread and cheese and kisses  Lord Mel  I beg Lady Bellair you will check your cicisbeo Mr Fashion and not let him liber∣tinise with my Diana  Lady B  What pretence can I have to restrain him Fashion is like the air a chartered libertine free to play with every flower  Miss Plin  Egad he shan't play with me tho'  Lady B  Tell me my dear why did your mamma leave us so abruptly  Miss Plin  Mamma I fancy has had enough of the Temple of Hymen  Sir P Plin  Your Ladyship perceives this spoil∣ed child has the liberty of saying what she pleases My wife is gone with her ingenious friend to study botany  Lady B  I should be sorry to constrain her Ladyship  Sir P Plin  Be so good as to inform me who fancied these decorations Are they indebted to the hand of any foreign artist  Lord Mel  There is no occasion to apply to foreign auxiliaries for the purposes of elegant artthe native growth of our soil amply supplies the demands of taste in every department  Sir P Plin  This relievo is happily executed come here Isabella you understand mythology Here is hymen attended by a group of cupids Do you conceive the allegoric meaning of the artist  Miss Plin  Perfectly Here is Hymen with a torch in his hand that is I suppose to light the bride and bridegroom home And the dear little cupids I suppose foretell the children  Sir P Plin  Ridiculous You pervert every thing by your distorted applications But explain the remainderyou see night personated follow∣ing Hymen she throws o'er her frame a mantle studded with stars and among the stars appears a crescent  Miss Plin  The mantle studded with stars de∣signates the holy stillness and unruffled union of the marriage state  Sir P Plin  Very well indeed  Miss Plin  And the crescent denotes the honey∣moon  Sir P Plin  There you relapse into your absur∣dity  Mr Fash  Miss Plinlimmon will perhaps do me the honor to explain this compartment here is Hymen binding a shepherd and a shep∣herdess with a chain of flowers  Miss Plin  It is your turn now you shall explain this  Mr Fash  Upon my word I think this a most excellent allegory and illustrates well the short triumph of matrimonythe chain of roses is easily broken and the roses soon fade  Lord Mel  Fashion speaks the language of an inveterate batchelor yet every thing in nature condemns his sarcasm the birds that make this grove reecho with their harmony what are all their songs but so many hymns in honor of the married state  Mr Fash  I ask your pardon Lord Melcourt The economy of your grove will not assist your argument in defence of Hymen for every fea∣thered couple who were so happy the last spring are now divorced and all the harmony and love which now reign in your woods is the result of separation and of new engagements  Lord Mel  Truce to your licentious insinuations to purify the temple that has been so profaned I entreat Miss Plinlimmon to favor us with the song in honor of Hymen with which she enchanted the company last night  Miss Plin  I am ready to comply with your re∣quest  Sir P Plin  With your Ladyship's permission I will go and look for the botanists  Lady B  He is positively jealous  aside  Indeed Sir Pepper you must not go till you have heard the song  Sir P Plin  I am all obedience  The SONG by Miss  PLINLIMMON  I  Oh young affection's glowing train  By mutual fond endearment won  At Hymen's altar claim the chain  That twines two willing hearts in one  II  Have ye not seen in Flora's bower  Two roses on one stem respire  So form'd by passion's blending power  Two hearts are thron'd on one desire  Sir P Plin  I presume I have now your Lady∣ship's leave to wait upon the botanists  Mr Fash  Sir Pepper you will only interrupt the scholar in the study of naturethe eminent professor under whom Lady Plinlimmon is now acquiring a new science would wish not to be deranged  Sir P Plin  Very likelynevertheless I shall make them a visit  Lady B  We will accompany you to the house  Exeunt omnes  SCENE  BookRoom  Lady  PLINLIMMON  and Mr  PHRENSY  at a table covered with plants and flowers  Lady Plin  What a wonderful system have you brought me acquainted with I never could have conceived there were such astonishing things in nature as male and female flowers  Mr Phrensy  I have most assuredly let your Ladyship a little into Flora's secrets  Lady Plin  Male and female flowers I am pe∣trified But tell me learned professor when the flowers are at a distance from one another how they communicate their mutual passion  Mr Phrensy  There nature interposes her happiest stratagem She calls her western gales her amo∣rous zephyrs and they on heir fragrant wings convey the lovers to each other  Lady Plin  Now Sir as you have led me as it were behind the curtain into Flora's greenroom I confess I am not much edified at the morals of the plants Indeed the flowers appear to be an abandoned profligate racehere is a honey suckle which you say contains five males and only one femalethis modest snowdrop you tell me has six husbands  Mr Phrensy  Indeed nature has been rather partial to your sex in her economy of plants  Lady Plin  Poor things What a pity it is they are not endowed with sensibility  Mr Phrensy  I have observed since the ladies of fashion have applied to the study of botany they are not only ambitious of rivaling the flowers in beauty but they have also endeavoured in some degree to rival them in their other prerogatives  Lady Plin  Take care Mr Phrensy you are  growing censorious    Enter Sir  PEPPER PLIN∣LIMMON  You cannot imagine Sir Pepper how delighted I am with the beautiful and sublime science of botany  Sir P Plin  Indeed  Lady Plin  This learned gentleman has raised as it were the veil of nature and has revealed to me some of her secrets and I must own secrets that excite my astonishment According to the illus∣trations of this learned professor the chalice of every flower is a kind of a house of bad fame  Sir P Plin  ironically  Then a lady of your unspotted virtue ought to shrink as the sensitiveplant from a study that presents to you nothing but scenes of immorality  Lady Plin  There can be no harm in gratifying a literary curiosity But I assure you Sir Pepper I shall be apt to think it is not extremely decent to wear a nosegay  Sir P Plin  If you would read the delightful poem of the Loves of the Plants you need not give this gentleman any further trouble At pre∣sent I must take the liberty of desiring him to leave us alone as I have something to communicate to you in private  Mr Phrensy  I obey your commands In our next lecture we will expatiate on the dews that re∣fresh the flowers at night  Exit Mr  PHRENSY  Lady Plin  Well Sir Pepper what have you to communicate Nothing I presume very entertain∣ing  Sir P Plin  You now receive a positive order not to admit that literary fop any more into your study  Lady Plin  What Sir Pepper When the ray of knowlege begins to dawn must it expire at your uncreating word  Sir P Plin  Your Ladyship's metaphorical ex∣pressions  have no effect upon me and give me leave to observe that I have always found you refrac∣tory and uncomplying with any requests  Lady Plin  How can you be so unjust Where is the wife throughout Wales that is more com∣placent Did I ever refuse to comply with a re∣quest of yours from January to January Indeed Sir Pepper I might complain of the very few in∣dulgences you ever granted me  Sir P Plin  Dare you complain of my want of indulgence when there is not a whim that I have not always been ready to indulge you in When the gardening parson from England came to us last year did I not submit to have the front of my old forest cicatrised into clumbs like large pies Did he not fling a confining belt as he called it round my place As if he thought the hills vales and woods were going to run away Did I not let him to please you zig zag the avenue in such a manner that I could hardly find the way to my own house  Lady Plin  You must allow that Plinlimmon Castle wanted a touch of the modern bard  Sir P Plin  Then I was obliged to endure his perpetual panegyric upon himself How he was admitted to all the great tables in town How he chose a picture for this Lordand a fan for that Lady  Lady Plin  However his visit was not long he stayed with us but a little month  Sir P Plin  If it had not been for the death of the french cook he would have been at Plin∣limmon Castle at this moment  Lady Plin  Do you choose to put my patience to any further trial  Sir P Plin  Recall if you please the physician from the north who came a practisehunting into wales did he not come twice a day to the  Castle to brace your nerves was not this another indulgence There you passed day after day lan∣guishing on a sopha Then the room for sooth was darkened As you could endure only a kind of twilight which you called  a jour doux  then I was never to be admitted because I spoke so loud  Lady B  The doctor said you was too boister∣ous Sir Pepper for the chamber of a valetudina∣rian notwithstanding your incredulity concerning the bad state of my nerves at that time I can assure you that it was to the sopha and to the doctor that I owe  Sir P Plin  More than you will choose to allow  Lady Plin  Don't be scurrilous Sir Pepper  Sir P Plin  Then there was the fencible colo∣nel but I have done Let me only entreat you not to complain any more of my not granting you any indulgences Zounds madam the Pope at Rome could not have granted you more indul∣gences than I have But no more I have only to beg of you to stay here till I return with some papers for you to sign and which Lord Melcourt and Mr Fashion are to witness  Exit Sir  PEPPER PLINLIMMON  Lady Plin  Never was a person of delicate feel∣ings so thrown away as I was when I consented to be the wife of Sir Pepper  Enter Mr  PHRENSY  Mr Phrensy  I watched Sir Pepper out I heard him go along the gallery muttering as if he was much displeased I am afraid he has been endeavouring to ruffle your angelic temper  Lady Plin  He has absolutely imposed his com∣mands upon me not to receive your visits  Mr Phrensy  I rejoice to hear it  Lady Plin  What do you mean Mr Phrensy  Mr Phrensy  Prohibition like a glass of bitters stimulates the appetite and awakens our partiali∣ties I dare say I now appear more amiable to your Ladyship than I did before  Lady Plin  I confess at least your presumption does not offend me but I am sorry to inform you that you must not stay with me at present Sir Pepper is returning immediately and Lord Mel∣court and Mr Fashion are coming with him  Mr Phrensy  They cannot be here so soon Mr Fashion was just now in earnest conversation with Lady Bellair in the long cathedral arbor and Lord Melcourt was  Lady Plin  You are mistakenfor I hear them coming What can be done It is too late to escapeyou must not take refuge in the bedchamber my blabbing maid is thereconceal yourself behind this curtain  Lets down the curtain that hangs over the bookshelves  Mr Phrensy  Peeping from behind the curtain  I cannot at least want entertainment where there are so many books  Lady Plin  How can you be jocular now You see the agitation I am in  Enter Sir  PEPPER PLINLIMMON  Lord  MELCOURT  and Mr  FASHION  Sir P Plin  These gentlemen will have the goodness to be witnesses to your signing this paper  Lord Mel  How does your Ladyship proceed in the study of botany  Lady Plin  At the desire of Sir Pepper I have laid aside the thoughts of botany for the present  Lord Mel  It is a pity your Ladyship should not avail yourself of the advantage of being under the same roof with so eminent a professor  Mr Fash  A person of your Ladyship's abili∣ties would have made a rapid progress under so skilful a director he has a way of bringing his scholars forward in a very short time  Sir P Plin  He has the way of bringing him∣self forward in a very short time Be so good as to sign your name  Offering the paper  You keep these Gentlemen waiting  Mr Fash  I am sure we have nothing better to do than converse with this learned Lady  Lady Plin  You are very obliging but I will not any longer intrude on your time  She writes her nameThen Lord  MEL∣COURT  and Mr  FASHION  sign  Mr Fash  Pray Lord Melcourt have you a Virgil on those shelves behind the curtain Tombstone and I had a dispute about a passage in the fourth book  Lord Mel  No That is a mere lady's library nothing but modernsI ran up a few shelves and furnished them with some everyday volumes for the convenience of any lady who might oc∣cupy these apartments  Lady Plin  Mr Fashion there may be a Vir∣gil behind the curtain but not the Virgil you mean  Mr Fash  You allude to the translation no that will not do I want to consult the original  Lady Plin  Then you must have recourse to the library below  Lord Mel  But why does your Ladyship drop that curtain over the books  Lady Plin  I found it hanging and I make it a rule to leave things exactly as I find them  Sir P Plin  The curtain my dear I think was up just now when I was with you  Lady Plin  Was it my dear I do not recol∣lect very true it was Te sun played so pow∣erfully upon the books I was afraid it would tar∣nish the beautiful bindings so I dropt the cur∣tain  Mr Fash  I love beautiful bindings and typo∣graphical luxury Pray let me be favoured with the sight of the books  Lady Plin  Not worth your inspectiona mere female library and authors for women  Lord Mel  Allow me to indulge Fashion's cu∣riosity As for the sun's spoiling the books it matters not when the bindings are the worse for wear the books may have new bindings a wellbound book is not like a lady's reputation which once soiled can never    Draws up the cur∣taindiscovers Mr  PHRENSY  There was in∣deed a Virgil behind the curtain  Mr Fash  An author for a lady  Lord Mel  But not so well bound as Fashion expected  Mr Phrensy  Gentlemen you may laugh if you please but we enterprising fellows are now and then exposed to these untoward discoveries They are inevitable incidents in the comedy of life This is an incident  Sir P Plin  Arrogant pedant If this was not Lord Melcourt's house my cane would chastise your insolence  Lady Plin  I assure my dear this gentleman had received my commands not to enter these apart∣ments any more at that instant I heard you re∣turning  Mr Phrensy  And to save you from an object so disagreeable as myself I secreted myself behind that curtain  Sir P Plin  Daring wretch what is it you mean Do you presume to make the personal at∣tractions  of that lady the object of your bold pre∣tensions  Lady Plin  Well Sir Pepper since we are among friends I give you my word that if ever I could be persuaded to deviate from the path of de∣corum and make a little  faux pas  it should not be with a literary person  Mr Fash  Your Ladyship is perfectly right The literary heroes are not renowned in the an∣nals of gallantry a bookworm is a poor harmless creature without a sting  Sir P Plin  What you say Mr Fashion is sen∣sible and judicious I have heard it observed that a lieutenant of the guards is more formidable to a married man than the whole body of the anti∣quarian society Mr Tombstone will excuse the warmth I was just now surprised into  Mr Phrensy  Pray do not mention it Your prohibition with regard to my coming to this apart∣ment shall be strictly obeyed and I shall for the future look for the honour of your Ladyship's so∣ciety only in the drawingroom which you know is a neutral apartment and accessible to every part of the family  Sir P Plin  Gentlemen your obedient I must return with these papers  Exit  Lord Mel  Well this scene has ended much bet∣ter than I expected The storm would have fallen heavy upon Tombstone had it not been for your Ladyship's happy sarcasm upon the gallantry of the learned  Mr Phrensy  Your Lordship need not call me Tombstone her Ladyship knows my story there is nothing respecting myself that is a secret to her Ladyship  Lord Mel  I am glad to hear it But I must beg leave to absent myself I hope your Ladyship will excuse me  Lady Plin  But why will your Lordship deprive us of your company  Lord Mel  Consider Madam I am at the eve of being marriedmy mind is so fullI have so many things to think of  Mr Phrensy  What can your Lordship have to think of every thing flows so smoothly to your wishesyou have no more occasion to think than a translator  Mr Fash  No more he has and I could un∣dertake to prove that his Lordship is a kind of a translator himself and even a translator into va∣rious languages  Lord Mel  How do you make that out  Mr Fash  I have seen you sometimes in liquor and then you translate yourself into a beast  Mr Phrensy  Very good  Mr Fash  You will soon be married and then you will translate yourself into another kind of ani∣mal  Mr Phrensy  You mistake that will not be his own doing  Mr Fash  Very true some intimate friend will do that translation for him  Lord Mel  Will not your Ladyship take my part against these profane batchelors  Lady Plin  The arrows these gentlemen shoot are not dipt in gall  Lord Mel  Nor are their points very keen But I must be going  Lady Plin  As the party is breaking up sup∣pose Mr Phrensy you attend me to the neutral apartment▪ as you ingeniously term it  Mr Phrensy  I am at your command  Offers his handExit with Lady  PLINLIMMON  Lord Mel  There go two the most ridiculous personages  Mr Fash  And the best suited to one another  Lord Mel  I wish my future bride and I were half as well adapted to one another  Mr Fash  What Melcourt do you feel fainthearted  Lord Mel  Faith I do The whimsicality of the different persons under this roof has occasion∣ed some laughing which has served to divert my attention from the main object But when my thoughts rest upon my approaching nuptials my mind shrinks from its purpose  Mr Fash  Oh this is nothing but a vapour fit a qualm before matrimony it will pass away  Lord Mel  Never never  Mr Fash  She is handsomevery rich  Lord Mel  Did she possess all the barbaric gold of the city it would not atone for her deficiencies in other respects  Mr Fash  What do you call deficiencies The little rusticities of her homebred education will disappear in time she will catch the tone of the stage she is entering upon the continual action of surrounding example in higher life will wear away her peculiarities and she will insensibly glide into the general mass  Lord Mel  You are calm and philosophic but I cannot be cooled and philosophised into the ap∣proval of what I am sensible is not strictly honour∣able which is leading and as it were betraying a young woman to the altar for whom I entertain no passion no preference no esteem  Mr Fash  Your good nature will prompt you to treat her with civility her simplicity will ex∣plain your politeness into love and the torrent of amusements in town will prevent her prying into your private pleasureground  Lord Mel  Fashion you talk it well but I do protest if I could be prevailed upon to marry this young woman disliking her as I do I should feel  an internal degradation that would poison all my days  Mr Fash  What can be done it is too late to recede the Welch Family will be in an uproar  Lord Mel  I have a schemea lucky thought occurred this morning I think I have hit upon a method of escaping from the chains I have been forging for myself and in preparing the girl for the event I shall contrive to soften her disappoint∣ment by a kind of innocent imposition which will make her believe that the breaking off the intended marriage is her own act  Mr Fash  This is at once generous and hu∣mane to ward off the point that would wound her pardonable vanity in the expectation of being Lady Melcourt But what is your plan  Lord Mel  That I will communicate to you in a more private place and if my stratagem should not succeed I must then have recourse to your su∣perior invention  Exeunt  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  Miss Plin  Reading aloud  "Oh happy state when souls each other draw"    Enter Lord  MEL∣COURT  Your calling upon me when I am alone is very kind I am now convinced your Lord∣ship has a great regard for me  Lord Mel  May I take the liberty of asking what book has the honor of engaging your atten∣tion  Miss Plin  I have been dressing my expectation with love verses  Reads  "For thee the spouse prepares the bridal ring  "For thee white virgins hymeneals sing"  But what makes you look so grave when you are so near being a bridegroom A little bird sung in my ear that tomorrow is to be the happy day and I suppose your Lordship is come to inform me of the happy tidings  Lord Mel  No indeed I did not come for that purpose I came with another view  Miss Plin  I hope it will not rain tomorrow there must not be a speck of a cloud in the skies on our wedding day  Lord Mel  I must beg your serious attention to  what I have to say to you  Takes a chair offers her one they sit  If I seem a little embarrassed you will have the goodness to excuse me I think it my duty to inform you that when I was last abroad I had the misfortune of being introduced to a young Nun who gained my affections and though that accomplished woman is no more  Miss Plin  If she is no more I have nothing to apprehend for with all her want of accomplish∣ments Isabella Plinlimmon must be superior to a dead Nun  Lord Mel  'Tis not only that  Miss Plin  Your Lordship did not fall in love with the whole convent  Lord Mel  No no when I lost my Constantia my warm affections flew to her tomb  Miss Plin  And when your warm affections have caught cold at her tomb they will fly back again  Lord Mel  Never never with her they have taken up their everlasting residence  Miss Plin  Well let them you and I will make new affections  Lord Mel  Aside  Nothing will do she is de∣termined to have me  Miss Plin  What does your Lordship say  Lord Mel  I am afraid Miss Plinlimmon there are other objectionable circumstances relative to myself with all the appearance of affability and condescension I can assure you that I am most vehemently passionate  Miss Plin  Matrimony will cure that vice I have heard my mamma say that marriage is a great tamer  Lord Mel  I have also the misfortune of walk∣ing in my sleep and I get out of the window and walk upon the roof of the house  Miss Plin  As long as you do not insist upon my walking with you I do not call that an objec∣tionable circumstance and when you are tired of  imhaling the night breezes from the top of the house you will find me overjoyed to receive you at your return  Lord Mel  Rising from his chair  I see Miss Plinlimmon you make a jest of what my delicate feelings prompt me to reveal to you  Miss Plin  Rising  Quite the reverse your candour endears you the more to me and to re∣turn you an equivalent of candour and unreserve on my part I will unfold to your Lordship a secret though I am unwilling to disclose it  Lord Mel  Well what have you to communi∣cate  Miss Plin  'Tis what you would have found out if I did not reveal it but in this charming moment of mutual confidence I cannot resist tell∣ing my love that I have crooked legs  Lord Mel  Crooked legs The devil  Miss Plin  Do not let such a trifle discompose you my aunt Lady Waddle is made just the same as I am and she has eleven children  Lord Mel  If you please Miss Plinlimmon we will put an end to this discourse  Miss Plin  If you desire it We shall have time enough to talk when we are man and wife adieu I am going to Lady Bellair and will tell her all that has passed in this delightful confidential in∣tercourse  Lord Mel  I must insist upon your not revealing one word to Lady Bellair of what I have been saying to you  Miss Plin  As you please your Lordship will find me through life strictly observant of your commands  Exit Miss  PLINLIMMON  Lord Mel  Were my debts and difficulties treble to what they are I would not extricate myself on the condition of marrying that thing That vile antithesis Half a wit and half an ideot    Enter Mr  FASHION  Oh Fashion you never came  so opportunely I am at a loss how to act my scheme has entirely failed  Mr Fash  Then I must be your pilot to steer you through this intricate perplexity  Lord Mel  Her ideot fondness increases with what should have excited her disgust  Mr Fash  Leave me to construct the means of withdrawing from you this girl's partiality I pre∣sume I am empowered to say whatever I please  Lord Mel  You may indulge the utmost lati∣tude paint me in whatever colours you choose  Mr Fash  Well I will endeavour to do my best for you I have a good knack you know at a caricature  Lord Mel  But do not make me too ridiculous  Mr Fash  Remember you just now gave me unlimited powers  Lord Mel  Very true I resign myself to your judgment let me appear absurd fickle preposter∣ous any thing to get rid of this matrimonial en∣gagement  Mr Fash  Suppose while I am unwinding her affections and desires from you I should endea∣vour to bottom and twist them round myself  Lord Mel  What you marry her Are you in earnest Will you quit your free roving pleasureboat for the monotonous hulk of matrimony  Mr Fash  Her guineas will decorate and enliven the hulk  Lord Mel  Well if you can make a proselyte of the girl you have my full permission and best wishes here is my license which with a change of a name will serve your purpose and you may get married immediately without acquainting any of the family of it  Mr Fash  I will go and inform Lady Bellair of your resolution and of my project  Lord Mel  I should be delighted if the girl was to take a fancy to you  Mr Fash  We shall see  Exeunt  SCENE  Lady  BELLAIR'S  Apartment  Lady  BELLAIR  Miss  PLINLIMMON  Lady B  What you choose to say in private is of no consequence but before company I must insist upon your never mentioning my husband  Miss Plin  Then tell me as we are alone I long to hear what occasioned the separation between Lord Bellair and you  Lady B  Restrain this idle curiosity it does not become  Miss Plin  Did your husband walk in his sleep Was he in love with a dead nun  Lady B  How wildly you talk  Miss Plin  Not so wildly neither I know what I know but I will not tell  Enter Sir  PEPPER PLINLIMMON  Sir P Plin  I take the liberty of calling upon your Ladyship to express my uneasiness that the lawyer from town is not yet arrived the post is come in and I have no information about him  Lady B  Delay is the characteristic of his order When that Gray's Inn slug has crawled over and covered with his black slime an acre of parchment we shall see him here  Miss Plin  But Mr Taffey who is to perform the ceremony is as necessary as the lawyer  Sir P Plin  As for Mr Taffey I have a letter from him he will be here this evening  Miss Plin  Then all is well    Rejoicing extra∣vagantly Enter Lord  MELCOURT  My Lord  my Lord Taffey will be here this evening and tomorrow I shall be the fondest of wives  Lord Mel  Flattering as your expectancy may be to me I wish you would restrain this inordi∣nate exultation  Miss Plin  Well papa I will go and pack up my fine cloaths for I suppose we shall set out for Ireland immediately after the ceremony I re∣joice to think that Taffey will be here this evening  Exit  Lord Mel  Aside to Lady BELLAIR  Was there ever such a Hottentot  Sir P Plin  You don't appear Lord Mel∣court to be struck with the artless manner of my girl  Lord Mel  I ask your pardon I am exceedingly struck  Sir P Plin  She has a few rusticities adhering to her all which will drop from her like dross from gold  Lord Mel  In the crucible of Lady Bellair's re∣fining conversation  Sir P Plin  Very true I am certain Lady Bellair would perform miracles on my daughter if she pleased  Lady B  But why Sir Pepper do you doubt my inclination  Sir P Plin  Because you fine ladies dislike trou∣ble I will be bold to say that in the course of the winter you never do any thing your inclina∣tion that is to say your vanity does not prompt you to do  Lady B  I ask your pardon Sir Pepper  Sir P Plin  Indulge for once an old man's cu∣riosity and edify me by recording some instances where you act in opposition to the dictates of your inclination  Lord Mel  This is a perfect challenge  Lady B  Well let me recollect I go every other Sunday in the early part of the evening to  an old aunt who lives at the Antipodes of the fash∣ionable part of the town and there I retail to her the historic scandal of the fortnight and then she reads to me through her green spectacles out of a folio a sermon of the last century  Lord Mel  I hope Sir Pepper you will give Lady Bellair some credit for that  Lady B  Then I go once in the winter to the Ancient Music  Sir P Plin  That I suppose is a concert per∣formed by the decayed musicians  Lady B  Not exactly so it is however a very edifying concert and composed of those hoary venerable notes that in days of yore delighted the ears of Harry the eighth and Anne Bullen and is now a very suitable recreation for old batchelors old maids and emigrant nuns But to continue the narrative of my mortified inclination my carriage every morning makes one of the long procession of coaches that besiege the circulating library in Bond Street  Sir P Plin  That denotes your Ladyship's fondness for literature  Lady B  I beg yor pardon Sir Pepper litera∣ture is my aversion I never look into a book but I cannot avoid calling every morning at the library it is a kind of literary tavern where the waiters are in perpetual demand A dish of ele∣gant sonnets for Miss Simper satires with a poig∣nant sauce for Mrs Grumble a sirloin of history for Lady Sleepless a broil'd devil of private anec∣dote highly peppered with scandal for Lady An∣gelica Worthless It would amuse you Sir Pep∣per to see these female academics enter the porch of Hookham College their cheeks paled by stu∣dy a little relieved by a thin stratum of morning rouge Then you would wonder at the method the learned professors adopt of supplying the im∣patience of their pupils for exampleone lady  receives the first volume of an author of which she will never enquire for the second at the same time she receives the second volume of another author of which she has not yet an idea of the first  Sir P Plin  Give me leave to observe this vague method of reading must create a kind of chaos without consistency  Lady B  Consistency is a vulgar word we do not admit into our vocabulary and as for the chaos you disapprove of I really think there is to be found the whole merit for this miscellaneous variegated unconnected reading forms the beautiful dove∣tailed mosaic literature of the female mind  Sir P Plin  I hope you will allow Lady Plin∣limmon to be a brilliant exception to your general description  Lady B  Most undoubtedly I have a long list of exceptions But not to interrupt the narrative of my own memoirsI am sometimes obliged to mingle with the elegant mob at a sale of pic∣tures  Sir P Plin  A sale of pictures must be very improving You there frequently meet with the works of the old masters  Lady B  The ladies of fashion do not go to auctions for the sake of the  old  masters do they Lord Melcourt  Lord Mel  No indeed A bow from Lord Gauze a smile from Lord Flimsy or a compliment from Sir Gossamer Bagatelle effaces the names of Rembrant Corregio and Vandyke  Lady B  However we play with the catalogue and we stare at the pictures And I have heard it observed that in the two late celebrated sales the love of Vertú made the ladies gaze at some pictures from which their grandmammas would have turned away  Sir P Plin  Indeed  Lady B  But then I will say for the ladies that they stole a glance at these pictures through the medium of their long veils which you know trans∣mits a kind of drapery to the paintings But to proceed I am under the obligation sometimes of getting up in the middle of the night to be in readiness to go to a new play and with all my precaution I never can get there before the middle of the second act  Sir P Plin  That is very unlucky  Lady B  Not in the least for I never listen to the play  Sir P Plin  But does not your talking loud in the first row disturb the audience  Lady B  I never occupy the first row I place the old ladies in the first and second row they have nothing to do poor things but to listen to the play And then I sit snug on the last form which we call among ourselves tattle row and then perhaps I am seated between Sir Voluble Prattle and Colonel Easy and we three converse and titter  a la sourdine  the whole evening but I am afraid I grow dull  Sir P Plin  Quite the reverse I assure you I presume your Ladyship pays more attention to the opera the softness of the Italian language has something enchanting to a delicate ear  Lady B  I know nothing of the Italian lan∣guage there is no attaining the knowledge of it without passing through the perplexing jumbling crossroads of a grammar that would shake my intellects to pieces  Sir P Plin  Still the music may flatter the ear though you do not comprehend the words  Lady B  I comprehend the music as little as I do the words  Sir P Plin  It is then the dancing I conclude delights you  Lady B  No the dancing does not particularly interest me indeed I cannot see the dancing in my box for I generally sit with my back to the stage  Sir P Plin  As neither the music nor the dancing has any allurement I suppose your Lady∣ship seldom or never goes to the opera  Lady B  I ask your pardon Sir Pepper I never omit an opera  Sir P Plin  What then can be the attraction I really see nothing to entice you  Lady B  Is it nothing Sir Pepper to lean half out of one's box with the head inclined to give the easy feather a more graceful play which looks a meteor waving in the air and which as the poet says  "Allures attention from the tuneful scene  "Gives fops the flutter and old maids the spleen"  Is it nothing Sir Pepper to have all the opera glasses levelled at one To sit in my box as on a throne the unrivalled queen of Fopland  Lord Mel  I must confess Lady Bellair you have an extensive dominion Fopland is a very populous country  Lady B  So it is and what is still better there is not an old man to be found in it  Sir P Plin  I am sorry I am excluded from being one of your majesty's subjects  Lady B  Out of regard to your gallantry I will introduce a bill to naturalise you Sir Pepper but not to lose the thread of my narrative I must in∣form you that I go once in the winter to an assem∣bly given by the wife of my physician there all his pale convalescents stalk about like ghosts  Lord Mel  And to conclude the description the lemonade is intentionally made so acid that the doctor is obliged to return all the visits of his company the next day  Sir P Plin  Very good indeed  Lady B  You perceive what a mortified life I am obliged to lead  Sir P Plin  If your historic pencil has drawn a true resemblance I must confess a fashionable lady is to me an incomprehensible being  Exit  Lady B  Now we have got rid of the ridiculous baronet I must assume a graver tone you know I can be very serious when occasion demands The more I see of Sir Pepper's absurd daughter the more I am sensibly affected at the thought of your approaching nuptials The long train of pe∣culiar distresses incident to our family I wish not to see terminated by means so unworthy and igno∣nimous  Lord Mel  I do not comprehend you  Lady B  By marrying a young woman you are ashamed of our family has been long involved in various difficulties it has been known to misfor∣tune but it has never been acquainted with dis∣honor Imagine two large portals opening before you through one of which you should be obliged to pass Imagine one presenting to your view a brilliant perspective a sun streaming from a sum∣mer sky and illuminating an earthly paradise The other unfolding to your vision a lowring atmosphere hanging over a blasted heath Pic∣ture to yourself these words engraved on the first portal  they who pass through me must cast away honor  Fancy on the other you behold this in∣scription  This road leads to honorable poverty  through which of these arches would you direct your footsteps Oh my dear brother in the agita∣tion you betray I read your heroic answer  Lord Mel  Before you had communicated your sentiments to me upon this subject I had made my reflection and had resolved but Mr Fashion whom I am glad to see    Enter  FASHION  will  best unfold the plan we had formed together I refer you to him the confusion I am at present under will excuse my leaving you so abruptly  Exit  Mr Fash  Heyday what is the matter with Melcourt He stalked by me in dumb shew like a tragedy hero  Lady B  The agitation you perceive he is in is the honest working of nature it will do him no harm my brother tells me you have something to communicate to me  Mr Fash  I have and it is of importance I was commissioned by him as he did not choose to speak himself that he is determined to break off this match  Lady B  He partly intimated his resolution But who undertakes to inform the girl of his re∣solution  Mr Fash  That falls to my part in the play  Lady B  What do you propose saying to the poor girl How will you open your unpleasant embassy  Mr Fash  Not so unpleasant because I intend to propose myself  Lady B  Propose yourself  Mr Fash  As I do not occupy so high a station in life as Lord Melcourt I mean by proposing myself to be a kind of a parachute and so break as it were her fall  Lady B  You are very kind indeed You may not perhaps be so invincible in the eyes of the young lady as you are in your own  Mr Fash  I rely on your friendly assistance  Lady B  There you are mistaken But do not impute my declining to cooperate with you to a fear that this may be the means of withdrawing your assiduities and attentions from me I hope I act from a more noble impulse I am ready to confess that the exclusive preference and predilec∣tion  you have shewn me of late have gratified my vanity but like the waves that beat against the heedless rock they have not shook my constancy to the man whose name I bear  Mr Fash  The playful gaiety of your disposi∣tion led me astray and I thought you was delighted to return to society unaccompanied by Lord Bell∣air  Lady B  I own I have the appearance of airiness and levity but my gaiety is frequently assumed and I have recourse to dissipation more as a medicine than a feast  Mr Fash  As you are so kind as to speak to me in so unreserved a manner I think it incumbent on me to declare that I have no inbred aversion to the girl I am not so fastidious so difficult as Melcourt and I will add that was I to succeed I would do every thing in my power to contribute to her happiness and give me also leave to say that I believe I am not indifferent to her  Lady B  With such honorable sentiments as you now assure me you entertain you have my permission to make the trial Mutual propensity believe me is the best security for happiness The smiling flowers she scatters from her hand can alone enliven the domestic walk 'Tis she who displays to the bride and bridegroom that eternal spring which all lovers talk of but which so few expe∣rience 'Tis she who gilds and dissipates the clouds of care and pours upon the soul the chear∣ful sunshine of the mind  Exeunt  END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  Miss  PLINLIMMON  sitting at a Table writing  I AM glad to find that my letters are finished I cannot conceive what Mr Fashion has to say to me in private These letters will make my friends very happy    Enter Mr  FASHION  You are punctual to your time I was just thinking of you Mr Fashion you are a personable manI wonder you are not married  Mr Fash  The reason I am not married is be∣cause there is only one Miss Plinlimmon But give me leave to tell you that you are too late for the post  Miss Plin  These letters are not intended for today's post nor to morrow's post but they are intended for the post the day after the wedding You must know that I am bound by a solemn pro∣mise to write two letters the day after my mar∣riage and as we shall be on our road to Ireland on that day and consequently shall have no time to write I thought it would be a good plan to write beforehand and date the letters after the wedding  which you see I have done and have signed my∣self Isabella Melcourt  Mr Fash  Very ingeniously contrived indeed May I take the liberty of asking who this letter is to  Miss Plin  It is to Mrs Evans an old maiden aunt who was always very kind to me There are no secrets if you please I will read it to you  Mr Fash  I am sure it must be worth hearing if it comes from your pen  Miss Plin  reads  Dear Aunt  Yesterday the holy ceremony was per∣formed We all weptMamma had an hys∣terictwo beautiful tears stole down the cheek of my amiable Lord and when he put on the ring his hand trembled  Mr Fash  But Miss Plinlimmon allow me to ask how do you know all this will happen  Miss Plin  There is always weeping at a wed∣ding as much as at a funeral  Mr Fash  Well I plead ignorance for I never assisted at a wedding  Miss Plin  Then get your white handkerchief ready tomorrow morning But let me see where I left off  reads  When he put on the ring his hand trem∣bled After the ceremony we sat down to a sumptuous collation We lay at a town whose name I forget You cannot dear madam have any conception of his Lordship's kindness to me  I am dear Aunt Your thrice happy niece ISABELLA MELCOURT  Postcript  I should have written a longer let∣ter had I not a bad headache  Mr Fash  But permit me to ask how do you foresee you will have a bad headache  Miss Plin  I heard my mammainlaw say that she had a terrible headache the day after she married so 'tis very probable  Mr Fash  I perceive there is another letter who is honored with this mark of your remem∣brance  Miss Plin  This is to Miss Bluehose member of the female literary society at Carnarvon  Mr Fash  With this lady I suppose you assume a higher style  Miss Plin  I endeavour in this letter to write exactly as Miss Bluehose talks  Reads  Sweet Academic Friend  Aurora yesterday put on her best saf∣fron robe to assist at our wedding we are on our road to Ireland my lord you know is a na∣tive of that kingdom what a delightful country must that be which produces such men Last night three minutes before twelve I ascended the expecting couch  Mr Fash  Very happy expression that  Miss Plin  I am glad you are pleased with it the expecting couch is in the manner and style of our academic society but to proceed  reads  History informs us my dear Miss Bluehose of the bed of Procustes of the bed of Ware of the  Lit de Justice  and of the bed of honor I wonder that in this learned catalogue the historian omitted the bed of Hymen  Mr Fash  It is an unpardonable omission in∣deed  Miss Plin  Now we have done with the letters be so good as to inform me why you look so serious I begin to think you envy Lord Mel∣court well if you do I will tell you for your comfort that if I was to be a widow and had  moulted away my black feathers that is to say when I had shed my weeds and got rid of my sorrow I really think you would stand a good chance  Mr Fash  You flatter me extremely but to advert to the subject which induced me to beg this private audience I must inform you that no∣thing but the great respect I entertain for you could compel me to mention Lord Melcourt in terms not the most favourable  Miss Plin  I know what you allude to but he has promised papa never to touch a card again  Mr Fash  I do not allude to his passion for gaming I point to quite a different thing  Miss Plin  I know what you mean there too he has told me all he clambers up the roof of the house every night  Mr Fash  Clambers up the roof of the house I can't tell what he has chosen to communicate to you but I dare say he has not given you any hint of what my regard for you prompts me to reveal to keep you no longer in suspense Melcourt does not love you I can scarcely suppress my indig∣nation when I behold so enchanting so learned so witty a young lady as Miss Plinlimmon be∣come  Miss Plin  How kind you are  Mr Fash  Become I say the dupe of that indi∣gent peer who only wishes to have his debts paid by your fortune He will look upon you with no greater sensibility than he does his old banker in the city he will set you aside like an useless piece of lumber  Miss Plin  You petrify me Mr Fashion But I have a resource left which will prevent my be∣ing reduced to an useless piece of lumber  Mr Fash  And what is that resource  Miss Plin  It is a resource which belongs to the rights of women a curtain lecture  Mr Fash  Oh that will have no effect  Miss Plin  I know that my mammainlaw has frequent recourse to that expedient  Mr Fash  And what has been her success Her nocturnal murmurings and her loud matin song what have they produced but an airy talkative family of bickerings and discontent  Miss Plin  'Tis very true  Mr Fash  I have frequently been astonished at Lord Melcourt's cold indifference towards you  Miss Plin  Indeed he has not said one kind word to me since I have been at Melcourt Hall  Mr Fash  Then the vehemence of his cha∣racter  Miss Plin  He told me himself he was as cross as the devil  Mr Fash  Then I have wondered at the con∣tempt with which he presumes to speak of you  Miss Plin  I dare say he laughs at me behind my back  Mr Fash  I have heard him say you are an ideot  Miss Plin  I an ideot Did he dare call me an ideot I who am one of the female academics at Carnarvon I an ideot with whom Miss Bluehose corresponds I an ideot who have been electri∣fied and magnetised I an ideot who am ac∣quainted with Mr Omega the famous Jew bota∣nist and have feasted as his house upon his He∣brew roots  Mr Fash  Notwithstanding all these credentials of your wit you find what he says of you  Miss Plin  I feel the blood of the Plinlimmons rise within me  Mr Fash  I should not be surprised if under the idea of your being an ideot he should confine  you in some old castle in Ireland without allowing you pen ink or paper to write to your friend Miss Bluehose without having the pleasure of being magnetised and without ever having the gratification of dining upon Hebrew roots  Miss Plin  I renounce him from this moment With this breath  blows through her fingers  I blow away all my love Imagine you see it float∣ing through the air never to return to Lord Mel∣court again  Mr Fash  Methinks I behold the fairy chariot bearing away your affections Oh that I could arrest the richly freighted vehicle and seize the invaluable prize  Miss Plin  Indeed Are you in earnest  Mr Fash  I am upon my honour  Miss Plin  Ah but you are so wild and you love all the women  Mr Fash  I am like other young men when under no particular engagement like a bird in the grove I wing from bough to bough but once married I should be as domestic and as constant as the turtledove  Miss Plin  If it be so I could be almost in∣duced  Mr Fash  Come come let me seize this coy handshew you have a spirit to reward as well as to resent  Miss Plin  laughing  It would be a good trick to play the Irish peer  Mr Fash  The study of my life would be your happiness  Miss Plin  Are you a gentleman  Mr Fash  That you know by my nameand in point of character I am totally different from Lord MelcourtI love you passionately  Miss Plin  That is no unpleasing intelligence  Mr Fash  I do not walk in my sleep  Mise Plin  I am very glad to hear that  Mr Fash  But no time is to be lostthis li∣cense of Lord Melcourt's with a small change will serve our purpose  Miss Plin  Taffey will sow us together in a twinkle  Mr Fash  Let us fly to the parson  Exeunt  SCENE  Another Apartment  Enter Sir  PEPPER PLINLIMMON  Well if what I am informed of should prove true that my girl has no inclination to Lord Mel∣court I shall not force her  Lady Plin  behind the scenes  Where is Sir Pepper Where is Sir Pepper  Sir P Plin  I hear Lady Plinlimmon's voice now she is coming to pour upon me as from a wide mortarpiece  Enter Lady  PLINLIMMON  Lady Plin  Do you call me a wide mortarpiece Sir PepperBut let that passI come to de∣mand your authority over this wayward girl of our's who pretends to dislike Lord Melcourt be∣cause he is not forsooth sentimentally in love with her  Sir P Plin  Without mutual affection there is no living together  Lady Plin  Have we not lived these fifteen years together  Sir P Plin  Yes and how have we lived  Enter Lady  BELLAIR  Lady Plin  I have been gently expostulating with Sir Pepper on his concurring with Isabella's whim∣sical objection to Lord Melcourt  Lady B  I confess I side with Sir Pepper  Lady Plin  Is it possible  Lady B  Though the loss is my brother's I shall not offer a word to reconcile Sir Pepper to an engagement that does not meet with his daugh∣ter's approbation  Lady Plin  I am astonished to hear Lady Bellair encourage a rustic notion that is unknown to the regions of fashion  Lady B  Your Ladyship must allow that mutual happiness is the end proposed 'Tis the mark which if the bride and bridegroom in the higher sphere do not hit it is because they take a false aim  Lady Plin  Morality too  Lady B  Am not I an instance of the folly of hurrying into an unavoidable engagement  Lady Plin  Not in the least Does not the world encircle you with all its attractions Do you not enjoy the advantages of wedlock without the incumbrancesyour Lord's title and a hand∣some allowance  Lady B  Your Ladyship forgets that Sir Pepper is present  Sir P Plin  I beg she may not be interrupted on my account  Lady Plin  Give me leave to ask in what man∣ner your Ladyship can be supposed to be a suf∣ferer from your being separated from Lord Bellair Do your jewels shine less bright Is the ostrichfeather on your cap less playful Is the lace  Sir P Plin  Zounds Lady Plinlimmon your  head is like a newspaper after a birthdayfull of nothing but gauzes foils and trimmings  Lady Plin  Well I stand corrected I give up the point concerning my daughter since I find every body is against me  Enter Lord  MELCOURT  Lord Mel  I am happy to find Lady Plinlim∣mon here I am impatient to make this open de∣claration to her that the concern I feel in not being allowed to expect the honour of her alliance is lost in the higher consideration of Miss Plinlimmon's happiness  Lady Plin  Indeed my Lord you are too good to give way to the absurd objections of an ignorant girl  Enter Mr  FASHION  and Miss  PLINLIMMON  Mr  PHRENSY  and Mr  FANCY  Mr  FASHION  and Miss  PLINLIMMON  kneel  Miss Plin  Dear papa give me and my husband your blessing  Sir P Plin  Your husband  Lady Plin  Your husband  Mr Phrensy  'Tis even so I had the honour of giving her away  Lady Plin  What do you say to this Lord Mel∣court    To Mr  FASHION  Audacious wretch to steal my daughter  Lord Mel  I can assure your Ladyship Fashion is one of the most ancient families in the king∣dom and has a title in obeyance  Lady Plin  Well if he has a title in obeyance  Sir P Plin  But will Lord Melcourt vouch for his character  Lord Mel  Her Ladyship looks to the gaudy distinction of title you sir look for something more substantial Then let me tell you that Fa∣shion possesses those titles which virtue's patent only can bestow honor and integrity  Sir P Plin  Then I am satisfied come Lady Plinlimmon let us forgive our child    Going up to Mr  FASHION  and Lady  PLINLIMMON  Mr Phrensy  But who is to reward me for my epithalamium To whom shall I consign it  Lord Mel  I will tell youconsign it to the firegrate that is the only way to insure it a warm reception  Mr Phrensy  Your envy at my talents prompts you to use so pitiful a conceit  Lord Mel  Well Phrensy I will indulge another conceit which will not offend you so much and that is I hope as long as you choose to be dead you will live at Melcourt Hall  Mr Phrensy  Egad Melcourt Hall is so delight∣ful a sepulchre I do not believe I shall ever wish to be alive again  Lord Mel  Do you then never intend to return to life  Mr Phrensy  Yes I do as soon as I have by means of my subscription completed my poetical loan my return to life will be a kind of an ova∣tion the triumphal procession shall begin with my odes each on his fiery Pegasus my satires like tomahawks shall next appear then my ele∣gies shall move like a weeping train of female captives to these shall succeed my epigrams a brisk troop of archers with their pointed darts my grand epic like a large unwieldy elephant shall march by itself then my tragedies attired as widows shall walk on one side while my gaily vested comedies shall trip on the other  Mr Fancy  And a musical band of catcalls shall walk between  Mr Phrensy  Base canvass dauber how dare you interrupt me when the poet's eye was in a fine Phrensy rolling when the muse was kindling with conception vile brushholder you do not know the mischief you have done you have made the muse miscarry the bright vision is lost for ever  Exit Mr  PHRENSY  Lady B  Advancing  Now Phrensy has finished his poetical rhapsody I beg I may present my congratulations to the bride and bridegroom I must confess to you Mr Fashion that I little thought the gay irregular comedy of your bache∣lor life would have terminated with so abrupt and moral a conclusion as for you my dear though I am not to call you sister you will always be the object of my tender solicitude  Miss Plin  I am a giddy creature but I hope I shall never forfeit your protection I shall leave to others to pursue the varying modes and fopperies of the day this is the Fashion  pointing to Fashion  that I shall adopt and to this Fashion I shall be ever constant  Lord Mel  Bravo Matrimony inspires you well as it is now my turn to speak I beg you will both accept of my best wishes may happiness lead you through life along her most smooth and flowry path  Miss Plin  Well my lord since you take my tricking you in such perfect good humour when I am mistress of my fortune I will lend you what∣ever money you stand in need of  Mr Fash  displeased  Lord Melcourt does not want our money I presume  Miss Plin  I hope to see your Lordship at our house in the country I suppose Mr Fashion you have one somewheré  Lord Mel  Fashion's country house I am afraid is little better than a castle in the air but till he has one erected upon a more solid foundation I en∣treat Mr and Mrs Fashion will look upon Mel∣court Hall as their own  Miss Plin  Egad this is handsome I have one thing more to recommend to your Lordship  Lord Mel  What are your commands  Miss Plin  half aside  Be sure you never men∣tion the crooked legs  Lord Mel  Depend upon my discretioncome let us all pass some chearful days under this roof let reproaches and complainings cease let good humour social intercourse pleasantry and content succeed  END OF THE COMEDY  EPILOGUE  BY THE RIGHT HON FIELD MARSHAL CONWAY  Spoken by Miss Farren  WITH gloomy bodings for his bantling play  Our Author came to me the other day  A boon to ask tho' half afraid to break it  He'd got an Epilogue and I must speak it  All means he fain would try if not too late  Still to avert his dread impending fate  Sad visions too distract his anxious brain  Rumours of ills that wait the scribbling train  'Tis said your taste for Comedy is flown  That darling child you once were proud to own  That Shakespear's fires no more your senses rouze  Congreve and Vanbrugh seldom fill the house  While childish pageants stuff the crouded scene  No mortal even guessing what they mean  Fierce wars they wage and dreadful battles try  With bloodless conflict all one knows not why  Till by the friendly banners we are told  There Macedon's there Persia's chief behold  Just as on signs th' informing words declare  This the Red Lion that is the Black Bear  Queens and their maids of honor wait in vain  Till their mute lovers shall their suit explain  They'd often heard indeed from Greece and Rome  That love was blind but ne'er that he was dumb  There too those motly female manly graces  With almost all things naked but their faces  Those modern Picts at whom we gaze with wonder  While their keen falchions cut whole ranks asunder  Great Rustyfusti's triumphs thus we greet  Six holy Roman emp'rors breathless at her feet  Nor less the neighb'ring temples of Apollo  With equal steps the bright example follow  There beardless warriors squeak each other's doom  And silken Vandals plan the fall of Rome  There demigods by entrechâts advance  And Carthage flames demolish'd in a dance  Arms clash loud thunders roar and chariots rattle  While jarring trumpets animate the battle  Now critics if you're angry think on these  And spare the bard who strives at least to please  Judge and be judg'd in anger just I pray  Audire alteram partem  is fair play  In such a cause altho' the task be hard  I'll be myself of counsel for our bard  I've such authorities as none refuses  Fleta's and Coke's and Blackstone's of the Muses  Farqhuar and Rowe and Wycherly we boast  And Avon's mighty seer himself a host  Yet for I feel my female fears increase  Tho' arm'd for war  yet still I wish  for peace  We own your pow'r confess your wond'rous sway  Whom all our great dramatic realms obey  No merit we can claim till you befriend it  Wit is not wit unless your taste commend it  From th' Author's anvil a mere sluggish mass  Your plaudits stamp the coin and bid it pass  By your mild sentence then decide our fate  Far better to be good than to be great  Like Britain's Monarch act your generous parts  And fix your empire in our greatful hearts  FINIS
