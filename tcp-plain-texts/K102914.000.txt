 THE UPHOLSTERER OR What NEWS A FARCE In Two ACTS As it is Performed at the THEATRE ROYALâ–ª IN  DRURYLANE    O Bone nam te  Deos qu  tiam propius contingis oportet  Num quid de Dacis a  disti    HOR  By the Author of the APPRENTICE  LONDON  Printed for P VAILLANT facing  Southamptonstreet  in the  Strand  MDCCLVIII Price One Shilling  To Mr  GARRICK  SIR  THE UPHOLSTERER would be a  Bankrupt  even in thanks could he think of going abroad into the World without making his Compliments to Mr  Garrick  for the Civilities he has shewn him Whatever Figure the poor broken Politician might make before the Commissioners of Bankruptcy at  Guildhall  you have taken care of his Appearance before the selfchosen Commissioners of Criticism at the Theatre Royal in  DruryLane  I am not willing to flatter myself that you were drawn forth on this occasion by any extraordinary Touches in the capital Figure or in the  Accompagnements du Tableau  I rather suppose that you approved the Justness of the Design than that you were an Admirer of the Colouring  The Design Sir was conceived and executed long since because the Author judged that something in this way might have a seasonable tendency to allay the Intemperance of too violent a Political Spirit or at least to laugh it into good Humour With the same view it was lately retouched and given to Mr  Mossop  to be presented to the Public at his Benefit And however Men of a serious Cast may depreciate Amusements of this nature I shall never blush for having dedicated a few Hours to them as I am of opinion that suchlike Avocations will more profitably unbend the Mind from graver Studies than the solitary Pleasures of the Recluse or any of the more open Dissipations of Life  I am aware that you will very probably recollect a Passage in a celebrated Writer  Montesquicu  which may seem to render the scope of this little Piece somewhat questionable  Dans une Nation Libre  saith he  Il est tres Souvent indiferent que les Particuliers Raisonnets bien ou mal il sufit qu'ils Raisonnent de la sort la Liberte qui Garantit des Effets de ces memes Raisonnements  But you know that the Question here is not concerning the indisputable Right of the People to canvass their national Concerns but the vicious Excess of a propensity to Politics when it gives a wrong Bias to the Mind and is attended with Circumstances which create the ridiculous Absurd In this light it was considered by Mr  Addison  who tells us in the  Tatler  Vide Number    and    that he designed his Paper  for the Benefit of those Citizens who live more in a Coffeehouse than in their Shops and whose Thoughts are so taken up with the Affairs of the Allies that they forget their Customers  For the very same Species of People the  Upholsterer  was brought on the Stage being perhaps as proper an Object of Ridicule as modern I de as and Manners will afford  With regard to the Execution I shall not detain you any longer on that head than to remark that to preserve the Gravity which is a specific Quality in Mr  Addison  's fine vein of Humour has been my Endeavour throughout the Whole though I am not insensible that grave Humour is sometimes dangerous on the Stage In the principal Character I considered myself rather describing a  Passion  than a  Man  and this you remember is mentioned by an excellent Critic  Mr  Hurd  to belong to the Province of Farce For this Reason the UPHOLSTERER'S  Scenes are strongly tinctured with his predominant Foible and as this Foible is generally fed and inflamed by a swarm of political Writers I judged it coincident with my Plan to expose the Duplicity of their Conduct by introducing the Character of PAMPHLET  This Character I have had the pleasure of seeing set off with all the exquisite Strokes of so fine a Comic Genius as Mr GARRICK'S without being indebted for Success to the Aid of personal Satire having entirely levelled it against those who are the ready Mercenaries of all Parties and with all such I have the Happiness not to be acquainted  I could here enlarge in the just Praise of Mr  Woodward  Mr  Yates  and Mrs  Clive c  but I have already deviated too far from the Purpose I set out with which was not to inscribe a Farce to you for neither of us thinks so highly of these Matters nor to become your Panegyrist for your extended Reputation does not stand in need of it My Intention was to embrace a public Opportunity of subscribing myself  SIR  Your most Obedient Very Humble Servant The AUTHOR  Lincoln's Inn  th  April    PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr MOSSOP  WHEN first in falling
