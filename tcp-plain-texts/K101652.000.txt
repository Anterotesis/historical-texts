DERBY  ODE TO Mr WRIGHT of DERBY    AWAY ye sweet but trivial Forms  That from the placid pencil rise  When playful art the landscape warms  With Italy's unclouded skies  Stay Vanity nor yet demand  Thy portrait from the painter's hand  Nor ask thou Indolence to aid thy dream  The soft illusion of the mimic stream  That twinkles to thy sight with Cynthia's trembling beam  Be thine my friend a nobler task  Beside thy vacant easel see  Guests who with claims superior ask  New miracles of art from thee  Valour who mocks unequal strife  And Clemency whose smile is life  "WRIGHT let thy skill this radiant pair exclaim  "Give to our view our favorite scene of Fame  "Where Britain's Genius blaz'd in Glory's brightest flame"  Celestial ministers ye speak  To no dull agent slothopprest  Who coldly hears in spirit weak  Heroic Virtue's high behest  Behold tho' Envy strives to foil  The Artist bent on public toil  Behold his flames terrific lustre shed  His naval blaze mounts from its billowy bed  And Calpe proudly rears her warillumin'd head  In gorgeous pomp for ever shine  Bright monument of Britain's force  Tho' doom'd to feel her fame decline  In illstarr'd war's o'erwhelming course  Tho' Europe's envious realms unite  To crush her in unequal fight  Her Genius deeply stung with generous shame  On this exulting rock array'd in flame  Equals her ancient feats and vindicates her name  How fiercely British valour pours  The deluge of destroying fire  Which o'er that watery Babel roars  Bidding the baffled host retire  And leave their fall'n to yield their breath  In different pangs of double death  Ye shall not perish no ye hapless brave  Reckless of peril thro' the fiery wave  See British mercy steers each prostrate foe to save  Ye gallant Chiefs whose deeds proclaim  The genuine hero's feeling soul  Elliot and Curtis with whose name  Honor enrich'd his radiant roll  Blest is your fate nor blest alone  That rescued foes your virtues own  That Britain triumphs in your filial worth  Blest in the period of your glory's birth  When art can bid it live to decorate the earth  Alas what deeds where virtue reign'd  Have in oblivious darkness died  When Painting by the Goths enchain'd  No lifesecuring tints supplied  Of all thy powers enchanting art  Thou deemest this the dearest part  To guard the rights of valour and afford  Surviving lustre to the hero's sword  For this heroic Greece thy martial charms ador'd  Rival of Greece in arms in arts  Tho' deem'd in her declining days  Britain yet boasts unnumber'd hearts  Who keenly pant for public praise  Her battles yet are firmly fought  By Chiefs with Spartan courage fraught  Her Painters with Athenian zeal unite  To trace the glories of the prosp'rous fight  And gild th' embattled scene with art's immortal light  Tho' many a hand may well portray  The rushing war's infuriate shock  Proud Calpe bids thee WRIGHT display  The terrors of her blazing rock  The burning hulks of baffled Spain  From thee she claims nor claims in vain  Thou mighty master of the mimic flame  Whose matchless pencil with peculiar aim  Has form'd of lasting fire the basis of thy fame  Just in thy praise thy country's voice  Loudly asserts thy signal power  In this reward may'st thou rejoice  In modest labour's silent hour  Far from those seats where envious leagues  And dark cabals and base intrigues  Exclude meek Merit from his proper home  Where Art whom Royalty forbade to roam  Against thy talents clos'd her selfdishonor'd dome  When partial pride and mean neglect  The nerves of injur'd Genius gall  What kindly spells of keen effect  His energy of heart recall  Perchance there is no spell so strong  As Friendship's sympathetic song  By fancy link'd in a fraternal band  Artist and Bard in sweet alliance stand  They suffer equal wounds and mutual aid demand  Go then to slighted worth devote  Thy willing verse my fearless Muse  Haply thy free and friendly note  Some joyous ardor may infuse  In fibres that severely smart  From potent Envy's poison'd dart  Thro' WRIGHT'S warm breast bid tides of vigor roll  Guard him from meek Depression's chill controul  And rouse him to exert each sinew of his soul  ODE TO THE COUNTESS DE GENLIS    ODE TO THE COUNTESS DE GENLIS    I  NO more let English pride arraign  The Gallic Muse as light and vain  Whose trifling fingers can but weave  The flimsy novel to deceive  Inaction's languid hour  Where sentiment from nothing spun  Shines like a gardencobweb in the sun  Thrown in autumnal nights o'er many a wither'd flower  II  Too often in the giddy fit  Of wanton or satiric wit  The rash and frolic sons of France  Have sketch'd the frivolous romance  While Reason stood aloof  While Modesty the work disclaim'd  And griev'd Religion with disdain inflam'd  On the licentious page pronounc'd her just reproof  III  The Genius of the generous land  Survey'd the vain fantastic band  And kindling with indignant pride  Athirst for genuine glory cried  "Too long have ye disgrac'd  "The Gallic nameye sophists hence  "A female hand shall expiate your offence  "The wrongs that you have done to Virtue  Truth and Taste  IV  "Rise my GENLIS those ills corrcct  "That spring from this pernicious sect  "To infancy's important years  "That season of parental fears  "Devote thy varied page  "Mould and defend the youthful heart  "Against the subtle souldebasing art  "Of the sarcastic wit and selfintitled sage"  V  Illumin'd with angelic zeal  And wising Nature's general weal  The lovely moralist arose  The flame that from Religion flows  Play'd round her pensive head  The tender Virtues smiling strove  T' enrich the variegated web she wove  Where Wisdom's temperate hand the flowers of Fancy spread  VI  The sisters of theatric power  Whose intermingled sun and shower  Give to the stage in friendly strife  Each touching charm of chequer'd life  Inspir'd the friend of youth  Arts yet unknown to her they taught  To fix and charm quick childhood's rambling thought  With unexampled scenes of tenderness and truth  VII  Her pathos is not proudly built  On splendid or impassion'd guilt  The little incidents that rise  As sportive youth's light season flies  Her simple drama fill  Yet he the sweet Socratic sage  Euripides    Who steep'd in tears the wide Athenian stage  Fram'd not his moral scene with more pathetic skill  VIII  In the rich novel's ampler field  Her genius rears a radiant shield  With Fancy's blazonry imprest  Potent to save the youthful breast  From Passion's poison'd dart  Like that which Homer's gods produce  Its highwrought beauties shine with double use  To charm the curious mind and guard th' unwary heart  IX  Ye Fairies 'twas your boast to bind  In sweet amaze the infant mind  But scorning Fiction's faded flower  Behold GENLIS in magic power  Your sorcery excells  She first of childhood's pleasing friends  Arm'd with the force that liberal science lends  From art and nature frames her more attractive spells  Alluding to the Tale intitled "La FÃ©erie de l'Art de la Nature"    X  Lovely magician in return  For the sweet tears of fond concern  With moral pleasure's tender thrill  Awak'd by thy enchanting skill  Accept this votive rhyme  Spurn not a wreath of foreign hue  Tho' rudely twin'd of humble flowers that grew  In a sequester'd vale of Albion's wayward clime  XI  Think if from Britain's churlish sky  This verse to foreign genius fly  Think not our letter'd females raise  No titles to melodious praise  Keen Science cannot find  One clime within the earth's wide zone  Whose daughters Britain have surpass'd thy own  In the career of art the triumphs of the mind  XII  This honest boast of English pride  Which meaner merit might deride  Will ne'er the just GENLIS beguile  Of one disdainful envious smile  For Envy ne'er conceal'd  From her clear sight a rival's claim  Her voice has swell'd my fair compatriots fame  Pleas'd with their glorious march o'er Learning's varied field  XIII  Doubly GENLIS may'st thou rejoice  Whene'er impartial Glory's voice  Ranks with the happiest toils of men  The graceful works of woman's pen  Tho' not of Gallic frame  For O beneath whatever skies  Records of female Genius may arise  Those records must enfold thy fair and fav'rite name  XIV  In every clime where Arts have smil'd  Where'er the mother loves her child  And pants with anxious zeal possest  To fortify the tender breast  And the young mind enlarge  From thy chaste page she'll learn the art  Fondly to play the sage preceptor's part  And draw her dearest joys from that important charge  XV  Wherever youth with curious view  Instructive pleasure shall pursue  Thy little lively student there  With rapt Attention's keenest air  Shall o'er thy volumes bend  And while his tears their charm confess  His grateful voice shall in their author bless  The spiritkindling guide the heartenchanting friend  ODE TO RICHARD VERNON SADLEIR ESQ    ODE TO RICHARD VERNON SADLEIR ESQ    I  BUSINESS be gone Thou vulture Care  No more the quivering sinews tear  Of Sadleir's mortal frame  Full well his firm and active mind  Has paid the duties that mankind  From sense and virtue claim  II  Alas too wellfor mental toil  Our fine machinery will spoil  As Nature has decreed  She form'd the powers that raise the soul  Like wheels that kindle as they roll  And perish by their speed  III  Let health and vigour on the stage  Support the scene while milder age  Resigns the bustling part  If flowers the busy path adorn  Ingratitude there plants her thorn  Which pierces to the heart  IV  Oft hast thou seen her poison'd shoot  Where Hope expected fairest fruit  Yet still thy bounty flows  Like constant dew that falls on earth  Although it wakens into birth  The nightshade with the rose  V  Thy warmth of heart O still retain  Nor of Ingratitude complain  Howe'er her wounds may burn  Bliss from benevolence must flow  Angels are blest while they bestow  Unconscious of return  VI  And happiness we only find  In those exertions of the mind  That form the ardent friend  In these it dwells with these it flies  As all the comet's splendor dies  Whene'er its motions end  VII  O let the lustre of thy soul  No more eccentrically roll  Thro' Labour's long career  O haste its dangerous course confine  And let it permanently shine  In Pleasure's milder sphere  VIII  In Friendship's name thy voice invites  Our willing hearts to social rites  Where Laughter is thy guest  But O these eyes with anguish burn  And fear their weaken'd orbs to turn  From Nature's verdant vest  IX  Thy invitation then forbear  Tho' at thy board in union rare  Kind Plenty reigns with Wit  Thy roof is joyous but I doubt  That we should find the brilliant rout  For burning eyes unfit  X  Thy noisy town and dusty street  Do thou exchange for this retreat  Whose charms thy songs commend  On Learning's page forbid to look  We yet can read that dearer book  The visage of a friend  SONNETS SONGS AND OCCASIONAL VERSES  SONNET TO THE EARL OF HARDWICKE  With the Second Edition of the Epistles to ROMNEY    HARDWICKE whose bright applause a poet crown'd  Unknown to thee and to the Muse's quire  Permit his hand with joyous pride to sound  A note of gratitude on Freedom's lyre  And fear not Flattery's song from one plac'd higher  Than she has power to raise her menial crew  From one who proud of independent fire  Scorns the base Noble but reveres the true  The liberal spirit feels thy generous praise  Fall from pure Honour's sphere like genial dew  Blest if its vital influence shall raise  A future flower more worthy of thy view  Blest if in these repolish'd lays thou find  Some light reflected from thy letter'd mind  SONNET TO EDWARD GIBBON ESQ  On the Publication of his Second and Third Volumes    WITH proud delight th' imperial Founder gaz'd  On the new beauty of his second Rome  When on his eager eye rich temples blaz'd  And his fair city rose in youthful bloom  A pride more noble may thy heart assume  O GIBBON gazing on thy growing work  In which constructed for a happier doom  No hasty marks of vain ambition lurk  Thou may'st deride both Time's destructive sway  And baser Envy's beautymangling dirk  Thy gorgeous fabrick plann'd with wise delay  Shall baffle foes more savage than the Turk  As ages multiply its fame shall rise  And earth must perish ere its splendor dies  SONNET TO THE SAME  Written in MADAME DE LAMBERT'S Essays on Friendship and Old Age in the Name of the Lady who translated them  HOW may I GIBBON to thy taste confide  This artless copy of a Gallic gem  Wilt thou not cast th' unpolish'd work aside  And with just scorn my failing line condemn  No thou wilt never with pedantic phlegm  Spurn the first produce of a female mind  Young flowers that trembling on a tender stem  Court thy protection from each ruder wind  Tho' I may injure by a coarser style  The work that Lambert's graceful hand design'd  I still if favour'd by thy partial smile  Shall boast like her of friendship's joys refin'd  Nor fear from age her lift of female woes  If as my years increase thy friendship grows  SONNET TO EDMUND ANTROBUS ESQ  With the same Essays  KIND Host who bordering on the vale of years  Keep'st in thy generous heart a youthful glow  Whose liberal elegance of soul endears  The joy thy bounty glories to bestow  Accept a volume in whose pages flow  The mild effusions of a female mind  First of the letter'd fair that France can shew  Of sprightly wit with moral truth combin'd  In the faint copy may thy candour see  Some slight resemblance of her style refin'd  Whate'er the merits of the book in thee  May all the blessings of its theme be join'd  Thine be that joy which Friendship's bosom fills  And thine the peace of age without its ills  SONNET TO DR HARINGTON  On his adding Music to a Song of the Author's  HARMONIOUS Friend to whom my honour'd Muse  Is eager to declare how much she owes  Accept and with indulgent eye peruse  Her hasty verse impatient to disclose  How from your aid her new attraction flows  Cold as the figure of unfinish'd clay  Which by Prometheus' plastic hand arose  My lifeless song in half existence lay  I could not add the spark of heav'nly flame  To Harmony's high sphere I dar'd not stray  To steal from thencebut in this languid frame  You pour without a theft the vital ray  Your generous art the quick'ning spirit gives  And by your tuneful fire the Ballad lives  SONNET TO WILLIAM MELMOTH ESQ  MELMOTH in talents and in virtues blest  Pleas'd I contemplate thy attractive page  Where thy mild Pliny and Rome's guardian Sage  Of purer eloquence thy powers attest  And rare felicitynear half an age  Our polish'd tongue has rank'd thee with the best  Of England's classics yet Detraction's rage  Has fail'd to point her arrows at thy breast  Rich in those palms that Taste and Truth bestow  Who praise in Learning's field thy long career  By what nice skill that worth can seldom shew  Hast thou eluded Slander's envious sneer  Blest who excel but tenfold bliss they know  Who in excelling live without a foe  SONNET TO MRS HAYLEY  On her Voyage to America  THOU vext Atlantic who hast lately seen  Britain's vain thunder on her offspring hurl'd  And the blind parent in her frantic spleen  Pouring weak vengeance on a filial world  Thou whose rough billows in loud fury curl'd  Have roar'd indignant under many a keel  And while Contention all her sails unfurl'd  Have groan'd the weight of illstarr'd war to feel  Now let thy placid waters gaily bear  A freight far differing from bloodthirsty steel  See HAYLEY now to cross thy flood prepare  A female merchant fraught with friendly zeal  Give her kind gales ye spirits of the air  Kind as her heart and as her purpose fair  SONNET TO JOHN SARGENT ESQ  On his Doubts of publishing his Drama intitled 'THE MINE'  AWAY with diffidence and modest fear  Thou happy sav'rite of Castalia's quire  Withhold no longer from the public ear  The rich delight thy varied lays inspire  Nor from the press with trembling awe retire  That dread essay is dangerous alone  When mimic dross adulterates the lyre  Thine is of purest goldits perfect tone  The fancy and the heart alike obey  Invention's self has made her MINE thy own  Give its new gems to blaze in open day  And seat that bounteous queen on Glory's throne  A brother bard if he may boast the name  Sounds with proud joy this prelude to thy fame  SONNET TO MR WILLIAM LONG  On his Recovery from a dangerous Illness  BLEST be the day which bids my grief subside  Rais'd by the sickness of my distant friend  Blest the dear lines so long to Hope deny'd  By Languor's aching fingers kindly penn'd  How keen the fear to feel his letters end  Whose wit was my delight whose truth my guide  But how did joy that painful fear transcend  When I again his wellknown hand descried  Such was the dread of newcreated man  When first he miss'd the setting orb of day  Such the delight that thro' his bosom ran  When he perceiv'd the reascending ray  Ah no his thoughts endur'd less anxious strife  Thou Friendship art the sun of mental life  EPITAPH ON WILLIAM BRYANT  Aged Parish Clerk of EARTHAM  BY sportive youth and busy manhood blest  Here thou meek father of our village rest  If length of days in toilsome duties spent  With chearful Honesty and mild Content  If age endur'd with firm and patient mind  If life with willing piety resign'd  If these are certain proofs of human worth  Which dear to Heaven demand the praise of earth  E'en Pride shall venerate this humble sod  That holds a Christian worthy of his GOD  SONG  I  YE cliffs I to your airy steep  Ascend with trembling hope and and fear  To gaze on this extensive deep  And watch if WILLIAM'S sails appear  II  Long months elapse while here I breathe  Vain Expectation's frequent prayer  Till bending o'er the waves beneath  I drop the tear of dumb despair  III  But see a glistening sail in view  Tumultuous hopes arise  'Tis heI feel the vision true  I trust my conscious eyes  IV  His promis'd signals from the mast  My timid doubts destroy  What was your pain ye terrors past  To this ecstatic joy  SONG  I  FROM glaring shew and giddy noise  The pleasures of the vain  Take me ye soft ye silent joys  To your retreats again  III  Be mine ye cool ye peaceful groves  Whose shades to love belong  Where Echo as she fondly roves  Repeats my STELLA'S song  III  Ah STELLA why should I depart  From solitude and thee  When in that solitude thou art  A perfect world to me  SONG  I  'TIS Memory's aid my vows implore  For she will smile when Fortune's coy  And to the eye of love restore  The spirit of departed joy  II  O plunge me still with magic art  In soothing Fancy's soft abyss  And sill my fond my faithful heart  With visions of thy purer bliss  SONG  I  STAY O stay thou lovely shade  Brought by Sleep to Sorrow's aid  Ah the sweet illusion ends  Light and Reason cruel friends  Bid me not with frantic care  Vainly worship fleeting air  II  Night return on rapid wing  Round my head thy poppies fling  Hateful day thy reign be brief  Darkness is the friend of grief  Couldst thou Sleep my dream restore  I should wish to wake no more  SONG  I  ENJOY my child the balmy sleep  Which o'er thy form new beauties throws  And long thy tranquil spirit keep  A stranger to thy mother's woes  Tho' in distress  I feel it less  While gazing on thy sweet repose  II  Condemn'd to pangs like inward fire  That thro' my injur'd bosom roll  How would my heart in death desire  Relief from Fortune's hard controul  Did not thy arms  And infant charms  To earth enchain my anxious soul  III  Flow fast my tearsby you reliev'd  I vent my anguish thus unknown  But cease ere ye can be perceiv'd  By this dear child to pity prone  Whose tender heart  Would seize a part  In grief that should be all my own  IV  Our cup of woe which angels fill  Perchance it is my lot to drain  While that of joy unmix'd with ill  May thus my child for thee remain  If thou art free  So Heaven decree  I bless my doom of double pain  A CARD OF INVITATION TO Mr GIBBON at BRIGHTHELMSTONE    AN English Sparrow pert and free  Who chirps beneath his native tree  Hearing the Roman Eagle's near  And feeling more respect than fear  Thus with united love and awe  Invites him to his shed of straw  Tho' he is but a twittering Sparrow  The fields he hops in rather narrow  When nobler plumes attract his view  He ever pays them homage due  And looks with reverential wonder  On him whose talons bear the thunder  Nor could the Jackdaws e'er inveigle  His voice to vilify the Eagle  Tho' issuing from those holy tow'rs  In which they build their warmest bow'rs  Their Sovereign's haunt they slily search  In hopes to find him on his perch  For PINDAR says beside his God  The thunderbearing Bird will nod  Then peeping round his still retreat  They pick from underneath his feet  Some molted feather he lets fall  And swear he cannot fly at all  Lord of the Sky whose pounce can tear  These croakers that infest the air  Trust him the Sparrow loves to sing  The praise of thy imperial wing  He thinks thou'lt deem him on his word  An honest tho' familiar Bird  And hopes thou soon wilt condescend  To look upon thy little friend  That he may boast around his grove  A visit from the BIRD OF JOVE  TO MR MASON  On his sending the Author his Translation of DUFRESNOY with Notes by Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS  I  DEAR Brother of the tuneful art  To whom I justly bend  I prize with a fraternal heart  The pleasing gift you send  II  With pride by envy undebas'd  My English spirit views  How far your elegance of taste  Improves a Gallie Muse  III  I thought that Muse but meanly drest  When her stiff gown was Latin  But you have turn'd her grogram vest  Into fine folds of sattin  IV  Mild REYNOLDS looks with liberal favor  On your adopted girl  And to the graceful robe you gave her  Adds rich festoons of pearl  IMPROMPTU TO MR MEYER  On his sending the Author from the Continent two Prints representing The Coronation of VOLTAIRE and ROUSSEAU'S Arrival in Elysium  I  THE Song that shakes the festive roof  When mirth and music's liveliest notes ascend  Is not more pleasing than the proof  Of kind remembrance from an absent friend  II  Then guess the pleasure that we share  And thus dear MEYER accept the thanks we owe  While we behold the crown'd VOLTAIRE  And see Elysium hail our lov'd ROUSSEAU  III  May all the honour all the joy  Known by each genius in thy gift portray'd  Be thine without the dull alloy  That ting'd their golden days with dusky shade  IV  As lively as the gay VOLTAIRE  With his keen pen may thy fine pencil strive  May'st thou as long delight the fair  And triumph like the Bard at EIGHTYFIVE  V  As tender as the warm ROUSSEAU  Like him thy happier thought on nature fix  But 'midst thy prospering children know  A true Elysiumon this side the Styx  A RECEIPT  To make a TRAGEDY  TAKE a virgin from Asia from Afric or Greece  At least a king's daughter or emperor's niece  Take an elderly miss for her kind confidante  Still ready with pity or terror to pant  While she faints and revives like the sensitive plant  Take a hero thought buried some ten years or more  But with life enough left him to rattle and roar  Take a horrid old brute who deserves to be rack'd  And call him a tyrant ten times in each act  Take a priest of cold blood and a warrior of hot  And let them alternately bluster and plot  Then throw in of soldiers and slaves  quantum suff  Let them march and stand still fight and halloo enough  Now stir all together these separate parts  And season them well with Ohs faintings and starts  Squeeze in while they're stirring a potent infusion  Of rage and of horror of love and illusion  With madness and murder complete the conclusion  Let your princess tho' dead by the murderous dagger  In a wanton bold epilogue ogle and swagger  Prove her past scenes of virtue are vapour and smoke  And the stage's morality merely a joke  Let her tell with what follies our country is curst  And wisely conclude that playwriting's the worst  Now serve to the public this olio complete  And puff in the papers your delicate treat  TO MISS SEWARD  On her being at EARTHAM in the variable Weather August  I  "WHENCE are these storms"an angry Poet cry'd  Who saw his shady summer haunts defac'd  Saw o'er his shatter'd grove black whirwinds ride  And loud lamented this untimely waste  II  He spoke and Aeolus uprear'd his head  Half his huge form round which dark clouds were driv'n  Rising from Ocean's broad and billowy bed  Fill'd up the vast expanse from earth to heav'n  III  As his fierce eye survey'd the rough profound  From the stern god the voice of anger broke  Air earth and sea reverberate the sound  And shrinking Nature shudder'd as he spoke  IV  "Know thou vain Bard within thy mansion dwells  "The wond'rous source of all this wild uproar  "Thence round my cave the din of discord swells  "And I my rebel offspring rule no more  V  "To own my laws my mad'ning sons refuse  "All all are deaf to my paternal pow'r  "Struggling alike to kiss that vagrant Muse  "Who deigns to visit thy sequester'd bow'r  VI  "Rough Boreas us'd in these still months to sleep  "Starts from his cell in passion's wild alarms  "While dripping Auster rushes from the deep  "To snatch the Fairone from his brother's arms  VII  "Each other's fond ambition to destroy  "Alike they struggle merciless as death  "See my young Zephyr Nature's tender joy  "Encounters Eurus with contentious breath  VIII  "Cease my rash sons this cruel war to wage  "Tho' tempting beauty gave your conflict birth  "Lest Famine waken'd by your frantic rage  "Stalk in fell triumph o'er the blasted earth  IX  "See shiv'ring mortals mourn th' inverted year  "While Ceres weeps her golden pride deprest  "If ye no longer Nature's law revere  "Yet mildly listen to your sire's request  X  "Let each in order taste the tempting bliss  "For which these mutual wounds ye vainly bear  "Each unmolested take one precious kiss  "And freely clasp this phrenzykindling Fair"  XI  He paus'dblack Boreas eldest of his race  Whose stormy passion the chill Maiden shocks  Binds her reluctant in his strong embrace  And sports licentious in her auburn locks  XII  Eurus succeeds of less disgusting mien  Yet mad the trembling Fairone to assail  Beneath his pressure more intensely keen  The wounded ruby of her lip grows pale  XIII  Next with mild charms and less tumultuous love  By melting Auster see the Nymph carest  He with the softness of the murm'ring dove  Waves his moist pinions o'er her softer breast  XIV  Now lively Zephyr the sweet Muse is thine  O long embrace her in our laughing skies  And round her bid this joyous landscape shine  Rich as her verse and radiant as her eyes  CONTENT  Written at the request of a Lady for the Vase at BATHEASTON  "HOW idle are mortals" said Wisdom to Youth  "They slight the clear dictates of Reason and Truth  "They worship Ambition to Pleasure they bend  "Yet blindly o'erlook a more excellent friend  "And hence their vain hopes are eternally crost  "Their life in a tempest of wishes is lost  "Still destin'd to toil and of toil to repent  "For neglect of just vows to the Goddess Content  "That Goddess from whom all felicity flows  "Who unites every good in the gift she bestows  "So free of her bounty to all who confess it  "To solicit her smile is almost to possess it"  When I heard this fine speech my fond passion was rais'd  And I set forth in quest of the Being so prais'd  At the mansion of Grandeur my search I begin  And ask if the Goddess Content is within  But Pride who as centinel guarded the door  Said bluntly he ne'er heard her title before  He told me I wanted a poor rustic slut  And bade me go look in some little thatch'd hut  I march'd to the Villager's lowly abode  'Twas a snug pretty cottage and stood near the road  And here a good woman possessing tho' humble  A face that could frown and a tongue that would grumble  Saidthe person I ask'd for had lodg'd in her cot  But alas such good luck was no longer her lot  For she quitted her roof where she oft had repos'd  When you great house was built and the common inclos'd  I conceiv'd as I now bade the village farewell  With the mild sons of Science this Goddess must dwell  But those where I sought some obliging instructor  Were squabbling about an electric conductor  Some cry'd up the point some commended the ball  The soft breath of Science was turn'd to a squall  The Sages no mental conductor could find  To draw off the flame that now flash'd on their mind  In haste I exclaim'd to the Learned adieu  For even Science offends when she talks like a shrew  Having wander'd so wide of the object I sought  I was now led to think and rejoic'd at the thought  This Goddess herself for her charms so renown'd  With the daughters of Beauty must surely be found  With this hope I approach'd unperceiv'd by them all  Three lovely young girls just array'd for the ball  In each whose bright eyes on a mirror were bent  I thought I discover'd a spark of Content  But watching them more in their beautiful faces  Of the goddess I sought I no more saw the traces  For as they survey'd with a critical glance  The elegant MONTAGU move in the dance  In her exquisite figure such graces were shewn  That viewing her charms they distrusted their own  Thou gentlest of nymphs while thy triumphs increase  Unconscious of beauty so fatal to peace  Tho' the sparks of Content in one sex thou may'st smother  Bright Ecstasy's flame thou wilt raise in the other  If in bosom parental Content could reside  The heart of thy parent this treasure must hide  But alas 'tis a truth which all parents lament  Their tender anxiety stifles Content  O tell me while vainly to find thee I pant  Dear latent Divinity where is thy haunt  "Away to Batheaston" Goodnature replies  "Behold she there weaves the poetical prize"  With thy Myrtle kind MILLER O let me be crown'd  Then my search is repaid and the Goddess is found  Nay if to another your wreath you assign  And give it to verse far superior to mine  My search's dear object I still must attain  And the proof of this wonder's exceedingly plain  It rests on this maxim by Horace invented  The Bard who writes worst is the Bard most contented  My claim to this blessing thus made very clear  If I've nothing to hope I have nothing to fear  For MILLER can please while the mind she amuses  Both when she bestows and e'en when she refuses  In truth I suspect from her singular aim  The Goddess I seek is conceal'd by her name  She herself is Content and her house is the fane  Where Spleen and Illnature no favours obtain  Some mortals in vain for admission must pray  But all who once enter go smiling away  END
