 CATO A TRAGEDY  CATO A TRAGEDY As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL in  DruryLane  BY Her MAJESTY's Servants  By Mr  ADDISON  Ecce Spectaculum dignum ad quod respiciat intentus operi suo Deus Ecce par Deo dignum vir fortis cum malâ fortunâ compositus Non video inquam quid habeat in terris Jupiter pulchrius si convertere animum velit quàm ut spectet Catonem jam partibus non semel fractis nihilominùs inter ruinas publicas erectum  Sen de Divin Prov  LONDON  Printed for J TONSON at  Shakespear  's  Head  against  CatherineStreet  in the  Strand  MDCCXIII  PROLOGUE  By Mr  POPE  Spoken by Mr  Wilks  TO wake the Soul by tender Strokes of Art  To raise the Genius and to mend the Heart  To make Mankind in conscious Virtue bold  Live o'er each Scene and Be what they behold  For this the TragicMuse first trod the Stage  Commanding Tears to stream thro' every Age  Tyrants no more their Savage Nature kept  And Foes to Virtue wonder'd how they wept  Our Author shuns by vulgar Springs to move  The Hero's Glory or the Virgin's Love  In pitying Love we but our Weakness show  And wild Ambition well deserves its Woe  Here Tears shall slow from a more gen'rous Cause  Such Tears as Patriots shed for dying Laws  He bids your Breasts with Ancient Ardor rise  And calls forth  Roman  Drops from  British  Eyes  Virtue confess'd in human Shape he draws  What  Plato  Thought and Godlike  Cato  Was  No common Object to your Sight displays  But what with Pleasure Heav'n it self surveys  A brave Man struggling in the Storms of Fate  And greatly falling with a falling State  While  Cato  gives his little Senate Laws  What Bosom beats not in his Country's Cause  Who sees him act but envies ev'ry Deed  Who hears him groan and does not wish to bleed  Ev'n when proud  Caesar  'midst triumphal Cars  The Spoils of Nations and the Pomp of Wars  Ignobly Vain and impotently Great  Show'd  Rome  her  Cato  's Figure drawn in State  As her dead Father's rev'rend Image past  The Pomp was darken'd and the Day o'ercast  The Triumph ceas'dTears gush'd from ev'ry Eye  The World's great Victor past unheeded by  Her Last good Man dejected  Rome  ador'd  And honour'd  Caesar  's less than  Cato  's Sword  Britains  attend Be Worth like this approv'd  And show you have the Virtue to be mov'd  With honest Scorn the first fam'd  Cato  view'd  Rome  learning Arts from  Greece  whom she subdu'd  Our Scene precariously subsists too long  On  French  Translation and  Italian  Song  Dare to have Sense your selves Assert the Stage  Be justly warm'd with your own Native Rage  Such Plays alone should please a  British  Ear  As  Cato  's self had not disdain'd to hear  Dramatis Personae  MEN  CATO  Mr  Booth  Lueius  a Senator  Mr  Keen  Sempronius  a Senator  Mr  Mills  Juba  Prince of  Numidia  Mr  Wilks  Syphax  General of the  Numidians  Mr  Cibber  Sons of  Cato  Portius  Mr  Powell  Marcus  Mr  Ryan  Decius  Ambassador from  Caesar  Mr  Bowman  Mutineers Guards  c     WOMEN  Marcia  Daughter to Cato  Mrs  Oldfield  Lucia  Daughter to Lucius  Mrs  Porter  SCENE a large Hall in the Governor's Palace of  Utica  CATO  ACT I SCENE I  Portius Marcus  Por  THE Dawn is overcast the Morning low'rs  And heavily in Clouds brings on the Day  The great th' important Day big with the Fate  Of  Cato  and of  Rome  Our Father's Death  Would fill up all the Guilt of Civil War  And close the Scene of Blood Already  Caesar  Has ravaged more than half the Globe and sees  Mankind grown thin by his destructive Sword  Should he go further Numbers would be wanting  To form new Battels and support his Crimes  Ye Gods what Havock does Ambition make  Among your Works  Marc  Thy steddy Temper  Portius  Can look on Guilt Rebellion Fraud and  Caesar  In the calm Lights of mild Philosophy  I'm tortured ev'n to Madness when I think  On the proud Victor ev'ry time he's named  Pharsalia  rises to my ViewI see  Th' Insulting Tyrant prancing o'er the Field  Strow'd with  Rome  's Citizens and drench'd in Slaughter  His Horse's Hoofs wet with Patrician Blood  Oh  Portius  is there not some chosen Curse  Some hidden Thunder in the Stores of Heav'n  Red with uncommon Wrath to blast the Man  Who owes his Greatness to his Country's Ruin  Por  Believe me  Marcus  'tis an impious Greatness  And mixt with too much Horrour to be envy'd  How does the Lustre of our Father's Actions  Through the dark Cloud of IIIs that cover him  Break out and burn with more triumphant Brightness  His Suff'rings shine and spread a Glory round him  Greatly unfortunate he fights the Cause  Of Honour Virtue Liberty and  Rome  His Sword ne'er fell but on the Guilty Head  Oppression Tyranny and Pow'r usurp'd  Draw all the Vengeance of his Arm upon 'em  Marc  Who knows not this But what can  Cato  do  Against a World a base degenerate World  That court's the Yoke and bows the Neck to  Caesar  Pent up in  Utica  he vainly forms  A poor Epitome of  Roman  Greatness  And cover'd with  Numidian  Guards directs  A feeble Army and an empty Senate  Remnants of mighty Battels fought in vain  By Heav'ns such Virtues join'd with such Success  Distract my very Soul Our Father's Fortune  Wou'd almost tempt us to renounce his Precepts  Por  Remember what our Father oft has told us  The Ways of Heav'n are dark and intricate  Puzzled in Mazes and perplext with Errors  Our Understanding traces 'em in vain  Lost and bewilder'd in the fruitless Search  Nor sees with how much Art the Windings run  Nor where the regular Confusion ends  Marc  These are Suggestions of a Mind at Ease  Oh  Portius  didst thou taste but half the Griess  That wring my Soul thou cou'dst not talk thus calmly  Passion unpity'd and successless Love  Plant Daggers in my Heart and aggravate  My other Griefs Were but my  Lucia  kind  Por  Thou see'st not that thy Brother is thy Rival  But I must hide it for I know thy Temper  Aside  Now  Marcus  now thy Virtue's on the Proof  Put forth thy utmost Strength work ev'ry Nerve  And call up all thy Father in thy Soul  To quell the Tyrant Love and guard thy Heart  On this weak Side where most our Nature fails  Would be a Conquest worthy  Cato  's Son  Marc  Portius  the Council which I cannot take  Instead of healing but upbraids my Weakness  Bid me for Honour plunge into a War  Of thickest Foes and rush on certain Death  Then shalt thou see that  Marcus  is not slow  To follow Glory and confess his Father  Love is not to be reason'd down or lost  In high Ambition and a Thirst of Greatness  'Tis second Life it grows into the Soul  Warms ev'ry Vein and beats in ev'ry Pulse  I feel it here My Resolution melts  Por  Behold young  Juba  the  Numidian  Prince  With how much Care he forms himself to Glory  And breaks the Fierceness of his Native Temper  To copy out our Father's bright Example  He loves our Sister  Marcia  greatly loves her  His Eyes his Looks his Actions all betray it  But still the smother'd Fondness burns within him  When most it swells and labours for a Vent  Then Sense of Honour and Desire of Fame  Drive the big Passion back into his Heart  What shall an  African  shall  Juba  's Heir  Reproach great  Cato  's Son and show the World  A Virtue wanting in a  Roman  Soul  Marc  Portius  no more your Words leave Stings behind 'em  Whene're did  Juba  or did  Portius  show  A Virtue that has cast me at a Distance  And thrown me out in the Pursuits of Honour  Por  Marcus  I know thy generous Temper well  Fling but th' Appearance of Dishonour on it  It strait takes Fire and mounts into a Blaze  Marc  A Brother's Suff'rings claim a Brother's Pity  Por  Heav'n knows I pity thee Behold my Eyes  Ev'n whilst I speakDo they not swim in Tears  Were but my Heart as naked to thy View  Marcus  would see it bleed in his Behalf  Marc  Why then dost treat me with Rebukes instead  Of kind condoling Cares and friendly Sorrow  Por  O  Marcus  did I know the Way to ease  Thy troubled Heart and mitigate thy Pains  Marcus  believe me I could die to do it  Marc  Thou best of Brothers and thou best of Friends  Pardon a weak distemper'd Soul that swells  With sudden Gusts and sinks as soon in Calms  The Sport of PassionsBut  Sempronius  comes  He must not find this Softness hanging on me  Exit  SCENE II  Sempronius  solus  Conspiracies no sooner shou'd be form'd  Than executed What means  Portius  here  I like not that cold Youth I must dissemble  And speak a Language foreign to my Heart  Sempronius Portius  Semp  Good Morrow  Portius  let us once embrace  Once more embrace whilst yet we both are free  ToMorrow shou'd we thus express our Friendship  Each might receive a Slave into his Arms  This Sun perhaps this Morning Sun's the last  That e're shall rise on  Roman  Liberty  Por  My Father has this Morning call'd together  To this poor Hall his little  Roman  Senate  The Leavings of  Pharsalia  to consult  If yet he can oppose the mighty Torrent  That bears down  Rome  and all her Gods before it  Or must at length give up the World to  Caesar  Semp  Not all the Pomp and Majesty of  Rome  Can raise her Senate more than  Cato  's Presence  His Virtues render our Assembly awful  They strike with something like religious Fear  And make ev'n  Caesar  tremble at the Head  Of Armies flush'd with Conquest O my  Portius  Could I but call that wondrous Man my Father  Wou'd but thy Sister  Marcia  be propitious  To thy Friend's Vows I might be bless'd indeed  Por  Alas  Sempronius  wou'dst thou talk of Love  To  Marcia  whilst her Father's Life's in Danger  Thou might'st as well court the pale trembling Vestal  When she beholds the holy Flame expiring  Semp  The more I see the Wonders of thy Race  The more I'm charm'd Thou must take heed my  Portius  The World has all its Eyes on  Cato  's Son  Thy Father's Merit sets thee up to View  And shows thee in the fairest point of Light  To make thy Virtues or thy Faults conspicuous  Por  Well dost thou seem to check my Lingring here  On this important HourI'll strait away  And while the Fathers of the Senate meet  In close Debate to weigh th' Events of War  I'll animate the Soldier's drooping Courage  With Love of Freedom and Contempt of Life  I'll thunder in their Ears their Country's Cause  And try to rouse up all that's  Roman  in 'em  'Tis not in Mortals to command Success  But we'll do more  Sempronius  we'll deserve it  Exit  Sempronius  solus  Curse on the Stripling how he Ape's his Sire  Ambitiously sententiousBut I wonder  Old  Syphax  comes not his  Numidian  Genius  Is well disposed to Mischief were he prompt  And eager on it but he must be spurr'd  And ev'ry Moment quickned to the Course  Cato  has used me Ill He has refused  His Daughter  Marcia  to my ardent Vows  Besides his baffled Arms and ruined Cause  Are Barrs to my Ambition  Caesar  's Favour  That show'rs down Greatness on his Friends will raise me  To  Rome  's first Honours If I give up  Cato  I claim in my Reward his Captive Daughter  But  Syphax  comes  SCENE III  Syphax Sempronius  Syph    Sempronius  all is ready  I've sounded my  Numidians  Man by Man  And find 'em ripe for a Revolt They all  Complain aloud of  Cato  's Discipline  And wait but the Command to change their Master  Semp  Believe me  Syphax  there's no Time to waste  Ev'n whilst we speak our Conqueror comes on  And gathers Ground upon us ev'ry Moment  Alas thou know'st not  Caesar  's active Soul  With what a dreadful Course he rushes on  From War to War In vain has Nature form'd  Mountains and Oceans to oppose his Passage  He bound's o'er all victorious in his March  The  Alpes  and  Pyreneans  sink before him  Through Winds and Waves and Storms he works his way  Impatient for the Battel One Day more  Will set the Victor thundring at our Gates  But tell me hast thou yet drawn o'er young  Juba  That still wou'd recommend thee more to  Caesar  And challenge better Terms  Syph  Alas he's lost  He's lost  Sempronius  all his Thoughts are full  Of  Cato  's VirtuesBut I'll try once more  For ev'ry Instant I expect him here  If yet I can subdue those stubborn Principles  Of Faith of Honour and I know not what  That have corrupted his  Numidian  Temper  And struck th' Infection into all his Soul  Semp  Be sure to press upon him ev'ry Motive  Juba  's Surrender since his Father's Death  Would give up  Africk  into  Caesar's  Hands  And make him Lord of half the burning Zone  Syph  But is it true  Sempronius  that your Senate  Is call'd together Gods Thou must be cautious  Cato  has piercing Eyes and will discern  Our Frauds unless they're cover'd thick with Art  Semp  Let me alone good  Syphax  I'll conceal  My Thoughts in Passion 'tis the surest way  I'll bellow out for  Rome  and for my Country  And mouth at  Caesar  till I shake the Senate  Your cold Hypocrisie's a stale Device  A wornout Trick Wouldst thou be thought in Earnest  Cloath thy feign'd Zeal in Rage in Fire in Fury  Syph  In troth thou'rt able to instruct Greyhairs  And teach the wily  African  Deceit  Semp  Once more be sure to try thy Skill on  Juba  Mean while I'll hasten to my  Roman  Soldiers  Inflame the Mutiny and underhand  Blow up their Discontents till they break out  Unlook'd for and discharge themselves on  Cato  Remember  Syphax  we must work in Haste  O think what anxious Moments pass between  The Birth of Plots and their last fatal Periods  Oh 'tis a dreadful Interval of Time  Fill'd up with Horror all and big with Death  Destruction hangs on ev'ry Word we speak  On ev'ry Thought 'till the concluding Stroke  Determines all and closes our Design  Exit  Syphax  solus  I'll try if yet I can reduce to Reason  This headstrong Youth and make him spurn at  Cato  The Time is short  Caesar  comes rushing on us  But hold young  Juba  sees me and approaches  SCENE IV  Juba Syphax  Jub  Syphax  I joy to meet thee thus alone  I have observed of late thy Looks are fall'n  O'ercast with gloomy Cares and Discontent  Then tell me  Syphax  I conjure thee tell me  What are the Thoughts that knit thy Brow in Frowns  And turn thine Eye thus coldly on thy Prince  Syph  'Tis not my Talent to conceal my Thoughts  Nor carry Smiles and Sunshine in my Face  When Discontent sits heavy at my Heart  I have not yet so much the  Roman  in me  Jub  Why do'st thou cast out such ungen'rous Terms  Against the Lords and Sov'reigns of the World  Dost thou not see Mankind fall down before 'em  And own the Force of their Superior Virtue  Is there a Nation in the Wilds of  Africk  Amidst our barren Rocks and burning Sands  That does not tremble at the  Roman  Name  Syph  Gods where's the Worth that sets this People up  Above your own  Numidia  's tawny Sons  Do they with tougher Sinews bend the Bow  Or flies the Javelin swifter to its Mark  Launch'd from the Vigour of a  Roman  Arm  Who like our active  African  instructs  The fiery Steed and trains him to his Hand  Or guide's in Troops th' embattled Elephant  Loaden with War These these are Arts my Prince  In which your  Zama  does not stoop to  Rome  Jub  These all are Virtues of a meaner Rank  Perfections that are placed in Bones and Nerves  A  Roman  Soul is bent on higher Views  To civilize the rude unpolish'd World  And lay it under the Restraint of Laws  To make Man mild and sociable to Man  To cultivate the wild licentious Savage  With Wisdom Discipline and lib'ral Arts  Th' Embellishments of Life Virtues like these  Make Human Nature shine reform the Soul  And break our fierce Barbarians into Men  Syph  Patience kind Heav'nsExcuse an old Man's warmth  What are these wond'rous civilizing Arts  This  Roman  Polish and this smooth Behaviour  That render Man thus tractable and tame  Are they not only to disguise our Passions  To set our Looks at variance with our Thoughts  To check the Starts and Sallies of the Soul  And break off all its Commerce with the Tongue  In short to change us into other Creatures  Than what our Nature and the Gods design'd us  Jub  To strike thee Dumb Turn up thy Eyes to  Cato  There may'st thou see to what a Godlike Height  The  Roman  Virtues lift up mortal Man  While good and just and anxious for his Friends  He's still severely bent against himself  Renouncing Sleep and Rest and Food and Ease  He strives with Thirst and Hunger Toil and Heat  And when his Fortune sets before him all  The Pomps and Pleasures that his Soul can wish  His rigid Virtue will accept of none  Syph  Believe me Prince there's not an  African  That traverses our vast  Numidian  Desarts  In quest of Prey and lives upon his Bow  But better practises these boasted Virtues  Coarse are his Meals the Fortune of the Chase  Amidst the running Stream he slakes his Thirst  Toil's all the Day and at th' approach of Night  On the first friendly Bank he throws him down  Or rests his Head upon a Rock 'till Morn  Then rises fresh pursues his wonted Game  And if the following Day he chance to find  A new Repast or an untasted Spring  Blesses his Stars and thinks it Luxury  Jub  Thy Prejudices  Syphax  won't discern  What Virtues grow from Ignorance and Choice  Nor how the Hero differs from the Brute  But grant that others cou'd with equal Glory  Look down on Pleasures and the Baits of Sense  Where shall we find the Man that bears Affliction  Great and Majestick in his Griefs like  Cato  Heav'ns with what Strength what Steadiness of Mind  He Triumphs in the midst of all his Sufferings  How does he rise against a Load of Woes  And thank the Gods that throw the Weight upon him  Syph  'Tis Pride rank Pride and Haughtiness of Soul  I think the  Romans  call it  Stoicism  Had not your Royal Father thought so highly  Of  Roman  Virtue and of  Cato  's Cause  He had not fall'n by a Slave's Hand inglorious  Nor would his slaughter'd Army now have lain  On  Africk  's Sands disfigut'd with their Wounds  To gorge the Wolves and Vultures of  Numidia  Jub  Why do'st thou call my Sorrows up afresh  My Father's Name brings Tears into my Eyes  Syph  Oh that you'd profit by your Father's ills  Jub  What wou'dst thou have me do  Syph  Abandon  Cato  Jub  Syphax  I shou'd be more than twice an Orphan  By such a Loss  Syph  Ay there's the Tie that binds you  You long to call him Father  Marcia  's Charms  Work in your Heart unseen and plead for  Cato  No wonder you are deaf to all I say  Jub  Syphax  your Zeal becomes importunate  I've hitherto permitted it to rave  And talk at large but learn to keep it in  Least it should take more Freedom than I'll give it  Syph  Sir your great Father never used me thus  Alas he's Dead But can you e'er forget  The tender Sorrows and the Pangs of Nature  The fond Embraces and repeated Blessings  Which you drew from him in your last Farewel  Still must I cherish the dear sad Remembrance  At once to torture and to please my Soul  The good old King at parting wrung my Hand  His Eyes brimfull of Tears then sighing cry'd  Prithee be careful of my Sonhis Grief  Swell'd up so high he could not utter more  Jub  Alas thy Story melts away my Soul  That best of Fathers how shall I discharge  The Gratitude and Duty which I owe him  Syph  By laying up his Councils in your Heart  Jub  His Councils bade me yield to thy Directions  Then  Syphax  chide me in severest Terms  Vent all thy Passion and I'll stand its shock  Calm and unruffled as a SummerSea  When not a Breath of Wind flic's o'er its Surface  Syph  Alas my Prince I'd guide you to your Safety  Jub  I do believe thou wou'dst but tell me how  Syph  Fly from the Fate that follows  Caesar  's Foes  Jub  My Father scorn'd to do't  Syph  And therefore dy'd  Jub  Better to die ten thousand thousand Deaths  Than wound my Honour  Syph  Rather say your Love  Jub  Syphax  I've promis'd to preserve my Temper  Why wilt thou urge me to confess a Flame  I long have stifled and wou'd fain conceal  Syph  Believe me Prince 'tis hard to conquer Love  But easie to divert and break its Force  Absence might cure it or a second Mistress  Light up another Flame and put out this  The glowing Dames of  Zama  's Royal Court  Have Faces flusht with more exalted Charms  The Sun that rolls his Chariot o'er their Heads  Works up more Fire and Colour in their Cheeks  Were you with these my Prince you'd soon forget  The pale unripen'd Beauties of the  North  Jub  'Tis not a Sett of Features or Complexion  The Tincture of a Skin that I admire  Beauty soon grows familiar to the Lover  Fades in his Eye and palls upon the Sense  The virtuous  Marcia  tow'rs above her Sex  True she is fair Oh how divinely fair  But still the lovely Maid improves her Charms  With inward Greatness unaffected Wisdom  And Sanctity of Manners  Cato  's Soul  Shines out in every thing she acts or speaks  While winning Mildness and attractive Smiles  Dwell in her Looks and with becoming Grace  Soften the Rigour of her Father's Virtues  Syph  How does your Tongue grow wanton in her Praise  But on my Knees I beg you wou'd consider  Enter  Marcia  and  Lucia  Jub  Hah  Syphax  is't not sheShe moves this Way  And with her  Lucia Lucius  's fair Daughter  My Heart beats thickI prithee  Syphax  leave me  Syph  Ten thousand Curses fasten on 'em both  Now will this Woman with a single Glance  Undo what I've been lab'ring all this while  Exit  Juba Marcia Lucia  Jub  Hail charming Maid how does thy Beauty smooth  The Face of War and make ev'n Horror smile  At Sight of thee my Heart shakes off its Sorrows  I feel a Dawn of Joy break in upon me  And for a while forget th' Approach of  Caesar  Mac  I shou'd be griev'd young Prince to think my Presence  Unbent your Thoughts and slacken'd 'em to Arms  While warm with Slaughter our victorious Foe  Threatens aloud and calls you to the Field  Jub  O  Marcia  let me hope thy kind Concerns  And gentle Wishes follow me to Battel  The Thought will give new Vigour to my Arm  Add Strength and Weight to my descending Sword  And drive it in a Tempest on the Foe  Marc  My Prayers and Wishes always shall attend  The Friends of  Rome  the glorious Cause of Virtue  And Men approv'd of by the Gods and  Cato  Jub  That  Juba  may deserve thy pious Cares  I'll gaze for ever on thy Godlike Father  Transplanting one by one into my Life  His bright Perfections 'till I shine like him  Marc  My Father never at a Time like this  Wou'd lay out his great Soul in Words and waste  Such precious Moments  Jub  Thy Reproofs are just  Thou virtuous Maid I'll hasten to my Troops  And fire their languid Souls with  Cato  's Virtue  If e're I lead them to the Field when all  The War shall stand ranged in its just Array  And dreadful Pomp Then will I think on thee  O lovely Maid Then will I think on Thee  And in the shock of charging Hosts remember  What glorious Deeds shou'd grace the Man who hopes  For  Marcia  's Love  Exit  Luc  Marcia  you're too severe  How cou'd you chide the young goodnatured Prince  And drive him from you with so stern an Air  A Prince that loves and dotes on you to Death  Mar  'Tis therefore  Lucia  that I chide him from me  His Air his Voice his Looks and honest Soul  Speak all so movingly in his Behalf  I dare not trust my self to hear him talk  Luc  Why will you fight against so sweet a Passion  And steel your Heart to such a World of Charms  Mar  How  Lucia  wou'dst thou have me sink away  In pleasing Dreams and lose my self in Love  When ev'ry moment  Cato  's Life's at Stake  Caesar  comes arm'd with Terror and Revenge  And aims his Thunder at my Father's Head  Shou'd not the sad Occasion swallow up  My other Cares and draw them all into it  Luc  Why have not I this Constancy of Mind  Who have so many Griefs to try its Force  Sure Nature form'd me of her softest Mould  Enfeebled all my Soul with tender Passions  And sunk me ev'n below my own weak Sex  Pity and Love by turns oppress my Heart  Mar  Lucia  disburthen all thy Cares on me  And let me share thy most retired Distress  Tell me who raises up this Conflict in thee  Luc  I need not blush to name them when I tell thee  They're  Marcia  's Brothers and the Sons of  Cato  Mar  They both behold thee with their Sister's Eyes  And often have reveal'd their Passion to me  But tell me whose Address thou favour'st most  I long to know and yet I dread to hear it  Luc  Which is it  Marcia  wishes for  Mar  For neither  And yet for bothThe Youths have equal Share  In  Marcia  's Wishes and divide their Sister  But tell me which of them is  Lucia  's Choice  Luc  Marcia  they both are high in my Esteem  But in my LoveWhy wilt thou make me name him  Thou know'st it is a blind and foolish Passion  Pleas'd and disgusted with it knows not what  Mar  O  Lucia  I'm perplex'd O tell me which  I must hereafter call my happy Brother  Luc  Suppose 'twere  Portius  cou'd you blame my Choice  O  Portius  thou hast stol'n away my Soul  With what a graceful Tenderness he loves  And breath's the softest the sincerest Vows  Complacency and Truth and manly Sweetness  Dwell ever on his Tongue and smooth his Thoughts  Marcus  is overwarm his fond Complaints  Have so much Earnestness and Passion in them  I hear him with a secret kind of Dread  And tremble at his Vehemence of Temper  Mar  Alas poor Youth how can'st thou throw him from thee  Lucia  thou know'st not half the Love he bears thee  Whene'er he speaks of thee his Heart's in Flames  He sends out all his Soul in ev'ry Word  And thinks and talks and looks like one transported  Unhappy Youth how will thy Coldness raise  Tempests and Storms in his afflicted Bosom  I dread the Consequence  Luc  You seem to plead  Against your Brother  Portius    Mar  Heav'n forbid  Had  Portius  been the unsuccessful Lover  The same Compassion wou'd have fall'n on him  Luc  Was ever Virgin Love distrest like mine  Portius  himself oft falls in Tears before me  As if he mourn'd his Rival's ill Success  Then bids me hide the Motions of my Heart  Nor show which Way it turns So much he fears  The sad Effects that it would have on  Marcus  Mar  He knows too well how easily he's fired  And wou'd not plunge his Brother in Despair  But waits for happier Times and kinder Moments  Luc  Alas too late I find my self involved  In endless Griefs and Labyrinths of Woe  Born to afflict my  Marcia  's Family  And sow Dissention in the Hearts of Brothers  Tormenting Thought it cuts into my Soul  Mar  Let us not  Lucia  aggravate our Sorrows  But to the Gods permit th' Event of Things  Our Lives discolour'd with our present Woes  May still grow bright and smile with happier Hours  So the pure limpid Stream when foul with Stains  Of rushing Torrents and descending Rains  Work's it self clear and as it runs refines  'Till by Degrees the floating Mirrour shines  Reflects each Flow'r that on the Border grows  And a new Heav'n in its fair Bosom shows  Exeunt  End of the First Act  ACT II SCENE I  The Senate  Sem  ROME  still survives in this assembled Senate  Let us remember we are  Cato  's Friends  And act like Men who claim that glorious Title  Luc  Cato  will soon be here and open to us  Th' Occasion of our Meeting Heark he comes  A Sound of Trumpets  May all the Guardian Gods of  Rome  direct him  Enter  Cato  Cato  Fathers we once again are met in Council  Caesar  's Approach has summon'd us together  And  Rome  attends her Fate from our Resolves  How shall we treat this bold aspiring Man  Success still follows him and backs his Crimes  Pharsalia  gave him  Rome Egypt  has since  Receiv'd his Yoke and the whole  Nile  is  Caesar  's  Why should I mention  Juba  's Overthrow  And  Scipio  's Death  Numidia  's burning Sands  Still smoak with Blood 'Tis time we should decree  What Course to take Our Foe advances on us  And envies us ev'n  Libya  's sultry Desarts  Fathers pronounce your Thoughts are they still fixt  To hold it out and fight it to the last  Or are your Hearts subdu'd at length and wrought  By Time and ill Success to a Submission  Sempronius  speak  Semp  My Voice is still for War  Gods can a  Roman  Senate long debate  Which of the two to chuse Slav'ry or Death  No let us rise at once gird on our Swords  And at the Head of our remaining Troops  Attack the Foe break through the thick Array  Of his throng'd Legions and charge home upon him  Perhaps some Arm more lucky than the rest  May reach his Heart and free the World from Bondage  Rise Fathers rise 'tis  Rome  demands your Help  Rise and revenge her slaughter'd Citizens  Or share their Fate The Corps of half her Senate  Manure the Fields of  Thessaly  while we  Sit here delib'rating in cold Debates  If we should sacrifice our Lives to Honour  Or wear them out in Servitude and Chains  Rouse up for Shame our Brothers of  Pharsalia  Point at their Wounds and cry aloudTo Battel  Great  Pompey  's Shade complain's that we are slow  And  Scipio  's Ghost walk's unrevenged amongst us  Cato  Let not a Torrent of impetuous Zeal  Transport thee thus beyond the Bounds of Reason  True Fortitude is seen in great Exploits  That Justice warrant's and that Wisdom guide's  All else is tow'ring Frenzy and Distraction  Are not the Lives of those who draw the Sword  In  Rome  's Defence entrusted to our Care  Should we thus lead them to a Field of Slaughter  Might not th' impartial World with Reason say  We lavisht at our Deaths the Blood of Thousands  To grace our Fall and make our Ruin glorious  Lucius  we next would know what's your Opinion  Luc  My Thoughts I must confess are turn'd on Peace  Already have our Quarrels fill'd the World  With Widows and with Orphans  Seythia  mourn's  Our guilty Wars and Earth's remotest Regions  Lie half unpeopled by the Feuds of  Rome  'Tis time to sheath the Sword and spare Mankind  It is not  Caesar  but the Gods my Fathers  The Gods declare against us and repell  Our vain Attempts To urge the Foe to Battel  Prompted by blind Revenge and wild Despair  Were to refuse th' Awards of Providence  And not to rest in Heav'ns Determination  Already have we shown our Love to  Rome  Now let us show Submission to the Gods  We took up Arms not to revenge our selves  But free the Commonwealth when this End fail's  Arms have no further Use Our Country's Cause  That drew our

Rome  fall a Moment ere her time  No let us draw her Term of Freedom out  In its full Length and spin it to the last  So shall we gain still one Day's Liberty  And let me perish but in  Cato  's Judgment  A Day an Hour of virtuous Liberty  Is worth a whole Eternity in Bondage  Enter  Marcus  Marc  Fathers this Moment as I watch'd the Gates  Lodg'd on my Post a Herald is arrived  From  Caesar

Disdain's a Life which he has Pow'r to offer  Dec  Rome  and Her Senators submit to  Caesar  Her Gen'rals and her Consuls are no more  Who check'd his Conquests and denied his Triumphs  Why will not  Cato  be this  Caesar  's Friend  Cato  Those very Reasons thou hast urged forbid it  Dec  Cato  I've Orders to expostulate  And reason with you as from Friend to Friend  Think on the Storm that

Eyes on  Cato  As on the Second of Mankind  Cato  No more  I must not think of Life on such Conditions  Dec  Caesar  is well acquainted with your Virtues  And therefore sets this Value on your Life  Let him but know the Price of  Cato  's Friendship  And name your Terms  Cato  Bid him disband his Legions  Restore the Commonwealth to Liberty  Submit his Actions to the Publick Censure  And stand the Judgment of a  Roman  Senate  Bid him do this and  Cato  is his Friend  Dec  Cato  the World talk's loudly of your Wisdom  Cato  Nay more tho'  Cato  's Voice was ne'er employ'd  To clear the Guilty and to varnish Crimes  My self will mount the  Rostrum  in his Favour  And strive to gain his Pardon from the People  Dec  A Stile like this become's a Conqueror  Cato  Decius  a Stile like

insolent and vain  Presumptuous Man The Gods take Care of  Cato  Wou'd  Caesar  show the Greatness of his Soul  Bid him employ his Care for these my Friends  And make good use of his illgotten Pow'r  By sheltring Men much better than himself  Dec  Your high unconquer'd Heart make's you forget  That you're a Man You rush on your Destruction  But I have done When I relate hereafter  The Tale of this

Rome  I stand reproved  Cato  Fathers 'tis time you come to a Resolve  Luc  Cato  we all go into your Opinion  Caesar  's Behaviour has convinced the Senate  We ought to hold it out till Terms arrive  Semp  We ought to hold it out till Death but  Cato  My private Voice is drown'd amid the Senate's  Cato  Then let us rise my Friends and strive to fill  This little Interval this Pause of Life  While

Numidian  Prince  Comes forward and expects to know our Councils  Ex Senators  Enter  Juba  Cato  Juba  the  Roman  Senate has resolv'd  Till Time give better Prospects still to keep  The Sword unsheath'd and turn its Edge on  Caesar  Jub  The Resolution fit's a  Roman  Senate  But  Cato  lend me for a while thy Patience  And condescend to hear a young Man speak  My Father when some Days

shall befall thy Father  Be  Cato  's Friend he'll train thee up to Great  And Virtuous Deeds Do but observe him well  Thou'lt shun Misfortunes or thou'lt learn to bear 'em  Cato  Juba  thy Father was a worthy Prince  And merited alas a better Fate  But Heav'n thought otherwise  Juba  My Father's Fate  In spight of all the Fortitude that shine's  Before my Face in  Cato  's great Example  Subdue's my Soul and fill's my Eyes with Tears  Cato  It is an honest Sorrow and becomes thee  Juba  My Father drew Respect from foreign Climes  The Kings of  Africk  sought him for their Friend  Kings far

Numidia  in our Cause and court  Th' Assistance of my Father's pow'rful Friends  Did they know  Cato  our remotest Kings  Wou'd pour embattled Multitudes about him  Their swarthy Hosts would darken all our Plains  Doubling the native Horrour of the War  And making Death more grim  Cato  And canst thou think  Cato  will fly before the Sword of  Caesar  Reduced like  Hannibal  to seek Relief  From Court to Court and wander up and down  A Vagabond in  Africk  Jub  Cato  perhaps  I'm too officious but my forward Cares  Wou'd fain preserve a Life of so much Value  My Heart is wounded when I soe such Virtue  Afflicted by the Weight of such Misfortunes  Cato  Thy Nobleness of Soul obliges me  But know young Prince that Valour soar's above  What the World calls Misfortune and Affliction  These are not Ills else wou'd they never fall  On Heav'ns first Fav'rites and the best of Men  The Gods in Bounty work up Storms about us  That give Mankind Occasion to exert  Their hidden Strength and throw out into Practice  Virtues that shun the Day and lie conceal'd  In the smooth Seasons and the Calms of Life  Jub  I'm charm'd when e'er thou talk'st I pant for Virtue  And all my Soul endeavours

practis'd with him  And found a Means to let the Victor know  That  Syphax  and  Sempronius  are his Friends  But let me now examine in my Turn  Is  Juba  fixt  Syph  Yes but it is to  Cato  I've

pointed out my  Portius  to me  And early taught me by her secret Force  To love thy Person 'ere I knew thy Merit  Till what was Instinct grew up into Friendship  Port  Marcus  the Friendships of the World are oft  Confed'racies in Vice or Leagues of Pleasure  Ours has severest Virtue for its Basis  And such a Friendship end's not but with Life  Marc  Portius  thou know'st my Soul in all its Weakness  Then prithee spare me on its tender Side  Indulge me but in Love my other Passions  Shall rise and fall by Virtue's nicest Rules  Port  When Love's well timed 'tis not a Fault to love  The Strong the Brave the Virtuous and the Wise  Sink in the soft Captivity together  I wou'd not urge thee to dismiss thy Passion  I know 'twere vain but to suppress its Force  Till better Times may make it look more graceful  Marc  Alas thou talk'st like one who never felt  Th' impatient Throbbs and Longings of a Soul  That pant's and reache's after distant Good  A Lover do's not live by vulgar Time  Believe me  Portius  in my  Lucia  's Absence  Life hang's upon me and become's a Burden  And yet when I behold the charming Maid  I'm tentimes more undone while Hope and Fear  And Grief and Rage and Love rise up at once  And with Variety of Pain distract me  Port  What can thy  Portius  do to give thee Help  Marc  Portius  thou oft enjoy'st the Fair One's Presence  Then undertake my Cause and plead it to her  With all the Strength and Heats of Eloquence  Fraternal Love and Friendship can inspire  Tell her thy Brother languishe's to Death  And fade's away and wither's in his Bloom  That he forgets his Sleep and loath's his Food  That Youth and Health and War are joyless to him  Describe his anxious Days and restless Nights  And all the Torments that thou see'st me suffer  Port  Marcus  I beg thee give me not an Office  That suits with me so ill Thou know'st my Temper  Marc  Wilt thou behold me sinking in my Woes  And wilt thou not reach out a friendly Arm  To raise me from amidst this Plunge of Sorrows  Port  Marcus  thou can'st not ask what I'd refuse  But here believe me I've a thousand Reasons  Marc  I know thou'lt say my Passion's out of Season  That  Cato  's great Example and Misfortunes  Should both conspire to drive it from my Thoughts  But what's all this to one who loves like me  Oh  Portius Portius  from my Soul I wish  Thou didst but know thy self what 'tis to love  Then wou'dst thou pity and assist thy Brother  Port  What shou'd I do If I disclose my Passion  Our Friendship's at an end If I conceal it  The World will call me false to a Friend and

 Enter  Lucia  Luc  Did not I see your Brother  Marcus  here  Why did he fly the Place and shun my Presence  Port  Oh  Lucia  Language is too faint to show  His Rage of Love it prey's upon his Life  He pines he sickens he despairs he dies  His Passions and his Virtues lie confused  And mixt together in so wild a Tumult  That the whole Man is quite disfigur'd in him  Heav'ns wou'd one think 'twere possible for Love  To make such Ravage in a noble Soul  Oh  Lucia  I'm distress'd my Heart bleeds for him  Ev'n now while thus I stand blest in thy Presence  A secret Damp of Grief comes o'er my Thoughts  And I'm unhappy tho' thou smilest upon me  Luc  How wilt thou guard thy Honour in the Shock  Of Love and Friendship think betimes my  Portius  Think how the Nuptial Tie that might ensure  Our mutual Bliss wou'd raise to such a Height  Thy Brother's Griefs as might perhaps destroy him  Port  Alas poor Youth what dost thou think my  Lucia  His gen'rous open undesigning Heart  Has beg'd his Rival to sollicit for him  Then do not strike him dead with a Denial  But hold him up in Life and cheer his Soul  With the faint glimm'ring of a doubtful Hope  Perhaps when we have pass'd these gloomy Hours  And weather'd out the Storm that beats upon us  Luc  No  Portius  no I see thy Sister's Tears  Thy Father's Anguish and thy Brother's Death  In the Pursuit of our illfated Loves  And  Portius  here I swear to Heav'n I swear  To Heav'n and all the Pow'rs that judge Mankind  Never to mix my plighted Hands with thine  While such a Cloud of Mischiefs hang's about us  But to forget our Loves and drive thee out  From all my Thoughts as faras I am able  Port  What hast thou said I'm thunderstruckRecall  Those hasty Words or I am lost for ever  Luc  Has not the Vow already pass'd my Lips  The Gods have heard it and 'tis seal'd in Heav'n  May all the Vengeance that was ever pour'd  On perjur'd Heads o'erwhelm me if I break it  After a Pause  Port  Fixt in Astonishment I gaze upon

those Sounds  Those killing Sounds Why dost thou frown upon me  My Blood run's cold my Heart forget's to heave  And Life its self goe's out at thy Displeasure  The Gods forbid us to indulge our Loves  But oh I cannot bear thy Hate and live  Port  Talk not of Love thou never knew'st its Force  I've been deluded led into a Dream  Of fancied Bliss O  Lucia  cruel Maid  Thy dreadful Vow loaden with Death still sound's  In my stunn'd Ears What shall I say or do  Quick let us part Perdition's in thy Presence  And Horror dwells about theeHah she faints  Wretch that I am what has my Rashness done

Faith of one expiring at thy Feet  That love's thee more than ever Woman lov'd  What do I say My halfrecover'd Sense  Forget's the Vow in which my Soul is bound  Destruction stand's betwixt us We must part  Port  Name not the Word my frighted Thoughts run back  And startle into Madness at the Sound  Luc  What wou'dst thou have me do Consider well  The Train of Ills our Love wou'd draw behind it  Think  Portius  think thou see'st thy dying Brother  Stabb'd at his Heart and all besmear'd with Blood  Storming at Heav'n and thee Thy awful Sire  Sternly demand's the Cause th' accursed Cause  That robb's him of his Son poor  Marcia  tremble's  Then teares her Hair and frantick in her Griefs  Call's out on  Lucia  What cou'd  Lucia  answer  Or how stand up in such a Scene of Sorrow  Port  To my Confusion and Eternal Grief  I must approve the Sentence that destroys me  The Mist that hung about my Mind clear's up  And now athwart the Terrors that thy Vow  Has planted round thee thou appear'st more fair  More amiable and risest in thy Charms  Lovly'st of Women Heav'n is in thy Soul  Beauty and Virtue shine for ever round thee  Bright'ning each other Thou art all Divine  Luc  Portius  no

Head once more might  Rome  Assert her Rights and claim her Liberty  But heark What mean's that Groan O give me way  And let me fly into my Father's Presence  Luc  Cato  amidst his Slumbers thinks on  Rome  And in the wild Disorder of his Soul  Mourn's o'er his Country Hah a second Groan  Heav'n guard us all  Marc  Alas 'tis not the Voice  Of one who sleep's 'tis agonizing Pain  'Tis Death is in that Sound  Reenter  Portius  Port  O Sight of Woe  O  Marcia  what we fear'd is come to pass  Cato  is fall'n upon his Sword  Luc  O  Portius  Hide all the Horrours of thy mournful Tale  And let us guess the rest  Port  I've rais'd him up  And placed him in his Chair where pale and faint  He gasp's for Breath and as his Life flow's from him  Demand's to see his Friends  His weeping Servants  Obsequious to his Orders bear him hither  The Back Scene opens and discovers  Cato  Marc  O Heav'n assist me in this dreadful Hour  To pay the last sad Duties to my Father  Juba  These are thy Triumphs thy Exploits O  Caesar  Luc  Now is  Rome  fall'n indeed    Cato  brought forward in his Chair  Cato  Here set me down  Portius  come near meare my Friends embark'd  Can any thing be thought of for their Service  Whilst I yet live let me not live in vain  O  Lucius  art thou hereThou art too good  Let this our Friendship live between our Children  Make  Portius  happy in thy Daughter  Lucia  Alas poor Man he weeps  Marcia  my Daughter  O bend me forward  Juba  loves thee  Marcia  A Senator of  Rome  while  Rome  survived  Wou'd not have match'd his Daughter with a King  But  Caesar  's Arms have thrown down all Distinction  Whoe'er is Brave and Virtuous is a  Roman    I'm sick to DeathO when shall I get loose  From this vain World th' Abode of Guilt and Sorrow  And yet methinks a Beam of Light breaks in  On my departing Soul Alas I fear  I've been too hasty O ye Pow'rs that search  The Heart of Man and weigh his inmost Thoughts  If I have done amiss impute it not  The best may Erre but you are Good andoh  Dies  Luc  There fled the greatest Soul that ever warm'd  A  Roman  Breast O  Cato  O my Friend  Thy Will shall be religiously observ'd  But let us bear this awful Corps to  Caesar  And lay it in his Sight that it may stand  A Fence betwixt us and the Victor's Wrath  Cato  tho' dead shall still protect his Friends  From hence let fierce contending Nations know  What dire Effects from Civil Discord flow  'Tis this that shakes our Country with Alarms  And gives up  Rome  a Prey to  Roman  Arms  Produces Fraud and Cruelty and Strife  And robb's the Guilty World of  Cato  's Life  Exeunt Omnes  End of the Fifth Act  EPILOGUE  By Dr  GARTH  Spoken by Mrs  Porter  WHAT odd fantastick Things we Women do  Who wou'd not listen when young Lovers woo  But die a Maid yet have the Choice of Two  Ladies are often cruel to their Cost  To give you Pain themselves they punish most  Vows of Virginity shou'd well be weigh'd  Too oft they're cancell'd tho' in Convents made  Wou'd you revenge such rash Resolvesyou may  Be spightfuland believe the thing we say  We hate you when you're easily said Nay  How needless if you knew us were your Fears  Let Love have Eyes and Beauty will have Ears  Our Hearts are form'd as you your selves wou'd chuse  Too proud to ask too humble to refuse  We give to Merit and to Wealth we sell  He sighs with most Success that settles well  The Woes of Wedlock with the Joys we mix  'Tis best repenting in a Coach and six  Blame not our Conduct since we but pursue  Those lively Lessons we have learn'd from you  Your Breasts no more the Fire of Beauty warms  But wicked Wealth usurps the Power of Charms  What Pains to get the Gaudy Thing you hate  To swell in Show and be a Wretch in State  At Plays you ogle at the Ring you bow  Even Churches are no Sanctuaries now  There golden Idols all your Vows receive  She is no Goddess that has nought to give  Oh may once more the happy Age appear  When Words were artless and the Thoughts sincere  When Gold and Grandeur were unenvy'd Things  And Courts less coveted than Groves and Springs  Love then shall only mourn when Truth complains  And Constancy feel Transport in its Chains  Sighs with Success their own soft Anguish tell  And Eyes shall utter what the Lips conceal  Virtue again to its bright Station climb  And Beauty fear no Enemy but Time  The Fair shall listen to Desert alone  And every  Lucia  find a  Cato  's Son  FINIS
