Reprinted in the Year  MDCCXXVIII    PREFACE  THE following historical Essays were written as a Sequel to one bearing the same Title published some time since in the  Craftsman  and communicated to that Author but he having neglected to give them to the Publick I have thought fit to become the Editor myself Whether Mr  d' Anvers  esteems other Subjects more seasonable at this time whether he has been intimidated with Prosecutions or soften'd with Applications I do not take upon me to determine  I have the Pleasure only to assure the Reader that I have faithfully collected the Facts that are related in these little Tracts as they have fallen out from time to time and shall continue to have a watchful Eye over the Actions of our Steward and to record them for the Benefit of Posterity that those who come after us at least may be deterr'd by this Example from intrusting the Management of their Estates to bad Hands The Memorialist furnishes Materials for the Historian and so far he has a right to share in his Fame Perhaps the Character of this most remarkable Steward may by my means be preserved thus to  future Times the Indulgence of this Vanity and the Consciousness of having done what was in my Power to expose a corrupt Servant is all the Reward I claim as a Man has some little Pretence to Merit from the Publick who only crys out  Stop Thief  But before I take leave of my Readers I humbly intreat as they desire to be thought candid or courteous or to be obliged with any other Epithets that the most complaisant Writer ever gave them That they will be so good not to force the Letters in the following Pages to convey to them any other Meanings than what they stand  for in the Order they are there placed it being the Nature of the Twentyfour Letters in our Alphabet as I am inform'd when they are transposed to give to the Reader what Ideas the Transposer pleases so large is the Field of Innuendo's This Caution might perhaps at any other Time or Place than this appear ridiculous but as some People are very tender and others very censorious I thought this not an unnecessary Advertisement  TO Caleb d' Anvers  Esq  SIR  _I HAVE the Happiness to be Tenant to Sir  George English  and there is not one among them who has a more hearty Affection for him and his whole Family than I have When this Estate which he now enjoys and which Heaven grant he and his may long enjoy was first left to him by the general Attornment of the Tenants and the Consent and Act of brave Sir  William  his Ancestor  I had the pleasure as a Witness and a Tenant to sign the Instrument my self I saw good Sir  William  ratify it I beheld him soon after expire and could discern a pleasing Satisfaction in his Features rising from the Comfort he received in having finished what he believed must make his Tenants the happiest and most easy of any People in our whole County You will forgive me Sir that I thus dwell on the Praise of my good old Master Sir  William  He was a Man who loved his whole Species who had a general Benevolence to Mankind he did not think any Man was born for himself alone nor could he bear to see any of his neighbouring Landlords use their Tenants ill or rack them too high and more than once he has engaged himself in expensive Lawsuits to deliver them from the Hands of the Oppressor Mr  Lyn  of whom I now complain to you Sir was one of the Tenants and tho' his little Copyhold was then not much in repair and a little incumbered with Debts however it has been since improved he  professed himself very zealous as well as the rest of us in the Interest of our Landlord and continued so some Years But Time proves every thing and a very little while after he was appointed Steward to our old Master he began to shew himself and tho' the Affairs of Sir  George  grew every day worse and worse under his Management the Affairs of Mr  Lyn  grew better and better every day He began to look plump and round his little Farm was clear of all Incumbrances his Family his Friends his Relations his Acquaintance all grew plump likewise and flourished under his Influence He had indeed been very liberal to them not out of his own Money but his Master's He put them into all the Employments he could find in the several Manors and very frequently when there was no Employment ready or open or unenjoy'd by any Relation Friend or Dependent of his he was ready to erect an Office and to give it a Name and an Appointment out of his Master's Rents without any Consideration  how much his Master was in debt how detrimental it must prove to his Estate or how ungrateful it was to the Tenants who saw and murmured to see that their Farms were racked to the highest to support the Family and other SelfInterests of Mr  Lyn  Well Sir our Steward grew rich he grew ambitious and vain and haughty and humorous and now took it into his Head that he was as accomplish'd a Gentleman even as Sir  George  himself and would needs be stiled his  Companion  He dress'd himself up in Blue and used to strut about in Pearl Colour Stockings a Silk Doublet and a Cap and Feather and fancy'd he had enrolled himself among Heroes and Gods so hard it is for a Man in Prosperity to check the Folly of a vain Mind some time before this whim of bedecking himself in Taffaty and Blue he had a Fancy to appear in Red and accordingly one Morning with a very solemn and grave Counte+nance he told several of his Intimate  that now he was grown rich he was resolved to devote himself to the Service of Religion as a KnightErrant that he would rescue Virgins protect Orphans destroy Giants and do every thing praiseworthy and becoming the great Office of true Chivalry he exhorted his Friends likewise who were very honest Men and meant well to do the same and told them their Habiliments ought to be all alike viz Red Taffaty Spurs Feathers Caps Faulchions c So said so done they dress'd themselves they swore on the Evangelists to be good and true Knights they march'd in an affected Stagestrut round the Town and made a Shew in their whimsical Dresses that set all the Parish in a Gape Now one wou'd imagine that Mr  Lyn  was about to make amends for all his Mismanagement and that the World as it had been the worse for him would be the better too But this was only a Joke it seems for as soon as ever he had persuaded his Companions to this on a sudden he whipt off his Red Taffaty Doublet and put on a blue one as I have said and  called himself his Master's Fellow to the great Surprize of every one But these Frolicks you will say might only take Birth from the jocund Levities of a Head a little giddy with Prosperity the plaisom Gaities the  dulce desipere  of a Heart swollen with Joy and Power We will go on then to consider him only in his Character of Steward  Mr  LYN  was no sooner got into the Stewardship but he with very great Assurance told his Master that none of his Tenants had any hearty Affection for him but himself and his Sons his Brother  Townly  and his Sons with their Relations and Intimates that if it were not for his and their Management Sir  George  would not be able to make any thing of the Estate And  Isaac Tombrel  a Relation to a Relation of Mr  Lyn  's by Marriage had the Assurance to affirm before young Squire  English  Sir  George  's eldest Son at Dinner at the Mansion House in  Leicestershire  that the Preservation of Sir  George  's whole Estate  was owing to Mr  Lyn  for which and other unmannerly and indecent Expressions he was rebuked disgraced and sent back into  Norfolk  Indeed Mr  Lyn  used frequently in publick to applaud himself for his good Management of the Estate and to pronounce himself with great Authority the only Man in  England  who knew how to keep a Rental He went farther and frequently declared that was it not for him and his great Art and Skill the Tenants would not pay their Rents that they would forget all Respect and Duty to Sir  George  or join with Squire  Welsh  in the Lawsuit against him Tho' Squire  Welsh  and his Lawsuit and Prentensions were very low and despised and almost forgot by every body yet Mr  Lyn  always endeavour'd to make his court to his Master by assuring him that several of his Tenants those I mean who held the largest Farms and whose Hearts were always with Sir  George  were secretly Favourers of the Pretensions of Mr  Welsh  this Sir indeed appears to me one of Mr  Lyn  's greatest Iniquities as I think a Pickthank in a Family is most odious Character But he was resolved to support his Power at the Expence of every thing and now finding himself as he imagin'd at least in Trust and Confidence with his Master which we his poor Tenants hope is not really the Case he raised his Crest and threw out his natural Bronze And as Insolence is ever the Mark of a little Mind tho' conscious to himself of more Crimes than any Man but himself can discover he slighted his Superiors and despised his Opponents The ParishOfficers the Assessors and Collectors of the LandTax the Constables Portreve and Jurymen were all his Creatures Relations Dependents or Subdependents such whose Corruption and Consciences he could depend upon Thus furnished thus guarded and supported he ventur'd on he levy'd Money upon the Tenants on the most ridiculous Pretence an old Bridge was to be repaired a new one to be built the Parish wanted a Set of Bells a new Pair of Stocks must be provided he made them  contribute to the keeping several Packs of Hounds and sometimes Master  Lyn  wou'd demand a round Sum of Money for private Uses and such as were by no means proper to be known to the Tenants  SIR  George  has a Park where his Tenants have Time out of Mind been permitted to recreate and refresh at leisure Hours as often as they pleased and thro' this Park many of them are oblig'd to pass every Day to their Grounds Mr  Lyn  who valued himself on his Genius for raising Money order'd his own Man to stand before the ParkGate and levy a Penny for the Passage of every Man when Business or Diversions oblig'd him to pass that way and this too under the Pretence of setting up a pair of Gates only tho' the Money levy'd would new pale the whole Park And this I mention only to shew you how ready he is at Undertakings of this kind  HOWEVER notwithstanding all the Discouragements that the Tenants lay under they might have thriven even under the Stewardship of Mr  Lyn  if he had not with the utmost Art and Application laboured to prevent it The two greatest and known Enemies to Industry and Trade are Luxury and Gaming these he carefully encouraged and in order to this he invited the Tenants to a large Gamingtable which had been erected indeed in another  Robinocracy  in the very middle of the MarketPlace To this Gamingtable the Tenants when they had disposed of their Wooll their Corn c all hurry'd and as there is in most Men a Lust after inordidinate Gain many of them play'd and every Day left behind them the Labours of their Industry But Mr  Lyn  ever provident for himself took care that this should turn to his Advantage for tho' he never appeared there himself he always employ'd a few faithful Confidents to play for him and allow'd them to share in some Parts of the Spoil It was always his Method when  he play'd thus by Deputy to use loaded Dice either high or low as he fancy'd and when some of the Tenants who by dear Experience were now grown very peery observ'd Mr  Lyn  's Dice in play they would very artfully as they imagin'd set their Dice accordingly that is if they observed Mr  Lyn  used high Dice they set expecting them to run high and so low when they saw his Dice run low but when the Stakes were deep enough to invite Mr  Lyn  's Acceptance they were always invisibly changed upon them and he was by this ingenious Artifice Master of Part of the Property of the Tenants And as often as he pleased by this he amassed Wealth by this means the Manufactures of our Country are very much hurt and our Trade decreases This is at present the Case under our most righteous Steward and they tell me there is nothing he delights in at this Hour so much as Gaming by Proxy and FoxHunting  TO  Caleb d' Anvers    Esq  The HISTORY of the NORFOLK STEWARD  PART II Containing a farther Account of Mr Lyn's Management and also of his Method of Stating and Ballancing Accounts  SIR  I Believe my  last  hath convinc'd you that Mr  Lyn  's management of Sir  George  's  Domestick Affairs  was full as extraordinary as that of his  Lawsuits  with his  Neighbours  But perhaps you will wonder that  he should be suffer'd to go on so long in these Practices that he hath not been constantly  presented  every  Courtday  for so many repeated Misdoings or that even all the  Tenants  of the  Mannor  do not unanimously make it their request to Sir  George  whose Ears are always open to their Complaints that he would be pleased to remove a Steward whose Mananagement is generally disliked and complained of by all the Tenants But your Surprize will vanish when you recollect what I have told you in both my former Letters that all the  Prime Officers  both of the  Parish  and the  Mannor  as well as most of the  Jurymen  were his own  Relations  or  Creatures  that a great number of the  principal Tenants  were bribed into his Interest and that many others who had honest Intentions were afraid to oppose a Man who had it in his Power to  raise their Rent distrain their Goods  or  turn them out of their Farms  at Pleasure by representing them as  bad Tenants  or  Enemies to their Landlord  tho' these very People were the best affected  to their Landlord tho' they paid their Rents punctually and had no other demerit but that they faithfully adhered to what they conceived to be the true Interest of Sir  George  In short it is the peculiar Character of Mr  Lyn  That when he took up a Prejudice however unreasonable against any of the  Tenants  he always  made it a POINT  as he call'd it to  ruin  them with Sir  George  and stuck at nothing to compass his End  YET notwithstanding all this Power and this extravagant Use of it there are many Persons of considerable Interest and Figure in the  Mannor  who have constantly opposed him in all these Proceedings and have at present the Pleasure to see a general Spirit of Resentment rising against him The Number of his  Opponents  increases daily whilst many some even of  those  who are  obliged  to act with him are frequently heard to murmur against his Proceedings in publick as well as private and others who eat his Bread as he is insolently  pleased to call it Sir  George  's Bread the Tenants Bread he means hang down their Heads and conscious of their Crime in not opposing his Measures plead guilty to the Charge against him in their Silence  THE  Freemen  of the Town where Sir  George  lives himself are heartily almost universally incensed against him on  divers Accounts  particularly for having introduced several  New Customs  amongst them for always interposing his Authority in their  Elections of ParishOfficers  for making them pay more for their  Fewel  than the rest of the Tenants for refusing to read a  Letter  written in their behalf on this Account and replying with an insolent Air  That he did not care a  Ft  for the whole Town  GREAT Numbers of  poor Tradesmen  who supplied the late Sir  George  with Necessaries are ready to starve for want of the Money he died in arrear to them on that Account which is the more extraordinary because Sir  George  had always a sufficient Income to keep  a noble Houfe and pay every body as indeed he seem'd always inclinable to do from whence they conclude That Mr  Lyn  embezzled great Sums himself and squandered away others for his own Vanity and Grandeur amongst a  worse kind of TRADESMEN  than they are Nay what adds to the Provocation is That Mr  Lyn  will not satisfy them  whether they shall ever be paid or not  THE  neighbouring Country Gentlemen  complain of him for  engrossing the Game  and forbidding them to hunt or ride in Sir  George  's PARKS as they used to do  THE Clergy charging him with recommending Men of slow Parts for Preferment in the Church to old Sir  George  when any  Livings  fell of which there was a great Number during  his Life  and the  Stewardship  of Mr  Lyn  THE  Yeomanry  grumble for want of Money the  Manufacturers  for want of Business and the  poor Labourers  for want of Bread and all impute their Misfortunes I  think after what has been said not very unjustly to Mr  Lyn  by engaging old Sir  George  in a  needless expensive  and  chimerical Lawsuit  and thereby preventing the usual  Circulation  of Money in Commerce by diverting it into other  Channels  IN short all Ranks of Men except a  few particular Creatures  of his own seem to have their respective Complaints against him and unite in their Wishes for a  new Steward  NAY we have a current Report about the Country that our  present Landlord  who is a Gentleman of  great Penetration  and applies himself very much to  Business  hath been for some time of the same Opinion with his  Tenants  and altho it may not be convenient to discharge him at present at least till his Accounts which are in the utmost Confusion are audited and settled yet it is certain that he hath already  clipt his Wings and so short too  that he is unable to take his  former Flights  THIS hath a little sunk his Crest and soften'd his Behaviour to his  FellowTenants  tho' he still endeavours to keep up his usual Spirit of  Defiance  but we can easily observe from the frequent  Tremulation of his Voice the faultring of his Accents his Loss of Temper and Confusion in his Sentences  that he is inwardly very much  chagrined  and  disturb'd  YOU may remember I told you in my  first  that Sir  George  's Estate when he came to it was charged with an  heavy Debt  And that when Mr  Lyn  was call'd upon to give an Account of the  great Sums of Money  which had passed thro' his Hands he always refused to do it and endeavoured to make a Jest of  those  who demanded it But at length the general Clamour obliged him to consent to  some Examination  upon which it appears even by his  own Account  that his Master's Estate is so far from being the  better  for his Management according to his  former repeated Declarations  that it is  several hundred Pounds more in debt  than it was before he came into the  Stewardship  notwithstanding the  great Sums  which ought to have been  yearly  applied towards paying it off  BUT his  manner of stating Accounts  is so very extraordinary that I believe you will think it worth relating  Mr  Lyn  hath always boasted that the  FamilyDebt  was very much  diminished  within these  ten  or  eleven Years  past and  defied  his Enemies to prove the contrary Now in order to see whether this was true or not it was proposed first to state the  Debt  as it stood  eleven  Years ago  is all its Branches  Then to deduct from it the several  yearly Sums  which have or ought to have been paid out of a certain  strong Box  where the Savings from the Rents after the Expences of the Family were paid were constantly laid up to discharge part of the Mortgage upon the Estate as it was appointed to do since  that time  and afterwards to compute the  whole Debt of every kind  which the  Family  owes at  present  It was agreed I think that the  Debt eleven  Years ago amounted to about  l  The  strong Box  was said to have produced since  that time  about  l  which reduces the Debt had no  farther Debt  been incurred as the Phrase in vogue is to and in whatever  degree the  present Debt  should appear to be  less than that Sum  so much and no more ought to be allowed to be  really diminished  since  that Time  by the Management of Mr  Lyn  since he could not pretend to arrogate to himself the Merit of  paying any Sums which would have paid themselves  had he let them alone  THIS seem'd to be a fair  Proposal  as it was generally esteemed but fair as it was Mr  Lyn  demurred to it At first indeed he crack'd bluster'd and defy'd as usual at length with much Difficulty he agreed to give in some Account Accordingly he gave in his  own State of the Account  and a Day was appointed for the  Enquiry  when that came he made a  considerable Alteration  in his own Account And having afterwards acknowledged  that he had quite forgot several other considerable Sums of the Debt contracted  he run his usual Circle he asserted affirmed deny'd was positive was every thing but intelligible he talk'd in short till he had not only made himself but many of his Hearers giddy There is not perhaps so great a Master in  Europe  of the  grand Art of Bambousle as Mr  Lyn  The Debt said he is incurred but not increased there are real Debts and nominal Debts there are real nominal Debts and nominal real Debts there were real Debts and personal Debts which the Family must pay there are Debts neverstated tho 'incurred and Debts which tho' incurred and stated might never be paid so that upon the whole you see I have paid off a considerable part of the Mortgage upon Sir  George  's Estate But when he was told that tho' it was true that part of the  Norfolk  Mortgage was paid off yet Sir  George  was really now as much in debt as before because Mr  Lyn  to perform this mighty Deed had borrow'd just as much upon Sir  George  's Estate in  Leicestershire  as he had paid off in  Norfolk  so that the Ballance continued as before he broke into a loud Laugh and told the Tenants they knew nothing of Accounts nor the difference between a Debt incurred and a Debt increased  BY the Help of these  Distinctions  and this Jumble of  Sophistries  he struck off one Article of  above three thousand Pounds  which  he asserted to be a  very good Bargain to the Family  another of almost  two thousand  because it was owing to  very bad Management  and a third of  one thousand  for no other Reason that I could hear than that he did not know how to  justify the contracting  of it or in what manner to provide  for its Payment  HE had also the Modesty to place  another considerable  Sum amongst the  Debts discharged  within  that Time  which ought really to have been placed amongst  those incurred  IT is likewise worth observing that Mr  Lyn  had previously taken care to puzzle and perplex the  Accounts  as much as possible in order to secure himself from  Detection  by chopping and changing the  Securities into different Hands  borrowing of  one  to pay off  another  turning  Interest  into  Principal  and  Principal  into  Interest  with a thousand other  Arts  and  Stratagems  of the same kind so that he had a manifest Advantage over  Those  who were not in the  Secret  NAY what is still more extraordinary he stated his Account of  Debts contracted  to  Christmas last only  whereas he calculated the Sum of  Debts discharged  to  Ladyday  next a Method of  stating  and  ballancing Accounts  which was never before practised or heard of in these Parts  AND yet after all these  Finesses  and  Fallacies  and  arbitrary Postulata  the  present FamilyDebt  evidently appear'd to be just as it was  eleven  Years ago  fifty one thousand Pounds  or thereabouts  THO' it is generally believed here that this Affair will not redound much to the Credit of Mr  Lyn  yet it must be confessed that his  Arithmetical Capacity  is really admirable and that he hath proved himself beyond all Contradiction to be a complete Master of  Addition  as well as  Substraction  To be continued as the Steward goes on  FINIS
