 VOL III  The Second EDITION  A COLLECTION OF POEMS IN THREE VOLUMES  BY SEVERAL HANDS  LONDON Printed by J HUGHS For R DODSLEY at Tully'sHead in PallMall MDCCXLVIII  The CHOICE of HERCULES A POEM  I  NOW had the son of Jove mature attain'd  The joyful prime when youth elate and gay  Steps into life and follows unrestrain'd  Where passion leads or prudence points the way  In the pure mind at those ambiguous years  Or vice rank weed first strikes her pois'nous root  Or haply virtue's op'ning bud appears  By just degrees fair bloom of fairest fruit  For if on youth's untainted thought imprest  The gen'rous purpose still shall warm the manly breast  II  As on a day reflecting on his age  For highest deeds now ripe Alcides sought  Retirement nurse of contemplation sage  Step following step and thought fucceeding thought  Musing with steady pace the youth pursu'd  His walk and lost in meditation stray'd  Far in a lonely vale with solitude  Conversing while intent his mind survey'd  The dubious path of life before him lay  Here virtue's rough ascent there pleasure's flow'ry way  III  Much did the view divide his wavering mind  Now glow'd his breast with generous thirst of fame  Now love of ease to softer thoughts inclin'd  His yielding soul and quench'd the rising flame  When lo far off two female forms he spies  Direct to him their steps they seem to bear  Both large and tall exceeding human size  Both far exceeding human beauty fair  Graceful yet each with different grace they move  This striking sacred awe that softer winning love  IV  The first in native dignity surpass'd  Artless and unadorn'd she pleas'd the more  Health o'er her looks a genuine lustre cast  A vest more white than newfall'n snow she wore  August she trod yet modest was her air  Serene her eye yet darting heav'nly fire  Still she drew near and nearer still more fair  More mild appear'd yet such as might inspire  Pleasure corrected with an awful fear  Majestically sweet and amiably severe  V  The other dame seem'd ev'n of fairer hue  But bold her mien unguarded rov'd her eye  And her flush'd cheeks confess'd at nearer view  The borrow'd blushes of an artful dye  All soft and delicate with airy swim  Lightly she danc'd along her robe betray'd  Thro' the clear texture every tender limb  Height'ning the charms it only seem'd to shade  And as it flow'd adown so loose and thin  Her stature shew'd more tall more snowywhite her skin  VI  Oft with a smile she view'd herself askaunce  Ev'n on her shade a conscious look she threw  Then all around her cast a careless glance  To mark what gazing eyes her beauty drew  As they came near before that other maid  Approaching decent eagerly she press'd  With hasty step nor of repulse afraid  With freedom bland the wond'ring youth address'd  With winning fondness on his neck she hung  Sweet as the honeydew flow'd her enchanting tongue  VII  "Dear Hercules whence this unkind delay  "Dear youth what doubts can thus distract thy mind  "Securely follow where I lead the way  "And range thro' wilds of pleasure unconfin'd  "With me retire from noise and pain and care  "Embath'd in bliss and wrapt in endless ease  "Rough is the road to fame thro' blood and war  "Smooth is my way and all my paths are peace  "With me retire from toils and perils free  "Leave honour to the wretch pleasures were made for thee  VIII  "Then will I grant thee all thy soul's desire  "All that may charm thine ear and please thy sight  "All that thy thought can frame or wish require  "To steep thy ravish'd senses in delight  "The sumptuous feast enhanc'd with musick's sound  "Fittest to tune the melting soul to love  "Rich odours breathing choicest sweets around  "The fragrant bow'r cool fountain shady grove  "Fresh flowers to strew thy couch and crown thy head  "Joy shall attend thy steps and ease shall smooth thy bed  IX  "These will I freely constantly supply  "Pleasures nor earn'd with toil nor mix'd with woe  "Far from thy rest repining want shall fly  "Nor labour bathe in sweat thy careful brow  "Mature the copious harvest shall be thine  "Let the laborious hind subdue the soil  "Leave the rash soldier spoils of war to win  "Won by the soldier thou shalt share the spoil  "These softer cares my blest allies employ  "New pleasures to invent to wish and to enjoy"  X  Her winning voice the youth attentive caught  He gaz'd impatient on the smiling maid  Still gaz'd and listen'd then her name besought  "My name fair youth is Happiness she said  "Well can my friends this envy'd truth maintain  "They share my bliss they best can speak my praise  "Tho' slander call me Slothdetraction vain  "Heed not what slander vain detracter says  "Slander still prompt true merit to defame  "To blot the brightest worth and blast the fairest name"  XI  By this arriv'd the fair majestick maid  She all the while with the same modest pace  Compos'd advanc'd "Know Hercules she said  With manly tone thy birth of heav'nly race  "Thy tender age that lov'd instruction's voice  "Promis'd thee generous patient brave and wise  "When manhood should confirm thy glorious choice  "Now expectation waits to see thee rise  "Rise youth exalt thyself and me approve  "Thy high descent from heav'n and dare be worthy Jove  XII  "But what truth prompts my tongue shall not disguise  "The steep ascent must be with toil subdu'd  "Watchings and cares must win the lofty prize  "Propos'd by heav'n true bliss and real good  "Honour rewards the brave and bold alone  "She spurns the timorous indolent and base  "Danger and toil stand stern before her throne  "And guard so Jove commands the sacred place  "Who seeks her must the mighty cost sustain  "And pay the price of fame labour and care and pain  XIII  "Wou'dst thou engage the gods peculiar care  "O Hercules th' immortal powers adore  "With a pure heart with sacrifice and pray'r  "Attend their altars and their aid implore  "Or wou'dst thou gain thy country's loud applause  "Lov'd as her father as her god ador'd  "Be thou the bold assertor of her cause  "Her voice in council in the fight her sword  "In peace in war pursue thy country's good  "For her bare thy bold breast and pour thy generous blood  XIV  "Wou'dst thou to quell the proud and lift th' opprest  "In arts of war and matchless strength excel  "First conquer thou thyself To ease to rest  "To each soft thought of pleasure bid farewel  "The night alternate due to sweet repose  "In watches waste in painful march the day  "Congeal'd amidst the rigorous winter's snows  "Scorch'd by the summer's thirstinflaming ray  "Thy harden'd limbs shall boast superior might  "Vigour shall brace thine arm resistless in the fight  XV  "Hear'st thou what monsters then thou must engage  "What danger gentle youth she bids thee prove  Abrupt says Sloth "ill fit thy tender age  "Tumult and wars fit age for joy and love  "Turn gentle youth to me to love and joy  "To these I lead no monsters here shall stay  "Thine easy course no cares thy peace annoy  "I lead to bliss a nearer smoother way  "Short is my way fair easy smooth and plain  "Turn gentle youth with me eternal pleasures reign  XVI  "What pleasures vain mistaken wretch are thine  Virtue with scorn reply'd "who sleep'st in ease  "Insensate whose soft limbs the toil decline  "That seasons bliss and makes enjoyment please  "Draining the copious bowl ere thirst require  "Feasting ere hunger to the feast invite  "Whose tasteless joys anticipate desire  "Whom luxury supplies with appetite  "Yet nature loaths and you employ in vain  "Variety and art to conquer her disdain  XVII  "The sparkling nectar cool'd with summer snows  "The dainty board with choicest viands spread  "To thee are tasteless all sincere repose  "Flies from thy flow'ry couch and downy bed  "For thou art only tir'd with indolence  "Nor is thy sleep with toil and labour bought  "Th' imperfect sleep that lulls thy languid sense  "In dull oblivious interval of thought  "That kindly steals th' inactive hours away  "From the long ling'ring space that lengthens out the day  XVIII  "From bounteous nature's unexhausted stores  "Flows the pure fountain of sincere delights  "Averse to her you waste the joyless hours  "Sleep drowns thy days and riot rules thy nights  "Immortal tho' thou art indignant Jove  "Hurl'd thee from heaven th' immortals blissful place  "For ever banish'd from the realms above  "To dwell on earth with man's degenerate race  "Fitter abode on earth alike disgrac'd  "Rejected by the wise and by the fool embrac'd  XIX  "Fond wretch that vainly weenest all delight  "To gratify the sense reserv'd for thee  "Yet the most pleasing object to the sight  "Thine own fair action never didst thou see  "Tho' lull'd with softest sounds thou liest along  "Soft musick warbling voices melting lays  "Ne'er did'st thou hear more sweet than sweetest song  "Charming the soul thou ne'er did'st hear thy praise  "Noto thy revels let the fool repair  'To such go smooth thy speech spread thy tempting snare  XX  "Vast happiness enjoy thy gay allies  "A youth of follies an oldage of cares  "Young yet enervate old yet never wise  "Vice wastes their vigour and their mind impairs  "Vain idle delicate in thoughtless ease  "Reserving woes for age their prime they spend  "All wretched hopeless in the evil days  "With sorrow to the verge of life they tend  "Griev'd with the present of the past asham'd  "They live and are despis'd they die nor more are nam'd  XXI  "But with the gods and godlike men I dwell  "Me his supreme delight th' almighty sire  "Regards wellpleas'd whatever works excel  "All or divine or human I inspire  "Counsel with strength and industry with art  "In union meet conjoin'd with me reside  "My dictates arm instruct and mend the heart  "The surest policy the wisest guide  "With me true friendship dwells she deigns to bind  "Those generous souls alone whom I before have join'd  XXII  "Nor need my friends the various costly feast  "Hunger to them th' effects of art supplies  "Labour prepares their weary limbs to rest  "Sweet is their sleep light chearful strong they rise  "Thro' health thro' joy thro' pleasure and renown  "They tread my paths and by a soft descent  "At length to age all gently sinking down  "Look back with transport on a life wellspent  "In which no hour flew unimprov'd away  "In which some generous deed distinguish'd every day  XXIII  "And when the destin'd term at length compleat  "Their ashes rest in peace eternal fame  "Sounds wide their praise triumphant over fate  "In sacred song for ever lives their name  "This Hercules is happiness Obey  "My voice and live Let thy celestial birth  "Lift and enlarge thy thoughts Behold the way  "That leads to fame and raises thee from earth  "Immortal Lo I guide thy steps Arise  "Pursue the glorious path and claim thy native skies"  XXIV  Her words breathe fire celestial and impart  New vigour to his soul that sudden caught  The generous flame with great intent his heart  Swells full and labours with exalted thought  The mist of error from his eyes dispell'd  Thro' all her fraudful arts in clearest light  Sloth in her native form he now beheld  Unveil'd she stood confess'd before his sight  False sirenAll her vaunted charms that shone  So fresh erewhile and fair now wither'd pale and gone  XXV  No more the rosy bloom in sweet disguise  Masks her dissembled looks each borrow'd grace  Leaves her wan cheek pale sickness clouds her eyes  Livid and sunk and passions dim her face  As when fair Iris has a while display'd  Her watry arch with gaudy painture gay  While yet we gaze the glorious colours fade  And from our wonder gently steal away  Where shone the beauteous phantom erst so bright  Now lowers the lowhung cloud all gloomy to the sight  XXVI  But virtue more engaging all the while  Disclos'd new charms more lovely more serene  Beaming sweet influence A milder smile  Soften'd the terrors of her lofty mien  "Lead goddess I am thine transported cry'd  "Alcides O propitious pow'r thy way  "Teach me possess my soul be thou my guide  "From thee O never never let me stray"  While ardent thus the youth his vows address'd  With all the goddess fill'd already glow'd his breast  XXVII  The heav'nly maid with strength divine endu'd  His daring soul there all her pow'rs combin'd  Firm constancy undaunted fortitude  Enduring patience arm'd his mighty mind  Unmov'd in toils in dangers undismay'd  By many a hardy deed and bold emprize  From fiercest monsters thro' her pow'rful aid  He free'd the earth thro' her he gain'd the skies  'Twas virtue plac'd him in the blest abode  Crown'd with eternal youth among the gods a god  An ODE TO THE People of GREATBRITAIN  In Imitation of the Sixth ODE of the Third Book of HORACE Written in  I  BRITON the thunder of the wrath divine  Due to thy fathers crimes and long withheld from thine  Shall burst with tenfold rage on thy devoted head  Unless with conscious terrors aw'd  By meek heartstruck repentance led  Suppliant thou fall before th' offended God  If haply yet thou may'st avert his ire  And stay his arm outstretch'd to launce th' avenging fire  II  Did not high God of old ordain  When to thy grasp he gave the scepter of the main  That empire in this favour'd land  Fix'd on religion's solid base should stand  When from thy struggling neck he broke  Th' inglorious galling papal yoke  Humbled the pride of haughty Spain  And free'd thee by a womanhero's hand  He then confirm'd the strong decree  "Briton be virtuous and be free  "Be truth be sanctify thy guide  "Be humble fear thy God and fear thou none beside  III  Oft has th' offended pow'r his rising anger shown  Led on by his avenging hand  Rebellion triumphs in the land  Twice have her barbarous sons our wartrain'd hosts o'erthrown  They fell a cheap inglorious prey  Th' ambitious victor's boast was half supprest  While heav'nbred fear and wild dismay  Unman'd the warrior's heart and reign'd in every breast  IV  Her arms to foreign lands Britannia bore  Her arms auspicious now no more  With frequent conquests where the sires were crown'd  The sons illfated fell and bit the hostile ground  The tame wartrading Belgian fled  While in his cause the Briton bled  The Gaul stood wond'ring at his own success  Oft did his hardiest bands their wonted fears confess  Struck with dismay and meditating flight  While the brave foe still urg'd th' unequal fight  While WILLIAM with his father's ardour fir'd  Through all th' undaunted host the generous flame inspir'd  V  But heavier far the weight of shame  That sunk Britannia's naval fame  In vain she spreads her oncevictorious sails  Or fear or rashness in her chiefs prevails  And wildly these prevent those basely shun the fight  Content with humble praise the foe  Avoids the longimpending blow  Improves the kind escape and triumphs in his flight  VI  The monstrous age which still encreasing years debase  Which teems with unknown crimes and genders new disgrace  First unrestrain'd by honour faith or shame  Confounding ev'ry sacred name  The hallow'd nuptial bed with lawless lust profan'd  Deriv'd from this polluted source  The dire corruption held its course  Through the whole canker'd race and tainted all the land  VII  The rip'ning maid is vers'd in every dangerous art  That ill adorns the form while it corrupts the heart  Practis'd to dress to dance to play  In wanton mask to lead the way  To move the pliant limbs to roll the luring eye  With folly's gayest partizans to vye  In empty noise and vain expence  To celebrate with flaunting air  The midnight revels of the fair  Studious of ev'ry praise but virtue truth and sense  VIII  Thus lesson'd in intrigue her early thought improves  Nor meditates in vain forbidden loves  Soon the gay nymph in Cypris' train shall rove  Free and at large amid th' Idalian grove  Or haply jealous of the voice of fame  Mask'd in the matron's sober name  With many a welldissembled wile  The kind convenient husband's care beguile  More deeply vers'd in Venus' mystick lore  Yet for such meaner arts too lofty and sublime  The proud highborn patrician whore  Bears unabash'd her front and glories in her crime  IX  Hither from city and from court  The votaries of love resort  The rich the great the gay and the severe  The pension'd architect of laws  The patriot loud in virtue's cause  Proud of imputed worth the peer  Regardless of his faith his country or his name  He pawns his honour and estate  Nor reckons at how dear a rate  He purchases disease and servitude and shame  X  Not from such dastard sires to ev'ry virtue lost  Sprung the brave youth which Britain once could boast  Who curb'd the Gaul's usurping sway  Who swept th' unnumber'd hosts away  In Agincourt and Cressy's glorious plain  Who dy'd the seas with Spanish blood  Their vainlyvaunted fleets subdu'd  And spread the mighty wreck o'er all the vanquish'd main  XI  No'twas a generous race by worth transmissive known  In their bold breast their fathers spirit glow'd  In their pure veins their mothers virtue flow'd  They made hereditary praise their own  The sire his emulous offspring led  The rougher paths of fame to tread  The matron train'd their spotless youth  In honour sanctity and truth  Form'd by th' united parents care  The sons tho' bold were wise the daughters chaste tho' fair  XII  How time allwasting ev'n the worst impairs  And each foul age to dregs still fouler runs  Our sires more vicious ev'n than theirs  Left us still more degenerate heirs  To spawn a baser brood of monsterbreeding sons  PSYCHE OR The GREAT METAMORPHOSIS  A POEM written in Imitation of SPENSER  I  WHERE early Phoebus sheds his milder beams  The happy gardens of Adonis lay  There time well pleas'd to wonne a youth beseems  Ne yet his wings were fledg'd ne locks were grey  Round him in sweet accord the  seasons  play  With fruites and blossoms meint in goodly gree  And dancing hand in hand rejoice the lea  Sick garden's now no mortal wight can see  Ne mote they in my simple verse descriven be  II  The temper'd clime full many a tree affords  Those many trees blush forth with ripen'd fruite  The blushing fruite to feast invites the birds  The birds with plenteous feasts their strength recruite  And warble songs more sweet than shepherd's flute  The gentle streams that roll'd the stones among  Charm'd with the place almost forgot its suite  But list'ning and responding to the song  Loit'ring and winding often murmured elong  III  Here Panacea here Nepenthè grew  Here Polygon and each ambrosial weed  Whose vertues could decayed health renew  And answering exhausted nature's need  Mote eath a mortal to immortal feed  Here lives Adonis in unfading youth  Coelestial Venus grants him that rich meed  And him successive evermore renew'th  In recompence for all his faithful love and truth  IV  Not she I ween the wanton queen of love  All buxom as the waves from whence she rose  With her twinsons who idly round her rove  One Eros hight the other Anteros  Albeit brothers different as foes  This sated sullen apt for bickerment  That hungry eager fit for derringdoes  That flies before with scorching flames ybrent  This foll'wing douts those flames with peevish discontent  V  Coelestial Venus does such ribaulds shun  Ne dare they in her purlues to be seen  But Cupid's torch fair mother's fairest son  Shines with a steady unconsuming sheen  Not fierce yet bright coldness and rage between  The backs of lyons fellonest he strod  And lyons tamely did themselves amene  On nature's wild full sov'reignly he rod  Wild natures chang'd confess'd the mild puissant god  VI  A beauteous fay or heav'ndescended spright  Sprung from her sire withouten females aid  As erst Minerva did and Psyche hight  In that enclosure happy sojourn made  No art some heel'd uncomeliness betray'd  But nature wrought her manycolour'd stole  Ne tarnish'd like an Aethiopian maid  Scorch'd with the suns that ore her beauties roll  Ne saded like the dames who bleach beneath the pole  VII  Nor shame nor pride of borrow'd substance wrought  Her gay embroidery and ornament  But she who gave the gilded insect's coat  Spun the soft silk and spread the various teint  The gilded insect's colours yet were feint  To those which nature for this fairy wove  Our grannams thus with diff'rent dies besprent  Adorn'd in naked majesty the grove  Charm'd our great sires and warm'd our frozen clime to love  VIII  On either side and all adown her back  With many a ring at equal distance plac'd  Contrary to the rest was heben black  With shades of green quick changing as she pass'd  All were on groundwork of bright gold orecast  The black gave livelood to the greenish hue  The green still deep'd the heben ore it lac'd  The gold that peep'd atween and then withdrew  Gave lustre to them both and charm'd the wond'ring view  IX  It seem'd like arras wrought with cunning skill  Where kindly meddle colours light and shade  Here flows the flood there rising wood or hill  Breaks off its course gay verdure dites the mead  The stream depeinten by the glitt'rand braid  Emong the hills now winding seems to hide  Now shines unlook'd for thro' the op'ning glade  Now in full torrent pours its golden tyde  Hills woods and meads refresh'd rejoicing by its side  X  Her Cupid lov'd whom Psyche lov'd again  He like her parent and her belamour  Sought how she mote in sickerness remain  From all malengine safe and evil stour  "Go tender cosset said he forray ore  "These walks and lawnds thine all these buskets are  "Thine ev'ry shrub thine ev'ry fruite and flower  "But oh I charge thee love the rose forbear  "For prickles sharp do arm the dang'rous rosiere  XI  "Prickles will pain and pain will banish love  "I charge thee Psyche then the rose forbear  "When faint and sick thy languors to remove  "To yon ambrosial shrubs and plants repair  "Thou weetest not what med'cines in them are  "What wonders follow their repeated use  "N'ote thy weak sense conceive should I declare  "Their labour'd balm and wellconcocted juice  "New life new forms new thews new joys new worlds produce  XII  "Thy term of tryal past with constancy  "That wimpling slough shall fall like filth away  "On pinions broad uplifted to the sky  "Thou shalt astert thy stranger self survey  "Together Psyche will we climb and play  "Together wander through the fields of air  "Beyond where suns and moons mete night and day  "I charge thee O my love the rose forbear  "If thou wouldst scathe avoid Psyche forewarn'd beware"  XIII  "How sweet thy words to my enchanted ear  With grateful modest confidence she said  "If Cupid speak I could for ever hear  "Trust me my love thou shalt be well obey'd  "What rich purveyance for me hast thou made  "The prickly rose alone denied the rest  "In full indulgence giv'n 'twere to upbraid  "To doubt compliance with this one request  "How small and yet how kind Cupid is thy beheast  XIV  "And is that kindness made an argument  "To raise me still to higher scenes of bliss  "Is the acceptance of thy goodness meant  "Merit in me for farther happiness  "No merit and no argument I wiss  "Is there besides in me unworthy maid  "Thy gift the very love I bear thee is  "Trust me my love thou shalt be well obey'd  "To doubt compliance here Cupid were to upbraid"  XV  Withouten countersesaunce thus she spoke  Unweeting of her frailty Light uprose  Cupid on easy wing yet tender look  And oft reverted eye on her bestows  Fearfull but not distrustfull of her vows  And mild regards she back reflects on him  With aching eye pursues him as he goes  With aching heart marks each diminish'd limb  Till indistinct diffus'd and lost in air he seem  XVI  He went to set the watches of the east  That none mote rush in with the tyde of wind  He went to Venus to make fond request  From fleshly ferm to loosen Pysche's mind  And her estsoons transmew She forelore pin'd  And mov'd for solace to the glassy lake  To view the charms that had his heart entwin'd  She saw and blush'd and smil'd then inly spake  "These charms I cannot chuse but love for Cupid's sake"  XVII  But seaborn Venus 'gan with envy stir  At bruite of their great happiness and sought  How she mote wreak her spight then call'd to her  Her sons and op'd what rankled in her thought  Asking who'd venture ore the mounds to vau't  To breed them scathe unwares to damp the joy  Of blissful Venus or to bring to nought  The liefest purpose of her dearling boy  Or urge them both their minion Psyche to destroy  XVIII  Eros recul'd and noul'd the work atchieve  "Bold is th' attempt said he averse from love  "If love inspires I could derreign to reave  "His spear from Mars his levinbrond from Jove"  Him Anteros sneb'd surly "Galless dove  "Than love's spight's mightier prowess understond  "If spight inspires I dare all dangers prove  "And if successful stand the levin brond  "When hurlen angry forth from Jove's avenging hond  XIX  He said and deffly t'wards the gardens flew  Horribly smiling at his foul emprise  When nearer still and nearer as he drew  Unsufferable brightness wounds his eyes  Forth beaming from the crystal walls he tries  Arear to move averted from the blaze  But now no longer the pure aether buoys  His grosser body's disproportion'd peaze  Down drops plumb from his tow'ring path the treachor base  XX  So ore Avernus or the Lucrine lake  The wistless bird pursues his purpos'd flight  Whether by vapours noy'd that thenceforth break  Or else deserted by an air too light  Down tumbles the fowl headlong from his height  So Anteros astonied fell to ground  Provok'd but not accoid at his straunge plight  He rose and wending coasts it round and round  To find unguarded pass hopeless to leap the mound  XXI  As on the margin of a stream he stood  Slow rolling from that paradise within  A snake's outcase untenanted he view'd  Seizing the spoil albe it worthless been  He darts himself into the vacant skin  In borrow'd gear th' exulting losel glides  Whose faded hues with joy flush bright again  Triumphant ore the buoyant flood he rides  And shoots th' important gulph borne on the gentle tydes  XXII  So shone the brazen gates of Babylon  Armies in vain her muniments assail  So strong no engines could them batter down  So high no ladders could the ramparts scale  So flank'd with tow'rs besiegers n'ote avail  So wide sufficient harvests they enclose  But where might yields there stratagems prevail  Faithless Euphrates thro' the city flows  And through his channel pours the unexpected foes  XXIII  He sails along in many a wanton spire  Now floats at length now proudly rears his crest  His sparkling eyes and scales instinct with fire  With splendor as he moves the waves ore kest  And the waves gleam beneath his flaming breast  As through the battle set in full array  When the sun walks in radiant brightness dress'd  His beams that on the burnish'd helmets play  The burnish'd helms reflect and spread unusual day  XXIV  So on he fares and stately wreaths about  In semblaunce like a seraph glowing bright  But without terror flash'd his lightnings out  More to be wonder'd at than to affright  The backward stream soon led the masker right  To the broad lake where hanging ore the flood  Narcissus like enamour'd with the fight  Of his own beauties the fond Psyche stood  To mitigate the pains of lonely widowhood  XXV  Unkenn'd of her he raught the embroider'd bank  And through the tangled flourets west aside  To where a rosiere by the river dank  Luxuriant grew in all its blowing pride  Not far from Psyche arm'd with scaly hide  He clamb the thorns which no impression make  His glitt'rand length with all its folds untied  Plays floating ore the bush then silence brake  And thus the nymph astonied at his speech bespake  XXVI  "O fairest and most excellent compleat  "In all perfections sov'reign queen of nature  "The whole creation bowing at thy feet  "Submissive pays thee homage wondrous creature  "If ought created thou for ev'ry feature  "Speaks thee a goddess issued from the skie  "Oh let not me offend unbidden waiter  "At aweful distance gazing thusBut why  "Should gazing thus offend or how unbidden I  XXVII  "The sun that wakes those flourets from their beds  "Or opes these buds by his soft influence  "Is not offended that they peep their heads  "And shew they feel his pow'r by their quick sense  "Off'ring at his command their sweet incense  "Thus I drawn here by thy enliv'ning rays  "Call not intrusion my obedience  "Perforce yet willing thrall am come to gaze  "To pay my homage meet and bask in beauty's blaze"  XXVIII  Amaz'd she stood nor could recover soon  From contemplation suddenly abraid  Starting at speech unusual yet the tune  Struck sootly on her ear and concert made  With her own thoughts Nor with less pleasure stray'd  Her eye delighted o'er his glossy skin  Yet frighted at the thorn on which he play'd  Pleasure with horror mixt she hung between  Suspended yields recoils uncertain where to lin  XXIX  At length she spoke "Reptile no charms I know  "Such as you mention yet what e'er they are  "And nill I lessen what the gods bestow  "Their is the gift and be the tribute their  "For them these beauties I improve with care  "Intent on them alone from eve to morn  "But reed me reptile whence this wonder rare  "That thou hast speech as if to reason born  "And how unhurt you sport on that forbidden thorn  XXX  "Say why forbidden thorn the foe replied  "To every reptile every insect free  "Has malice harsh to thee alone denied  "The fragrance of the rose enjoy'd by me  "'Twas love not malice form'd the kind decree  Halfwroth she cried "Thine all these buskets are  "Thine fruite and flow'r were Cupid's words to me  "But oh I charge thee love the rose forbear  "For prickles sharp do arm the dang'rous rosiere  XXXI  "Prickles will pain and pain will banish love  "I charge thee Psyche then the rose forbear  "When faint and sick thy languors to remove  "To yon ambrosial shrubs and plants repair  "Thou weetest not what med'cines in them are  "What wonders follow their repeated use  "N'ote thy weak sense conceive should I declare  "Their labour'd balm and wellconcocted juice  "New life new forms new thews new joys new worlds produce  XXXII  "Thy term of tryal past with constancy  "That wimpling slough shall fall like filth away  "On pinions broad uplifted to the skie  "Thou shalt astert thy stranger self survey  "Together Psyche will we climb and play  "Together wander through the fields of air  "Beyond where suns and moons mete night and day  "I charge thee O my love the rose forbear  "If thou wouldst scathe avoid Psyche forewarn'd beware"  XXXIII  Out burst the frannion into open laugh  She blush'd and frown'd at his uncivil mirth  Then soften'd to a smile as hiding half  What mote offend if boldly utter'd forth  He seem'd t' assay to give his answer birth  But stop'd and chang'd his smiles to looks of ruth  "Is this quoth he fit guerdon for thy worth  "Does Cupid thus impose upon thy youth  "Dwells then in heav'n such envy void of love and truth  XXXIV  "Is this the instance of his tenderness  "To envy Psyche what to worms is given  "To cut her off from present happiness  "With feign'd reversion of a promis'd heav'n  "By threat'nings false from true enjoyments driven  "How innocent the thron to touch he knows  "Where are my wounds or where th' avenging levin  "How softly blush these colours of the rose  "How sweetand div'd into the flow'rits fragrance flows  XXXV  "Disadvantageous are thy terms of tryal  "No longer Psyche then the rose

woebegon  Stretcht on the bank beside the fatal thorn  Venus who came to seek her with her son  Beheld She stop'd And albe heav'nly born  Ruthful of others woe began to mourn  The loss of Venus'

filth away  What arts he tried to win her love again  By what wiles guileful Ant'ros did assay  By leasing still her recreant to maintain  And render Cupid's kindly labours vain  Their combat Cupid's

bliss  "And let man know what this great blessing is"  Say what proportion creature wouldst thou claim  As thy creator's in extent the same  Unless his other attributes were join'd  To poise the will and regulate the mind  Goodness to aim and wisdom to direct  What mighty mischiefs must we thence expect  The maker knows his work nor judg'd it fit  To trust the rash resolves of human wit  Which prone to hurt too blind to help is still  Alike pernicious mean it good or ill  A whim t' improvements making fond pretence  Would burst a system in experiments  Sparrows and cats indeed no more should fear  But Saturn tremble in his distant sphere  Give thee but footing in another world  Say Archimedes where should we be hurl'd  A sprightly wit with liquor in his head  Would burn a globe to light him drunk to bed  Th' Ephesian temple had escap'd the flame  And heav'n's high dome had built the madman's fame  The sullen might when malice boil'd within  Strike out the stars to intimate his spleen  Not poppyheads had spoke a Tarquin crost  Nature's chief spring had broke and all been lost  Nor less destructive would this licence prove  Tho' thy breast flam'd with universal love  In vain were thy benevolence of soul  Soon would thy folly disconcert the whole  No rains or snows should discompose the air  But flow'rs and sunshine drain the weary year  No clouds should sully the clear

thunder sleeping in the skies  Sink a corrupted city in a minute  Wo to the righteous ten who may be in it  Pick out the bad and sweep them all away  So leave their babes to cats and dogs a prey  Such pow'r without God's wisdom and his will  Were only an omnipotence of ill  Suited to man can we such pow'r esteem  Fiends would be harmless if compar'd with him  Say then shall all his attributes be

learned pride  In Aetna burn'd or drown'd amid the tide  Boasts of superior sense then raves to see  When contradicted fools less wise than he  Mates with his great creator vainly bold  To make new

as erst from nature's ready feast  Rises the satisfy'd but temp'rate guest  Cast wild abroad no happy mean preserves  By choice he surfeits by constraint he starves  Toils life away upon the stubborn plain  T'extort from thence the slow reluctant grain  The slow reluctant grain procur'd today  His less industrious neighbour steals away  Hence fists and clubs the villagepeace confound  Till sword and cannon spread the ruin round  For time and art but bring from bad to worse  Unequal lots succeed unequal force  Each lot a several curse Hence rich and poor  This pines and dies neglected at the door  While gouts and fevers wait the loaded mess  And take full vengeance for the poor's distress  No more the passions are the springs of life  But seeds of vice and elements of strife  Love social love t' extend to all design'd  Back to its fountain flows to self confin'd  Source of misfortunes the fond husband's wrong  The maid dishonour'd and deserted young  The mischief spreads when vengeance for the lust  Unpeoples realms and calls the ruin just  Hence Troy thy fate the blood of thousands spilt  And orphans mourning for unconscious guilt  Thus love destroys for kinder purpose giv'n  And man corrupts the blessings meant by heav'n  Selfinjur'd let us censure HIM no more  Ambition makes us slaves and av'rice poor  What arts the wild disorder shall controul  And render peace

this mankind by sad experience taught  Again their safety in dependence sought  Press'd to the standard sued before the throne  And durst rely on wisdom not their own  Hence Saturn rul'd in peace th' Ausonian plains  While Salian songs to virtue won the swains  But pois'nous streams must flow from poison'd springs  The priests were mortal and meer men the kings  What aid from monarchs mighty to enslave  What good from teachers cunning to deceive  Allegiance gives defensive arms away  And faith usurps imperial reason's sway  Let civil Rome from faithful records tell  What royal blessings from her Nero fell  When those prefer'd all grievance to redress  Bought of their prince a licence to oppress  When uncorrupted merit found no place  But left the trade of honour to the base  See industry by draining imposts curst  Starve in the harvest in the vintage thirst  In vain for help th' insulted matron cries  'Twas death in husbands to have ears and eyes  Fatal were beauty virtue wealth or

every change whatever stage I run  My daily wish succeeds THY WILL BE DONE  An Epistle from a SWISS OFFICER TO HIS FRIEND at Rome  FROM horrid mountains ever hid in snow  And barren lands and dreary plains below  To you dear sir my best regards I send  The weakest reas'ner as the truest friend  Your arguments that vainly strive to please  Your arts your country and your palaces  What signs of Roman grandeur still remain  Much you have said and much have said in vain  Fine pageants these for slaves to please the eye  And put the neatest dress on misery  Bred up to slav'ry and dissembled pain  Unhappy man you trifle with your chain  But shou'd your friend with your desires comply  And sell himself to Rome and slavery  He could not wear his trammels with that art  Or hide the noble anguish of his heart  You'd soon repent the livery you gave  For trust me I shou'd make an awkard slave  Falsely you blame our barren rocks and plains  Happy in freedom and laborious swains  Our peasants chearful to the field repair  And can enjoy the labours of the year  Whilst yours beneath some tree with mournful eyes  Sees for his haughty lord his harvests rise  Then silent sighs but stops his slavish breath  He silent sighs for should he speak 'tis death  Hence from our field the lazy grain we call  Too much for want for luxury too small  Whilst all Campania's rich inviting soil  Scarce knows the plowshare or the reaper's toil  In arms we breed our youth To dart from far  And aim aright the thunder of the war  To whirl the faulchion and direct the blow  To ward the stroke or bear upon the foe  Early in hardships thro' the woods they fly  Nor feel the piercing frost or wintry sky  Some prowling wolf or foamy boar to meet  And stretch the panting savage at their feet  Inur'd by this they seek a nobler war  And show an honest pride in ev'ry scar  With joy the danger and the blood partake  Whilst ev'ry wound is for their country's sake  But you soft warriors forc'd into the field  Or faintly strike or impotently yield  For well this universal truth you know  Who fights for tyrants is his country's foe  I envy not your arts the Roman schools  Improv'd perhaps but to inslave your souls  May you to stone or nerves or beauty give  And teach the soft'ning marble how to live  May you the passions in your colours trace  And work up every piece with every grace  In airs and attitudes be wond'rous wise  And know the arts to please or to surprize  In musick's softest sound consume the day  Sounds that would melt the warrior's soul away  Vain efforts these an honest fame to raise  Your painters and your eunuchs be your praise  Grant us more real goods you heav'nly pow'rs  Virtue and arms and liberty be ours  Weak are your offers to the free and brave  No bribe can purchase me to be a slave  Hear me ye rocks ye mountains and ye plains  The happy bounds of our Helvetian swains  In thee my country will I fix my seat  Nor envy the poor wretch that would be great  My life and arms I dedicate to thee  For know it is my int'rest to be free  LIFE burthensome because we know not how to use it An EPISTLE  WHAT sira month and not one line afford  'Tis wellhow finely some folk keep their word  I own my promiseBut to steal an hour  'Midst all this hurry'tis not in my pow'r  Where life each day does one fix'd order keep  Successive journies weariness and sleep  Or if our scheme some interval allows  Some hours design'd for thought and for repose  Soon as the scatter'd images begin  In the mind to rallycompany comes in  Reason adieu there's no more room to think  For all the day behind is noise and drink  Thus life rolls on but not without regret  Whene'er at morning in some cool retreat  I walk alone'tis then in thought I view  Some sage of old 'tis then I think of you  Whose breast no tyrant passions ever seize  No pulse that riots blood that disobeys  Who follow but where judgment points the way  And whom too busy sense ne'er led astray  Not that you joys with moderation shun  You taste all pleasures but indulge in none  Fir'd by this image I resolve anew  'Tis reason calls and peace and joy's in view  How bless'd a change a long adieu to sense  Oh shield me sapience virtue's reign commence  Alas how short a reignthe walk is o'er  The dinner waits and friends some half a score  At first to virtue firm the glass I fly  'Till some fly sot"Not drink the family"  Thus gratitude is made to plead for sin  My trait'rous breast a party forms within  And inclination brib'd we never want  Excuse"'Tis hot and walking makes one faint"  Now sense gets strength my bright resolves decay  Like stars that melt at the approach of day  Thought dies and ev'n at last your image fades away  My head grows warm all reason I despise  "Today be happy and tomorrow wise"  Betray'd so oft I'm half persuaded now  Surely to fail the first step is to vow  The country lately 'twas my wish oh there  Gardens diversions friends relations air  For London now dear London how I burn  I must be happy sure when I return  Whoever hopes true happiness to see  Hopes for what never was nor e'er will be  The nearest ease since we must suffer still  Are they who dare be patient under ill  Whilom a fool saw where a fiddle lay  And after poring round it strove to play  Above below across all ways he tries  He tries in vain 'tis discord all and noise  Fretting he threw it by then thus the lout  "There's musick in it could I fetch it out"  If life does not its harmony impart  We want not instruments but have not art  'Tis endless to defer our hopes of ease  Till crosses end and disappointments cease  The sage is happy not that all goes right  His cattle feel no rot his corn no blight  The mind for ease is fitted to the wise  Not so the fool's'tis here the difference lies  Their prospect is the same but various are their eyes  The Duty of Employing one's Self An EPISTLE  FEW people know it yet dear sir 'tis true  Man should have somewhat evermore to do  Hard labour's tedious every one must own  But surely better such by far than none  The perfect drone the quite impertinent  Whose life at nothing aims butto be spent  Such heaven visits for some mighty ill  'Tis sure the hardest labour to sit still  Hence that unhappy tribe who nought pursue  Who sin for want of something else to do  Sir John is bless'd with riches honour love  And to be bless'd indeed needs only move  For want of this with pain he lives away  A lump of hardlyanimated clay  Dull till his double bottle does him right  He's easy just at twelve o'clock at night  Thus for one sparkling hour alone he's blest  Whilst spleen and headach seize on all the rest  What numbers sloth with gloomy humours fills  Racking their brains with visionary ills  Hence what loud outcries and wellmeaning rage  What endless quarrels at the present age  How many blame how often may we hear  "Such vicewell sure the last day must be near"  T' avoid such wild imaginary pains  The sad creation of distemper'd brains  Dispatch dear friend move labour sweat run fly  Do aughtbut think the day of judgment nigh  There are who've lost all relish for delight  With them no earthly thing is ever right  T' expect to alter to their taste were vain  For who can mend so fast as they complain  Whate'er you do shall be a crime with such  One while you've lost your tongue then talk too much  Thus shall you meet their waspish censure still  As hedgehogs prick you go which side you will  Oh pity these whene'er you see them swell  Folks call 'em crosspoor men they are not well  How many such in indolence grown old  With vigour ne'er do any thing but scold  Who spirits only from illhumour get  Like wines that die unless upon the fret  Weary'd of flouncing to himself alone  Acerbus keeps a man to fret upon  The fellow's nothing in the earth to do  But to sit quiet and be scolded to  Pishes and oaths whene'er the master's sour'd  All largely on the scapegoat slave are pour'd  This drains his rage and tho' to John so rough  Abroad you'd think him complaisant enough  As for myself whom poverty prevents  From being angry at so great expence  Who should I ever be inclin'd to rage  For want of slaves war with myself must wage  Must rail and hear chastising be chastis'd  Be both the tyrant and the tyranniz'd  I choose to labour rather than to fret  What's rage in some in me goes off in sweat  If times are ill and things seem never worse  Men manners to reclaimI take my horse  One mile reforms 'em or if aught remain  Unpurg'd'tis but to ride as far again  Thus on myself in toils I spend my rage  I pay the fine and that absolves the age  Sometimes still more to interrupt my ease  I take my pen and writesuch things as these  Which though all other merit be deny'd  Shew my devotion still to be employ'd  Add too tho' writing be itself a curse  Yet some distempers are a cure for worse  And since 'midst indolence spleen will prevail  Since who do nothing else are sure to rail  Man should be suffer'd thus to play the fool  To keep from hurt as children go to school  You shou'd not rhyme in spite of naturetrue  Yet sure 'tis greater trouble if you do  And if 'tis lab'ring only men profess  Who writes the hardest writes with most success  Thus for myself and friends I do my part  Promoting doubly the painstaking art  First to myself 'tis labour to compose  To read such lines is drudgery to those  On SCRIBLING against GENIUS An EPISTLE  NO single rule's more frequently enjoin'd  Than this "Observe the byass of your mind"  However just by ev'ry one confess'd  There's not a rule more frequently transgress'd  For mortals to their int'rest blind pursue  The thing they like not that they're fit to do  This Verro's fault by frequent praises fir'd  He several parts had try'd in each admir'd  That Verro was not ev'ry way compleat  'Twas long unknown and might have been so yet  But musickmad th' unhappy man pursu'd  That only thing heav'n meant he never shou'd  And thus his proper road to fame neglected  He's ridicul'd for that he but affected  Wou'd men but act from nature's secret call  Or only where that fails not act at all  If not their skill they'd shew at least good sense  They'd get no famenor wou'd they give offence  Not that where some one merit is deny'd  Men must be ev'ry way unqualify'd  Nor hold we like that wrongconcluding wight  A man can't fishbecause he cou'd not write  View all the world around each man design'd  And furnish'd for some fav'rite part you find  That sometimes low yet this so small a gift  Proves nature did not turn him quite adrift  The phlegmatick dull awkward thick grosswitted  Have all some clumsy work for which they're fitted  'Twas never known in men a perfect void  Ev'n I and Tld might be well employ'd  Wou'd we our poverty of parts survey  And follow as our genius led the way  What then obedient to that turn of mind  Shou'd men jog on to one dull path confin'd  From that small circle never dare depart  To strike at large and snatch a grace from art  At least with care forbidden paths pursue  Who quits the road shou'd keep it still in view  From genius some few scapes may be allow'd  But ever keep within its neighbourhood  But Cr faithless to his byass see  With giantsin opposing heav'n's decree  Still fond where he shou'd not he blunders on  With all that haste fools make to be undone  Want of success his passion but augments  Like eunuchs rage of love from impotence  'Mongst all the instances of genius crost  The rhyming tribe are they who err the most  Each piddling wretch who hath but common sense  Or thinks he hath to verse shall make pretence  Why not 'tis their diversion and 'twere hard  If men of their estates shou'd be debarr'd  Thus wealth with them gives every thing beside  As people worth so much are qualify'd  They've all the requisites for writing fit  All but that onesome little share of wit  Give way ye friends nor with fond pray'rs proceed  To stop the progress of a pen full speed  'Tis heav'n incens'd by some prodigious crime  Thus for men's sins determines them to rhyme  Bad men no doubt perhaps 'tis vengeance due  For shrines they've plunder'd or some wretch they slew  Whate'er it be sure grievous is th' offence  And grievous is heav'n knows its recompence  At once in want of rhyme and want of rest  Plagues to themselves and to mankind a jest  Seduc'd by empty forms of false delight  Such in some men their deadly lust to write  Ev'n I whose genius seems as much forgot  Mine when I write as yours when you do not  Who gravely thus can others faults condemn  My self allowing what I blame in them  With no pretence to Phoebus' aid divine  Nor the least int'rest in the tuneful nine  With all the guilt of impotence in view  Griev'd for past sins but yet committing new  Whate'er the wits may say or wise may think  Am fooling ev'ry day with pen and ink  When all who wish me best begin t' advise  'That being witty is not being wise  'That if the voice of int'rest might be heard  'For one who wears a gownwou'd be prefer'd  Incorrigibly deaf I feign a yawn  And mock their just

thousand ways  Who with variety of arts puts on  All other persons and throws off his own  Whose looks well disciplin'd his will obey  Bloom at command or at command decay  Nor blush my muse those changes to impart  Which ask an Ovid's or Apollo's art  But who Apollo all the arts can trace  All the deceits of that delusive face  For lo in fight the various artist comes  Lo how in beauty and in health he blooms  Its smoothest charms triumphant youth supplies  Laughs in his cheeks and sparkles in his eyes  But sudden see the scene is snatch'd away  See each inverted feature in decay  His muscles all relax'd his face o'ergrown  Rough and emboss'd with wrinkles not his own  He trails his dangling legs the wond'ring train  Laugh at the solemn conduct of his cane  Rapt thro' the scenes of life he drops his prime  A cripple sixty years before his time  Runs in a moment all its stages o'er  And steps from four and twenty to fourscore  Now he a venerable judge appears  And the long garb of lazy purple wears  Like drowsy P**'s looks his aged frame  His mien his habit and address the same  When to the sneering croud he lisps a joke  Puns from the law or quibbles out of Coke  With settled air and most judicious face  Nods o'er the cushion council and the case  Slumbers and hears by starts the noisy train  Catches a period and drops down again  And now his hearers in their turn to lull  Himself stands up most venerably dull  Talks of old times commends their loyal zeal  Their wholsome statutes discipline and ale  On different themes bestows one common praise  The Thames the streets the king and king's highways  You see him quit the bench and strait appear  An huge old gouty council at the bar  Bawl for his client wrest the tortur'd laws  From their true sense and mould them to the cause  In solemn form harange the list'ning croud  And hem and cough emphatically loud  Blest art indeed and glorious eloquence  Where empty noise supplies the want of sense  For meaning signs and motions he affords  And interjections for the want of words  What shape to you O S**s is unknown  What face but you adopt into your own  At the least hint fictitious crouds you raise  And multiply yourself ten thousand ways  This moment to indulge the mirthful vein  A fool's or doctor's person you sustain  The next resume yourself and sense again  Am I deceiv'd or by some sudden slight  A starcht tubpreacher now he strikes the sight  Quick the transition and unseen the art  Pale and entirely chang'd in ev'ry part  His short'ned visage and fantastick dress  The mad fanatick to the life express  That small silk cap those puritanick hairs  Crop'd to the quick and circling round his ears  That rounded face the mimick here proclaim  How very different yet how still the same  Now he by just degrees his silence breaks  His frantick silence mutt'ring ere he speaks  Protracted hums the solemn farce begin  And groans and pauses interrupt the scene  As each in just succession comes and goes  Work'd to its pitch the spirit stronger grows  And squeezes out his eyes and twangs his vocal nose  Now quick and rapid and in rage more loud  A storm of nonsense bursts upon the croud  His hand and voice proclaim the gen'ral doom  While this the hourglass shakes and that the room  On nature's ruins all his doctrines dwell  And throw wide open every gate of hell  A thousand other shapes he wears with grace  A thousand more varieties of face  But who in every shape can count him o'er  Who multiplies his person every hour  What muse his flying features can pursue  Or keep his wand'ring countenance in view  Had I a thousand mouths a thousand tongues  A throat of brass and adamantine lungs  I could not celebrate this Proteus' skill  Who shifts his person and his face at will  This

Gilded his ev'ning hours and harmoniz'd his soul  To woods and caves she never bade retreat  Nor fix'd in cloyster'd monkeries her seat  No lonely precepts to her sons enjoin'd  Nor taught them to be men to shun mankind  CYNICKS there were an uncouth selfish race  Of manners foul and boastful of disgrace  Brutes whom no muse has ever lov'd to name  Whose Ignominy is their only fame  No hostile Trophies grace their honour'd urn  Around their tomb no sculptur'd Virtues mourn  Nor tells the marble into emblems grav'd  An Art discover'd or a City sav'd  Be this the goal to which the BritonPeer

of ill from Kings at first begins  But Priests must aid and consecrate their sins  The tortur'd Subject might be heard complain  When sinking under a new weight of chain  Or more rebellious might

palmam  JUV  Th' ambiguous laurel and the doubtful name  The RESOLUTION An ELEGY  Written in the Year  TOO much my heart of beauty's pow'r hath known  Too long to love hath reason left the throne  Too long my better genius mourn'd his chain  And youth's unvalued hours consum'd in vain  My wishes lull'd with soft inglorious dreams  Forgot the patriot's and the sage's themes  Thro' many a painted vale and fairy grove  Thro' all th' enchanted paradise of love  Misled by sickly hope's delusive flame  Averse to action and renouncing fame  At length the visionary scenes decay  At length my eyes confess the newborn day  Whose faithful beams detect the dang'rous road  In which my heedless feet securely trod  And strip the phantoms of their lying charms  Which lur'd my soul from wisdom's peaceful arms  Now for smooth streams and banks bespread with flow'rs  For myrtle walks and amaranthine bow'rs  Lo barren heaths appear and pathless woods  And rocks incumbent o'er unfathom'd floods  For happy smiles for openness of heart  Looks bright with love and passion scorning art  Lo sullen spite and cunning lust of gain  And cruel pride and insolent disdain  For graceful ease lo affectation walks  And dull halfsense for wit and wisdom talks  O youth whoe'er dost beauty's paths attend  Paths which in love's perfidious mansion end  O learn from me what pomp surrounds his throne  For I have known the place too well have known  There burning fury heav'n and earth defies  And dumb despair in icy fetters lies  And black suspicion bends his gloomy brow  The unblest image of himself to view  And blind belief with all a lover's flame  Sinks in those arms which clothe his head with shame  There wan dejection falt'ring as he goes  In shades and silence vainly seeks repose  Musing thro' pathless wilds consumes the day  Then lost in darkness weeps the hours away  There the gay train of luxury advance  To Lydian sounds adapting Circe's dance  On every head the vernal garland glows  In every hand the purple goblet flows  The Syren views them with exulting eyes  And laughs at bashful virtue as she flies  Are these delights which I should wish to gain  Is this th' elysium of a sober brain  To watch for happiness in female smiles  Bear all her scorn be caught with all her wiles  Her mercy with a coward's skill to crave  Bless her hard bonds and boast to be her slave  To feel for trifles a distracting train  Of fears and wishes equally in vain  This hour to tremble and the next to glow  Can pride can human sense descend so low  When virtue at an easier price displays  The sacred wreath of honourable praise  When wisdom utters her divine decree  To laugh at serious folly and be free  I bid adieu then to these woful scenes  I bid adieu to all the sex of queens  Adieu to every suff'ring simple foul  Who lets a woman's will his peace controul  There laugh ye witty and rebuke ye grave  I scorn to boast that I have been a slave  I bid the whining brotherhood begone  Joy to my heart my wishes are my own  Farewel the female heav'n the female hell  To thee great God of Love a glad farewel  Thy wild misrule at length has freed my heart  And reason passion force thee to depart  But wherefore dost thou linger on thy way  Why vainly search for some pretence to stay  When crouds of vassals court thy pleasing yoke  And countless victims bow them to the stroke  Lo round thy shrine a thousand youths advance  Warm with the gentle ardours of romance  Each vows t' assert his nymph with feats of arms  Till hostile champions kneeling own her charms  Ten thousand girls with rosy chaplets crown'd  To groves and streams thy tender triumph sound  Each bids the stream in murmurs tell her flame  Each calls the grove to sigh her shepherd's name  But if thy pride such obvious honour scorn  If nobler off'rings must thy shrine adorn  To yonder rev'rend maid direct thy wing  To that rich harvest of the fiftieth spring  Her shalt thou bind in thy delightful chains  And thrill with gentle pangs her wither'd veins  Thy wishful warmth her frosty cheek shall dye  And dreams of rapture melt her maudlin eye  Be these thy glories But no more presume  That my rebellious heart will yield thee room  I know thy puny force thy simple wiles  I break triumphant thro' thy slender toils  I see thy dying lamp's last languid glow  Thy arrows blunted and unbrac'd thy bow  I feel diviner fires my breast inflame  For active science and ingenuous fame  Resume the paths my earlier choice began  And lose with pride the lover in the man  The ENTHUSIAST  OR THE LOVER of NATURE A POEM  By the Rev Mr JOSEPH WARTON  Rure vero barbaroque laetatur  MARTIAL  Ut mihi devio  Rupes vacuum nemus  Mirari libet  HORACE  YE green rob'd Dryads oft' at dusky eve  By wondering shepherds seen to forests brown  To unfrequented meads and pathless wilds  Lead me from gardens deck'd with art's vain pomps  Can gilt alcoves can marble mimick gods  Parterres embroider'd obelisks and urns  Of high relief can the long spreading lake  Or vista lessening to the sight can Stow  With all her Attick fanes such raptures raise  As the thrushhaunted copse where lightly leaps  The fearful fawn the rustling leaves along  And the brisk squirrel sports from bough to bough  While from an hollow oak whose naked roots  O'erhang a pensive rill the busy bees  Hum drowsy lullabies The bards of old  Fair nature's friends sought such retreats to charm  Sweet Echo with their songs oft' too they met  In summer evenings near sequester'd bow'rs  Or mountainnymph or muse and eager learn'd  The moral strains she taught to mend mankind  As to a secret grot Aegeria stole  With patriot Numa and in silent night  Whisper'd him sacred laws he list'ning sat  Rapt with her virtuous voice old Tyber lean'd  Attentive on his urn and hush'd his waves  Rich in her weeping country's spoils Versailles  May boast a thousand fountains that can cast  The tortur'd waters to the distant heav'ns  Yet let me choose some pinetop'd precipice  Abrupt and shaggy whence a foamy stream  Like Anio tumbling roars or some bleak heath  Where straggling stand the mournful juniper  Or yewtree scath'd while in clear prospect round  From the grove's bosom spires emerge and smoak  In bluish wreaths ascends ripe harvests wave  Low lonely cottages and ruin'd tops  Of Gothick battlements appear and streams  Beneath the sun beams twinklethe shrill lark  That wakes the woodman to his early task  Or lovesick Philomel whose luscious lays  Sooth lone nightwanderers the moaning dove  Pitied by listening milkmaid far excell  The deepmouth'd viol the soullulling lute  And battlebreathing trumpet Artful sounds  That please not like the choristers of air  When first they hail th' approach of laughing May  Can Kent design like nature Mark where Thames  Plenty and pleasure pours thro'  The earl of Lincoln's terrace at Weybridge in Surry one of the finest spots in Europe  Lincoln's meads  Can the great artist tho' with taste supreme  Endu'd one beauty to this Eden add  Tho' he by rules unfetter'd boldly scorns  Formality and method round and square  Disdaining plans irregularly great  Creative Titian can thy vivid strokes  Or thine O graceful Raphael dare to vie  With the rich tints that paint the breathing mead  The thousandcolour'd tulip violet's bell  Snowclad and meek the vermiltinctur'd rose  And golden crocusYet with these the maid  Phillis or Phoebe at a feast or wake  Her jetty locks enamels fairer she  In innocence and homespun vestments dress'd  Than if coerulean saphires at her ears  Shone pendent or a precious diamondcross  Heav'd gently on her panting bosom white  Yon' shepherd idly stretch'd on the rude rock  Listening to dashing waves and seamews clang  Highhovering o'er his head who views beneath  The dolphin dancing o'er the level brine  Feels more true bliss than the proud admiral  Amid his vessels bright with burnish'd gold  And silken streamers tho' his lordly nod  Ten thousand warworn mariners revere  And great Aeneas  Aeneid VIII  gaz'd with more delight  On the rough mountain shagg'd with horrid shades  Where cloudcompelling Jove as fancy dream'd  Descending shook his direful Aegisblack  Than if he enter'd the high Capitol  On golden columns rear'd a conquer'd world  Exhausted to enrich its stately head  More pleas'd he slept in poor Evander's cott  On shaggy skins lull'd by sweet nightingales  Than if a Nero in an age refin'd  Beneath a gorgeous canopy had plac'd  His royal guest and bade his minstrels sound  Soft slumb'rous Lydian airs to sooth his rest  See Lucretius lib V  Happy the first of men ere yet confin'd  To smoaky cities who in sheltering groves  Warm caves and deepsunk vallies liv'd and lov'd  By cares unwounded what the sun and showers  And genial earth untillag'd could produce  They gather'd grateful or the acorn brown  Or blushing berry by the liquid lapse  Of murm'ring waters call'd to slake their thirst  Or with fair nymphs their sunbrown limbs to bathe  With nymphs who fondly clasp their fav'rite youths  Unaw'd by shame beneath the beechen shade  Nor wiles nor artificial coyness knew  Then doors and walls were not the melting maid  Nor frowns of parents fear'd nor husband's threats  Nor had curs'd gold their tender hearts allur'd  Then beauty was not venal Injur'd love  O whither God of raptures art thou fled  While avarice waves his golden wand around  Abhorr'd magician and his costly cup  Prepares with baneful drugs t'enchant the souls  Of each lowthoughted fair to wed for gain  In earth's first infancy as sung the  Lucretius  bard  Who strongly painted what he boldly thought  Tho' the fierce north oft smote with iron whip  Their shiv'ring limbs tho' oft the bristly boar  Or hungry lion 'woke them with their howls  And scar'd them from their mossgrown caves to rove  Houseless and cold in dark tempestuous nights  Yet were not myriads in embattel'd fields  Swept off at once nor had the raging seas  O'erwhelm'd the found'ring bark and shrieking crew  In vain the glassy ocean smil'd to tempt  The jolly sailor unsuspecting harm  For commerce ne'er had spread her swelling sails  Nor had the wond'ring Nereids ever heard  The dashing oar then famine want and pine  Sunk to the grave their fainting limbs but us  Diseaseful dainties riot and excess  And feverish luxury destroy In brakes  Or marshes wild unknowingly they crop'd  Herbs of malignant juice to realms remote  While we for powerful poisons madly roam  From every noxious herb collecting death  What tho' unknown to those primaeval sires  The wellarch'd dome peopled with breathing forms  By fair Italia's skilful hand unknown  The shapely column and the crumbling busts  Of awful ancestors in long descent  Yet why should man mistaken deem it nobler  To dwell in palaces and highroof'd halls  Than in God's forests architect supreme  Say is the Persian carpet than the field's  Or meadow's mantle gay more richly wov'n  Or softer to the votaries of ease  Than bladed grass perfum'd with dewdrop'd flow'rs  O taste corrupt that luxury and pomp  In specious names of polish'd manners veil'd  Should proudly banish nature's simple charms  Allbeauteous nature by thy boundless charms  Oppress'd O where shall I begin thy praise  Where turn th' ecstatick eye how ease my breast  That pants with wild astonishment and love  Dark forests and the opening lawn refresh'd  With evergushing brooks hill meadow dale  The balmy beanfield the gayclover'd close  So sweetly interchang'd the lowing ox  The playful lamb the distant waterfall  Now faintly heard now swelling with the breeze  The sound of pastoral reed from hazelbower  The choral birds the neighing steed that snuffs  His dappled mate stung with intense desire  The ripen'd orchard when the ruddy orbs  Betwixt the green leaves blush the azure skies  The chearful sun that thro' earth's vitals pours  Delight and health and heat all all conspire  To raise to sooth to harmonize the mind  To lift on wings of praise to the great sire  Of being and of beauty at whose nod  Creation started from the gloomy vault  Of dreary Chaos while the griesly king  Murmur'd to feel his boisterous power confin'd  What are the lays of artful Addison  Coldly correct to Shakespear's warblings wild  Whom on the winding Avon's willow'd banks  Fair fancy found and bore the smiling babe  To a close cavern still the shepherds shew  The sacred place whence with religious awe  They hear returning from the field at eve  Strange whisp'ring of sweet musick thro' the air  Here as with honey gather'd from the rock  She fed the little prattler and with songs  Oft' sooth'd his wondering ears with deep delight  On her soft lap he sat and caught the founds  Oft' near some crouded city would I walk  Listening the faroff noises rattling cars  Loud shouts of joy sad shrieks of sorrow knells  Full slowly tolling instruments of trade  Striking mine ears with one deepswelling hum  Or wand'ring near the sea attend the sounds  Of hollow winds and everbeating waves  Ev'n when wild tempests swallow up the plains  And Boreas' blasts big hail and rains combine  To shake the groves and mountains would I sit  Pensively musing on th' outragious crimes  That wake heav'n's vengeance at such solemn hours  Daemons and goblins thro' the dark air shriek  While Hecat with her blackbrow'd sisters nine  Rides o'er the earth and scatters woes and death  Then too they say in drear Aegyptian wilds  The lion and the tiger prowl for prey  With roarings loud the list'ning traveller  Starts fearstruck while the hollowechoing vaults  Of pyramids encrease the deathful sounds  But let me never fail in cloudless nights  When silent Cynthia in her silver car  Thro' the blue concave slides when shine the hills  Twinkle the streams and woods look tip'd with gold  To seek some level mead and there invoke  Old midnight's sister Contemplation sage  Queen of the rugged brow and sternfix'd eye  To lift my soul above this little earth  This follyfetter'd world to purge my ears  That I may hear the rolling planet's song  And tuneful turning spheres if this be barr'd  The little Fayes that dance in neighbouring dales  Sipping the nightdew while they laugh and love  Shall charm me with aërial notesAs thus  I wander musing lo what awful forms  Yonder appear sharpey'd Philosophy  Clad in dun robes an eagle on his wrist  First meets my eye next virgin Solitude  Serene who blushes at each gazer's sight  Then Wisdom's hoary head with crutch in hand  Trembling and bent with age last Virtue's self  Smiling in white array'd who with her leads  Sweet Innocence that prattles by her side  A naked boyHarrass'd with fear I stop  I gaze when Virtue thus'Whoe'er thou art  'Mortal by whom I deign to be beheld  'In these my midnightwalks depart and say  'That henceforth I and my immortal train  'Forsake Britannia's isle who fondly stoops  'To Vice her favourite paramourShe spoke  And as she turn'd her round and rosy neck  Her flowing train and long ambrosial hair  Breathing rich odours I enamour'd view  O who will bear me then to western climes  Since Virtue leaves our wretched land to fields  Yet unpolluted with Iberian swords  To isles of innocence from mortal view  Deeply retir'd beneath a plantane's shade  Where Happiness and Quiet sit enthron'd  With simple Indian swains that I may hunt  The boar and tiger thro' Savannah's wild  Thro' fragrant desarts and thro' citrongroves  There fed on dates and herbs would I despise  The farfetch'd cates of Luxury and hoards  Of narrowhearted Avarice nor heed  The distant din of the tumultuous world  So when rude whirlwinds rouze the roaring main  Beneath fair Thetis sits in coral caves  Serenely gay nor sinking sailors cries  Disturb her sportive nymphs who round her form  The light fantastick dance or for her hair  Weave rosy crowns or with according lutes  Grace the soft warbles of her honied voice  An ODE to FANCY  By the Same  O Parent of each lovely Muse  Thy spirit o'er my soul diffuse  O'er all my artless songs preside  My footsteps to thy temple guide  To offer at thy turfbuilt shrine  In golden cups no costly wine  No murder'd fat'ling of the flock  But flowers and honey from the rock  O nymph with looselyflowing hair  With buskin'd leg and bosom bare  Thy waist with myrtlegirdle bound  Thy brows with Indian feathers crown'd  Waving in thy snowy hand  An allcommanding magick wand  Of pow'r to bid fresh gardens blow  'Mid chearless Lapland's barren snow  Whose rapid wings thy flight convey  Thro' air and over earth and sea  While the vast various landscape lies  Conspicuous to thy piercing eyes  O lover of the desart hail  Say in what deep and pathless vale  Or on what hoary mountain's side  'Midst falls of water you reside  'Midst broken rocks a rugged scene  With green and grassy dales between  'Midst forests dark of aged oak  Ne'er echoing with the woodman's stroke  Where never human art appear'd  Nor ev'n one strawroof'd cott was rear'd  Where NATURE seems to sit alone  Majestick on a craggy throne  Tell me the path sweet wand'rer tell  To thy unknown sequester'd cell  Where woodbines cluster round the door  Where shells and moss o'erlay the floor  And on whose top an hawthorn blows  Amid whose thicklywoven boughs  Some nightingale still builds her nest  Each evening warbling thee to rest  Then lay me by the haunted stream  Wrapt in some wild poetick dream  In converse while methinks I rove  With SPENSER thro' a fairy grove  Till suddenly awak'd I hear  Strange whisper'd musick in my ear  And my glad soul in bliss is drown'd  By the sweetlysoothing sound  Me Goddess by the righthand lead  Sometimes thro' the yellow mead  Where JOY and whiterob'd PEACE resort  And VENUS keeps her festive court  Where MIRTH and YOUTH each evening meet  And lightly trip with nimble feet  Nodding their lillycrowned heads  Where LAUGHTER roselip'd HEBE leads  Where ECHO walks steep hills among  List'ning to the shepherd's song  Yet not these flowery fields of joy  Can long my pensive mind employ  Haste FANCY from the scenes of folly  To meet the matron MELANCHOLY  Goodess of the tearful eye  That loves to fold her arms and sigh  Let us with silent footsteps go  To charnels and the house of woe  To Gothick churches vaults and tombs  Where each sad night some virgin comes  With throbbing breast and faded cheek  Her promis'd bridegroom's urn to seek  Or to some Abby's mould'ring tow'rs  Where to avoid cold wintry show'rs  The naked beggar shivering lies  While whistling tempests round her rise  And trembles lest the tottering wall  Should on her sleeping infants fall  Now let us louder strike the lyre  For my heart glows with martial fire  I feel I feel with sudden heat  My big tumultuous bosom beat  The trumpet's clangors pierce my ear  A thousand widows' shrieks I hear  Give me another horse I cry  Lo the base GALLIC squadrons fly  Whence is this ragewhat spirit say  To battle hurries me away  'Tis FANCY in her fiery car  Transports me to the thickest war  There whirls me o'er the hills of slain  Where Tumult and Destruction reign  Where mad with pain the wounded steed  Tramples the dying and the dead  Where giant Terror stalks around  With sullen joy surveys the ground  And pointing to th' ensanguin'd field  Shakes his dreadful Gorgonshield  O guide me from this horrid scene  To higharch'd walks and alleys green  Which lovely LAURA seeks to shun  The fervors of the midday sun  The pangs of absence O remove  For thou can'st place me near my love  Can'st fold in visionary bliss  And let me think I steal a kiss  While her ruby lips dispense  Luscious nectar's quintessence  When youngey'd SPRING profusely throws  From her green lap the pink and rose  When the soft turtle of the dale  To SUMMER tells her tender tale  When AUTUMN cooling caverns seeks  And stains with wine his jolly cheeks  When WINTER like poor pilgrim old  Shakes his silver beard with cold  At every season let my ear  Thy solemn whispers FANCY hear  O warm enthusiastick maid  Without thy powerful vital aid  That breathes an energy divine  That gives a soul to every line  Ne'er may I strive with lips profane  To utter an unhallow'd strain  Nor dare to touch the sacred string  Save when with smiles thou bid'st me sing  O hear our prayer O hither come  From thy lamented SHAKESPEAR's tomb  On which thou lov'st to sit at eve  Musing o'er thy darling's grave  O queen of numbers once again  Animate some chosen swain  Who fill'd with unexhausted fire  May rise above the rhyming throng  Who with some new unequall'd song  May boldly smite the sounding lyre  O'er all our list'ning passions reign  O'erwhelm our souls with joy and pain  With terror shake with pity move  Rouze with revenge or melt with love  O deign t'attend his evening walk  With him in groves and grottos talk  Teach him to scorn with frigid art  Feebly to touch th' unraptur'd heart  Like light'ning let his mighty verse  The bosom's inmost foldings pierce  With native beauties win applause  Beyond cold critick's studied laws  O let each Muse's fame encrease  O bid BRITANNIA rival GREECE  STANZAS written on taking the Air after a long Illness  By the Same  I  HAIL genial sun I feel thy powerful ray  Strike vigorous health into each languid vein  Lo at thy bright approach are fled away  The paleey'd sisters Grief Disease and Pain  II  O hills O forests and thou painted mead  Again admit me to your secret seats  From the dark bed of pining sickness free'd  With double joy I seek your green retreats  III  Yet once more O ye rivers shall I lie  In summer evenings on your willow'd banks  And unobserv'd by passing shepherd's eye  View the light Naiads trip in wanton ranks  IV  Each rural object charms so long unseen  The blooming orchards the white wand'ring flocks  The fields array'd in sightrefreshing green  And with his loosen'd yoke the wearied ox  V  Here let me stop beneath this spreading bush  While Zephyr's voice I hear the boughs among  And listen to the sweet thickwarbling thrush  Much have I wish'd to hear her vernal song  VI  The Dryad health frequents this hallow'd grove  O where may I the lovely virgin meet  From morn till dewy evening will I rove  To find het haunts and lay an off'ring at her feet  The Two Beavers A FABLE  By the Rev Mr DUCK  'TWere well my friend for human kind  Would ev'ry man his bus'ness mind  In his own orbit always move  Nor blame nor envy those above  A Beaver well advanc'd in age  By long experience render'd sage  Was skill'd in all the useful arts  And justly deem'd a beast of parts  Which he apply'd as patriots shou'd  In cultivating publick good  This Beaver on a certain day  A friendly visit went to pay  To a young cousin pert and vain  Who often rov'd about the plain  With ev'ry idle beast conferr'd  Hearing and telling what he heard  The vagrant youth was gone from home  When th' ancient sage approach'd his dome  Who each apartment view'd with care  But found each wanted much repair  The walls were crack'd decay'd the doors  The corn lay mouldy on the floors  Thro' gaping crannies rush'd amain  The blust'ring winds with snow and rain  The timber all was rotten grown  In short the house was tumbling down  The gen'rous beast by pity sway'd  Griev'd to behold it thus decay'd  And while he mourn'd the tatter'd scene  The master of the lodge came in  The first congratulations o'er  They rest recumbent on the floor  When thus the young conceited beast  His thoughts impertinent express'd  I long have been surpriz'd to find  The lion grown so wond'rous kind  To one peculiar sort of beasts  While he another sort detests  His royal favour chiefly falls  Upon the species of jackalls  They share the profits of his throne  He smiles on them and them alone  Mean while the ferret's useful race  He scarce admits to see his face  Traduc'd by lies and ill report  They're banish'd from his regal court  And counted over all the plain  Opposers of the lion's reign  Now I conceiv'd a scheme last night  Would doubtless set this matter right  These parties should unite together  The lion partial be to neither  But let them both his favours share  And both consult in peace and war  This method were this method try'd  Would spread politick basis wide  And on a bottom broad and strong  Support the social union long  But uncle uncle much I fear  Some have abus'd the lion's ear  He listens to the leopard's tongue  That cursed leopard leads him wrong  Were he but banish'd far away  You don't attend to what I say  Why really couz the sage rejoin'd  The rain and snow and driving wind  Beat thro' with such prodigious force  It made me deaf to your discourse  Now couz were my advice pursu'd  And sure I mean it for your good  Methinks you should this house repair  Be this your first and chiefest care  Your skill the voice of prudence calls  To stop these crannies in the walls  And prop the roof before it falls  If you this needful task perform  You'll make your mansion dry and warm  And we may then converse together  Secure from this tempestuous weather  CONTENTMENT  By the Same  FArewell aspiring thoughts no more  My soul shall leave the peaceful shore  To sail ambition's main  Fallacious as the harlot's kiss  You promise me uncertain bliss  And give me certain Pain  A beauteous prospect first you shew  Which ere survey'd you paint anew  And paint it wond'rous pleasant  This in a third is quickly lost  Thus future good we covet most  But ne'er enjoy the present  Deluded on from scene to scene  We never end but still begin  By flatt'ring Hope betray'd  I'm weary of the painful chace  Let others run this endless race  To catch a flying shade  Let others boast their useless wealth  Have I not honesty and health  Which riches cannot give  Let others to preserment soar  And changing liberty for pow'r  In golden shackles live  'Tis time at length I should be wise  'Tis time to seek substantial joys  Joys out of Fortune's pow'r  Wealth honours dignities and fame  Are toys the blind capricious dame  Takes from from us ev'ry hour  Come conscious Virtue fill my breast  And bring Content thy daughter dress'd  In eversmiling charms  Let sacred friendship too attend  A friendship worthy of my friend  Such as my LAELIUS warms  With these I'll in my bosom make  A bulwark Fortune cannot shake  Tho' all her storms arise  Look down and pity gilded slaves  Despise ambition's giddy knaves  And wish the Fools were wise  The EDUCATION of  ACHILLES  I  AH me is all our pleasure mix'd with woe  Is there on earth no happiness sincere  Must ev'n this bitter stream of sorrow flow  From joy's domestick spring our children dear  How oft did Thetis drop the silver tear  When with fond eyes she view'd her darling boy  How oft her breast heav'd with presaging fear  Lest vice's secret canker shou'd annoy  Fair virtue's op'ning bud and all her hopes destroy  II  At length so Nereus had her rightly taught  That doubtful cares might eat her heart no more  Her imp in prattling infancy she brought  To the fam'd Centaur on mount Pelion hore  Hight Chiron whom to Saturn Phyl'ra bore  Chiron whose wisdom flourish'd 'bove his peers  In ev'ry goodly thew and virtuous lore  To principle his yet untainted years  The seed that's early sown the fairest harvest bears  III  Far in the covert of a bushy wood  Where aged trees their starproof branches spread  A grott with grey moss ever dropping stood  No costly gems the sparkling roof display'd  Ne crystal squares the pavement rich inlaid  But o'er the pebbles clear with glassy shine  A limpid stream in soothing murmurs stray'd  And all around the flow'ring eglantine  Its balmy tendrils spread in many a wanton twine  IV  A lowly habitation well I ween  Yet sacred made by men of mickle fame  Who there in precepts wise had lesson'd been  Chaste Peleus consort of the seaborn dame  Sage Aesculape who cou'd the vital flame  Blest leach relumine by his healing skill  And Jason who his father's crown to claim  Descended dreadful from the craggy hill  And with his pourtance stern did false usurper thrill  V  Fast by the cave a damsel was ypight  Afraid from earth her blushing looks to rear  Lest aught indecent shou'd offend her sight  Lest aught indecent shou'd offend her ear  Yet wou'd she sometime deign at sober cheer  Softly to smile but ever held it shame  The mirth of foulmouth'd ribaldry to bear  A cautious nymph and MODESTY her name  Ah who but churlish carle would hurt so pure a dame  VI  With her sate TEMPERANCE companion meet  Plucking from treeen bough her simple food  And pointing to an urn beside her feet  Fill'd with the crystal of the wholsome flood  With her was seen of grave and awful mood  Hoary FIDELITY a matron staid  And sweet BENEVOLENCE who smiling stood  Whilst at her breast two fondling infants play'd  And turtles billing soft coo'd thro' the echoing glade  VII  On t'other side of bold and open air  Was a fair personage hight EXERCISE  Reclin'd he seem'd upon his rough boarspear  As late surccas'd from hardy enterprize  For Sloth inglorious did he aye despise  Fresh glow'd his cheek with health's vermilion dye  On his sleek brow the swelling sweatdrops rise  And oft around he darts his glowing eye  To view his wellbreath'd hounds full jolly company  VIII  Not far away was sage EXPERIENCE plac'd  With careknit brow fix'd looks and sober plight  Who weighing well the present with the past  Of every accident cou'd read aright  With him was rev'rend CONTEMPLATION pight  Bowbent with eld his beard of snowy hue  Yet age's hand mote not empare his sight  Still with sharp ken the eagle he'd pursue  As through the buxom air to heav'n's bright bow'rs she flew  IX  Here the fond parent left her darling care  Yet softly breath'd a sigh as she withdrew  Here the young hero ev'n from tender year  Eftsoons imbid'd Instruction's hony'd dew  For well to file his tongue sage Chiron knew  And learnt to discipline his life aright  To pay to pow'rs supreme a reverence due  Chief to Saturnian Jove whose dreaded might  Wings thro' disparted clouds the bik'ring lightning's flight  X  Aye was the stripling wont ere morning fair  Had rear'd o'er eastern waves her rosy tede  To grasp with tender hand the pointed spear  And beat the thicket where the boar's fell breed  Enshrouded lay or lion's tawny seed  Oft wou'd great Dian with her woody train  Stop in mid chace to wonder at his speed  Whilst up the hill's rough side she saw him strain  Or sweep with winged feet along the level plain  XI  And when dun shades had blent the day's bright eye  Upon his shoulders with slow stagg'ring pace  He brought the prey his hand had done to die  Whilst blood with dust besprent did foul disgrace  The goodly features of his glowing face  When as the sage beheld on grassy soil  Each panting corse whilst life did well apace  The panther of his spotted pride he'd spoil  To deck his foster son fit meed of daring toil  XII  And ever and anon the godlike sire  To temper stern behests with pleasaunce gay  Would touch for well he cou'd the silver lyre  So sweetly ravish'd each enchanting lay  That Pan in scornful wise wou'd fling away  His rustick pipe and ev'n the sacred train  Wou'd leave their lov'd Parnass' in trim array  And thought their own Apollo once again  Charm'd his attentive flock a simple shepherd swain  XIII  And ever and anon of worthies old  Whose praise Fame's trump thro' earth's wide bounds had spread  To fire his mind to brave exploits he told  Pirithous known for prowest hardyhead  Theseus whose wrath the dire Procrustes fled  And Hercules whom trembling Lerna fear'd  When Hydra fell in loathsome marshes bred  In vain against the son of Jove uprear'd  Head sprouting under head by thrillant faulchion shear'd  XIV  The sternbrow'd boy in mute attention stood  To hear the sage relate each great emprise  Then strode along the cave in haughtier mood  Whilst varying passions in his bosom rise  And light'ningbeams flash from his glowing eyes  Ev'n now he scorns the prey the desarts yield  Ev'n now as hope the future scene supplies  He shakes the terrors of his heav'nform'd shield  And braves th' indignant flood and thunders o'er the field  An EPISTLE from S J  Esq  in the COUNTRY to the Right Hon the Lord LOVELACE in TOWN  Written in the Year  IN days my Lord when mother Time  Tho' now grown old was in her prime  When SATURN first began to rule  And JOVE was hardly come from school  How happy was a country life  How free from wickedness and strife  Then each man liv'd upon his farm  And thought and did no mortal harm  On mossy banks fair virgins slept  As harmless as the flocks they kept  Then love was all they had to do  And nymphs were chaste and swains were true  But now whatever poets write  'Tis sure the case is alter'd quite  Virtue no more in rural plains  Or innocence or peace remains  But vice is in the cottage found  And country girls are oft unsound  Fierce party rage each village fires  With wars of justices and 'squires  Attorneys for a barley straw  Whole ages hamper folks in law  And ev'ry neighbour's in a flame  About their rates or tythes or game  Some quarrel for their hares and pigeons  And some for diff'rence in religions  Some hold their parson the best preacher  The tinker some a better teacher  These to the Church they fight for strangers  Have faith in nothing but her dangers  While those a more believing people  Can swallow all thingsbut a steeple  But I my Lord who as you know  Care little how these matters go  And equally detest the strife  And usual joys of country life  Have by good fortune little share  Of its diversions or its care  For seldom I with 'squires unite  Who hunt all day and drink all night  Nor reckon wonderful inviting  A quartersessions or cockfighting  But then no farm I occupy  With sheep to rot and cows to dye  Nor rage I much or much despair  Tho' in my hedge I find a snare  Nor view I with due admiration  All the high honours here in fashion  The great commissions of the quorum  Terrors to all who come before 'em  Militia scarlet edg'd with gold  Or the white staff highsheriffs hold  The representative's caressing  The judge's bow the bishop's blessing  Nor can I for my soul delight  In the dull feast of neighb'ring knight  Who if you send three days before  In white gloves meets you at the door  With superfluity of breeding  First makes you sick and then with feeding  Or if with ceremony cloy'd  You wou'd next time such plagues avoid  And visit without previous notice  JOHN JOHN a coachI can't think who 'tis  My lady cries who spies your coach  Ere you the avenue approach  Lord how unluckyWashingday  And all the men are in the hay  Entrance to gain is something hard  The dogs all bark the gates are barr'd  The yard's with lines of linnen cross'd  The halldoor's lock'd the key is lost  These difficulties all o'ercome  We reach at length the drawingroom  Then there's such trampling overhead  Madam you'd swear was brought to bed  Miss in a hurry bursts her lock  To get clean sleeves to hide her smock  The servants run the pewter clatters  My lady dresses calls and chatters  The cookmaid raves for want of butter  Pigs squeak fowls scream and green geese flutter  Now after three hours tedious waiting  On all our neighbours faults debating  And having nine times view'd the garden  In which there's nothing worth a farthing  In comes my lady and the pudden  You will excuse siron a sudden  Then that we may have four and four  The bacon fowls and collyflow'r  Their ancient unity divide  The top one graces one each side  And by and by the second course  Comes lagging like a distanc'd horse  A salver then to church and king  The butler sweats the glasses ring  The cloth remov'd the toasts go round  Bawdy and politicks abound  And as the knight more tipsy waxes  We damn all ministers and taxes  At last the ruddy sun quite sunk  The coachman tolerably drunk  Whirling o'er hillocks ruts and stones  Enough to dislocate one's bones  We home return a wond'rous token  Of heaven's kind care with limbs unbroken  Afflict us not ye Gods tho' sinners  With many days like this or dinners  But if civilities thus teaze me  Nor business nor diversions please me  You'll ask my Lord how time I spend  I answer with a book or friend  The circulating hours dividing  'Twixt reading walking eating riding  But books are still my highest joy  These earliest please and latest cloy  Sometimes o'er distant climes I stray  By guides experienc'd taught the way  The wonders of each region view  From frozen LAPLAND to PERU  Bound o'er rough seas and mountains bare  Yet ne'er forsake my elbow chair  Sometimes some fam'd historian's pen  Recals past ages back agen  Where all I see through every page  Is but how men with senseless rage  Each other rob destroy and burn  To serve a priest's or statesman's turn  Tho' loaded with a diff'rent aim  Yet always asses much the same  Sometimes I view with much delight  Divines their holy gamecocks fight  Here faith and works at variance set  Strive hard who shall the vict'ry get  Presbytery and episcopacy  There fight so long it would amaze ye  Here freewill holds a fierce dispute  With reprobation absolute  There sense kicks transubstantiation  And reason pecks at revelation  With learned NEWTON now I fly  O'er all the rolling orbs on high  Visit new worlds and for a minute  This old one scorn and all that's in it  And now with labouring BOYLE I trace  Nature through ev'ry winding maze  The latent qualities admire  Of vapours water air and fire  With pleasing admiration see  Matter's surprising subtlety  As how the smallest lamp displays  For miles around its scatter'd rays  Or how the case still more t' explain  See Boyle's Experiments  A fart that weighs not half a grain  The atmosphere will oft perfume  Of a whole spacious drawingroom  Sometimes I pass a whole long day  In happy indolence away  In fondly meditating o'er  Past pleasures and in hoping more  Or wander through the fields and woods  And gardens bath'd in circling floods  There blooming flow'rs with rapture view  And sparkling gems of morning dew  Whence in my mind ideas rise  Of CAELIA's cheeks and CHLOE's eyes  'Tis thus my Lord I free from strife  Spend an inglorious country life  These are the joys I still pursue  When absent from the town and you  Thus pass long summer suns away  Busily idle calmly gay  Nor great nor mean nor rich nor poor  Not having much or wishing more  Except that you when weary grown  Of all the follies of the town  And seeing in all publick places  The same vain fops and painted faces  Wou'd sometimes kindly condescend  To visit a dull country friend  Here you'll be ever sure to meet  A hearty welcome tho' no treat  One who has nothing else to do  But to divert himself and you  A house where quiet guards the door  No rural wits smoak drink and roar  Choice books safe horses wholesome liquor  Clean girls backgammon and the vicar  To a LADY in Town soon after her leaving the Country  By the Same  WHilst you dear maid o'er thousands born to reign  For the gay town exchange the rural plain  The cooling breeze and ev'ning walk forsake  For stifling crouds which your own beauties make  Thro' circling joys while you incessant stray  Charm in the mall and sparkle at the play  Think if successive vanities can spare  One thought to love what cruel pangs I bear  Left in these plains all wretched and alone  To weep with fountains and with echos groan  And mourn incessantly that fatal day  That all my bliss with CHLOE snatch'd away  Say by what arts I can relieve my pain  Musick verse all I try but try in vain  In vain the breathing flute my hand employs  Late the companion of my CHLOE's voice  Nor HANDEL's nor CORELLI's tuneful airs  Can harmonize my soul or sooth my cares  Those oncelov'd med'cines unsuccessful prove  Musick alas is but the voice of love  In vain I oft harmonious lines peruse  And seek for aid from POPE's and PRIOR's muse  Their treach'rous numbers but assist the foe  And call forth scenes of sympathising woe  Here HELOISE mourns her absent lover's charms  There panting EMMA sighs in HENRY's arms  Their loves like mine illfated I bemoan  And in their tender sorrows read my own  Restless sometimes as oft the mournful dove  Forsakes her nest forsaken by her love  I fly from home and seek the sacred fields  Where CAM's old urn its silver current yields  Where solemn tow'rs o'erlook each mossy grove  As if to guard it from th' assaults of love  Yet guard in vain for there my CHLOE's eyes  But lately made whole colleges her prize  Her sons tho' few not PALLAS cou'd defend  Nor DULLNESS succour to her thousands lend  Love like a fever with infectious rage  Scorch'd up the young and thaw'd the frost of age  To gaze at her ev'n DONS were seen to run  And leave unfinish'd pipes and authorsscarce begun  So HELEN look'd and mov'd with such a grace  When the grave seniors of the TROJAN race  Were forc'd those fatal beauties to admire  That all their youth consum'd and set their town on fire  At fam'd NEWMARKET oft I spend the day  An unconcern'd spectator of the play  There pitiless observe the ruin'd heir  With anger fir'd or melting with despair  For how shou'd I his trivial loss bemoan  Who feel one so much greater of my own  There while the golden heaps a glorious prize  Wait the decision of two rival dice  Whilst long disputes 'twixt  seven  and  five  remain  And each like parties have their friends for gain  Without one wish I see the guineas shine  Fate keep your gold I cry make CHLOE mine  Now see prepar'd their utmost speed to try  O'er the smooth turf the bounding racers fly  Now more and more their slender limbs they strain  And foaming stretch along the velvet plain  Ah stay swift steeds your rapid flight delay  No more the jockey's smarting lash obey  But rather let my hand direct the rein  And guide your steps a nobler prize to gain  Then swift as eagles cut the yielding air  Bear me oh bear me to the absent fair  Now when the winds are hush'd the air serene  And chearful sunbeams gild the beauteous scene  Pensive o'er all the neighb'ring fields I stray  Wheree'er or choice or chance directs the way  Or view the op'ning lawns or private woods  Or distant bluish hills or silver floods  Now harmless birds in silken nets insnare  Now with swift dogs pursue the flying hare  Dull sports for oh my CHLOE is not there  Fatigued at length I willingly retire  To a small study and a chearful fire  There o'er some folio pore I pore 'tis true  But oh my thoughts are fled and fled to you  I hear you see you feast upon your eyes  And clasp with eager arms the lovely prize  Here for a while I cou'd forget my pain  Whilst I by dear reflection live again  But ev'n these joys are too sublime to last  And quickly fade like all the real ones past  For just when now beneath some silent grove  I hear you talkand talk perhaps of love  Or charm with thrilling notes the list'ning ear  Sweeter than angels sing or angels hear  My treach'rous hand its weighty charge lets go  The book falls thund'ring on the floor below  The pleasing vision in a moment's gone  And I once more am wretched and alone  So when glad ORPHEUS from th' infernal shade  Had just recall'd his long lamented maid  Soon as her charms had reach'd his eager eyes  Lost in eternal nightagain she dies  To the Right Hon the Lady MARGARET CAVENDISH HARLEY presented with a Collection of POEMS  By the Same  THE tuneful throng was ever beauty's care  And verse a tribute sacred to the fair  Hence in each age the loveliest nymph has been  By undisputed right the muses queen  Her smiles have all poetick bosoms fir'd  And patronis'd the verse themselves inspir'd  LESBIA presided thus in Roman times  Thus SACHARISSA reign'd o'er British rhymes  And present bards to MARGARETTA bow  For what they were of old is HARLEY now  From OXFORD's house in these dull busy days  Alone we hope for patronage or praise  He to our slighted labours still is kind  Beneath his roof w'are ever sure to find  Reward sufficient for the world's neglect  Charms to inspire and goodness to protect  Your eyes with rapture animate our lays  Your sire's kind hand uprears our drooping bays  Form'd for our glory and support ye seem  Our constant patron he and you our theme  Where shou'd poetick homage then be pay'd  Where ev'ry verse but at your feet be lay'd  A double right you to this empire bear  As first in beauty and as OXFORD's heir  Illustrious maid in whose sole person join'd  Ev'ry perfection of the fair we find  Charms that might warrant all her sex's pride  Without one foible of her sex to hide  Good nature artless as the bloom that dies  Her cheeks and wit as piercing as her eyes  Oh HARLEY cou'd but you these lines approve  These children sprung from idleness and love  Cou'd they but ah how vain is the design  Hope to amuse your hours as once they've mine  Th' ill judging world's applause and criticks' blame  Alike I'd scorn your approbation's fame  CHLOE to STREPHON A SONG  By the Same  TOO plain dear youth these telltale eyes  My heart your own declare  But for heav'n's sake let it suffice  You reign triumphant there  Forbear your utmost pow'r to try  Nor farther urge your sway  Press not for what I must deny  For fear I shou'd obey  Cou'd all your arts successful prove  Wou'd you a maid undo  Whose greatest failing is her love  And that her love for you  Say wou'd you use that very pow'r  You from her fondness claim  To ruin in one fatal hour  A life of spotless fame  Ah cease my dear to do an ill  Because perhaps you may  But rather try your utmost skill  To save me than betray  Be you yourself my virtue's guard  Defend and not pursue  Since 'tis a task for me too hard  To fight with love and you  To the Right Honourable the EARL of  CHESTERFIELD  on his being install'd Knight of the GARTER  By the Same  THese trophies STANHOPE of a lovely dame  Once the bright object of a monarch's flame  Who with such just propriety can wear  As thou the darling of the gay and fair  See ev'ry friend to wit politeness love  With one consent thy sovereign's choice approve  And liv'd PLANTAGENET her voice to join  Herself and GARTER both were surely thine  To A LADY Sent with a Present of Shells and Stones design'd for a GROTTO  By the Same  WIth gifts like these the spoils of neighb'ring shores  The Indian swain his sable love adores  Off'rings well suited to the dusky shrine  Of his rude goddess but unworthy mine  And yet they seem not such a worthless prize  If nicely view'd by philosophick eyes  And such are yours that nature's works admire  With warmth like that which they themselves inspire  To such how fair appears each grain of sand  Or humblest weed as wrought by nature's hand  How far superior to all human pow'r  Springs the green blade or buds the painted flow'r  In all her births tho' of the meanest kinds  A just observer entertainment finds  With fond delight her low productions sees  And how she gently rises by degrees  A shell or stone he can with pleasure view  Hence trace her noblest works the heav'nsand you  Behold how bright these gaudy trifles shine  The lovely sportings of a hand divine  See with what art each curious shell is made  Here carv'd in fretwork there with pearl inlaid  What vivid streaks th' enamell'd stones adorn  Fair as the paintings of the purple morn  Yet still not half their charms can reach our eyes  While thus confus'd the sparkling Chaos lies  Doubly they'll please when in your Grotto plac'd  They plainly speak the fair disposer's taste  Then glories yet unseen shall o'er them rise  New order from your hand new lustre from your eyes  How sweet how charming will appear this Grot  When by your art to full perfection brought  Here verdant plants and blooming flow'rs will grow  There bubbling currents through the shellwork flow  Here coral mix'd with shells of various dies  There polish'd stone will charm our wand'ring eyes  Delightful bow'r of bliss secure retreat  Fit for the Muses and STATIRA's seat  But still how good must be that fairone's mind  Who thus in solitude can pleasure find  The muse her company goodsense her guide  Resistless charms her pow'r but not her pride  Who thus forsakes the town the park and play  In silent shades to pass her hours away  Who better likes to breathe fresh country air  Than ride imprison'd in a velvet chair  And makes the warbling nightingale her choice  Before the thrills of FARINELLI's voice  Prefers her books and conscience void of ill  To consorts balls assemblies and quadrille  Sweet bow'rs more pleas'd than gilded chariots sees  For groves the playhouse quits and beaus for trees  Blest is the man whom heav'n shall grant one hour  With such a lovely nymph in such a lovely bow'r  To A LADY In answer to a LETTER wrote in a very fine Hand  By the Same  WHilst wellwrote lines our wond'ring eyes command  The beauteous work of CHLOE's artful hand  Throughout the finish'd piece we see display'd  Th' exactest image of the lovely maid  Such is her wit and such her form divine  This pure as flows the style thro' ev'ry line  That like each letter exquisitely fine  See with what art the sable currents stain  In wand'ring mazes all the milkwhite plain  Thus o'er the meadows wrap'd in silver snow  Unfrozen brooks in dark meanders flow  Thus jetty curls in shining ringlets deck  The ivory plain of lovely CHLOE's neck  See like some virgin whose unmeaning charms  Receive new lustre from a lover's arms  The yielding paper's pure but vacant breast  By her fair hand and flowing pen impress'd  At ev'ry touch more animated grows  And with new life and new ideas glows  Fresh beauties from the kind defiler gains  And shines each moment brighter from its stains  Let mighty Love no longer boast his darts  That strike unerring aim'd at mortal hearts  CHLOE your quill can equal wonders do  Wound full as sure and at a distance too  Arm'd with your feather'd weapons in your hands  From pole to pole you send your great commands  To distant climes in vain the lover flies  Your pen o'ertakes him if he 'scapes your eyes  So those who from the sword in battle run  But perish victims to the distant gun  Beauty's a shortliv'd blaze a fading flow'r  But these are charms no ages can devour  These far superior to the brightest face  Triumph alike o'er time as well as space  When that fair form which thousands now adore  By years decay'd shall tyrannize no more  These lovely lines shall future ages view  And eyes unborn like ours be charm'd by you  How oft do I admire with fond delight  The curious piece and wish like you to write  Alas vain hope that might as well aspire  To copy PAULO's stroke or TITIAN's fire  Ev'n now your splendid lines before me lie  And I in vain to imitate them try  Believe me fair I'm practising this art  To steal your hand in hopes to steal your heart  The ART of DANCING A POEM  Inscrib'd to the Rt Hon the Lady FANNY FIELDING  Written in the Year  By the Same  Incessu patuit Dea  VIRG  CANTO I  IN the smooth dance to move with graceful mien  Easy with care and sprightly tho' serene  To mark th' instructions echoing strains convey  And with just steps each tuneful note obey  I teach be present all ye sacred Choir  Blow the soft flute and strike the sounding lyre  When FIELDING bids your kind assistance bring  And at her feet the lowly tribute fling  Oh may her eyes to her this verse is due  What first themselves inspir'd vouchsafe to view  Hail loveliest art that can'st all hearts insnare  And make the fairest still appear more fair  Beauty can little execution do  Unless she borrows half her arms from you  Few like PYGMALION doat on lifeless charms  Or care to clasp a statue in their arms  But breasts of flint must melt with fierce desire  When art and motion wake the sleeping fire  A Venus drawn by great Apelles' hand  May for a while our wond'ring eyes command  But still tho' form'd with all the pow'rs of art  The lifeless piece can never warm the heart  So a fair nymph perhaps may please the eye  Whilst all her beauteous limbs unactive lie  But when her charms are in the dance display'd  Then ev'ry heart adores the lovely maid  This sets her beauty in the fairest light  And shews each grace in full perfection bright  Then as she turns around from ev'ry part  Like porcupines she sends a piercing dart  In vain alas the fond spectator tries  To shun the pleasing dangers of her eyes  For Parthianlike she wounds as sure behind  With flowing curls and ivory neck reclin'd  Whether her steps the Minuet's mazes trace  Or the slow Louvre's more majestick pace  Whether the Rigadoon employs her care  Or sprightly Jigg displays the nimble fair  At every step new beauties we explore  And worship now what we admir'd before  So when Aeneas in the Tyrian grove  Fair Venus met the charming queen of Love  The beauteous Goddess whilst unmov'd she stood  Seem'd some fair nymph the guardian of the wood  But when she mov'd at once her heav'nly mien  And graceful step confess bright Beauty's queen  New glories o'er her form each moment rise  And all the Goddess opens to his eyes  Now haste my Muse pursue thy destin'd way  What dresses best become the dancer say  The rules of dress forget not to impart  A lesson previous to the dancing art  The soldier's scarlet glowing from afar  Shews that his bloody occupation's war  Whilst the lawn band beneath a double chin  As plainly speaks divinity within  The milkmaid safe thro' driving rains and snows  Wrapp'd in her cloak and prop'd on pattens goes  While the soft Belle immur'd in velvet chair  Needs but the silken shoe and trusts her bosom bare  The woolly drab and English broadcloth warm  Guard well the horseman from the beating storm  But load the dancer with too great a weight  And call from ev'ry pore the dewy sweat  Rather let him his active limbs display  In camblet thin or glossy paduasoy  Let no unwieldy pride his shoulders press  But airy light and easy be his dress  Thin be his yielding soal and low his heel  So shall he nimbly bound and safely wheel  But let not precepts known my verse prolong  Precepts which use will better teach than song  For why should I the gallant spark command  With clean white gloves to fit his ready hand  Or in his fobb enlivening spirits wear  And pungent salts to raise the fainting fair  Or hint the sword that dangles at his side  Should from its silken bondage be unty'd  Why should my lays the youthful tribe advise  Lest snowy clouds from out their wigs arise  So shall their partners mourn their laces spoil'd  And shining silks with greasy powder soil'd  Nor need I sure bid prudent youths beware  Lest with erected tongues their buckles stare  The pointed steel shall oft their stocking rend  And oft th' approaching petticoat offend  And now ye youthful fair I sing to you  With pleasing smiles my useful labours view  For you the silkworms finewrought webs display  And lab'ring spin their little lives away  For you bright gems with radiant colours glow  Fair as the dies that paint the heav'nly bow  For you the sea resigns its pearly store  And earth unlocks her mines of treasur'd ore  In vain yet Nature thus her gifts bestows  Unless yourselves with art those gifts dispose  Yet think not Nymphs that in the glitt'ring ball  One form of dress prescrib'd can suit with all  One brightest shines when wealth and art combine  To make the finish'd piece compleatly fine  When least adorn'd another steals our hearts  And rich in native beauties wants not arts  In some are such resistless graces found  That in all dresses they are sure to wound  Their perfect forms all foreign aids despise  And gems but borrow lustre from their eyes  Let the fair Nymph in whose plump cheeks is seen  A constant blush be clad in chearful green  In such a dress the sportive seanymphs go  So in their grassy bed fresh roses blow  The lass whose skin is like the hazle brown  With brighter yellow should o'ercome her own  While maids grown pale with sickness or despair  The sable's mournful dye should chuse to wear  So the pale moon still shines with purest light  Cloath'd in the dusky mantle of the night  But far from you be all those treach'rous arts  That wound with painted charms unwary hearts  Dancing's a touchstone that true beauty tries  Nor suffers charms that nature's hand denies  Tho' for a while we may with wonder view  The rosy blush and skin of lovely hue  Yet soon the dance will cause the cheeks to glow  And melt the waxen lips and neck of snow  So shine the fields in icy fetters bound  Whilst frozen gems bespangle all the ground  Thro' the clear crystal of the glitt'ring snow  With scarlet dye the blushing hawthorns glow  O'er all the plains unnumber'd glories rise  And a new bright creation charms our eyes  Till Zephyr breathes then all at once decay  The splendid scenes their glories fade away  The fields resign the beauties not their own  And all their snowy charms run trickling down  Dare I in such momentous points advise  I should condemn the hoop's enormous size  Of ills I speak by long experience found  Oft' have I trod th' immeasurable round  And mourn'd my shins bruis'd black with many a wound  Nor shou'd the tighten'd stays too straitly lac'd  In whalebone bondage gall the slender waist  Nor waving lappets shou'd the dancing fair  Nor ruffles edg'd with dangling fringes wear  Oft will the cobweb ornaments catch hold  On the approaching button rough with gold  Nor force nor art can then the bonds divide  When once th' intangled Gordian knot is ty'd  So the unhappy pair by Hymen's pow'r  Together join'd in some illfated hour  The more they strive their freedom to regain  The faster binds th' indissoluble chain  Let each fair maid who fears to be disgrac'd  Ever be sure to tye her garters fast  Lest the loos'd string amidst the publick ball  A wish'd for prize to some proud fop should fall  Who the rich treasure shall triumphant shew  And with warm blushes cause her cheeks to glow  But yet as fortune by the selfsame ways  She humbles many some delights to raise  It happen'd once a fair illustrious dame  By such neglect acquir'd immortal fame  And hence the radiant Star and Garter blue  BRITANNIA's nobles grace if Fame says true  Hence still PLANTAGENET thy beauties bloom  Tho' long since moulder'd in the dusky tomb  Still thy lost Garter is thy sov'reign's care  And what each royal breast is proud to wear  But let me now my lovely charge remind  Lest they forgetful leave their fans behind  Lay not ye fair the pretty toy aside  A toy at once display'd for use and pride  A wond'rous engine that by magick charms  Cools your own breasts and ev'ry other's warms  What daring bard shall e'er attempt to tell  The pow'rs that in this little weapon dwell  What verse can e'er explain it's various parts  Its num'rous uses motions charms and arts  Its painted folds that oft extended wide  Th' afflicted fair one's blubber'd beauties hide  When secret sorrows her sad bosom fill  If STREPHON is unkind or SHOCK is ill  Its sticks on which her eyes dejected pore  And pointing fingers number o'er and o'er  When the kind virgin burns with secret shame  Dies to consent yet fears to own her flame  Its shake triumphant its victorious clap  Its angry flutter and its wanton tap  Forbear my muse th' extensive theme to sing  Nor trust in such a flight thy tender wing  Rather do you in humble lines proclaim  From whence this engine took its form and name  Say from what cause it first deriv'd its birth  How form'd in heav'n how thence deduc'd to earth  Once in Arcadia that fam'd seat of love  There liv'd a nymph the pride of all the grove  A lovely nymph adorn'd with ev'ry grace  An easy shape and sweetlyblooming face  FANNY the damsel's name as chaste as fair  Each virgin's envy and each swain's despair  To charm her ear the rival shepherds sing  Blow the soft flute and wake the trembling string  For her they leave their wand'ring flocks to rove  Whilst FANNY's name resounds thro' ev'ry grove  And spreads on ev'ry tree inclos'd in knots of love  As FIELDING's now her eyes all hearts inflame  Like her in beauty as alike in name  'Twas when the summer sun now mounted high  With fiercer beams had scorch'd the glowing sky  Beneath the covert of a cooling shade  To shun the heat this lovely nymph was lay'd  The sultry weather o'er her cheeks had spread  A blush that added to their native red  And her fair breast as polish'd marble white  Was half conceal'd and half expos'd to sight  AEOLUS the mighty God whom winds obey  Observ'd the beauteous maid as thus she lay  O'er all her charms he gaz'd with fond delight  And suck'd in poison at the dang'rous sight  He sighs he burns at last declares his pain  But still he sighs and still he wooes in vain  The cruel nymph regardless of his moan  Minds not his flame uneasy with her own  But still complains that he who rul'd the air  Wou'd not command one Zephyr to repair  Around her face nor gentle breeze to play  Thro' the dark glade to cool the sultry day  By love incited and the hopes of joy  Th' ingenious God contriv'd this pretty toy  With gales incessant to relieve her flame  And call'd it FAN from lovely FANNY's name  CANTO II  NOW see prepar'd to lead the sprightly dance  The lovely nymphs and well dress'd youths advance  The spacious room receives its jovial guest  And the floor shakes with pleasing weight oppress'd  Thick rang'd on ev'ry side with various dyes  The fair in glossy silks our sight surprize  So in a garden bath'd with genial show'rs  A thousand sorts of variegated flow'rs  Jonquills carnations pinks and tulips rise  And in a gay confusion charm our eyes  High o'er their heads with num'rous candles bright  Large sconces shed their sparkling beams of light  Their sparkling beams that still more brightly glow  Reflected back from gems and eyes below  Unnumber'd fans to cool the crouded fair  With breathing ZEPHYRS move the circling air  The sprightly fiddle and the sounding lyre  Each youthful breast with gen'rous warmth inspire  Fraught with all joys the blissful moments fly  Whilst musick melts the ear and beauty charms the eye  Now let the youth to whose superior place  It first belongs the splendid ball to grace  With humble bow and ready hand prepare  Forth from the croud to lead his chosen fair  The fair shall not his kind request deny  But to the pleasing toil with equal ardour fly  But stay rash pair nor yet untaught advance  First hear the muse ere you attempt to dance  Arte citae veloque rates remoque moventur  Arte leves currus  OVID  By art directed o'er the foaming tide  Secure from rocks the painted vessels glide  By art the chariot scours the dusty plain  Springs at the whip and  Nec audit currus habenas  VIRG  hears the strait'ning rein  To art our bodies must obedient prove  If e'er we hope with graceful ease to move  Long was the dancing art unfix'd and free  Hence lost in error and uncertainty  No precepts did it mind or rules obey  But ev'ry master taught a diff'rent way  Hence ere each newborn dance was fully try'd  The lovely product ev'n in blooming dy'd  Thro' various hands in wild confusion toss'd  Its steps were alter'd and its beauties lost  Till  Fuillet wrote the Art of Dancing by characters in French since translated by Weaver  FUILLET the pride of GALLIA rose  And did the dance in characters compose  Each lovely grace by certain marks he taught  And ev'ry step in lasting volumes wrote  Hence o'er the world this pleasing art shall spread  And ev'ry dance in ev'ry clime be read  By distant masters shall each step be seen  Tho' mountains rise and oceans roar between  Hence with her sister arts shall Dancing claim  An equal right to universal fame  And ISAAC's rigadoon shall live as long  As RAPHAEL's painting or as VIRGIL's song  Wise Nature ever with a prudent hand  Dispenses various gifts to ev'ry land  To ev'ry nation frugally imparts  A genius fit for some peculiar arts  To trade the DUTCH incline the SWISS to arms  Musick and verse are soft ITALIA's charms  BRITANNIA justly glories to have found  Lands unexplor'd and sail'd the globe around  But none will sure presume to rival FRANCE  Whether she forms or executes the dance  To her exalted genius 'tis we owe  The sprightly Rigadoon and Louvre slow  The Borée and Courant unpractis'd long  Th' immortal Minuet and the smooth Bretagne  With all those dances of illustrious fame  French dances  That from their native country take their name  With these let ev'ry ball be first begun  Nor countrydance intrude 'till these are done  Each cautious bard ere he attempts to sing  First gently flutt'ring trys his tender wing  And if he finds that with uncommon fire  The Muses all his raptur'd soul inspire  At once to heav'n he soars in lofty odes  And sings alone of heroes and of gods  But if he trembling fears a flight so high  He then descends to softer elegy  And if in elegy he can't succeed  In past'ral he may tune the oaten reed  So shou'd the dancer ere he tries to move  With care his strength his weight and genius prove  Then if he finds kind nature's gifts impart  Endowments proper for the dancing art  If in himself he feels together join'd  An active body and ambitious mind  In nimble Rigadoons he may advance  Or in the Louvre's slow majestick dance  If these he fears to reach with easy pace  Let him the Minuet's circling mazes trace  Is this too hard this too let him forbear  And to the Countrydance confine his care  Wou'd you in dancing ev'ry fault avoid  To keep true time be your first thoughts employ'd  All other errors they in vain shall mend  Who in this one important point offend  For this when now united hand in hand  Eager to start the youthful couple stand  Let them a while their nimble feet restrain  And with soft taps beat time to ev'ry strain  So for the race prepar'd two coursers stand  And with impatient pawings spurn the sand  In vain a master shall employ his care  Where nature once has fix'd a clumsy air  Rather let such to country sports confin'd  Pursue the flying hare or tim'rous hind  Nor yet while I the rural squire despise  A mien effeminate wou'd I advise  With equal scorn I wou'd the fop deride  Nor let him dancebut on the woman's side  And you fair nymphs avoid with equal care  A stupid dullness and a coquet air  Neither with eyes that ever love the ground  Asleep like spinning tops run round and round  Nor yet with giddy looks and wanton pride  Stare all around and skip srom side to side  True dancing like true wit is best express'd  By nature only to advantage dress'd  'Tis not a nimble bound or caper high  Tha  can pretend to please a curious eye  Good judges no such tumblers tricks regard  Or think them beautiful because they're hard  'Tis not enough that ev'ry standerby  No glaring errors in your steps can spy  The dance and musick must so nicely meet  Each note shou'd seem an echo to your feet  A nameless grace must in each movement dwell  Which words can ne'er express or precepts tell  Not to be taught but ever to be seen  In FLAVIA's air and CHLOE's easy mien  'Tis such an air that makes her thousands fall  When FIELDING dances at a birthnight ball  Smooth as CAMILLA she skims o'er the plain  And flys like her thro' crouds of heroes slain  Now when the Minuet oft' repeated o'er  Like all terrestrial joys can please no more  And ev'ry nymph refusing to expand  Her charms declines the circulating hand  Then let the jovial countrydance begin  And the loud fiddles call each straggler in  But ere they come permit me to disclose  How first as legends tell this pastime rose  In ancient times such times are now no more  When Albion's crown illustrious ARTHUR wore  In some fairop'ning glade each summer's night  Where the pale moon diffus'd her silver light  On the soft carpet of a grassy field  The sporting fairies their assemblies held  Some lightly tripping with their pygmy queen  In circling ringlets mark'd the level green  Some with soft notes bade mellow pipes resound  And musick warble thro' the groves around  Oft lonely shepherds by the forest side  Belated peasants oft their revels spy'd  And home returning o'er the nutbrown ale  Their guests diverted with the wond'rous tale  Instructed hence throughout the British isle  And fond to imitate the pleasing toil  Round where the trembling may pole's fix'd on high  And bears its flow'ry honours to the sky  The ruddy maids and sunburn'd swains resort  And practise ev'ry night the lovely sport  On ev'ry side Aeolian artists stand  Whose active elbows swelling winds command  The swelling winds harmonious pipes inspire  And blow in ev'ry breast a gen'rous fire  Thus taught at first the countrydance began  And hence to cities and to courts it ran  Succeeding ages did in time impart  Various improvements to the lovely art  From fields and groves to palaces remov'd  Great ones the pleasing exercise approv'd  Hence the loud fiddle and shrill trumpet's sounds  Are made companions of the dancer's bounds  Hence gems and silks brocades and ribbons join  To make the ball with perfect lustre shine  So rude at first the tragick muse appear'd  Her voice alone by rustick rabble heard  Where twisting trees a cooling arbour made  The pleas'd spectators sate beneath the shade  The homely stage with rushes green was strew'd  And in a cart the stroling actors rode  Till time at length improv'd the great design  And bade the scenes with painted landskips shine  Then art did all the bright machines dispose  And theatres of Parian marble rose  Then mimick thunder shook the canvass sky  And Gods descended from their tow'rs on high  With caution now let ev'ry youth prepare  To chuse a partner from the mingled fair  Vain wou'd be here th' instructing muse's voice  If she pretended to direct his choice  Beauty alone by fancy is express'd  And charms in diff'rent forms each different breast  A snowy skin this am'rous youth admires  Whilst nutbrown cheeks another's bosom fires  Small waists and slender limbs some hearts insnare  While others love the more substantial fair  But let not outward charms your judgments sway  Your reason rather than your eyes obey  And in the dance as in the marriage noose  Rather for merit than for beauty choose  Be her your choice who knows with perfect skill  When she shou'd move and when she shou'd be still  Who uninstructed can perform her share  And kindly half the pleasing burthen bear  Unhappy is that hopeless wretch's fate  Who fetter'd in the matrimonial state  With a poor simple unexperienc'd wife  Is forc'd to lead the tedious dance of life  And such is his with such a partner join'd  A moving puppet but without a mind  Still must his hand be pointing out the way  Yet ne'er can teach so fast as she can stray  Beneath her follies he must ever groan  And ever blush for errors not his own  But now behold united hand in hand  Rang'd on each side the wellpair'd couples stand  Each youthful bosom beating with delight  Waits the brisk signal for the pleasing fight  While lovely eyes that flash unusual rays  And snowy bubbies pull'd above the stays  Quick busy hands and bridling heads declare  The fond impatience of the starting fair  And see the sprightly dance is now begun  Now here now there the giddy maze they run  Now with slow steps they pace the circling ring  Now all confus'd too swift for sight they spring  So in a wheel with rapid fury toss'd  The undistinguish'd spokes are in the motion lost  The dancer here no more requires a guide  To no strict steps his nimble feet are ty'd  The muse's precepts here wou'd useless be  Where all is fancy'd unconsin'd and free  Let him but to the musick's voice attend  By this instructed he can ne'er offend  If to his share it falls the dance to lead  In wellknown paths he may be sure to tread  If others lead let him their motions view  And in their steps the winding maze pursue  In ev'ry Countrydance a serious mind  Turn'd for reflexion can a moral find  In HunttheSquirrel thus the nymph we view  Seeks when we fly but flies when we pursue  Thus in Rounddances where our partners change  And unconfin'd from fair to fair we range  As soon as one from his own consort flies  Another seizes on the lovely prize  A while the fav'rite youth enjoys her charms  Till the next comer steals her from his arms  New ones succeed the last is still her care  How true an emblem of th' inconstant fair  Where can philosophers and sages wise  Who read the curious volumes of the skies  A model more exact than dancing name  Of the creation's universal frame  Where worlds unnumber'd o'er th' aetherial way  In a bright regular confusion stray  Now here now there they whirl along the sky  Now near approach and now far distant fly  Now meet in the same order they begun  And then the great coelestial dance is done  Where can the Mor'list find a juster plan  Of the vain labours and the life of man  A while thro' justling crouds we toil and sweat  And eagerly pursue we know not what  Then when our trifling shortliv'd race is run  Quite tir'd sit down just where we first begun  Tho' to your arms kind fate's indulgent care  Has giv'n a partner exquisitely fair  Let not her charms so much engage your heart  That you neglect the skillful dancer's part  Be not when you the tuneful notes should hear  Still whisp'ring idle prattle in her ear  When you shou'd be employ'd be not at play  Nor for your joys all others steps delay  But when the finish'd dance you once have done  And with applause thro' ev'ry couple run  There rest a while there snatch the fleeting bliss  The tender whisper and the balmy kiss  Each secret wish each softer hope confess  And her moist palm with eager fingers press  With smiles the fair shall hear your warm desires  When musick melts her soul and dancing fires  Thus mix'd with love the pleasing toil pursue  Till the unwelcome morn appears in view  Then when approaching day its beams displays  And the dull candles shine with fainter rays  Then when the sun just rises o'er the deep  And each bright eye is almost set in sleep  With ready hands obsequious youths prepare  Safe to her coach to lead each chosen fair  And guard her from the morn's inclement air  Let a warm hood enwrap her lovely head  And o'er her neck a handkerchief be spread  Around her shoulders let this arm be cast  Whilst that from cold defends her slender waist  With kisses warm her balmy lips shall glow  Unchill'd by nightly damps or wintry snow  While gen'rous whitewine mull'd with ginger warm  Safely protects her inward frame from harm  But ever let my lovely pupils fear  To chill their mantling blood with cold smallbeer  Ah thoughtless fair the tempting draught refuse  When thus forewarn'd by my experienc'd muse  Let the sad consequence your thoughts employ  Nor hazard future pains for present joy  Destruction lurks within the pois'nous dose  A fatal fever or a pimpled nose  Thus through each precept of the dancing art  The muse has play'd the kind instructor's part  Thro' ev'ry maze her pupils she has led  And pointed out the surest paths to tread  No more remains no more the goddess sings  But drops her pinions and unfurls her wings  On downy beds the weary'd dancers lie  And sleep's silk cords tie down each drowsy eye  Delightful dreams their pleasing sports restore  And ev'n in sleep they seem to dance once more  And now the work compleatly finish'd lies  Which the devouring teeth of time defies  Whilst birds in air or fish in streams we find  Or damsels fret with aged partners join'd  As long as nymphs shall with attentive ear  A fiddle rather than a sermon hear  So long the brightest eyes shall oft peruse  These useful lines of my instructive muse  Each belle shall wear them wrote upon her fan  And each bright beau shall read themif he can  THE MODERN

Honourable PHILIP YORKE  Esq  By the Same  Atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater et aequi  HOR  THOU whom nor honours wealth nor youth can spoil  With the least vice of each luxuriant soil  Say YORKE for sure if any thou canst tell  What Virtue is who practise it so well  Say where inhabits this Sultana queen  Prais'd and ador'd by all but rarely seen  By what sure marks her essence can we trace  When each religion faction age and place  Sets up some fancy'd idol of its own  A vain pretender to her sacred throne  In man too oft a welldissembled part  A selfdenying pride in woman's heart  In synods faith and in the fields of fame  Valour usurps her honours and her name  Whoe'er their sense of virtue wou'd express  'Tis still by something they themselves possess  Hence youth goodhumour frugal craft oldage  Warm politicians term it partyrage  True churchmen zeal right orthodox and hence  Fools think it gravity and wits pretence  To constancy alone fond lovers join it  And maids unask'd to chastity confine it  But have we then no law besides our will  No just criterion fix'd to good and ill  As well at noon we may obstruct our sight  Then doubt if such a thing exists as light  For no less plain wou'd nature's law appear  As the meridian sun unchang'd and clear  Wou'd we but search for what we were design'd  And for what end th'Almighty form'd mankind  A rule of life we then shou'd plainly see  For to pursue that end must Virtue be  Then what is that not want of pow'r or fame  Or worlds unnumber'd to applaud his name  But a desire his blessings to diffuse  And fear lest millions shou'd exisstence lose  His goodness only cou'd his pow'r employ  And an eternal warmth to propagate his joy  Hence soul and sense diffus'd thro' ev'ry place  Make happiness as infinite as space  Thousands of suns beyond each other blaze  Orbs roll o'er orbs and glow with mutual rays  Each is a world where form'd with wond'rous art  Unnumber'd species live thro' ev'ry part  In ev'ry tract of ocean earth and skies  Myriads of creatures still successive rise  Scarce buds a leaf or springs the vilest weed  But little flocks upon its verdure feed  No fruit our palate courts or flow'r or smell  But on its fragrant bosom nations dwell  All form'd with proper faculties to share  The daily bounties of their maker's care  The great creator from his heav'nly throne  Pleas'd on the wideexpanded joy looks down  And his eternal law is only this  That all contribute to the general bliss  Nature so plain this primal law displays  Each living creature sees it and obeys  Each form'd for all promotes thro' private care  The publick good and justly tastes its share  All understand their great creator's will  Strive to be happy and in that fulfill  Mankind excepted lord of all beside  But only slave to folly vice and pride  'Tis he that's deaf to this command alone  Delights in other's woe and courts his own  Racks and destroys with tort'ring steel and flame  For lux'ry brutes and man himself for fame  Sets superstition high on virtue's throne  Then thinks his Maker's temper like his own  Hence are his altars stain'd with reeking gore  As if he cou'd atone for crimes by more  Hence whilst offended heav'n he strives in vain  T'appease by fasts and voluntary pain  Ev'n in repenting he provokes again  How easy is our yoke how light our load  Did we not strive to mend the laws of God  For his own sake no duty he can ask  The common welfare is our only task  For this sole end his precepts kind as just  Forbid imtemp'rance murder theft and lust  With ev'ry act injurious to our own  Or others good for such are crimes alone  For this are peace love charity enjoin'd  With all that can secure and bless mankind  Thus is the publick safety Virtue's cause  And happiness the end of all her laws  For such by nature is the human frame  Our duty and our int'rest are the same  But hold crys out some Puritan divine  Whose wellstuff'd cheeks with ease and plenty shine  Is this to fast to mortify refrain  And work salvation out with fear and pain  We own the rigid lessons of their schools  Are widely diff'rent from these easy rules  Virtue with them is only to abstain  From all that nature asks and covet pain  Pleasure and vice are ever near akin  And if we thirst cold water is a sin  Heav'n's path is rough and intricate they say  Yet all are damn'd that trip or miss their way  God is a being cruel and severe  And man a wretch by his command plac'd here  In sunshine for a while to take a turn  Only to dry and make him fit to burn  Mistaken men too piously severe  Thro' craft misleading or misled by fear  How little they God's counsels comprehend  Our universal parent guardian friend  Who forming by degrees to bliss mankind  This globe our sportive nursery assign'd  Where for a while his fond paternal care  Feasts us with ev'ry joy our state can bear  Each sense touch taste and smell dispense delight  Musick our hearing beauty charms our sight  Trees herbs and flow'rs to us their spoils resign  Its pearl the rock presents its gold the mine  Beasts fowl and fish their daily tribute give  Of food and cloaths and die that we may live  Seasons but change new pleasures to produce  And elements contend to serve our use  Love's gentle shafts ambition's tow'ring wings  The pomps of senates churches courts and kings  All that our rev'rence joy or hope create  Are the gay playthings of this infant state  Scarcely an ill to human life belongs  But what our follies cause or mutual wrongs  Or if some stripes from providence we feel  He strikes with pity and but wounds to heal  Kindly perhaps sometimes afflicts us here  To guide our views to a sublimer sphere  In more exalted joys to fix our taste  And wean us from delights that cannot last  Our present good the easy task is made  To earn superior bliss when this shall fade  For soon as e'er these mortal pleasures cloy  His hand shall lead us to sublimer joy  Snatch us from all our little sorrows here  Calm every grief and dry each childish tear  Waft us to regions of eternal peace  Where bliss and virtue grow with like encrease  From strength to strength our souls for ever guide  Thro' wond'rous scenes of being yet untry'd  Where in each stage we shall more perfect grow  And new perfections new delights bestow  Oh would mankind but make these truths their guide  And force the helm from prejudice and pride  Were once these maxims fix'd that God's our friend  Virtue our good and happiness our end  How soon must reason o'er the world prevail  And error fraud and superstition fail  None wou'd hereafter then with groundless fear  Describe th' Almighty cruel and severe  Predestinating some without pretence  To Heav'n and some to Hell for no offence  Inflicting endless pains for transient crimes  And fav'ring sects or nations men or times  To please him none wou'd foolishly forbear  Or food or rest or itch in shirts of hair  Or deem it merit to believe or teach  What reason contradicts or cannot reach  None wou'd fierce zeal for piety mistake  Or malice for whatever tenet's sake  Or think salvation to one sect confin'd  And Heav'n too narrow to contain mankind  No more then nymphs by long neglect grown nice  Wou'd in one female frailty sum up vice  And censure those who nearer to the right  Think virtue is but to dispense delight  No servile tenets wou'd admittance find  Destructive of the rights of human kind  Of power divine hereditary right  And nonresistance to a tyrant's might  For sure that all shou'd thus for one be curs'd  Is but great nature's edict just revers'd  No moralists then righteous to excess  Wou'd show fair Virtue in so black a dress  That they like boys who some feign'd spright array  First from the spectre fly themselves away  No preachers in the terrible delight  But chuse to win by reason not affright  Not conjurers like in fire and brimstone dwell  And draw each moving argument from hell  No more our sage interpreters of laws  Wou'd satten on obscurities and flaws  But rather nobly careful of their trust  Strive to wipe off the longcontracted dust  And be like HARDWICKE guardians of the just  No more applause wou'd on ambition wait  And laying waste the world be counted great  But one goodnatur'd act more praises gain  Than armies overthrown and thousands slain  No more wou'd brutal rage disturb our peace  But envy hatred war and discord cease  Our own and others good each hour employ  And all things smile with universal joy  Virtue with happiness her consort join'd  Wou'd regulate and bless each human mind  And man be what his maker first design'd  The FEMALEDRUM Or the Origin of CARDS A Tale  Address'd to the Honourable Miss CARPENTER  THOU whom to counsel is to praise  With

The gentle balm of indolence  When SLOTH had screen'd with artful night  The soft pavilion of delight  Stern AV'RICE with reproachful frown  Would scatter thorns amongst her down  Thus each by turns

heav'n these tedious suff'rings past  Permit me Ickworth rest and health at last  In that lov'd shade my youth's delightful seat  My early pleasure and my late retreat  Where lavish Nature's fav'rite blessings flow  And all the seasons all their sweets bestow  There might I trifle carelesly away  The milder evening of life's clouded day  From bus'ness and the world's intrusion free  With books with love with beauty and with thee  No farther want no wish yet unpossess'd  Cou'd e'er disturb this unambitious breast  Let those who Fortune's shining gifts implore  Who sue for glory splendor wealth or pow'r  View this unactive state with scornful eyes  And pleasures they can never taste despise  Let them still court that goddess' falser joys  Who while she grants their pray'r their peace destroys  I envy not the foremost of the great  Not Walpole's self directing Europe's fate  Still let him load ambition's thorny shrine  Fame be his portion and contentment mine  But if the gods sinister still deny  To live in Ickworth let me there but die  Thy hand to close my eyes in death's long night  Thy image to attract their latest sight  Then to the grave attend thy poet's hearse  And love his mem'ry as you lov'd his verse  To the Same From HamptonCourt  By the Same  Bono loco res humanae sunt quod nemo nisi vitio suo miser est  SENECA in Epist  WHILST in the fortunes of the gay and great  The glare of courts and luxury of state  All that the meaner covet and deplore  The pomp of wealth and insolence of pow'r  Whilst in these various scenes of gilded life  Of fraud ambition policy and strife  Where every word is dictated by art  And ev'ry face the mask of ev'ry heart  Whilst with such diff'rent objects entertain'd  In all that's really felt and all that's feign'd  I speculate on human joys and woes  Till from my pen the verse spontaneous flows  To whom these artless off'rings should I bring  To whom these undigested numbers sing  But to a friendand to what friend but you  Safe just sincere indulgent kind and true  Disdain not then these trifles to attend  Nor fear to blame nor study to commend  Say where false notions erring I pursue  And with the plausible confound the true  Correct with all the freedom that I write  And guide my darken'd reason with thy light  Thee partial heav'n has bless'd profusely kind  With wit with judgment and a taste refin'd  Thy fancy rich and thy observance true  The last still wakeful and the first still new  Rare blessings and to few divided known  But giv'n united to thyself alone  Instruction are thy words and lively truth  The school of age and the delight of youth  When men their various discontents relate  And tell how wretched this our mortal state  That life is but diversify'd distress  The lot of all and hardly more or less  That kings and villagers have each their share  These pinch'd with mean and those with splendid care  That seeming pleasure is intrinsick woe  And all call'd happiness delusive show  Food only for the snakes in envy's breast  Who often grudges what is ne'er possess'd  Say for thou know'st the follies of mankind  Can'st tell how obstinate perverse and blind  Say are we thus oppress'd by Nature's laws  Or of our miseries ourselves the cause  Sure oft unjustly we impute to fate  A thousand evils which ourselves create  Complain that life affords but little joy  And yet that little foolishly destroy  We check the pleasures that too soon subside  And break the current of too weak a tide  Like Atalanta golden trifles chace  And baulk that swiftness which might win the race  For life has joys adapted to each stage  Love for our youth ambition for our age  But wilful man inverting her decrees  When young would govern and when old would please  Covets the fruits his autumn shou'd bestow  Nor tastes the fragrance whilst the blossoms blow  Then farfled joys in vain he would restore  His appetite unanswer'd by his pow'r  Round beauty's neck he twists his wither'd arms  Receiv'd with loathing to her venal charms  He rakes the ashes when the fire is spent  Nor gains fruition tho' he gains consent  But can we say 'tis Providence's fault  If thus untimely all her gifts are sought  If summercrops which must decay we keep  And in the winter would the harvest reap  When brutes with what they are allow'd content  Listen to nature and pursue her bent  And still their pow'r with their ambition weigh'd  Gain what they can but never force a trade  A thousand joys her happy followers prove  Health plenty rest society and love  To us alone in fatal ign'rance proud  To deviate from her dictates 'tis allow'd  That boasted gift our reason to believe  Or let caprice in reason's garb deceive  To us the noble privilege is given  Of wise refining on the will of heav'n  Our skill we trust but lab'ring still to gain  More than we can lose what we might obtain  Will the wise elephant desert the wood  To imitate the whale and range the flood  Or will the mole her native earth forsake  In wanton madness to explore the lake  Yet man whom still ideal profit sways  Than those less prudent and more blind than these  Will quit his home and vent'rous brave the seas  And when his rashness its desert has found  The fool surviving weeps the fool that's drown'd  Herds range the fields the feather'd kind the grove  Chuse woo caress and with promiscuous love  As taste and nature prompt adhere or rove  They meet with pleasure and with ease they part  For beasts are only coupled by the heart  The body still accompanies the mind  And when this wanders that is unconfin'd  The love that join'd the sated pair once fled  They change their haunts their pasture and their bed  No fourlegg'd ideots drag with mutual pain  The nat'ral cement pass'd an artful chain  Th' effect of passion ceases with the cause  Clogg'd with no afterweight of forms or laws  To no dull rules of custom they submit  Like us they cool but when they cool they quit  Nor find we in the wood the sea or plain  One e'er elected o'er the rest to reign  If any rule 'tis force that gives the law  What brutes are bound in voluntary awe  Do they like us a pageant idol raise  Swoln with false pride and flatter'd by false praise  Do they their equal sometimes less revere  At once detest and serve despise and fear  To strength inferior do they bend the knee  With ears and eyes of others hear and see  Or ever vest a mortal god with pow'r  To do those wrongs they afterwards deplore  These institutions are of man alone  Marriage and monarchy are both our own  Publick oppression and domestick strife  Are ills which we ourselves annex'd to life  God never made a husband king or wife  Boast then oh man thy profitable gain  To folly polish'd civiliz'd to pain  Here would I launch into the various field  Of all the cares our prejudices yield  What multiply'd examples might be told  Of pains they give and joys that they withold  When to credulity tradition preaches  And ign'rance practises what error teaches  Wou'd any feather'd maiden of the wood  Or scaly female of the peopled flood  When lust or hunger call'd its force resist  In abstinence or chastity persist  And cry 'If heav'n's intent was understood  'These tastes were only giv'n to be withstood  Or wou'd they wisely both these gifts improve  And eat when hungry and when am'rous love  Yet superstition in religion's name  With future punishment and present shame  Can fright weak woman from her lover's arms  Who weeps with mutual pain her useless charms  Whilst she poor wretch consum'd in secret fires  With pow'r to seize foregoes what she desires  Till beauty fades and inclination dies  And the fair tree the fruit ungather'd dies  But are these ills the ills which heav'n design'd  Are we unfortunate or are we blind  If in possession of our wishes curs'd  Bath'd in untasted springs we dye with thirst  If we make miseries what were blessings meant  And benefits convert to punishment  When in the spring the wise industrious bees  Collect the various bloom from fragrant trees  Extract the liquid sweet of ev'ry flow'r  And cull the garden to enrich their store  Should any pedant bee of all the hive  From this or that perfume the plund'rers drive  And say that he by inspiration knows  The sacred tempting interdicted rose  By heav'n's command tho' sweetest useless grows  Think you the fool would ever be obey'd  And that the lye would grow into a trade  Ev'n Turks would answer noand yet we see  The vine that rose and Mahomet that bee  To these how many proofs I yet could add  That man's superior sense is being mad  That none refining their true int'rest view  But for the substance still the shade pursue  That oft perverse and prodigal of life  Our pow'r and will at everlasting strife  We waste the present for the future hour  And miserlike by hoarding still are poor  Or foolishly regretful of the past  The good which yet remains neglect to taste  Nor need I any foreign proof to bring  Myself an instance of the truths I sing  Whilst in a court repugnant to my taste  From my lov'd friend these precious hours I waste  Why do I vainly here thy absence mourn  And not anticipate thy wish'd return  Why stay my passage to those happy fields  Where fate in thee my ev'ry pleasure yields  Fortune allows the blessings I refuse  And ev'n this moment were my heart to chuse  For thee I should forsake this joyless croud  And not on paper think but think aloud  With thy lov'd converse sill the shorten'd day  And glad my soulYet here unpleas'd I stay  And by mean sanguine views of int'rest sway'd  By airy hopes to real cares betray'd  Lament a grievance which I might redress  And wish that happiness I might possess  The POET's PRAYER  IF e'er in thy sight I found favour Apollo  Defend me from all the disasters which follow  From the knaves and the fools and the fops of the time  From the drudges in prose and the triflers in rhyme  From the patchwork and toils of the royal sackbibber  Those dead birthday odes and the farces of CIBBER  From servile attendance on men in highplaces  Their worships and honours and lordships and graces  From long dedications to patrons unworthy  Who hear and receive but will do nothing for thee  From being caress'd to be left in the lurch  The tool of a party in state or in church  From dull thinking blockheads as sober as Turks  And petulant bards who repeat their own works  From all the gay things of a drawingroom show  The sight of a Belle and the smell of a Beau  From busy backbiters and tatlers and carpers  And scurvy acquaintance of fidlers and sharpers  From old politicians and coffeehouse lectures  The dreams of a chymist and schemes of projectors  From the fears of a goal and the hopes of a pension  The tricks of a gamester and oaths of an ensign  From shallow freethinkers in taverns disputing  Nor ever confuted nor ever confuting  From the constant good fare of another man's board  My lady's broad hints and the jests of my lord  From hearing old chymists prelecting  de oleo  And reading of Dutch commentators in folio  From waiting like GAY whole years at Whitehall  From the pride of gay wits and the envy of small  From very fine ladies with very fine incomes  Which they finely lay out on fine toys and fine trincums  From the pranks of ridottoes and courtmasquerades  The snares of young jilts and the spight of old maids  From a saucy dull stage and submitting to share  In an empty third night with a beggarly play'r  From CURL and such Printers as wou'd ha' me curs'd  To write second parts let who will write the first  From all pious patriots who would to their best  Put on a new tax and take off an old test  From the faith of informers the fangs of the law  And the great rogues who keep all the lesser in awe  From a poor countrycure that living interment  With a wife and no prospect of any preferment  From scribbling for hire when my credit is sunk  To buy no new coat and to line an old trunk  From 'squires who divert us with jokes at their tables  Of hounds in their kennels and nags in their stables  From the nobles and commons who bound in strict league are  To subscribe for no book yet subscribe to Heidegger  From the cant of fanaticks the jargon of schools  The censures of wisemen and praises of fools  From criticks who never read Latin or Greek  And pedants who boast they read both all the week  From borrowing wit to repay it like BUDGEL  Or lending like POPE to be paid by a cudgel  If ever thou didst or wilt ever befriend me  From these and such evils APOLLO defend me  And let me be rather but honest with nowit  Than a noisy nonsensical halfwitted poet  An EPISTLE to a LADY  WHEN the heart akes with anguish pines with grief  And heav'n and you alike deny relief  When ev'n the flatt'rer hope is no where found  'Tis hard to feel the smart and not lament the wound  Permit me then to sigh one last adieu  Nor scorn a sorrow friendship owes to you  A friendship modesty might well return  A sorrow cruelty itself might mourn  Think how the miser pierc'd with inward pain  Looks down with horror on the troubled main  Or wildly roams along the rocky coast  T' explore his treasures in the tempest lost  Hates his own safety chides the waves that roll'd  Himself ashore but sunk his dearer gold  Like him afflicted pensive and forlorn  I look on life and all its pomp with scorn  You was the sweetener of each busy scene  You gave the joy without the pain within  Pleasure and you were both so near ally'd  That when I lost the one the other dy'd  Pain too has lavish'd all her killing store  Nor can she add nor I can suffer more  In vain I view'd you with as chaste a fire  As angels mingle or as saints admire  By reason prompted passion had no part  A virtuous ardour that refin'd the heart  In vain I sought a friendship free from fault  Where sex and beauty were alike forgot  A friendship by the noblest union join'd  The female softness and the manly mind  Courage to conquer evils or endure  Sweetness to sooth the pain and smiles to cure  Scandal a busy fiend in truth's disguise  Like Fame all cover'd o'er with ears and eyes  Learns the fond tale and spreads it as she flies  Nor spreads alone but alters adds defames  Affects to pity tho' her duty blames  Feigns not to credit all she sees or hears  But hopes the evil only in her fears  Pretends to weigh the fact in even scale  And wish at least that justice may prevail  Insinuates dissembles lyes betrays  Plays the whole hypocrite such various ways  That innocence itself must suffer wrong  And honour bleed the prey of slander's tongue  Such is my fate so grievous my distress  Condemn'd to suffer but deny'd redress  Too fond of joy too sensible of pain  To part with all that's dear and not complain  Too delicate to injure what I love  Or ask the pity fame will ne'er approve  What more remains then but to drop my claim  And by my conduct justify my flame  Burst the dear bands that to my heartstrings join  And sacrifice my peace to purchase thine  As the fond mother who delirious eyes  Her dying babe will scarce believe it dies  But strains it still with transport in her arms  Dwells on its lips and numbers o'er its charms  Pleads that it slumbers and expects in vain  To see the little cherub live again  So my torn heart must all the sorrows prove  That torture constancy or sadden love  Yet fondly follow your dear image still  Fancy I hear you speak I see you smile  Doat on a phantom idolize the name  And wish the shade and substance were the same  Alas how fruitless is the idle pray'r  The joys imagin'd real the despair  Like Adam forc'd his Eden to forego  I lose my only paradise below  And dread the prospect of succeeding woe  GENIUS VIRTUE and REPUTATION A FABLE  From Mons DE LA MOTTE Book V Fable  AS GENIUS VIRTUE REPUTATION  Three worthy friends o'er all the nation  Agreed to roam then pass the seas  And

Fable  A Grove there was by nature made  Of trees that form'd a pleasing shade  Where warbled ever free from care  The wing'd musicians of the air  Here tun'd the Nightingale her throat  The Thrush there thrill'd her piercing note  The Finch Lark Linnet all agree  To join the sylvan harmony  Two amorous Sparrows chose this place  The softest of the feather'd race  The MARS and VENUS of the grove  Less fam'd for singing than for love  The songsters warbled sweet while they  As sweetly bill'd their time away  So closely seated were the two  Together you wou'd think they grew  The twig was slender where they sate  And bent beneath their little weight  But scarcely in their lives was known  To bear the one when one was flown  When hunger call'd they left the wood  Together sought the field for food  When thirsty in the shallow rills  Together dip'd their little bills  When PHOEBUS sitting in the west  And thick'ning shades invite to rest  They homeward bent their mutual flight  Thus pass'd their day thus pass'd their night  The castle where these lovers lay  Was in a hollow oak they say  There side by side all night they kept  Together wak'd together slept  And mixing amorous disport  They made their winterevenings short  Tho' free 'twas left to either's mind  To chuse a mate from all their kind  She only lov'd the loving he  He only lov'd the lovely she  Pure JOY poor mortals seldom find  Her footman SORROW waits behind  And FATE impartial deals to all  The honey'd potion mix'd with gall  This pair on an unhappy day  Too far together chanc'd to stray  Benighted and with snares beset  Our MARS and VENUS in a net  Alas were caughtO change of state  A little cage is now their fate  No more they seek the spacious grove  No more they burn with mutual love  Their passion changes with their life  And soon they fall from love to strife  Their little souls with growing rage  High swell they flutter round the cage  Forget the slender twig where late  Close side by side in love they sate  One perch is now too small to hold  The fiery mate and chirping scold  They peck each other o'er their food  And thirst to drink each other's blood  Two cages must the pair divide  Or death the quarrel will decide  A picture this of human life  The modern husband and the wife  Who e'er in courtship saw a pair  So kind as he as she so fair  The kisses that they gave each other  You'd think had seal'd their lips together  Each vows to each a mutual flame  And dreams 'twill always last the same  But fix them once in HYMEN's chains  And each alternately complains  The honeymoon is scarce declin'd  But all the honey of their mind  Is gone and leaves the sting behind  The scene of love is vanish'd quite  They pout grow peevish scold and fight  Two tables feed each parted guest  Two beds receive the pair to rest  And law alone can end the strife  With separatemaintenance for life  An INSCRIPTION  Quercus loquitur  O YE  WHO by retirement to

philosophick gloom he lay  Beneath his ivy bow'r  With joy I hear the solemn sound  Which midnight echoes waft around  And sighing gales repeat  Fav'rite of PALLAS I attend  And faithful to thy summons bend  At WISDOM's aweful seat  She loves the cool the silent eve  Where no false shews of life deceive  Beneath the lunar ray  Here folly drops each vain disguise  Nor sport her gaily colour'd dyes  As in the beam os day  O PALLAS queen of ev'ry art  That glads the sense and mends the heart  Blest source of purer joys  In every form of beauty bright  That captivates the mental sight  With pleasure and surprize  At thy unspotted shrine I bow  Attend thy modest suppliant's vow  That breathes no wild desires  But taught by thy unerring rules  To shun the fruitless wish of fools  To nobler views aspires  Not FORTUNE's gem AMBITION's plume  Nor CYTHEREA's fading bloom  Be objects of my pray'r  Let AV'RICE VANITY and PRIDE  Those envy'd glitt'ring toys divide  The dull rewards of care  To me thy better gifts impart  Each moral beauty of the heart  By studious thoughts refin'd  For WEALTH the smiles of glad content  For POW'R its amplest best extent  An empire o'er the mind  When FORTUNE drops her gay parade  When PLEASURE's transient roses fade  And wither in the tomb  Unchang'd is thy immortal prize  Thy eververdant laurels rise  In undecaying bloom  By thee protected I defy  The coxcomb's sneer the stupid lye  Of ignorance and spite  Alike contemn the leaden fool  And all the pointed ridicule  Of undiscerning Wit  From envy hurry noise and strife  The dull impertinence

Perfect Fair and Good  Attentive Athens caught the sound  And all her list'ning sons around  In aweful silence stood  Reclaim'd her wild licentious youth  Confess'd the potent voice of TRUTH  And felt its just controul  The passions ceas'd their loud alarms  And Virtue's soft persuasive charms  O'er all their senses stole  Thy breath inspires the POET's song  The PATRIOT's free unbiass'd tongue

direct their flight  Wisdom's thy gift and all her force  From thee deriv'd eternal source  Of intellectual light  O send her sure her steady ray  To regulate my doubtful way  Thro' life's perplexing road  The mists of error to controul  And thro' its gloom direct my soul  To happiness and good  Beneath her clear discerning eye  The visionary shadows fly  Of folly's painted show  She sees thro'

Can'st thou the son of science bred  Where learned Isis flows  Forget that nurs'd in shelt'ring groves  The Grecian genius rose  Within the Plantane's spreading shade  Immortal PLATO taught  And fair LYCEUM form'd the depth  Of ARISTOTLE's thought  To Latian groves reflect thy views  And bless the Tuscan gloom  Where Eloquence deplor'd the fate  Of Liberty and Rome  Retir'd beneath the Beechen shade  From each inspiring bough  The muses wove th' unfading wreathes  That circled VIRGIL's brow  Reflect before the fatal ax  My threaten'd doom has wrought  Nor sacrifice to sensual taste  The nobler growth of thought  Not all the glowing fruits that blush  On India's sunny coast  Can recompense thee for the worth  Of one idea lost  My shade a produce may supply  Unknown to solar fire  And

thousand shapes you wear with ease  And still in every shape you please  Now wrap'd in some mysterious dream  A lone Philosopher you seem  Now quick from hill to vale you fly  And now you sweep the

thus with Life  If I do lose thee I do lose a thing  That none but fools would weep  Shakesp Meas for Meas  OFFSPRING of folly and of noise  Fantastick train of airy joys  Cease cease your vain delusive lore  And tempt my serious thoughts no more  Ye horrid forms ye gloomy throng  Who hear the bird of midnight's song  Thou too DESPAIR pale spectre come  From the selfmurd'rer's haunted tomb  Whilst sad MELPOMENE relates  How we're afflicted by the fates  What's all this wish'd for empire Life  A scene of mis'ry care and strife  And make the most that's all we have  Betwixt the cradle and the grave  The being is not worth the charge  Behold the estimate at large  Our youth is silly idle vain  Our age is full of care and pain  From wealth accrues anxiety  Contempt and want from poverty  What trouble business has in store  How idleness fatigues us more  To reason th' ignorant are blind  The learned's eyes are too refin'd  Each wit deems every wit his foe  Each fool is naturally so  And ev'ry rank and ev'ry station  Meet justly with disapprobation  Say man is this the boasted state  Where all is pleasant all is great  Alas another face you'll see  Take off the veil of vanity  Is aught in pleasure aught in pow'r  Has wisdom any gift in store  To make thee stay a single hour  Tell me ye youthful who approve  Th' intoxicating sweets of love  What endless nameless throbs arise  What heartfelt anguish and what sighs  When jealousy has gnaw'd the root  Whence love's united branches shoot  Or grant that Hymen lights his torch  To lead you to the nuptial porch  Behold the long'dfor rapture o'er  Desire begins to lose it's pow'r  Then cold indifference takes place  Fruition alters quite the case  And what before was extasy  Is scarcely now civility  Your children bring a second care  If childless then you want an heir  So that in both alike you find  The same perplexity of mind  Do pow'r or wealth more comfort own  Behold yon pageant on a throne  Where silken swarms

knowledge give us happiness  In that alas we know there's less  For every pang of mental woe  Springs from the faculty to  know  Hark at that deathbetok'ning knell  Of yonder doleful passingbell  Perhaps a friend a father's dead  Or the lov'd part'ner of thy bed  Perhaps thy only son lies there  Breathless upon the sable bier  Say what can ease the present grief  Can former joys afford relief  Those former joys remember'd still  The more augment the recent ill  And where you seek for comfort gain  Additional increase of pain  What woes from moral ills accure  And what from natural ensue  Disease and casualty attend  Our footsteps to the journey's end  The cold catarrh the gout and stone  The dropsy jaundice joyn'd in one  The raging fever's inward heat  The pale consumption's fatal sweat  And thousand more distempers roam  To drag us to th' eternal home  And when solution sets us free  From prison of mortality  The soul dilated joins in air  To go alas we know not where  And the

"That by th' allaying mixture he  "May not approach to deity  The sovereign spake the gods agree  And each began in his degree  Behind the throne of Jove there stood  Two vessels of celestial wood  Containing just two equal measures  One fill'd with pains and one with pleasures  The Gods drew out from both of these  And mix'd 'em with their essences  Which essences are heav'nly still  When undisturb'd by nat'ral ill  And man to moral good is prone  Let but the moral pow'rs alone  And not pervert 'em by tuition  Or conjure 'em by superstition  Hence man partakes an equal share  Of

propitious deigns to grace  No frowns on his soft forehead lowr  No cries distort his tender face  But o'er her child forgetting all her pangs  Insatiate of her smiles the raptur'd parent hangs  II  Let statesmen on the sleepless bed  The fate of realms and princes weigh  While in the agonizing head  They form ideal scenes of sway  Not long alas the fancied charms delight  But melt like spectreforms in silent shades of night  III  Ye heavy pedants dull of lore  Nod o'er the taper's livid flame  Ye misers still increase your store  Still tremble at the robber's name  Or shudd'ring from the recent dream arise  While visionary fire glows dreadful to your eyes  IV  Far other joys the muses show'r  Benignant on the aching breast  'Tis theirs in the lone chearless hour  To lull the lab'ring heart to rest  With bright'ning calms they glad the prospect drear  And bid each groan subside and dry up ev'ry tear  V  From earthly mists ye gentle nine  Whene'er you purge the visual ray  Sudden the landscapes fairer shine  And blander smiles the face of day  Ev'n Chloe's lips with brighter vermil glow  And on her youthful cheek the rosebuds fresher blow  VI  When Boreas sounds his fierce alarms  And all the greenclad nymphs are fled  Oh then I lie in fancy's arms  On fragrant May's delicious bed  And thro' the shade slowcreeping from the dale  Feel on my drowsy face the lillybreathing gale  VII  Or on the mountain's airy height  Hear Winter call his howling train  Chas'd by the Spring and Dryads light  That now resume their blissful reign  While smiling Flora binds her Zephyr's brows  With ev'ry various flow'r that nature's lap bestows  VIII  More potent than the Sybil's gold  That led Aeneas' bold emprize  When you Calliope unfold  Your laurelbranch each phantom flies  Slow cares with heavy wings beat the dull air  And dread and paleey'd grief and pain and black despair  IX  With you Elysium's happy bow'rs  The mansions of the glorious dead  I visit oft and cull the flow'rs  That rise spontaneous to your tread  Such active virtue warms that pregnant earth  And heav'n with kindlier hand assists each genial birth  X  Here oft I wander thro' the gloom  While pendent fruit the leaves among  Gleams thro' the shade with golden bloom  Where lurk along the feather'd throng  Whose notes th'eternal spring unceasing chear  Nor leave in mournful silence half the drooping year  XI  And oft I view along the plain  With slow and solemn steps proceed  Heroes and chiefs an awful train  And high exalt the laurell'd head  Submiss I honour ev'ry sacred name  Deep in the column grav'd of adamantine fame  XII  But cease my muse with tender wing  Unfledg'd ethereal flight to dare  Stern Cato's bold discourse to sing  Or paint immortal Brutus' air  May Britain ne'er the weight of slav'ry feel  Or bid a Brutus shake for her his crimson steel  XIII  Lo yonder negligently laid  Fast by the stream's impurpled side  Where thro' the thickentangled shade  The radiant waves of nectar glide  Each sacred poet strikes his tuneful lyre  And wafts the ravish'd heart and bids the soul aspire  XIV  No more is hear'd the plaintive strain  Or pleasing melancholy's song  Tibullus here forgets his pain  And joins the loveexulting throng  For Cupid flutters round with golden dart  And fiercely twangs his bow at ev'ry rebel heart  XV  There stretch'd at ease Anacreon gay  And on his melting Lesbia's breast  With eye halfrais'd Catullus lay  And gaz'd himself to balmy rest  While Venus' self thro' all the am'rous groves  With kisses freshdistill'd supply'd their constant loves  XVI  Now Horace' hand the string inspir'd  My soul impatient as he sung  The muse unconquerable fir'd  And heav'nly accents seiz'd my tongue  Then lock'd in admiration sweet I bow'd  Confess'd his potent art nor could forbear aloud  Milton  XVII  Hail glorious bard whose high command  A thousand various strings obey  While joins and mixes to thy hand  At once the bold and tender lay  Not mighty Homer down Parnassus' steep  Rolls the full tide of verse so clear and yet so deep  XVIII  O could I catch one ray divine  From thy intolerable blaze  To pour strong lustre on my line  And my aspiring song to raise  Then should the muse her choicest influence shed  And with eternal wreaths entwine my lofty head  XIX  Then would I sing the sons of Fame  Th'immortal chiefs of ancient age  Or tell of love's celestial flame  Or ope fair friendship's sacred page  And leave the sullen thought and struggling groan  To take their watchful stands around the gaudy throne  The POWER of POETRY  I  WHen tuneful Orpheus strove by moving strains  To sooth the furious hate of rugged swains  The list'ning multitude was pleas'd  Ev'n rapine drop'd her ravish'd prey  Till by the soft oppression seiz'd  Each savage hear'd his rage away  And now o'ercome in kind consent they move  And all is harmony and all is love  II  Not so when Greece's chief by heav'n inspir'd  With love of arms each glowing bosom fir'd  But now the trembling soldier flew  Regardless of the glorious prize  And his brave thirst of honour dead  He durst not meet with hostile eyes  Whilst glitt'ring shields and swords war's bright array  Were either worn in vain or basely thrown away  III  Soon as the hero by his martial strains  Had kindled virtue in their frozen veins  Afresh the warlike spirit grows  Like flame the brave contagion ran  See in each sparkling eye it glows  And catches on from man to man  Till rage in every breast to fear succeed  And now they dare and now they wish to bleed  IV  With different movements fraught were Maro's lays  Taught flowing grief and kind concern to raise  He sung Marcellus' mournful name  In beauty's and in glory's bloom  Torn from himself from friends from fame  And rap'd into an early tomb  He sung and sorrow stole on all  And sighs began to heave and tears began to fall  V  But Rome's high empress felt the greatest smart  Touch'd both by nature and the poet's art  For as he sung the mournful strain  So well the hero's portraiture he drew  She saw him sicken fade again  And in description bleed anew  Then pierc'd and yielding to the melting lay  She sigh'd she fainted sunk and died away  VI  Thus numbers once did human breasts controul  Ah where dwells now such empire o'er the soul  Transported by harmonious lays  The mind is melted down or burns  With joy o'er Windsor forest strays  Or grieves when Eloisa mourns  Still the same ardour kindles every line  And our own POPE is now what VIRGIL was divine  To a Young Lady with FONTENELLE's Plurality of Worlds  IN this small work all nature's wonders see  The soften'd features of philosophy  In truth by easy steps you here advance  Truth as diverting as the best romance  Long had these arts to sages been confin'd  None saw their beauty till by poring blind  By studying spent like men that cram too full  From Wisdom's feast they rose not chear'd but dull  The gay and airy smil'd to see 'em grave  And fled such wisdom like Trophonius' cave  Justly they thought they might those arts despise  Which made men sullen ere they could be wise  Brought down to sight with ease you view 'em here  Tho' deep the bottom yet the stream is clear  Your flutt'ring sex still valued science less  Careless of any but the arts of dress  Their useless time was idly thrown away  On empty novels or some newborn play  The best perhaps a few loose hours might spare  For some unmeaning thing miscall'd a pray'r  In vain the glitt'ring orbs each starry night  With mingling blazes shed a flood of light  Each nymph with cold indiff'rence saw 'em rise  And taught by fops to them preferr'd her eyes  None thought the stars were suns so widely sown  None dreamt of other worlds besides our own  Well might they boast their charms when ev'ry fair  Thought this world all and her's the brightest here  Ah quit not the large thoughts this book inspires  For those thin trifles which your sex admires  Assert your claim to sense and shew mankind  That reason is not to themselves confin'd  The haughty belle whose beauty's awful shrine  'Twere sacrilege t' imagine not divine  Who thought so greatly of her eyes before  Bid her read this and then be vain no more  How poor ev'n you who reign without controul  If we except the beauties of your soul  Shou'd all beholders feel the same surprize  Shou'd all who see you see you with my eyes  Were no sick blasts to make that beauty less  Shou'd you be what I think what all confess  'Tis but a narrow space those

 Tho' sighing swains their torments tell  Their sensual love contemn  They only prize the beauteous shell  But slight the inward gem  Possession cures the wounded heart  Destroys the transient fire  But when the mind receives the dart  Enjoyment whets desire  By age your beauty will decay  Your mind improves with years  As when the blossoms fade away  The rip'ning fruit appears  May heav'n and

instructions fraught  And evidence prepar'd at large  On oath to vindicate the charge  But first 'tis meet where form denies  Poetick helps of fancy'd lies  Gay metaphors and figures fine  And similies to deck the line  'Tis meet as we before have said  To call description to our aid  Begin we then as first 'tis fitting  With the three CHIEFS in judgment sitting  Above the rest and in the chair  Sat FACTION with dissembled air  Her tongue was skill'd in specious lies  And murmurs whence dissentions rise  A smiling mask her features veil'd  Her form the patriot's robe conceal'd  With study'd blandishments she bow'd  And drew the captivated croud  The next in place and on the right  Sat ENVY hideous to the sight  Her snaky locks her hollow eyes  And haggard form forbad disguise  Pale discontent and sullen hate  Upon her wrinkled forehead sate  Her lefthand clench'd her cheek sustain'd  Her right with many a murder stain'd  A dagger clutch'd in act to strike  With starts of rage and aim oblique  Last on the left was CLAMOUR seen  Of stature vast and horrid mein  With bloated cheeks and frantick eyes  She sent her yellings to the skies  Prepar'd with trumpet in her hand  To blow sedition o'er the land  With these four more of lesser fame  And humbler rank attendant came  HYPOCRISY with smiling grace  And IMPUDENCE with brazen face  CONTENTION bold with iron lungs  And SLANDER with her hundred tongues  The walls in sculptur'd tale were rich  And statues proud in many a nich  Of chiefs who sought in FACTION's cause  And perish'd for contempt of laws  The roof in vary'd light and shade  The seat of ANARCHY display'd  Triumphant o'er a falling throne  By emblematick figures known  CONFUSION rag'd and LUST obscene  And RIOT with distemper'd mein  And OUTRAGE bold and MISCHIEF dire  And DEVASTATION clad in fire  Prone on the ground a martial maid  Expiring lay and groan'd for aid  Her shield with many a stab was pierc'd  Her laurels torn her spear revers'd  And near her crouch'd amidst the spoils  A lion painted in the toils  With look compos'd the pris'ner stood  And modest Pride By turns he view'd  The court the council and the croud  And with submissive rev'rence bow'd  Proceed we now in humbler strains  And lighter rhymes with what remains  Th' indictment grievously set forth  That SELIM lost to truth and worth  In company with one WILL PT  And many more not taken yet  In FORTYFIVE the royal palace  Did enter and to shame grown callous  Did then and there his faith forsake  And did accept receive and take  With mischievous intent and base  Value unknown a certain place  He was a second time indicted  For that by evil zeal excited  With learning more than layman's share  Which parsons want and he might spare  In letter to one GILBERT WEST  He the said SELIM did attest  Maintain support and make assertion  Of certain points from PAUL's conversion  By means whereof the said apostle  Did many an unbeliever jostle  Starting unfashionable fancies  And building truths on known romances  A third charge ran that knowing well  Wits only eat as pamphlets sell  He the said SELIM notwithstanding  Did fall to answ'ring shaming branding  Three curious Letters to the Whigs  Making no reader care three figs  For any facts contain'd therein  By such uncharitable sin  An author modest and deserving  Was destin'd to contempt and starving  Against the king his crown and peace  And all the statutes in that case  The pleader rose with brief full charg'd  And on the pris'ner's crime's enlarg'd  But not to damp the muse's fire  With rhet'rick such as courts require  We'll try to keep the reader warm  And sift the matter from the form  Virtue and social love he said  And honour from the land were fled  That PATRIOTS now like other folks  Were made the butt of vulgar jokes  While OPPOSITION dropp'd her crest  And courted pow'r for wealth and rest  Why some folks laugh'd and some folks rail'd  Why some submitted some assail'd  Angry or pleas'dall solv'd the doubt  With who were in and who were out  The sons of CLAMOUR grew so sickly  They look'd for dissolution quickly  Their Weekly Journals finely written  Were sunk in privies all beshn  OldEngland and the LondonEvening  Hardly a soul was found believing in  And Caleb once so bold and strong  Was stupid now and always wrong  Ask ye whence rose this foul disgrace  Why SELIM has receiv'd a place  And thereby brought the cause to shame  Proving that people void of blame  Might serve their country and their king  By making both the selfsame thing  By which the credulous believ'd  And others by strange arts deceiv'd  That Ministers were sometimes right  And meant not to destroy us quite  That bart'ring thus in state affairs  He next must deal in sacred wares  The clergy's rights divine invade  And smuggle in the gospeltrade  And all this zeal to reinstate  Exploded notions out of date  Sending old rakes to church in shoals  Like children sniv'ling for their souls  And ladies gay from smut and libels  To learn beliefs and read their bibles  Erecting conscience for a tutor  To damn the present by the future  As if to evils known and real  'Twas needful to annex ideal  When all of human life we know  Is care and bitterness and woe  With short transitions of delight  To set the shatter'd spirits right  Then why such mighty pains and care  To make us humbler than we are  Forbidding shortliv'd mirth and laughter  By fears of what may come hereafter  Better in ignorance to dwell  None fear but who believe an hell  And if there should be one no doubt  Men of themselves would find it out  But SELIM's crimes he said went further  And barely stopp'd on this side murther  One yet remain'd to close the charge  To which with leave he'd speak at large  And first 'twas needful to premise  That tho' so long for reasons wise  The press inviolate had stood  Productive of the publick good  Yet still too modest to abuse  It rail'd at vice but told not whose  That great improvements of late days  Were made to many an author's praise  Who not so scrupulously nice  Proclaim'd the person with the vice  Or gave where vices might be wanted  The name and took the rest for granted  Upon this plan a Champion  Author of the letters to the Whigs  rose  Unrighteous greatness to oppose  Proving the man  inventus non est  Who trades in pow'r and still is honest  And God be prais'd he did it roundly  Flogging a certain junto soundly  But chief his anger was directed  Where people least of all suspected  And SELIM not so strong as tall  Beneath his grasp appear'd to fall  But INNOCENCE as people say  Stood by and sav'd him in the fray  By her assisted and one TRUTH  A busy prating forward youth  He rally'd all his strength anew  And at the foe a Letter threw  His weakest part the weapon found  And brought him senseless to the ground  Hence OPPOSITION fled the field  And IGN'RANCE with her sev'nfold shield  And well they might for things weigh'd fully  The pris'ner with his Whore and Bully  Must prove for ev'ry foe too hard  Who never fought with such a guard  But TRUTH and INNOCENCE he said  Would stand him here in little stead  For they had evidence on oath  That would appear too hard for both  Of witnesses a fearful train  Came next th' indictments to sustain  DETRACTION HATRED and DISTRUST  And PARTY of all foes the worst  MALICE REVENGE and UNBELIEF  And DISAPPOINTMENT worn with grief  DISHONOUR foul unaw'd by shame  And ev'ry fiend that vice can name  All these in ample form depos'd  Each fact the triple charge disclos'd  With taunts and gibes of bitter sort  And asking vengeance from the court  The pris'ner said in his defence  That he indeed had small pretence  To soften facts so deeply sworn  But would for his offences mourn  Yet more he hop'd than bare repentance  Might still be urg'd to ward the sentence  That he had held a place some years  He own'd with penitence and tears  But took it not from motives base  Th' indictment there mistook the case  And tho' he had betray'd his trust  In being to his country just  Neglecting FACTION and her friends  He did it not for wicked ends  But that complaints and feuds might cease  And jarring parties mix in peace  That what he wrote to GILBERT WEST  Bore hard against him he confess'd  Yet there they wrong'd him for the fact is  He reason'd for Belief not Practice  And people might believe he thought  Tho' Practice might be deem'd a fault  He either dreamt it or was told  Religion was rever'd of old  That it gave breeding no offence  And was no foe to wit and sense  But whether this was truth or whim  He would not say the doubt with him  And no great harm he hop'd was how  Th' enlighten'd world would take it now  If they admitted it 'twas well  If not he never talk'd of hell  Nor even hop'd to change men's measures  Or frighten ladies from their pleasures  One accusation he confess'd  Had touch'd him more than all the rest  Three PatriotLetters high in fame  By him o'erthrown and brought to shame  And tho' it was a rule in vogue  If one man call'd another rogue  The party injur'd might reply  And on his foe retort the lie  Yet what accru'd from all his labour  But foul dishonour to his neighbour  And he's a most unchristian elf  Who others damns to save himself  Besides as all men knew he said  Those Letters only rail'd for bread  And hunger was a known excuse  For prostitution and abuse  A guinea properly apply'd  Had made the Writer change his side  He wish'd he had not cut and carv'd him  And own'd he should have bought not starv'd him  The court he said knew all the rest  And must proceed as they thought best  Only he hop'd such resignation  Would plead some little mitigation  And if his character was clear  From other faults and friends were near  Who would when call'd upon attest it  He did in humblest form request it  To be from punishment exempt  And only suffer their contempt  The pris'ner's friends their claim preferr'd  In turn demanding to be heard  INTEGRITY and HONOUR swore  BENEVOLENCE and twenty more  That he was always of their party  And that they knew him firm and hearty  RELIGION sober dame attended  And as she could his cause befriended  She said 'twas since she came from college  She knew him introduc'd by KNOWLEDGE  The man was modest and sincere  Nor farther could she interfere  The MUSES begg'd to interpose  But ENVY with loud hissings rose  And call'd them women of ill fame  Liars and prostitutes to shame  And said to all the world 'twas known  SELIM had had them ev'ry one  The pris'ner blush'd the MUSES frown'd  When silence was proclaim'd around  And FACTION rising with the rest  In form the pris'ner thus address'd  You SELIM thrice have been indicted  First that by wicked pride excited  And bent your country to disgrace  You have receiv'd and held a PLACE  Next INFIDELITY to wound  You've dar'd with arguments profound  To drive FREETHINKING to a stand  And with RELIGION vex the land  And lastly in contempt of right  With horrid and unnat'ral spite  You have an AUTHOR's fame o'erthrown  Thereby to build and fence your own  These crimes successive on your trial  Have met with proofs beyond denial  To which yourself with shame conceded  And but in mitigation pleaded  Yet that the justice of the court  May suffer not in men's report  Judgment a moment I suspend  To reason as from friend to friend  And first that you of all mankind  With KINGS and COURTS should stain your mind  You who were OPPOSITION's lord  Her nerves her sinews and her sword  That you at last for servile ends  Should wound the bowels of her friends  Is aggravation of offence  That leaves for mercy no pretence  Yet morefor you to urge your hate  And back the church to aid the state  For you to publish such a letter  You who have known RELIGION better  For you I say to introduce  The fraud againThere's no excuse  And last of all to crown your shame  Was it for you to load with blame  The writings of a PatriotYouth  And summon INNOCENCE and TRUTH  To prop your causeWas this for you  But Justice does your crimes pursue  And sentence now alone remains  Which thus by me the court ordains  "That you return from whence you came  "There to be stripp'd of all your fame  "By vulgar hands that once a week  "OldEngland pinch you till you squeak  "That ribbald pamphlets do pursue you  "And lies and murmurs to undo you  "With ev'ry foe that WORTH procures  "And only VIRTUE's friends be YOURS"  The TROPHY BEING SIX CANTATAS To the Honour of his ROYAL HIGHNESS  WILLIAM  Duke of  CUMBERLAND  Expressing the just Sense of a grateful Nation in the several Characters of  The VOLUNTEER  The POET  The PAINTER  The MUSICIAN  The SHEPHERD  The RELIGIOUS  By  Set to Musick by Dr GREENE  CANTATA I The VOLUNTEER  RECITATIVE  DEEP in a forest's shadowy seat  A youth enjoy'd his calm retreat  Deaf to the din of civil rage  And discord of the impious age  When visionary sleep depress'd  His drowsy lids and thus alarm'd his rest  Two rival forms immensely bright  Appear'd and charm'd his mental sight  Honour and Pleasure seem'd descending  On each her various train attending  Of decent sober great and plain  Of gay fantastick loud and vain  With confident yet charming grace  Pleasure first brake the silence of the place  AIR  Enjoy with me this calm retreat  Dissolv'd in ease thine hours shall flow  With love alone thy heart shall beat  And his be all th' alarms you know  Cares to sooth and life befriend  Pleasures on your nod attend  CHORUS  Cares to sooth and life befriend  Pleasures on your nod attend  RECITATIVE  Her decent front strait honour shew'd  Where mingled scorn and anger glow'd  Contempt of pleasure's flow'ry reign  Enrag'd at all her abject train  And thus in rapid strains express'd  The tumults of her honest breast  AIR  Rise youththy country calls thee from thy shade  Behold her tears  And hear her cries  Religion fears  And freedom dies  Amid the horrors of war's dreadful trade  Thy country groans forego thy shade  'Tis Honour calls thee to her aid  CHORUS  Thy country groans forego thy shade  'Tis Honour calls thee to her aid  RECITATIVE  The youth awokeand starting wide  Sleep with its vision left his side  His soul th' idea fill'd alone  The heroick form the piercing tone  Of Honour on his memory play'd  And all his heart confess'd the heav'nly maid  AIR  Sweet object of my choice  Adieu thou calm recess  My bleeding country's voice  Tears me from thy embrace  From musing waterfalls  From shades and flow'ry meads  'Tis virtuous Honour calls  And princely WILLIAM leads  From all a father's love  From all a nation's care  Behold where BRITAIN's Jove  Sends forth his god of war  'Gainst mountains cap'd with snows  'Gainst foul rebellion's rage  The willing hero goes  Gigantick war to wage  The gen'rous heart what flow'ry scenes can please  Or tempt to waste his youth in useless ease  CHORUS  The gen'rous heart what flow'ry scenes can please  Or tempt to waste his youth in useless ease  CANTATA II The POET  AIR  Give me indulgent muse to rove  The mazes of thy laurel'd grove  To chuse a wreath for WILLIAM's brow  Above Sybilla's golden bough  RECITATIVE  I walkI wander here and there  How can I chuse where all is fair  This I prefer and that refuse  Guide me my stillinspiring muse  I said and pluck'd the chosen wreath  Large drops of blood distill'd beneath  A sigh now shook the weeping tree  And thus a vocal sound  Brake from the recent wound  And set the form of beauteous Daphne free  AIR  Coy Daphne you behold in me  For WILLIAM's sake I willing bleed  No wreath but this from Phoebus' tree  Is worthy him who Britain freed  Less fair was Phoebus' chace for unsought fame  Be his the wreath who woo'd and won the dame  CANTATA III The PAINTER  AIR  Sweet mimick thou of nature's face  Thy pencil take thy colour spread  On thy canvas curious trace  Every virtue every grace  That hovers round our WILLIAM's head  RECITATIVE  Let Victory before him fly  And Fortitude with stedfast eye  Let Prudence with her mirror haste  Studious of future by the past  With Industry in vigour blooming  And Science knowing much yet less assuming  To group the piece and swell the train  With Hydra heads Rebellion draw  Spouting at ev'ry vein  The blood of thousands slain  Thousands too few to glut her rav'nous maw  Paint her panting sinking dying  Paint her sons at distance flying  Paint Britannia full of smiles  Scarce recover'd from her toils  Paint Justice ready to avenge her pain  Dragging the Monster in her massy chain  Near her paint Mercy crown'd softsmiling let her stand  With arm outstretch'd to stop her just determin'd hand  AIR  Cease to declaim the artist cries  Of ev'ry virtue ev'ry grace  See by degrees the features rise  Behold them all in WILLIAM's face  CANTAVA IV The MUSICIAN  RECITATIVE  O various pow'r of magick strains  To damp our joys and sooth our pains  Ev'ry movement of the will  Obedient owns the artist's skill  Thus in gay notes and boastful words  The master of the tuneful chords  But soon he found his boast was air  His love still blasted with despair  And Chloe cold or seeming cold  To all the tuneful tales he told  AIR  To love when he tun'd the soft lyre  It sigh'd and it trembled in vain  Tho' warm'd by his amorous fire  The fair one ne'er answer'd his strain  RECITATIVE  Hear cries the artist pow'r divine  Great leader of the tuneful nine  Teach thy votary to swell  With love inspiring strains the shell  Such as please my Chloe best  And easiest glide into her breast  AIR  No more I woo in warbling strains  No more I sing the lover's pains  To cold and careless ears  To warlike notes I tune the string  The song to WILLIAM's praise I sing  The nymph with rapture hears  CANTATA V The SHEPHERD  RECITATIVE  Beneath an oak's indulgent shade  A shepherd at his ease was lay'd  He pluck'd the bough the wreath he wove  Sacred to WILLIAM and to love  And taught the vocal woods around  His name and Delia's to resound  AIR  Of peace restor'd the shepherd sung  And plenty smiling o'er the fields  Of peace restor'd the woodlands rung  And all the sweets that quiet yields  Of love he sung and Delia's charms  And all restor'd by WILLIAM's arms  RECITATIVE  Driv'n from his native soil belov'd  By cost and care not unimprov'd  A northern swain himself betook  To rest in that sequester'd nook  One fav'rite lamb escap'd the spoil  The only meed of all his toil  Which now o'erspent he drove before  Now fondling in his bosom bore  He heard and strait the cause requir'd  With wonder more than envy fir'd  AIR  Say swain by what good pow'r  Thou wing'st the fleeting hour  With strains that wonder move  And tell of ease and love  While I by war's alarms  Am forc'd from safety's arms  From home and native air  And all their social care  Say swain c  RECITATIVE  Again replied the swain repair  To northern fields and native air  Again thy kindly home review  And all its social cares renew  Within what cave or forest deep  To grief indulgent or to sleep  Hast thou escap'd the gen'ral joy  Sweet gift of Britain's fav'rite boy  AIR  'Twas WILLIAM's toil this leisure gave  By him I tune my oaten reed  By him yon golden harvests wave  By him these herds in safety feed  Him shall our grateful songs declare  Ever to British shepherds dear  DUET  Him shall our grateful songs declare  Ever to British shepherds dear  CANTATA VI The RELIGIOUS  RECITATIVE  Here tyrant Superstition ugly fiend  Harpy with an angel's face  Monster in Religion's dress  Thy impious pray'rs and bloody visions end  Hence with thy sister Persecution go  Hence with all her pleasing dreams  Of martyrs' groans and virgins' screams  The stretching rack and horrid wheel  Slow fires and consecrated steel  And ev'ry priestly implement of woe  And ev'ry threat'ned tool of hoodwink'd zeal  Ingenious Rome can find or tortur'd nature feel  AIR  From Britain's happier clime repair  To southern suns and slavish air  To empty halls  To midnight bells  To cloister'd walls  To gloomy cells  Where moping Melancholy dwells  WILLIAM's name shall reach you there  And sink your souls with blank despair  RECITATIVE  The hero comes and with him brings  Fair Hope that soars on Cherub's wings  Firm Faith attends with stedfast eye  Intent on things above the sky  To mortal ken unknown and She  Meek and seemly kind and free  Ever hoping still believing  Still forbearing still forgiving  Greatest of the heavenly Three  AIR  Britons join the godlike train  Learn that all but Truth is vain  And to her lyre attune your joy  No gifts so pure as those she brings  No notes so sweet as those she sings  To praise the heav'nlyfavour'd BOY  THE Marriage of the MYRTLE and the YEW A FABLE  To DELIA about to marry beneath herself  By the Same  A Myrtle flourish'd 'mongst the flowers  And happy pass'd her maiden hours  The lovely Rose the garden's queen  Companion of this shrub was seen  The Lilly fair the Violet blue  The Eglantine beside her grew  The Woodbine's arms did round her twine  With the pale genteel Jessamine  With her's the Tuberose mix'd her sweet  The flow'rs were gracious she discreet  The envious shrub with some regret  Saw all her friends in wedlock met  Up the tall Elm the Woodbine swarms  And twines her marriageable arms  A gorgeous bower the Jess'mine chose  The glory of some ancient house  With joy she views the shortliv'd maid  The Violet drooping in the shade  And sees which pleas'd her to the quick  The Lilly hug a sapless stick  "And must Myrtilla still be seen  "Pining in sickness evergreen  "Shall she"  With that she arm'd her brow  Which once had conquests gain'd but now  Too old to chuse too proud to sue  Strikes flag to her good cousin Yew  This Yew was fair and large and good  Esteem'd a pretty stick of wood  But never in the garden plac'd  Or to be borne by nymphs of taste  But in a wilderness or waste  And cut and clip whate'er you do  This pretty stick was still but Yew  The pois'nous drops the baleful shade  Struck each genteeler flower dead  But Myrtle being evergreen  Thought nature taught to wed her kin  And careless of th' event withdrew  From her old friends and sought her Yew  Behold the am'rous shrub transplanted  And her last prayer in vengeance granted  The bride and bridegroom cling together  Enjoy the fair and scorn foul weather  Visits are pay'd around are seen  The scrubbed race of evergreen  Th' illnatur'd Holly ragged Box  And Yew's own family in flocks  But not a flow'r of scent or savour  Would do the bride so great a favour  But in contempt drew in their leaves  And shrunk away as Sensitives  The blushing  The Rose  Queen with decent pride  Turn'd as she pass'd her head aside  The Lilly nice was like to spue  To see MYRTILLA Mrs YEW  The Eglantine a prude by nature  Wou'd never go anear the Creacher  And the gay Woodbine gave a flaunt  Nor answer'd her but with a taunt  Poor MYRTLE strangely mortify'd  Too late resumes her proper pride  Which heighten'd now by pique and spleen  Paints her condition doubly mean  She sour'd her mind grew brokenhearted  And soon this spiteful world departed  And now lies decently interr'd  Near the old YEW inchurchyard  On a BAYLEAF pluck'd from VIRGIL's Tomb near  Naples    By the Same  BOLD was the irreligious hand  That could all reverence withstand  And sacrilegiously presume  To rob the poet's sacred tomb  Of so much honourable shade  As this so small a trophy made  Could dare to pluck from VIRGIL's brow  The honours Nature did bestow  Pascua  Sweetly the gentle goddess smil'd  And listen'd to her favourite child  Whether in shepherd's cleanly weed  He deftly tun'd his oaten reed  And taught the vocal woods around  His Amaryllis to resound  Rura  Or taught he in a graver strain  To cloath the field with waving grain  And in the marriagefolds to twine  The barren elm and cluster'd vine  To yoke the lab'ring ox to breed  To the known goal the foaming steed  And sung the manners rights degrees  And labours of the frugal bees  Duces  Or whether with Aeneas' name  He swell'd th' extended cheek of fame  And all his godlike labours sung  Whence Rome's extended glories sprung  The goddess smil'd and own'd she knew  Th' original from whence he drew  And grateful she spontaneous gave  This living honour to his grave  Hail thou sweet shade whose rev'renc'd name  Still foremost in the mouth of fame  Doth preference and value give  And teach this little leaf to live  Methinks secluded from that brow  Where grateful nature bad it grow  This beauteous green shou'd fade away  And yield to irontooth'd decay  But VIRGIL's name forbids that crime  And blunts the threat'ning scythe of Time  To CHLOE  Written on my BirthDay  By the Same  THE minutes the hours the days and the years  That fill up the current of time  Neither flowing with hopes neither ebbing with fears  Unheeded roll'd on to my prime  In infancy prattling in youth full of play  Still pleas'd with whatever was new  I bid the old cripple fly swifter away  To o'ertake some gay trifle in view  But when CHLOE with sweetness and sense in her look  First taught me the lesson of love  Then I counted each step the wing'd fugitive took  And bad him more leisurely move  Stop runaway stop nor thy journey pursue  For CHLOE has giv'n me her heart  To enjoy it thy years will prove many too few  If you make so much haste to depart  Still still he flies onstill still let him fly  'Till he's tired and panting for breath  My love both his teeth and his scythe shall defy  That can only be conquer'd by Death  A SONG  By the Same  Set to Musick by Dr GREENE  I  TO silent groves where weeping yew  With sadly mournful cypress join'd  Poor DAMON from the plains withdrew  To ease with plaints his lovesick mind  Pale willow into mystick wreaths he wove  And thus lamented his forsaken love  II  How often CELIA faithless maid  With arms entwined did we walk  Beneath the close unpierced shade  Beguiling time with am'rous talk  But that alas is past and I must prove  The pangs attending on forsaken love  III  But think not CELIA I will bear  With dull submission all the smart  No I'll at once drive out despair  And thy lov'd image in my heart  All arts all charms I'll practise to remove  The pangs attending on forsaken love  IV  Bacchus with greenest ivy crown'd  Hither repair with all thy train  And chace the jovial goblet round  For CELIA triumphs in my pain  With gen'rous wine assist me to remove  The pangs attending on forsaken love  V  Cou'd reason be so drown'd in wine  As never to revive again  How happy were this heart of mine  Reliev'd at once from all it's pain  But reason still with love returns to prove  The torments lasting of forsaken love  VI  Bring me the nymph whose gen'rous soul  Kindles at the circling bowl  Whose sparkling eye with wanton fire  Shoots thro' my blood a fierce desire  For ev'ry art I'll practise to remove  The pangs attending on forsaken love  VII  And what is all this transient flame  'Tis but a blaze and seen no more  A blaze that lights us to our shame  And robs us of a gay fourscore  Reason again with love returns to prove  The torment lasting of forsaken love  VIII  Hark how the jolly huntsman's cries  In concert with the op'ning hounds  Rend the wide concave of the skies  And tire dull echo with their sounds  Thou Phoebe goddess of the chace remove  The pangs attending on forsaken love  IX  Ah me the sprightlybounding doe  The chace and ev'ry thing I view  Still to my mind recall my woe  So CELIA flies so I pursue  So rooted here no arts can e'er remove  The pangs attending on forsaken love  X  Then back poor DAMON to thy grove  Since nought avails to ease thy pain  Let constancy thy flame improve  And patience answer her disdain  So gratitude may CELIA's bosom move  To pity and reward thy constant love  FASHION A SATIRE  Honestius putamus quod frequentius recti apud nos locum tenet error ubi publicus factus  SENECA  YES yes my friend disguise it as you will  To right or wrong 'tis

are led by nature none  The following facts are taken from the accounts of different countries  The hungry TARTAR rides upon his meat  To cook the dainty flesh with buttock's heat  The CHINESE complaisantly takes his bed  With his big wife and is with cawdle fed  How would our tender BRITISH beauties shriek  To see slim beaux on bulls their lances break  Yet no LUCINDA in heroic SPAIN  Admits a youth but who his beast has slain  See wond'rous lands where the fell victor brings  To his glad wives the heads of slaughter'd kings  The mangled headso'er which they sing and laugh  And in dire banquets the warm lifeblood quaff  Where youths their grandsires agebent trembling grey  Pitying their weary weakness kindly slay  Where sainted BRACHMANS sick of life retire  To die spontaneous on the spicy pyre  Where stranger still with their wild dates content  The simple swains no sighs for gold torment  How fondly partial are our judgments grown  We deem all manners odious but our own  O teach me friend to know wise NATURE's rules  And laugh like you at FASHION's hoodwink'd fools  You who to woods remov'd from modish sin  Despise the distant world's hoarse busy din  As shepherds

 Which roll'd she gave them each a twist  And husled them together  Thus mixt which ever came to hand  She very surely drew  Then bade her sister give command  For what that man should do  'Twould almost burst one's sides to hear  What strange commands she gave  That CR should the laurel wear  And CE an army have  At length when STANHOPE's name was come  Dame NATURE smil'd and cry'd  Now tell me sister this man's doom  And what shall him betide  That man said FORTUNE shall be one  Blest both by you and me  Nay then quoth NATURE let's have done  Sister I'm sure you see  The EXCEPTION  STANHOPE has gain'd one branch of same  To which I'll prove he has no claim  Say they"his favours he extends  "Without regard to wealth or friends  "Of such disinterested spirit  "Nothing prevails with him but merit  "Nay he'll dispense with merit too  "When modest want can reach his view  Meer prejudice 'tis plain to me  No man takes sweeter bribes than he  To clear this point from any doubt  A parallel shall help me out  The noble FULVIA spurns at gain  Freely she heals her lover's pain  But surely you'll allow me this  That when she grants she shares the bliss  SO STANHOPE in each gen'rous action  Reaps more than half the satisfaction  To the Earl of CHESTERFIELD  CAN ease be consistent with state  Can freedom and pomp thus agree  O STANHOPE who wou'd not be great  If easy in greatness like thee  Let statesmen pretend to despise  Those talents which furnish delight  'Tis STANHOPE's alone to be wise  Yet pleasure with wisdom unite  State burthens with form the gay soul  Unbended alone we taste joy  Too soon our grey hairs must controul  That bliss which our prime should employ  Then STANHOPE be blest in your choice  Be happy your life in each stage  Whilst spirits

ambitious miser swells his boundless store  And dreads that highest scandal to be poor  His wiser heir derides the dotard's aim  And bids profusion bribe him into fame  Oft' Honour perching on the ribon'd breast  Sneers at weak justice and defies th' arrest  She dwells exulting on the tongues of kings  She wakes the muse to flight and plumes her wings  The soldier views her in the shining blade  The pedant 'midst the lumber in his head  She to fell Treason the disguise can lend  And sheath her sword remorseless in a friend  Her throne's fantastick pride we often see  Rear'd on the tombs of Truth and Honesty  Fops templarscourtiers slavescheats Patriotsall  Pretend to hear and to obey her call  Where fix we thenEach boasting thus his own  Say does  true  Honour dwell with all or none  The truth my Lord is clearTho' impious pride  Is ever selfador'd selfdeify'd  Though fools by passion or selflove betray'd  Fall down and worship what themselves have made  Still does the Goddess in

passion's glass aside  Nor view her with the jaundic'd eye of pride  Yet judge not rashly from a partial view  Of what is wrong or right or false or true  Objects too near deceive th' observer's eye  Examine those which at a distance lie  Scarce is the structure's harmony descry'd  'Midst the tall column's and gay order's pride  But tow'rds the destin'd point your sight remove  And this shall

between  This separates pride from greatness show from worth  Detects false beauty real grace calls forth  Points out what merits praise what merits blame  Sinks in disgrace or rises into fame  Come then from past examples let us prove  What raifes hate contempt esteem or love  Can greatness give true Honour can expence  Can luxury or can magnificence  Wild is the purpose mad the fruitless aim  Like a vile prostitute to bribe fair Fame  Perswasive splendor vainly tempts her ear  And e'en allpotent gold is baffled here  Ye pyramids that once could threat the skies  Aspiring tow'rs and

are seen  Shameful in pomp conspicuously mean  In vain O Stdy thy proud forests spread  In vain each gilded turret rears its head  In vain thy Lord commands the streams to fall  Extends the view and

ridiculous pretensions of mankind to Honour and Fame enumerated  Verse Tho' they are thus inconstant and contradictory yet true Honour is a thing fixed and determinate  Verse If we would form an impartial judgment of what is truly honourable we must abstract all considerations which regard ourselves  Verse Not only so but we must remove ourselves to a proper distance from the object we examine lest some part should predominate in our eye and occasion a false judgment of the whole  Verse Therefore the surest method is to prove by past examples what commands our love and esteem  Verse  c  Expence and grandeur cannot give true Honour Their most splendid monuments vanish and even should they last for ever could not bestow real glory if only the records of Pride Tyranny and Vice  Verse  c  Much less if purchas'd by Oppression and Guilt  Verse  c  True Honour is not to be reaped from unjust Conquest It is not Victory but a just Cause that can engage our Esteem  Verse Neither is

careless hair  And give yon azure veil to flow  Loose to the wind For ah thy pain  The pitying Muse can well relate  Ah let her plaintive pour the tend'rest strain  To teach the Echoes thy disastrous fate  'Twas where the alder's closeknit shade entwin'd  What time the dogstar's fires intensely burn  In gentlest indolence reclin'd  Beside your evertrickling urn  You slept serene all free from fears  No friendly dream foretold your harm  When sudden see the tyrant Art appears  To snatch the liquid treasures from thy arm  Art Gothick art has seiz'd thy darling vase  That vase which silverslipper'd Thetis gave  For some soft story told with grace  Amid th' associates of the wave  When in sequester'd coral vales  While worlds of waters roll'd above  The circling seanymphs told

on the banks of Thames or that mild plain  Where Isis sparkles to the sunny ray  Or have they deign'd to play  Where Camus winds along his broider'd vale  Feeding each white pink and each daisie pied  That mingling paint his rushyfringed side  Yet ah celestial maids ye are not dead  Immortal as ye are ye may not die  And well I ween ye cannot quite be fled  Ere ye entune his mournful elegy  Stay

repair  To what lov'd haunt you whilom did elect  Whether Lycaeus or that mountain fair  Trim Maenelaus with piny verdure deck'd  But now it boots you not in these to stray  Or yet Cyllene's hoary shade to chuse  Or where mild Ladon's welling waters play  Forego each vain excuse  And haste to Thames's shores for Thames shall join  Our sad society and passing mourn  Letting cold tears bedew his silver urn  And when the poet's wither'd grot he laves  His reedcrown'd locks shall shake his head shall bow  His tide no more in eddies blithe shall rove  But creep soft by with longdrawn murmurs slow  For oft the poet rous'd his charmed waves  With martial notes or lull'd with strains of love  He must not now in brisk meanders flow  Gamesome and kiss the sadlysilent shore  Without the loan of some poetick woe  Can I forget how erst his osiers made  Sad sullen musick as bleak Eurus fann'd  Can I forget how gloom'd yon laureat shade  Ere death remorseless wav'd his ebon wand  How midst yon grot each silvertrickling spring  Wander'd the shelly channels all among  While as the coral roof did softly ring  Responsive to their sweetlydoleful song  Meanwhile all pale th' expiring poet laid

Essay on SATIRE occasioned by the Death of Mr POPE  By the Rev Mr BROWNE  O sacred weapon left for truth's defence  Sole dread of folly vice and insolence  To all but heav'ndirected hands deny'd  The Muse may give thee but the Gods must guide  FATE gave the word the cruel arrow sped  And POPE lies number'd with the mighty dead  Exulting Dulness ey'd the setting light  And flapp'd her wing impatient for the night  Guilt at the signal rowzing all her train  Broods o'er the glories of her growing reign  Th' envenom'd monsters spit their deadly foam  To blast the laurel that surrounds his tomb  With inextinguishable rage they burn  And snakehung Envy hisses o'er his urn  But thou whose eye from passion's film refin'd  Can see true greatness in an honest mind  Can see each virtue and each grace unite  And taste the raptures of a PURE delight  O visit oft his awful page with care  And view the bright assemblage treasur'd there  Yet deign to hear the efforts of a muse  Whose eye not wing his ardent flight pursues  Intent from this great archetype to draw  Or faintly shadow SATIRE's pow'r and law  Pleas'd if from hence th' unlearn'd may comprehend  And rev'rence HIS and SATIRE's generous end  In ev'ry breast there burns an active flame  The love of glory or the dread of shame  The passion ONE tho' diff'rent forms it wear  As brighten'd into hope or sunk by fear  The lisping infant and the hoary fire  And youth and manhood feel the heartborn fire  The charms of praise the coy the modest woo  And fly from glory that she may pursue  As Galatea  Galatea lasciva puella  Fugit ad salices sed se cupit ante videri  VIRG  playful on the green  Hides in the grove yet wishes to be seen  She pow'rful goddess rules the wise and great  Bends ev'n reluctant hermits at her feet  Haunts the proud city and the lowly shade  And sways alike the scepter and the spade  Heav'n thus in man its friendly pow'r displays  To urge him on to deeds that merit praise  But man vain man to folly only wise  Rejects the manna sent him from the skies  With rapture hears corrupted passion's call  Still proudly prone to mingle with the stall  As each deceitful shadow tempts his view  He for imagin'd substance quits the true  Eager to catch the visionary prize  In quest of glory plunges deep in vice  Till madly zealous impotently vain  He forfeits ev'ry praise he pants to gain  Thus still imperious nature plies her part  And still her dictates work in ev'ry heart  Each pow'r that sovereign nature bids enjoy  Man may corrupt but man can ne'er destroy  Like mighty rivers with resistless force  The passions rage obstructed in their course  Swell to new heights forbidden paths explore  And drown those virtues which they fed before  And sure the deadliest foe to virtue's flame  Our worst of evils is perverted shame  Beneath this yoke what abject numbers groan  The shackled slaves to folly not their own  Blind to ourselves by sordid fear oppress'd  We seek our virtues in each other's breast  Meanly adopt another's wild caprice  Another's weakness or another's vice  Each tool to hoodwink'd pride so poorly great  That pines in splendid wretchedness of state  Tir'd in ambition's chase would nobly yield  And but for shame like Sylla quit the field  The daemon Shame paints strong the ridicule  And whispers close "the world will call you fool"  Behold yon wretch to impious madness driv'n  Believes and trembles while he scoffs at heav'n  By weakness strong and bold thro' fear alone  He dreads the sneer by shallow coxcombs thrown  Dauntless pursues the path Spinoza trod  To man a coward a bravoe to GOD  Voistu ce libertin en public intrepide  Qui preche contre un Dieu que dans son ame il croit  Il iroit embrasser la verité qu'il voit  Mais de ses faux

beneath unnumber'd woes  When passions born her friends revolt her foes  Hence SATIRE's pow'r 'Tis her instructive part  To calm the wild disorders of the heart  She points the arduous height where glory lies  And teaches mad ambition to be wise  From foul example kindles fair desire  Draws good from ill from flint elicits fire  Like the nice BEE with art most subtly true  From poys'nous vice extracts a healing dew  Parody on these lines of Mr POPE  In the nice BEE what art so subtly true  From poys'nous herbs extracts a healing dew    Strips black oppression of her gay disguise  And bids the hag in native horror rise  Strikes bloated pride and lawless rapine dead  And plants the wreath of fame on virtue's head  Nor boasts the muse imaginary pow'r  Tho' oft' she mourn those ills she cannot cure  The worthy court her and the worthless fear  Who hate her piercing eye that eye revere  Her awful voice the vain and vile obey  And ev'ry foe to wisdom feels her sway  Smarts pedants as she smiles no more grow vain  Desponding fops resign the clouded cane  Hush'd at her voice pert folly's self is still  And dulness wonders while she drops her quill  Her hand from vice fair virtues oft hath sprung  As the skill'd planter raises flow'rs from dung  Weak are the ties which publick art can find  To quell the madness of the tainted mind  Cunning evades securely wrapt in wiles  And force strongsinew'd rends th' unequal toils  The stream of vice impetuous drives along  Too deep for policy for pow'r too strong  Ev'n fair religion native of the skies  Scorn'd by the fool seeks refuge with the wise  But SATIRE's arrow searches ev'ry breast  She plays a ruling passion on the rest  Fast binds the slave that earth and heav'n defy'd  And awes him from the battery of his pride  When fell corruption by her vassals crown'd  Derides fall'n justice prostrate on the ground  Swift to redress an injur'd people's groan  Bold SATIRE shakes the tyrant on her throne  Pow'rful as death defies the sordid train  And slaves and sycophants surround in vain  But with the friends of vice the foes of SATIRE  All truth is spleen all spirit is illnature  Well may they dread the Muse's fatal skill  Well may they tremble when she draws her quill  Her magick quill that like Ithuriel's spear  Displays the cloven hoof or lengthen'd ear  Bids vice and folly take unborrow'd shapes  Turns Duchesses to  Not these into Duchesses which is but a modern art  strumpets beaux to apes  Drags the vile whisperer from his dark abode  Till all the daemon starts up from the toad  O sordid maxim form'd to screen the vile  That true goodnature still must wear a smile  In frowns involv'd her beauties stronger rise  When love of virtue wakes her scorn of vice  Where justice calls 'tis cruelty to save  And 'tis the law's goodnature hangs the knave  Who combats virtue's foe is virtue's friend  Then judge of SATIRE's merit by her end  To guilt alone her vengeance stands confin'd  The object of her love is all mankind  They least are pain'd who merit Satire most  Folly the laureat's vice was Chartres' boast  And sure 'tis just to gibbet high the name  Of fools and knaves already dead to shame  Oft' SATIRE acts the faithful surgeon's part  Generous and kind tho' painful is her art  Her opticks all the dark disease explore  Her weapon launces wide the gangren'd sore  Deep wounds hypocrisy's fair seeming skin  Where death in ulcerous humours lurks within  With caution bold she only strikes to heal  Tho' folly burns to break the friendly steel  Then sure no guilt impartial SATIRE knows  Kind even in vengeance kind to virtue's foes  Whose is the crime the scandal too be their's  The knave and fool are their own libellers  Dare nobly then But conscious of your trust  As ever warm and bold be ever just  Nor court applause in these degenerate days  The hate of villains is extorted praise  O'er all be steady in a noble end  And shew mankind that truth has yet a friend  'Tis mean for empty praise of wit to write  As foplings laugh to show their teeth are white  To lash a doubtful folly with a smile  Or madly blaze unknown defects is vile  'Tis doubly vile when but to prove your art  You fix an arrow in a blameless heart  O lost to honour's call O doom'd to shame  Thou fiend accurs'd thou murderer of fame  Fell ravisher from innocence to tear  That name than life than freedom held more dear  To breathe contagion o'er the springing flow'r  Procrustes like in wantonness of pow'r  To torture truth and virtue till they fit  And die in pangs upon the rack of wit  Where shall thy baseness meet it's just return  Or what repay thy guilt but endless scorn  And know immortal truth shall mock thy toil  Immortal truth shall bid the shaft recoil  With rage redoubled wing the deadly dart  And steep its load of poison in thy heart  Let SATIRE next her proper limits know  And ere she strike besure she strikes a foe  Nor fondly deem you spy a real fool  At each gay impulse of blind ridicule  Before whose altar virtue oft' hath bled  And oft' a fated victim shall be led  Lo  It were to be wished that lord Shaftsbury had expressed himself with greater precision on this subject however thus much may be affirmed with truth  st By the general tenour of his essays on Enthusiasm and the Freedom of Wit and Humour it appears that his principal design was to recommend the way of Ridicule as he calls it for the investigation of truth and detection of falshood not only in moral but religious subjects  dly It appears no less evident that in the course of his reasonings on this question he confounds two things which are in their nature and consequences entirely different They are Ridicule and Goodhumour the latter acknowledged by all to be the best mediator in every debate the former no less regarded by most as an Embroiler and Incendiary Tho' he sets out with a formal profession of proving the efficacy of wit humour and ridicule in the investigation of truth yet by shifting and mixing his terms he generally slides insensibly into mere encomiums on goodbreeding cheerfulness urbanity and free enquiry This indeed keeps something like an argument on foot and amuses the superficial reader but to a more observant eye discovers a very contemptible defect either of sincerity or penetration  The question concerning Ridicule may be thus not improperly stated Whether doubtful propositions of any kind can be ascertained by the application of ridicule Much might be said on this question but a few words will make the matter clear to an unprejudic'd mind  The disapprobation or contempt which certain objects raise in the mind of man is a particular mode of passion the objects of this passion are apparent falshood incongruity or impropriety of some particular kinds Thus the object of fear is apparent danger or probable approaching ill But who has ever dreamt of exalting the passion of fear into a standard or test of real danger The design must have been rejected as absurd because it is the work of reason only to correct and fix the passion on its proper objects The case is parallel apparent or seeming falshoods c are the objects of contempt but it is the work of reason only to determine whether the supposed falshoods be real or fictitious But it is said  "The sense of ridicule can never be mistaken"  Why no more can the sense of Danger  "What do men never fear without reason"  Yes very commonly but they as often despise and laugh without reason And thus before any thing can be determined in either case reason and reason only must examine circumstances seperate ideas decide upon restrain and correct the passion  Hence it follows that the way of ridicule is in fact no more than a species of eloquence It applies to a passion and therefore can go no farther in the investigation of truth than any of those arts which tend to raise love pity terror rage or hatred in the heart of man Consequently his lordship might have transplanted the whole system of rhetorick into his new scheme with the same propriety as he hath introduced the way of ridicule itself A hopeful project this for the propagation of truth  As this seems to be the real nature and tendency of ridicule it hath been generally discouraged by philosophers and divines together with every other mode of eloquence when apply'd to controverted opinions This discouragement from what is said above appears to have been rational and just therefore the charge laid against divines with regard to this affair by a zealous admirer of lord Shaftsbury See a note on the Pleasures of Imagination Book III seems entirely groundless The distinction which the same author hath attempted with respect to the influence of ridicule between speculative and moral truths seems no better founded It is certain that opinions are no less liable to ridicule than actions And it is no less certain that the way of ridicule cannot determine the propriety or impropriety of the one more than the truth of the other because the same passion of contempt is equally engaged in both cases and therefore as above reason only can examine the circumstances of the action or opinion and thus fix the passion on its proper objects  Upon the whole this new design of discovering truth by the vague and unsteady light of ridicule puts one in mind of the honest Irishman who apply'd his candle to he sundial in order to see how the night went  Shaftsb'ry rears her high on reason's throne  And loads the slave with honours not her own  Bigswoln with folly as her smiles provoke  Profaneness spawns pert dulness drops a joke  Say shall we join a while this gaping crew  And prove at least the ideot may be true  Deride our weak forefathers' musty rule  Who therefore smil'd because they saw a fool  Sublimer logick now adorns our isle  We therefore see a fool because we smile  Truth in a gloomy cave why fondly seek  Lo gay she sits in laughter's dimpled cheek  Contemns each surly academick foe  And courts the spruce freethinker and the beau  Doedalian arguments but few can trace  But all can screw the muscles of their face  Hence mighty Ridicule's allconqu'ring hand  Shall work Herculean wonders thro' the land  Bound in the magick of her cobweb chain  Great WARBURTON shall rage but rage in vain  Truth's sacred prize the loudest horselaugh win  And coxcombs vanish BERKLEY by a grin  But you more wise reject th' inverted rule  That truth is e'er explor'd by ridicule  On truth on falshood let her colours fall  She throws a dazzling glare alike on all  Beware the mad advent'rer bold and blind  She hoists her sail and drives with ev'ry wind  Deaf as the storm to sinking virtue's groan  Nor heeds a friend's destruction or her own  Let clearey'd reason at the helm preside  Bear to the wind or stem the furious tide  Then mirth may urge when reason can explore  This point the way that waft us to the shore  Tho' distant times be sketch'd in SATIRE's page  Yet chief 'tis her's to draw the present age  With wisdom's lustre folly's shade contrast  And judge the reigning manners by the past  Bid Britain's heroes awful shades arise  And ancient honour beam on modern vice  Point back to minds ingenuous actions fair  Till the sons blush at what their fathers were  Ere yet 'twas beggary the great to trust  Ere yet 'twas quite a scandal to be just  When vulgar sharpers only dar'd a lye  Or falsify'd the card or cogg'd the dye  Ere lewdness the stain'd garb of honour wore  Or chastity was carted for the whore  Vice strutted in the plumes of freedom dress'd  Or publick spirit was the publick jest  Ere yet indignant SATIRE's honest page  Was fir'd to vengeance by an iron age  The parent and the nurse of ev'ry crime  The dregs the drainings of exhausted time  Be ever in a just expression bold  Yet ne'er degrade fair SATIRE to a scold  Let no unworthy rage her form debase  But let her smile and let her frown with grace  In mirth be temperate decent in her spleen  Nor while she preaches modesty obscene  Deep let her wound not rankle to a sore  Nor call his lordship her grace a  The muse's charms with surest force assail  When wrap'd in irony's transparent veil  Her beauties halfconceal'd the more surprize  And keener lustre sparkles in her eyes  Then be your line with sharp encomiums grac'd  Stile Clodius honourable Bufa chaste  For memoirs Ayre the glory of the nation  Cibber for ode and Gordon for translation  Of TACITUS    Dart not on folly an indignant eye  Who e'er discharg'd artillery on a fly  Laugh not at vice absurd the thought and vain  To bind the tiger in so weak a chain  Nay more when flagrant crimes your laughter move  The knave exults to smile is to approve  The muse's labour then success shall crown  When folly feels her smile and vice her frown  Know next what measures to each theme belong  And suit your thoughts and numbers to your song  On wings proportion'd to your quarry rise  And stoop to earth or soar among the skies  Thus when prevailing folly claims a smile  Free the expression humble be the stile  In strains adapted sing the midnight toil  Of camps and Ss disciplin'd by Hoyle  In artless numbers paint th' ambitious Pr  That mounts the box and shines a charioteer  For glory warm the leather belt puts on  And smacks the whip with art and rivals John  Or him whose moderate ambition reaches  But to his hip a connoisseur in breeches  Proud with his sheers to clip his way to fame  And grope for glory while he covers shame  Let SATIRE here in milder beauty shine  And gayly graceful sport along the line  Bid aukward folly quit her thin pretence  And smile each affectation into sense  Not so when Virtue by her guards betray'd  Spurn'd from her throne implores the muse's aid  When crimes which erst in kindred darkness lay  Rise frontless and insult the eye of day  When weeping Hymen veils his hallow'd fires  And whiterob'd Chastity with sighs retires  And rank Adultery on the marriage bed  Hot from Cocytus rears her crimson head  When private Faith and publick Trust are sold  And traitors barter Liberty for gold  When fell Corruption dark and deep as fate  Saps the foundation of a tottering state  When GiantVice and Irreligion rise  On mountain'd falsehoods to invade the skies  Then warmer numbers glow thro' SATIRE's page  And all her smiles are darken'd into rage  On eagle wing she gains Parnassus' height  Not lofty Epick soars a nobler flight  The conscious mountain trembles at her nod  And ev'ry awful gesture speaks the God  Then keener indignation fires her eye  Then flash her light'nings and her thunders fly  Wide and more wide the flaming bolts are hurl'd  Till all her wrath involves the guilty world  Yet SATIRE oft' assumes a gentler mein  And beams on virtue's friends a smile serene  Reluctant wounds but pours her balm with joy  Pleas'd to commend where merit strikes her eye  But tread with caution this enchanted ground  Inclos'd by faithless precipices round  Truth be your guide disdain ambition's call  And if you fall with truth you greatly fall  'Tis virtue's native lustre that must shine  The poet can but set it in his line  And who unmov'd with laughter can behold  A dirty pebble meanly grac'd with gold  Let real merit then adorn your lays  For shame attends on prostituted praise  And all your wit your most distinguish'd art  Can only prove you want an honest heart  Nor think the Muse by SATIRE's law confin'd  She yields description of the noblest kind  Great is the toil the latent soul to trace  To paint the heart and catch internal grace  By turns bid vice and virtue strike our eyes  Now bid a WOLSEY or SEJANUS rise  Now with a touch more sacred and refin'd  Call forth a BRUTUS' or a SCIPIO's mind  Here sweet or strong may ev'ry colour flow  Here let the pencil warm the canvass glow  Of light and shade provoke the noble strife  And wake the swelling figures into life  Thro' ages thus hath SATIRE greatly shin'd  The friend to truth to virtue and mankind  Yet the fair plant from virtue ne'er had sprung  And man was guilty ere the poet sung  With joy the Muse beheld each better age  Till glowing crimes had wak'd her into rage  Truth saw her honest spleen with just delight  And bade her wing her shafts and urge their flight  First on the sons of Greece she prov'd her art  And Sparta felt the fierce IAMBICK dart  Archilocum proprio rabies armavit Iambo  HOR    To Latium next avenging SATIRE flew  The flaming faulchion bold LUCILIUS  Ense velut stricto quoties
