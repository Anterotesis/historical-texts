 A DISSERTATION UPON PAMPHLETS  In a LETTER to a Nobleman  LONDON Printed in the YEAR MDCCXXXI  A DISSERTATION UPON PAMPHLETS And the UNDERTAKING of  PHOENIX BRITANNICUS  To  Revive  the most EXCELLENT among Them  In a LETTER to a NOBLEMAN From the Original  M S  My LORD  THE Inclination you have expressed to hear what might be said in Behalf of those most numerous Productions of our Press which we distinguish by the Name of PAMPHLETS and the present  Undertaking  by the Compiler of  PHOENIX BRITANNICUS  to Revive the most Excellent among them has induced me thus briefly to touch upon those Particulars which seemed most to attract your  Lordship  's Inquiry hoping the Readiness of my Endeavour will atone for the Imperfections of my Performance which if it does not  equal  the Extensions of your Curiosity may  add  to the Instances of your Candour So that where you find not Entertainment commensurate to your  Knowledge  you will not fail of Exercise correspondent to your  Goodness    And First for the  Derivation  of the Word  Pamphlet  I should think it little discredited by what some  Etymologists  and those who torture Words into Confessions of what they were never guilty have thro' the Confinement of themselves to some opprobrious Signification censoriously suggested thereof Thus one Linguist having found a Word which will illustrate the Adaptness of these Writings to the vulgar Consultation of the Populace would derive it from  and  as  filling all  Places which all vulgar and popular Things have the Property of doing  Minsheu  's Guide to Tongues  Fol  Another Original no less specious has been offered me by an ingenious Friend from  and  which by a Grammatical Turn reaches to the Analogy of  Sound  and by a Rhetorical Twist to the plausible Sense of  inflaming all  Parties But others considering the Subject of  Pamphlets  in a more copious and unbiassed Latitude as having branched into all other Parts of Science besides  Religion  and  Politics  from the first Appropriation of the Name and before their Engagement in Controversy could draw upon them any prevailing  Sobriquet  to their Disparagement have with less Partiality concluded of these Tracts whose Contents therefore as well as Dimensions  are so generally engaging to all Writers and Readers so much more universally suited to every Body's Perusal to every Body's Purchase that the Name is more properly derivable from  and  as if they were a Kind of Composition  beloved by  or  delighting all  People  Icon Libellorum in Pref  But notwithstanding this favourable Derivation I should not be for going to  Athens  after one or seeking it in any other of the more ancient Languages seeing  that  Word  Pampier  for  Paper  in one more Modern more probable to me as it seemed before to one of our most industrious  Glossographers  for  this  of  Pamphlet  to be derived from  Skinneri  Etymologicon Ling Ang  Fol  the last Letter of the first Syllable being interwoven by  Epenthesis  to mollify the Sound and the last Syllable substituted as a noted Term of Diminution in many Languages  Ib in Voc  Let  Sir  Hen Spelman  's Gloss  with the same Difference of Interpretation as between  Charta  and  Chartula  or  Papyrus  and  Papyrulus  Thus also in  French  the Diminutive of the Word  Livre  for a Book itself is  Livret  and thus in  English  we have  Aglet Amulet Bracelet Chaplet Corslet Eaglet Gafflet Hamlet Howlet Oilet Pallet Pullet Ringlet Rivulet  and Twenty more with like Terminations to the same Sense Now this Extraction besides the Plea of Precedent has the farther Recommendations to our Preference of not antedating the Familiarity of  Graecisms  in our Tongue and withal of deriving itself from the more apparent and determinable Quality of the Size or Substance rather than the Subject Matter of these more exiguous Compositions And thus the Word  Pamphlet  or  little Paper  Book imports no reproachful Character any more than the Word  Great  Book signifies a Pasquil as little as it does a Panegyric of itself Is neither Good nor Bad Learned nor Illiterate True nor False Serious nor Jocular of its own naked Meaning or Construction but is either of them according as the Subject makes the Distinction Thus of scurrilous and abusive  Pamphlets  to be burned in we read in  Rushworth  and by the Name of  Pamphlet  is the  Encomium  of Queen  Emma  called in  Hollinshed    As for the  Antiquity  of  Pamphlets  it is not only questionable whether the Art of  Printing  should set a Bound to it but even the very Adoption of the Name itself which yet I take to be more Modern than that Art For I look upon them as the eldest Offspring of Paper and to claim the Rights of  Primogeniture  even of Bound Volumes however they may be shorterliv'd and the Younger Brother has so much outgrown the Elder inasmuch as Arguments do now and more especially did in the Minority of our Erudition not only so much more rarely require a larger Compass than Pamphlets will comprise but these being of a more ready and facil more decent and simple Form suitable to the Character of the more Artless Ages they seem to have been preferred by our modest Ancestry for the Communication of their Sentiments before BookWriting became a  Trade  and Lucre or Vanity let in Deluges of Digressory Learning to swell up unweildy  Folio's  Thus I find not a a little to the Honour of our Subject no less a Person than the Renowned King  AELFRED  collecting his Sage Precepts and Divine Sentences with his own Royal Hand into  Quaternions of Leaves stitched together  Sir  John Spelman  's Life of  Aelfred  the Great  p  which he would inlarge with additional  Quaternions  as Occasion offered yet seemed he to keep his Collection so much within the Limits of a  Pamphlet  Size however bound together at last that he called it by the Name of his  HandBook  because he made it his constant Companion and had it at Hand wherever he was  It is so difficult to recover even any of our first Books or  Volumes  which were Printed by  William Caxton  though it is certain he set forth near Half a Hundred of them in  Folio  that it were a Wonder if his  Pamphlets  should not be quite lost  There are more extant of his Successor  Wynkin de Worde  's Printing in this lesser Form whereof as great Rarities I have seen both in  Quarto  and  Octavo  tho' holding no Comparison probably with those of his also which are destroyed But it was the Irruption of the Grand Controversy between the Church of  Rome  and the first Opposers thereof which seems to have laid the great Foundation of this Kind of Writing and to have given great Credit to it at the same Time as well by the many eminent Authors it produced in  Church  and  State  as the successful Detection and Defeat thereby befalling those religious Impostures which had so universally inslaved the Minds of Men Nay this important Reformation has been much ascribed to one little Pamphlet only which a certain Lawyer of  Grey  'sInn obliged to fly into  Germany  for having acted in a  Play  which incensed Cardinal  Wolsey  composed there and conveyed by Means of the Lady  Anne Bullen  to the Perusal of King  Henry  at the Beginning of the said Rupture  Simon Fish  's Supplication of Beggars    o    and how the Copies thereof were strewed about at the King's Procession to  Westminster  the first Example as some think of that Kind of Appeal to the Public how the Cardinal was nettled thereat how he endeavoured to stifle and secrete the same how it provoked the Pen of the bigotted Lord Chancellor  Sir  Tho More  's Supplication of Souls  how glaringly it was fix'd in the very Front of prohibited Books and yet how it captivated the said King's Esteem and Affection may be not only presumed from the Purport but gathered from the Accounts which our  Ecclesiastical  Historians have given thereof  See  Fox  's Martyr  Burnet  's Reformat  Vol  It would be endless to specify how much this Province was thenceforward cultivated by  Prelates Statesmen  and  Authors  of the first Rank not excepting  Majesty  itself in the several Examples which might be produced of the said King  Henry  VIII King  James  and King  Charles  And not to mention others of our Princes less noted though not less truly Authors in this Class the middlemost of those here named thought so honourably of these PamphletPerformances that he deemed one of his own Writing so much above all Human Patronage as to make a formal Dedication or Inscription thereof as I remember to JESUS CHRIST himself  K  James  against  Conr Vorstius  to    Yet are many of the said Labours of those ROYAL PAMPHLETEERS and others by some of the most renowned Scholars among us no less equally difficult to retrieve with the meanest and most illiterate whatever Had  Phoenix Britannicus  been alive a  Century  past or half a one sooner we might have had a better  Knowledge  of that vast Number of Pamphlets which  Montaigne  mentions  Essaye sur la Defense de  Seneque  et de  Plutarque    and whereof he intimates many to have been so ingeniously written on the aforesaid Controversy of the  Reformation  than it is now possible we shall ever arrive at even the  Names  of  But as  England  thro' its Spirit of Liberty has been the most fruitful Country for the Production of Pamphlets so the Period which has been most fruitful in them was that of our  Civil Wars  in the Reign of King  Charles  the First And indeed in all Disorders or Commotions it is natural to have Recourse to the most expeditious Intelligence and Redress lest the Delay should be more dangerous than the Deficiency of them or they superannuated before they are born For while some Persons are labouring in the  Paroxysms  of Contention were others to be pondering longwinded Expedients of Accommodation and prescribe a Volume for a  Recipe  the Dose would come too late for the Disease and the very Preparation thereof disable its Efficacy Therefore are Pamphlets and such short Tracts risest in great Revolutions which tho' looked upon by some but as  Paper Lanterns  set a flying to be gaped at by the Multitude in illuminating whom they have not always escaped the Flames themselves yet are they beheld by politic or penetrating Eyes  as the  Thermometers  of  State  foreshewing the Temperature and Changes of Government with the  Calentures  approaching therein and even Preservatives to be had against them would the  Active  be as unanimous to prevent as the  Speculative  have been industrious to prognosticate the same Tho' there may not remain as eminent Proofs among the Pamphleteers in the aforesaid  Anarchy  of an Ambition to Unanimity as there are to Dissention For surely no Nation has ever given more conspicuous Instances to what immeasurable Lengths Animosity and Indignation will advance upon the least Imposition or even Umbrage of Tyrannical or Arbitrary Power as might be exemplified among many others in the restless  John Lilburn  and the endless  William Prynne  who had both been bleeding Witnesses thereof There are near a Hundred Pamphlets written by and concerning the  first  of these Authors But the Labours of the  last  being unparallel'd I may here not improperly observe that during the  Fortytwo  Years he was a Writer he published above a  Hundred  and  Sixty  Pamphlets besides several thick Bound Volumes in  Quarto  and  Folio  all said to be gathered into about  Forty  Tomes and extant in  Lincoln  'sInn Library I think the printed Catalogue of his Writings extends not their whole Number beyond  One Hundred Sixtyeight  different Pieces But  Anthony Wood  to above  One Hundred  and  Fourscore  who also computes he must needs have composed at the Rate of a Sheet every Day from the Time that he came to Man's Estate  Athen Oxon  Vol  That Author's Character of him is drawn from his avowed Enemies even  Papists  as  Cressy  or Personal Antagonists as  Heylin  c But I cannot well omit what one sprightly Pamphleteer intimates among other Things of him to this Purpose "That  Nature  makes ever the dullest Beasts most laborious and the greatest Feeders  That  though he had read and swallowed much yet for want of Rumination he concocted little  That  to return Things unaltered was a Symptom of a feeble Stomach and as an Error in the first Concoction derives itself to the others and nourishing up a prevalescent Humour begets at last a Disease even so his Judgment being once depraved turned all his Reading into bilious or putrid Humours which being perpetually increased by his insatiate Gluttony of Books did miserably foment and heighten his Malady of Writing"  A serious Epist to Mr  W Prynn  to  p  Another of his Draughtsmen has among other humourous Touches as follows "This is the  William  whose Passion is the  Conqueror  The  Error  of whose  Judgment  and unpardonable  Instability  is to be imputed to the Loss of his two  Biasses  for if a  Bowl  's Deviation from the  Jack  is occasioned hereby much more a Rational Creature's  à fortiori"  The Character or  EarMark  of Mr  W Prynne  to  p  Neither will I omit what the Translator of the Ingenious Father  Bartoli  's  Huomo di Lettere  says in his Praise where he calls him  "Pater Patriae  forgiving us a  Daedalian  Clue in the blackest Night of Tyranny  farther adding  "Your numerous and nervous large and learned Volumes which who can reckon have been so successful in the Refutation of Errors Reformation of Vice Regulation of Disorders Restauration of Parliaments and Laws that I must in Justice join you with the Renowned General MONK as the two  worthiest  Subjects of all  Honour  For if his  Generosity  speaks him  Herculem Anglorum  your  Erudition  proclaims you  Alcidem Litterarum  c"  The Learned Man defended and reformed Transt by  T Salusbury  vo    in Epist to  W Prynne  Esq    This particular Notice of our most voluminous  Pamphleteer  will lead us to a general Review of the numerous Produce of the  Press  during that turbulent Series aforesaid wherein he was such a fruitful Instrument to  impregnate  the same and promote the licentious  Supersoetation  thereof For by the grand  Collection of Pamphlets  which was made by  Tomlinson  the Bookseller  Memoirs for the Curious    to  Vol p  from the Latterend of the  Year to the Beginning of it appears there were published in that Space near  Thirty Thousand  several Tracts and that these were not the compleat Issue of that Period there is good Presumption and I believe Proofs in Being Notwithstanding it is enriched with near a Hundred Manuscripts which no Body then being written on the Side of the  Royalists  would venture to put in Print the Whole however for it is yet undispersed is progressionally and uniformly Bound in upwards of  Two Thousand Volumes  of all Sizes The  Catalogue  which was taken by  Marmaduke Foster  the  Auctioneer  consists of  Twelve Volumes  in  Folio  Memoirs for the Curious    to  Vol p  wherein every Piece has such a punctual Register and Reference that the smallest even of a single Leaf may be readily repaired to thereby They were collected no doubt with great Assiduity and Expence and not preserved in those troublesome Times without great Danger and Difficulty the Books being often shifted from Place to Place out of the Army's Reach And so scarce were many of these Tracts even at their first Publication that King  Charles  the First is reported to have given Ten Pounds for only reading one of them over which he could no where else procure at the Owner's House in St  Paul  's ChurchYard  Ib  And yet this  Collection  will perhaps not now produce the Tenth and some think not the Twentieth Part of the  Four Thousand Pounds  which he is said to have refused for it Whatever is the Reason that they may seem to be thus depreciated I presume not to distinguish perceiving so many Reasons offering themselves to our Choice for the same As Whether it lies not in the  Way  of the present Possessor to make the best Use or Advantage of them Whether abundance of extraneous Volumes or more extended Treatises published in that  Interstice  upon Subjects foreign to a Collection of  Occasional  Pamphlets Historical and Political interfere not to make up the Number Particularly Whether it is not surcharged with the canting Divinity of  those  Times which may be thought too crude lean and dull for the Edification of  these  But more particularly Whether those who would be Purchasers having doubtless some Knowledge of Pamphlets the Use which has been and what remains to be made by Historical Writers of them do not apprehend that so many copious Collectors general and special who were contemporary with that important Period have already sufficiently gleaned and displayed whatever is Material among these more compendious Assistances For so it is evident that Mr  Rushworth  the most voluminous of them all did most plentifully supply himself from these Fountains how abundantly soever he represents the Facts therein corrupted with Fiction How fondly soever he seems to magnify his own Sagacity in the distinguishment of one from the other and how suspiciously soever he discountenances all farther Examination into them than that wherewith he has been pleased to present us where he expresses himself thus slightingly of these very Authorities which have yet so liberally contributed to such of the massy  Tomes  passing under his Name whereof he was the real Compiler  Posterity  says he should know that some durst write the Truth whilst other Men's Fancies were more busy than their Hands forging Relations building and battering Castles in the Air publishing Speeches as spoken in Parliament which were never spoken there printing Declarations which were never passed relating Battels which were never fought and Victories which were never obtained dispersing Letters which were never writ by the Authors together with many such Contrivances to abet a Party or Interest  Pudet haec opprobria  Such Practices and the Experience I had thereof and the Impossibility for any Man in AfterAges to ground a True History by relying on the printed  Pamphlets  of our Days which passed the  Press  while it was without Controul obliged me to all the Pains and Charge I have been at for many Years together to make a great  Collection  and whilst Things were fresh in Memory  to separate  Truth  from  Falshood  Things  real  from Things  fictitious  or  imaginary  whereof I shall not at all repent if I may but prove an ordinary Instrument to undeceive those who come after us  Histor Coll Voll    in Pref    Otherwise excepting those more partial and precipitous Products of this Kind wherewith that Age was so much glutted there never was a greater Esteem or a better Market never so many eager Searchers after or extravagant Purchasers of scarce Pamphlets than in these present Times as might be made evident either from the Sales of them in general as that of  Tom Britton  the celebrated  SmallcoalMan  of  Clarkenwell  who besides his  Chymical  and  Musical Collections  had one of  Choice Pamphlets  which as I have heard he sold to the late Lord  Somers  for upwards of Five Hundred Pounds And more especially that of Mr  Anthony Collins  the last Year whose Library consisting chiefly of  Pamphlets  and those mostly  Controversial  mostly  Modern  yet is reported to have been sold both Parts of it for above  Eighteen Hundred Pounds  Incouragement sufficient to make the Catalogues of other like  Auctions  as expressive and distinct as these are Or whether we descend into Particulars and consider the exorbitant Value set upon and Profits which have been made out of some single Pieces As the  Topographical  Pamphlets of  John Norden  the  Surveyor  which before they were reprinted often sold for  Forty Shillings  apiece And some of  Bale  's Tracts as that of  Anne Askew  More especially the  Examination  of Sir  John Oldcastle  which I have known to sell for  Three Guineas  though gleaned by  Fox  into his  Book of Martyrs  The  Expedition  of the Duke of  Somerset  into  Scotland  also has been sold for  Four Guineas  though totally inserted in  Hollinshed  These and some other personal Narratives I could Name are as notorious as the Advancement of  Jordano Bruno  's little Book called  Spaccio della Bestia Triumfonte  to near  Thirty Pounds  at the  Auction  of Mr  Bernard  's Books SerjeantSurgeon to her late Majesty Or of the uncastrated  Holinshead  to near  Fortyfive Pounds  some Years after Though when the former came to be known in  English  it would sometimes pass off for so many  Pence  and the Deficiencies of the Latter to be supplied out of Auditor  Jett  's Library it would not always rise to so many  Shillings  that is to say above its ordinary Estimation Plainly demonstrating  that  unreasonable Value arose not from any rich Mines of Knowledge which the scarce Part would communicate from nothing intrinsically Curious or Instructive in it nor even any material Use to be made of it but merely from the empty Property of its Singularity and being as the contending Purchasers fondly apprehended no where else recoverable  Several other Tracts besides those before specified I could mention which the Retailers of them have prized at their Weight in Gold and for which more Pounds have been exacted than probably they ever yielded Pence at their first Publication But I refrain being too Particular lest I should too inadvertently give Handles for Extortion on one Side or too distinctly expose this Dotage of Curiosity on the other nevertheless I may hereupon seasonably observe and the rather because I have had Your LORDSHIP's Noble Concurrence that this  Cacozealous  Curiosity it is which has of late been deemed so obstructive to the Advancement of Knowledge in a Set of reputed  Literati  who make no more Use of the Books they are beset with in their Studies than  Eunuchs  of the Beauties which inviron them in the  Seraglio  yet can never rest till they have gathered themselves  Libraries  to doze in like Children who will not be quiet without  Lights  to  sleep  by But those who are thus diseased would do well to consider while they monopolize such Collections as would extensively benefit the Republic of Letters and bury them in the narrow Circuit of their own private and unconsequentional Possession only because they have  great  Fortunes which will impower them to do it how detrimental they may be to industrious and ingenious Scholars of  small  ones who really want them for public and important Uses while the mercenary Salesmen making no Distinction but a general Rule of Valuation from the particular Payments of one prodigal Purchaser is incouraged to part with nothing to any Body else at the intrinsic or moderate Value Whereas if there were no extravagant  Buyers  of Books there would be no extortionate  Sellers  of them And if due Use were allowed to be made of all that are useful there would be no such shameful Scarcity among them Such Collectors would therefore do well I say again to consider that  Curmudgeons  among  Books  are as discoverable as those among  Bags  and that they may lose more Honour and Credit than gain Wisdom or Happiness by the fruitless Amassment and Imprisonment of  either    The extraordinary Price of Pamphlets aforesaid would naturally excite our more deliberate Enquiry into what has been most extraordinary in the Contents of them but so multifarious are the Subjects they comprehend that it cannot be expected I should even enumerate the same in the narrow Limits of this  Epistolary Address  What do most attract the Attention of Mankind are those dreaded Scourges of MaleAdministration commonly tho' perhaps sometimes too indiscriminately bearing the contumelious Denomination of  Libels  It matters little whether it appears to me Reasonable or not that such Writings as duly expose Villany should themselves be held vile or that some Persons who have been unjustly Injurious by any other Means may not be justly injured by this But it is obvious to all who know the Disproportion of Riches and Power in the World that there are Crimes not to be blasted and Criminals not to be branded by any other Means And since the Lashes of  Reason  will reach where those of  Justice  cannot since  Truth  will project  Defamation  from the Actions of oppressive Rulers as uncontrouledly as the  Sun  does  Shadows  from  opacous Bodies  the Redress of the Effect is to be sought for in the Cause And we should apply the  Salve  to the  Minds  which received the Provocation not  Emperic  like seek to stanch them by  binding up  the  Weapons  which returned it Nay we read that the Emperor  Charles  V King  Francis  I of  France  and even  Solyman  the Great  Turk  with  Barbarossa  the Pyrate and several other Potentates all condescended to become Tributaries to the  Satyric Muse  of  Pietro Aretino  whom notwithstanding it is not very probable they had any Way personally exasperated  Naudaeana Patiniana  vo  à Paris    in Patin  p  Some also in our own Story might be named who have taken the like Methods to assuage the Effects of their discreditable Conduct Among whom are not wanting those who having penuriously made their  Plaster  too scanty for the  Sore  have rather multiplied than substracted from their own Disgrace and industriously exposed their Folly by the imperfect Concealment of their Vice These had not the effectual Tenderness for their own Reputation it seems even of the  Turk  and  Barbarian  not that exquisite Apprehension of this durable Discipline which may  visit the Sins of the Fathers upon their Children unto the third and fourth Generation  as not the  Love  so neither the  Fear  of Men of Letters which is noted in one of the wisest  Roman  Emperors by the Historian of his Life  Lampridius

Nature that they are found not only to strike all Apology or Contradiction dumb but to stick longer upon the Names of the Accused than the Flesh upon their Bones Thus  Philip  IId's wicked Employment

Usurper last mentioned thus was a celebrated Writer of ours for immortalizing his Name after his Death  When we fix any Infamy on deceased Persons it should not be done out of any Hatred to the Dead but out of Love and Charity to the Living that the Curses which only remain in Mens Thoughts and dare not come forth against  Tyrants  because they are Tyrants while they are so may at last be for ever  settled  and  engraven  upon their  Memory  to deter all others from the like Wickedness which else in the Time of their foolish Prosperity the Flattery of their own Hearts and of other Mens Tongues would not suffer them to perceive The  Mischief  of Tyranny is too great even in the shortest Time that it can continue It is endless and insupportable if the  Example  be to Reign tooIf it were possible to cut  Tyrants  out of all  History  and to extinguish their very Names I am of Opinion that it ought to be done but since they have left behind them too  deep Wounds  to be ever closed up without a  Scar  a  least let us set such a  Mark upon their Memory  that Men of the same wicked Inclinations may be no less affrighted with their  lasting  Ignominy than inticed by their  momentary  Glories  Cowley  's Vision concern his late pretended Highness  Cromwell  the Wicked  c p  Reprinted in his Works    How little soever these Sentiments may be thought to need any Corroboration I flatter myself the following Reply of our late excellent Queen  Mary  ought not here to be forgotten When some of her Courtiers would have incensed he  against Monsieur  Jurieu  who in his Answer to Father  Maimburg  that he migh  the better justify the  Reformation  in  Scotland  made a very black Representation of thei  Queen  Mary Is it not a Shame  said one of the Company  that this Man withou  any Consideration for your Royal Person should dare to throw such infamous Calumnie  upon a Queen from whom your Royal Highness is descended Not at all  replied thi  ingenuous Princess  for is it not enough that by fulsom Praises Kings be lulled aslee  all their Lives but must Flattery accompany them to their Graves How shall the Princes fear the Judgment of Posterity if Historians were not allowed to speak Trut  after their Death    Cox  his Hist of  Ireland  Thus much for the Topics and Arguments arising from those Examples and Authorities which have occurred as most observable upon this sudden Recollection to illustrate my  present Subject  What remains to be said of  Pamphlets  will more especially regard the  present Undertaking  to make a select Revival of them The Approbation whereof may be grounded on these Considerations  First  The Regard we owe to the Preservation of Good Writings in general and to their Separation from the Bad But more in particular to these For if the Reprinting of good old  Books  is commendable much more is that of good old  Pamphlets  they being not to mention the greater Ease of the Expence really more in Want of such Justice to remove that mean Opinion which some unread therein have more indistinctly entertained of them  all  because  many  indeed are but meanly written tho' the Proportion is not greater than in Books And for those Pamphlets which really are  well  written as abundance sufficient for any such Undertaking have been by the ablest Pens upon the most emergent Points however they daily perish in the common Wreck for Want of a helping Hand they cannot be denied a just Claim to this Care  Secondly  Because they stand in greater Need of such Care than Writings better secured by their Bulk and Bindings do Many good old FamilyBooks are descended to us whose Backs and Sides our careful Grandsires Buff'd and Boss'd and Boarded against the Teeth of Time or more devouring Ignorance and whose Leaves they guarded with  Brass  nay  Silver  Clasps against the Assaults of Worm and Weather But these defenseless Conduits of Advertisement are so much more obnoxious by reason of their Nakedness and Debility to all destructive Casualties that it is more rare and difficult for Want of a proper  Asylum  to meet with some  Tracts  which have not been Printed Ten Years than with many  Books  which are more than ten Times their Age  Thirdly  As being the liveliest Pictures of their Times  Pamphlets  having this considerable Advantage that springing usually from some immediate Occasion they are copied more directly from the Life so likelier to bear a Resemblance than any more extended Draughts taken by a remoter Light But being therefore a Kind of Reading  à la Mode  and the Events their Sources so suddenly giving Way to every fresh Current of Affairs it is no Wonder if these little Maps of them are in like Manner overborne and become as transient as they And yet whenever the Political Wheel rouls into any of its former Tracks or present Occurrences tally with those of past Times doubtless what was  then  advanced for the Public Good might  now  be conducive thereto Whereas the Disorders of former Times revive and the Remedies which were prescribed against them are to seek many as well pleasant as profitable being lost merely for Want of Revival  Fourthly  The truest Images of their Authors For Pamphlets running so often upon new particular and unprecedented Subjects the Writers have less Opportunity to  commit  and their Writings are less liable to  admit  such foul and frequent Practises of  Plagiary  as Books of Matter more Various and Bulk more Voluminous too often exhibit Besides the Author being more vigorously prompted to Application by the Expediency of bringing forth his Work opportunely  is urged as has been elsewhere said upon another Occasion  Essay on Epistolary Writings  c  vo  M S  to strike out the Images of his Mind at a Heat in the most natural Form and Symmetry in the most significant Circumstances at once seldom allowing Leisure for the Writer to doat upon or dream over his Work neither to disguise it with the Conceptions of other Men nor to deform it with Chimeras of his own  Hence are they preferred by many  Critics to discover the genuine Abilities of an Author before his more dilatory and accumulated Productions  These besides many other Arguments which might be deduced from the commodious Brevity the vast Choice or Variety of wellwritten  Pamphlets  more particularly their regretted Dispersion Consumption and Obscurity but above all the many surprising Scenes to be unfolded and brought in View by select and public Collections from the rich but disregarded Store are in my Opinion sufficient Recommendations to the Encouragement of such a Revival What few Attempts have hitherto been made seem either of a shortsighted Nature or of one too unbounded Thus  Edward Husband  circumscribes himself to the Speeches and Ordinances of Parliament in a few Years of K  Charles  I As the Collections in K  Charles  II and K  William  's Reigns contain only some  StateTracts  of those Times And for  John Dunton  's Collection it might have succeeded better had he not been for rambling into foreign or heavy and unaffecting Subjects But the Undertaking most likely to succeed is one wholly unconfined as to Time and only confined to Matter domestically applicable provided the Undertaker chuses judiciously his Materials And certainly the Public might soon be obliged with a very valuable Collection if in those Particulars whereof the Collector's own Store should be deficient he were supplied by such Possessors of these Curiosities as have a Relish for the Project Which may be farther rendered a convenient Receptacle for the Restoration of what is not only rare and remarkable but pertinent and seasonable  And such among others are the Advantages promised us by the present  PHOENIX  which if it ever grows into a Volume and is accommodated with a compleat  Index  I cannot help fancying we shall imagine ourselves led into new and untrodden Paths into Regions of neglected but notable Intelligence which having lain long dormant and widely remote from ordinary Observation will look like a sudden Resurrection of Characters and Descriptions Schemes and Discoveries or rather a Kind of ReCreation of them in the Land of  Literature  So that it may yield the best Comment upon past Times and become the grand Expositor of many Incidents which General Historians are either wholly
