 THE  Modern Poetasters  OR DIRECTORS no Conjurers A FARCE ON THE Famous Ode Writers Satyrists Panegyrists  c  of the present Times and their Patrons  c  WITH The Character and True Picture of a late Director and some Others AND An Entertaining Original Scene of Mother  Wybn  's Theatre as Acted in the Hundreds of  Drury  by several Poets Directors  c  Also an EPILOGUE on the Times  Written by  Isaac Bickerstaff jun  Esq  LONDON  Printed for and Sold by  T Bickerton  at the  Crown  in  PaterNosterRow  PERSONS  Sauney  a  Scotch  Poet come to  London  Goosecap  a Pretender to the Bays renown'd for  Don Quixotism  Smart  a sprightly young Poet  Aimat  a Female Poetaster  Wealthy  a late Director of the SouthSea whom they all Compliment  Æ²pstart  his Clerk  Scentwell  a Woman of the Town  Mother  Wybn  Whores Bawds Bullies  c  The Modern Poetasters  SCENE  The  Piazza  in  CoventGarden  Enter  Goosecap  and  Sauney  embracing each other  Sauney  in a Scotch Dress and  Goosecap  in Black his Coat daub'd all o'er with Snuff a Dirty Neckcloth round his Neck and his Peruke hanging to one side  Goose  YOu're welcome dear  Sauney  from the  Northern  Climate to a more Friendly Air and this famous Metropolis where your great and exalted Genius will meet with its merited Reward and your poetical Abilities shine in their full Splendor  Saun  Upon my Soul Man you say too much to an unworthy BrotherI am a Stranger to  England  but extraordinarily pleas'd with your good Acquaintance which recompences the Toil of my fatiguing Journey from the City of  Edinburgh  Goose  Your Toil my Friend you'll think the greatest Pleasure of your Life when you find by my unequall'd Pen your Character is rais'd to the Top Pinacle of Fame  Virgil  's Shade will envy the Reputation I am capable of giving you  Saun  Virgil  was an Eminent Poet He's unequall'd in this Age unless it be in you  Goose  You speak like a Man of Judgment Brother and I doubt not to convince the ignorant World that  Virgil  amidst his soaring Flights and pompous Elegance was an Ass to  Sl  Saun  But we shall find it a plaguy Task to persuade the giddy Multitude to this Opinion You may seem to resemble the Style and Manner of the Ancients but I fear the Colours are faint and will not bear ExaminationThey are  strong and sublime  we  weak  and  spiritless  Goose  I thought you Gentlemen had more of the  Hibernian  Quality than to entertain a mean Opinion of your selves and your own Capacities Lay aside Humility if you intend to thrive in the  English  Territories and let Conceit Hypocrisy and Pride take place be bold and audacious in selfpraises learn to Cabal flatter and Condemn and the Game's your own  Saun  To all these I'm a Stranger my Dear  Goose  For what did you desert your Native CountryCan you expect Services from me and you entirely unqualified  Saun  But hold 'tis not too late to learnI believe I can despise Merit and for a considerable Sum be a considerable Flatterer but the greatest Work is to compliment my self  Goose  Pugh that's the easiest Thing in the World you've Nature on your side which incites Fondness in all to Works of their own Production I can do it with an Air of Gravity and damn with a Grace the Misbelievers of an Untruth  Saun  But you have the Happiness Brother to be Establish'd and it requires some Time for a Man to be Entered in any thing altho' it be in Iniquity  Goose  Every airy Female tells ye her Ware is the best most charming the most inviting and all thatAnd cannot we extoll our own Verses many whereof describe those Beauties they falsly pretend to be Mistresses of  Saun  Woud'nt it be better that like a fair virtuous Woman we make no Boastings of our selves but let our own real Worth recommend us to Mankind  Goose  There's no such thing as real Worth my Friend 'tis all imaginary The whole Universe is a sham and false RepresentationGenerals are not always made with Fighting Scholars by Learning nor Divines by Study No Management and Caballing will save infinite Trouble of that kind'Tis but to place proper Famebrokers at the most remarkable Parts of the Town Fellows of good Lungs to bellow out your Praise the Work is done the ignorant Populace fam'd for Credulity will believe it with as much Eagerness as they entertain Scandal against true Merit and thus is a Reputation at once acquired  Saun  But this seems according to my Notion of Things to be inconsistent with true Sense and 'tis contrary to all Scottish Politicks we are equally backward in Praising as in Condemning  Goose  Sense Sir is nothing else but a Rule of acting on the Principle of Interest so that if it promotes my Profit I'll applaud my self or any senseless Wretch and if my Fortune cannot be raised without calumniating what is truly Great and Glorious the doing it is an Argument of sound Sense and perfectly consonant with the Dictates of Nature and the great  SENECA  's Philosophy  Saun  I cannot be of your Opinion Brother I must term that  Abuse  which you are pleas'd to call Sense in Spite of the greatest Oratory to recommend it  Goose  You must learn to think more advantagiously if you expect Prosperity hereBut that I may not be tedious in my first Lectures we'll quit this Conversation and retire to a House of Diversion in the Hundreds of  Drury  we'll drink 'till we rival the Sun with our ruddy Complexions set up all Night with the Moon lye with half a Dozen Virgins break all the Windows of the Mansion and then like true Sons of  Parnassus  make a hasty Escape and pay no Reckoning but leave that to be accounted for by the Gods  Saun  Will not the Substitutes of  Venus  exhaust our Poetical Fire  Goose  No they'll encrease it  Saun  But have ye no SalamandersI fear I shall be metamorphiz'd to a Glowworm  Goose  None at all my DearI'll help ye to an agreeable Female with whom Safety will be your Lot  Saun  The Deel damn me if I don't think the Lot of  Jonas  will be mine  Goose  You'll be in no Belly of a Whale I'll assure ye  Saun  But perhaps of something worseor the Jaws of some terrible Monster  Goose  Let not your Courage be cast downCome we'll away to Mother  Wybns  Enter  Smart  Smart  Have I found my Enemy at last    To Goosecap    Goose  I'm an Enemy to nothing but that Merit which is of a superiour kind SirDear  Sauney  repair to  Button  's I'll be with you presently    To  Sauny  Exit  Sauny  Smart  Have you any Pretence Sir to Merit  Goose  As much as you have to be a  Coxcomb  Sir  Smart  The Coxcomb does not belong to me at present  Goose  I can write  Sense  and  English  a Capacity you are unacquainted with  Smart  In your Walk to St  J  's  street  there is neither English Sense nor Grammar and your best Pieces of Poetry are but Trifles  Goose  It would be an Honour to you Sir to be the Author of such Trifles  Smart  I can receive no Honour from your AccomplishmentsYou have by good Fortune indeed wrote one Piece that has sold but more from the Popularity of the Subject than the Performance  your best Scenes of Love are notoriously worse than those of the lowest Poet in this or any other AgeThe few Similies are no way adapted and really appear like Flowers in a DunghillIn your other Poetical Writings all the Beauties are borrow'd If we divest you of your Thefts you'll resemble the Crow in the Fable and little will remain but Froth and Rhime  Goose  Thou foolish Boy do'st Thee pretend to criticise on the Greatest Genius of the Age  Smart  You may compliment your Genius as you please and your Friends may give it out but I shall take Liberty to affirm that 'tis far from being a perfect one in Poetry A perfect Genius is capable of producing a finish'd Piece of the greatest Length which is what you will never be Master ofA few good Lines I confess you sometimes happen to write but more from a  Flashy Wit  than a true  Native Genius  Goose  My Genius is eminently conspicuous in every thing I doCan you peruse any Performance of mine where I don't strike out with a surprizing Strength of Poetical FuryAnd in my Odes my Flights are very Extraordinary  Smart  Your Flights are like those of the Owl never Soaring or Lofty If you intend to gain a solid Reputation you must  strike out  the greatest part of what you have written Leave off recommending the Works of others in order to assume the Honour of the Whole yourself and  blaming that which you cannot mend for no other Reason than because you've had no Hand in't  Goose  Why all this unmerited Calumny  Smart  Your Talent is Calumny Brother tho' preposterously mix'd with PanegyrickYou can condemn and praise even the same thing and at such times as it merits neither your Censure nor ApprobationYou can lampoon your best Friends and abuse your greatest Benefactors in their Absence and supported by a Gamester you think to Bully Mankind  Goose  This is provoking with a Vengeance wou'd any one but a Poet bear all this  Smart  You are born to bear the Burthen of your Folly and the Repetition of your FaultsA first RateMinister of State was first your Patron him you've commended to Excess since you've let fly at him at least twenty Satyrs On a great Statesman whom you've lately prais'd first a Satyr then a Panegyrick On a certain Noble Lord first a Panegyrick then a Lampoon A great Commoner first a Satyr then a Compliment and many other Instances of this kind I could enumerate And as Hypocrisy is your Principle the Whigs have your present Praises but the Tories and Jacobites your Affections  Goose  If I should gain any Honour by beating of a Monkey I wou'd do it  Smart  Come onI've some Inches of my Sword at your Service  Goose  But few Inches for a Lady I presumeYou're a Child and deserve the RodFarewell    Exit  Smart  AdieuWhat a vain conceited Wretch is this He gives me an Aversion to all Poetry and Poets and almost to my self as one of the Number  Enter  Aimat  Aimat  Your Servant Mr  Smart  I've been looking for you an Age and want to consult you in an Affair of the greatest Consequence  Smart  I am at your ServiceWhat is your Business Madam  Aim  To correct a Poem of my Writing on the Man in the Moon  Smart  Your Subject Madam is equally high
