wicked but his mother let him always have his way and then his father was afraid that the poor child might cry his eyes out if he wanted any thing and should not get it Being thus indulged his whims grew every day more frequent and they could not always be gratified for his parents were extremely poor and lived as the expression is from hand to mouth He grew at last quite obstinate and quarrelsome insisted upon having every thing that he saw and when he could not get it would grow sulky tear his cloaths to show his spite do nothing that he was bid to do and often quite the contrary  His parents were much grieved to see this behaviour in him and judged it to proceed from a heart naturally perverse Alas cried his mother I once hoped that our little Robin would in time console us under all our griefs be the joy of our old age and work for our support when we were past our strength reflecting that we had done so much to feed and bring him up but on the contrary he is our greatest unhappiness His principles are quite corrupt said the father every one will hate him utterly and not a soul assist him in his need He will commit some wicked action and be punished for it by his country He will live in shame and misery God grant I may be dead before this comes to pass  These mortifying thoughts would constantly be uppermost within them They were now no longer cheerful at their daily toil and had no appetite for their meals Their sorrow had a visible effect upon their health their strength soon failed them and one morning being more  depressed than usual they had not sufficient spirits to get up Not so the little Robin he was up as usual and called for his breakfast Robin said his mother I am very ill and cannot rise to get it for you On which he sulked she wept and Hutchinson his father sighed The little urchin waited yet some time but seeing neither of them stir resolved instantly what to do He went to a neighbour's house for a light as he designed to make a fire A little girl came down to let him in and seeing Robin asked him what he wanted with a tone of voice that seemed to say he was not welcome for she did not like him in the least I want to light my candle answered Robin Well do so returned the little girl as I have let you in but do not come here again This way of talking Robin did not much like He was very easily offended so he went away and did not even light his candle  After this he visited another neighbour who came down but seeing Robin through the casement he would not so much as ask him what he wanted but went up again Refused admittance every where he came home put down the candle and bethought himself of going to a good old woman's who formerly used to treat him with sweet things He went and asked her for some breakfast Breakfast answered Frances why has not your mother let you have some She is abed said Robin Well your father then He likewise is abed They say they are ill And would you leave them then and come to me for victuals Get you gone I have nothing for you Had I more than what I want myself I would give it to poor children who are fonder of their parents than you are and make them happy whereas you every day torment yours  Robin came away in tears and walked home very slowly In the way he recollected that he himself had frequently shammed illness and supposed it not impossible that his parents might now be doing the same For certainty he got upon a little chair held back the curtain and beheld how pale they were He saw that they had been crying too This sight affected him He put the curtains to again sat down beside the bed and held his hands up to his face Unhappy that I am  said he suppose my parents were to die what would become of me I am refused admittance every where and cannot obtain a bit of bread I must then have been very wicked my poor mother how you have at all times loved me and how have I grieved you And my father my dear fatherWho can tell alas but they will die  He sat a little longer thinking and returning afterwards to the house where he had been refused entrance at first begged for heaven's sake that they would let him have a little bread and milk to make a breakfast for his parents His affliction and the humble tone of voice with which he now addressed them easily gained him a hearing Look ye said the good man of the cottage since you ask me thus I will not refuse you Take the half of this brown loaf with some of this milk and warm it for your parents It is but just that you should prepare their breakfast while they are both working so hard for you He durst not mention that they were ill because he feared the same reproaches which Frances had bestowed upon him though he merited them now much less on which account his charitable benefactor did not go himself to see them as he would have done had he but known their situation for he esteemed them greatly  In the mean time Robin brought away the bread and milk came home made up a fire and putting on a pipkin boiled the milk It was no sooner ready than he drew a little table towards the bed His mother heard him move about the chamber What can Robin be doing said his mother Nothing good I fear answered Hutchinson She wished to know endeavoured to sit up in bed and looking through the curtains which were very flimsy saw the little table with two porringers and Robin who was cutting bread into them Upon this she jogged her husband See said she I verily believe he is doing this for us else why two porringers upon the table Would to God said Hutchinson he were I am not hungry but should like to be convinced that he is better than we have thought him  Robin with his pipkin came at last and filling both the porringers approached his parents Hold said he  dear father hold dear motherHere's some breakfast for you bothAnd is it you that prepared it said the father Who could give you all this bread and milk It was neighbour suchaone answered he The father and the mother bade him put down both the porringers again Their eyes grew bright with joy Dear child come hither cried they You are not what we thought you to be you bring both of us to life again So saying they held out their arms he bent to their embrace he wept as they did likewise he desired forgiveness for the grief which he had occasioned them and promised that they should henceforth be rejoiced by his behaviour  He was still in their arms when Frances entered with her breakfast in her hand which she brought in order to share it with her indisposed good neighbours She was moved at such a piteous sight shed tears of joy and blessed the little Robin who onhis side tenderly embraced her also They all breakfasted together and had never in their lives before enjoyed so sweet a meal  The happiness of such a day soon reestablished this good father and this loving mother in their former state of health The little boy also became very happy He acquired the love of every one that knew him was caressed with justice by his parents and the charitable Frances who rejoiced to do them all the good in her power  AMELIA  AMELIA when scarcely six years old was very fond of her mamma and wished continually to be with her On a certain day Amelia's mother wished to go to market and the little girl entreated to accompany her thither You will only be troublesome to me child said she No no I hope I shall not be troublesome to you said Amelia and pressed so much that her mama at last consented to give her leave  They set out therefore both together As it chanced their house was in the country and the paths proved very bad Amelia frequently was forced to walk behind her mother when the ruts would not permit them to have hold of one another They were now come very near the town and as it chanced the road was crouded with a multitude of people passing every way The little girl was often separated from her mother but this gave her no uneasiness as after two or three such accidents she had rejoined her with ease but the nearer they approached the market the more she perceived the crowd to augment This should necessarily have made her watchful of the way that her mother went and yet a sort of puppetshow which was exhibiting had charms sufficient to detain her She stopped short to gaze at Punchinello In the midst however of her entertainment she turned round but could not see her mother she ran on called out and scrambling up a bank at once looked over all the people's heads but it was in vain She could not see her could not hear her voice and now the little maiden being frightened durst not mix among so great a crowd that jostled one another So she got into a corner called out mammy mammy and burst into a flood of tears  The people that went by looked at her  There is a little girl  said one among them  in a piteous taking What is the matter with you  asked another  I have lost my mammy Oh never mind it  answered he  You will find her cut again I warrant you  A third said  Do not cry my little girl She will not come to you the sooner for that  Thus said many and they all went on about their business  By good luck at last however an old woman who sold eggs and butter and was lame and therefore could not walk without a crutch was going by but seeing her in such distress stopped short and pitied her  And which way was your mother going little dear  said the woman  when you lost her She was going to the market  said Amelia  Well be comforted  replied the first  and come along with me I will take you to the market You will find her there no doubt  Amelia gave her hand that moment to the good old woman and soon reached the market As they entered she perceived her mother gave a cry of joy and up her mother came immediately She took the little girl into her arms and said You frightened me exceedingly  my dear by wandering from me and the child that moment fell a hugging her and cried  She told her of the puppetshow and that she had stopped to look at it how she called out after her and how the good old marketwoman and she only had taken pity of her and brought her through the crowd Amelia's mother thanked her bought what eggs and butter she had left and gave her more than she asked Amelia kissed her ten times over and while going home would talk of nothing but the good old marketwoman  When the first fine weather came Amelia begged her mother to go see Dame Dunch which was the marketwoman's name and she consented took a loaf of bread and half a pound of tea with sugar in proportion Dame Dunch's dwelling was a wooden one it was not large but very clean and comfortable In the front there was a little grassplat shaded on every side by fruit trees upon which Amelia danced till evening with a niece of the Dame's who was as kind and good natured as her aunt  Amelia's mother always bought Dame Dunch's eggs and butter but complained that she rated them at too low a price while Dame Dunch would have it that she was paid too much Amelia and her mother gave the good old woman all the assistance in their power and when in  her  turn the old woman could be serviceable to Amelia or her mother she would put on her cloth apron take her crutch and come quite out of breath but very joyous  Thus they did each other mutual service but the good old woman had the greatest reason to rejoice that she had taken pity on a little girl in trouble In the act of helping her she did not think that her good heart would gain her such a world of happy hours  THE RUFFLES AND GARTERS  Letitia Serina  Letitia  WHAT a charming day is Christmas Monday when one has such handsome presents How I long to see it  Serina  O do not speak about it sister The first five and twenty days of this dull gloomy month appear much longer than the rest all put together What fine things we are to have I dream about them every night and wake a dozen times when Christmas Monday is the first thing that takes up my thoughts  Letitia  Do you recollect last year how all mama's acquaintance brought us playthings and sweetmeats We had really so much we knew not where to put them  Serina  They were spread upon a large square table and mama came out to call us with her charming voice Come come said she and take these presents She embraced us and shed tears I never saw her half so happy as that day when she beheld us jump about the room for joy  Letitia  I think indeed she seemed much happier than ourselves  Serina  One would have thought that she had received the Christmasboxes  Letitia  There must consequently be a pleasure I suppose in giving so I will tell you what we ought to do Letitia We are very little and of course have little that we can give But still we have it in our power to get this pleasure  Serina  How pray Letitia  Letitia  Why it wants a fortnight now you know of Christmas Monday and we both have money in our pockets  Serina  Yes I have upwards of a crown What shall we do then  Letitia  You recollect our fair comes on tomorrow Well then we must get up early and work hard and study diligently and do every part of our business well that in the afternoon we may have leave to go and see the  fair Now I have more a good deal than nine shillings We will each take half our money and go buy the prettiest things that we can see We will bring them home all cleverly wrapped up and early upon Christmas Monday give them to our gardener's children  Serina  Yes but then Letitia the poor woman's children who comes here to work occasionally must have something likewise  Letitia  Right I did not think of them O how delighted they will be I fancy the poor little children in their joy will say that they never had a Christmasbox before  Serina  In that case we shall be the first to cause them such a deal of pleasureO my dear dear sister I must hug you for that thought  Letitia  Yes but stay a little I have another in my head This money which we design to spend  Serina  Is ours and we may lay it out as we think proper  Letitia  Yes that is true But  Serina  Well but what  Letitia  We had it from mama you know it was her present to us as in general all our money is Now sister if we lay this money out in presents for the children it will then be mama that has made these presents and not we  Serina  That is true indeed and yet we have no other money  Letitia  We can notwithstanding hit on some expedient for the purpose I dare say For in the first place I can work indifferently at my needle and you knit with tolerable ease  Serina  Of what use will this be  Letitia  You will not be long before you have knit a pair of garters for papa and I have been this fortnight at a pair of ruffles which he does not know What then hinders pray but we may finish these two articles a day or two on this side Christmas Monday  Serina  Well and if we do what then  Letitia  Why then we can present the garters and the rurfles to papa who will be glad to buy them of us and pay thrice as much as they are worth  Serina  Yes I am sure of that But still the fair will be tomorrow and we cannot before then finish what you know is to procure the money that we would lay out at the fair  Letitia  Nor is it necessary for the money that we shall want to make our purchase at the fair we may borrow of ourselves and afterwards repay it upwards of two days before we make our presents Thus then we shall really have it in our power to say that we alone gave Christmasboxes to the poor children  Serina  A good scheme indeed Well you are always the readiest at these matters I confess but then that is because you are the eldest  Letitia  Bless me How we shall both rejoice in being able to afford them so much pleasure  Serina  I could wish that tomorrow were the day  Letitia  Never fear it will soon come now and we shall be happy even in the expectation of its coming  ABEL  LITTLE Abel was scarce turned of eight years old when he had the misfortune to lose his mother It afflicted him so much that nothing could restore him to the gaiety so natural to young children Mrs Donaldson his aunt was forced to take him to her house for fear his sadness should still aggravate her brother's inconsolable distress  They went however frequently to see him and at last the time was come for going out of mourning Abel therefore quitted his and though his heart was full of sorrow he endeavoured to assume a lively countenance His father was affected at this sensibility but alas it only occasioned him more sorrow by causing him to reflect that he had for ever lost the mother of this amiable child and this reflexion every one remarked was bringing him with sorrow to the grave  It was a fortnight now since Abel had been to see him as usual His aunt always urged some pretext or other during that time as often as he wished to go The truth  is Mr Donaldson was dangerously ill He durst not ask to see his child from apprehension that the sight of his condition might too much affect him These paternal struggles joined with the former depression of his spirits so exhausted him that very soon there was no hope remaining of his cure He died in fact upon the day before his birthday  On the morrow Abel having waked betimes tormented Mrs Donaldson so much for leave to go and wish his father joy that she at last consented but he saw his mourning was now to go on again  And why this ugly black said he today when we are going to papaWho is dead now aunt  His aunt was so afflicted that she could not speak a word  Well then said Abel if you will not tell me I will enquire of my papa  At this she could no longer refrain from weeping but burst out into a flood of tears and said It is he it is he himself that is dead  What my papa dead answered he O heaven take pity on me My mama first dead and now papa Unhappy as I am and parentless what will become of me O my papa mama  These words were scarcely uttered when he fell into a swoon nor could his aunt without much difficulty bring him to himself again  Poor child said she do not be thus afflicted Your parents are still living  Abel  Yes but where  Mrs Donaldson  In heaven with God They are both happy in that place and will at all times have an eye upon their child If you are prudent diligent and upright they will pray that God may bless you and God certainly  will  bless you This was the last prayer that your father uttered yesterday when dying  Abel  Yesterday when I was thinking of the pleasure that I should have in seeing him this morningYesterday Then he is not buried yet O aunt pray let me see him He would not send for me fearing to afflict me and perhaps I on the contrary should have afflicted him But now as I cannot possibly give him any pain I would  once more behold him for the last last time Pray let me go and see him my dear aunt  Mrs Donaldson  Well then we will go together if you promise to be calm You see my tears and how much I am grieved for having lost my brother He was always doing me some good or other I was poor and had no maintenance but what his bounty gave me Notwithstanding which I yield myself you see to Providence that watches over us Be calm then my dear child  Abel  Yes yes I must indeed be calm But pray aunt carry me to my papa that I may see at least his coffin  Mrs Donaldson then took him by the hand and instantly went out the day was very dark and even foggy Abel wept as he went on  When they were come before the house the mutes were at the door and Mr Donaldson's late friends and neighbours were standing round his coffin They wept bitterly and praised the integrity of the deceased Little Abel rushed into the house and threw himself upon the coffin For some time he could not speak a word but at last raised his head a little crying out See how your little Abel weeps for having lost you When mama died you consoled me and yet wept yourself but now who will console me for your loss Oh my papa my good papa  He could utter no more his sorrow almost strangled him His mouth was open and his tongue seemed motionless His eyes at one time fixed and at another rolling in their sockets had no tears to shed His aunt had need of all her strength to pluck him from the coffin She conducted him to a neighbour's house begging her to keep him till his father's burial was over for she durst not think of carrying him to see it  Very soon the bell was set a tolling Abel heard it and the woman to whose care he had been trusted having quitted the apartment for a moment he availed himself of the opportunity got out and ran that instant to the churchyard whither the funeral was gone The minister had finished and the grave was filling upwhen all at once a cry was heard of  Bury me with my papa  and Abel jumped into the grave  The mourners were affected at it Abel was drawn out all pale and speechless and in spite of his resistance carried home  He was for upwards of three days continually fainting and his aunt could not bring him to be composed even at intervals except by speaking to him of his dear papa At length his first excess of anguish was allayed he wept no longer but was very sorrowful  A worthy merchant heard of this deplorable affair He had not been without some knowledge of the father therefore he repaired to Mrs Donaldson that he might see the little orphan He was very much affected at his sadness took him home and was a father to him Abel soon considered himself as really the merchant's son and every day gained greater ground in his affection At the age of twenty he conducted all the business of his benefactor with so much success that in reality the merchant thought it his duty to assign him half the profits of it for the future to which recompense he added his beloved daughterAbel hitherto had maintained his aunt out of the little perquisites belonging to him and by this event he had the further happiness of making her quite easy for the remnant of her days But never did his father's birthday come about but he was seized in some sort with a fever on recalling to his memory what he once had suffered at that season and to those sensations which then affected him did he impute the principles of honour and integrity that he ever afterwards cultivated during the whole of a long life  VERSES  addressed by  MAURICE  to  LADY ABBERVILLE  See  Vol II p  YOUR kindness madam ev'ry day renew'd  With cordial amity and tender grace  Once made me dread left feeble gratitude  Should with your friendship hold unequal pace  But no dear lady 'twas a groundless fear  My heart a debtor for its happiness  As reason ripens each succeeding year  Shall ask her aid its throbbings to express  The joy which from this grateful task I feel  If such your gen'rous acts to you convey  Light shall old age upon your virtues steal  And all your hours glide happily away  THE COMPLIMENT OF THE NEW YEAR  UPON a certain newyear's day little Peregrine came into the parlour just before breakfast was ready He advanced and with the greatest gravity saluting his papa began as follows in a solemn tone of voice  "As formerly the Romans were accustomed every newyear's day to wish their friends all happiness so  I  thrice honoured father comeSo  I  thrice honoured father comecomecome"  The little orator at this stopped short It was in vain he fretted rubbed his forehead and began to fumble in his pocket The remainder of this excellent harangue was not forth coming The poor little boy was vexed and quite in agitation Mr Vesey saw and pitied his embarrassment embraced him tenderly and said as follows "Truly a most elegant oration You yourself no doubt composed it"  Peregrine  No papa you are very good to think so but I am not half learned enough for such a task It was my brother that drew it up You should have heard the whole He told me that it was in periods and the periods he said were rounded off into the bargain Look ye I will but run it over once and you shall hear it then or would you rather hear mama's I have  that  perfectly I am sure It is extracted from the Grecian History  Mr Vesey  No no Peregrine it is not necessary and your mother and myself without it are as much indebted both to your affection and your brother's  Peregrine  Oh he was a fortnight I assure you at the work and I employed a deal of time in learning them What an unlucky thing that I should now forget when I  most wanted to remember it No longer ago than last night believe me I delivered the whole speech without the least hesitation in the servant's room and speaking to your wigblock if it could but tell you  Mr Vesey  I was then at study in my closet and to comfort you must say I heard it  Peregrine  brighteming up  Did youI am glad of that and do not you think papa that I spoke it very well  Mr Vesey  Surprisingly I must acknowledge  Peregrine  Oh but it was very fine  Mr Vesey  To say the truth your brother has quite crammed it full of eloquence And yet I should have liked a single word or two much better from yourself  Peregrine  But sure papa to say that I wish the person to whom I am speaking a happy new year and nothing else is far too common to give pleasure  Mr Vesey  Yes but why then nothing else as if instead of offering such a naked compliment you could not previously have thought within yourself what I wished most of all to enjoy during the course of this new year  Peregrine  Oh that is not difficult You wish no doubt to have your health to see your family your friends and fortune flourish and to enjoy a deal of pleasure  Mr Vesey  Well do not you wish me all this  Reregrine  Yes with all my heart  Mr Vesey  What hinders then but you could have made me up yourself a charming compliment without requiring the assistance of another  Peregrine  Really I did not think myself so learned but it is always thus when  you  instruct me since I find out things which I did not think were in me I can now make compliments to every one that I know I need say nothing but what I have mentioned just this moment  Mr Vesey  It may suit I must acknowledge many people but should certainly be different with respect to others  Peregrine  Yes I understand you pretty well papa but I do not know what the difference should be so explain it to me now we are alone  Mr Vesey  With all my heart There are a multitude of what are called good things that one may wish any  person whatsoever to enjoy such as what you mentioned just now there are others that refer to different individuals according to their situations age and duties For example one may wish to a man who is happy already the long continuation of his happiness to an unhappy man the end of his affliction to a man in office that God's providence may bless his labours for the public welfare give him necessary penetration with the gift of perseverance to continue in them and establish the enjoyment of felicity among his countrymen by way of recompence on his endeavours To an old man one may wish a length of life exempt from every inconveniency to children on the other hand the preservation of their parents progress in their studies with a love of arts to parents the completion of their hopes in bringing up their children every species of prosperity to such as are our benefactors and the long continuation of their kindness It is our duty even to bethink us of our enemies and to pray that God may show them the injustice of their conduct and inspire them with a wish of meriting our friendship  Peregrine  O papa how much I thank you I have now a budget full of compliments for every one I shall know what sort of wishes they will expect and have no occasion for my brother's rounded periods as he calls them but why as we should always have these wishes in our heart pray tell me why the first day of the year in preference to any other should be pitched upon to publish them  Mr Vesey  Because our life is as it were a ladder every step of which is represented by a year It is natural that our friends should flock together and make merry with us when our foot has got in safety on the step next to  that  which we lately trod and to express their wish that we should climb the rest with equal safety Do you understand me  Peregrine  O papa quite clearly  Mr Vesey  It is however in my power to make this clearer still by using what we call another figure  Peregrine  Ah let us have it pray papa  Mr Vesey  Do you remember then our going to the top of that fine church in London called St Paul's  Peregrine  Oh what a charming prospect from the golden gallery there Why you remember we could see all London and a great deal of the country from it  Mr Vesey  Greenwich hospital particularly struck your eye and as you could not then have any notion of the distance you proposed that we should the following week go there on foot to dinner  Peregrine  Well papa and did I not pray walk the whole long journey like a man  Mr Vesey  Yes well enough I had no reason to find fault with your performance but remember I took care at every milestone on the road to make you sit and rest a little  Peregrine  So you did indeed and it was in my opinion no bad idea at the first to put up those figured stones beside the road One knows at any time what distance one has walked how much is still to come and so regulates one's pace accordingly  Mr Vesey  In this you have yourself explained the advantages which arise from our dividing life into those equal portions that we call years for every year is something like a milestone in the road of life  Peregrine  I understand you And the seasons are perhaps so many quartermiles which tell us that we shall very soon arrive at the next stone  Mr Vesey  Your observation is extremely just and I am glad that this little journey is still fresh in your remembrance If you take it in a proper point of view it will exhibit a true picture of life Remember if you can the different circumstances that took place while you were posting on to Greenwich tell them in the order in which they fell out as well as you are able and I will make the application  Peregrine  I should scarce remember the whole business better had it happened yesterday At first as I was full of spirits and desired to let you see it I set out upon a trot and made a number of trips I do not well know how many You advised me to go slowly as the journey would be rather long I followed your advice and had no reason to repent Upon the way I asked for information at the sight of every thing of which I did not know the meaning and you were pleased to tell me When we happened to go by a bit of grass we sat down on it and  you read a storybook that you had brought out in your pocket to divert me Then we got upon our feet again and as we went along you told me many other things not only useful but diverting likewise In this manner though the weather was not altogether fine though we had sometimes rain and once a hailstorm to encounter we arrived at Greenwich I remember very fresh and hearty and made afterwards a charming dinner  Mr Vesey  Very faithfully related Peregrine but for some few circumstances which however I am glad you have not introduced as for example your attention to a poor blind man whom you caught by the arm if you remember to prevent him from falling upon a heap of stones that lay before him and on which he might have broke his legs the assistance that you afforded a poor washer woman's boy by picking up a handkerchief of linen which had fallen out of the cart but particularly the alms that you gave to several people on the road  Peregrine  Do you think then papa that I forgot them I know that we should not boast of any good that we may have had the opportunity of doing  Mr Vesey  And on that account I am greatly pleased in dwelling on it as a recompence for so much modesty It is just that I should repay you some small portion of the joy which you caused me  Peregrine  Oh I saw tears rolling in your eye not once alone nor twice but often I was so delighted if you knew how much that sight made me forget my weariness I walked much the better for it But let me have the application that you just mentioned  Mr Vesey  It is as follows Peregrine Give me all the attention in your power  Peregrine  Fear nothing I will not lose a syllable sir of what you tell me I assure you  Mr Vesey  The look then which you cast round you from the golden gallery all over London and a great deal as you mentioned of the country is expressive of the first reflexions of a child upon the multitude about him The long walk that you chose to Greenwich is the journey which we propose to ourselves through life The eagerness with which you wished to hurry on at setting out without consulting your ability for running and which cost you such repeated trips is the natural  impetuosity of youth which would excite us to the worst excesses if a faithful and experienced friend were not to moderate it The instruction that you derived as we were walking on from reading and conversing with me and the actions of goodwill and charity that you performed took off from the fatigue of such a journey and you finished it thereby with satisfaction to yourself though there had fallen a deal of rain and even hail These circumstances too convey instruction for in life there are no other means than the performance of our duty to keep off disquietude and to cherish peace within us notwithstanding those vicissitudes of fortune which would otherwise perhaps go near to overwhelm us and the comfortable meal that we made at the conclusion of our journey is no other than an emblem of the recompence which God gives us when we die to crown those virtuous actions that we have laboured to perform while in this world  Peregrine  Yes yes papa all this squares wonderfully well and I shall have a deal of happiness I see beforehand in the year that is now begun  Mr Vesey  It rests with yourself alone to make the year quite happy but once more let us return to our excursion Do you recollect when in going round that we might see a little of the park we came upon Blackheath The heavens were then serene and we could see behind us all the way that we had been walking  Peregrine  Yes indeed papa and I was proud of having walked so far  Mr Vesey  By  proud  you mean rejoiced Are you then equally rejoiced at present while your reason which now dawns within you pauses and cast back a look upon the way that you have already made in life You entered it quite weak and naked without any means of making in the least degree provision for your wants It was your mother who gave you your first food and it is I that have the forethought to subsist you How do we desire you to repay us We want nothing more than that you should yourself endeavour to be happy by becoming just and honest by acquiring a due notion of your several duties and by seriously intending to discharge them Have you then fulfilled these few conditions no less advantageous to yourself than easy Have you first of all been grateful  to God's goodness who has willed that you should be born of parents possessing wherewithal to bring you up in ease and honour Have you always shewn those parents the obedience and respect that you owe them Have you paid attention to the precepts of your teachers Have you never given occasion for your brothers or your sisters to complain of envy or injustice in you Have you always treated those who wait upon you with a proper sort of condescension and at no time claimed from their inferior situation what it was their duty to refuse you In a word do you possess that love of justice that equality of conduct and that moderation which we by our instruction and example are at all times doing what we can to set before you  Peregrine  Ah papa let us not look so much at what is past but to the future Every thing that I should have done I promise by God's blessing to do hereafter  Mr Vesey  That is well said embrace me therefore Peregrine I accept your promise and confine to its performance all the wishes that I need make on my side for your happiness on this renewal of the year  THE CHRISTMASBOX  A DRAMA in Two ACTS  CHARACTERS  MR DAMER  EDWARD  his Children  VERONICA  his Children  CHARLES  Edward's Friend  ARCHIBALD  an Orphan  CLEMENT  a Servant  SCENE  An apartment in the house of Mr Damer  ACT I  SCENE I  Charles Archibald  Archibald  SO early with us Master Charles  Charles  Yes Archibald and what is more I want to speak with you  Archibald  With me sir What can occasion me the honour of your visit  Charles  What except the pleasure Archibald of seeing you The truth however is that I am come to know what Christmasboxes you have had  Archibald  What Christmasboxes do you ask me If my mother sister and myself have but the necessary things of life we are content  Charles  But Mr Damer surely lets you want for nothing  Archibald  It is true indeed we are his debtors for whatever we possess and he continues in our favour the respect as I may call it that he had for my poor father and his son too has a friendship for us Do you see sir this new suit of clothes upon me it is Edward's present It was bought for him but his papa permitted him to give it me by way of Christmasbox He has prevailed  too on Miss Veronica to present my sister with a few of her cast clothes and we were last night very happy in receiving them  Charles  I suppose so but if you talk of Christmasboxes it is he that has received some fine ones no doubt  Archibald  Certainly his father is so rich and yet I know not if his pleasure was as great as ours Fine things are no novelties to him And what we may receive whenever we think proper never gives us so much joy as what  they  feel to whom their benefactors unexpectedly make presents  Charles  I agree with you in this but cannot you tell me what Edward has received No doubt he has shown you all his presents  Archibald  Yes yes that he has indeed but how shall I remember the whole catalogue Let me reflect a little In the first place he has had some books a case of mathematical instruments a microscope silk stockings and a set of silver buttons for a suit of clothes compleat  Charles  But those are not the things that I mean What I want to know about friend Archibald are the sweetmeats and nice things that generally are presented at this season of the year to children of our age  Archibald  Oh his papa has given him no such things he says that sweetmeats do but rot the teeth and as for playthings certainly Edward is too big to wish for such matters It is only from his aunt that he received trifles of this sort She indeed has given him some of what you mention  Charles  Ay ay and what for instance  Archibald  How can I remember them There is in the first place a great cake a quantity of candied orange peel some capillaire and sweetmeats halfadozen companies of French and English soldiers cast in lead and in their uniforms a draftboard fish and counters and about a dozen china figures made in Derbyshire But rather go and speak to him yourself He will show you every thing that he has received Why do you put these several questions to me  Charles  Oh I know what I am doing I had my reasons for interrogating you before I went up stairs into Edward's room  Archibald  And what pray are those reasons May I know  Charles  I had determined never to reveal them but provided you will but be secret  Archibald  I am no prater  Charles  Then give me your promise  Archibald  There is my hand  Charles  Well then I will tell you as a secret that I would have you keep Edward is finely taken in  Archibald  Edward finely taken in my friend I cannot endure such language  Charles  Then I will tell you nothing I am still master of my secret you know that  Archibald  How Charles And can you wrong then my dear friend Edward at this rate  Charles  O be assured I shall not wrong him personally but I speak of an affair in which we both have come to an agreement  Archibald  But if taken in he is deceived  Charles  No no he has deceived himself entirely  Archibald  I do not understand a word of this enigma  Charles  I will explain the matter to you We had previously agreed to go equal sharers in our Christmasboxes whatsoever they might be respecting every thing that in its nature was divisible  Archibald  Well pray and can he lose by such a bargain His papa is not so rich as yours Your Christmasboxes therefore must at least in point of value equal his and very probably exceed them  Charles  It is true indeed I have received a very handsome Christmasbox This watch for instance but a watch you know cannot be divided  Archibald  On your honour you have had no other present  Charles  Nothing I assure you but a cake and two small boxes of preserves My father says as Mr Damer does that sweetmeats hurt one While mama was living it was quite another thing for then I had such delicacies in abundance and Edward knows as much who saw my last year's Christmasboxes It was this that induced him to make such a bargain with me and last week too we confirmed it on our word You see then  Archibald  Yes I see too clearly that Edward is to be your dupe He will have only half a cake and some preserves for what he is to give you up It is true his aunt has sent him more than he can eat But is it true then Master Charles that you had nothing else I must confess I find it very difficult to credit your assertion  Charles  Difficult to credit my assertion Shall I swear then to the truth of what I say  Archibald  Swear Fye Should a little gentleman as you are think of swearing in this matter It is entirely your affair and if you are deceiving my good friend Edward you will lose much more than he Charles  Charles  But Archibald do you know that I do not approve of such remonstrances It is Edward's business to reflect on the affair Suppose Edward had received no Christmasbox  Archibald  There was no fear of that His friends are generous and Edward's conduct pleases them Your Christmasbox is such a trifle It would be quite unhandsome in you to expect that Edward should have all the disadvantage on his side and therefore we must go and tell him  Charles  Oh that is done already Late last night I sent him half the cake that I received and part of my preserves I have likewise written him a little letter on the subject  Archibald  What then you will persist in your demand upon him  Charles  And pray what would you do in my situation You that talk so much  Archibald  I would have nothing from him having nothing upon my side to bestow and therefore quit him of his promise  Charles  Oh your humble servant Keep your counsel to yourself Our bargain is a wager and when people think of laying wagers it is that they may win Next year it shall be as he pleases but at present if he does not give me half of every thing that he has received his cake his orangepeel his sweetmeats soldiers fish and counters china ware and any thing else that you may have forgot to mention I will follow him through all the streets courts lanes and every thoroughfare in London and proclaim him for a cheat Yes tell him that from  me friend Archibald and that such as we should keep our promise after we have sworn to one another  Archibald  After you have sworn Fie fie upon your oaths I am very poor and yet if you would give me all the Christmasboxes that ever you received not excepting even your fine watch I would not swear in such a trifling matter It should be a very solemn business only that would make me take an oath  Charles  Why Archibald you are a downright simpleton Without this swearing how should any one be bound to keep his promise  Archibald  Do you ask that seriously His very promise should compel him to observe it and the word of honest people be as sacred as an oath If you judge otherwise I do not know what I am to think of you  Charles  It is your idea then that Edward will be faithful to his promise  Archibald  My idea Should he break it insignificant as I must own myself I would never look upon him as long as I have breath But no he will not break it and to keep his word will have no manner of occasion for an oath  Charles  That we shall see However tell him every thing that I have said that he may act accordingly  Archibald  I need tell him nothing He does not want a monitor to do his duty  Charles  And pray add I wish him joy that he is so finely taken in  Archibald  What then you would insult as well as  Charles  No but I divert myself at his expence as he would do at mine Let him alone Another time if he thinks proper he may be revenged  Archibald  No no this is the only business of the kind that ever he will tranfact with you  Charles  As he pleases I have wherewithal by this day's lucky business to console myself    He goes out    Archibald    alone    I could not have imagined Charles so mercenary If in truth he has no more than what he tells me from his father why then did he not break off the bargain when he found it likely to press so hard upon his friend What avarice and what meanness likewise It is Edward's fault however and will hardly ruin him But here he comes  SCENE III  Archibald Edward  Edward    with a paper    Ah dear Archibald I deserve and richly to be hooted for my follyRead this letter  Archibald  I have learned what it contains But pray how came you to make such a bargain Certainly you should have first asked leave of your papa and aunt since what your parents and relations give you should not be disposed of without their consent  Edward  That is true but it is done  Archibald  And you must keep your word But wherefore give it then  Edward  Because last year and the preceding Charles had better Christmasboxes than myself and I supposed  Archibald  Ah ah I understand the matter You designed to dupe him then therefore you are punished with justice  Edward  Had I been contented with my own  Archibald  Well no complaints Edward Is not your half still sufficient for you  Edward  So you fancy  Archibald  Do not go on Edward means to ask me if he ought to keep his word  Edward  But are you certain that every thing was fair and open on the part of Charles  Archibald  I think him honest since he told me so himself and it is my practice to think well of every one till he has once deceived me  Edward  But how happens it that his father should have been so sparing towards him Every former Christmas he has had a store of presents  Archibald  They were his mama's and now she is dead his father thinks as yours does and instead of childish toys has bought him a fine watch  Edward  Yes yes I know it He will conceal what ought to be divided of his presents and yet  I  must give him up half mine  Archibald  Should he behave so he would be a knave  Edward  And should I in that case be bound to keep my promise with him  Archibald  What is this question my good friend Edward Just as if you were to ask me whether if he proves a cheat you might not be so likewise  Edward  But unless I tell him he will never know what I have had  Archibald  And can you hide this knowledge from yourself  Edward  But I have hardly had from my papa more things that can be shared than he The rest you know were from my aunt  Archibald  Did you except what any one but your papa might give you in your bargain  Edward  Oh no no  Archibald  Then your objection is answered  Edward    vexed    What shall I do then  Archibald  I have told you that already You have but one way to take in this affair  Edward  If I think fit to take it to be sure I may but what can force me if I do not  Archibald  Your honour Should you be so shameful as to break your word then Charles will certainly expose your conduct and with justice  Edward  Oh I do not mind that a rush I will answer him at any time But how pray will he be convinced that I have broke my word  Archibald  He knows already every thing that you have received I told him  Edward  What and can you have betrayed me ArchibaldI will preserve no future friendship with you  Archibald  I should die with grief if I had willingly betrayed you dear Edward I can very easily excuse my conduct by declaring that before I knew of your agreement Charles contrived to take me by surprize But if it were not so and he had called upon me to speak truth I must have done it To be honest one should no more lie than break one's word  Edward  You take his part against me and shall I be still your friend No no  Archibald  As you please I know what it must cost me if I lose your friendship which is much more precious to me than even all the gifts that your family have heaped upon me but at every risque I have no other counsel  for you and although you should not rest my friend nothing shall keep me while I live from being yours  Edward  A good friend truly to look on while I am robbed  Archibald  And pray who robs you but yourself Why should you thus have entered into an agreement at the risque of losing  Edward  But I might have gained  Archibald  And then would you have claimed your bargain from Charles  Edward  Would IWhat a question  Archibald  Why then would you not fulfil it on your part and show that you can be just when the conditions are so easy  Edward  Are so easy What the loss of half my property  Archibald  Have you not the other half still left Well then imagine yourself to have received no more but think particularly how much reputation such an action will procure you in men's eyes when they observe that you put no value upon what the generality of children so fondly prize but can scorn them when your word is to be kept As many as are told of your fidelity will love you Granting Charles designs to trick you I am sure he will never have the courage afterwards to look you in the face whereas upon the other hand you will walk before him with your head up sure of the esteem of all good people Yes my dear Edward let us always deal uprightly whatsoever price it costs us Ah if I were rich you should not have to mourn your loss a moment upon this occasion I would give you every thing in my possession to make you amends  Edward    embracing him    Oh how much my dearest Archibald is your behaviour to be praised while I must hate myself for mine Yes I confess it I was mercenary and unjust but will be so no longer I will look with scorn upon the baubles that had charms enough as I imagined to corrupt me so let Charles directly have his share and you yourself shall halve them give him what you please I only desire that you would not scorn me for indulging such mean thoughts I will be henceforth worthy your esteem and friendship  Archibald  And you are so You were never worthier of it than at present I was well acquainted with your heart and knew what measures you would take This conquest of yourself will cause you much more satisfaction than the trifles that you give up when some few days are passed they would have lost their charms and you would certainly have given the whole away at once to any child that should have wanted them  Edward  Yes yes you know me very well What therefore can I do to show you my regard and gratitude for having saved my honour  Archibald    embracing him    Still love me Edward  Edward  Always always but it is proper that I should now go fetch my presents and make haste to share them I am quite uneasy till they are gone and fear I shall repent of what I am about to do if I do not soon dispatch it  Archibald  You would soon repent of that repentance should it happen I am certain of it    Edward goes out    Archibald    alone    No were all his presents mine I should not be so pleased as I am now in thus saving Edward's reputation And in fact how happy must he be himself in having kept his word at the expence of what he thought so precious Doubtless this sacrifice costs him dear well then it will be on that account more glorious I was certain of his principles He needed nothing but a little explanation of the matter to behave with honour  SCENE III  Archibald Edward  Edward    bringing in a large twohandled basket    Come and help me Archibald that I may not let the basket fall for every thing within it now I look upon as sacred I have left the cake in the beaufet for fear of breaking it but when it is wanted I will go fetch it Here is the candied orangepeel however    he opens the parcel and gives it to Archibald    This I take it is about the middle Take this side for Charles and let me have the other in the box  Archibald  No no it will be better far to halve it in his presence he may otherwise imagine that you have eat  some of it So let us see the rest of the confectionary First four bags of sweetmeatsTwo for eachTwo bottles next of capillaireOne Charles's and the other yoursHow many fish and counters are there here  Edward  Two hundred fish and twenty counters  Archibald    after having counted out half of each    These are his The bag cannot be divided You must therefore take it with the other fish and counters  Edward  And these soldiers How delighted we should both have been in ranging them against each other when the winter evenings were come on  Archibald  We should indeed but I am more delighted as it is The English soldiers shall be yours Their uniform is red and therefore much more lively than the whiteA draftboard and a microscope  Edward  Ah luckily they cannot be divided  Archibald  In reality they cannot but together they may make two lots and each of you take one for Charles when he appears may fall a quibbling with us and I recommend you to keep clear no less of his suspicions than his open accusations Give him up the draftboard and keep you the microscope You may employ it to obtain the knowledge of a thousand beauteous objects that escape our eyesight  Edward  Ah here comes what I shall be the most grieved to give upThese sweet china figures  Archibald  You could not have put all together on your chimneypiece Can you inform me what they represent  Edward  The Muses and the Seasons  Archibald  Then give him the Seasons You may justly take the best in your division and the Muses cannot with propriety be parted But Edward not to settle things by halves let me advise you to throw in the other fish and counters with the bag His  Seasons  will be taken as valuable as your  Muses    He puts all the fish and counters into Charles's heap    There they are  Edward  You make me do whatever you think fit  Archibald  What I would do myself if I were in your place But what comes hereHa ha a set of copperplatesI did not mention these to Charles  Edward    overjoyed    You don't say so  Archibald  But what of that It is just the same as if he knew it Let me count the number one two three    he counts two dozen reading over their inscriptions and dividing them accordingly    These    taking up one parcel    it seems are the reigning kings of Europe and these other    counting    one two three four five six seven great men that flourished once in England  Edward  Well which parcel shall we chuse  Archibald    shewing him two plates selected from the second parcel    Here here is our choice this portrait is that Howard of whom you have heard your father so often speak with rapture and here is Gay whose Fables always give you so much pleasure Keep by all means such a good companion    He puts the kings into Charles's lot and Howard with the other fix into Edward's    That is the whole  Edward    with a sigh    Yes yes  Archibald  But why that sigh  Edward  Because you make me give him up so many charming things  Archibald  Not I my dear Edward  you  make yourself do this It was your resolution and is still so is it not  Edward  Yes yes I have nothing else to beg dear Archibald but that Charles may have his share immediately The sight of so much that I must give away grieves me  Archibald  Think no more about it You have done your duty I will go speak to Charles and bring him hither If as you imagine he has cheated you I wish I cannot well tell you how much harm I wish him    He goes out    Edward    alone    Yes yes how much harm you wish him In addition to my loss of all these charming things the harm to me is that he will laugh at my simplicity in making such a bargain When he sent me late last night my miserable portion of his presents doubtless he began that moment to enjoy his triumph    He approaches the table and surveys the things upon it with a look of sorrow    I must part then with so much and part with it to one that meant to trick me I cannot help preferring now whatever is not in my share These bags of sweetmeats seem much bigger than my two That draftboard likewise that I thought to play on when my friends should come and see me seems much prettier now than before And those soldiers they would have made me up an army  All this but just now was mine and I must give it up and give it up for nothing toofor nothing    He reflects within himself a little    Is my word then nothing and my honour is that nothing Ifbut don't I hear a step Yes yes it is Charles or now I look again not he but Veronica  SCENE IV  Edward Veronica  Veronica    looking eagerly at every thing upon the table    What are you about Edward What is the meaning of all this Do you intend me one of these two shares I can hardly think so yet I should look upon it as quite loving in you  Edward  Ah my dearest sister I would give you half my Christmasbox with pleasure but it is not in my power as half of what you see is mine no longer to dispose of as I please  Veronica  Is yours no longerWhy so Edward But oh now I understand youThis is some new trick of Archibald's He is always wheedling you for something which he tells you others want and what he can pinch out of you this way he is sure to keep himself  Edward  Do not speak dear sister in this manner of that worthy boy I would give every thing in my possession to have his principles  Veronica  Well then why are you no longer master of your own  Edward  You will say I am justly punished for my gripingness for I must yield to Charles one part of the presents made me by my aunt and my papa  Veronica  Instead of giving me that half and why  Edward  Because we bargained to divide our Christmasboxes I have had a deal this year and he unfortunately nothing  Veronica  Then I would give him nothing that is but just  Edward  But we have pledged our honour to each other He has kept his word and I must keep mine also or be looked on as a thief  Veronica  Ay ay you have got this notion from your Archibald I am mad to think that you let yourself be governed by a chit who lives on our assistance  Edward  But pray sister though the notion should be Archibald's is it not a just one  Veronica  Is it not a just one Never Look ye I would lay a wager that he is now agreed with Charles to share whatever he can thus persuade you to give up  Edward  Do you think so seriously But no you do him wrong he is too generous to do that  Veronica  It is you Edward that are too weak or you might think that he would much more naturally take your part than any other's if he were not interested  Edward  I profess myself his friend and he is interested that I should not be a cheat  Veronica  GoodHa ha ha And so then that you may not be a cheat you will willingly be cheated by another  Edward  Better than cheat him myself  Veronica  And in a manner so ridiculousHa ha How finely they are laughing at you  Edward  What is Archibald laughing at me  Veronica  If he helps to cheat you  Edward  But I have pledged my word The shares are made as you may see and Charles is coming  Veronica  Well and let him go away I shall be glad to see you catch them when they think you caught  Edward  You would have me then disgrace myself that I may save these baubles  Veronica  But suppose you could save them with honour  Edward  Ay pray how  Veronica  Why papa or rather aunt for she may be more easy of persuasion must be told the whole affair and they will forbid your parting with their presentsI myself will take the business on me  Edward  No no sister if you love me  Veronica  You are determined to be pillaged Be it so then I have no objection in the least since I shall not be the loser by it on the other hand I shall enjoy the opportunity of laughing at your cost And yet on second thoughts I will run and tell papa if it be only to obtain you a good scolding since you will not follow my advice  Edward  But sisterhear mePray come back a littleWhat you won'tYou cannot imagine how much you will displease me    He follows and endeavours to bring her back but she refuses    ACT II  SCENE I  Edward    returning after a few minutes absence    I could not possibly prevail upon her to come back but she would go and tell papaIn fact she is in the rightIf my papa and aunt forbid me I keep every thing and do not break my word I wonder that this idea did not sooner strike me It is indeed unjust in some degree and there is a voice within me that condemns it I should not have entered into this agreement without thinking of each separate circumstance and guarding properly against them I wish Archibald were but here to fix me one way or another I am at a loss for his counsel When he comes I hope it will be alone Ah here he is and as I wished to have it no one is with him  SCENE II  Edward Archibald  Archibald  Charles will very soon be here He is gone to ask his father's leave for coming Be of courage dear Edward nor let Charles suspect that these playthings are of any value to you I begin to think he does not deal with you upon the square in this transaction I spoke to him rather seriously and by his answers he appeared embarrassed  Edward  Oh I am sure he means to trick me notwithstanding which I must be satisfied  Archibald  And have you not great cause for satisfaction You have done your duty  Edward  Well I will try to conquer my reluctance in this point and put on a good face before him but would any one conceive what Veronica told me not ten minutes since That I should beg papa or aunt to lay their orders  on me who would certainly forbid my giving any thing away and thus I should preserve my Christmasbox and reputation  Archibald  And your peace of mindwould you preserve that likewise  Edward  No indeed I even thought while she was speaking how disgraceful such an application would be to me  Archibald  Why then hesitate a moment longer O my dear Edward let us never stifle those first whisperings of integrity and generosity that may be heard within us You will soon experience how much inward satisfaction flows from listening to them Have we any real need of these poor gimcracks here to make us happy Oh when you have parted with them I will be more industrious to procure you other sources of amusement If my friendship is of any value to you be assured I shall esteem you ten times more if you consult your honour in this matter  Edward  Yes I will do so dear Archibald and be proud of yielding to your counsel as in every other matter so in this too I will follow it however Veronica may persuade me to do otherwise These  gimcracks  as you call them Out upon such childishnesses for to prove how truly I despise them look I will add my two remaining sweetmeat bags to Charles'sTherethey shall be mine no longer  Archibald  Bravely done Edward You are like a general who returns in triumph after having won a battle  Edward  Always have an eye upon me and if you observe  Archibald  I know what you would say but softly here comes Charles  SCENE III  Edward Archibald Charles  Charles    somewhat embarrassed    Good morrow dear Edward I am told you want to speak with meIt grieves me notwithstanding  Edward  What grieves you pray  Charles  That my Christmasbox has been so trifling and  Edward  Oh never mind it if that be all  Archibald  Edward is but so much the more pleased that he can compensate for what you want and I could wish that you knew with how much pleasure he fulfils his promise now but he himself can tell you what he thinks on this occasion  Edward  Yes What I am now to do I do with all my heart    He takes Charles by the hand and brings him to the table    So look ye here are all my presents we first halved them pretty nearly after which I added something to your share that you might have no reason to complain  Archibald  Two articles the microscope and draftboard could not be divided By the terms of your agreement therefore your friend might have kept them both but he has honourably chosen to give up the draftboard and accordingly I put it to your share  Edward  I am sorry Charles that these china figures could not be divided equally I have kept the  Muses  but because the  Seasons  were less valuable I have added to them all the fish and counters in this bag which were my own You may still however make choice of which lot you please  Charles  No no my friend I am quite content already  Edward  But not I There is besides all this a cake below of which the half is mine I make a present to you of the whole and run to fetch it  Charles    calling him back    No not now Edward  Archibald    stopping Charles    Let him let him Charles    To Edward    Yes go my friend    Edward goes out    Well I am sure you will own Edward thinks quite nobly since you see his promise is so sacred to him Any other in his situation might have been afflicted at the disadvantage of the bargain made between you but Edward goes beyond the agreement and is happy in thus exceeding your expectations  Charles    confused    True you make me blush dear Archibald And I cannot tell how it is  Archibald  You have no need to blush as if it were a fault in you that you received no greater presents from your father  Charles    turning away    Poor Edward  Archibald  Should you pity him he would have reason to complain whereas at present he has none It would have been the shame of tricking you and nothing else that must have rendered him unhappy Look at what you have and be rejoiced as he is  Edward    coming in with the cake    Hold here is what I give you half as I have already said is over and above the bargain  Charles    putting back the cake with one hand and with the other concealing his face    No Edward it is too much  Edward  Take it take it Charles but do not imagine that I am doing thus through shame for having wished to keep back any of my presents from you Archibald I am sure will witness for me as to that  Archibald    looking stedfastly at Charles    That I will and in the face of the whole world    Charles wipes his eyes    Edward  But sure you are crying Mr Charles What ails you  Charles  Nothing nothingOnly that you see me here a pitiful mean sorry fellow and that I have cheated you  Edward  You cheated me that cannot be have we not been acquainted with each other from our infancy And are we not both children of good friends and neighbours  Charles  Yes and that very circumstance Edward aggravates my guilt I do not deserve that you should think so generously of me    He takes Edward by the hand    It is however in my power to prove that I am not totally unworthy of your friendship In reality I have received no playthings or the like this Christmas from my father but    searching his pockets    here are three new guineas that I requested him to give me in their stead You see then I was only a deceiver while you acted towards me with such generosity but I repent and give you up the half In fact it is your own but if you have any pity in you pardon me my knavery and be still my friend  Edward    embracing him    Yes always while I live How you rejoice me Not however with your money as I shall not take it  SCENE IV  Archibald Charles Edward Veronica  Veronica  Archibald must come immediately to my papa  Archibald  O my dear young lady cannot he stay a little I shall lose the pleasure  Veronica  Yesof squeezing something from my brother but you have heard the message so come with me What you would have papa wait for you    She gets hold of his hand and pulls him along    Edward  Sister sister only a few minutes  Veronica    mocking him    Brother brother No I will have him with me    She goes out with Archibald    Edward    taking hold of Charles's hand    O my dear friend Charles how I rejoice while I am speaking I could have no right to hope for such sincerity of conduct from you  Charles  How When you bestow upon me half your things without expecting any in return from me  Edward  No no you must not thus applaud my generosity You cannot imagine how reluctantly at first I parted with this half and had it not been for the exhortation that Archibald gave me to so good a work I should not have kept my word after all  Charles  And to him I am indebted likewise for the satisfaction of not having quite compleated my unworthy tricking scheme He set the baseness of it in so full a light before me And when afterward I entered here and found with how much generosity you had proceeded in your distribution  Edward  In my distribution It is Archibald that has all the merit of it I cannot tell what happy art he has but to deprive myself of what I had beforehand so much cherished was a pleasure to me Yet there is something in your share that I added of myself  Charles  But you shall keep the whole for I will have nothing of it and am happy to get rid of such a burthen I should never have presumed to look you in the face I could not think how much one suffers by becoming a dishonest man  Edward  And how was I tormented also But at present I experience how much pleasure flows from generosity  All this is due to Archibald So necessitous and yet so upright Sure he could not claim a recompence for telling you my Christmasboxes  Charles  He my dear Edward What can cause you such a thought  Edward  My sister in her jealousy would fain have had me think so  Charles  Ah if you had heard how handsomely he spoke about you and espoused your interests in our conversation I had need of all my art and cunning to get from him what you had received And therefore henceforth he shall have what he has merited so well my friendship and I will give him the remaining half of my three guineas  Edward  No no Charles leave me to recompense him as I well know how and keep your money with the half that is yours of my Christmasboxes  Charles  What I keep it Never Look ye rather let us give him every thing that we should have shared between us We have well deserved to lose and he to have it  Edward  Yes with all my heart And do you know what you must do We have it in our power to please him very much I will order all these things upon the table to be carried to his mother's so that he may see them there the first time he goes home  Charles  Good good provided by the bye he does not return too soon and interrupt us  Edward  I will go fetch the servant In the mean time pack them up as quick as you are able in the basket I shall be back again immediately    He goes out    Charles    alone filling the basket    Oh the good good Archibald I cannot help thinking with myself how happy we shall make him and what is more too I shall have my part therein I would not give it up for all these pretty things Who could have persuaded me yesterday that I should enjoy more satisfaction in bestowing on another what had been so much the object of my wishes than in keeping it myself I wish I were papa to recompense him as he merits Thanks to his persuasion I am now convinced that to be just gives much more happiness than to possess great riches  Edward    returning with Clement    Come in Clement    He bolts the door    What we want you for is this to take the basket here before you on your shoulder and convey it to where Archibald's mother lives for Archibald  Clement  Oh with all my heart sir we are every one of us fond of that young man  Edward    to Charles    I hope you have almost finished  Charles  In a moment I have got in every thing except the china figures which I will put at top that they may not be broke  Edward  A good thought but make haste for fear of his return  Charles  There that is the last  Edward    to Clement    Now Clement you have nothing else to do than carry it this moment where you know Do not loiter by the way and take especial care of breaking any thing  Charles  Stay here is the guinea and a half that I said I would give him I will just wrap them up and put them with the fish and counters  Archibald    at the door without    Open open it is Archibald  Edward  Bless us what are we to do    coming towards the door    A moment friend and we'll admit you  Charles  Hark ye Clement here is the money slip it some how or other as you go into the basket  Edward    to Clement    He will suspect us so take up the basket and withdraw into a corner of the room here just behind the door till he has passed you  Charles  Yes close up against the wall and afterwards slip out without his seeing you  Clement  I understand you  Archibald    as before    Well Edward am I not to enter Your papa is coming  Edward    to Charles    I may open now  Charles  Yes yes all is done    The servant goes behind the door    Edward    opening to Archibald who comes in    I ask your pardon my good friend for keeping you so long without but we were busy    He takes his hand and places him in such a manner that he cannot see the servant without turning round    Archibald  Busy pray And at what    He turns and sees Charles making signs to the servant    Why all these signs    Perceiving the servant with the basket    Ah ha what has Clement got there in the basket    He goes up to Clement and attempts to look into the basket    Clement    preventing him    Softly softlyIt is a secret  Archibald  How a secret  Clement  You will know what it is when you get home  Archibald    keeping him from going out    No I will know this moment Is it possible that I can have guessed and would my dear friends then affront me so  Edward  Affront you It is a poor acknowledgment with which we pay those services that you have so lately done us    He offers him the basket    Yes dear Archibald all these things are yours  Charles    presenting him the money likewise which the servant has returned him    And this gold also    Archibald puts his hand aside Charles throws the money thus refused into the basket which Edward still offers to Archibald    Archibald  What are you about no never never  Edward  I  will  have it so  Charles  And I entreat it as a favour of you Be my friend as you have shown yourself Edward's  Clement  If  I  durst but add my prayer to that of these two gentlemen You will occasion them more pain than they deserve to suffer by refusing their request I wish I had it in my power to offer you my present as they have It would indeed be little but come wholly from my heart for all the family and every one that knows us loves you  Archibald  O my dearest Edward my kind Charles    he embraces them    and you my good Clement you draw tears of joy and admiration from me but your generous bosoms carry you too far I have not merited what you are doing for me and shall therefore never take it  Edward  You would wish to mortify me then And cruelly refuse my friendship  SCENE the last  Archibald Charles Edward Clement Mr Damer  Mr Damer    having entered some little time before unnoticed and stood still to be a witness of the conversation but advancing now as if he had heard nothing    Well shall I always find you sparring thus at one another  Edward  O papa let your authority determine our dispute for Archibald treats us very harshly He has made me faithful to my promise  Charles  He has brought me to preserve my honour  Edward  And now scorns us when we would be grateful  Archibald    throwing himself into Mr Damer's arms    O my worthy patron and my second father save me save me from their generosity I was so happy just this moment as to vindicate my conduct from the accusation thrown thereon and shall I now belie it No I should in that case justly be suspected of a mercenary disposition Let them not corrupt me I beseech you  Mr Damer  How you charm me my dear children No good Archibald these their presents are a very nothing when compared with so much delicacy and disinterestedness I will put an end to such an honourable contest    To Charles and Edward    Keep you each your own I will take it on me to evince your grateful natures  Edward  O papa of how much pleasure you deprive my heart  Charles  And how you punish me as very likely my behaviour merits but you are witness on the other hand to my repentance Condescend then to prevail on Archibald  Archibald    to Mr Damer    No for heaven's sake sir do not listen to him  Mr Damer  I  do  listen to him and  will  have you be compliant upon this occasion It would look too much like pride should you refuse him and besides it would be cruel to deprive him of the pleasure arising from a generous action Take this money then and send it to your mother who first taught you such a noble way of thinking  Archibald  You compel me to accept it sir and therefore I obey Oh how rejoiced she will be to have it but at least sir let Edward keep his presents  Mr Damer  Well then let him but to share them with his friend I will buy the whole again with these three guineas  Archibald  Ah my kind good benefactor put some limits to your generosity I do not know well what I am doing So much beyond all measure is my joy My poor dear mother it is a long while now since she has been so rich as I shall make herO my good good friends    He embraces Charles and afterwards Edward without power of speaking to them    Mr Damer  I owe you likewise a reward Edward for complying thus with Archibald's noble counsels  Edward  How can you reward me so much to my satisfaction papa as by what you have so recently done for him  Mr Damer  That is a very nothing Hitherto he has been only the companion of your pleasures but shall henceforth be the partner of your studies I will make no difference between you in respect to education  THE COMMODORE's RETURN  A DRAMA in ONE ACT  CHARACTERS  COMMODORE FREEPORT  MRS FREEPORT  MELISSA  their Children  CONSTANTINE  their Children  ARABELLA  their Children

Commodore  Young Men and Maids of the Village  SCENE  The garden of Commodore Freeport's country seat close by the sea side  SCENE I  Thomas Colin    While Thomas is raking one of the walks Colin runs in trembling and out of breath as in a fright he throws his arms round his father and clings fast to him    Thomas  WELL what now you little blockhead what now Where are you running in such a fluster  Colin  Ah father father I am frightened out of my wits I'm dead  Thomas  It is very lucky that you are able to tell me so But what is the matter  Colin  A ghost a ghost  Thomas  What in broad daylight I believe thou art gibing thy father Well what is it like a beast or a man  Colin  It isit is like a man  Thomas  Silly oaf why then it is a man Has it a mouth and eyes and hands and feet  Colin  Oh yes a mouth and eyes and hands and feet like one of us and yet it is not like  we  for all that  Thomas  What nonsense is all this  Colin  Oh if you had but seen it Bless the mask it is the ghost of a Turk  Thomas    a little frightened    The ghost of a Turk  Colin  Yes indeed father You shewed me some Turks when we were in London well it is the same for all the world A long gown down to his heels a yellow thing like a lady's muff upon his head a long carving knife by his side a great black beard and a dead man's face over his own    A noise is heard behind the hedge row    Oh there it is father there is the ghost the Turk Help murder    He runs out    Thomas    alarmed    Colin Colin won't you come back    Colin instead of returning runs away precipitately Thomas goes to follow him but his rake falling trips him up and while he is entangled with it Colin escapes    A little coward to leave me here all alone And then if what he said were true I do not like meddling with your Turks not I By the mass I will not stay here to meet with him    While he stoops to take up his rake Commodore Freeport dressed in a long red gown with a turban and a mask comes softly up to him and plucks him by the skirt Thomas turning about perceives him and attempts to run away but finding himself held fast he roars out    Help murder A ghost A Turk  SCENE II  Commodore Freeport Thomas  Com Fr    putting his hand on Thomas's mouth to silence him    Why Thomas do not act the child Don't you know me  Thomas    without looking at him    Avaunt none but Satan knows you I am none of your acquaintance  Com Fr  Oh I see what deceives you    He takes off his mask    Look at me now  Thomas    hiding his face with his hands    What I look at your terrible visage No let me go or I shall cry out ten times louder  Com Fr    trying to part his hands    What are you afraid of me  Thomas  Say no more You want to roast me Oh how hot you are  Com Fr    letting go his hands    Why Thomas are you mad Do not shake so man Can't you recollect my voice  Thomas  It is a main hollow ghostly voice that is certain  Com Fr  Only look at me between your fingers  Thomas  WellwellI willbut get a little farther off  Com Fr    drawing back    There now are you satisfied  Thomas    drawing back too    Are you a good way off Stop a while    Separates his hands a little and looks at him    Eh what the Commodore Is it you sir  Com Fr  Why yes Thomas it is I your master  Thomas    shewing his face a little more    Are you sure though that it is not his ghost  Com Fr  Nay Thomas I can hardly take you for the same man I did not think you had been so chickenhearted  Thomas    letting fall his hands and looking still at the Commodore    Oh yes now I see it is you    Taking off his hat and advancing towards him    Dear master I beg pardon for not knowing you at first It was my son a little blockhead that put all these frights into my head    Beginning to swagger    A ghost trusy Aye just as if I believed in ghostsBut after all your honour has got a huge ugly cap there For my part I think it is dangerous jesting with such outlandish gear Suppose one was to remain a Turk all one's life I remember as well as if it was yesterday my mother's telling me a hundred times how she saw one that had heard of a thing that happened in a family as long ago as any one couldOh it is all very true that I am telling you I assure you  Com Fr  Well come you shall tell me your story another time Is there nobody within hearing  Thom  Nobody sir for that silly boy of mine will hardly venture back He is afraid Ha ha ha Yet only mind master if you had been a ghost he would have let you twist his father's neck off  Com Fr  Are my wife and children all here Is the Tutor with them  Thomas  Oh certainly sir They staid in the country on purpose to prepare a revel against your return as they knew that you would come strait hither from Portsmouth How happy they will all be But what a blockhead am I not to go and tell them the news and then spread it all through the neighbourhood  Going  There will be rare doings  Com Fr  stopping him  Avast avast it is the very thing that I do not wish you to do at present  Thomas  How Won't your honour make one at the revel It is all on account of your honour's return and the whole neighbourhood will take part in the rejoicing  Com Fr  They are very kind  Thomas  By the mass they have good reason There is not a set of tenants in England happier under their landlord than your honour's are and they love you accordingly All the bells should have been ringing before now I wonder what the ringers are about  Com Fr  Thomas have a little patience I shall shew myself in proper time  Thomas  Proper time sir Alack it is easy talking but for my simple part I shall be out of patience if you are long about it  Com Fr  And I shall be out of patience if you are not a little more discreet Do not deprive me of the satisfaction that I promised myself at my return Would you by way of welcoming me home oblige me to discharge you  Thomas  Nay that is enough now I am dumb Yet I must say sir it was ill done of your honour to leave us in uncertainty so long We thought you were either drowned or taken prisoner You cannot think sir how dull it made us O dear master if we had lost you and been obliged to put on mourning instead of keeping a revel The very thought makes my blood run cold We would rather the war should have lasted ten years longer  Com Fr  I thank thee Thomas for this language of unaffected friendship It presages I hope a reception still more tender from my family  Thomas  Then sir why do not you come to them directly  Com Fr  No no I tell you my design is to double the pleasure of my return by an agreeable surprize Only let me speak with my children's tutor  Thomas  With Mr Ascham  Com Fr  Yes I wrote to him from Portsmouth to prepare him You and he shall be the only persons in the secret But hist I hear somebody coming down this next walk  He goes to hide himself behind the bedgerow  Snug's the word Thomas Be discreet  SCENE III  Thomas alone  Discreet quotha Aye it is easy to be discreet when one has nothing to talk of but when one knows as much as I knowThis secret I feel begins to swell me already  Turning he perceives Mr Ascham  Thank my stars they send me at least somebody to talk to  SCENE IV  Thomas Mr Ascham  Thomas  running towards him  Joy joy Mr Ascham The fleet is come the Commodore is come you are come and I am come  Flings up his hat for joy  Mr Asch  What is Mr Freeport here  Thomas  with an air of importance  Do you think he is not sir when I tell you so I am in the whole plot as well as you  SCENE V  Commodore Freeport Mr Ascham Thomas  Com Fr  My secret was well trusted I see Thomas I need only depend upon you at all times  He takes Mr Ascham's hand  My dear Ascham I am glad to see you once more  Mr Ascham  Sir this will be a day of festivity for us  Com Fr  Provided that Thomas do not disconcert all my plan with his silly joy and his chattering  Thomas  Nay look ye there did not your honour tell me that Mr Ascham was in the secret Did I blab the least word to any body in the world  Mr Asch  True because you saw nobody but me  Com Fr  Let us not lose a moment Thomas you must hide me in the greenhouse until the moment of making my appearance  Thomas  That I will and welcome and you will find it in good order I'll warrant  Com Fr  That is not all but you must plant your son on the watch to let me know when any body approaches  Thomas  But if Madam herself should take a walk towards the greenhouse or some of the young folks I could hardly hinder them from going in  Mr Ascham  Pshaw a man of your sense will easily find an excuse to prevent them  Thomas  Why aye sir as you say  Com Fr  Do not forget to let us have some good fruit Thomas  Thomas  Oh sir never fear I'll warrant your honour shall shew the finest melons and pineapples and every fruit of the season at your table today that is to be seen in this county  SCENE VI  Commodore Freeport Mr Ascham  Com Fr  Do you imagine Ascham that my wife suspects nothing of our preparations  Mr Ascham  It would have been impossible for me to conceal them from her I chose therefore to make them in concert with her while she supposed that she should surprize you agreeably with this revel at your return I told her that your cruize might perhaps continue longer She was happy therefore to amuse the wearisomeness of your absence by occupations that would shew you how her mind was employed during that time  Com Fr  Thus I shall be the giver of the entertainment with which she proposes to receive me My dear Ascham your contrivance charms me  Mr Ascham  I hope you will be pleased with our performance Indeed every one was eager to contribute to  your pleasure I have already instructed a few young men and maids amongst your tenants and they know their parts to admiration  Com Fr  And I have brought my future son in law Lieut Boardham who behaved so gallantly you remember during the war What recommended him to my notice was his attacking a pirate sloop in the EastIndies with no more than an armed boat and taking her These Turkish dresses were part of her spoils and we put them on for this frolic the better to disguise ourselves Oh I forgot to mention too that I have brought a band of music from Portsmouth I left them to refresh themselves at a public house close by our park here within a stone's throw of us  Mr Ascham  So much the better for we were but indifferently provided in that respect  Com Fr  I should be sorry that any thing were wanting to our festivity I would not have a single tenant of mine unconcerned in it I hope and flatter myself that they have reason to rejoice in my prosperity It has always been my endeavour to make those happy whom Providence has placed immediately under me both on board and ashore for he but half serves his country Ascham who fights her battles with success abroad but returns to be detested for injustice and oppression by his poor dependants at home  Mr Ascham  Excellent sentiments Commodore you are deservedly beloved by your tenants I can answer for so much without flattery and that your public service has been approved your reputation and your Sovereign's favour sufficiently testify  Com Fr  taking him by the hand  These my friend are the sources from which every man of spirit should seek to derive his happiness and satisfaction  Colin is seen approaching by the hedge row  SCENE VII  Commodore Freeport Mr Ascham Colin carrying a basket of flowers on his arm  Colin  This ghost of a Turk cannot be very illnatured How friendly he talks with Mr Ascham He is shaking hands with him  Mr Ascham  Don't I hear somebody  Com Fr  Yes I must go and hide  He turns to go behind the hedgerow and meets Colin full in the face who trembles and stares at him awhile but at length cries out in a transport of joy  Oh law it is his honour it is the Commodore  Com Fr  Come hither my little godson  Colin throws down his basket and runs eagerly up to him jumping for joy  Softly my man softly I do not wish any body to know that I am arrived Do not you tell for the world  Colin  What sir neither to madam nor the children  Mr Ascham  It is from them particularly that you must conceal it  SCENE VIII  Commodore Freeport Mr Ascham Thomas Colin  Thomas  enters without seeing Colin  Now every thing is ready for your honour  Colin  Well I am sure It was not I that told my father however  Thomas  perceiving Colin  Plague on it we are all ruined This monkey will go and blab I was thinking of sending him on a message a mile or two off  Mr Ascham  patting Colin on the head  Nay I dare say he will be as discreet as yourself Won't you my little friend  Colin  Oh never fear sir I can keep a secret as well as another It won't be the first time neither  Thomas  No when was the first time then  Colin  I 'fegs t'other day when you threshed me to make me tell whether I had stolen the apples off our tree at home Did I tell you it was I  Thomas  It was you then that stole my apples was it Stop a moment  Colin runs behind Commodore Freeport  Oh you shall pay for them  Mr Ascham  Agreed if he says a word about the Commodore  Com Fr  And if he holds his tongue a guinea for his reward  Thomas  Do you hear that Colin a guinea  Colin  Tut I would have held my tongue for nothing out of regard to my godfather  Com Fr  There is a good boy Well now for our concealment  Thomas  And you Colin stand here If any body comes up this walk as it leads no where but to the greenhouse run thither immediately and let his honour know But if you open your lips ware the apples I'll cut your ears off with the Commodore's cutlass there  They go out  SCENE IX  Colin gathering up his flowers and making a nosegay  If they know nothing unless from me they will not know much But the poor children Miss Arabella Master Constantine and Miss Matilda it grieves me to think they should not know that their papa is here Suppose I were just to whisper it to Miss Matilda she is very fond of me and though she is the youngest of them all she is the drollest little bodyAh but she would tell it to Miss Arabella and Miss Arabella to Master Constantine and Master Constantine to Gatty and Gatty to Miss Melissa and Miss Melissa to her mama and then every body would be in the secret There would be a guinea lost and my ears cut off Oh it is better pretend to be dumb In the first place if I do not speak I shall tell nobody any secrets that is plain  Clapping with his hand on his mouth  There you are locked up till tomorrow morning  SCENE X  Constantine Arabella Matilda Colin  Constantine  clapping Colin gently on the shoulder  Good morrow little Colly  Arabella  curtsying to him with affected solemnity  Mr Colin's most obedient humble servant  Matilda  taking him by the hand in a friendly manner  How do you do my little man  Colin hows to her and gives her a nosegay  Constantine  You are all alone  Colin answers him with a nod    Matilda  Mama wants to speak with your father Where is he  Colin points the way by which Thomas went out  Arabella  Are you making game of us Have you lost your tongue  Colin looks about him without answering  Constantine  Well but speak  Arabella  slapping him on the hands  Hah I'll teach you another sort of drollery  Matilda  holding Arabella  Softly sister Do not hurt my little Colin  Colin looks kindly at Matilda  Constantine  Let him speak or I'llWhat is he dumb  Arabella  Or deaf  Matilda  Perhaps something may have happened to him Is any thing the matter my little man    Colin makes signs in the negative    Upon this the other two children fall upon him shaking him pulling him pinching him and tickling him crying out all at once  You must speak you must speak you must speak or we will know the reason why  Matilda  Have done or I shall join him against you  Arabella  A fine champion truly he would have to defend him  Matilda  to Constantine  Brother you are the eldest make her have done pray do I will talk to him gently and perhaps I may get a word or two from him  Constantine  haughtily  No I insist he shall obey me when I order him  Matilda  Let me try what I can do  To Colin  Colin my good little Colin answer me if it be only one word  Colin smiles but makes signs that he is not to speak  Do you know now that I shall be angry with you tooBut no Arabella go and fetch his father mama wants him you know  Arabella  Yes yes I'll tell Thomas of it He will make him speak perhaps  As she is going Colin stands full in her way to stop her shaking his head  Constantine  with an air of authority  What does he dare to stop my sister Let me manage him  Matilda  holding Constantine  Why you see he does her no harmWell Colin go yourself and fetch your father tell him that mama wants him will you  Colin nods consent and goes out The children follow him with their eyes  SCENE XI  Constantine Arabella Matilda  Arab  He can hear at least if he cannot speak  Matilda  I knew I could make him do whatever I had a mind  Const  He did well to get away But I will make him pay for not obeying me  Matilda  seeing Thomas approach  Oh here comes Thomas We will know what is the matter with my little friend  SCENE XII  Constantine Arabella Matilda Thomas  All the Children run up to Thomas and jump about him  Thomas  Good morrow master Constantine Good morrow young ladies How do you do to day  Matilda  Oh very well very well but tell us what is the matter with your son poor little Colin  Thomas  The matter with him A good appetite that is always with him I think  Matilda  Then he is not sick  Thomas  He sick  Constantine  Then he is very obstinate  Arabella  The little monkey made game of us  Matilda  Ah how you talk  Thomas  What miss made game of you  Matilda  I was afraid he was struck dumb  Thomas  He dumb  Arabella  We pinched him and tickled him but not a word  Thomas  Is it possible why he bawled loud enough to deafen me here this morning and frighten me too I might have been afraid at least if I had not a good heart  Constantine  As for us he did not vouchsafe to honour us with a single word  Thomas  smiling  No a little knave only mind his cunning He has ten times more wit than his father  Matilda  Wit how in not speaking  Thomas  Where could he have hit upon such a thought  Arabella  What do you mean  Thomas  And then people will talk that the world is growing worse and worse By the mass children have at this time of day more sense than all their family  Arabella  For my part I believe they are both out of their senses The one did not speak at all and the other speaks without answering us  Thomas  Oh he knew very well what he did not sayâ–ª and I know very well what I do say  Arabella  That is more than we do  Thomas  Well there is no harm done But where is Madam Colin told me that she asked for me  Constantine  He told you  Matilda  Then he can speak  Constantine  Oh if he can speak I'll make him speak  Arabella  Let us go and find him  Thomas  Aye aye go He has walked into the park You will hardly come up with him He has a pair of legs if he has not a tongue  Constantine and Arabella go out  SCENE XIII  Matilda Thomas  Matilda  O dear Thomas pray tell Colin to speak a little if it were only for my sake I do so like to talk with him  Thomas  Yes yes let me manage I'll talk to him and he shall talk to you and we'll all talk to one another very soon Oh what talk we shall have  Matilda  That is charming I will run after my brother and sister and hinder them from teazing him  SCENE XIV  Thomas alone  I think I did right to send him a pretty way off These young ones would have mawled him so that he must have told his secret at last But did any one ever see such a cunning fetch Not to talk for fear of blabbing One could not have hit upon a more cunning scheme But here comes Madam with Miss Melissa Now for it friend Thomas  take care of yourself One man against two women and hampered with a secret besides It is hard odds  SCENE XV  Mrs Freeport Melissa Thomas  Mrs Fr  Well Thomas I must come to seek you myself I sent the children for you an hour ago  Thomas  Madam I was this moment coming to you  Mrs Fr  I wanted to speak with you about this Revel Mr Ascham has just now mentioned that it would be proper to have as it were a general rehearsal of it Perhaps it is to divert my uneasiness but he assures me that it cannot possibly be long before my husband returns This idea which seems to hasten his return still more  Thomas  He is perhaps not so far off as people think What would you say Madam  turning aside  Hist what were  you  going to say Thomas  Mrs Fr  Have you heard any news of him  Thomas  News Madam By the mass what I know is truer than news  aside  Where the plague is my tongue running  Mrs Fr  What would you say Thomas Explain yourself  Thomas  The matter is thisLookye you understand When I come from market I put the best leg foremost to get home not that I have so fine a woman to my wife Madam as you are neither nor so fine a daughter as Miss Melissa here  aside  Plague on it I'll turn it off some way  to them  Just so for all the world in a manner as a body may say the Commodore is galloping home here as fast as he can That is a clear case I  defer  it to you else  Mrs Fr  Ah when will that happy moment come that I may welcome him to my expecting arms  Thomas  Who knows how soon I will bestir myself however perhaps that will hasten him I wish every pull of my rake were a lash to his horse's sides I would not let the young Lieutenant lag behind neither Miss Melissa  Melissa smiles  Mrs Fr  Well it is very obliging of you Thomas  Thomas  Why Madam the truth is I am sorry to see you  melancholy You are like flowers  impelled  with the dew as the song says But hang tears the sun will come and dry up all sorrow presently Joy joy Madam here comes Mr Ascham he seems full of joy  SCENE XVI  Mrs Freeport Melissa Mr Ascham Thomas  Mr Ascham  All goes right Madam I have sent to assemble the young men and maids of the hamlet who are to figure in our pageant We are almost ready to begin I was very well pleased yesterday to see them all so orderly and so perfect in their parts and I hope the general rehearsal to day will amuse you if you do us the honour to be present at it  Mrs F  I shall certainly not deprive myself of so agreeable an entertainment I should otherwise pay an ill compliment to the obliging exertions of your zeal and friendship for our family  Mr Ascham  Madam I could not receive a more flattering reward But indeed my cares were already repaid in the thought of seconding your wishes and anticipating those of your husband  Mrs Fr  How I please myself with the idea of his surprize and satisfaction  Thomas  He won't perhaps be the most surprized in the company neither  Mr Ascham looks sternly at Thomas  Mrs Fr  What do you mean by that Thomas  Thomas  embarrassed  Why Madam with regardwith regard to that thereI think you will be as much surprized to see him return fresh and hearty full of health honour and joy Miss Melissa too will perhaps be surprized to see her young intended I'll lay my spade to one of your pins that she will blush like a rose Marry we shall all be surprized for so good a master as his honour is not a sight to be seen with indifference  Mr Ascham  I think Madam it would affect you in a pleasing manner to see the impatience with which all the neighbourhood waits his arrival At every step I meet some one or other who enquires eagerly for him I figure to myself a numerous family enquiring for their father their brother their son their husband What will be their joy when they see him returned  Mrs Fr  I can imagine their transports by my own But when will he return I shall shudder with apprehension until I behold him safe  Mr Ascham  What can give rise to your terrors This is not the season when thirst of glory might expose him to danger  Melissa  Ah mama do you remember those dismal days when we could not take up the newspaper without trembling when we dreaded to see his name in every list of killed and wounded  Mr Ascham  At present therefore indulge the sweets of hope The tranquility of peace leaves us no subject of inquietude  Mrs Fr  Ah sweet Peace many a mother many a wife blessed its return  Thomas  Aye and many a gardener Ah if you had seen a little of the world Madam as I have You would not think that I served during the German war Yes I servedin a garden There came some of those cursed Hussars In an hour's time there was not a single hedge left standing in all that part of the country Then the statues in our garden your Apollos your Jupiters and your Mercuries those they soon turned topsyturvy I should not have cared a straw for them but my poor melons my poor asparagus it grieved me to the heart to see them demolished And yet I was not the head gardener neither Now that I am gardener in chief only think if that was to happen I should throw myself head foremost into the drawwell But come a fig for those madcaps It is peace timenow huzza Come Mr Ascham we will go and settle this business  SCENE XVII  Mrs Freeport Melissa  Mrs Fr  Honest Thomas's chearfulness has enlivened me a little I find myself now much more at ease I feel nothing now but the pleasing throb of hope Yes Melissa my heart tells me we shall soon see them once more  Melissa  Alas mama I rise every day to indulge this flattering idea and every day it vanishes  Mrs Fr  Our murmurs against heaven are always unjust How did I curse the cruel war that snatched my husband from me Well peace was made he returned covered with laurels and admired by his countrymen whose commerce he protected at sea Shall we grudge another short absence in the service of his country He will come home when his presence is most necessary for the education of his children He will bring with him the person whom your choice and ours has destined to be your husband Ah my dear how many women in the world envy our lot  Melissa  True mama but for my part your kindness hitherto has rendered me so happy that I cannot support the least alteration in my happiness  Mrs Fr  Come to my arms my dear child and resume y  natural gaiety it becomes you so well Do not let us poison by an appearance of sorrow the satisfaction which these good people are going to feel while they make us the witnesses of their joy  SCENE XVIII  Mrs Freeport Melissa Constantine Arabella Matilda Matthews  Matilda  running up to her mother  Mama mama we are bringing you the good farmer Matthews  Arabella  following her  Here he is here he is  Farmer Matthews enters supporting himself with a stick in one hand and leaning the other upon Constantine When he perceives Mrs Freeport he endeavours to double his pace and totters Mrs Freeport and Melissa advance towards him  Constantine  Lean heavier on my shoulder do you won't hurt me  Melissa  Softly Mr Matthews  Mrs Fr  Take care you don't fall  Matthews  They came to assemble my children and all the young people of the hamlet Is the Commodore returned then I should never forgive myself if he was  Mrs Fr  No Mr Matthews we are still expecting him  Matthews  Ah so much the better Which way does he come tell me I have a good head still but my legs  fail me I should set out long before the rest to be up with them at the same time  Mrs Fr  How would you go to meet him weak as you are  Matthews  with vivacity  Would I He has all his lifetime hastened to meet my necessities dost think then madam that I would sit still and wait his coming I would sooner be carried by my children  Melissa  No Mr Matthews I am sure my papa would be angry if you exposed yourself to so much fatigue  Matthews  Why madam it is for my own sake as well as his The sight of him is necessary to me He is like the sun that chears my declining life  Mrs Fr  But friend Matthews at your age  Matthews  My age is the cause why I have more obligation to him than the young ones I know the Commodore madam longer than you do Many a time have I set him a riding upon this very stick He was not so big as master Constantine here when he began to be my benefactor I was poor then and he had no more than his pocketmoney Well he found means to relieve me out of many difficulties even with that It was in vain that I told him only half of my distress He could guess more than I could hide from him As soon as he came to his estate he made me a present of the cottage that I inhabit and let me some lands which are round about it but on so favourable a lease that I soon got above the world Thanks to his friendship I have been able to bring up all my children and to settle them easily in the world which as I have done through his means I count them as much his family as mine and love them the better on that score  Mrs Fr  You know his friendship for you continues still There are few of his letters in which he does not mention you  Matthews  overjoyed  Is it possible But I believe it and it is no more than he ought For why he has done good to a great many of his tenants he has rebuilt their cottages when thrown down by storms or burnt he has helped them in bad seasons he has forgiven them their rent Let them bless him let them love him let them revere him but I should be main vexed if I thought that  next to his family any body loved him better than I do I mean the same to you madam and to you also miss  The Children  jumping about him  And us too Mr Matthews don't you  Matthews  I must needs love you my dear little ones that are my benefactor's children And yet sometimes you make me angry  Matilda  We make you angry  Matthews  Yes you make yourselves too uneasy about me sometimes It looks as if I were so old so very old  Matilda  Oh no you are quite hearty still Hold I will dress you up like a beau Here is my nosegay I will stick it in your buttonhole  Arabella  I have a fine ribbon here Give me your hat and I will fix a cockade in it  Constantine  standing on tiptoes to reach his ear  The next time you come to the hall I'll have a glass of our best wine for you  Matthews  O sweet little creatures you are all  heart  like your father Come and let me kiss you Madam will you give me leave  Mrs Fr  Nay it gives me the highest pleasure Nothing can be more agreeable to my eyes than to see my children in the arms of an old man It is the picture of innocence and virtue    The children throw themselves into Matthews's arms who embraces and kisses them Musick is heard    Matthews  starting up briskly  What do I hear Can it be the Commodore  Melissa  Ah would to heaven it were  Mrs Fr  No farmer it is the young folks of the hamlet coming to amuse us with a rehearsal of their entertainment  Matthews  Oh then I'll see it I figured in these merrymakings formerly but now I could scarcely hobble to keep in sight of them Give me leave to go and place myself at the foot of this tree This very tree I planted when I was a child We were then much about the same age at present it is a good deal younger than I am  Mrs Fr  No Mr Matthews you shall sit down beside me  Melissa  Yes between us both  Matthews  I madam it is too great an honour Before all the folks too  Mrs Fr  I hope the folks will learn by our example to respect age and honesty Come farmer  Mrs Freeport and Melissa lead him towards a green bank and make him sit down betwixt them Arabella and Matilda settle his coat skirts and Constantine assists him to take a firm hold of his stick in order to support himself  Matthews  I wish my joy may let me live till I see the Commodore  The young men and maids enter on different sides and join in the middle After walking in procession round the stage two and two they file off before the bank on which Mrs Freeport is seated with Matthews and the children  RECITATIVE  By a young  VILLAGER  LET the soft pipe's melodious swell  In lively notes our jocund purpose tell  Let the sprightly tabor sound  To welcome home the brave  From perils of the distant wave  Safe return'd to English ground  AIR  FIRST STRAIN  a  VILLAGE MAIDEN  Full long the stern commands of War  Have sent our chiefs and warriors far  From Albion's plenteous shore  Now

From perils of the distant wave  Return'd to British ground  Let pipe and tabor's mingled swell  Our brave Commander's welcome tell  To list'ning hills around  The Chorus being ended the young men and maids join two and two and walk back in procession round Mrs Freeport c saluting her and scattering flowers as they pass  Mrs Fr  My dear friends how your joy affects me What would I not give at this moment to share it with my worthy husband  Matilda  Ah mama if he was here Eh Mr Matthews  Matthews  I do believe I should forget my rheumatism and dance for joy    Military music is heard The curtain rises and discovers Commodore Freeport and Lieutenant Boardham in Turkish dresses but unmasked Beside them stands Mr Ascham with Thomas Fanny and Colin The rear of the garden appears illuminated Groups of peasants are seen mixed with sailors in jackets and trowsers The children stare as struck with astonishment Constantine approaches first looks steadfastly at the Commodore for a while then knowing him he cries out  Oh it is my papa  Arabella and Matilda  following him  It is it is  Mrs Freeport Melissa and Matthews rise from the bank and besitating a moment run up to Commodore Freeport and Lieutenant Boardham whose Turkish habits drop off and shew them in their naval uniform Commodore Freeport  springs forward and embraces Mrs Freeport and Melissa by turns  Mrs Fr  My dear husband  Melissa  My father  The Children  pulling him by the skirt  O papa O papa it is our turn now  Com Fr  I would I could embrace you all at once Dear wife and my dear little ones  Mrs Fr  We are too good for loving you still after the trick you have played us But whence comes this disguise  Com Fr  presenting Lieut Boardham  There there is the gentleman that you are to scold for this whole adventure I give him up to your vengeance  Lieut Boardham salutes Mrs Freeport and Melissa  It was a smart action of his that first put us in possession of these clothes so that he is the original cause of our frolic I had a mind to shew him to you in his eastern spoils  Lieut Boardham  I hope every action of my life will make me still more worthy of this lady's favour  He kisses Melissa's hand  Com Fr  turning towards Matthews  But don't I see my good old friend here  He steps up to Matthews and takes him by the hand  Matthews  I could not speak I was so intoxicated with joy Now I have seen you my noble landlord I can die content  Com Fr  No my dear friend you shall live This day shall make you younger by ten years  To Mrs Freeport  My dear I thank you for the distinction that you have shewn him There is not in all this country an honester man and our family will never have a more worthy friend  He turns towards the other country people  And you my friends my children how rejoiced I am to see you once more I am fixed amongst you now probably for some years Let us all study to make each other mutually happy I shall look upon your happiness as a proof of your gratitude  All the Country People  Long live our noble landlord Long live our brave Commodore  Com Fr  And you too my friends long may you live happy and for that purpose let us be joyous I have received  your entertainment I will return you mine We shall not want for refreshment Every thing is prepared  Mr Ascham  We thought Madam to surprize the Commodore but he is more alert than we are  Thomas  I hope you will allow Sir that nobody could be more discreet than I was  Colin  Then what do you say of me father  Matilda  Ah you have found your tongue now at last  Fanny  You may all say what you will but I think mine has been the hardest part today for I have only this word to say and I am the last speaker of all  A general dance Commodore Freeport joins in it with all his family to the found of military music which is relieved at intervals by the pipe and taber After the dance all adjourn to tables which are spreed with refreshments of all forts in another part of the garden  WAR AND PEACE  Commodore Freeport still agitated with the pleasing sensations that he experienced during the course of the day could not close his eyes till long after midnight when at length a grateful slumber stole upon him and soft dreams composed his agitated bosom In the morning the first objects that he beheld about him were his children who had placed themselves around his bed in expectation of his waking He received their sweet caresses clasped them tenderly himself and putting on his clothes as quickly as he could went down into the garden with them  The serenity then reigning round about the pleasure of revisiting those places which his own hands had cultivated in times past and of being once again restored in safety to his family when such an interval of separation had elapsed and even the recollection of the dangers to which he had often been exposed every thing inspired him with unspeakable affection and his children sensible of this employed the opportunity to ask him question after question  He gave a relation of every thing worth knowing that had happened to him in his many and perilous voyages of the storms that had attacked his ships and the hazardous expeditions in which he was concerned He described to them the solitary uninhabited regions visited by his people and on the other hand the populous nations that he had seen together with their customs characters and manners  During his recital he was careful to remark what sort of feelings it excited in their hearts and what was the expression of those feelings on their countenances At the slightest mention of the dangers that he had encountered he felt the little girls by instinct as it were press tenderly to him they sighed and now and then let fall a tear while Constantine his son was animated and seemed ready or at least his features spoke him ready to encounter the same degree of danger In particular at the recital of any warlike action you might see his breast heave and his eyes sparkle like fire  Papa cried he at length if I were but as big as you how I should like to go to war that in my turn I might appear as brave a man as you  Com Fr  But Constantine you know not what a cruel wish you indulge now  Constant  Why papa do not you mean me for a soldier  Com Fr  Yes I do indeed  Constant  And is not the profession of a soldier necessary  Com Fr  Too much so I must confess It is with a kingdom just the same as with a human body Both are subject to interior maladies and outward accidents The physician watches the body carefully to prevent complaints within it which might happen through the fermentation of sharp humours or to save it from those ills that it might sustain from hurtful objects Just so likewise does the soldier watch the state of which he is a member to suppress seditions that might rise within it and repel the invasion of ambitious nations dwelling round about it  Constant  But papa if the profession of a soldier be so necessary ought not I to wish for opportunities of exercising it  Com Fr  What would you think of that physician who impressed with a desire of practising his art should wish a dangerous malady a plague for instance or something like it to befal his fellowcreatures  Constant  O papa how wicked  Com Fr  What then must I think of him who to gratify a principle of pride or ambition should desire to see the greatest scourge that can attend on human nature lay waste his country  Arabella  Ah Constantine think of that and let us see what you will answer  Constant  And yet war papa is quite delightful and particularly if one were a king  Com Fr  In what then do you think it so delightful  Constant  In the first place because then a king may make himself more powerful  Com Fr  Be it granted kings may have recourse to war with justice But when they wish to have more power do you imagine that in prudence they should do so that is go to war Suppose within yourselves dear children that the lands about my estate here were as many little empires and their owners Mr Marchmont and the rest as many kings within them  Arabella  Ay like those of France and England Do you understand  Constant  Don't be uneasy sister upon my account I understand extremely well Pray dear papa go on  Com Fr  If I prevail upon my tenants to take arms and if they can obtain possession of a field belonging as I said just now to Mr Marchmont is it not pretty likely that Mr Marchmont will give his tenants arms and beg them to defend that field which they must know is his and very possibly encourage them to seize on something that belongs to me  Matilda  Yes that is quite natural  Com Fr  If so then I am plunged into a sea of trouble and must always be upon the watch that I may rob my neighbour or prevent his robbing me Of which the consequence is this if I prosper I must reasonably fear that my neighbours will conspire together to impede my further violences and divide my spoils if I am beaten  Constant  Ay papa but then the glory that you would gain by letting all the neighbours see how brave you are  Com Fr  I understand you and to gain this glory which at best is but imaginary I shall go and hazard the repose and life of those whom I ought to regard as my children But it is very possible that my neighbour may be braver by a deal than I what then shall I have gained by this fantastic wish of glory  Constant  As I take it you should previously provide yourself with such a force as to be sure of conquest  Com Fr  I might still reply by hinting that my neighbour certainly would take the same advantages might possibly be more successful and so make my enterprising disposition cost me dear at last But for the sake of argument Constantine I will suppose that fortune favours me and my estate is much enlarged alas this very circumstance in all probability may become my ruin  Constant  How papa Methinks you would become the richer for it With a greater quantity of land you would have much more money coming in  Com Fr  Ah Constantine it is not on the size of an estate that its worth depends but on the care which one takes to cultivate it  Arabella  Certainly for only think of Wilsdonheath where Mr Bramble lives Why no one in his senses would give up the fourth part of such an orchard as we have for all that heath  Matilda  I easily believe you Wilsdonheath produces only furze and thorns while our orchard bears a deal of fruit  Constant  But what would hinder you from cultivating all the land that you might have taken from your neighbour  Com Fr  If I have before hand lost in the dispute a number of my tenants and a portion of the rest are still employed in arms who then will cultivate my fields I shall notwithstanding in the interval be obliged to feed those men who have forsaken agriculture and who instead of following it are occupied in laying waste the ground on which they tread Now to feed them I must put fresh burdens upon those that still remain employed in cultivating my estate and make them pay me largerrents  If I impose upon them they will leave their farms and chuse more kind and peaceful landlords than myself Of course I shall have none about me but armed tenants who if ever they conceive themselves ill treated will be likely to conspire against me  Constant  I have read indeed such things in history my tutor very lately I remember pointed one out to me  Com Fr  Let us now on the other hand suppose Constantine that instead of vexing any of the nations round me for I drop the idea of a landlord and speak as if I were the king of England and alluded to the king of France suppose I say that instead of vexing any of the king of France's subjects I should do my utmost to attach them to me by a commerce advantageous both to them and my own people and by being scrupulously careful to prevent whatever might oceasion for the time to come division and dispute between us and should give encouragement within my own dominions to the arts of agriculture so that every one of my subjects might enjoy if he thought fit the sweets of peace and that serenity which always flows from justice should I not be happier through the happiness of every one about me than from any boast of having conquered And in that case would not my dominion be established on a much more solid base than if I had enlarged its limits when the consequence must be that every part becomes much weaker  Constant  But papa do not you remember that you compared just now a kingdom to a human body If a human body then like mine grows stronger every day as it grows bigger sure a kingdom must become more powerful in proportion as its size increases  Com Fr  So it would do I confess if that increase were carried forward as it is in nature by a slow and gradual rate and not in consequence of sudden revolutions  Constant  Pray explain this last particular  Com Fr  I will make it clearly understood by what I saw take place between a little boy and girl on board the ship in which I came to England  Constant  What you saw take place between a little boy and girl I cannot conceive how any thing like that can be of use in settling this affair  Com Fr  One evening their mama gave each of them a piece of cake The girl was less a great deal than her  brother and had notwithstanding very near as large a piece The boy remarked that circumstance and snatched her share away Now what do you imagine led him to this action of injustice  Constant  I suppose he thought it wrong that his sister being less than he should have a piece almost as large  Matilda  Oh what a mighty man  Com Fr  Exactly such is the pretext assigned in general by all conquerors But what happened to the little boy When he had finished eating he grew sick The aliments that we swallow being meant to strengthen us it is very natural to fancy that the more we take the stronger we shall be so also it is not unnatural for a child to fancy that a prince whose territories are increased should find his power increased in proportion But in reality it is with a kingdom just as with our stomach Being overcharged it must be out of order If the little boy had been contented with the piece that he had received for you must know he was an ailing child and therefore had not so much as his sister who was very hearty it would have digested properly and strengthened him whereas by eating more than he could bear it had the effect upon him which I have just now mentioned If his sister following the example that he had set her had proceeded upon this to take away his bit of cake by force as little as she was he would not have had sufficient strength to save it from her  Constant  But perhaps he would have thought of the injustice that he had done and yielded it without a struggle  Com Fr  That is a generosity of which the common sort of conquerors are not capable to one another If they were but so in favour of their subjects only how could they reflect upon the multitude of victims which they must sacrifice upon the altar of their vengeance or ambition the first time they combat with the people whom they have made their enemies and not be struck with horror at the thought I should imagine it would be well if kings upon the point of undertaking any war should have a picture hung before them setting forth the horrors of that war so that their fancies might be incessantly affected with the idea of it and at midnight when all nature otherwise is still about them might hear the groans of  wounded men reproaching them as the occasion of those pains which they suffer the despairing cries of wives and mothers loading them with curses and the clamours of a people famishing for want of bread Their souls are sometimes wrought on by unjust solicitations to grant criminals their life and yet they sign without remorse what shall condemn to death even thousands of their unoffending subjects A good king employs whole years in meditating on a project that may finally prove beneficial to some portion of his state to population trade or agriculture Twenty years shall pass away before the project is perfected while a warlike that is cruel king shall by the resolution of a moment half exterminate his people put a stop to agriculture tie up the industrious hands of artizans deprive the poor of their subsistence by depriving them of daily work reduce whole families to dissolution and at last entirely overthrow his realm  Constant  And yet papa I have often heard that great fortunes are made by hundreds in the time of war  Com Fr  And this is an addition to the evils which it foments for not to speak of those antipathies which the inequality of wealth produces in the hearts of such as are each other's neighbours those enormous fortunes cherish a degree of luxury that cannot but corrupt men's manners to the last excess The pomp with which it is surrounded the enjoyment which it procures the shameful deference or respect which men dare not if they would refuse it stimulate the generality of those who are upon an equal footing in regard to rank with the luxurious but less wealthy to affect it with the same indecency that they may either satisfy their pride or keep up their respectability They waste their real wealth in keeping up their luxury that they may gain possession of that shadowy wealth which they fancy they  shall  get Intimidated by the dread of their approaching ruin if they do not hasten to prevent it by unlawful methods they embark in dangerous enterprises and expose not only their own property but whatever may be entrusted in their hands by others whom the hope of a fallacious profit will inveigle to be partners in their schemes Their ruin is at last announced but the example will not terrify cupidity which always hopes to prosper more than others by employing subtler artifices and as soon as probity is given up then  mutual trust is banished and a nation's commerce perishes through the excess of that abundance which it created  Constant  But if any land grows rich by peace should we not always have sufficient cause to fear the same misfortune  Com Fr  Not at all It is only suddenly made fortunes that intoxicate the minds of their possessors and excite them to abuse their wealth Fortunes gradually gained or in the ordinary course of commerce are in consequence of many years consumed in toil Men hardly ever dissipate the treasure which they have laboured hard to acquire but lay it by to serve them in the wearisome condition of old age besides their fortunes are in that case much more equable and every one is rich while no one overflows with wealth The country having far less wants in that serenity with which commerce blesses it is not under the necessity of grinding the laborious husbandman but on the contrary is able to encourage him in furnishing the trading part of the community with those supplies of corn and other fruits of the earth which it requiresAn empire strengthened thus by trade and agriculture may give laws to other empires even on account of its tranquillity Its neighbours fear it and instead of making inroads on a people who must be too powerful for them seek alliance with that people This alliance draws mankind together roots out national antipathies and kindles sentiments of unity and concord in their stead The prince has only to prevent abuses in the state A perfect legislation causes justice and strict order to prevail among his people and they pass from individuals to whole states Trade arts and sciences may be compared to bridges that extend from one to the other and on which not only Peace but Plenty constantly walk to and fro that they may keep inviolate the happiness of those whom they have united  Constant  I conceive your meaning pretty clearly yet in case there be no war then soldiers are unnecessary and my regiment must be broke before I join it  Com Fr  Not so fast Constantine for an undefended state would be exposed by reason of its riches to a multitude of enemies It should keep up a regulated force in peace if it would have one in the time of war But then instead of looking on an unconcerned spectator  while the military quench their spirit in debauchery and sloth it should assign them labours to keep up their strength and make them useful to the state They should be stationed on the public roads and such as are employed at present on them never quit the plow and sickle an additional connexion would in that case forcibly unite them to their country in that natural propensity which men feel to value what their industry in some sort has created and the pride with which they are at all times ready to defend it The superior officer who should direct their labours would not we must own observe his name recorded in the papers of the day and no where else for trifling enterprises such as history descends not to perpetuate but would himself engrave it on a pillar raised upon the spot where once ascended a high hill that he should have levelled on the side of a canal or post that he should have dug or at the opening of a bridge that he should have built The traveller then would come from the remotest part of Europe to consider the magnificence and boldness of his toil his countrymen would bless the benefits accruing from it and a generation not then born would in future time rise up and wonder at its durability The colour of his coat no longer would excite one thought of bloodshed but of gratitude so justly due to benefits and of respect invariably paid to the ingenious His leisure moments would be spent in the extension of those sciences which he had formerly studied and in suggesting plans of policy resulting from his observations made in different countries Retiring in the end to pass away the residue of life on his estate with honour in the recollection of those benefits which he had communicated to his country his activity would flourish still in agriculture I even dare propose myself as an example I am inclined to think that I have been serviceable to my king in India but shall much more boast of benefiting for the time to come my native land by cultivating the inheritance which a father left me and by giving you my children a becoming education I shall do my utmost to atone for any involuntary violence that I may have done humanity by being henceforth a protector of the needy round about me and I hope I shall not die without the conscious satisfaction which a good citizen enjoys in having carefully discharged his duty  Constant  What you say papa appears to me quite reasonable Then why do not all men think as you do  Com Fr  Why Constantine but because they have unfortunately been brought up in prejudices and not had sufficient resolution to correct them Hitherto philosophers have spoken to none but those whose understandings could not see the truth and beauty of those principles which I have happily been taught Nor is there any hope that men now come to years of reason and reflexion should be taught to see them so that those philosophers must get new pupils In infancy the future man must be prepared By giving him betimes a tincture of integrity beneficence and generosity he will obtain in his maturity the habit of displaying them in every action of his life and place his glory in contributing as far as he is able to that general revolution so much to be wished for in behalf of virtue A young prince possessed of these exalted notions and persuaded that the rising generation have them too might rationally hope to govern a new sort of people who would certainly afford a model to all other lands Congratulate yourselves dear children on the circumstance of being born in those auspicious times when children are not only here but universally throughout all Europe the peculiar objects whose felicity philosophers are studying to promote and not they only but even womenwomen notwithstanding narrowmindedness delights at all times to disparage as it does their understanding Perhaps for you and your contemporaries is reserved the happiness of seeing the last traces of injustice and barbarity effaced among mankind Thrice happy I myself if giving now these first ideas of a system of morality so simple but sublime I take but one step forward in the business of establishing this system in your hearts You will do all that you can to second my endeavours by communicating my instruction to your future children  EUPHRASIA  Euphrasia    to her doll    WELL Miss Obstinate you won't then I suppose do what I bid you you'll be always with your neck as stiff as if you were a  sentry  in St James's park Hold up your head and look at me See how I put my neckThereDon't you think that's charming O you're mighty dull this morning Tuke care Miss however and don't put me in a passion or depend upon it I shall be as angry with you as mama was yesterday with me for beating Pompey  Mrs Stepney    having heard a few of these last words    Why you seem quite serious Has your doll failed in her behaviour towards you  Euphrasia  I am showing her what airs and graces would become her and she wont even hear me  Mrs Stepney  I confess it cannot but displease one that such salutary counsel should be thrown away However you were speaking I believe of being angry  Euphrasia  O no no mama I was only finding faultbut very likely you heard every thing that I said  Mrs Stepney  Suppose me not to have heard a syllable now let me know what you were saying to her Is it possible that you can object to my knowing your little secrets  Euphrasia  No mama I cannot On the contrary I am sensible that young ladies should have no secrets between them and their mama  Mrs Stepney  Well said my little heart and therefore tell me word for word as well as you are able every thing that you said to your doll  Euphrasia  Well then mama she would not hold her head a little thus upon one side and I was telling her that if she refused to follow my directions I would be as angry with her as you were with me last night for beating Pompey  Mrs Stepney  You suppose then that I was angry with you  Euphrasia  I imagined when I saw you looking at me it was not as you were used to do and therefore I supposed so  Mrs Stepney  No it was not anger it was sadness In the first place I was sorry that you could have a heart to hurt your dog and in the next place I was apprehensive lest Pompey might avenge himself if you went on to strike him without mercy if you recollect I told you so and as you seemed to be so much offended at my admonitions I was fearful that you would show yourself quite disobedient in the end on which account I was so much afflicted that I could not but shed tears You saw me do so and therefore you supposed me in a passionIn a passionout upon the word I should have been then as faulty in respect to you as you were in respect to Pompey  Euphrasia  But you are not angry mama at what I told my doll  Mrs Stepney  Well not a word of being angry but respecting certain airs of coquetry that you wished to teach your doll and of which you even gave a pattern yourselfI should be glad to touch on that a little  Euphrusia  They set me off as I thought to advantage for Miss Humphreville not long since told me so  Mrs Stepney  I think I ought to know better than Miss Humphreville and I assure you I am not at all of her opinion  Euphrasia  Yet I practised something of that kind mama before my lookingglass last night and thought it became me mightily  Mrs Stepney  You imagine then that such twists and monkey tricks are worth the native grace of childhood it is plain you do not know to what they tend  Euphrasia  To what pray Tell me  Mrs Stepney  Why to nothing less Euphrasia than to make you give into the habit of an odious affectation and be as hypocritical in heart as in carriage  Euphrasia  Bless me is that true mama I am very glad then that I was drawn into this conversation on the subject as without it I should certainly have run the risque of falling into such a vice without intending it  Mrs Stepney  And I Euphrasia full of confidence in your ingenuous candor should probably not have perceived  it till the malady had made so great a progress as to render difficult the application of a proper remedy You see then of what consequence it is to pay no manner of attention to the instruction which children hardly more experienced than yourself may give but rather to consult  me  always when you want advice  Euphrasia  Yes yes mama I promise you I will since you will give me good instruction How should I feel hereafter were you to charge me with this vice of affectation as you know you have done with respect to other faults in company They have always been trifling faults and yet to be reproved in public for them shamed me but for affectationOh I verily believe to be accused of that would kill me with confusion  Mrs Stepney  I have sometimes been obliged to take this method of public accusation that the lesson I designed you might impress itself more deeply butbelieve me we may strike a plan out that will save you for the time to come all such humiliation  Euphrasia  Ah mama how good you are I shall be glad to have it  Mrs Stepney  Then the plan is to obey me at the slightest nod that I give when any thing is to be done or left undone You will do well to think within yourself and find out if you can the reason of my prohibition or command but if you cannot find it out be obedient neverthelesess and the first time that we are alone come then and ask me I shall very willingly explain my reason  Euphrasia  Ah mama your plan is indeed a very clever one and I shall save myself a deal of care by following it  Persuaded of the wisdom of this plan Euphrasia never ventured for the future upon any the least doubtful action without first consulting her mama She came at last to understand the slightest token from her and could tell what was proper for her to do in circumstances of embarrassment The tender admonition of the mother and her own reflexions gradu  l  y gave her an experience far above her age and all who knew her were as much surprized as captivated with the prudence of her conduct and the ripeness of her understanding At the age of  twelve she was possessed of all the happiness to be enjoyed on earth the inward satisfaction of her own approving heart the attachment of her friends and the affection of her parents  THE PRUDENT OFFICER  COLONEL Ormsby who by his merit had attained to that high rank observed with great concern that the officers belonging to his regiment gave their time and faculties entirely up to play Intent upon their reformation he invited them one day to dine with him and having brought the conversation round to such a point that gaming might be naturally introduced he gave them the subjoined short narrative of his own life  I was no sooner come from college than my parents bought me an Ensigney then vacant in the regiment which I have now the honour to command The love that I had contracted in my infancy for study made them hope to see me equally desirous of discharging the duties of my new condition and of attaining the reputation at which in the confidence of their hope they destined me one day to arrive For some few months I acted so as not to disappoint their expectations but soon after the pernicious model set before me by my brother officers together with their persuasions having drawn me in to make one with them at their meetings the insatiate demon  Play  obtained such strong possession of my heart that every duty which hindered me from gratifying this new passion soon became int  lerable I could hardly bring myself to quit the gaming table for an hour however I might stand in need of rest In sleep I dreamed of heaps of good and silver I was always shuffling cards and a continual noise of dice was in my ear  The natural necessity of eating was become my punishment I swallowed up my meat in haste that I might be as little absent from my gambling partners as I could  The beauteous mornings of the spring the charming evenings of the summer the voluptuous calmness of Autumnal weather every thing in short most capable of pleasing the imagination when it contemplates nature was to me entirely lost even friendship had no further place within me I was only in the company of gamesters The idea of my parents was grown painful to me and if ever I reflected upon God it was in blasphemies poured out against his ho  y name  At first I must acknowledge fortune was particularly favourable to me which had so bewildered and debased my understanding as to make me often spread my winnings on the ground and lie upon them that all those who knew me might assert with truth and in the litteral sense of the expression that I was used to roll on gold  For three whole years my life passed on in these unworthy occupations It is impossible for me at present to remember them without blushing at the stain which they have reflected on my honour and if possible I would efface them now by giving up a half of the remaining days that I have to live But how shall I presume to mention an excess more frightful still of which no worthy conduct will remove the blot even after twenty years all passed in probity and honour Judge my friends how anxious I must be to render my deplorable example useful to you by the pain which I am content to suffer when I thus submit to so humiliating a confession  I was once upon a time commanded to go out with a recruiting party but alas resigned the business of it to my serjeant while I followed my unhappy passion Two days afterwards he brought me twenty men to have their bounty money paid them I had lost the night before not only every thing that I possessed in the world myself but likewise the whole sum delivered me for this recruiting service Think then gentlemen what must have been my sorrow and despair in such a situation I dispatched that moment an express to where our regiment lay in quarters and ingenuously confessing my misconduct begged a brother officer to lend me what I wanted  How replied that officer give up so great a sum of money to a professed gambler No if I must either lose  my property or give up my connection with a man whose conduct makes his friendship infamous I chuse to keep my property  Immediately on reading this insulting answer I was utterly beside myself and still remember as what happened yesterday the dreadful images which all at once came crowding into my imagination on the one hand the distress and indignation of my father the dishonour that I was fixing on my family as well as on every one that knew me and the dread of being broke with infamy on the other hand the briliant prospect of that promotion which I might have obtained by an honourable conduct in my post nor did I afterwards recover the possession of my understanding but to think of perpetrating a new crime that I might be delivered from that ignominy which my first would bring upon me I was ready to go through with such a desperate resolution when I saw the very officer come into my apartment whose reply had hurried me as I have said just now into this state of madness  In the first emotion of my rage I fell upon him like a fiend but he disarmed me very quickly and while I but little thought of what was to ensue embraced me and began as follows "I replied a little harshly to your letter as I meant by such an answer that you should see the horror of that situation into which your rashness has pecipitated you and I perceive what effect it has upon you Now therefore that you repent my property my life and every thing that I have you may command as you think proper"  "Here" continued he and threw his purse upon the table "here is what will serve to pay your new recruits and the remainder may supply you at the gamingtable if you mean to return thither"  Return to the gamingtable Never never answered I and clasped him to my heart  Since which I have precisely kept my word From that day forward I determined to have done with all expensive pleasures and apply my savings to the purpose of repaying what my generous friend had lent me I employed my leisure time in study My attention to the service recommended me to my superiors and to such a happy  lution in the course of my affairs I am indebted for the honour of my present station in the army  This recital made so powerful an impression on his officers that every game of hazard ceased among them and a noble emulation to arrive at useful knowledge quenched that low ambition of winning money which was their ruling passion before Such was the good consequence resulting from their prudent colonel's lesson  THE PRODIGAL DOUBLY PUNISHED  A Worthy private gentleman observing with concern his only son upon the point of taking to a spendthrift way of living let him do as he thought proper and it was not long before the son had run himself behind hand to a great amount I will pay whatever debt you may contract said the father to him as my honour is much dearer to me than my money but take notice of what follows You love joyous living and I love the poor I have given away in charity a great deal less than I was used to do before I thought of your establishment I will think no longer of it a libertine should never marry so indulge yourself as much as you think proper but on this condition I declare that when at any time you spend beyond the money which I allow you to keep yourself as a gentleman some hospital or other charitable institution shall receive from me as much as you require to satisfy your debts and I will begin this very day Accordingly the money was that moment ordered to a certain charity and thus the youth on being doubly punished for his prodigality was quickly cured of a disease which otherwise would have insured his ruin  THE LITTLE GAMBLERS  A DRAMA in ONE ACT  CHARACTERS  Mr FLETCHER  HONORIA  his Daughter  AUGUSTINE  his Son  JONATHAN  Augustine's Neighbour  ALBERT  his Friend  RICH  VYSE  CRIB  Gamblers  The  SCENE  is in the garden of Mr Fletcher during the first act in one part after which it changes to another part  SCENE I  Jonathan Albert  Albert  WHAT have you to do at Augustine's then  Jonathan  I want to have a little conversation with him Albert and you know him likewise  Albert  Yes by sight You have not always been so intimate I fancy as you are at present  Jonathan  Not before my father took a lodging here adjoining his apartments We see one another often now and last night were together for an hour or two at cards  Albert  I think of late you talk of nothing else but cards and I have seen you frequently along with Rich and Vyse of whom I cannot say any good  Jonathan  You know them but too well and would to heaven that I had never seen them  Albert  Is it so But you may break off their acquaintance when you please  Jonathan  That is not at present in my power Would you betray me if I told you something  Albert  We have long been friends and would you fear to trust me Jonathan  Jonathan  O my dear good Albert they have made me miserable and engaged me to do things for which my father would renounce me if he knew them I have not a moment's peace  Albert  Alas what are they  Jonathan  Yesterday they got me to go with them to a place where one  Crib  waited for them We sat down to play and I lost all I had  Albert  They cheated you no doubt But still there is no great mischief done for never play again and then your loss will be a gain  Jonathan  But this is not the whole As I had no more money and still wanted to win back my loss I still played on and in the end they got possession of my watch my coat and waistcoat buttons buckles and in short of every thing that I had worth selling I owe Crib a guinea likewise and he will tell my father if I cannot find means to pay him today  Albert  There is but one thing that you can do Confess the whole directly to your father I am sure he will pardon you on your repentance  Jonathan  Never never  Albert  What will you do then  Jonathan  I dare not tell you  Albert  Let me know it  Jonathan  I communicated my distress to Rich and Vyse and they advised a scheme to extricate me  Albert  A fine scheme no doubt  Jonathan  It is not certainly the fairest as you will say but what am I at liberty to doâ–ª I have already introduced them to young Augustine He has money  Albert  Well you do not intend to rob him surely  Jonathan  Heaven forbid They only mean to serve him just as Crib served me and then we are to share the winnings so that I may pay my debt  Albert  And so because you have been pillaged yourself you would assist them to defraud your friend too But how know you that Augustine will not win  Jonathan  Oh no he plays quite fair  Albert  And you like a sharper  Jonathan  Like a sharper  Albert  No I am sensible that you play as fair as Augustine and therefore you lost Now as I hope you always mean to play so how can you be sure of winning  Jonathan  I do not know how it is but they inform me that they have certain ways by which they are sure of winning  Albert  Ways They are knavish tricks and would you use them I am not rich and yet I would not mend my fortune by your certain ways I am even sorry that you have told me your intention  Jonathan  My dear Albert have compassion on me and I promise  Albert  Promise What can bring me to assist in your deception  Jonathan  No I mean to say that if I am but so lucky as to pay this odious Crib I will break off all connexion with him and his friends and never touch a card again If I should break this promise you shall be at liberty to tell my father every thing    Albert shakes his head    Yes every thing And then it will not rest with me to cheat I cannot if I would and Crib has taken that upon himself I shall but play my cards they have promised that I shall be no loser but divide the profit with them  Albert  Well I will make a party with you  Jonathan  I desire no better and will instantly invite young Augustine for the afternoon His father is at present in the country and will not come back perhaps these three weeks  Albert  Quite convenient But take notice if yourself should cheat him  Jonathan  Do not talk so I wish I had not told youthe affair  Albert  And so do I I should not then be answerable for it  Jonathan  Answerable  Albert  To my conscience surely I can see a worthy youth on the point of being cheated  Jonathan  But you will not cheat him  Albert  Jonathan if you saw a thief pick even a stranger's pocket ought you to keep silence  Jonathan  Augustine will but lose two three or possibly four guineas and be cured of playing  Albert  Just as you are cured But here comes Augustine I see  SCENE II  Jonathan Albert Augustine  Augustine  Good morrow to you both  Albert  Good morrow Augustine  Jonathan  What you have not been down yet into the garden when it is such fine weather  Albert  Mr Augustine does not like to run about as you do and can entertain himself in his apartment  Augustine  Yes but I have been already walking in the garden and even breakfasted with Honoria and my father in the grove  Jonathan    surprized    Is he returned so soon I fancy you are not well pleased at that  Augustine  Not well pleased when he has been three weeks away  Jonathan  I love my parents well enough and yet if they should take it in their heads to travel it would not vex me  Augustine  And for my part I could wish my father never out of fight he is so extremely kind  Jonathan  And mine so harsh I must not think of pleasure when he is near me  Albert  Who can tell what pleasures you expect  Augustine  I thought you were in want of nothing on that head Since we have lodged together I have almost every day observed you at the door and when I have met you in the garden never could I see you under any thing appearing like restraint  Jonathan  No no I have always met you on days when my father dined abroad and that is the only time that I have to use as I think proper therefore I do turn it to account But now your father is come home I take it we shall not see you quite so often in an evening  Augustine  Why not Jonathan He refuses me no pleasure that I can ask However I must say I find no company like his and he too has frequently said that he thinks my company and Honoria's quite delightful  Jonathan  What a charming father So then he permits you to go out both when and where you like  Augustine  He does because I always tell him where I am going  Albert  And because he knows that you never go but where you tell him  Jonathan  What then do you do for entertainment when you are both together  Augustine  In the summer evenings frequently we take a walk  Jonathan  In winter  Augustine  We sit down before the fire and talk of fifty curious matters or I study geography and take a lesson in the mathematics Sometimes too with Honoria and a friend or two we act a little drama of some kind or other You cannot think how that amuses us  Jonathan  But sure such different studies are enough to crack your brain  Augustine  On the contrary they come of course as if they were an amusement  Jonathan  A game at cards I should suppose much more amusing Do you ever play  Augustine  Yes truly and my father frequently makes one  Jonathan  And do you play for money  Augustine  Doubtless but a trifle just enough to interest one in the game and particularly as by that my father says one learns to lose with temper  Albert  That is quite right one ought to husband as they say one's purse  Augustine  Oh do not imagine that I want money I have more than I can use  Jonathan  How much  Augustine  A crown a week  Jonathan  A good allowance truly And all that to purchase trifles  Augustine  Yes such trifles as my father would not like to have me trouble him about and that I must acknowledge makes me much more careful  Albert  I believe so One can hardly chuse but know the worth of things when one must pay for them one's self  Augustine  True Albert And besides one naturally saves in that case as I myself have found it so that what  with presents and some other matters I have now five guineas in my pocket without reckoning silver  Jonathan  Such a deal And how can you employ it  Augustine  Have I nothing then to buy However I can dispose of it otherwise I pay to have our footman's daughter put to school and every Monday morning send a trifle to a writingmaster that I had once and who is now grown blind these both together make up something and I keep the rest for ordinary uses and among them for play  Jonathan  At which you are tolerably lucky You remember you won half a crown of me the other night at  Oneandthirty  Augustine  I was sorry as I always am to win of friends  Jonathan  Then you shall have an opportunity at night of losing if you think fit Are you engaged  Augustine  No I shall stay at home My father is to draw out a petition for a widow woman who would get into an almshouse  Jonathan  That is well and mine goes out at five Come then to me and I will endeavour to amuse you We shall have Rich Vyse and Crib  Augustine  I will run and ask my father's leave Shall you be here when I return  Jonathan  No I must go and give them notice of the party but your answer Mr Albert will bring to me  SCENE III  Albert Augustine  Augustine  Will you go in with me Mr Albert I am sure my father will be very glad to see you he has often told me what a great esteem he has conceived this long while for you  Albert  I am very happy in his partiality The esteem of such a gentleman is highly honourable but at present I am rather indisposed and shall remain with your permission in the garden  Augustine  Do a turn or two will settle you and I shall not be absent long  SCENE IV  Albert musing  I do not know what to do in this affair Poor Jonathan is afflicted I should like to extricate him but then to let the worthy Augustine be cheated No the accomplice is not better than the robber and to favour roguery is just as bad as doing it I will go therefore and tell the whole But softly here comes Honoria Let me first of all do every thing in my power to assist her in preserving Augustine from the danger and yet not betray my friend  SCENE V  Albert Honoria  Honoria  What you here Mr Albert and alone I thought I saw my brother talking with you  Albert  He has just now left me  Honoria  I should wish him never to leave you if his company were but agreeable to you I should not be uneasy then  Albert  You do me honour miss but surely Mr Augustine is too sensible to give you any pain  Honoria  I have no pain while he keeps company with such as you but shall I come directly to the point I do not think any good of those companions of Jonathan's and he wants by all means to mix with them  Albert  I have not yet perceived that their company has hurt him  Honoria  True but my poor brother I must say is innocent and somewhat credulous he judges every one to be like himself What would become of him if those whom he thinks his friends were what they should not be I have remarked that you do not much approve of Jonathan's intimates  Albert  To say the truth my dear young lady I should rather wish that Jonathan would be satisfied with Augustine's friendship There is one advantage notwithstanding that his father watches over him as yours does over Augustine and instructs him what to do  Honoria  The mischief often is remarked too late it is easier to prevent than cure it  Albert  I am sure you love your brother tenderly and therefore hear me but tell nobody that I mentioned what I am going now to say Young Jonathan has prevailed upon him just before you entered to make one with him and his three intimates They mean to play no doubt but do your utmost to divert your brother from partaking with them I designed to wait here for his answer but do not think it proper that I should carry it I make no doubt but he will bring it presently Pray do not judge amiss of me that I retire and think of the advice which my duty as a friend to Augustine bade me give you  SCENE VI  Honoria alone  As a friend This looks a little serious Ah my poor dear brother should it chance that you who are at present all the joy and consolation of my father were to change and be the cause of his affliction for the time to come  SCENE VII  Augustine Honoria  Augustine  My father's friends are willing I can see to take the earliest opportunity of paying him their compliments on his arrival just as if he had been absent for a twelvemonth I could hardly thrust a word in  Honoria  You had something then of consequence to tell him  Augustine  Of the greatest consequence to me I want to pass the evening with my friends  Honoria  With Mr Jonathan no doubt  Augustine  Yes  Honoria  I thought so You might easily have guessed however that such a friend as Jonathan does not please me  Augustine  Truly Jonathan is greatly to be pitied being so unfortunate as not to have a place in your  good graces And what should he be to merit such an honour  Honoria  He should bejust such a one as you are  Augustine  Do you mean to joke  Honoria  No I am very serious I assure you and consider you a very amiable young man without a fault unless indeed it be the want of due politeness to your sister  Augustine  And why so because that sister is a little critic and pretends to greater understanding than her brother  Honoria  Truly I had quite forgot to mention modesty when I was drawing up your panegyric  Augustine  But what means this prating and pray tell me why these intimations with regard to Jonathan Do you know him  Honoria  I would know him by his actions  Augustine  Are you always with him to remark them  Honoria  I can guess them from the company that he keeps  Augustine  I understand you perfectly his company displeases you because I am one of his acquaintance  Honoria  Surely brother he must have acquaintances of longer standing than yourself and I speak of them as I would of good for nothing fellows  Augustine  Good for nothing fellows  Honoria  Yes that play and practise each dishonourable trick to win their adversary's money and then spend it more dishonourably still  Augustine  Oh what two great crimes they play when they are together and they spend their winnings as they please We do the same I fancy And besides you say they play to win but they have often lost to me  Honoria  Yes yes they have lost their copper and have won your silver  Augustine  Well and if they have the loss was mine not yours But this is just like what my sister is She would be sorry if she could not vex me in my pleasures notwithstanding I do every thing to heighten hers  Honoria    taking him by the hand    No brother every pleasure that you can have is also mine but for the world I would not have your pleasures hurt you and  deprive me of the satisfaction which I receive from loving you  Augustine  I know indeed that you love me but am hurt to find you fancy me incapable to guide myself  Honoria  And yet you would not be the first thatbut here comes my father  SCENE VIII  Honoria Augustine Mr Fletcher  Mr Fletcher  My dear children I have just now been enjoying a delightful satisfaction  Honoria  That of being visited on your return by your acquaintance I suppose you mean But certainly your friends must cherish you when we who are restrained by your authority rejoice as much as they can do  Augustine  Yes truly for without you we can find no pleasure  Mr Fletcher  And yet you must learn to do without me since according to the ordinary course of nature I shall certainly go first  Honoria  O sir would you afflict us at a time when we thought of nothing but rejoicing  Augustine  Yes sir you will live and long we hope for our advantage But let us talk no more on such a gloomy subjectI have a little favour to request  Mr Fletcher  Well come let us hear it  Augustine  Master Jonathanyou are acquainted with his fatherWell he has invited me to spend the evening with him  Mr Fletcher  You have a new acquaintance then I am glad that you pick up such good company so near you  Honoria  You hear that good company  Augustine  I think him so I have already sat down with him several times and he has introduced me also to some friends of his  Honoria  Good company too I suppose  Augustine  Yes for sure I must know them better than you  Mr Fletcher  When I used the words  good company  I meant discreet and well bred  Augustine  Yes sir extremely so  Honoria  And how are you to know that they are such as you have only seen them once or twice  Augustine  But have I not been hours together with them  Mr Fletcher  How did your acquaintance begin  Honoria  At play  Augustine  And why not so My father lets me play  Mr Fletcher  It is true for recreation and for such a sum as being gained will not induce the immoderate love of money or if lost not put one out of temper and this likewise at a time when nothing can be done more profitable  Honoria  But I thought sir something might be always done more profitable  Augustine  Yes I speak of myself for instance if I could but nail my thoughts continually to some book or other  Mr Fletcher  Honoria's remark is not amiss One may employ a leisure evening better than at play no doubt if people would be always rational or even innocently mirthful but as scandal sometimes will go round or folly in such case you know I bid you play and often take a part myself  Honoria  And these I doubt not brother are the reasons why you play  Augustine  I do not see any right that you have to catechize me  Mr Fletcher  But why take offence at what she says through friendship  Augustine  Rather sir from a desire to hurt me in your thoughts  Mr Fletcher  Can you conceive such notions of your sister  Honoria    with a tone of tenderness    Brother  Augustine    with the same tone    Honoria pardon me I am in the wrong to tax you thus but grant however your insinuations unavoidably must hurt me  Mr Fletcher  Her suspicions may have some foundation that does not reflect upon you we need not fear I think our dispositions towards each other so united as we are    Honoria and Augustine take their father by the hand    Honoria  O sir how good you are  Augustine  You lay by all a father's rights and are our friend  Mr Fletcher  If I were any other than your friend I should not be compleatly qualified to bring you up I might perhaps connive at your neglecting outward ceremonies of respect but not your failure in that confidence which I expect from your affection You should not have a secret that you would keep hid from me as whenever you may chance to be in danger my experience may preserve you from it Let me therefore ask you Honoria what are the objections that you have formed against your brother's new acquaintances  Honoria  They are always taken up with cards  Augustine  Who told you so  Honoria  No matter from whom I have my information the thing is whether it be true  Mr Fletcher  I have already told you what I think of playing every thing depends upon the game that you play  Augustine  Oh it needs no great attention it is the game of  one and thirty  Mr Fletcher  I confess I do not approve it much  Augustine  Why not There can be nothing in the world so innocent Whoever is one and thirty or the nearest to it wins  Mr Fletcher  And do you know that it is what we call a game of chance  Augustine  Because one has a chance to win or lose and must not this be said of every game  Mr Fletcher  With this material difference that at  one and thirty  chance alone decides whereas in many others skill is to be shown In short one wants but fingers and no head for games of chance and in my thought such games are utterly unworthy of a thinking man  Honoria  They cannot even amuse one  Augustine  Do not say so dear sister There is a deal of pleasure in expecting such or such a card as one may want  Mr Fletcher  Because the love of money makes it so And as this love of money operates very powerfully it is a strong temptation for ten thousand rogues to follow gaming as a trade and therefore unsuspecting people generally are their dupes  Augustine  Do you believe so sir but how  Honoria  I fancy they must have some art or other to arrange the pack in such a way as to obtain what cards they want  Mr Fletcher  Yes that is in reality their secret I cannot tell their method but am certain that they do employ some method and have seen deplorable examples of it in my travels  Augustine  Oh pray tell us what examples  Mr Fletcher  With a deal of pleasure When at Spa I was acquainted with a young gentleman who lost one night above twelve thousand pounds which was his all  Honoria  His all poor youth and what did he do to live  Augustine  He must have been beside himself  Mr Fletcher  Despair obtained possession of his features when he saw his fortune thus irretrievably lost He looked so frightful that I was forced to turn away my sight he gnashed his teeth plucked up his hair by handfuls and beat violently on his breast he gasped and panted like a dying man and left the room quite mad  Augustine  And pray sir among those who won his money was there no one who would give it back as I should certainly have done  Mr Fletcher  They kept their seats and still continued playing on or if they turned off their attention from the cards it was to look upon him with contempt  Honoria  The wicked wretches  Mr Fletcher  But the worst part of the story is as follows That this poor young man destroyed himself before the morning  Honoria  Oh how shocking  Augustine  Dreadful and from henceforth sir I will never touch a card I promise you I'll run and tell this Jonathan  Mr Fletcher  Softly softly you are always much too hasty in your resolutions One should never wholly give a pleasure up because when carried to excess it may be hurtful I have often told you that a game at cards when friends are met together is amusing innocent and even useful  Honoria  Useful sir  Mr Fletcher  Yes useful as it teaches us to bear our fortune and not to triumph when we win or be dejected at our little losses  Augustine  Heaven be praised I am not so fond of money as to hurt another by my insults in good fortune or to shew that I am hurt myself by being vexed when I am unlucky but to shun what possibly might happen it will be better for me not to visit either Jonathan or his friends  Mr Fletcher  You would only prove your weakness if this should be your final resolution for at least you have it in your power when with them to refrain from playing  Augustine  Oh I know them they would absolutely make me play  Mr Fletcher  Well play as much as they would have you since by that means you will gain a better knowledge of them But instead of going to this Jonathan or his friends invite them hither You may also tell them that Honoria perhaps will make one  Honoria  But sir  Mr Fletcher  Yes yes I have a reason  Honoria  But suppose they win my money  Mr Fletcher  You shall have it all from me again And tell them Augustine that you expect a friend whom you will prevail on to sit down and play amongst them  Augustine  But you know sir I expect no friend  Mr Fletcher  When I inform you of a friend that you have at home who will be with you cannot you guess what friend I mean  Honoria  Sly Why sure you understand papa he means himself  Mr Fletcher  Yes Augustine for you recollect just now you said that I  was  your friend  Augustine  Oh yes they will play indeed if you are of the party  Mr Fletcher  Therefore you shall not inform them who the friend is that you expect As soon as I have finished my petition I will return and join you I shall see what is proper to be done 'Till then play with them and at any game they chuse  Augustine  So then you would have me run to Jonathan and his friends  Mr Fletcher  Yes yes and do not forget to desire Albert's company I shall be glad to see him All his masters praise him wonderfully and you yourself have frequently been lavish in his commendations  Honoria  He merits every tittle of it  Augustine  One word more sir shall we meet here in the garden  Mr Fletcher  As your please The weather is so fine you may step here into the summerhouse it will hold all your company  SCENE IX  Mr Fletcher Honoria  Honoria  I fear sir your presence will be much more necessary here than mine  Mr Fletcher  You fear  Honoria  Yes sir for I have told you Master Albert was not long since with me From some words which he dropped I have reason to believe that my brother's company have laid a plot to cheat him of his money  Mr Fletcher  All the better if he finds himself their victim I will hide myself behind the summerhouse there just by that partition and hear every word of their discourse They will enter here and cannot possibly discover me but in the interim take you care and if you see their roguery seem as if you did not  Honoria  I shall find it hard sir to dissemble It will be painful to me should I see my brother prove the object of their ridicule and fall a victim to his open nature  Mr Fletcher  By himself alone can he be fully undeceived and in that case I shall with less difficulty persuade him to be attentive for the future in the choice of his connexions and so cure him likewise of his love for gaming which I must acknowledge he seems ready to adopt as a habit  Honoria  How sir can he have a thought of going thus to cards He ought to know himself He is so credulous that every sharper must suppose him proper for his purpose and so warm that at the first ill luck he falls into a passion  Mr Fletcher  Yes that is just his character I did not think you so observant Honoria  Honoria  One should be in truth observant of another's conduct if one means to serve him And  Mr Fletcher  A knock it must be Jonathan's friends they do not desire to lose a moment I now leave you I will go round about and gain my station    He goes out    SCENE X  Honoria    alone    How I long to know the issue of all this Alas dear brother who can tell but your future happiness in life depends on the decision of the present afternoon  SCENE XI  Honoria Augustine Jonathan Albert Rich Vyse Crib  Jonathan    to Honoria    I was afraid Miss Honoria as I mentioned to your brother that our company might incommode you but he would not  Augustine  Incommode her I am in hopes that she will keep us company  Honoria  With all my heart if you think proper gentlemen  Vyse    with constraint    You do us honour madam  Crib    whispering Jonathan    This is quite unlucky In politeness we must play whatever game she likes You should not have consented to come here  Augustine  Perhaps I shall be able gentlemen to introduce a friend of mine to your acquaintance likewise  Rich  Shall you  Augustine  Yes and not without a pocket full of gold  Jonathan    aside    That is well  Honoria  We will stay here in the garden if you please  Albert  We cannot do better We shall have the pleasure of a charming walk  Rich  Do you design to walk  Albert  What else  Vyse  Why play  Albert  But I do not understand your play and if I did I shall not wish to lose my money  Crib  Wish to lose it just as if it were certain that you would lose it  Albert  Sir with you particularly You are too skilful by a deal for me  Augustine  If I should win I promise I will return you every farthing  Jonathan  And I too  Rich and Vyse  And we  Albert  You would make a fool of me To lose my money and receive it back or on the other hand win yours and keep it is not what I do so do not concern yourselves on my account I will see you play or else walk up and down the garden hereabouts  Honoria  My father gentlemen cannot have the honour to receive you    Rich and his company seem rejoiced    but has bid me entertain you Augustine will get ready some refreshments and I will run and fetch the cards  Crib  That is needless I have a pack about me  Augustine  How about you  Crib  Yes I study them  Honoria  And have you fish too  Crib  I shall beg you to get us them unless we are to stake our money  Jonathan    aside to Crib    You remember I have no money    aloud    No no we shall hardly know what we are about And so miss if you will be so kind  Monoria  Enough I will bring the bag Come brother  SCENE XII  Jonathan Albert Rich Vyse Crib  Vyse    going into the summerhouse with Jonathan Rich and Crib while Albert walks about    I am sorry we are here  Rich  What matters since the father is not here  Crib  You should not have consented to the place of meeting Jonathan  Jonathan  Here or in my room what difference does that make  Rich  Well then when Augustine has lost every thing we will carry off his money and go play where we think proper  Vyse  We shall empty very likely the young lady's pocket also  Crib  Yes that is what I look for let us take care however We will put in our fish at twopence each for half a dozen deals or so and when the game grows warm and they have won a little we will then make them double  Jonathan  You remember your promise Crib  Crib  Do not you be uneasy We know one another All our loss shall be in counters and we will have no reckoning when the game is over I will dispose the cards in such a way that we must lose at first and that will draw them on  Jonathan  But Crib you know you fleeced me quite the other day and I have now but sixpence in my pocket How am I to pay my loss  Crib  Your loss we shall be sure to win if we attend to what we do  Vyse  I should be glad if Augustine's friend would come he will be another pigeon that we shall pluck  Rich  Yes yes I know of none so easy to be duped as these same bookish fellows  Crib  We had best begin that they may find us busy when they come    He takes his cards out    Stay I will put them so that you may lose    He shuffles them    Now you shall see    He gives three cards to Jonathan Rich and Vyse lays down as many for himself and then addresses Jonathan    Do you stand  Jonathan  No beg  Crib  There  Jonathan    looking at the cards    Out  Crib    to Vyse    And you  Vyse  One card but not a high one  Crib  Much good may it do youthere  Vyse  Out too  Crib    to Rich    Now you are to be out You beg I suppose  Rich  No as Vyse and Jonathan are both out I stand  Crib  And so will I How many are you  Vyse  Twentyfive  Crib  And I just thirty I have won And yet I might have lost by doing the reverse of what I did as you shall see the two first games that we play when Augustine and  the lady comes who having won will then have no objection to play higher  Jonathan  But how can you be sure of winning when you please  Crib  You have already paid for your instruction and I will let you know the secret I tell every thing to friends when I have pocketed their money With my art you will win of others what you have lost of me and so be quits  Jonathan  Well let me know  Crib  You see    shewing the cards    the ten and court cards are a very little longer than the rest and all the smaller ones as high as five not reckoning in the aces somewhat broader by which means I can at pleasure bring the picture cards c to the top in shuffling and the five and those below it to the bottom I contrive to give you two of those on the top and afterward the other from the bottom so that at the most you have but five and twenty and will therefore generally beg Well then you have it from the top and must infallibly be out  Jonathan  I understand you  Crib  This is all my lesson and you have it upon easy terms ask Rich and Vyse else who so profitably follow my instructions But I see the lady coming in so push about the deal  SCENE XIII  Jonathan Rich Vyse Crib Honoria  Honoria    putting down a box upon the table with a pack of cards and fish and counters in it    You do not lose any time I see  Crib  I was but showing Mr Jonathan a new game  Jonathan  You will sit down with us We shall have that honour  Honoria  If I knew the game that you play  Vyse  It is a very easy game It is only  One and thirty  Rich  Had you never seen it played you will know enough to beat us at it by the second deal  Honoria  I know a little of it It would perhaps be better for me not to play with those that know it so completely  as you gentlemen however if it gives you pleasure  Jonathan  Oh yes miss the greatest in the world  Vyse  And even should you win too all our money  Honoria    with a smile    Yes that is my intention  Rich  You will be scarce the richer for it in the end we play but for a trifle  Jonathan    with impatience    Well and what are we about We pass away the time in talking  Crib  We must wait for Master Augustine it is but just that we should amuse him we are his guests  SCENE XIV  Jonathan Rich Vyse Crib Honoria Augustine  Augustine  Here here I am The servant will be with us very shortly I have ordered some refreshment  Jonathan  Come sir we are waiting for you  Augustine  Thank you  Vyse  Let us give out the fish  Rich  There are six of us to every one two dozen and ten counters that is ten dozen more  Jonathan  But how much every fish  Crib  Just what the lady pleases  Honoria  Oh it is rather as you like  Augustine  Our fish were twopence each when last we played together five staked every deal by each and half a dozen the bonace  Honoria  Well be it so  Crib  Then here goes to begin    Crib takes the cards and deals The lady and her brother win by rib's contrivance three times running    Honoria  Hey hey if we go on in this way I think I shall soon fulfil my prophecy  Crib  While we play so low as twopence we shall never ruin one another  Vyse  Well then shall we make it fourpence  Augustine  Oh with all my heart I have so much money you cannot break me easily    He shakes his purse at which Crib and his companions look with pleasure    Honoria  And I can risque as much I fancy as my brother  Crib  We must first then pay our debts that we may have our full account of fish and countersLet me see    after having counted    I have lost one counter and six fish that is eighteen fish and eighteen twice is six and thirty just three shillings there they are  Rich  I have all my counters but am master of no more than two poor fish that is two and twenty lost or three and eightpence There  Vyse  I am come off much the worst Two counters gone and twice as many fish which come to four and eightpenceI put down a crown and take up fourpence  Augustine  Well and you Master Jonathan  Jonathan  I have lost least No more than fifteen fish or half acrown I will change a guinea when we rise to pay it  Honoria  Good So now I will see my winnings One two threeThree counters and three fish That is six and sixpence just of which I take four shillings and the two and sixpence Master Jonathan you shall owe me  Augustine  So that all the rest is to pay my four and forty fishIt is comical enough however that we should be the only winners  Rich  Oh I always lose for my part  Jonathan  So now the fish are fourpence  Augustine  Yes that is settled  Crib    shuffling the cards    Come I will deal  SCENE THE LAST  Jonathan Rich Vyse Crib Honoria Augustine Albert who came in a little while before Mr Fletcher  Mr Fletcher    to Jonathan and his friends who seem confounded    Pray do not disturb yourselves  Augustine  Sit down my father does not come to interrupt us I informed you that I might have a friend to introduce and he will play with us Won't you sir  Honoria  O yes pray play we shall be very glad to get your money and these gentlemen I know will like to share it too  Mr Fletcher  With all my heart So every one fit down    To Jonathan and his friends who seem quite overwhelmed    But what is the matter gentlemen Are you afraid to play with me I can assure you I am no sharper    They sit down at last    You    to Crib    were dealing when I entered so continue pray but first let us see have you a pack complete    Crib wants to drop the cards but Mr Fletcher secures and looks them over    It is droll enough to have the courtcards all together thus but Honoria why not give us cleaner cards Pray hand me over those  Honoria  It was not my fault sir as this gentleman    pointing to Crib    had brought them in his pocket and the play was going on when I came in with ours  Mr Fletcher    to Albert    What you here Master Albert I am very glad to see you but pray do not you play  Albert  I would rather be a looker on you know I have nothing sir to throw away  Mr Fletcher  You are in the right to think so and your prudence merits praise    To Crib    But come sir here are better cards    Crib takes them with a trembling band    at least a little cleaner what is your game Pray tell me  Augustine  One and thirty  Mr Fletcher  And for what  Honoria  No more than fourpence a fish I have won all this four shillings and two and sixpence owing me by Mr Jonathan who wants change  Mr Fletcher    aside    Wants change I smell a rat    to Honoria    So much as fourpence that is a little too much but no matter if we have all of us enough to pay our losings So let us see your money Mr Jonathan I begin with you    Jonathan is confused    What ails you Are you taken ill  Jonathan  Yeees sirLet me  Mr Fletcher  What is all this one stammers and the other seems confounded    to Crib    You sir too are disconcerted  Augustine  What is the matter with them  Mr Fletcher  It is high time that I should explain the reason of this strange behaviour Augustine you observe the effects of a guilty conscience Happily they are not yet so totally abandoned as to hide their villainy beneath a brazen front and bully in their own defence  Augustine  What say you sir Sure you are mistaken It is my sister as she told you and myself that are the only winners  Crib    taking courage    Have we failed to pay our losings every one but Master Jonathan  Jonathan  No but why because you have cheated me already out of all my money  Mr Fletcher  I was right in thinking that they would unmask themselves And Augustine you may see what villains you have chosen for your companions  Augustine  Oh I cannot think so sir  Mr Fletcher  Well then Mr Jonathan do you speak you seem least hardened Tell me was there not a plot among you to defraud my children  Jonathan  Yes indeed sir but for my part I assure you I was forced into it All my wish was to get back a part of what I had lost before If you but knew how much this wicked fellow has squeezed from me for the other two are nothing to him you would say that he should be sent to prison  Mr Fletcher  You have well deserved your loss by mixing with such company but tell me how much you have lost  Jonathan  Two guineas and a few odd shillings with them all together and my watch coat buttons buckles and a guinea more in money afterwards in private with the tallest but the guinea I still owe him and he threatened if I did not prevail on Master Augustine to fit down and play this evening that he would tell my father  Albert  This sir I can say in Jonathan's favour that he gave me just the same account this morning and was grieved at what he thought himself compelled to do The grand criminal is Crib the tallest the two others in comparison  Mr Fletcher  I comprehend what you would say and therefore    to Rich and Vyse    little rascals get you gone this instant Perhaps it is not as yet too late that I should think of rescuing you from infamy and therefore I will inform your parents of your conduct  Rich and Vyse    dropping on their knees    Pardon us this once sir we beseech you and we will never come within your doors again  Mr Fletcher  No I shall take care that you never do but then it is not enough that my children should be safe in future from your roguery I owe the same good service to all fathers What perversity at such an age not only to be gamblers but vile cheats the hatefullest of human beings However out of pity to your youth and from the hope which I have of your amendment I will do no more than tell your parents but if ever I am told that you still continue your detestable employment I will make known your infamy to every one about us So be gone and never let me see you here again Be gone I say    Rich and Vyse withdraw in silence and confusion    And you sir is it true that you have got these things from Jonathan  Crib    with hesitation    Yes sir  Mr Fletcher  You have cheated him but that is no matter Jonathan lost them and has merited his fortune We will put a value on them  Jonathan  I could wish indeed that I had sufficient to redeem my loss  Augustine  O sir if all that I have in my pocket be sufficient Jonathan may command it I have full five guineas take them for the service of my friend  Mr Fletcher  Augustine this is very generous  Jonathan  What to me such friendship  Augustine  We are neighbours both and you may pay me weekly or in any way you please    Crib gives Jonathan his things    Mr Fletcher    to Jonathan    Is every thing returned you  Jonathan  Yes sir and I am saved by your generosity and Augustine's from the resentment of my father Oh I will never risque his gifts again in such a manner  Mr Fletcher    offering Crib the money    Here is the value of your theft for such it must be called and you shall have it to subsist upon in prison till you are called to an  er for your crime as possibly you may not have the means without it Nay expect not by solicitation to divert the rigour of my justice Your seduction of two youths your felony upon the property of this young man and your attempt to make him instrumental in the robbery of another well deserve that rigour This must be your sentence so withdraw a little for the present    Crib withdraws and weeps for very rage    Jonathan    falling on his knees to Mr Fletcher    O dear Sir from what a gulph of ruin you preserve me And without you what would have been my evil fortune when thrust out from home and perhaps stigmatized in public for my vices I am then indebted to your pity for my reputation my repose and my existence    He rises and embraces Augustine    And my generous Augustine you whom I was going to  Augustine  Never think more of it I do not and for the time to come be happy  Mr Fletcher  Master Albert's testimony of your grief at being forced into this plot alleviates your offence and therefore you may still continue to visit my son but after what he has just done in your behalf I shall account you the most profligate of youths unless you study to deserve his friendship  Jonathan  Oh I will do so Rely upon me sir  Mr Fletcher  And as for you dear Albert I have reason to be charmed with what so many tongues have told me of your modesty and virtue By your laudable example you may very much contribute to the happiness of AugustineI request you to be often with him and if I can shew my gratitude by being serviceable to your happiness I shall promote it with as much affection as your parents would do  Albert  Your esteem dear sir is happiness sufficient for me  Mr Fletcher  You observe my dear children the unhappy consequences that result from gaming  Augustine  Yes sir and shall shudder all my life at the idea of them  Mr Fletcher  You observe too Augustine with what care and circumspection one should chuse a friend  Augustine  Yes that too sir and am convinced how happy it is for me to have a friend as I have said already in my father  THE MONKEY  FRANCIS and his playmate Lorenzo were at the window As it chanced they heard a pipe and tabor Looking up the street they saw a bear approaching sternly and a man conducting him by a chain to which the creature was fastened at the other end I should be afraid said Lozenzo to stand too near that animal for do but listen Francis Did you ever hear such growling I should quake if I were by him Oh he could not hurt you answered Francis you may see he has a muzzle to prevent his biting  They were talking thus when Bruin was come exactly opposite their window in his progress down the street Two monkies now took up the little gentlemen's attention One was light and nimble but the other not so active Both were jumping to and fro on Bruin's back who suffered them to play their tricks as if he did not care about it They had fruit in plenty thrown them by the mob which they caught in their paws as soon as it was flung to them and swallowed almost instantly But what delighted them particularly were the nuts which the people threw them Seated on their breech and holding them between their two forepaws they broke the shells and picked the kernels out with something of an air  It chanced that a very large one came among the rest The heavy monkey raised himself upon his long hindlegs to get it but the little one darting forward seized it in the air before it could have time to reach him Cheated of his prey in this manner by the little one he gnashed his teeth with rage His front grew wrinkled and his eyes flashed fire he thrust his claws out fell upon the little one and seemed upon the point of tearing him to bits The bear found it very difficult to save him  Do you see said Francis to his little friend how frightful that same monkey is become since first he fell into a rage and how he shews his teeth Oh no I should not like to be within his reach How terrible I should be scared to death  Indeed said Lorenzo Well then can you imagine it but yesterday when you were in a passion you were like  him Look ye you had all his wrinkles you even grinned as he does now your eyes shewed what a passion you were in and like the monkey you seemed ready to devour poor little Harry who had notwithstanding done you no great harm I only wished that I could have got a lookingglass Your face was in reality so ugly it would have frightened you  Indeed said Francis Is it possible that I resembled such an odious beast I could not but have been extremely frightful if I did and must endeavour for the future to be never in a passion When I find myself growing angry I will then bethink me of the monkey recollect the malice in his countenance and that will make me shudder at the thought of being like him Do you too my good friend Lorenzo if I forget this resolution like a friend remind me of it  Lorenzo assured him that he would do so and was faithful to his promise Francis by degrees got rid entirely of his wrathful habit or was very rarely in a passion He enjoyed the greater happiness and his indulgent parents were not less transported at his reformation  THE ALPS  THE sun was rising in the heavens The dew drops which are seen on every leaf so early in the morning glittered with the colours of the rainbow and the shadows of the trees were shortening on the ground when Damon holding his son a grownup lad by the hand came out and sat down on his garden terrace to enjoy the freshness of the morning  Dearest father said the son pray wake me always at this hour for I am charmed with contemplating such a scene as I now see all round me How delightful the whole prospect But perhaps it would be more so were it not confined by younder mountains which lift up their snowy tops so high that any one would suppose them to prop the clouds above them  I do not think as you do said the father Those same mountains leave us space enough and  that  made up of  fields and meadows to contemplate and by thus consining as you say the prospect help to vary it and more particularly so at evening when the sun still tips them with a thousand streaks of gold even after the whole level plain is dark  When we shall once have visited those mountains and considered its inhabitants you will be pleased with contemplating on them I am certain since they cannot but suggest agreeable sensations  How can men said the youth be fond of living on such mountains covered as they are with snow  They do not live there said Damon you will seek in vain to find inhabitants upon the heights it is at the bottom of the mountains that they are situated There are charming vallies stretched among them but before the traveller can obtain them he discerns no prospect save that of barren rocks This prospect being passed he comes to wide extended carpets of the greenest sod he breathes an air embalmed on all sides by ten thousand odoriferous flowers that grow there and his ear is pleasingly affected by the murmurs of as many streams descending from the summit of the hills The sun by shining on them with his noon day radiance makes them put on the appearance of the b  ightest silver And amongst them some precipitated from a rock reecho when they reach the bottom and  there  rise in clouds as one may say of dust that yield a trembling kind of light Their passage is distinguished by a multitude of charming flowers which blossom on the margin and the flowers whose stalks wave to and fro obedient to the breeze that agitates them and the waters that flow in among them heighten the delightful prospect  Spring is very late and harvest very early in this region whence it happens that the ground brings forth no other sort of grain than what is sowed some little while before the summer and grows ripe betimes in autumn hence too it comes that the fields are shaded by no other trees than those producing cherries plums and other early fruit Here and there the traveller meets with  am  ets and the houses being made of wood are so much blackened by the sun as to afford a very striking contrast with the smiling verdure of the little orchards that surround them  In those hamlets live many innocent and happy families which for the space of five or six long months are almost buried under snow As long as that sad season lasts they take the greatest care imaginable of their little flocks at times they visit one another spin the flax which they have gathered before hand and make different articles of furniture in wood which they either use themselves or are sure to fell for money to their neighbours  As soon towards summer as the sun has melted that vast heap of snow which covered all their fields and habitations and the river that flows through their vallies has completely carried off the water with which their lands were overflowed all the men begin to cultivate their fields or meadows and the women labour in their gardens During summer the industrious father of his family repairs to other districts with the produce of his labours and brings back in barter for them those conveniencies of life which are not to be had for money even in his hamlet  Many travel upon mules and cross their craggy hills along such paths as have been cut through rocks and those too over frightful precipices They transport to very distant parts the honey which they have stored in autumn which is universally acknowledged to be excellent They likewise traffic in the skins of goats which they entrap while climbing up the rocks or find among them dead Another article of merchandize for which they are distinguished is the dormouse This animal benumbed by the excessive cold retains in holes and cavities which she digs for herself to serve by way of habitation and in which she lies rolled up almost like a ball and on a bed of hay that heat and life which with returning spring the sun expands and a fourth great object of their commerce is the crystal which they contrive to quarry in the gaps or chasms of their highest rocks And many on the other hand are guides to foreigners who have the curiosity to travel over and inspect their frozen mountains  I myself have been upon them like many others guided in my way by one of those good menI call them good in opposition to the multitudes that live in towns and civilized societyBut yet they have lost a great deal of their natural simplicity by frequent converse with such  foreigners as have employed them for guides I admired the people and their way of living therefore having satisfied my curiosity upon the mountains I determined to remain among them some few days that I might gain a better knowledge of their manners  I must let you know what conversation I heard pass between the wife and child of  my  conductor while I lived among them I was sitting on the grass beneath a pinetree Julian my conductor had that day set out before the dawn to guide two English gentlemen who came on the preceding evening to inspect the mountains It was still broad daylight but the sun was rapidly descending towards the west The mother ascended upon a rising ground the son came after her They fixed their eyes upon the icy masses which advanced their cloggy cliffs on the other side of the valley and the wife began as follows  The Mother  I am looking to no purpose I discover nothing I do not see him yet  The Son  Let us go to yonder rock before us shaded by those trees and we shall see much better thence There we shall be able to discern more plainly all that quarter of the mountain where my father I suppose must be  The Mother  Well we are now got to it notwithstanding which I can distinguish nothing more than from the spot that we have left It is all lost labour he does not appear And yet the sun is nearly setting and the day will soon close in  The Son  O mother we shall yet have two full hours of daylight  The Mother  And perhaps he may be four or five leagues distant Who can tell exactly where he is I wish he would give over wandering thus among the mountains Never does he set out on his journies but I tremble lest unfortunately he should not return alive or else come back with broken limbs by falling down upon the ice or while he scales the rocks  The Son  I need not tell you that he has promised to drive this trade no longer when the profits which he has made shall be enough to buy the little field between our cottage and the  Arva  We shall then live comfortably with our flock our honey fruits and field of barley  The Mother  Ah dear son I should much rather wish to live in less abundance so that I might only have more peace of mind The happy days which we are to have when he has obtained this field will have been bought too dearly at the price of that distress and trouble which these his journies cost But do not I see him No not yet If he should be obliged to stay all night upon the ice If itbut you have got I see that spyingglass which a traveller lately left behind him in our hut and that brings objects fifty furlongs off as near as if they were but ten Look therefore if there is nothing to be seen You know the use of it extremely well but I for my part not at all  The Son  I will rest the end of it on this old trunk I think I seeyes mothersomething and it moves It is he I verily believeYes yes it is he indeed He is walking on the broken flakes of ice that lie near yon big rock and which last month you know were separated from it  The Mother  Let me have the spyingglass Quick quick perhaps too I may see himI must shut one eye you sayI havebut I distinguish nothing Every thing is blackStay stay O now I see the rockand likewise men and Julian is among them But I have lost them now they are out of sight I cannot recover them again Hold you the glass I shall perhaps discern them with my naked eyeYes yes I see them They are coming on and in the middle of the valley Julian I can see comes first  The Son  They stop my father sticks his pole into the ice before him and prepares to take a spring There there he is up and down again No doubt but there was one of those large gaps before him in the ice of which he has so often told us What can cause them  The Mother  I do not know exactly but have heard that when the ice below is melted  that  above it having no support gives way and opens with a noise which one may hear a great way off You have observed the great round table in our curate's kitchen Well the leg which supported it in the middle was much higher than the others and one day the sides had many heavy things laid on them Unexpectedly it split exactly in the middle and the crack grew wider till the sides could rest upon  the shorter legs And now I suppose these gaps are so occasioned likewise But look once again and see what they are doing They seem standing still The gap sure does not prevent them from advancing  The Son  I can see their countenances very plainly They seem asking one another what they ought to do Ah now my father takes a second spring and now he is got safe over one more gap  The Mother  Yes yes I see him too What rashness He might slip in springing or when over or he might not possibly spring far enough and drop into the gap He does not take a single step but what he knows as well as I do makes my heart sink within me He should think that it is not impossible but I may see him he should argue within himself and say My wife  does  see me and my danger frights her  The Son  He is very far perhaps from guessing what we are about now  The Mother  He knows that while he is absent on this dangerous business I send forth my eyes to seek him Would to heaven I could but shut them  The Son  Yes let us do so mother Let us put our hands before them and not look again till he has cleared the valley and is safe  The Mother  I cannot I had rather tremble every moment for his safety than lose sight of him though for a moment only But where is he I can see him now no longer  The Son  Nor I eitherThey have disappeared Ah mother  The Mother  My poor child embrace me We are now left to ourselves and I have nothing in the world to comfort me but you Yes they have disappeared indeed and in a moment too I did but turn away my eyes to fix them upon you and in that instant they are vanished An abyss perhaps has opened under them as they were going on perhaps they may be tossing in it not yet dead but making unavailing efforts to get out and calling for assistance with a voice which no one to their cost is nigh enough to hear I will hasten to the spot come follow me my child My knees knock one against another and will hardly bear my body up but I shall soon find strength sufficient to go forward Come but stay a little  Do not you dear child see something there in motion There just where I point to at the bottom of you rock  The Son  Yes yes I think I doIt is one of them It is one of them indeed and now I can discern the other I can see his hat but still I look in vain to find out my poor father  The Mother  He will come and I dare hope to see him very soon The gentlemen must first have got out of the frozen valley and they hide him from us Doubtless it will not be long before we see him Look again my child  The Son  I can see only the two gentlemen my father is not with them  The Mother  And the gentlemen do they seem waiting for him then Have they their faces turned towards the place from which they come  The Son  No they walk strait forward  The Mother  Then so much the better If your father were not following them or could not they would hardly do so they would try whatever they were able to assist him in his danger  The Son  Yes yes we should do as much but they on the other hand seem rich and I have often heard that such despise the poor  The Mother  Not all and then too they are men and must be sensible of people's misery like others Would not you stretch forth a hand to help your little dog were he in danger Would you leave him unassisited  The Son  No indeed but why because I love him and do rich men love the poor I have had money given me by one rich man to fight my playmateAh I think I see my father now yes there he is yes yes indeed and as you said behind the gentlemen  The Mother  Yes yes I see him too Thank God But still my heart beats grievously I am in a tremble So let us both sit down we will have our eyes fixed on them till they are safe on this side of the valley and by that time as I hope my agitation will be calmed Methinks they come on very quick No doubt they wish to end their journey before day shuts in Look son I fancy they are drawing nigh a precipice before them and my fears again came on me  The Son  It is a mass of ice that forms a hollow underneath It looks as if it were suspended in the air and they do not seem to know their danger for they stop  The Mother  They stop and may perhaps without expecting it be swallowed up or buried in the ruins should the ice fall down It will fall down and I shall seeoh heavens fly for your life my Julian my dear Julian fly see what a mass of ice may overwhelm you FlyMy voice alas at such a distance is not to be heard My cries are useless I am distracted  The Son  Mother I can see no longer through the spyingglass because I cry and yet I cannot take away my eyes But now I see again Yes there they are and they have cleared the precipice quite cleared it They are out of danger now I see them they turn back to view the rock under which they have passed perhaps without knowing at the time what peril they encountered They lift their arms up they are talking to each other they are looking at some object that astounds them  The Mother  They are out of danger that is enough for me I see them they have nothing now but level ground remaining Kiss me my dear child and let us both pass on to meet your father But at no time in my life shall I forget what I have felt this afternoon Let us make all possible haste and beg that he would no more thus venture into danger We shall have the little field in that case somewhat later or it may be not at all and it is no matter We have lived till now without it our enjoyments have not been on that account the less we have in short been happy and what more can we desire I shall not for the future know that he is returning to those frozen regions without fearing every danger that I know and such as I can but guess He may perhaps be safe feated at his ease beneath a tree but I shall fancy that I behold him struggling in a gap and striving to get out Whatever money he receives from those whom he may conductif he but loves us he should think that he buys it at a price too dear  The mother and the son upon this went forward and I followed them till they had gained the valley They pressed on to meet a husband and a father and at last when they observed him with the Englishmen draw near they durst not note him They sat down together let  him pass and then got up and followed slowly after It was not before they reached their cottage that the wife and son ran both to Julian and together sunk into his arms The son related every thing which they had both seen and feared The mother did not speak at first but when she saw her husband touched by the affectionate behaviour of his son she once again embraced him and shed tears He promised that he would never more affright her by returning to the ice but cultivate his field in peace  THE BREAKFAST  COME said Mr Glassington to Percival his son one beauteous summer morning here is a basket with some cake and currants in it Let us go and breakfast by the river's side  With all my heart papa said Percival and jumped about for joy He took the basket in one hand and with the other in his father's hastened towards the river Having reached it they walked on a little way to chuse a proper place when Mr Glassington arriving at a very pleasant spot cried out Let us stop here Percival for this methinks will yield us a delightful prospect while we sit and eat  Percival  But how are we to eat without a table  Mr Glassington  Fortunately here is the trunk of an old tree which would serve by way of table very well if we had need of one but you may eat your currants as they lie together in the basket  Percival  So I can but how shall we supply the want of chairs  Mr Glassington  And do you reckon this soft grass then nothing See how thick it is set with flowers We will take our seat upon it or perhaps you would rather chuse the carpet  Percival  Chuse the carpet Why you know papa the carpet is fast nailed down upon the parlour floor  Mr Glassington  It is true there is a carpet there but there is one here also  Percival  I do not see it if there is  Mr Glassington  Why what is the grass then but a carpet for the fields And what a charming one too It is of a fresher colour and much downier than any one that we have Then how spacious it covers every hill and all the level plain The lambs repose upon it at their ease Think Percival what they would have to suffer on a bare or stony piece of ground Their limbs are so extremely delicate they could not but be very quickly injured They have mothers but those mothers cannot make them up soft featherbeds God therefore has provided for them better than the poor sheep can and made them this soft couch where they may roll about or sleep entirely at their ease  Percival  And then papa there is one good thing befides that they may eat it when they like  Mr Glassington  Oho I understand your meaning so here take your cake and currants  Percival    biting off a bit    Oh how good There is nothing wanting but a story while I am eating Will you tell me one papa the prettiest that you know  Mr Glassington  With all my heart Your cake reminds me of a story that I can tell about three cakes  Percival  One two three cakes Oh what a charming story that must be So quick papa and tell it me  Mr Glassington  Come then first and sit beside me Be wholly at your ease and then you will hear the better  Percival  I am quite ready so begin papa  THE THREE CAKES  Mr Glassington  THERE was a little boy named Henry about your age His parents had but lately fixed him at a boardingschool He was a special boy for ever at his book and happened once to get the highest place at exercises His mama was told it She could no how keep from dreaming of the pleasure and when morning came she got up early sent to speak with the cook and said as follows Cook you are to make a cake for Henry who yesterday was very  good at school With all my heart replied the cook and set immediately about it It was as big aslet me seeas big asas a hat when flapped The cook had stuffed it with nice almonds large Pistachio nuts and candied lemonpeel and iced it over with a coat of sugar so that it was very smooth and of a perfect white The cake no sooner was come home from baking than the cook put on her things and carried it to school When Henry first saw it he jumped up and down like any Merry Andrew He was not so patient as to wait 'till they could let him have a knife but fell upon it tooth and nail He ate and ate 'till school began and after school was over he ate again at night too it was the same thing 'till bedtime Nay a little fellow that Henry had for a playmate told me that he put the cake upon his bolster when he went to bed and waked and waked a dozen times that he might take a bit I cannot so easily believe this last particular but then it is very true at least that on the morrow when the day was hardly broke he set about his favourite business once again continuing at it all the morning and by noon had ate it up The dinner bell now rung but Henry as one may fancy had no stomach and was vexed to see how heartily the other children ate It was however worse than this at five o'clock when school was over His companions asked him if he would not play at cricket taw or kites Alas he could not so they played without him In the mean time Henry could hardly stand upon his legs he went and sat down in a corner very gloomy while the children said one to another What is the matter with poor Henry who used to skip about and be so merry See how pale and sorrowful he is The master came himself and seeing him was quite alarmed It was all lost labour to interrogate him Henry could not be brought to speak a single word By great good luck a boy at length came forward in the secret and his information was that Henry's mama had sent him a great cake the day before which he had swallowed in an instant as it were and that his present sickness was occasioned only by his gluttony On this the master sent for an apothecary who soon ordered him a quantity of physic phial after phial Henry as one would fancy found it very nauseous but was forced to take the whole for fear of dying which had he omitted  it would certainly have been the case When some few days of physic and strict regimen had passed his health was reestablished as before but his mama protested that she would never let him have another cake  Percival  He did not merit so much as the smell of such a thing But this is but one cake papa and you informed me that there were three if you remember in your story  Mr Glassington  Patience patience here is another cake in what I am now going to tell  Henry's master had another scholar whose name was Francis He had written his mama a very pretty letter and it had not so much as a blotted stroke in recompence for which she sent him likewise a great cake and Francis thus addressed himself I will not like that glutton Henry eat up my cake at once and so be fick as he was no I will make my pleasure last a great deal longer So he took the cake which he could hardly lift by reason of its weight and watched the opportunity of slipping up into his chamber with it where his box was and in which he put it under lock and key At playtime every day he slipped away from his companions went up stairs a tiptoe cut a tolerable slice off swallowed it put by the rest and then came down and mixed again with his companions He continued this clandestine business all the week and even then the cake was hardly half consumed But what ensued At last the cake grew dry and quickly after mouldy nay the very maggots got into it and by that means had their share on which account it was not then worth eating and our young curmudgeon was compelled to fling the rest away with great reluctance However no one grieved for him  Percival  No indeed nor I papa What keep a cake locked up seven days together and not give one's friend a bit That is monstrous But let us have the other now  Mr Glassington  There was another little gentleman who went to school with Henry and Francis likewise and his name was Gratian His mama sent  him  a cake one day because she loved him and indeed he loved her also very much It was no sooner come than Gratian thus addressed his young companions Come and look at what mama has sent me you must every one eat with me  They scarce needed such a welcome piece of information twice but all got round the cake as you have doubtless seen the bees resorting to a flower just blow As Gratian was provided with a knife he cut a great piece off and then divided it into as many shares as he had brought boys together by such a courteous invitation Upon this he ranged them in a circle and beginning with the boy who then stood next him he went round distributing to each his portion 'till the shares were all disposed of in this manner Gratian then took up the rest and told them that he would eat his piece next day on which he put it up and went to play with his companions who were all solicitous to have him chuse whatever game he thought might entertain him most  A quarter of an hour had scarcely past as they were playing when a poor old man who had a fiddle came into the yard He had a very long white beard and being blind was guided by a little dog who went before him with a collar round his neck To this a cord was fastened which the poor blind man held in his hand It was noticed with how much dexterity the little dog conducted him and how he shook a bell which I forgot to say hung underneath his collar when he came near any one as if he had designed to say by such an action Do not throw down or run against my master Being come into the yard he sat him down upon a stone and hearing several children talking round him May dear little gentlemen said he I will play you all the pretty tunes that I know if you will give me leave The children wished for nothing half so much He put his violin in tune and then thrummed over several jigs and other scraps of music which it was easy to conjecture had been new in former times Little Gratian saw that while he played his merriest airs a tear would now and then roll down his cheeks on which he stooped to ask him why he wept Because said the musician I am very hungry I have no one in the world that will give my dog or me a bit of any thing to eat I wish I could but work and get for both of us a morsel of something but I have lost my strength and sight Alas I laboured hard till I was old and now I want bread The generous Gratian hearing this wept too He did not say a word but ran to fetch the cake which he had designed to eat himself He  brought it out with joy and as he ran along began Here good old man here is some cake for you Where replied the poor musician feeling with his hands where is it for I am blind and cannot see you Gratian put the cake into his hand when laying down his fiddle on the ground he wiped his eyes and then began to eat At every piece he put into his mouth he gave his faithful little dog a bit who came and ate out of his hand and Gratian standing by him smiled with pleasure at the thought of having fed the poor old man when he was hungry  Percival  Oh the good good GratianLet me have your knife papa  Mr Glassington  Here Percival but why my knife  Percival  I will tell you I have only nibbled here a little of my cake so pleased I was in listening to you So I will cut it smoothThereSee how well I have ordered itThese scraps together with the currants will be more than I shall want for breakfast and the first poor man that I meet going home shall have the rest even though he should not play upon the violin  OH THE UGLY BEAUTY OUT UPON HER  Claudia Lucy  Claudia  LUCY have you seen my sister's new dog  Lucy  Not yet dear cousin  Claudia  You have then a pleasure still to come Why she is the drollest little creature in the world  Lucy  Indeed and what is her name  Claudia  Would you believe itBEAUTY  Lucy  That is a pretty name indeed  Claudia  O cousin she is much prettier than her name  Lucy  And how is she so very pretty  Claudia  First she is hardly biggersee    closing her hand    than this  Lucy  I love a little dog  Claudia  And then one does not know what to take her fora greyhound or a spaniel  Lucy  That is quite funny I protest  Claudia  If you could only see her tail it is like a bowpot and her ears that sweep the ground and then her long long hair as soft as silk curling about her eyes and muzzle and the whee whee little tiny face that peeps out underneath it O she is quite a picture  Lucy  Is she black or white  Claudia  She is neither black nor white but something of a coffee colour  Lucy  Ah that makes me think of what I like for breakfast I do not get it frequentlyThey hardly ever give me any thing but milk  Claudia  What milk and nothing else  Lucy  And bread that is all But let us return to Beauty  Claudia  Why she knows more tricks than any Scaramouch They have taught her to hold out her paw and she distinguishes the right hand from the left If any one throws down a glove she will run and bring it to the owner without ever being wrong  Lucy  You don't say so  Claudia  And then she makes believe that she is dead she lies down on her side and does not get up again without a signal from my sister If you put a garden stick between her paws she will be a sentry and mount guard but what is still best of all she will dance a minuet as well as Madame Simonet  Lucy  Well now that is wonderful and she must sure have had a charming education but pray Claudia tell me is she gentle and goodnatured  Claudia  Why I cannot say much as to that for when she sees a stranger in the house she will bark and snarl like mad and one can hardly hinder her from running in between his legs to bite him  Lucy  That would be the very thing at night if she were to keep the house  Claudia  And sometimes too she will take it in her head to go and teaze papa's great dog without occasion and she never sees him eating any thing but instantly she will run and snatch it from him if she can but Jowler by good luck is exceedingly goodnatured  Lucy  How and does she do all this  Claudia  Yes truly  Lucy  And you call her  Beauty  Claudia  She is so funny and comical  Lucy  Go ClaudyI should never fancy her however fanny and comical she may be for papa has often told me that a bad heart makes every body frightful  Oh the ugly  BEAUTY  Out upon her  BUTTERFLY PRETTY BUTTERFLY  BUTTERFLY O pretty butterfly come here and rest upon this flower that I hold out in my hand  Where would you wish to go you little gadabout Do not you discern you hungry bird upon the watch to seize you he has whetted his sharp beak and holds it open to devour you Come hither then he will be afraid of me and not approach you  Butterfly O pretty butterfly come here and rest upon this flower that I hold out in my hand  I will not pull off your poor wings or give you any pain No no I know you are both weak and little as I am myself All my wish is to see you nearer I should like to view your little head taper body and long wings spotted with a thousand colours  Butterfly O pretty butterfly come here and rest upon this flower that I hold out in my hand  I will not keep you long I know you have not many weeks to live When summer is once over you will die while I shall be but six years old  So butterfly sweet pretty butterfly come here and rest upon this flower that I hold out in my hand  You should not lose a moment of the day but give your whole life up to pleasure It is your business to be sipping constantly the fragrance of some flower or other which you may do without danger on my hand  THE SUN AND MOON  WHAT a charming evening Come Alexis said Mr Wilmot to his little boy the sun is just ready to go down How glorious he appears We may behold him now He does not dazzle us so much at present as he did at noon when he was up so very high How beautiful too the clouds seem round about him They are of a purple gold and scarlet colour But behold how swiftly he descends Already only half his orb is visible And now he is wholly vanished Rarewell sun you have left us for the present till tomorrow morning  Look Alexis towards that quarter of the heavens just opposite to where the sun descended What may that be shining so behind the trees a fire No nothing like it but the moon How large and red it is One would suppose it full of blood This evening it is quite round on as they say full moon It will not be quite so round tomorrow evening less so the next evening less the evening after and so on decreasing something every evening till at last it will be in some sort like a wire bent round into a semicircle when a fortnight is gone  It will then be new moon and from day to day you will observe it afterward grow bigger and seem rounder till in fourteen days more it will be again full moon and rise as it does now behind the trees  But pray papa inform me how do both the sun and moon preserve their situations unsupported in the air I always fear they cannot but fall down upon my head  Fear nothing dear Alexis there is no danger I will explain the reason why when you can understand the matter so at present only listen while I mention how the sun and moon address you  To begin then with the sun He says as follows I am King of day I rise or make my first appearance in the East and what they call Aurora or the dawn precedes me that mankind may know of my approach I tap soon after at your window with a golden beam of light to warn you of my presence Rise I say rise lazyboots  I never shine that men may lie a bed and snore I shine that they may wake get up aad go to work  I am the mighty traveller and I run rejoicing like a giant quite across the heavens without ever stopping for at no time am I weary  I have a crown of glorious radiance on my head I shed this radiance round about me to a vast extent and even over half the universe Wherever I am present all things are beautiful and bright  I give heat too as well as light It is I who ripen with my beams the fruit in gardens and the corn that grows in fields If I should cease a moment to assist the course of nature nothing then could grow and famished men would die of despair in all the horrors of that darkness which you yourself dread so much  I am higher than the hills and clouds I should but need to come down a little towards the earth and my devouring flame would burn it up as soon as you have seen the straw consumed which men toss in bundles into a furnace  What a length of time has passed since first I gladdened the whole universe Alexis you were hardly in the world six years ago but I was I was in it when your dear papa was born and many thousand years before and I am not grown old yet  At times I lay aside my crown of radiance and surround my head with silver clouds It is not so difficult to view me then but when I dissipate those clouds about me and burst forth in all my noonday splendor you could never bear the blaze should you attempt to bear it I should blind you There is but one living creature that can look at me and that living creature is the eagle whom the birds confess their monarch He can contemplate my glory with a steady eye wide open while he views me  This same eagle darting from the summit of some elevated mountain shapes his progress towards me with a towering wing and soon is lost amid my beams through which he darts to pay me homage every minute of the day The lark suspended in the air a great deal lower sings while I am rising his best song and wakes the other bird that slumber in ten thousand trees The cork  remaining on the ground proclaims the time of my return to mortals with a piercing voice But on the other hand the bat and owl avoid my presence they fly from me with a plaintive cry and hasten to take refuge in the ruins of those towers which I once saw proudly rising domineering afterward for many ages over spacious countries and then finking with the burthen of old age  My empire is not limited like that of earthly monarchs to a corner of the world The universe at large is my dominion and besides I am the most illustrious object that was ever gazed at  But the moon says in the next place with a voice not half so much exalted as the sun's I am the queen of night I send my silver beams to give you light as often as the sun withdraws at evening from the world  You may keep looking at me without danger for I am never so resplendent as to dazzle the spectator much less do I burn I am so good natured that I let poor glowworms blaze among the hedges which the sun unpitying as he is will not  The stars shine round about me but I myself am far more luminous than any star nay all the stars together give not so much light as I do and I seem among their multitude as if I were a fair round pearl surrounded by ten thousand little diamonds  When you lie asleep I dart a beam of silver brightness through your curtains and my words are Sleep on little friend in safety You are tired I will not disturb your slumber  You have heard the nightingale  She  sings for me who sings much better than all other birds She perches on a spray and fills the forest with her music no less sweet and gentle than my brightness while the dew descends on every flower and all is calm and silent in my empire  THE ROSEBUSH  WHO will give me some nice tree or other for my garden said little Frederic one day to his brothers Augustus and Jasper and his sister Jemima  Their papa had given them each a little bit of ground to sew or plant as they thought proper  Oh not I said Augustus not I said Jasper  Well then I will answered Jemima Let me know what fort of trees you would like  A rosebush cried Frederic Do but look at mine it is the only one now left me and the leaves as you may see are turned quite yellow  Come then said the lively Jemima come and chuse one for yourself On which she led him to a little spot of ground that she cultivated and the moment they had entered pointing with her finger to a charming rosebush told him he had nothing else to do than take it up immediately  Frederic  How sister you have only two and wish besides to give me up the finest No no here is the least and just such as I want  Jemima  You do not know how much pleasure I shall feel if you will but take the other Frederic This may scarce produce you any flowers next summer but the other will I am certain and you know I shall be pleased as much with looking at it elsewhere when full blown as if it had continued in my garden  Frederic overjoyed approached the rosebush took it up and Jemima much more pleased assisted in the transplantation  It appears that the gardener noticed this surprising piece of kindness in the little girl Away he ran selected from a number of young Windsor peartrees one which he thought the finest and immediately conveyed it into Jemima's garden planting it exactly in the spot which the rosebush had possessed before  Those who have a churlish nature hardly ever are assiduous therefore when the summer months were come Jasper and his brother having never attended their rose  plants they promised no great quantity of flowers and to increase their disappointment the chief part of those which they thought were coming perished in the bud while on the contrary Frederic's rosebush in consequence of great attention paid it by himself and Jemima bore the finest centfoil roses that the whole county could boast and as long as it remained in flower the happy Frederic always had a rose to stick in Jemima's bosom and another for himself to smell  Likewise did the Windsor peartree thrive surprisingly it scattered a delicious perfume over all the garden and soon grew so thick and lofty as to yield a tolerable umbrage Jemima used to come and take her seat beneath it when the sun was hottest as her father also did when he would tell her charming stories some of which would make her all at once burst out a laughing till her sides even ached again and others produced such agreeable melancholy in her that soon after she would smile with pleasure at the recollection of her sorrow  Here is one that he told her for her generosity towards Frederic by which story she was thoroughly convinced that such as we oblige can recompence our generosity which circumstance he said without adverting to the satisfaction of our hearts must be a strong incentive to kind actions  THE NOSEGAYS  LITTLE Gerald went out one morning with his neighbour Eugene to divert themselves by gathering flowers Their eagerness would not allow them to dispatch their breakfast in the house they took it with them in their hands  They met a beggarwoman in the way who had a child apparently expiring as it were with hunger  My dear little master said the woman looking upon Gerald who happened to be first for heaven's sake give my child a morsel of your bread He has not had a bit of any thing to eat since yesterday  It may be so said Gerald but I am very hungry likewise and went forward munching all the way  Now what was Eugene's conduct He was no less hungry we must think than his companion but beholding how the poor child cried he gave up his bread and butter and received a hundred blessings which God heard in heaven  But this is not the whole The little boy revived by what the charitable Eugene had bestowed upon him instantly began to run before his benefactor brought him to a meadow where he knew there was a multitude of flowers and helped to make up so magnificent a bowpot that the pleasant smell proceeding from it made him quite forget his trouble  Eugene after this went home and shewed it with a deal of pleasure for not only was the sweetness of it very grateful but its size was such that he might easily have hid his face behind it  Next day likewise they went out and then another little boy whose name was Watty met them  After having taken half a dozen turns with Gerald and Eugene in the meadow Watty looking down perceived his buckle lost and begged them both to assist him in searching for it Oh says Gerald I cannot spare time enough for that at present and went on but Eugene stopped immediately that he might be of service to his little friend  He walked a long while up and down both stooping all the way and patting with his hand to try if he could feel it in the grass and had at last the happiness to find it  Watty too was happy and they set about the business which had brought them thither  Watty out of gratitude bestowed the finest flowers of those which he had gathered upon Eugene but paid no regard to Gerald who had refused to help him so that Eugene had that day also a finer bowpot than Gerald and came back as satisfied as he was discontented  Gerald supposed the third day he might prove more lucky He preceded Eugene and defied him to collect a finer bowpot than he should But hardly were they come into the meadow when behold the little boy who had  been fed by Eugene came to meet him with a basket full of flowers which it seems he had gathered that morning  Gerald would have begun to gather for himself but how was he to find the flowers The little boy had got up earlier by a deal than he and therefore he had still less flowers that day than either of the two preceding  They were going home but met little Watty  My dear friend said he to Eugene I have not forgot the service that you did me yesterday and have taken such a liking to you that I could wish to be at all times in your company Papa too though he never saw you has the same ideas in your favour and has bid me come and fetch you to his house this morning He designs to tell us merry stories and afterwards will play with us  I will take you to a garden here hard by us where we are allowed to walk and there you will find four or five companions of my age to welcome you when we are all together we will play at whatever game you like  Eugene instantly laid hold of Watty's hand and flew like lightning with him towards the garden As for Gerald poor fellow he went home quite melancholy Watty had not once invited him  He learned by these three days adventures but particularly by the last how much one gains by kindness and assistance granted to others He reformed his churlish temper and would certainly in time have shown himself as courteous to the full as Eugene if this last by having exercised a friendly disposition from his cradle had not conferred his favours with a greater grace  THE PRESENT  Mrs Maddison Viola her daughter  Viola  MAMA you know that my brother's birthday will come very soon and I do not know what present to make him I hope you will give me something to bestow upon him as a present on the occasion  Mrs Maddison  Doubtless I might easily do so but I should like much rather to present him with that something on my own account Do you imagine that I enjoy less pleasure than yourself in making presents And besides reflect that if I give you any thing in order that you may afterwards give it to your brother it is my gift not yours  Viola  That is true indeed mama and yet I should be very glad if I had any thing to give him  Mrs Maddison  Well then let us reflect a little How shall we proceed You cannot surely but have something by you as for instance your little orangetree  Viola  My little orangetree mama that bears such fine blossoms to ornament all my nosegays  Mrs Maddison  Well what think you of your lamb  Viola  O dear mama my lamb that loves and follows me so prettily  Mrs Maddison  Your doves then  Viola  I resolved you know to bring them up before they well had broken the shell so they are my children and I cannot part with them  Mrs Maddison  I see then that you have nothing to give your brother  Viola  Now I recollect I have  Mrs Maddison  And what  Viola  You know that purse which my aunt Teresa gave me for a Christmasbox last year you must own it is very pretty  Mrs Maddison  True my dear but do you think that your brother will be pleased with such a gift for not to mention that he can never wear it long I fancy you remember when you had it first you did not like it much yourself and put it carelessly into a drawer as what you had no wish to see again and this your brother knew and cannot but remember when you bring it out  Viola  But notwithstanding that mama it is still a very pretty present  Mrs Maddison  No my dear that only can be called a pretty present which we should be glad to keep and which they party so obliged would equally be glad to have  Viola  And must I give my brother every thing that I should be glad to keep  Mrs Maddison  No just as much or just as little as you please provided what you give appears to be a token of your friendship  Viola    after a little reflexion    Well well I will make up a nosegay of my finest orange blossoms and present it to Henry with my lamb  Mrs Maddison  Well fancied such a gift will shew him your affection since he knows that you would be very desirous to keep the lamb yourself  Viola  Nor yet mama is this the whole for every day I will take a walk out with my brother that the lamb may use itself to follow him as well as me The little creature in this manner will be quite familiar with my brother when I give him away and my brother will love him the better  Mrs Maddison  Come my dearest and embrace me Be assured this delicate attention will encrease the value of your present Thus the merest trifle may become a valuable object when bestowed with such a grace You could not give your brother or even me such joy with any other present  Nor myself mama replied Viola with vivacity  You will be happier still continued Mrs Maddison when once the birthday comes because as I must contribute something I intend that you shall perform the honours for me of a little cold collation to be served up in the garden for your brother and such friends as he may wish to have invited  Hearing this the little lady kissed her mother's hand with ardour and immediately ran off to make up half a dozen artificial roses with a crimson ribbon which she had by her And with those roses she intended to dress out the lamb on her brother's birthday when she made him so affectionate a present  THE CHIMNEYSWEEPER  A Silly servant maid had possessed the imagination of her master's children with a hundred foolish tales of spirits and particularly of a blackfaced goblin as she called it  Antonia one of these poor children for the first time in her life beheld a chimneysweeper knocking at her father's door She made a lamentable outcry and betook herself for refuge to the first apartment that she found open which apartment was the kitchen  Hardly had she hid herself behind a table when the blackfaced man came in as if in her imagination he had meant to follow her  This frightened her a second time and up she ran into a pantry higher than the kitchen floor by half a dozen steps and not a great way from the fire place where she thought she should be safe from danger in a corner  She had hardly come however to herself when suddenly she heard the frightful fellow singing in the chimney and with brush and scraper making all the while a rattling noise against the bricks about him  Being seized with terror she jumped up and leaping through a window which was rather low into the garden ran quite breathless towards an arbour at the bottom of it where she fell half dead and almost void of motion close beside a tree  Though she had changed her situation by so great a distance yet hardly did she venture to look about her when by chance she saw the blackfaced man appear again and wave his brush about him at the chimneytop  On this Antonia almost split her throat with crying out Help help  Her father heard the cry and running towards the arbour asked what ailed her that she cried out so Antonia had not strength sufficient to articulate a single word and therefore keeping silence pointed to the place where Grim was then sitting astride and flourishing his brush  Her father smiled and to convince her what small cause she had for terror waited till the chimneysweeper  was come down He then bade him be called and cleaned a little in Antonia's presence after which without explaining matters any further he sent up into the house to fetch his barber who it happened was then waiting for him and who consequently had his face all over white with powder  She was heartily ashamed of having feared so much without occasion and her father took this opportunity of giving her to understand that there were whole nations in a certain quarter of the globe all over black by nature but not therefore to be dreaded by white children since these last were in another country generally nursed by women purchased of those nations without losing any of their whiteness  Ever afterwards Antonia was the first to laugh at silly stories told by silly people of hobgoblins and the like to fright her  THE CHERRIES  JOHANNA and Felix one day got permission from their dear mama to take a turn or two about the garden by themselves they had deserved this confidence placed in them by their past discretion  They amused themselves by playing for a time together with that decent gaiety by which it is easy to distinguish young children who have been well brought up  Against the garden wall grew many fruittrees and among them a young cherrytree which had no earlier than the year before been grafted and was now in fruit Its fruit indeed was very little but on that account perhaps much the finer  Mrs Dutton their mother did not want to gather them though ripe She kept them for her husband's eating who that very day was to return from York where business had a long time kept him  As the children were accustomed to obedience and forbidden once for all to gather any kind of fruit or pick up even such as they might find upon the ground to eat  it without asking leave she thought it useless to say any thing about this cherrytree  When Johanna and Felix were fatigued with running up and down the terrace Come said Felix let us do something else now upon which they joined their hands and walked sedately towards the bottom of the garden casting every now and then a look of appetite upon the fruit with which the espaliers were loaded  They were soon come up to this late grafted tree A little blast of wind had shook the finest cherries from it and they lay upon the ground close by Young Felix was the first to see them He advanced his foot stooped down and picked them up ate some and gave Johanna some who are them likewise  They had not yet flung the stones away when as it chanced Johanna recollected her mama's command to eat no fruit but what she might think fit to give her  Ah said she to Felix we have disobeyed mama by eating any of these cherries and shall make her angry with us when she comes to know it What had we best do  Felix  Why need mama know any thing about it We may hold our tongues  Johanna  No no she needs must know it brother She frequently forgives us the greatest faults that we can commit when we confess them of ourselves  Felix  Yes yes but in this instance we have disobeyed her and she never yet forgave us disobedience  Johanna  When she punishes our faults I need not tell you brother it is because she loves us and in consequence of being punished we are not so very likely to forget as otherwise we should what we may do and what we may not  Felix  True but she is always sorry when she punishes our faults and being sorry she is unhappy so I should not like to see mama unhappy which would be the case did she but know what we have done  Johanna  Neither should I wish to see my mama unhappy but would she not be much more so upon discovering that we had wished to bide our faults Should we be bold enough to look her in the sate while we were secretly reproached by our own hearts or rather should we not be quite ashamed to hear her call us her dear children knowing as we must how little we deserve it  Felix  Ah my dearest sister you have quite convinced me and indeed we should in that case be two little monsters therefore let us go to her and acknowledge what we have done  They kissed each other and went hand in hand to their mama's apartment  Dear mama began Johanna we have disobeyed you and not remembered what you forbade us Punish me and Felix as we merit but pray do not be angry with us we should both be quite uneasy were our fault to make you sorry or unhappy  She related in the next place what her brother and herself had done without endeavouring to excuse the action  Mrs Dutton was so affected with the openness of Felix and Johanna that a tear of tenderness and love escaped her She could not resolve on punishing their fault but generously overlooked it She well knew that children of a happy disposition are more powerfully wrought on by the recollection of a mother's kindness than by that of her severity  THE LITTLE PRATER  LEONORA was endued with spirit and vivacity When scarcely six years old she was exceedingly well practised in the art of managing her needle and could very cleverly employ her scissars All the garters that her papa and brothers wore were of her making She could read with ease in any book that she happened to take up her writing was also extremely neat and fair She did not huddle great and little letters in one word together neither did they lean some this and others that way and her lines went strait along not dancing up and down from one side of her paper to the other as I have too often seen in many children's writingbooks even older by a year or two than Leonora  Her papa too and mama were no less satisfied with her obedience than her masters with her diligence and study She kept up a perfect union with her sisters treated every servant with the greatest affability and her companions with regard and condescension All her parents' friends  and every stranger that came there a visiting were equally enchanted with her company and conversation  Who would think that with so many recommendatory qualities and so much understanding any little girl could possibly be so unfortunate that none when they grew acquainted at the house could bear her Such was Leonora notwithstanding for a single fault which she had unhappily contracted was so great as to destroy the effect of all her juvenile accomplishments The intemperance of her tongue made every one forget the graces of her understanding and the goodness of her heart In short our Leonora was the greatest prater living  When for instance she was sitting down to work one might have heard her say Oho I fancy it is high time that I should be doing something What would my mama say should she find me sitting with my arms across a lolling on my elbowsO my stars how much I have got to hem here all this apron But at worst I never let the grass grow under me when I set out and I shall soon have done Ah there the clock strikes One two three four five six seven eight nineYes positively nine o'clock Well then I have but two poor hours before I go to music yet a deal of business may be done in such a length of time Mamma when she observes how diligent I have been will be sure to give me sweetmeatsOh what pleasure I shall have in looking at them Nothing do I love like nice crisped almonds Not that I do not like egg plumbs preserved they are very good too for papa popped one into my mouth last Thursday and then gave me a whole bagfull but I think crisped almonds betterI should like to see Miss Dolly this morning I would shew her the fine petticoat that mama has bought me Dolly is a funny little girl enough I like her vastly Oh but she loves talking and I do not know how it happens but one cannot thrust a word in when her clapper is set a going Where has my thimble hid itself Sister have you seen my thimble Patty must have surely lost it for me when she came to sweep the parlourIt is so like her she is always such a hairbrained creature Who can work without a thimble at least I never take a stitch if I mislay it for the needle pricks one's finger and one's finger bleeds of course and then besides the pain it gives one how one's work looks when it is spotted  with red marks Why Patty Patty where can you be Have you seen my thimble Oh no here it is and just as if the matter were contrived on purpose at the bottom of my workbag  Thus the little creature would be always dinning people's ears who happened to be near her When her parents were engaged in any interesting conversation with each other she would come and mix in their discourse by prating upon twenty different subjects And at dinner she had hardly ever ended with her meat before the pie or pudding was on the table She would really forget to eat and drink while everlastingly employed in prating  Her papa would frequently reprove her twenty times a day for this defect but all reproof was lost upon her neither would the greatest punishment produce a reformation in her conduct As it was not possible for any one to hear himself when she was by Miss Chatterbox was often sent to pass the morning all alone in her apartment During dinner they would put her at a little table by herself as distant from the company as they could place her Leonora seemed afflicted at this separation but was not a whit the more silent on that account She had always some subject of discourse were it even addressed only to herself and nevertheless she talked so loud every word that she said was heard for it was the same to her if any body was or was not by her and I verily believe that rather than be mute she would have entered into conversation with her knife and fork  From such a foolish habit what advantage did she obtain The story tells us only punishment and hatred If you should not be convinced of this by what I have already mentioned you will certainly be so when you read what follows  Once upon a time her parents were invited to go down into the country for a week or fortnight by a friend It was in autumn the weather was extremely fine and it is not easy to conceive what great abundance there was then of every kind of fruit pears apples nectarines and peaches  Leonora thought it was designed to make her of the party but stood very much surprised when her papa directing both her sisters to get ready for the journey told  her that she must stay at home She fell a crying ran to her mama and said My dear mama what fault have I committed that papa should be so angry with me Your papa she answered is not angry with you but believe me it is impossible for any one to bear your constant chatter You would certainly interrupt our pleasure and the pleasure of the family that we are now going to visit and therefore for the future whenever we go abroad we must always leave you behind us  Must I never speak then answered Leonora  That said her mama would be no less a fault than what we wish to see you cured of You are not to be entirely mute but then you ought to wait 'till you perceive that your turn for speaking is come round and not incessantly prevent your parents and as many as have more experience than yourself from talking You should also take care how you say whatever comes into your head When you desire to be informed of any thing which it is not improper you should know you ought to ask in as few words as possible and having any thing to tell you should in that case first of all reflect within yourself if those about you would or would not like to hear it  Leonora thought she could not reasonably call in question this advice would not have wanted words to justify her prating if she had not heard that moment her papa call out that every thing was ready and in fact the coach was off that very instant  Leonora fell a sighing and with tears pursued the carriage 'till her eye no longer could discern it When it was wholly out of sight she went into a corner and began to weep most bitterly Ah babbling gossip said she    now speaking to herself    it is all owing to my long tongue that I have been thus punished I will take care that for the future it shall never speak a word more than it ought  Some few days afterwards they returned Leonora's sisters brought home with them baskets full of pears and apples They were both exceedingly well tempered therefore Leonora would on no account have gone without her share but then the tears that she had been shedding  so completely took away her appetite that it is not to be wondered if she did not wish for any She that moment ran to her papa imploring his pardon for her fault in having forced him as she knew much against his will to punish her We have been both unhappy added she but for the future I shall take care and never speak too much  Her father tenderly embraced and kissed her  On the morrow Leonora was permitted to sit down and take her dinner with the rest She spoke very little but whatever she did say was full of grace and modesty It is true it cost her very much to check her tongue which through impatience and the itch of talking rolled if I may say so this and that way in her mouth but on the following day this work of checking her propensity towards talking was less painful and the next day still less so At length the difficulty by a gradual diminution was completely done away At present she has totally got rid of her bad habit and she figures in society with credit to herself and pleasure to her friends who are no longer vexed with what they were accustomed to entitle in derision her  incessant clack  HOT COCKLES  The Elder and Younger  The Younger  BROTHER all our friends have left us and yet still I am in a playing humour What game shall we chuse  The Elder  There are only two of us and I am afraid we should not be much diverted  The Younger  Let us play at something however  The Elder  But at what  The Younger  At blindman's buff for instance  The Elder  That is a game that would never end It would not be as if there were a dozen of which number some are generally off their guard but where there are  only two I should not find it difficult to shun you or you me and then when we had caught each other we should know for certain who it was  The Younger  That is true indeed Well then what think you of  Hot Cockles  The Elder  That would be the same you know We could not possibly guess wrong  The Younger  Perhaps we might However let us try  The Elder  With all my heart if it will please you Look ye if you like it I will be the  hot cockles  first  The Younger  Do brother Put your right hand on the bottom of this chair now stoop down and lay your face quite close upon it that you may not see That is well and now your left hand on your back Well master but I hope your eyes are shut  The Elder  Yes yes do not be afraid  The Younger  Well master what have you to sell  The Elder  Hot cockles hot  The Younger    slapping him    Who struck  The Elder    getting up    Why who you little goose but you  The Younger  Yes yes but with which hand  The eldest did not dream of such a question he was taken by surprize and said  the right  at hazardIt was with the left however that he had been struck and thus the youngest outwitted him  GOD's BIRD  Mrs Mortimer Paul and Edward her sons  Mrs Mortimer  MY dearest Edward what have you done with all your money  Edward  Given it away  Mrs Mortimer  Away my little fellow to whom  Edward  A very wicked boy  Mrs Mortimer  No doubt to make him better  Edward  Yes mama Pray don't the birds that fly about belong to God  Mrs Mortimer  They do as well as we ourselves and every other creature  Edward  Well mama this wicked boy had stolen a bird from God and carried it about to sell The little bird cried out with all its strength and he was pinching the beak close to hinder it from crying He was certainly afraid mama that God would hear it cry and punish him for so much naughtiness  Mrs Mortimer  And you my little man  Edward  And II gave the wicked boy my money purse and all that he might give God back again his birdI fancy God was very glad    He jumps about for joy    Mrs Mortimer  He was no doubt to find my little fellow have so good a heart  Edward  The boy perhaps was wicked dear mama because he wanted money  Mrs Mortimer  Yery likely  Edward  Therefore I am glad that I gave him mine because mama you know that I don't want money  Paul  We have had a sort of difference with each other upon this affair My brother gave his money without counting what it was though certainly it would have bought ten birds I told him that he should first have asked the boy how much would satisfy him  Edward  Which of us was in the right mama  Mrs Mortimer  Not you my heart  Edward  But have not you if you remember often said dear Edward do whatever good you can and ask no questions  Mrs Mortimer  I have often told you so indeed but then you should consider how to do it the best way you can To day for instance since you had more money than was necessary to deliver the poor little bird you should have kept the rest for such another purpose for if other wicked boys had come into your way as well as he did with God's birds and you had no more money tell me what you would have done  Edward  Why then mama I would have come to you for what I wanted  Mrs Mortimer  But if I had happened to have none  Edward  Ahthen so much the worse  Mrs Mortimer  You see then Paul gave you good  advice You are to save your money and not only for yourself but for others so that you may do all the good in your power with it Do you suppose my dear that there was no other bird than this in all the world to which you might have given assistance  Edward  I was thinking of no other thenI wish mama you had but seen how much he seemed at first to suffer and how glad he was afterwards when I let him fly away He was quite giddy with his joy he knew not where to go that he might clap his wings However dear mama the boy assured me for I made him promise that he would never try to catch it a second time  Mrs Mortimer  My little fellow you have notwithstanding done quite well and to reward you here is more money  Edward  Moreoh thank you  Mrs Mortimer  And a kiss into the bargain How rejoiced I am in being your mama With such an inclination as you have for doing good you need but study how to do it in a proper manner and you will prove the happiest creature in the world  THE SELFCORRECTED LIAR  LITTLE Griffith was now six years old and had never yet told a falsity He never had committed any fault and therefore had no need to hide the truth When any accident befel him as to break a pane of glass or spot his cloaths he went immediately and told his father who would be always so good as to forgive him with a caution that in future he should be more careful  Griffith had a cousin but a very naughty boy whose name was Robert Robert came one day to see him and Griffith by way of shewing his attention to his visitor made proposals for a game at drafts His cousin eagerly accepted the proposal on condition that they should play for something Griffith for a little time refused but in the end was wrought upon by Robert and in hardly more than thirty minutes all the money which he had been laying up  many weeks from his allowance was compleatly gone Affected with his loss poor Griffith got into a corner and began to cry while Robert fell a laughing and went home in triumph with his spoil  It was not long before poor Griffith's father who had been from home returned He loved the child and therefore sent to see him in the parlour But what ails you said he And what has happened Sure you have been crying  Griffith  Yes papa because my cousin has been here and made me play with him at drafts  The Father  And what of that I see no harm done yet for drafts are a diversion that I have given you leave to take But possibly you played for money  Griffith  O no no papa  The Father  Then why do you cry  Griffith  Because I wished to show my cousin how much money I had saved to buy myself a book Now I had hid it all behind the great stone post without and when I put my hand into the hole it was gone Some person passing by the gate has stolen it  Griffith's father some how or another fancied this recital to be false but did not mention his suspicions then He went that moment to his brother's and as soon as he saw little Robert he forced a smile and began in this manner  Well my child you have been lucky have not you today  Oh yes said Robert very lucky sir  And what did you win  A shilling said the nephew  What so much And did he pay you Robert  Doubtless uncle I have it in my pocket  Notwithstanding Griffith had deserved a grievous punishment his father thought it not amiss to pardon this as being his first falsehood and therefore only told him with a scornful tone of voice that since he knew that he had a liar in his house he would tell all the servants never to believe him whatsoever he should say  Some few days after Griffith went in turn to visit Robert and pulled out a handsome pencilcase which his sister had bestowed him at Christmas Robert wished to have it and in exchange would have been glad to  give him every one of his playthings his ball his top and rackets but as Griffith he observed would not part with it he began to play the bully put his arms akimbo and advanced towards him said "The pencil case is mine I lost it at your house or else you stole it" Griffith to no purpose earnestly protested that it was his sister's present Robert quickly let him see that he meant to force it from him and as Griffith grasped it with both hands he closed upon him threw him down got over him and with his double fist so pomelled Griffith in the face that he was forced to yield the case  Poor Griffith being treated in this manner posted home his nose all over blood and half his hair pulled off "Papa papa said he as soon as he was come within his father's hearing look how I have been used The naughty Robert has this moment robbed me of my pencilcase and handled me as you see"  But far from pitying him his father answered "Go you liar you have lost your pencilcase at drafts and to deceive me smeared your nose with mulberry juice and put your hair into disorder" Griffith solemnly protested to no purpose that he spoke only the truth" I cannot credit said the father one who has already proved himself a liar"  Griffith quite confounded went away into his chamber and bewailed most bitterly the consequences of his first untruth Next day he begged permission to appear before his father and implored forgiveness "I acknowledge said he how wicked I have been in seeking to deceive you with a falshood once but dear papa let me entreat you to give up your resolutions of believing me no longer when I even speak the truth  His father told me the other day that from that moment Griffith had not let the least untruth escape him and that therefore he had recompenced his son's veracity by trusting him implicitly He never looked for protestations from him it was sufficient Griffith barely told him any thing that he should take it for as great a certainty as if himself had seen it  What a satisfaction this to be experienced by a tender father and a son so worthy of him  RECEIPT TO BE ALWAYS PLEASED  I Should be very glad to play mama all day said Laura  Mrs Delwin  What  all  day  Laura  Oh yes mama  Mrs Delwin  I shall be very glad to give you any pleasure in my power my little Laura but I fear you will very soon be tired  Laura  Of playing Never You shall see that mama  And saying so the little Laura ran to fetch her playthings She had got them all together but was quite alone for both her sisters were that day to be employed with different masters till the afternoon  At first she played as she thought proper and was very happy for an hour or thereabout but by degrees the pleasure which she enjoyed began to lose a little of its power to please her  She had now handled her playthings twenty times or oftener and could tell no longer what to do Her favourite doll was grown quite troublesome and tedious to her  She desired her dear mama to shew her some new method of diversion and to play with her but unfortunately her mama had very pressing business and could not attend to her however she might wish to do so  Laura after this sat moping in a corner till her sisters had quite finished with their masters and were now about to take a little recreation She ran to them in a melancholy mood which was as much as mentioning how long their time of study had seemed to her and with what impatience she had wished to see them  They proposed immediately such games as they supposed most entertaining for they loved her greatly but alas all their solicitude was useless Laura could not but complain that every game which they mentioned had already tired her nay in her impatience she even ventured to accuse them of conspiring with each other to afford her such diversion only as they knew would not amuse her Upon which Miss Amelia her eldest sister  an extremely sensible young lady ten years old took Laura by the hand and with a smile began as follows  Look at us dear Laura and I will tell you which person in the room occasions your dissatisfaction  Laura  And who is it sister For my part I don't know  Amelia  The reason is you do not look at yourself Yes Laura you yourself occasion your dissatisfaction for you see these games amuse  us  still though we have played them over you may easily imagine before you were born but then we have been both at work and therefore are they in a manner new to us If you by previous study and attention had obtained an appetite for pleasure you would certainly have been pleased as casily as we are  Little Laura who however young she was by no means wanted understanding was so struck with these remarks as to discern that every one who would be happy should take care to mix improving exercise with pleasing recreation And indeed I know not whether after such experience gained the menace of a whole day's pleasure would not have more terrified her than that of a whole day's labour  THE TULIPS  LUCETTA had seen for two summers successively a bed of tulips in her father's garden which were streaked with the most beautiful colours  Like the fluttering butterfly she often roved from flower to flower being struck merely with their beauty but never reflecting to what they owed their origin  Last Autumn she saw her father amuse himself with digging up the bed and planting tulip roots Ah papa cried she in a whimpering tone what are you doing Will you spoil all our fine tulip bed so and instead of those fine flowers that grew there put nasty onions in it for the kitchen  Her father answered her that he knew what he was about and he was going to tell her that from those onions would come forth new tulips the following year but  Lucetta interrupted him by her complaints and would listen to nothing  When her father saw that he could not make her understand reason he left her to pacify herself and continued his work while she retired sobbing  During the Winter as often as the conversation turned upon flowers Lucetta sighed and thought within herself how great a pity it was that her father had destroyed the finest ornament of the garden Winter finished its course and Spring came next to sweep the snow and ice off the ground  Lucetta had not entered the garden yet Indeed it would have been difficult to prevail on her to go in as it was deprived of her favourite flower One day however she entered without thinking But what were her transports of surprize and joy when she saw the tulip bed still more beautiful than the preceding year She stood still at first motionless and silent with admiration at length she threw herself into her father's arms crying Ah dear papa I thank you for plucking up those nasty onions and for putting in their place those sweet flowers that I am so fond of  Yo owe me no thanks answered her father for these sweet flowers that you are so fond of sprung from nothing else but my nasty onions  The obstinate Lucetta would not believe a word of it upon which her father pulled up carefully one of the finest tulips together with the bulbous root resembling an onion from which the stalk grew and presented it to her  Lucetta quite confounded asked pardon for having been so unreasonable I pardon you my dear child with all my heart replied her father provided you acknowledge how easy it is for children to deceive themselves when they attempt to judge after their ignorance of the actions of people who have had experience  Oh yes papa answered Lucetta I am convinced of that and therefore for the future shall distrust my own eyes and whenever I shall be tempted to suppose that I know more of the matter than other people I will think of the Tulips and the Onions  I am very glad my dear little friends that I had it in my power to tell you this story for you will presently see what happened to another child who had never heard it  THE STRAWBERRIES AND CURRANTS  ALLAN had frequently heard his father say that children were without the least degree of knowledge touching what was proper for them and that all the wisdom which they could possibly prove themselves to possess lay in following the advice of people older than themselves And yet he never had sincerely wished to understand this doctrine or perhaps to speak as favourably as the matter will allow had forgot it  His indulgent father had allotted him and Prospero his brother a convenient piece of ground that each might have a little garden and display his industry and knowledge in the cultivation of it And not only this but they had leave to sow whatever seed they thought proper or to take any treeroot already growing in their father's garden and transplant it  Prospero remembered the instruction of his father went to have a little conversation on this subject with Ralph the gardener and began thus Pray tell me what I ought to sow at present in my garden and how set about my work  The gardener gave him several roots and seeds adapted to the season Prospero that moment ran and put them in the ground and Ralph was so kind as to assist him in the work and to give him some instruction  But Allan seeing Prospero's docility shrugged up his shoulders Ralph not observing this contemptuous action asked if he should give him some assistance and instruction likewise  Yes replied Allan I have great occasion to be sure of your assistance and instruction particularly the last  On this he went into his father's garden and selecting for his own a quantity of flowers transplanted them immediately The gardener let him do as he thought fit  Next morning when Allan visited his garden all the flowers which he had so lately planted hung their heads like mourners at a funeral and as he saw were dying He transplanted others from his father's garden which the morning after he observed with much vexation were exactly in the same condition  He was very soon disgusted with this sort of work It was paying very dear we must acknowledge for the pleasure of possessing a few flowers Of course he gave it up and it was not long before his piece of ground was overrun with weeds and thistles  Towards the middle of the Spring as he was looking at his brother's garden he saw something red suspended very near the ground which on examination he discerned to be strawberries and found to have an exquisite degree of flavour  Ah said he if I had planted strawberries in my garden  Some time after likewise he saw certain little berries of a milk white colour that hung down in clusters from the branches of a bush upon examination they were currants which to look at only was a banquet  Ah said he again if I had planted currants in my garden  Eat as many as you like said Prospero as if they were your own  It rested with yourself and no one else remarked the gardener to have had as good so never for the future treat with scorn the assistance and instruction which any one may offer you who is possessed of greater knowledge and experience than yourself  OBLIGINGNESS AND COMPLAISANCE  EMILIA Victoria Juliet and Sophia had a governess who loved them with the fondness of a mother This governess was called Mademoiselle Beaufoy  Her greatest wish was that her pupils should be virtuous in order to be happy that a friendship for each other should increase the pleasures of their childhood and that they should taste those pleasures without diminution or anxiety  A kind indulgence and exact degree of justice towards them were the constant motives of her conduct whether she had any thing to pardon to reward or punish in them  She enjoyed with infinite delight the pleasing fruits of her instruction and example  The four little girls began to be the happiest children upon earth They told each other of their faults forgave each other shared together of each other's joys and could not live without each other  Alas by what fatality do children poison the source of their own enjoyments at the very moment when they begin to taste its charms and how great is their happiness when they are placed under the eye of a person endowed with equal prudence and tenderness  It happened Mademoiselle Beaufoy was forced to leave her pupils for a time as certain family concerns obliged her to visit France She left them with reluctance made a sacrifice of some advantages to the desire of quickly settling her affairs and hardly had a month expired when she returned in safety to her little flock  They all received her with the greatest signs of joy but alas what an unhappy alteration did she very soon perceive in these poor little children  If as frequently it happened any one among them asked the slightest favour of another the latter illnaturedly refused it and hence followed discontent and quarrels the uncommon gaiety that hitherto had been remarkable in all their little sports and made their work itself delightful was now changed to peevishness and melancholy and instead of those expressions dictated by peace and friendship which were before heard in all their conversations nothing now prevailed among them but incessant bickerings Did either wish to take an hour's diversion in the garden her sisters were sure to assign some reason for remaining in their chamber And in short it was enough that any thing should meet the wish of one among them to displease the others  It particularly chanced one day that not contented to deny each other every sort of friendship and obligingness they mutually distressed each other with reproaches Mademoiselle Beaufoy who sat as a witness of this sceneâ–ª was so affected by it as even to shed tears  She could not speak a word and pensively withdrew into her chamber that she might the better think upon the means of rendering back to these unhappy little ones  the pleasures which they had lost of their former friendship and reciprocal attachment  She was still employed in this afflicting task when all the four young ladies entered her apartment with a peevish and uneasy look complaining that they could be no longer happy in each other's company There was not one of them but charged the rest with causing it and all together earnestly desired their governess to restore them if possible to their lost happiness  The governess received them in a very serious mannerâ–ª saying I observe my children you obstruct each other in your pleasures therefore that this circumstance may never come to pass again let each take up her corner in this very room if she thinks proper and divert herself in any way that she likes but so as not to interfere with either of her sisters You may have recourse to this new mode of recreation instantly as you have leave to play till night but each remember in her corner as I said just now  The little girls were charmed with this proposal took their places and began to play  Sophia entered into conversation with her doll or rather told her many little stories but her doll could not reply and had no stories in her turn to tell It was in vain to look for any entertainment from her sisters they were playing each asunder in their corners  Juliet took her battledore and shuttlecock yet none applauded her dexterity besides she would gladly have struck it across the room but in that case there was nobody to send it back It was in vain to hope such service from her sisters they were playing each asunder in their corners  Emilia could have wished to pass the time that now hung heavy on her at a game of which she was very fond  hunt the slipper  but alas who was there to pass the slipper from hand to hand It was in vain to ask her sisters they were playing each asunder in their corners  And Victoria who was very skilful as a little housewife thought how she might give her friends an entertainment and of course send out for many things to market But who was to receive her orders It was in vain to pitch upon her sisters they were playing each asunder in their corners  It was just the same with every other play All of them supposed that it would be compromising matters to approach each other and therefore they disdainfully continued in their solitude At length the day concluded They returned again to Mademoiselle Beaufoy and begged her to shew them a better sort of amusement than that which she had already recommended  I can only think of one my children answered she which you yourselves knew very well formerly but which it seems you have now forgotten Yet if you wish to put it once more into practice I can easily remind you of it  Oh we wish to recollect it with all our hearts replied they and stood all attention to seize with ardour the first word that their governess should utter  It is answered she that reciprocal obligingness that mutual friendship which sisters owe to each other O my dearest little friends how miserable have you contrived to make yourselves and me too since you lost it  She stopped short when she had uttered these few words which yet were interrupted frequently by sighs while tears of tenderness ran down her cheeks  The little girls appeared astonished and struck dumb with sorrow and confusion in her presence She held out her arms they rushed at once affectionately towards her and sincerely promised that they would love each other for the future and agree as they had done before she left them  From that moment they betrayed no signs of peevishness to trouble their harmonious intercourse Instead of bickerings and discontent amongst them nothing now was known but mutual condescensions which delighted all who had the opportunity of being with them  They preserve this amiable character at present in the world among their friends of whom they are acknowledged to be the delight and ornament  THE LINNET'S NEST  MAMA mama cried out little Sam one evening running out of breath into the parlour see see what I have here in my hat  Mrs Baxter  Ha ha a linnet Where did you get it  Sam  I happened to find a nest in the morning as I passed along the white thorn hedge below the fishpond And waiting till the evening I crept along the hedge as softly as I could and slap before the bird could be aware of me caught him by the wings  Mrs Baxter  Was he by himself then in the nest  Sam  No no the little ones were in it too But they are so little yet that they have not got their feathers Oh they can't escape me  Mrs Baxter  And what do you intend to do with this linnet  Sam  Put it in a cage mama  Mrs Baxter  And with the young ones  Sam  Oh I'll take the young ones too and rear them I will run now and fetch them  Mrs Baxter  I am sorry Sam but you will not have time to get them  Sam  Oh it is not far off Don't you know the Windsor peartree Well it is close by that I have taken care to mark the place  Mrs Baxter  But that is not the matter What I mean is that our neighbour Justice Sharp has sent to take you up The constables are very likely come and at the door  Sam  The constables to take me up  Mrs Baxter  Yes yes to take you up The justice has your father in custody already and the constables who took him told us that they would soon come back for you with Kitty Bell and Sally and then carry you all four to prison  Sam  Oh dear me And what does he design to do with us  Mrs Baxter  You will be shut up in a little room and not have permission to come out a moment  Sam  Oh the wicked justice  Mrs Baxter  However he will not do you any harm They will give you every day good things to eat and drink You will have nothing to complain of but your loss of freedom and the pleasure of seeing me    Sam begins to cry    Well what is the matter with you Is confinement such a great misfortune if they give you every thing that you want    Sam cannot speak for sobbing    The justice treats your father sisters and yourself as you would treat the linnet and its young You cannot call him wicked therefore as you do without confessing that you are so yourself  Sam    sobbing    Oho I will let the linnet fly mama this instant    He opens his hat and the bird flies out at the window    Mrs Baxter    taking him into her arms    Be of comfort my dear Sam for I only meant to give you some instruction by this little story of the justice neither will your father or your sisters or yourself be sent to prison All I wished was to convince you how wicked it would be to shut up the poor little bird As much as you appeared afflicted when I told you that they would take you up so much the little bird  was  certainly when you deprived him of his liberty Conceive how much the cock would have lamented to be parted from the hen the young ones from their mother and the mother from her young ones This I am sure you did not think of otherwise you never would have taken him Tell me would you  Sam  Never dear mama I did not once think of all this  Mrs Baxter  Well think of it for the future and forget not that birds as well as every other creature were created to enjoy their liberty and that it would be cruel to fill up with sorrow that short period of existence which God has granted them and to remember this the better you should get by heart a little piece of poetry that your friend has written  Sam  What the Children's Friend Oh pray repeat it to me  THE LINNETS  I HOLD it fast this linnet's nest  With one two three four young ones in it  Long did I watch you without rest  But pris'ners made you in a minute  Cry little rebels as you please  And flap your wings but vain you'll find it  You cannot get away with ease  So stay with me and never mind it  But don't I hear their mother's cries  Deplore the durance that has bound them  Yes and their father likewise flies  Sadly complaining round and round them  And shall I cause them so much pain  Who us'd to go last spring and hear them  From you broad oak pour down their strain  While the whole grove was music near them  Alas if from my mother I  Were violently to be parted  I know with sorrow she would die  Or if she liv'd live brokenhearted  Should I then cruel spoiler tear  Those innocents from her who bore them  No I'll not doom you to despair  Take back your young I here restore them  Teach them in some o'erarching glade  Round you from morn till night to hover  Learning to harmonize the shade  Throat answering throat and lover lover  So will I come and sit next year  With the first dawn till day's descending  Under the oak and feast my ear  While their soft notes are sweetly blending  THE DESERTER  A DRAMA in Three ACTS  CHARACTERS  MOORHOUSE  a Publican  GRACE  his Wise  GEORGE  their Son  a Corporal  TRUNNION  his Comrade  THOMAS  Moorhouse's Brother  STEWARD  CAPTAIN  SERJEANT  During the two first acts the scene is laid in the Publican's house but changes to a prison in the last  ACT I  SCENE I  Moorhouse entering Grace spinning with a distaff and spindle    Moorhouse  HERE is a soldier coming Grace  Grace    letting fall her spindle    A soldier What are we to do Our trade gone and a soldier quartered on us  Moorhouse  After all perhaps though it is not likely that he should help us he will have more compassion on our poverty than richer folks A soldier's character my dear is much misrepresented he has far more conscience than a steward who is hardened to oppress the poor by dint of habit while a soldier is often thinking of another life as he has death before him often  SCENE II  Moorhouse Grace Trunnion  Trunnion  Save you I am come to be your guest See here is the billets it is for two Another is on the road  Moorhouse  We would entertain you soldier with all our hearts but we really have not the means Though we keep a publichouse yet trade is so dead that we cannot renew our licence which is almost out We signified as much to Justice Parsons in the neighbourhood and begged that no soldiers might be sent us but he answered till our licence was expired we must be looked upon as publicans and take the consequence Indeed we have hardly now a single customer the house is deferted and our stock of liquor out to the very last drop  Trunnion  But for heaven's sake my good people tell me how you live without a bit of fire  Grace  When one has got no fuel and no money to buy any  Trunnion  For my part I must have some to warm me and a bit of dinner likewise Have you any thing to give me  Grace  Nothing not so much as bread We live from hand to mouth and when we get one meal cannot tell when we shall have another If you do not believe me take a look about the house and see if you discover any thing but poverty within it  Trunnion  No no I believe and pity you I have a little money in my pocket which I cannot do better than share with you My good friend here is a shilling and some halfpence go buy us something good to eat you shall take a bit along with us but first a little wood  Moorhouse  You are very kind I will run immediately    He goes out    SCENE III  Trunnion Grace  Trunnion  And in the mean time with your leave good mother I will examine how my arms are  Grace  With my leave good friend Do what you please you are welcome    Aside    My husband is right soldiers are much better christians than too many gentlefolks    To Trunnion    My son is a soldier likewise  Trunnion  In what regiment  Grace  Colonel Sheffield's  Trunnion  What is his name then  Grace  George Moorhouse Heaven knows if he be still alive I have not heard about him for these four years  Trunnion  Do not you be uneasy my good woman he is still living  Grace  Dear sir do you know him then  Trunnion    embarrassed    I can't tell that but I suppose he is living as he came of such good folks  Grace  Ah that is no reason  Trunnion  But I wish your husband were returned If I had but the wood I would make a fire My comrade is rather boisterous and will certainly be angry if he does not find things ready when he comes  Grace  Oh you will excuse us A good word from you will pacify him  Trunnion  Words will not do with him and besides he is a corporal I must not speak to him as I please  SCENE IV  Trunnion Grace Moorhouse  Moorhouse    throwing down a faggot    Here is some wood and a nice bit of meat and turnips that a gardener gave me I have brought you back a little change too  Trunnion  Keep that to buy us some small beer I thought to have had a pint of porter but my family is increased and so my liquor must be weaker  Grace  Come my dear open the faggot and I will make a fire the gentleman says that his comrade is rather hasty  Trunnion  Yes and being a noncommissioned officer besides he will expect things to be as they should He is giving orders in the company otherwise he would have been here before now Ah here he comes  SCENE V  Trunnion Grace Moorhouse George  George  Well is dinner ready Make haste goodpeople  Moorhouse  It is not our fault good sir that matters are no forwarder Your comrade will inform you so  Trunnion    in a whisper to George    Come finish this child's play and tell them who you are    To Grace    Consider this young man good mother  George  Do not you recollect me  Grace    after having looked at George with attention    Heavens can it be George  George  Yes yes it is dear mother Oh what pleasure to behold you after such long absence  Moorhouse  Is it possible my son Oh welcome dear dear boy a thousand times  Grace    embracing him    I see you then once more before I die Heaven be praised  Moorhouse  And how have you contrived to live so many my dear son are dead but you in safety  George  Yes and yet I have never been deficient in my duty I owe it certainly to your prayers that I have escaped safe and sound from all dangers I find I am quartered on you Are you sorry for it  Moorhouse  Can you ask if we are sorry since the day you left us we have never been so happy  Grace    whispering Trunnion    My good friend you told me something of a corporal I think  Trunnion  Why George is a corporal Don't you see it  Moorhouse  Then you are promoted but how came that about You could not read  George  My captain had me taught  Moorhouse  Oh what a charming man this captain must be  Grace  Let them tell us now that soldiers are not special people  Trunnion  I will answer for it George will soon be higher than a corporal    To George    But how came you not to tell me when you saw the billet that you were quartered on your father  George  Comrade I was so full of my joy that I could not speak  Grace  How long are you to stay with us  George  Two days We halt here  Moorhouse  I am glad of that my dear boy we shall have time to talk of a few matters  Trunnion  Well well I can see you have enough to talk of these three hours or more perhaps so mother shew me where to make the fire and dress the meat I will do the whole myself  Grace  At least I will help you my good sir  Trunnion  No no you have enough to do with George so do but shew me to your kitchen then you may come back and talk together at your ease  Grace  Since you will have it so  SCENE VI  Moorhouse George  George  Then father you are not at your ease  Moorhouse  At our ease Oh no Our trade is fallen from us and in short these two years past it is wonderful how we subsist  George  But how is that possible you that were formerly so well to live  Moorhouse  You have reason to be surprized at it knowing as you do how laborious we always were and that we did no  manage like one half of our neighbours who do not know how to lay by any thing against a rainy day However we have had severe losses since you left us and now the worst of it is that we are indebted to our landlord upwards of four pounds We cannot pay it and the steward threatens every day to turn us out of doors in which case we must beg our bread  George  Just Heavens could I have thought to find you in so sad a situation  Moorhouse  We should never have been in it had the steward not contrived to make you as he did a soldier It was wholly a contrivance on his part of which I will tell you the particulars some other opportunity When he was nothing but a bailiff and had scarce a coat to wear I would not lend him money and it was then that he first of all began to hate us And at length he has compleated his revenge Our house is to be sold and you will not possess a groat belonging to your father  George  If you had but something to subsist on I should not regard myself Here is all the money that I possess  I give it you with tears because I have no more to spare you  Moorhouse  May heaven repay it to you a hundred fold my dear child This will keep us a few days  George  Let me think a little Cannot I speak with this same steward  Moorhouse  He will be here this very day  George  Then I will be sure to tell him something that may do you good The king is coming to review our regiment so you shall go and tell him your sad situation  Moorhouse  I go tell him I should not be able to pronounce a word before him I should stand stock still or perhaps run away through fear and terror were I forced into his presence  George  Never fear he would return you a kind answer I was once a centinel at Windsor on the Terrace when the king was walking there it was upon a Sunday evening I shall never sure forget with what familiarity he spoke to people but that is nothing for he met one morning with a poor man's child as he was walking through the town and entering into conversation found him such a clever little fellow that he ordered him a guinea when the father heard it he was ever on the watch to fall in with his majesty as he was walking out He proved at last so fortunate as to obtain a hearing when he thanked him for the guinea upon which the king would you believe it ordered him another guinea for his gratitude as he particularly mentioned  Moorhouse  You don't tell me so  George  Believe me I would much rather have to speak with him than many of our officers  Moorhouse  What a gracious king  George  There cannot be a better So pray hear what I intend to do I will get our quartermaster to write me a petition and though possibly you should have twenty miles to walk no matter  Moorhouse  And what think you will the king do for us  George  I cannot tell exactly but we will talk further about it tomorrow In the mean time be assured dear father it is much more agreeable to have to do with great than little people Come let us take a turn or two together through the village  ACT II  SCENE I  Moorhouse Grace George standing near a table  Grace  We have no more than two plates  George  No matter mother Our provider will be with us very shortly  Moorhouse  What a deal of pains he takes on our account  George  You do not know him yet next to fighting he likes nothing half so well as cooking here he comes  Trunnion    entering with the meat and turnips dressed    Here my friends Here is what will warm our stomachs this cold weather I have made a little broth and take a soldier's word you will find it excellent So let us sit down but first say graceCome help yourselves They say there is no such thing as eating broth without a spoon and so here is mine    He takes a knife and spoon out of his pocket    Moorhouse  I am very glad of that we have but two    They help themselves    Grace    to Moorhouse    The broth is excelient  Moorhouse  I have not eat so good these many years  George  Do not spare it then To say the truth I have tasted worse  Grace  We would never wish for better as long as we live nay nor yet so good except on Sundays  George  Well let us now begin upon the meat  Trunnion    to Moorhouse    But how is this my friend you have no plate  Grace  Oh never mind one plate will serve us both  Trunnion  Here is mine  Moorhouse  By no means  Trunnion  I can make myself a plate    He cuts a slice of bread and puts his meat upon it    We should be finely off in camp if we were forced to wait for plates  George  But father you do not eat what ails you  Moorhouse  Ah  Trunnion  What makes you sigh  Moorhouse  I cannot help sighing to reflect I should have treated George at my expence on his return but was without a bit of bread to give him  George  Pray do not talk at this rate father  Trunnion  No no do not even think about it Come your health    he drinks    Now you good friend  Moorhouse    taking the mug    Come here is our benefactor's health and many blessings on him for his kindness    Drinking    Grace  Oh a thousand blessings    drinking    George  Comrade my hearty thanks to you for this day's friendship shewn my parents  Trunnion  Do you wish to make me proud You drink my health as if I had won a battle  Moorhouse  Ay and you deserve we should You have yourself but little and part with it for our sakes    A knock without    Grace  Who's there  SCENE II  Moorhouse Grace George Trunnion the Captain Serjeant  George  Our captain  Serjeant    with a pocketbook in his hand    How many are you here  George    rising    Two    They all rise    The Captain  Very well Do not stir and you too my good people keep your seats make no ceremony I am charmed to see so much harmony and cordiality amongst you Have you    to Moorhouse    any complaint against these men  Moorhouse  Oh no sir if they are satisfied with us  The Captain    to George    Do you like your quarters  George  Sir I am quartered with my father it is my comrade's part to answer  Trunnion  We have every thing that we desire  The Captain    to Moorhouse    What is this young man your son you are very happy then for I can tell you all the regiment love him    He looks round about him    I am afraid your circumstances are not of the easiest but you are rich in having such a son  George  I thank you captain for reserving this favourable  testimony of me for the ears of my parents and shall so behave myself I hope that they may never lose the happiness that it affords them  Moorhouse  O good sir my bosom overflows with joy  Grace  We should be happier captain could you  et him stay with us  Moorhouse  What wise to die of hunger Would you think it sir this generous soldier though a stranger to us bought the dinner that we have been eating otherwise we should not have had bread to give our son We have lost our custom and besides our landlord for about four pounds that we owe him  The Captain  Threatens perhaps to turn you out of doors The case alas is far too common and I pity you sincerely Here is a piece of gold that I chance to have about me it will be of some assistance to you George this is what your conduct has deserved for it is on your account I give it to your parents  George  Ah my generous captain if you knew how serviceable such a gift is you would say yourself that I never can repay you as I ought  Moorhouse  God only can repay such bounty  Grace  May he grant you many years of happiness If I had twenty children I would let you have them every one with pleasure  The Captain  Good woman you repay my kindness very much indeed One child is valuable to a parent and you would give me twenty but I interrupt your dinner Farewell good people I will come once again and see you if I can before we go  Serjeant  Trunnion be ready for the next relief the guard will turn out very soon  SCENE III  Moorhouse Grace George Trunnion  Trunnion    drinking    Long live our noble captain  George  So I say indeed for he has saved us all from dying  Moorhouse  He yet never saw us and we get a piece of gold who could have thought that a stranger would compassionate our situation when we are treated with so much barbarity by those that know us  Grace  O the blessed gentleman but how much is it  worth    looking at the piece of gold    It must be of pretty large value  Moorhouse  Good heavens could I suppose that I should ever stand in such need of a single piece of money What is it Do you know its value George  George  I never saw so large a piece  Trunnion  It is more I am certain than a guinea but I cannot tell now muchStay let me seeOh now I recollect It is what they call a sixandthirty there are several now going about They come from Portugal it is nearly worth two guineas  Grace  What two guineas almost half our debt if the steward would take this in part it would make us easy  Moorhouse  I hope he will give us a little time for the remainder  Grace  Do you think that is likely I should be content to live upon dry bread till next winter provided we were not obliged to leave our house  George  Do not be uneasy mother I will try what I can do with him  Grace  We stood so much in fear of soldiers and a soldier is now our guardian angel God's good providence be praised for this repast and the assistance that he has sent us    They all rise    Trunnion  Well now I will put every thing away  Grace  Yes truly should I let you Rest yourself I will do that myself  Trunnion  No no it is part of my employ I will have you recollect the day we quartered in your little cot as long as you both live  Grace  There is no resisting you    Trunnion takes the things out    I am not surprized that the women are so fond of soldiers they must make such husbands they do all the work themselves and with so much dexterity but I must follow or he will wash the plates    She is going but returns    Ah here is brother Thomas Let us observe if he will remember George  SCENE IV  Moorhouse Grace George Thomas  Grace    to Thomas    Look brother here is a young man come to see us Don't take him for a common  soldier though Have you any knowledge of him or you George have you go to him it is your uncle Thomas  George  Just as if I did not recollect him  Thomas  I your unclelet me seeNoYesYes he himself My nephew as I live    they embrace    One need not ask about your health you look so very well  George  I hope dear uncle you are as well as I am  Grace  I could wish you did but know how much his captain praises him I wish I could stay and tell you but I am forced to go or I believe our cook would set the house to rights from top to bottom  SCENE V  Moorhouse Thomas George  Thomas  I rejoice dear nephew with all my heart to see you safe come home however trust me if you have not heard the whole already you could never have returned to find us more unhappy We are all as poor as if the country had been pillaged  Moorhouse  And our landlord's wicked steward too would gladly if he could suck out the little blood that is left us  George  You no longer need have any fear of him as you can pay down half the sum that you owe him He must needs be patient till such time as you can pay the rest  Moorhouse    letting Thomas see his piece of gold    See brother see what George has got me  Thomas    to George    Did you save it from your pay or is it plunder  George  Neither one nor the other it is a present from my captain who was here just now  Moorhouse  It is to George however that I am obliged for it his captain gave it me because he had behaved himself so well  Thomas  In truth I am so much better pleased because a soldier who would lay up such a deal of money from his slender pay must certainly deprive himself of many little  comforts in this life and as to plunder justify it how you will it is always villainously got and never prospers  George  That was what I always thought and therefore never would go pillaging indeed with all the plunder that others got I found they were not richer than myself but on the contrary spent half their time in the black hole being always guilty of some crime or other after they had been a robbing for it was nothing else whereas my officers were never troubled with complaints of me  Thomas  I easily believe you All your family are honest people and you would not I am sure have been the only goodfornothing fellow of the number We are poor indeed but have the fear of God before our eyes and that is much better than the greatest riches  Moorhouse  Yes and if the steward  Thomas  Softly brother here he comes  SCENE VI  Moorhouse George Thomas the Steward  The Steward  Well Moorhouse tomorrow is just at hand You are ready I suppose to pay your rent or else to quit your house  Moorhouse  I cannot my good sir pay more than half nor should I have been able to do that if Providence had not assisted me Be so indulgent as to wait till harvest for the rest and do not compleat my ruin by distressing me still further than I am distressed already  The Steward  y distressing you the common cant the more one does the more one may for such as you How long pray has not this same rent of yours been growing yet my lord distresses you and why because at last he tells you that he will have his money  Moorhouse  But is half of what we owe him nothing Take that half let me beseech you and entreat my lord in our behalf  The Steward  Yes yes intreat him to let you lead him by the nose another twelve month I shall hardly  do so therefore pay the whole or else I seize that's certain  George  Oh a little mercy my good sir and think that with a single word you have it in your power to make my father happy If there's nothing goes unpunished in this world 'tis surely no small matter to reduce an honest man to heggary  The Steward  Mind your musquet and not my affairs  George  My musquet sir belongs to the king and I shall take care of it without your instructions If the king were here present he would not take it amiss that I should speak for my parents and yet I think there is some difference between you and him  The Steward  Mr Soldier you may have seen service as they call it but remember that you are not talking now to some boor whom you have plundered and have at your mercy  George  I never talked to any man as I think I should to you    now I know your disposition    were I to meet you in an enemy's country  The Steward  You will never have that satisfaction  Thomas  Excuse a soldier's bluntness my good sir  The Steward  Hold your tongue likewiseI have you down in my papers I believe  Thomas  I am sure you have and not me only but all honest people  The Steward  What do you mean by that  SCENE VII  Moorhouse George Thomas the Steward Grace Trunnion  Grace  The steward here  Moorhouse  Be quiet wifeFor Heaven's sake let me beg you Mr Steward  The Steward  All your prayers are useless and tomorrow you shall set out on your travels  Grace  You will surely have some pity on us We shall soon get work Here is half your money and our house will still be standing for the other half if we should break our word  The Steward  Still standing you may burn it but if not I must obey the orders of his lordship  George  Has his lordship ordered you to ruin a whole family for what my father owes him You are paid to take whatever care you can of his affairs and by proceeding as you would you do not earn your wages Therefore take my counsel and for once fulfil your duty  The Steward  Will you tell me what my duty is you may keep your counsel to yourself I tell you that  George  And you I tell you may be civil  The Steward  Who taught you all this impudence  Trunnion  Suppose yourself a moment in this young man's situation He is a soldier and a soldier always knows what he is to say a thousand times better at least than any steward You have dared before his face to tell his father that he shall go upon his travels We all know the meaning of that phrase and would you have him stand there like a post before you without having the spirit to open his lips Who could keep his temper if he saw his family on the point of being ruined by an illnatured our of your stamp We know what stewards are and how they make fortunes This young man spoke to you civilly at first and you slighted him He is in the right now to speak the truth to you  The Steward  This is past bearing    turns in a violent rage to Moorhouse    Are you disposed to pay I ask you but once more  Moorhouse  I have told you that it is not in my power  Grace  And offered you the little that we have  The Steward  I will have the whole or nothingIf it is not sent tomorrow you shall hear from me  George    stopping him    Once more  The Steward  Let me go I'll not have any thing to do with such a ragamuffin  George    striking him    Ragamuffin You are speaking to a soldier sir take that and out with you Old rascal get you gone    he pushes him out    The Steward  Oh vengeance vengeance  SCENE VIII  Moorhouse Grace Thomas George Trunnion  Grace  George my dear George what have you done  Moorhouse  We are ruined  George  Do not be frightened father Had you wept even blood he would not have relaxed I never struck a man before but I was never called a ragamuffin in my life till now Could I be a soldier had I borne it  Trunnion  If you had not struck him I was ready to strike you  Moorhouse  Who knows what it may cost us  George  What because I would not be insulted  Grace  It was very wrong in you for notwithstanding he insulted you yet still you should have recollected that he is my lord's steward  George  Pshaw he is not the first of his profession that has undergone a soldier's vengeance I for my part think it perfect sympathy that when a soldier sees a rogue he naturally knocks him down  Grace  I can't help thinking we should certainly have softened him at last  George  No trust me never  Grace    to Moorhouse    What think you my love It will be much better for us to go after him  George  It would be useless  Moorhouse  That may be but I am resolved it shall not be said that I have left any means untried So Grace let us go together  George  Well since you will go let it be so but if he yields I'll eat my hat  Moorhouse  Come wife let us try this only method left us and Heaven's will be done if it should fail  Grace  Sure since we have struggled through life thus far Providence will not let us perish with hunger at last  Trunnion  Your mother I can see has all her necessary consolations ready when she wants them I will go see on my side what our comrades are doing  SCENE IX  George Thomas  George  And do you think uncle that I have exposed my parents to the steward's malice more by my behaviour than they were already  Thomas  Trust me so I fear though it was bad enough before between them And yet nephew they might certainly have mended their affairs last week if they had only had a little less compassion  George  How dear uncle  Thomas  They discovered a deserter but would not inform against him notwithstanding the reward  George  Indeed  Thomas  The blacksmith here hard by was not so scrupulous and got the money  George    to himself    A deserter a thought strikes me    To Thomas    O uncle I can save my father if I please but must have your assistance May I trust you  Thomas  Certainly  George  But can you keep a secret  Thomas  I have always thought I could  George  Whatever happens  Thomas  Yes provided there is no wickedness in the affair  George  None uncle  Thomas  Well then speak  George  But were you to betray me  Thomas  It must sure be some extraordinary matter  George  Yes but you will have no reason to fear any thing  Thomas  Well come then to the purpose  George  I will desert this very night You shall secure me and get forty shillings by it which will nearly pay my father's debt  Thomas  I fancy you are turned fool What I secure you I your uncle Why not bid me take a musquet up at once and shoot you  George  There is no musquet in the case A soldier is never shot the first time that he deserts  Thomas  Well then at least he is flogged severely  George  But I need not fear even that for all the Officers of the regiment love me and I am sure I shall get off  Thomas  No no I cannot consent Suppose your father was to know it  George  Can he know it if we keep the secret For deserting as I have told you I shall not be shot though were there any room to fear it I have often risqued my life to benefit my country I can risque it surely then to benefit my father Think too he is your brother and that by this way only we can save him and my mother too from beggary and perhaps from death  Thomas  The devil sure has brought me into this temptation I cannot tell what resolution I should take  George  Remember you have promised me will you break your word In my despair I shall desert and then my father will get nothing by it so that you have no affection for your family if you refuse me  Thomas  No affectionYou hold out a knife before me and are ready as it were to stab me to the heart  George  Well uncle take your choice Time presses  Thomas  But should you deceive me nephew Should your sentence be  George  Of death I have told you there is no fear At worst it will not exceed a whipping I know how to suffer and at every lash I shall bethink me that I have saved my father  Thomas  Well then I consent to do as you direct me but should matters fall out otherwise  George  How can they fall out otherwise Give me your hand and be secret Our people call the Roll as we term it at six o'clock and he that does not answer to his name is marked down as a deserter now you shall conduct me to the guard room tonight and inform them that you apprehended me ten miles out of town as I was deserting from the regiment  Thomas  It is the first deceit that I ever was concerned in  George  Do not reproach yourself with it dear uncle  since it will get us both a blessing Let us embrace once more and now go find my father But take care let me conjure you not to cause suspicion If I am doing wrong God will assuredly forgive me What should not a duteous son do for the preservation of his parents  ACT III  SCENE I  a prison  Drums and other music at a distance  Trunnion    coming in    Oh my poor dear Bob He should have told us his distress about the cursed steward and not thus deserted Who would have imagined it last night to have gone off been apprehended and suffered his punishment all within the compass of a night and a morning But it is over and I am glad of it He has borne it like a hero never uttered a single groan the regiment that loved him so well hitherto will I am sure not love him the worse for it for my part I could have gone through half the punishment for him But here he comes  SCENE II  Trunnion George Serjeant  George    entering lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven    Thank heaven it is over and my father is safe  Serjeant    in surprise    His father is safe what does he mean by that  George  Dear Trunnion  Trunnion    embracing him    O my dearest friend how fares it with you  George  Do not shed tears for my sake comrade I am much happier than you think  Serjeant    aside    What can all this meanShall I go fetch the surgeon  George  No Serjeant I thank you  Serjeant    aside shaking his head    There is something of a mystery in all this I will go and tell my Captain what I think of the affair    goes out    SCENE III  George Trunnion  Trunnion  Well at least then take a drop of something to support you    Giving him a glass of liquor    George    squeezing Trunnion by the hand    Thank you heartily good comrade    He drinks    Trunnion  I am rejoiced that the court in consequence of our request in your behalf remitted so much of your sentence But pray tell me comrade what possessed you to desert thus  George  I am ashamed dear Trunnion to conceal the reason from you so do not ask me it is a secret that I can never mention  SCENE IV  Trunnion George Thomas  Thomas    ntering violently agitated    Well now are you sati  f  dâ–ª  Trunnion  Softly softly You seem agitated Do not disturb your nephew he wants rest A man is not always the same  George    uncle    You are angry uncle Should you speak of the affair between us you will undo me  Thomas  I am undone already  George  Are you serious    to Trunnion    Prithee my good friend leave us a moment to ourselves    Trunnion retires a little    Thomas  Your father is in so great a passion that he will not see me on account of my having informed against you and received the money Besides he will not accept a farthing of it When I offered it to him herejected it with horror God forbid cried he it is the price of my son's blood What then shall I do There is scarce a  boy in the village but will pelt me for my treachery as they call it and all this through you  George  Be pacified dear uncle every thing will yet be well The worst is past and you have only to go back and tell my father that I desire to see him  Thomas  No not Ihe won't permit me to approach him I informed you so before But how is this I see him coming with my sister  SCENE V  George Thomas Moorhouse Grace  Grace  Where is my son Let me see him  Trunnion  This way good mother here he is  Grace    running up to George    What have you been doing son How could you cause us so much sorrow  Moorhouse    in anger    Are you here unhappy wretch You have yourself converted all the joy that you gave me yesterday into distress and sorrow I will never see you more  George  Dear father pray forgive me I have undergone my punishment  Moorhouse  Yes for flying from your colours but you have not yet suffered for disgracing us in our old age Sure sixty years all passed without a blot upon our character entitled us to hope that we should have died without one and yet now you have covered us with infamy But we renounce you  George  Pardon pardon me dear father Heaven is my witness I have not disgraced you and was far from wishing to disgrace you  Thomas    aside    Oh what torture to hear this and yet be forced to stand thus silent  George    following Moorhouse    Do not do not father leave me thus without embracing me Oh stay a moment And you mother can you shew yourself as cruel  Grace  What can I do son  Moorhouse  Never call him son He has forfeited that name  Grace  Forgive him good man He is still our child  Thomas  Yes brother let your heart be moved to pity his affliction  Moorhouse  Hold your tongue You are full as bad as he is you that sell your nephew for the sake of money I will no more be your brother than his father  Grace    a little while with George    Hear me husband He makes solemn promises Do not make us both wretched After all he is our child the only one that we have and can we then not love him  Moorhouse  Don't speak one word more woman but follow me    He is going out but Trunnion holds him    Trunnion  Come master Moorhouse enough You have vented your passion let all be forgotten The king accepts him again why should not you Give him give him your hand Do you think that I should continue to have a regard for him if he did not deserve it  Grace  Hear that my love Do not be more hardhearted toward him than strangers are Besides consider what his captain said yesterday in his behalf  Moorhouse  I see him coming so I will speak to him before I answer  SCENE VI  George Thomas Moorhouse Grace Captain Serjeant Trunnion  Moorhouse  Ah sir does it not afflict you when you recollect that yesterday you said so much in praise of my unworthy son  The Captain  He had deserved it though indeed I could not have supposed my commendation would have had such bad effects But    to George    tell me what could possibly induce you to desert You must have had some very ungent motive Let me know the secrets of your heart whatever be the consequence You have been punished and have therefore nothing now to fear  George  My worthy captain do not I beseech you take away your favour from me I will endeavour to deserve it  The Captain    If you tell the truth I will not For to fancy that you deserted for a quarrel which I understand you had with a Steward is absurd  George  And yet your honour may be certain there is no other reason It is well known I never was remarkable for quarrelling with any one The least offence appears enormous when one has not been accustomed to it I was so disturbed at the affair that it took away my reason and besides the unhappy situation of my father aided to distract me  The Captain  What then signified these words that you said on entering the prison with the Serjeant  Thank Heaven it is over and my father is safe  Moorhouse    astonished    Were those his words sir God forgive me but the devil surely must have turned his brain  George    sighing    I do not remember to have said those words  Serjeant  I remember to have heard you say them when you first entered this room  Trunnion  Yes yes comrade that you did I myself heard you also now I recollect  George  They must then have certainly escaped me in my pain  The Captain  They might so yet they are not without a meaning  George    in great embarrassment    I do not know what answer to make you  The Captain    taking him by the hand    Do not my honest fellow study to deceive us This desertion has some other reason than your quarrel Your dissimulation very much displeases me and you are likely to lose all my friendship Was it not on account of your father  George    eagerly    How say you sir Do not believe  The Captain  I see you are not worth the trouble that I am taking for you and no longer wish to be informed of any thing about you You are more indifferent to me than the worst of men You do not know perhaps how much you have lost by this prevarication  Thomas  I must tell it then at last  George    interrupting him    Dear uncle would you wish to make us more unhappy than we are  Thomas    to the Captain    I can explain the whole affair sir but have reason to fear lest the mischief should become still greater  The Captain  No you have nothing to fear I give you my promise  Thomas  Well then good sir it was to save his parents that he deserted He found means to make me turn infermer and get forty shillings that his father might have wherewithal to pay his debts but now his father will not hear a word about the money or his son Let me beseech you therefore sir to rid me of this money which I cannot keep and interpose at least with your authority and kindness that my brother may be profited by what his son has so affectionately done to benefit him for the affair is exactly as I relate it to you    Every one appears astonished    The Captain  George what do you say to this  George    bursting into tears    You have heard the truth However I beseech your honour to believe that nothing but my father's safety could induce me to desert my colours I despised the danger hoping to save him but since every thing is discovered and my hopes all lost I must suffer more severely  Moorhouse    embracing George    What dear George and was it for my sake you did all this  Grace    embracing him also    Yes now indeed we may embrace him though indeed my heart informed me all along that he could not be so guilty  The Captain    taking George by the hand    Oh my generous youth what affection and what courage Yet to say the truth your filial piety has carried you too far for to desert is always blameable  Moorhouse  Most certainly Heaven keep me from becoming richer by a penny of this money  George  There now uncle see what comes of your revealing the affair I have made myself a double criminal to get my father money which you find he will not accept  Thomas  Yes yes you have this to lay to my charge I must acknowledge but his honour made me a promise first of all  The Cattain    to Thomas    Let your brother have the money Take it    to Moorhouse    my good friend for George has deserved it richly  Moorhouse  I can never bring myself to take such illgot money  The Captain  I  will  have you take it and what is more I will go and tell the matter to our colonel    To George    You have not done your duty as a soldier I acknowledge but have shown yourself a son in such a manner that he cannot but be moved when made acquainted with it Wait me I will return immediately    The Captain and Serjeant go out    SCENE VII  George Thomas Moorhouse Grace Trunnion  George  My consolation is that I can now with greater confidence entreat you to forgive me as I have finished your misfortunes and the steward will not have it in his power to hurt you  Trunnion  Yes my good old man forgive your son He will be cured the sooner if he has your blessing and besides you ought to consider that he is to possess your cottage after you  Moorhouse  He is and therefore I will preserve it for him Come my son forgive your father who has used you thus unkindly Heaven can tell how much I suffered from the thought that you had left your colours and it seems you were discharging even then your duty towards me How shall I repay you for so much affection in the little time that I have to live  George  By loving me as you have always done  Grace  Oh yes and ten times more for every bit of bread that we eat we will say to one another it is our dear son's gift  George  I am satisfied And I thank you uncle for the service that you have done me  Thomas  You thank me do you I am glad that matters have turned out as well as they have But never make such a ticklish experiment again And now brother have you still a grudge against me If it had not been from my wish to serve you I would never have been concerned in my nephew's scheme no more than he would and since you pardon him you may extend your liberality to me  Moorhouse  What can excuse your conduct brother I may throw myself into the flames but he that lights them  for me ought to be considered cruel Yes indeed However I will not hate you there is my hand  Trunnion  Comrade hitherto I have loved but now respect you Let us embrace then and be always friends  SCENE VIII  George Thomas Moorhouse Grace Trunnion the Captain  The Captain  Good luck good luck You are a serjeant on the spot The colonel when I told him the affair between your father and yourself was happy to promote you Take this also    giving him a purse of money    from him as a witness how much he applauds your filial piety  Moorhouse and Grace  O sir may heaven reward you  The Captain  Nothing in all this is due to me the colonel has done every thing    George embraces his parents one after the other and then turning to the captain says    I beg your honour's pardon  The Captain  You deserve the pleasure of embracing those that gave you birth to whom you have so well discharged your duty  Thomas  Well could any one have thought that old Thomas simple as he is would come to make a serjeant as it is plain I have  Trunnion  Yes yes and therefore Mr Serjeant  George    embracing him    Call me nothing but comrade and friend as we have always been  Trunnion  Well then comrade let us break off a little for the present and as nothing like good liquor suits a joyous time let us as soon as we are able make up for the sorrows of last night and thus morning His honour and the colonel shall be toasted first  THE BED OF DEATH  DUNCAN a bricklayer's labourer living in a distant country town had lost his wife about a quarter of a year before the event we are to write of The e  pences of a tedious illness and the interruption of  his labour by a very rainy season had reduced him to the last distress His children were half naked and had really no bread to eat This circumstance was of itself sufficiently tormenting but to aggravate the scene Susanna his poor mother laid upon a little straw in the corner of the cottage was almost in the agonies of death  Duncan at such a prospect round about him overwhelmed with sorrow took a broken matted chair and at a little distance from Susanna's bed sat down upon it having both his hands held up that he might hide his tears  His mother turning towards him with a feeble voice enquired if there was no where in the house a rag to put upon her I cannot make myself warm said she do what I will  Duncan  Stay mother I will pull off my coat and lay it on you  Susanna  No no I will not have it my dear son A little straw if you have nothing else will do as well But have you not a single bit of wood still left to make a sire for these poor children You will tell me you cannot go into the fields because of the attention that I require My life is very long since I am grown burthensome to you  Duncan  Pray do not say so dear mother Would to God I could procure you what you want at the expence of my own life I would freely give it up but this is my grief that you suffer cold and hunger while I am utterly unable to relieve you  Susanna  Do not let that however afflict you much my poor son Thank God my agonies are not so great as your affection fears they may be they will very quickly finish and my blessing will be the recompence of what you are doing now and have been always doing for me  Duncan  O my poor dear mother In my infancy you put yourself to many difficulties for my maintenance and I in your old age must thus sit by and see you want for common necessaries That dear mother rends my heart  Susanna  I know it is not through any fault of yours and then Duncan upon a deathbed one has fewbelieve me when I tell you sofew earthly wants Our heavenly father has us then particularly in his care I  thank you heartily my dear Your love consoles me in this hour of my departure  Duncan  What dear mother have you then no hopes of recovering  Susanna  No I feel within me that I must die of this complaint  Duncan  You do not say so  Susanna  Do not afflict yourself I shall soon be in a better world  Duncan    with sighs    Oh heaven oh heaven  Susanna  I say my son this need not grieve you You were all my happiness when I was young and now you prove the joy of my last moments Soon yes very soon thank heaven you will have nothing left you but to close my eyelids I shall then ascend to my creator tell what you have done for me and earnestly beseech him to reward you for it everlastingly Think frequently of me and I will think of you above  Duncan  Yes always always  Susanna  There is only one thing in the world that gives me pain when I think of it  Duncan  And what is that mother  Susanna  I am mustering up my strength to tell you And believe me I  must  tell you for it is like a stone oppressing me at heart  Duncan  Comfort yourself dear mother then and speak  Susanna  I saw your little Arthur come yesterday here close behind my bed and pull out several apples which he ate Duncan these apples were not ours for then he would have thrown them on the table and asked me to take some I remember still how lovingly he used to come and fling himself into my arms when he had any thing to give me saying with so much goodnature Eat some do my dear grandmother O my dear dear son if he should be a thief hereafter The thought has afflicted me ever since yesterday Where is he Pray go fetch him I would talk a little to him  Duncan  Wretch that I am    He runs and fetches Arthur and puts him by Susanna she raises herself with difficulty turns about takes both his hands in hers and leans her head upon his shoulder    Arthur  Grandmother do you want me You don't call me here I hope to see you die  Susanna  No no fear nothing my poor Arthur I do not desire to frighten you and yet my dearest I shall die and very soon too  Arthur  But not yet Do not die till I am bigger    Susanna falls backward in her bed The child and father look at one another weeping and each takes her by the hand    Susanna    coming somewhat to herself    I am much better now that I have changed my posture  Arthur  So then you won't die  Susanna  Be comforted my little fellow Dying is not painful to me as I am going to a tender father who at present waits in heaven to see me When I am once with him I shall be better off than here Soon soon my little fellow I shall see him  Arthur  Well then take me with you I will go too  Susanna  No my dear you shall not go with me but if it pleases God remain a good while here behind me You shall live to be a virtuous and good man and when your father is as ill as I am you shall be his consolation and afford him the assistance that he needs Won't you Arthur Won't you obey him constantly and do whatever you think will give him pleasure See he does whatever he is able for my sake And won't you promise me that you will do so too  Arthur  Yes certainly I will grandmother  Susanna  Take care then how you perform your promise God who made both earth and heaven cannot but see every thing that you do I suppose you believe this  Arthur  Yes I do believe it you have taught me so yourself  Susanna  How then my dearest Arthur could you suppose that he would not see you come here yesterday behind my bed and eat the apples that you had stolen  Arthur  I will do so no moreno never grandmother believe me while I live Forgive me what I have done and pray that God Almighty would forgive me too  Susanna  It is true then is it that you stole those apples  Arthur    sobbing    Yeees  Susanna  And pray of whom  Arthur  Of neeeighbour Leeconard  Susanna  You must go to neighbour Leonard then and ask his pardon  Arthur  Oh do not send me there pray grandmother I dare not go  Susanna  You  must  my little friend that you may never do the like again For heaven's sake my dear child in future never take what does not belong to you not even a bit of bread though you were starving God will never let you want since it was he who created you Trust then to his assistance tell him when you suffer and be sure that he will console you  Arthur  Certainly grandmother certainly I will never steal again I promise you I will not and for the future I would much rather die of hunger than steal any thing  Susanna  God hear and bless your resolution from his holy habitation I have hopes that of his goodness he will keep you from so great a sin    She clasps him to her heart and weeps    You must my little boy this instant go to neighbour Leonard and desire him to forgive you Tell him that I too beg him to forgive you Go my good Duncan with Arthur inform him how it grieves me that I am not able to make him restitution for the theft but that I will pray to God for his prosperity and beg a blessing on his family Alas he is no less poor than we and were it not that his good woman works so hard he could never bring up such a family of children as he has My dear good son for my sake when I am dead and buried give him a day's work to make him up his loss it matters not how little he has suffered We should think it criminal to take away a pin You will remember this Duncan  Duncan  Yes mother so do not let the matter make you any more uneasy  He had hardly said these words when as it chanced 'Squire Wearthy's steward tapped without against the window  Poor Susanna knew him by his usual way of tapping and the cough he  antly had on him Bless me it is the steward said she Surely some great mischief threatens us He is like a raven croaking at the window some bad tidings  Duncan  Do not be frightened thus my good mother I am not a single farthing in his debt and for the rent that we owe the 'squire at Midsummer I will give him all the labour that he requires in harvest  Susanna  Yes provided he will but wait so long  Duncan went out to know the steward's business After he was gone Susanna fetched a grievous sigh and said discoursing with herself Since he was so hardhearted as to seize upon our goods for rent I cannot see or hear him but my heart revolts at the idea and at present in my dying moments he must come and cough at our window But perhaps the hand of God brings him hither as an admonition for me to discharge my heart of every thing that looks like malice or illwill against him and even pray for mercy on his soul Well then my God I am content to do so I no longer wish him any harm Forgive his sin as I forgive it    She hears the steward speaking rather loud    But I hear his voice he is in a passionHeaven take pity on usO my poor Duncan it is out of love for me that you have fallen again into his hands    She faints on which the little boy jumps off the bed and runs to fetch his father    Arthur  O father father Quick come here My grandmother is dying  Duncan  O my GodPermit me Mr Steward I  must  go to her assistance  The Steward    going out    Yes indeed that is very necessary The old Jezebel may die elseI should think it a good riddance of bad rubbish  Luckily Duncan was got too far to hear these cruel words He was already by Susanna's bed who speedily recovered from her swoon and thus addressed her son  The steward came to scold you I could hear him Doubtless he will not grant you time when once the quarter is turned  Duncan  No mother he did not come about that he brought me on the contrary good news  Susanna    pausing a moment and appearing to collect her spirits    But is this true my son or do you only wish to comfort me a little What good news can  he  have for us  Duncan  It is the 'square's design he says to pull down and rebuild his house at least the front and stables and to employ me at it with my neighbours I shall have at least he says ten shillings every week  Susanna    with a countenance of joy    You don't say so  Duncan  Yes certainly and there will be a matter of two years continual work Next Monday I begin  Susanna  God's providence be praised for all things I shall now die happy seeing you enabled to get bread to feed your little ones Death now has nothing painful in it Heaven is merciful may you Duncan at all times find it so but tell me are you not by this convinced of what I have so often told you that the more misfortunes on one side attack us so much more God's grace awaits us on the other  Duncan  Yes I am and shall be always But methinks you seem much better Let me quit you for about a minute I will go fetch a little straw to cover you  Susanna  No no I feel myself much warmer Rather go with Arthur to neighbour Leonard's That is what disturbs me most of all Go my son I ask it as a favour  Hearing this he did not stay a moment in the room but took his son and going out gave Margaret a sign to come and let him speak with her  Take care of your poor grandmother said he and if a fainting fit should seize her come and fetch me from the carpenter's I shall be there  Leonard was at work and Gertrude his wife was left all alone at home She saw at once that the father and the child had both been crying  What is the matter with you my good friend said Gertrude that you have been crying What is the matter with you my poor Arthur  Duncan  Ah neighbour Gertrude I am quite unhappy This poor child of mine who wanted victuals yesterday came here and took some apples that were yours he has confessed it My poor mother saw him eat themGertrude she is on her death bed and desires you to forgive him I cannot pay you now the worth of what he took away but when I go to work which will be very shortly I will be sure to satisfy you  Gertrude  O don't speak about it neighbour it is a trifle not worth mentioning And you my little fellow promise that you will never for the future take what is not your own    She kisses him    You are born of such good people  Arthur  Oh I promise you I will not forgive me Gertrude I will never steal again  Gertrude  No never for the future my good child You do not know yet how great a sin it is When you are hungry come to me and if I have a bit of bread myself I will share it with you  Duncan  Thank ye neighbour but I hope he will never want bread again I have got a deal of work to do at 'Squire Wealthy's  Gertrude  Yes I heard so of the servants and was very glad  Duncan  I was not near so happy when I got it on my own account as for my mother's sake She has at least this comfort on her deathbed Tell my good friend Leonard that I shall work with all my heart to make him compensation for his loss  Gertrude  Do not speak about it I request you once again My husband I am certain will not think of any compensation He was out of work himself and is to have the wood work of the job for which you are engaged But as poor Susanna is so ill I will go and give her my assistance  Gertrude got on her cloak and then put up some pears and apples in a bag and filled the little fellow's pockets likewise took him by the hand and bidding poor Duncan go first came after  They had quickly reached Susanna's chamber Gertrude held out her hand but turned away her face that she might hide her tears Susanna notwithstanding saw her and began as follows  You are crying then my dear friend Gertrude  Gertrude  Indeed I cry to see you suffer thus  Susanna  It is or ought to be alas  our  part to cry Forgive us I beseech you It is the first time that such a circumstance has happened in our house  Gertrude  Why what a serious business you are making of a trifle It was excusable in such a child  Susanna  But if when older he should take to be a thief  Gertrude  No no I will answer for him he will be good My dear Susanna you deserve this recompense of heaven for your own honesty and all the care that you have taken to bring up your family in virtue Do you want for any thing Do not fear to tell me if you do for every thing that we have is at your service  Arthur  Yes indeed for only see what Gertrude has given me  dear grandmother do eat some  Susanna  No my child I cannot I shall never eat again I feel my strength go from me and I have almost lost my sight My son draw near me now is come the moment to take leave and give you my farewell  Duncan no sooner heard these words than he was seized all over with a sudden trembling he took off his hat fell down upon his knees beside Susanna's bed laid hold with ardour of her hand then lifted up his eyes to heaven and would fain have spoke but could not tears and sighs prevented him  Take comfort said Susanna I am going to a happier life than this and there will wait your coming When we once meet there we shall not part again  Duncan in some degree recovering bowed his head and craved his mother's blessing Bless me said he my dear mother I desire to follow you when once my children have no further need of my assistance  Susanna opened once again her dying eyes and with uncommon fervour looking up pronounced these words  Hear me O heavenly father and vouchsafe the blessings of thy grace and favour to my son the only one that I ever had and whose affection was the comfort of my life Duncan may God be always with you and confirm in heaven this blessing which I pronounce on you for having fulfilled your duty so much like a son  Hear me now my dear Duncan and carefully observe what I shall tell you Bring your children up in virtue and accustom them betimes to a laborious life that if they should be poor they may not when grown up lose courage and be tempted to do wrong Instruct them to place all their trust in God and to live good friends with one another so that they may find sure consolation in the  evils of this life Forgive the steward his injustice When I am buried pray inform him that I departed without any malice or illwill against him and besought of God that he would grant him of his grace to see the sin that he had committed and repent before he came upon a deathbed    She stops a little to take breath and then goes on    Reach me my good friend    to Gertrude    that book behind you and my dear Duncan there is a little leather bag in our great chest I wish to have it Good    she takes and clasps them to her heart    These are the only treasures that I have left on earth And now I should be glad to see your children  They were weeping at a table whence their father brought them to Susanna putting them upon their knees beside her while she raised herself a little so that she might see them and began  My dearest children I am very sorry that I must leave you motherless and poor Think often of me my sweet babes I have nothing that I can give you but this book it has been frequently my consolation and as often will be yours When you have learned sufficiently read in it every evening to your father It will teach you to be good and if you are but good you cannot fail of being happy  This Duncan    taking out a piece of paper from the leather bag    is a certificate which I brought your father of my good behaviour at our marriage Let it pass by turns to each of your three daughters till they marry It is my last request And as for you my son I have nothing in the world to give you in remembrance of me but the comfort is you want none You will not forget me I am certain  Gertrude shall I request one other favour of you after having pardoned Arthur When I am dead see now and then to these poor childrenThey have no one friend I recommend you in particular my poor dear LucyShe is the youngest of the threeWhere is sheI can hardly see    She stretches out her arm with difficulty    Conduct my hand and let me touch herO my children    she dies    After a moment's silence Duncan supposing her to be fallen asleep said softly to his children Rise and do not disturb her slumber Might she but recover after having  had this unexpected rest But Gertrude saw plainly that she was dead and gave Duncan to understand as much What was his distraction then and that of his helpless family How they wept and wrung their hands How they beat upon their breasts and tore their hair up by the roots for anguish  Gertrude as well as she was able comforted their sorrow and repeated to Duncan Susanna's parting words which in his grief he had not heard distinctly  She began that very day to shew how much she valued the deceased by complying with her last wish The little orphans being brought up with her own dear children had the same instruction and improving by it grew in time to be a pattern for the village and particularly Arthur continually having in remembrance his first fault became remarkable in time for his fidelity and honest dealing  PASCAL  MR Dawkins was accustomed every Saturday to pay his only son a little boy whose name was Pascal an allowance such as was sufficient to procure him the week through those little pleasures and enjoyments which children of his age so naturally pursue No less confident than generous he never looked for an account from Pascal of the way in which he laid out what he gave him He supposed his principles to be such that he would not abuse his bounty but remember the instruction which he had so frequently given him upon the subject But what lamentable consequences did this too blind credulity produce  For hardly ever had he touched his weekly payment but he ran that moment to a shop hard by and stuffed himself with pastry and nice things His purse in this first onset underwent so great a diminution that a very little the next day was sufficient to exhaust it totally and during the last part of every week he never had a farthing to regale himself withal yet he did not upon that account the less hanker after the same delicacies Wherefore  being resolved to gratify his palate he prevailed upon the pastrycook at first to give him credit but when afterwards he found that the boy's allowance was never applied to pay off these arrears while on the other hand the debt increased he saw that it was prudent to give in his bill to Mr Dawkins Mr Dawkins was extremely angry with the tradesman reprimanded his improper conduct and forbade not only  him  but every tradesman round about to let his son have any thing for which he could not pay on the spot This might have been supposed a good precaution and accordingly he thought it could not but become a check on Pascal's gluttony whereas it only irritated matters and the boy as we shall see at any risque resolved to gratify his palate  Pascal's chamber was contiguous to his father's After having noticed when his father generally slept the soundest he once got up softly came into his room and feeling for his breeches took out half a crown Emboldened by this fatal success he frequently repeated his offence and for a time without detection but there cannot be a crime however secretly committed which does not come to light at last  It chanced that Mr Dawkins some time after Pascal's first offence in this way had a lawsuit on the following day to be decided Having thought upon it waking it is not to be wondered at that it should take up his attention after he was gone to rest In fact he lay quite silent ruminating on the affair when Pascal thinking him asleep got up as he was wont to do Unhappily for him the moon threw light enough into the chamber that a person coming in might easily be seen Accordingly let any one imagine if he can what Mr Dawkins must have felt beholding his own son thus come and rob him He for that time stifled his resentment but before the thief could quit his chamber in the morning he got up went to him and found means to turn the conversation into such a channel as to ask him how much he intended to lay out that day of his allowance Nothing answered Pascal I have given all my last week's money to a poor man in the neighbourhood and must deny myself a little till next Saturday  His father could not possibly restrain his indignation any longer hearing so detestable a lie come from him  He sprung forward seized him by the collar for by this time he was dressed and found five shillings in his pocket which was what he had stolen from his father In proportion as he had till now been tender and indulgent to his son so much the greater was his severity and rigour on this occasion for his reprimands were only the preamble to a harsher treatment and the wretched Pascal was obliged to keep his bed for many days in consequence of the correction that he received  How difficult it is to extirpate a vice which has once taken root within us Pascal was not cured by this correction Mr Dawkins left the key of his bureau one evening in the lock and Pascal took a model of the wards and got another made at the smith's This gave him a convenient opportunity to rob his father whenever he pleased who as he usually kept a great deal of cash by him and as Pascal was more cunning than to take too much at once suspected nothing of the affair He was now fifteen years of age and could dissemble so well that his parents thought him quite reformed till his hypocrisy was accidentally discovered  His father had received a piece of foreign coin among other monies which he soon remarked and put it up in the bureau This piece fell into Pascal's hands that very night and Mr Dawkins missing it the next morning could not but bethink himself of Pascal's former inclinations and suspect him He resolved to satisfy himself that moment and examining his pockets found the piece of money that he had lost together with the key by means of which he had obtained it  But Pascal by this time was too big for such correction as he had received before and therefore Mr Dawkins contented himself with severely upbraiding him for the present and threatening to withdraw the benefits of his affection from him He consulted a few faithful friends that he had upon the treatment proper to be shewn him their opinion was in general that the harshest method of proceeding would most tend to his amendment and advised his being sent to school in Yorkshire where for years he might not see his family but be subjected to the rigorous discipline and homely fare peculiar to such institutions and of course have leisure to repent of his enormity and be accustomed to a frugal way of life This was  their counsel but the combats of paternal love in Mr Dawkins's bosom which was very far as yet from being quite extinct would not permit him to pursue their salutary admonition he inclined to something of a gentler nature and in grief of heart and as the only moderate method which he could devise to preserve him from destruction sent that very day to Bristol for a friend of his who kept a boarding school to whose attention he consigned upon the day of his arrival this unworthy son with directions to let him have no other money than was absolutely necessary for his wants His friend set off on his return immediately and Pascal with him  This was a precaution but it came alas too late the youth's principles were utterly corrupted His tutor's table was plain though very plentiful for which reason Pascal would go out and at a tavern gratify his palate with the choicest wines and viands for which he easily got credit as his host took care to make enquiry first of all into his father's circumstances who he found was very rich nor did he stop at this for to supply that want of money which his tutor would not he began to play and practised every species of deception at a gaminghouse hard by  God's providence as if it interfered particularly to reform him punished all his vices on the spot Three gamblers his companions who detected him endeavouring to deceive them with a pack of cards that he had beforehand sorted for the purpose fell upon him unawares and so rough were the effects of their vengeance that Pascal was almost drubbed to death upon the spot  He was carried home with scarce the least remains of life and put to bed His tutor ran to see him and afforded all the succour and assistance in his power He waited till he saw him almost reestablished to impart such counsel as might possibly affect him which he did with all the softness possible and pointed out the horrors into which he was plunging himself Miserable youth said the tutor what can have induced you to excesses so disgraceful You dishonour by your crimes a name which the probity of those before you had exalted and made really respectable You rob your tender parents of those hopes which they indulged when first they laid the groundwork of your education When the youth of your acquaintance  who now consecrate that time to study which you consume in scandalous excesses shall be sought out by their country and employed in elevated stations you will be considered as an abject dangerous character You will be banished from all company that have the least regard or value for their honour and the meanest class of men will scorn you  Pascal was at first affected with this lesson He broke off all commerce with his partners he was satisfied with his preceptor's tablefare and seemed as if beginning to imagine that study had some charms to please him But this disposition was soon done away and by degrees he relapsed into his former way of life He sold his books his watch and clothes went afterwards and he contrived to strip himself of his apparel so completely that he could not stir abroad  On which his creditors came all at once upon him and receiving a refusal from the tutor to discharge the young man's debts and satiate their avidity they wrote letters to the father threatening to arrest him if they were not paid Let Pascal's situation now be imagined Overwhelmed with the repreaches of his creditors the indignation of his tutor the contempt of those who waited on him and his own remorse he had moreover to dread the malediction of his parents He was sensible that he had so much neglected to improve his understanding that he could not find the least resources against want in any calling or profession He began to think his situation desperate A whole day he passed in his apartment violently agitated every now and then he wrung his hands tore his hair and cursed his vices but at night still borne away by his depravity he went from home to spend the little money that he had left in a tavern  Accident that evening threw two men into his company who were employed to raise recruits for India They remarked upon his countenance the embarrassment with which his soul was agitated winked to one another and began to talk of India They described the beauty of the country and what pay was given to the soldiery They spoke of the advantages that a youth of family might meet with there and what a probability there was that such a one might make his fortune nay they went so far as to assert that many to their knowledge had from  private soldiers been made officers and married wealthy widows  Pascal heard this conversation with avidity joined in the discourse and enquired if it was difficult to be enlisted with these soldiers If you wish to enlist said they we can oblige you though we have more recruits by many than we want but you by your appearance seem to claim the preference and thereupon they offered him five guineas if he would enter  After some slight struggles Pascal took the guineas and enlisted The remainder of the night he spent in drinking and when morning came was sent to learn his exercise He found himself surrounded by a set of aukward rustics runaway apprentices notorious beggars and convicted thieves who had enlisted to escape the gallows He was under the tuition of a surly corporal who loaded him from time to time with curses and severely caned him when he could not comprehend his meaning  Pascal's misery went on from day to day encreasing All the money that he had lately touched at parting with his freedom was already gone in riot He had nothing to subsist on but the coarse provision granted by the company to keep their new recruits together Lubberkin who had been a swineherd and was then his comrade was much better off He had been always used to  ive on o  ten bread and therefore thought himself a prince when he could get a bit of halfbaked meat But what were Pascal's feelings when partaking of such coarse provisions he reflected on the delicacies of his former repasts  Some days after came an order for the soldiers to embark Pascal heard this news with much more satisfaction than the people round about him thought he would have testified If once you get to India said he to himself as you are young and of a likely figure you will make your fortune as a multitude of Englishmen have done before you  In the midst of all these brilliant prospects Pascal went on board the vessel destined to transport him and his comrades He drank down a glass or two of brandy at the moment of embarking and the  served to warm hi  head and to make him utterly forget his parents He went off with mad huzzas But then the joy with which he uttered these huzzas continued hardly longer than the  drunkenness that caused them Those on board who were now for the first time in their life at sea began to feel a deathlike sickness Pascal whose intemperance had hurt his inside much endured a great deal more than any other He was several days insensible and nothing staid upon his stomach Even the sight of food disgusted him and when at last he grew a little better and was hungry mouldy pease salt beef and biscuits full of maggots were the only victuals that he could procure When he first set sail the soldiers had a pint of beer each allowed them but by degrees they were deprived of this indulgence and compelled to put up with a bare sufficiency of water and even this they were obliged to strain before they could drink it  After six long months incessant suffering during all which time they were in fear of continual shipwreck they arrived in India wearied out with watchings for the most part and a dreadful scurvy Pascal was marched up the country with his comrades to the army but his heart embittered by the horror of his situation was insensible of any thing like goodness His abandoned course of life the crimes that he was incessantly committing and his numberless desertions frequently subjected him to punishment He was determined if he could to quit these regions watched his opportunity and stealing on board a vessel bound to England hid himself below till it had sailed nor did he quit his hiding place till the ship was a great way out to sea he then came sorth and being brought before the captain promised to work his passage to England which the captain in the end accepted as the vessel was in want of men  What in the interim was become of his unhappy parents They alas still lived if people may be said to live whose sad days are spent in anguish and despair The crimes which their son had committed and with which the neighbourhood all around them rung had forced them to renounce their place of habitation and go down and live in Sussex in a solitary quarter near the sea  A short time after they were settled here the ship in which Pascal was arrived on that very part of the coast where they had fixed their retirement For while they were a little way out to sea Pascal a thorough graduate in vice had conspired with ten or twelve desperate fellows  of the crew to murder every one on board who would not join in their conspiracy and so obtain possession of the ship They executed their infernal purpose and soon after running the vessel ashore they hoisted out their boat at night that they might come on shore and pillage the inhabitants  That very night the unhappy Mr Dawkins in his house was up and watching by his wife's sick bed Her grief for Pascal's wretched fortune had long preyed upon her constitution and by this time after having suffered grievously she felt the agonies of death upon her In the intervals of her delirium she called out for Pascal Where where are you said the dying mother Come that I may press you to my heart and pardon you before I die At this the door is suddenly burst open and ten villains rush into the dwelling Pascal with a hatchet in his hand was first and led them on The father comes to meet them with a candle but before his son could recollect himThe remainder is too horrid to relate suffice it that Pascal and his gang were apprehended on the spot and suffered at the gallows  Children if when you have read this story you dare think of giving way to any vice whatsoever tremble at the possibility of your becoming criminal by degrees and ending like Pascal with the crime of parricide  THE CONJURING BIRD  A DRAMA in ONE ACT  CHARACTERS  THE COUNTESS OF GLENALVON  AUGUSTUS  her Children  JULIA  her Children  THE HON MR ODDLY  a Nobleman's younger Son  ELIZA  his Sister  GABRIEL  Friends of Julia and Augustus  LUCIUS  Friends of Julia and Augustus  SOPHIA  Friends of Julia and Augustus  JENNY  Servants to the Countess  RICHARD  Servants to the Countess  The  SCENE  is in the country at the Countess's and in two rooms which open to the garden  SCENE I  Jenny reckening up the counters on a table  IT is all lost labour to stand counting thus I cannot make more than ninetyfour and yet there should be an hundred Well I think there never was a house like ours for harebrained children for wherever they once put their foot one may be sure they will jumble every thing together if they do not lose something or another I must look about for them in every corner of the chamber  SCENE II  The Countess Jenny  The Countess  You seem uneasy Jenny What are you seeking  Jenny  Your ladyship's best counters  The Countess  Do not you see them on the table  Jenny  Yes my lady but the number is not complete  The Countess  That should not be  Jenny  That should not be indeed and yet there are no less than half a dozen wanting Were there not an hundred  The Countess  Yes you know it as well as I  Jenny  Well then there are but ninetyfour  The Countess    after having counted them    There are indeed no more and yet last night the number was complete I put them up myself when we had finished playing But what caused you to come now and count them up  Jenny  Because as I passed by the door I saw that the children had been playing with them  The Countess  Yet I absolutely ordered that they should not be touched They have ivory ones to play with who could give them these  Jenny  Themselves  The Countess  Themselves Where are they  Jenny  In the garden madam with their little company  The Countess  Fetch Julia hereBut stay have none been here but Julia and Augustus  Jenny  Yes their friends and who can tell  The Countess  What Jenny can you possibly suspect  Jenny  I will answer for your children please your ladyship and likewise the three young Davenports as if they were myself  The Countess  And not the others  Jenny  I do not know them well enough  The Countess  What Jenny two such children as the Hon Mr Oddly and his sister  Jenny  If your ladyship thinks sit I'll call Miss Julia in but here she comes  SCENE III  The Countess Jenny Julia  The Countess    to Julia coming in    Who told you miss to use my silver counters Did not I forbid you to meddle with them  Julia  It was not my fault mama  The Countess  And whose then pray  Julia  The Hon Mr Oddly's and his sister's I had got the ivory counters when they asked me if I meant to  play with them as they never had such at home and must have better upon which they opened all the drawers and closets till they met with these  The Countess  Why did not you mention that I would never let  you  use them  Julia  Good as if they would hear me I believe they would have beat us had we not surrendered them  Jenny  Upon my word These children as it seems are charmingly brought up  The Countess  You should at least have counted them when you left off playing  Julia  That was what I wished to do But after I had got to twentyfour or thereabouts Mr Oddly snatched them from me put them up pellmell and dragged us out into the garden with him  The Countess  Do you know that six are missing  Julia  Sure mama  The Countess  How sure when I have told you See now whether one can trust you in the least You know it was your duty to take care of them  Julia  I was confounded dear mama these children are so mischievous I was obliged to have my eye continually on them as I thought they would have broke your china I was obliged frequently to follow them about the room they may have flung the counters then into some corner or another  The Countess  Well but I must have them found  Jenny  I know but one way madam Were I you I would turn the little master's pockets inside out before they left the house  The Countess  Fie Jenny would you have me affront their parents  Julia  Oh I am sure mama not one among them can have stolen the counters  The Countess  So I think but children of their age may be a little giddyheaded So go to them Julia and politely ask if any one among them may not by mistake have put them up into his pocket Your commission is a nice one and requires a little management Take care not to offend them by insinuating that you think any one of the company capable of taking them purposely  Julia  I shall take care mama  The Countess  Accuse yourself of negligence and tell them that I shall blame you if they are not soon found  Julia  I understand you  The Countess  And bid Robert as you pass come here  Julia  I will mama  SCENE IV  The Countess Jenny  Jenny    who has been employed in looking round the room    I will answer for it they are not here there is not a corner but I have searched  The Countess  This should not have happened in my house I dread yet long to know by what means they are vanished  SCENE V  The Countess Jenny Robert  Robert  Here I am my lady what is your pleasure  The Countess  To inform you Robert that I have lost since yesterday six counters  Robert  Does your ladyship suspect me of taking them  The Countess  God forbid I am too well acquainted with your honesty for that But I suppose if you had crossed the room you might have seen them on some chair or elsewhere  Robert  Counters on a chair  The Countess  I know that is not a proper place for counters but the children have been playing where they were and might have inconsiderately left them in some corner and you seen them  Robert  No my lady I have not  The Countess  I am sorry for it and do not know what method to pursue They must have certainly been lost since morning as I counted them myself last nightBut look about  Jenny  Your ladyship has seen how I have been searching for them Servants are but badly off when any thing is lost about a house However honest they may be they are constantly suspected  The Countess  Very likely but the honest servant will on this occasion pardon me if I include her in my search of the dishonest  Robert  You may first of all examine me my lady Rogues are constantly the first to be displeased when they are suspected  Jenny  God be thanked I have no fear of that sort But it cannot be a matter of indifference to the honest servant when a thief is in the house  The Countess  But put yourself into my place what would you do Think Robert  Robert  Do my ladyA thought this moment strikes me and provided I have leave to put it into execution I will engage to find the counters  The Countess  But you must not think of giving any one occasion to suppose himself suspectedWhat is your design  Robert  I cannot at present tell your ladyship A single syllable might spoil the business Do but bring together all the children in the adjoining room I promise you the thief if there is any thief among them shall betray himself  The Countess  I cannot tell whether I should let  Robert  You can trust me madam Be assured that no one but the guilty person shall have reason to complain and him I d  re believe you would not wish to spare  The Countess  Well Robert as I know your prudence I rely upon it  Robert  Good my lady Therefore I will go and begin conjuring Do not be afraid it is quite simple  SCENE VI  The Countess Jenny  Jenny  My ladydid not he say something about conjuring But that I know myself innocent I should be frightened out of my wits  The Countess  Peace simpleton  SCENE VII  The Countess Jenny Augustus  The Countess  What now Augustus You seem big with something or another Have you brought the counters with you  Augustus  No mama I have only learned that six are lost My sister told us so just this moment  The Countess  And how was the intelligence received  Augustus  We were exceedingly surprized The two Davenports particularly and their sister want to come and plead their innocence before you  The Countess  Plead they are the last that I should suspect of such a deed And the Hon Mr Oddly  Augustus  Oh he is furious and told Julia that to look upon him as a thief was but a bad reception  The Countess  Julia was not rude I hope in telling them my message  Augustus  No mama quite otherwise She spoke with great politeness  The Countess  Then pray why was Mr Oddly angry There was nothing personal in what your sister said  Augustus  I cannot well tell the reason but Eliza drew him privately aside he would not condescend to hear her He is determined to be gone his hat is fortunately here he will come and fetch it and declares that he will not remain a minute in the house He threatens to complain to his papa  The Countess  Positively he must not go I will tell his lordship the whole affair myself when he comes to take him home  Augustus  The rest wish greatly for permission to appear and justify themselves before you  The Countess  There is no need of that I only wished to know if they could give me any information of the counters They are all of them too well brought up that I should venture to accuse them of a theft  ut I am well acquainted with the whims of children They will see every thing and finger every thing and from a want of thought might easily have put a thing into their pocket without any criminal intention  Augustus  Certainly they might mama as I did you remember when I took my sister's purse up by mistake and would have carried it away  The Countess  But softly here they areGo Jenny and enquire if Robert is preparing matters    Jenny goes out    SCENE VIII  The Countess Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia  The Countess  Well how fares it with you all my little friends I am glad to see you here  The Hon Mr Oddly  Miss Julia has just now informed us that your ladyship has lost six counters of the number with which unluckily we were playing I am sorry for it but could never think that your ladyship would have suspected any one of us of having taken them At least I can assure you for my sister and myself that we know nothing of them  The Countess  God forbid that I should suspect such wellbred children as I look upon you all to be Sure Julia did not tell you that I supposed you to have the counters  Eliza  No my lady all that she said was to enquire if we had brought them out through inattention or to play a little longer with them in the garden  The Countess  Which you might very innocently have done It is she alone that I blame in the affair because she did not let you have  her  counters  Gabriel  She designed I think to use them  Lucius  I would never dare to shew my face again if I had taken so much as a pin  Sophia    emptying her pockets    See my lady I have nothing here and there are no other pockets to my slip  The Countess  My dear children I have already told you that I am far from suspecting any of you to have them when you say that you have not They are certainly of no great value yet I cannot but confess that their loss affects me  The Hon Mr Oddly  Were they only worth a straw they are your ladyship's and should not now be missing But you know there are such things as servants and they  are not always very honest It is not the first time that we have suspected them at home  Julia  But it is the first time that any thing of the kind has happened in our house dear Mr Oddly I assure you  Augustus  I would answer for our servants men and women  The Countess  I have trusted them this long time but if you sir    to the Hon Mr Oddly    have made any observations I request you to let me know them  The Hon Mr Oddly  O no noBut when we went into the garden did notwhat is her namethe housemaid enter  The Countess  Jenny Oh I do not fear her These six years past that I have had her she might easily have made away with things of value had she been dishonest  The Hon Mr Oddly  Did not your old footman come in likewise I do not like his looks and should not chuse to meet him in a lane at night  The Countess  Fie sir what makes you thus suspect the honest Robert He was my fatherinlaw's confidential servant and has been much longer in the family than even I myself If  he  could possibly turn pilferer neither you nor I could know what living creature we might trust  The Hon Mr Oddly  It is not unlikely then but some one may have got into the room when we were gone  The Countess  That is not at all unlikely and I am going to enquire Amuse yourselves till I come back  The Hon Mr Oddly  No madam after what has passed I cannot stay longer here Augustus can you tell me where they have put my hat  Augustus  It is taken to be brushed you will have it brought you  The Hon Mr Oddly  I must have it instantly  Eliza  But won't you stay a little for papa You know he means to come and fetch us  The Countess  I cannot possibly let you go home on foot You would have upwards of three miles to walk Stay here till I return I will not detain you long  SCENE IX  Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia  The Hon Mr Oddly  I am very much astonished that your mama should have such thoughts of us We steal her counters  Julia  Sir she never had such a thought She might have fancied that we had put them without thought into our pockets I might as easily have taken them in this way as yourself or any other but to  steal  she did not mention the word or any like it  The Hon Mr Oddly  Had there been none here but tradesmen's children she might well have entertained suspicions but she should make some difference now  Gabriel  You speak of us sir I can see your looks inform me so But let me tell you in my turn that it is one's manners and principles and not birth that makes one truly noble  The Hon Mr Oddly  How these tradesmen talk about their manners You are very happy that there are so few children hereabout and that Augustus and myself are forced to make you our companions or have no diversion Did you live in London you would not have such an honour notwithstanding your fine manners  Augustus  Speak sir for yourself alone for just as here in London too I should be proud to entertain my little friends  Julia  Yes certainly They give us to the full as good examples as such whippershapper noblemen as you  Eliza  This brother you have deserved Why attack them first  The Hon Mr Oddly  And you too upon me You think certainly as I do though you will not confess it Have you forgot mama's instruction on the subject of familiarity with those beneath us "Never mix with tradesmen's children in the lower ranks of life you will always have low thoughts"  Augustus  And can you possibly suspect that my friends are capable of being thieves  Gabriel  Did we approach the table  Sophia  No whereas we saw you take the counters and look at them I suppose half a dozen times    The Hon Mr Oddly attempts to strike her Augustus and Gabriel hold his hand    Augustus  Softly You will have to deal with me else  Gabriel  No no my friend I thank you but I can take care of my sister Let him even threaten her I am not a bit more frightened at his size than his title  The Hon Mr Oddly  Oh it is far beneath me to dispute with traders  Julia  Very well I hope then it is beneath you likewise to attack a little girl  The Hon Mr Oddly  I shall not permit her to insult me  Eliza  She would certainly have done much better had she held her tongue  Julia  But being such a child she might be pardoned and particularly when she spoke the truth  The Hon Mr Oddly  The truth What do mean by that  Gabriel  She said that you took the counters and looked at them that is all Did she say any more And this certainly was true  The Hon Mr Oddly  I shan't even condescend to answer  Gabriel  You cannot take a better resolution when you have nothing but such answers for us  SCENE X  Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia the Countess  The Countess  What is the meaning of all this I will not have any quarrels here  The Hon Mr Oddly  My lady I expect you will do me justice on these little folks  The Countess  Folks folks who are they I am not accustomed to have such as visit here called so  Augustus  He is angry since we were not in a humour to endure his airs  Julia  He thought he should have had a company of dukes at least for playfellows  Gabriel  And imagines that we should be suspected of this theft much rather than a nobleman  Lucius  As if we had not a character to keep as well as he has  Sophia  Ay and would have beat me had not Gabriel taught him better  The Countess  Why sure it is not possible  Eliza  To say the truth my brother is too hasty  The Countess  Vivacity becomes his age very well but we should not be proud quarrelsome or rash Oh here is Robert  SCENE XI  The Countess Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia Robert carrying a basket covered with a napkin  Robert  There is no more to be said my lady Every body in this house is innocent as sure as my name is Robert but however for the satisfaction of the company I will introduce my cock who you must know beforehand is a conjurer    Putting down the basket on the table    Sophia    jumping for joy    O a cock a cock  Robert  Yes nothing more for look you    He lifts up a napkin in the basket so that Sophia and the rest discern the creature's neck and crest    Just like others saving that my cock has not his equal in the world for knowledge why he will tell me things which no other person possibly can know If a single straw and nothing else is missing I need only run and have a consultation with him he will be sure to know who stole it  Julia  You can then find out our counters can you  Robert  Can I Why last Christmas at the alehouse I had lost my pipe so what did I do but away and fetched my cock who let me know that the groom had got it and I think you recollect he broke his leg about a fortnight after  Sophia  He can talk then  Robert  Yes like other cocks  Cock cockadoodledoo  On which I understand him just as if it were you that spoke to me  Julia  Yet you never told us this before  Robert  Because we never yet lost any thing  The Countess  Well now a truce to all this conversation and begin  Robert  Not quite so fast my lady I must perform my conjuring in the dark  The Countess  A very easy matter You need only close the shutters  Julia  I will go out and push them to  The Countess  You are much too short you cannot reach them Robert will do that himself  Robert  Yes madam    He goes out    SCENE XII  The Countess Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia  Augustus    with the rest excepting the Hon Mr Oddly who appears embarrassed lifting up the napkin    This same cock seems supernatural I fancy    Looking at him earnestly    How his eyes shine  Julia  And his comb how red it looks my patience how it shakes upon his head  Sophia  Do you imagine then that it has so much knowledge as Robert says  Lucius  Papa has often told us what we ought to think of such strange stories  Gabriel  Robert is a cunning sportsman and I am sure can make birds hold their tongue much better with his fowling piece than teach a cock to talk by virtue of his wand  Eliza  Who knows my governess has told me many wond'rous things of conjuration and all that  The Hon Mr Oddly  I wonder sister you can listen to such stories  The Countess  I am glad you have these notions of the matter and should like to laugh at Robert for his folly What simplicity a cock discover thieves  The Hon Mr Oddly    forcing a smile    I fancy we shall have a deal of laughing very shortly    The shutters are closed all at once    But why put the shutters to    with uneasiness    I do not love darkness  Julia  If the cock cannot see he will never find the thief outWill he pray mama  The Countess  Well asked for I cannot tell you  Sophia  I should like if I knew how to make him speak Come pretty little cock say somethingSee how dark it isLook out a littleHe does not speak a word  Julia  The reason is I suppose he will obey his master only    Robert comes in again    SCENE XIII  The Countess Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia Robert  The Countess  Well you are satisfied now Robert since you have thus shut out the daylight  Robert  Yes my lady every thing is as it should be And so now let those remain that have not stolen the counters but if any one is guilty let that one go outWhat all remain  The Hon Mr Oddly  How cunning  Robert  I see clearly then that I must employ my art    He waves his wand and draws a circle on the floor pronouncing something unintelligible    That's well So now my cock take heed  And tell us who are rogues indeed  Come now my little gentlemen and ladies and let every one of you in turn lift up the napkin here and with his right hand do you see stroke Chanticleer upon the back You will hear his music when the thief once puts his hand upon him but do not lift the cloth too high just high enough to let your hand pass under it  So now my pretty cock take heed  And tell us who are rogues indeed  Well what will none of you begin  The Countess  What every one afraid Why one would think you all guilty at this rate  Sophia  I am the youngest but I will set the example    She lifts up the cloth and strokes the cock twice over in the basket    Do you see the cock does not speak It is not I that have stolen the counters  Robert  Very well Stand now in this place with your hand behind youIs it so  Sophia  Feel feel  Robert  That is right Now you sir    To Augustus    Augustus  Oh I fear as little as Miss SophiaThere He has not spokeMust I too hold my hand behind me  Robert  Certainly and every oneCome here by this young ladyWell another  Julia  I will go next    She strokes him    If he had said a word he would have been a storyteller  Robert  By your brother here Who is next  Eliza  It is my turn now    She strokes him    As mute as any mackerelYet I stroked him four times over  Robert  Are your right hands all behind you Do not forget that part  Gabriel    to the Hon Mr Oddly    I will follow you  The Hon Mr Oddly  As if I would have to do with such child's play  The Countess  You would not surely spoil our sport A little complaisance pray Mr Oddly  The Hon Mr Oddly  If that is all I have no objection    He puts his hand under the cloth    ThereI do not find he has spoke for me though I have stroked him more than others  Robert  Here sir with the rest and keep your hand behind you  Sophia  There are none now but my brothers left that have not stroked him It is one of themOh no I do not think so    Gabriel and Lucius imitate the others upon which the children all burst out a laughing    Lucius  And where is the thiefWhy no where  The Countess  Robert you should send your cock to Norwood he is not cunning enough and all this while my counters are not found  Robert  I must acknowledge this confounds meFor a little while however patience and do not stirStand still I sayThey are just like so much quicksilver My circle as I think must be imperfect I will go fetch a candle and examine I pray your ladyship let no one quit his place  SCENE XIV  The Countess Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia  The Hon Mr Oddly  I knew beforehand how all this would endStupid nonsense  Sophia  Why this cock is no wiser than his master  Eliza  Truly I am glad to see him caught  Julia  And what does he design to do when he has brought a light  The Countess  He will shew us  Sophia  I should like to see the cock nowHe will scarce hold his head up I suppose for shame  SCENE XV  The Countess Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia Robert  Robert    returning with a light and going up to Sophia    Come let me see your little hand    She holds him out the left    Not thisbut that behind you Good  Sophia    looking at her hand and crying out    Oh what a hand I have as black as any coal And will it always be so  Robert  Do not be frightened little miss I will speak about it to my cock and you shall have both hands as white as snow    The children have not patience but look all together at their hands and instantly cry out at once    Augustus  How black my singers are too  Julia  And mine likewise What does Robert mean by this  Eliza  I would twist the creature's neck off if I had him  Gabriel  Fegs my wristbands are come in a little for it  Lucius  It is as if my hand were painted  The Hon Mr Oddly    lifting up his hand in triumph    But see mine There is none of the company that has a hand fit to look at except me  Robert    taking hold of the Hon Mr Oddly by the collar    Very likely Then sir you have stole the counters Give them up young gentleman this instant or I will search your pockets and then blacken you all over  Eliza  Blacken him O brother if you have got the counters give them up this moment  The Countess  Take care Robert what you say  Robert  I am sure he has them So quit the counters or expect to have a countenance as grimy as the blackest negro's  The Hon Mr Oddly    turning pale and trembling    Is it possible that I should have put them in my pocket and not thought of what I was about    He feels about him    I recollect indeed I had them in my hand    He seems surprized at finding them thrust down into a corner of his waistcoat pocket    Dear me they are here indeed Who would have thought it    All the children look at one another with surprise while the Hon Mr Oddly stands confounded    The Countess  Robert    he approaches    take away your cock and candle and go open us the shutters Take care    in a whisper    not to tell your fellowservants how you found the counters Say that they were thrust a great way back into the tabledrawer  Robert  I will my lady    He goes out    SCENE XVI  The Countess Augustus Julia the Hon Mr Oddly Eliza Gabricl Lucius Sophia  The Countess  Go my little friends into the other room you will find water there to wash your hands Take care and do not splash one another's clothes  Sophia  No nobut if this black should not come off  The Countess  It is nothing but a little ivory black and water will remove it You sir    to the Hon Mr Oddly    as your hands are clean may stay with me  SCENE XVII  The Countess the Hon Mr Oddly  The Countess  Well then my haughty little gentleman and is it possible you could be guilty of so scandalous an action You that scarce a quarter of an hour ago looked down wi  h so much soorn upon the children of a reputable worthy tradesman and supposed your quality disgraced by being in their company They have at present their reverge since they may call you and with justice a vile thief  The Hon Mr Oddly  Pray pardon me my ladyI was playing with the countersand without considering at the moment must have put them into my pocketI have no other method of accounting for their being found upon me  The Countess  Pitiful excuse that aggravates your fault At such a tender age as yours could I have possibly imagined one with so much front  The Hon Mr Oddly  Believe me madam I had certainly no had designI took them without meaning so to do and afterwards concealed the matter from my crend of being taken for a thief  The Countess  But after I had bid my daughter make enquiry for them with such delicacy you might easily have seemed to search your peckets and restored them without blushing Your proceeding would have then been looked up was nothing but an inadvertoncy  The Hon Mr Oddly  I did not think of that my lady  The Countess  What then did you think when you durst drop hints that possibly my honest servants might have taken them or that my children's little friends were objects of suspicion What were your ideas when you made believe to st  ke the cock  The Hon Mr Oddly  But madam I  did  stroke him  The Countess  Hold your tongue you little rascal for that  is not too bad for your deservings Happlly as yet you have not got sufficient cunning to conceal your wicked actions  You did stroke the cock  Is that then your assertion Do not you see that if you had you would have blacked your hands as well as all the others  Robert having smeared him over with a certain composition Your companions were not in the least afraid to stroke him as their conscience did not any way reproach them for the theft but as for you the apprehension lest the servant's artifice might really be conju  ation awed you and the means that you chose to avoid detection have betrayed you Oh how politic you thought yourself I warrant in pretending only as you did to stroke the cock but honesty you would have found much better policy You deserve that I should tell my lord your father of your laudable behaviour when he comes to fetch you  The Hon Mr Oddly    falling on his knees    Oh no Pray my lady I beseech you He would beat me he would tread me under foot  The Countess  And it would be better that he should do so than bring up a monster to disgrace him at some future period for of what hereafter will you not be capable since in the season of your infancy as I may call it you can perpetrate so great a crime  The Hon Mr Oddly  Ah madam pardon me for pity's sake and never  The Countess  Doubtless you have often made these promises to others for this hardly is your first transgression Every circumstance confirms it So much falsity and impudence  The Hon Mr Oddly  Then hear me my good lady If you ever heat in future that I make free with any thing whatsoever that is not mine  The Countess  Inform me in the first place what did you intend to do with these six counters You could hardly think that you would have any opportunity of using them but they must instantly be known You meant to sell them then for money  The Hon Mr Oddly  No believe me I was pleased with looking at them I supposed that no one would remember having seen them elsewhere and on that account secreted them my lady  The Countess  And how could you desire to have another's property Confess Is this your first offence  The Hon Mr Oddly    hiding his face    No no indeed my lady I have often been a thief at home but never  having been suspected there I hoped to have the same good fortune here  The Countess  A very wicked sort of reasoning this For granting that no one upon earth suspected you do not you know that God sees and punishes whatever people do amiss Perhaps however this event is for your benefit and you will prove more likely to amend when you have once been punished as you merit  The Hon Mr Oddly  Let it be by you my lady or by any one but not by my papa Let him know nothing of the matter I conjure you Tell it if you please to my mama but keep the matter from his knowledge  The Countess  There again You would not have your father know it as you fear the blows that he might bestow upon you Thus it is nothing but an abjectness that guides you even in the work of your repentance and it is not for his peace of mind that you would conceal it from him for you are not afraid lest your mama should know it because she would not beat you It is not your idea to consult her peace of mind  The Hon Mr Oddly  Then tell it my preceptor  The Countess  I am sensible indeed how much the knowledge of your fault would mortally afflict your parents and from that consideration not upon your own account consent to spare you but on this condition that you come with your preceptor hither and before him let me have your solemn promise of amendment I will request him to keep watch upon your conduct but if ever you should break your word I will not only mention this adventure of the counters to his lordship but let every body else know it  The Hon Mr Oddly  I consent you should do so my lady  The Countess  You might think that after this I should forbid your keeping company with Julia and Augustus but I have at heart your reformation and will judge thereof myself You may continue therefore coming here  The Hon Mr Oddly  But how shall I dare to face your servants  The Countess  You have nothing to fear upon that account for I have had more care and forethought for your reputation than yourself by telling Robert not to speak about it in the kitchen and to hide your lie have been  compelled to one myself that they might not suppose you guilty  Mr Oddly  Ah my lady how much am I indebted to your bounty I shall never forget the service that you have done me But your childrenand the little company now with them  The Countess  I am well acquainted with their goodness and am sure that they will forgive you Call them    Mr Oddly with a downcast look goes slowly towards the door and bids them enter    SCENE XVIII  The Countess Mr Oddly Augustus Julia Eliza Gabriel Lucius Sophia  Eliza  Go sir you are a disgrace to me I will never call you brother again  The Countess  No my dear Eliza he is not so guilty as you think him He has told me every thing It was to play a little with the counters out of doors that he took them but when once the matter seemed considered as a theft he was terrified at the idea of incurring my suspicion This apparent guilt has sprung from a mistaken shame which I am very willing to excuse but not    looking at the little Davenports    his scandalous endeavours to make you my little dears seem guilty  Gabriel  Oh my lady we do not wish him any harm at present for it as we know that we should forgive even such as wrong us and particularly when we see them unhappy  The Countess  Do you mark that Mr Oddly Such a conduct ought to shew you how much nobler it is to have an elevated way of thinking than to boast an elevated birth You find yourself entirely at the mercy even of those whom you have insulted and with all the boast of your nobility you are the object of their pity  Mr Oddly  Oh what shame but I submit to undergo it  Gabriel  We will never introduce again the mention of this matter It shall be a secret for the time to come between us shan't it brother  Lucius  Yes he may rely upon my silence  Gabriel  And you sister  Sophia  I will not have him beat I know what pain it gives one    Mr Oddly in the transports of his gratitude embraces them    Mr Oddly  I desire but dare not ask to be acquainted with you for the future  Gabriel  It will be doing us an honour if you will still continue upon terms of friendship with us  Augustus and Julia  And for our part we shall be no less delighted with your company as long as you regard our friends  Eliza  You are all of you too good He does not merit such indulgence and papa must be informed of every thing  The Countess  You will lose my friendship and esteem entirely I must tell you Miss Eliza could you possibly be unaffected with your brother's laudable repentance when even strangers overlook his error Do not employ the advantage that his offence affords you to undo him in his parents' good opinion but for the future let your counsel shew him how to act that he may merit their affection I dare answer you need never be ashamed of any action of his hereafter  Mr Oddly  I should be unworthy of such bounty if this lesson could be blotted out from my remembrance  Sophia  Take due care it be not or  Beware of the conjuring Bird  THE END OF VOL III
