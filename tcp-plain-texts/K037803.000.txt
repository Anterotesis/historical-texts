Hands to make what Use of it I thought fit And tho' it cost our Author but the Labour of a single Month or less yet upon this Occasion I can't but think the publishing it will oblige the World since it is a Sequel to Mr  Philips  's Play of Duke  Humfrey  and an Introduction to Mr  Cibber  's Alteration of  Richard  the Third Never Child had a more regardless Father than the Parent of this and therefore rather than have it smother'd I thought it a more Human Act to let it come upon the Parish And in my poor Opinion I have seen a less promising Appearance than this Brat carries about him

Attendants  c  The Historical Tragedy of King HENRY VI  ACT I SCENE I  Enter King  Henry  K Hen  _NEVER had King less Joy in Rule than I  Nor more Misfortune Heaven was pleas'd to set  My Cradle on the Top of humane Glory  Where I lay helpless to all Storms expos'd  My childish Hand not able to support  My Father's Sword dropt the victorious Point  And let fall all the Laurels that adorn'd it  And  French  and  English  ravag'd for the Spoil  So lost I  France  now am I threatned too  By wicked Rebels with the Loss of  England  Cade  and  Plantagenet  joyn to undo me  Never did Subject long to be a King  As I do long and wish to be a Subject  Enter the Queen attended  Queen  Health and good Tidings to your Majesty  The Villain  Cade  is kill'd by brave young  Clifford  K Hen  Kill'd  Queen  He is kill'd my Lord and all his Powers do yield  And wait your Highness Doom of Life or Death  K Hen  Their Fault was great 'tis true but their Submission  Now cancels that and they shall meet my Mercy  Therefore with pleasing Pardon to them all  I do dismiss 'em to their several Homes  Queen  Kings should have Mercy but with it Justice too  K Hen  Just Heaven accept my Vows of Thanks and Praise  For having sav'd the Lives of my poor People  I swear I am more pleas'd to see this End  Without the Shedding my poor Subjects Blood  Than I should be to conquer the whole World  By SlaughterbutHa old  Clifford  weeping  Enter Old  Clifford  O Cliff  Yes Sir I weep but I weep Tears of Joy  For I am crush'd between Two mighty Joys  Your Royal Safety and my Son's Success  Enter Young  Clifford  and kneels  K Hen  O gallant  Clifford  how shall I reward thee  Y Cliff  I fought not for Rewards or if I did  I ought to end my Work e'er I be paid  I have only now pull'd down a paltry Scaffold  On which  Plantagenet  design'd to climb  To build his trayt'rous ProjectsHave you not heard  The Duke of  York  is newly come from  Ireland  And with a puissant and mighty Power  Is marching hitherwards in proud Array  K Hen  True he approaches with a mighty Host  But he gives out he only does intend  To drive away from me some wicked Ministers  Y Cliff  The constant Vizard of Rebellion  Rebellion is so foul and grim a Monster  That those who mount the horrid Beast are forc'd  To cover it all o'er with gawdy Trappings  They mark it in the Forehead with white Stars  Pretences heavenly  Queen  Believe me Sirhe tells you nought but Truth  K Hen  Thus stands my State 'twixt  Cade  and  York  distrest  Like to a Ship that having scap'd a Tempest  Is straitway calm'd and boarded with a Pirate  I pray thee old  Clifford  go and meet him  And ask him what's the Reason of these Arms  O Cliff  I will my Lord and doubt not so to deal  As all Things shall redound unto your Good  K Hen  Come Wife let's in and learn to govern better  For yet may  England  curse my wretched Reign  Exeunt  Enter  York Edward George Richard  and Soldiers  York  From  Ireland  thus comes  York  to claim his Right  And pluck the Crown from feeble  Henry  's Head  Oh holy Majesty who would not buy thee dear  Let them obey that know not how to rule  This Hand was made to handle nought but Gold  I cannot give due Action to my Words  Except a Sword or Sceptre ballance it  A Scepter shall it have Have I a Soul  On which I'll toss the Flower de Luce of  France  Enter Old  Clifford  Whom have we here old  Clifford  to disturb me  The King hath sent him sureI must dissemble  O Cliff  York  if thou meanest well I greet thee well  York  Clifford  of  Cumberland  I accept thy Greeting  Art thou a Messenger or come of Pleasure  O Cliff  A Messenger from  Henry  our dread Liege  To know the Reason of these Arms in Peace  Or why thou being a Subject as I am  Against thy Oath and true Allegiance sworn  Should raise so great a Pow'r without his Leave  Or dare to bring thy Force so near the Court  York  Scarce can I speak my Choler is so great  Oh I could hew up Rocks and fight with Flint  I am so angry at these abject Terms  And now like frantick  Ajax  On Sheep or Oxen could I spend my Fury  I am far better born than is the King  More like a King more kingly in my Thoughts  But I must make fair Weather yet a while  Till  Henry  be more weak and I more strong  aside  O  Cumberland  I prithee pardon me  That I have giv'n no Answer all this while  My Mind was troubled with deep Melancholy  The Cause why I have brought this Army hither  Is to remove proud  Somerset  from the King  Seditious to his Grace and to the State  O Cliff  That is too much Presumption on thy Part  But if thy Arms be to no other End  The King hath yielded unto thy Demand  The Duke of  Somerset  is in the Tower  York  Upon thy Honour Is he Prisoner  O Cliff  Upon my Honour he is Prisoner  York  Then noble  Clifford  I'll dismiss my Pow'rs  And let my Sovereign virtuous  Henry  Command my eldest Son nay all my Sons  As Pledges of my Fealty and Love  I'll send 'em all as willing as I live  Lands Goods House Armour every Thing I have  Is to his Use so  Somerset  may die  O Cliff  York  I commend this kind Submission  And I am sure 'twill glad King  Henry  's Heart  Come let us Two go friendly to the King  Enter King  Henry  attended  K Hen  Clifford  doth  York  intend no Harm to us  That thus he marches with thee Arm in Arm  York  In all Submission and Humility  York  doth present himself unto your Highness  K Hen  Then what intend these Forces thou dost bring  York  To have the Traytor  Somerset  from hence  And fight against that monstrous Rebel  Cade  Who since I hear is overcome and slain  Enter the Queen and  Somerset  K Hen  See old  Clifford Somerset  comes with the Queen  Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke  Queen  For thousand  Yorks  he shall not hide his Head  But boldly stand and front him to his Face  York  How now Is  Somerset  at Liberty  Then  York  unloose thy long imprison'd Thoughts  And let thy Tongue be equal with thy Heart  Shall I endure the Sight of  Somerset  False King why hast thou broken Faith with me  Knowing how hardly I can brook Abuse  King did I call thee no thou art no King  Nor fit to govern and rule Multitudes  Who has not Power to rule a single Traytor  That Head of thine doth not become a Crown  Thy Hand is made to grasp a Palmer's Staff  And not to grace an awful princely Scepter  That Gold must round engirt these Brows of mine  Whose Smile and Frown like to  Achilles  's Spear  Is able with the Change to kill and cure  Here is a Hand to hold the Scepter up  And with the same to act controuling Laws  Give Place by Heav'n thou shalt rule no more  O'er him whom Heav'n created for thy Ruler  Som  O monstrous Traytor I arrest thee  York  Of capital Treason 'gainst the King and Crown  York  Somerset  in whose Name do you arrest me  Som  In the King's Name  York  Then I'll unfold my self  Know hitherto I've been like a dark Cloud  Where scorching Heat has been engendring Thunder  The Grumbling and the Rowling you have heard  And now the deadly Bolt shalt light among you  I am your King  K Hen  Ha  York  Yes I am your King  Sprung from the Royal House of  Clarence  Whom three Usurpers of the House of  Lancaster  Successively have trodden under Feet  Whilst they have glitter'd in our Royal Glory  Shone like false Diamonds in our Purple Robes  Enter young  Clifford  Y Cliff  Health and all Happiness to my Lord the King  York  I thank thee  Clifford  say What News with thee  Nay think not to fright me with an angry Look  We are thy Sovereign  Clifford  kneel thee down  For thy mistaking so we pardon thee  Y Cliff  This is my King  York  I do not mistake  But thou mistakest much to think I do  To  Bedlam  with himIs the Man grown mad  K Hen  Ay  Clifford  Frenzy and ambitious Humour  Make him oppose himself against his King  Y Cliff  Did we not tell you this  Edw  And we will tell you more obey your King  I mean my Royal Father or our Swords  Shall turn the Arrest of Treason on your selves  O Cliff  Surely you think you are among your Beauties  Amorous  Edward  there your Valour lies  Queen  Let them admire thy Boasts here art thou scorn'd  Edw  'Tis said when the brave Duke of  Suffolk  liv'd  Queen  Margaret  would not contemn a Lover  I'm young and love but yet I am not stricken  So blind with Beauty but I can discern  Both the fair Kingdom and the fair Queen lie  Sick of the Impotence of a weak King  Queen  Ill manner'd Insolence  Y Cliff  Why what a brood of Traytors have we here  York  Look in a Glass and call thy Image so  I am thy King and thou a false hearted Traytor  I've declar'd my Right and here are my three Sons  To plead it with their Swords Now I'll produce  The Sword of the Victorious Earl of  Warwick  Call in the Earl  Enter  Warwick  K Hen  Thou against me  Warwick  Say didst thou never swear Allegiance to me  And canst dispense with Heav'n for such an Oath  War  It is great Sin to swear unto a Sin  But greater Sin to keep a sinful Oath  Who can be bound by any solemn Vow  To do a murderous Deed to rob a Man  To force a spotless Virgin's Chastity  To 'reave the Orphan of his Patrimony  And have no other Reason for his Wrong  But that he was bound to't by solemn Oath  Queen  A subtle Traytor needs no Sophister  War  Cause I ador'd an Idol once in Ignorance  Must I still do so now I see my Error  Know Duke of  Lancaster  for you are no more  Henry  your Grandfather murder'd his King  Richard  the Second not content with that  He trampled on the Rights of the next Heirs  Your Father warlike  Henry  I confess  Had in Desert what he did want in Title  But Merit makes no lawful Claim to Crowns  For if it did I wou'd be King of  England  But I will tell you to your Face Duke  Henry  That you have neither Title nor Desert  Queen O Cliff Y Cliff Som  Most impudent of Traytors  War  I'll speak Truth  And value not the Fury of you all  Your Father  Henry  was a Wall of Steel  Thro' which there was no Passage to the Throne  But you are only a soft silken Curtain  Which with my Hand or Breath I'll put aside  And seat your self King  Richard  in the Throne  For it is empty tho' the Duke be there  Y Cliff  What have these Traytors conquer'd us already  They talk at this bold Rate Thou Traytor  Warwick  Warwick  no when thou dethron'st thy King  Thou mad'st thy self a Groom by the same Law  Thou tramplest on thy King a sawcy Groom  May set his dirty Foot upon thy Jaws  And tell thee they were made both of one Clay  Edw  What a fierce Talker's this  War  I laugh at him  All this loud Noise and Fury you have heard  Is but the Crackling of some burning Thorn  That hedge the Duke and they will soon be Ashes  Queen  Wherefore does  Henry  parley with these Miscreants  Let's draw the Sword and chase these Rebels hence  Daily Disturbers of our Peace  York  Poor  Margaret  I cannot blame thy Rage but pity thee  For thou hast cause to rail since from the Fall  Of good Duke  Humphrey  all those Schemes prov'd Air  Which hop'd Success from noble  Gloster  's Death  Mark Heaven's Vengeance  Queen  Proud insulting  York  Call  Buckingham  and bid him arm himself  York  Call  Buckingham  and all the Friends thou hast  I am resolv'd for Death or Dignity  O Cliff  The first I warrant theeif Dreams prove true  War  You were best go to Bed and dream again  To keep thee from the Tempest of the Field  O Cliff  I am resolv'd to bear a greater Storm  Than any thou can'st conjure up to Day  Y Cliff  And so to Arms my brave and noble Father  To quell the Rebels and their Complices  War  And Royal  Richard  fix'd on Loyal  Warwick  Stand like a Cedar on a Mountain Top  Securely rooted and despise all Storm  Edw  Now sound the Trumpets and each Mandraw his Sword  A Crown's the Prize and Victory the Word  K Hen  My Cause is fix'd in Heaven for it is just  And more in Heaven than our Arms I trust  Exeunt severally  A great Charge here  Enter  Warwick  and  York  Meeting  War  How now my noble Lord What all a foot  York  The deadly handed  Clifford  slew my Steed  And I have made a Prey for Kites and Crows  Even of the bonny Beast he lov'd so well  Enter old  Clifford  War  Old  Clifford  now prepare to meet thy Fate  York  Hold  Warwick  seek thou out some other Chase  For I my self must hunt this Deer to Death  War  Then nobly  York  'tis for a Crown thou fight'st  As I intend  Clifford  to thrive to Day  It grieves my Soul to leave thee unassail'd  Exit  O Cliff  York  with thy Bearing shou'd I be in love  But that 'tis shewn ignobly and in Treason  York  So let it help me now against thy Sword  As I in Justice and true Right express it  They fight  Clifford  falls  Farewel old valiant  Clifford  I should now  Be sorry for thee wert thou not my Enemy  Exit  O Cliff  I do not lack thy Sorrow thou art a Traytor  And I for Loyalty die honourably  Enter  Richard  and  Somerset  They fight  Somerset  falls  Rich  So lie thou there  For underneath an Alehouse paltry Sign  The  Castle  in St  Albans Somerset  Hath made the Wizard famous in his Death  Sword hold thy Temper Heart be wrathful still  Priests pray for Enemies but Princes kill  Exit  Enter young  Clifford  Y Cliff  Shame and Confusion all is on the Rout  My Men are fied or slain and I alone  Stand like a lofty Mast shewing my Head  Above the Waves when all the Ship is sunk  I cannot find my Father nor my King  O Cliff  Oh Son  Y Cliff  Ha  Methought I heard a Voice resembling much  My Father's very weak and faint it seem'd  As he were far from me or near to Death  O Cliff  Oh  Clifford  'tis thy aged Father calls  Y Cliff  Ha Oh there he lies  All wel'tring in his Gore gasping for Life  Oh Father Father if thou hast Breath enough  Leave with me but the Name of him that wounded thee  That I may give thee and my Self Revenge  And I'll prefer that glorious Legacy  Before the Estate and Honour which thou leav'st me  O Cliff  Plantagenet  gave me my Death Farewel  dies  Y Cliff  Plantagenet  gave thee thy Death  Plantagenet  Then gave himself and all his Race Destruction  Now let the general Trumpet blow his Blast  And Nature start at this great deadly Shock  Wast thou ordain'd Oh my dear loving Father  To lose thy Youth in Peace and in thy Age  To die in Ruffian Battle Ev'n at this Sight  My Heart is turn'd to Stone and from this Time  I will be famous for inhuman Cruelty  Tears to me shall be as the Dew to Fire  And Beauty that the Tyrant oft reclaims  Shall to my flaming Wrath be Oil and Flax  Ne'er more will I have ought to do with Pity  Meet I an Infant of the House of  York  Into as many Gobbets will I cut it  As wild  Medea  young  Absurtus  did  York  kills our old Men and I'll kill his Children  That when he's dead he may not have a Son  To bear him to the Grave as I my Father  Alas he hears me nothe's dead he's gone  Come thou new Ruin of old  Clifford  's House  As did  Aeneas  old  Anchises  bear  So I'll bear thee upon my manly Shoulders  But then  Aeneas  bare a living Load  Nothing so heavy as these Woes of mine  Exit  Trumpets sound and great Shouts Enter  York Edward Richard George  and Soldiers  York  Of brave  Warwick  Who can report of him  This happy Day  Is not it self nor have we won one Foot  If that brave Man be lost  Rich  My noble Father  Three Times to Day I help'd him to his Horse  Three Times bestrid him thrice I led him off  Perswaded him from any further Act  And still where Danger was still there I met him  But Noble as he is look where he comes  Enter  Warwick  York  Let me embrace the greatest Man that breathes  Geo  England  will learn again to fight and conquer  A glorious Science we have almost lost  Under the Reign of this tame bookish King  War  What is become of the young boasting  Clifford  Fate as if tender of him did to Day  When e'er I met him thrust a Crowd betwixt us  York  I met his Father in the Field and there  I put the brave old Man to his last Bed  The stout old Winter Lion that had long  Endur'd the Brush of Time fought with that Heat  As he had been but in the Spring of Youth  Like  Arras  Hangings in a homely House  So was his gallant Spirit in his Body  Edw  Whilst we pursu'd the HorseMen of the North  With too much Heat the King escap'd our Hands  But he has left behind some of his Friends  I fell upon the gallant Duke of  Buckingham  And with one fortunate substantial Blow  I cleft his good steel Helmet and his Scull  War  Now by my Sword well hast thou fought to Day  So did we all  And by my Life Lords 'twas a glorious Day  St  Alban  's Battle worthy famous  York  Shall be eterniz'd in all Age to come  But now my Lord post we with speed to  London  For thither I am told the King is fled  And there he will repair this Day's wide Breach  Citizens always love tame pious Princes  And such as abhor fighting like themselves  Then if you can enter the Town before 'em  And fill it with your Troops and see to Morrow  To get early into the Parliament House  There guarded well openly claim the Crown  My Tongue and Sword shall both assert your Title  Then let me see who shall dare be so bold  To gainsay what we with our Swords assert  York  Thou Soul of Valour Wisdom and Nobility  I'll take thy Counsel  War  Come then away  Our Enemies gain Strength by our Delay  Exeunt  End of the First ACT  ACT II  York Edward George Richard Warwick  and other Lords  c  discover'd as in Parliament  York  _YE Peers of  England  having shown my Title  And you approving my just Pedigree  I take Possession of my Royal Right  And to my Death my Scepter I'll maintain  Enter King  Henry Clifford  and others  K Hen  My Lords look where the sturdy Rebel fits  Young Lord  Cumberland  he slew thy Father  And I do think that you have vow'd Revenge  On him his Sons his Favourites and his Friends  Cliff  The Hope thereof makes  Clifford  mourn in Steel  War  What say you  Lancaster  will you resign  In Peace the Crown to him whose Right it is  Or shall we force it from you with our Swords  Cliff  What shall we suffer this Lets pluck him down  My Heart for Anger burns I cannot brook it  My gracious Lord here in the Parliament  Let us assail the Family of  York  K Hen  Far be the Thought of Strife from  Henry  's Heart  So to abuse this Place's Dignity  No my Lord  Clifford  Frowns Words and Threats  Shall be the War that  Henry  means to use  Thou factious Duke of  York  descend the Throne  And kneel for Grace and Mercy at my Feet  I am thy Sovereign  York  Henry  I am thine  K Hen  And shall I stand and thou sit in my Throne  York  It must and shall be soContent thy self  War  Be Duke of  Lancaster  so he is King  Cliff  He is both Duke of  Lancaster  and King  And that I  Clifford  boldly will maintain  War  And  Warwick  shall disprove it you forget  That we are those who chas'd you from the Field  And slew your Fathers and with Colours spread  March'd thro' the City to the Palace Gates  Cliff  Urge it no more lest that instead of Words  I send thee  Warwick  such a Messenger  As shall revenge his Death before I stir  Plantaganet  of thee and these thy Sons  Thy Favourites and Friends I'll have more Lives  Than Drops of Blood were in my Father's Veins  War  Poor  Clifford  how we scorn thy worthless Threats  York  Will you we show our Title to the Crown  If not our Swords shall plead it in the Field  Edw  Good Father as you love and honour Arms  Let's fight it out and not stand brawling thus  Rich  Sound but the Trumpet and the King will fly  York  Peace Sons  K Hen  Peace all of you and hear your King  Rebels I fear all Danger less than you  For I am better arm'd with Innocence  But I confess I fear a Civil War  Not for my own but for my People's Sake  I am afraid indeed of shedding Blood  But you are all most bold in Cruelty  By which O Heaven judge whose is the Child  His who desires to have it cut in Pieces  Or mine who strive in Tenderness to save it  Rebels may be successful for a Time  And overturn all Order Right and Justice  But Heaven does not let the World stand long  In that unnatural uneasy Posture  Just Heaven point out the Course I am to take  I shudder at the Thought of Civil War  And shall I tamely then resign the Crown  So bravely fought for by my Ancestors  I know not what to do I shall run mad  York  Thy own Mouth  Henry  has pronounc'd thy Doom  Successful Murder and Rebellion  Swell'd for two Generations of thy Race  Over all Right and all that durst oppose 'em  But Heaven in thee has dry'd up the black Stream  And made it such a Brook all trample over it  K Hen  Think'st thou I will leave my kingly Throne  Wherein my Grandsire and my Father sat  No First shall War unpeople this my Realm  Ay and their Colours often born in  France  And now in  England  to our Heart's great Sorrow  Shall be my Winding SheetThen fear not Lords  My Title's good and better far than his  Cliff  There spoke a King indeed  York  Henry  do but prove  Thy Title good and thou shalt reign as King  K Hen  Henry  the Fourth by Conquest got the Crown  York  'Twas in Rebellion 'gainst his lawful King  K Hen  Tell me may not a King adopt an Heir  York  What then  K Hen  Why if he may then am I lawful King  For  Richard  in the View of many Lords  Resign'd his Crown to  Henry  the Fourth  Whose Heir my Father was and I am his  York  Did not thy Grandfather compel him to't  By Force of Arms and then the Parliament  To their eternal Shame and Infamy  Flatter'd the wicked fortunate Usurper  War  But say the King had done it unconstrain'd  He could not give away another's Right  Henry  usurp'd the Right of the next Heirs  York  To prove this true read the last Words of  Mortimer  Who dy'd in Prison in your Minor Days  And dying breath'd these Words into my Ears  Delivers a Scrowl to  Henry    That those were the Words of that injur'd Man  I will maintain both with my Oath and Sword  K Hen  I know not what to saymy Title's weak  Cliff  How Sir will you revolt from your own self  Who will stand by you then  War  Clifford  thou dy'st  If thou permit'st not  Henry  to resign  Cliff  Let  Henry  give his Title to the Crown  He shall not give my Title to Revenge  King  Henry  be thy Title right or wrong  Lord  Clifford  vows to fight in thy Defence  May that Ground gape and swallow me alive  Where I shall kneel to him that slew my Father  War  Do Right unto this princely Duke of  York  Or I will fill the House with armed Men  And o'er the Chair of State where now he sits  Write up his Title with usurping Blood  K Hen  Hold hold my LordsOh let not Blood be shed  First hear the Proffers that I have to make  And hearken allI find my Title's weak  And to defend it were to fight with Justice  Besides there lies already on my Head  The Blood of  Richard  murder'd by my Grandfather  And I'd be loth to add my People's Blood  For saving which hear this Proposal from me  I have been King these Eight and Thirty Years  And many Interests must grow to mine  That you can never tear me from the Throne  But you will set a Thousand Veins a bleeding  Then let me Reign in Quiet all my Life  And when I'm dead  Plantagenet  be King  York  I approve of it and on that Condition  I swear to be King  Henry  's Vassal  K Hen  And not to seek the Crown by Arms or Treason  York  Never whilst King  Henry  lives  K Hen  Then I intail  The Crown to thee and to thy Heirs for ever  Cliff  What Wrong is this unto the Prince your Son  War  What Good is this to  England  and himself  Cliff  Base fearful and despairing  Henry  How hast thou injur'd both thy self and us  But I will haste to inform the Queen of this  Farewel fainthearted and degenerate King  In whose cold Blood no Spark of Honour bides  If thy great Father  Henry  's Soul did see  Thy Baseness it wou'd torture him in Heav'n  Plantagenet  when that great Monarch liv'd  Thou durst have sooner let into thy Soul  Ten Thousand Devils than a Traytor's Thought  Henry  adieu be thou a Prey to  York  And die in Bonds for this unmanly Deed  In dreadful War may'st thou be overcome  Or live in Peace abandon'd and despis'd  Exit  York  Sons head the Troops before the Palace Gates  Lest furious  Clifford  shou'd disturb our Peace  Exit  K Hen  Oh  War  Why sigh you Sir  K Hen  Not for my self but my poor Son I've wrong'd  War  You have not wrong'd him you have wholly freed him  From all the Vengeance due to Usurpation  York  I hear the Queen has rais'd Forces in the North  My Lord of  Warwick  attend you the King  And stay to raise what Force you can in  London  Whilst I post to the North and so between us  We'll wall her in and keep that Fire from spreading  Exit  K Hen  Pray do my Lords I will assist you both  Against my self but Justice shall be done  See yonder comes my Queen whose unkind Looks  Strike Terror to me oh I dare not stay  To hear the Bitterness of her Reproaches  Enter the Queen and Prince  Queen  Where is the King What do you shun me Sir  Nay go not from me I will follow thee  K Hen  Be patient gentle Queen and I will stay  Queen  Who can be patient in such sad Extremes  Oh wretched Man wou'd I had dy'd a Maid  And never seen thee never bore the Son  Since thou hast prov'd so unnatural a Father  Hath he deserv'd to lose his Birthright thus  Hadst thou but lov'd him half so much as I  Or felt that Pain which I did for him once  Or nourish'd him as I did with my Blood  Thou would'st have left thy dearest Heart Blood here  Rather than make rebellious  York  thine Heir  And difinherited thine only Son  K Hen  The Crown is his I have no Title to it  But what is founded on Rebellion  The Murder of a King and Usurpation  Queen  I shame to hear thee speak thou timorous Wretch  Thou hast undone thy self thy Son and me  And giv'n to the House of  York  such Head  As thou shalt reign but by their Sufferance  To intail him and his Heirs unto the Crown  What is it but to make thy Sepulchre  And creep into it far before thy Time  Had I been here who am a poor weak Woman  The Soldiers should have toss'd me on their Pikes  E'er I had stoop'd to such unnatural Baseness  Oh my dear Son thou art no more a Prince  Because thy Father is no more a King  By one base Deed he has undone us all  Prince  I am a Prince and I will be a King  Father you cannot disinherit me  You may bestow your Kingdom whilst you live  But when you are dead the Crown by Right is mine  And by the sacred Memory of my Ancestors  I'll bear no Head that does not wear a Crown  Queen  My Son he shall not disinherit thee  I have Men here to guard us from the Rebels  And Troops elsewhere to conquer 'em and chastise  And I will make thee Son a glorious Prince  Whilst thou tame Wretch shalt be a Slave to Traytors  And only be a Shadow of a King  K Hen  Oh my sweet Love talk not so harshly to me  Queen  I will be harsher in my Deeds than Words  For from this Moment I divorce my self  Both from thy Table  Henry  and thy Bed  Until that Act of Parliament be repeal'd  Whereby my Son is disinherited  K Hen  Stay gentle  Margaret  and hear me speak  Queen  Thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone  K Hen  Then my Son  Edward  wilt thou stay with me  Queen  Ay to be murder'd by his Enemies  No thou shalt have no Sons of me to ruin  I scorn to be the Mother of a Slave  Prince  When I return with Victory from the Field  I'll see your Grace till then I'll follow her  Queen  Come Son away we may not linger thus  Exeunt  K Hen  Poor Queen how Love and Pity for my Son  Cause Rage in her as they cause Grief in me  War  Add her Ambition to her Love and Pity  For that has no small Share in her Disturbance  But come my Liege let us straight call a Council  So to prevent her spreading farther Mischief  K Hen  With all my Heart my noble Lord of  Warwick  For O I'm weary of these deadly Broils  To you I'll readily submit vain Rule  Tho' on my self I sure Destruction bring  E'er I'll hurt  England  I'll not reign your King  Exeunt  Enter  York Edward  and  Richard  Rub  Father I think I've plainly made appear  Your Oath to be most vain and frivolous  Therefore to Arms and Father do but think  How sweet a Thing it is to wear a Crown  Within whose Circuit is  Elisium  And all that Poets seign of Bliss and Joy  Why do we linger thus I cannot rest  Until the white Rose that I wear be dy'd  E'en in the lukewarm Blood of  Henry  's Heart  York

'Twere not Revenge sufficient for my Wrath  No if I dig'd up thy Forefathers Graves  It cou'd not slake mine Ire or ease my Heart  The Sight of any of the House of  York  Is as a Fury to torment my Soul  And till I root out the accursed Line  And leave not one alive I live in Hell  Therefore  Rut  Oh let me pray before I take my Death  To thee I praysweet  Clifford  pity me  Cliff  Such Pity as my Rapier's Point affords  Rut  Hear me but one Word more dear brave Lord  Clifford  You have a Son for his sake pity me  Lest in Revenge thereof since Heaven is just  He be as miserably slain as I

have behav'd themselves  Like Men born to Renown by Life or Death  Three Times did  Richard  make a Lane to me  And thrice cry'd Courage Father fight it out  And full as oft came  Edward  to my side  With purple Falchion painted to the Hilt  In Blood of those who had encounter'd him  Richard  cry'd Charge and give no Foot of Ground  We'll have a Crown or else a glorious Tomb  A Sceptre or an earthly Sepulchre  With this we charg'd again but soon alas  Retir'd back as I have seen a Swan  With bootless Labour swim against the Tide  And spend her Strength with overmatching Waves  Ah hark the

Pleasure of Revenge  York  Thou bloody raging  Clifford  do thy worst  I'd scorn to ask thee Mercy hadst thou any  But thou hast none then come with all thy Multitudes  Cliff  So Cowards fight when they can fly no farther  So Pidgeons peck the Falcon's piercing Talons  So desperate Thieves breathe Curses at their Officers  York  So triumph Thieves upon their conquer'd Beauty  So true Men yield

Father  York  And now would thee wer't thou not back'd with Multitudes  Cliff  I will try thatstand off and do not touch him  Unless I fallthen cut him all to pieces  I will not lose Revengeyet I will give him  So much Revenge to kill me if he can  York  I thank thee for this Kindness 'tis a great one  Queen  Hold  Clifford  do not Honour him so much  To prick thy Finger though it wound his Heart  What Valour were it when a Cur doth grin  For one to thrust his Hand between his Teeth  When he might spurn him with his Foot away  It is War's Prize to take all Vantages  And valiant  Clifford  for a Thousand Causes  I wou'd prolong a while the Traytor's Life  What was it you that wou'd be  England  's King  Wast you that revell'd in our Parliaments  And made a Preachment of your high Descent  Where are your Mess of Sons to back you now  The wanton  Edward  and the lusty  George  And where's that valiant Crookback'd Prodigy  Dicky  your Boy that with his grumbling Voice  Was won't to cheer his Dad in Mutinies  And with the rest where is your darling  Rutland  Look  York  I stain'd this Napkin with the Blood  That valiant  Clifford  with his Rapier's Point  Made issue from the Bosom of thy Boy  I bring it thee to wipe away thy Tears  Alas poor  York  but that I hate thee deadly  I should lament thy miserable State  York  Oh Tiger's Heart wrap'd in a Woman's Hide  How cou'dst thou drain the LifeBlood of a Child  To bid his Father wipe his Eyes withal  And yet be seen to wear a Woman's Face  Queen  Why this I did  York  to increase thy Sorrow  I know a Parent's Love and thy fond Love  And all the Mysteries of thy haughty Heart  I knew that thou wouldst Barricado it  Against the Losses of a Crown and Life  With Iron Bars of Stubbornness and Pride  But Oh this Bloodlike Oil will sink into it  These crimson Threads will lead tormenting Grief  Into the inmost Lodgings of thy Soul  And lest this Napkin be too soft a Thing  I have at Hand an Engin that shall squeeze  Thy Soul into thy Eyesbring  Rutland's  Body  Rutland's Body brought in  York  She Wolf of  France  for Woman thou art    Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible  Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless  Wouldst have me rage why now thou hast thy Will  Wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy Wish  These Tears are my sweet  Rutland  's Obsequies  And every Drop cries Vengeance to his Death  'Gainst thee fell  Clifford  and thou false  French  Woman  Oh my sweet Boy  Queen  Why this is Musick to me  This is the part thou mean'st I shou'd have play'd  If thy accursed Treasons had succeeded  But that my Tragedy must have been deeper  And bloodier far thou mean'st I should have wept  For a lost Kingdom Husband and a Son  York  See ruthless Queen a hapless Father's Tears  This Cloth thou dip'dst in Blood of my sweet Boy  And I with Tears do wash the Blood away  Keep thou the Napkin and go boast of this  And if thou tell'st the heavy Story right  Upon my Soul the Hearers will shed Tears  Yea ev'n my Foes will shed fast falling Tears  And say alas it was a piteous Deed  May in thy need such Comfort come to thee  As now I reap at thy most cruel Hand  Hard hearted  Clifford  take me from the World  My Soul to Heaven my Blood upon thy Head  Cliff  Here's for my Oath and for my Father's Death  And here's to Right our gentle hearted King  Stabs  York  York  Open

of the Second ACT  ACT III SCENE I  Enter  Edward Richard  and Soldiers  Edw  _I Wonder how our princely Father 'scap'd  Or whether he be 'scap'd away or no  From  Clifford  's and  Northumberland  's Pursuit  Had he been ta'en or kill'd we had heard the News  Or otherwise methinks we should have heard  The happy Tidings of his good Escape  How fares my Brother Why are you sad  Rich  I cannot Joy until I am resolv'd  What is become of our right valiant Father  I saw him in the Battle range about  And watch'd him how he singled  Clifford  forth  Methought he bore him in the thickest Troop  As doth a Lion 'mongst a Herd of Deer  Or as a Bear encompass'd round with Dogs  Who having pinch'd a few and made 'em cry  The rest stand all aloof and bark at him  So far'd our Father with his Enemies  See how the Morning opes her golden Gates  And takes her Farewel of the glorious Sun  How well resembles it the Prime of Youth  Trimm'd like a Yonker prancing to his Love  Edw  Dazzle my Eyes or do I see three Suns  Rich  Three glorious Suns each one a perfect Sun  Not separated with the racking Clouds  But sever'd in a pale clear shining Sky  See see they join embrace and seem to kiss  As if they vow'd some League inviolable  Now are they but one Lamp one Light one Sun  In this the Heav'ns figure some Event  Edw  'Tis wond'rous strange the likeyet never heard of  I think it cites us Brother to the Field  That we the Sons of brave  Plantagenet  Each one already blazing by our Deeds  Should notwithstanding join our Lights together  And over shine the Earth as this the World  Whate'er it bodes henceforward will I bear  Upon my Target Three fair shining Suns  Enter Gentleman  But what art thou whose heavy Looks foretel  Some dreadful Story hanging on thy Tongue  Gent  One that was a woful Looker on  When as the noble Duke of  York  was slain  Your princely Father and my noble Lord  Edw  Oh speak no more For I have heard too much  Rich  Say how he dy'd for I will hear it all  Gent  Environ'd he was with many Foes  And stood against 'em as the Hope of  Troy  Against the  Greeks  that would have enter'd there  But  Hercules  himself must yield to odds  And many Strokes tho' with a little Ax  Hews down and fells the hardest timber'd Oak  By many Hands your Father was subdu'd  But only slaughter'd by the ireful Arm  Of unrelenting  Clifford  whilst the Queen  Laugh'd in his Face and when with Grief he wept  The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his Cheeks  A Napkin steeped in the harmless Blood  Of sweet young  Rutland  by rough  Clifford  slain  And after many Scorns many foul Taunts  They took his Head and on the Gates of  York  They set the same and there it doth remain  The saddest Spectacle that e'er was view'd  Edw  Oh  Clifford  flinty  Clifford  thou hast crop'd  The Flower of  Europe  for his Chivalry  And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him  For Hand to Hand he would have vanquish'd thee  Now my Soul's Palace is become a Prison  Oh wou'd she break from hence that this my Body  Might in the Ground be closed up in Rest  For I henceforth shall never joy again  Never Oh never shall I know more Joy  Rich  I cannot weep for all my Body's Moisture  Scarce serves to quench my Furnace burning Heart  Nor can my Tongue unload my Heart's great Burden  For the same Wind that I shou'd speak withal  Is kindling Coals that fire up all my Breast  And burn me up with Flames that Tears would quench  To weep is to make less the Depth of Grief  Tears then for Babes but dear Revenge for me  Richard  I bear thy Name I'll 'venge thy Death  Or die renowned by attempting it  Enter  Warwick  and Soldiers  War  Now noble Lords tell me what News abroad  Edw  O  Warwick Warwick  great  Plantagenet  Is by the stern Lord  Clifford  put to Death  War  Some Time ago I drown'd this News in Tears  After the bloody Fray at  Wakefield  fought  Where your brave Father breath'd his latest Gasp  Tidings as swiftly as the Post could run  Were brought me of your Loss and his Depart  I then in  London  Keeper of the King  Muster'd my Soldiers gather'd Flocks of Friends  March'd towards St  Albans  to intercept the Queen  Bearing the King in my Behalf along  For by my Scouts I was advertis'd  That she was coming with a full Intent  To dash our late Decrees in Parliament  Touching King  Henry  's Oaths and your Succession  Short Tale to make we at St  Albans  met  Our Battles join'd and for long Time we fought  But whether 'twas the Coldness of the King  Who look'd full gently on his warlike Queen  That robb'd my Soldiers of their heated Spleen  Or whether 'twas Report of her Success  Or more than common Fear of  Clifford  's Vigor  Who thunders to his Captives Blood and Death  I cannot judge but to conclude with Truth  Their Weapons like to Light'ning came and went  Our Soldiers like the NightOwls lazy Flight  Or like a lazy Thrasher with his Flail  Fell gently down as if they struck their Friends  I cheer'd 'em up with Justice of our Cause  With Promise of high Pay and great Reward  But all in vain they had no Heart to fight  And we in them no Hope to win the Day  So that we fled the King unto the Queen  Lord  George  your Brother  Norfolk  and my self  With th' utmost speed are come to join with you  For in the Marshes here we heard you were  Making another Head to fight again  Edw  Where is the Duke of  Norfolk  noble  Warwick  And when came  George  from  Burgundy  to  England  War  Some four Miles off the Duke is with the Soldiers  And for your Brother he was lately sent  From your kind Aunt Dutchess of  Burgundy  With needful Aid of Soldiers to this War  And ev'ry Minute I expect him here  Rich  'Twas Odds belike when valiant  Warwick  fled  Oft have I heard his Praises in Pursuit  But ne'er till now his Scandal of Retreat  War  Nor now my Scandal  Richard  Dost thou hear  For thou shalt know this strong right Hand of mine  Can pluck the Diadem from faint  Henry  's Head  And wring the awful Scepter from his Hand  Were he as famous and as bold in War  As he is fam'd for Mildness Peace and Prayer  Rich  I know it well Lord  Warwick  blame me not  'Tis Love I bear thy Glories makes me speak  But in this busy Time what's to be done  Shall we go throw away our Coats of Steel  And wrap our Bodies in black Mourning Gown  Numb'ring our  Ave Maries  with our Beads  Or shall we on the Helmets of our Foes  Tell our Devotion with revengeful Arms  If for the last say ay and to it Lords  War  Why therefore  Warwick  came to seek you out  And therefore comes my Brother  Mountague  Then once again let's stride our foaming Steeds  And once again cry Charge upon our Foes  But never more will we turn back and fly  Rich  Ay now indeed I hear great  Warwick  speak  Ne'er may he live to see a Sunshine Day  That cries Retreat if  Warwick  bid him stay  Enter  George  and Soldiers  Edw  My Brother  George  take a short Soldiers Welcome  I have not Time to greet thee as I ought  For we are going to a glorious Feast  Geo  I heard of our great Father's sad Misfortunes  And came to his Revenge with all the speed  A hungry Wretch wou'd do to a great Feast  Where there are many Guests and he far off  Edw  Say my dear Brother are your Troops prepar'd  Geo  All all with a longing Appetite for War  War  No longer Earl of  March  but Duke of  York  The next Degree is  England  's Royal Throne  For King of  England  shalt thou be proclaim'd  And he that throws not up his Cap for Joy  Shall for the Fault make forfeit of his Head  Stay we no longer dreaming of Renown  But sound the Trumpets and about our Task  Enter Messenger  Mess  Princes prepare the Foe is near at Hand  The Amazon Queen drags  Henry  to the Battle  Who fain wou'd keep his Oath but she'll not suffer him  Edw  Why let 'em come we are prepar'd to face 'em  Rich  Then  Clifford  were thy Heart as hard as Steel  As thou hast shown it flinty by thy Deeds  I come to pierce it or to give thee mine  Edw  This Day decides who shall be King of  England  Strike up our Drums and let the Trumpets sound  Our brave Approach shall so much dare the Field  That  Henry  shall couch down in Fear and yield  Exit  A short March then an Alarm clashing of Swords and shouting Enter  Warwick  War  Ev'n spent with Toil as Runners with a Race  I lay me down a little while to breathe  For Strokes receiv'd and many Blows repay'd  Have robb'd my strong knit Sinews of their Strength  Enter  Edward  Edw  Smile gentle Heav'n or strike ungentle Death  For this World's Frowns and  Edward  's Sun is clouded  Enter  George  Geo  Our Ranks are broke and Ruin follows us  What Counsel give you Whither shall we fly  Edw  Bootless is Flight they follow us with Wings  And weak we are and cannot shun Pursuit  Enter  Richard  Rich  Ah  Warwick  Why hast thou withdrawn thy self  Thy Brother's Blood the thirsty Earth hath drunk  Broach'd with the steely Point of  Clifford  's Lance  And in the very Pangs of Death he cry'd  Like to a dismal  Clangor  heard from far  Warwick  revenge Brother revenge my Death  So underneath the Belly of his Steeds  That stain'd their Fetlocks in his smoaking Blood  The noble Gentleman gave up the Ghost  War  Then let the Earth be drunken with our Blood  I'll kill my Horse because I will not fly  Why stand we like softhearted Women here  Wailing our Losses while the Foe doth rage  And look upon as if the Tragedy  Were play'd in Jest by counterfeiting Actors  Here on my Knees I vow to Heav'n above  I'll never pause again never stand still  Till either Death doth close these Eyes of mine  Or till the Battle gives me full Revenge  Edw  O  Warwick  I do bend my Knee with thine  And in this Vow do chain my Soul to thine  And e'er my Knee rise from the Earth's cold Face  I lift my Hands my Eyes my Heart to thee  Thou Setter up and Plucker down of Kings  Beseeching thee if with thy Will it stands  That to my Foes this Body must be Prey  Yet that thy glorious Gates of Heav'n may ope  And give sweet Passage to my wand'ring Soul  Geo  Yet let us all together to our Troops  And give them leave to fly that dare not stay  And call them Pillars that will stand to us  Promising such Rewards if we should thrive  As Victors wore at the  Olympian  Games  This may plant Courage in their quailing Breasts  For yet is Hope of Life and Victory  Rich  Again then let our bloody Colours wave  And either Victory or else a Grave  Edw  Now Lords take leave until we meet again  Wheree'er it be in Heav'n or on Earth  Exeunt  Enter  Richard  and  Clifford  meeting  Rich  Now  Clifford  I have singled thee alone  Suppose this Arm is for the Duke of  York  And for young  Rutland  bound to revenge 'em both  Wert thou inviron'd with a brazen Wall  Cliff  And  Richard  here's the Hand that stabb'd old  York  The self same Hand that slew thy Brother  Rutland  And here's the Heart that triumphs in their Deaths  And cheers the Hand that slew thy Sire and Brother  To execute the like upon thy self  And so have at thee  Rich  Now guard well thy Heart  Fight off the Stage  Enter King  Henry  K Hen  The Battle fares like to the Morning's War  When dying Clouds contend with growing Light  Both Armies tug for Victory Breast to Breast  Yet neither's Conqueror nor conquered  Here on this Molehill will I set me down  An easier Seat than a high Throne of State  To whom Heav'n will there be the Victory  For  Margaret  my Queen and  Clifford  too  Have chid me from the Battle swearing both  They prosper best of all when I am thence  Wou'd I were dead if it were Heav'ns good Will  For what is in this World but Grief and Woe  Oh I am weary of this wretched State  Just now I met a Son bearing his Father  And an unhappy Father with his Son  Each by the other slain unwittingly  They being press'd into different Services  Oh monstrous Effect of Civil War  Oh piteous Spectacle Oh sad Confusions  What horrid Errors and unnatural Ills  Our horrid and unnatural War produces  Alas had they lack'd Tears I cou'd supply 'em  How will the Kingdom for these woful Chances  Misthink the King and not be satisfy'd  Oh wretched Men How are ye all deceiv'd  Who think there's no true Joy but in a Crown  By my Life  It is the very Height of Misery  Nature's common Benefits we want  Our Sleep unsound and short and all our Needs  To be supply'd with Fear since Treachery  Lurks in each Corner of a cursed Court  How often is a Monarch stung to Death  By the deadly Viper which his Bosom warm'd  How do we rack our Brain with Thoughts for others  Who nothing think for us Yet how are Men gull'd  With the deceitful Bait of Pomp and Shew  Meer gaudy Pagentry to varnish over  A wild distracted State  Now by my Royalty and pompous Woe  A Prison's preferable to a Court  There tho' confin'd I cou'd enjoy my Mind  At Liberty soar to the high Orbs of Heaven  And gain a Kingdom of immortal Joy  While others toiling for a Nation's Good  Shall lose themselves Alas  Did my Son know the Trouble of a Crown  He'd cease to wonder why I should resign it  And joyn in Prayers for Heaven to take it from me  Oh wretched Men who in these Wars have lost  Your dearest Friends and now are weeping for 'em  Here is a King more woful than you all  You grieve but for your selves I for you all  Oh you who when you suffer by your Kings  Think to mend all by War and by Rebellion  See here your sad Mistakes how dreadfully  You scourge your selves  And Oh you Kings who let your People rule  Till they have run themselves into Confusion  See here such Gentleness does wound like Tyranny  Enter Queen and Prince  Prince  But that my Heart's on future Battles set  I wou'd speak Blasphemy e'er bid you fly  But fly you must for all your Friends are fled  And  Warwick  rages like a chased Bull  Away for Death doth hold us in Pursuit  Queen  The Day is lost and with the Day the Kingdom  K Hen  Where's  Clifford  Prince  Oft within this Hour  I saw him down oft up again and fighting  From Helmet to the Spur all Blood he was  Queen  Stay not to talk  Clifford  I think is dead  I met him bleeding with an Hundred Wounds  And now in Cakes of Blood his Fire is quench'd  Mount you my Load towards  Berwick  post amain  Nay stay not to expostulate make speed  K Hen  I go but care not what becomes of me  Exit  Enter  Clifford  wounded  Cliff  Here burns my Candle out that lighted  Henry  My Love and Fear glew'd many Friends to thee  And now I fall thy tough Commixtures melt  Impairing good  Henry  strength'ning proud  York  And whither fly the Gnats but to the Sun  And who shines now but  Henry  's Enemies  O  Phoebus  hadst thou never giv'n Consent  That  Phaeton  shou'd check thy fiery Steeds  Thy burning Car never had scorch'd the Earth  And  Henry  hadst thou sway'd as Kings shou'd do  Or as thy Father and his Father did  Giving no Ground unto the House of  York  They never then had sprung like Summer flies  I and Ten Thousand in this luckless Realm  Had left no Mourning Widows for our Death  And thou this Day hadst kept thy Chair in Peace  For what doth cherish Weeds but gentle Air  And what makes Robbers bold but too much Lenity  Bootless are Plaints and cureless are my Wounds  No way to fly nor Strength to hold out Flight  The Foe is merciless and will not pity  For at their Hands I have deserv'd no Mercy  The Air hath got into my deadly Wounds  And much Effuse of Blood doth make me faint  Come  York  and  Richard Clarence  and the rest  I stabb'd your Father's Bosons split my Breast  Faints  Shout Enter  Edward Richard George Warwick  Soldiers  Edw  Now breathe we Lords good Fortune bids us pause  And smooth the Frowns of War with peaceful Looks  Are any Troops gone to pursue the Queen  On her Fame  Henry  's Fortune does depend  As the Seas Ebb and Flow does on the Moon  War  I have ta'en Care of that  Edw  Pray tell me Lords  Think you that  Clifford  fled with the King and Queen  War  No 'tis impossible he shou'd escape  For tho' before his Face I speak the Word  Your Brother  Richard  mark'd him for the Grave  And wheresoe'er he is he's surely dead  Cliff  Oh  dies  Edw  Whose Soul is that which takes her deadly Leave  See who it isAnd now the Battle's ended  If Friend or Foe let him be gently us'd  Rich  Revoke that Doom of Mercyfor 'tis  Clifford  Who not contented that he lopp'd the Branch  In hewing  Rutland  when his Leaves put forth  But set his murth'ring Knife unto the Root  From whence that tender Spray did sweetly spring  I mean our princely Father Duke of  York  Edw  Bring forth that fatal ScrechOwl to our House  That nothing sung but Death to us and ours  Now Death shall stop his dismal threat'ning Sound  And his illboding Tongue no more shall speak  War  I think his Understanding is bereft  Say  Clifford  Dost thou know who speaks to thee  Dark cloudy Death o'ershades his Beams of Life  And he nor sees nor hears us what we say  Since then he's dead off with the Traytor's Head  And rear it in the Place your Father's stands  And now to  London  with triumphant March  There to be crowned  England  's Royal King  From hence shall  Warwick  cut the Sea to  France  And ask the Lady  Bona  for thy Queen  So shalt thou sinew both these Lands together  And having  France  thy Friend thou shalt not dread  The scatter'd Foes that hope to rise again  For tho' they cannot greatly sting to hurt  Yet look to have 'em buz to offend your Ears  Edw  Oh thou hast made me much in Love with  Bona  And all Relations have increas'd my Passion  I cannot Marry betterhaste away  War  Then Royal Sir I humbly take my Leave  Edw

 She kneels and delivers a Petition The King gazes on her  L G  Sir I present you humbly the Petition  Of a poor Widow and her little Orphans  I am the Relict of one Sir  John Grey  Who in St  Alban  's Battle lost his Life  In the Defence of him we thought our King  If my poor Husband's Loyalty did err  He dearly for that fatal Error paid  My humble Prayer is that my poor Orphans  May not be punish'd for their Father's Faults  If erring Loyalty can be a Fault  Edw  I ne'er had Eyes or my Eyes ne'er saw Beauty  Till this amazing Minute  Rich  So he's lost  And any one may have  England  now that will  L G  May it please your Highness to resolve me now  And what your Pleasure is shall satisfy me  Rich  Ay Widow then I'll warrant you all your Lands  If that which pleases him shall pleasure you  Edw  I am so rapp'd I mind not what she says  Nor that she is all this while upon her Knees  Pray Madam riseleave us  Rich  Yea is it so  I see the Lady hath a Thing to grant  Before the King will grant her humble Suit  Edw  If I forget not you said you had a Husband  Who in St  Alban  's Battle lost his Life  L G  Yes Sir I had his Name was Sir  John Grey  Edw  What Excellence had he above Mankind  That he shou'd be more blest than all the rest  How many Children have you Lady Tell me  Geo  I think he means to beg a Child of her  Rich  Nay then hang me he'll rather give her two  L G  Three my most gracious Lord  Rich  You shall have Four if you'll be rul'd by him  Edw  Oh wondrous happy Man to enjoy this Woman  I must enquire about her I was never  Never so charm'd beforemy

Of what Family is she  Lord  Her Quality does far exceed her Husband's  And yet her Vertue does exceed her Quality  She is the Daughter of Sir  Richard Woodvil  Her Mother was sometime Dutchess of  Bedford  And Daughter of the Earl of St  Pool  Edw  Of noble Birth and by her Mother's Side  Related to the House of  Lancaster  Lord  She is by Marriage Sir that was the Cause  That Sir  John Grey  was such a fierce  Lancastrian  Edw  She has Beauty Vertue joyn'd with noble Birth  Why may not this fair Lady be a Queen  But she's a Subject  England  will not like it  And the  English  Nation like the Sea it governs  Is bold and turbulent and easily mov'd  And always beats against the Shore that bounds it  What are the People free and not the King  Not free where every Slave is free his Bed  Ay so it is it seems and th'  English  Fury  Will easily with any Wind be rais'd  To dash the Palaces and Peace of Kings  Come what will come this Lady shall be mine  She shall be or my Mistress or my

my self out of my Reason  L G  With your Permission Sir I take my Leave  Edw  Oh you shall never never part from me  L G  Alas what mean you Sir  Edw  I mean all the Love  E'er was or can be in the Heart of Man  L G  Oh Royal Sir I dare not understand you  Because I dare not think Ill of my Prince  Edw  Can there be ill in Love There will be all  The Happiness to me Glory to you  Your Heart and mine can possibly desire  Why do you tremble and draw back your Hand  You must not shall not stir till you have granted  What all this Languishing and Pressing mean  L G  Oh I shall swoon Wou'd I had ne'er come here  Sir I thus low most humbly beg of you  Let it suffice your conquering Arms have seiz'd  My Husband's Life your Laws have seiz'd his Lands  Seek not to take my Honour and my Vertue  I never fought against you ne'er oppos'd you  Edw  Her Looks do argue her repleat with Modesty  Her Words do show her Sense incomparable  All her Perfections challenge Sovereignty  I wrong her therefore she deserves a Crown  And each Look claims a Kingdom as its due  Madam I mean nothing but Honour to you  I am resolv'd to make you Queen of  England  L G  Now Sir you mean Dishonour to your self  I am as much unworthy to be Queen  As I'm above serving an ill Design  Edw  Rather the Crown's unworthy of your Beauty  L G  It is impossible you shou'd descend  To such mean Thoughts  Edw  It is impossible  I shou'd have Happiness without your Love  I had rather with your Love be your dead Husband  Than with your Hatred be a living King  Therefore consider well what you will do  Think on the Extravagance of my Passion  Think how very great or miserable  My Power can make you and remember too  You said you were fond of all your Children  And that to do them Good you cou'd bear Harm  And now behold a King who courts both you  And them to Wealth Pomp and Royal Greatness  L G  Heav'n instruct me what Answer I shall make  Who knows how far his Passion back'd with Power  May hurry him to ruin me and mine  If I should not consent unto his Will  I by denial ruin our whole House  When I by yielding bear the Storm alone  I rather will consent to sacrifice  My self than see my poor little Orphans  Reduc'd to Shame to Want and Beggary  That Thought strikes more Poniards into my Heart  Than my consenting unto  Edward  's Love  Oh that I only were concern'd in this  aside  I lately wish'd I never had come here  For my own sake I wish it now for yours  Oh think Sir what will all your Subjects say  Edw  They'll say I am in Love  L G  But will they not  Be much displeas'd their Prince shou'd love so low  Edw  I give them leave to chuse where they like best  And shall I be the only Man impos'd on  L G  But you have sent to Court a foreign Princess  May bring your Kingdom great Advantages  Consider how you may enrage Lord  Warwick  Edw  He is my Friend and Subject not my Master  L G  I fear the World will much condemn you Sir  Edw  I care not  I had rather live a Minute in your Arms  Than many Ages in the Praise of Fools  Enter Gentleman  Gent  Most happy Tidings Sir  Henry  your Enemy  Wandring alone disguis'd in homely Habit  Was taken by the Keepers of the Forest  As he was reading in a lonely Covert  Edw  Good News indeed where is he bring him to me  Enter King  Henry  in mean Habit  Why how now  Henry  in this humble Garb  Hen  Insult not  Edward  over my Misfortunes  But from this Garb in which thou scarce canst know me  Learn thou to know thy self and remember  Heav'n can humble ev'ry King like me  Edw  Henry  I pity thee thou dost not suffer  For thy own Crimes but those of thy usurping  And traiterous Ancestorsto  London  with him  And keep him a close Prisoner in the  Tower  See that he there command all Things but Liberty  How all my Happinesses flow together  My Head incircled with a glorious Crown  My greatest Enemy within my Power  Successful Conquest waiting on my Arms  And what's yet more possess'd of thy bright Charms  Exeunt  Manet Rich  And have I fought only to give you Joys  What must not I too have an equal Share  I have my Passions Sir as well as you  Whence do those Passions spring from childish Love  No from manly Greatness all other Fondness  I've banish'd from this rude tough Breast of mine  For I'm not made to please a wanton Eye  Then what will satisfy my Appetite  Nought but a Crown it hangs within my sight  And I will stretch this blasted Arm of mine  O'er all the Heads that are 'twixt me and that  But I will reach itmy Arm must then be long  For say that  Edward  's Title's buried  Still there remains  Clarence  and  Henry  And his Son  Edward  with their unlook'd for Issue  To take their Rooms e'er I can place my self  A cold Premeditation for my Purpose  Why then do I but dream on Sovereignty  Like one that stands upon a Promontory  And spies afar off Shore which he wou'd tread  Wishing his Foot were equal with his Eye  And chides the Sea that sunders him from thence  Saying he'll lave it dry to have his Way  So flatter I my self with Things impossible  How rarely wou'd the long Regal Robe  Hide my Deformity of Back and Legs  How wou'd a Sceptre grace this shrunk up Arm  And Oh what Beauty is there in a Crown  And till I gain it I do live in Torment  Shall I then stand like one lost in a Wood  And rather bear the pricking of the Thorns  Than stain my Sword by hewing out my Way  Why do I not set this Brain of mine to work  And frame my Countenance to all Occasions  I'll play the Orator as well as  Nestor  Deceive more slyly than  Ulysses  cou'd  And like a  Sinon  take another  Troy  I can add Colours to the  Camelion  And for Advantage can change Shapes with  Proteus  Have I endur'd all Hazards of the War  Only to see this lustful  Edward  reign  Have both my Hands for him been wash'd in  Blood  And shall they not dare do the same for me  Soft Time and Cunning and a daring Mind  Shall set this wish'd for Crown upon my Head  Some Men perhaps will say by Villany  That's Villany which by its ill Success  Betrays a Man and into Ruin throws  When once it gains a Crown it Vertue grows  The End of the Third ACT  ACT IV SCENE I  Enter  Warwick  with a Letter  _EDward  'tis well I do deserve this from thee  For being such an Ass to fight for one  Who melts each Hour away in Luxury  And gives his Kingdom for a Widow's Toy  Edward  my Wrongs are great

King again this valiant Lord  Has left the horrid Desarts of Rebellion  Where he and all his glorious Deeds were lost  And found the Road of Honour  War  I confess  Fortune did mislead me and I the Kingdom  To give your Royal Rights to a false Prince  Who has some Royal Blood no Royal Vertues  So has no Right to Crowns those Vertues gain'd  K Hen  I give you Thanks my Lord for your great Gifts  Life Freedom and a Crown I call 'em Gifts  Cause you can take 'em from me or let me keep 'em  To Life and Freedom I have a clear Title  Because I ne'er did ill to forfeit 'em  But oh I am afraid to

Sicknesses  Or rather die for a King's Crown and Life  Go fight togetherso King  Richard  found it  Prince  Sir all our Lives wholly depend on yours  And for one Fault of your dead Grandfather  Which he repented will you punish Thousands  That he full sore repented  Richard  's Death  His Deeds do show for in goodly Order  He follow'd the King's Body to the Grave  And on it he bestow'd more contrite Tears  Than from it issued forced Drops of Blood  Five Hundred Poor he yearly held in pay  Who twice a Day their wither'd Hands held up  Towards Heav'n to pardon the sad bloody Crime  And more did he not erect two Chauntries  Where still the sad and solemn Priests do sing  For  Richard  's Soul You'll sin to lose the Crown  More than our Grandfather did to gain it  Queen  If you will doom your self to be depos'd  Because the Crown was gotten by ill Means  By the same Law you may destroy half your Kingdom  If Men by inheriting their Fathers Fortunes  Inherit the Crimes by which their Fathers gain'd 'em  Where is the Nation would not deserve Death  K Hen  Full well hath  Marg'ret  play'd the Orator  Inferring Arguments of mighty Force  But pray now tell me did you never hear

Honour  Who cannot be contented with one Wife  Nor know you how to use your Brother  Clarence  Nor how to study for the People's Welfare  Nor how to shrowd your self from Enemies  Nor how to set true Value on a Friend  Edw  Nay then I see that  Edward  needs must down  Yet  Warwick  in despight of all Mischance  Edward  will always bear himself as King  Though Fortune's Malice overthrow my State

Exeunt  Geo  So please you Sir I'll follow presently  Now I'm secure of  Warwick  's beauteous Daughter  Why let the Devil take him with his Treason  Perhaps he will object my sacred Oath  To keep

 Promise no less than glorious Victory  Their Arms all shining bright appear a Sun  Their piercing Eyes that sparkle thro' their Helmets  With a quick Motion spread a Fire around 'em  And show like Stars twinkling i'th' Firmament  The Plumes and Colours waving o'er their Heads  Do fan the Fire that has possess'd their Hearts  Each prancing Horse neighs Courage to his Rider  And with their horned Hoofs they paw the Ground  As they'd dig Graves for all our Enemies  I am transported with the gallant Sight  And my Breast burns I so much long for War  War  Then your Desires shall be satisfy'd  For

take  And then I follow  Exeunt Manent Prince and  Anne  Oh my beauteous  Anne  The Battle bids me leave thee for a while  But flush'd with Conquest soon I will return  And lay my dear bought Laurels at thy Feet  By Heav'n I think I cou'd perswade my Father  To resign his Crown for ever to proud  York  So I might rest within thy lovely Fold  Secure of Peace and undisturb'd by War  But that the Thoughts of making thee a Queen  Awakes my Soul and summons it to Arms  Yet if I fall which gracious Heav'n forbid  For now methinks I am ev'n fond of Life  Having tasted of the Bliss of thy sweet Love  Tho' I before thought of it as a Trifle  The Loss of Life seems but of little Moment  When I reflect upon the Loss of thee  And when the horrid Thought comes in my Mind  I leave behind my Soul's dearest Treasure  For other happy Men perhaps to enjoy  Then Sweet I beg of thee this once to swear  Thou never wilt have thought of other Man  L A  Why my dear Lord do you then doubt my Truth  Prince  Oh no by Heavenbut I wou'd have my Ear  Blest with the Musick of thy melting Voice  In Words of Comfort e'er I do depart  That if the Almighty Power's gracious Will  Is so determin'd I must fall in Battle  I may have Hopes our spotless Souls through Love  And Constancy may meet in Heav'n hereafter  And spite of War we may again be Happy  L A  Then hear me gracious Heav'n and assist me  To keep the Vow I solemnly do make  If it seems sitting in the Eye of Heav'n  My precious  Edward  in this War should fall  May Heav'n forsake me at my latest Hour  If I e'er taste of Joy or Comfort more  And if my Heart shou'd e'er swerve from Truth  May all the bitter Pangs of a rack'd Conscience  Pursue me here and in the World to come  And oh ye mighty Guardians of the Just  Protect his Youth i' th' deadly brunt of War  And send my Yew home adorn'd in Triumph  Edward  my Love be careful of thy Life  For if thou dy'st thy loving  Anne  falls with thee  Prince  This is too much for Mortal to support  How shall I bear this vast Excess of Bliss  Surely I cannot have long time to live  My Joys flow in so fast this present Hour  But let Fate do its worst this pays for all  Oh my Heart's Joy if  Edward  e'er prove false  May Heav'n inflict its deadliest Vengeance on me  Hark my Love  Trumpets sound  The cheerful Trumpet calls me to the Field  My Heart e'en dances to its spritely Notes  This one Embrace and then farewel my  Anne  Adieu thou dearest thou excelling Creature  Now I am certain Fate it self can't part us  Let Death stand in its worst Form array'd  I will not entertain a Thought of Fear  But warm'd by thee my Life bravely I'll on  To assert my lawful Title to the Crown  By this Day's Feats in Battle I will prove  What Youth dare do for Empire and for Love  Exit  Enter Lady  Elizabeth  L E  Oh  Anne  now show thy self a loving Sister  And send  Elizabeth  Supply of Tears  For mine will ne'er suffice for my great Sorrow  L A  Alas from whence proceeds this sudden Grief  L E  Is not our Father  Warwick  gone to fight  Against King  Edward  and my Husband  Clarence  And can'st thou ask the Occasion of these Tears  Let who will conquer still thy Sister mourns  Or for her murder'd Father or her Husband  L A  Why let his Treason wipe away his Love  L E  Oh he's too deeply rooted in my Heart  Be witness Heav'n I had never lov'd him  Had not my noble Father first commanded  I plainly saw when he did leave King  Edward  It was his Love for me did prompt him on  Why have I not the Power to keep him here  Oh now he has got Possession of my Person  He like a Tyrant gives his Will free way  My Father does command that I shou'd hate him  I out of Duty to my worthy Father  Wou'd hate him much but that my Heart pleads hard  And will not turn him forth from out my Bosom  L A  Why then indulge thy Sorrows dear  Eliza  For I will be thy very faithful Friend  And send forth Sigh for Sigh and Tear for Tear  Thy State indeed deserves extremest Pity  Since thy great Sorrow is past hope of Cure  Unless the Saints in pity to thy Woes  Shou'd send some Miracle to end thy Grief  L E  The only Way to prove thy self my Friend  Is to contrive how to increase my Sorrow  For when I find that 'tis in Human Nature  To suffer more it may avail a little  To stop the Torrent of my flowing Tears  But I am sure that is impossible  Whene'er I strive to press a rising Sigh  My Heart e'en bursts to give it a free Passage  L A  Let them have Scope tho' what they do import  Help nothing else yet do they ease the Heart  Exit  Enter Queen Prince  Warwick  and Soldiers  Queen  Thus far with Speed and easy March we are come  Now let us doff our silken Robes of Peace  And arm our Minds and Bodies for fell War  Stiffen the Sinews summon up the Blood  Disguise fair Nature with hard favour'd Rage  And lend the Eye a terrible Aspect  Now set the Teeth and stretch the Nostril wide  Hold hard the Breath and rouze up e'ery Spirit  To its full Height On on you noblest  English  Whose Blood is fetch'd from Fathers of War Proof  Fathers that like so many  Alexanders  Have in these Parts from Morn till Evening fought  And sheath'd their Swords for lack of Argument

England  shew us now  The Mettle of your Pasture Let us swear  That you are worth your Breeding which I doubt not  For there is none of you so Mean and Base  That hath not noble Lustre in your Eyes  I

poor Words can  Prince  Methinks a Woman of this valiant Spirit  Shou'd if a Coward heard her speak these Words  Infuse his Breast with Magnanimity  And make him naked foil a Man at Arms  I speak not this as Doubting any here  For did I but suspect a fearful Man  He shou'd have leave to go away betimes  Lest in our Need he might infect another  And make him of base Spirit like himself  If any such be here which Heav'n forbid  Let him depart before we need his Help  War  Women and Children of so high a Courage  And Warriors faint why 'twere perpetual Shame  Oh brave young Princethy famous Grandfather  Doth live again in thee Long may'st thou live  To bear his Image and renew his Glories  And he that will not fight for such a Hope  Go home to Bed and like the Owl by Day  If he arise be

And I'll direct thee how thou may'st escape  For I have snatch'd thee from the Jaws of Death  Prince  The Swords of Rebels have not made me smart  These Words of yours draw Lifeblood from my Heart  Before young  Edward  of great  Henry  's Race  Who conquer'd  France  and made her Chiefs to tremble  Relinquish  Warwick  in the Heat of War  I'll slay each Horse I have within the Field  Then worthy Chief lose not a Thought on me  But to thy Swordhack'd Soldiers strait return  And with thy wond'rous Deeds too great for Words  Animate thy Troops I pray you haste away  Thy Presence only

our Soldiers Helms  Are shiver'd all and all besmear'd with Blood  Their Arms and Armour hack'd with lusty Blows  And the whole Fight displays a general Terror  The Sight is dreadful but 'tis glorious too  Shall I now basely shrink No Heaven forbid  Love draws my Sword Revenge shall steel its Point  A Crown and Royalty shall man my Breast  I'm resolute to die or to return  A Conqueror worthy of my  Anna  's Bed  And when succeeding Ages read my Deeds  They shall not say they sham'd our  British  Annals  Ha  Richard  here Nay then rouse up my Soul  Enter  Richard  opposite to the Prince  Rich

Boy into Submission  Prince  These Words provoke meno  Richard  tho' I'm a Youth  The Blood of  English  Kings runs in these Veins  And I am a Stranger to all Sorts of Fear  E'er I will yield I'll

Heart  That I must yield my Body to the Earth  And by my Fall the Conquest to my Foe  Thus yields the Cedar to the Axe's Edge  Whose Arms gave Shelter to the princely Eagle  Under whose Shade the ramping Lion slept  Whose top Branch overpeer'd  Jove  's spreading Tree  And kept low Shrubs from Winter's powerful Wind  These Eyes that now are dim'd with Death's black Veil  Have been as piercing as the Midday Sun  To search the secret Treasons of the World  The Wrinkles of my Brows now fill'd with Blood  Were lik'ned oft to kingly Sepulchres  For who liv'd King but I could dig his Grave  And who durst smile when  Warwick  bent his Brow  Lo now my Glory smear'd in Dust and Blood  My Parks my Walks my Mannors that I had  E'en now forsake me and of all my Lands  Is nothing left me but my Body's length  Why what is Pomp Rule Reign but Earth and Dast  And live we how we can yet die we must  Dies  Enter  Edward George Richard  and Soldiers  Edw  Thus far our Fortune keeps an upward

 You have no Children Butchers if you had  The Thought of them wou'd have stir'd up Remorse  But if you ever chance to have a Child  Look in his Youth to have him so cut off  As Death's Men you have
