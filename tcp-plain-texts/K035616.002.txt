 ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM  VOLUME II  EDINBURGH Printed for A MILLAR London AND A KINCAID J BELL Edinburgh MDCCLXII  ELEMENTS OF CRITICISM  CHAP X Congruity and Propriety  MAN is distinguished from the brute creation not more remarkably by the superiority of his rational faculties than by the greater delicacy of his perceptions and feelings With respect to the gross pleasures of sense man probably has little superiority over other animals Some obscure perception of beauty may also fall to their share But they are probably not acquainted with the more delicate conceptions of regularity order uniformity or congruity  Such refined conceptions being connected with morality and religion are reserved to dignify the chief of the terrestrial creation Upon this account no discipline is more suitable to man or more  congruous  to the dignity of his nature than that by which his taste is refined to distinguish in every subject what is regular what is orderly what is suitable and what is fit and proper  Nec vero illa parva vis naturae est rationisque quod unum hoc animal sentit quid sit ordo quid sit quod deceat in factis dictisque qui modus Itaque eorum ipsorum quae aspectu sentiuntur nullum aliud animal pulchritudinem venustatem convenientiam partium sentit Quam similitudinem natura ratioque ab oculis ad animum transferens multo etiam magis pulchritudinem constantiam ordinem in consiliis factisque conservandum putat cavetque ne quid indecorè effeminatève faciat tum in omnibus et opinionibus et factis ne quid libidinosè aut faciat aut cogitet Quibus ex rebus conflatur et efficitur id quod quaerimus honestum  Ciccro de officiis l    No discerning person can be at a loss about the meaning of the terms  congruity  and  propriety  when applied to dress behaviour or language that a decent grab for example is proper for a judge modest behaviour for a young woman and a lofty  style for an epic poem In the following examples every one is sensible of an unsuitableness or incongruity a little woman sunk in an overgrown farthingale a coat richly embroidered covering coarse and dirty linen a mean subject in an elevated style or an elevated subject in a mean style a first minister darning his wife's stocking or a reverend prelate in lawn sleeves dancing a hornpipe  But it is not sufficient that these terms be understood in practice the critical art requires that their meaning be traced to its foundation in human nature The relations that connect objects together have been examined in more than one view Their influence in directing the train of our perceptions is handled in the first chapter and in the second their influence in generating passion Here they must be handled in a new view for they are clearly the occasion of congruity and propriety We are so framed by nature as to require a certain suitableness or correspondence among things connected by any relation This suitableness or correspondence is termed  congruity  or  propriety  and the want of it  incongruity  or  impropriety  Among the many principles that compose the nature of man a sense of congruity or propriety is one Destitute of this sense we could have no notion of congruity or propriety the terms to us would be unintelligible  From many things that pass current in the world without being generally condemned one at first view would imagine that the sense of congruity or propriety hath searce any foundation in nature and that it is rather an artificial refinement of those who affect to distinguish themselves by a certain delicacy of taste and behaviour The fulsome panegyrics bestowed upon the great and opulent in epistles dedicatory and other such compositions lead naturally to that thought Did there prevail in the world it will be said or did nature suggest a taste of what is suitable decent or proper would any good writer deal in such compositions or any man of sense receive them without disgust Can it be supposed that Lewis XIV of France was endued by nature with any sense of propriety when in a dramatic performance purposely composed for his entertainment he suffered himself publicly and in his presence to be styled the greatest king ever the earth produced These it is true are strong facts but luckily they do not prove the sense of propriety to be artificial They only prove that the sense of propriety is at times overpowered by pride and vanity which is no singular case for this sometimes is the fate even of the sense of justice    As this sense is displayed upon relations it is reasonable beforehand to expect that  we should be so formed as to require among connected objects a degree of congruity proportioned to the degree of the relation And upon examination we find this to hold in fact Where the relation is strong and intimate as betwixt a cause and its effect a body and its members we require that the things be suited to each other in the strictest manner On the other hand where the relation is slight or accidental as among things jumbled together in the same place we demand little or no congruity The strictest propriety is required in behaviour and manner of living because a man is connected with these by the relation of cause and effect The situation of a great house ought to be lofty for the relation betwixt an edifice and the ground it stands upon is of the most intimate kind Its relation to neighbouring hills rivers plains being that of propinquity only demands but a small share of congruity Among members of the same club the congruity ought to be considerable as well as among things placed for show in the same niche Among passengers in a stagecoach we require very  little congruity and less still at a public spectacle  Congruity is so nearly allied to beauty as commonly to be held a species of it And yet they differ so essentially as never to coincide Beauty like colour is placed upon a single subject congruity upon a plurality Further a thing beautiful in itself may with relation to other things produce the strongest sense of incongruity  Congruity and propriety are commonly reckoned synonymous terms and hitherto in opening the subject they are used indifferently But they are distinguishable and the precise meaning of each must be ascertained Congruity is the genus of which propriety is a species For we call nothing propriety but that congruity or suitableness which ought to subsist betwixt sensible beings and their thoughts words and actions  In order to give a full view of this subject I shall trace it through some of the most considerable relations The relation of a part to the whole being extremely intimate demands the utmost degree of congruity For that reason the slightest deviation  is disgustful Every one must be sensible of a gross incongruity in the  Lutrin  a burlesque poem being closed with a serious and warm panegyric on Lamoignon one of the King's judges  Amphora coepit  Institui currente rota cur urceus exit  No relation affords more examples of congruity and incongruity than that betwixt a subject and its ornaments A literary performance intended merely for amusement is susceptible of much ornament as well as a musicroom or a playhouse In gaiety the mind hath a peculiar relish for show and decoration The most gorgeous apparel however unsuitable to an actor in a regular tragedy disgusts not at an opera The truth is an opera in its present form is a mighty fine thing but as it deviates from nature in its capital circumstances we look not for any thing natural in those which are accessory On the other hand a serious and important subject admits not much ornament  Contrary to this rule the introduction to the third volume of the  Characteristics  is a continued chain of metaphors These in such profusion are too florid for the subject and have beside the bad effect of removing our attention from the principal subject to fix it upon splendid trifles    nor a subject that of itself is extremely beautiful And a subject that fills the mind with its loftiness and grandeur appears best in a dress altogether plain  To a person of a mean appearance gorgeous apparel is unsuitable which beside the incongruity has a bad effect for by contrast it shows the meanness of appearance in the strongest light Sweetness of look and manner requires simplicity of dress joined with the greatest elegance A stately and majestic air requires sumptuous apparel which ought not to be gaudy or crowded with little ornaments A woman of consummate beauty can bear to be highly adorned and yet shows best in a plain dress  For loveliness  Needs not the foreign aid of ornament  But is when unadorn'd adorn'd the most  Thomson's Autumn  In judging of the propriety of ornament we must attend not only to the nature of the subject that is to be adorned but also to the circumstances in which it is placed The ornaments that are proper for a ball will appear not altogether so decent at public worship and the same person ought to dress differently for a marriagefeast and for a burial  Nothing is more intimately related to a man than his sentiments words and actions and therefore we require here the strictest conformity When we find what we thus require we have a lively sense of propriety when we find the contrary our sense of impropriety is not less lively Hence the universal distaste of affectation which consists in making a shew of greater delicacy and refinement than is suited either to the character or circumstances of the person Nothing hath a worse effect in a story than impropriety of manners In Corneille's tragedy of  Cinna  Aemilia a favourite of Augustus receives daily marks of his affection and is loaded with benefits yet all the while is laying plots to assassinate her benefactor  directed by no other motive but to avenge her father's death  See act sc  Revenge against a benefactor founded solely upon filial piety will never suggest unlawful means because it can never exceed the bounds of justice And yet the crime here attempted murder under trust reposed is what even a miscreant will scarce attempt against his bitterest enemy  What is said may be thought sufficient to explain the qualities of congruity and propriety But the subject is not exhausted On the contrary the prospect enlarges upon us when we take under view the effects these qualities produce in the mind Congruity and propriety whereever perceived appear agreeable and every agreeable object produceth in the mind a pleasant emotion Incongruity and impropriety on the other hand are disagreeable and consequently produce painful emotions An emotion of this kind sometimes vanisheth without any consequence but more frequently is the occasion of other emotions  When any slight incongruity is perceived in an accidental combination of persons or things as of passengers in a stagecoach or of individuals dining at an ordinary the emotion of incongruity after a momentary existence vanisheth without producing any effect But this is not the case of propriety and impropriety Voluntary acts whether words or deeds are imputed to the author when proper we reward him with our esteem when improper we punish him with our contempt Let us suppose for example an heroic action suitable to the character of the author which raises in him and in every spectator the pleasant emotion of propriety This emotion generates in the author both selfesteem and joy the former when he considers his relation to the action and the latter when he considers the good opinion that others will entertain of him The same emotion of propriety produceth in the spectators esteem for the author of the action and when they think of themselves it also produceth by means of contrast an emotion of humility To discover the effects of an unsuitable action  we must invert each of these circumstances The painful emotion of impropriety generates in the author of the action both humility and shame the former when he considers his relation to the action and the latter when he considers what others will think of him The same emotion of impropriety produceth in the spectators contempt for the author of the action and it also produceth by means of contrast when they think of themselves an emotion of selfesteem Here then are many different emotions derived from the same action considered in different views by different persons a machine provided with many springs and not a little complicated Propriety of action it would seem is a chief favourite of nature or of the author of nature when such care and solicitude is bestowed upon it It is not left to our own choice but like justice is required at our hands and like justice inforced by natural rewards and punishments A man cannot with impunity do any thing unbecoming or improper He suffers the chastisement of contempt inflicted by others and of shame inflicted by himself An apparatus  so complicated and so singular ought to rouse our attention Nature doth nothing in vain and we may conclude with great certainty that this curious branch of the human constitution is intended for some valuable purpose To the discovery of this purpose I shall with ardor apply my thoughts after discoursing a little more at large upon the punishment for I may now call it so that Nature hath provided for indecent or unbecoming behaviour This at any rate is necessary in order to give a full view of the subject and who knows whether it may not over and above open some track that will lead us to what we are in quest of  A gross impropriety is punished with contempt and indignation which are vented against the offender by every external expression that can gratify these passions And even the slightest impropriety raises some degree of contempt But there are improprieties generally of the slighter kind that provoke laughter of which we have examples without end in the blunders and absurdities of our own species Such  improprieties receive a different punishment as will appear by what follows The emotions of contempt and of laughter occasioned by an impropriety of this kind uniting intimately in the mind of the spectator are expressed externally by a peculiar sort of laugh termed  a laugh of derision  or  scorn  See chap  An impropriety that thus moves not only contempt but laughter is distinguished by the epithet of  ridiculous  and a laugh of derision or scorn is the punishment provided for it by nature Nor ought it to escape observation that we are so fond of inflicting this punishment as sometimes to exert it even against creatures of an inferior species witness a Turkycock swelling with pride and strutting with displayed feathers This object appears ridiculous and in a gay mood is apt to provoke a laugh of derision  We must not expect that the improprieties to which these different punishments are adapted can be separated by any precise boundaries Of improprieties from the  slightest to the most gross from the most risible to the most serious a scale may be formed ascending by degrees almost imperceptible Hence it is that in viewing some unbecoming actions too risible for anger and too serious for derision the spectator feels a sort of mixt emotion partaking both of derision and of anger This accounts for an expression common with respect to the impropriety of some actions That we know not whether to laugh or be angry  It cannot fail to be observed that in the case of a risible impropriety which is always slight the contempt we have for the offender is extremely faint though derision its gratification is extremely pleasant This disproportion betwixt a passion and its gratification seems not conformable to the analogy of nature In looking about for a solution I reflect upon what is laid down above that an improper action not only moves our contempt for the author but also by means of contrast swells the good opinion we have of ourselves This contributes more than any other article to the pleasure we feel in ridiculing the follies and  absurdities of others And accordingly it is well known that they who put the greatest value upon themselves are the most prone to laugh at others Pride is a vivid passion as all are which have self for their object It is extremely pleasant in itself and not less so in its gratification This passion singly would be sufficient to account for the pleasure of ridicule without borrowing any aid from contempt Hence appears the reason of a noted observation That we are the most disposed to ridicule the blunders and absurdities of others when we are in high spirits for in high spirits selfconceit displays itself with more than ordinary vigor  Having with wary steps traced an intricate road not without danger of wandering what remains to complete our journey is to account for the final cause of congruity and propriety which make so great a figure in the human constitution One final cause regarding congruity is pretty obvious The sense of congruity as one of the principles of the fine arts contributes in a remarkable degree to our entertainment  This is the final cause assigned above for our sense of proportion  See chap  and need not be enlarged upon here Congruity indeed with respect to quantity coincides with proportion When the parts of a building are nicely adjusted to each other it may be said indifferently that it is agreeable by the congruity of its parts or by the proportion of its parts But propriety which regards voluntary agents only can never in any instance be the same with proportion A very long nose is disproportioned but cannot be termed  improper  In some instances it is true impropriety coincides with disproportion in the same subject but never in the same respect I give for an example a very little man buckled to a long toledo Considering the man and the sword with respect to size we perceive a disproportion Considering the sword as the choice of the man we perceive an impropriety  The sense of impropriety with respect to mistakes blunders and absurdities is happily contrived for the good of mankind  In the spectators it is productive of mirth and laughter excellent recreation in an interval from business The benefit is still more extensive It is not agreeable to be the subject of ridicule and to punish with ridicule the man who is guilty of an absurdity tends to put him more upon his guard in time coming Thus even the most innocent blunder is not committed with impunity because were errors licensed where they do no hurt inattention would grow into a habit and be the occasion of much hurt  The final cause of propriety as to moral duties is of all the most illustrious To have a just notion of it the two sorts of moral duties must be kept in view  viz  those that respect others and those that respect ourselves Fidelity gratitude and the forbearing injury are examples of the first sort temperance modesty firmness of mind are examples of the other The former are made duties by means of the moral sense the latter by means of the sense of propriety Here is a final cause of the sense of propriety that must rouse our attention  It is undoubtedly the interest of every man to regulate his behaviour suitably to the dignity of his nature and to the station allotted him by Providence Such rational conduct contributes in every respect to happiness it contributes to health and plenty it gains the esteem of others and which is of all the greatest blessing it gains a justlyfounded selfesteem But in a matter so essential to our wellbeing even selfinterest is not relied on The sense of propriety superadds the powerful authority of duty to the motive of interest The God of nature in all things essential to our happiness hath observed one uniform method To keep us steady in our conduct he hath fortified us with natural principles and feelings These prevent many aberrations which would daily happen were we totally surrendered to so fallible a guide as is human reason The sense of propriety cannot justly be considered in another light than as the natural law that regulates our conduct with respect to ourselves as the sense of justice is the natural law that regulates our conduct with respect to others I call the sense of  propriety a law because it really is so not less than the sense of justice If by law be meant a rule of conduct that we are conscious ought to be obeyed this definition which I conceive to be strictly accurate is applicable undoubtedly to both The sense of propriety includes this consciousness for to say an action is proper is in other words to say that it  ought  to be performed and to say it is improper is in other words to say that it  ought  to be forborn It is this very consciousness of  ought  and  should  included in the moral sense that makes justice a law to us This consciousness of duty when applied to propriety is perhaps not so vigorous or strong as when applied to justice but the difference is in degree only not in kind and we ought without hesitation or reluctance to submit equally to the government of both  But I have more to urge upon this head It must in the next place be observed that to the sense of propriety as well as of justice are annexed the sanctions of rewards and punishments which evidently prove the one to be a law as well as the other The  satisfaction a man hath in doing his duty joined with the esteem and goodwill of others is the reward that belongs to both equally The punishments also though not the same are nearly allied and differ in degree more than in quality Disobedience to the law of justice is punished with remorse disobedience to the law of propriety with shame which is remorse in a lower degree Every transgression of the law of justice raises indignation in the beholder and so doth every flagrant transgression of the law of propriety Slighter improprieties receive a milder punishment they are always rebuked with some degree of contempt and frequently with derision In general it is true that the rewards and punishments annexed to the sense of propriety are slighter in degree than those annexed to the sense of justice And that this is wisely ordered will appear from considering that to the wellbeing of society duty to others is still more essential than duty to ourselves for society could not subsist a moment were individuals not protected from the headstrong and turbulent passions of their neighbours  Reflecting coolly and carefully upon the subject under consideration the constitution of man admirable in all its parts appears here in a fine light The final cause now unfolded of the sense of propriety must to every discerning eye appear delightful and yet hitherto we have given but a partial view of it The sense of propriety reaches another illustrious end which is to cooperate with the sense of justice in inforcing the performance of social duties In fact the sanctions visibly contrived to compel a man to be just to himself are equally serviceable to compel him to be just to others This will be evident from a single reflection That an action by being unjust ceases not to be improper An action never appears more eminently improper than when it is unjust It is obviously becoming and suitable to human nature that each man do his duty to others and accordingly every transgression of duty with respect to others is at the same time a transgression of duty with respect to self This is an undisguised truth without exaggeration and it opens a new and delightful view in the moral landscape  The prospect is greatly enriched by the multiplication of agreeable objects It appears now that nothing is overlooked nothing left undone that can possibly contribute to the enforcing social duty For to all the sanctions that belong to it singly are superadded the sanctions of selfduty A familiar example shall suffice for illustration An act of ingratitude considered in itself is to the author disagreeable as well as to every spectator considered by the author with relation to himself it raises selfcontempt considered by him with relation to the world it makes him ashamed Again considered by others it raises their contempt and indignation against the author These feelings are all of them occasioned by the impropriety of the action When the action is considered as unjust it occasions another set of feelings In the author it produces remorse and a dread of merited punishment and in others the benefactor chiefly indignation and hatred directed upon the ungrateful person Thus shame and remorse united in the ungrateful  person and indignation united with hatred in the hearts of others are the punishments provided by nature for injustice Stupid and insensible must he be in extreme who in a contrivance so exquisite perceives not the hand of the Sovereign Architect  CHAP XI Of Dignity and Meanness  THESE terms are applied to man in point of character sentiment and behaviour We say for example of one man that he hath a natural dignity in his air and manner of another that he makes a mean figure There is a dignity in every action and sentiment of some persons the actions and sentiments of others are mean and vulgar With respect to the fine arts some performances are said to be manly and suitable to the dignity of human nature others are termed low mean trivial Such expressions are common though they have not always a precise meaning With respect to the art of criticism it must be a real acquisition to ascertain what these terms truly import which possibly may enable us to rank every performance in the fine arts according to its dignity  Inquiring first to what subjects the terms  dignity  and  meanness  are appropriated we soon discover that they are not applicable to any thing inanimate The most magnificent palace ever built may be lofty may be grand but it has no relation to dignity The most diminutive shrub may be little but it is not mean These terms must belong to sensitive beings probably to man only which will be evident when we advance in the inquiry  Of all objects human actions produce in a spectator the greatest variety of feelings They are in themselves grand or little with respect to the author they are proper or improper with respect to those affected by them just or unjust And I must now add that they are also distinguished by dignity and meanness It may possibly be thought that with respect to human actions dignity coincides with grandeur and meanness with littleness But the difference will be evident upon reflecting that we never attribute dignity to any action but what is virtuous nor meanness to any but what in some degree is faulty But an action  may be grand without being virtuous or little without being faulty Every action of dignity creates respect and esteem for the author and a mean action draws upon him contempt A man is always admired for a grand action but frequently is neither loved nor esteemed for it neither is a man always contemned for a low or little action  As it appears to me dignity and meanness are founded on a natural principle not hitherto mentioned Man is endued with a sense of the worth and excellence of his nature He deems it to be more perfect than that of the other beings around him and he feels that the perfection of his nature consists in virtue particularly in virtue of the highest rank To express this sense the term  dignity  is appropriated Further to behave with dignity and to refrain from all mean actions is felt to be not a virtue only but a duty it is a duty every man owes to himself By acting in this manner he attracts love and esteem By acting meanly or below himself he is disapproved and contemned  According to the description here given of dignity and meanness they will be found to be a species of propriety and impropriety Many actions may be proper or improper to which dignity or meanness cannot be applied To eat when one is hungry is proper but there is no dignity in this action Revenge fairly taken if against law is improper but it is not mean But every action of dignity is also proper and every mean action is also improper  This sense of the dignity of human nature reaches even our pleasures and amusements If they enlarge the mind by raising grand or elevated emotions or if they humanize the mind by exercising our sympathy they are approved as suited to our nature if they contract the mind by fixing it on trivial objects they are contemned as low and mean Hence in general every occupation whether of use or amusement that corresponds to the dignity of man obtains the epithet of  manly  and every occupation below his nature obtains the epithet of  childish  To those who study human nature there  is a point which has always appeared intricate How comes it that generosity and courage are more valued and bestow more dignity than goodnature or even justice though the latter contribute more than the former to private as well as to public happiness This question bluntly proposed might puzzle a cunning philosopher but by means of the foregoing observations will easily be solved Human virtues like other objects obtain a rank in our estimation not from their utility which is a subject of reflection but from the direct impression they make on us Justice and goodnature are a sort of negative virtues that make no figure unless when they are transgressed Courage and generosity producing elevated emotions enliven greatly the sense of a man's dignity both in himself and in others and for that reason courage and generosity are in higher regard than the other virtues mentioned We describe them as grand and elevated as of greater dignity and more praiseworthy  This leads us to examine more directly emotions and passions with respect to the  present subject And it will not be difficult to form a scale of them beginning at the meanest and ascending gradually to those of the highest rank and dignity Pleasure felt as at the organ of sense named  corporeal pleasure  is perceived to be low and when indulged to excess beyond what nature demands is perceived also to be mean Persons therefore of any delicacy dissemble the pleasure they have in eating and drinking The pleasures of the eye and ear which have no organic feeling  See the Introduction  are free from any sense of meanness and for that reason are indulged without any shame They even arise to a certain degree of dignity when their objects are grand or elevated The same is the case of the sympathetic passions They raise the character considerably when their objects are of importance A virtuous person behaving with fortitude and dignity under the most cruel misfortunes makes a capital figure and the sympathising spectator feels in himself the same dignity Sympathetic distress at  the same time never is mean on the contrary it is agreeable to the nature of a social being and has the general approbation The rank that love possesses in this scale depends in a great measure on its object It possesses a low place when founded on external properties merely and is mean when bestowed upon a person of a rank much inferior without any extraordinary qualification But when founded on the more elevated internal properties it assumes a considerable degree of dignity The same is the case of friendship When gratitude is warm it animates the mind but it scarce rises to dignity Joy bestows dignity when it proceeds from an elevated cause  So far as I can gather from induction dignity is not a property of any disagreeable passion One is slight another severe one depresses the mind another rouses and animates it but there is no elevation far less dignity in any of them Revenge in particular though it inflame and swell the mind is not accompanied with dignity not even with elevation It is not however felt  as mean or groveling unless when it takes indirect measures for its gratification Shame and remorse though they sink the spirits are not mean Pride a disagreeable passion bestows no dignity in the eye of a spectator Vanity always appears mean and extremely so where founded as commonly happens on trivial qualifications  I proceed to the pleasures of the understanding which possess a high rank in point of dignity Of this every one will be sensible when he considers the important truths that have been laid open by science such as general theorems and the general laws that govern the material and moral worlds The pleasures of the understanding are suited to man as a rational and contemplative being and they tend not a little to ennoble his nature Even to the Deity he stretches his contemplations which in the discovery of infinite power wisdom and benevolence afford delight of the most exalted kind Hence it appears that the fine arts studied as a rational science afford entertainment of great dignity superior far to what they afford as a subject of taste merely  But contemplation though in itself valuable is chiefly respected as subservient to action for man is intended to be more an active than a contemplative being He accordingly shows more dignity in action than in contemplation Generosity magnanimity heroism raise his character to the highest pitch These best express the dignity of his nature and advance him nearer to divinity than any other of his attributes  By every production that shows art and contrivance our curiosity is excited upon two points first how it was made and next to what end Of the two the latter is the more important inquiry because the means are ever subordinate to the end and in fact our curiosity is always more inflamed by the final than by the efficient cause This preference is no where more visible than in contemplating the works of nature If in the efficient cause wisdom and power be displayed wisdom is not less conspicuous in the final cause and from it only can we infer benevolence which of all the divine attributes is to man the most  important Having endeavoured to assign the efficient cause of dignity and meanness and to unfold the principle on which they are founded we proceed to explain the final cause of the dignity or meanness bestowed upon the several particulars above mentioned beginning with corporeal pleasures These so far as useful are like justice fenced with sufficient sanctions to prevent their being neglected Hunger and thirst are painful sensations and we are incited to animal love by a vigorous propensity Were they dignified over and above with a place in a high class they would infallibly overturn the balance of the mind by outweighing the social affections This is a satisfactory final cause for refusing to corporeal pleasures any degree of dignity And the final cause is not less evident of their meanness when they are indulged to excess The more refined pleasures of external sense conveyed by the eye and the ear from natural objects and from the fine arts deserve a high place in our esteem because of their singular and extensive utility In some cases they arise to a considerable dignity  The very lowest pleasures of the kind are never esteemed mean or groveling The pleasure arising from wit humour ridicule or from what is simply ludicrous is useful by relaxing the mind after the fatigue of more manly occupation But the mind when it surrenders itself to pleasure of this kind loses its vigor and sinks gradually into sloth The place this pleasure occupies in point of dignity is adjusted to these views To make it useful as a relaxation it is not branded with meanness To prevent its usurpation it is removed from this place but a single degree No man values himself upon this pleasure even during the gratification and if more time have been given to it than is requisite for relaxation a man looks back with some degree of shame  In point of dignity the social passions rise above the selfish and much above the pleasures of the eye and ear Man is by his nature a social being and to qualify him for society it is wisely contrived that he should value himself more for being social than selfish  The excellency of man is chiefly discernible in the great improvements he is susceptible of in society These by perseverance may be carried on progressively to higher and higher degrees of perfection above any assignable limits and even abstracting from revelation there is great probability that the progress begun in this life will be completed in some future state Now as all valuable improvements proceed from the exercise of our rational faculties the author of our nature in order to excite us to a due use of these faculties hath assigned a high rank to the pleasures of the understanding Their utility with respect to this life as well as a future intitles them to this rank  But as action is the end of all our improvements virtuous actions justly possess the highest of all the ranks These I find are by nature distributed into different classes and the first in point of dignity assigned to actions which appear not the first in point of use Generosity for example in the sense of mankind is more respected than justice though the latter is undoubtedly more essential to society And magnanimity  heroism undaunted courage rise still higher in our esteem One would readily think that the moral virtues should be esteemed according to their importance Nature has here deviated from her ordinary path and great wisdom is shown in the deviation The efficient cause is explained above and the final cause is explained in the Essays of morality and natural religion  Part essay chap    CHAP XII RIDICULE  THIS subject has puzzled and vexed all the critics Aristole gives a definition of ridicule obscure and imperfect  Poet cap  Cicero handles it at great length  L De oratore  but without giving any satisfaction He wanders in the dark and misses the distinction betwixt risible and ridiculous Quintilian is sensible of this distinction  Ideoque anceps ejus rei ratio est quod a derisu non procul abest risus  Lib cap §  but has not attempted to explain it Luckily this subject lies no longer in obscurity A risible object produceth an emotion of laughter merely  See chap  A ridiculous object is improper as well as risible and produceth a mixt emotion which is vented by a laugh of derision or scorn  See chap    Having therefore happily unravelled the abstruse and knotty part I proceed to what may be thought further necessary upon this subject  Burlesque is one great engine of ridicule But it is not confined to that subject for it is clearly distinguishable into burlesque that excites laughter merely and burlesque that provokes derision or ridicule A grave subject in which there is no impropriety may be brought down by a certain colouring so as to be risible This is the case of  Virgil Travestie  Scarron  And it is the case of the  Secchia Rapita  Tassoni  The authors laugh first at every turn in order to make their readers laugh The  Lutrin  is a burlesque poem of the other sort The author Boileau lays hold of a low and trifling incident to expose the luxury indolence and contentious spirit of a set of monks He turns the subject into ridicule by dressing it in the heroic style and affecting to consider it as of the utmost dignity and importance and though ridicule is the poet's aim he himself carries  all along a grave face and never once bewrays a smile The opposition betwixt the subject and the manner of handling it is what produces the ridicule In a composition of this kind no image professedly ludicrous ought to have quarter because such images destroy the contrast  Though the burlesque that aims at ridicule produces its effect by elevating the style far above the subject yet it has limits beyond which the elevation ought not to be carried The poet consulting the imagination of his readers ought to confine himself to such images as are lively and readily apprehended A strained elevation soaring above an ordinary reach of fancy makes not a pleasant impression The mind fatigued with being always upon the stretch is soon disgusted and if it perseveres becomes thoughtless and indifferent Further a fiction gives no pleasure unless where painted in so lively colours as to produce some perception of reality which never can be done effectually where the images are formed with labour or difficulty For these reasons I cannot avoid condemning the  Batrachomuomachia  said to be the composition of Homer It is beyond the power of imagination to form a clear and lively image of frogs and mice acting with the dignity of the highest of our species nor can we form a conception of the reality of such an action in any manner so distinct as to interest our affections even in the slightest degree  The  Rape of the Lock  is of a character clearly distinguishable from those now mentioned It is not properly a burlesque performance but what may rather be termed  an heroicomical poem  It treats a gay and familiar subject with pleasantry and with a moderate degree of dignity The author puts not on a mask like Boileau nor professes to make us laugh like Tassoni The  Rape of the Lock  is a genteel and gay species of writing less strained than the others mentioned and is pleasant or ludicrous without having ridicule for its chief aim giving way however to ridicule where it arises naturally from a particular character such as that of Sir Plume Addison's  Spectator  upon the exercise of the fan  N  o    is extremely  gay and ludicrous resembling in its subject the  Rape of the Lock  Humour belongs to the present chapter because it is undoubtedly connected with ridicule Congreve defines humour to be  "a singular and unavoidable manner of doing or saying any thing peculiar and natural to one man only by which his speech and actions are distinguished from those of other men"  Were this definition just a majestic and commanding air which is a singular property is humour as also that natural flow of eloquence and correct elocution which is a rare talent Nothing just or proper is denominated humour nor any singularity of character words or actions that is valued or respected When we attend to the character of an humorist we find that the peculiarity of this character lessens the man in our esteem we find that this character arises from circumstances both risible and improper and therefore in some measure ridiculous  Humour in writing is very different from humour in character When an author insists upon ludicrous subjects with a professed  purpose to make his readers laugh he may be styled  a ludicrous writer  but is scarce intitled to be styled  a writer of humour  This quality belongs to an author who affecting to be grave and serious paints his objects in such colours as to provoke mirth and laughter A writer that is really an humorist in character does this without design If not he must affect the character in order to succeed Swift and Fontaine were humorists in character and their writings are full of humour Addison was not an humorist in character and yet in his prose writings a most delicate and refined humour prevails Arbuthnot exceeds them all in drollery and humorous painting which shows a great genius because if I am not misinformed he had nothing of this peculiarity in his character  There remains to show by examples the manner of treating subjects so as to give them a ridiculous appearance  Il ne dit jamais je vous donne mais je vous prete le bon jour  Moliere  Orleans  I know him to be valiant  Constable  I was told that by one that knows him better than you  Orleans  What's he  Constable  Marry he told me so himself and he said he car'd

violent and inflexible wise face like Solomon at the dividing of the child in an old tapestry hanging  Way of the world  A true critic in the perusal of a book is like a dog at a feast whose thoughts and stomach are wholly set upon what the guests fling away and consequently is apt to snarl most when there are the fewest bones  Tale of a Tub  In the following instances the ridicule is made to appear from the behaviour of the persons introduced  Mascarille  Te souvientil vicomte de cette demilune que nous emportâmes sur les ennemis au siege d'Arras  Jodelet  Que veux tu dire avec ta demilune c'etoit bien une lune toute entiere  Moliere les Precieuses Ridicules sc  Slender  I came yonder at Eaton to marry Mrs Anne Page and she's a great lubberly boy  Page  Upon my life then you

nothing more unbecoming a man of quality than to laugh 'tis such a vulgar expression of the passion every body can laugh Then especially to laugh at the jest of an inferior person or when any body else of the same quality does not laugh with one ridiculous To be pleas'd with what pleases the crowd Now when I laugh I always laugh alone  Double Dealer act sc  So sharpsighted is pride in blemishes

Lovespeeches are finely ridiculed in the following passage  Quoth he My faith as adamantine  As chains of destiny I'll maintain  True as Apollo ever spoke  Or oracle from heart of oak  And if you'll give my flame but vent  Now in close huggermugger pent  And shine upon me but benignly  With that one and that other pigsneye  The sun and day shall sooner part  Than love or you shake off my heart

survive  New worlds and natures to outlive  And like to herald's moons remain  All crescents without change or wane  Hudibras part canto  Irony turns things into ridicule in a peculiar manner It consists in laughing at a man under disguise by appearing to praise or speak well of him Swift affords us many illustrious examples of this species of ridicule Take the following example  "By these methods in a few weeks there starts up many a writer capable of managing the profoundest and most  universal subjects For what though his head be empty provided his commonplace book be full And if you will bate him but the circumstances of method and style and grammar and invention allow him but the common privileges of transcribing from others and digressing from himself as often as he shall see occasion he will desire no more ingredients towards fitting up a treatise that shall make a very comely figure on a bookseller's shelf there to be preserved neat and clean for a long eternity adorned with the heraldry of its title fairly inscribed on a label never to be thumbed or greased by students nor bound to everlasting chains of darkness in a library but when the fullness of time is come shall happily undergo the trial of purgatory in order to ascend the sky  Tale of a Tub sect  "  The following passage from Arbuthnot is not less ironical  "If the Reverend clergy showed more concern than others I charitably impute it to their great charge of souls and what confirmed me in this  opinion was that the degrees of apprehension and terror could be distinguished to be greater or less according to their ranks and degrees in the church  A true and faithful narrative of what passed in London during the general consternation of all ranks and degrees of mankind  "  A parody must be distinguished from every species of ridicule It enlivens a gay subject by imitating some important incident that is serious It is ludicrous and may be risible But ridicule is not a necessary ingredient Take the following examples the first of which refers to an expression of Moses  The skilful nymph reviews her force with care  Let spades be trumps she said and trumps they were  Rape of the Lock canto iii  The next is an imitation of Achilles's oath in Homer  But by this lock this sacred lock I swear  Which never more shall join its parted hair  Which never more its honours shall renew  Clip'd from the lovely head where late it grew  That while my nostrils draw the vital air  This hand which won it shall for ever wear  He spoke and speaking in proud triumph spread  The longcontended honours of her head  Ibid canto iv  The following imitates the history of Agamemnon's sceptre in Homer  Now meet thy fate incens'd Belinda cry'd  And drew a deadly bodkin from her side  The same his ancient personage to deck  Her greatgreatgrandsire wore about his neck  In three sealrings which after melted down  Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown  Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew  The bells she jingled and the whistle blew  Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs  Which long she wore and now Belinda wears  Ibid canto v  Ridicule as observed above is no necessary ingredient in a parody But I did not intend to say that there is any opposition betwixt them A parody no doubt may be successfully employed to promote ridicule  witness the following example in which the goddess of Dullness is addressed upon the subject of modern education  Thou gav'st that ripeness which so soon began  And ceas'd so soon he ne'er was boy nor man  Through school and college thy kind cloud o'ercast  Safe and unseen the young Aeneas past  Aen l  At Venus obscuro  c    Thence bursting glorious all at once let down  Stunn'd with his giddy larum half the town  Dunciad b iv  The interposition of the gods in the manner of Homer and Virgil ought to be confined to ludicrous subjects which are much enlivened by such interposition handled in the form of a parody witness the cave of Spleen  Rape of the Lock    canto  the goddess of Discord  Lutrin    canto  and the goddess of Indolence  canto    Those who have a talent for ridicule which is seldom united with a taste for delicate and refined beauties are quicksighted in improprieties and these they eagerly  lay hold of in order to gratify their favourite propensity The persons galled have no other refuge but to maintain that ridicule ought not to be applied to grave subjects It is yielded on the other hand that subjects really grave and important are by no means fit for ridicule but then it is urged that ridicule is the only proper test for discovering whether a subject be really grave or be made so artificially by custom and fashion This dispute has produced a celebrated question Whether ridicule be or be not a test of truth I give this question a place here because it tends to illustrate the nature of ridicule  The question stated in accurate terms is Whether the sense of ridicule be the proper test for distinguishing ridiculous objects from those that are not so To answer this question with precision I must premise that ridicule is not a subject of reasoning but of sense or taste  See chap compared with chap  This being taken for granted I proceed thus No person doubts that our sense of beauty is the true test of what  is beautiful and our sense of grandeur of what is great or sublime Is it more doubtful whether our sense of ridicule be the true test of what is ridiculous It is not only the true test but indeed the only test For this is a subject that comes not more than beauty or grandeur under the province of reason If any subject by the influence of fashion or custom have acquired a degree of veneration or esteem to which naturally it is not intitled what are the proper means for wiping off the artificial colouring and displaying the subject in its true light Reasoning as observed cannot be applied And therefore the only means is to judge by taste The test of ridicule which separates it from its artificial connections exposes it naked with all its native improprieties  But it is urged that the gravest and most serious matters may be set in a ridiculous light Hardly so for where an object is neither risible nor improper it lies not open in any quarter to an attack from ridicule But supposing the fact I foresee not any harmful consequence By the same sort of reasoning a talent for wit ought to be condemned because it may be employed to  burlesque a great or lofty subject Such irregular use made of a talent for wit or ridicule cannot long impose upon mankind It cannot stand the test of correct and delicate taste and truth will at last prevail even with the vulgar To condemn a talent for ridicule because it may be perverted to wrong purposes is not a little ridiculous Could one forbear to smile if a talent for reasoning were condemned because it also may be perverted And yet the conclusion in the latter case would be not less just than in the former perhaps more just for no talent is so often perverted as that of reason  We had best leave Nature to her own operations The most valuable talents may be abused and so may that of ridicule Let us bring it under proper culture if we can without endeavouring to pull it up by the root Were we destitute of this test of truth I know not what might be the consequences I see not what rule would be left us to prevent splendid trifles passing for matters of importance show and form for substance and superstition or enthusiasm for pure religion  CHAP XIII WIT  WIT is a quality of certain thoughts and expressions The term is never applied to an action or a passion and as little to an external object  However difficult it may be in every particular instance to distinguish a witty thought or expression from one that is not so yet in general it may be laid down that the term  wit  is appropriated to such thoughts and expressions as are ludicrous and also occasion some degree of surprise by their singularity Wit also in a figurative sense expresses that talent which some men have of inventing ludicrous thoughts or expressions We say commonly  a witty man  or  a man of wit  Wit in its proper sense as suggested above is distinguishable into two kinds wit in the thought and wit in the words or expression Again wit in the thought is of  two kinds ludicrous images and ludicrous combinations of things that have little or no natural relation  Ludicrous images that occasion surprise by their singularity as having little or no foundation in nature are fabricated by the imagination And the imagination is well qualified for the office being of all our faculties the most active and the least under restraint Take the following example  Shylock  You knew none so well none so well as you of my daughter's flight  Salino  That's certain I for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal  Merchant of Venice act sc  The image here is undoubtedly witty It is ludicrous and it must occasion surprise for having no natural foundation it is altogether unexpected  The other branch of wit in the thought is that only which is taken notice of by Addison following Locke who defines it  "to lie in the assemblage of ideas and putting those together with quickness and variety wherein can be found any resemblance  or congruity thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy  B ch §  "  It may be defined more curtly and perhaps more accurately  "A junction of things by distant and fanciful relations which surprise because they are unexpected  See chap  "  The following is a proper example  We grant although he had much wit  H' was very shie of using it  As being loth to wear it out  And therefore bore it not about  Unless on holidays or so  As men their best apparel do  Hudibras canto  Wit is of all the most elegant recreation The image enters the mind with gaiety and gives a sudden flash which is extremely pleasant Wit thereby gently elevates without straining raises mirth without dissoluteness and relaxes while it entertains  Wit in the expression commonly called  a play of words  being a bastard sort of wit  is reserved for the last place I proceed to examples of wit in the thought And first of ludicrous images  Falstaff speaking of his taking Sir John Colevile of the Dale  Here he is and here I yield him and I beseech your Grace let it be book'd with the rest of this day's deeds or by the Lord I will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top of it Colevile kissing my foot to

Protestant religion of the Pope's being seen in a brandyshop at Wapping"  c  History of John Bull part ch  The other branch of wit in the thought  viz  ludicrous combinations and oppositions may be traced through various ramifications  And first fanciful causes assigned that have no natural relation to the effects produced  Lancaster  Fare you well Falstaff I in my condition  Shall better speak

 a play of words  This sort of wit depends for the most part upon chusing words that have different significations By this artifice hocuspocus tricks are played in language and thoughts plain and simple take on a very different appearance Play is necessary for man in order to refresh him after labour and accordingly man loves play He even relisheth a play of  words and it is happy for us that words can be employed not only for useful purposes but also for our amusement This amusement accordingly though humble and low is relished by some at all times and by all at some times in order to unbend the mind  It is remarkable that this low species of wit has at one time or other made a figure in most civilized nations and has gradually gone into disrepute So soon as a language is formed into a system and the meaning of words are ascertained with tolerable accuracy opportunity is afforded for expressions which by the double meaning of some words give a familiar thought the appearance of being new And the penetration of the reader or hearer is gratified in detecting the true sense disguised under the double meaning That this sort of wit was in England deemed a reputable amusement during the reigns of Elisabeth and James I is vouched by the works of Shakespear and even by the writings of grave divines But it cannot have any any long endurance for as language ripens and the meaning of  words is more and more ascertained words held to be synonymous diminish daily and when those that remain have been more than once employed the pleasure vanisheth with the novelty  I proceed to examples which as in the former case shall be distributed into different classes  A seeming resemblance from the double meaning of a word  Beneath this stone my wife doth lie  She's now at rest and so am I  A seeming contrast from the same cause termed  a verbal antithesis  which hath no despicable effect in ludicrous subjects  Whilst Iris his cosmetic wash would try  To make her bloom

"This General is a great taker of snuff as well as of towns"  Pope Key to the Lock  Exul mentisque domusque  Metamorphoses lib ix  A seeming inconsistency from the same cause  Hic quiescit qui nunquam quievit  Again  Quel âge a cette Iris dont on fait tant de bruit  Me demandoit Cliton n'aguere  Il faut disje vous satisfaire  Elle a vingt ans le jour et cinquante ans la nuit  Again  So like the

cold would burn though dry would melt  Strephon and Chole  Taking a word in a different sense from what is meant comes under wit because it occasions some slight degree of surprise  Beatrice  I may

one wrong but so connected with other matters as to direct us to the wrong meaning This species of bastard wit is distinguished from all others by the name  pun  For example  Paris  Sweet Helen I must

pun Talking of some infamous wretch whose name was  Rex Rupilius  Persius exclamat Per magnos Brute deos te  Oro qui reges consueris tollere cur non  Hunc regem jugulas Operum hoc mihi crede tuorum est  Though playing with words is a mark of a mind at ease and disposed for any sort of amusement we must not thence conclude that playing with words is always ludicrous Words are so intimately connected with  thought that if the subject be really grave it will not appear ludicrous even in this fantastic dress I am however far from recommending it in any serious performance On the contrary the discordance betwixt the thought and expression must be disagreeable witness the following specimen  He hath abandoned his physicians Madam under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope

high degree with novelty would any one conjecture that he is equally affected with custom Yet these frequently take place not only in the same person but even with relation to the same subject when new it is inchanting familiarity renders it indifferent and custom after a longer familiarity makes it again desirable Human nature diversified with many and various springs of action is wonderfully and indulging the expression intricately constructed  Custom hath such influence upon many of our feelings by warping and varying them that we must attend to its operations if we would be acquainted with human nature  This subject in itself obscure has been much neglected and to give a complete analysis of it will be no easy task I pretend only to touch it cursorily hoping however that what is here laid down will dispose more diligent inquirers to attempt further discoveries  Custom  respects the action  habit  the actor By custom we mean a frequent reiteration of the same act and by habit the effect that custom has on the mind or body This effect may be either active witness the dexterity produced by custom in performing certain exercises or passive as when by custom a peculiar connection is formed betwixt a man and some agreeable object which acquires thereby a greater power to raise emotions in him than it hath naturally Active habits come not under the present undertaking and therefore I confine myself to those that are passive  This subject is thorny and intricate Some pleasures are fortified by custom and yet custom begets familiarity and consequently  indifference  If all the year were playing holidays  To sport would be as tedious as to work  But when they seldom come they wish'dfor come  And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents  First part Henry IV act sc  In many instances satiety and disgust are the consequences of reiteration Again though custom blunts the edge of distress and of pain yet the want of any thing to which we have long been accustomed is a sort of torture A clue to guide us through all the intricacies of this labyrinth would be an acceptable present  Whatever be the cause it is an established fact that we are much influenced by custom It hath an effect upon our pleasures upon our actions and even upon our thoughts and sentiments Habit makes no figure during the vivacity of youth in middle age it gains ground and in old age it governs without control In that period of life generally speaking we eat at a certain hour take exercise at a certain hour go to rest at a certain hour all by the direction of habit Nay a particular seat table bed comes to be essential And a habit in  any of these cannot be contradicted without uneasiness  Any slight or moderate pleasure frequently reiterated for a long time forms a connection betwixt us and the thing that causes the pleasure This connection termed  habit  has the effect to raise our desire or appetite for that thing when it returns not as usual During the course of enjoyment the pleasure grows insensibly stronger till a habit be established at which time the pleasure is at its height It continues not however stationary The same customary reiteration which carried it to its height brings it down again by insensible degrees even lower than it was at first But of this circumstance afterward What at present we have in view is to prove by experiments that those things which at first are but moderately agreeable are the aptest to become habitual Spirituous liquors at first scarce agreeable readily produce an habitual appetite and custom prevails so far as even to make us fond of things originally disagreeable such as coffee assafoetida and  tobacco This is pleasantly illustrated by Congreve  Fainall  For a passionate lover methinks you are a man somewhat too discerning in the failings of your mistress  Mirabell  And for a discerning man somewhat too passionate a lover for I like her with all her faults nay like her for her faults Her follies are so natural or so artful that they become her and those affectations which in another woman would be odious serve but to make her more agreeable I'll tell thee Fainall she once us'd me with that insolence that in revenge I took her to pieces sifted her and separated her failings I study'd 'em and got 'em by rote The catalogue was so large that I was not without hopes one day or other to hate her heartily to which end I so us'd myself to think of 'em that at length contrary to my design and expectation they gave me every hour less and less disturbance till in a few days it became habitual to me to remember 'em without being displeased They are now grown as familiar to me as my own frailties and in all probability in a little time longer I shall like 'em as well  The way of the world act sc  A walk upon the quarterdeck though intolerably confined becomes however so agreeable by custom that a sailor in his walk on shore confines himself commonly within the same bounds I knew a man who had relinquished the sea for a countrylife In the corner of his garden he reared an artificial mount with a level summit resembling most accurately a quarterdeck not only in shape but in size and this was his choice walk Play or gaming at first barely amusing by the occupation it affords becomes in time extremely agreeable and is frequently prosecuted with avidity as if it were the chief business of life The same observation is applicable to the pleasures of the internal senses those of knowledge and virtue in particular Children have scarce any sense of these pleasures and men very little who are in the state of nature without culture Our taste for virtue and knowledge improves slowly but is capable of growing stronger than any other appetite in human nature  To introduce a habit frequency of acts is not alone sufficient length of time is also  necessary The quickest succession of acts in a short time is not sufficient nor a slow succession in the longest time The effect must be produced by a moderate soft action and a long series of easy touches removed from each other by short intervals Nor are these sufficient without regularity in the time place and other circumstances of the action The more uniform any operation is the sooner it becomes habitual and this holds equally in a passive habit Variety in any remarkable degree prevents the effect Thus any particular food will scarce ever become habitual where the manner of dressing is varied The circumstances then requisite to augment any pleasure and at the long run to form a habit are weak uniform acts reiterated during a long course of time without any considerable interruption Every agreeable cause which operates in this manner will grow habitual  Affection  and  aversion  as distinguished from passion on the one hand and on the other from original disposition are in reality habits respecting particular objects acquired in the manner above set forth The  pleasure of social intercourse with any person must originally be faint and frequently reiterated in order to establish the habit of affection Affection thus generated whether it be friendship or love seldom swells into any tumultuous or vigorous passion but is however the strongest cement that can bind together two individuals of the human species In like manner a slight degree of disgust often reiterated with any degree of regularity grows into the habit of aversion which generally subsists for life  Those objects of taste that are the most agreeable are so far from having a tendency to become habitual that too great indulgence fails not to produce satiety and disgust No man contracts a habit of taking sugar honey or sweetmeats as he doth of tobacco  Dulcia non ferimus succo renovamur amaro  Ovid art Amand l  Insipido è quel dolce che condito  Non è di qualche amaro e tosto satia  Aminta di Tasso  These violent delights have violent ends  And in their triumph die The sweetest honey  Is loathsome in its own deliciousness  And in the taste confounds the appetite  Therefore love mod'rately long love doth so  Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow  Romeo and Juliet act sc  The same holds in the causes of all violent pleasures these causes are not naturally susceptible of habit Great passions suddenly raised are incompatible with a habit of any sort In particular they never produce affection or aversion A man who at first sight falls violently in love has a strong desire of enjoyment but no affection for the woman  Violent love without affection is finely exemplified in the following story When Constantinople was taken by the Turks Irene a young Greek of an illustrious family sell into the hands of Mahomet II who was at that time in the prime of youth and glory Irene's charms conquered the savage heart of Mahomet He abandoned himself to his new mistress and shut himself up with her denying access even to his ministers His passion seemed to increase with time In the most important expeditions frequently would he abandon the army and fly to his Irene War was at a stand for victory was no longer the monarch's favourite passion The soldiers accustomed to booty began to murmur and the infection spread even among the commanders The Basha Mustapha consulting the fidelity he owed his master was the first who durst acquaint him of the discourses held publicly to the prejudice of his glory  The Sultan after a gloomy silence formed his resolution He ordered Mustapha to assemble the troops next morning and then retired with precipitation to Irene's apartment Never before did that princess appear so charming never before did the prince bestow so many tender caresses To give a new lustre to her beauty he exhorted her women next morning to bestow all their art and care on her dress He took her by the hand led her into the middle of the army and pulling off her vail demanded at the Bashas with a fierce look whether they had ever beheld so accomplished a beauty After an awful pause Mahomet with one hand laying hold of the young Greek by her beautiful locks and with the other pulling out his simitar severed the head from the body at one stroke Then turning to his grandees with eyes wild and furious  "This sword"  says he  "when it is my will knows to cut the bands of love"  A man who is surprised  with an unexpected favour burns for an opportunity to exert his gratitude without having any affection for his benefactor Neither does desire of vengeance for an atrocious injury involve aversion  It is perhaps not easy to say why moderate pleasures gather strength by custom But two causes concur to prevent this effect  in the more intense pleasures These by an original law in our nature increase quickly to their full growth and decay with no less precipitation  See chap part  and custom is too slow in its operation to overcome this law Another cause is not less powerful The mind is exhausted with pleasure as well as with pain Exquisite pleasure is extremely fatiguing occasioning as a naturalist would say great expence of animal spirits  Lady Easy upon her husband's reformation expresses to her friend the following sentiment  "Be satisfy'd Sir Charles has made me happy even to a pain of joy"  And therefore of such the mind cannot bear so frequent gratification as to superinduce a habit If the thing which raises the pleasure return before the mind have recovered its tone and relish disgust ensues instead of pleasure  A habit never fails to admonish us of the wonted time of gratification by raising a pain for want of the object and a desire to have it The pain of want is always first felt the desire naturally follows and upon  presenting the object both vanish instantaneously Thus a man accustomed to tobacco feels at the end of the usual interval a confused pain of want which in its first appearance points at nothing in particular though it soon settles upon its accustomed object The same may be observed in persons addicted to drinking who are often in an uneasy restless state before they think of their bottle In pleasures indulged regularly and at equal intervals the appetite remarkably obsequious to custom returns regularly with the usual time of gratification and a sight of the object in the interim has scarce any power to move it This pain of want arising from habit seems directly opposite to that of satiety Singular it must appear that frequency of gratification should produce effects so opposite as are the pains of excess and of want  The appetites that respect the preservation and propagation of our species are attended with a pain of want similar to that occasioned by habit Hunger and thirst are uneasy sensations of want which always precede the desire of eating or drinking  and a pain for want of carnal enjoyment precedes the desire of a proper object The pain being thus felt independent of an object cannot be cured but by gratification An ordinary passion in which desire precedes the pain of want is in a different condition It is never felt but while the object is in view and therefore by removing the object out of thought it vanisheth with its desire and pain of want  See chap part    These natural appetites above mentioned differ from habit in the following particular They have an undetermined direction toward all objects of gratification in general whereas an habitual appetite is directed upon a particular object The attachment we have by habit to a particular woman differs widely from the natural passion which comprehends the whole sex and the habitual relish for a particular dish is far from being the same with a vague appetite for food Notwithstanding this difference it is still remarkable that nature hath inforced the gratification of certain natural  appetites essential to the species by a pain of the same sort with that which habit produceth  The pain of habit is less under our power than any other pain for want of gratification Hunger and thirst are more easily endured especially at first than an unusual intermission of any habitual pleasure We often hear persons declaring they would forego sleep or food rather than snuff or any other habitual trifle We must not however conclude that the gratification of an habitual appetite affords the same delight with the gratification of one that is natural Far from it the pain of want only is greater  The slow and reiterated acts that produce a habit strengthen the mind to enjoy the habitual pleasure in greater quantity and more frequency than originally and by this means a habit of intemperate gratification is often formed After unbounded acts of intemperance the habitual relish is soon restored and the pain for want of enjoyment returns with fresh vigor  The causes of the pleasant emotions hitherto in view are either an individual such  as a companion a certain dwellingplace certain amusements  c  or a particular species such as coffee mutton or any particular food But habit is not confined to these A constant train of trifling diversions may form such a habit in the mind as that it cannot be easy a moment without amusement Variety in the objects prevents a habit as to any one in particular but as the train is uniform with respect to amusement in general the habit is formed accordingly and this sort of habit may be denominated  a generic habit  in opposition to the former which may be called  a specific habit  A habit of a townlife of countrysports of solitude of reading or of business where sufficiently varied are instances of generic habits It ought to be remarked that every specific habit hath a mixture of the generic The habit of one particular sort of food makes the taste agreeable and we are fond of this taste whereever found A man deprived of an habitual object takes up with what most resembles it deprived of tobacco any bitter herb will do rather than want The habit of drinking punch  makes wine a good resource A man accustomed to the sweet society and comforts of matrimony being unhappily deprived of his beloved object inclines the sooner to a second choice In general the quality which the most affects us in an habitual object produceth when we are deprived of it a strong appetite for that quality in any other object  The reasons are assigned above why the causes of intense pleasure become not readily habitual But now I must observe that these reasons conclude only against specific habits With regard to any particular object that is the cause of a weak pleasure a habit is formed by frequency and uniformity of reiteration which in the case of an intense pleasure cannot obtain without satiety and disgust But it is remarkable that satiety and disgust have no effect except as to that thing which occasions them A surfeit of honey produceth not a loathing of sugar and intemperance with one woman produceth no disrelish of the same pleasure with others Hence it is easy to account for a generic habit in any strong pleasure  The disgust of intemperance is confined to the object by which it is produced The delight we had in the gratification of the appetite inflames the imagination and makes us with avidity search for the same gratification in whatever other object it can be found And thus frequency and uniformity in gratifying the same passion upon different objects produceth at the longrun a habit In this manner a man acquires an habitual delight in high and poignant sauces rich dress fine equipage crowds of company and in whatever is commonly termed  pleasure  There concurs at the same time to introduce this habit a peculiarity observed above that reiteration of acts enlarges the capacity of the mind to admit a more plentiful gratification than originally with regard to frequency as well as quantity  Hence it appears that though a specific habit can only take place in the case of a moderate pleasure yet that a generic habit may be formed with respect to every sort of pleasure moderate or immoderate that can be gratified by a variety of objects indifferently The only difference is that any particular  object which causes a weak pleasure runs naturally into a specific habit whereas a particular object that causes an intense pleasure is altogether incapable of such a habit In a word it is but in singular cases that a moderate pleasure produces a generic habit an intense pleasure on the other hand cannot produce any other habit  The appetites that respect the preservation and propagation of the species are formed into habit in a peculiar manner The time as well as measure of their gratification are much under the power of custom which by introducing a change upon the body occasions a proportional change in the appetites Thus if the body be gradually formed to a certain quantity of food at regular times the appetite is regulated accordingly and the appetite is again changed when a different habit of body is introduced by a different practice Here it would seem that the change is not made upon the mind which is commonly the case in passive habits but only upon the body  When rich food is brought down by ingredients of a plainer taste the composition  is susceptible of a specific habit Thus the sweet taste of sugar rendered less poignant in a mixture may in course of time produce a specific habit for such mixture As moderate pleasures by becoming more intense tend to generic habits so intense pleasures by becoming more moderate tend to specific habits  The beauty of the human figure by a special recommendation of nature appears to us supreme amid the great variety of beauteous forms bestowed upon animals The various degrees in which individuals enjoy this property render it an object sometimes of a moderate sometimes of an intense passion The moderate passion admitting frequent reiteration without diminution and occupying the mind without exhausting it becomes gradually stronger till it settle in a habit So true this is that instances are not wanting of an ugly face at first disagreeable afterward rendered indifferent by familiarity and at the longrun agreeable On the other hand consummate beauty at the very first view fills the mind so as to admit no increase Enjoyment  in this case lessens the pleasure  See chap part  and if often repeated ends commonly in satiety and disgust Constant experience shows that the emotions created by great beauty become weaker by familiarity The impressions made successively by such an object strong at first and lessening by degrees constitute a series opposite to that of the weak and increasing emotions which grow into a specific habit But the mind when accustomed to beauty contracts a relish for it in general though often repelled from particular objects by the pain of satiety Thus a generic habit is formed of which inconstancy in love is the necessary consequence For a generic habit comprehending every beautiful object is an invincible obstruction to a specific habit which is confined to one  But a matter which is of great importance to the youth of both sexes deserves more than a cursory view Though the pleasant emotion of beauty differs widely from the corporeal appetite yet both may  concur upon the same object When this is the case they inflame the imagination and produce a very strong complex passion  See chap part  which is incapable of increase because the mind as to pleasure is limited rather more than as to pain Enjoyment in this case must be exquisite and therefore more apt to produce satiety than in any other case whatever This is a neverfailing effect where consummate beauty on the one side meets with a warm imagination and great sensibility on the other What I am here explaining is the naked truth without exaggeration They must be insensible upon whom this doctrine makes no impression and it deserves well to be pondered by the young and the amorous who in forming a society which is not dissolvable are too often blindly impelled by the animal pleasure merely inflamed by beauty It may indeed happen after this pleasure is gone and go it must with a swift pace that a new connection is formed upon more dignified and more lasting principles But  this is a dangerous experiment For even supposing good sense good temper and internal merit of every sort which is a very favourable supposition yet a new connection upon these qualifications is rarely formed It generally or rather always happens that such qualifications the only solid foundation of an indissoluble connection are rendered altogether invisible by satiety of enjoyment creating disgust  One effect of custom different from any that have been explained must not be omitted because it makes a great figure in human nature Custom augments moderate pleasures and diminishes those that are intense It has a different effect with respect to pain for it blunts the edge of every sort of pain and distress great and small Uninterrupted misery therefore is attended with one good effect If its torments be incessant custom hardens us to bear them  It is extremely curious to remark the gradual changes that are made in forming habits Moderate pleasures are augmented gradually by reiteration till they become  habitual and then are at their height But they are not long stationary for from that point they gradually decay till they vanish altogether The pain occasioned by the want of gratification runs a very different course This pain increases uniformly and at last becomes extreme when the pleasure of gratification is reduced to nothing  It so falls out  That what we have we prize not to the worth  Whiles we enjoy it but being lack'd and lost  Why then we rack the value then we find  The virtue that possession would not shew us  Whilst it was ours  Much ado about nothing act sc  The effect of custom with relation to a specific habit is displayed through all its varieties in the use of tobacco The taste of this plant is at first extremely unpleasant Our disgust lessens gradually till it vanish altogether at which period the plant is neither agreeable nor disagreeable Continuing the use we begin to relish it and our relish increases by use till it come to its utmost extent From this state it gradually decays while the habit becomes stronger  and stronger and consequently the pain of want The result is that when the habit has acquired its greatest vigor the pleasure of gratification is gone And hence it is that we often smoke and take snuff habitually without so much as being conscious of the operation We must except gratification after the pain of want because gratification in that case is at the height when the habit is strongest It is of the same kind with the joy one feels upon being delivered from the rack the cause of which is explained above  Chap part sect  This pleasure however is but occasionally the effect of habit and however exquisite is guarded against as much as possible by preventing want  With regard to the pain of want I can discover no difference betwixt a generic and specific habit the pain is the same in both But these habits differ widely with respect to the positive pleasure I have had occasion to observe that the pleasure of a specific habit decays gradually till it become imperceptible Not so the pleasure of a generic  habit So far as I can discover this pleasure suffers little or no decay after it comes to its height The variety of gratification preserves it entire However it may be with other generic habits the observation I am certain holds with respect to the pleasures of virtue and of knowledge The pleasure of doing good has such an unbounded scope and may be so variously gratified that it can never decay Science is equally unbounded and our appetite for knowledge has an ample range of gratification where discoveries are recommended by novelty by variety by utility or by all of them  Here is a large field of facts and experiments and several phenomena unfolded the causes of which have been occasionally suggested The efficient cause of the power of custom over man a fundamental point in the present chapter has unhappily evaded my keenest search and now I am reduced to hold it an original branch of the human constitution though I have no better reason for my opinion than that I cannot resolve it into any other principle But with respect  to the final cause a point of still greater importance I promise myself more success It cannot indeed have escaped any thinking person that the power of custom is a happy contrivance for our good Exquisite pleasure produceth satiety moderate pleasure becomes stronger by custom Business is our province and pleasure our relaxation only Hence satiety is necessary to check exquisite pleasures which otherwise would ingross the mind and unqualify us for business On the other hand habitual increase of moderate pleasure and even conversion of pain into pleasure are admirably contrived for disappointing the malice of Fortune and for reconciling us to whatever course of life may be our lot  How use doth breed a habit in a man  This shadowy desert unfrequented woods  I better brook than flourishing peopled towns  Here I can sit alone unseen of any  And to the nightingale's complaining notes  Tune my distresses and record my woes  Two Gentlemen of Verona act sc  The foregoing distinction betwixt intense  and moderate holds in pleasure only not in pain every degree of which is softened by time and custom Custom is a catholicon for pain and distress of every sort and of this regulation the final cause is so evident as to require no illustration  Another final cause of custom will be highly relished by every person of humanity and yet has in a great measure been overlooked Custom hath a greater influence than any other known principle to put the rich and poor upon a level Weak pleasures which fall to the share of the latter become fortunately stronger by custom while voluptuous pleasures the lot of the former are continually losing ground by satiety Men of fortune who possess palaces sumptuous gardens rich fields enjoy them less than passengers do The goods of Fortune are not unequally distributed the opulent possess what others enjoy  And indeed if it be the effect of habit to produce the pain of want in a high degree while there is little pleasure in enjoyment a voluptuous life is of all the least to be envied Those who are accustomed  to high feeding easy vehicles rich furniture a crowd of valets much deference and flattery enjoy but a small share of happiness while they are exposed to manifold distresses To such a man inslaved by ease and luxury even the petty inconveniencies of a rough road bad weather or homely fare on a journey are serious evils He loses his tone of mind becomes peevish and would wreak his resentment even upon the common accidents of life Better far to use the goods of Fortune with moderation A man who by temperance and activity has acquired a hardy constitution is on the one hand guarded against external accidents and is on the other provided with great variety of enjoyment ever at command  I shall close this chapter with the discussion of a question more delicate than abstruse  viz  What authority custom ought to have over our taste in the fine arts It is proper to be premised that we chearfully abandon to its authority every thing that nature leaves to our choice and where the preference we bestow has no foundation other than whim or fancy There appears  no original difference betwixt the right and the left hand custom however has established a difference so as to make it aukward and disagreeable to use the left where the right is commonly used The various colours though they affect us differently are all of them agreeable in their purity But custom has regulated this matter in another manner a black skin upon a human creature is to us disagreeable and a white skin probably not less so to a negro Thus things originally indifferent become agreeable or disagreeable by the force of custom Nor ought this to be surprising after the discovery made above that the original agreeableness or disagreeableness of an object is by the influence of custom often converted into the opposite quality  Concerning now those matters of taste where there is naturally a preference of one thing before another it is certain in the first place that our faint and more delicate feelings are readily susceptible of a bias from custom and therefore that it is no proof of a defective taste to find these in some measure under the government of custom  Dress and the modes of external behaviour are justly regulated by custom in every country The deep red or vermilion with which the ladies in France cover their cheeks appears to them beautiful in spite of nature and strangers cannot altogether be justified in condemning this practice considering the lawful authority of custom or of the  fashion  as it is called It is told of the people who inhabit the skirts of the Alps facing the north that the swelling they universally have in the neck is to them agreeable So far has custom power to change the nature of things and to make an object originally disagreeable take on an opposite appearance  But as to the emotions of propriety and impropriety and in general as to all emotions involving the sense of right or wrong custom has little authority and ought to have none at all Emotions of this kind being qualified with the consciousness of duty take naturally place of every other feeling and it argues a shameful weakness or degeneracy of mind to find them in any case so far subdued as to submit to custom  These few hints may enable us to judge in some measure of foreign manners whether exhibited by foreign writers or our own A comparison betwixt the ancients and the moderns was some time ago a favourite subject Those who declared for the former thought it a sufficient justification of ancient manners that they were supported by the authority of custom Their antagonists on the other hand refusing submission to custom as a standard of taste condemned ancient manners in several instances as irrational In this controversy an appeal being made to different principles without the slightest attempt on either side to establish a common standard the dispute could have no end The hints above given tend to establish a standard for judging how far the lawful authority of custom may be extended and within what limits it ought to be confined For the sake of illustration we shall apply this standard in a few instances  Human sacrifices the cruellest effect of blind and groveling superstition wore gradually out of use by the prevalence of reason  and humanity In the days of Sophocles and Euripides the traces of this savage practice were still recent and the Athenians through the prevalence of custom could without disgust suffer human sacrifices to be represented in their theatre The Iphigenia of Euripides is a proof of this fact But a human sacrifice being altogether inconsistent with modern manners as producing horror instead of pity cannot with any propriety be introduced upon a modern stage I must therefore condemn the Iphigenia of Racine which instead of the tender and sympathetic passions substitutes disgust and horror But this is not all Another objection occurs against every fable that deviates so remarkably from improved notions and sentiments If it should even command our belief by the authority of genuine history its fictitious and unnatural appearance however would prevent its taking such hold of the mind as to produce a perception of reality  See chap part sect  A human sacrifice is so unnatural and to us so improbable  that few will be affected with the representation of it more than with a fairy tale The objection first mentioned strikes also against the  Phedra  of this author The queen's passion for her stepson being unnatural and beyond all bounds creates aversion and horror rather than compassion The author in his preface observes that the queen's passion however unnatural was the effect of destiny and the wrath of the gods and he puts the same excuse in her own mouth But what is the wrath of a heathen god to us Christians We acknowledge no destiny in passion and if love be unnatural it never can be relished A supposition like what our author lays hold of may possibly cover slight improprieties but it will never engage our sympathy for what appears to us frantic or extravagant  Neither can I relish the catastrophe of this tragedy A man of taste may peruse without disgust a Grecian performance describing a seamonster sent by Neptune to destroy Hippolytus He considers that such a story might agree with the religious creed of Greece and entering into ancient opinions  may be pleased with the story as what probably had a strong effect upon a Grecian audience But he cannot have the same indulgence for such a representation upon a modern stage for no story which carries a violent air of fiction can ever move us in any considerable degree  In the  Coëphores  of Eschylus  Act  Orestes is made to say that he was commanded by Apollo to avenge his father's murder and yet if he obeyed that he was to be delivered to the furies or be struck with some horrible malady The tragedy accordingly concludes with a chorus deploring the fate of Orestes obliged to take vengeance against a mother and involved thereby in a crime against his will It is impossible for any man at present to accommodate his mind to opinions so irrational and absurd which must disgust him in perusing even a Grecian story Among the Greeks again grossly superstitious it was a common opinion that the report of a man's death was a presage of his death and Orestes in  the first act of  Electra  spreading a report of his own death in order to blind his mother and her adulterer is even in this case affected with the presage Such imbecility can never find grace with a modern audience It may indeed produce some degree of compassion for a people afflicted to such a degree with absurd terrors similar to what is felt in perusing a description of the Hottentotes but manners of this kind will not interest our affections nor excite any degree of social concern  CHAP XV External Signs of Emotions and Passions  SO intimately connected are the soul and body that there is not a single agitation in the former but what produceth a visible effect upon the latter There is at the same time a wonderful uniformity in this operation each class of emotions being invariably attended with an external appearance peculiar to itself  Omnis enim motus animi suum quemdam a natura habet vultum et sonum et gestum  Cicero l De oratore  These external appearances or signs may not improperly be considered as a natural language expressing to all beholders the several emotions and passions as they arise in the heart We perceive display'd externally hope fear joy grief we can read the character of a man in his face and  beauty which makes so strong an impression is known to result not so much from regular features and a fine complexion as from good nature good sense sprightliness sweetness or other mental quality expressed some way upon the countenance Though perfect skill in this language be rare yet so much knowledge of it is diffused through mankind as to be sufficient for the ordinary events of life But by what means we come to understand this language is a point of some intricacy It cannot be by sight merely for upon the most attentive inspection of the human visage all that can be discerned are figure colour and motion and yet these singly or combined never can represent a passion or a sentiment The external sign is indeed visible But to understand its meaning we must be able to connect it with the passion that causes it an operation far beyond the reach of eyesight Where then is the instructor to be found that can unvail this secret connection If we apply to experience it is yielded that from long and diligent observation we may gather in some  measure in what manner those we are acquainted with express their passions externally But with respect to strangers of whom we have no experience we are left in the dark And yet we are not puzzled about the meaning of these external expressions in a stranger more than in a bosomcompanion  See this explained Essays on morality and natural religion part essay  Further had we no other means but experience for understanding the external signs of passion we could not expect any uniformity or any degree of skill in the bulk of individuals But matters are ordered so differently that the external expressions of passion form a language understood by all by the young as well as the old by the ignorant as well as the learned I talk of the plain and legible characters of this language for undoubtedly we are much indebted to experience in deciphering the dark and more delicate expressions Where then shall we apply for a solution of this intricate problem which seems to penetrate deep into human nature In my  mind it will be convenient to suspend the inquiry till we be better acquainted with the nature of external signs and with their operations These articles therefore shall be premised  The external signs of passion are of two kinds voluntary and involuntary The voluntary signs are also of two kinds some are arbitrary and some natural Words are arbitrary signs excepting a few simple sounds expressive of certain internal emotions and these sounds being the same in all languages must be the work of nature But though words are arbitrary the manner of employing them is not altogether so for each passion has by nature peculiar expressions and tones suited to it Thus the unpremeditated tones of admiration are the same in all men as also of compassion resentment and despair Dramatic writers ought to be well acquainted with this natural manner of expressing passion The chief talent of a fine writer is a ready command of the expressions that nature dictates to every man when any vivid emotion struggles for utterance and the chief talent  of a fine reader is a ready command of the tones suited to these expressions  The other kind of voluntary signs comprehends certain attitudes and gestures that naturally accompany certain emotions with a surprising uniformity Thus excessive joy is expressed by leaping dancing or some elevation of the body and excessive grief by sinking or depressing it Thus prostration and kneeling have been employ'd by all nations and in all ages to signify profound veneration Another circumstance still more than uniformity de monstrates these gestures to be natural  viz  their remarkable conformity or resemblance to the passions that produce them  See chap part  Joy which produceth a chearful elevation of mind is expressed by an elevation of body Pride magnanimity courage and the whole tribe of elevating passions are expressed by external gestures that are the same as to the circumstance of elevation however distinguishable in other respects Hence it comes that an erect posture is a sign or expression of dignity  Two of far nobler shape erect and tall  Godlike erect with native honour clad  In naked majesty seem'd lords of all  Paradise Lost book  Grief on the other hand as well as respect which depress the mind cannot for that reason be expressed more significantly than by a similar depression of the body Hence  to be cast down  is a common phrase signifying to be grieved or dispirited  One would not imagine who has not given peculiar attention that the body is susceptible of such a variety of attitude and motion as readily to accompany every different emotion with a corresponding gesture Humility for example is expressed naturally by hanging the head arrogance by its elevation and langour or despondence by reclining it to one side The expressions of the hands are manifold By different attitudes and motions the hands express desire hope fear they assist us in promising in inviting in keeping one at a distance they are made instruments of threatening of supplication of praise and of  horror they are employ'd in approving in refusing in questioning in showing our joy our sorrow our doubts our regret our admiration These gestures so obedient to passion are extremely difficult to be imitated in a calm state The ancients sensible of the advantage as well as difficulty of having these expressions at command bestowed much time and care in collecting them from observation and in digesting them into a practical art which was taught in their schools as an important branch of education  The foregoing signs though in a strict sense voluntary cannot however be restrained but with the utmost difficulty when they are prompted by passion Of this we scarce need a stronger proof than the gestures of a keen player at bowls Observe only how he wreaths his body in order to restore a stray bowl to the right track It is one article of good breeding to suppress as much as possible these external signs of passion that we may not in company appear too warm or too interested The same observation holds in speech A  passion it is true when in extreme is silent  See chap  but when less violent it must be vented in words which have a peculiar force not to be equalled in a sedate composition The ease and trust we have in a confident encourages us no doubt to talk of ourselves and of our feelings But the cause is more general for it operates when we are alone as well as in company Passion is the cause for in many instances it is no slight gratification to vent a passion externally by words as well as by gestures Some passions when at a certain height impel us so strongly to vent them in words that we speak with an audible voice even where there is none to listen It is this circumstance in passion that justifies soliloquies and it is this circumstance that proves them to be natural  Though a soliloquy in the perturbation of passion is undoubtedly natural and indeed not unfrequent in real life yet Congreve who himself has penned several good soliloquies yields with more candor than knowledge that they are unnatural and he only pretends to justify them from necessity This he does in his dedication of the  Double Dealer  in the following words  "When a man in soliloquy reasons with himself and  pro's  and  con's  and weighs all his designs we ought not to imagine that this man either talks to us or to himself he is only thinking and thinking frequently such matter as were inexcuseable folly in him to speak But because we are concealed spectators of the plot in agitation and the poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole mystery of his contrivance he is willing to inform us of this person's thoughts and to that end is forced to make use of the expedient of speech no other better way being yet invented for the communication of thought"  The mind  sometimes favours this impulse of passion by bestowing a temporary sensibility upon any object at hand in order to make it a confident Thus in the  Winter's Tale  Act sc  Antigonus addresses himself to an infant whom he was ordered to expose  Come poor babe  I have heard but not believ'd the spirits of the dead  May walk again if such thing be thy mother  Appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream  So like a waking  The involuntary signs which are all of them natural are either peculiar to one passion or common to many Every violent passion hath an external expression peculiar to itself not excepting pleasant passions witness admiration and mirth The pleasant emotions that are less vivid have one common expression from which we may gather the strength of the emotion but scarce the kind we perceive a chearful or contented look and we can make no more of it Painful passions being all of them violent are distinguishable from each other by their external expressions Thus fear shame anger anxiety dejection despair have each of them peculiar expressions which are apprehended without the least confusion Some of these passions produce violent effects upon the body such as trembling starting and swooning But these effects depending in a good measure upon singularity of constitution are not uniform in all men  The involuntary signs such of them as are display'd upon the countenance are of two kinds Some make their appearance  occasionally with the emotions that produce them and vanish with the emotions others are formed gradually by some violent passion often recurring and becoming permanent signs of this prevailing passion serve to denote the disposition or temper The face of an infant indicates no particular disposition because it cannot be marked with any character to which time is necessary And even the temporary signs are extremely aukward being the first rude essays of Nature to discover internal feelings Thus the shrieking of a newborn infant without tears or sobbings is plainly an attempt to weep Some of the temporary signs as smiling and frowning cannot be observed for some months after birth The permanent signs formed in youth while the body is soft and flexible are preserved entire by the firmness and solidity which the body acquires and are never obliterated even by a change of temper Permanent signs are not produced after a certain age when the fibres become rigid some violent cases excepted such as reiterated fits of the gout or stone through a course of  time But these signs are not so obstinate as what are produced in youth for when the cause is removed they gradually wear away and at last vanish  The natural signs of emotions voluntary and involuntary being nearly the same in all men form an universal language which no distance of place no difference of tribe no diversity of tongue can darken or render doubtful Education though of mighty influence hath not power to vary or sophisticate far less to destroy their signification This is a wise appointment of Providence For if these signs were like words arbitrary and variable it would be an intricate science to decipher the actions and motives of our own species which would prove a great or rather invincible obstruction to the formation of societies But as matters are ordered the external appearances of joy grief anger fear shame and of the other passions forming an universal language open a direct avenue to the heart As the arbitrary signs vary in every country there could be no communication of thoughts among different nations were it not for the  natural signs in which all agree Words are sufficient for the communication of science and of all mental conceptions but the discovering passions instantly as they arise being essential to our wellbeing and often necessary for selfpreservation the author of our nature attentive to our wants hath provided a passage to the heart which never can be obstructed while our external senses remain entire  In an inquiry concerning the external signs of passion actions ought not altogether to be overlooked for though singly they afford no clear light they are upon the whole the best interpreters of the heart  The actions here chiefly in view are what a passion suggests in order to its gratification Beside these actions are occasionally exerted to give some vent to a passion without proposing an ultimate gratification Such occasional action is characteristical of the passion in a high degree and for that reason when happily invented has a wonderful good effect in poetry  Hamlet  Oh most pernicious woman  Oh villain villain smiling damned villain  My tablesmeet it is I set it down  That one may smile and smile and be a villain  At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark  Writing  So uncle there you are  Hamlet act sc  By observing  a man's conduct for a course of time we discover unerringly the various passions that move him to action what he loves and what he hates In our younger years every single action is a mark not at all ambiguous of the temper for in childhood there is little or no disguise The subject becomes more intricate in advanced age but even there dissimulation is seldom carried on for any length of time And thus the conduct of life is the most perfect expression of the internal disposition It merits not indeed the title of an universal language because it is not thoroughly understood but by those who either have a penetrating genius or extensive observation It is a language however which every one can decipher in some measure and which joined with the other external signs affords sufficient means for the direction of our conduct with regard to others If we commit any mistake when such light is afforded it never can be the effect of unavoidable ignorance but of rashness or inadvertence  In reflecting upon the various expressions of our emotions voluntary and involuntary  we must recognise the anxious care of Nature to discover men to each other Strong emotions as above hinted beget an impatience to express them externally by speech and other voluntary signs which cannot be suppressed without a painful effort Thus a sudden fit of passion is a common excuse for indecent behaviour or harsh words As to the involuntary signs these are altogether unavoidable No volition or effort can prevent the shaking of the limbs or a pale visage when one is agitated with a violent fit of terror The blood flies to the face upon a sudden emotion of shame in spite of all opposition  Vergogna che'n altrui stampo natura  Non si puo' rinegar che se tu'tenti  Di cacciarla dal cor fugge nel volto  Pastor Fido act sc  Emotions indeed properly so called which are quiescent produce no remarkable signs externally nor is it necessary that the more deliberate passions should because the operation of such passions is neither sudden nor violent These however remain not altogether  in the dark Being more frequent than violent passion the bulk of our actions are directed by them Actions therefore display with sufficient evidence the more deliberate passions and complete the admirable system of external signs by which we become skilful in human nature  Next in order comes an article of great importance which is to examine the effects produced upon a spectator by external signs of passion None of these signs are beheld with indifference they are productive of various emotions tending all of them to ends wise and good This curious article makes a capital branch of human nature It is peculiarly useful to writers who deal in the pathetic and with respect to historypainters it is altogether indispensable  When we enter upon this article we gather from experience that each passion or class of passions hath its peculiar signs and that these invariably make certain impressions on a spectator The external signs of joy for example produce a chearful emotion the external signs of grief produce pity and the external signs of rage produce a  sort of terror even in those who are not aimed at  Secondly it is natural to think that pleasant passions should express themselves externally by signs that appear agreeable and painful passions by signs that appear disagreeable This conjecture which Nature suggests is confirmed by experience Pride seems to be an exception its external signs being disagreeable though it be commonly reckoned a pleasant passion But pride is not an exception for in reality it is a mixed passion partly pleasant partly painful When a proud man confines his thoughts to himself and to his own dignity or importance the passion is pleasant and its external signs agreeable but as pride chiefly consists in undervaluing or contemning others it is so far painful and its external signs disagreeable  Thirdly it is laid down above that an agreeable object produceth always a pleasant emotion and a disagreeable object one that is painful  See chap part  According to this law the  external signs of a pleasant passion being agreeable must produce in the spectator a pleasant emotion and the external signs of a painful passion being disagreeable must produce in him a painful emotion  Fourthly in the present chapter it is observed that pleasant passions are for the most part expressed externally in one uniform manner and that only the painful passions are distinguishable from each other by their external expressions In the emotions accordingly raised by external signs of pleasant passions there is little variety They are pleasant or chearful and we have not words to reach a more particular description But the external signs of painful passions produce in the spectator emotions of different kinds the emotions for example raised by external signs of grief of remorse of anger of envy of malice are clearly distinguishable from each other  Fifthly emotions raised by the external signs of painful passions are some of them  attractive  some  repulsive  Every painful  passion that is also disagreeable  See passions explained as agreeable or disagreeable chap part  raises by its external signs a repulsive emotion repelling the spectator from the object Thus the emotions raised by external signs of envy and rage are repulsive But this is not the case of painful passions that are agreeable Their external signs it is true are disagreeable and raise in the spectator a painful emotion But this painful emotion is not repulsive On the contrary it is attractive and produceth in the spectator goodwill to the man who is moved by the passion and a desire to relieve or comfort him This cannot be better exemplified than by distress painted on the countenance which instantaneously inspires the spectator with pity and impels him to afford relief The cause of this difference among the painful emotions raised by external signs of passion may be readily gathered from what is laid down chapter Emotions and passions part  It is now time to look back to the question proposed in the beginning How we come to understand external signs so as  readily to ascribe each sign to its proper passion We have seen that this branch of knowledge cannot be derived originally from sight nor from experience Is it then implanted in us by nature The following considerations will help us to answer this question in the affirmative In the first place the external signs of passion must be natural for they are invariably the same in every country and among the different tribes of men Pride for example is always expressed by an erect posture reverence by prostration and sorrow by a dejected look Secondly we are not even indebted to experience for the knowledge that these expressions are natural and universal We are so framed as to have an innate conviction of the fact Let a man change his habitation to the other side of the globe he will from the accustomed signs infer the passion of fear among his new neighbours with as little hesitation as he did at home And upon second thoughts the question may be answered without any preliminaries If the branch of knowledge we have been inquiring about be  not derived from sight nor from experience there is no remaining source from whence it can be derived but from nature  We may then venture to pronounce with some degree of confidence that man is provided by nature with a sense or faculty which lays open to him every passion by means of its external expressions And I imagine that we cannot entertain any reasonable doubt of this fact when we reflect that even infants are not ignorant of the meaning of external signs An infant is remarkably affected with the passions of its nurse expressed on her countenance a smile chears it and a frown makes it afraid Fear thus generated in the infant must like every other passion have an object What is the object of this passion Surely not the frown considered abstractly for a child never abstracts The nurse who frowns is evidently the object Fear at the same time cannot arise but from apprehending danger But what danger can a child apprehend if it be not sensible that the person who frowns is angry We must therefore admit that a child can read anger  in its nurse's face and it must be sensible of this intuitively for it has no other means of knowledge I have no occasion to afsirm that these particulars are clearly apprehended by the child To produce clear and distinct perceptions reflection and experience are requisite But that even an infant when afraid must have some notion of its being in danger is extremely evident  That we should be conscious intuitively of a passion from its external expressions is conformable to the analogy of nature The knowledge of this language is of too great importance to be left upon experience To rest it upon a foundation so uncertain and precarious would prove a great obstacle to the formation of societies Wisely therefore is it ordered and agreeably to the system of Providence that we should have Nature for our instructor  Manifold and admirable are the purposes to which the external signs of passion are made subservient by the author of our nature What are occasionally mentioned  above make but a part Several final causes remain to be unfolded and to this task I apply myself with alacrity In the first place the signs of internal agitation that are displayed externally to every spectator tend to fix the signification of many terms The only effectual means to ascertain the meaning of any doubtful word is an appeal to the thing it represents Hence the ambiguity of words expressive of things that are not objects of external sense for in that case an appeal is denied Passion strictly speaking is not an object of external sense but its external signs are and by means of these signs passions may be appealed to with tolerable accuracy Thus the words that denote our passions next to those that denote external objects have the most distinct meaning Words signifying internal action and the more delicate feelings are less distinct This defect with respect to internal action is what chiefly occasions the intricacy of logic The terms of that science are far from being sufficiently ascertained even after the care and labour  bestowed by an eminent writer  Locke  to whom however the world is greatly indebted for removing a mountain of rubbish and moulding the subject into a rational and correct form The same defect is remarkable in criticism which has for its object the more delicate feelings The terms that denote these feelings are not more distinct than those of logic To reduce this science of criticism to any regular form has never once been attempted However rich the ore may be no critical chymist has been found to give us a regular analysis of its constituent parts and to distinguish each by its own name  In the second place society among individuals is greatly promoted by this universal language The distance and reserve that strangers naturally discover show its utility Looks and gestures give direct access to the heart and lead us to select with tolerable accuracy the persons who may be trusted It is surprising how quickly and  for the most part how correctly we judge of character from external appearances  Thirdly after social intercourse is commenced these external signs contribute above all other means to the strictest union by diffusing through a whole assembly the feelings of each individual Language no doubt is the most comprehensive vehicle for communicating emotions but in expedition as well as in the power of conviction it falls short of the signs under consideration the involuntary signs especially which are incapable of deceit Where the countenance the tones the gestures the actions join with the words in communicating emotions these united have a force irresistible Thus all the agreeable emotions of the human heart with all the social and virtuous affections are by means of these external signs not only perceived but felt By this admirable contrivance social intercourse becomes that lively and animating amusement without which life would at best be insipid One joyful countenance spreads chearfulness instantaneously through a multitude of spectators  Fourthly dissocial passions being hurtful by prompting violence and mischief are noted by the most conspicuous external signs in order to put us upon our guard Thus anger and revenge especially when suddenly provoked display themselves on the countenance in legible characters  Rough and blunt manners are allied to anger by an internal feeling as well as by external expressions resembling in a saint degree those of anger Therefore such manners are easily heightened into anger and savages for that reason are prone to anger Thus rough and blunt manners are unhappy in two respects They are first readily converted into anger and next the change being imperceptible because of the similitude of external signs the person against whom the anger is directed is not put upon his guard It is for these reasons a great object in society to correct such manners and to bring on a habit of sweetness and calmness This temper has two opposite good effects First it is not easily provoked to wrath Next the interval being great betwixt it and real anger a person of this temper who receives an affront has many changes to go through before his anger be inflamed These changes have each of them their external sign and the offending party is put upon his guard to retire or to endeavour a reconciliation  The external signs again of every passion that threatens danger raise in us the passion of fear Nor is this passion occasioned by consciousness of danger though it may be inflamed  by such consciousness It is an instinctive passion which operating without reason or reflection moves us by a sudden impulse to avoid the impending danger  See chap part sect    In the fifth place these external signs are made subservient in a curious manner to the cause of virtue The external signs of a painful passion that is virtuous or innocent and consequently agreeable produce indeed a painful emotion But this emotion is attractive and connects the spectator with the person who suffers Disagreeable passions only are productive of repulsive emotions involving the spectator's aversion and frequently his indignation This artful contrivance makes us cling to the virtuous and abhor the wicked  Sixthly of all the external signs of passion those of affliction or distress are the most illustrious with respect to a final cause and deservedly merit a place of distinction They are illustrious by the singularity of their contrivance and they are still more illustrious by the sympathy they inspire a passion to  which human society is indebted for its greatest blessing that of securing relief in all cases of distress A subject so interesting ought to be examined with leisure and attention The conformity of the nature of man to his external circumstances is in every particular wonderful His nature makes him prone to society and his situation makes it necessary for him In a solitary state he is the most helpless of beings destitute of support and in his manifold distresses destitute of relief Mutual support the shining attribute of society being essential to the wellbeing of man is not left upon reason but is inforced even instinctively by the passion of sympathy Here sympathy makes a capital figure and contributes more than any other means to make life easy and comfortable But however essential sympathy be to comfortable existence one thinking of it beforehand would find difficulty in conjecturing how it could be raised by external signs of distress For considering the analogy of nature if these signs be agreeable they must give birth to a pleasant emotion leading every beholder to be  pleased with human misfortunes If they be disagreeable as they undoubtedly are ought not the painful emotion they produce to repel the spectator from them in order to be relieved from pain Such would be the conjecture in thinking of this matter beforehand and such would be the effect were man purely a selfish being But the benevolence of our nature gives a very different direction to the painful passion of sympathy and to the desire involved in it Far from flying from distress we fly to it in order to afford relief and our sympathy cannot be otherwise gratified than by giving all the succour in our power  See chap part  Thus external signs of distress though disagreeable are attractive and the sympathy they inspire us with is a powerful cause impelling us to afford relief even to a stranger as if he were our friend or bloodrelation  This branch of human nature concerning the external signs of passion is so finely adjusted to answer its end that those who understand it the best will admire it the  most These external signs being all of them resolvable into colour figure and motion should not naturally make any deep impression on a spectator And supposing them qualified for making deep impressions we have seen above that the effects they produce are not what would be expected We cannot therefore account otherwise for the operation of these external signs than by ascribing it to the original constitution of human nature To improve the social state by making us instinctively rejoice with the glad of heart weep with the mourner and shun those who threaten danger is a contrivance illustrious for its wisdom as well as benevolence With respect to the external signs of distress in particular to judge of the excellency of their contrivance we need only reflect upon several other means seemingly more natural that would not have answered the end proposed I am attracted by this amusing speculation and will not ask pardon for indulging in it We shall in the first place reverse the truth by putting the case that the external signs of joy were disagreeable and the external signs of distress  agreeable This is no whimsical supposition for these external signs so far as can be gathered from their nature seem indifferent to the production of pleasure or pain Admitting then the supposition the question is How would our sympathy operate There is no occasion to deliberate for an answer Sympathy upon that supposition would be not less destructive than according to the real case it is beneficial We should be incited to cross the happiness of others if its external signs were disagreeable to us and to augment their distress if its external signs were agreeable I make a second supposition That the external signs of distress were indifferent to us and productive neither of pleasure nor pain This would annihilate the strongest branch of sympathy that which is raised by means of sight And it is evident that reflective sympathy felt by those only who have more than an ordinary share of sensibility would be far from being sufficient to fulfil the ends of the social state I shall approach nearer truth in a third supposition That the external signs of distress being disagreeable were  productive of a painful repulsive emotion Sympathy upon this supposition would not be annihilated but it would be rendered useless For it would be gratified by flying from or avoiding the object instead of clinging to it and affording relief The condition of man would in reality be worse than if sympathy were totally eradicated because sympathy would only serve to plague those who feel it without producing any good to the afflicted  Loath to quit so interesting a subject I add a reflection with which I shall conclude The external signs of passion are a strong indication that man by his very constitution is framed to be open and sincere A child in all things obedient to the impulses of nature hides none of its emotions the savage and clown who have no guide other than pure nature expose their hearts to view by giving way to all the natural signs and even when men learn to dissemble their sentiments and when behaviour degenerates into art there still remain checks which keep dissimulation within bounds and prevent a great part of its mischievous effects  The total suppression of the voluntary signs during any vivid passion begets the utmost uneasiness which cannot be endured for any considerable time This operation becomes indeed less painful by habit but luckily the involuntary signs cannot by any effort be suppressed or even dissembled An absolute hypocrisy by which the character is concealed and a fictitious one assumed is made impracticable and nature has thereby prevented much harm to society We may pronounce therefore that nature herself sincere and candid intends that mankind should preserve the same character by cultivating simplicity and truth and banishing every sort of dissimulation that tends to mischief  CHAP XVI SENTIMENTS  EVERY thought suggested by a passion or emotion is termed  a sentiment  See Appendix    The knowledge of the sentiments peculiar to each passion considered abstractly will not alone enable an artist to make a just representation of nature He ought over and above to be acquainted with the various appearances of the same passion in different persons Passions it is certain receive a tincture from every peculiarity of character and for that reason it rarely happens that any two persons vent their passions precisely in the same manner Hence the following rule concerning dramatic and epic compositions That a passion be adjusted to the character the sentiments to the passion and the language to the sentiments  If nature be not faithfully copied in each of these a defect in execution is perceived There may appear some resemblance but the picture upon the whole will be insipid through want of grace and delicacy A painter in order to represent the various attitudes of the body ought to be intimately acquainted with muscular motion not less intimately acquainted with emotions and characters ought a writer to be in order to represent the various attitudes of the mind A general notion of the passions in their grosser differences of strong and weak elevated and humble severe and gay is far from being sufficient Pictures formed so superficially have little resemblance and no expression And yet it will appear by and by that in many instances our reputed masters are deficient even in this superficial knowledge  In handling the present subject it would be endless to trace even the ordinary passions through their nicer and more minute differences Mine shall be an humbler task which is to select from the best writers instances of faulty sentiments after paving  the way by some general observations  To talk in the language of music each passion hath a certain tone to which every sentiment proceeding from it ought to be tuned with the greatest accuracy This is no easy work especially where such harmony is to be supported during the course of a long theatrical representation In order to reach such delicacy of execution it is necessary that a writer assume the precise character and passion of the personage represented This requires an uncommon genius But it is the only difficulty for the writer who forgetting himself can thus personate another so as to feel truly and distinctly the various agitations of the passion need be in no pain about the sentiments these will flow without the least study or even preconception and will frequently be as delightfully new to himself as afterward to his reader But if a lively picture even of a single emotion require an effort of genius how much greater must the effort be to compose a passionate dialogue in which there are as many different tones of passion as there are speakers With what  ductility of feeling ought a writer to be endued who aims at perfection in such a work when to execute it correctly it is necessary to assume different and even opposite characters and passions in the quickest succession And yet this work difficult as it is yields to that of composing a dialogue in genteel comedy devoid of passion where the sentiments must be tuned to the nicer and more delicate tones of different characters That the latter is the more difficult task appears from considering that a character is greatly more complex than a passion and that passions are more distinguishable from each other than characters are Many writers accordingly who have no genius for characters make a shift to represent tolerably well an ordinary passion in its plain movements But of all works of this kind what is truly the most difficult is a characteristical dialogue upon any philosophical subject To interweave characters with reasoning by adapting to the peculiar character of each speaker a peculiarity not only of thought but of expression requires the perfection of genius taste and judgement  How hard dialoguewriting is will be evident even without reasoning from the imperfect compositions of this kind found without number in all languages The art of mimicking any singularity in voice or gesture is a rare talent though directed by sight and hearing the acutest and most lively of our external senses how much more rare must the talent be of imitating characters and internal emotions tracing all their different tints and representing them in a lively manner by natural sentiments properly expressed The truth is such execution is too delicate for an ordinary genius and for that reason the bulk of writers instead of expressing a passion like one who is under its power content themselves with describing it like a spectator To awake passion by an internal effort merely without any external cause requires great sensibility and yet this operation is necessary not less to the writer than to the actor because none but they who actually feel a passion can represent it to the life The writer's part is much more complicated he must join composition  with action and in the quickest succession be able to adopt every different character introduced in his work But a very humble flight of imagination may serve to convert a writer into a spectator so as to figure in some obscure manner an action as passing in his sight and hearing In this figured situation he is led naturally to describe as a spectator and at second hand to entertain his readers with his own observations with cool description and florid declamation instead of making them eyewitnesses as it were to a real event and to every movement of genuine passion  In the  Aeneid  the hero is made to describe himself in the following words  Sum pius Aeneas    fama super aethera notus  Virgil could never have been guilty of an impropriety so gross had he assumed the personage of his hero instead of uttering the sentiments of a spectator Nor would Xenophon have made the following speech for Cyrus the younger to his Grecian auxiliaries whom he was leading against his brother Artaxerxes  "I have chosen you O Greeks my auxiliaries not to enlarge my army for I have  Barbarians  without number but because you surpass all the  Barbarians  in valour and military discipline"  This sentiment is Xenophon's for surely Cyrus did not reckon his countrymen Barbarians  Thus in the bulk of plays a  tiresome monotony prevails a pompous declamatory style without entering into different characters or passions  This descriptive manner of expressing passion has a very unhappy effect Our sympathy is not raised by description we must be lulled first into a dream of reality and every thing must appear as actually present and passing in our sight  See chap part sect  Unhappy is the player of genius who acts a capital part in what may be termed a  descriptive tragedy  After he has assumed the very passion that is to be represented how must he be cramped in his action when he is forced to utter not the sentiments of the passion he feels but a cold description in the language of a bystander It is this imperfection I am persuaded in the bulk of our plays that confines our stage almost entirely to Shakespear his many irregularities notwithstanding In our latest English tragedies we sometimes find sentiments tolerably well adapted to a plain passion But it would be fruitless labour to  search in any of them for a sentiment expressive of character and upon that very account all our modern performances of the dramatic kind are intolerably insipid  Looking back upon the foregoing observation I am uncertain whether it will be sufficiently apprehended for upon this complicated subject I find some difficulty to express myself with perspicuity I despair not however to place this matter in the clearest light by adding example to precept In the front shall be set one or two examples of sentiments that appear the legitimate offspring of passion and to them shall be opposed a few others that are descriptive only and illegitimate In making this comparison I shall borrow my instances from Shakespear and Corneille who for genius in dramatic composition stand uppermost in the rolls of fame  Shakespear shall furnish the first instance being of sentiments dictated by a violent and perturbed passion  Lear  Filial ingratitude  Is it not as if this mouth should tear this hand  For lifting food to'tBut I'll punish home  No I will weep no moreIn such a night  To shut me outPour on I will endure  In such a night as this O Regan Gonerill  Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all  O that way madness lies let me shun that  No more of that  Kent  Good my Lord enter here  Lear  Pr'ythee go in thy thyself seek thine own ease  This tempest will not give me leave to ponder  On things would hurt me morebut I'll go in  In boy go first You houseless poverty  Nay get thee in I'll pray and then I'll sleep  Poor naked wretches wheresoe'er you are  That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm  How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides  Your loop'd and window'd raggedness defend you  From seasons such as theseO I have ta'en  Too little care of this take physic Pomp  Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel  That thou may'st shake the superflux to them  And show the heavens more just  King Lear act sc  To illustrate the foregoing doctrine one other instance of the same kind may suffice  expressing sentiments arising from remorse and despair  Othello  Lo I have a weapon  A better never did itself sustain  Upon a soldier's thigh I've seen the day  That with this little arm and this good sword  I've made my way through more impediments  Than twenty times your stop But oh vain boast  Who can controul his fate 'tis not so now  Be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd  Here is my journey's end here is my butt  The very sea mark of my outmost sail  Do you go back dismay'd 'tis a lost fear  Man but a rush against Othello's breast  And he retires Where should Othello go  Nowhow dost thou look now Oh illstarr'd wench  Pale as thy smoke when we shall meet at compt  This look of thine will hurl my soul from heav'n  And fiends will snatch at it Cold cold my girl  Ev'n like thy chastity O cursed slave  Whip me ye devils  From the possession of this heav'nly sight  Blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur  Wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire  Oh Desdemona Desdemona dead dead oh oh  Othello act sc  The sentiments here display'd flow so naturally from the passions represented and are such genuine expressions of these passions that it is not possible to conceive any imitation more perfect  With regard to the French author truth obliges me to acknowledge that he describes in the style of a spectator instead of expressing passion like one who feels it and also that he is thereby betray'd into the other faults above mentioned a tiresome monotony and a pompous declamatory style  This criticism reaches the French dramatic writers in general with very few exceptions Their tragedies are mostly if not totally descriptive Corneille led the way and later writers following his track have accustomed the French ear to a style formal pompous declamatory which suits not with any passion Hence it becomes an easy task to burlesk a French tragedy it is not more difficult than to burlesk a stiff solemn fop The facility of the operation has in Paris introduced a singular amusement which is to burlesk the more successful tragedies in a sort of farce called  a parody  La Motte who himself appears to have been sorely galled by some of these burlesk compositions acknowledges that no more is necessary to give them a run than barely to vary the  dramatis personae  and in place of kings and heroes queens and princesses to substitute tinkers and tailors milkmaids and seamstresses The declamatory style so different from the genuine expression of passion passes in some measure unobserved when great personages are the speakers But in the mouths of the vulgar the impropriety with regard to the speaker as well as to the passion represented is so remarkable as to become ridiculous A tragedy where every passion is made to speak in its natural tone is not liable to be thus burlesked The same passion is by all men expressed nearly in the same manner and therefore the genuine expressions of passion cannot be ridiculous in the mouth of any man provided only he be of such a character as to be susceptible of the passion  It is a wellknown fact that to an English ear the French actors appear to pronounce with too great rapidity a complaint much insisted on by Cibber in particular who had frequently heard the famous Baron upon the French stage This may in some measure be attributed to our want of facility in the French language as foreigners generally imagine that every language is pronounced too quick by natives But that it is not the sole cause will be probable from a fact directly opposite that the French are not a little disgusted with the languidness as they term it of the English pronunciation I conjecture this difference of taste may be derived from what is observed above The pronunciation of the genuine language of passion is necessarily directed by the nature of the passion and by the slowness or celerity of its progress In particular plaintive passions which are the most frequent in tragedy having a slow motion dictate a slow pronunciation In declamation again which is not the genuine language of any passion the speaker warms gradually and as he warms he naturally accelerates his pronunciation But as the French have formed their tone of pronunciation upon Corneille's declamatory tragedies and the English upon the more natural language of Shakespear it is not surprising that custom should produce such difference of taste in the two nations  It is scarce necessary to produce  particular instances for he never varies from this tone I shall however take two passages at a venture in order to be  confronted with those transcribed above In the tragedy of  Cinna  Aemilia after the conspiracy was discovered having nothing in view but racks and death to herself and her lover receives a pardon from Augustus attended with the brightest circumstances of magnanimity and tenderness This is a happy situation for representing the passions of surprise and gratitude in their different stages These passions raised at once to the utmost pitch are at first too big for utterance and Aemilia's feelings must for some moments have been expressed by violent gestures only So soon as there is a vent for words the  first expressions are naturally broken and interrupted At last we ought to expect a tide of intermingled sentiments occasioned by the fluctuation of the mind betwixt the two passions Aemilia is made to behave in a very different manner With extreme coolness she describes her own situation as if she were merely a spectator or rather the poet takes the task off her hands  Et je me rens Seigneur à ces hautes bontés  Je recouvre la vûe auprés de leurs clartés  Je connois mon forfait qui me sembloit justice  Et ce que n'avoit pû la terreur du supplice  Je sens naitre en mon ame un repentir puissant  Et mon coeur en secret me dit qu'il y consent  Le ciel a résolu votre grandeur suprême  Et pour preuve Seigneur je n'en veux que moimême  J'ose avec vanité me donner cet éclat  Puisqu'il change mon coeur qu'il veut changer l'état  Ma haine va mourir que j'ai crue immortelle  Elle est morte et ce coeur devient sujet fidéle  Et prenant désormais cette haine en horreur  L'ardeur de vous servir succede à sa fureur  Act sc  In the tragedy of  Sertorius  the Queen surprised with the news that her lover was assassinated instead of venting any passion degenerates into a cool spectator even so much as to instruct the bystanders how a queen ought to behave on such an occasion  Viriate  Il m'en fait voir ensemble et l'auteur et la cause  Par cet assassinat c'est de moi qu'on dispose  C'est mon trône c'st moi qu'on pretend conquerir  Et c'est mon juste choix qui seul l'a fait perir  Madame aprés sa perte et parmi ces alarmes  N'attendez point de moi de soupirs ni de larmes  Ce sont amusemens que dédaigne aisement  Le prompt et noble orgueil d'un vif ressentiment  Qui pleure l'affoiblit qui soupire l'exhale  Il saut plus de fierté dans une ame royale  Et ma douleur soumise aux soins de le venger  c  Act sc  So much in general upon the genuine sentiments of passion I proceed now to particular observations And first Passions are seldom uniform for any considerable time they generally fluctuate swelling and subsiding by turns often in a quick  succession  See chap part  This fluctuation in the case of a real passion will be expressed externally by proper sentiments and ought to be imitated in writing and acting Accordingly a climax shows never better than in expressing a swelling passion The following passages shall suffice for an illustration  Oroonoko  Can you raise the dead  Pursue and overtake the wings of time  And bring about again the hours the days  The years that made me happy  Oroonoko act sc  Almeria  How hast thou charm'd  The wildness of the waves and rocks to this  That thus relenting they have giv'n thee back  To earth to light and life to love and me  Mourning Bride act sc  I would not be the villain that thou think'st  For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp  And the rich earth to boot  Macbeth act sc  The following passage expresses finely the progress of conviction  Let me not stir nor breathe lest I dissolve  That tender lovely form of painted air  So like Almeria Ha it sinks it falls  I'll catch it ere it goes and grasp her shade  'Tis life 'tis warm 'tis she 'tis she herself  It is Almeria 'tis it is my wife  Mourning Bride act sc  In the progress of thought our resolutions become more vigorous as well as our passions  If ever I do yield or give consent  By any action word or thought to wed  Another Lord may then just Heav'n show'r down  c  Mourning Bride act sc  And this leads to a second observation That the different stages of a passion and its different directions from its birth to its extinction ought to be carefully represented in the sentiments which otherwise will often be misplaced Resentment for example when provoked by an atrocious injury discharges itself first upon the  author Sentiments therefore of revenge take place of all others and must in some measure be exhausted before the person injured think of pitying himself or of grieving for his present distress In the  Cid  of Corneille Don Diegue having been affronted in a cruel manner expresses scarce any sentiment of revenge but is totally occupied in contemplating the low situation to which he was reduced by the affront  O rage ô desespoir ô vieillesse ennemie  N'ai je donc tant vecu que pour cette infamie  Et ne suisje blanchi dans les travaux guerriers  Que pour voir en une jour fletrir tant de lauriers  Mon bras qu'avec respect toute l'Espagne admire  Mon bras qui tant de fois a sauvé cet empire  Tant de fois affermi le trône de son roi  Trahit donc ma querelle et ne fait rien pour moi  O cruel souvenir de ma gloire passée  Oeuvre de tant de jours en un jour effacée  Nouvelle dignité fatale à mon bonheur  Precipice élevé d'ou tombe mon honneur  Fautil de votre éclat voir triompher le Comte  Et mourir sans vengeance ou vivre dans la honte  Comte sois de mon Prince à present gouverneur  Ce haut rang n'admet point un homme sans honneur  Et ton jaloux orgueil par cet affront insigne  Malgré le choix du Roi m'en a sû rendre indigne  Et toi de mes exploits glorieux instrument  Mais d'un corps tout de glace inutile ornement  Fer jadis tant à craindre et qui dans cette offense  M'as servi de parade et non pas de defense  Va quitte desormais le dernier des humains  Passe pour me vanger en de meilleures mains  Le Cid act sc  These sentiments are certainly not what occur to the mind in the first movements of the passion In the same manner as in resentment the first movements of grief are always directed upon its object Yet with relation to the sudden and severe distemper that seized Alexander bathing in the river Cydnus Quintus Curtius describes the first emotions of the army as directed upon themselves lamenting that they were left without a leader far from home and had scarce any hopes of returning in safety Their King's distress which must naturally have been their first concern occupies them but in the second place according to that author In the  Aminta  of Tasso Sylvia upon a report of her lover's death which she believed certain instead of bemoaning the loss of a beloved object turns her  thoughts upon herself and wonders her heart does not break  Ohime ben son di sasso  Poi che questa novella non m'uccide  Act sc  In the tragedy of  Jane Shore  Alicia in the full purpose of destroying her rival has the following reflection  Oh Jealousy thou bane of pleasing friendship  Thou worst invader of our tender bosoms  How does thy rancour poison all our softness  And turn our gentle natures into bitterness  See where she comes Once my heart's dearest blessing  Now my chang'd eyes are blasted with her beauty  Loathe that known face and sicken to behold her  Act sc  These are the reflections of a cool spectator A passion while it has the ascendant and is freely indulged suggests not to the man who feels it any sentiment to its own prejudice Reflections like the foregoing occur not to him readily till the passion have spent its vigor  A person sometimes is agitated at once by different passions The mind in this case vibrating like a pendulum vents itself in sentiments which partake of the same vibration This I give as a third observation  Queen  'Would I had never trod this English earth  Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it  Ye've angels faces but Heav'n knows your hearts  What shall become of me now wretched lady  I am the most unhappy woman living  Alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes  To her women  Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom where no pity  No friends no hope no kindred weep for me  Almost no grave allow'd me  Henry VIII act sc  Othello  Oh devil devil  If that the earth could teem with woman's tears  Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile  Out of my sight  Desdemona  I will not stay t' offend you  going  Lodovico  Truly an obedient lady  I do beseech your Lordship call her back  Oth  Mistress  Des  My Lord  Oth  What would you with her Sir  Lod  Who I my Lord  Oth  Ay you did wish that I would make her turn  Sir she can turn and turn and yet go on  And turn again And she can weep Sir weep  And she's obedient as you say obedient  Very obedientproceed you in your tears  Concerning this Siroh wellpainted passion  I am commanded homeget you away  I'll send for you anonSir I obey the mandate  And will return to VeniceHence avaunt  Exit Desaemona  Othello act sc  Aemilia  Oh my good Lord I would speak a word with you  Othello  Yes 'tis Aemiliaby and byshe's dead  'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death  The noise was highHa no more moving  Still as the grave Shall she come in were't good  I think she stirs againNowhat's the best  If she come in she'll sure speak to my wife  My wife my wife What wife I have no wife  Oh insupportable oh heavy hour  Othello act sc  A fourth observation is that nature which gave us passions and made them extremely beneficial when moderate intended undoubtedly that they should be subjected to the government of reason and conscience  See chap part  It is therefore against the order of nature that passion in any case should take the lead in contradiction to reason and conscience Such a state of mind is a sort of anarchy which every one is ashamed of and endeavours to hide or dissemble Even love however laudable is attended with a conscious shame when it becomes immoderate it is covered from the world and disclosed only to the beloved object  Et que l'amour souvent de remors combattu  Paroisse une foiblesse et non une vertu  Boileau L'art poet chant l  O they love least that let men know their love  Two Gentlemen of Verona act sc  Hence a capital rule in the representation of strong passions that their genuine sentiments  ought to be hid or dissembled as much as possible And this holds in an especial manner with respect to criminal passions One never counsels the commission of a crime in plain terms Guilt must not appear in its native colours even in thought the proposal must be made by hints and by representing the action in some favourable light Of the propriety of sentiment upon such an occasion Shakespear in the  Tempest  has given us a beautiful example The subject is a proposal made by the usurping Duke of Milan to Sebastian to murder his brother the King of Naples  Antonio  What might  Worthy SebastianO what mightno more  And yet methinks I see it in thy face  What thou should'st be th'occasion speaks thee and  My strong imagination sees a crown  Dropping upon thy head  Act sc  There cannot be a finer picture of this sort than that of King John soliciting Hubert to murder the young Prince Arthur  K John  Come hither Hubert O my gentle Hubert  We owe thee much within this wall of flesh  There is a soul counts thee her creditor  And with advantage means to pay thy love  And my good friend thy voluntary oath  Lives in this bosom dearly cherished  Give me thy hand I had a thing to say  But I will fit it with some better time  By Heaven Hubert I'm almost asham'd  To say what good respect I have of thee  Hubert  I am much bounden to your Majesty  K John  Good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet  But thou shalt haveand creep time ne'er so slow  Yet it shall come for me to do thee good  I had a thing to saybut let it go  The sun is in the heav'n and the proud day  Attended with the pleasures of the world  Is all too wanton and too full of gawds  To give me audience If the midnightbell  Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth  Sound one into the drowsy race of night  If this same were a churchyard where we stand  And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs  Or if that surly spirit Melancholy  Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavythick  Which else runs tickling up and down the veins  Making that idiot Laughter keep men's eyes  And strain their cheeks to idle merriment  A passion hateful to my purposes  Or if that thou could'st see me without eyes  Hear me without thine ears and make reply  Without a tongue using conceit alone  Without eyes ears and harmful sounds of words  Then in despight of broadey'd watchful day  I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts  But ah I will notYet I love thee well  And by my troth I think thou lov'st me well  Hubert  So well that what you bid me undertake  Though that my death were adjunct to my act  By Heav'n I'd do't  K John  Do not I know thou would'st  Good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye  On you young boy I'll tell thee what my friend  He is a very serpent in my way  And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread  He lies before me Dost thou understand me  Thou art his keeper  King John act sc  As things are best illustrated by their contraries I proceed to collect from classical authors sentiments that appear faulty The first class shall consist of sentiments that  accord not with the passion or in other words sentiments that the passion represented does not naturally suggest In the second class shall be ranged sentiments that may belong to an ordinary passion but unsuitable to it as tinctured by a singular character Thoughts that properly are not sentiments but rather descriptions make a third Sentiments that belong to the passion represented but are faulty as being introduced too early or too late make a fourth Vicious sentiments exposed in their native dress instead of being concealed or disguised make a fifth And in the last class shall be collected sentiments suited to no character or passion and therefore unnatural  The first class contains faulty sentiments of various kinds which I shall endeavour to distinguish from each other And first sentiments that are faulty by being above the tone of the passion  Othello  O my soul's joy  If after every tempest come such calms  May the winds blow till they have waken'd death  And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas  Olympus high and duck again as low  As hell's from heaven  Othello act sc  This sentiment is too strong to be suggested by so slight a joy as that of meeting after a storm at sea  Philaster  Place me some god upon a pyramid  Higher than hills of earth and lend a voice  Loud as your thunder to me that from thence  I may discourse to all the underworld  The worth that dwells in him  Philaster of Beaumont and Fletcher act  Secondly Sentiments below the tone of the passion Ptolemy by putting Pompey to death having incurred the displeasure of Caesar was in the utmost dread of being dethroned In this agitating situation Corneille makes him utter a speech full of cool reflection that is in no degree expressive of the passion  Ah si je t'avois crû je n'aurois pas de maître  Je serois dans le trône où le Ciel m'a fait naître  Mais c'est une imprudence assez commune aux rois  D'ecouter trop d'avis et se tromper au choix  Le Destin les aveugle au bord du précipice  Ou si quelque lumiere en leur ame se glisse  Cette fausse clarté dont il les eblouit  Le plonge dans une gouffre et puis s'evanouit  La mort de Pompée act sc  In  Les Freres ennemies  of Racine the second act is opened with a lovescene Hemon talks to his mistress of the torments of absence of the lustre of her eyes that he ought to die no where but at her feet and that one moment of absence was a thousand years Antigone on her part acts the coquette and pretends she must be gone to wait on her mother and brother and cannot stay to listen to his courtship This is odious French gallantry below the dignity of the passion of love It would scarce be excusable in painting modern French manners and is insufferable where the ancients are brought upon the stage The manners painted in the  Alexandre  of the same author are not more just French gallantry prevails there throughout  Third Sentiments that agree not with the tone of the passion as where a pleasant sentiment  is grafted upon a painful passion or the contrary In the following instances the sentiments are too gay for a serious passion  No happier task these faded eyes pursue  To read and weep is all they now can do  Eloisa to Abelard l  Again  Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid  Some banish'd lover or some captive maid  They live they speak they breathe what love inspires  Warm from the soul and faithful to its fires  The virgin's wish without her fears impart  Excuse the blush and pour out all the heart  Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul  And waft a sigh from Indus to the pole  Eloisa to Abelard l  These thoughts are pretty they suit Pope extremely but not Eloisa  Satan enraged by a threatening of the angel Gabriel answers thus  Then when I am thy captive talk of chains  Proud limitary cherub but ere then  Far heavier load thyself expect to feel  From my prevailing arm though Heaven's King  Ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers  Us'd to the yoke draw'st his triumphant wheels  In progress through the road of heav'n  starpav'd  Paradise Lost book  The concluding epithet forms a grand and delightful image which cannot be the genuine offspring of rage  Fourth Sentiments too artificial for a serious passion I give for the first example a speech of Piercy expiring  O Harry thou hast robb'd me of my growth  I better brook the loss of brittle life  Than those proud titles thou hast won of me  They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh  But thought's the slave of life and life time's fool  And time that takes survey of all the world  Must have a stop  First part Henry IV act sc  Livy inserts the following passage in a plaintive oration of the Locrenses accusing Pleminius the Roman legate of oppression  "In hoc legato vestro nec hominis quicquam est Patres Conscripti praeter figuram et speciem neque Romani civis praeter habitum vestitumque et sonum linguae Latinae Pestis et bellua immanis quales fretum quondam quo ab Sicilia dividimur ad perniciem navigantium circumsedisse fabulae ferunt  Titus Livius l §  "  Congreve shows a fine taste in the sentiments of the  Mourning Bride  But in the following passage the picture is too artful to be suggested by severe grief  Almeria  O no Time gives increase to my afflictions  The circling hours that gather all the woes  Which are diffus'd through the revolving year  Come heavyladen with th' oppressing weight  To me with me successively they leave  The sighs the tears the groans the restless cares  And all the damps of grief that did retard their flight  They shake their downy wings and scatter all  The dire collected dews on my poor head  Then fly with joy and swiftness from me  Act sc  In the same play Almeria seeing a dead body which she took to be Alphonso's expresses sentiments strained and artificial which nature suggests not to any person upon such an occasion  Had they or hearts or eyes that did this deed  Could eyes endure to guide such cruel hands  Are not my eyes guilty alike with theirs  That thus can gaze and yet not turn to stone  I do not weep The springs of tears are dry'd  And of a sudden I am calm as if  All things were well and yet my husband's murder'd  Yes yes I know to mourn I'll sluice this heart  The source of wo and let the torrent loose  Act sc  Lady Trueman  How could you be so cruel to defer giving me that joy which you knew I must receive from your presence You have robb'd my life of some hours of happiness that ought to have been in it  Drummer act  Pope's Elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady expresses delicately the most tender concern and sorrow for the deplorable  fate of a person of worth A poem of this kind deeply serious and pathetic rejects all fiction with disdain We therefore can give no quarter to the following passage which is eminently discordant with the subject It is not the language of the heart but of the imagination indulging its flights at ease It would be a still more severe censure if it should be ascribed to imitation copying indiscreetly what has been said by others  What though no weeping loves thy ashes grace  Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face  What though no sacred earth allow thee room  Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb  Yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest  And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast  There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow  There the first roses of the year shall blow  While angels with their silver wings o'ershade  The ground now sacred by thy reliques made  Fifth Fanciful or finical sentiments sentiments that degenerate into point or conceit however they may amuse in an idle hour can never be the offspring of any serious or important passion In the  Ierusalem  of Tasso Tancred after a single combat spent with fatigue and loss of blood falls into a swoon In this situation understood to be dead he is discovered by Erminia who was in love with him to distraction A more happy situation cannot be imagined to raise grief in an instant to its highest pitch and yet in venting her sorrow she descends most abominably to antithesis and conceit even of the lowest kind  E in lui versò d'inessicabil vena  Lacrime e voce di sospiri mista  In che misero punto hor qui me mena  Fortuna a che veduta amara e trista  Dopo gran tempo i' ti ritrovo à pena  Tancredi e ti riveggio e non son vista  Vista non son da te benche presente  E trovando ti perdo eternamente  Cant st  Armida's lamentation respecting her lover Rinaldo  Canto stan  is in the same vitious taste  Queen  Give me no help in lamentation  I am not barren to bring forth complaints  All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes  That I being govern'd by the wat'ry moon  May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world  Ah for my husband for my dear Lord Edward  King Richard III act sc  Jane Shore  Let me be branded for the public scorn  Turn'd forth and driven to wander like a vagabond  Be friendless and forsaken seek my bread  Upon the barren wild and desolate waste  Feed on my sighs    and drink my falling tears    Ere I consent to teach my lips injustice  Or wrong the orphan who has none to save him  Jane Shore act  Give me your drops ye softdescending rains  Give me your streams ye neverceasing springs  That my sad eyes may still supply my duty  And feed an everlasting flood of sorrow  Jane Shore act  Jane Shore utters her last breath in a witty conceit  Then all is well and I shall sleep in peace  'Tis very dark and I have lost you now  Was there not something I would have bequeath'd you  But I have nothing left me to bestow  Nothing but one sad sigh Oh mercy Heav'n  Dies  Act  Gilford to Lady Jane Gray when both were condemned to die  Thou stand'st unmov'd  Calm temper sits upon thy beauteous brow  Thy eyes that flow'd so fast for Edward's loss  Gaze unconcern'd upon the ruin round thee  As if thou hadst resolv'd to brave thy fate  And triumph in the midst of desolation  Ha see it swells the liquid crystal rises  It starts in spight of theebut I will catch it  Nor let the earth be wet with dew so rich  Lady Jane Gray act near the end  The concluding sentiment is altogether finical unsuitable to the importance of the occasion and even to the dignity of the passion of love  Corneille in his  Examen of the Cid  Page  answering  an objection that his sentiments are sometimes too much refined for persons in deep distress observes that if poets did not indulge sentiments more ingenious or refined than are prompted by passion their performances would often be low and extreme grief would never suggest but exclamations merely This is in plain language to assert That forced thoughts are more relished than such as are natural and therefore ought to be preferred  The second class is of sentiments that may belong to an ordinary passion but are not perfectly concordant with it as tinctured by a singular character In the last act of that excellent comedy  The Careless Husband  Lady Easy upon Sir Charles's reformation is made to express more violent and turbulent sentiments of joy than are consistent with the mildness of her character  Lady Easy  O the soft treasure O the dear reward of longdesiring loveThus thus to have you mine is something more than happiness 'tis double life and madness of abounding joy  If the sentiments of a passion ought to be suited to a peculiar character it is still more necessary that sentiments devoid of passion be suited to the character In the th act of the  Drummer  Addison makes his gardener act even below the character of an ignorant credulous rustic he gives him the behaviour of a gaping idiot  The following instances are descriptions rather than sentiments which compose a third class  Of this descriptive manner of painting the passions there is in the  Hippolytus  of Euripides act an illustrious instance  viz  the speech of Theseus upon hearing of his son's dismal exit In Racine's tragedy of  Esther  the Queen hearing of the decree issued against her people instead of expressing sentiments suitable to the occasion turns her attention upon herself and describes with accuracy her own situation  Juste Ciel Tout mon sang dans mes veines se glace  Act sc  Again  Aman  C'en est fait Mon orgueil est forcé de plier  L'inexorable Aman est reduit a prier  Esther act sc  Athalie  Quel prodige nouveau me trouble et m'embarrasse  La douceur de sa voix son enfance sa grace  Font insensiblement à mon inimitié  SuccéderJe serois sensible a la pitié  Athalie act sc  Titus  O de ma passion fureur desesperée  Brutus of Voltaire act sc  What other are the foregoing instances than describing the passion another feels  An example is given above of remorse and despair expressed by genuine and natural sentiments In the fourth book of  Paradise Lost  Satan is made to express his remorse and despair in sentiments which though beautiful are not altogether natural They are rather the sentiments of a spectator than of a person who actually is tormented with these passions  The fourth class is of sentiments introduced too early or too late  Some examples mentioned above belong to this class Add the following from  Venice preserv'd  act at the close of the scene betwixt Belvidera and her father Priuli The account given by Belvidera of the danger she was in and of her husband's threatening to murder her ought naturally to have alarmed her relenting father and to have made him express the most perturbed sentiments Instead of which he dissolves into tenderness and love for his daughter as if he had already delivered her from danger and as if there were a perfect tranquillity  Canst thou forgive me all my follies past  I'll henceforth be indeed a father never  Never more thus expose but cherish thee  Dear as the vital warmth that feeds my life  Dear as these eyes that weep in fondness o'er thee  Peace to thy heart  Immoral sentiments exposed in their native  colours instead of being concealed or disguised compose the fifth class  The Lady Macbeth projecting the death of the King has the following soliloquy  The raven himself's not hoarse  That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan  Under my battlements Come all you spirits  That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here  And fill me from the crown to th' toe topfull  Of direct cruelty make thick my blood  Stop up th' access and passage to remorse  That no compunctious visitings of nature  Shake my fell purpose  Macbeth act sc  This speech is not natural Murder under trust was never perpetrated even by the most hardened miscreant without compunction And that the lady here must have been in horrible agitation appears from her invoking the infernal spirits to fill her with cruelty and to stop up all avenues to remorse But in this state of mind it is a neverfailing device of selfdeceit to draw the thickest veil over the wicked action and to extenuate it by all circumstances that imagination  can suggest And if the crime cannot bear disguise the next attempt is to thrust it out of mind altogether and to rush on to action without thought This last was the husband's method  Strange things I have in head that will to hand  Which must be acted ere they must be scann'd  Act sc  The lady follows neither of these courses but in a deliberate manner endeavours to fortify her heart in the commission of an execrable crime without even attempting a disguise This I think is not natural I hope there is no such wretch to be found as is here represented In the  Pompey  of Corneille  Act sc  Photine counsels a wicked action in the plainest terms without disguise  Seigneur n'attirez point le tonnerre en ces lieux  Rangezvous du parti des destins et des dieux  Et sans les accuser d'injustice ou d'outrage  Puis qu'ils font les heureux adorez leur ouvrage  Quels que soient leurs decrets déclarezvouz pour eux  Et pour leur obéir perdez le malheureux  Pressé de toutes parts des coléres celestes  Il en vient dessus vous faire fondre les restes  Et sa tête qu'à peine il a pû dérober  Tout prête de choir cherche avec qui tomber  Sa retraite chez vous en effet n'est qu'un crime  Elle marque sa haine et non pas son estime  Il ne vient que vous perdre en venant prendre port  Et vous pouvez douter s'il est digne de mort  Il devoit mieux remplir nos voeux et notre attente  Faire voir sur ses nefs la victoire flotante  Il n'eût ici trouvé que joye et que festins  Mais puisqu'il est vaincu qu'il s'en prenne aux destins  J'en veux à sa disgrace et non à sa personne  J'exécute à regret ce que le ciel ordonne  Et du même poignard pour César destiné  Je perce en soupirant son coeur infortuné  Vouz ne pouvez enfin qu'aux dépens de sa tête  Mettre à l'abri la vôtre et parer la tempête  Laissez nommer sa mort un injuste attentat  La justice n'est pas une vertu d'etat  Le choix des actions ou mauvaises ou bonnes  Ne fait qu'anéantir la force des couronnes  Le droit des rois consiste à ne rien épargner  La timide équité détruit l'art de regner  Quand on craint d'être injuste on a toûjours à craindre  Et qui veut tout pouvoir doit oser tout enfraindre  Fuir comme un deshonneur la vertu qui le pert  Et voler sans scrupule au crime qui lui sert  In the tragedy of  Esther  Act sc  Haman acknowledges without disguise his cruelty insolence and pride And there is another example of the same kind in the  Agamemnon  of Seneca  Beginning of act  In the tragedy of  Athalie  Act sc at the close  Mathan in cool blood relates to his friend many black crimes he had been guilty of to satisfy his ambition  In Congreve's  Doubledealer  Maskwell instead of disguising or colouring his crimes values himself upon them in a soliloquy  Cynthia let thy beauty gild my crimes and whatsoever I commit of treachery or deceit shall be imputed to me as a meritTreachery what treachery Love cancels all the bonds of friendship and sets men right upon their first foundations  Act sc  In French plays love instead of being hid or disguised is treated as a serious concern and of greater importance than fortune family or dignity I suspect the reason to be that in the capital of France love by the easiness of intercourse has dwindled down from a real passion to be a connection that is regulated entirely by the mode or fashion  A certain author says humourously  "Les mots mêmes d'amour et d'amant sont bannis de l'intime société des deux sexes et relegués avec ceux de  chaine  et de  flame  dans les Romans qu'on ne lit plus"  And where nature is once banished a fair field is open to every santastic imitation even the most extravagant  This may in some measure excuse their writers but will never make their plays be relished among foreigners  Maxime  Quoi trahir mon ami  Euphorbe  L'amour rend

flâme elle fait obtenir  C'est elle dont je tiens cette haute espérance  Qui flate mes desirs d'une illustre apparence  Et fait croire à Cesar qu'il peut former de voeux  Qu'il n'est pas toutàfait

vôtre  Qu'il en estime l'un et me permette l'autre  Pompée act sc  The last class comprehends sentiments that are unnatural as being suited to no character nor passion These may be subdivided into three branches first sentiments unsuitable to the constitution of man and the laws of his nature second inconsistent sentiments third sentiments that are pure rant and extravagance  When the fable is of human affairs every event every incident and every circumstance ought to be natural otherwise the imitation is imperfect But an imperfect  imitation is a venial fault compared with that of running cross to nature In the  Hippolytus  of Euripides  Act sc  Hippolytus wishing for another self in his own situation How much says he should I be touched with his misfortune as if it were natural to

communicate our opinions our emotions and every thing that affects us is remarkable Bad fortune and injustice affect every one greatly and of these we are so prone to complain that if we have no friend or acquaintance to take part in our sufferings we sometimes utter our complaints aloud even where there are none to listen  But this propensity though natural operates not in every state of mind A man immoderately grieved seeks to afflict himself and selfaffliction is the gratification of the passion Immoderate grief is therefore mute because complaining is struggling for relief  It is the wretch's comfort still to have  Some small reserve of near and inward wo  Some unsuspected hoard of inward grief  Which they unseen may wail and weep and mourn  And gluttonlike alone devour  Mourning Bride act sc  When grief subsides it then and no sooner finds a tongue We complain because complaining is an effort to disburden the mind of its distress  This observation is finely illustrated by a story which Herodotus records  book  Cambyses when he conquered Egypt took Psammenitus the King prisoner and to try his constancy ordered his daughter to be dressed in the habit of a slave and to be employ'd in bringing water from the river His son also was led to execution with a halter about his neck The Egyptians vented their sorrow in tears and lamentations Psammenitus only with a downcast eye remained silent Afterward meeting one of his companions a man advanced in years who being plundered of all was begging alms he wept bitterly calling him by his name Cambyses was struck with wonder and sent a messenger with the following question  "Psammenitus thy master Cambyses is desirous to know why after thou hadst seen thy daughter so ignominiously treated and thy son led to execution without exclamation or weeping thou shouldst be so highly concerned for a poor man no way related to thee"  Psammenitus returned the following answer  "Son of Cyrus the calamities of my family are too great to leave me the power of weeping but the misfortunes of a companion reduced in his old age to want of bread is a fit subject for lamentation"    Surprise and terror are silent passions for a different reason they agitate the mind so violently as for a time to suspend the exercise of its faculties and in particular that of speech  Love and revenge when immoderate  are not more loquacious than immoderate grief But when these passions become moderate they set the tongue free and like moderate grief become loquacious Moderate love when unsuccessful is vented in complaints when successful is full of joy expressed both in words and gestures  As no passion hath any long uninterrupted existence  See chap part  nor beats always with an equal pulse the language suggested by passion is also unequal and interrupted And even during an uninterrupted fit of passion we only express in words the more capital sentiments In familiar conversation one who vents every single thought is justly branded with  the character of  loquacity  Sensible persons express no thoughts but what make some figure In the same manner we are only disposed to express the strongest impulses of passion especially when it returns with impetuosity after some interruption  I already have had occasion to observe  Chap  that the sentiments ought to be tuned to the passion and the language to both Elevated sentiments require elevated language tender sentiments ought to be clothed in words that are soft and flowing when the mind is depressed with any passion the sentiments must be expressed in words that are humble not low Words have an intimate connection with the ideas they represent and the representation must be imperfect if the words correspond not precisely to the ideas An elevated tone of language to express a plain or humble sentiment has a bad effect by a discordant mixture of feeling There is not less discord when elevated sentiments are dressed in low words  Versibus exponi tragicis res comica non vult  Indignatur item privatis ac prope Socco  Dignis carminibus narrari coena Thyestae  Horace Ars poet l  This however excludes not figurative expression which within moderate bounds communicates to the sentiment an agreeable elevation We are sensible of an effect directly opposite where figurative expression is indulged beyond a just measure The opposition betwixt the expression and the sentiment makes the discord appear greater than it is in reality  See this explained more particularly in chap    At the same time all passions admit not equally of figures Pleasant emotions which elevate or swell the mind vent themselves in strong epithets and figurative expression Humbling and dispiriting passions on the contrary affect to speak plain  Et tragicus plerumque dolet sermone pedestri  Telephus et Peleus cum pauper et exul uterque  Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba  Si curat cor spectantis tetigisse querela  Horace Ars poet  Figurative expression is the work of an enlivened imagination and for that reason cannot be the language of anguish or distress A scene of this kind is painted by Otway in colours finely adapted to the subject There is scarce a figure in it except a short and natural simile with which the speech is introduced  Belvidera talking to her father of her husband  Think you saw what pass'd at our last parting  Think you beheld him like a raging lion  Pacing the earth and tearing up his steps  Fate in his eyes and roaring with the pain  Of burning fury think you saw his one hand  Fix'd on my throat while the extended other  Grasp'd a keen threat'ning dagger oh 'twas thus  We last embrac'd when trembling with revenge  He dragg'd me to the ground and at my bosom  Presented horrid death cry'd out My friends  Where are my friends swore wept rag'd threaten'd lov'd  For he yet lov'd and that dear love preserv'd me  To this last trial of a father's pity  I fear not death but cannot bear a thought  That that dear hand should do th'unfriendly office  If I was ever then your care now hear me  Fly to the senate save the promis'd lives  Of his dear friends ere mine be made the sacrifice  Venice preserv'd act  To preserve this resemblance betwixt words and their meaning the sentiments of active and hurrying passions ought to be dressed in words where syllables prevail that are pronounced short or fast for these make an impression of hurry and precipitation Emotions on the other hand that rest upon their objects are best expressed by words where syllables prevail that are pronounced long or slow A person affected with melancholy has a languid and slow train of perceptions The expression best suited to this state of mind is where words not only of long but of many syllables abound in the composition For that reason nothing can be finer than the following passage  In those deep solitudes and awful cells  Where heav'nlypensive Contemplation dwells  And evermusing Melancholy reigns  Pope Eloisa to Abelard  To preserve the same resemblance another  circumstance is requisite that the language conformable to the emotion be rough or smooth broken or uniform Calm and sweet emotions are best expressed by words that glide softly surprise fear and other turbulent passions require an expression both rough and broken  It cannot have escaped any diligent inquirer into nature that in the hurry of passion one generally expresses that thing first which is most at heart This is beautifully done in the following passage  Me me adsum qui feci in me convertite ferrum  O Rutuli mea fraus omnis  Aeneid ix  Passion has often the effect of redoubling words the better to make them express the strong conception of the mind This is finely represented in the following examples  Thou sun said I fair light  And thou enlighten'd earth so fresh and gay  Ye hills and dales ye rivers woods and plains  And ye that live and move fair creatures tell  Tell if ye saw how came I thus how here  Paradise Lost b viii  Both have sinn'd but thou  Against God only I 'gainst God and thee  And to the place of judgement will return  There with my cries importune Heav'n that all  The sentence from thy head remov'd may light  On me sole cause to thee of all this woe  Me Me only just object of his ire  Paradise Lost book x  Shakespear is superior to all other writers in delineating passion It is difficult to say in what part he most excels whether in moulding every passion to peculiarity of character in discovering the sentiments that proceed from various tones of passion or in expressing properly every different sentiment He imposes not upon his reader general declamation and the false coin of unmeaning words which the bulk of writers deal in His sentiments are adjusted with the greatest propriety to the peculiar character and circumstances of the speaker and the propriety is not less perfect betwixt his sentiments and his diction That this is no exaggeration  will be evident to every one of taste upon comparing Shakespear with other writers in similar passages If upon any occasion he fall below himself it is in those scenes where passion enters not By endeavouring in this case to raise his dialogue above the style of ordinary conversation he sometimes deviates into intricate thought and obscure expression  Of this take the following specimen  They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase  Soil our addition and indeed it takes  From our atchievements though perform'd at height  The pith and marrow of our attribute  So oft it chances in particular men  That for some vicious mole of nature in them  As in their birth wherein they are not guilty  Since Nature cannot chuse his origin  By the o'ergrowth of some complexion  Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason  Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens  The form of plausive manners that these men  Carrying I say the stamp of one defect  Being Nature's livery or Fortune's scar  Their virtues else be they as pure as grace  As infinite as man may undergo  Shall in the general censure take corruption  From that particular sault  Hamlet act sc  Sometimes to  throw his language out of the familiar he employs rhyme But may it not in some measure excuse Shakespear I shall not say his works that he had no pattern in his own or in any living language of dialogue fitted for the theatre At the same time it ought not to escape observation that the stream clears in its progress and that in his later plays he has attained the purity and perfection of dialogue an observation that with greater certainty than tradition will direct us to arrange his plays in the order of time This ought to be considered by those who magnify every blemish that is discovered in the finest genius for the drama ever the world enjoy'd They ought also for their own sake to consider that it is easier to discover his blemishes which lie generally at the surface than his beauties of which none can have a thorough relish but those who dive deep into human nature One thing must be evident to the meanest capacity that whereever passion is to be display'd Nature shows itself strong in him  and is conspicuous by the most delicate propriety of sentiment and expression  The critics seem not perfectly to comprehend the genius of Shakespear His plays are defective in the mechanical part which is less the work of genius than of experience and is not otherwise brought to perfection than by diligently observing the errors of former compositions Shakespear excels all the ancients and moderns in knowledge of human nature and in unfolding even the most obscure and refined emotions This is a rare faculty and of the greatest importance in a dramatic author and it is this faculty which makes him surpass all other writers in the comic as well as tragic vein    I return to my subject from a digression I cannot repent of That perfect harmony which ought to subsist among all the constituent parts of a dialogue is a beauty not less rare than conspicuous As to expression in particular were I to give instances where in one or other of the respects above mentioned it corresponds not precisely to the characters passions and sentiments I might from different authors collect volumes Following therefore the method laid down in the chapter of sentiments I shall confine my citations to the grosser errors which every writer ought to avoid  And first of passion expressed in words flowing in an equal course without interruption  In the chapter above cited Corneille is censured for the impropriety of his sentiments and here for the sake of truth I am obliged to attack him a second time Were I to give instances from that author of the fault under consideration I might copy whole tragedies for he is not less faulty in this particular than in passing upon us his own thoughts as a spectator instead of the genuine sentiments of passion Nor would a comparison betwixt him and Shakespear upon the present point redound more to his honour than the former upon the sentiments Racine here is less incorrect than Corneille though many degrees inferior to the English author From Racine I shall gather a few instances The first shall be the description of the seamonster in his  Phaedra  given by Theramene the companion of Hippolytus and an eyewitness to the disaster Theramene is represented in terrible agitation which appears from the following passage  so boldly figurative as not to be excused but by violent perturbation of mind  Le ciel avec horreur voit ce monstre sauvage  La terre s'en émeut l'air en est infecté  Le flot qui l'apporta recule epouvanté  Yet Theramene gives a long pompous connected description of this event dwelling upon every minute circumstance as if he had been only a cool spectator  A peine nous sortions des portes de Trézene  c  Act sc  The last speech of Atalide in the tragedy of  Bajazet  of the same author is a continued discourse and but a faint representation of the violent passion which forc'd her to put an end to her own life  Enfin c'en est donc fait  c  Act sc last  Though works not authors are the professed subject of this critical undertaking I am tempted by the present speculation to transgress once again the limits  prescribed and to venture a cursory reflection upon this justlycelebrated author That he is always sensible generally correct never falls low maintains a moderate degree of dignity without reaching the sublime paints delicately the tender passions but is a stranger to the true language of enthusiastic or fervid passion  If in general the language of violent passion ought to be broken and interrupted soliloquies ought to be so in a peculiar manner Language is intended by nature for society and a man when alone though he always clothes his thoughts in words seldom gives his words utterance unless when prompted by some strong emotion and even then by starts and intervals only  Soliloquies accounted for chap  Shakespear's soliloquies may be justly established as a model for it is not easy to conceive any model more perfect Of his many incomparable soliloquies I confine myself to the two following being different in their manner  Hamlet  Oh that this too too solid flesh would melt  Thaw and resolve itself into a dew  Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  His cannon 'gainst selfslaughter O God O God  How weary stale flat and unprofitable  Seem to me all the uses of this world  Fie on't O fie 'tis an unweeded garden  That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature  Possess it merely That it should come to this  But two months dead nay not so much not two  So excellent a king that was to this  Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother  That he permitted not the winds of heav'n  Visit her face too roughly Heav'n and earth  Must I rememberwhy she would hang on him  As if increase of appetite had grown  By what it fed on yet within a month  Let me not thinkFrailty thy name is  Woman  A little month or ere those shoes were old  With which she follow'd my poor father's body  Like Niobe all tearswhy she ev'n she  O Heav'n a beast that wants discourse of reason  Would have mourn'd longer married with mine uncle  My father's brother but no more like my father  Than I to HerculesWithin a month  Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears  Had left the flushing in her gauled eyes  She marriedOh most wicked speed to post  With such dexterity to incestuous sheets  It is not nor it cannot come to good  But break my heart for I must hold my tongue  Hamlet act sc  Ford  Hum ha is this a vision is this a dream do I sleep Mr Ford awake awake Mr Ford there's a hole made in your best coat Mr Ford this 'tis to be married this 'tis to have linen and buck baskets Well I will proclaim myself what I am I will now take the leacher he is at my house he cannot 'scape me 'tis impossible he should he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse nor into a pepperbox But lest the devil that guides him should aid him I will search impossible places though what I am I cannot avoid yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame  Merry Wives of Windsor act sc last  These soliloquies are accurate copies of nature In a passionate soliloquy one begins  with thinking aloud and the strongest feelings only are expressed As the speaker warms he begins to imagine one listening and gradually slides into a connected discourse  How far distant are soliloquies generally from these models They are indeed for the most part so unhappily executed as to give disgust instead of pleasure The first scene of  Iphigenia  in Tauris discovers that princess in a soliloquy gravely reporting to herself her own history There is the same impropriety in the first scene of Alcestes and in the other introductions of Euripides almost without exception Nothing can be more ridiculous It puts one in mind of that ingenious device in Gothic paintings of making every figure explain itself by a written label issuing from its mouth The description a parasite in the  Eunuch  of Terence  Act sc  gives of himself in the form of a soliloquy is lively but against all the rules of propriety for no man in his ordinary state of mind and upon a familiar  subject ever thinks of talking aloud to himself The same objection lies against a soliloquy in the  Adelphi  of the same author  Act sc  The soliloquy which makes the third scene act third of his  Heicyra  is insufferable for there Pamphilus soberly and circumstantially relates to himself an adventure which had happened to him a moment before  Corneille is not more happy in his soliloquies than in his dialogue Take for a specimen the first scene of  Cinna  Racine also is extremely faulty in the same respect His soliloquies almost without exception are regular harangues a chain completed in every link without interruption or interval That of Antiochus in  Berenice  Act sc  resembles a regular pleading where the parties  pro  and  con  display their arguments at full length The following soliloquies are equally destitute of propriety  Bajazet  act sc  Mithridate  act sc act sc  Iphigenia  act sc  Soliloquies upon lively or interesting subjects  but without any turbulence of passion may be carried on in a continued chain of thought If for example the nature and sprightliness of the subject prompt a man to speak his thoughts in the form of a dialogue the expression must be carried on without break or interruption as in a dialogue betwixt two persons This justifies Falstaff's soliloquy upon honour  What need I be so forward with Death that calls not on me Well 'tis no matter Honour pricks me on But how if Honour prick me off when I come on how then Can Honour set a leg No or an arm No or take away the grief of a wound No Honour hath no skill in surgery then No What is Honour A wordWhat is that word  honour  Air a trim reckoningWho hath it He that dy'd a Wednesday Doth he feel it No Doth he hear it No Is it insensible then Yea to the dead But will it not live with the living No Why Detraction will not suffer it Therefore I'll none of it honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism  First part Henry IV act sc  And even without dialogue a continued discourse may be justified where the soliloquy  is upon an important subject that makes a strong impression but without much agitation For if it be at all excusable to think aloud it is necessary that the language with the reasoning be carried on in a chain without a broken link In this view that admirable soliloquy in  Hamlet  upon life and immortality being a serene meditation upon the most interesting of all subjects ought to escape censure And the same consideration will justify the soliloquy that introduces the th act of Addison's  Cato  The next class of the grosser errors which all writers ought to avoid shall be of language elevated above the tone of the sentiment of which take the following instances  Zara  Swift as occasion I  Myself will fly and earlier than the morn  Wake thee to freedom Now 'tis late and yet  Some news few minutes past arriv'd which seem'd  To shake the temper of the KingWho knows  What racking cares disease a monarch's bed  Or love that late at night still lights his lamp  And strikes his rays through dusk and folded lids  Forbidding rest may stretch his eyes awake  And force their balls abroad at this dead hour  I'll try  Mourning Bride act sc  The language here is undoubtedly too pompous and laboured for describing so simple a circumstance as absence of sleep In the following passage the tone of the language warm and plaintive is well suited to the passion which is recent grief But every one will be sensible that in the last couplet save one the tone is changed and the mind suddenly elevated to be let fall as suddenly in the last couplet  Il déteste à jamais sa coupable victoire  Il renonce à la cour aux humains à la gloire  Et se fuïant luimême au milieu des deserts  Il va cacher sa peine au bout de l'univers  La soit que le soleil rendît le jour au monde  Soit qu'il finît sa course au vaste sein de l'onde  Sa voix faisoit redire aux echos attendris  Le nom le triste nom de son malheureux fils  Henriade chant viii  Language too artificial or too figurative  for the gravity dignity or importance of the occasion may be put in a third class  Chimene demanding justice against Rodrigue who killed her father instead of a plain and pathetic expostulation makes a speech stuffed with the most artificial flowers of rhetoric  Sire mon pere est mort mes yeux ont vû son sang  Couler à gros bouillons de son généreux flanc  Ce sang qui tant de fois garantit vos murailles  Ce sang qui tant de fois vous gagna des batailles  Ce sang qui tout sorti fume encore de courroux  De se voir répandu pour d'autres que pour vous  Qu'au milieu des hazards n'osoit verser la guerre  Rodrigue en votre cour vient d'en couvrir la terre  J'ai couru sur le lieu sans force et sans couleur  Je l'ai trouvé sans vie Excusez ma douleur  Sire la voix me manque à ce récit funeste  Mes pleurs et mes soupirs vous diront mieux le reste  And again  Son flanc etoit ouvert et pour mieux m'emouvoir  Son sang sur la poussiére écrivoit mon devoire  Ou plutôt sa valeur en cet état réduite  Me parloit par sa plaie et hâtoit ma pursuite  Et pour se faire entendre au plus juste des Rois  Par cette triste bouche elle empruntoit ma voix  Act sc  Nothing can be contrived in language more averse to the tone of the passion than this florid speech I should imagine it more apt to provoke laughter than to inspire concern or pity  In a fourth class shall be given specimens of language too light or airy for a severe passion  The agony a mother must feel upon the savage murder of two hopeful sons rejects all imagery and figurative expression as discordant in the highest degree Therefore the following passage is undoubtedly in a bad taste  Queen  Ah my poor princes ah my tender babes  My unblown flow'rs newappearing sweets  If yet your gentle souls fly in the air  And be not fixt in doom perpetual  Hover about me with your airy wings  And hear your mother's lamentation  Richard III act sc  Again  K Philip  You

called  a play of words  being low and childish is unworthy of any composition whether gay or serious that pretends to the smallest share of dignity Thoughts of this kind make a fifth class  In the  Aminta  of Tasso  Act sc  the lover falls into a mere play of words demanding how  he who had lost himself could find a mistress And for the same reason the following passage in Corneille has been generally condemned  Chimene  Mon pere est mort Elvire et la premiére épée  Dont s'est armé Rodrigue à sa trame coupée  Pleurez pleurez mes yeux et fondezvous en eau  La moitié de ma vie a mis l'autre

which is still worse than a pun is the meanest of all conceits But Shakespear when he descends to a play of words is not always in the wrong for it is done sometimes to denote a peculiar character as is the following passage  King Philip  What say'st thou boy look in the lady's face  Lewis  I do my Lord and in her eye I find  A wonder or a wond'rous miracle  The shadow of myself form'd in her eye  Which being but the shadow of your son  Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow  I do protest I never lov'd myself  Till now infixed I beheld myself  Drawn in the flatt'ring table of her eye

attempt  At one slight bound high overleap'd all bound  With a shout  Loud as from numbers without number  One should think it unnecessary to enter a caveat against an expression that has no meaning

Language  OF all the fine arts painting only and sculpture are in their nature imitative A field laid out with taste is not properly speaking a copy or imitation of nature but nature itself embellished Architecture deals in originals and copies not from nature Sound and motion may in some measure be imitated by music but for the most part music like architecture deals in originals Language has no archetype in nature more than music or architecture unless where like music it is imitative of sound or motion In the description of particular sounds language sometimes happily furnisheth words which beside their customary power of exciting ideas resemble by their softness or harshness the sound described and there are words which by the celerity or slowness of pronunciation have some resemblance  to the motion they signify This imitative power of words goes one step farther The loftiness of some words makes them proper symbols of lofty ideas a rough subject is imitated by harshsounding words and words of many syllables pronounced slow and smooth are naturally expressive of grief and melancholy Words have a separate effect on the mind abstracting from their signification and from their imitative power They are more or less agreeable to the ear by the roundness sweetness faintness or roughness of their tones  These are beauties but not of the first rank They are relished by those only who have more delicacy of sensation than belongs to the bulk of mankind Language possesseth a beauty superior greatly in degree of which we are eminently conscious when a thought is communicated in a strong and lively manner This beauty of language arising from its power of expressing thought is apt to be confounded with the beauty of the thought expressed which beauty by a natural transition of feeling among things intimately connected is convey'd  to the expression and makes it appear more beautiful  See chap part sect  But these beauties if we wish to think accurately must be carefully distinguished from each other They are indeed so distinct that we sometimes are conscious of the highest pleasure language can afford when the subject expressed is disagreeable A thing that is loathsome or a scene of horror to make one's hair stand on end may be described in the liveliest manner In this case the disagreeableness of the subject doth not even obscure the agreeableness of the description The causes of the original beauty of language considered as significant which is a branch of the present subject will be explained in their order I shall only at present observe that this beauty is the beauty of means fitted to an end  viz  the communication of thought And hence it evidently appears that of several expressions all conveying the same thought the most beautiful in the sense now mentioned is that  which in the most perfect manner answers its end  The several beauties of language above mentioned being of different kinds and distinguishable from each other ought to be handled separately I shall begin with those beauties of language which arise from sound after which will follow the beauties of language considered as significant This order appears natural for the sound of a word is attended to before we consider its signification In a third section come those singular beauties of language that are derived from a resemblance betwixt sound and signification The beauties of verse I propose to handle in the last section For though the foregoing beauties are found in verse as well as in prose yet verse has many peculiar beauties which for the sake of perspicuity must be brought under one view And versification at any rate is a subject of so great importance as to deserve a place by itself  SECT I Beauty of language with respect to sound  I Propose to handle this subject in the following order which appears the most natural The sounds of the different letters come first Next these sounds as united in syllables Third syllables united in words Fourth words united in a period And in the last place periods united in a discourse  With respect to the first article every vowel is sounded by a single expiration of air from the windpipe through the cavity of the mouth and by varying this cavity the different vowels are sounded The air in passing through cavities differing in size produceth various sounds some high or sharp some low or flat A small cavity occasions a high sound a large cavity a low sound The five vowels accordingly pronounced with the same extension of the  windpipe but with different openings of the mouth form a regular series of sounds descending from high to low in the following order  i    e    a  Here the German  a  is understood    o    u  Each of these sounds is agreeable to the ear And if it be inquired which of them is the most agreeable it is perhaps the safest side to hold that there is no universal preference of any one before the rest Probably those vowels which are farthest removed from the extremes will generally be the most relished This is all I have to remark upon the first article For consonants being letters which of themselves have no sound have no other power but to form articulate sounds in conjunction with vowels and every such articulate sound being a syllable consonants come naturally under the second article To which therefore we proceed  All consonants are pronounced with a less cavity than any of the vowels and consequently they contribute to form a sound still more sharp than the sharpest vowel pronounced single Hence it follows that  every articulate sound into which a consonant enters must necessarily be double though pronounced with one expiration of air or with one breath as commonly expressed The reason is that though two sounds readily unite yet where they differ in tone both of them must be heard if neither of them be suppressed For the same reason every syllable must be composed of as many sounds as there are letters supposing every letter to be distinctly pronounced  We next inquire how far articulate sounds into which consonants enter are agreeable to the ear With respect to this point there is a noted observation that all sounds of difficult pronunciation are to the ear harsh in proportion Few tongues are so polished as entirely to have rejected sounds that are pronounced with difficulty and such sounds must in some measure be disagreeable But with respect to agreeable sounds it appears that a double sound is always more agreeable than a single sound Every one who has an ear must be sensible that the diphthongs  oi  or  ai  are more agreeable than any of these vowels pronounced singly  And the same holds where a consonant enters into the double sound The syllable  le  has a more agreeable sound than the vowel  e  or than any vowel And in support of experience a satisfactory argument may be drawn from the wisdom of Providence Speech is bestowed upon man to qualify him for society The provision he hath of articulate sounds is proportioned to the use he hath for them But if sounds that are agreeable singly were not also agreeable in conjunction the necessity of a painful selection would render language intricate and difficult to be attained in any perfection And this selection at the same time would tend to abridge the number of useful sounds so as perhaps not to leave sufficient for answering the different ends of language  In this view the harmony of pronunciation differs widely from that of music properly so called In the latter are discovered many sounds singly agreeable that in conjunction are extremely disagreeable none but what are called  concordant sounds  having a good effect in conjunction In the former all sounds singly agreeable are in conjunction  concordant and ought to be in order to fulfil the purposes of language  Having discussed syllables we proceed to words which make a third article Monosyllables belong to the former head Polysyllables open a different scene In a cursory view one will readily imagine that the effect a word hath upon the ear must depend entirely upon the agreeableness or disagreeableness of its component syllables In part it doth but not entirely for we must also take under consideration the effect that a number of syllables composing a word have in succession In the first place syllables in immediate succession pronounced each of them with the same or nearly the same aperture of the mouth produce a weak and imperfect sound witness the French words  détêté  detested  ditil  says he  patetique  pathetic On the other hand a syllable of the greatest aperture succeeding one of the smallest or the opposite makes a succession which because of its remarkable disagreeableness is distinguished by a proper name  viz hiatus  The most agreeable succession is where the  cavity is increased and diminished alternately by moderate intervals Secondly words consisting wholly of syllables pronounced slow or of syllables pronounced quick commonly called  long  and  short syllables  have little melody in them Witness the words  petitioner    fruiterer    dizziness  On the other hand the intermixture of long and short syllables is remarkably agreeable for example  degree    repent    wonderful    altitude    rapidity    independent    impetuosity  The cause will be explained afterward in treating of versification  Distinguishable from the beauties above mentioned there is a beauty of some words which arises from their signification When the emotion raised by the length or shortness the roughness or smoothness of the sound resembles in any degree what is raised by the sense we feel a very remarkable pleasure But this subject belongs to the third section  The foregoing observations afford a standard to every nation for estimating pretty accurately the comparative merit of the words that enter into their own language  And though at first view they may be thought equally useful for estimating the comparative merit of different languages yet this holds not in fact because no person can readily be found who is sufficiently qualified to apply the standard What I mean is that different nations judge differently of the harshness or smoothness of articulate sounds a sound harsh and disagreeable to an Italian may be abundantly smooth to a northern ear Where are we to find a judge to determine this controversy and supposing a judge upon what principle is his decision to be founded The case here is precisely the same as in behaviour and manners Plaindealing and sincerity liberty in words and actions form the character of one people Politeness reserve and a total disguise of every sentiment that can give offence form the character of another people To each the manners of the other are disagreeable An effeminate mind cannot bear the least of that roughness and severity which is generally esteemed manly when exerted upon proper occasions Neither can an effeminate ear  bear the least harshness in words that are deemed nervous and sounding by those accustomed to a rougher tone of language Must we then relinquish all thoughts of comparing languages in the point of roughness and smoothness as a fruitless inquiry Not altogether so for we may proceed a certain length though without hope of an ultimate decision A language with difficulty pronounced even by natives must yield the preference to a smoother language Again supposing two languages pronounced with equal facility by natives the preference in my judgement ought to be in favour of the rougher language provided it be also stored with a competent share of more mellow sounds This will be evident from attending to the different effects that articulate sound hath upon the mind A smooth gliding sound is agreeable by smoothing the mind and lulling it to rest A rough bold sound on the contrary animates the mind The effort perceived in pronouncing is communicated to the hearers they feel in their own minds a similar effort  which rouses their attention and disposes them to action I must add another consideration The agreeableness of contrast in the rougher language for which the great variety of sounds gives ample opportunity must even in an effeminate ear prevail over the more uniform sounds of the smoother language  That the Italian tongue is rather too smooth seems to appear from considering that in versification vowels are frequently suppressed in order to produce a rougher and bolder tone  This appears to me all that can be safely determined upon the present point With respect to the other circumstances that constitute the beauty of words the standard above mentioned is infallible when apply'd to foreign languages as well as to our own For every man whatever be his mothertongue is equally capable to judge of the length or shortness of words of the alternate opening and closing of the mouth in speaking and of the relation which the sound bears to the sense In these particulars the judgement is susceptible of no prejudice from custom at least of no invincible prejudice  That the English tongue originally harsh is at present much softened by droping in the pronunciation many redundant consonants is undoubtedly true That it is not capable of being farther mellowed without suffering in its force and energy will scarce be thought by any one who possesses an ear And yet such in Britain is the propensity for dispatch that overlooking the majesty of words composed of many syllables aptly connected the prevailing taste is to shorten words even at the expence of making them disagreeable to the ear and harsh in the pronunciation But I have no occasion to insist upon this article being prevented by an excellent writer who possessed if any man ever did the true genius of the English tongue  See Swift's proposal for correcting the English tongue in a letter to the Earl of Oxford  I cannot however forbear urging one observation borrowed from that author Several tenses of our verbs are formed by adding the final syllable  ed  which being a weak sound has remarkably the worse effect  by possessing the most conspicuous place in the word Upon that account the vowel is in common speech generally suppressed and the consonant is added to the foregoing syllable Hence the following rugged sounds  drudg'd    disturb'd    rebuk'd    fledg'd  It is still less excuseable to follow this practice in writing for the hurry of speaking may excuse what is altogether improper in a composition of any value The syllable  ed  it is true makes but a poor figure at the end of a word but we ought to submit to that defect rather than multiply the number of harsh words which after all that has been done bear an overproportion in our tongue The author above mentioned by showing a good example did all in his power to restore that syllable and he well deserves to be imitated Some exceptions however I would make A word which signifies labour or any thing harsh or rugged ought not to be smooth Therefore  forc'd  with an apostrophe is better than  forced  without it Another exception is where the penult syllable ends with a vowel In that case  the final syllable  ed  may be apostrophized without making the word harsh Examples  betray'd    carry'd    destroy'd    employ'd  The article next in order is to consider the music of words as united in a period And as the arrangement of words in succession so as to afford the greatest pleasure to the ear depends on principles pretty remote from common view it will be necessary to premise some general observations upon the effect that a number of objects have upon the mind when they are placed in an increasing or decreasing series The effect of such a series will be very different according as resemblance or contrast prevails Where the members of a series vary by small differences resemblance prevails which in ascending makes us conceive the second object of no greater size than the first the third of no greater size than the second and so of the rest This diminisheth in appearance the size of the whole Again when beginning at the largest object we proceed gradually to the least resemblance makes us imagine the second as large as the first and the third as  large as the second which in appearance magnifies every object of the series except the first On the other hand in a series varying by great differences where contrast prevails the effects are directly opposite A large object succeeding a small one of the same kind appears by the opposition larger than usual and a small object for the same reason succeeding one that is large appears less than usual  See the reason chap  Hence a remarkable pleasure in viewing a series ascending by large intervals directly opposite to what we feel when the intervals are small Beginning at the smallest object of a series where contrast prevails this object has the same effect upon the mind as if it stood single without making a part of the series But this is not the case of the second object which by means of contrast makes a much greater figure than when viewed singly and apart and the same effect is perceived in ascending progressively till we arrive at the last object The direct contrary effect is produced in descending for in this direction  every object except the first makes a less figure than when viewed separately and independent of the series We may then lay down as a maxim which will hold in the composition of language as well as of other subjects That a strong impulse succeeding a weak makes a double impression on the mind and that a weak impulse succeeding a strong makes scarce any impression  After establishing this maxim we can be at no loss about its application to the subject in hand The following rule is laid down by Diomedes  De structura perfectae orationis l    "In verbis observandum est ne a majoribus ad minora descendat oratio melius enim dicitur  Vir est optimus  quam  Vir optimus est  "  This rule is applicable not only to single words but equally to entire members of a period which according to our author's expression ought not more than single words to proceed from the greater to the less but from the less to the greater In arranging the members of a period on writer  equals Cicero The beauty of the following examples out of many will not suffer me to slur them over by a reference  Quicum quaestor fueram  Quicum me sors consuetudoque majorum  Quicum me Deorum hominumque judicium conjunxerat  Again  Habet honorem quem petimus  Habet spem quam praepositam nobis habemus  Habet existimationem multo sudore labore vigiliisque collectam  Again  Eripite nos ex miseriis  Eripite nos ex faucibus eorum  Quorum crudelitas nostro sanguine non potest expleri  De oratore l §  This order of words or members gradually increasing in length may so far as concerns the pleasure of sound singly be denominated  a climax in sound  The last article is the music of periods as united in a discourse which shall be dispatched in a very few words By no other human means is it possible to present to the mind such a number of objects and in so swift a succession as by speaking or writing And for that reason variety ought more to be studied in these than in any other sort of composition Hence a rule regarding the arrangement of the members of different periods with relation to each other That to avoid a tedious uniformity of sound and cadence the arrangement the cadence and the length of these members ought to be diversified as much as possible And if the members of different periods be sufficiently diversified the periods themselves will be equally so  SECT II Beauty of language with respect to signification  IT is well said by a noted writer  Scot's Christian life    "That by means of speech we can divert our sorrows mingle our mirth impart our secrets communicate our counsels and make mutual compacts and agreements to supply and assist each other"  Considering speech as contributing thus to so many good purposes it follows that the chusing words which have an accurate meaning and tend to convey clear and distinct ideas must be one of its capital beauties This cause of beauty is too extensive to be handled as a branch of any other subject To ascertain with accuracy even the proper meaning of words not to talk of their figurative power would require a large volume an useful work indeed but not to be attempted without a large stock of time study and reflection  This branch therefore of the subject I must humbly decline Nor do I propose to exhaust all the other beauties of language with respect to signification The reader in a work like the present cannot fairly expect more than a slight sketch of those that make the greatest figure This is a task which I attempt the more willingly as it appears to be connected with some principles in human nature and the rules I shall have occasion to lay down will if I judge aright be agreeable illustrations of these principles Every subject must be of importance that tends in any measure to unfold the human heart for what other science is more worthy of human beings  The present subject is so extensive that to prevent confusion it must be divided into parts and what follows suggests a division into two parts In every period two things are to be regarded equally capital first the words of which the period is composed next the arrangement of these words The former resemble the stones that compose a building and the latter resembles the order in which these stones are placed  Hence the beauty of language with respect to its meaning may not improperly be distinguished into two kinds The first consists in a right choice of words or materials for constructing the period and the other consists in a due arrangement of these words or materials I shall begin with rules that direct us to a right choice of words and then proceed to rules that concern their arrangement  And with respect to the former communication of thought being the principal end of language it is a rule That perspicuity ought not to be sacrificed to any other beauty whatever If it should be doubted whether perspicuity be a positive beauty it cannot be doubted that the want of it is the greatest defect Nothing therefore in the structure of language ought more to be studied than to prevent all obscurity in the expression for to have no meaning is but one degree worse than to express it so as not to be understood Want of perspicuity from a wrong arrangement belongs to the next branch I shall give a few examples where the obscurity arises from a wrong choice of  words and as this defect is so common in ordinary writers as to make examples from them unnecessary I confine myself to the most celebrated authors  Livy speaking of a rout after a battle  Multique in ruina majore quam fuga oppressi obtruncatique  L §  Unde tibi reditum  certo subtemine  Parcae  Rupere  Horace epod xiii  Qui persaepe cava testudine flevit amorem  Non elaboratum ad pedem  Horace epod xiv  Me fabulosae Vulture in Appulo  Altricis extra limen Apuliae  Ludo fatigatumque  somno    Fronde nova puerum palumbes  Texere  Horace Carm l ode  Purae rivus aquae silvaque jugerum  Paucorum et segetis certa fides meae  Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae  Fallit sorte beatior  Horace Carm l ode  Cum fas atque nefas exiguo  fine  libidinum  Discernunt avidi  Horace Carm l ode  Ac spem fronte serenat  Aeneid iv  There is want of neatness even in an ambiguity so slight as that is which arises from the construction merely as where the period commences with a member which is conceived to be in the nominative case and which afterward is found to be in the accusative Example  "Some emotions more peculiarly connected with the fine arts I propose to handle in separate chapters  Elements of criticism vol p  "  Better thus  "Some emotions more peculiarly connected with the fine arts are proposed to be handled in separate chapters"  The rule next in order because next in importance is That the language ought to correspond to the subject Grand or heroic actions or sentiments require elevated language tender sentiments ought to be expressed  in words soft and flowing and plain language devoid of ornament is adapted to subjects grave and didactic Language may be considered as the dress of thought and where the one is not suited to the other we are sensible of incongruity in the same manner as where a judge is dressed like a fop or a peasant like a man of quality The intimate connection that words have with their meaning requires that both be in the same tone Or to express the thing more plainly the impression made by the words ought as nearly as possible to resemble the impression made by the thought The similar emotions mix sweetly in the mind and augment the pleasure  Chap part  On the other hand where the impressions made by the thought and the words are dissimilar they are forc'd into a sort of unnatural union which is disagreeable  Ibid    In the preceding chapter concerning the language of passion I had occasion to give many examples of deviations from this  rule with regard to the manner of expressing passions and their sentiments But as the rule concerns the manner of expressing thoughts and ideas of all kinds it has an extensive influence in directing us to the choice of proper materials In that view it must be branched out into several particulars And I must observe in the first place that to write with elegance it is not sufficient to express barely the conjunction or disjunction of the members of the thought It is a beauty to find a similar conjunction or disjunction in the words This may be illustrated by a familiar example When we have occasion to mention the intimate connection that the soul has with the body the expression ought to be  the soul and body  because the particle  the  relative to both makes a connection in the expression which resembles in some degree the connection in the thought But when the soul is distinguished from the body it is better to say  the soul and the body  because the disjunction in the words resembles the disjunction in the thought In the following  examples the connection in the thought is happily imitated in the expression  Constituit agmen et expedire tela animosque equitibus jussis  c  Livy l §  Again  Quum ex paucis quotidie aliqui eorum caderent aut vulnerarentur et qui superarent fessi et corporibus et animis essent  c  Livy l §  Post acer Mnestheus adducto constitit arcu  Alta petens pariterque oculos telumque tetendit  Aeneid l v  The following passage of Tacitus appears to me not so happy It approaches to wit by connecting in the foregoing manner things but slightly related which is not altogether suitable to the dignity or gravity of history  Germania omnis a Galliis Rhaetiisque et Pannoniis Rheno et Danubio fluminibus a Sarmatis Dacisque mutuo metu aut montibus separatur  De moribus Germanorum  I am more doubtful about this other instance  The fiend look'd up and knew  His mounted scale aloft nor more but fled  Murm'ring and with him fled the shades of night  Paradise Lost B at the end  I shall add some other examples where the opposition in the thought is imitated in the words an imitation that is distinguished by the name of  antithesis  Speaking of Coriolanus soliciting the people to be made consul  With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds  Coriolanus  Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all

periods A sentence or period in language ought to express one entire thought or mental proposition and different thoughts ought to be separated in the expression by placing them in different sentences or periods It is therefore offending against neatness to crowd into one period entire thoughts which require more than one for this is conjoining in language things that are separated in reality and consequently rejecting that uniformity which ought to be preserved betwixt thought and expression Of errors against this rule take the following examples  Caesar describing the Suevi  Atque in eam se consuetudinem adduxerunt ut locis frigidissimis neque vestitus praeter pelles habeant quidquam quarum propter exiguitatem  magna est corporis pars operta et laventur in fluminibus  Commentaria l prin

conceiving what we are incapable of attaining  but however sufficient upon the whole to constitute a state easy and happy or at the worst tolerable I say it seems to me that the author of nature has thought fit to mingle from time to time among the societies of men a few and but a few of those on whom he is graciously pleased to bestow a larger proportion of the ethereal spirit than is given in the ordinary course of his providence to the sons of men  Bolingbroke on the spirit of patriotism let  To crowd into a single member of a period different subjects is still worse than to crowd them

uniformity is in this case totally neglected  See Gerard's French grammar discourse  witness the following example where the construction of two members connected by a copulative is unnecessarily varied  For it is confidently reported that two young gentlemen of real hopes bright wit and profound judgment who upon a thorough examination of causes and effects and by the mere force of natural

it represents any peculiar connection among the constituent parts of the thought but where there is no such connection it is a positive deformity because it makes a discordance betwixt the thought and expression For the same reason we ought also to avoid every artificial opposition of words where there is none in the thought This last termed  verbal antithesis  is studied by writers of no taste and is relished by readers of the same stamp because of a certain degree of liveliness in it They do not consider how incongruous it is in a grave composition to cheat the reader and to make him expect  a

two objects is described the writer ought to study a resemblance betwixt the two members that express these  objects For it makes the resemblance the more entire to find it extended even to the words To illustrate this rule I shall give various examples of deviations from it I begin with the words that express the resemblance  I have observed of late the style of some great  ministers  very much to exceed that of any other  productions  Letter to the Lord High Treasurer Swift  This instead of studying the resemblance of words in a period that expresses a comparison is going out of one's road

members that signify the resembling objects To produce a resemblance betwixt such members they ought not only to be constructed in the same manner but as nearly as possible be equal in length By

dedication  The same rule obtains in a comparison where things are opposed to each other Objects contrasted not less than what are similar require a resemblance in the members of the period that express them The reason is that contrast has no effect upon the mind except where the things compared have a resemblance in their capital parts  See chap  Therefore in opposing two circumstances  to each other it remarkably heightens the contrast to make as entire as possible the resemblance betwixt the other parts and in particular betwixt the members expressing the two circumstances contrasted As things are often best illustrated by their contraries I shall also give examples of deviations from the rule in this case  Addison says  A friend exaggerates a man's virtues an enemy inflames his crimes  Spectator N  o    Would it not be neater to study uniformity instead of variety as thus  A friend exaggerates a man's virtues an enemy his crimes  For here the contrast is only betwixt a

instruction which is acquired by inculcating an important moral truth  c  This expression includes two persons one acquiring and one inculcating and the scene is changed without necessity To avoid this blemish the thought may be expressed thus  That sort of instruction which is afforded by inculcating  c  The bad effect of this change of person is remarkable in the following passage  The

this means lose some part at least of that desire of fame which is the incentive to generous actions when they find it promiscuously bestowed on the meritorious and undeserving  Guardian N  o    Even so slight a change as to vary the construction in the same period is unpleasant  Annibal luce prima Balearibus levique alia armatura praemissa transgressus flumen ut quosque  traduxerat ita in acie

This passage is also faulty in a different respect that there is no resemblance betwixt the members of the expression though they import a comparison  The present head which relates to the choice of materials shall be closed with a rule concerning the use of copulatives Longinus observes that it animates a period to drop the copulatives and he gives the following example from Xenophon  Closing their shields together they were push'd they fought they slew they were slain  Treatise of the Sublime cap  The reason I take to be what follows A continued sound if not strong tends to lay us asleep An interrupted sound rouses and animates by its repeated impulses Hence it is that syllables collected into feet being pronounced with a sensible interval betwixt each make more lively impressions than can be made by a continued sound A period the members of which are connected by copulatives produceth an effect upon the mind approaching to that of a continued sound and therefore to suppress the copulatives must animate a description To suppress the copulatives hath another good effect The members of a period connected by the proper copulatives glide smoothly and gently along and are a proof of sedateness and leisure in the speaker On the other hand a man in the hurry of passion neglecting copulatives and other particles expresses the principal image only Hence it is that  hurry or quick action is best expressed without copulatives  Veni vidi vici  Ite  Ferte cite flammas date vela impellite remos  Aeneid iv  Quis globus O Cives caligine volvitur atra  Ferte cite ferrum date tela scandite muros  Hostis adest eja  Aeneid ix  In this view Longinus  Treatise of the sublime cap  justly compares copulatives in a period to strait tying which in a race obstructs the freedom of motion  It follows from the same premisses that to multiply copulatives in the same period ought to be avoided For if the laying aside copulatives give force and liveliness a redundancy of them must render the period languid I appeal to the following instance though there are not more than two copulatives  Upon looking over the letters of my female correspondents I find several from women complaining of jealous husbands and at the same time protesting their own innocence and desiring my advice upon this occasion  Spectator N  o    I except the case where the words are intended to express the coldness of the speaker for there the redundancy of copulatives is a beauty  Dining one day at an alderman's in the city Peter observed him expatiating after the manner of his brethren in the praises of his sirloin of beer  "Beef"  said the sage magistrate  "is the king of meat Beef comprehends in it the quintescence of partridge and quail and venison and pheasant and plumpudding and custard"  Tale of Tub §  And the author shows great taste in varying the expression in the mouth of Peter who is represented more animated  "Bread"  says he  "dear brothers is the staff of life in which bread is contained  inclusivè  the quintescence of beef mutton veal venison partridge plumpudding and custard"  We proceed to the second kind of beauty which consists in a due arrangement of the words or materials This branch of the subject is not less nice than extensive and  I despair to put it in a clear light until a sketch be given of the general principles that govern the structure or composition of language  Every thought generally speaking contains one capital object considered as acting or as suffering This object is expressed by a substantive noun Its action is expressed by an active verb and the thing affected by the action is expressed by another substantive noun Its suffering or passive state is expressed by a passive verb and the thing which acts upon it by a substantive noun Beside these which are the capital parts of a sentence or period there are generally underparts Each of the substantives as well as the verb may be qualified Time place purpose motive means instrument and a thousand other circumstances may be necessary to complete the thought And in what manner these several parts are connected together in the expression will appear from what follows  In a complete thought or mental proposition all the members and parts are mutually related some slightly some more intimately  In communicating such a thought it is not sufficient that the component ideas be clearly expressed it is also necessary that all the relations contained in the thought be expressed according to their different degrees of intimacy To annex a certain meaning to a certain sound or word requires no art The great nicety in all languages is to express the various relations that connect together the parts of the thought Could we suppose this branch of language to be still a secret it would puzzle I am apt to think the greatest grammarian ever existed to invent an expeditious method And yet by the guidance merely of nature the rude and illiterate have been led to a method so perfect that it appears not susceptible of any improvement Without a clear conception of the manner of expressing relations one at every turn must be at a loss about the beauties of language and upon that subject therefore I find it necessary to say a few words  Words that import a relation must be distinguished from those that do not Substantives commonly imply no relation such  as  animal    man    tree    river  Adjectives verbs and adverbs imply a relation The adjective  good  must be connected with some substantive some being possessed of that quality The verb  write  must be applied to some person who writes and the adverbs  moderately    diligently  have plainly a reference to some action which they modify When in language a relative term is introduced all that is necessary to complete the expression is to ascertain that thing to which the term relates For answering this purpose I observe in Greek and Latin two different methods Adjectives are declined as well as substantives and declension serves to ascertain the connection that is betwixt them If the word that expresses the subject be for example in the nominative case so also must the word be that expresses its quality Example  vir bonus  Again verbs are related on the one hand to the agent and on the other to the subject upon which the action is exerted A contrivance similar to that now mentioned serves to express this double relation The nominative case is appropriated to the agent the accusative  to the passive subject and the verb is put in the first second or third person to correspond the more intimately with both Examples  Ego amo Tulliam    tu amas Semproniam    Brutus amat Portiam  The other method is by juxtaposition which is necessary with respect to words only that are not declined adverbs for example articles prepositions and conjunctions In the English language there are few declensions and therefore juxtaposition is our chief resource Adjectives accompany their substantives  Taking advantage of a declension to separate an adjective from its substantive as is commonly practised in Latin though it detract not from perspicuity is certainly less neat than the English method of juxtaposition Contiguity is more expressive of an intimate relation than resemblance merely of the final syllables Latin indeed has evidently the advantage when the adjective and substantive happen to be connected by contiguity as well as by the resemblance of the final syllables  an adverb accompanies the word it qualifies and the verb occupies the middle place betwixt the active and passive subjects to which it relates  It must be obvious that those terms which have nothing relative in their signification  cannot be connected in so easy a manner When two substantives happen to be connected as cause and effect as principal and accessory or in any other manner such connection cannot be expressed by contiguity solely for words must often in a period be placed together which are not thus related The relation betwixt substantives therefore cannot otherwise be expressed than by particles denoting the relation Latin indeed and Greek by their declensions go a certain length to express such relations without the aid of particles The relation of property for example betwixt Caesar and his horse is expressed by putting the latter in the nominative case the former in the genitive  equus Caesaris  The like in English  Caesar's horse  But in other instances declensions not being used in the English language relations of this kind are commonly expressed by prepositions  This form of connecting by prepositions is not confined to substantives Qualities attributes manner of existing or acting and all other circumstances may in the same manner be connected with the substantives  to which they relate This is done artificially by converting the circumstance into a substantive in which condition it is qualified to be connected with the principal subject by a preposition in the manner above described For example the adjective  wise  being converted into the substantive  wisdom  gives opportunity for the expression  "a man  of  wisdom"  instead of the more simple expression  a wise man  This variety in the expression enriches language I observe beside that the using a preposition in this case is not always a matter of choice It is indispensable with respect to every circumstance that cannot be expressed by a single adjective or adverb  To pave the way for the rules of arrangement one other preliminary must be discussed which is to explain the difference betwixt a natural style and that where transposition or inversion prevails There are it is true no precise boundaries betwixt these two for they run into each other like the shades of different colours No person however is at a loss to distinguish them in their extremes and it is necessary to make  the distinction because though some of the rules I shall have occasion to mention are common to both yet each has rules peculiar to itself In a natural style relative words are by juxtaposition connected with those to which they relate going before or after according to the peculiar genius of the language Again a circumstance connected by a preposition follows naturally the word with which it is connected But this arrangement may be varied when a different order is more beautiful A circumstance may be placed before the word with which it is connected by a preposition and may be interjected even betwixt a relative word and that to which it relates When such liberties are frequently taken the style becomes inverted or transposed  But as the liberty of inversion is a capital point in handling the present subject it will be necessary to examine it more narrowly and in particular to trace the several degrees in which an inverted style recedes more and more from that which is natural And first as to the placing a circumstance before the word with which it is connected I observe  that it is the easiest of all inversion even so easy as to be consistent with a style that is properly termed natural Witness the following examples  In the sincerity of my heart I profess  c  By our own ill management we are brought to so low an ebb of wealth and credit that  c  On Thursday morning there was little or nothing transacted in Changealley  At St Bride's church in Fleetstreet Mr Woolston who writ against the miracles of our Saviour in the utmost terrors of conscience made a public recantation  The interjecting a circumstance betwixt a relative word and that to which it relates is more properly termed inversion because by a violent disjunction of words intimately connected it recedes farther from a natural style But this liberty has also degrees for the disjunction is more violent in some cases than in others This I must also explain and to give a just notion of the difference I must crave liberty of my reader to enter a  little more into an abstract subject than would otherwise be my choice  In nature though a substance cannot exist without its qualities nor a quality without a substance yet in our conception of these a material difference may be remarked I cannot conceive a quality but as belonging to some subject it makes indeed a part of the idea which is formed of the subject But the opposite holds not Though I cannot form a conception of a subject devoid of all qualities a partial conception may however be formed of it laying aside or abstracting from any particular quality I can for example form the idea of a fine Arabian horse without regard to his colour or of a white horse without regard to his size Such partial conception of a subject is still more easy with respect to action or motion which is an occasional attribute only and has not the same permanency with colour or figure I cannot form an idea of motion independent of a body but there is nothing more easy than to form an idea of a body at rest Hence it appears that the degree of inversion depends greatly  on the order in which the related words are placed When a substantive occupies the first place we cannot foresee what is to be said of it The idea therefore which this word suggests must subsist in the mind at least for a moment independent of the relative words afterward introduced and if it can so subsist that moment may without difficulty be prolonged by interjecting a circumstance betwixt the substantive and its connections Examples therefore of this kind will scarce alone be sufficient to denominate a style inverted The case is very different where the word that occupies the first place denotes a quality or an action for as these cannot be conceived without a subject they cannot without greater violence be separated from the subject that follows And for that reason every such separation by means of an interjected circumstance belongs to an inverted style  To illustrate this doctrine examples being necessary I shall begin with those where the word first introduced does not imply a relation  Nor Eve to iterate  Her former trespass fear'd  Hunger and thirst at once  Powerful persuaders quicken'd at the scent  Of that alluring fruit urg'd me so keen  Moon that now meet'st the orient sun now fli'st  With the fix'd stars fix'd in their orb that flies  And ye five other wand'ring fires that move  In mystic dance not without song resound  His praise  In the following examples where the word first introduced imports a relation the disjunction will be found more violent  Of man's first disobedience and the fruit  Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste  Brought death into the world and all our wo  With loss of Eden till one greater man  Restore us and regain the blessful seat  Sing heav'nly muse  Upon the firm opacous globe  Of this round world whose first convex divides  The luminous inferior orbs inclos'd  From chaos and th' inroad of darkness old  Satan alighted walks  On a sudden open fly  With impetuous recoil and jarring sound  Th' infernal doors  Wherein remain'd  For what could else to our almighty foe  Clear victory to our part loss and rout  Forth rush'd with whirlwind sound  The chariot of paternal Deity  Language would have no great power were it confined to the natural order of ideas A thousand beauties may be compassed by inversion that must be relinquished in a natural arrangement I shall soon have an opportunity to make this evident In the mean time it ought not to escape observation that the mind of man is happily so constituted as to relish inversion though in one respect unnatural and to relish it so much as in many cases to admit a violent disjunction of words that by the sense are intimately connected I scarce can say that inversion has any limits though I may venture to pronounce that the disjunction of articles conjunctions or prepositions  from the words to which they belong never has a good effect The following example with relation to a preposition is perhaps as tolerable as any of the kind  He would neither separate  from  nor act against them  I give notice to the reader that I am now ready to enter upon the rules of arrangement beginning with a natural style and proceeding gradually to what is the most inverted And in the arrangement of a period as well as in a right choice of words the first and great object being perspicuity it is above laid down as a rule That perspicuity ought not to be sacrificed to any other beauty whatever Ambiguities occasioned by a wrong arrangement are of two sorts one where the arrangement leads to a wrong sense and one where the sense is left doubtful The first being the more culpable shall take the lead beginning with examples of words put in a wrong place  How much the imagination of such a presence must exalt a genius we may observe  merely  from  the influence which an ordinary presence has over men  Characteristics vol p  This arrangement leads to a wrong sense

hand it may be proper to give some account of the rites and ceremonies anciently used at that solemnity and only discontinued through the neglect and degeneracy of later times  Guardian  The term

doubtful beginning as in the former sort with examples of the wrong arrangement of words in a member  These forms of conversation  by degrees  multitiplied and grew troublesome  Spectator N  o    Here

Spectator N  o    Better thus  As this is a truth  c  the English reader if he would see the notion explained at large may find it  c  A woman seldom asks advice before she has bought her

dealing upon credit the honest dealer where fraud is permitted or connived at or hath no law to punish it is always undone and the knave gets the advantage  From these examples the following observation will readily occur that a circumstance ought never to be placed betwixt two capital members of a period for by such situation it must always be doubtful so far as we gather from the arrangement to which of the two members it belongs Where it is interjected as it ought to be betwixt parts of the member to which it belongs the ambiguity is removed and the capital members are kept distinct which is a great beauty in composition In general to preserve members distinct which signify things distinguished in the thought  the sure method is to place first in the consequent member some word that cannot connect with what precedes it  If by any one it shall be thought that the objections here are too scrupulous and that the defect of perspicuity is easily supplied by accurate punctuation the answer is That punctuation may remove an ambiguity but will never produce that peculiar beauty which is felt when the sense comes out clearly and distinctly by means of a happy arrangement Such influence has this beauty that by a natural transition of feeling it is communicated to the very sound of the words so as in appearance to improve the music of the period But as this curious subject comes in more properly afterward it is sufficient at present to appeal to experience that a period so arranged as to bring out the sense clear seems always more musical than where the sense is left in any degree doubtful  A rule deservedly occupying the second place is That words expressing things connected in the thought ought to be placed as near together as possible This rule is  derived immediately from human nature in which there is discovered a remarkable propensity to place together things that are in any manner connected  See chap  Where things are arranged according to their connections we have a sense of order otherwise we have a sense of disorder as of things placed by chance And we naturally place words in the same order in which we would place the things they signify The bad effect of a violent separation of words or members thus intimately connected will appear from the following examples  For the English are naturally fanciful and very often disposed by that gloominess and melancholy of temper which is so frequent in our nation to many wild notions and visions to which others are not so liable  Spectator N  o    Here the verb or assertion is by a pretty long circumstance violently separated from the subject to which it refers This makes a harsh arrangement the less excusable that  the fault is easily prevented by placing the circumstance before the verb or assertion after the following manner  For the English are naturally fanciful and by that gloominess and melancholy of temper which is so frequent in our nation are often disposed to many wild notions  c  For as no mortal author in the ordinary fate and vicissitude of things knows to what use his works may some time or other be applied  c  Spectator N  o    Better thus  For as in

any one have a curiosity for more specimens of this kind they will be found without number in the works of the same author  A pronoun which saves the naming a person or thing a second time ought to be

on the communication of emotions or feelings to related objects a principle in human nature we have had more than one occasion to mention We find this operation even where the objects are not otherwise related than by the juxtaposition of the words that express them Hence to elevate or depress an object one method is to join it in the arrangement  to another that is naturally high or low Witness the following speech of Eumenes to the Roman senate  Causam veniendi sibi Roman fuisse praeter cupiditatem visendi  deos hominesque  quorum beneficio in ea fortuna esset supra quam ne optare

scheme to pay the public debts Swift  Circumstances in a period resemble small stones in a building employ'd to fill up vacancies among those of a larger size In the arrangement of a period such underparts crowded together make a poor figure and never are graceful but when interspersed among the capital parts I shall illustrate this rule by the following example  It is likewise urged that

well as a work is commenced In the progress the mind warms and has a greater relish for matters of importance When a circumstance is placed at the beginning or near the beginning of the period the transition from it to the principal subject is agreeable it is like ascending or mounting upward On the other hand to place it late in the period has a bad effect for after being engaged in  the principal subject one is with reluctance brought down to give attention to a circumstance Hence evidently the preference of the following arrangement  Whether in any country a choice altogether unexceptionable has been made seems doubtful  before this other  Whether a choice altogether unexceptionable has in any country been made  c  For this reason the following period is exceptionable in

makes the greatest figure whether in the beginning during the currency or at the close The breaking silence rouses the attention to what is said and therefore deeper impression is made at the beginning than during the currency The beginning however must yield to the close which being succeeded by a pause affords time for a word to make its deepest impression Hence the following rule That to give the utmost force to a period it ought if possible to be closed with that word which makes the greatest figure The opportunity of a pause should not be thrown away upon accessories but reserved for the principal object in order that it may make a full impression This is an additional reason against closing a period with a circumstance There are however periods that admit not this structure  and in that case the capital word ought if possible to be placed in the front which next to the close is the most advantageous for making an impression Hence in directing our discourse to any man we ought to begin with his name and one will be sensible of a degradation when this rule is neglected as it frequently is for the sake of verse I give the following examples  Integer vitae scelerisque purus  Non eget Mauris jaculi neque arcu  Nec venenatis gravidâ sagittis  Fusce pharetrâ  Horat Carm l ode  Je crains Dieu cher Abner et n'ai point d'autre crainte  In these examples the name of the person addressed to makes a mean figure being like a circumstance slipt into a corner That this criticism is well founded we need no other proof than Addison's translation of the last example  O Abner I fear my God and I fear none but him  Guardian N  o    O father what intends thy hand she cry'd  Against thy only son What fury O son  Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart  Against thy father's head  Paradise Lost book l  Every one must be sensible of a dignity in the invocation at the beginning which that in the middle is far from reaching I mean not however to censure this expression On the contrary it appears beautiful by distinguishing the respect due to a father and to a son  The substance of what is said in this and the foregoing section upon the method of arranging the words of a period so as to make the strongest impression with respect to sound as well as signification is comprehended in the following observation That order of the words in a period will always be the most agreeable where without obscuring the sense the most important images  the most sonorous words and the longest members bring up the rear  Hitherto of arranging single words single members and single circumstances But the enumeration of many particulars in the same period is often necessary and the question is In what order they should be placed It does not seem easy at first view to bring a subject apparently so loose under any general rules But luckily reflecting upon what is said in the first chapter about order we find rules laid down to our hand so as to leave us no harder task than their application to the present question And first with respect to the enumerating a number of particulars of equal rank it is laid down in the place cited that as there is no foundation for preferring any one before the rest it is indifferent to the mind in what order they be viewed And it is only necessary to be added here that for the same reason it is indifferent in what order they be named dly If a number of objects of the same kind differing only in size are to be ranged along a straight  line the most agreeable order to the eye is that of an increasing series In surveying a number of such objects beginning at the least and proceeding to greater and greater the mind swells gradually with the successive objects and in its progress has a very sensible pleasure Precisely for the same reason the words expressive of such objects ought to be placed in the same order The beauty of this figure which may be termed  a climax in sense  has escaped Lord Bolingbroke in the first member of the following period  Let but one great brave disinterested active man arise and he will be received followed and almost adored  The following arrangement has sensibly a better effect  Let but one brave great active disinterested man arise  c  Whether the same rule ought to be followed in enumerating men of different ranks seems doubtful On the one hand a procession  of a number of persons presenting the lowest class first and rising upon the eye in succession till it terminate upon the highest is undoubtedly the most agreeable order On the other hand in every list of names it is customary to set the person of the greatest dignity at the top and to descend gradually through his inferiors Where the purpose is to honour the persons named according to their rank the latter order ought to be followed but every one who regards himself only or his reader will chuse the former order dly As the sense of order directs the eye to descend from the principal to its greatest accessory and from the whole to its greatest part and in the same order through all the parts and accessories till we arrive at the minutest the same order ought to be followed in the enumeration of such particulars I shall give on familiar example Talking of the parts of a column  viz  the base the shaft the capital these are capable of six different arrangements and the question is Which is the best When one has in view the erection of a column he will naturally  be led to express the parts in the order above mentioned which at the same time is agreeable by mounting upward But considering the column as it stands without reference to its erection the sense of order as observed above requires the chief part to be named first For that reason we begin with the shaft and the base comes next in order that we may ascend from it to the capital Lastly In tracing the particulars of any natural operation order requires that we follow the course of nature Historical facts are related in the order of time We begin at the founder of a family and proceed from him to his descendents But in describing a lofty oak we begin with the trunk and ascend to the branches  When force and liveliness of expression are aimed at the rule is to suspend the thought as much as possible and to bring it out full and entire at the close This cannot be done but by inverting the natural arrangement and by introducing a word or member before its time By such inversion our curiosity is raised about what is  to follow and it is agreeable to have our curiosity gratified at the close of the period Such arrangement produceth on the mind an effect similar to a stroke exerted upon the body by the whole collected force of the agent On the other hand where a period is so constructed as to admit more than one complete close in the sense the curiosity of the reader is exhausted at the first close and what follows appears languid or superfluous His disappointment contributes also to this appearance when he finds that contrary to his expectation the period is not yet finished Cicero and after him Quintilian recommend the verb to the last place This method evidently tends to suspend the sense till the close of the period for without the verb the sense cannot be complete And when the verb happens to be the capital word which is frequently the case it ought at any rate to be put last according to another rule above laid down I proceed as usual to illustrate this rule by examples The following period is placed in its natural order  Were instruction an essential circumstance in epic poetry I doubt whether a single instance could be given of this species of composition in any language  The period thus arranged admits a full close upon the word  composition  after which it goes on languidly and closes without force This blemish will be avoided by the following arrangement  Were instruction an essential circumstance in epic poetry I doubt whether in any language a single instance could be given of this species of composition  Some of our most eminent divines have made use of this Platonic notion as far as it regards the subsistence of our passions after death with great beauty and strength of reason  Spectator N  o    Better thus  Some of our most eminent divines have with great beauty and strength of reason made use of this Platonic notion  c  Men of the best sense have been touched more  or less with these groundless horrors and presages of futurity upon surveying the most indifferent works of nature  Spectator N  o    Better  Upon surveying the most indifferent works of nature men of the best sense  c  She soon informed him of the place he was in which notwithstanding all its horrors appeared to him more sweet than the bower of Mahomet in the company of his Balsora  Guardian N  o    Better  She soon  c  appeared to him in the company of his Balsora more sweet  c  The Emperor was so intent on the establishment of his absolute power in Hungary that he exposed the Empire doubly to desolation and ruin for the sake of it  Letters on history vol let Bolingbroke  Better  that for the sake of it he exposed the Empire doubly to desolation and ruin  None of the rules for the composition of periods are more liable to be abused than those last mentioned witness many Latin writers among the moderns especially whose style by inversions too violent is rendered harsh and obscure Suspension of the thought till the close of the period ought never to be preferred before perspicuity Neither ought such suspension to be attempted in a long period because in that case the mind is bewildered among a profusion of words A traveller while he is puzzled about the road relishes not the finest prospects  All the rich presents which Astyages had given him at parting keeping only some Median horses in order to propagate the breed of them in Persia he distributed among his friends whom he left at the court of Ecbatana  Travels of Cyrus book  The foregoing rules concern the arrangement of a single period I shall add one rule more concerning the distribution of a discourse into different periods A short period is lively and familiar A long period  requiring more attention makes an impression grave and solemn In general a writer ought to study a mixture of long and short periods which prevents an irksome uniformity and entertains the mind with variety of impressions In particular long periods ought to be avoided till the reader's attention be thoroughly engaged and therefore a discourse especially of the familiar kind ought never to be introduced with a long period For that reason the commencement of a letter to a very young lady on her marriage is faulty  Madam The hurry and impertinence of receiving and paying visits on account of your marriage being now over you are beginning to enter into a course of life where you will want much advice to divert you from falling into many errors fopperies and follies to which your sex is subject  Swift  See a stronger example in the commencement of Cicero's oration  Pro Archia poeta  Before we proceed farther it may be proper to take a review of the rules laid  down in this and the preceding section in order to make some general observations The natural order of the words and members of a period is undoubtedly the same with the natural order of the ideas that compose the thought The tendency of many of the foregoing rules is to substitute an artificial arrangement in order to reach some beauty either of sound or meaning that cannot be reached in the natural order But seldom it happens that in the same period there is place for a plurality of these rules If one beauty can be catched another must be relinquished The only question is Which ought to be preferred This is a question that cannot be resolved by any general rule But practice supported by a good taste will in most instances make the choice easy The component words and members of a period are ascertained by the subject If the natural order be not relished a few trials will discover that artificial order which has the best effect All that can be said in general is that in making a choice sound ought to yield to signification  The transposing words and members out of their natural order so remarkable in the learned languages has been the subject of much speculation It is agreed on all hands that such transposition or inversion bestows upon a period a very sensible degree of force and elevation and yet writers seem to be at a loss in what manner to account for this effect Cerçeau  Reflections sur la poesie Françoise  ascribes so much power to inversion as to make it the characteristic of French verse and the single circumstance which in that language distinguishes verse from prose And yet he pretends not to say that it hath any other power but to raise surprise he must mean curiosity which is done by suspending the thought during the period and bringing it out entire at the close This indeed is one power of inversion but neither its sole power nor even that which is the most remarkable as is made plain above But waving censure which is not an agreeable task I enter into the matter And I begin with observing that if a conformity betwixt words and their  meaning be agreeable it must of course be agreeable to find the same order or arrangement in both Hence the beauty of a plain or natural style where the order of the words corresponds precisely to the order of the ideas Nor is this the single beauty of a natural style it is also agreeable upon account of its simplicity and perspicuity This observation throws light upon the subject For if a natural style be in itself agreeable a transposed style cannot be so And therefore it cannot otherwise be agreeable but as contributing to some positive beauty which is excluded in a natural style To be confirmed in this opinion we need but reflect upon some of the foregoing rules which make it evident that language by means of inversion is susceptible of many beauties that are totally excluded in a natural arrangement of words From these premisses it clearly follows that inversion ought not to be indulged unless in order to reach some beauty superior to that of a natural style It may with great certainty be pronounced that every inversion which is not governed by  this rule will appear harsh and strained and be disrelished by every one of taste Hence the beauty of inversion when happily conducted the beauty not of an end but of means as furnishing opportunity for numberless ornaments that find no place in a natural style Hence the force the elevation the harmony the cadence of some compositions Hence the manifold beauties of the Greek and Roman tongues of which living languages afford but faint imitations  SECT III Beauty of language from a resemblance betwixt sound and signification  THE resemblance betwixt the sound and signification of certain words is a beauty which has escaped no critical writer and yet is not handled with accuracy by any of them They have probably been erroneously of opinion that a beauty so obvious in the feeling requires no explanation  in the understanding In order to supply this defect I shall give examples of the various resemblances betwixt sound and signification and at the same time shall endeavour to explain why such resemblances are beautiful I begin with examples where the resemblance betwixt the sound and signification is the most entire proceeding to others where the resemblance is less and less so  There being frequently a strong resemblance betwixt different sounds it will not be surprising to find a natural sound imitated by one that is articulate Thus the sound of a bowstring is imitated by the words that express it  The string let fly  Twang'd short and sharp  like the shrill swallow's cry  Odyssey xxi  The sound of felling trees in a wood  Loud sounds the ax redoubling strokes on strokes  On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks  Headlong Deepechoing groan the thickets brown  Then  rustling    crackling    crashing  thunder down  Iliad xxiii  But when loud surges lash the sounding shore  The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar  Pope's Essay on Criticism  No person can be at a loss about the cause of this beauty It is obviously that of imitation  That there is any other natural resemblance betwixt sound and signification must not be taken for granted There is evidently no resemblance betwixt sound and motion nor betwixt sound and sentiment In this matter we are apt to be deceived by artful reading or pronouncing The same passage may be pronounced in many different tones elevated or humble sweet or harsh brisk or melancholy so as to accord with the thought or sentiment Such concord depending on artful pronunciation must be distinguished from that concord betwixt sound and sense which is perceived in some expressions independent of artful pronunciation  The latter is the poet's work the former must be attributed to the reader Another thing contributes still more to the deceit In language sound and sense are so intimately connected as that the properties of the one are readily communicated to the other An emotion of grandeur of sweetness of melancholy or of compassion though occasioned by the thought solely is transferred upon the words which by that means resemble in appearance the thought that is expressed by them  See chap part sect  I have great reason to recommend these observations to my reader considering how inaccurately the present subject is handled by critics Not one of them distinguishes the natural resemblance of sound and signification from the artificial resemblance now described Witness Vida in particular who in a very long passage has given very few examples but what are of the latter kind  Poet L l    That there may be a resemblance betwixt natural and artificial sounds is selfevident  and that in fact there exist such resemblances successfully employ'd by writers of genius is clear from the foregoing examples and many others that might be given But we may safely pronounce that this natural resemblance can be carried no farther The objects of the several senses differ so widely from each other as to exclude any resemblance Sound in particular whether articulate or inarticulate resembles not in any degree taste smell or motion and as little can it resemble any internal sentiment feeling or emotion But must we then agree that nothing but natural sound can be imitated by that which is articulate Taking imitation in its proper sense as involving a resemblance betwixt two objects the proposition must be admitted And yet in many passages that are not descriptive of natural sound every one must be sensible of a peculiar concord betwixt the sound of the words and their meaning As there can be no doubt of the fact what remains is to inquire into its cause  Resembling causes may produce effects that have no resemblance and causes that  have no resemblance may produce resembling effects A magnificent building for example resembles not in any degree an heroic action and yet the emotions they produce being concordant bear a resemblance to each other We are still more sensible of this resemblance in a song where the music is properly adjusted to the sentiment There is no resemblance betwixt thought and sound but there is the strongest resemblance betwixt the emotion raised by music tender and pathetic and that raised by the complaint of an unsuccessful lover To apply these examples to the present subject I observe that the sound even of a single word makes in some instances an impression resembling that which is made by the thing it signifies witness the word  running  composed of two short syllables and more remarkably the words  rapidity    impetuosity    precipitation  Brutal manners produce in the spectator an emotion not unlike what is produced by a harsh and rough sound Hence the figurative expression  rugged  manners an expression peculiarly agreeable by the relation of the sound to the sense  Again the word  little  being pronounced with a very small aperture of the mouth has a weak and faint sound which makes an impression resembling that made by any diminutive object This resemblance of effects is still more remarkable where a number of words are connected together in a period Words pronounced in succession make often a strong impression and when this impression happens to accord with that made by the sense a peculiar pleasure arises The thought or sentiment produces one pleasant emotion the melody or tone of the words produces another But the chief pleasure proceeds from having these two concordant emotions combined in perfect harmony and carried on in the mind to a full close  See chap part  Except in the single case where sound is described all the examples given by critics of sense being imitated in sound resolve into a resemblance of effects Emotions raised by sound and signification may have a resemblance but sound itself cannot have a resemblance to any thing but sound  Proceeding now to particulars and beginning with those cases where the emotions have the strongest resemblance I observe first That in pronouncing a number of syllables in succession an emotion is sometimes raised extremely similar to that raised by successive motion This may be made evident even to those who are defective in taste by the following fact that the term  movement  in all languages is equally apply'd to both In this manner successive motion such as walking running galloping can be imitated by a succession of long or short syllables or by a due mixture of both For example slow motion may be aptly imitated in a verse where long syllables prevail especially when aided by a slow pronunciation  Illi inter sese magnâ vi brachia tollunt  Georg iv  On the other hand swift motion is imitated by a succession of short syllables  Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum  Again  Radit iter liquidum celeres neque commovet alas  Thirdly a line composed of monosyllables makes an impression by the frequency of its pauses similar to what is made by laborious interrupted motion  With many a weary step and many a groan  Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone  Odyssey xi  First march the heavy mules securely slow  O'er hills o'er dales o'er craggs o'er rocks they go  Iliad xxiii  Fourthly the impression made by rough sounds in succession resembles that made by rough or tumultuous motion On the other hand the impression of smooth sounds resembles that of gentle motion The following is an example of both  Two craggy rocks projecting to the main  The roaring wind's tempestuous rage restrain  Within the waves in softer murmurs glide  And ships secure without their haulsers ride  Odyssey iii  Another example of the latter  Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows  And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows  Essay on Crit  Fifthly prolonged motion is expressed in an Alexandrine line The first example shall be of slow motion prolonged  A needless Alexandrine ends the song  That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along  Essay on Crit  The next example is of forcible motion prolonged  The waves behind impel the waves before  Widerolling foaming high and tumbling to the shore  Iliad xiii  The last shall be of rapid motion prolonged  Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain  Flies o'er th' unbending corn and skims along the main  Essay on Crit  Again speaking of a rock torn from the brow of a mountain  Still gath'ring force it smokes and urg'd amain  Whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain  Iliad xiii  Sixthly a period consisting mostly of long syllables that is of syllables pronounced slow produceth an emotion resembling faintly that which is produced by gravity and solemnity Hence the beauty of the following verse  Olli sedato respondit corde Latinus  Seventhly a slow succession of ideas is a circumstance that belongs equally to settled melancholy and to a period composed of polysyllables pronounced slow Hence by similarity of emotions the latter is imitative of the former  In those deep solitudes and awful cells  Where heav'nlypensive Contemplation dwells  And evermusing Melancholy reigns  Pope Eloisa to Abelard  Eighthly a long syllable made short or a short syllable made long raises by the difficulty of pronouncing contrary to custom a feeling similar to that of hard labour  When Ajax strives some rock's  vast  weight to throw  The line too labours and the words move slow  Essay on Crit  Ninthly harsh or rough words pronounced with difficulty excite a feeling resembling that which proceeds from the labour of thought to a dull writer  Just writes to make his barrenness appear  And strains from hardbound brains eight lines ayear  Pope's epistle to Dr Arbuthnot l  I shall close with one other example which of all makes the finest figure In the first section mention is made of a climax in sound and in the second of a climax in  sense It belongs to the present subject to observe that when these coincide in the same passage the concordance of sound and sense is delightful The reader is conscious not only of pleasure from the two climaxes separately but of an additional pleasure from their concordance and from finding the sense so justly imitated by the sound In this respect no periods are more perfect than those borrowed from Cicero in the first section  The concord betwixt sense and sound is not less agreeable in what may be termed an  anticlimax  where the progress is from great to little for this has the effect to make diminutive objects appear still more diminutive Horace affords a striking example  Parturiunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus  The arrangement here is singularly artful The first place is occupied by the verb which is the capital word by its sense as well as sound The close is reserved for the word that is the meanest in sense as well as in sound And it must not be overlooked  that the resembling sounds of the two last syllables give a ludicrous air to the whole  Reviewing the foregoing examples it appears to me contrary to expectation that in passing from the strongest resemblances to those that are fainter the pleasure rises gradually in proportion Can this be accounted for or shall I renounce my taste as capricious When I renew the experiment again and again I feel no wavering but the greatest pleasure constantly from the faintest resemblances And yet how can this be for if the pleasure lie in imitation must not the strongest resemblance afford the greatest pleasure From this vexing dilemma I am happily relieved by reflecting on a doctrine established in the chapter of resemblance and contrast that the pleasure of resemblance is the greatest where it is least expected and where the objects compared are in their capital circumstances widely different Nor will this appear surprising when we descend to familiar examples It raiseth not wonder in the smallest degree to find the most perfect resemblance betwixt two eggs of the same animal It is  more rare to find such resemblance betwixt two human faces and upon that account such an appearance raises some degree of wonder But this emotion rises to a still greater height when we find in a pebble an aggat or any natural production a perfect resemblance to a tree or other organised body We cannot hesitate a moment in applying these observations to the present subject What occasion of wonder can it be to find one sound resembling another where both are of the same kind It is not so common to find a resemblance betwixt an articulate sound and one not articulate and accordingly the imitation here affords some slight pleasure But the pleasure swells greatly when we employ sound to imitate things it resembles not otherwise than by the effects produced in the mind  I have had occasion to observe that to complete the resemblance betwixt sound and sense artful pronunciation contributes not a little Pronunciation therefore may be considered as a branch of the present subject and with some observations upon it I shall conclude the section  In order to give a just idea of pronunciation it must be distinguished from singing The latter is carried on by notes requiring each of them a different aperture of the windpipe The notes properly belonging to the former are expressed by different apertures of the mouth without varying the aperture of the windpipe This however doth not hinder pronunciation to borrow from singing as a man sometimes is naturally led to do in expressing a vehement passion  In reading as in singing there is a keynote Above this note the voice is frequently elevated to make the sound correspond to the elevation of the subject But the mind in an elevated state is disposed to action Therefore in order to a rest it must be brought down to the keynote Hence the term  cadence  The only general rule that can be given for directing the pronunciation is To sound the words in such a manner as to imitate the things they represent or of which they are the symbols The ideas which make the greatest figure ought to be expressed  with a peculiar emphasis In expressing an elevated subject the voice ought to be raised above its ordinary pitch and words signifying dejection of mind ought to be pronounced in a low note A succession of sounds gradually ascending from low to high notes represents an ascending series of objects An opposite succession of sounds is fitted for objects or sentiments that descend gradually In Dryden's ode of  Alexander's feast  the line  Faln    faln    faln    faln  ought to be pronounced with a falling voice and is pronounced in that manner by every one of taste without instruction Another circumstance contributes to the resemblance betwixt sense and sound which is slow or quick pronunciation For though the length or shortness of the syllables with relation to each other be in prose ascertained in some measure and in verse always yet taking a whole line or period together it is arbitrary to pronounce it slow or fast Hence it is that a period expressing what is solemn or deliberate ought to be pronounced slow and ought to be pronounced quick when it expresses  any thing brisk lively or impetuous  The art of pronouncing with propriety and grace being calculated to make the sound an echo to the sense scarce admits of any other general rule than that above mentioned This rule may indeed be branched out into many particular rules and observations but these belong not properly to the present undertaking because they cannot be explained in words We have not words to signify the different degrees of high and low loud and soft fast and slow and before these differences can be made the subject of regular instruction notes must be invented resembling those employ'd in music We have reason to believe that in Greece every tragedy was accompanied with such notes in order to ascertain the pronunciation But the moderns hitherto have not thought of this refinement Cicero indeed  De oratore l cap  without the help of notes pretends to give rules for ascertaining the several tones of voice that are proper in expressing  the several passions and it must be acknowledged that in this attempt he has exhausted the whole power of language At the same time every person of judgement must see that these rules avail little in point of instruction The very words he employs are scarce intelligible except to those who beforehand are acquainted with the subject  To vary the scene a little I propose to close with a slight comparison betwixt singing and pronouncing In this comparison the five following circumstances relative to articulate sound must be kept in view st It is harsh or smooth d A sound or syllable is long or short d It is pronounced high or low th It is pronounced loud or soft And lastly a number of words in succession constituting a period or member of a period are pronounced slow or quick Of these five the first depending on the component letters and the second being ascertained by custom admit not any variety in pronouncing The three last are arbitrary depending on the will of the person who pronounces  and it is chiefly in the artful management of these that just pronunciation consists With respect to the first circumstance music has evidently the advantage for all its notes are agreeable to the ear which is not always the case of articulate sound With respect to the second long and short syllables variously combined produce a great variety of feet yet far inferior to the variety which is found in the multiplied combinations of musical notes With respect to high and low notes pronunciation is still more inferior to singing For it it observed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus  De structura orationis sect  that in pronouncing  i e  without altering the aperture of the windpipe the voice is confined within three notes and a half Singing has a much greater compass With respect to the two last circumstances pronunciation equals singing  In this discourse I have mentioned none of the beauties of language but what arise  from words taken in their proper sense Those beauties that depend on the metaphorical and figurative power of words are reserved to be treated in chap  SECT IV VERSIFICATION  THE music of verse though handled by every grammarian merits more attention than has been given it The subject is intimately connected with human nature and to explain it thoroughly several nice and delicate feelings must be employ'd Entering upon this subject it occurs as a preliminary point By what mark is verse distinguished from prose The discussion of this point is necessary were it for no other purpose but to ascertain the nature and limits of our subject To produce this distinguishing mark is a task not perhaps so easy as may at first be apprehended Verse of every sort has it is true rules for  its construction It is composed of feet the number and variety of which are ascertained Prose though also composed of feet is more loose and scarce subjected to any rules But many are ignorant of these rules Are such left without means to make the distinction And even with respect to the learned must they apply the rule before they can with certainty pronounce whether the composition be prose or verse This will hardly be maintained and therefore instead of rules the ear must be appealed to as the proper judge But what gain we by being thus referred to another standard It still recurs by what mark does the ear distinguish verse from prose The proper and satisfactory answer is That these make different impressions which are readily distinguishable by every one who hath an ear This advances us one step in our inquiry  Taking it then for granted that verse makes upon the ear a different impression from that of prose nothing remains but to explain this difference and to assign its cause To these ends I must call to my  aid an observation made above in treating of the sound of words that they are more agreeable to the ear when composed of long and short syllables than when all the syllables are of the same sort A continued sound in the same tone makes an impression that comes not up to any idea we have of music The same note successively renewed by intervals is more agreeable but still makes not a musical impression To produce this impression variety is necessary as well as number The successive sounds or syllables must be some of them long some of them short and if also high and low the music is the more perfect Now if this impression can be made by single words much more by a plurality in an orderly succession The musical impression made by a period consisting of long and short syllables arranged in a certain order is what the Greeks call  rhythmus  the Latins  numerus  and we  modulation  or  measure  Cicero justly observes that in one continued sound there is no modulation  "Numerus in continuatione nullus est"  But in what follows he is wide of the truth  if by  numerus  he means modulation or musical measure  "Distinctio et aequalium et saepe variorum intervallorum percussio numerum conficit quem in cadentibus guttis quod intervallis distinguuntur notare possumus"  Falling drops whether with equal or unequal intervals are certainly not musical We begin then only to be sensible of a musical expression when the notes are varied And this also was probably the opinion of the author cited though his expression be a little unguarded  From this passage however we discover the etymology of the Latin term for musical expression Every one being sensible that there is no music in a continued sound the first inquiries were probably carried no farther than that to produce a musical expression a number of sounds is necessary and musical expression obtained the name of  numerus  before it was clearly ascertained that variety is necessary as well as number    It will probably occur that modulation so far as connected with long and short syllables combined in a sentence may be found in prose as well as in verse considering especially that in both particular words are accented or pronounced in a  higher tone than ordinary and therefore that the difference betwixt them cannot consist in modulation merely The observation is just and it follows that the distinction betwixt prose and verse since it depends not on modulation merely must arise from the difference of the modulation This is precisely the case though the difference cannot with any accuracy be explained in words Verse is more musical than prose and of the former the modulation is more perfect than of the latter The difference betwixt verse and prose resembles the difference in music properly so called betwixt the song and the recitative And the resemblance is not the less complete that these differences like the shades of colours approximate sometimes so nearly as scarce to be discernible A recitative in its movement approaches sometimes to the liveliness of a song which on the other hand degenerates sometimes toward a plain recitative Nothing is more distinguishable from prose than the bulk of Virgil's hexameters Many of those composed  by Horace are very little removed from prose Sapphic verse has a very sensible modulation That on the other hand of an Iambic is extremely faint  Music properly so called is analysed into melody and harmony A succession of sounds so as to be agreeable to the ear constitutes melody Harmony is the pleasure that arises from coexisting sounds Verse therefore can only reach melody and not harmony    This more perfect modulation of articulate sounds is what distinguisheth verse from prose Verse is subjected to certain inflexible laws The number and variety of the component syllables are ascertained and in some measure the order of succession Such restraint makes it a matter of difficulty to compose in verse a difficulty that is not to be surmounted but by a singular genius Useful lessons of every sort convey'd to us in verse are agreeable by the union of music with instruction But are we for that reason to reject knowledge offered in a plainer dress This would be ridiculous for knowledge may be acquired without music and music is entertaining independent of knowledge Many there are not less willing  than capable to instruct us who have no genius for verse Hence the use of prose which for the reason now given is not confined to precise rules There belongs to it a certain modulation of an inferior kind which being extremely ornamental ought to be the aim of every writer But to succeed in it practice is necessary more than genius Nor are we rigid on this article Provided the work answer its chief end of instruction we are the less solicitous about its dress  Having ascertained the nature and limits of our subject I proceed to the laws by which it is regulated These would be endless were verse of all different kinds to be taken under consideration I propose therefore to confine the inquiry to Latin or Greek hexameter and to French and English heroic verse which perhaps will carry me farther than the reader may chuse to follow The observations I shall have occasion to make will at any rate be sufficient for a specimen and these with proper variations may easily be transferred to the composition of other sorts of verse  Before I enter upon particulars it must  be premised in general that to verse of every kind five things are of importance st The number of syllables that compose a verse d The different lengths of syllables  i e  the difference of time taken in pronouncing d The arrangement of these syllables combined in words th The pauses or stops in pronouncing th Pronouncing syllables in a high or low tone The three first mentioned are obviously essential to verse If any of them be wanting there cannot be that higher degree of modulation which distinguisheth verse from prose To give a just notion of the fourth it must be observed that pauses are necessary for three different purposes One is to separate periods and members of the same period according to the sense another is to improve the modulation of verse and the last is to afford opportunity for drawing breath in reading A pause of the first kind is variable being long or short frequent or less frequent as the sense requires A pause of the second kind is in no degree arbitrary its place being determined by the modulation The last sort again is in a  measure arbitrary depending on the reader's command of breath This sort ought always to coincide with the first or second for one cannot read with grace unless for drawing breath opportunity be taken of a pause in the sense or in the melody and for that reason this pause may be neglected With respect then to the pauses of sense and of melody it may be affirmed without hesitation that their coincidence in verse is a capital beauty But as it cannot be expected in a long work especially that every line should be so perfect we shall afterward have occasion to see that the pause necessary for sense must often in some degree be sacrificed to the versepause and the latter sometimes to the former  The pronouncing syllables in a high or low tone contributes also to melody In reading whether verse or prose a certain tone is assumed which may be called  the keynote  and in this tone the bulk of the words are sounded Sometimes to humour the sense and sometimes the melody a particular syllable is sounded in a higher tone and this is termed  accenting a syllable  or gracing  it with an accent Opposed to the accent is the cadence which I have not mentioned as one of the requisites of verse because it is entirely regulated by the sense and hath no peculiar relation to verse The cadence is a falling of the voice below the keynote at the close of every period and so little is it essential to verse that in correct reading the final syllable of every line is accented that syllable only excepted which closes the period where the sense requires a cadence The reader may be satisfied of this by experiments and for that purpose I recommend to him the  Rape of the Lock  which in point of versification is the most complete performance in the English language Let him consult in particular a period canto beginning at line and closed line with the word  gay  which only of the whole final syllables is pronounced with a cadence He may also examine another period in the th canto which runs from line to line  Though the five requisites above mentioned enter the composition of every species of verse they are however governed by different  rules peculiar to each species Upon quantity only one general observation may be premised because it is applicable to every species of verse Syllables with respect to the time taken in pronouncing are distinguished into long and short two short syllables with respect to time being precisely equal to one long These two lengths are essential to verse of all kinds and to no verse so far as I know is a greater variety of time necessary in pronouncing syllables The voice indeed is frequently made to rest longer than commonly upon a word that bears an important signification But this is done to humour the sense and is not necessary for the modulation A thing not more necessary occurs with respect to accenting similar to that now mentioned A word signifying any thing humble low or dejected is naturally in prose as well as in verse pronounced in a tone below the keynote  We are now sufficiently prepared for entering upon particulars and Latin or Greek Hexameter which are the same coming first in order I shall exhaust what I have to  say upon this species of verse under the four following heads of number arrangement pause and accent for as to quantity so far as concerns the present point what is observed above may suffice  Hexameter lines are with respect to time all of the same length A line may consist of seventeen syllables and when regular and not Spondaic it never has fewer than thirteen Hence it is plain that where the syllables are many the plurality must be short where few the plurality must be long And upon the whole the number of syllables in every line with respect to the time taken in pronouncing are equivalent to twelve long syllables or twentyfour short  With regard to arrangement this line is susceptible of much variety The succession of long and short syllables may be greatly varied without injuring the melody It is subjected however to laws that confine its variety within certain limits For trying the arrangement and for determining whether it be perfect or faulty grammarians have invented a rule by Dactyles and Spondees  which they denominate  feet  One at first view is led to think that these feet are also intended to regulate the pronunciation But this is far from being the case It will appear by and by that the rules of pronunciation are very different And indeed were one to pronounce according to these feet the melody of a Hexameter line would be destroy'd or at best be much inferior to what it is when properly pronounced  After some attention given to this subject and weighing deliberately every circumstance I have been forc'd to rest upon the foregoing conclusion That the Dactyle and Spondee are no other than artificial measures invented for trying the accuracy of composition Repeated experiments convince me that though the sense should be altogether neglected an Hexameter line read by Dactyles and Spondees will not be melodious And the composition of an Hexameter line demonstrates this to be true without necessity of an experiment It will appear afterward that in an Hexameter line there must always be a capital pause at the end of the fifth long syllable reckoning as above two short for one long And when we measure this line by Dactyles and Spondees the pause now mentioned divides always a Dactyle or a Spondee it never falls in at the end of either of these feet Hence it is evident that if a line be pronounced as it is scanned by Dactyles and Spondees the pause must be utterly neglected which consequently must destroy the melody because a pause is essential to the melody of an Hexameter verse If on the other hand the melody be preserved by making this pause the pronouncing by Dactyles and Spondees must be abandoned  What has led grammarians into the use of Dactyles and Spondees seems not beyond the reach of conjecture To produce melody the latter part of a Hexameter line consisting of a Dactyle and a Spondee must be read according to these feet in this part of the line the Dactyle and Spondee are distinctly expressed in the pronunciation This discovery joined with another that the foregoing part of the verse could be measured by the same feet has led grammarians to adopt these artificial measures and perhaps rashly to conclude that the pronunciation is directed by these feet as well as the composition The Dactyle and Spondee at the close serve indeed the double purpose of regulating the pronunciation as well as the composition but in the foregoing part of the line they regulate the composition only not the pronunciation  If we must have feet in verse to regulate the pronunciation and consequently the melody these feet must be determined by the pauses The whole syllables interjected betwixt two pauses ought to be deemed one musical foot because to preserve the melody they must all be pronounced together without any stop And therefore whatever number there are of pauses in a Hexameter line the parts into which it is divided by these pauses make just so many musical feet  Connection obliges me here to anticipate by observing that the same doctrine is applicable to English heroic verse Considering its composition merely it is of two kinds One is composed of five Iambi and one of a Trochaeus followed by four Iambi But these feet afford no rule for pronouncing The musical feet are obviously those parts of the line that are interjected betwixt two pauses To bring out the melody these feet must be expressed in the pronunciation or which comes to the same the pronunciation must be directed by the pauses without regard to the Iambus or Trochaeus  These feet then must be confined to their  sole province of regulating the arrangement for they serve no other purpose They are withal so artificial and complex that neglecting them altogether I am tempted to substitute in their room other rules more simple and of more easy application for example the following st The line must always commence with a long syllable and close with two long preceded by two short d More than two short can never be  found in any part of the line nor fewer than two if any And d Two long syllables which have been preceded by two short cannot also be followed by two short These few rules fulfil all the conditions of a Hexameter line with relation to order or arrangement To these again a single rule may be substituted for which I have a still greater relish as it regulates more affirmatively the construction of every part That I may put this rule into words with the  greater facility I take a hint from the twelve long syllables that compose an Hexameter line to divide it into twelve equal parts or portions being each of them one long syllable or two short This preliminary being established the rule is shortly what follows The st d th th th th and th portions must each of them be one long syllable the th must always be two short syllables the d th th and th may indifferently be one long or two short Or to express the thing still more curtly The d th th and th portions may be one long syllable or two short the th must be two short syllables all the rest must consist of one long syllable This fulfils all the conditions of an Hexameter line and comprehends all the combinations of Dactyles and Spondees that this line admits  Next in order comes the pause At the end of every Hexameter line no ear but must be sensible of a complete close or full pause This effect is produced by the following  means Every line invariably is finished with two long syllables preceded by two short a fine preparation for a full close Syllables pronounced slow resemble a slow and languid motion tending to rest The mind put in the same tone by the pronunciation is naturally disposed to a pause And to this disposition the two preceding short syllables contribute for these by contrast make the slow pronunciation of the final syllables the more conspicuous Beside this complete close or full pause at the end others are also requisite for the sake of melody I discover two clearly and perhaps there may be more The longest and most remarkable succeeds the th portion according to the foregoing measure The other which being more faint may be called  the semipause  succeeds the th portion So striking is the pause first mentioned as to be distinguished even by the rudest ear The monkish rhymes are evidently built upon it In these it is an invariable rule to make the final word chime with that which immediately precedes the pause  De planctu cudo ‖ mitrum cum carmine nudo  Mingere cum bumbis ‖ res est soluberrima lumbis  The difference of time in the pause and semipause occasions another difference not less remarkable The pause ought regularly to be at the end of a word but it is lawful to divide a word by a semipause The bad effect of dividing a word by the pause is sensibly felt in the following examples  Effusus labor at‖que inmitis rupta Tyranni  Again  Observans nido im‖plumes detraxit at illa  Again  Loricam quam De‖moleo detraxerat ipse  The dividing a word by a semipause has not the same bad effect  Jamque pedem referens ‖ casus evaserat omnes  Again  Qualis populea ‖ moerens Philomela sub umbra  Again  Ludere quae vellem ‖ calamo permisit agresti  Lines however where words are left entire to be pronounced as they ought to be without being divided even by a semipause run by that means much the more sweetly  Nec gemere aërea ‖ cessabit turtur ab ulmo  Again  Quadrupedante putrem ‖ sonitu quatit ungula campum  Again  Eurydicen toto ‖ referebant flumine ripae  The reason of these observations will be evident upon the slightest reflection Betwixt things so intimately connected as sense and sound in pronunciation to find discordance is unpleasant to the ear and for that reason it is a matter of importance to make the musical pauses coincide as much as possible with those of the sense This is requisite more especially with respect  to the pause A deviation from the rule is less remarkable in a semipause which makes but a slight impression Considering the matter as to modulation solely it is indifferent whether the pauses be at the end of words or in the middle But when we carry the sense along nothing is more disagreeable than to find a word split into two parts neither of which separately have any meaning This bad effect though it regard the sense only is by an easy transition of ideas transferred to the sound with which the sense is intimately connected and by this means we conceive a line to be harsh and grating to the ear which in reality is only so to the understanding  See chap part sect    To the rule which places the pause after the th portion there is one exception and no more If the syllable succeeding the th portion be short the pause is sometimes postponed to it  Pupillis quos dura ‖ premit custodia matrum  Again  In terris oppressa ‖ gravi sub religione  Again  Et quorum pars magna ‖ fui quis talia fando  This contributes to diversify the melody and where the words are smooth and liquid is not ungraceful as in the following examples  Formosam resonare ‖ doces Amaryllida sylvas  Again  Agricolas quibus ipsa ‖ procul discordibus armis  If this pause postponed as aforesaid to the short syllable happen also to divide a word the melody by these circumstances is totally annihilated witness the following line of Ennius which is plain prose  Romae moenia terru‖it impiger Hannibal armis  Hitherto the arrangement of the long and short syllables of an Hexameter line and  its different pauses have been considered with respect to melody But to have a just notion of Hexameter verse these particulars must also be considered with respect to sense There is not perhaps in any other sort of verse such a latitude in the long and short syllables This circumstance contributes greatly to that richness of modulation which is remarkable in Hexameter verse and which makes Aristotle pronounce that an epic poem in any other sort would not succeed  Poet cap  One defect however must not be dissembled The same means that contribute to the richness of the melody render it less fit than several other sorts for a narrative poem With regard to the melody as above observed there cannot be a more artful contrivance than to close an Hexameter line with two long syllables preceded by two short But unhappily this construction proves a great imbarrassment to the sense as will be evident from what follows As in general there ought to be a strict concordance betwixt every thought  and the words in which it is dressed so in particular every close in the sense complete and incomplete ought to be accompanied with a similar close in the sound In the composition of prose there is sufficient latitude for applying this rule in the strictest manner But the same strictness in verse would occasion insuperable difficulties Some share of the concordance betwixt thought and expression may be justly sacrificed to the melody of verse and therefore during the course of a line we freely excuse the want of coincidence of the musical pause with that of the sense But the close of an Hexameter line is too conspicuous to admit a total neglect of this coincidence And hence it follows that there ought to be always some pause in the sense at the end of every Hexameter line were it but such a pause as is marked with a comma It follows also for the same reason that there ought never to be a full close in the sense but at the end of a line because there the modulation is closed An Hexameter line to preserve its melody cannot well permit any greater relaxation  and yet in a narrative poem it is extremely difficult to keep up to the rule even with these indulgences Virgil the greatest poet for versification that ever existed is forc'd often to end a line without any close in the sense and as often to close the sense during the running of a line though a close in the melody during the movement of the thought or a close in the thought during the movement of the melody cannot fail to be disagreeable  The accent to which we proceed is not less essential than the other circumstances above handled By a good ear it will be discerned that in every line there is one syllable distinguishable from the rest by a strong accent This syllable making the th portion is invariably long and in point of time occupies a place nearly at an equal distance from the pause which succeeds the th portion and the semipause which succeeds the th  Nec bene promeritis ‖ capitûr nec tangitur ira  Again  Non sibi sed toto ‖ genitûm se credere mundo  Again  Qualis spelunca ‖ subitô commota columba  In these examples the accent is laid upon the last syllable of a word And that this is a favourable circumstance for the melody will appear from the following consideration In reading there must be some pause after every word to separate it from what follows and this pause however short supports the accent Hence it is that a line thus accented has a more spirited air than where the accent is placed on any other syllable Compare the foregoing lines with the following  Alba neque Assyrio ‖ fucâtur lana veneno  Again  Panditur interea ‖ domus ômnipotentis Olympi  Again  Olli sedato ‖ respôndit corde Latinus  In lines where the pause comes after the short syllable succeeding the th portion the accent is displaced and rendered less sensible It seems to be split into two and to be laid partly on the th portion and partly on the th its usual place as in  Nuda genu nodôque ‖ sinûs collecta fluentes  Again  Formosam resonâre ‖ docês Amaryllida sylvas  Beside this capital accent slighter accents are laid upon other portions particularly upon the th unless where it consists of two short syllables upon the th which is always a long syllable and upon the th where the line concludes with a monosyllable Such conclusion by the by lessens the melody and for that reason is not to be indulged unless where it is expressive of the sense The following lines are marked with all the accents  Ludere quae vêllem calamô permîsit agresti  Again  Et durae quêrcus sudâbunt rôscida mella  Again  Parturiunt môntes nascêtur rîdiculûs mus  Inquiring into the melody of Hexameter verse we soon discover that order or arrangement doth not constitute the whole of it Comparing different lines equally regular as to the succession of long and short syllables the melody is found in very different degrees of perfection Nor does the difference arise from any particular combination of Dactyles and Spondees or of long and short syllables On the contrary we find lines where Dactyles prevail and lines where Spondees prevail equally melodious Of the former take the following instance  Aeneadum genetrix hominum divumque voluptas  Of the latter  Molli paulatim flavescet campus arista  What can be more different as to melody  than the two following lines which however as to the succession of long and short syllables are constructed precisely in the same manner  Ad ta  Spond  los stola  Dact  dimis  Spond  sa et  Spond  circumdata  Dact  palla  Spond    Hor  Placat  Spond  umque ni  Dact  tet di  Spond  ffuso  Spond  lumine  Dact  coelum  Spond    Lucret  In the former the pause falls in the middle of a word which is a great blemish and the accent is disturbed by a harsh elision of the vowel  a  upon the particle  et  In the latter the pauses and the accent are all of them distinct and full there is no elision and the words are more liquid and sounding In these particulars consists the beauty of an Hexameter line with respect to melody and by neglecting these many lines in the Satires and Epistles of Horace are less agreeable than plain prose for they are neither the one nor the other in perfection To make these lines sound they must be pronounced without relation to the sense It must not be regarded that words are divided  by pauses nor that harsh elisions are multiplied To add to the account prosaic low sounding words are introduced and which is still worse accents are laid on them Of such faulty lines take the following instances  Candida rectaque sit munda hactenus sit neque longa  Jupiter exclamat simul atque audirit at in se  Custodes lectica ciniflones parasitae  Optimus est modulator ut Alfenus Vafer omni  Nunc illud tantum quaeram meritone tibi sit  Next in order comes English heroic verse which shall be examined under the whole five heads of number quantity arrangement pause and accent This verse sometimes employs rhymes and sometimes not which distinguishes it into two kinds one named  metre  and one  blank verse  In the former the lines are connected two and two by similarity of sound in the final syllables and such connected lines are termed  couplets  Similarity of sound being avoided in the latter banishes couplets These two sorts must be handled separately because there  are many peculiarities in each The first article with respect to rhyme or metre shall be discussed in a few words Every line consists of ten syllables five short and five long There are but two exceptions both of them rare A couplet can bear to be drawn out by adding a short syllable at the end of each of the two lines  There hero's wits are kept in pond'rous vases  And beau's in snuffboxes and tweezercases  The piece you think is incorrect Why take it  I'm all submission what you'd have it make it  This licence is sufferable in a single couplet but if frequent would soon become disgustful  The other exception concerns the second line of a couplet which is sometimes stretched out to twelve syllables termed an  Alexandrine line  A needless Alexandrine ends the song  That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along  It doth extremely well when employ'd to close a period with a certain pomp and solemnity suitable to the subject  With regard to the second article it is unnecessary to mention a second time that the quantities employ'd in verse are but two the one double of the other that every syllable is reducible to one or other of these standards and that a syllable of the larger quantity is termed  long  and of the lesser quantity  short  It belongs more to the present article to examine what peculiarities there may be in the English language as to long and short syllables In every language there are syllables that may be pronounced long or short at pleasure but the English above all abounds in syllables of that kind In words of three or more syllables the quantity for the most part is invariable The exceptions are more frequent in dissyllables but as to monosyllables they may without many exceptions be pronounced either long or short Nor is the ear hurt by this liberty being accustomed to the variation of quantity in the same word This shows that the melody of English  verse must depend less upon quantity than upon other circumstances In that particular it differs widely from Latin verse There every syllable having but one sound strikes the ear constantly with its accustomed impression and a reader must be delighted to find a number of such syllables disposed so artfully as to raise a lively sense of melody Syllables variable in quantity cannot possess this power Custom may render familiar both a long and short pronunciation of the same word but the mind constantly wavering betwixt the two sounds cannot be so much affected with a syllable of this kind as with one which bears always the same sound What I have further to say upon quantity will come in more properly under the following head of arrangement  And with respect to arrangement which may be brought within a narrow compass the English heroic line is commonly Iambic the first syllable short the second long and so on alternately through the whole line One exception there is pretty frequent Many lines commence with a  Trochaeus  viz  a long and a short syllable But this affects not the order of the following syllables These go on alternately as usual one short and one long The following couplet affords an example of each kind  Sōme ĭn thĕ fīelds ŏf pūrĕst ǣthĕr plāy  Ănd bāsk ănd whītĕn īn thĕ blāze ŏf dāy  It is unhappy in the construction of English verse that it excludes the bulk of polysyllables though the most sounding words in our language for upon examination it will be found that very few of them are composed of such alternation of long and short syllables as to correspond to either of the arrangements mentioned English verse accordingly is almost totally reduced to dissyllables and monosyllables  Magnanimity  is a sounding word totally excluded  Impetuosity  is still a finer word by the resemblance of the sound and sense and yet a negative is put upon it as well as upon numberless words of the same kind Polysyllables composed of syllables long and short alternately make a good figure in  verse for example  observance    opponent    ostensive    pindaric    productive    prolific  and such others of three syllables  Imitation    imperfection    misdemeanour    mitigation    moderation    observator    ornamental    regulator  and others similar of four syllables beginning with two short syllables the third long and the fourth short may find a place in a line commencing with a Trochaeus I know not if there be any of five syllables One I know of six  viz misinterpretation  But words so composed are not frequent in our language  One would not imagine without trial how uncouth false quantity appears in verse not less than a provincial tone or idiom The article  the  is one of the few monosyllables that is invariably short See how harsh it makes a line where it must be pronounced long  Thĭs nymph tŏ thē dĕstrūctiŏn ōf mănkīnd  Again  Th'ădvēnt'rŏus bārŏn thē brĭght lōcks ădmīr'd  Let the article be pronounced short and it reduces the melody almost to nothing Better so however than a false quantity In the following examples we perceive the same defect  And old impertinence ‖ expel by new  With varying vanities ‖ from ev'ry part  Love in these labyrinths ‖ his slaves detains  New stratagems ‖ the radiant lock to gain  Her eyes halflanguishing ‖ halfdrown'd in tears  Roar'd for the handkerchief ‖ that caus'd his pain  Passions like elements ‖ though born to fight  The great variety of modulation conspicuous in English verse will be found upon trial to arise chiefly from the pauses and accents and therefore these circumstances are of greater importance than is commonly thought There is a degree of intricacy in this branch of our subject and it will require some pains to give a distinct view of it But we must not be discouraged by difficulties The pause which paves the way to the accent offers itself first to our examination From a very short trial the following  facts will be verified st A line admits but one capital pause d In different lines we find this pause after the fourth syllable after the fifth after the sixth and after the seventh These particulars lay a solid foundation for dividing English heroic lines into four sorts distinguished by the different places of the pause Nor is this an idle distinction On the contrary unless it be kept in view we cannot have any just notion of the richness and variety of English versification Each sort or order hath a melody peculiar to itself readily distinguishable by a good ear and in the sequel I am not without hopes to make the cause of this peculiarity sufficiently evident It must be observed at the same time that the pause cannot be made indifferently at any of the places mentioned It is the sense that regulates the pause as will be seen more fully afterward and consequently it is the sense that determines of what order every line must be There can be but one capital musical pause in a line and this pause ought to coincide if possible  with a pause in the sense in order that the sound may accord with the sense  What is said must be illustrated by examples of each sort or order And first of the pause after the fourth syllable  Back through the paths ‖ of pleasing sense I ran  Again  Profuse of bliss ‖ and pregnant with delight  After the th  So when an angel ‖ by divine command  With rising tempests ‖ shakes a guilty land  After the th  Speed the soft intercourse ‖ from soul to soul  Again  Then from his closing eyes ‖ thy form shall part  After the th  And taught the doubtful battle ‖ where to rage  Again  And in the smooth description ‖ murmur still  Beside the capital pause now mentioned other inferior or semipauses will be discovered by a nice ear Of these there are commonly two in each line one before the capital pause and one after it The former is invariably placed after the first long syllable whether the line begin with a long syllable or a short The other in its variety imitates the capital pause In some lines it follows the th syllable in some the th and in some the th Of these semipauses take the following examples  st and th  Led through a sad ‖ variety of wo  st and th  Still on that breast ‖ enamour'd let me lie  d and th  From storms a shelter ‖ and from heat a shade  d and th  Let wealth let honour ‖ wait the wedded dame  d and th  Above all pain ‖ all passion and all pride  Even from these few examples it appears that the place of the last semipause like that of the full pause is directed in a good measure by the sense Its proper place with respect to the melody is after the eighth syllable so as to finish the line with an Iambus distinctly pronounced which by a long syllable after a short is a preparation for rest If this hold the placing this semipause after the th or after the th syllable must be directed by the sense in order to avoid a pause in the middle of a word or betwixt two words intimately connected and so far melody is justly sacrificed to sense  In discoursing of the full pause in a Hexameter line it is laid down as a rule That it ought never to divide a word Such licence deviates too far from the connection  that ought to be betwixt the pauses of sense and of melody And in an English line it is for the same reason equally wrong to divide a word by a full pause Let us justify this reason by experiments  A noble super‖fluity it craves  Abhor a perpe‖tuity should stand  Are these lines distinguishable from prose Scarcely I think  The same rule is not applicable to a semipause which being short and faint is not sensibly disagreeable when it divides a word  Relentless walls ‖ whose darksome round contains  For her white virgins ‖ hymeneals sing  In these deep solitudes ‖ and awful cells  It must however be acknowledged that the melody here suffers in some degree A word ought to be pronounced without any rest betwixt its component syllables The  semipause must bend to this rule and thereby vanisheth almost altogether  With regard to the capital pause it is so essential to the melody that a poet cannot be too nice in the choice of its place in order to have it full clear and distinct It cannot be placed more happily than with a pause in the sense and if the sense require but a comma after the fourth fifth sixth or seventh syllable there can be no difficulty about this musical pause But to make such coincidence essential would cramp versification too much and we have experience for our authority that there may be a pause in the melody where the sense requires none We must not however imagine that a musical pause may be placed at the end of any word indifferently Some words like syllables of the same word are so intimately connected as not to bear a separation even by a pause No good poet ever attempted to separate a substantive from its article the dividing such intimate companions would be harsh and unpleasant The following line for example  cannot be pronounced with a pause as marked  If Delia smile the ‖ flow'rs begin to spring  But ought to be pronounced in the following manner  If Delia smile ‖ the flow'rs begin to spring  If then it be not a matter of indifferency where to make the pause there ought to be rules for determining what words may be separated by a pause and what are incapable of such separation I shall endeavour to unfold these rules not chiefly for their utility but in order to exemplify some latent principles that tend to regulate our taste even where we are scarce sensible of them And to that end it seems the eligible method to run over the verbal relations beginning with the most intimate The first that presents itself is that of adjective and substantive being the relation of substance and quality the most intimate of all A quality cannot exist independent of a substance nor is it separable from it even in imagination because they  make parts of the same idea and for that reason it must with regard to melody be disagreeable to bestow upon the adjective a sort of independent existence by interjecting a pause betwixt it and its substantive I cannot therefore approve the following lines nor any of the sort for to my taste they are harsh and unpleasant  Of thousand bright ‖ inhabitants of air  The sprites of fiery ‖ termagants inflame  The rest his manycolour'd ‖ robe conceal'd  The same his ancient ‖ personage to deck  Ev'n here where frozen ‖ Chastity retires  I sit with sad ‖ civility I read  Back to my native ‖ moderation slide  Or shall we ev'ry ‖ decency confound  Time was a sober ‖ Englishman wou'd knock  And place on good ‖ security his gold  Taste that eternal ‖ wanderer which flies  But ere the tenth ‖ revolving day was run  First let the just ‖ equivalent be paid  Go threat thy earthborn ‖ Myrmidons but here  Haste to the fierce ‖ Achilles' tent he cries  All but the everwakeful ‖ eyes of Jove  Your own resistless ‖ eloquence employ  I have upon this article multiplied examples that in a case where I have the misfortune to dislike what passes current in practice every man upon the spot may judge by his own taste The foregoing reasoning it is true appears to me just it is however too subtile to afford conviction in opposition to taste  Considering this matter in a superficial view one might be apt to imagine that it must be the same whether the adjective go first which is the natural order or the substantive which is indulged by the laws of inversion But we soon discover this to be a mistake Colour cannot be conceived independent of the surface coloured but a tree may be conceived as growing in a certain spot as of a certain  kind and as spreading its extended branches all around without ever thinking of the colour In a word qualities though related all to one subject may be considered separately and the subject may be considered with some of its qualities independent of others though we cannot form an image of any single quality independent of the subject Thus then though an adjective named first be inseparable from the substantive the proposition does not reciprocate An image can be formed of the substantive independent of the adjective and for this reason they may be separated by a pause when the former is introduced before the latter  For thee the fates ‖ severely kind ordain  And curs'd with hearts ‖ unknowing how to yield  The verb and adverb are precisely in the same condition with the substantive and adjective An adverb which expresses a certain modification of the action expressed by the verb is not separable from it even in imagination And therefore I must also give up the following lines  And which it much ‖ becomes you to forget  'Tis one thing madly ‖ to disperse my store  But an action may be conceived leaving out a particular modification precisely as a subject may be conceived leaving out a particular quality and therefore when by inversion the verb is first introduced it has no bad effect to interject a pause betwixt it and the adverb which follows This may be done at the close of a line where the pause is at least as full as that is which divides the line  While yet he spoke the Prince advancing drew  Nigh to the lodge  c  The agent and its action come next expressed in grammar by the active substantive and its verb Betwixt these placed in their natural order there is no difficulty of interjecting a pause An active being is not always in motion and therefore it is easily separable in idea from its action When in a sentence the substantive takes the lead we know not that action is to follow and  as rest must precede the commencement of motion this interval is a proper opportunity for a pause  On the other hand when by inversion the verb is placed first is it lawful to separate it by a pause from the active substantive I answer not because an action is not in idea separable from the agent more than a quality from the substance to which it belongs Two lines of the first rate for beauty have always appeared to me exceptionable upon account of the pause thus interjected betwixt the verb and the consequent substantive and I have now discovered a reason to support my taste  In these deep solitudes and awful cells  Where heav'nlypensive ‖ Contemplation dwells  And evermusing ‖ Melancholy reigns  The point of the greatest delicacy regards the active verb and the passive substantive placed in their natural order On the one side it will be observed that these words signify things which are not separable in idea Killing cannot be conceived without  some being that is put to death nor painting without a surface upon which the colours are spread On the other side an action and the thing on which it is exerted are not like substance and quality united in one individual subject The active subject is perfectly distinct from that which is passive and they are connected by one circumstance only that the action exerted by the former is exerted upon the latter This makes it possible to take the action to pieces and to consider it first with relation to the agent and next with relation to the patient But after all so intimately connected are the parts of the thought that it requires an effort to make a separation even for a moment The subtilising to such a degree is not agreeable especially in works of imagination The best poets however taking advantage of this subtilty scruple not to separate by a pause an active verb from its passive subject Such pauses in a long work may be indulged but taken singly they certainly are not agreeable I appeal to the following examples  The peer now spreads ‖ the glitt'ring forfex wide  As ever sully'd ‖ the fair face of light  Repair'd to search ‖ the gloomy cave of Spleen  Nothing to make ‖ philosophy thy friend  Shou'd chance to make ‖ the welldress'd rabble stare  Or cross to plunder ‖ provinces the main  These madmen never hurt ‖ the church or state  How shall we fill ‖ a library with wit  What better teach ‖ a foreigner the tongue  Sure if I spare ‖ the minister no rules  Of honour bind me not to maul his tools  On the other hand when the passive subject by inversion is first named there is no difficulty of interjecting a pause betwixt it and the verb more than when the active subject is first named The same reason holds in both that though a verb cannot be separated in idea from the substantive which governs it and scarcely from the substantive it governs yet a substantive  may always be conceived independent of the verb When the passive subject is introduced before the verb we know not that an action is to be exerted upon it therefore we may rest till the action commences For the sake of illustration take the following examples  Shrines where their vigils ‖ paleey'd virgins keep  Soon as thy letters ‖ trembling I unclose  No happier task ‖ these faded eyes pursue  What is said about placing the pause leads to a general observation which I shall have occasion for afterwards The natural order of placing the active substantive and its verb is more friendly to a pause than the inverted order But in all the other connections inversion affords by far a better opportunity for a pause Upon this depends one of the great advantages that blank verse hath over rhyme The privilege of inversion in which it far excels rhyme gives it a much greater choice of pauses than can be had in the natural order of arrangement  We now proceed to the slighter connections which shall be discussed in one general article Words connected by conjunctions and prepositions freely admit a pause betwixt them which will be clear from the following instances  Assume what sexes ‖ and what shape they please  The light militia ‖ of the lower sky  Connecting particles were invented to unite in a period two substantives signifying things occasionally united in the thought but which have no natural union And betwixt two things not only separable in idea but really distinct the mind for the sake of melody chearfully admits by a pause a momentary disjunction of their occasional union  One capital branch of the subject is still upon hand to which I am directed by what is just now said It concerns those parts of speech which singly represent no idea and which become not significant till they be joined to other words I mean conjunctions  prepositions articles and such like accessories passing under the name of  particles  Upon these the question occurs Whether they can be separated by a pause from the words that make them significant Whether for example in the following lines the separation of the accessory preposition from the principal substantive be according to rule  The goddess with ‖ a discontented air  And heighten'd by ‖ the diamond's circling rays  When victims at ‖ you altar's foot we lay  So take it in ‖ the very words of Creech  An ensign of ‖ the delegates of Jove  Two ages o'er ‖ his native realm he reign'd  While angels with ‖ their silver wings o'ershade  Or separating the conjunction from the word it connects with what goes before  Talthybius and ‖ Eurybates the good  It will be obvious at the first glance that the foregoing reasoning upon objects naturally  connected are not applicable to words which of themselves are mere ciphers We must therefore have recourse to some other principle for solving the present question These particles out of their place are totally insignificant To give them a meaning they must be joined to certain words The necessity of this junction together with custom forms an artificial connection which has a strong influence upon the mind It cannot bear even a momentary separation which destroys the sense and is at the same time contradictory to practice Another circumstance tends still more to make this separation disagreeable The long syllable immediately preceding the full pause must be accented for this is required by the melody as will afterward appear But it is ridiculous to accent or put an emphasis upon a low word that raises no idea and is confined to the humble province of connecting words that raise ideas And for that reason a line must be disagreeable where a particle immediately precedes the full pause for such construction  of a line makes the melody discord with the sense  Hitherto we have discoursed upon that pause only which divides the line Are the same rules applicable to the concluding pause This must be answered by making a distinction In the first line of a couplet the concluding pause differs little if at all from the pause which divides the line and for that reason the rules are applicable to both equally The concluding pause of the couplet is in a different condition it resembles greatly the concluding pause in a Hexameter line Both of them indeed are so remarkable that they never can be graceful unless when they accompany a pause in the sense Hence it follows that a couplet ought always to be finished with some close in the sense if not a point at least a comma The truth is that this rule is seldom transgressed In Pope's works upon a cursory search indeed I found but the following deviations from the rule  Nothing is foreign parts relate to whole  One allextending allpreserving soul  Connects each being  Another  To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs  To steal from rainbows ere they drop in show'rs  A brighter wash  But now supposing the connection to be so slender as to admit a pause it follows not that a pause may always be put There is one rule to which every other ought to bend That the sense must never be wounded or obscured by the music and upon that account I condemn the following lines  Ulysses first ‖ in public cares she found  And  Who rising high ‖ th'imperial sceptre rais'd  With respect to inversion it appears both from reason and experiments that many words which cannot bear a separation in their natural order admit a pause when inverted And it may be added that when  two words or two members of a sentence in their natural order can be separated by a pause such separation can never be amiss in an inverted order An inverted period which runs cross to the natural train of ideas requires to be marked in some measure even by pauses in the sense that the parts may be distinctly known Take the following examples  As with cold lips ‖ I kiss'd the sacred veil  With other beauties ‖ charm my partial eyes  Full in my view ‖ set all the bright abode  With words like these ‖ the troops Ulysses rul'd  Back to th' assembly roll ‖ the thronging train  Not for their grief ‖ the Grecian host I blame  The same where the separation is made at the close of the first line of the couplet  For spirits freed from mortal laws with ease  Assume what sexes and what shapes they please  The pause is tolerable even at the close of the couplet for the reason just now suggested  that inverted members require some slight pause in the sense  'Twas where the planetree spread its shades around  The altars heav'd and from the crumbling ground  A mighty dragon shot  Thus a train of reasoning hath insensibly led us to conclusions with regard to the musical pause very different from those in the first section concerning the separating by an interjected circumstance words intimately connected One would conjecture that whereever words are separable by interjecting a circumstance they should be equally separable by interjecting a pause But upon a more narrow inspection the appearance of analogy vanisheth To make this evident I need only premise that a pause in the sense distinguishes the different members of a period from each other that two words of the same member may be separated by a circumstance all the three making still but one member and therefore that a pause in the sense has no connection with the separation of words by interjected  circumstances This sets the matter in a clear light It is observed above that the musical pause is intimately connected with the pause in the sense so intimately indeed that regularly they ought to coincide As this would be too great a restraint a licence is indulged to place pauses for the sake of the music where they are not necessary for the sense But this licence must be kept within bounds And a musical pause ought never to be placed where a pause is excluded by the sense as for example betwixt the adjective and following substantive which make parts of the same idea and still less betwixt a particle and the word which makes it significant  Abstracting at present from the peculiarity of modulation arising from the different pauses it cannot fail to be observed in general that they introduce into our verse no slight degree of variety Nothing more fatigues the ear than a number of uniform lines having all the same pause which is extremely remarkable in the French versification This imperfection will be discerned by a fine ear even in the shortest succession  and becomes intolerable in a long poem Pope excels all the world in the variety of his modulation which indeed is not less perfect of its kind than that of Virgil  From what is now said there ought to be one exception Uniformity in the members of a thought demands equal uniformity in the members of the period which expresses that thought When therefore resembling objects or things are expressed in a plurality of verselines these lines in their structure ought to be as uniform as possible and the pauses in particular ought all of them to have the same place Take the following examples  By foreign hands ‖ thy dying eyes were clos'd  By foreign hands ‖ thy decent limbs compos'd  By foreign hands ‖ thy humble grave adorn'd  Again  Bright as the sun ‖ her eyes the gazers strike  And like the sun ‖ they shine on all alike  Speaking of Nature or the God of Nature  Warms in the sun ‖ refreshes in the breeze  Glows in the stars ‖ and blossoms in the trees  Lives through all life ‖ extends through all extent  Spreads undivided ‖ operates unspent  Pauses are like to dwell longer upon hand than I imagined for the subject is not yet exhausted It is laid down above that English heroic verse considering melody only admits no more than four capital pauses and that the capital pause of every line is determined by the sense to be after the fourth the fifth the sixth or seventh syllable And that this doctrine holds true so far as melody alone is concerned every good ear will bear testimony At the same time examples are not unfrequent in Milton especially of the capital pause being after the first the second or the third syllable And that this licence may be taken even gracefully when it adds vigour to the expression I readily admit So far the sound may be justly sacrificed to the sense or expression That this licence may be successfully taken  will be clear from the following example Pope in his translation of Homer describes a rock broke off from a mountain and hurling to the plain in the following words  From steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds  At every shock the crackling wood resounds  Still gath'ring force it smocks and urg'd amain  Whirls leaps and thunders down impetuous to the plain  There stops ‖ So Hector Their whole force he prov'd  Resistless when he rag'd and when he stopt unmov'd  In the penult line the proper place of the musical pause is at the end of the fifth syllable but it enlivens the expression by its coincidence with that of the sense at the end of the second syllable The stopping short before the usual pause in the melody aids the impression that is made by the description of the stone's stopping short And what is lost to the melody by this artifice is more than compensated by the force that is added to the description  Milton makes a happy use of this licence witness the following examples from his  Paradise Lost  Thus with the year  Seasons return but not to me returns  Day ‖ or the sweet approach of even or morn  Celestial voices to the midnightair  Sole ‖ or responsive each to others note  And over them triumphant Death his dart  Shook ‖ but delay'd to strike  And wild uproar  Stood rul'd ‖ stood vast infinitude confin'd  And hard'ning in his strength  Glories ‖ for never since created man  Met such embodied force  From his slack hand the garland wreath'd for Eve  Down drop'd ‖ and all the faded roses shed  Of unessential night receives him next  Wide gaping ‖ and with utter loss of being  Threatens him  c  For now the thought  Both of lost happiness and lasting pain  Torments him ‖ round he throws his baleful eyes  c  If we consider the foregoing passages with respect to melody singly the pauses are undoubtedly out of their proper place But being united with those of the sense they inforce the expression and enliven it greatly And the beauty of expression is communicated to the sound which by a natural deception makes even the melody appear more perfect than if the musical pauses were regular  To explain the rules of accenting two general observations must be premised The first is That accents have a double effect They contribute to the melody by giving it air and spirit they contribute not less to the sense by distinguishing important words from others These two effects ought never to be separated If a musical accent be put where the sense rejects it we feel a discordance betwixt the thought and  the melody An accent for example placed on a word that makes no figure has the effect to burlesk it by giving it an unnatural elevation The injury thus done to the sense is communicated to the melody by the intimacy of connection and both seem to be wounded This rule is applicable in a peculiar manner to particles It is indeed ridiculous to put an emphasis on a word which of itself has no meaning and like cement serves only to unite words significant The other general observation is That a word of whatever number of syllables is not accented upon more than one of them Nor is this an arbitrary practice The object represented by the word is set in its best light by a single accent reiterated accents on different syllables in succession make not the emphasis stronger but have an air as if the sound only of the accented syllables were regarded and not the sense of the word  Keeping in view the foregoing observations the doctrine of accenting English heroic verse is extremely simple In the first place accenting is confined to the long  syllables for the melody admits not an accent upon any short syllable In the next place as the melody is inriched in proportion to the number of accents every word that has a long syllable ought to be accented unless where the accent is rejected by the sense a word as observed that makes no figure by its signification cannot bear an accent According to this rule a line may admit five accents a case by no means rare  But supposing every long syllable to be accented there is constantly in every line one accent which makes a greater figure than the rest This capital accent is that which precedes the capital pause Hence it is distinguishable into two kinds one that is immediately succeeded by the pause and one that is divided from the pause by a short syllable The former belongs to lines of the first and third order the latter to those of the second and fourth Examples of the first kind  Smooth flow the wâves ‖ the zephyrs gently play  Belinda smîl'd ‖ and all the world was gay  He rais'd his azure wând ‖ and thus begun  Examples of the second  There lay three gârters ‖ half a pair of gloves  And all the trôphies ‖ of his former loves  Our humble prôvince ‖ is to tend the fair  Not a less plêasing ‖ though less glorious care  And hew triumphal ârches ‖ to the ground  These accents make different impressions on the mind which will be the subject of a following speculation In the mean time it may be safely pronounced a capital defect in the composition of verse to put a low word incapable of an accent in the place where this accent should be This bars the accent altogether and I know no other fault more subversive of the melody if it be not that of barring a pause altogether I may add affirmatively that it is a capital beauty in the composition of verse to have the most important word of the sentence so placed as that this capital accent may be laid upon it No single circumstance contributes more to the energy of verse than to  have this accent on a word that by the importance of its meaning is intitled to a peculiar emphasis To show the bad effect of excluding the capital accent I refer the reader to some instances given above p where particles are separated by a pause from the capital words that make them significant and which particles ought for the sake of the melody to be accented were they capable of an accent Add to these the following instances from the Essay on Criticism  Oft leaving what ‖ is natural and fit  line  Not yet purg'd off ‖ of spleen and sour disdain  l  No pardon vile ‖ obscenity should find  l  When love was all ‖ an easy monarch's care  l  For 'tis but half ‖ a judge's task to know  l  'Tis not enough ‖ taste judgement learning join  l  That only makes ‖ superior sense belov'd  l  Whose right it is ‖ uncensur'd to be dull  l  'Tis best sometimes ‖ your censure to restrain  l  When this fault is at the end of the line that closes a couplet it leaves not the least trace of melody  But of this frame the bearings and the ties  The strong connections nice dependencies  In a line expressive of what is humble or dejected it improves the resemblance betwixt the sound and sense to exclude the capital accent This to my taste is a beauty in the following lines  In thêse deep sôlitudes ‖ and aŵful cells  The pôor inhâbitant ‖ behôlds in vain  To conclude this article the accents are not like the syllables confined to a certain number Some lines have no fewer than  five and there are lines that admit not above one This variety as we have seen depends entirely on the different powers of the component words Particles even where they are long by position cannot be accented and polysyllables whatever space they occupy admit but one accent Polysyllables have another defect that they generally exclude the full pause I have shown above that few polysyllables can find place in the construction of English verse Here are reasons for excluding them could they find place  I am now prepared to fulfil a promise concerning the four sorts of lines that enter into English heroic verse That these have each of them a peculiar melody distinguishable by a good ear I ventured to suggest and promised to account for and though this subject is extremely delicate I am not without hopes of making good my engagement First however like a wary general I take all advantages the ground will permit I do not aver that this peculiarity of modulation is in every instance perceptible  Far from it The impression made by a period whether it be verse or prose is occasioned chiefly by the thought and in an inferior degree by the words and these articles are so intimately united with the melody that they have each of them a strong influence upon the others With respect to the melody in particular instances are without number of melody in itself poor and weak passing for rich and spirited where it is supported by the thought and expression I am therefore intitled to insist that this experiment be tried upon lines of equal rank And to avoid the perplexity of various cases I must also insist that the lines chosen for a trial be regularly accented before the pause for upon a matter abundantly refined in itself I would not willingly be imbarrassed with faulty and irregular lines These preliminaries being adjusted I begin with some general observations that will save repeating the same thing over and over upon each particular case And first an accent succeeded by a pause makes sensibly a deeper impression than where the voice goes on without  a stop to make an impression requires time and there is no time where there is no pause The fact is so certain that in running over a few lines there is scarce an ear so dull as not readily to distinguish from others that particular accent which immediately precedes the full pause In the next place the elevation of an accenting tone produceth in the mind a similar elevation which is continued during the pause Every circumstance is different where the pause is separated from the accent by a short syllable The impression made by the accent is more slight when there is no stop and the elevation of the accent is gone in a moment by the falling of the voice in pronouncing the short syllable that follows The pause also is sensibly affected by the position of the accent In lines of the first and third order the close conjunction of the accent and pause occasions a sudden stop without preparation which rouses the mind and bestows on the melody a spirited air When on the other hand the pause is separated from the accent by a short syllable which always happens in  lines of the second and fourth order the pause is soft and gentle This short unaccented syllable succeeding one that is accented must of course be pronounced with a falling voice which naturally prepares for a pause The mind falls gently from the accented syllable and slides into rest as it were insensibly Further the lines themselves derive different powers from the position of the pause A pause after the fourth syllable divides the line into two unequal portions of which the largest comes last This circumstance resolving the line into an ascending series makes an impression in pronouncing like that of mounting upward And to this impression contributes the redoubled effort in pronouncing the largest portion which is last in order The mind has a different feeling when the pause succeeds the fifth syllable The line being divided into two equal parts by this pause these parts pronounced with equal effort are agreeable by their uniformity A line divided by a pause after the sixth syllable makes an impression opposite to that first mentioned Being divided into two unequal  portions of which the shortest is last in order it appears like a slow descending series and the second portion being pronounced with less effort than the first the diminished effort prepares the mind for rest And this preparation for rest is still more sensibly felt where the pause is after the seventh syllable as in lines of the fourth order  No person can be at a loss in applying these observations A line of the first order is of all the most spirited and lively To produce this effect several of the circumstances above mentioned concur The accent being followed instantly by a pause makes an illustrious figure the elevated tone of the accent elevates the mind the mind is supported in its elevation by the sudden unprepared pause which rouses and animates and the line itself representing by its unequal division an ascending series carries the mind still higher making an impression similar to that of mounting upward The second order has a modulation sensibly sweet soft and flowing The accent is not so sprightly as in the former because a  short syllable intervenes betwixt it and the pause its elevation by the same means vanisheth instantaneously the mind by a falling voice is gently prepared for a stop and the pleasure of uniformity from the division of the line into two equal parts is calm and sweet The third order has a modulation not so easily expressed in words It in part resembles the first order by the liveliness of an accent succeeded instantly by a full pause But then the elevation occasioned by this circumstance is balanced in some degree by the remitted effort in pronouncing the second portion which remitted effort has a tendency to rest Another circumstance distinguisheth it remarkably Its capital accent comes late being placed on the sixth syllable and this circumstance bestows on it an air of gravity and solemnity The last order resembles the second in the mildness of its accent and softness of its pause It is still more solemn than the third by the lateness of its capital accent It also possesses in a higher degree than the third the tendency to rest and by that circumstance is of all the best qualified  for closing a period in the completest manner  But these are not all the distinguishing characters of the different orders Each order also by means of its final accent and pause makes a peculiar impression so peculiar as to produce a melody clearly distinguishable from that of the others This peculiarity is occasioned by the division which the capital pause makes in a line By an unequal division in the first order the mind has an impression of ascending and is left at the close in the highest elevation which is display'd on the concluding syllable By this means a strong emphasis is naturally laid upon the concluding syllable whether by raising the voice to a sharper tone or by expressing the word in a fuller tone This order accordingly is of all the least proper for concluding a period where a cadence is proper and not an accent In the second order the final accent makes not so capital a figure There is nothing singular in its being marked by a pause for this is common to all the orders and this order being destitute of the impression  of ascent cannot rival the first order in the elevation of its accent nor consequently in the dignity of its pause for these always have a mutual influence This order however with respect to its close maintains a superiority over the third and fourth orders In these the close is more humble being brought down by the impression of descent and by the remitted effort in pronouncing considerably in the third order and still more considerably in the last According to this description the concluding accents and pauses of the four orders being reduced to a scale will form a descending series probably in an arithmetical progression  After what is said will it be thought refining too much to suggest that the different orders are qualified for different purposes and that a poet of genius will be naturally led to make a choice accordingly I cannot think this altogether chimerical It appears to me that the first order is proper for a sentiment that is bold lively or impetuous that the third order is proper for subjects grave solemn or lofty the second for  what is tender delicate or melancholy and in general for all the sympathetic emotions and the last for subjects of the same kind when tempered with any degree of solemnity I do not contend that any one order is fitted for no other task than that assigned it At that rate no sort of modulation would be left for accompanying ordinary thoughts that have nothing peculiar in them I only venture to suggest and I do it with diffidence that one order is peculiarly adapted to certain subjects and better qualified than the others for expressing such subjects The best way to judge is by experiment and to avoid the imputation of a partial search I shall confine my instances to a single poem beginning with the first order  On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore  Which Jews might kiss and Infidels adore  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose  Quick as her eyes and as unfix'd as those  Favours to none to all she smiles extends  Oft she rejects but never once offends  Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike  And like the sun they shine on all alike  Yet graceful ease and sweetness void of pride  Might hide her faults if belles had faults to hide  If to her share some female errors fall  Look on her face and you'll forget 'em all  Rape of the Lock  In accounting for the remarkable liveliness of this passage it will be acknowledged by every one who has an ear that the modulation must come in for a share The lines all of them are of the first order a very unusual circumstance in the author of this poem so eminent for variety in his versification Who can doubt that in this passage he has been led by delicacy of taste to employ the first order preferably to the others  Second order  Our humbler province is to tend the fair  Not a less pleasing though less glorious care  To save the powder from too rude a gale  Nor let th' imprison'd essences exhale  To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs  To steal from rainbows ere they drop their show'rs  c  Again  Oh thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate  Too soon dejected and too soon elate  Sudden these honours shall be snatch'd away  And curs'd for ever this victorious day  Third order  To fifty chosen sylphs of special note  We trust th'important charge the petticoat  Again  Oh say what stranger cause yet unexplor'd  Could make a gentle belle reject a lord  A plurality of lines of the fourth order would not have a good effect in succession because by a remarkable tendency to rest its proper office is to close a period The reader therefore must be satisfied with instances where this order is mixed with others  Not louder shrieks to pitying Heav'n are cast  When husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last  Again  Steel could the works of mortal pride confound  And hew triumphal arches to the ground  Again  She sees and trembles at th' approaching ill  Just in the jaws of ruin and codille  Again  With earnest eyes and round unthinking face  He first the snuffbox open'd then the case  And this suggests another experiment which is to set the different orders more directly in opposition by giving examples where they are mixed in the same passage  First and second orders  Sol through white curtains shot a tim'rous ray  And ope'd those eyes that must eclipse the day  Again  Not youthful kings in battle seiz'd alive  Not scornful virgins who their charms survive  Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss  Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss  Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die  Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry  E'er felt such rage resentment and despair  As thou sad virgin for thy ravish'd hair  First and third  Think what an equipage thou hast in air  And view with scorn two pages and a chair  Again  What guards the purity of melting maids  In courtly balls and midnightmasquerades  Safe from the treach'rous friend the daring spark  The glance by day the whisper in the dark  Again  With tender billetdoux he lights the pyre  And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire  Then prostrate falls and begs with ardent eyes  Soon to obtain and long possess the prize  Again  Jove's thunder roars heav'n trembles all around  Blue Neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound  Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs the ground gives way  And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day  Second and third  Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found  Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound  Again  On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head  Which with a sigh she rais'd and thus she said  Musing on the foregoing subject I begin to doubt whether I have not been all this while in a reverie Here unexpectedly a sort of fairyscene opens where every object is new and singular Is there any truth in the appearance or is it merely a work of imagination The scene seems to be a reality and if it can bear examination it must exalt greatly the melody of English heroic verse If uniformity prevail in the arrangement in the equality of the lines and in the resemblance of the final sounds variety is still more conspicuous in the pauses and accents  which are diversified in a surprising manner The beauty that results from combined objects is justly observed to consist in a due mixture of uniformity and variety  See chap  Of this beauty many instances have already occurred but none more illustrious than English versification However rude it may be by the simplicity of arrangement it is highly melodious by its pauses and accents so as already to rival the most perfect species known in Greece or Rome And it is no disagreeable prospect to find it susceptible of still greater refinement  We proceed to blank verse which hath so many circumstances in common with rhyme that what is necessary to be said upon it may be brought within a narrow compass With respect to form it differs not from rhyme farther than in rejecting the jingle of similar sounds But let us not think this difference a trifle or that we gain nothing by it but the purifying our  verse from a pleasure so childish In truth our verse is extremely cramped by rhyme and the great advantage of blank verse is that being free from the fetters of rhyme it is at liberty to attend the imagination in its boldest flights Rhyme necessarily divides verse into couplets each couplet makes a complete musical period the parts of which are divided by pauses and the whole summed up by a full close at the end the modulation begins anew with the next couplet and in this manner a composition in rhyme proceeds couplet after couplet I have more than once had occasion to observe the influence that sound and sense have upon each other by their intimate union If a couplet be a complete period with regard to the melody it ought regularly to be so also with regard to the sense This it is true proves too great a cramp upon composition and licences are indulged as explained above These however must be used with discretion so as to preserve some degree of uniformity betwixt the sense and the music  There ought never to be a full close in the sense but at the end of a couplet and there ought always to be some pause in the sense at the end of every couplet The same period as to sense may be extended through several couplets but in this case each couplet ought to contain a distinct member distinguished by a pause in the sense as well as in the sound and the whole ought to be closed with a complete cadence Rules such as these must confine rhyme within very narrow bounds A thought of any extent cannot be reduced within its compass The sense must be curtailed and broken into pieces to make it square with the curtness of melody and it is obvious that short periods afford no latitude for inversion I have examined this point with the greater accuracy in order to give a just notion of blank verse and to show that a slight difference in form may produce a very great difference in substance Blank verse has the same pauses and accents with rhyme and a pause at the end of every line like what concludes the first line of a couplet In a word the rules of  melody in blank verse are the same that obtain with respect to the first line of a couplet But luckily being disengaged from rhyme or in other words from couplets there is access to make every line run into another precisely as the first line of a couplet may run into the second There must be a musical pause at the end of every line but it is not necessary that it be accompanied with a pause in the sense The sense may be carried on through different lines till a period of the utmost extent be completed by a full close both in the sense and the sound There is no restraint other than that this full close be at the end of a line This restraint is necessary in order to preserve a coincidence betwixt sense and sound which ought to be aimed at in general and is indispensable in the case of a full close because it has a striking effect Hence the aptitude of blank verse for inversion and consequently the lustre of its pauses and accents for which as observed above there is greater scope in inversion than when words run in their natural order  In the second section of this chapter it is shown that nothing contributes more than inversion to the force and elevation of language The couplets of rhyme confine inversion within narrow limits Nor would the elevation of inversion were there access for it in rhyme be extremely concordant with the humbler tone of that sort of verse It is universally agreed that the loftiness of Milton's style supports admirably the sublimity of his subject and it is not less certain that the loftiness of his style arises chiefly from inversion Shakespear deals little in inversion But his blank verse being a sort of measured prose is perfectly well adapted to the stage Laboured inversion is there extremely improper because in dialogue it never can appear natural  Hitherto I have considered the advantage of laying aside rhyme with respect to that superior power of expression which verse acquires thereby But this is not the only advantage of blank verse It has another not less signal of its kind and that is of a more extensive and more complete melody  Its music is not like that of rhyme confined to a single couplet but takes in a great compass so as in some measure to rival music properly so called The intervals betwixt its cadences may be long or short at pleasure and by this means its modulation with respect both to richness and variety is superior far to that of rhyme and superior even to that of the Greek and Latin Hexameter Of this observation no person can doubt who is acquainted with the  Paradise Lost  In that work there are indeed many careless lines but at every turn it shines out in the richest melody as well as in the sublimest sentiments Take the following specimen  Now Morn her rosy steps in th'eastern clime  Advancing sow'd the earth with orient pearl  When Adam wak'd so custom'd for his sleep  Was aëry light from pure digestion bred  And temp'rate vapours bland which th' only sound  Of leaves and fuming rills Aurora's fan  Lightly dispers'd and the shrill matin song  Of birds on every bough so much the more  His wonder was to find unwaken'd Eve  With tresses discompos'd and glowing cheek  As through unquiet rest he on his side  Leaning halfrais'd with looks of cordial love  Hung over her enamour'd and beheld  Beauty which whether waking or asleep  Shot forth peculiar graces then with voice  Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes  Her hand soft touching whisper'd thus Awake  My fairest my espous'd my latest found  Heav'n's last best gift my ever new delight  Awake the morning shines and the fresh field  Calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring  Our tended plants how blows the citron grove  What drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed  How Nature paints her colours how the bee  Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet  Book l  Comparing the Latin Hexameter and English heroic rhyme the former has obviously the advantage in the following particulars It is greatly preferable as to arrangement by the latitude it admits in placing the long and short syllables Secondly the length of an Hexameter line hath a majestic air ours by its shortness is indeed more brisk and lively but much less fitted for the sublime And thirdly the long highsounding  words that Hexameter admits add greatly to its majesty To compensate these advantages English rhyme possesses a greater number and greater variety both of pauses and of accents These two sorts of verse stand indeed pretty much in opposition in the Hexameter great variety of arrangement none in the pauses or accents in the English rhyme great variety in the pauses and accents very little in the arrangement  In blank verse are united in a good measure the several properties of Latin Hexameter and English rhyme and it possesses beside many signal properties of its own It is not confined like a Hexameter by a full close at the end of every line nor like rhyme by a full close at the end of every couplet This form of construction which admits the lines to run into each other gives it a still greater majesty than arises from the length of a Hexameter line By the same means it admits inversion even beyond the Latin or Greek Haxameter which suffer some confinement by the regular closes at the end of every line In  its music it is illustrious above all The melody of Hexameter verse is circumscribed to a line and of English rhyme to a couplet The melody of blank verse is under no confinement but enjoys the utmost privilege of which the melody of verse is susceptible and that is to run hand in hand with the sense In a word blank verse is superior to the Hexameter in many articles and inferior to it in none save in the latitude of arrangement and in the use of long words  In the French heroic verse there are found on the contrary all the defects of the Latin Hexameter and English rhyme without the beauties of either Subjected to the bondage of rhyme and to the full close at the end of each couplet it is further peculiarly disgustful by the uniformity of its pauses and accents The line invariably is divided by the pause into two equal parts and the accent is invariably placed before the pause  Jeune et vaillant herôs ‖ dont la haute sagesse  Ne'st point la fruit tardîf ‖ d'une lente vieillesse  Here every circumstance contributes to a most tedious uniformity A constant return of the same pause and of the same accent as well as an equal division of every line by which the latter part always answers to the former and fatigues the ear without intermission or change I cannot set this matter in a better light than by presenting to the reader a French translation of the following passage of Milton  Two of far nobler shape erect and tall  Godlike erect with native honour clad  In naked majesty seem'd lords of all  And worthy seem'd for in their looks divine  The image of their glorious Maker shon  Truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure  Severe but in true filial freedom plac'd  Whence true authority in men though both  Not equal as their sex not equal seem'd  For contemplation he and valour form'd  For softness she and sweet attractive grace  He for God only she for God in him  Were the pauses of the sense and sound in this passage but a little better assorted nothing in verse could be more melodious In  general the great defect of Milton's versification in other respects admirable is the want of coincidence betwixt the pauses of the sense and sound  The translation is in the following words  Ce lieu délicieux ce paradis charmant  Reçoit deux objets son plus bel ornement  Leur port majestueux et leur démarche altiere  Semble leur meriter sur la nature entiere  Ce droit de commander que Dieu leur a donné  Sur leur auguste front de gloire couronné  Du souverain du ciel drille la resemblance  Dans leur simples regards éclatte l'innocence  L'adorable candeur l'aimable vérité  La raison la sagesse et la sévérité  Qu'adoucit la prudence et cet air de droiture  Du visage des rois respectable parure  Ces deux objets divins n'ont pas les mêmes traits  Ils paroissent formés quoique tous deux parfaits  L'un pour la majesté la force et la noblesse  L'autre pour la douceur la grace et la tendresse  Celuici pour Dieu seul l'autre pour l'homme encor  Here the sense is fairly translated the words are of equal power and yet how inferior the melody  I take the liberty to add here a speculation which though collateral only arises naturally from the subject and shall be discussed in a few words Many attempts have been made to introduce Hexameter verse into the living languages but without success The English language I am inclined to believe is not susceptible of this melody and my reasons are these First the polysyllables in Latin and Greek are finely diversified by long and short syllables a circumstance that qualifies them for the melody of Hexameter verse Ours are extremely ill qualified for this service because they superabound in short syllables Secondly the bulk of our monosyllables are arbitrary with regard to length which is an unlucky circumstance in Hexameter Custom as observed above may render familiar a long or short pronunciation of the same word but the mind wavering betwixt the two sounds cannot be so much affected with either as with a word that hath always the same sound and for that reason arbitrary sounds are ill fitted for a melody which is chiefly supported  by quantity In Latin and Greek Hexameter invariable sounds direct and ascertain the melody English Hexameter would be destitute of melody unless by artful pronunciation because of necessity the bulk of its sounds must be arbitrary The pronunciation is easy in a simple movement of alternate short and long syllables but would be perplexing and unpleasant in the diversified movement of Hexameter verse  Rhyme makes so great a figure in modern poetry as to deserve a solemn trial I have for that reason reserved it to be examined with some deliberation in order to discover if possible its peculiar beauties and the degree of merit it is intitled to The first view of this subject leads naturally to the following reflection  "That rhyme having no relation to sentiment nor any effect upon the ear other than a mere jingle ought to be banished all compositions of any dignity as affording but a trifling and childish pleasure"  It will also be observed  "That a jingle of words  hath in some measure a ludicrous effect witness the celebrated poem of  Hudibras  the double rhymes of which contribute no small share to its drollery that this effect would be equally remarkable in a serious work were it not obscured by the nature of the subject that having however a constant tendency to give a ludicrous air to the composition it requires more than ordinary fire to support the dignity of the sentiments against such an undermining anotagonist  Vossius  de poematum cantu  p says  "Nihil aeque gravitati orationis officit quam in sono ludere syllabarum"  "  These arguments are specious and have undoubtedly some weight Yet on the other hand it ought to be considered that rhyme in later times has become universal among men as well as children and that to give it a currency it must have some foundation in human nature In fact it has been successfully employ'd by poets of genius in their serious and grave compositions as well as in those which are more light and airy Here in weighing authority  against argument the balance seems to hang pretty even and therefore to come at any thing decisive we must pierce a little deeper  Music has great power over the soul and may be successfully employ'd to inflame or sooth our passions if not actually to raise them A single sound however sweet is not music but a single sound repeated after proper intervals may have an effect upon the mind by rousing the attention and keeping the hearer awake A variety of similar sounds succeeding each other after regular intervals must have a still stronger effect This is applicable to rhyme which consists in the connection that two verselines have by closing with two words similar in sound And considering deliberately the effect that this may have we find that it rouses the attention and produceth an emotion moderately gay without dignity or elevation Like the murmurings of a brook gliding through pebbles it calms the mind when perturbed and gently raises it when sunk These effects are scarce perceived when the whole  poem is in rhyme but are extremely remarkable by contrast in the couplets which close the several acts of our later tragedies The tone of the mind is sensibly varied by them from anguish distress or melancholy to some degree of ease and alacrity For the truth of this observation I appeal to the speech of Jane Shore in the fourth act when her doom was pronounced by Glo'ster to the speech of Lady Jane Gray at the end of the first act and to that of Calista in the  Fair Penitent  when she leaves the stage about the middle of the third act The speech of Alicia at the close of the fourth act of  Jane Shore  puts the matter beyond doubt In a scene of deep distress the rhymes which finish the act produce a certain gaiety and chearfulness far from according with the tone of the passion  Alicia  For ever Oh For ever  Oh who can bear to be a wretch for ever  My rival too his last thoughts hung on her  And as he parted left a blessing for her  Shall she be bless'd and I be curs'd for ever  No since her fatal beauty was the cause  Of all my suff'rings let her share my pains  Let her like me of ev'ry joy forlorn  Devote the hour when such a wretch was born  Like me to deserts and to darkness run  Abhor the day and curse the golden sun  Cast ev'ry good and ev'ry hope behind  Detest the works of nature loathe mankind  Like me with cries distracted fill the air  Tear her poor bosom and her frantic hair  And prove the torments of the last despair  Having described the best way I can the impression that rhyme makes on the mind I proceed to examine whether rhyme be proper for any subject and to what subjects in particular it is best suited Great and elevated subjects which have a powerful influence claim justly the precedence in this inquiry In the chapter of grandeur and sublimity it is established that a grand or sublime object inspires a warm enthusiastic emotion disdaining strict regularity and order This observation is applicable to the present point The moderatelyenlivening music of rhyme gives a tone to the mind very different from that of grandeur and sublimity Supposing then  an elevated subject to be expressed in rhyme what must be the effect The intimate union of the music with the subject produces an intimate union of their emotions one inspired by the subject which tends to elevate and expand the mind and one inspired by the music which confining the mind within the narrow limits of regular cadency and similar sound tends to prevent all elevation above its own pitch Emotions so little concordant cannot in union have a happy effect  But it is scarce necessary to reason upon a case that never did and probably never will happen  viz  an important subject clothed in rhyme and yet supported in its utmost elevation A happy thought or warm expression may at times give a sudden bound upward but it requires a genius greater than has hitherto existed to support a poem of any length in a tone much more elevated than that of the melody Tasso and Ariosto ought not to be made exceptions and still less Voltaire And after all where the poet has the dead weight of rhyme constantly to struggle with how  can we expect an uniform elevation in a high pitch when such elevation with all the support it can receive from language requires the utmost effort of the human genius  But now admitting rhyme to be an unfit dress for grand and lofty images it has one advantage however which is to raise a low subject to its own degree of elevation Addison  Spectator N  o    observes  "That rhyme without any other assistance throws the language off from prose and very often makes an indifferent phrase pass unregarded but where the verse is not built upon rhymes there pomp of sound and energy of expression are indispensably necessary to support the style and keep it from falling into the flatness of prose"  This effect of rhyme is remarkable in the French verse which being simple and natural and in a good measure unqualified for inversion readily sinks down to prose where it is not artificially supported Rhyme by rousing the mind raises it somewhat above the  tone of ordinary language rhyme therefore is indispensable in the French tragedy and may be proper even for their comedy Voltaire  Preface to his  O Edipus  and in his discourse upon tragedy prefixed to the tragedy of  Brutus  assigns this very reason for adhering to rhyme in these compositions He indeed candidly owns that even with the support of rhyme the tragedies of his country are little better than conversationpieces This shows that the French language is weak and an improper dress for any grand subject Voltaire was sensible of this imperfection and yet Voltaire attempted an epic poem in that language  The chearing and enlivening power of rhyme is still more remarkable in poems of short lines where the rhymes return upon the ear in a quick succession And for that reason rhyme is perfectly well adapted to gay light and airy subjects Witness the following  O the pleasing pleasing anguish  When we love and when we languish  Wishes rising  Thoughts surprising  Pleasure courting  Charms transporting  Fancy viewing  Joys ensuing  O the pleasing pleasing anguish  Rosamond act sc  For this reason such frequent rhymes are very improper for any severe or serious passion the dissonance betwixt the subject and the modulation is very sensibly felt Witness the following  Ardito ti renda  T'accenda  Di sdegno  D'un figlio  Il periglio  D'un regno  L' amor  E' dolce ad un' alma  Che aspetta  Vendetta  Il perder la calma  Fra l'ire del cor  Metastasio Artaserse act sc  Rhyme is not less unfit for deep distress than for subjects elevated and lofty and for that reason has been long disused in the English and Italian tragedy In a work where the subject is serious though not elevated it has not a good effect because the airiness of the modulation agrees not with the gravity of the subject The  Essay on Man  which treats a subject great and important would show much better in blank verse Sportive love mirth gaiety humour and ridicule are the province of rhyme The boundaries assigned it by nature were extended in barbarous and illiterate ages and in its usurpations it has long been protected by custom But taste in the fine arts as well as in morals improves daily and makes a progress slowly indeed but uniformly towards perfection and there is no reason to doubt that rhyme in Britain will in time be forc'd to abandon its unjust conquests and to confine itself within its natural limits  Having thrown out what occurred upon rhyme I close the section with a general  observation The melody of articulate sound so powerfully inchants the mind as to draw a vail over very gross faults and imperfections Of this power a stronger example cannot be given than the episode of Aristaeus which closes the fourth book of the  Georgies  To renew a stock of bees when the former is lost Virgil asserts that they will be produced in the intrails of a bullock slain and managed in a certain manner This leads him to say how this strange receipt was invented which is as follows Aristaeus having lost his bees by disease and famine never dreams of employing the ordinary means for obtaining a new stock but like a froward child complains heavily of his misfortune to his mother Cyrene a waternymph She advises him to consult Proteus a seagod not how he was to obtain a new stock but only by what fatality he had lost his former stock adding that violence was necessary because Proteus would say nothing voluntarily Aristaeus satisfied with this advice though it gave him no prospect of repairing his loss proceeds to execution Proteus is catched sleeping  bound with cords and compelled to speak He declares that Aristaeus was punished with the loss of his bees for attempting the chastity of Euridice the wife of Orpheus she having got her death by the sting of a serpent in flying his embraces Proteus whose sullenness ought to have been converted into wrath by the rough treatment he met with becomes on a sudden courteous and communicative He gives the whole history of Orpheus's expedition to hell in order to recover his spouse a very entertaining story indeed but without the least relation to the affair on hand Aristaeus returning to his mother is advised to deprecate by sacrifices the wrath of Orpheus who was now dead A bullock is sacrificed and out of the intrails spring miraculously a swarm of bees How should this have led any mortal to think that without a miracle the same might be obtained naturally as is supposed in the receipt  A list of the different FEET and of their NAMES  PYRRHICHIUS consists of two short syllables Examples  Deus
