 Mrs  Clive  SCENE  A GROVE  THE CHAPLET A Musical Entertainment  PART I  SCENE I  DAMON LAURA  LAURA  _UNgrateful  Damon  Is it come to this  Are these the happy Scenes of promis'd Bliss  Ne'er hope vain  Laura  future Peace to prove  Content ne'er harbours with neglected Love  DAMON  Consider Fair the everrestless Pow'r  Shifts with the Breeze and changes with the Hour  Above Restraint he scorns a fix'd Abode  And on his silken Plumes flies forth the rambling God  AIR  You say at your Feet that I wept in Despair  And vow'd that no Angel was ever so fair  How could you believe all the Nonsense I spoke  What know we of AngelsI meant it in joke  I next stand indicted for swearing to love  And nothing but Death should my Passion remove  I have lik'd you a Twelvemonth a Calendar Year  And not yet contentedhave Conscience my Dear  RECITATIVE  To Day  Damaetas  gave a rural Treat  And I once more my chosen Friends must meet  Farewel sweet Damsel and remember this  Dull Repetition deadens all our Bliss  Exit  SCENE II  LAURA  Where baleful Cypress forms a gloomy Shade  And yelling Spectres haunt the dreary Glade  Unknown to all my lonesome Steps I'll bend  There weep my Suff'rings and my Fate attend  AIR  Vain is ev'ry fond Endeavour  To resist the tender Dart  For Examples move us never  We must feel to know the Smart  When the Shepherd swears he's dying  And our Beauties sets to view  Vanity her Aid supplying  Bids us think 'tis all our Due  Softer than the vernal Breezes  Is the mild deceitful Strain  Frowning Truth our Sex displeases  Flatt'ry never sues in vain  Soon too soon the happy Lover  Does our tend'rest Hopes deceive  Man was form'd to be a Rover  Foolish Woman to believe  Exit  SCENE III  DAMON  and several Shepherds drinking  DAMON  In Mirth and Pastime ev'ry Hour employ  Lost is the Day that is not spent in Joy  Here strew your Roses here your Chaplets bring  And listen Neighbours to the Truths I sing  AIR  Push about the brisk Bowl 'twill enliven the Heart  While thus we sit round on the Grass  The Lover who talks of his Suff'rings and Smart  Deserves to be reckon'd an Ass  The Wretch who sits watching his illgotten Pelf  And wishes to add to the Mass  Whate'er the Curmudgeon may think of himself  Deserves to be reckon'd an Ass  The Beau who so smart with his wellpowder'd Hair  An Angel beholds in his Glass  And thinks with Grimace to subdue all the Fair  May justly be reckon'd an Ass  The Merchant from Climate to Climate will roam  Of  Croesus  the Wealth to surpass  And oft' while he's wand'ring my Lady at home  Claps the Horns of an Ox on an Ass  The Lawyer so grave when he puts in his Plea  With Forehead well cover'd with Brass  Tho' he talk to no purpose he pockets your Fee  There you my good Friend are the Ass  The formal Physician who knows ev'ry Ill  Shall last be produc'd in this Class  The sick Man awhile may confide in his Skill  But Death proves the Doctor an Ass  Then let us Companions be jovial and gay  By turns take the Bottle and Lass  For he who his Pleasures puts off for a Day  Deserves to be reckon'd an Ass  Exeunt  SCENE IV  PASTORA PALAEMON  PALAEMON  Indeed  Pastora  spite of all you say  I must this very Instant haste away  You think my Flame's extinguish'd quite I know  And other Objects strike memay be so  PASTORA  Perfidious Boy I know 'tis  Sylvia  's Charms  That tear  Palaemon  from these circling Arms  But soon perhaps some other wiser Youth  May learn to set due Value on my Truth  PALAEMON  Whoe'er the Youth may be who claims my Part  He has my full Consent with all my Heart  AIR  Farewel my  Pastora  no longer your Swain  Quite sick of his Bondage can suffer his Chain  Nay arm not your Brow with such haughty Disdain  My Heart leaps with Joy to be free once again  Sing tol derol  I'll live like the Birds those sweet Tenants of  May  Who always are sportful who always are gay  How sweetly their Sonnets they carol all Day  Their Love is but Frolick their Courtship but Play  Sing tol derol  If struck by a Beauty they ne'er saw before  In chirping soft Notes they her Pity implore  She yields to Intreaty and when the Fit's o'er  'Tis an Hundred to Ten that they never meet more  Sing tol derol  Exit  PASTORA  Insulting Boy I'll tear him from my Mind  Ah wou'd my Fortune could a Husband find  And just in time young  Damon  comes this Way  A handsom Youth he is and rich they say  SCENE V  DAMON PASTORA  DAMON  Vouchsafe sweet Maid to hear a wretched Swain  Who lost in Wonder hugs the pleasing Chain  For you in Sighs I hail the rising Day  To you at Eve I sing the lovesick  ay  Then take my Love my Homage as your Due  The Devil's in her if all this won't do  Aside  AIR  DAMON  Beauteous Maid reward my Passion  Crown with Hopes my fierce Desire  SHE  Soon to yield is not the Fashion  Maids some Courtship should require  HE  Tedious Courtship damps all Pleasure  By this melting Kiss I swear  SHE  Now you're rude beyond all Measure  Kiss again Sir if you dare  HE  Where yon Bank the Willows cover  We will shun the Heat of Day  SHE  You're in too much haste young Lover  For the Priest must lead the Way  HE  We can do without him better  None but Fools would marry now  Priests the freeborn Mind would fetter  We will meet without a Vow  PASTORA  Away false Man no more your Tale I'll hear  The black Attempt offends my rigid Ear  The Joys I taste shall be without a Crime  I'll ne'er be fool'd by Mana second Time  Aside  DAMON  If so farewel I'll other Regions try  My gen'rous Mind disdains the slavish Tye  Lovers like Warriors oft Repulses meet  Yet both undaunted their Attacks repeat  AIR  HE  From Flow'r to Flow'r his Joy to change  Flits yonder wanton Bee  From Fair to Fair thus will I range  And I'll be ever free  SHE  Yon little Birds attentive view  That hop from Tree to Tree  I'll copy them I'll copy you  For I'll be ever free  HE  While Tempests shake the nodding Grove  And plough the foaming Sea  While Hawks pursue the flying Dove  So long will I be free  SHE  'Till on the Bush the Lily grows  'Till Flocks forsake the Lea  'Till from the Rock bursts forth the Rose  You'll find me blith and free  BOTH  Then let's divide to East and West  Since we shall ne'er agree  And try who keeps their Promise best  And who's the longest free  Exeunt  THE CHAPLET A Musical Entertainment  PART II  SCENE I  LAURA  AIR  _WHAT Med'cine can soften the Bosom's keen Smart  What  Lethe  can banish the Pain  What Cure can be met with to sooth the fond Heart  That's broke by a faithless young Swain  In hopes to forget him how vainly I try  The Sports of the Wake and the Green  When  Colin  is dancing I say with a Sigh  'Twas here first my  Damon  was seen  When to the pale Moon the soft Nightingales moan  In Accents so piercing and clear  You sing not so sweetly I cry with a Groan  As when my dear  Damon  was here  A Garland of Willow my Temples shall shade  And pluck it ye Nymphs from yon Grove  For there to her Cost was poor  Laura  betray'd  And  Damon  pretended to love  Exit  SCENE II  DAMON  A charming Consort would have fill'd these Arms  Had I but yielded to  Pastora  's Charms  How bless'd would then have been my future Life  Palaemon  's Mistress turn'd to  Damon  's Wife  Yet in her Coin the wily Nymph I'll pay  And all her Schemes of Vanity betray  Then haste to  Laura  that much injur'd Fair  And snatch her from the Jaws of black Despair  Exit  SCENE III  PASTORA  AIR  In vain I try my ev'ry Art  Nor can I fix a single Heart  Yet I'm not old or ugly  Let me consult my faithful Glass  A Face much worse than this might pass  Methinks I look full smuggly  Yet bless'd with all these pow'rful Charms  The young  Palaemon  fled these Arms  That wild unthinking Rover  Hope silly Maids as soon to bind  The rolling Stream the flying Wind  As fix a rambling Lover  But hamper'd in the Marriage Noose  In vain they struggle to get loose  And makes a mighty Riot  Like Madmen how they rave and stare  A while they shake their Chains and swear  And then lie down in quiet  SCENE IV  To her  DAMON  Once more I come to hear what you decree  Yet ere you pass your Sentence list to me  AIR  Declare my pretty Maid  Must my fond Suit Miscarry  With you I'll toy I'll kiss and play  But hang me if I marry  Then speak your Mind at once  Nor let me longer tarry  With you I'll toy I'll kiss and play  But hang me if I marry  Tho' Charms and Wit assail  The Stroke I well can parry  I love to kiss and toy and play  But do not choose to marry  Young  Molly  of the Dale  Makes a mere Slave of  Harry    Because when they had toy'd and kiss'd  The foolish Swain wou'd marry  These fix'd Resolves my Dear  I to the Grave will carry  With you I'll toy and kiss and play  But hang me if I marry  PASTORA  Dare you avow false Youth your lawless Flame  Think not to tempt me to a Deed of Shame  DAMON  Say have you ask'd your neverconquer'd Heart  How many Years it may resist the Dart  For long Attacks the strongest Fortress waste  And  Troy  stood ten Years Siege but fell at last  PASTORA  Vainly you hope my virtuous Heart to move  I know your vile Intent and scorn your Love  DAMON  Turn turn your Eyes to yonder conscious Shade  There a young Shepherd met a haughty Maid  The pines that hang o'er yonder dusky Dell  The babbling Pine a Tale of Scandal tell  And tattling Willows to the Plains proclaim  Palaemon  was the happy Lover's Name  Ha do you start  Pastora  fam'd for Truth  And rigid Virtue clasp'd a blooming Youth  And laying ev'ry sterner Thought aside  Indulg'd her Pleasure and forgot her Pride  PASTORA  Disastrous Fate how could he hear the Tale  Aside  You've lost all Hopes and now begin to rail  SCENE V  To them  LAURA  AIR  How unhappy's the Nymph  Who weeps to the Wind  And dotes with Despair  On a Swain that's unkind  DAMON  I see the Fates determine I shall wed  Two Nymphs are ready to partake my Bed  Which shall I choose  Pastora  's wond'rous fair  And  Laura  sparkles like the MorningStar  PASTORA  aside  Come there are Hopes now  Venus  lend each Grace  And with bewitching Beauties arm my Face  DAMON  AIR  Three Goddesses standing together  Thus puzzled young  Paris  one Day  Can I judge the Value of either  Where both bear so equal a Sway  PASTORA  Consider my Wit and Condition  Consider my Person likewise  I never was us'd to petition  But pr'ythee make use of your Eyes  LAURA  No Merit I plead but my Passion  'Twere needless to mention your Vow  Reflect with a little Compassion  On what this poor Bosom feels now  DAMON  Some Genius direct me or Demon  Or else I may chance to choose wrong  After some Pause  You're Part of the Goods of  Palaemon  I give you to whom you belong  PASTORA  Aside  Misjudging Wretch with Rage my Bosom glows  Can he prefer a Nettle to a Rose  AIR  I know that my Person is charming  Beyond what a Clown can discover  That Dowdy your Senses alarming  Proves what a blind Thing is a Lover  I'll quit the dull Plains for the City  Where Beauty is follow'd by Merit  Your Taste simple  Damon  I pity  Your Wit who would wish to inherit  Perhaps you may think you perplex me  And that I my Anger wou'd smother  The Loss of one Lover can't vex me  My Charms will procure me another  I ne'er was more pleas'd I assure you  How odious they look I can't bear 'em  I wish you much joy of your Fury  My Rage into pieces could tear them  Exit  SCENE  the last  DAMON  To thee kind Nymph as to offended Heav'n  I own my Faults and sue to be forgiv'n  Then gentle  Laura  clear my past Offence  Repentance is ally'd to Innocence  LAURA  Think not a rigid Judge your Faults arraigns  My tender Bosom feels for all your Pains  In those sad Hours when to the secret Grove  I told my Pangs of inauspicious Love  My only Pray'r was once again to see  The lovely Author of my Misery  Again to clasp him to my beating Breast  The Gods have heard my Vows and  Laura  's blest  AIR  DAMON  Contented all Day I will sit at your Side  Where  Poplars  far stretching o'erarch the cool Tide  And while the clear River runs purling along  The Thrush and the Linnet contend in their Song  LAURA  While you are but by me no Danger I fear  Ye Lambs rest in Safety my  Damon  is near  Bound on ye blith Kids now your Gambols may please  For my Shepherd is kind and my Heart is at Ease  DAMON  Ye Virgins of  Britain  bright Rivals of Day  The Wish of each Heart and the Theme of each Lay  Ne'er yield to the Swain till he make you a Wife  For he who loves truly will take you for Life  LAURA  Ye Youths who fear nought but the Frowns of the Fair  'Tis yours to relieve not to add to their Care  Then scorn to their Ruin Assistance to lend  Nor betray the sweet Creatures you're born to defend  BOTH  For their Honour and Faith be our Virgins renown'd  Nor false to his Vows one young Shepherd be found  Be their Moments all guided by Virtue and Truth  To preserve in their Age what they gain'd in their Youth  The END
