 POEMS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS  Price Two Shillings and Sixpence sewed  POEMS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS  BY WILLIAM HAWKINS LATE PROFESSOR OF POETRY IN OXFROD  OXFORD PRINTED BY W JACKSON Sold by J DODSLEY in  PallMall  Mess RIVINGTONS in  St Paul  's  ChurchYard  and W OWEN in  FleetStreet London  J and J FLETCHER and S PARKER in  Oxford  MDCCLXXXI  ADVERTISEMENT  THESE Poems some of which it is presumed will be found to have an  original  cast were written partly to divert the Author's mind from reflections of unpleasing tendency and partly to relieve it under attention to matters more professional and of much greater importance to the interest of virtue and religion And he hopes at the same time a liberal attempt to amuse all sorts of readers but immoral ones will not be less acceptable to the candid and the sensible than the bulk of modern productions which are visibly calculated to answer a mere temporary and ungenerous purpose in the gratification of party rage popular censoriousness or personal disgust  N B The Reader is desired for  Heats  to read  Heat's  p l for  honours  to read  humours  p at bottom to erase the  period  at  unfold  p l to put a  comma  after  blame  l ibid for

ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS  INQUIRE dispute reply and all you can  Say what is GENIUS but the soul of man  Beam of that light which animates our frame  Alike in many but in none the same  'Tis with our Minds as with our bodies none  In essence differ yet each knows his own  Marks of specific character we see  That stamp on ev'ry mortalTHIS IS HE  Nor varies more our present outward shape  This man halfangel and the next halfape  Than do the mental powers What odds we find  Between a 's and a  In the course of this Essay the names of many who have distinguished themselves by their ability will occur but it will not be expected that honour should be done to or mention made of all the successful candidates for celebrity in all countries and ages of the world It will be thought sufficient 'tis presumed for the illustration of the subject to have produced some of the most eminent and popular names especially among those of our own nation  Newton  's mind  Ask you the cause First take it for a rule  Whate'er the man the soul is not a fool  She came in due perfection from the skies  And all defect in grosser body lies  Body and soul at best but ill agree  'Tis spirit wedded to infirmity  A disproportion'd match and hence proceeds  The soul's inaction from the body's needs  This truth once state ev'ry soul 'tis plain  Much on the filmy texture of the brain  Much on formations that escape our eyes  On nice connexions and coherencies  And on corporeal organs must depend  For her own functions exercise and end  Hence then the cause of all defects is seen  For one wrong movement spoils the whole machine  'Tis hence the several passions take their rise  The seeds of virtue and the roots of vice  Hence notes peculiar or to young or old  Phlegmatic sanguine amorous or cold  And hence from constitution such or such  Wit will take modes and  Genius  op'rate much  The youthful bard a gentle sighing swain  Like  Ovid  warbles in a lovesick strain  With weaker passions but with sense more strong  The melancholy  Young  pursues his song  Mixture of humours motley  Genius  shews  'Tis seen methinks in  The author means not hereby to throw any reflection on the literary character of the late ingenious and worthy Mr  Hervey  whose MEDITATIONS have done considerable service to religion and will rank him in the first class of elegant writers proper allowances made for the enthusiasm with which they are a little tinctured and for the exuberance of a sometimes too playful imagination  Hervey  's dancing prose  Why wonder then to mark the sons of rhyme  Gay serious turgid easy or sublime  The soul and body closely thus allied  Vile is the folly as the sin of pride  And one great truth the first of men will fit  That nothing more precarious is than wit  Behold yon wretch that o'er your parish strays  A babyman a driv'ler all his days  With tongue outlolling and roundrolling eyes  He grins against the sun and catches flies  But for some secret flaws we cannot read  That check her motions and her flights impede  His soul perchance enrich'd with happiest thought  Had spoke like  Tully  or like  Virgil  wrote  Alas all souls are subject to like fate  All sympathizing with the body's state  Let the fierce fever burn through ev'ry vein  And drive the madding fury to the brain  Nought can the fervour of his frenzy cool  But  Aristotle  's self's a parish fool  Nay in proportion lighter ails controul  The mental virtue and infect the soul  Ease is best convoy in our voy'ge to truth  What man e'er reason'd with a raging tooth  A poet with a  Genius  and without  Are the same creatures in the pangs of gout  Hence then we guess nor vain is our surmise  Why some are fools and none are always wise  Why  Genius  differs in life's every stage  Runs wild with youth and creeps with hobbling age  The soul uncumber'd with the mortal clay  Knows no increase of strength nor fears decay  A little art this secret may unfold  That what can never die is never old  By present powers perfection cease to scan  For we may daily mourn the  fall of man  Ah how bright wit possest of ev'ry gift  Dwindled to folly and went mad in  Swift  The mighty  Marlb'ro'  whose great soul was prov'd  Upon the plains of  Blenheim  where unmov'd  "Amidst confusion horrour and despair"  He view'd around "the dreadful scenes of war  "In peaceful thought the field of death survey'd  "To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid  "Inspir'd repuls'd battalions to engage  "And taught the doubtful battle where to rage"  E'en he the springs of nature in decay  And all his vital functions worn away  Unable now to conquer realms or buy  With idiot gesture and unmeaning eye  Sits a spectator in the foremost row  And gapes at heroes in a puppetshew  Eschew presumption ev'ry halflearn'd elf  The noblest writer does not know himself  Turn mighty  Milton  's sacred volume o'er  'Tis strength 'tis majesty or something more  His numbers like th'Almighty's thunders roll  And strike an aweful pleasure to the soul  We joy in ruin and are almost pain'd  To see the latelost  Paradise Regain'd  This work  See  Fenton  's Life of  Milton  prefixed to his edition of  Paradise Lost  The learned Dr  Newton  tells us in his Life of  Milton  that  all that we can assert upon good authority is that he could not endure to hear the  Paradise Regained  cried down so much as it was in comparison with the other poem  But I believe my reader will agree with me that such a partiality as this will sufficiently warrant what is said in the Essay Probably I may have more to say upon this subject in another place  himself judg'd best tell me who read  Was not the mighty  Milton  blind indeed  GENIUS again by inf'rence apt we see  The same in species differs in  degree    Propensities are strong and few men yet  But have a relish for some kind of wit  Homer  is monarch of the  Epic  choir  Yet  Virgil  snatch'd a brand of  Homer  's fire  The daring  Homer  's allimpetuous strain  Like a hot courser bore him o'er the plain  The muse of  Virgil  that affected state  Speeds not so swiftly but she keeps her rate  Heats oft intense in  Lucan  's patriot page  And  Statius'  muse turns fury in her rage  Each writer is distinguish'd in his way  Grand  Sophocles  or playful  Seneca  Bold  Aeschylus  a stately buskin wore  And shook th'  Athenian  stage with tragic roar  You'd swear so soft  Euripides  appears  And tender still he dipt his quill in tears  Droll  Aristophanes  in humour's school  Was bred and we admire e'en envy's tool  A pleasant vein through laughing  Plautus  ran  And  Terence  words it like a gentleman  All to their fav'rite art will lay pretence  'Tis inclination or 'tis excellence  'Midst clouds of dullness gleams of wit have shone  Like the faint burstings of an  April  sun  Some partly fail as partly they excel  Thus  Rchrdsn  we know drew nature well  Yet should a genius toy as he has done  And spin morality like  Grandison  Grant you what's past and it will less perplex  To ask why woman is the weaker sex  Or why th' extremes of female wits are such  They mostly say too little or too much  Beauty's soft frame for other ends design'd  Faints under toil of body or of mind  Shall dimpled girls "the state's whole thunder wield  And spinsters "shake the senate or the field"  Shall tender matrons with man's follies vext  With highstrain'd treble drive a pointed text  Shall blooming virgins wage the wordy war  And deck with brazen fronts the noisy bar  Let not creation's finer part repine  Or grudge the province where they cannot shine  Their pleasing sway a thousand ways is shewn  And beauty has an empire of its own  Kind Heav'n that gave them beauty all things gave  The soundest scholar is a woman's slave  Yet have we known superior nymphs that can  Assert an equal pow'r and rival man  Born nature's wonders or with art to wield  The pen or grace in arms the martial field  To model laws or rule a factious realm  Witness  Eliza  at  Britannia  's helm  Witness the great  Semiramis  of old  Whose ample prowess fame has grav'd in gold  Witness the lofty soul the matchless worth  Of  Cath'rine  recent empress of the north  Witness th' ingenious talents of a few  Aikin Centlivre Rowe Behn Montague  Fine strokes in pretty  Novellists  are seen  And in  Macaulay  sense atones for spleen  Nay diff'rent countries diff'rent  Genius  make  Souls modes peculiar to their climate take  B  eotia  's foggy air was mark'd of old  Athenian  wits were bright and  Theban  cold  Just view near home the surface of the ball  In  Holland Genius  is mechanical  In  France  the muses breathe a livelier strain  In  Italy  they skip and strut in  Spain  Not but the  British  muse delights to shew  Exotic worth and merit in a foe  Tasso Corneille Racine  adorn their age  And much we borrow from the  Gallic  stage  In equal strength tho' diff'rent modes appear  The honours of  Cervantes  and  Moliere  This muse or that propitious deigns to shine  On other bards but on  Voltaire  the Nine  In  England  O how manifold our rhyme  Where  Genius  is uncertain as the clime  We shew consult the press the stage the schools  All sorts of wise men as all sorts of fools  And count our numbers of illustrious name  That climb'd by different paths the steeps of fame  Ye laurell'd bards of  Britain  great in song  O let the muse survey your tuneful throng  Chaucer  who notes not thy facetious glee  Thy  Genius  full of quaint festivity  Who reads must see and seeing must admire  Bright  Spencer  's fancy and bold  Milton  's fire  Genius  was studied wit in artful  Ben  But flow'd spontaneous  Dryden  from thy pen  'Twas thine in manly richness to excel  With twice thy labour few write half so well  Fletcher  had copious energy of mind  Cowley  's was wit let loose and  Wycherly  's confin'd  Who but applauds soft  Otway  's melting lay  The negligent Simplicity of  Gay    The genuine mirth that tickled  Butler  's vein  Waller  's terse sonnet and  Young  's nervous strain  Garth  had a trait sarcastic  Vanburgh  droll  And  Mason  's drama speaks a  Grecian  soul  Such various forms will  Genius  take to please  In  Rowe  'tis elegance in  Prior  ease  In  Lee  'tis flame that lays half nature waste  And in the courtly  Addison  'tis taste  In  Thomson  's muse a thousand graces shine  And strong description animates his line  'Tis comic grace in  Steele  that shunn'd offence  In  Pope  'tis sweetness purity and sense  'Tis humour in the  Dean  unequall'd yet  And  Congreve  who could stand thy twoedg'd wit  To sev'ral bards their several beauties fall  But to inimitable  Shakespear  all  He nature's darling unrestrain'd by art  Knew ev'ry spring that moves the human heart  Shakespear  O  Phoebus  lend thy golden lyre  Give me the beams of thy coelestial fire  Avaunt ye vulgar poets listen round  And all  Parnassus  thunder with the sound  While the muse hails that great dramatic name  And down time's rapid tide bears  Shakespear  's endless fame  Thy genius  Shenstone  who shall justly treat  'Tis something something exquisitely neat  Nor must the wreath of glory be denied  To solemn  Gray  or florid  Akinside  Nor is it just its tribute to refuse  To  Churchill  's bitter but ungen'rous muse  In  Lowth  in  West  a vein  Pindaric  flows  Each  Warton  a commanding talent shews  And classical alike their verse and prose  Assert we then the force of  Genius  lies  In verse alone Are poets only wise  We hinted  Genius  is of various kind  And vast the province of the human mind  Who well performs his heav'nallotted part  By strength of nature or by aid of art  Whate'er the subject of his happy skill  The product is the work of  Genius  still  That artful rhet'ric human souls can move  Demosthenes  let thy  Philippics  prove  What honied dew distill'd from  Tully  's tongue  What soft persuasion on his accents hung  So smoothly strong the sweet oration flows  We might assert the muses speak in prose  Bid him write verses who but will agree  Cibber  could make as good an  Ode  as he  'Tis nought but  Genius  that in all presides  Gives word in battle and in council guides  Prescribes in physic and consigns to fame  A learned  Hervey  's or a  Sydenham  's name  Sad woes ensu'd where fools have squadrons led  For what is  Caesar  's arm without his head  A glorious list in  British  records shines  Of statesmen wits philosophers divines  Great  Raleigh  's death a sacrifice to  Spain  Marks with a blot a pedant monarch's reign  Wise  Bacon  saw where truth halfsmother'd lay  And from scholastic rubbish clear'd the way  Sage  Pocock  and deep skill'd in annals old  Usher  high places in fame's temple hold  Long lucubrations o'er the midnight oil  Gave to the world a  Newton  and a  Boyle  Sagacious  Locke  discover'd when he wrote  Clearness of notion and vast depth of thought  Each  Alma Mater  boasts her fav'rite own  OXFORD her  Bradley  CAMBRIDGE  Sanderson  Nature still marks what mortals speak or write  Chatham  was copious  Chesterfield  polite  Knowledge of vulgar manners all discern  In  Fielding  and new pleasantry in  Stern  In  Johnson  's strong but pompaffecting prose  A mortal wit it's selfsufficience shews  This age has seen strange pow'rs to music giv'n  And  Handel  learn'd or stole his art from heav'n  'Tis not a puny judge can find a flaw  In  Sherlock's  gospel or in  Blackstone  's law  While  Mansfield  's elocution pure and strong  Resistless as a torrent sweeps along  Some to high fame by solid judgment rise  'Tis  Hurd  's immortal fame to criticise  There are who can amaze while they delight  Bold spirit with cool judgment can unite  Let  Warburton  Gloster  's learned works your praise engage  And  Hume  's and  Robertson  's historic page  What plenteous streams of easy sense we see  In fluent  Tillotson  's divinity  Yet fluent  Tillotson  could little say  Had not the deepread  Barrow  lead the way  Others may fright you from the tempter's gin  But  South  will make a man asham'd of sin  Nay some we know and knowing we must smile  Blest with a talent but without a style  Hammond  stands foremost of this awkward line  A rumbling writer but a deep divine  Who ever knew so strange a vein as his  Or so much learning in  parenthesis  'Twould tire the muse and reader to proceed  From reas'ning  Chillingworth  to flow'ry  Seed    To cite at large the theologic band  From  Jewel  down to  Clarke  and  Waterland    The works of christian labour to explore  Of  Hooker Pearson Mede  and numbers more  That drew their manly quills for righteous ends  The church's champions and religion's friends  I grieve to think what souls may be destroy'd  By wit perverse and  Genius  misemploy'd  Nothing awakes so soon the vengeful rod  As wisdom flying in the face of God  The force of reason is of finite length  This giant that attempts beyond his strength  Our boasted light of nature feeble spark  Guides for a while but leaves us in the dark  As glimm'ring vapours with a pallid ray  Light us to quagmires and to gulphs betray  How vain is mortal man above his sphere  Poor knowing fool just wise enough to err  Go span the globe the world's strong bounds o'erleap  Empty the yawning caverns of the deep  Count all the fibres of that insect's thigh  Catch me the trembling sunbeams as they fly  Then take thy understanding's cable line  Examine God and measure truths divine  Grant me kind heav'n to see ere I explain  Correct all false ambition of my brain  And on my mind this maxim printed be  The christian virtue is Humility  Happier the simple swain the rustic fool  That never took the polish of a school  Than swell'd with pride a master of all arts  With  Shaftsbury  's cunning and with  St John  's parts  Much wit obscene has crept thro' ev'ry age  But lewdness riots on the modern stage  O shame to arts our poets may defie  The bards of old with  Rome  and  Athens  vie  May boast invention penetration wit  All qualities for either  Drama  fit  May touch the passions with enchanting art  And take minutest copies of the Heart  Yet of past  Dramatists  be this the praise  They rarely stain'd with ribaldry their bays  Genius  depends then on the body's frame  Tell me will  Genius  never be the same  Or will the diff'rence we today espy  Subsist in souls to all eternity  Such question put if reason may be bold  In humblewise conjecture to unfold  She seems to dictate and she fears not blame  That things once diff'ring never are the same  Here or hereafter in what light you will  A man you know is soul and body still  And still corporeal organs and their use  Must correspondent faculties produce  But body in that happier state refin'd  Shall leave its old infirmities behind  And ev'ry soul be perfect in her  kind  Consult material objects and we see  God's pow'r display'd in sweet variety  The diff'rent Seasons diff'rent beauties bring  'Tis not one colour paints the jolly spring  The sun highflaming travels in his might  The moon with placid orb adorns the night  Each insect that eludes the nicest eye  One of the myriads floating in the sky  His Maker's praise proclaim as loudly can  As Ocean's tyrant king the great  Leviathan  Look thro' all nature the vast tracts of space  Each being has it's proper pow'r and place  Th' angelic hosts that round the Godhead wait  And issue forth his ministers of fate  Have their respective provinces and know  What part to act above and what below  Messiah  's sword to  Michael  's might is giv'n  And  Gabriel  is Ambassador of Heav'n  Hence then from inf'rence fairly drawn we find  That souls will differ and excel in kind  But when admitted to the realms of joy  What certain office what precise employ  Shall exercise the sev'ral pow'rs of each  Present conception not presumes to reach  Enough from gen'ral principles to shew  That one great point of bliss will be to know  To touch perfection in a fav'rite art  And grieve no longer but to "know in part"  To mark where truth in her recesses lies  Pursue her without toil and grasp her as she flies  The sage  Logician  then shall clearly see  How all ideas differ or agree  And from her coverts drive sly sophistry  No need to shift to wrangle and confute  For sure the blessed reason not dispute  See pensive  Metaphysics  science coy  In contemplation only knowing joy  Sober recluse no noisy standerby  She speculates abstracted entity  Purg'd of the grosser particles of clay  And all material obstacles away  In the full vigour of eternal youth  How will she see embrace adore the truth  Physics  still fond new secrets to descry  And look through nature with a piercing eye  Hereafter latent causes may explore  When all the present system is no more  And prove when inmate of the blest abode  This world an atom to the works of God  The pale  Astronomer  who kens from far  The wand'ring planet or the station'd star  When this frail earth in ruin shall be hurl'd  May count the lamps that light a nobler world  And subtle  G'ometry  shall lend her line  And take dimensions of the plan divine  What sounds shall flow from  Rhet'ric's  silver tongue  How sweet her eloquence her voice how strong  Her wond'rous talents graceful she displays  And thunders forth the heav'nly monarch's praise  Hark hark the raptur'd bard has struck his lyre  His bosom kindles with poetic fire  Ten thousand vast ideas swell his mind  Imagination ranges unconfin'd  He sings  Jehovah  's alltriumphant reign  How softly trills how loudly sounds the strain  And music fills th' unmeasurable plain  The winged hosts are charm'd that hover by  And seraphs shout applause that rends the sky  Such then the future pleasures of the mind  So solid manly rational refin'd  Source of sublime delight and tranquil joy  And sure to satisfy but not to cloy  How vain at once are all mere earthly schemes  The tricks of statesmen and ambition's dreams  Low the designs the wisest worldlings lay  Lower the brutal pleasures of a day  Awake awake pursue your proper plan  Virtue and knowledge only make a man  Despise the world a better fortune try  And calculate for immortality  Ideots by nat'ral organs ill supply'd  Untutor'd louts whose parts were never try'd  Hereafter hidden excellence may shew  And rank with souls that scorn'd them here below  But for the sot that sees yet slights his rule  The wilful novice and industrious fool  That lulls with sloth or steeps in vice his sense  The slave of pleasure or of indolence  How wretched is his fate Fears he not pain  The gnawing viper and the galling chain  Still wretched is this blockhead's fate for why  Eternal ignorance is misery  The author apprehends this sentiment to be justified by reasonable presumptions and the sense which the following passage of S S will at least admit  He that is unjust let him be unjust still c  REV ch xx ver  Who goodly talents have should talents use  With care assiduous but with virtuous views  For application sometimes less pretence  To merit has than barren indolence  Nothing fatigues our soul or tires our brain  Like lust of empire or the thirst of gain  And these o'erruling in an active mind  Spoil nations and make havock of mankind  Ingenious tyrants only make us slaves  Were all men fools sure no men would be knaves  Sly  Cromwell  once obscure unnotic'd thing  Outwitted factions and was more than king  Ambition take the sceptre and the robe  Spread thy huge greatness over half the globe  Lo the world bursts 'tis nature's dying day  The sun is dark the planets melt away  Now boast thy  Genius  exercise thy parts  Recount thy feats and recognize thy arts  Alas thou cursest thy too pregnant brain  And knowledge is acute to quicken pain  The nature the importance and the end  Of  Genius  such be wise then and attend  How we may best our nat'ral powers improve  And qualify the soul for bliss above  Genius  lies hid like metal in the mine  Till searching education bids it shine  'Tis but a glorious few of deathless name  Have found without a guide their road to fame  Nor slight their province if we justly rate  Who till the mind and  Genius  cultivate  Much penetration and no little toil  Must try the strength and temper of the soil  Some minds richnatur'd like a gen'rous field  To little culture ample harvests yield  Others incessant labour must secure  They owe their goodly produce to manure  Our judgment too should mark where talent lies  And soon as seen indulge propensities  For diff'rent objects diff'rent fancies strike  Genius  we said before is not alike  Pope  's forward muse procur'd him early fame  "He lisp'd in numbers for the numbers came"  Another's unharmonious tuste is such  Sooner than poetry he'd learn  High Dutch  Yet  He  peculiar talents may display  And prove a very wonder in his way  Why must all mortals seek the selfsame praise  Is there no garland but a wreath of bays  To steep  Parnassus'  summit most sublime  'Tis not a shortbreath'd  Pegasus  can climb  Some seem to think that  Genius  may be sold  But wit is not like honour bought with gold  To foreign regions wealthy thicksculs roam  Tho' fools of all men sure should stay at home  Another's heir thro'  Wickham  's school must pass  He goes a blockhead and comes home an ass  From form to form these dull indocile things  Proceed in course as tumblers shoot thro' rings  Yet these tho' destitute of hopeful wit  'Twere rashness to pronounce at once unfit  For life's first stations oft 'mongst these we find  An able body and an active mind  A keen discernment prudence caution care  A hand to execute a soul to dare  No useful talent then should dormant lie  'Tis service to the common enemy  And these noscholars may or swell the sail  Of commerce and attend the shifting gale  Or deck with great exploits a  Georgia  's reign  And humble  Gallic  crests and crush the pride of  Spain  Others of lively parts but wretched fate  Want nothing but a fortune to be great  Sometimes among the vulgar herd we find  Strong marks and features of a heav'nly mind  The village swain's a wit he knows not how  And I have seen philosophy at plough  How are our hopes by present chances crost  What oafs make prsns and what wits are lost  When now your  Genius  near to ripeness grown  Begins to glow with raptures all its own  Ply it with chosen books of various kinds  For reading is the food of hungry minds  Mod'rate and wholsom will suffice your need  'Tis not how much but how and what you read  To rise with appetite is always best  Gluttons devour much more than they digest  'Tis vain for ever over books to pore  Reading does much but observation more  Mere slavish plodding never yet prevail'd  See yon lank student to his  folio  nail'd  He reads at home abroad at meals in bed  And has five thousand volumes in his head  Yet little to perfection has he brought  For he has read so much he never thought  The youth more sprightly and the glowing bard  That had as lieve go dig as study hard  Applies by fits and at his fancy's call  Little he reads but has that little all  He sees and he enjoys his author's worth  Gathers his flow'rs and culls his beauties forth  He dwells with transport on a fav'rite part  And clasps each striking passage to his heart  Your models chuse from authors of first rate  He cannot write who dares not emulate  To father  Homer  's sov'ring poetry  Rome  owes her  Virgil  and our  Milton  we  The tow'ring muse of  Pindar  reach'd the sky  And  Flaccus  follow'd with an eager eye  For present times to emulate is all  'Tis scarce in wit to be original  Leave books and go to company and then  Leave company and go to books again  The studious mind 'tis useful to unbend  In pleasing converse with a social friend  For cordial juices of the purple vine  Refresh the weary and the dull refine  O'er flowing bowls rebounds the sparkling wit  And sure no poet was a milksop yet  Intemp'rate revelling alone consumes  The mental pow'rs and clouds the brain in fumes  Horace  best handler of the  Roman  lyre  In rich  Falernum  quaff'd poetic fire  A jovial bard How pleasant are his strains  How much goodhumour in his writings reigns  He laughs tho' angry and will still delight  His verse is satire but it is not spite  How does his muse with free politeness rail  While  Juvenal  's is threshing with a flail  Scholars should know all fire in motion lies  Whet then your parts with manly exercise  Dulness sits slumb'ring in an elbowchair  But the gay Muses love to take the air  The Shades of night are fled before the morn  The mountains echo to the cheerful horn  Men dogs and horses neighings shouts and cries  Shake with tumultuous jollity the skies  The chace grows hot they pant in ev'ry vein  Now climb the steep hill's brow now scour along the plain  Such sports as these enliven they impart  Warmth to the brain and gladness to the heart  Yet cautious still indulge the vig'rous joy  It should be relaxation not employ  But if due aid to  Genius  may be lent  Sometimes it suffers by impediment  Unhappy is the bard that deals in rhyme  When wit is obsolete and sense a crime  When the weak muse in a degen'rate age  Crawls from the press or lamely treads the stage  No longer dares to noble heights advance  But chimes in song or trifles in romance  How shall the genuine bard escape from fools  That judge by narrow or by partial rules  A thousand witlings maul his mangled name  And yelping critics hunt him out of fame  How strange a fate in writing few succeed  But ev'ry man's a critic that can read  Chance sometimes seems to govern all we see  Merit in vain prefer a righteous plea  False taste caprice and circumstance of times  Untowardly conspire to damn our rhymes  And censure so perversely plays her tricks  That she will measure wit by politics  To our eternal shame this truth be said  That for whole Years ev'n  In fact as fair a chance for renown as literary worth will be acknowledged to have in the main it cannot be denied that Authors before now have been less indebted to the intrinsic merit of their productions for their reputation than to a powerful patronage or a favourable crisis The world is not invariably just in its decisions I will only detain the reader with one notorious instance Mr  Addison  's Comedy of the  Drummer  was hardly able to wriggle itself into the world at all while the Tragedy of  Cato  by virtue principally of the popular word  Liberty  recommended itself to uncommon applause and was long time the favourite entertainment of the nation For this performance notwithstanding the random panegyric bestowed on it by a few  See GUARDIAN Vol I No c  Gentlemen connected with its author by principle or attached to him by friendship is in point merely of  dramatic  merit most unquestionably far inferiour to the Comedy abovementioned In short the fate of writers is too often determined by many supposable contingencies and circumstances and literary reputation is sometimes temporary sometimes posthumous and always in some measure precarious  Milton  was unread  If these are plagues still more remain behind  Wits tell you fortune frowns upon their kind  Alas what sources of obstruction lie  In the great common woe of poverty  Whose case is hardest 'tis not quickly said  Or theirs that work or theirs that write for bread  The starveling curate the fat dean supplies  One makes divinity and t'other buys  Who but must wail the state of lib'ral arts  When scholars pawn their coats or fell their parts  Bards of first note are hirelings ev'ry day  And the chaste Nine turn prostitutes for pay  Sure of all writers poets should not lack  'Twill spoil your  Pegasus  to make him hack  The muse expands her wings before you ask  She loves employment but she hates a task  To  Dryden  the proud manager could say  On pain of thirst and hunger bring your play  The play appears in breach of many a rule  And want makes  Dryden  sometimes half a fool  Such from without the causes that we find  Obstruct the operations of the mind  Within too  Genius  has its enemies  And in ourselves too oft our hindrance lies  Our passions vices follies talents hide  Intemp'rance anger hastiness and pride  We said debauches will oblivion bring  And mix dull  Lethe  with the Muses' spring  The mind is then most vig'rous when serene  And crude the sentiment that flows from spleen  What then inspires the sharp satyric page  Oft fix'd illnature seldom sudden rage  Some giddy fancies ev'ry object hit  Alike you may be prodigal of wit  The verse is shortliv'd that is premature  The muse tho' never slow should still be sure  These are thy honours  Blackmore  this thy gain  That nonsense came in vollies from thy brain  Conceit with vapours puffs an empty mind  And makes a writer to his errors blind  'Tis the first praise to make the next to mend  Go court the censure of an able friend  Procure the sanction of a learned few  Who knows what mortals may your works review  In the former edition the wordreviewwas printed in  Italics  of which the author confesses the impropriety But whether the general question be pertinent or otherwise he leaves to the determination of every candid and impartial reader  True modesty for wit may sometimes pass  But ev'ry coxcomb is as such an ass  The best productions some defects will stain  And he affronts mankind who dares be vain  O that my strains assistance could impart  As far as nature may be help'd by art  Nature to mend all efforts it behoves  And what God made 'tis art alone improves  Give me this fame kind heav'n and tho' my song  Ranks me the meanest of the raptur'd throng  I reap fair fruits and gain an honest end  Not musebefriended but the muse's friend  The reader will find in the first edition of this poem a few lines of complimental address to the university of OXFORD a place ever to be mentioned by the author with the utmost gratitude and respect and a few more relative to his own political principles which are all here omitted as totally extraneous to his subject But because the omission of the latter may be liable to misconstruction or lay him open to a charge of tergiversation and desertion of sentiment from more quarters than one it is thought proper to produce the passage in this place with as much of comment on it as will 'tis hoped be sufficient for his vindication and the satisfaction of the reader The lines are as follows  For me howe'er I covet lasting fame  And pant with longings for a poet's name  Yet let my soul confess a nobler aim  Give me kind heav'n still higher points to reach  Give me to practice what I strive to teach  My standing rules of daily conduct be  Faith honour justice candour charity  Careless of false reproach or vain applause  Be worth my eulogy and truth my cause  O may I wield an independent pen  A friend to virtue not a tool to men  In perseverance placing all my glory  While  TORIES WHIGS  and all Men call me  TORY  Warm in my breast may patriot passion glow  Righteous resentment of my country's woe  With voice and heart for ever may I stand  'Gainst vermin that devour my native land  And in one wish my wishes centered be  That I may live to hail my country free  Two of these verses are a parody on a wellknown passage in  Mr Pope  and reprobate that Gentleman's thereavowed mediocrity of principle However let stress be laid not on names but things Ideas are often affixed to terms with which they are not necessarily connected either by the indiscretion or the violence or the artifice of party Men may load the word  Tory  with what Imputations they please but to be as explicit as the occasion seems to require if to profess himself a friend to the Constitution in Church and State a foe alike to  Mass  and  Meeting  as far as candour will warrant and charity admit if to avow himself zealous equally for the Prerogative of the Crown the freedom and independence of Parliament and the privileges and liberties of the People if to hold the rights of conscience sacred and inviolable and to desire to see every peaceable subject in full possession of his religious sentiments but at the same time to detest those latitudinarian principles publickly maintained and insolently disseminated which manifestly tend to undermine the foundations of all order and ccclesiastical establishment whatsoever if to reverence at all times a constitutional opposition to ministry but to abhor a factious one if to wish to find the love of our country the universal passion and the public good the grand aim and object of all orders and degrees of men among us if to do and to desire all this and all that this implies constitutes  Toryism  in the whole or in part a  Tory  the author has been from his youth upon the fullest conviction and a  Tory  he hopes to be to the last moment of his existence  THE SONG of DEBORAH AN ODE JUDGES Chap v  BEGIN the gladsome shout the loud acclaim  Begin the universal choir  Temper in solemn tunes the sounding lyre  To great  Jehovah  's name  Thrones princedoms pow'rs attend Illustrious throng  While I this glorious day  Swell to  Jehovah  's name the grateful song  And tributary laud and joyous homage pay  Who shall abide the dire alarms  The God of  Israel  is in arms  From  Edom  's field in pomp of matchless might  Dreadful he marches "grasping in his hand  Ten thousand thunders" and controuls the fight  Who where is he that shall withstand  And while sublime the wide expanse he trode  Big clouds discharge their watry stores  The dun storm growls the tempest roars  The frighted elements gave place  Proud  Sinai  trembled to his base  And nature's melting frame confest the coming God  II  What time the son of  Anath  held command  And justice scantly dealt throughout the land  How wretched  Israel  's state  To insult rude and rapine fierce betray'd  Thro' devious tracks and desarts wild they stray'd  No traveller the wonted path frequents  Each village her lost habitants laments  The region round was desolate  While rageful war and dire alarms  Beset the girded towns with thund'ring arms  Nor spear nor shield was seen midst  Judah  's bands  Terror disarm'd their hearts and hostile pow'r their hands  In impotence of deep distress  From other gods they seek redress  Adding ungrateful to their weight of woes  When I the mother of my country rose  I  Deborah  the scourge of  Jacob  's foes  And God allgracious set the nations free  By delegated might and their deliverer me  Princes and chiefs that durst assay  The dangers of that direful day  Nobly devoted to your country's cause  Blessings inwreathe your heads and palms of fame's applause  III  Ye whiterob'd ministers of judgment tell  Rulers and rev'rend elders say  All all recount that glorious day  When  Israel  triumph'd and when  Jabin  fell  The tumults hush'd the terrors fled  And peace her downy wings o'erspread  And righteous Heav'n tranquility restor'd  By  Deb'rah  's counsel sage and  Barak  's slaught'ring sword  IV  Now in the deep recesses of the vale  Where far in many a limpid maze  The curling streamlet sweetly strays  At whose fair spring or flow'rtrimm'd side  The villagers their huts supplied  With liquid measures daily drawn  At evening's close or morning's dawn  The blithsome swains exchange a simple tale  Whilom in dread and wild dismay  They pass'd the cheerless tedious day  Sad they convers'd in whispers low  Fancy made ev'ry shade a foe  They shook with ev'ry wind that blew  In ev'ry breeze an arrow flew  Now free from terror and annoy  They give their souls at large to joy  Jehovah  's prowess they relate  Jehovah  's acts and  Jabin  's fate  The pleasing theme enraptur'd they rehearse  With shouts of glad acclaim or strains of rustic verse  V  Rise  Deborah  arise prolong  In solemn notes thy tuneful song  Barak  arise Thou son of fame  Grace thy triumphal car  With a long captive train thy slaves of war  Arise great offspring of  Abinoam    Where were old  Israel  's sons say did not all  The martial summons hear  Or basely did they shrink with fear  Deaf to the din of arms and glory's princely call  Reuben  no more the brave and bold  Attends at home his bleating fold  And  Dan  and  Asher  's coward band  When loud the voice of battle roars  Flie to the limits of the land  And people wide the barren shores  While  Zebulon  and valiant  Napthali  Patriot asserters of their country's right  Undaunted drew their slender squadrons nigh  And fac'd the dread array and iron front of fight  VI  Heirs of renown  Canaan  's proud monarchs came  Unbought and panting with the thirst of fame  Royal confed'rates from afar  Earth groan'd beneath their cumb'rous war  By fair  Megiddo  's mossy banks they stood  Trembled with gleams of arms the silver stood  Now hosts with hosts engage  Impetuous hark the clangs resound  See see the prancing steeds uptear the ground  And the wild tumult glows with hotter rage  But lo the planets frown malign  And ah see where  Jehovah  's seraphlegions pois'd in air  The furious conflict join  The flaming squadrons urge their deathful way  And crush the wither'd pow'rs of  Sisera  Arm'd with etherial fires and charg'd with wrath divine  Triumph my soul pale fears our foes confound  Their might I trample on the ground  The purple field is delug'd with the slain  And antient  Kishon  's rev'rend flood  His swelling waves distain'd with blood  Bears in his sweepy tide whole nations to the main  VII  Fair  Kenite  spouse of  Heber  hail  Blessings thy pious fraud shall crown  And heartfelt joy and high renown  Envy of all the dames that dwell the tented vale  Give me to drink the toilspent warrior cried  The creamy bev'rage lib'ral she supplied  And from her lordly vats his parch'd thirst gratified  Spent with fatigue and lost in sleep profound  Gigantic length he lay  The mighty  Sisera    And while he press'd his earthy bed  She snatch'd the nail she pierc'd his head  She rivetted his temples to the ground  Extended breathless at her feet he lay  The mighty  Sisera    Stretch'd at her feet the chieftain died  This boast of  Harosheth  and  Jabin  's pride  VIII  His noble mother darts from far  Her longing eyes  And loud with fond impatience cries  Why tarries thus his loit'ring car  Why comes he not she cries again  Preventing her attendant train  Why comes not my victorious son  Is not the glorious battle won  Have not the leaders shar'd the prey  The captive maids with blooming charms  To bless the glowing victor's arms  And broider'd robes and glitt'ring spoils  Meet to reward the Soldiers toils  And grace the neck of conq'ring  Sisera  IX  Thus ever let indignant vengeance rise  To blast  Jehovah  's enemies  But let the faithful votaries

Eternal spring breath'd fragrance round their walks  And nature smil'd as hand in hand they took  Their unfrequented way Grateful they pour'd  Their hearts in rapturegrateful praise was then  Religion's better half Faith was unborn  'Twas rich beatitude of sight when God  Descending from his throne supernal gave  Illustrious exhibition of himself  Exchanging conference benign with man  His

conjoin'd  In silken bands of union woven by  Affection pure and first connubial love  But lust of science hellinspir'd unhing'd  This fabric of felicity behold  Eden  is wilderness and man a worm  See this immortal grovels in the dust  And that devotion which was once the vow  Of cheerful worship or the sacrifice  Of placid reverence and filial love  Is now the feeble effort of despair  The plaintive moan of guiltiness abash'd  The tear of anguish and the sigh of woe  Look thou afflicted up It is thy God  Uncloth'd with terrors mark he utters bland  Redemption's word With pious eagerness  Devour those healing sounds and catch O catch  The balmy dew of grace upon thy soul  Now Faith unfurls her banner at her side  Hope meekly smiling stands while righteous souls  Burn with impatience

tradition thus  Pure from it's fount deriving in it's flow  Collects strange tenets and exotic whims  Such diabolic artifice suggests  Or from the plastic faculty of man  Or from observance heedless till at length  Error ingraff'd upon the stock of truth  Shoots his luxuriant branch Religion shews  Like some delightful but uncultur'd spot  When desolation lays his wasteful hand  Upon its vernal beauties noisom weeds  And brambly trash usurp the goodly soil  Where  Flora  gayly reign'd Now kingly pride  And vulgar superstition stored the world  With spurious deities while man transferr'd  To creatures vile the prostrate homage due  To the Supreme Creator He t' assert  His violated honour and maintain  An unadulterate faith in early days  Vouchsaf'd to  Terah  's offspring to impart  His name his will his promise Aftertimes  Beheld descending Deity in clouds  Of wavy smoke and spiryspreading flame  When on  Mount Sinai  's consecrated brow  Th' Almighty Monarch special presence gave  To  Israel  's trembling sons ten thousand saints  His high retinue clapp'd their golden wings  And thunders roar'd and nimble lightnings streak'd  The gloomy cloud while the big trumpet's voice

meditation takes  When from life's cares retiring she enjoys  Her closetmusings Sometimes lone she strays  Along the rocky beach at dead of night  By the moon's silver lamp nor heeds the winds  That whistle round nor notes the sullen surge  That beats the pebbled shore Or silent roves  Down the sequestred dale where Philomel  With melancholy music holds night's ear  Attentive to her plaint Or takes her stand  With folded arms and moveless eye beneath  Some ivymantled battlement once seat  Of a great lord but now reputed haunt  Of fays and sprites nocturnal Yet her thoughts  Which shun man's note to knowledge infinite  Are visible as characters inscrib'd  On monumental brass or works perform'd  With ostentatious shew to publick view  In the broad eye of day Such various forms  Assuming true devotion is the same  Vocal or intellectual Ah how low  How wild or how jejune the substitutes  Of rational Religion which the zeal  Of superstitious folly has devis'd  Or pious frenzy rais'd Glitt'ring parade  Or affectation of austerity  Is  Roman  godliness denoted now  By cowls and beads and lifted crucifix  Penance and fast and cloister'd solitude  And now exhibited in grand display  Of superficial pomp O what avails  This lavishment of splendor Will a God  Of purity immaculate accept  The lifeless off'rings of a carnal heart  Or periodic public abstinence  Atone for stolen luxury Nor more  Of reason or devotion hath the pride  Of zealots that in mad fanatic rage  Disclaim all government order renounce  And vent the product of a sickly brain  For spirit'al effusions with wan looks  And gesture wild and horrible grimace  And clamours strain'd amidst a staring crowd  Dealing damnation Keep me pow'r supreme  Alike from idle faith in fooleries  And from imagination's tenet dire  Child of despair or pride that circumscribes  Infinity and with a word  Predestination  dethrones  Thee from thy MERCYSEAT Give me a faith  Stedfast in him that bled a lively hope  An humble confidence an ardent love  And cordial charity that knows no bounds  Let virtue be my rule but not my boast  And death my expectation not my fear  Give me to live in peace cheerful to

To celebrate thy name  Thy prowess to deliver down  In monumental verse to future times  How marvellous was thy puissant arm  In  Memphian  ruins Now on eastern blasts  Born high vast clouds of

did paternal Providence sustain  A nation in the wilderness  With bread mirac'lous nourishment of Gods  And Spirits incorporeal Down  In heaps on heaps descending fell  The feather'd food  Diurnal sustenance that strew'd the camp  Plenteous as  Lybian  dust or sands  That line the shelvy beach When drought  Choak'd the parch'd soil the smitten rock  In copious streams discharg'd  His liquid treasures and a thousand rills  Purl'd thro' the burning plain The year reviv'd  And all was sprighly joy and all was laughing spring  VII  But Nature in her constant course proclaims  Her origin

'Till he that lighted first shall quench their fires  Spring  heads the seasons leading in his hand  His lusty children  Health  that hails the morn  With roseate cheek and  Strength  that stalks  With giant strides and brow erect  And  Beauty  queen of  May  while  Flora  strews  His verdant path with violets  And the wing'd habitants of air  Greet him with matin song Next  Summer  shews  His sunburnt countenance with genial heat  Warming the vegetable world  Thunder lightning sable storm  Wait on his pleasure armies that defend  His sultry reign from pestilence  That still annoys his borders Now  Autumn  great lord of harvest sends  His swarthy labour'rs to collect  The various tribute of the year  He stores his granaries with golden grain  And in possession of earth's riches smiles  At  Winter  's stern approach tho'  Winter  's self  Arm'd as he is with sharpfang'd frost  And barbed hail and smoth'ring snow  Locks weary nature up in sleep  Profound with friendly hand  In vigour fresh  To be rewak'd by  Spring  Thou Nature's Lord  Benign as mighty good as great  How does this wonderful vicissitude  Lift thy allglorious name  VIII  What language shall recite  Thy wonders or thy mercies in  The navigable deeps  Where active  Commerce  spreads her daring wing  Visiting round the globe Behold  How swift yon vessel speeds it's course  And skims along the level of the main  But sudden winds unseen  Creep from their caverns dark  Whistling insidious Now they swell  With rougher blast and now  Bellow with hideous voice and dreadful roar  Quick flit the fleecy clouds the wat'ry  South  Conducts the gloomy storm deep thunders roll  With angry rumblings lightning shoots  His vivid flash streaking the floods  With gleams of fire The winds the helpless bark  Toss like a feather now she rides  Upon the surge to heav'n now down she drops  To earth's deep centre Who shall still this rage  Thou that didst silence chaos At thy beck  Tumult and uproar cease the winds  Forget to blow the sea his waves  Smooths to a plain and  Phoebus  spreads around  The comfortable blaze of cloudless day  IX  O thou preserver of whatever breathes  The common vital air  Man beast fowl fish or reptile all  Thy providence munificent confess  Thou dealest plenty with a lib'ral hand  The feather'd songsters grateful chaunt  Thy praises pouring liquid melody  From their aerial seats  The beasts that slake their eager thirst  At many at stream that winds  His silver current thro' the vale  Know their preserver Loud  The lion's princely youngling roars  Seeking his food from thee When slumber seals  Man's eye and night imbrowns the world  With dreary gloom  The forest sends his savage natives forth  Roaming for prey They know their hour  Predestin'd and when morning marks  The welkin with her blush conscious retire  At once resigning day  Nor less their bounteous Maker own  The finny multitudes that dwell  The wat'ry regions from the smallest fry  That writhe like infects their exiguous forms  To huge leviathan  Lord of the floods that rolls his stately bulk  Sporting in Ocean Let not man be last  In grateful homage whose distinguish'd race  Stands first in favour 'Tis for him  Nature abounds with wealth For him  Earth air and sea are peopled 'Tis for him  The sun impregns the glebe the cloud distils  The fatness and the joyful valley sings  For him the ground rewarding culture's toil  Abundant yields the wheaten grain  Strengthner of human hearts  For him the grape swells with nectareous juice  Cordial of life that sooths  Our nat'ral griefs and gladdens worldly care  Laud then to him Most High And while  Creation joins in gen'ral chorus thou  O thou praise God my soul  A MORNING THOUGHT  NIGHT in her fablest mantle had close wrapt  The peaceful world and o'er the lid of toil  His heavy mace slowwaving downrob'd sleep  Held mortals bound in his oblivious chain  When chanticleer first herald that proclaims  Returning day soon as the greyey'd dawn  Sprinkles with scanty beams the mountain's brow  Pour'd thro' his outstretched neck his shrilling notes  Startling the reign of silence I awoke  And gave my still attention to the call  Of this quotidian monitor Methought  His summons typified those final sounds  That shall hereafter from death's leaden sleep  Arouse all nations when the  trump of God  Shall vent it's blast sonorous louder than  The brazen voice of clarions when they blow  Prologue to battle or the rattling roar  Of twice ten thousand thunders while big shouts  Of angels and archangels rend the frame  Of universal nature How my soul  Hangs hov'ring o'er the thought And now the sun  Threw wide the windows of the blushing east  And led the newborn day Delighted Spring  Look'd cheerfully and welcom'd his fair orb  With all her fragrance whilst the feather'd tribes  In various strains and warblings sweetly wild  Hail'd his enliv'ning splendor Glorious scene  Yet what is this to that transcendent blaze  That lustre pure refin'd ineffable  Which shall invest the  Sun of righteousness  At his last awful advent What is this  'Tis dusk 'tis cloud 'tis shade 'tis pitchy night  Now opes the scene of immortality  Prospect stupendous Nature's dyingday  Is birthday to a life unknowing end  Inquire then O my soul where where is now  The pageantry of pow'r the vaunt of pride  And high ambition grasping at the globe  Where now the fame of  Caesar  Where the flow'rs  That laughing pleasure so profusely strew'd  Before youth's roving eye Or where the wealth  That swell'd the bags of av'rice Where the cares  That harass'd manhood and o'erloaded age  The film which  Zephyr  sweeps from yonder bud  Hath substance more compact Come then my soul  Heiress of bliss survivor of the worlds  Prepare thee for thine audit Stretch thy view  Beyond this span of being into lengths  Illimitable from heav'n's wardrobe take  The  garments  of  salvation  wear the  robe  Of  righteousness begird  thyself with  truth  Put on  array more billiant than e'er deck'd  Bridegroom apparell'd for his nuptial hour  And DRESS this  morning  for eternity  A THOUGHT That occurred to the AUTHOR in passing through WESTMINSTER ABBEY  THESE solemn scenes all lighter thoughts controul  They are an entertainment for the soul  Awe corrects pleasure Round I throw my eyes  And ages past to recollection rise  Kings patriots sages heroes bards appear  Sure all that's great and good was buried here  If tombstones tell us truth that prose those rhymes  Are strong reproaches on the present times  But if they lie the fulsom'st thing that's said  To sooth the living but insults the dead  I feel emotions warm my bosom raise  At this profusion of licentious praise  Is there a God above who does not know  Our virtues 'till they're sculptur'd here below  The best with labour earn immortal bliss  Look here and not a creature does amiss  When these bold  Gothic  buildings shall decay  And monuments themselves shall mould away  When time resistless shall destroy our bust  And blot the verse that dignifies our dust  When marble records shall no more declare  That  Newton Shakespeare Milton Dryden  were  Then virtue clear'd and vice abash'd shall prove  Our characters are  drawn at their fulllength above  TO A WORM WHICH THE AUTHOR ACCIDENTALLY TRODE UPON  METHINKS thou writhest as in rage  But dying

On princes they have richly fed  When their vast work was done  And monarchs have regal'd vile worms  Who first the world had won  Let vengeance then thine exit cheer  Nor at thy fate repine  Legions of worms who knows how soon  Shall feast on me and mine  TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF FORTUNE WITH AN ALMANACK  YOUNG friend of twenty ent'ring fresh  A world of care and strife  Read in the circle of the year  A lecture upon life  Thou think'st Time halts on leaden  feet  Tho' Time is on the  wing  Nor seest a Winter to thy days  Because 'tis yet but Spring  Now dimpled pleasure to thy view  Presents scenes bright and gay  But thorns invest the sweetest flow'rs  That paint the bloomy  May  Ambition will thy manly prime  Allure with many a call  As Summers cherish golden fruits  That ripen but to fall  Wealth to thy waning age belike  Shall glitt'ring hoards display  But Autumn's still tho' plenty crown'd  The season of decay  Old Age is Winter Winter brings  Indeed a cheerless hour  Where now is vernal beauty Where  Is pleasure pomp or pow'r  The Seasons then may teach thy youth  To form the prudent plan  An  Almanack  will serve to shew  The chequer'd state of man  Look down the margent of each month  Observe the weather's train  Now  calm  and  clear  attract your eye  Now  cloud  and  wind  and  rain  So joys and cares thro' various life  Altern emotions raise  'Twere folly to expect to bask  In sunshine all your days  'Tis worth your pains to mark for sure  'Twill rouse an honest pride  That regal list you'll see what kings  Were born and reign'd and died  Here  's all th' account of what they did  Or worthy or amiss  Dear youth secure a fairer page  Of History than  this  May no dishonest paltry deed  Obstruct thy road to fame  No baseness  visibly eclipse  The splendor of thy name  So shalt thou flourish in renown  Amongst the good and great  So reap eternal bliss when time  Itself is  out of date  THE BAROMETER  IN things quite out of common guess  Strong emblems oft you'll find  The  atmosphere  for instance shews  The race of womankind  Sallies of rage and passion's gusts  Some female breasts deform  And these are well denoted by  Much  tempest  and loud  storm  By vapours press'd with  clouded  brow  And still in weeping vein  Your tender melting things methinks  Are typified by  rain  Most of the sex inconstant are  Fickle from high to low  As weather in this clime too oft  Is  changeable  you know  If smiles give life to beauty's cheek  All gay and debonair  'Tis like the face of nature when  The glass is up at  fair  But when Religion

you've known the case  Make depredations on thy face  Or sanguine pimples flush thy cheek  So fair so bloomy and so sleek  Or casualties or nat'ral harms  Despoil thy alltriumphant charms  Shouldst

VANITY A SATIRE  O For the manly wrath the noble rage  That pointed ev'ry verse in ev'ry page  Of angry  Juvenal  or the keen stroke  Of  Horace  whose severity of joke  Laid folly low and knav'ry brought to shame  Or the satiric Muse of equal name  That fir'd immortal  Pope  's prolific brain  Young  's nervous line and  Dryden  's cutting strain  Our age is mark'd with fool'ries that would call  For the best wit or blackest spleen of all  'Tis  Vanity  that all the world can draw  It hath the force of Gospel and of law  Amongst old  Adam  's offspring there's no strife  Like that of shining in this mortal life  It is the thought the plan the dream the whole  Wish and ambition of the worldling's soul  This one grand aim we steadily pursue  As inclination points and whimsey too  Some hope respect or envy to engage  With novelty or glare of equipage  Time was precursors could our worth proclaim  And runningfootmen tript us into fame  Now with parade more solemn we approach  And servants hang in clusters to the coach  One keeps smart grooms fine steeds and coursers able  The temple of his fame is his own stable  Another nobly lives with splendor treats  And man becomes immortal as he eats  These Taste in lofty palaces display  And we have  Babels  building ev'ry day  Who but his daring fancy must approve  That without  faith  whole  mountains  can  remove    Or bids new streams in unknown channels go  And teaches wand'ring rivers where to flow  Nature subdued to skilful labour yields  And barren heaths commence  Elysian  fields  "How Sir all state all art all works deride"  Mistake not 'tis not  use  I blame but  pride  The things heav'n sends us are commodious things  And princes born should live like  sons of kings  Steeds chariots villas suit the man of sense  They are his comforts  not  his excellence  Life should be decent grand as means afford  What is so little as a little Lord  A noble spirit marks the great and wise  But Monarchs selfsufficient I despise  Nay fruits of bold design just praise command  When  Genius  takes  Convenience  by the hand  And what is undertook is understood  The true projector is a publick good  Bridgewater  's name shall glide thro' ev'ry age  And makes a glorious botch in Satire's page  Look round the surface of the globe you'll see  Nought more contagious is than Vanity  All pant with longings to be rich and great  And emulate their betters in estate  Pomp is our idol we indulge in show  Appearance is the only thing below  For this we toil watch cozen forge swear lie  There is no sin on earth but poverty  Nay more we yield to be distress'd for this  Make our own troubles and in seeming bliss  Labour with grievance real  Crispus  clear  Hath less than twice two hundred pounds a year  Yet little as such substance will afford  He eats drinks whores and gambles with my lord  Among the foremost shines at balls or play  For ever anxious and for ever gay  And now he riggles 'neath the gripe of law  And  mortgage  on his lands lays iron paw  Ills upon ills beset his harass'd life  He hears in tortures a complaining wife  He storms he curses throws the blame on fate  While duns incessant thunder at his gate  His folly is reflection's endless theme  Care haunts his walk and horror rides his dream  'Till at the last all his misfortunes meet  In one and  Crispus  figures in the  Fleet  Few see the sorrows that with splendors mix  Can man be wretched with a coach and six  Such sentiment the worldly fool reveals  Who thinks there is no woe but  that  he feels  At least to keep a carriage and a pair  Is requisite for decency and  air  Borne thro' some country town th' admiring throng  Believe us great ones as we whirl along  All eyes behold us when we gaily roam  But we can keep our miseries at home  Pride how prepost'rous is thy burning itch  Sure people should have riches to be rich  'Tis not in common language to express  The pleasure or the privilege of dress  It is the most commodious thing on earth  It covers exigence supposes birth  Supplies defect of dignity or grace  And gives to impudence itself a face  Mortals of lofty spirits when unknown  Command attention from their garb alone  And ere today by virtue of fine cloaths  Tailors have danc'd and barbers rank'd with beaus  You'll scarce discern as cases may be laid  Between a countess and a chambermaid  Both seem alike welldrest alike wellbred  And painted streamers wave from either head  Some taste and judgment must detect a cheat  The silks of  LudgateHill  and  MonmouthStreet  Glow with an equal tint to vulgar eyes  And often our best ornaments are lies  Sometimes as soon a story shall explain  Just disappointment mortifies the vain  A lawyer's dapper clerk of slender skill  Who brandish'd with reluctant hand the quill  Was pert and proud talk'd much but little meant  In short his coatwas his accomplishment  I mean his first for he could sing and dance  Take snuff read novels and discourse of  France  With fluency of insignificance  Full oft he past in splendor of attire  For what he pleas'd lord baronet or 'squire  A man of taste and elegance refin'd  One that had studied life and knew mankind  It happen'd once as anecdotes declare  What boots it my good reader when or where  Our hero inn'd in a snug countrytown  The house for rhymesake we will call the  Crown    "What noise was that" "Th' assembly's held to night"  His car devours the tidings with delight  Suppose we now all previous matters set  In order and this  belle assembly  met  Our stranger spruce and trim and debonair  Attracts respect the chief male figure there  Among the females with superior grace  Of person and soft symmetry of face  Vanessa  shone the swain that sees her dies  Nothing her dress outsparkles but her eyes  Her lovely head a load of plumage bore  Such as we read old  Homer  's heroes wore  Sweetly she prattled while attention hung  Upon the pretty lispings of her tongue  Allconscious of commanding charms she moves  And round her skipt a train of little loves  Our spark who ever thought it bounden duty  To prostrate to preeminence of beauty  And in this fairone could distinctly see  Virtue wit breeding fortune family  Humbly the favour of her hand implores  To join the dance enjoys it and adores  Now in her ear he labours to impart  His fervent love and throbbings of his heart  In whispers owns her beauty's sov'reign pow'r  Like a bee buzzing round some maiden flow'r  Hops smiles sighs ogles moans yet joys his pains  Like a tame monkey frisking in his chains  Full he appears to all her slave confest  And envy tortures ev'ry female breast  Wellpleas'd  Vanessa  hails this happy night  Her bosom flutters with the dear delight  And to herself in native pride says she  This is indeed a conquest worthy me  The bell beats twelve the hour of parting's come  And now the universal word is home  For countrygirls are not like cityjades  That waste the livelong night at masquerades  Our 'squire officious will conduct his fair  To her nighneighb'ring mansion his fond care  Reluctant she declines he still insists  In forms a lover does the thing he lists  O mark how soon realities destroy  The neatest fabric of ideal joy  Soon as they reach'd her father's clumsy doors  The surly guardian of his leather stores  With barkings loud assails our wooers ear  Above in painted rows  boots shoes  appear  He smokes his fair plebeian "pretty dear  "Remember me to  Crispin"  rude he cries  And scornful from his pouting charmer flies  Yet justly neither party could complain  No lady she and he no gentle swain  Time was will such a time be known again  When only gentry liv'd like gentlemen  When people dress'd and fed like what they were  And income was the rule of daily fare  When housewifery the decent pantry stor'd  And prudence order'd the convivial board  Most tables were supplied with ease for why  Pudding and beef and beer was luxury  Each social dinner now must be a treat  And there are thousands study what to eat  Lo Vanity her various charms displays  How rich how beautiful your sideboard's blaze  Promise of high repast Th' expectants feel  Complacence and premeditate the meal  Now sav'ry viands wellarrang'd appear  The sight an alderman himself might cheer  In turns the bounties of the season smoke  And costly wines fresh appetite provoke  The guests profusely in your praise descant  This how superb and that how elegant  The point is gain'd you reach the wish'dfor fame  And all but  creditors  applaud your name  There are those halfbred dames whose mode is such  They plague by being civil overmuch  Simp'ring they do the honours of the feast  "Sir can you make a dinner I protest  There's nothing to be got You'll sadly fare  Pray taste the pheasant will you try the hare"  We sooth our vanity a hundred ways  Unjust abuse is the high road to praise  But such impertinence is strangely vain  And tho' no vice will teaze us more than ten  Facts are sure vouchers else you'd swear I dream  'Tis wonderful what folks will do to  seem  One cornice will a ream of paper waste  And brilliant di'monds are compos'd of paste  Glass stands for china and the massy weight  Of burnish'd candlesticks is  pure French plate  Some entertain you by mere dint of force  And will almost  create  a second course  With a few dishes they their friends regale  But they are twenty if you go by tale  Here couch'd in salt four eggs attract your eye  And there a leash of swarthy walnuts lie  Here shreds of butter neatly shav'd appear  And half a dozen olives justle there  Nay at some tables of the great we know  Provisions enter less for use than shew  Day after day the formal board they grace  You might suppose each viand knew its place  They are the standing dishes of the year  Not part of but th'  appendix  to your cheer  Nothings are potted nought's beneath that lid  The whole is handsome but one half forbid  My Lady these by law of usage gives  They are not eatables but  expletives  I've heard of dainties if truth some aver  Which he who carves must be a  carpenter    Viz  fowls tongues sundry articles of  wood  Perpetual representatives of food  'Tis lofty precedent that makes us fools  And thro' the world fantastic fashion rules  We set no limits to our vain desires  'Squires rival lords and yeomen rival 'squires  Is it in Christian patience to endure  Highlife burlesqu'd and state in miniature  Some domes are neat and some excel in glory  Bur ev'ry bandbox has its attic story  A rambler oft in his excursions sees  Two crooked sticks form a  chevaux de frife  Meandring streamlets are from ditches made  And spouts lowbending dribble a cascade  Pebbles and moss and beads together got  Are  Merlin  's cavern or  Calypso  's grot  Sometimes a  pasteboard  bridge displays it's show  O'er the dull muddy brook that creeps below  'Tis foolery too gross to be deny'd  When Avarice goes hand in hand with Pride  Then hoarded gold is rather squeez'd than spent  We are halfmean and half magnificent  Missello  's seat to common view will shew  Like  Wilton  's splendour or the pomp of  Stowe  There niggard Vanity has play'd his part  And awkard Labour sav'd the costs of Art  Grim  Tritons  there in empty basons play  And  Neptune  scorches in the noontide ray  A meekey'd  Pallas  grasps her harmless spear  And ghastly  Cupids  like young imps appear  Diana  looks most smirking and most civil  And  Venus  is as ugly as the dl  A shatter'd greenhouse feebly lengthens there  Tott'ring with age and groaning for repair  There broken slates and many a crazy pane  With hospitable gap invite the rain  While sick exotics shake as  Eurus  blows  And myrtles droop beneath oppressive snows  Here pictures bought at auctions boast no names  But strike th' admiring eye with tawdry frames  Fine drawings are expensive useless stuff  The rooms are  fitted up  and that's enough  Or thickdaub'd portraits which your sight abhors  Will pass extremely well for ancestors  Yet may one plea  Misello  's fame secure  He is a  chapman  not a  connoiseur  And understands not  taste  in  furniture  Look round about and thousands you will see  Vain of a little  spriggy  pedigree  In  Wales  high birth is ev'ry native's claim  And num'rous tribes exult in  Tudor  's name  Dick  lets us know with triumph of delight  His grandsire's second cousin was a knight  An alderman a sheriff and lord mayor  Elate with this connection  Dick  will stare  Strut cock his hat affect the man of note  And now his honour pawn and now his coat  As big as Nobles look most folks agree  A little blood may serve a family  As a few sanguine drops the tide will stain  And roll a tinctur'd current to the main  There are experience shews who cannot trace  One ancestor to dignify their race  Nor yet have worth or spirit to make known  A gallant deed or virtue of their own  No creatures so deserving are of scorn  Except the scndrls that are highly born  Who basely to all sense of honour lost  Disgrace their birth and blot the line they  boast  Were we to judge by practice sure some hold  That merit is transferrable like gold  That virtue thro' all progeny will run  And fame like land descend from son to son  Nay stranger still where vice and folly reign  Monstrous effect the wicked will be vain  Let bold corruption once invert all rules  The best are madmen and the wisest fools  'Mongst libertines that systems can unmake  Men will be vile for reputation's sake  Have we not liv'd flagitious feats to see  Vaunted by coxcombs in iniquity  Have we not mark'd in this licentious town  Rakes in esteem and rscls of renown  O come Religion thy soft balm impart  To melt into remorse each harden'd heart  Religion come

Affecting to be great we laughter move  Aspiring to be good we challenge love  Virtue can never low or mean appear  And ev'ry peasant may adorn his sphere  The souls of honest men with scorn look down  On uncarn'd greatness and a tarnish'd crown  At that perhaps advancing dreadful day  When wealth shall melt and grandeur mould away  Who's good who's bad Omniscience shall enquire  And all

both undone  As tulips must be skreen'd from wind and sun  He scents the atmosphere and all he meets  Poisons with fragrancy he  stinks  of  sweets  Whene'er this fribbler comes across your sight  You term him Coxcomb and you term him right  But some there are who as absurdly shew  The very contrast to this brittle beau  And they are Coxcombs too I'd have you know  Dick Loutly  so neglectful is of dress  He will torment your eye with nastiness  His hands are dirty greasy are his chops  His beard's a bramble and his wig a copse  Your housemaid frets whene'er she sees him come  He's worse than twenty spaniels in a room  Elab'rate spruceness gives a man the spleen  Yet we were all created  to be seen  In short the Muses no extremes will spare  We loath alike a monkey and a bear  Let  medium  be the rule I would not stop  Or at a dunghill or perfumer's shop  There's odds for illustrations offer pat  Betwixt rank  Reynard  and a  Civetcat  By usage we deem coxcomb fop or beau  While ev'ry man that's  singular  is so  Would you be sure your conduct shall not err  The point is still to act in character  Ambition should be taught to reason well  For some have fail'd by meaning to excel  Charles  of the North a memorable name  Wish'd to surpass the  Macedonian  's fame  The  Greek  luxurious quaff'd wines strong and rich  The  Swede  would guzzle water from a ditch  That  in gay  Persian  robes attracted note  This  was distinguish'd by a threadbare coat  One dallying soft with wanton whores was seen  'Tother would turn his back upon a queen  For want of understanding one plain rule  This royal sober sloven was a fool  Some from propriety  affect  to stray  And long to be immortal the wrong way  A frantic wretch  Diana  's Temple fir'd  Pray is his name detested or admir'd  Stern  Nero  had a view to strange renown  When in a frolic he consum'd the town  Th' Imperial Fiddler with pleas'd eye survey'd  The spreading flames  Rome  burnt the Monarch play'd  Loathsome to all his memory remains  And he is curst for ever for his pains  Then call not Coxcomb only him or him  The term belongs to villainy and whim  To ev'ry single soul throughout the nation  That's mark'd by any  kind  of  affectation  Tom Snarlwell  is a Coxcomb tho' no beau  He is an oracle to all the row  Statesman at club or coffeehouse most able  He lays down politics for all the table  In truth tho' silent you'd believe him wise  He looks so very knowing with his eyes  With patriotic zeal he shews his hate  To ev'ry blund'ring Minister of State  Like a true  Briton  without fear or doubt  Censures all  in  and magnifies all  out  Now fixes ev'ry measure to  his  test  And now demonstrates 's system best  He knows the Constitution to a T  And is  impertinent  because he's  free  Numbers extol  Tom  's fluent eloquence  His strong sagacity his manly sense  Yet so perversely have the fates decreed  Tom  can scarce  write  a line that you can read  Flirtilla  lively beautiful and young  Has a  perpetual motion  in her tongue  Her lungs not wit most folks with wonder strike  She talks of all things and of all alike  And while discoursing ev'ry heart beguiles  With piercing glances and coquetish smiles  The ceaseless prattle charm'd her audience hears  The nonsense sounds so sweetly in their ears  Music for want of sense atonement brings  We rail not at the bird that always sings  The grave  Prudissa  with a face as fair  Sits serious as a quaker in her chair  'Tis with reluctance she can silence break  She holds it is immodesty to speak  Her looks precise all am'rous hopes destroy  You'd think she bore antipathy to joy  That  prattles ever  this  will nothing say  But both are pretty Coxcombs in their way  We love romantic tales tho' by the bye  It will require some parts  to tell a lie  There must be happy manner air and grace  And calm stagnation of protesting face  Think not without a talent to deceive  Readiest believers don't all folks believe  'Tis strange what lengths adepts in falsehood try  To cram you with impossibility  Were but a tenth of what's reported done  'Twould be a full reply to  Mddltn  Enlarge at will ye travellers that roam  But why so many miracles at home  The formal Pedant better taught than bred  With a fine group of classicks in his head  Plagues you with Learning ever out of place  He darts a  Latin  sentence in your face  He cannot speak ten words without quotation  And lards your meal with piebald conversation  The Ladies laugh the Captain shakes his head  At something which he  thinks  the Doctor said  Whate'er the wit or sense such prigs advance  I'm better pleas'd with cheerful ignorance  Shall we proceed O what extremes we see  In "civil leer" and rough rusticity  One cringes bows and springs to your embrace  Another gapes or hiccups in your face  Manners uncouth 'gainst decency transgress  And complaisance is painful in excess  Tom Brazenface  assumes a thousand airs  In terms that shock you when he speaks he swears  Deals wantonly in imprecations vain  And is for horrid humour's sake profane  Or vents vile thoughts in language gross and mean  Loose without sense and without wit obscene  In wounding the chaste ear he has an end  For 'tis his sole ambition to offend  And yet if we reverse this odious case  What more disgusts us than  affected  grace  No colours can th' abandon'd sinner paint  But such as could describe an  outside saint  Whose meagre countenance and solemn mien  Is sanctity that labours to be  seen  Who under pious speech and eye demure  Forms knavish plans or harbours thoughts impure  The world with gross hypocrisy beguiles  And righteous is because he never smiles  Whose godliness is shew and virtue art  Saint in his face and villain at his heart  The ground of these strange whims 'twere vain to hide  'Tis emulation or mistaken pride  An ancient proverb and as good as any  Assures us in plain terms  one fool makes many  Nor can  Example  's infl'ence be denied  'Tis almost ev'ry hour  exemplified  Most serious truth which ever should have  weight  With all but to a  scruple  with the great  Our imitation is our daily strife  And nothing is more catching than high life  One trifling Lord that's delicate or vain  Shall have a thousand foplings in his train  Our habits customs manners vices sports  Savour of greatness and derive from courts  When crookback'd  Richard  rear'd his sceptre high  'Tis said that ev'ry Courtier went awry  When great  Eliza  sat at  Britain  's helm  No female neck was seen throughout the realm  In  Charles  's days all lewdness was approv'd  "All by the King's example liv'd and lov'd"  Yet highest patterns now won't set us  right    We are not  good  enough to be  polite  O monstrous proof of Vice's boundless swing  John Wlks  shall make more converts than the  Kg  Some folks are studious to find grounds for strife  And to be thought wellbred illtreat a wife  Rail at the nuptial yoke in words of course  And sigh for cash to purchase a divorce  While haply this same consort is discreet  Fair virtuous decent elegantly neat  But joys are fled when liberty is flown  And 'tis such lowlife to be tied to one  Blest with snug means and competent estate  These blockheads  might  be happier than the great  But Coxcombs reigning vices fain would try  And are rank rascals tho' they scarce know why  I knew a wretch record him O my rhymes  That  strove  to ape the manners of the times  High precedent he made his conduct's rule  And had just sense enough to be a fool  By nature dull a finish'd rake he'd be  Yet was at best an aukward debauchee  No age has witness'd to so strange a case  He could not serve the dvl with a grace  Of horses he had studs in various places  He had a passion for  Newmarket  races  He could a double character assume  Of gentleman and jockey 'squire and groom  Vain without taste expensive without art  He was an arrant miser in his heart  His thousands he has  squander'd  but ne'er  spent  In common life a shilling with content  Proud without spirit active without fire  Gay without joy and lewd without desire  A Libertine profest would blush to name  His brutish deeds and yet he  look'd  so tame  You'd think him innocent for very fear  He was a villain with a  booby  's leer  He pouted slouch'd like one dispos'd to sleep  His betters have been hang'd for stealing sheep  Of ladies fair he kept a buxom brace  But hardly ever look'd them in the face  These fleec'd  his  substance in one plan combin'd  Who wou'd not give a groat to save mankind  The paltry character has held me long  It finishes my theme it crowns my song  The race of Coxcombs is a num'rous tribe  Heav'n give myself to shun what I describe  Give me to act a plain consistent part  From affectation free and void of art  With caution to eschew each mode that draws  On conduct just reproach or false applause  To seek no road by odd fantastic ways  To fame but look into myself for praise  Or censure to myself attention lend  My little good improve my follies mend  STREPHON and THYRSIS A PASTORAL  NOW had bright  Phoebus  clos'd a gaudy day  And sober Ev'ning wore her robe of gray  Hush'd were the winds no sound but from the rill  That pour'd its limpid murmurs down the hill  Or from the bleatings of the num'rous flocks  That playful echo bandy'd round the rocks  The winged songsters ceas'd the bird of night  Thro' the brown vale slow took his solemn flight  Strephon  and  Thyrsis  met upon the plain  And simply thus began th' alternate strain  THYRSIS  Why homeward hastens  Strephon  so cast down  Is there such mischief in a wench's frown  Would thou wert blest like me the birds that fly  So brisk so blithe are scarce so blest as I  STREPHON  Ah  Thyrsis  thou art happy far above  The neighb'ring shepherds all in  Chloe  's love  But  Phyllida  is cold to all I say  Cold as a blast that nips the buds in  May  THYRSIS  How many a yeoman in  Great Britain  's isle  Would give his team to purchase  Chloe  's smile  But love makes trifles bounties see look here  These apples are a present to my dear  STREPHON  'Twas but this morning purblind  Cupid  knows  I tender'd to my lass a damask rose  With scorn so ladylike away 'twas thrown  Yet  Thyrsis  by my troth 'twas newly blown  THYRSIS  My love and I together still are seen  At market in the fold or on the green  My crook she plays with prattles by my side  And all the parish sees she'll be my bride  STREPHON  My damsel's proud to let the village know  Her preference for  Lubbinol  my foe  Yet to my eye he is the ugliest swain  That ever tended sheep upon the plain  THYRSIS  When 'neath the branching oak in yonder mead  At eventide I tune my slender reed  The sprightly notes delight the list'ning swains  And  Chloe  's pleas'd and thanks me for my pains  STREPHON  Once at our wake with my best skill and air  I sung the ballad which I bought at fair  Pert  Phylly  cry'd we'll hear the squall no more  And snatching from my hand the ballad tore  THYRSIS  Oft as in turn the jovial seasons come  Gay shearingtime or jolly harvesthome  Chloe  and I regale we laugh we sing  Time merry glides and all the year is Spring  STREPHON  To me alas alike each morning low'rs  In vain soft  April  sheds her silver show'rs  Nor can I joy despair so wounds my breast  Or peace on workdays or on  Sundays  rest  THYRSIS  My love is cheerful or at work or play  Smiling she binds the sheaf she teds the hay  Nought o'er her easy temper can prevail  She'll sing beneath the largest milkingpail  STREPHON  Still  Phyllis  pays my wooings with a frown  She tosses up her head she calls me clown  Nought but high airs and sour disdain I see  She never smiles or never smiles on me  THYRSIS  The sun shall stop the wind forget to blow  The stars to twinkle and the stream to flow  The lamb to bleat the busy bee to rove  Ere  Cloe  's false or  Thyrsis  cease to love  STREPHON  Would I could rid me of this cruel fair  Would I could break the bond I groan to bear  I'll try my best resolve to be a man  And learn to hate this vixen if I can  The night drew on apace the shepherds part  That  whistling as he tript  this  with a heavy heart  THE PROGRESS of LOVE IN FOUR PASTORAL BALLADS AFTER THE MANNER OF MR SHENSTON  FALLING IN LOVE PART I  YE Swains that confess the sweet sway  Of  Cupid  that pow'r so divine  And offerings cheerfully pay  At Beauty's allpowerful shrine  That know what it is to endure  But know not what 'tis to complain  Nor wish for your anguish a cure  And cherish the strongthrobbing pain  II  Ye Nymphs who disclaim prudish arts  Whose bosoms can hold a warm sigh  Who kindly discover your hearts  By softness that melts in your eye  That brighten with smiles your fair brows  When gracefully prest by some youth  Whose countenance warrants his vows  Pour'd all from a fountain of truth  III  All lovers attend to my verse  For lovers my verse will approve  And smile on the lays that rehearse  The delicate progress of Love  But hence ye unfeeling begone  Still bent private ends to pursue  Ye wordlings will frown on my song  The subject's too tender for you  IV  The zephyrs 'gan softly to blow  The wood's feather'd warblers to sing  The meads made a beautiful show  And gay were the daughters of Spring  When lone thro' the thickdaified vale  With freedom of fancy I stray'd  And there Muse record the fond tale  There first I beheld the dear maid  V  A bevy of damsels so neat  Hard by me came tripping to fair  You'd have thought they had wings on their feet  But O what a damsel was there  They tell us of  Graces  of yore  And they talk of a  Paphian Queen    But never believe me before  So peerless a beauty was seen  VI  No painter with pencil could trace  Tho' dipt in the richest of dies  The sweetness that dwelt in that face  The brightness that beam'd from those eyes  No poet tho' poets they say  Of all your fine writers are best  Could tell my heart's feeling that day  Unless he could read in my breast  VII  I shall not attempt to recite  The raptures that glow'd in my mind  She flew like a bird out of sight  But left her fair image behind  My thought was employ'd all the day  Those charms the delectable theme  And when on my pillow I lay  They pleasingly furnish'd my dream  VIII  I rose with the larks of the dale  Indulging my softgrowing care  I meant not to go to the vale  But wander'd and found myself there  I travers'd the lawn to and fro  I loaded the welkin with sighs  And this you'll call folly but know  I wish not again to be wise  IX  My love had bewilder'd me quite  I met an acquaintance of mine  He ask'd me the time of the night  I told him the Nymph was divine  Engagements I made without end  And broke 'em tho' ever so new  For he may be false to his friend  Who most to his passion is true  X  At length to myself thus I said  As pensive I rambled one morn  Oh could I address the dear maid  An angel's a stranger to scorn  My secret I burn to reveal  In language untutor'd by art  She'll pity at least what I feel  I long to unburthen my heart  LOVE DISCOVERED PART II  ONE eve of the sweetbreathing  May  I first became known to my dear  Ye Muses remember the day  And name it the prime of the year  The moments were socially spent  The time with discourse was beguil'd  She look'd with a look of content  And O how she look'd when she smil'd  II  She mark'd my respectful distress  She construed my halfsmother'd sighs  The belov'd have a wonderful guess  And lovers can speak with their eyes  Methought too she joy'd that sweet night  That thought gave anxiety ease  'Twas transport to yield her delight  An exquisite pleasure to please  III  Acquaintance augmented the fire  That strong in my bosom was blown  And soon to my eager desire  I met my fair maiden alone  The birds cheer'd the woodlands with song  The lilies enamell'd the grove  The brook softly murmur'd along  And sure 'twas a season for love  IV  This this was the muchsigh'd for hour  My passion at large to display  Yet now it was full in my pow'r  In vain I strove something to say  Of matters insipid I talk'd  As tho' we'd no business together  And thrice I observ'd as we walk'd  "Indeed 'tis most excellent weather"  V  Doubts fears and an aukward restraint  Which best our sincerity prove  Prevented my tender complaint  There's not such a coward as love  Complacent she seem'd all this while  Myself seem'd like one that was chid  As tho' there were pride in a smile  Or sweetness itself cou'd forbid  VI  I thought I'd take courage next day  I met her again in the grove  But  Strephon  was now in the way  A witness is hateful to love  He was dress'd in his holiday clothes  Trick'd out like a finical ass  I never could bear your trim beaus  That make themselves fine in a glass  VII  He gave himself many an air  As great as a lord of the land  Could prattle and ogle and swear  And once he kiss'd  Phyllida  's hand  I saw saucy hope in his eye  I saw no disdain in her look  If  Phyllida  had not been by  I'd plung'd his curl'd locks in the brook  VIII  The day I began with delight  I clos'd with a sorrowful breast  I wish'd from my soul for the night  Tho' night could afford me no rest  Ye mock at such sighs and such groans  Who never felt Jealousy's smart  There's not a true lover but owns  No place is so sore as the heart  IX  All night I lay tossing perplext  With cares which uncertainties bring  Now hopeless now mad to be vext  By such a light fluttering thing  But Reason in vain lends her aid  Such feelings as these to remove  Fond lovers are always afraid  And trifles are torments in love  LOVE DECLARED PART III  THE morn spread her blush o'er the plain  Serene was the region above  I wil  lly nourish'd my pain  I sigh'd and I stray'd to the grove  But never let lovers despair  'Cause sometimes things happen amiss  For whom should I meet but my fair  And O what a meeting was this  II  Her eye such a softness possest  Her air was so placidly gay  It scatter'd the cloud from my breast  As sunshine enlivens the day  Reviv'd I determin'd at last  To act if I could like a man  My bosom I felt beating fast  I faulter'd but thus I began  III  Dear  Phyllida  list to the strain  Humility pours in your ear  Ah do not despise a poor swain  Who shews you his faith in his fear  Can we hide if we would from the fair  The conquests they make with their eyes  Then let me my passion declare  Who cannot my passion disguise  IV  'Tis bold an attempting to move  A damsel so matchless as you  It may be a folly to love  It is not a crime to be true  What tho' with the sprucepowder'd cit  Your  Corydon  pass for a clown  There's much of assurance and wit  But little of truth in the town  V  My cattle's a plentiful stock  My barns are well loaded with grain  And healthy my numerous flock  That white with their fleeces the plain  But hope I to win thee with these  Or goods of much value beside  Ah no I've ambition to please  And only my love is my pride  VI  I could live with content in a cot  With  Phyllida  eas'd of all care  And bless the contemptible lot  That happily settled us there  Soft lodg'd in my  Phyllida  's arms  My bliss would admit no increase  Parade for the wise has no charms  And Plenty is nothing to Peace  VII  In  Phyllida  's hand is my fate  In  Phyllida  's smile is my joy  O do not destroy me with hate  Such sweetness can never destroy  Forgive if you cannot be kind  And constant for ever I'll be  If I'm not the man to your mind  The world has no woman for me  VIII  I paus'd and I bow'd most profound  Her soft hand I tremblingly prest  She cast her fair eyes on the ground  A sigh seem'd to 'scape from her breast  Then blushing she midly replied  Here  Corydon  cease the fond strain  By  Strephon  thy truth I have tried  Tomorrow I'll meet you again  LOVE REWARDED PART IV  WHAT tongue can the pleasure express  The transport expanding the mind  When lovers foresee their success  And nymphs grow insensibly kind  Embolden'd my joys to pursue  My courtship I daily renew'd  And oh how delightsom to woo  When  Phyllida  wish'd to be woo'd  II  Come say can you faithfully count  The waves that incessantly roar  Or tell me precise the amount  Of pebbles that garnish the shore  O then you'll exactly recite  The raptures fond Gratitude shews  When blest in his mistress's sight  The heart of a swain overflows  III  The linnets have tunable throats  And larks that soar over the hill  And sweetly the nightingale's notes  The meadows with melody fill  But vain are these voices to cheer  And pow'rless that music to move  To the sound that enchanted my ear  When  Phyllida  whisper'd I love  IV  One favour I yet had to seek  And that was to make her my brides  I ask'd and the blush in her cheek  With softness bewitching comply'd  My heart had no more to pursue  Love's task became innocent play  And  Corydon  nought had to do  But wish a long fortnight away  V  At length came the morning so bright  Sure never a brighter could shine  Which gave me my soul's first delight  And made my dear  Phyllida  mine  May time to our mutual content  The blessings of wedlock improve  And friendship the union cement  We sweetly contracted in love  A RHAPSODY IN PRAISE

 in the Common Hall On the Fifth Day of NOVEMBER As the AUTHOR's EXERCISE on that ANNIVERSARY Its Date must be its Apology  I  I'LL sing you what past  In the century last  When the Pope went to visit the Dvl  And if you'll attend  You'll find to a friend  Old  Nick  can behave very civil  II  How dost do quoth the Seer  What a plague brought you here  To be sure 'twas a whimsical maggot  Come draw tow'rd the fire  Nay prithee sit nigher  Here sirrah lay on t'other faggot  III  You're welcome to hell  I hope friends are well  At  Paris Madrid  and at  Rome  But now you elope  I suppose my friend Pope  The Conclave will hang out a broom  IV  Then his Holiness cry'd  All jesting aside  Give the Pope and the Dvl their dues  Take my word for't old lad  I'll make your heart glad  For faith I have brought you rare news  V  There's a fine plot in hand  To ruin the land  Call'd  Britain  that obstinate nation  Which so slily behav'd  In hopes to be sav'd  By the help of a dmn'd Reformation  VI  We shall never have done  If we burn one by one  Nor destroy the whole heretic race  From that  Hydra  for ever  A head you may sever  And a new will spring up in its place  VII  Believe me old  Nick  We'll now play a trick  A trick that shall serve for the nonce  This day before dinner  Or else I'm a sinner  We'll  smash  all the rascals at once  VIII  While the Parliament fits  And all try their wits  Consulting about musty papers  A gunpowder greeting  Shall break up their meeting  And shew who can cut the best capers  IX  This Stanza is new  How the rabble will stare  When they see in the air  Such a medley half burnt to a cinder  Look parch'd will each phiz  And whiskers will whiz  Lawn sleeves will make excellent tinder  X  When the King and his son  And the Parliament's gone  And the people are left in the lurch  Things shall take their old station  And you dmn the nation  And I'll be the head of the Church  XI  These words were scarce said  When in popt the head  Of an old

Songsters Nine  That in a summer's eve drink tea upon  The flow'renamell'd brow of  Helicon    There there's a line  Or with  Apollo  frisk a top of  Pindus    Who tell us tales so fine  Of those bucks of renown  That took  Troy  town  And at o'Clock at night broke honest peoples windows  I'm not afraid  To ask your aid  I know you'll fire me  And inspire me  At all times  With jingling rhymes  So sacred my eccentric lay shall be  To thee  Terrestrial goddess Drollery  CHORUS  IMITATIONS  From harmony from harmony  This universal frame began  Dryden  's  worst Ode  From Drollery from Drollery  All fun  Begun  II  Fidlers avaunt I never knew  So vile a crew  Bassviols and hautboys and Frenchhorns be mute  And harpsichord too  With all thou canst do  And eke thou softlybreathing flute  Know the terrestrial goddess Drollery  Kicks fumes and frets and snuffs at sounds of harmony  Hither sons of discord hither come come  The rough  hurdygurdy  thrum  Jarring keys and platters bring  The crack'd crowd with shrilling string  Broken trumpet's harshton'd strain  Catcall bard dramatic's bane  Clanging pan and hollow tub  Drumminor  beating dub a dub  Grunting cowlstaff mockbassoon  Fourscore voices out of tune  Screams and hoots outdoing quite  The owl earpiercing bird of night  Rattling saltbox bastards squalling  Fifty thousand brickbats falling  And ten cats a caterwauling  All sounds grating sharp and queer  See the goddess pricks her ear  Comical goddess deign to hear  For thy delight is tuneless noise  Clamour loud and midnight joys  Jocund sport and wakeful glee  And overlasting ha ha ha ha he  From Drollery c  III  Goddess I look before I look behind me  Where goddess shall a merry mortal find thee  O thou dost rule the roast  Hic et ubique  like old  Hamlet  's Ghost  From age to age  And thro' life's ev'ry stage  Thou dost possess the jovial of all nations  The jesters and the punsters of all stations  Rich poor wise weak fat bony short and tall  And art the quintessence of fun and oddity in all  Bards and wits pagan have some whimsies taught us  For this one sees  In  Aristophanes  And mirthful  Lucian  and old  Plautus  Oft hast thou sat astride a modern poet's brain  And then 'tis all fantastic  And then 'tis  Hudibrastic    Then  Chaucer  tells a story  Full worthy of  memory    And  Butler  so well known sir  Who had a Muse of his own sir  Mauls your shamsaints and godly  And makes them look most oddly  And lends them a sound thump sir  That they are sore in the  rump  sir  Then  Prior  sings his  Ladle    You know who 'twas that pray'd ill  And others with strange qualms  Burlesque the book of  Psalms    Fie  Sternhold Hopkins  fie  Upon your melody  Then  Pope  with fools half mad  In his  Dunciad  Batters the Bards that write from street call'd  Grub  And gives them such a rub  And then O let me fetch a rhyme for brain  Jack Falstaff  blows and puffs and lies in many a hum'rous vein  From Drollery c  IV  Sometimes thou twitchest by the nose  Of which the muscles are at thy dispose  The laughing votarists of prose  And then all language scant is  And were a man ever so able  It is almost impracticable  To recount  The full amount  Of the jeers  And the sneers  And the witticism  And the criticism  And the working  And the jerking  And the matter  Stuff'd with satire  Of waggish  Swift  and roguish  Stern  and the thricefam'd  Cervantes  From Drollery c  V  Among the dealers droll in prose and verse  May I my goddess name philosophers  They say "You can't endure us"  But 'tis a lie  I'll tell you why  There's not a queerer dog than Master  Epicurus  For he  And some few dozens  All catercousins  And all possest by thee  Superfine fellows  Frankly tells us  That this world was made by a company of atoms at a certain rout  Which met by no appointment and did not know what they were about  Hence the smooth flow of tuneful numbers hence  For here you have no pretence  My verses must now run rumbling  In spite of any body's grumbling  And sure there is not half the sport in walking that there is in tumbling  Does not  Alexander Pope  say  And now you shall have an  Alexandrine  Which I think tolerably fine  The sound upon all occasions should be an echo to the sense  Now Sir a parcel of these atoms or particles  He that argues which  Is a sceptical son of a b  'Tis rather a free expression  But all's one in a digression  In a frolick  Or having something like a fit of the cholick  Jumbled all together  I should think in bad weather  Some short and some long  Pellmell dingdong  Helter  To which you may add skelter  Some of them square and some round  Some rotten and a few of them sound  Some tender and some plaugy tough  Some smooth and some confoundedly rough  Some cold and a good many hot  Some dry and some moist and what not  Some I must make a word in jangles  And nine or ten dozen in right angles  Arid atoms all smashing  Wat'ry ones for a very good reason splashing  And all together in hurlyburly crashing  O that an honest man could have been there  It must have been a jovial day it was  chaos  fair  And so Sir here being no creation  For that these Gentlemen say would have been a work of pains and molestation  From this rude orig'nal dance  And from all these comical jars  In about a fortnight's time outjumped the sun and the moon  How they must shake their ears  When they first mounted their spheres  Attended with a pretty little train of I can't tell you how many stars  Now look back till you come to the worddance  Your most obedient servant madam chance  So not my aim to frustrate  For want of a simile this matter to illustrate  A simile which shall be halflike and half not  As that in composition is never reckon'd a blot  Our cook fat greasy  Nan  Takes a large bowl or perhaps an earthen pan  Full of ingredients various  And I will be bold to say precarious  And thrusts a long spoon of wood in  There's flour there's milk there's eggs there's sugar there's raisins there's currants there's nutmeg there's mace  And these she stirs and stirs about  With all her might and main  Again and again  And makes a wond'rous rout  And from this odd confusion  And manifold contusion  In a few hours space  Upon the table smokes a fine large round plumb pudding▪  From Drollery c  VI  Come put about the bottle  Let's drink a health to ev'ry man of mirth  In ev'ry corner of the earth  And then O Drollery  Another votary  Shall enter on our stage grave  Aristotle    A man of passing parts  And the first that took the degree of M A or in rhyme and plain  English Master of Arts    And at his heels  Frommenius    A dry outlandish genius  And these in half a minute  Why there is nothing in it  Shall cure the hyp and grubs and gripes and ptisic  With a good  quan suff  dose of  Metaphysic  O there is no specific like a  queer hum    Take a drachm of  formality  And an ounce of  quiddity  and  quality  And tincture of  personality  And some grains of  individuality  And elixir of  transcendentality    Do you know  Norris  I've heard  him say  This is a sov'reign med'cine for the quinsy  And next it follows  in naturâ rerum  That tho' the Dl's a liar yet  omne ens est verum  A RAPTURE  I catch the mental flame my wits are blown  By fancy's blast that sweeps thro' boundless space  To intellectual regions all unknown  Where concretes gross and matter vile ne'er held their cumbrous place  Where simple truths and axioms sure  Ideas chaste and abstracts pure  And forms unconscious of corporeal dress  Float in the vasty void of ample emptiness  Earth air fire water what are these  Hail mighty world of essences  Sublimities refin'd my pow'rs employ  And I disdain terrestrial joy  Now now exalted 'bove the starry sky  Where mortal poet never yet had handle  All ocean seems a puddle to my eye  And yonder twinkling sun a farthing candle  Higher yet higher would I soar  But ah I feel I can no more  I flag I faint I droop I doubt  IMITATIONS  I droop I doubt  See my courage is out  Macheath in the Beggar  's  Opera    See my rapture is out  HERE ENDETH THE RAPTURE  From Drollery c  VII  Descend my Muse descend I beg  And humbly take a lower peg  Come down I say come down my rhymes  To matters known and later times  For Drollery has got possession  In ev'ry calling and profession  Like  Proteus  still she varies shapes  She's archer than a thousand apes  Why you asserted this before  Now then we'll prove it and that's more  Pray leave your liquor  And step to church and hear the Vicar  I speak with rev'rence for the gown  He preaches of his kind the best in town  And boasts a  Sunday  's congregation  The  quietest  in all the nation  For then with  humdrum  sounds in drawling tone express'd  He lulls his calm parishioners to rest  You say the Doctor's dull  Sir I pronounce him droll  But my dear son of  Alma Mater  You shall have  aliter probatur    For mark a contrast now of Mirth's own handymaking  That bawling fellow on the stool  Will hold all mortals  waking    He's a fanatic  Who with extatic  Gesture and aukward motion  Current for good devotion  And whining and canting  And wailing and ranting  And bell'wings loud  And screw'dup face  Humbugs  the gaping crowd  And this is saving grace  You've seen Physicians holding consultation  In deep speculation  With canes at their noses  For that our suppose is  What grimaces  What wry faces  While cooly they're retiring  The patient lies expiring  In doleful plight  'Twould soften quite  The heart of any  Turk    But they have only done their work  Had you never a call  To  WestminsterHall  There's noble haranguing  And thorough tonguebanging  And laying down law  Without crack or flaw  Prating  Rating  Billingsgating  There's running of  rigs  And tossing of wigs  And quibblings and  querkings  And underhand workings  There's a number of cases  And solemn old faces  And a million of gimcracks and fancies  Demurrers pleas recogni  zances  And a set of reports  That have run through all courts  There's  Plaintiff  and  Defendant  By my troth there's no end on't  Lessor  and  Lessee  and poor  Spinster    O rare  Westminster    'Tis a troublesome day  But the Client's to pay  For  IMITATIONS  For thee wrangle and they jangle  And they never can agree  And the tenor of the song goes merrily  Chorus of an Old Ballad Auct Incert  they wrangle and they jangle  And yet they all agree  And the tenor of the law runs merrily  From Drollery c  VIII  Don't stare  But I'm going to swear  By all the gods and all the goddesses  In  Homer  's  Iliads  and his  Odysseys  And by  Momus  the droll of the skies  Supposing you're quaffing  I'll set you a laughing  Till the liquor flows out at your eyes  Only take a short jaunt  And I'll shew you my aunt  There she sits by the fire  In ancient attire  She's queer and she's quaint  Like a Methodist saint  At the sins of the age  She bursts in a rage  If you tell but two lies  She turns up her eyes  If you mention a male  Her cheek will turn pale  She hates the young jades  That haunt masquerades  The name of such creatures  Sets at work all her features  She turns her about  She wriggles her snout  She's faddle and fiddle  And a sort of a riddle  She knows all diseases  And cures whom she pleases  She's a gen'ral physician  And a staunch politician  She hopes reformation  And mends the whole nation  She loves party scuffles  She thumbplaits her ruffles  She wears taudry silks  Her toast is  Jack Wlks  She's this and she's that  And she keeps an old cat  A parrot and dog  Mog Mog Mog  come  Mog  poor  Mog    She's too old to have fits  But she's out of her wits  Upon my soul  My aunt's a droll  From Drollery c  IX  You need not long in  London  range  There's Drollery enough on  'Change  Where busy folk of all sorts meet  French Spanish Dutch Italians Prussians  Venetians Swedes  and  Danes  and  Russians    All nations trade and sometimes cheat  What a hurry and fuss  What a stir and what  buz  'Tis the whole world in coalition  Or  Babel  in a new edition  Hey for the regions of  consol  The jobber's clime and broker's  Throughout the alley you shall find  Dry fellows though dull jokers  In bond and transfer  par  and  cent  Sure there can be no sina  One rule will serve for monied men  And that is  laugh and wina  And now look in I'll pawn my word  'Twill pay you well for peeping  Upon that ghastly sallow tribe  Of  Jews  highsabbath keeping  Believe me Sir I scorn to treat  Pagans  or any men ill  But they resemble puppies much  Howling about a kennel  From Drollery c  X  Tell me ye lads of Mirth can Droll'ry shew  A gayer group or a more joyous scene  Than a Lord Mayor and Aldermen  And Livery men al  so  Sitting at dinner in a row  The very mention of the matter  May make my Reader's mouth to water  Happy thrice thrice happy guest  At a genial city feast  They tuck the napkin to their rosy jowls  And for the meal prepare with all their souls  The word is given they begin  They slash through thick and thin  "Through rills of fat and deluges of lean  "With knives as razors keen"  Flesh fish and fowl nice appetites regale  And viands rich ambrosial steams exhale  And weighty slivers from delicious haunches  Distend to their full size enormous paunches  O nameless transport of a feasting hour  Mutton men eat but turtle they devour  Now now for a whet boys then to it again  Bring waiter  Madeira  or lively  Champaigne  Behold them now again their knives applying  Stomachs vast with stomachs vying  Now with fat custards and high jellies  They cram the corners of their bellies  See see how Sir  Coddlehead  swallows that tart  Ye gods Is it eating or filling a cart  Give give them elbowroom they have a call  One and all  Let none the licens'd luxury gainsay  For guttling is the business of the day  Happy thrice thrice happy guest  At a genial city feast  From Drollery c  XI  Now thrum the  hurdygurdy  thrum again  A droller yet and yet a droller strain  Split  IMITATIONS  Now strike the golden lyre again  A louder yet and yet a louder strain  Break his bands of sleep asunder  And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder  Dryden  's  best Ode  our very sides asunder  With laughter loud as rattling peals of thunder  O lend me fifty tongues  And Mr  Stentor  's leather lungs  And I'll strive to recite  The joyous delight  And the noise and the crash and the glee  Of a jovial set  Together met  At the gay noon of night  Season of joke profuse and careless jollity  O what calling  And what bawling  And what singing  And what ringing  And what roaring  And what snoring  And what swagg'ring  And what stagg'ring  Here one mumbles  Here one tumbles  Here  Dick  rattl'ing  There  Sam  prattling  Some wildstaring  Some loudswearing  These rebuking  And those puking  Bottles filling  Glasses spilling  Veins strongburning  Heads roundturning  Wine highflavour'd  No one favour'd  Bowls richflowing  No one going  Shouts clamours tumults reign beyond resistance  The world is theirs  And sober cares  Are kick'd down stairs  And the dull fool that sleeps must keep his distance  But hark the Toastmaster to  order  calls  Silence your jokes or brawls  This fireey'd monarch of the social hour  Rules with licentious swing of arbitrary pow'r  The sons of riot  Themselves are quiet  Each strokes his beard  No sound is heard  Save that of  hiccups  check'd that die along the walls  Miss  Clio  never slow is  To celebrate such prowess  Hail thou

gentleman lies sprawling on the floor  And many a gallant gentleman  Lay gasping on the ground  Chevey Chace  From Drollery c  XII  The goddess ever shifts her mode  Now she appears in  Cibber  's Ode
