 The Dissenters in  England  vindicated from some Reflections in a late Pamphlet  Entituled  Lawful Prejudices  c  HAving applyed my self here particularly to the removing of National Prejudices I doubt not but it has been expected I should speak something to a late Tract Entituled  Lawful Prejudices c  And I acknowledge the Title seems to call me to that Work  I confess I have heard much of  Lawful Prejudices  against the Union but never saw the Attempt made till this  OutofSeasonPiece  to say no more of it shew'd it self in the World  I forbear Replying to it at large Not on Account of the Argument nor of the Performance In both which 'tis my Opinion the Author has acted so much below his Ordinary that to me it is One of the Unaccountablest Things  in that Part of Nature  how a Man so capable and that is so deservedly Admir'd in all other Cases could form such a Piece of Indigesture  I ask his Pardon if I am wrong  as this Piece seems to be  Whether it was a New Scene he was to Act which he was unacquainted with having ever till now Acted with Wisdom Charity and Justice and when driven  by Heaven knows what Influence  out of his Element like a Traveller out of his Knowledge he made all his Steps equally irregular or from what other Confusion of Thoughts it might proceed I will not determine  I decline all Advantages this gives me and very seriously profess I should entirely have declin'd entring the Lists at all with this Paper had not the Indecency on the whole Body of Dissenters in  England  obliged me to Justify and Defend them against what I confess I never expected to find them charg'd with especially by the Person whom common Fame reports to be the Author of this Paper  In my Undertaking this which I think is a Debt I am bound to pay to Truth and Innocence I shall endeavour not only to keep the Rules of Decency and good Manners but shall take Care not to break in upon that Respect which I always profess'd to the very Reverend Author both in his Person and Character and which I shall still retain notwithstanding this Unhappy Excursion  This will prevent me saying any thing which I am not forc't to in the necessary pursuit of Truth and the just Vindication of an Injur'd People But in that I hope he himself will pardon me the same Plainness which I desire to use with all the World and which an Honest Impartiality obliges me to  I shall say little to the Matter of the National Oath Solemn Covenant or Sinfulness of the Union here I had given my Opinion on that Head before without the least Prospect of this Gentlemans present Attempt and I see no Reason from any thing he has advanc'd to alter a Word in it  I think still the National Covenant's not at all concern'd here nor the Bishops in the Parliament at all establisht by the Union Uniting with  England as already Constituted  is neither Constituting nor Approving their Authority since a Protest against their Civil Authority clears you of the last and you have nothing of Concern in the first But this is not my present Business  Nor shall I enter upon the Argument he brings against the Church of  England  tho I own them maletreated and wrong'd also particularly in the Matters of the Sacramental Test  I am no more for Bishops Sacramental Tests or any sort of sinful Compliances than he that is remotest from them But every Blame should be plac'd where it justly falls  But I come to that which has extorted this Sheet from me and against my Inclination driven me to the Necessity of Debate with a Gentleman I sincerely value and whom I acknowledge my self to be no match for But tho my Respect for the Author is the utmost Restraint upon me yet I cannot but be astonished to see a Man of his Integrity and very Reverend Character fall so hard and I must say  so unhandsomly  upon a People whom once the Church of  Scotland  was not ashamed  to call Brethren  and who never have deserv'd this Treatment from  Scotland much less Now  and this is the Cause of my engaging in the present Dispute  And with all imaginable Respect to my Reverend Antagonist I must be allow'd to say here he has not done them Justice nay has grosly injur'd wrong'd and illtreated them Neither  which is worst of all  is the Fact he charges them with True  It has been but the last Lords day when in this City a Reverend  English  dissenting Minister preached in the Church of the  Grayfriers  where I was a Witness that the Ministry of the Kirk of  Scotland  esteem'd the  English  Presbyterians as Orthodox since they committed to him not only the Pulpit for preaching but the Administration of Ordinances admitting him to baptize in the same Pulpit he had preach'd in  Now 'tis very strange to me what can be meant by saying  We cannot trust the Presbyterian Dissenters  How Gentlemen can you trust them in Sacreds and not in Civils admit them to the Function and Right of the Sacred Office and not veoture them or join with them in defence of that Office  If they incline to Episcopacy will you come so near the brink of Apostacy to  Prelatick Principles  as to receive such into the Ministerial Brotherhood  Really if you can unite with them thus you may unite with them any how and any where and to say you cannot trust them is very hard  indeed 'tis very hard  In the next place can you not trust the  Presbyterian Dissenters  This is beyond all the rest since it singles out those Dissenters who it may be said  you can only trust  or those who are nearest in Judgment to the Kirk here And I must therefore take the liberty to say it is a Bill of Exclusion against the whole Body of Dissenters in  England  directly    st  Because they are the only Dissenters in  England  you really ought to depend upon the rest will join with you in Interest will assist and receive mutual Assistance and be your Friends but they will never own your Kirk nor submit to your Discipline    ly  Who of the Dissenters will you owne if not the Presbyterians the Independents you may approve in Doctrine but you cannot joyn with them in ChurchGovernment nor they with you the Anabaptists you disowne as Sectaries and the Quakers as Hereticks and  'tis the Complaint here  that the Union will open the Door to all those and let them in to the Kirk of  Scotland  who then can trust if not the PresbyteriansIt cannot therefore be any Breach of my Charity to say it is a publick disowning the whole Body of Dissenters in  England  as Persons that  cannot be trusted  In the next place I would beg this Gentleman and all the sincere Lovers of the Reform'd Churches in this Island to Reflect how Fatal to their General Interest how Destructive to the Preservation of them in either their separate or conjunct Concerns how directly tending to their intire Subversion and how plain an opening the Door to their Confusion must any Design of raising Jealousies and Misunderstandings between us be  What is it  Gentlemen  makes the High Church in  England  and the Prelatists here against the Union but the Apprehension of an entire Incorporation of Interests and Affection Hands and Hearts between the Kirk of  Scotland  and the Dissenters in  England  If that Union is not the Effect of the other both Parties are undone and 'tis the only way to render the Union Dangerous To commence a Distrust between us therefore is the only Effectual Step to Disappoint the Nations of the Benefit of the Union continue us all in Jealousies and Confusions and encourage the Enemies of our Peace to Crush and Insult us all  This must needs move any Considering Man and fill him with Concern that we should thus be doing that very Work our selves which all the Powers of Hell Jacobitism and Dividers can never do without us  It is not for me to enter upon the Character of the Dissenters in  England  or of their vigorous Defence of themselves both in their Religious Principles and Civil Libertys to the Honour of that great Body both as Christians and as  English  Men They need it not these things are too well known even to this Reverend Person himself and to all  Scotland  to need any Repetition  And how either Passion or want of Charity should so far prevail on this Person  at other times  so free from the first and so known for the last I am perfectly at a loss about  The first thing he charges on the Presbyterians in  England  is That their Divines of which he names only Mr  Baxter  Mr  How  and Dr  Bates  offered to submit to Episcopacy and on this Submission which was  but by a few  and those are all dead he ventures to say That  all or most  of them declare for a moderate Episcopacy And then adds upon the whole Body that they cannot be trusted To clear up this Slander  First  I must beg this Gentleman to Examine what this Episcopacy was and to what reduc't to which they offer'd to submit and whether he himself is not as much a Bishop as any  English  Prelate would then have been  Abating the Title of Lord  which is a Civil not an Ecclesiastical Dignity    Then  I desire him to Examine whether the Bishops themselves did not reject their Proposal for that Reason that it reduc't them all to Presbyters and parish Priests  Whether some of the greatest Divines in the Church of  England  have not Insulted the Dissenters on that head That their pretended Submission was a Plot against Episcopacy it self that they only acknowledged an abrupt and imperfect Superintendency and that too with intolerable Limitations    Next  Whether all those very Gentlemen who he says did submit did not at last reject Episcopacy refuse a Complyance particularly on account of Reordination and the Oath of Induction and lose their Livings on that Article  Whether had they Complyed in his Terms  it reflects on the whole Body  and how he can Qualifie himself to say that some people give the Presbyterians in  England  that Character without acknowledging it was an Injury to them since nothing can be more unjust than to Charge a Body of Men for the Errors of a few  Whether the Presbyterians in  England  are as far from sinfull Complyances or Leaning towards Episcopacy  Now  as the Presbyterians in  Scotland  of whom 'tis yet a Question whether an Equality are not Episcopally Inclin'd And whether it would not be as just to Charge the whole Kirk with it as to Charge the whole Body of Presbyterians in  England  because of the sinful Complyance of a few  This I cannot but regrate as a hard and Uncharitable Treatment of the Dissenters who have so Vigorously and with such Success Opposed the Encroachments of the Church and stood their Ground to the last  But this is not all  a worse Charge follows and in Terms which I am sorry to say are neither consistent with Charity or Justice and it grieves me to be forc'd in the just Defence of the Absent and Injured People called Dissenters to Charge any man much less this Gentleman with want of Truth His Charge is  "That  the Dissenters  did so far Countenance and Favour the Dispensing Power by the Tenor of their Addresses that instead of silently Receiving the Benefits of the Indulgence they set up for Advocats to support it and that to rescue themselves from the Severity of one Law they gave a  ow to all Laws  c pag    I hope our Author will not attempt to come off of the Charge by his putting it with a Somesay in the Front since he either believes it or would have it believ'd or else 'tis not to his purpose and if he does not believe it he ought to have quoted it as a Slander  Note here he does not say some of the Dissenters But THE DISSENTERS which I think is allowed to be a General and to signifie the Dissenters as a Body of people so call'd and distinguisht  If he means only  some of them  it will do him no Service for  some also  rejected the Proposal of Addressing with Contempt  If he will have  the Majority  Determine it those that refused it were  Twenty for one  and so 'tis against him and  no body  did it  If he means they did it as THE DISSENTERS or in Genral  'tis false in Fact  and he will not pretend to it yet this Gentleman tells us THE Dissenters did it and leaves the World to conclude it was the whole Body of Dissenters  This is very hard and very unkind and I am sorry I am forc't to Examine so far into it But to state the Fact fairly will end the whole Dispute  That many of the Dissenters were ignorantly drawn in to Thank the King for what was the Effect of an illegal Dispensing Power viz  Granting a Toleration  without considering that there lay hid  a Snake in the Grass  against their Laws and Civil Liberties is acknowledged  That the Artifices of the Court their Messengers  Booted Apostles  Engines and Contrivances wheedled some wellmeaning ignorant People into the Snare is also not to be hid which wicked Crew have been detected and some of them used as they deserv'd  viz  Contemned by all honest men and particularly by the very people they Deceiv'd  The Repentance of and Amends made by the People  so Deceiv'd  their firm Adherence to Liberty and their Principles  ever since  has been Eminent to the Overthrow of all those that formed that Horrid Delusion upon them and  No man should Reproach a Penitent  And  when all is done  these were but a few and so few as bear no Proportion  worth notice  to the Number of the Honest Dissenters that to the last Opposed those Illegal Proceedings and to say it was THE DISSENTERS a Term General and Embracing the the whole as a Body is most Unsufferably Injurious  As to the General  Viz  Addressing or thanking the King for his Indulgence Our Author is also mistaken in his Charging the Dissenters unless he make it appear that any of those Addresses Recogniz'd the King's Right of Dispensing with the Laws  The Liberty of Conscience they thank't him for 'tis true was their Native Right and their Right as Christians it had been withheld from them by an Unjust and Illegal Persecution Now tho a man Restores me my Right which another Invaded I may thank him for the Fact tho it was a Debt to Justice without joining in his reserved Design because I am obliged in Civility to him that Delivers me from Oppression tho it be his Duty to do it Else all Our Addresses to King  William  or Her present Majesty may be Censured also to say the King did it with an Evil Design is not to the purpose unless those that gave the Thanks knew that Design which Thousands at that time were not Convinc't of and as soon as they were Convinc't abhorred the Design and publickly Opposed it  So far then as any of the Dissenters in their Addresses Own'd the Invasion of the  English  Laws and the King's Dispensing Power so far they are to be Charg'd but if this Gentleman was to Examine how many he can Charge with that he would be far from laying it upon the whole Body for so Scandalous a Few  I might refer him home also and Enquire whether there was no Addressing here at the same time and whether some even of the Ministers in  Scotland I care not to Collect Names  did not Address on the same Head and thank the King for the very same thing And 'twould be very hard if I should from thence Charge the Kirk of  Scotland  with Countenancing the Dispensing Power of King  James  but the Justice would be the same if I should  Upon these Accounts I think the Dissenters in  England  illtreated and I am I confess not a little Surpriz'd that these things being of such recent Memory should slip the Thoughts of any Man for certainly if such Addresses were made here by Ministers themselves  it should have been the last thing any Minister here should have done to reproach the Dissenters in  England  with and I make no Doubt this Gentleman will when he reflects on this do so much Justice as to acknowledge his Error  I shall Enter into none of the Arguments brought together  However abruptly  against the Union The Thing is Over and the Debate useless and I hope the Effects will soon Convince the Nation of the Benefit My Design is not an Answer to the Book but a Vindication of the Dissenters in  England  from some of the worst Treatment I ever remember them to have met with from One of their own Brethren in my Time and I think with the least Provocation  I Humbly and Sincerely Recommend it to him to Reflect on the Unkindness and Injustice of it and to make such amends to the Good Name of his Brethren as his own Respect to Justice shall perswade him is their Due  FINIS
