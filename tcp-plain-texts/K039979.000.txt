fellow has taken me at my word and gone to hang or drown himselfhe threatened bothLovers are great bullies and swear a thousand things they never intend to perform if the poor woman shews any fear the bullies rave the more and she gives up at once that noblest privilege of the sex making the wisest fools and the stoutest miserableI have a tongue to be sure that moves quick and by outrunning my wit sometimes may encourage young coxcombs to hope too much but then my heart all the while poor thing knows nothing of the matter and feels no more than my shoeknots  SONG  My eyes may speak pleasure  Tongue flow without measure  Yet my heart in my bosom lies still  Thus the river is flowing  The millclapper going  But the miller's asleep in his mill  Though lovers surround me  With speeches confound me  Yet my heart in my bosom lies still  Thus the river is flowing  The millclapper going  But the miller's asleep in his mill  The little God eyes me  And thinks to surprise me  But my heart is awake in my breast  Thus boys slily creeping  Would catch a bird sleeping  But the linnet's awake in his nest  Where can this Tycho have hid himself I'm sure he went this waystay is not that my gentleman creeping along the side of the canal It is either he my other lover Faladal or the monkey in his new livery I must give him a little more hope or we shall have no more sport with him  Exit Rob  TYCHO  peeping out of a tree  There's a hardhearted shedevil for youdo I look like a monkey in a new livery I don't know how love may have alter'd me but I know a few weeks ago that I had the

boo to her for the life of me  Reenter  ROBINETTE  It was the monkey and a very pretty fellow he is now he is well dressed  Tycho sighs in the tree  La what's thatdid not I hear somebody sigh It must

your manners or Camilla and I shall look out for othersNo more melancholy Tycho if you love and would win me  TYCHO  Am I too melancholy for you  sighing  ROBINETTE  Too melancholly your face seems preparing for a funeral instead of looking out for a wedding I hate melancholy and all melancholy people A cloudy face betokens a cloudy heart and I will have neither Never will I sail to the port of matrimony but with a smiling sea and a clear skythat's the way to make a good voyage of it  TYCHO  And so it is faith he he heMy face will become smiles as well as a great deal of thinking I have

where's Faladel Robinette  ROBINETTE  Perhaps sleeping in some tree for love of me as you did  TYCHO  If he would do the other thing for you I should be very happy  sighing  ROBINETTE  Melancholy and jealous tooI declare offFye for shame a man a young man of person parts address and coversation to be jealous of an old simpering swaggering rhiming gentleman usher who is as dry as a mummy and talks of love has no strength and talks of fighting giants has no wit and thinks to gain me O Fye for shame  TYCHO  It is indeed both a sin and a shameI'll know myself better and be afraid of nobody but you Robinette I would say more but it is time for me to laugh he he he is it not  ROBINETTE  Now you shew yourself to advantageBut look at the lovers there they have had a fresh quarrel I suppose go and

 Steady never  Who the shifting clouds can bind  O the freaks of womankind c  Quick of car and sharp of eye  Others faults we hear and spy  But to our own  Alone  We are both deaf and blind  O the freaks of womankind c  Exit Rob  SCENE II  Camilla's magnificent Garden  Enter  FLORIDOR CAMILLA  and  TYCHO  CAMILLA  I cannot bear your jealousy  FLORIDOR  My jealousy would have merit with you if you lov'd as I didbut I have done madam and have nothing more to say  TYCHO  Then go to your father who has something to say to you  FLORIDOR  I'll follow you Tycho  walks about in disorder  TYCHO  What do you stay for if you have no more to say  FLORIDOR  I will but say three words and then I'll come  TYCHO  If you have three words the lady will have three thousand which at about two hundred and fifty words a minute will just take upI know my time and will be with you again  Exit Tycho  CAMILLA  Pray go to your father I have told you my mind Floridor why will you press me to change it Don't let an illopinion of your sex mislead  you  and injure  me  I am resolv'dYou have my heart I confess it'tis ungenerous to urge me farther when you know my greatest distress is to refuse you any thing  FLORIDOR  My suspicions Camilla are the strongest proofs of my passion  CAMILLA  Can you suspect me of such falsehood as to pretend a passion for you and secretly indulge one for another  FLORIDOR  Nigromant though a wicked is a powerful magician and his frequent visits might alarm a heart less sensible than mine  CAMILLA  My pride will not let me answer an accusation that reflects the greatest dishonour both upon you and myself  FLORIDOR  How can you suffer me to be tortur'd with jealousy when you might  CAMILLA  Stop Floridor when I mightwhat Scorn a father's commands given me with his last breath and blessing  FLORIDOR  With his last breath and blessing  CAMILLA  Upon his death bed he enjoin'd me with tears in his eyes not to give my hand but to him who could give me proofs of what this inchanted laurel would unfold  FLORIDOR  And what are theyI conjure you tell me  CAMILLA  See and behold  The laurel unfolds and discovers the words  Valor Constancy  and  Honour  in letters of gold  You have prov'd your  Love  to me by its unfolding at your requestNow read what is more expected from you  FLORIDOR  reading  Valor Constancy  and  Honour  Can the son of Bonoro and your lover be suspected  CAMILLA  I must not hear you Floridor Can you love me and refuse me these proofsMarriage my father added was too great a stake to venture upon common security If your passion is a true one you'll convince me by your obedience if it is a common one I am too proud to accept it and too grateful to disobey my father  SONG  Woman should be wisely kind  Nor give her passion scope  Just reveal her inclination  Never wed without probation  Nor in the lover's mind  Blight the sweet blossom hope  Youth and beauty kindle love  Sighs and vows will fan the fire  Sighs and vows may traitors prove  Sorrow then succeeds desire  Honour faith and wellearn'd fame  Feed the sacred lasting flame  FLORIDOR  You shall have the proofs from me you desire and in return I will exact but one from you  CAMILLA  If in my power you shall command it  FLORIDOR  Never see that curs'd magician Nigromant more  CAMILLA  Do  you  keep him from me then how can I avoid him he is crafty and powerful should I enrage him he would destroy our happiness for ever  FLORIDOR  You have  Spells  to protect us  CAMILLA  You have  Valour  to protect usit is you Floridor must deliver me from him  valor constancy  and  honour  may subdue all evil spirits and it is by them alone you can only reach the summit of your wishes  FLORIDOR  Then I will prepare for the trial  SONG  'Tis  Beauty  commands me my heart must obey  'Tis  Honour  that calls me and  Fame  leads the way  From nhe soft silken fetters of  Pleasure  I fly  With my  love  I must live or with  honour  will die  I wake from my trance  Bring the sword shield and lance  My name shall be famous in story  Now danger has charms  For love sounds to arms  And love is my passion and glory  going  CAMILLA  Stay Floridor I have something yet to do  Exit Camilla  FLORIDOR  amaz'd  What can this meanWhat now trial for a heart so devoted to the object of its passion that every trifling circumstance hurries the spirits to it as if alarmed by approaching danger  Reenter  CAMILLA  with a wreath of flowers  SONG  O take this wreath my hand has wove  The pledge and emblem of my love  These flow'rs will keep their brightest hue  Whilst you are constant kind and true  But should you false to love and me  Wish from my fondness to be free  Foreboding that my fate is nigh  Each grateful flow'r will droop and die  End of the first Part  PART II  SCENE I Bonoro's Cell with Prisons round it  CHORUS of EVIL SPIRITS from the Prisons  MIGHTY master hear our sighs  Let thy slaves be free  With folded hands and lifted eyes  We

FLORIDOR  CAMILLA  WHY would you distress me thus and doubly wound me by this rash action Your father will be incens'd at your disobedience and hate me as the cause of it Tycho may be work'd upon by the evil spirits and undo  my heart forebodes too  FLORIDOR  Can your heart be mine and conceive any doubts of me  CAMILLA  Why should I imagine that I have charms powerful enough to fix you mine for everchange of place may occasion change of sentiment new objects may erase former impressions  FLORIDOR  Indulge not these false alarms thou art queen of my heart and shalt reign there for ever and alone  CAMILLA  My fancy teems with a thousand apprehensions all my senses are in disorder I heard or thought I heart strange noises in the air even now my eyes are deceiv'd or this garden the trees the flowers the heav'ns change their colours to my sight and seem to say something mysterious which is not in my heart to expound  The objects in the garden vary their colours  FLORIDOR  These are the phantoms of love and fear  CAMILLA  O Floridor you have taught me love and love has taught me fear  DIALOGUE SONG  SHE  Look round the earth nor think it strange  To doubt of you when all things change  The branching tree the blooming flower  Their form and hue change every hour  While all around such change I see  Alas my heart must fear for thee  HE  Blighted and chill'd by cruel frost  Their vigour droops their beauty's lost  My cheek may fade by your disdain  To change my heart all pow'r is vain  Look round the earth the flow'r and tree  To nature's true as I to thee  SHE  These two verses are omitted in the representation  Look up to heav'nnor think it strange  To doubt of you when all things change  Sun moon and stars those forms so bright  Are changing ever to the sight  While in the heav'ns such change I see  Alas my heart must fear for thee  HE  Clouded or bright the moon and sun  Are constant to the course they run  So gay or sad my heart as true  Rises and sets to love and you  Look in the heav'ns each star you see  True to its orb as I to thee  Enter  BONORO  hastily  He stops short and looks stedfastly upon Floridor who starts confounded while Camilla appears distress'd  BONORO  after a pause  Well you may start and be confounded son  CAMILLA  kneeling  I am the cause of his disobediencelet me be punish'd  BONORO  Rise excellent woman    raises her    Your virtues are the best excuses for his disobedience which will become its own punishmenthis labours are trebled by it  FLORIDOR  My father  BONORO  Tycho has been overcome by the evil spiritsthey have broken their chains and fled to your rival and enemy Nigromantmischief is abroad  CAMILLA  Then I am wretched indeed  FLORIDOR  Doubt not of my valor or my loveIncrease of danger makes me more worthy of Camilla  BONORO  Your spirit charms me and disarms my angerI have disenchanted from sleep and forgiven the poor penitent 'Squire his was an error of judgment yours of passion but it is past and forgot Tycho waits for you with your sword and shield in the grove by the inchanted lake Begone remember the words of this divine oracle may  Valor Constancy  and  Honour  guide youlet no pleasures entice youno terrors daunt youwhen once you see him never lose sight of your foe follow him where ever he leads you the greatest dangers are only the rugged paths which will lead you to renown in the arms of innocence and beauty  pointing to Camilla  TRIO  BONORO  May heav'n's blessing blend with mine  To crown thy deeds at virtue's shrine  Be love's best gift Camilla thine  CAMILLA  May ev'ry sigh that's heav'd by me  And ev'ry wish that's breath'd for thee  Be prosp'rous gales on fortune's sea  FLORIDOR  O when my bark the tempest o'er  With pilot love shall gain this shore  Ambition cannot ask for more  TRIO  Of ev'ry blessing love's the source  Valour but an empty name  A roving wild destructive flame  Till love and justice guide its course  And then it mounts to fame  Exeunt  Enter  ROBINETTE  ROBINETTE  So so all matters are made up again and the confusion which my poor simple melancholy lover Tycho occasion'd is all kindly settled by the benevolence of BonoroI could not help list'ning to his fine sayings  not out of curiosity but it really does one's heart good to hear a fine preacher of morality and which is wonderful see him practise it too But the lovers I see    looking out    are taking their last leavethe good man can scarce part themtheir lips are glew'd togetherthey'll never be got asunderit makes both my eyes and my mouth water I'll look at 'em no more  SONG  Thro' all our hearts philosophers have taught  A subtle vapour flies  Warm'd in the veins it kindles quick as thought  And sparkles in the eyes  Be warn'd ye fair and retire  Fly far from the

Triumphant reigns by heav'n's decree  And leads in chains grim  Jealousy  At the end of the song a Messenger enters  MESSENGER  For the conqueror Floridor  delivers a letter  FLORIDOR  reads  By my assistance you recover'd your sword and shield by which you have conquer'd Nigromant and are possess'd of his treasuresYou are now worthy of  my  love and therefore I demand  your's  What ever you ask  How dreadful the task  To perform it 'fore heav'n I vow  GRINNELDA  What a spiteful old hag  Flor stands confounded  CAMILLA  Whence comes that letter Floridor which distresses and confounds you soI

thunder rattle  Flash lightning round my head  Place me in the front of battle  By rage and horror led  Tho' death in all her ghostly forms appear  My heart that knows no crime can konw no fear  The flames and the ruins of the casile vanish away and discover a fine moonlight seene  FLORIDOR  What can all this mean by what offence unknown to me have I brought this complicated distress upon me  Enter  TYCHO  frighten'd  TYCHO  What a dreadful combustion is thisWhere my Knight is I can't tell and where I am and how I got here the fiends alone who brought me here can tell  FLORIDOR  Hark did

muttering thereart thou a good or evil spirit  TYCHO  I am neither at presentand how you Signior Floridor can speak with so clear a tone of voice in such place as this and in your condition puzzles my philosophy  FLORIDOR  My conscience upbraids me with nothing and why should I fear  TYCHO  My conscience is not quite asleepbut I hope my playing at hideandseek with the seraglio girls a little cannot
