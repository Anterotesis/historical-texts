 SEDUCTION A COMEDY  AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSONâ–ª PATERNOSTERROW  M DCC LXXXVII  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr BARRYMORE  AMONG the tawny sons of Indian lands  The Hero who aspires to lead their bands  Must proof afford ere he his cause can gain  Of resolution and contempt of pain  Ere they'll confess him fit for them to die  Whips stings and fire his fortitude must try  Assembled Chiefs the desp'rate contest view  Inflict the torture and the pang renew  And should he while the flames his reins embrace  Heave one poor sigh or even breathe apace  With scorn and ignominy he's expell'd  By boys and women in derision held  But if to pain superior he comes forth  Equal to heroes of acknowledg'd worth  Applauding shouts reecho to the skies  And all hearts claim him as his country's prize  Severe the taskWho would to fame aspire  In lands like these where Virtue's try'd by fire  Scarce less severe his task who pants for fame  Scorch'd by the ardour of Poetic flame  While fable diction pathos wit and taste  Like scorpion whips and racks are round him plac'd  For while to conquer each defect he tries  "On the strong torture of the mind he lies"  Rashly resolv'd to dare impending fate  Tonight comes forth a hardy candidate  The Critic lash the more than mortal stings  When Obloquy the Poet's bosom wrings  When Disappointment gnaws his bleeding heart  And mad Resentment hurls her venom'd dart  When angry Noise Disgust and Uproar rude  Damnation urge and ev'ry hope exclude  These dreadful tho' they are can't quite repel  Th' aspiring mind that bids the man excel  Tho' rules alone would yield a barren fame  Such praise as rules can merit he may claim  Each unity's preserv'd nor knows the play  A lapse of time beyond the close of day  No change of scene denotes a chang'd abode  Nor has he dar'd indulge one episode  But rules of art no native tints bestow  Art never taught the beauteous rose to blow  If nurtur'd not by dews and heav'nborn fire  The halfblown bud must droop the plant expire  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Sir Frederic Fashion  Mr PALMER  Lord Morden  Mr KEMBLE  General Burland  Mr AICKIN

hours The scene is the house of Lord Morden and does not change and the stage is never vacant but at the end of an act The action is single  PREFACE  THE immortal Author of Hudibras affirms the hardest task in the world is to write a play it is therefore no wonder that writers of plays are prone to regard their labours with fondness even to partiality or that they should perceive with regret the light esteem in which a part of the literary world have lately affected to hold them Works of rudiment of disquisition nay even of mere compilation are often treated by criticism with a respect which a comedy or tragedy where wit invention genius and all the highest faculties of the mind have or ought to have been employed seldom meets The theatre however it may be debased by the nightly intrusion of unhappy and improper persons has a most powerful and good influence on morals which increases with industry and as the means of gaining admission among the lower class increase Much time is there spent to the best the noblest of purposes the body's fatigues are forgotten the mind is beguiled of its cares the sad heart is made merry fictitious sorrow obliterates real and the soul imbibing virtuous and heroic principles is roused and impelled to actions that honour not only individuals but nations and give a dignity to human nature Those who can doubt this are to be pitied And it is piteous most piteous that not only the learned but the political world should treat the stage with neglect nay with contempt  that they do not combine and employ the high powers they possess to the encouragement and perfection of an art which being in its own nature so delightful so fascinating is capable of contributing so infinitely to the happiness as well as to the pleasure of mankind  These ideas have long and often occurred to my mind where they have acted with increasing force If I have written a comedy which perfectly moral in its tendency and counteracting a fashionable vice that is in danger of becoming a vulgar one has charms sufficient to attract spectators I am of opinion I have done my country an essential service That some who read this may call me vain or presumptuous is to me totally indifferent The theatre is a subject of such consequence to virtue happiness and man that I cannot forbear speaking of it with a sense of feeling which I fear I cannot impart  I must now undertake a task of a very different and painful nature the cause of my undertaking it shall be given when I have told my story  In the summer of I wrote the Opera of the Choleric Fathers and the Comedy of Seduction They were both put into the hands of Mr Harris on certain conditions the substance of which was that if after reading he should approve the pieces they were both to be played during the ensuing season the first in November and the latter in January  or the beginning of February They were read by Mr Harris and both accepted on these conditions and so precise so perfectly explained were they that they were reduced to writing However certain objections arising on the part of Mr Harris concerning benefit nights not the time of performing the pieces for that remained determined I myself tore the written agreement saying I thought it improbable men who meant honestly and honourably should differ in trifles and that each other's word was sufficient  When Mr Harris had read Seduction though he objected to parts he was yet so well pleased with the whole that he said with evident and peculiar satisfaction I had given the theatre a comedy which he thought would do it no harm  Having made his objections alterations were agreed on and the comedy taken back Further to prove how fully the word of Mr Harris was engaged how perfectly he understood himself pledged to abide by his agreement while the Opera of the Choleric Fathers was preparing for representation Mr Harris sent to me to make a new proposal which according to him would highly benefit the theatre This was that instead of January I should suffer the comedy to be brought out before Christmas because he had a new pantomime Omai that would in all probability be greatly beneficial to the theatre after Christmas and that his season would then  be filled up and probably exceedingly productive That my interest might not suffer by this arrangement he promised in compensation to suffer the new pantomime to be played for my third benefit and if the comedy ran a certain number of nights for my fourth When he made this proposition I desired time to consider and consult my friends and at last from a sincere wish to oblige Mr Harris and serve the theatre acquiesced This project however was deranged not by me or Mr Harris but by an event highly vexatious to both and which I shall not relate now perhaps never  In the mean time the play had received some alterations and the insertion of a character so atrocious yet so frequent in this town as to make in the opinion of Mr Harris the representation of it dangerous Accordingly this was to be expunged still further alterations were undertaken and the comedy a third time delivered as it is at present played about the beginning of December It will be necessary to remark that before this the Choleric Fathers had been performed and did not take that run which Mr Harris expected and I had hoped and that knowing the changeable disposition of Mr Harris I cautioned him against suffering this mediocrity of success to influence and prejudice his mind against the comedy He assured me it should not  I must likewise state that so selfdenying  was I and desirous of promoting the welfare of the theatre when Mr Harris informed me by Mr Lewis he had no further hopes from the Opera which had then been played seven nights and that he would allow me the eighth instead of the ninth night but adding he doubted whether I should clear expences I though there was no probability of loss and certainly some of gain gave up my third night to the theatre telling Mr Lewis I would not deprive Mr Harris of a night under such circumstances  The Comedy remained with Mr Harris who I was told was gone out of town till the beginning of January without my receiving any information of its being preparing for rehearsal I began to be alarmed and unable to obtain an interview or even discover where Mr Harris was I wrote a letter to him expressive of these alarms I need not describe what my feelings were a few days after on receiving the comedy back with a letter from Mr Harris in which these feelings were indeed little respected informing me it could not succeed The manner of sending it back was almost as extraordinary as the act It was brought loosely tied up with packthread in a bit of dirty brown paper unsealed by the servant of Mr O'Keefe I mean not to insinuate any possible disadvantage to the character of Mr O'Keefe far to the contrary I have often heard him honourably mentioned Neither can I say how  it came into his hands or that he knew what it was but this is no palliation of Mr Harris's conduct I returned no answer it would have been exceedingly wrong to have trusted the irritated mind at such a moment  I will now give my reasons for relating this transaction to the world To pretend I did not feel all the indignation which conduct like this must kindle would be to assume an apathy contrary to nature and even to virtue This however has worn off I act coolly at present and from a sense of duty not revenge As far as relates to myself I would wish the affair might never more be remembered but if men in similar situations might act thus  always  with impunity as they  too often  do what means could the weak and unprotected find of obtaining redress what security in their dealings with a man who regardless of probity and yielding to the caprice of opinion the dictates of pride or the narrow motives of selfinterest does not scruple to break his word so pledged and engagements thus formal  This narrative will scarcely be more disagreeable to Mr Harris to read than it has been to me to write it is not my own cause I plead for that was gained in the success of my Comedy but the cause of the weak against the strong the cause of hereafter genius against hereafter injustice the cause of the man who endowed with gifts of which Nature herself is proud but deprived of every  benefit of Fortune shall devote his days and nights to study and suffer every abstinence with resignation and even with delight cheered by the sweet hope of being some time known for what he is There is a momentary intoxication a delirium of soul in this hope which not the daily privation of pleasures the disappointments of years the labours of a life nor injustice itself can counterbalance It is this godlike sensation which has given the mind an impetus and made it produce works so various and so vast that glancing at their amplitude and sublimity it stands confounded at its own powers  That I may avoid all appearance of mingling flattery with an appeal to justice I shall forbear describing the conduct of the Proprietors of DruryLane except saying they have behaved to me like Gentlemen and men of honour  My heart will not however suffer me to be equally reserved and silent concerning Mr King The moment he was convinced the producing of this Comedy would probably serve not injure the Theatre his zeal and activity in my cause were indefatigable how very essentially his powers as an actor have contributed to its success is too public for me had I a wish so selfish to conceal But this is not the first debt of gratitude from me to Mr King his friendship or his philanthropy while I was struggling into notice and combating with adverse fortune did me a generous  kindness which never can nor ever ought to be forgotten  The Town have beheld with delight and surprise the increasing excellence of Miss Farren and thinking she had attained perfection have been astonished when they saw her next at their own mistake In the present instance her exertions and even the very manner of them have been as pleasing to me as they were beneficial to the Comedy I can only add she has excelled herself and though that thought be old it never was more properly applied  Having mentioned these it were injustice to the rest of the performers not to thank them both for the display of talents the merits of which are well known and the ardour I may say the anxiety they testified for my success Yes I most sincerely thank them all and only forbear to name them individually because I cannot find expressions various and warm enough to convey my thoughts without making true and well deserved praise assume the form of laboured panegyric  Upper Marylebone Street  March  SEDUCTION A COMEDY  ACT I  SCENE I  A superb Drawingroom in the House of Lord  MORDEN  with several Doorsleading to other Apartments  LAPELLE  from Lord Morden's dressingroom looking at his watch  TWENTY minutes past tena

from Lady Morden's dressingroom  Mrs  Pinup  I declare upon my honour this is a most monstrous time of night for a lady's  gentlewoman to be kept up dozing over a dull novel or nodding in an antichamber and an arm chair while others are taking their pleasure and losing their estates among their friends  Lapelle  Good morrow Mrs Pinup  Mrs  Pinup  Good morrow Mr Lapelle Good night you

nights and greatly trouble the repose of valets and lady's maidsand late hours like white paint are excellent promoters of crack'd complexions  Mrs  Pinup  I declare upon my honour I am as tired asas

young handsome and full of spirits was not a month ago reserved in her conduct fond of her husband contented with home and indeed a miraculous kind of exception among wives of quality Whereas now she has suddenly turned fantastical in dress capricious in temper free of speech and what we halfbred folks should call light of carriage She games with the women coquettes with the men and seems in every respect ambitious to becomea woman of fashion As for my Lordwhyhe is a man of fashion  SCENE IV  GENERAL BURLAND LAPELLE  Gen  Burland  Is your Lady up Mr Lapelle  Lapelle  Yes SirI believe she has

LORD MORDEN LAPELLE  with coffee  Lord  Morden  This is not half strong enoughget me some as strong as possibleAny message  rises  Lapelle  This letter my Lord  SCENE XI  LORD MORDEN  From Lady Westbrook I see  reads    UmA young lady in disguiseumWill relate her own storyumumRely on your honour to keep her secret and serve her cause  Would have addressed myself to Lady Morden but for

gentleman  Lapelle  Said he would call about one my Lord  Lord  Morden  Shew him into my room and inform me the instant he comes  Lapelle  General Burland is here  Lord  Morden  aside  General Burland Zounds  Lapelle  Came to town late last night my Lord  Lord  Morden  Tell him I am come down  SCENE XIII  LORD MORDEN  Must not let him see the present temper of my mindMy guardian once he is determined never to think me of ageI need not his reproof to increase my present chagrin my own follies and Lady Morden's unexpected unaccountable reverse of conduct are sufficientHe will lay it all to me and perhaps with reasonHeighoHere he comesReally one of these very prudent plainspoken friends is a very disagreeable person in these our moments of follyWell I must assume a cheerfulness I don't feel and ward off his wisdom with raillery  SCENE XIV  LORD MORDEN GENERAL BURLAND  Gen  Burland  Good morrow my Lord  Lord  Morden  General good morrow  Gen  Burland  You seem scarcely awake  Lord  Morden  stretching  Slept illtroubled with the nightmare  Gen  Burland  Your troubles I am afraid are rapidly increasing  Lord  Morden  How so General  Gen  Burland  Lady Morden had a rout last night  Lord  Morden  Oh and forgot to send you a card I supposeIs that my fault  Gen  Burland  You are merry my Lord but he who drinks poison out of a frolic will soon be glad to send for a physician out of fear and the chances are the doctor will come too late  Lord  Morden  Trope and figure  Gen  Burland  My Lord my Lord this levity is unseasonable blushes and shame would better become you  Lord  Morden  Pff They are out of fashion  Gen  Burland  Yes you leave your friends to blush for your faults  Lord  Morden  My friends are very good nay indeed generous for were they but to spare a single blush for each of their own faults they would have none to bestow on mine  Gen  Burland  Fie The mirth of a madman is sport only to boysI was your guardian I wished to prove myself your friend 'Twas I first discovered that then angelic woman who is now Lady Morden I was the cause of her  union with you and I am therefore accountable to myself to her and to society for her conduct  Lord  Morden  That is you are a kind of secondhand sponsorGodfatherinlaw as it were  Gen  Burland  Very well Sir proceed despise reproof ridicule advice  Lord  Morden  Nay good doctor you really wrong me 'tis not the advice but the physic I hateAt least I hate the form under which it is administeredBut pray tell me when last you saw Lady Morden did you perceive any symptoms of that degeneracy in her Ladyship you now complain so loudly of  Gen  Burland  None I thought it impossible  Lord  Morden  And is it not rather extraordinary then that my example should so suddenly subdue what within this month seemed so invulnerable  Gen  Burland  Great surprise and energy  It is extraordinary my Lord most extraordinary but not less true and had you any sense of your duty to yourself your family or society the truth of it would make you tremble  Lord  Morden  See how differently different people understand things My acquaintance are every day wishing me joy of her Ladyship's reformation and telling me how surprisingly she has retrieved her character in the world  Gen  Burland  sarcastically  And Sir Frederic Fashion no doubt among the rest  Lord  Morden  endeavouring to conceal his feelings  Hemyesyes He is one of our very first men you know and he is quite in  raptures with herswears she was born to lead and outshine us all  Gen  Burland  with continued irony  The approbation of so great an adept must give you vast pleasure  Lord  Morden  HemainfiniteNot but this sudden change has rather surprised me  Gen  Burland  How so  Lord  Morden  Just as you left town her Ladyship's melancholy seemed increasingwandering over the house like a perturbed spirit as the play says mournfully clanking her chains and frightening the gentle smiles and pleasures from her she seemed to waylay me and with moving look and melting eye intreat compassion till egad I really at last began to pity her  Gen  Burland  You did  Lord  Morden  YesBut suddenly forsaking the  penseroso  she broke in upon me one morning and with an air of levity and good humour and a small tincture of reproach then and there read me a very pretty wifelike remonstrance  Gen  Burland  To which you listened with a truly picktooth insensibility  Lord  Morden  YesYou know my way  Gen  Burland  And what was the subject of her discourse  Lord  Morden  Why chapter the first was a recapitulation of my agreeable follies and her own perverse virtuesShe was no partaker in my pleasuresI had forgot every endearmentShe was left to dine sup and sleep by herselfI dined supped and slept nobody knew whereShe more recluse than the abbess of a convent  I more uncertain than the price of stocks or the place of prime minister  Gen  Burland  with earnest concern  And what did you say to this  Lord  Morden  aside  I must face it out  aloud  Say What could I say to such a simple woman  Gen  Burland  You did not attempt to deny the charge then  Lord  Morden  What should I deny 'Twas every syllable true and every syllable in my praise  Gen  Burland  sighs  HumphThen you do not think the sweets of affection ought sometimes to alleviate the bitterness of neglect  Lord  Morden  Sweets pshaw they are too cloying to the stomach and ought to be taken sparinglyI am fond of sweet music but too much of it sets me to sleepBesides a wife like a barrel organ can only play one set of tunes  Gen  Burland  sighs  Well Sir but the conclusion  Lord  Morden  A very unexpected one I assure youI misunderstood this for a declaration of war and with a smile was very obligingly about to intreat her Ladyship would hatch her melancholy into mischief her own way when turning short upon me she curtsied seemed abashed began to apologize applaud my conduct ridicule the silliness of her own and promised to become as fashionable a Lady as I or any Lord in Christendom could wish  Gen  Burland  Your increase of happiness is then prodigious  Lord  Morden  HemaunspeakableLady Morden I own was certainly a kind of  DemiAngel tho' my wifebut then herher goodness seemed to throw one at such a distanceso much in the back ground that there was only one figure noticed in the picture  Gen  Burland  'Tis well Sir you are so perfectly satisfied  Lord  Morden  Nay General I will own I have often felt a kind of inclination a sort of wish as it were to become very prudent and wise andand all thatbut really one has so much to do that one does not know where to beginBesides you very good kind of people youupon my honour you are in many respects the most queer precise particular species of beings and have such strange notionsInstead of taking one's pleasure and doing just what one likes best which you know is so natural one must live for the good of one's country love one's wife and children pay tradesmen look over accounts reward merit and a thousand other of thethe most ridiculous whimsand what nobody absolutely nobody does  Gen  Burland  Intolerable profligacyI have listened to you my Lord with grief vexation astonishment and pityYour mind is degraded and the more dangerously so because you believe your worst vices to be your greatest merits You have had honour happiness and pleasure of the most perfect kind within your power and you have rejected them to clasp their shadows To merit pity by misconduct is humiliating but by misconduct to incur contempt is to a manly spirit insupportable and the latter will I fear be suddenly your Lordship's fate Did not the remembrance of your noble father affect me I should look upon your approaching punishment  with apathy because you wilfully have plunged to perdition but for your Lady if I cannot retrieve if I cannot save her I shall mourn indeed  SCENE XV  Lord  Morden  Faith this good general is like a cuckoo always in a tune  sighs  He has reasonI have laboured to laugh at my own follies but the farce is over the forced jest forgotten and the sorceress Recollection conjures up the ugly phantom DisgustWhy what a child am IOh Lady MordenpshawabsurdI will not make myself the butt and byword of my acquaintanceIII will laughha ha halaugh at my Lady's gallantriesI jealousIthat have daily made jealousy a standing jest the criterion of an illbred vulgar mindNo no no  Sees Lady Morden and Sir Frederic Fashion coming and is seized with a suspicious anxiety which he endeavours to conceal  SCENE XVI  LORD MORDEN LADY MORDEN  in an undress  SIR FREDERIC FASHION  Lady  Morden  entering  No no Sir Frederic you are partial  Sir  Frederic  Not in the least Madam  Lady  Morden  Yes you aregood morrow to your Lordshipyes you areI feel I still retain a leaven of former silly prejudices but a little collision among you people of superior fashion will soon wear these asperities smooth and bring them to bear a proper polish  Sir  Frederic  Ah Madam you have a leaven of something celestial which we  inferior  people wonder at but cannot imitate  Lord  Morden  aside  So  Lady  Morden  taps Sir Frederic with her fan  Fie flattererbut you are always saying civil things

countenance an open and avowed consciousness that one possesses every grace and perfection is the grand secret of really possessing them or at least of persuading the world one really does which is the same thing  Sir  Frederic  Your Ladyship is very right nothing can put a face of real fashion out of countenance the placid features are all fixed  Lady  Morden  Oh immoveableLike the owner's names cut in brass and nailed to their doors  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha ha Charming  Lady  Morden  Do but observe one of our wellbred beaus at a public assembly and you will see him enter plant himself in

Formerly I should have blushed if stared at but now I find the only way is to stare againwithout lookingthat is without betraying the least indication of knowing whether one is looking towards the man or the wallthus  Lord  Morden  with forced pleasantry  Ha ha ha your Ladyship is very right modestymodesty is an obsolete bugbear  Lady  Morden  Yes and like thethe ghost in the tragedy has been

antichamber as if he had been listening  SO Mr Irishman by accident A lady in disguise That's the riddle is itBut hush  SCENE II  LORD MORDEN  dressed  HARRIET  from the antichamber  Lord  Morden  to Lapelle  Leave the roomI am sorry we were disturbed your story Madam has interested me deeply though too reprehensible for the irregularities of my own conduct I cannot but condemn the licentious libertinism of this Sir FredericIndeed II have reason perhaps to dread it  Harriet  A man of honour among men the ruin of woman he thinks as necessary to his fame as to his pleasure and like too many others of your cruel sex holds it no crime to make war upon those who cannot defend themselves  Lord  Morden  But what do you propose by this disguise Madam  Harriet  There is a contract which I indeed refused but which he forced upon me to demonstrate as he said the purity of his intentions  wherein he bound himself in a penalty of ten thousand pounds to marry me within a month for in his fictitious raptures he protested no sum no proofs could sufficiently express the ardour and sanctity of his affection  Lord  Morden  And have you this contract  Harriet  Oh no The day preceding that on which it was my good fortune to discover his real designs he asked to see and artfully exchanged it for a counterfeit copy  Lord  Morden  This contract you wish to regain  Harriet  If possible or some other unequivocal means of detection  Lord  Morden  And force him to marry you  Harriet  Oh noTo own the truth I have a generous and a constant lover who perhaps has been a little ill used  Lord  Morden  As most generous and constant lovers are  Harriet  'Tis too trueTo avenge him and humble the pride of one who thinks himself too cunning for our whole sex is my determination  Lord  Morden  Well Madam ours is a common causeBut as we have both been imprudent and invited misfortune we must both endeavour to conceal our true feelings mask our suspicions andHush Here he comes and with him a lady whose principles are as free as his own but who has had the art so well to conceal her intrigues and preserve appearances that she is every where received in societyI will introduce you in your assumed character  Harriet  Not now let us withdrawwhen he is alone The fewer eyes are on me the less liable I shall be to a discovery  Lord Morden and Harriet return to the antichamber just as Mrs Modely and Sir Frederic appear  SCENE III  MRS MODELY  and  SIR FREDERIC  Mrs  Modely  Really Sir Frederic there is no accounting for the strangeness of your present tasteI pity youI foresee the downfall of your reputationWhat you who have vanquished so many elegant coquettes and driven so many happy lovers mad you who were the very soul of our first societies and whose presence made palpitate the hearts of belles and beaux the first with hope and delight the latter with fear and envy you sighing at the feet of a prude and become the rival of a husband  Sir  Frederic  laughing  Deplorable  Mrs  Modely  Have not you for this month past buried yourself in Lady Morden's sober society and dozed over crown whist with her night after nightNay have not you attended her even to church and there with a twang joined the amen chorus of charitychildren paupers and parishclerks sitting with your face drawn as long as its shadow at sunset and a look as demure and dismal  Sir  Frederic  As poor Doctor Faustus waiting for the Devil to come and fetch himHa ha haGranted  Mrs  Modely  And what do you think has been said of you mean while in the polite circles you have abandonedYour very best friends have been the very first to condemn you  Sir  Frederic  That's naturalWhen we are guilty of any folly our very best friends are always  the very first to condemn us to shew they neither advise nor countenance us  Mrs  Modely  I thought the gay young beauty besieged by pleasures surrounded by flatteries who believes herself the goddess she is painted to fix her wandering fancy to humble and bring her to a sense of frailty or to supplant the happy the adored lover while yet the breath is warm that vows eternal constancy these I imagined were the only atchievements worthy Sir Frederic Fashion  Sir  Frederic  These have their eclat But to initiate a youthful beauteous wife who from her childhood has been accustomed to say her prayers believe in virtue and rank conjugal infidelity among the most heinous of the seven deadly sins to teach her to doubt fear wish tremble and venture to be a witness afterward of her repentance her tears involuntarily falling her eyes motionless her form fixed and the severe saint transformed to a statue of weeping sin to read her fall in the public papers be praised reproached admired and curst in every family in England in short to be for ever immortalized in the annals of gallantry and the hero of the teatable for a whole month for this will be no common vulgar wonder this were glory equal to my ambition And this glory I am determined to acquire nay it is already within my graspThis day or rather this night this very blessed ecstatic night shall I gain the greatest of all my victories  Mrs  Modely  Insulting  Sir  Frederic  Nay my dear Mrs Modely you know my enthusiasin and must not take exceptionsNor can I surely be blamed Lady  Morden is a concealed hoard of native sweets that delights the senses while the madeup beauties we commonly meet like artificial flowers are all shew and no fragrance  Mrs  Modely  Raptures  Sir  Frederic  Inferior to her in form and perfection as the Venus of a Dutch imagehawker to the genuine Grecian Antique  Mrs  Modely  It matters not wasting your rhetoric on this topic for I will not give my consent to your pursuing this affair any further Sir Frederic  Sir  Frederic  You will not  Mrs  Modely  I will not  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha ha Don't provoke me my dear Mrs Modely don't provoke me  Mrs  Modely  Nay no threatening  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha haWellTo arms thenWar is the word  Mrs  Modely  The choice remains with you  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha ha  Mrs  Modely  Lady Morden is my relation and though I despise prudery and know the world  Sir  Frederic  aside  That you do indeed  Mrs  Modely  Yetyou can hardly suppose I will silently acquiesce in her ruin  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha ha Youyou forget yourself dear MadamThese qualms would do vastly well in some places but to me  Mrs  Modely  And why not to you SirThough I do allow myself a little liberty of conscience  Sir  Frederic  Not a little  aside  Mrs  Modely  And though youyouknow I do must IIn short I have another favourite  project which I am determined not to give up  Sir  Frederic  aside  Oh ho But it will be best to avoid a rupture  aloud  May I ask what this favourite project may be  Mrs  Modely  You know the public affront General Burland gave me last winter and you cannot suppose I have forgotten it  Sir  Frederic  aside  No I know you better  aloud  Oh the General is an eccentric mortal licensed to say any thing and instead of being listened to is laughed at  Mrs  Modely  Yes but I am determined he shall be punished  Sir  Frederic  Which way  Mrs  Modely  His daughter Emily is a pretty simple girlI mean untutored in the world  Sir  Frederic  conceiving her design  True  Mrs  Modely  To see her married to a man of fashion would at least break his heart  Sir  Frederic  laughs  Infallibly  Mrs  Modely  Your fortune I believe Sir Frederic like your family seat begins to want repairs and she is a rich heiress with twenty thousand pounds at her own disposal beside the General's estate which must be hersWhy do you laugh so  Sir  Frederic  Oh the delights of anticipation  Mrs  Modely  Anananticipation  Sir  Frederic  still laughing  It is a part of my plan to carry her off I mean to let her carry me off this very night  Mrs  Modely  Who Emily  Sir  Frederic  Emily  Mrs  Modely  To night  Sir  Frederic  This active this important this blissful night  Mrs  Modely  Lend me your eau de luce you divle  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha haThis surprise from you Mrs Modely is the supreme of panegyric  Mrs  Modely  And have you made any advances to Emily  Sir  Frederic  Yes yesHa ha haI made advances to her and she made advances to meThe conquest was too easyWere it not for the circumstance of the elopement which will give the sauce a flavour the food wants it would scarcely invite my appetite  Mrs  Modely  But Lady Morden  Sir  Frederic  Is mine whenever I please to make my final attack I am no bad orator in general but in company with her I seem inspiredam absolutely astonished at my own eloquenceNay I have several times spoken with such energy enthusiasm and momentary conviction in praise of virtue that I have actually been in imminent danger of making a convert of myself  Mrs  Modely  In praise of virtue  Sir  Frederic  In praise of virtue There is no making one of these virtuous visionaries rational but by flattering their bigotry and pretending to adore their idol by pursuing which method I have inured her to and made her as familiar with what is prudishly called vice and vicious sentiments as she is with her own thoughts  Mrs  Modely  Yes yes vile rake but remember I'll have no concern in this affairI  Sir  Frederic  Oh poh Ay ay that is understoodYou  winkand know nothing of the matter  Mrs  Modely  Nay but I here publicly protest against your proceedings  Sir  Frederic  aside  And will privately do your utmost to promote them  Mrs  Modely  I exclaim against such licentiousness  Sir  Frederic  I know you doBut if you are thus tender of her Ladyship's reputation you will feel no repugnance at assisting me to irritate hi  Lordship's sensibility  Mrs  Modely  What do you mean  Sir  Frederic  To confess the truth I am a little piqued at Lord Morden's want of feelingI wish I could make him jealous  Mrs  Modely  Jealous Fie He is too well bred  Sir  Frederic  That's unfortunateThe antics of a jealous husband add highly to the enjoyment as well as the reputation of an amourThe poor man is so injured so enraged so distressed so industrious to publish his calamity and is so sincerely pitied and laughed atmust positively rouse my Lord to a sense of his misfortune or it will want poignancyA turtle feast without French wines  Mrs  Modely  Well should I find any opportunity of aiding you  Sir  Frederic  Ay ay I have no doubt of your zeal in the cause  Mrs  Modely  Nay but don't mistake meI only mean as far as teazing his Lordship is concerned  Sir  Frederic  Oh Certainlycertainly  Mrs  Modely  If his Lordship had any real  cause for jealousy I should for Lady Morden's ake be thethethethethe most miserable creature upon earth  Sir  Frederic  To be sure  Mrs  Modely  But you seem mighty secure of your conquest  Sir  Frederic  I am no novice I can tell when a woman's time is comeBesides her Ladyship has granted me a rendezvous  Mrs  Modely  When  Sir  Frederic  Why this very evening to be sure  Mrs  Modely  Where  Sir  Frederic  Here in this very house  Mrs  Modely  Since you are so very certain how came you not to take advantage of being alone with her after the rout  Sir  Frederic  I did that is should have

poor sarvant gis heed to that there sort o'stuffa's not likely to get rich  Mrs  Modely  Upon my word  Sir  Frederic  So Mr Wilmot's head is full of such nonsense is it  Gabriel  Oh a's brimful of such nonsenseand so were I while I lived wi' he which wur the reason as I do suppose that they called me a Simpletonbut I am not so simple as folk think me  Sir  Frederic  aside to Mrs Modely  My dear Mrs Modely leave me for a moment with this fellowYou'll be upon the watch to throw in any hints or aids you happen to see necessary and apropos  Mrs  Modely  Yes yesthat is for Emily and the elopementbut be cautious a defeat would turn the tables upon us and make us the jest of the whole town friends and enemies  Sir  Frederic  How can you fear it  Mrs  Modely  Nay I do not I know my sex

intellects and opens his eyes and earsWell Gabriel you shall find me generous as a Prince providedHere's somebody cominggo into the next room I'll speak with you presently  Gabriel  EesBut I do hope

Ladyship with your respects and as many compliments as you please  Emily  Nay but dear Sir considerit will seem too abrupt Lady Morden is so good so kindI would not give her a moment's pain for the worldBesides I have so many obligations to her Ladyship  Gen  Burland  I begin to be afraid child left you should have too many obligations to her Ladyship  Emily  Let me only stay tonight and

Emily  curtsies  My dear papa knows I never attempt to break my word  Gen  Burland  Yes my child I do know you have hitherto been unspotted and pure as the morn blown lily and my anxiety that you should remain so makes me thus desirous of your quitting this houseWhen I brought you here these doors did not so easily fly open at  the approach of such fine such accomplished gentlemen as Sir Frederic Fashion  Sir  Frederic  with vast pleasure  By heavens he anticipates his misfortunes  aside  Emily  takes the General's hand  Do my dear papa consent only for today I don't ask any longer  Sir  Frederic  aside  I could hug the charming hypocrite  Gen  Burland  Well well Emmy you know I never deny you any thing for indeed you never yet asked any thing that could give the most anxious and affectionate father a moment's pain  Emily  kisses his hand  I thank you dear dear Sir you have made me happy  Sir  Frederic  By my life I shall find this a much more agreeable affair than I hopedYes Generalyouyou are a very good papa  Gen  Burland  You think so  Sir  Frederic  YesI do upon my soul  Gen  Burland  Then I am what you I am afraid will never be  SCENE VIII  SIR FREDERIC  Ha ha ha He

FREDERIC LORD MORDEN  from the Antichamber  Lord  Morden  Well Sir Frederic is her Ladyship returned  Sir  Frederic  Yes she is dressing for dinnerShe bought the Actaeon  Lord  Morden  She did  Sir  Frederic  Oh yesShe is a charming womanthe eyes of the whole room were upon her There were some smart things saidOne observed a likeness between me and Actaeon another thought it bore a far greater resemblance to your Lordship  Lord  Morden  Ha ha ha About the head no doubt  Sir  Frederic  For my part I said I thought the likeness was very capable of being improved  Lord  Morden  You were very kind  Sir  Frederic  Oh pray have you heard that Sir Peter Pry is going to sue for a bill of divorce  Lord  Morden  No  Sir  Frederic  'Tis very true I should not have suspected Sir Peter of such vulgar revenge but I find our married men of fashion are far less liberal in their sentiments than the Ladies  Lord  Morden  Ha ha ha Yes they often want a woman's philosophy in these matters  Sir  Frederic  Yesthey are wasps that fly and feed wherever they can find honey but retain a sting for any marauder that shall approach their nests  Lord  Morden  Somewhat selfish I own  Sir  Frederic  Much more liable to be jealous than the womenand jealousy your Lordship knows is the most ridiculous illbred contemptible thing in nature  Lord  Morden  Ha ha ha Yes yesha ha ha Perfectly despicable  Sir  Frederic  Oh nothing so laughable as the  vagaries of a jealous husband no creature suffers so much or is pitied so little  Lord  Morden  Ha ha ha Aythe thefts of love are applauded not punished  Sir  Frederic  Yes and the poor robb'd husband watchman like twirls his rattle alarms the neighbourhood and collects assistants who never fail to aid the thief and laugh at him and his loss  Lord  Morden  Yeyeyes Ha ha haA husband is a very strange ignominious animal  Sir  Frederic  A jealous husband  Lord  Morden  A paltry mechanical  Sir  Frederic  Without an idea of life or manners  Lord  Morden  Ha ha ha Very trueBut come with me there's a young gentleman in the antichamber of a good family who wishes to be introduced to youA very pretty fellowHas an ambition to do something which shall give him eclat and is therefore desirous of being known to us men of the world  Sir  Frederic  Well I am yours for a few minutes but I must attend Lady Morden at her toilette presently  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  GENERAL BURLAND LORD MORDEN  meeting  GABRIEL  introduces  GENERAL BURLAND  Gen  Burl  WELL my Lord is Lady Morden to be seen  Gabriel  Oh Ees your worship hur will be anon for yonder is Sir Frederic helping the maid to dress her ladyship  Gen  Burland  Helping to dress her Ladyship  Gabriel  EesThey sent me for some milk of roses here  shewing the phial  and would you believe it I wur sich an oaf I had never heard before that roses gave milk  Gen  Burland  AhYou are some halftaught country booby  Gabriel  Why so I do find for in the country the folk do only clearstarch their aprons and ruffles but here ecod they clearstarch their faces  Gen  Burland  Well go carry in your milk and inform her Ladyship I am waiting her leisure  laughing within  Gabriel  Ecod here they all come your honour and rare and merry they be But you  Londoneers do lead a rare ranting life  SCENE II  GENERAL BURLAND LORD MORDEN SIR FREDERIC LADY MORDEN MRS MODELY  The three last from Lady Morden's DressingRoom laughing  Lady  Morden  Ha ha haOh You whimsical toad YouHa ha haYou have halfkilled meI am glad to see you in town GeneralWe have been drawing the characters of our acquaintance and Mrs Modely and Sir Frederic Fashion have been so droll and so satirical  Gen  Burland  Ah No doubt  Lady  Morden  I could not have thought there was so much satisfaction in remembering the failings of one's friends  Mrs  Modely  Oh It makes one so cheerful  Sir  Frederic  And keeps one so charmingly in countenance  Gen  Burland  aside  Which you stand in very great need of  Sir  Frederic  I assure your Ladyship you have an exquisite turn for satire you cut with excessive keenness and yet with a dexterity that makes the very patient tingle with pleasure  Lady  Morden  You are partial  A little more experience will make these things quite familiar but habit only can give one perfect ease  Sir  Frederic  Oh HabitHabit is a wonderful thingHave you heard the anecdote of the NewmarketJockey  Lady  Morden  No what is it  Sir  Frederic  Why a Jockey having had a bad run at the last October meeting was willing to correct the errors of Fortune by turning his lead to gold accordingly on Epping Forest he stopped Major Warboys and bade him deliver to which the Major being one of those singular officers who think it some disgrace to be robb'd replied by firing his pistolThe ball happened to be fatalthe horse set offand to shew the effect of habit the body of the Jockey kept its seat as far as the stable door and there deliberately tumbled off nay some go so far as to assert it was seen to rise in the stirrups but that I believe wants confirmation  Lord  Morden  Ha ha ha  Mrs  Modely  Ha ha ha  Lady  Morden  Pshaw You tragicomic wretch  Lord  Morden  I think you had not much company last night  Lady  Morden  Your Lordship was so well bred and made your visit so short else you would have found a great deal  Mrs  Modely  Oh yes they poured in from all quarters  Sir  Frederic  Sir Nathan Neaptide the yellow admiral came  Lord  Morden  An agreeable guest  Mrs  Modely  Oh rude as his own boatswain  Sir  Frederic  Would teach a starling blasphemy rather than want good conversation  Lady  Morden  He attempts satire  Lord  Morden  But utters abuse  Mrs  Modely  That makes him so much respected  Lady  Morden  Yes like a chimneysweeper in a crowd he makes his way by being dirty  Sir  Frederic  I protest your Ladyship is prodigiously brilliant today  Lady  Morden  No noThough I am a vast admirer of wit A person of wit has one very peculiar and enviable advantage  Lord  Morden  What is that madam  Lady  Morden  Long life  Lord  Morden  Long life  Lady  Morden  Yes A wit has more ideas consequently lives longer in one hour than a fool in seven years  Sir  Frederic  For which reason your Ladyship is already three times the age of old Par  Lady  Morden  Dear Sir Frederic that is so gallant  Mrs  Modely  And so new  Gen  Burland  Why yesThis is the first time I ever heard a Lady told she was old and receive it as a compliment  Lord  Morden  But your visitorsWho had you next  Mrs  Modely  There was Sir Jeremy Stilllife  Lady  Morden  mimics  And his bouquet He primmed himself up in one corner and seemed to think that like the image of a Saint on a holyday he was powdered and painted on purpose to be adored  Mrs  Modely  He was not singular in that  Lady  Morden  Oh no there was a whole row of them that like jars and mandarins on a mantlepiece look'd vastly ornamental and served charmingly to fill up vacancies  Gen  Burland  Every trifle has its use  Mrs  Modely  Lord Index came and stalk'd round the rooms as if he had been loaded with the wisdom of his whole library  Lady  Morden  Yes he look'd as solemn as a monkey after mischief  Sir  Frederic  mimicking his solemnity  And drew up his face in form like a writ of inquiry into damages with a Takenotice engrossed in front  Lord  Morden  He would not stay late for his Lordship is as careful of his health as he is vain of his understanding  Lady  Morden  And yet he is but a kind of rushcandle he may glimmer a long while but will never give much light  Lord  Morden  It seems strange that your people who have acquired a little knowledge always think they possess an infinite deal while those who are the best informed appear continually conscious of wanting more  Gen  Burland  Not strange at all my Lord Amassing knowledge is like viewing the sun through a telescope you enlarge the object but you destroy the glare  Mrs  Modely  Did not you observe that notwithstanding the pearlpowder my Lady Bloom's neck looked remarkably sallow  Lord  Morden  Oh As a Jew's face under a green umbrella  Sir  Frederic  The widow Twinkle as usual talked a vast deal about reputation  Lady  Morden  One is apt to admire a thing one wants  Lord  Morden  She always takes infinite pains to place her reputation like broken china in a buffet with the best side outward  Lady  Morden  She may plaister and cement but will never bring it to bear handling  Mrs  Modely  Mr Pensive the poet came in too  Sir  Frederic  Yes but as nobody took any notice of him he presently went out again  Gen  Burland  A great proof of his good sense  Sir  Frederic  Your poets and sheriff'sofficers are a kind of people every body has heard of but that nobody chooses to know  Lady  Morden  Or if you are under the necessity of receiving a private call from them now and then it would be quite disgraceful to be seen with them in public  Lord  Morden  Your Ladyship used to be very partial to Mr Pensive  Gen  Burland  Yes her Ladyship  used  to have many singular partialities She was once partial to merit and virtue wherever she found them she had a partiality for order oeconomy and domestic duties likewise nay she even went so far as to cherish a partiality for your Lordship  Lady  Morden  Ha ha ha Odious partialities  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha ha  Mrs  Modely  Â   Lord  Morden  MaMaMadamOdious  Lady  Morden  Ha ha ha Toto be sure SirIs it not odious to be unfashionable  Mrs  Modely  CertainlyHa ha ha ha  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha haI protest General youHa ha ha You are too severe  Gen  Burland  Am I  all together  Sir  Frederic  Ha ha ha You are really  Mrs  Modely  Ha ha ha Yes you are indeed General  Lady  Morden  Ha ha ha Yes yes you absolutely are  Gen  Burland  HumphWhy don't you laugh my Lord  Lord  Morden  I do Ha ha haIII do GeneralThough as to severity I own II don't see it in that light  Gen  Burland  No  Lord  Morden  NoI cannot accuse myself of any fault unless the love of pleasure be one  Gen  Burland  Hah  sighs  And your catalogue of pleasures I fancy is pretty extensive  Lord  Morden  Not half so extensive as one could wish  Gen  Burland  A dicebox for instance is one  Lord  Morden  A very principal one  Lady  Morden  My short experience hardly entitles me to venture an opinion but I find a wonderful similarity between gaming and a cold bathYou have aa tremoraa hesitation at first but having once plunged in you are thrown into the most delightful glow  Lord  Morden  Oh an ardent tingling  Gen  Burland  Beware Sir that a shivering fit does not succeed  Mrs  Modely  Ha ha ha  Lady  Morden  Â   Sir  Frederic  Ha ha haYou really have no mercy GeneralYou hit so often and so hard egad  Lord  Morden  I'm vastlyhappyto see you  all so merryTho'upon my honourI can't find out the jest  Gen  Burland  That is strange when you yourself make it  Lady  Morden  Not in the leastThere is many a professed joker who does not understand his own wit  Gen  Burland  half aside  I am tired disgusted with this mixture of folly and wickedness  aloud  May I intrude so far upon your Ladyship as to obtain half an hour's private conversation  Lady  Morden  WhyUpon my wordGeneralII have so many affairs on hand to day that I must beg youto excuse meTomorrow you may command me for as long as you please  Sir  Frederic  Ay do General have the complaisance to wait till tomorrow when my Lady will be more at leisure  Gen  Burland  deeply affected  Well madamâ–ª I did not use to be thought an intruder by your Ladyship and will not begin nowBut since I cannot have the honour to tell you privately I still think myself bound to do my duty and inform you publicly you are in the hands of sharpers "who will filch from you your good name"  with great anxiety  Nay perhaps you are on the very eve of destructionOh guileCan it beMy heart is fullI  goes up to her and most affectionately takes and presses her hand  Lady MordenI have no utteranceBut if there be such a thing as sympathy some small portion of the horror I now feel will communicate itself to you  SCENE III  LORD MORDEN

new purchase  Mrs  Modely  Oh what the Actaeon  Sir  Frederic  Is it come home  Lady  Morden  Oh yesI could not rest till I had it  talking as they are going off  Mrs  Modely  Come my LordI long to see it  Lady  Morden  The tints are charming  Mrs  Modely  So I hearThe grouping excellent  Lady  Morden  Oh delightful  SCENE IV  HARRIET  from the Antichamber  SIR FREDERIC  Harriet  HistSir Frederic  Sir  Frederic  turning back  OhWell Sir how proceeds your amour I thought you had been busied in schemes about that affair  Harriet  Faidth and I am soBut I don't believe I can succeed without your assistance  Sir  Frederic  Perhaps you are a little scrupulous about the means  Harriet  MeIndeed and you have mistaken your manWhy you don't think Sir Frederic I regard the complaints or tears of womenYou and I sure seek our own gratification not their happinessFor if the love of man sought only the happiness of woman faidth there would be nothing but dull marriages fond husbands and

END OF THE FOURTH ACT  ACT V  SCENE I  General Burland  I Cannot keep from this houseThere is a foreboding of mischief which haunts and perturbs my imaginationAnd I fear with reasonThe malignant joy the smothered exult the obscure ironical satire which ran through the discourse of that Sir Frederic were not without a meaningI wish I had not consented to let Emily stayHe sneered I remember at the moment nay it seemed the sneer of triumphI wish she were safe at my own housePoor Lady MordenAnd is it possibleSuch rectitude of heartSuch purity of sentimentI wish Emily were at homeShould my child my darling fall I were a wretch indeed  SCENE II  GENERAL LORD MORDEN  Lord  Morden  wildly  I am miserable distracted rackedThe thunderbolt has struck before I heard itOh that its exterminating power

What and are you come to a sense of this now it is too late  Lord  Morden  There's the miseryThe curse is accomplished and hope is fled  Gen  Burland  Why ay Such is the infatuation of folly and vice

contemns me and justly too that such a thing as I  should pretend to repeat or respect the word virtue  Gen  Burland  It is what every husband every father of a family must expect His smallest foibles will stand as precedents for a swarm of follies and if he has any vices they will propagate a hideous brood that shall extirpate his name from the earth or overwhelm it with obloquy  SCENE III

Frederic  This fellow would outwit a whole conclave of Cardinals  Lady  Morden  Well Sir Frederic here I am you see punctual to my promise  Sir  Frederic  with vast insinuation seeming sincerity and humble rapture all through the scene  Oh Madam how can I repay this bountythis condescensionNeverMy life were a poor sacrifice to such sweetness and such charms  Lady  Morden  Sir Frederic this is a trying a decisive moment I am going to be either the most happy or the most wretched of women You tell me it is your wish your resolution to be no longer that general lover that man of the world you have hitherto been thought  Sir  Frederic  Say not dear Lady it is either my wish or resolution Heaven can testify I have not the power to be any thing but what it shall please you to make me  Lady  Morden  I have owned to you that the levity I have lately affected is not natural to meâ–ª that my heart sighs for an acquaintance a mateâ–ª that like itself is subject to all the sweet emotions of sensibilityYes it was the first wish of my soul to find this correspondent heart A heart beating with the same ardour vibrating to the same sensations panting for the same pleasures shrinking from the same pangs pliant yet firm gentle yet aspiring passionate yet pureSuch I once thought Lord Morden'sShould I a second time be deceived  Sir  Frederic  I am poor in proofs of sincerity I have none to offerMy former errors are present punishments To deny or even palliate them would imply intentional deceit and this is a moment in which I would wish for men and gods to be witnesses of my truthI have had I own most libertine opinions of your gentle sex but these I now solemnly renounceHad I before met with a Lady Morden I should before have made this renunciationBut perhaps the women it has been my misfortune to know deserved in part the light esteem in which I held themNever till now did I find one who could mutually inspire such passion and respect Such agitated burning hopes Such excruciating fears or thoughts so sanctified as those I this moment feel  Lady  Morden  Yet Sir Frederic I cannot help observing your conversation in society seems still tinged with the impurity of your former libertine principles  Sir  Frederic  I own Lady Morden with confusion own I have not hitherto had the courage or perhaps I have wanted strength to stem the torrent but aided by you I feel I dare promise any thing  Lady  Morden  I confess Sir Frederic the mind finds some difficulty in rooting out fears planted in it by reiterated accusations The stories the world tells of you are dreadful And yet there is such heartfelt conviction attends your present words that to me it is impossible to listen and retain a doubt  Sir  Frederic  This generous confidence transports me fills me with gratitude and inspires  rapturous hope  clasps her round the waist  Oh gently suffer me to conduct you where love lies in panting breathless ecstasy  SCENE V  To them  GABRIEL  abruptly in a

understanding to comprehend your meaning  Lady  Morden  IndeedWell if you  are  so very dull of apprehension  am I to blame  Sir  Frederic  Madam  Lady  Morden  OhDo you recollectthis letter  Sir  Frederic  HowFaithless fiend  goes to assault Gabriel who throws back his greatcoat and appears dressed as a gentleman  Gabriel  Keep off or dread the chastisement I am prompted instantaneously to

become what I seemed was indeed most painful but the loss of your affection were not pain 'Twere horrorI told you my passion was too permanent to be shakenAh how could you imagine I meant another Or think it possible I ever could forget that chaste that ardent that eternal love I have so repeatedly vowed  Lord  Morden  Oh for wordsI am all love gratitude rapture and amazement  Gen  Burland  And so is Sir Frederic apparentlyNay even you Madam seem a little surprised  Mrs  Modely  Me Oh dear no  Lady  Morden  to Sir Frederic  Dear Sir though you are a deep and excellent plotter if there have been counterplotsam I to blame  curtsies  Mrs  Modely  with affected candour  Certainly not  Lady  Morden  If man is sometimes vain presumptuous and unprincipled and if you are a manam I to blame  Mrs  Modely  Certainly not  Mr  Wilmot  If I assumed a mean disguise that I might aid a sister to detect and expose the mean machinations of Seductionam I to blame  Mrs  Modely  Certainly not  Emily  If following the advice of this dear Lady  to Lady Morden  simplicity has made cunning outwit itselfam I to blame  curtsying first to Sir Frederic and then to Mrs Modely  Gen  Burland  with vast pleasure  Certainly not  Lady  Morden  If since happiness is the pursuit of us all I wish to be as happy as possible  most affectionately taking Lord Morden's hand  am I to blame  Omnes  Certainly not  Sir

ought you are exposed and my resentment is appeased  Sir  Frederic  Then Madamthethe contract  Harriet  There it is Sir  returns it  I never meant to make any other use of it than what has  been better effected by different means  curtsying to Lady Morden and Mr Wilmot  Sir  Frederic  Madam  Harriet  No thanks Sir  Gen  Burland  No they would sit a little awkwardly  Lady  Morden  And now Sir Frederic if after this lesson you should still retain your former principles and practices and hereafter receive a still severer punishment I hope you will acknowledgewe are not to blame  Exeunt Omnes
