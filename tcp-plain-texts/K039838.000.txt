 THE NATIONAL ADVOCATES A POEM AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED TO THE NONOURABLE THOMAS ERSKINE AND VICARY GIBBS ESQUIRE  Mirum qua intentione quibus clamoribus omnia exceperint qui modo reclamabant tanta conversio vel negotii dignitatem vel proventum orationis vel actoris constantiam subsecuta est  PLIN Epist lib ix ep  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DEBRETT OPPOSITE BURLINGIONHOUSE PICCADILLY MDCCXC    THE NATIONAL ADVOCATES  Spirits divine who pleas'd at Nature's birth  Took your kind station round the recent earth  To watch the world in viewless state sublime  A guardian each of each allotted clime  Ye who with pity have had cause to melt  And anguish such as angels feel have felt  To witness evils that ye most abhor  The fiendlike phrensy of insatiate war  Leagues without justice without glory strife  And mad profusion of envenom'd life  Though crimes from which your hallow'd optics shrink  Hurry the vex'd globe to perdition's brink  Ye will not yet your guilty charge abjure  And fly from evils that ye fail to cure  No Ye have heard from Britain's favour'd isle  Sounds to excite a troubled Seraph's smile  And draw to earth on just protection's plan  Pure spirits friendly to the weal of man  The sound of joy that town to town repeats  Circling from London and her crowded streets  As Echo guides it with exulting hand  To every confine of th' enfranchis'd land  That sound of joy was not the frantic roar  Of martial triumph pamper'd high with gore  That giving murder a gigantic frame  Rears the grim idol deck'd with Glory's name  When sanguinary man with impious pride  In false devotion real guilt to hide  With inconsistence not to Pagans known  Presents preposterous thanks to Mercy's throne  For having tainted both the earth and air  With blood that Heaven commanded him to spare  The sound of joy this sympathetic song  Would with fond zeal to distant time prolong  Spoke not of war but peace's nobler palm  In civic tempests it announc'd a calm  Assuring Britain in her worst alarm  That Law's bright aegis blazes on her arm  That round her sons the snares of legal death  Burst at the hallow'd touch of Virtue's breath  Ye nameless powers who Reason's voice inspire  Who give to Eloquence her patriot fire  Ye who when man in fields of spotless fame  Strains noble faculties with noblest aim  Haste to refresh him at true honour's goal  With eulogy the music of the soul  Grant in this verse such lucid praise to live  As only Truth fair child of Light can give  They only merit who of spirit clear  And deaf to int'rest as exempt from fear  Exert while Power's presumptuous claims they scan  Celestial gifts in aid of suffering man  Shew splendid talents sanctified by worth  And made a blessing to th' admiring earth  To you entitled to the world's applause  Fraternal advocates in Freedom's cause  To you whom Friendship with fond pride unites  With all the lustre of her ancient rites  Of equal probity and varied powers  In arduous duty's spirittrying hours  Each to the other a benignant star  The Scipio and the Laelius of the bar  To you illustrious friends whose legal fame  Shall last while Law herself a sacred name  Holds her primaeval right her blest employ  Parent of peace and cherisher of joy  To you I offer nor will you refuse  You who as Freedom's child caress the Muse  Tribute no power commands no treasures buy  Pure as the tear of joy in true Love's eye  Verse undebas'd by adulation's art  Fresh from the fountain of a feeling heart  That scorns all Party rage of either side  Faction's fierce spleen and Pow'r's suspicious pride  And loving England that her laws display  The blest beneficence of temperate sway  Honours her advocates whose truth and zeal  Stand the firm pillars of the public weal  Yes ye brave pleaders in a cause whose weight  Press'd on the vitals of a panting State  'Twas not alone the being of a few  Black with false guilt in dim suspicion's view  Whose lives in deference to minds so rare  Justice consign'd to your defensive care  'Twas Britain's honour 'twas her noblest wealth  The very essence of the public health  For which your patriot eloquence display'd  Those matchless powers that bold yet temperate aid  Which Themis sanctioned with a sacred smile  And rightful joy convuls'd her rescued isle  Whence is the gen'rous pride a test of worth  That makes a Briton glory in his birth  Not that his country Nature's favour'd isle  Is fenc'd by commerce with a golden pile  And can impel with rich temptation's flood  Poor continental kings to trade in blood  Though reaping as their fruit of martial care  Discomfiture disgrace dismay despair  No he exults that in his native land  Hearts by the warmth of Liberty expand  And Intellect a tree that loves the light  Shoots like a cedar of imperial height  While fearless Freedom with an eagle's ken  Searching the soul of measures and of men  Alike contemns in their unmasking hour  The dupe of Party and the slave of Power  And celebrates what here she still can find  True public virtue in a potent mind  When a sick nation like a feverish child  Sinks in a panick wayward dark and wild  From fear to fear in blind confusion runs  Mistakes for foreign imps her genuine sons  Calls Loyalty a Traitor Truth a Liar  And Freedom's vital warmth Sedition's fire  When rampant Power beyond Ixion proud  Impregnates with chimeras every cloud  Blest be the minds whose virtuous labours serve  To save their darkling country's visual nerve  While fancied plots and shadowy perils fly  Distemper's film that dimm'd the nation's eye  Who with recover'd sight exults to see  It is not treason still to wish her free  Reason may smile if sophistry would show  A faithful subject is a treacherous foe  And those who strike at vices in the State  Must mean a Monarch's fall and seek his fate  As if corruption were the vital spring  Of that effulgent mortal styl'd a King  Unguarded Poet in this troubled time  Beware cries Caution how you rant in rhime  Lest you should find there's treason in the metre  That deems a Monarch a mere earthly creature  With rational respect not stupid awe  As the just offspring and the guard of law  The voice of England her creative voice  Hails in a King the ruler of her choice  And Nature here as if inclin'd to claim  Immortal rev'rence for the regal name  Bade Alfred's virtues to the world evince  How rightfully we prize a Patriot Prince  Model of Kings in a benighted age  All that adorns the Hero and the Sage  Lycurgus Caesar Antonine in one  With all their talents of their errors none  Thou whose pure spirit to thy subjects taught  The sons of England should be free as thought  Thy arm preserv'd and thy more potent mind  With sapient aid establish'd or refin'd  For scenes more perilous than martial strife  Our guardian Juries as the friends of life  With fond delight and with parental love  Thy people's Father from the realms above  Thy sainted spirit may exult to see  That people guarding what they owe to thee  Law's soundest buckler Freedom's brightest dower  Shielding bold Truth from irritable Power  Ye Great whose souls to genuine glory spring  With such ambition as becomes a king  Mark how true greatness may in ev'ry clime  Command unceasing life thro' distant time  Gifts that Beneficence on Wisdom's plan  Confers to meliorate the lot of man  Live unimpair'd unconscious of decay  While Pride's ignoble pageants pass away  The heart of Alfred still our love excites  He lives he breathes in ev'ry Jury's rights  Though of his line no Prince upholds the name  He still exists the favourite of Fame  Though following kings of ampler pomp and power  Finish'd in fume their transitory hour  Tudors of hot and Stuarts of cold blood  Have sunk like wrecks in a tempestuous flood  For at the will of Heaven's Almighty Sire  Palaces fall and dynasties expire  The noble Line that with Religion's smile  Freedom invited to this farfam'd Isle  Whom Honour wafted on his golden wings  To this his fav'rite throne and cried "Be Kings  Rule with mild sway whom Force shall ne'er enslave  And long may Virtue guard what Freedom gave"  This Line that boasts the purest claim to power  May failAvert just Heav'n their final hour  And keep them as they keep their regal vow  Yet they may fail and mortals know not how  But ifin times no living eye can see  Distant far distant may that period be  If England must perceive with fond regret  The star of Brunswick is for ever set  A George with Alfred may this glory share  That Law's pure current was his sov'reign care  If from great Alfred's reign free Juries flow  The independent Judge to George we owe  Mild Sov'reign doom'd in life's tumultuous dream  To feel of bliss and woe each wide extreme  Justice could well thy youthful care engage  May Heaven make Peace an idol of thy age  O bid this wheel of War revolve no more  This frantic lottery of guilt and gore  Where when Truth weighs the profit and the pain  None but the Fiends of desolation gain  Let not false policy to Nature blind  And deaf to Reason pleading for mankind  Precipitately urge a barb'rous war  That Equity and Truth alike abhor  As weak in conduct as devoid of right  And boding certain ill in ev'ry light  Speed as it may each opposite event  Freedom must fear Humanity lament  No cry the advocates for lasting strife  Let us be prodigal of wealth and life  Let Britain's treasure round the globe be hurl'd  Long let her subsidise the regal world  Rather than see the Gallic rage advance  And madd'ning Europe ape the crimes of France  England brave nation of an honest mind  Yet often dup'd as credulously blind  Too apt when artifice obstructs thy view  To shrink from fancied ills and scorn the true  Learn when thy neighbour of superb pretence  Whose feelings are too quick for sober sense  Learn when assuming France by Folly led  Might best awaken thy judicious dread  Not in the hour when spurning base controul  She pluck'd the iron from her wounded soul  Not in the hour when Indignation's arm  O'erthrew her proud Bastile as with a charm  And gave to festive Joy the vacant space  Nobly disburthen'd of Earth's dark disgrace  Noin her ancient calm her nerveless hour  Of tame submission to despotic power  France might excite more reasonable fear  Than all her armies in their first career  For when in Tyranny's cold grasp she lay  And strove to smile her sense of wrongs away  On her soft breast a specious Fiend she nurs'd  Of all insinuating fiends the worst  Pleas'd to empoison nations with her breath  And sow the viewless seeds of public death  To deaden virtue to dispirit joy  And all the energies of life destroy  For in the minds that fearsul of deceit  Slowly embrace this fascinating cheat  Reason selfpuzzled loses all its skill  To mark th' eternal bounds of good and ill  To them Religion's sweet seraphic face  Appears the sickly mask of sour grimace  Man her dear charge they deem a moving clod  And deaf to the paternal voice of God  Despise the gift his gracious power bestow'd  Feeling existence a lethargic load  Whence sprung the fiend whose tyrannous controul  Thus robs of every joy the palsied soul  Born to avenge what Greece endur'd from Rome  Amidst an attic garden's baneful bloom  Rose the fair pest in beauty and in power  A new Pandora wretchedness her dower  Sweet was the wreath of fading flowers she wore  And gay  The doctrine of Epicurus ever ruinous to society it had its rise when Greece was declining and perhaps hastened its dissolution as also that of Rome It is now propagated in France and England and seems likely to produce the same effect in both  GRAY's Works to page  Philosophy the name she bore  Two kindred forms where'er she moves are seen  The sure attendants of their potent Queen  First bloated Indolence whose cheeks disclose  The sickly colours of the wither'd rose  Whose languid arm scarce bears the light employ  To lift the bubbling cup of mimic joy  Whose lips deride with a contemptuous sneer  Firm Virtue struggling in Contention's sphere  Behind her Apathy whose halfglaz'd eyes  Ne'er melt with love or sparkle with surprise  Whose touch more cold than Terror's icy breath  Shoots through the wither'd heart petrific Death  With these her ministers to Rome she fled  And struck the nerve of Roman vigour dead  The tow'ring Eagle fell her palsied prey  And dying Freedom curs'd her baleful sway  Awhile she sat with Triumph's flag unfurl'd  The laughing Vict'ress of the Roman world  In pomp Circean there she joy'd to shine  Her cave the palace Emperors her swine  But soon her nerveless slaves unfit for war  Sunk into dust before the sons of Thor  The Sorceress fell with all her feeble charms  Crush'd by the brave barbarians' massive arms  Through many an age she lay in lifeless trance  But wak'd to wider ill in servile France  Gallia's proud Genius who by force in vain  Had toil'd to forge an universal chain  Tried o'er the earth his empire to extend  By the smooth arts of this insidious friend  Snare Virtue's sons by Pleasure's syren form  And sap those bulwarks that he fail'd to storm  Brave generous Britons who have less to fear  From open enmity's uplifted spear  Beware this smiling pestilence and know  In French Philosophy your deadliest foe  O for that warning lyre whose solemn swell  Loudly proclaim'd th' advancing Lord of Hell  When first that prime Artificer of Ill  Leap'd with light bound o'er Eden's highest hill  For not more hostile to those happy bowers  Came the fierce Chief of Falsehood's treach'rous Powers  Than the gay Syren fraught with impious guile  To the frank virtues of this fearless Isle  Yet vain such warningAs a welcome guest  Deluded Britain met the smiling pest  And oh how wide new scenes of woe extend  Since the base stranger grew her bosom friend  Vain Dissipation in her wild abyss  O'erwhelms the temp'rate guards of genuine bliss  No more Fidelity with Seraph's power  Spreads her firm wing around the nuptial bower  That heirs of Truth of Virtue Health and Grace  May spring to life from Passion's pure embrace  Prepar'd to cherish with affection fond  Each private duty and each public bond  No more Content and Gratitude whose light  Turns Earth to Paradise in mental sight  Through dark'ning scenes bewilder'd Reason guide  And make Humility more strong than Pride  To French Philosophy these fall a prey  And Life's prime blessings are all laugh'd away  Nay Life itself For when the Sophist tribes  With the keen stroke of their sarcastic gibes  Have cut the cordage for our safety given  By which the anchor'd spirit rests on Heaven  What gulphs the vessel of the Mind o'erwhelm  When spleenful Phrensy has usurp'd the helm  Have we not seen a Francetaught Sophist here  To impious Suicide a refuge rear  And give with argument's delusive air  A treach'rous sanction to her mad despair  Tempestuous England Though we oft surmise  The heavy vapours of thy varying skies  Breed in our sadden'd frames the mental strife  Where fancy sickens with disgust of life  Not all thy fogs however damp and dense  Can fix such languor on our loaded sense  As false Philosophers by stealth impart  To the cold fibres of the hard'ning heart  When their base maxims on our spirit steal  And quench our native flames of love and zeal  No though around us exhalations run  That seem to smother the enfeebled Sun  True English minds that England still admire  And feel the genuine glow of patriot fire  Defy the storm from southern caves releas'd  And the raw vapours of the blighting East  Within themselves an antidote they bear  Gainst all the dark caprices of the air  'Tis fervent gratitude and fond esteem  For names still bright with Public Virtue's beam  'Tis gen'rous pride of reason the result  That makes a Briton in his birth exult  As the compatriot of minds whose worth  Has giv'n such splendour to this speck of earth  That while o'er other realms in Slavery's chain  An heavy mental twilight seem'd to reign  Here and here only with meridian ray  Glow'd the full warmth of intellectual day  And generous thoughts that no damp winds controul  Form the pure climate of the healthy soul  "Aye in old time cries Ageengender'd Spleen  Such England wasbut mark her alter'd scene  See Lux'ry's torrents like hot lava shoot  With'ring all Genius killing Virtue's root  Nor leaving ought unblasted by their fire  That Sense can praise or Honesty admire"  This fretful humour of the fancied Sage  Has in each polish'd aera spent its rage  While credulous Simplicity aghast  Has heard of present shame and glory past  Of nerveless bodies of enfeebled minds  And every ill that sickly Fancy finds  When all's inverted that her optics see  And nothing is but what has ceas'd to be  But come Historic Truth whose hand enrolls  Each splendid record of exalted souls  Come Moral Fiction o'er whose mimic glass  Bright pageants of ideal merit pass  Come hand in hand fair friends to Virtue come  And strike this murmuring detraction dumb  Say in each group your blended scenes unfold  Keen Admiration can no names behold  That claim in public love a nobler part  Or win more honour from the upright heart  Than you ye Legal Heroes of my song  As dear to fancy as in reason strong  Who in despite of mental toil and pain  That seem to threaten the o'erburden'd brain  Breath'd the pure soul of manly eloquence  Simple in language liberal in sense  And with intrepid Virtue's guardian care  Rescued the Captives tangled in the snare  Of bloodhound spies whose prostituted mind  Toil'd to create the guilt it could not find  No proud Antiquity's departed host  Whose shadowy marvels Learning loves to boast  Shew not in civic glory's favourite days  Pleaders more worthy of a People's praise  When by rapt Greece Demosthenes was heard  And thunder seem'd less potent than his word  The stormy passions of revenge and ire  Ting'd his bright language with intemp'rate fire  When Tully destin'd to the Grecian's doom  Pour'd forth philippics to applauding Rome  Personal hate with patriot virtue warm  Gave force and fury to his verbal storm  These heroes of the hot forensic scene  Blended with public zeal their private spleen  Not so the Pleaders who this verse inspire  Who merit paeans from a nobler lyre  As free from virulence as void of fear  In conduct graceful as in motive clear  They paid just homage to presiding Law  With manly deference and decent awe  No selfish pride in which light minds rejoice  Rais'd to victorious sway their temp'rate voice  But England's welfare on their heart imprest  Pure public virtue glowing in their breast  Arm'd their just souls with intellectual force  To check Authority's vindictive course  And turn Delusion's tide in Danger's hour  Reckless of frowns from Prejudice and Power  ERSKINE and GIBBS whose names to Nature dear  Ages unborn may gratesully revere  While this memorial of your worth I raise  And firmly credit what I fondly praise  One hateful truth shall Mem'ry dare suggest  Grav'd on the deep recesses of her breast  Rudely she teaches from her ample range  That Public Virtue is most apt to change  The faithful hand that these frank lines supplied  Ne'er lavish'd incense by the heart belied  But with fond zeal to court in joyous youth  A public idol of imagin'd truth  Has oft discarded an unfinish'd task  Finding Apostacy in Virtue's mask  For ere my fingers could the garland weave  Like that our hapless Father twin'd for Eve  It dropp'd and all its faded roses shed  Scorning to garnish an Apostate's head  But may this civic wreath in eager haste  Form'd of wild flowers by Merit's smile be grac'd  For lives preserv'd unquestionably due  The nameless donor proves the tribute true  Bays from Sincerity's obscure retreat  May cherish Virtue in Contention's heat  Ye to whom England owes a pleasing debt  That English gratitude should ne'er forget  Thus Freedom prays to recompense your care  Deign righteous Heav'n to ratify the pray'r  "Live my firm aids to life's serenest end  Friends to each other each the people's friend  Live beyond life of Briton's glory part  Enshrin'd for ever in the public heart"  FINIS
