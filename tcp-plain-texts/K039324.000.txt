 consented and fixed tomorrow for the happy Day  Sharp  'Tis well she did Sir or it might have been a dreadful one for us in our present Condition All your Money spent your Moveables sold your Honour almost ruined and your humble Servant almost starved we could not possibly have stood it two Days longerBut if this young Lady will marry you and relieve us o'my Conscience I'll turn Friend to the Sex rail no more at Matrimony but curse the Whores and think of a Wife myself  Gay  And yet  Sharp  when I think how I have imposed upon her I am almost resolv'd to throw myself at her Feet tell her the real Situation of my Affairs ask her Pardon and implore her Pity  Sharp  After Marriage with all my Heart Sir but don't let your Conscience and Honour so far get the better of your Poverty and good Sense as to rely on so great Uncertainties as a fine Lady's Mercy and Goodnature  Gay  I know her generous Temper and am almost persuaded to rely upon it What because I am poor shall I abandon my Honour  Sharp  Yes you must Sir or abandon me So pray discharge one of us for eat I must and speedily too and you know very well that that Honour of yours will neither introduce you to a great Man's Table nor get me Credit for a single BeefSteak  Gay  What can I do  Sharp  Nothing while Honour sticks in  your Throat do gulp Master and down with it  Gay  Prithee leave me to my Thoughts  Sharp  Leave you No not in such bad Company I'll assure you Why you must certainly be a very great Philosopher Sir to moralize and declaim so charmingly as you do about Honour and Conscience when your Doors are beset with Bailiffs and not one single Guinea in your Pocket to bribe the Villains  Gay  Don't be witty and give your Advice Sirrah  Sharp  Do you be wise and take it Sir But to be serious you certainly have spent your Fortune and outliv'd your Credit as your Pockets and my Belly can testify Your Father has disown'd you all your Friends forsook you except myself who am starving with you Now Sir if you marry this young Lady who as yet thank Heaven knows nothing of your Misfortunes and by that means procure a better Fortune than that you squander'd away make a good Husband and turn Oeconomist you still may be happy may still be Sir  William  's Heir and the Lady too no Lofer by the Bargain There's Reason and Argument Sir  Gay  'Twas with that Prospect I first made Love to her and though my Fortune has been ill spent I have at least purchased Discretion with it  Sharp  Pray then convince me of that Sir and make no more Objections to the Marriage You see I am reduced to my Waistcoat already and when Necessity has undress'd me from Top to Toe she must begin with you and then we shall be forced to keep House and die by Inches Look you Sir if you won't resolve to take my Advice while you have one Coat to your Back I must e'en take to my Heels while I have Strength to run and something to cover me So Sir wishing you much Comfort and Consolation with your bare Conscience I am your most obedient and halfstarv'd Friend and Servant    Going  Gay  Hold  Sharp  you won't leave me  Sharp  I must eat Sir by my Honour and Appetite I must  Gay  Well then I am resolv'd to favour the Cheat and as I shall quite change my former Course of Life happy may be the Consequences at least of this I am sure  Sharp  That you can't be worse than you are at present  Gay    A knocking without    Who's there  Sharp  Some of your former good Friends who favour'd you with Money at fifty  per Cent  and helped you to spend it and are now become daily Memento's to you of the Folly of trusting Rogues following Whores and laughing at my Advice  Gay  Cease your Impertinence to the Door if they are Duns tell 'em my Marriage is now certainly fix'd and persuade em still to forbear a few Days longer and keep my Circumstances a Secret for their Sakes as well as my own  Sharp  O never fear it Sir they still have so much Friendship for you not to desire your Ruin to their own Disadvantage  Gay  And do you hear  Sharp  if it shou'd be any body from  Melissa  say I am not at home lest the bad Appearance we make here should make 'em suspect something to our Disadvantage  Sharp  I'll obey you Sirbut I am afraid they will easily discover the consumptive Situation of our Affairs by my chopfallen Countenance    Exit  Sharp  Gay  These very Rascals who are now continually dunning and persecuting me were the very Persons who led me to my Ruin partook of my Prosperity and profess'd the greatest Friendship  Sharp    without    Upon my word Mrs  Kitty  my Master's not at home  Kitty    without    Lookee  Sharp  I must and will see him  Gay  Ha what do I hear  Melissa  's Maid What has brought her here My Poverty has made her my Enemy tooShe is certainly come with no good IntentNo Friendship there without FeesShe's coming up StairsWhat must I doI'll get into this Closet and listen    Exit  Gayless  Enter  Sharp  and  Kitty  Kitty  I must know where he is and will

But come where is your Master for see him I must  Sharp  Pray Mrs  Kitty  what's your Opinion of this Match between my Master and your Mistress  Kitty  Why I have no Opinion of it at all and yet most of our Wants will be reliev'd by it too for instance now your Master will get a Fortune that's what I'm afraid he wants my Mistress will get a Husband that's what she has wanted for some time you will have the Pleasure of my Conversation and I an Opportunity of breaking your Head for your Impertinence  Sharp  Madam I'm your most humble Servant But I'll tell you what Mrs  Kitty  I am positively against the Match for was I a Man of my Master's Fortune  Kitty  You'd marry if you cou'd and mend it Ha ha ha Pray  Sharp  where does your Master's Estate lie  Gay  Oh the Devil what a Question was there    Aside    Sharp  Lie lie why it liesfaith I can't name any particular Place it lies in so many his Effects are divided some here some there his Steward hardly knows himself  Kitty  Scatter'd scatter'd I suppose But harkee  Sharp  what's become of your Furniture You seem to be a little bare here at present  Gay  What has she found out that too    Aside  Sharp  Why you must know as soon as the Wedding was fixed my Master order'd me to remove his Goods into a Friend's House to make room for a Ball which he designs to give here the Day after the Marriage  Kitty  The luckiest Thing in the World for my Mistress designs to have a Ball and Entertainment here tonight before the Marriage and that's my Business with your Master  Sharp  The Devil it is    Aside  Kitty  She'll not have it publick she designs to invite only eight or ten Couple of Friends  Sharp  No more  Kitty  No more and she order'd me to desire your Master not to make a great Entertainment  Sharp  Oh never fear  Kitty  Ten or a Dozen little nice Things with some Fruit I believe will be enough in all Conscience  Sharp  Oh curse your Conscience    Aside  Kitty  And what do you think I have done of my own Head  Sharp  What  Kitty  I have invited all my Lord  Stately's  Servants to come and see you and have a Dance in the Kitchen Won't your Master be surpriz'd  Sharp  Much so indeed  Kitty  Well be quick and find out your Master and make what haste you can with your Preparations you have no Time to losePrithee  Sharp  what's the matter with you I have not seen you for some time and you seem to look a little thin  Sharp  Oh my unfortunate Face    Aside    I'm in pure good Health thank you Mrs  Kitty  and I'll assure you I have a very good Stomach never better in all my Life and I am as full of Vigour Hussy    Offers to kiss her    Kitty  What with that Face Well bye bye    going    oh  Sharp  what illlooking Fellows are those were standing about your Door when  I came in They want your Master too I suppose  Sharp  Hum Yes they are waiting for himThey are some of his Tenants out of the Country that want to pay him some Money  Kitty  Tenants What do you let his Tenants stand in the Street  Sharp  They chuse it as they seldom come to Town they are willing to see as much of it as they can when they o they are raw ignorant honest people  Kitty  Well I must run home farewelBut do your hear Get something substantial for us in the Kitchena Ham a Turkey or what you willWe'll be very merry and be sure remove the Tables and Chairs away there too that we may have room to dance I

no Occasion for Whetters and Provocatives  Gay  Curs'd Misfortune What can we do  Sharp  Hang ourselves I see no other Remedy except you have a Receipt to give a Ball and a Supper without Meat or Musick  Gay  Melissa  has certainly heard of my bad Circumstances and has invented this Scheme to distress me and break off the Match  Sharp  I don't believe it Sir begging your Pardon  Gay  No why did her Maid then make so strict an Enquiry into my Fortune and Affairs  Sharp  For two very substantial Reasons the first to satisfy a Curiosity natural to her as a Woman the second to have the Pleasure of my Conversation very natural to her as a Woman of Taste and Understanding  Gay  Prithee be more serious Is not our All at stake  Sharp  Yes Sir and yet that All of ours is of so little Consequence that a Man with a very small Share of Philosophy may part from it without much Pain or Uneasiness  However Sir I'll convince you in half an Hour that Mrs  Melissa  knows nothing of your Circumstances and I'll tell you what too Sir she shan't be here tonight and yet you shall marry her tomorrow Morning  Gay  How how dear Sharp  Sharp  'Tis here here Sir Warm warm and Delays will cool it therefore I'll away to her and do you be as merry as Love and Poverty will permit you  Would you succeed a faithful Friend depute  Whose Head can plan and Front can execute  I am the Man and I hope you neither dispute my Friendship or Qualification  Gay  Indeed I don't Prithee be gone  Sharp  I fly    Exeunt  SCENE Melissa's  Lodgings  Enter  Melissa  and  Kitty  Mel  You surprize me Kitty the Master not at home the Man in Confusion no Furniture in the House and illlooking Fellows about the Doors 'Tis all a Riddle  Kitty  But very easy to be explain'd  Mel  Prithee explain it then nor keep me longer in Suspence  Kitty  The Affair is this Madam Mr  Gayless  is over Head and Ears in Debt you are over Head and Ears in Love you'll marry him tomorrow the next Day your whole Fortune goes to his Creditors and you and your Children are to live comfortably upon the Remainder  Mel  I cannot think him base  Kitty  But I know they are all baseYou are very young and very ignorant of the Sex I am young too but have more Experience you never was in Love before I have been in Love with an hundred and try'd 'em all and know 'em to be a Parcel of barbarous perjured deluding bewitching Devils  Mel  The low Wretches you have had to do with may answer the Character you give 'em but Mr  Gayless    Kitty  Is a Man Madam  Mel  I hope so  Kitty  or I would have nothing to do with him  Kitty  With all my HeartI have given you my Sentiments upon the Occasion and shall leave you to your own Inclinations  Mel  Oh Madam I am much oblig'd to you for your great Condescension ha ha ha However I have so great a Regard for your Opinion that had I certain Proofs of his Villany  Kitty  Of his Poverty you may have a hundred I am sure I have had none to the contrary  Mel  Oh there the Shoe pinches    Aside  Kitty  Nay so far from giving me the usual Perquisites of my Place he has not so much as kept me in Temper with little endearing Civilities and one might reasonably expect when a Man is deficient in one Way that he should make it up in another    Knocking without  Mel  See who's at the Door    Exit  Kitty  I must be cautious how I hearken too much to this Girl Her bad Opinion of Mr  Gayless  seems to arise from his Disregard of her  Enter  Sharp  and  Kitty  So  Sharp  have you found your Master Will Things be ready for the Ball and Entertainment  Sharp  To your Wishes Madam I have just now bespoke the Musick and Supper and wait now for your Ladyship's farther Commands  Mel  My Compliments to your Master and let him know I and my Company will be with him by Six we design to

  Sighing  Mel  What d'ye mean  Sharp  Pray don't ask me Madam I beseech you don't Let us change the Subject  Kitty  Insist upon knowing it MadamMy Curiosity must be satisfied or I shall burst    Aside  Mel  I do insist upon knowingOn pain of my Displeasure tell me  Sharp  If my Master should knowI must not tell you Madam indeed  Mel  I promise you upon my Honour he never shall  Sharp  But can your Ladyship insure Secrecy from that Quarter  Kitty  Yes Mr Jackanapes for any thing you can say  Mel  I'll engage for her  Sharp  Why then in short MadamI cannot tell you  Mel  Don't trifle with me  Sharp  Then since you will have it MadamI lost my Coat in Defence of your Reputation  Mel  In Defence of my Reputation  Sharp  I will assure you Madam I've suffer'd very much in Defence of it which is more than I would have done for my own  Mel  Prithee explain  Sharp  In short Madam you was seen about a Month ago to make a visit to my Master alone  Mel  Alone my Servant was with me  Sharp  What Mrs  Kitty  So much the worse for she was look'd upon as my Property and I was brought in guilty as well as you and my Master  Kitty  What your Property Jackanapes  Mel  What is all this  Sharp  Why Madam as I came out but now to make Preparations for you and your Company tonight Mrs  Pryabout  the Attorney's Wife at next Door calls to me Hark'ee Fellow says she Do you and your modest Master know that my Husband shall indite your House at the next Parish Meeting for a Nusance  Mel  A Nusance  Sharp  I said soA Nusance I believe none in the Neighbourhood live with more Decency and Regularity

Day describing you Madam And did not I see  Mel  See Oh scandalous What  Sharp  Modesty requires my Silence  Mel  Did not you contradict her  Sharp  Contradict her Why I told her I was sure she ly'd for zounds said I for I could not help swearing I am so well convinced of the Lady's and my Master's Prudence that I am sure had they a mind to amuse themselves they would certainly have drawn the WindowCurtains  Mel  What did you say nothing else Did not you convince her of her Error and Impertinence  Sharp  She swore to such Things that I could do nothing but swear and call Names upon which outbolts her Husband upon me with a fine taper Crab in his Hand and fell upon me with such Violence that being half delirious I made a full Confession  Mel  A full Confession What did you confess  Sharp  That my Master lov'd Fornication that you had no Aversion to it that Mrs  Kitty  was a Bawd and your humble Servant a Pimp  Kitty  A Bawd a Bawd Do I look like a Bawd Madam  Sharp  And so Madam in the Scuffle my Coat was torn to pieces as well as your Reputation  Mel  And so you join'd to make me infamous  Sharp  For Heaven's sake Madam what could I do His Proofs fell so thick upon me as Witness my Head    shewing his Head plaister'd    that I would have given up all the Maidenheads in the Kingdom rather than have my Brains beat to a Jelly  Mel  Very wellbut I'll be reveng'dAnd did not you tell your Master of this  Sharp  Tell him No Madam Had I told him his Love is so violent for you that he would certainly have murder'd half the Attornies in Town by this Time  Mel  Very wellBut I'm resolv'd not to go to your Master's to Night  Sharp  Heavens and my Impudence be praised    Aside    Kitty  Why not Madam If you are not guilty face your Accusers  Sharp  Oh the Devil

Mel  What at Murder  Kitty  Don't fear Madam there will be no Murder if  Sharp  's concern'd  Sharp  Murder Madam 'Tis Self defence besides in these Sort of Skirmishes there are never more than two or three kill'd for supposing they bring the whole Body of Militia upon us down but with a Brace of them and away fly the rest of the Covey  Mel  Persuade me never so much I won't go that's my Resolution  Kitty  Why then I'll tell you what Madam since you are resolv'd not to go to the Supper suppose the Supper was to come to you 'Tis great Pity such great Preparations as Mr  Sharp  has made should be thrown away  Sharp  So it is as you say Mrs  Kitty  But I can immediately run back and unbespeak what I have order'd 'tis soon done  Mel  But then what Excuse can I send to your Master He'll be very uneasy at my not coming  Sharp  Oh terribly sobut I have itI'll tell him you are very much out of Orderthat you were suddenly taken with the Vapours or Qualms or what you please Madam  Mel  I'll leave it to you  Sharp  to make my Apology and there's half a Guinea for you to help your Invention  Sharp  Half a Guinea'Tis so long since I had any thing to do with Money that I scarcely know the current

none  Kitty  Madam  Mel  I see thro' your little mean Artifice you are endeavouring to lessen Mr  Gayless  in my Opinion because he has not paid you for Services he had no Occasion for  Kitty  Pay me Madam I am sure I have very little Occasion to be angry with Mr  Gayless  for not paying me when I believe 'tis his general Practice  Mel  'Tis false He's a Gentleman and a Man of Honour and you are  Kitty  Not in Love I thank Heaven    curtseying    Mel  You are a Fool  Kitty  I have been in Love but I am much wiser now  Mel  Hold your Tongue Impertinence  Kitty  That's the severest Thing she has

and so they become our Advisers  Sharp  's Behaviour tho' I seem'd to disregard it makes me tremble with Apprehensions and tho' I have pretended to be angry with  Kitty  for her Advice I think it of too much Consequence to be neglected  Enter  Kitty  Kitty  May I speak Madam  Mel  Don't be a Fool What do you want  Kitty  There is a Servant just come out of the Country says he belongs to Sir  William Gayless  and has got a Letter for you from his Master upon very urgent Business  Mel  Sir  William Gayless  What can this mean Where is the Man  Kitty  In the Little Parlour Madam  Mel  I'll

Sharp  Hast thou really succeeded  Sharp  To our Wishes Sir In short I have managed the Business with such Skill and Dexterity that neither your Circumstances nor my Veracity are suspected  Gay  But how hast thou excused me from the Ball and Entertainment  Sharp  Beyond Expectation SirBut in that particular I was obliged to have recourse to Truth and declare the real Situation of your Affairs I told her we had so long disused our selves to dressing either Dinners or Suppers that I was afraid we should be but aukward in our Preparations In short Sirat that instant a cursed Gnawing seized my Stomach that I could not help telling her that both you and myself seldom make a good Meal nowadays once in a Quarter of a Year  Gay  Hell and Confusion have you betrayed me Villain Did not you tell me this Moment  she did not in the least suspect my Circumstances  Sharp  No more she did Sir till I told her  Gay  Very well and was this your Skill and Dexterity  Sharp  I was going to tell you but you won't hear Reason my melancholy Face and piteous Narration had such an Effect upon her generous Bowels that she freely forgives all that's past  Gay  Does she  Sharp  Sharp  Yes and desires never

my Negociations  when even you who know me so well can't help swallowing my Hook Why Sir I could have play'd with you backwards and forwards at the End of my Line till I had put your Senses into such a Fermentation that you should not have known in an Hour's Time whether you was a Fish or a Man  Gay  Why what is all this you have been telling me  Sharp  A downright Lye from Beginning to End  Gay  And have you really excused me to her  Sharp  No Sir but I have got this Half Guinea to make her Excuses to you and instead of a Confederacy between you and me to deceive her she thinks she has brought me over to put the Deceit upon you  Gay  Thou excellent Fellow  Sharp  Don't lose Time but slip out of the House immediately the Backway I believe will be the safest for you and to her as fast as you can pretend vast Surprize and Concern that her Indisposition has debarr'd you the Pleasure of her Company here to Night You need know no more away  Gay  But what shall we do  Sharp  Here's her
