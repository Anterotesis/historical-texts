point my dedication  Kindly vouchsaf'd to recommend  Her warmest patron ablest friend  Who with more skill than WarwickLane  Pale spleen can cure i' th'comic vein  Then Sir receive this hasty birth  A slight attempt at harmless mirth  Which dares not hope much critic praise  Conceiv'd and born within eight days  Your smiles much credit must reflect  On him who signs with just respect  The AUTHOR  SCRUB'S TRIP TO THE JUBILEE SPOKEN BY MR WESTON  FROM Stratford arriv'dpiping hotgentle folks  From the rarest fine shows and most wonderful jokes  Your simple acquaintance Scrub comes to declare  'Twas fuller by far than our Litchfield great fair  Such crouds of fine ladies serenading and singing  Such firing of loud pateraroes and ringing  To tell it in London must seem all a fable  And yet I will tell it as well as I'm able  First something in linguo of schools call'd an ode  All critics they told me allow'd very good  One saidyou may take it for truth I assure ye  'Twas made by the little great man of old Drury  By my brother Martinfor whose sake d'ye hear  This night I'd a mind for a touch at Shakespeare  This alludes to Mr Weston's intention of playing Richard    But honestly speaking I take more delight in  A bit of good fun than drums trumpets and fighting  The Procession 'twas said would have been a fine train  But could not move forwardsoh la for the rain  Such tragical comical folks and so fine  What pity it was that the sun did not shine  Since ladies and baronets aldermen squires  All went to this Jubilee full of desires  In crouds as they go for to see a new play  And when it was donewhy they all came away  Don't let me forgeta main part of the show  Was long tailed fine comets by fam'd Angelo  Some turtle I got which they call'd pashapee  But honest roast beef's the best turtle for me  I hate all ragouts and like a bold Briton  Prefer good plumb pudding to ought I e'er bit on  I drank tooand now I a poet may be  From a charming fine cup of the mulberry tree  To bed I must gofor which like a ninny  I paidlike my bettersno less than a guinea  For rollingnot sleepingin linen so damp  As struck my great toe ever since with the cramp  Thus fleec'din my pocket I felt a great smarting  Yet griev'd not when I and the splinters were parting  'Twas worth ten times more to hear sweet brother Martin  He spoke till poor Scrub was just fit with one eye  To laugh while the other was ready to cry  Which makes me now tell you without any brag  He's second to none but the Warwickshire wag  The Jubilee over I come to this place  To tell you my story and sue for your grace  You never refus'd ityet never before  With granting such kindness bound gratitude more  I love but to own with a diligent spirit  Your favours have ever outrun my slight merit  The reader will easily perceive that this Prologue is merely occasional  To the PUBLIC  THE Author thinks it incumbent upon him to observe that the following Occasional Piece was imagined and put into its present State within the Space of a very few Days and has some Reason to believe that it would have been presented at the Theatre Royal in the HayMarket if the Thought had been suggested in Time for Mr FOOTE's Season Some kind and perhaps partial Friends having urged the Publication it thus steps into Life with  many Imperfections on its Head  yet not the Author flatters himself without some degree of Merit to Apologize for submitting it to Public Perusal  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Lord Spangle  Sir John Hearty  Sir Charles Planwell  Scrapeall  Captain Blarney  Pasquin  Toby

John  Sir John  From paying any thing you meanrot the money old boy what was it made for but circulation why you have more of it than you can count and yet take as little enjoyment of life as if you

man live according to his station and circumstancesnot disgrace and starve himself for the sake of hoarding rascally pelftherefore now I have got you out of the smoke of London you shall bleed a

plaistered with flour which I suppose we must pay forAh no wonder money is scarce and provisions dear when such a fellow as this wastes on his empty noddle what would make a twopenny cake  Sir John  At it againthe same dull theme overagainOons so much of it is worse than a methodist sermon an hour long or a scolding wife when a man has got the headachTake a glass of Lethe to the forgetfulness of care old cent per cent and live for this evening at least  Scrap  Lethepray how much is that a bottle  Sir John  A bottleha ha hastep into the other world and you may have hogshead's for nothingBut

Scrap  I hate plays  Sir John  Now I like themThere's Whittington and his catCaptain BatemanPunch in the suds and two or three more make me laugh by the hourand so because this Shakespeare wrote such things the corporation meet to get drunk for joyJolly dogs I warrant then  Long  Corporationwhat Sir do you thinka dozen French cooks and fifty of the smartest waiters London can produce would come to accommodate a pitiful country corporationNo no gentlemen all the world will be here  Sir John  The Devil it will  Long  True upon my honourI'll engage you might fire cannon from the Royal Exchange to St James's to morrow without killing any thing but hackneycoachmen or applewomenLondon will be quite emptyentirely populated  Scrap  You lieyou lie scape grace ChangeAlley won't be empty and that's the best part of LondonA very fine thing indeed if East India stock South Sea three per cents consols and lottery tickets were left for Jubilee which as I have heard is a rank piece of popery Sir John  Sir John  Popery adso if that's the case it's time for me to look aboutI'll call a Bench upon itI'llbut I am not of the peace for this county however at our quarter sessions I can move for a petition against such things  Long  Lackaday gentlemen you need not be so angryDo you think if there was any religion in the matter so many persons of fashion and quality would be concerned with it  Sir John  Well said boy I think there's no great danger  Long  Quite innocent and polite I assure you Sir if you want a description I can sing you a new song just made upon the occasion  Sir John  With all my heart honestyHere wet the way first  Drinks  SONG  'Tis Shakespeare invitesto his Jubilee haste  All you who profess either spirit or taste  Young and old come away  Be frolic be gay  And let your old bard with due honour be grac'd  Lo the call is obey'dsee see they approach  From nimble tim whisky to the lumb'ring old coach  Full bent one and all  On the Jubilee ball  Which even Diogenes could not reproach  Miss Tripsy expecting that Stratford will prove  A delicate region of pleasure and love  Puts on her best face  Adorn'd with each grace  As ready to bill and to coo as a dove  To the market old dowagers also repair  With borrowed complexions teeth eyebrows and hair  Each wooes with her purse  For better for worse  The female that's wealthy must surely be fair  Kept mistresses too and galant modish wives  Whom I join as devoted to similar lives  Set out on the jaunt  To ogle and flaunt  Who who can resist it when dear fashion drives  Smart beaux whom stern cynics call rational apes  Haste hither to shew their fine cloaths and fine shapes  They know  Shakespeare's  name  And have heard of his fame  Though his merit their shallow conception escapes  Some authors some critics some actors advance  Gay fidlers of Rome and trim barbers of France  Lords ladies and squires  Confess strong desires  To join the gay round of our Jubilee dance  Would any one miss then this great Jubilee  Where so much you may hear and so much you may see  Since in approbation  The wise corporation  Will give each a slip of the mulberry tree  Scrapeall  A mighty hopeful description I must confess  Sir John  Ay ay the song's well enough but there's a blind fiddler that plays at my house who sings three times as loud he rattles away old Roger the hunting of the Fox Bumper squire Jones and Roast Beef till he makes my great hall ring againBody o'me it would do any body good to hear him  Scrapeall  Ah sir John there's nothing better than old songsbut old gold  Sir John  Well friend you must order us a couple of beds with well aired sheets and we'll think of somewhat for supper presently  Longcork  Supper you may have gentlemen from five shillings to five guineas but as to a bed in this house you could not have one for any sum  Sir John  Not a bedhow so fellow  Long  Lord sir they have been all bespoke these sixweeks would you believe it lord Blazingstar has engaged the roost of one of our chambermaids four story high and lady Betty Soylainet is obliged to content herself with an ostler's apartment over the stables  Sir John  Very pretty accommodation trulylook ye firrah beds we must and will have  Scrape  Ay or we'll stop them out of the bill  Long  Must and will haveSo you may gentlemen if you can get themLet me seeI would oblige you if I couldthere is an alderman of the town who has one bed disengaged and I believe you may have it three nights for five guineas  Scrape  Five guineas coxcombI had rather pass three nights in purgatory what do you think we coin or find our money Scapegrace Jubilee quotha give it the right name the High Season at Bath where the Extravagants  eat  silver  Sir John  Hold they shan't rob us old Truepennywe'll prime our noddles and when they can hold up no longer e'en take a nap in our chairs so there's bite the biterThe devil's in it if Yorkshire and Changealley can't be a match for Stratford upon Avon at any time  Scrapeall  Why that is true yet I wish we had gone the other road and missed this confounded JubileeEgad there is an excellent thought come into my head cousin I'll go inquire if any body deals in Lottery Tickets and if I meet with a chap it shall go hard if I do not tickle his soft side out of as much as will pay our thievish expences  Sir John  Well said old Twoandgothree in the mean time I will remove to the garden for air here Jack Tom Jonathan what is your name carry the remains of that bottle into an arbour or summer house and I will follow you  Long  This way this way Sirwhat a couple of bears they are  Aside  Sir John  Success old Mainchance  Scrap  Ah somebody had need mind the main chance or else your Jubilee folks would soon turn the world topsy turvy  Exeunt  Enter  Lord Spangle  and  Toupee  L Spang  So at length we have gained this occasional seat of mimic eleganceHow long have we been coming the last fifty miles  Toupee  Exactly four hours ten minutes and thirtyfire seconds by my stop watch my lord  L Spangle  Pretty tolerable drivingthough the minutes and seconds were quite unnecessaryDon't you think I may lay the odds upon doing it under three and a half  Toupee  Most certainly my lord with relays of your nag tailed bays the full tailed blacks and the switched roans  L Spangle  Mum thensay no morenow must I lay myself out for one of Moore's flying Phaetons without horses and then brother knowing ones have at yeRing the bell Toupee order my baggage to the lodgings and afterwards attend me here  Exit  Toupee  Enter  Longcork  Long  Did you call Siroh my lordI beg your lordship ten thousand pardons  L Spangle  Lord prithee fellow hast thou ever seen me before or dost thou read nobility in my face  Long  Ah my lord many a half crown have I touched of your money  L Spangle  Ay my glass to recognize this old acquaintanceWhat Longcork from the Piazzas  Long  The very fame and entirely at your lordship's service  L Spangle  Thou hast been serviceable in the affairs of love and may'st be so againAny of the game expected here  Long  Great plenty my lord of practised ladies for country gentlemen and I make no doubt but there will be rare poaching for experienced sportsmen among unflush'd game we shipped off from Bowstreet and the garden three waggon loads last weekFortyfive as we call Bet Tawdry is to pass here for a baronet's daughterSall Bottlenose for a young clergyman's widow Suky Trapes for a country girl and Peggy Nimwell all your lordship's acquaintancesfor an EastIndia captain's lady  L Spangle  Excellentthe game hunted down by us gallants of fashion do well enough for mistresses or even wives for fellows in this part of the world but have you fixed your eye on nothing fresh yet Longcork no soft blooming languishing fair on whom a few soft words a few promises with a silk gown or two could prevail point out such a one and ten goldfinches in one cage shall chirp a most engaging piece of music to reward thee  Long  I am bound to you my lord and shall have a sharp look out  L Spangle  But snug let it be for the impertinent hungry news writers do so search out and bastinado the modish failings of nobility that a peer can not debauch his neighbour's wife or daughter with any safety and hypocrisy is become almost as essential to us as to a Moorfields preacher  Long  Insolent villains their pens should be crammed down their throats I shall be as secret as a freemason my lordnot even a sign shall blab  L Spangle  Enough nature designed thee for a successful minister of intrigues and in due time I'll recommend thee to a snug place in the customsMen of merit should be rewarded  Long  I thank your lordship but I would not give up my present perquisites to be any thing under a comptroller besides I can only just scrawl my name  L Spangle  That's hardthen thou art fit for nothing but a commissionerHey day either my glass deceives me or that spirited fairone lady Spanker approaches'tis see faith  Enter  Lady Spanker  What no people of fashion yetno real Jubileeoh my lord Spangle your presence has relieved me from the deplorable apprehensions that I was the only person of condition arrived  L Spangle  Your ladyship's most obedient Stratford has on Shakespeare's account been always admitted the region of poetry bur enlightened by lady Spanker's presence it shines forth the hemisphere of beauty  L Spanker  Politely flattering I confess my lord bur perhaps at present I am flushed with a little accidental beauty for about half an hour since as I was driving my phaeton and four at the rate of fourteen miles an hour an odious chimney sweeper's savage ass set up his horrid bray started my cream colours turned them out of the road and tipped me headforemost into a ditch  L Spang  Alarming chance both the two legged and the four legged ass should have been sacrificed to your hardship's perilous situation I am determined to bring in an act next sessions to prevent any such animals from appearing by daylight  L Spank  Why indeed my lord it is a pity that creatures who have no adequate idea of quality should exist at allI will request my uncle sir Toby  Hubblebubble to support your patriotic motionHas your lordship any thing at Newmarket for the next meeting  L Spang  Nothing madammy roan by Regulus broke down in a trial sweat last week and must forfeit two hundredmy grey filly has put out a spavin and my bay by Sampson has slipped a shoulder  L Spank  Quite unfortunate I am matched against captain Clumsy a three mile heat which I expect to win hollow for you know he rides like a woolpack  L Spang  True madamha ha ha  L Spank  I have a match depending also with lord Scapegrace for five hundred a side on leaping five barred gatesbets run pretty even  L Spang  I will back your ladyship in bothsix to four for any sum  L Spank  That is encouragement howeverand I have been in close training these six weeksdo not you think my lord the Sampsons have shewn more bottom than Foot of latelittle Gimcrack he is the star of the turf I would freely give two thousand for him then as a groom theres Singleton beats the globe I hope when he dies for he must fall as well as Alexander Marlborough and other great men I hope there will be a Jubilee of commemoration appointed for him at NewmarketI am sure he deserves it much better than the old musty scribbler Shakespeare so fine a finger so steady a hand so firm a seat in short he rides so well that if the fellow had but genteel blood in his veins I think no lady could refuse him for a husband  L Spang  Your ladyship's approbation does his merit singular honour and the preference given against Shakespeare is most happily Judicious no critic of  any delicacy can bear the fellow's hum drum pieces now  L Spank  Quite intolerableThough if some of them were turned into singing affairs they might be endured well enough the opera of Hamlet the opera of Othello the opera of Richard in short the opera of ever thing to banish that antiquated barbarous word TragedyBut my Lord have you fixed upon your character for the masquerade yet  L Spang  Not yet madam if your Ladyship as in real life will personate Venus I must consequently attempt the character of Adonis  L Spank  Infinitely polite but my choice rather bends to the Queen of the Amazons  L Spang  Then madam you will metamorphose me into Alexander who was her admirer  L Spank  Well since I find there is no escape from your excessive gallantry it shall be sothat valuable creature Mr Pasquin the habitman from TavistockStreet is to be here with at infinite variety if it is agreeable to your lordship we will have a view  L Spang  It is happiness to attend Lady Spanker any where  L Spank  Then we will step first to the stable give some directions about my cream colours and proceed immediately  Exeunt  Enter  Emmeline  and  Jackonet  Emmel  Well I vow Jackonet this flying from place to place is pure What would my old papa say now if he knew that I was come to the Jubilee  Jack  Say why the same that all such old cuffs as he would say upon the same occasion that you was a wild madheaded girl that you was a flaunting  baggage that you did not know the pains required to get money nor the value of it when got that your head runs upon whirligigs and that you think of nothing but plays assemblies fine cloaths and fine sweethearts  Emmel  Ha ha ha well I vow you take him off to a hair if it was not for my aunt Fiddlededee I should have known no circumstance of polite life I should have been fit for nothing but mending stockings and making pies if it was not for her I should not have you to wait on me JackonetHe would have brought me up just such an unfashionable creature as himself but nature has given me spirit and my aunt has given me taste so I am resolved not to be shut up in the horrid smoke of Watling street any longer  Jack  You are perfectly in the right of it madam get yourself tranlplanted to Grosvenor Berkley or Cavendish Square as soon as possible set up a visavis bespeak an elegant sedan of four hundred guineas price hire two of the handsomest chairmen and six of the genteelest footmen than can be found with every other article of a grand household keep visiting days routs c and shine forth an ornament of the gay world  Emmel  Ravishing pictureWhat an unreasonable mortal is this Papa of mine to think I would give up such a round of delights for that hateful creature Omnium the change broker and his country house at Islington Did I ever sing you a song I made upon being plagued to have him Jackonet  Jack  Not that I recollect madam  Emmel  Then you shall have it  SONG  How cruel Papa to insist upon that  Which nature must always deny  How can you resist a denial so flat  Before you shall force me I'll die  'Tis base in the tonge to proclaim a fair show  When fill'd with abhorrence the heart cries out no  Love only shall ever dispose of my hand  Love only shall make me a wife  No parent has justly a right to command  To command away comfort for life  My Tongue then shall never proclaim a fair show  When filled with abhorrence my heart cries out no  Jack  A good resolution and well expressed madam I recollect a short ballad much to the same purpose I'll endeavour to give it you as well as I can  Emmel  I long to hear it of all things  Jackonet  SONG  The subject of marriage  So oft meets miscarriage  'Tis ticklish for maidens to try  Gallants in this matter  So oft lie and flatter  We scarce can tell how to comply  Since seeking a blessing we oft meet a curse  When blushing we answer for better for worse  Should parents presuming  Like tyrants assuming  Unkindly forbid a free choice  The girl who has spirit  Will freedom inherit  By list'ning to nature's kind voice  If I am to be wretched I'll chuse my own curse  And the man of my heart take for better for worse  Emmel  Admirable Jackonet you shall be first lady of my bedchamber and shall have my wedding cloathsSir Charles promised to meet me here this evening and when the enchanting Jubilee is over we shall fly for Scotland immediately  Jack  A charming convenient country that for matrimonial affairs madamheigh hoI wish I was taking a trip there with one I know upon the same occasionThe invitation which carried your father into Yorkshire at this critical time was very fortunate  Emmel  The luckiest thing in the world the very name of a Jubilee would have frightened him out of his sensesBut Jackonetwhat would you have me get for the masquerade  Jack  Lard madam there is such a variety that it is almost impossible to advise When I lived with lady Bab Rattle she employed six hours a day for three months and could scarce fix upon any thing at lastone day she would be a Turk the next a Christian the third a Chinese the fourth a Dutch woman next a Heathen Goddess then a Savoyard soon after a gipsy a witch and twenty othersat last she thought of transforming herself into a moving beehive intimating that beauty is pregnant with the stings of lovebut alas upon entering the ballroom she saw two other beehives dancing a cotilion with the sun the moon a bear an ostrich Hamlet's ghost and an animated buttercaskThis had such an effect upon her that she retired immediately and almost fretted herself into a consumption  Emmel  Poor lady such terrible shocks must hurt any constitution I have cause enough myself but a  good heart and pleasing hopes bear me upI would have a dress odd and whimsicalI'll make a bargain with you Jackonet you shall chuse for me and I'll chuse for you  Jack  As you please madamBless me yonder's one of Sir Charles's men come post haste into the yardhis master must be near at hand  Emmel  Oh dear I am so tumbled and tossed with the journeymy head is in such terrible disorderI can't see Sir Charles in this pickle positively  Jack  If you please madam I'll call the chambermaid to shew a private room and put you to rights in a quarter of an hour you shall look so killingly that the baronet's impatience for Scotland shall make him think the Jubilee seven years long  Emmel  Come then dear Jackonetdo make me look very killingly and every silk sack and petticoat I have at present shall be your's when we return from Scotland  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT THE SECOND  SCENE THE FIRST  Sir  JOHN HEART  and  SCRAPEALL  Sir  JOHN  WHAT no lottery

dabbles a little that way whether he wanted any ticketshe answeredShakespeare is to be crowned tomorrow and his wife before I could open my mouth again said there was to be a masquerade tomorrow which everybody would be atFor my part I think they are all Shakespearemad and I wish we were fairly out of the town  Sir  JOHN  Body o'me why so Can't people be merry and wiseFor my own part I should like to stay and see the funay and we will old TruepennyWhen it is over I'll take you to such gardens groves and purling streams in Yorkshire as shall make you young again  SCRAPEALL  With your leave Sir John I had rather go back to LondonPray where can you find a garden of equal value to that of Covent GardenWhere can you match the golden grove of Lombard streetWhere meet more delightful retreats than the arbours of the AlleyWhere more comfortable walks than those of the Exchange or a stream equal to the Thames between Bridge and Deptford Besides I am very uneasy about my girl she's at the ticklish age of nineteen has twenty thousand pounds at her own disposal when of age besides the inheritance of all my estate  Sir  JOHN  What then friend touch and take ten to one do all you can she'll please herself at last and throw herself away upon some povertystruck lord who being out at the elbows will marry her money to mend bad circumstances then keep a mistress to please his inclinations  SCRAPEALL  I am no friend to popery yet I wish we had nunneries amongst us to lock up headstrong young hussiesAh why had not I a son by this time he might have been thoroughly educated in those schools of useful knowledge Lloyd's and Jonathan'sI might have lived to see him double my fortune  Sir  JOHN  Why then old boy since you can't be sure who will get it or how it may go take my advice and  regale yourself with a little of it before you are shipped off for the other worldNow I am here I'm resolved to see what sort of an affair this jubilee isthough I suppose it won't be half so good as a country feast or a fox chace  SCRAPEALL  No nor half so fine as my Lord Mayor's show which may be seen for nothing into the bargain  Sir  JOHN  Nothing prithee don't grumble so in the gizzardit is my humour to see what all this bustle's about and if you'll promise to throw off your melancholy face body o'me I'll bring you off scot freeI'll pay for both I have three hundred pounds a quarter and don't wish to save a shilling of it  SCRAPEALL  As you please Sir JohnWhat a prodigal old fool it is  Aside  Sir  JOHN  Besides man I never saw a coronation in my life and for aught I know the crowning of king Shakespeare may be as pretty a piece of diversion as the crowning of any other kingso brush up your phiz and we'll sally forth to see what's stirring  SCRAPEALL  I follow Sir JohnI wish I knew how EastIndia stock was done today and what news there is from the Nabobs  Exeunt  SCENE II  A Masquerade Shop  PASQUIN  and  SLEEKEM  PASQUIN  Well if every freedom presented in a mulberrybox was to produce a masquerade I could wish all the authors actors and critics in England were made burgesses of StratfordI shall love the name of Shakespeare as long as I live What a delightful bustle does this jubilee make so many country 'squires and their ladies who know nothing of the matter apply for dresses that we can fleece them genteellybut what of that they in return will rack their tenants and the tenants consequently raise provisions so that upon the whole nobody is affected but the low mechanical vulgar whom nature has formed as mere necessary utensils for the sport and profit of us in polite spheres of life  SLEEKEM  Why Sir this promises fair to beat the royal masquerade  PASQUIN  Most certainlywe had too many of the knowing ones therehere we shall have
