 HANNIBAL  at the Gates OR THE PROGRESS OF  Iacobitism  WITH THE Present Danger OF THE  PRETENDER    Pene occupatam Seditionibus  Delevit Urbem  Dacus    Aethiops    Hor  LONDON  Printed for  J Baker  at the  BlackBoy  in  Pater NosterRow  Price  d  HANNIBAL  at the Gates OR THE PROGRESS OF Jacobitism  c  _How near the Brink of Ruin we have stood and how often we have been rescu'd from impending Dangers by the very Finger of Providence the desperate Struggles that have been made for Liberty thro' the several Stages of the last Century are sufficient Indications Yet no sooner has the Tempest abated and the Horrour of the Scene cool'd upon our Minds but as if we were fond of making  Fatal Experiments some restless and implacable Spirits have troubled the Air afresh and thrown us into the same hazardous Circumstances again And what makes our Case the more deplorable is that the same stale Artifices by which the people have been so often deluded are without the least Colouring or Varnish trump'd up Successfully at every turn when either the Ambition or Necessities of a few pernicious Instruments are to be serv'd A due Reflection upon the Easiness and Credulity of this Nation has made me often Pronounce us the most unthinking Animals in Nature and even below the sylliest Species of the whole Field who are never caught twice in that Snare they have been once intangl'd in It's really amazing that in a Constitution so well guarded and where People daily feast upon the Blessings of Liberty that the Byass should run so strong to  Slavery  especially when the open and avow'd Enemies of Freedom and the  Protestant Interest  lye within so small a Grasp but then if we throw the Insensibility of some the Indolence of others the Obstinacy of a third and in fine the Ductile Temper of the Generality tho' in most respects firm to the Essentials of our Constitution into the Scale with those few but watchful Agents  the wonder will soon abate It was the Glory of Former Ages to have been always Furnish'd with a Set of bold and uncorrupted Patriots who upon the least Approach of Danger spoke their Sentiments freely and took all the Legal Precautions to secure themselves against a Domineering Faction Even after the Restoration of  Charles  the Second when so strong an Acclivity to  Arbitrary Power  run thro' the whole Nation and the People were so perfectly tir'd out with the many Fantastick Schemes of a false Liberty that the true Notion of  Legal Right  was in a manner turn'd into Ridicule Even at that time there was not wanting a set of Brave and Honest Men of unblemish'd Loyalty who Check'd the forward Humour of the Populace and restrain'd them from making an absolute Surrender of their Liberties The many Enchroachments that were made in that Reign notwithstanding all the Precautions taken by some Good Men in Power plainly shows what an easy Prey we had fallen to Tyranny if they had not timely oppos'd the Torrent and tho' that Healing Parliament which sat for so many Years after the King's Return gave into the Imperious Measures of the Court so long that they had scarce any thing left to make a free Gift of least  they should be thought to give so much as an Umbrage to Popular Complaints yet the warm Expostulations they were forc'd to at last explain to us their Modest Sense of the Grievances afoot But Despotick Sway still increasing and Tyranny ripening by their Neglect the Parliament of Eighty began to search deep into the Wounds the State had receiv'd and finding so many  Siuus  's on every hand where the Malignity had spread Resolv'd to lay all open  The Mists which had hover'd so long about the Eyes of the People clear'd up and the Nation began to see their Danger in a true Light and every Man silently reproach'd himself for being so prodigal of his Liberty They then had the Mortification to see a  Popish  Plot in a Manner stifled and only a few of the needy and lower Rank of Parricides brought with Difficulty to Justice Still the busy Part the Abettors of  Tyranny  and  Popery  acted in Diverting the Stream of the Evidence inspired the People with double Eagerness and Vivacity to put it in the right Channel and were in a fair Way of putting a Period to the Hopes of that accursed Faction  The Pulse of the Nation at that Juncture beat high for Liberty and during the high Ferment which so many wicked Attempts  upon Liberty and Religion had rais'd in the Breasts of the People the Necking Blow was just giving to  Popery  and  Slavery  had the prudent Foresight of the Commons in Preferring  The Bill of Exclusion  been seconded by the Approbation of the Upper House The unseasonable Indulgence at that Time granted to a Royal Branch thro' an Excess of Loyalty pav'd the Way to succeeding Miseries and there were not wanting a Set of Undertakers to give a wrong Turn to the Vigilance and bold Execution of that Trust repos'd in the Commons And such was the Instability of the People that in a short Process of Time the Vein of Liberty had spent itself and the Tide run so strong upward that there was no Possibility of Opposing it This brave Attempt of the Commons drew down an unexpiable Displeasure upon some of the chief Leaders in the Enterprize but it was their Glory to suffer in the justest Cause to be in the first Rank of Martyrs for the Laws and Liberties of their Country and their Ashes will be still Sacred to all in the true Interest of  Britain    In this State of Infatuation we continu'd till the Prophetick Fears of these gallant Patriots were accomplish'd in a  Popish  Succession  At length after a Thousand Violations of the Laws and desperate Pushes at the whole Body of the Constitution this poor deluded Nation were pleas'd to awake once more out of their long and lazy Dreams and seem'd by a lively Resentment of their former Credulity and ill Usage never to be impos'd on again The Scars which the short liv'd Rage of  Popery  and  Tyranny  had left behind were deeply imprinted on the Minds of the Nation and Men of the shallowest Speculations could tell you then that  Popery  under all the Oaths Restraints and Bridles that could be laid upon it was inconsistent either with Civil or Religious  Liberty  nay even the rankest Clergy who had made the Doctrine of  PassiveObedience  a Scaffold to their Preferments and coveted Dignities at the Price of their immortal Souls asham'd of Practising with the People any longer were so far from Enforcing this batter'd Topick that they rather put them upon the Defensive Part Then all Eyes crowded to their  Deliverer  and mutually congratulated each other upon this seasonable Rescue The Nation then plainly saw to what Extremities their foolish Quarrels and Distinctions had reduc'd them  Whigg  and  Tory High  and  Low  were unfashionable  Names lost in the prevailing Harmony of  English Liberty  and the  Protestant Interest Moderation  was then look'd upon as a laudable Quality and most People had seen so much of a Zeal contrary to Knowledge that they could not approve of Fury in any Dress The most  Orthodox Churchmen  profess'd a true  Primitive Unanimity  and coming to such a Temper with all that dissented from them as gave every sober Man a delightful Prospect from the first Opening of this happy Scene  Family Revenges handed down to Posterity thro' an Inveteracy of Principle and heighten'd by a warm Reflection upon the ill Offices done to each other in those  Bloody  and  Unnatural Wars  seem'd bury'd in Oblivion In short one Soul actuated the whole Nation and all prepar'd to be happy in good earnest Yet in those Days and I believe most People then thought them the happiest that ever befell  England  we happen'd all to be in the modern Phrase  Antimonarchical Republican Heterodox Creatures  or in a more concise way of Talking  Whiggs Detestable Whiggs  nay even the  Moderate Papists  and some of the first Class amongst the  NonJurors  Sir  Ed Sr  was  a  Whigg  when he sign'd the  Association  at  Exeter  tho' I am at a Loss to know what he was upon the Attainder of  Fk Hw  was certainly a  Whigg  when he accepted of the  Golden Key  tho' there was soom Room to charge his Principle betwixt that and the  Felonious Treaty  A certain Pr towards the  North  was a  Whigg  when he came to pay his Homage to King  William  and it's Pity such a Convert was lost thro' a Failure in some  Punctilio  's in his Reception Archbishop  Sft  was no less than a downright  Whigg  when he demanded the Keys of the  Tower  from  Skn    The Examples of this Kind are infinite and therefore let no Man be startled when I tell him that every  Tory  of Eminence has been a  Whigg  at a convenient Time tho' the Reproach is not convertible How the Complection of the Kingdom came to change and from this Unanimity against  Popery  and  Tyranny  the People split into different Interests and have all along serv'd the Enemies of our Country and Religion in the Quality of Auxiliaries is no great labour to rehearse  Tho' upon the Exit of King  James  the the whole Nation seem'd to Centre in one Perswasion and with a General voice proclaim'd  King  William  their Deliverer because the Majority run so strong on his side yet several Mischievous Passions lay brooding in Designing men till they saw how far the Opportunity might be improv'd to their respective Interests The Sticklers for a Regency dazzled with the Image of Royalty kept fair with the Times in hopes that if their Schemes succeeded they should be powerfully recommended by the Prince of  Orange  to the Guardianship of the Realm But that Project once blasted the Sense of the Deliverance soon cool'd in their Thoughts and a Disgust at the Establishment took place of it  Others overbearing themselves upon some slight Merit in the Proceeding Reign and who challeng'd their former Posts as their Right not finding their Expectations answer'd soon fell into Discontent and endeavour'd to Blacken the  Revolution    Another Body deeply involv'd in Guilt and whose Crimes in a less Merciful hand then King  William  's could not have been pass'd over with Impunity thought by double Application to merit a Pardon but once finding the danger past return'd to their former Violence and meditated fresh Mischief  A different Class who expected the Administration to be lodg'd in some peculiar Hands and all others excluded from Trust finding the Kings Favours extensive to good Men of all Perswasions soon forgot the amicable Temper they had boasted of whilst the Storm was threatening their  Liberties  and  Religion  and rang'd themselves with the other Malecontents  These fiery Tempers rendring themselves obnoxious to the State by the Violence of their Proceedings made Religion the Stalking Horse to their  Ambition  and  Revenge  From these Narrow and selfish Principles they form'd a Separate Body under the Character of  Rigid Churchmen  who made it their Business to oppose the  Moderate  in all their Undertakings for the good of the Publick and to show their mortal Aversion to any Offers from the other side went roundly into all Measures destructive of  Liberty  and the  Protestant Interest    With these Factious Spirits not a few of the Clergy joyn'd who after taking a Premeditate Oath of  Allegiance  to the Government cast about how to excuse themselves from Perjury and serve King  William  with an HalfFac'd Devotion by trumping up the Distinction of a King  De Jure  and  De Facto  This cursed Distinction gave Rise to all the after Plots and Violences design'd upon his Royal Person and how they will be able to acquit themselves from the Blood of those poor mistaken Wretches who dy'd for the Intended Assassination must be left as one of their own Black Prophets Magisterially concludes to an Higher Tribunal  From these various Impulses personal Disgusts and Miscarriage of vain Hopes the first Seeds of Contention sprung which being Cherish'd by too indulgent Beams from the Throne grew up to Rankness and diffus'd their Suckers thro' the whole Land Had a few of the Wildest been cut down in time before they had gather'd such an Head or been Debarr'd of the Vital Nourishment of State Places and Preferments we had not at this time been plagu'd with their baneful Influences But the Settlement was then in its Infancy and Clemency being one of the King's chiefest Attributes the Malignity instead of being Cur'd by gentle Applications grew Epidemical when all these Humours were afloat GoodNature Humanity Religion and a Sense of Liberty were born down by the several gusts of Passion and Revenge  The Days of their ancient Slavery were magnify'd and the memorable Redemption in Eighty Eight was laid in the Dust But when no Blemish could be fix'd upon the Administration they brought out their  Old Idol  the  Church  Bleeding and in a desperate Condition and giving out that  Presbytery  was coming in like a Torrent tho' the  Ecclesiastical  Promotions were under the Direction of those very Prelates who had equally signaliz'd themselves against  Popery  and  Presbytery  It would puzzle a Man of the nicest Penetration to account for the Actions of these Madmen Nay even when the Game was entirely in their own Hands they suspected foul Play and murmur'd at the  Legal Indulgences  which others thought themselves sufficiently happy in Of so Usurping a Nature is this  ToryMonster  that nothing but a Monopoly of Wealth Favour and Interest can glut his ravenous Appetite The Pride and Oppression that is intermix'd with the Blood and Spirits of this destructive Race stifles all Acts of Benevolence in them and makes them by Sympathy love  Popery  and  Tyranny  for the sake of Persecuting in their subordinate Stations But to draw the Scene closer Tho' all these Sparks of Rancour and Malice  against the present Establishment glow'd warm in the Breasts of these restless Animals yet they had the Decency to smother them till the  Protestant  Succession in the Illustrious House of  Hanover  was fix'd by Parliament Then the Flame took Vent all their Passions blaz'd and every Tongue was set on Fire  Before that Time a  Jacobite  was of no great Importance in the Eye of the People he had a Mark set upon him and shunn'd by all who had the Welfare of their Country at Heart In all Publick Debates the Leading Men who favour'd that Party and were qualify'd by Law to do Mischief were very tender of Pointing out the Subject of their Grievances on this Side or the Object of their sincerest Wishes on the other Side of the Water It was a Point of too much Delicacy to be professedly handled and therefore the best Service they could do their Colleagues the  Jacobites  was by indirect Means remote Fetches and Thwarting the Publick Spirited Attempts of all true  Protestant Britons  Besides the Succession before that Act being precarious after the Demise of our present Queen if they could have commanded their Tempers to wait so long kept them up in flush Hopes that during  the Consternation they might have a fair Chance for Accomplishing their Wishes This notable Scheme of theirs was fully explain'd when they were brought to the  Test  of Voting For or Against the Clause in Favour of the  Hanover Succession  for maugre all their Attempts to stifle this Home Charge against them and the printed Vindication of the  Tory  Members from any Suggestion of that Kind the best Part of the Apology is altogether Sophistical and Evasive for tho' in Point of Logical Truth they did not divide upon the second Amendment sent down by the Lords in Order to strengthen the Interest of that August Family and upon which the chief Stress of the Debate lay yet the whole Management lay open to half an Eye  The prime Leaders Proposing to give as little Offence as might be upon so tender a Point went artificially to Work and try'd the Force of Numbers upon the first Amendment That being carry'd against them and being not of equal Importance with the second which made it Treason for any one to oppose that Succession after the Demise of the Queen they were afraid of Alaruming some of their own Party who were unwarily drawn into the  first Disagreement and therefore had no great Stomach to divide upon the second Amendment it not being usual for the weaker Side upon Losing a previous Question to divide upon a subsequent Clause intermix'd with the same Debate so that if may be without any Breach of Charity or Straining of Inferences from the whole Course of the Debate that they were against all the Amendments tho' they only divided upon the first If they had been sincere for the Interest of the  Hanover  Line why did they not readily come into all the Provisional Securities for the Safety of that Illustrious House Or rather why did they insist on the Danger of Multiplying Treasons and Aggravating the Inconveniencies that might arise from new Treason  c  It's plain from that Minute the  Pretender  was in open View If the first Act for Settling the Succession in the House of  Hanover  prompted them to curse that Legacy of King  William  this strengthening Act transported them beyond Measure and since that Time they have not labour'd to conceal their Sentiments It was a very fashionable Expression I remember at the Beginning of this Reign  viz Retrieving the Honour of the  English  Nation  What Honour had been  lost to the Nation we know at whose Doors to lay the Waste Indeed  Popery  and  Arbitrary Power  had been very much discountenanced in King  William  's Reign and every Man enjoy'd a compleat  English Liberty  so that the Meaning of that Phraze could signify nothing except Reviving the exploded Topick of Divine Tyranny of former Days and all the Slavish Positions under which the Nation agoniz'd for some Ages But they made their Court wrong and in the Reign of a Princess who from her first Accession to the Throne declar'd how much she had the Ease and Liberty of her People at Heart It was hop'd that under an Administration they so much long'd for these restless Spirits might have been compos'd and fallen into a true  English Interest  under the Influence of such an Example But three Years were scarce elaps'd when they revil'd the Person whom they formerly call'd their Stay and Support libelled a  Protestant Ministry  attack'd the Supremacy and rose to all the Outrage of Threats and ill Language Could an Enemy explain their Meaning to more Disadvantage than they themselves did upon these Occasions Was it not a plain Indication of the Interest they were engag'd  in They quarrel'd with King  William  for his overweaning Love to  Presbytery  they spoke disrespectfully of the present Queen for no other Reason but being too affectionate to the True Church Who then could be the Person in view that they thought would Support them better Or what Church was it they Complain'd was not Supported The Church of  England  during these Complaints was supply'd with Orthodox and Learned Prelates the Queen had been Beneficent to a Prodigy There was no Innovation so much as attempted but all Discipline enforc'd with as much Zeal as the Times would bear Well then it's plain they had always another Church than that of  England  and another Interest in view which they expected should support their Authority by Arbitrary Measures  This is what that Virulent Faction has always aim'd at and never can by their Principles be Cordial Subjects to any Prince who will not go the same desperate Lengths they chalk out And Let them Skin over their Resentments never so fair they cannot by their Complection accord with the true Genius of  England For they are either Rebels in Disgrace Or  too Arbitrary for the Constitution when once in Power  When we have abounded with such a Set of Men for many Ages past I wonder how the Constitution has been kept together and it still heightens my Surprize that these Principles  acuated  since the Revolution by Disgusts and confirm'd Antipathies have not left us a Prey to every bold Invader  Our Enemies wanted not Information how loose  they  have always sat to the Government for some Years even under the Restraint of a Triple Oath and that when their Passions boil High They stick at neither Honour Conscience or Bosom Friendship to satiate their Revenge But if any thing has contributed to our Preservation from  Popery  and  Slavery  it is that our Enemies could not depend upon that Party's being Constant to any one Principle so that their  Malice  has been render'd less Formidable by their Instability If this was not some sort of Security to us the many open and tacite Invitations that have been given to the PRETENDER would not have been neglected  As the Succession in the  Protestant Line  was the greatest Obstacle to their Dear  Minion  the  Pretender  's Intrusion so all  the hopes of that Party Centring in the little Practisings they were able to carry on in the Course of a single Life they were resolv'd to loose no Time in the Prosecution of their dire Attempt But because the Topick was a little too harsh for any man to support under any plausible Character they pitch'd upon one under Legal Disabilities to begin the Quarrel As that Piquering succeeded they resolv'd to manage the Combat Accordingly one spawn'd out of the vilest Bog in the whole Kingdom of  Ireland  was deputed to try the Force of his Arguments upon the Succession Whether he kept pace with his Master's Sentiments upon every head he was pleas'd to descant on we have no Warrant but it's plain that the subject Matter of the Paper was a continued Thread of  Treason    The  Usurpation  of King  William  was the least Concern in the Question His Reign and the pretended Calamities which had attended the Revolution were but only Incidents of the Tragedy that had been acted The  Queen  herself was Confess'd an  Usurper  and with this Salvo  That she did well to hold the Crown for her Life in order to deliver it to the Righteous Heir's Possession    This bold Charge pass'd with Impunity and even when it was offer'd to try the Validity of that pretended Trust in Opposition to the Claim of the Illustrious House of  Hanover  a good Witness is not wanting to prove that a First Minister of State in Being at that time turn'd cooly off from the Representation I shall not run over some aggravating Circumstances which impartially consider'd involv'd some people of pretended Merit in the same Guilt with the Author  These Trayterous Positions strengthen'd by Impunity daily gain'd ground upon weak Tempers and the Countenance vast Numbers of the Clergy gave to those Impious Reasons made People receive them with less Horrour And whenever any Perplexities happen'd to arise from a Point of that high and nice Nature they were so far from lessening them to the Interest of the present Establishment that they rather multiply'd Doubts still Concluding with an Eye to the  Pretender that Right would take Place at last  But least these Insinuations should fail of having a due Effect upon the People they exceeded all Common Measures of Impudence and would fain have perswaded the World that the Queen was Joining in a Plot against  herself her Crown and Dignity and covertly approv'd their Sentiments under the Notion of a secret and reveal'd Will  This tho' whisper'd here took freer Vent in a Neighbouring Kingdom and oblig'd one of the Ministers of State to oppose and condemn so Base and Treasonable a Suggestion in a Publick Speech It almost surpasses Belief that those very Men who had taken all the solemn Oaths the Prudence of the Nation could enact should break them and run into all the Excesses and desperate Notions of the most flagrant Papist or Nonjurer but as their Familiarity with Oaths had render'd them inconsiderable so when the Abjuration of the  Pretender  came to be taken they were so far from Hesitating about it that tho' there was no Room in the Oath left for Insincerity and few suspected Persons were thought capable of abiding so  strong a Test  they came into it readily with this  Jesuitical Salvo That the Abjuration of any Right the  Pretender  might lay Claim to was to be constru'd barely as Respecting his Legal Right but that his  Divine  or  BirthRight  was no ways vacated by that Oath    As it is impossible to guard against such horrid Distinctions by the most binding  Form of Words so this formal Renunciation of the  Pretender  's Right serv'd only to confirm those in their Zeal for his Service who made it with that saving Restriction This came to a full Proof when the first News of the  Pretender  's Expedition reach'd us One might then have read in the Countenances of these Men how much they were elated with the Prospect of that Enterprize One might then have heard them explain themselves without the least Reserve or Caution and congratulate each other upon their having prevaricated with the Government fo often for the Promotion of their  Good Old Cause    The  French  Court at that Time was so well inform'd of the Dispositions of these Men as not to doubt of Numbers who openly Pray'd and Acted for the Government appearing in Vindication of that  Abjur'd Right  The several Projects for Distressing the State were as faithfully as maliciously executed by Endeavouring to make a Bankrupty of the publick Chest whilst the Rampant Clergy were busy in Disarming the  Protestant Britons  by Preaching up  NonResistance  to their Rightful Prince in Opposition to their Legal one as may be charitably collected from  their notable Distinctions It was not want of Vigilance or Inactivity in the late  Loyal  and  Protestant Ministry  of happy Memory that made them retard the March of the Forces for the  North  but a prudent Foresight of the Distress which might have happen'd to this Part of the Government from Swarms of disguis'd Enemies There were too many upon the Signals given from the  NonResisting Leaders  prepar'd to  Resist  according to their Sense of the Doctrine and upon the first Sound of the Trumpet in  Sion  ready to mount But their Hopes being defeated by the precipitate Flight of the  Pretender  it was no difficult Matter to guess how they would have acted upon a nearer Approach of Danger by their subsequent Behaviour For when all the  Resistance  was past which they had conjur'd up the Pulpits without any manner of Call or Provocation from the Necessity of our Affairs sounded to Arms afresh in their ironical  NonResisting Cant  which amongst that Class of Men is the usual Watchword for Rebellion It's more than probable that the Heads of the Faction were in Hopes of a second Invasion and understood the first only as a Faint to try the Power of their Friends and so were  still Practising with the People upon the old Topick to keep up the Principle warm upon their Imaginations  When no Hopes appear'd from that Quarter their next Attempt was made at Home and flattering themselves with a Majority of the Nation on their Side they essay'd to do the Work amongst themselves without the Help of any Auxiliaries from Abroad  Accordingly they pitch'd upon one of the most  Common  PROSTITUTES of Vertue and Modesty in the three Kingdoms whose Memory will always be Sacred with the Admirers of  Cain Herostratus  and  Guido Faux  to raise Sedition upon the old  Passive  Topick Matters in their Opinion were so ripe that it was thought Loss of Time to conceal their impious Designs upon the Constitution so that in plain Terms this Partizan was appointed to fall directly upon the Government defame the Administration and blacken the  Revolution  with all the gallant Leaders concern'd in so  Just  and  Evangelical  a Work Then the true Intent and Purport of this Mysterious Doctrine was obvious to every  Protestant  when all the Arrows out of that Poysonous Quiver were levelled at the Queen  who had so great an Hand in that blessed Change Yet the Faction with their usual Impudence would have fasten'd Contradictions upon the World and made us believe that the Resistance the Queen abetted at that Time by her Gracious and useful Presence was fatal to her Title in its Consequences when that Case was urg'd with an Exception to the general Rule of  PassiveObedience  and never to be so much as attempted but in the last necessitous Circumstances even no less than the entire Subversion of the Constitution But it's plain the unlimited Obedience there press'd could never be design'd to the present Queen her Title arising out of the  Revolution  which was founded in Resistance neither could it be any Complement to lodge such a Power with her as she was never fond of she Governing herself and Subjects by the Laws of the Constitution But the  Pretender  being in view the Model of his Government was laid down and recommended in that  Arbitrary  way he might be suppos'd to act and by the Tenour of the Libel even her Majesty was as much caution'd against Resisting the Lawful and Rightful Heir as any of her Subjects  Still whatever malignant Planet rul'd  this impudent Prevarication met with Votaries and what in sober Times would have cover'd such a Parricide with eternal Shame and Ignominy gave him a larger Degree of Sufficiency than before and turn'd to his Glory amongst the poor deluded Rabble  This Vein of  Slavery  and  Jacobitism  increasing after the  merciful Award  the Faction still kept feeding the popular Humours till at last they were neither afraid nor asham'd to tell the World that they could not be satisfy'd with any Title below the degree of  Indefeasible  and  Divine Right  These Terms which were almost grown obsolete were renew'd and cramm'd into many publick Addresses I shall pass over the dubious Expressions and plain Hints which to every narrow Capacity seem obvious enough In some Papers we find such an uncontroulable Power devolv'd upon the Crown which tho' our Gracious Queen never show'd the least Disposition towards Assuming sufficiently explains into what Hands the Faction is willing it should fall But amongst all the late Demonstrations of ardent Affection to the Queen and present Establishment it's a little shocking that some have been so hardy to approach her Majesty without so much as the least Notice  of the  Protestant  Succession in the Serene House of  Hanover  which the Queen has upon all Occasions profess'd she has so much at Heart If those Persons were sincere in their Wishes for the Perpetuity of the  Protestant Religion  and  Liberty  in these Kingdoms a small Clause in Favour of that House could not well be omitted on a Subject which so naturally leads to it Indeed SMUT the  Examiner  who has commenc'd Guide to some inferiour Communities has given in his Verdict very learnedly upon this Head and looks upon the Mention of that August House as Writing a sort of Epitaph upon the Person in Possession But under Favour I think that may be fil'd amongst the rest of his Blunders For certainly no Repetition of that kind can be ungrateful to a Person whose chiefest Glory it is to lodge so sacred a Pledge in the Hands of a Family that will be sure to deliver it down pure and uncorrupted to Posterity  As her Majesty is the Parent of her Country and indeed the Nursing Mother of the  Protestant Cause  so it must be a Pleasure to one of her tender Sentiments to think and hear that the Political Child as well as the Religious Interest of her Country is likely to be so well provided  for and secur'd in the Hands of so Good and Illustrious a Race And whereever that petty Scribler has learn'd his Politicks he really disserves his  Popish Cause  by such weak Insinuations It's in a manner Divesting her of that Compassion for the Welfare of her People which is so natural to her it's no less than Sowing Jealousy amongst her Subjects as if she did not care to hear that Family mention'd It's running counter to her Majesty's Sentiments who has always that Family at Heart and can the Mention of any Thing that lyes so near one's Heart give any Pain or Uneasiness No sure rather please the Ear and gratify the Spirits and tho' the Dislike to that Great Family appears but too open yet methinks in pure Deference to her Majesty's Esteem of it at least a cool Mention might be made of the Name but their Aversion being unconquerable and the Bent of their Souls lying so strong to another Interest they cannot put on so much as a specious Disguise upon their Rancour but openly wearing the Livery of  Lesly  's  Good Old Cause  pray that the Scepter may late drop into the Hands of the Rightful and Lawful Successor which seems to be of no difficult Interpretation with many other curious Phrazes too long to enumerate  If after this we should reckon up the defamatory Libels SideReflections and open Aspersions that have fallen from Pens and Mouths of the lowest Rank against that  Illustrious House  and which have given just Occasion of Complaint they would swell a Volume all which in their natural Tendency raise mean Apprehensions of that Family in the Minds of the People alienate their Affections by degrees and in Consequence dispose them to receive the  Pretender  The Rigid  Tories  had some Difficulties in their way which no sober Man thought masterable It took them up some Time and requir'd no small Artifice to wean the Generality from the high Esteem they entertain'd for the House of  Hanover  That Point once gain'd they had other Obstacles to get over as Perswading the World into a Belief of the Legitimacy of the  Pretender  which the Party from Time to Time have attempted by Reprinting the Depositions lodg'd in  Chancery  and Contriving weak Answers to them on purpose that Falshood might have the Advantage of a good Light crying up the Vigour of King  James  and making wrong Inferences of the Young Chevalier's Legitimacy from a fresh Imposture in the Person of a Daughter trump'd up since his Exile in  France    These weak Instances which were universally exploded not many Years ago having alate obtain'd some Countenance from great Numbers of People there was still another Difficulty left to get over with respect to Religion And this Point has been solv'd with all the Reason and Address the Affair is capable of For tho' several were tolerably well inclin'd to the  Pretender  's Interest from wrong Postulata's of his Legitimacy and the  moving Topick  of a Young Innocent's being debarr'd of his Right yet the Interests of Religion stuck with many a great while To obviate any Scruples about so tender a Point the Party soon vamp'd up an Orthodox Saint who had lurk'd in Corners for Writing Treason against the present Government for seven Years together and least his Character under the Title of the  Rehearsal  might be generally detested and odious they gave him the new Name of  White  When all Things were prepar'd for his intended  Route  then the  Excrements  of the Party acquainted the World that in all Probability there would be no great Need of any  ComeOver's  or  Hanover  's for that great Casuist Mr  White  had undertaken a Journey to  Switzerland  to convert the  Pretender  Such Assurances from so reputable  an Author and Prospect of the young Gentleman's Conversion from so blessed a Missionary in thoughtful times no doubt must have gain'd Credit equal to the Value of the Agents concern'd but such was and is the Delusion of too many at present even from those Authorities to believe him well dispos'd to Renounce his Religion and become a  Protestant  Whilst others less modest of the  Pretender's  Party openly arraign the Justice of Parliaments and Scorning to pave his Way to the Throne by any popular  Salvo  's put his Title upon the foot of  Jus Sacrum  denying the Legislature a power of Excluding or Disinheriting any Prince of either real or pretended Right upon the Account of his Religion tho' destructive of the true Worship of God and the Civil Rights of the Nation  By such Impudent False and Unwarrantable Positions the poor credulous Multitude has been set a Madding and drawn in to weigh an  Imaginary Right  in the Scale against  Substantial Liberty  and reviv'd Notions which have been bury'd in Oblivion for many Years and conjur'd up at this time only to root out the  Protestant Religion  and ruin the best of  Constitutions  And as the uninterrupted Progress of these wicked Opinions has given no small Confidence to the Promoters of them so  likewise has it strengthen'd many wellmeaning People in the Belief of them who forming their Judgment from the most popular and prevailing Cries grow more and more confirm'd when they find such Principles not altogether Discountenanc'd by Authority  I shall not insist upon the Penetration of the  French  Court which some time since plainly saw where these Humours of the People where gathering and occasion'd the Dauphin's Complementing the late Queen  Mary  upon some wonderful Change working on this side in her Favour but am sorry the Prophecy seems so near at hand The  Pretender  's Health which us'd Formerly to be softned with the Gloss of universal Charity or drank under some ByName scorns such Reserves at present and triumphs in it's full Title The  Protestant  Reign of King  William  scarce finds a room in the Royal Line of Succession but has been openly decry'd for some Time as a Successful Usurpation nay to that high Pitch of Impudence has this  Popish  Faction lately arriv'd as to interrupt the Publick Solemnizing that great Prince's BirthDay and the Miraculous Deliverance of these three Kingdoms nay even to insult the Gentlemen and almost demolish an honest  Protestant  Vintner's House in  GraceChurchStreet  Had this been done only by a needy Rabble instigated by  Popish  Partizans and  French  Money it had been more excusable but when arm'd Authority appear'd and instead of discountenancing joyn'd in with these foul Measures it cannot but aggravate our Fears and make us conclude that our safety depends upon a very Precarious Title when those who are the proper Guards against such Insolence and should appear active in Suppressing such Riots are the forwardest in Promoting them But what will be ever remarkable upon this Occasion and no doubt fix a Double Portion of Honour upon the Head of a certain wise Magistrate when Affairs once come to be impartially debated is that one of the Gentlemen who met to pay Honour to the Memory of the late King  William  was ask'd to find Security for his good Behaviour and threaten'd to be bound over for so desperate an attempt whereas in doing less he had been guilty of Ingratitude to his Royal Benefactor But we are not at a loss for the Magistrate and his Principles and he who was openly charg'd upon the  Pretender  's Invasion with making a Run upon the Bank in order to ruin the National Credit cannot be suppos'd to have reform'd his Principles much since that time or to act lessstrenuously in  Favour of a cause at a juncture when there is no manner of necessity for clearing himself from such Imputations It may in a very little time be reckon'd a mighty Indulgence to mention the Name of King  William  in a dutiful manner without Exposing one's self to the Reproach and Violence of the People and if the Ringleaders of the Faction are able to support the Spirit at present reigning in the Multitude to a convenient Opportunity it's probable they may have their longexpected Restoration of  Popery  and  Slavery  with as little Expence of Blood as in the late glorious  Revolution  we had our Redemption from it The several  Jacobite Clubs  which are said to be set up in all Quarters of the Town are chang'd from their first Institution of Drinking Healths to the Impostor under feign'd Names And at present are so many publick training Schools where the Youth of the Nation are disciplin'd into an Opinion of the Justice of his Title and taught to compassionate his Sufferings all the  Arbitrary Proceedings  of his suppos'd Father are represented in Fading Colours the acts of Violence and Encroachments upon the Civil and Religious Rights of the Nation are imputed to the Headiness of a few  Jesuits  in direct Opposition to the Natural Temper and Tenderness of King  James  that the Queen Mother's Bloody and Revengeful  Temper meaning King  James  's Consort is very much moderated by her past Sufferings and the whole Court is resolv'd to conduct Affairs by more temperate Maxims In fine that the King in the  Protestant  Account a Notorious Bastard has so true a Scheme of the Disposition of his Loving Subjects as never to bear upon the Laws or the Mildness of a Constitution they have been accustom'd to and that having his GrandFather's and Father's Sufferings always in his Eye he is resolv'd only to assert his own Hereditary Right and never to dispute any mans Legal one  These are the Baits by which the  Popish Faction  ensnare the Youth who never saw the approaching Dangers before the  Revolution  and think them much magnify'd by the Spleen of a malignant Party with which all in that cursed Interest asperse the true  Protestants  of the Kingdom and even those who were EyeWitnesses to the Oppression of former Days have thro' an Ease and Plenty of above Years standing grown so forgetful and cold in their Resentments of those  Outrages  which were daily offer'd to  Protestants  by the  Missionaries  in  Black  and  Red  that they express very little Dislike of seeing that dismal Scene acted over again  So strongly has the Poison work'd thro'  the whole Nation as to be humanly speaking Proof against the most Sovereign  Antidotes  and tho' it is scarce possible to trace the Source of this great Evil thro' the several intricate Valves and small Vassels it runs yet we cannot be so blind as not to discover it receives a Supply from Men of a better Figure and way of Thinking than are to be met with amongst the middle Class of Mankind  It's happy for this Nation at present that we have such a Pure Orthodox and True  Church of England  Administration to ballance the general Inclination to  Popery  and  Slavery  and stem the Majority of so many wicked Tempers It must be an Argument of great Circumspection in Men of such high Characters if they escape falling under the Lash of such virulent Tongues and Pens and are not maliciously brought in as Abetting the Designs of this  Popish Faction  after they have gone such a length in their course of Impudence some Time since as to give out That the Queen secretly favour'd their wicked Enterprizes grounding their impious Assertions without Dispute upon her Royal Clemency and their own Impunity It is no great Complement at this Time to the Men in Power neither do I believe they would be at all pleas'd that so many of the  Jacobite Party  should assume to themselves so much upon the late Changes or that they are every Day enlarging their Prospect from the present Posture of Affairs One would be tempted to think by their Confidence that they had receiv'd some Assurances from the  Great  but the Characters of such a vigilant and faithful Ministry secures all good People from any Apprehensions which might otherwise arise from the Effrontery  of so daring a Faction For we are told by the Author of the  Review  and that is an Authority not to be question'd That if People will be quiet and set easy under this Administration there is no Fear of the  Pretender  but that if they will compass Sea and Land and even go to the Centre in Order to ruin it then according to the Principles of Flesh and Blood the Ministry will in all Likelyhood make the best Terms to secure themselves But let our Hopes from the Men in Power be never so well grounded and the Expectations of the  Jacobite Faction  never so vain yet it becomes every  Protestant  at this Hour to consider upon what a ticklish Bottom he is like to stand upon from the Activity and Insolence of that Party and it ought likewise to put him upon his Guard against being unwarily drawn into their wicked Associations under specious Pretences to the Ruin of his Liberty Religion and Conscience That idle Pretence of the  Church's  Danger has been lately made the Handle to  Confusion  I wish before that  Notion  has throughly spent it self it does not accomplish the Destruction of the State For the cunning Managers of the  Jacobite Interest  will keep up that plausible Topick till the Danger is just at hand and after having made an irreconcilable Division amongst  Protestants  of all Perswasions will urge Perseverance to those who have been led away by them from the true  Protestant  and  National Interest  and from the Extremities they have reduc'd them to will propose a total  Apostacy  as the only Expedient left for  Safety  and Probation of their Merit upon a Change  It's plain to a Demonstration that the  Papists  ever since the th of Queen  Elizabeth  have been playing the  Rigid Church men  against the  Protestants  of a more capacious Faith and Charity and from those Split Interests have been near upon the point of determining the Controversies and swallowing up all Distinctions between  Protestants  But since within these few Years the sober and discreet Part of the  Church of England  which are the true and lively Ornaments of it duly weighing the National Interest of this Kingdom both in Church and State and seriously reflecting on the Causes of our unhappy Divisions have fallen into Comprehensive Measures and a Primitive Temper of Forbearance these  Rigid Spirits  have have set themselves at open Defiance with the  Moderate  and drawn off so wide from the  Protestant Interest  that they are become the most virulent of the  Popish Faction  It therefore behoves every  Protestant Briton  to guard timely against the wicked Insinuations of these Men who cry up the  Hereditary Right  of the  Pretender  and come to this undeniable Maxim That even upon a Supposition that this Impostor was the Legitimate Son of King  James  the Nation is involv'd in less guilt by keeping him out then by receiving him upon the most plausible Terms and Circumscriptions because the  Pretended  or even the  Real Right  of one man after so many bloo  Struggles for the Defence of our  Liberty  and  never compensate the Nation for the Slaughter and Devastation which must necessarily ensue upon such an Intrusion for let the Party soften the matter as much as they think fit whenever that unhappy day comes we must prepare to meet him arm'd with a true  Italian  Revenge bred up in all the destructive Principles of a Bigotted Mother and the Tyrannical Notions of a  French  Master  FINIS
