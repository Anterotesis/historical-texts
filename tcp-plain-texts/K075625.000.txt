 Oculus Britanniae  AN Her  Panegyrical POEM ON THE University of OXFORD  Illustrated with divers beautiful Similes and useful Digressions  Juvat antiquos exquirere fontes  LONDON Printed for R FRANCKLIN under  Tom  'sCoffeeH  se  CoventGarden  Price OneShilling▪  TO  THOMAS PRT  Esq  Doctor of civil Law and Fellow of St  J's  Ce in  Od  SIR  I  believe you are a gentleman  who is not unwilling that his actions should be faithful∣ly transmitted to posterity  and as nobody can have a more sensible regard for your great virtues and abilities than my self I beg leave to make the world acquaint∣ed with them in the following dedication  YOU came into the world sir under the influence of a lucky planet being born of an ancient and worthy family to a plentiful fortune as well as great natural endowments and hereditary virtues all which you have since im∣proved by a liberal education under the care of one of the ablest pillars of our church and as his ingenious friend Mr MIST emphatically stiles him the  brightest ornament of the brightest body in the world  by his pre∣cepts and example you have finished in your self one of the finest gentlemen and greatest scholars of our age  Transplanting one by one into your life  His bright perfections till you shine like him  IT is impossible that one thus richly endowed by na∣ture and improved by art should not make a very extra∣ordinary figure You discovered the earliest marks of a great genius and at an age when we say of others that they are promising youths you were arrived at the high∣est  perfection and maturity of manhood You brought with you from school a thorough knowledge of the classical writers and the learned languages so that you had no∣thing to interrupt your stricter academical studies by which means and a close application you soon became a deep logician a profound philosopher and an excellent mathematician In short you grew a compleat master of most arts and sciences particularly necromancy and metaphysicks and no part of learning has entirely escap∣ed your knowledge  NOR have you cultivated your  Head  only which in this age is the least part of a liberal character but e∣ven your  heels  sir discover the marks of an academi∣cal education that pretty flutter in your gait that care∣less swing of your arms and that polite turn of your head may to some people seem only to be the natural effect of well proportion'd limbs and a regular body but to a nice observer every motion will appear  syllogisti∣cal  and strictly conformable to  Mode  and  Figure  How often have I seen you come into a room in  Barbara  and salute the company in  Darii  how often do you pay your devotions in  Ferio  and dance in  Baralipton  as this is an art perhaps peculiar to yourself and the author of  Mathe∣matical rules for Dancing  it is no wonder that you have gain'd the character of the politest gentleman in the u∣niversity and triumph'd over all your rivals in the affec∣tions of the ladies  BUT I must not dwell too long upon one of your most trifling qualifications considering how many there are still behind and how narrow a compass my bookseller has prescribed me to celebrate them in  GIVE me leave therefore learned sir in a cursory man∣ner to mention your humanity candour and publick spirit your acute wit unbyass'd judgment and penetrat∣ing understanding your nice sence of honour magnani∣mity and intrepid courage your chastity sobriety and unspotted virtue but above all your unshaken loyalty  in the true sence of the word your invincible orthodoxy and strict adherence to the catholick church  YOUR intimate acquaintance with the  modern Langu∣ages  and your profound skill in  modern History  are so well known that it would be matter of great astonish∣ment to me how you could escape being nominated to a certain Profip lately established if I did not con∣sider how some people I can hardly keep it in not∣withstanding all their  pains  and  penalties  but we were pretty even with them at last and I am sure it is no disappointment to you who choose to do good and pro∣pagate knowledge  without any Reward  WITH all these shining accomplishments however you may be despised elsewhere you could not fail of acquir∣ing a very popular reputation in the famous university of OXFORD which amidst the general depravity of man∣kind and the lamentable increase of fanaticism both in church and state has maintained its antient purity in the worst of times even as our ingenious professor of poetry once observed  whilst armed Forces were within our Walls  Accordingly you have proceeded in the re∣gular method prescribed by our statutes too slow indeed for your aspiring merit to the highest degree which our university can confer and whenever you shall please to oblige the world with any of those valuable manuscripts which enrich your cabinet you may dignify the title page with  Fellow of a College and Doctor of civil Law  HAVING said thus much which is much too lit∣tle of you my present most honoured Patron give me leave Sir with the imputation of as little va∣nity as possible to say something of my self and my following performance  YOU must know Sir that I have been several years a matriculated son of this antient university and though for want of the same natural talents and the same application I have not done the good old lady half the honour which you have done nor re∣ceived  half so many honours from her hands yet I shall never forget the obligations which I lie under to her for that small portion of learning which I pos∣sess and that little figure which I make in the world A due sense of these obligations join'd with a violent indignation to see her traduced and vilified by some persons who ought to know and practice bet∣ter has occasioned the following sheets in which I have endeavoured to perpetuate her name and to raise up a column of my own gratitude that it may not be said of me in future ages as I fear it will be of too many that I would not  look to the rock from whence I was hewn nor to the pit from whence I was digged  I cannot in this place forbear assuring you that when I first resolved upon this undertaking you jump'd immediately into my head as the fittest person to pa∣tronize it and I have not been able with all my deli∣beration to alter my opinion ever since so that you see it was by a sort of inspiration that I desire your protection of this Work  I know the conclusion of my  POEM  where I presage my own future glory will be particulary cavil'd at and I shall be call'd a vain conceited coxcomb for my pains but in answer to this without insisting on the examples of  Horace  and  Ovid  in the same case I say that it is an intolerable grievance upon modern authors to be restrained from commending their own works No body expects that the good wives of  I  ∣lingsgate  should cry stinking fish or that any vintner in town should tell you that his wine is sour nay e∣very surly rascal of a shoemaker shall take the liberty to look you saucily in the face when he puts you to execrable torture with a pair of new shoes and swear that they sit as easy as your mistress's gloves whereas it is expected of an author that he should cry down his own ware and though he publishes a better poem  than ever  Homer  or  Virgil  did should make a thou∣sand excuses for troubling the world with such indiffer∣ent stuff as he is obliged to call it to the manifest hinderance of his market and against the fullest con∣viction of his own mind I think therefore every ma∣nufacturer of the brain ought to rise up against this growing evil and assert the same right with all other tradesmen and artificers to warrant his goods and thereby promote the sale of them as much as he can  FOR my part though I do not think my self vain∣er than other men I will venture to affirm in defi∣ance of all the criticks and ignorant carping rascals in  England  that the following poem is a perfect finish'd peice according to the strictest rules of  Aristotle  and  Longinus  whom I will be again bold to say no body has studied more or understands better than my self I maintain that the model is just and regular the diction truely sublime and the panegyrick well hit off if it be ob∣jected that I have now and then introduced little sar∣casms and strokes of satire I have  Virgil Horace  and all the best authors both antient and modern to justi∣fy me in such occasional deviations  I have also their authority as I could easily prove from a multitude of instances to apologize for the many  beautiful similes  and  useful digressions  with which I have thought fit to illustrate and diversify the whole they are all on my side and so I have no apprehensions from them but I am terribly afraid of a certain merry gentleman in this town who frequently says that  there is nothing in the world so  unlike  as similes  he might with the same reason add and I hope he will do it  that nothing is so pertinent as digressions  this will make us some amends and give us with one hand what he takes away with the other  As for my self I have laboured to make my  similes  as  like  and my  digressions  as  pertinent  as possibly I could I am sure it has cost me a great deal of pains  as I doubt not it has most authors to bring them in and make them look pat to the purpose nay I could not with all my pains lug in some which I was not a little fond of and particularly the following distich  So barren  chalk  which no production yields  Burnt into  lime  manures the neighbouring fields  YOU must allow sir that this is a very pretty simile and if it could but be handsomely applied would make a good figure in my poem but after the strictest examination I could not hedge it in any where in the following pages and being loth that so uncom∣mon a thought should be lost I have inserted it in this place making it my request that if you or any of my candid readers can think of any method to in∣troduce it properly into the body of my work you will oblige me with the hint and the favour shall be grate∣fully acknowledged in the second edition  I had also a mind to foist in a digression against the late bills for  inspecting drugs medicines c  and for  ex∣cising  of  tea coffee  and  chocolate  but not being able to discover any relation which they have to the univer∣sity of  Oxford  I was obliged to reserve it for a more proper occasion  SIR I was going on to acquaint you with some more of my projects but my bookseller is just come in and tells me that I must break off immediately and that he cannot afford a line more for a shilling which is the price we have agreed to fix upon this summerpiece of entertain∣ment for gentlemen and ladies what therefore I have farther to say to you upon this and all other occasions must be defer'd till another opportunity which you may depend upon shall not be neglected by  Learned sir  your unknown ad∣mirer and devoted Servant  PHILOMUSUS  OXFORD  July  OCULUS BRITANNIAE  c  M  ATRON of arts and to the  bri∣tish  youth  Thou shining pillar of religious truth  Sprung from primaeval kings and saints divine  Thy sacred ear illustrious dame incline  Whilst filial duty wings my youthful lays  And prompts me forward studious of thy praise  BUT how shall I the mighty theme sustain  Of ALMA'S glories in an equal strain  Unskill'd in verse and to the muses young  What God what angel will inform my tongue  Aid me DELAUNE instruct me reverend sire  With thy own sacred heat my breast inspire  O touch my lips with thy coelestial art  And with the same devotion fire my heart  ENOUGH enoughthrough every kindling vein  Thy godlike fury shoots and fires my brain  The same strong impulse and religious flame  Which in the pulpit shakes thy goodly frame  And which sometimes provokes thy righteous heel  To kick obdurate whigs in rampant zeal  Like yours methinks my eyes in lightning roll  Like yours tumultuous raptures lift my soul  Inspir'd I soar beyond my common flight  And I am either fit to rhime or fight  IN this divine delirium to my eyes  Abstracted forms and fancied objects rise  Whilst the pleas'd muse in thoughtful silence roves  Through the cool shades and academick groves  In the clear fountains and the silvan springs  Sees the young cygnets dip their snowy wings  Observes the streams of science roll along  Here floats a syllogism there a song  Here unborn poems tune the warbling tide  And problems there instead of gudgeons glide  THROUGH these religious vallies as I stray  What crouds of ancient worthies throng the way  The ghosts of old philosophers appear  That once adorn'd the place and flourish'd here  Muse tune thy voice in homage bend thy head  And pay just honours to the learned dead  SEE that lean spectre horrible and wan  Whose meagre looks declare the quondam man  Hail mighty SCOTUS hail unrival'd sage  The pride and glory of the monkish age  Reverse of bookworm which on books is fed▪  For books devour'd thee up and wore thee dead  How didst thou toil and labour for mankind  Who twenty folio tomes hast left behind  Unlike the modern writers of our land  Whom every shallow wit can understand  So deep your logick flows and so profound  No common plummet can the bottom sound  Thy pride it was to sift the darkest themes  To hoodwink truth and reconcile extremes  Selfcontradicting tenets to maintain  And prove by reason that all reason's vain  HIM BACON follows whose illustrious name  Lives in the annals of recording fame  That antient monk

headless trunk provokes my flowing tears  The sacred lawn his gushing blood distains  And with religious horror chills my veins  Muchinjur'd LAUD religion's boldest chief  A while great shade indulge the muse's grief  O prelate greatly for the church distrest  What zeal what fury could inflame thy breast  The rage of british senates to withstand  And stem the torrent of a factious land  Yet shalt thou not repent the pious deed  Though destin'd by the traytor's ax to bleed  With BECKET in religious mischief bold  A rubrick martyr shalt thou stand inroll'd  His annual debt thy  The reverend and learned Dr  Delaune  President of St  John  's college who has instituted a publick oration to the memory of archbishop  Laud  who was formerly president of the same college on the th of  January

heaven design'd  From scabs and ulcers to relieve mankind  Of so abstemious continent a life  He shun'd the enjoyment of his lawful wife  From age to age this wondrous art prevail'd  When the whole boasted strength of medicine fail'd  Through a long race of monarchs all divine  'Till but of late it ceas'd with STUART'S line  Unless adhering to some good old wives  In STUART'S lineal race it still survives  HERE then O JAMES let the long contest end  And on this issue let thy birth depend  In the wide forum of imperial ROME  Build a large stage and bid the lazars come  By this grand secret prove the STUART line  And let thy cures confirm thy right divine  If at thy touch the ulcers dye away  The sores heal up and all the scabs decay  In spight of BURNET'S tales and  Britain  's scorn  Will own thee most miraculously born  HAIL sacred art the priesthood's darling theme  Unlike our late  inoculating  scheme  That strange inverted Science rash and blind  Which plants diseases and infects mankind  Of cruel  Turks  and infidels the boast  And first devis'd on hell's infernal coast  For so the  See  MASSEY'S  sermon against  inoculation  priest aver'd in holy satire  And prov'd  old Nick  the first inoculator  BUT who is that in robes of purple drest  Who drops with sullen pride his mitred crest  Mark how he bears resentment in his eye  And damns his sovereign as he passes by  Some minion of the court from favour thrown  And lo his form bespeaks the  butcher  's  son  In every look great WOLSEY stands confess'd  See how the rising passion heaves his breast  See how his eyes with reddening vengeance glow  And how with hasty strides he spurns the sand below  FALL down ye sons of  Christchurch  at his feet  And gratefully your benefactor greet  For o remember to his bounteous hand  How much indebted and oblig'd you stand  He first with large endowments did intail  Your  loins of mutton  and your  butts of ale  To him you owe the soft engaging art  Of pretty songs and epigrams so smart  'Twas he that took you from the rural plains  And made you  scholards  who had else been swains  Instead of jolly  canons  you had now  Perhaps some livery worn or follow'd plow  Perhaps some painful servile life have led  Or in the shambles like himself been bred  MALICIOUS tongues indeed with censures loud  Stile him imperious turbulent and proud  Revengeful cruel of a ruthless mind  To persecution and to rage inclin'd  In whoredom and pollution uncontroul'd  And to a proverb arrogantly bold  A publick drunkard and a college thief  In act a brute an atheist in belief  To lust they say he sacrific'd his breath  And perish'd of the foul venereal death  SUCH heavy loads of infamy and shame  Our bold reformers charge on WOLSEY'S Name  Proud of their northern heresies deride  His priestly grandeur and religious pride  Hand down his vices to succeeding times  And make his function aggravate his Crimes  BUT FIDDES by sublimer views inspir'd  And with a churchman's indignation fir'd  Lists in this great unhappy prelate's cause  And by more candid rules his picture draws  Solves all objections which historians make  And screens his failings for his function's sake  BEHOLD him now by FIDDES varnish'd o'er  Unlike the monstrous fiend you shunn'd before  His magick pages wipe off every taint  The  atheist  and the  brute  becomes a saint  His  drunkenness  is only nature's slip  For who alas can from temptation keep  His  impudence  in courtly language drest  The  See his life of  WOLSEY p  great ascendant  happily express'd  His  rage  is only zeal for romish laws  And  persecution  is the church's cause  Revenge  is taking God almighty's part  And  pride  the token of a noble heart  His  whoredom  and  pollution  who can blame  Since  Solomon  was guilty of the same  His  collegefrauds  it must be understood  Were well design'd and for the publick good  To finish towers old steeples to repair  And build religious castles in the air  Nor is he last of all that godly croud  To whom this candid plea has been allow'd  That of the  pox  he dy'd and such like stuff  Great FIDDES says 'tis false and that's enough  SO LAUD by HEYLIN fil'd and polish'd bright  Shines forth an angel of unspotted light  Shakes off the rust of threescore gloomy Years  And in his volume like a god appears  ONE pious work o FIDDES still remains  A theme well worthy your immortal pains  And since in  vindications  you abound  As WOLSEY and his GRACE  See his vindication of a late  epitaph  have lately found  To one great churchman more your aid afford  And let unhappy JUDAS be the third  In his defence at least it may be said  That what he did alas he did for bread  And err'd poor man as modern  swearers  cant  To save a numerous family from want  Doctor 'twill do the pious task begin  Clear up his case and prove the  kiss  no sin  This will for ever all our foes defeat  And thy divine APOLOGIES compleat  TO these a various gowned tribe succeeds  Fam'd for their learning or illustrious deeds  Physicians lawyers and a medly throng  Of preaching clerks and poets that have sung  Logicians that have foil'd the statesman's schemes  And prophets that sav'd nations by their dreams  Casuists and schooldivines whose mystick skill  Could alter vice and virtue at their will  Of right divine prove persecuting rage  And tyranny the blessing of an age  Turn pure religion into mortal sin  And make the devil to the saints akin  BUT shall the dead alone engross my lays  O no the living shall partake my praise  Muse prune thy pinions for a second flight  For living heroes claim an equal height  BUT where encompass'd with a mingled blaze  Of doughty sculls shall I begin to praise  Where'er around I cast my wondring eyes  Heroic bards and shining beaux arise  In the same jovial common room I see  The prim canonic bob and smart  tupeè  Grave criticks here on modern authors prey  And deep logicians puzzle sense away  Pert crambowags with subtil schoolmen joke  And punsters and divines in consort smoke  IN this illustrious croud so learn'd and wise  BRAZEN the college tyrant charms my eyes  Great must his merits be his virtues choice  Which five successive years gain'd ARRAN'S voice  In him at least some excellence is shown  Fam'd for his brother's parts if not his own  His brother's virtues all divinely bright  Reflect on him a pale inferiour light  What for the  cause  his patriotbrother bears  The learned  Head  in  A meeting of the  heads  of colleges so called  ordinance  declares  His shrewd harangues in senate he repeats  With the same zealous pangs his bosom beats  Oft in his veins he boasts  truebritish  blood  And raves devoutly for his country's good  Of naughty statesmen ecchoes dismal tales  And against WALPOLE o'er his bottle rails  SO the pale moon is not without her praise  Though from the sun she borrows all her rays  NEXT to DELAUNE as next to  Brazen  's heart  Muse touch the string and prove thy utmost art  O for a pinion from the  mantuan  swan  To reach the mighty theme and sing the man  Who more than forty years a shining space  Has graced these walls and still vouchsafes to grace  With various honours crown'd for various arts  All far unequal to his great deserts  Who wants no virtue by no vice defaced  Wise learned pious sober humble chast  So strictly honest so severely just  And rigidly tenacious of his trust  That his integrity surmounts my song  And ev'n to name it is to do him wrong  FROM such proud heights o muse presump∣tous bend  And to his private qualities descend  Say how his soul in conversation shines  Oe'r the third bottle how his wit refines  How in smart jests his sacred lips excel  What mirth they start and jocund fables tell  How grave his looks how orthodox his dress  Ev'n stubborn AMHURST will these truths confess  SO  Lucifer  when fal'n was forc'd to own  The bright superior pow'r that hurl'd him down  HOW for his college he employs his care  How helpless orphans his protection share  HDWTH and WS shall solemnly declare  And if superior evidence we need  HES  on the gospel  shall attest the deed  SMTH shall confirm his oath if that avail  And ON stand his sacramental bail  BENEATH his care great CLARENDON appear'd  From all surmises of corruption clear'd  He to the press the deathless work convey'd  By no base bribes nor partial motives sway'd  He scorn'd to vary from the written tale  Nor could the hopes of bishopricks prevail  Yet if the foe will still insult thy name  And with black scandal strive to taint thy fame  Soon shall he blush for HIDE'S impartial ghost  Shall visit earth to this defamer's cost  And purge thy virtue though the copy's lost  FAIN would the muse inflam'd with pious zeal  Millions of other graces still reveal  All cent'ring in this man to bless the age  His equal mind and temper void of rage  His energy in pray'r his faith sublime  His meekness love and candour to a crime  But conscious of her weakness she declines  And to some collegebard the glorious theme resigns  NOR shall that hoary seer remain unsung  To whom the reins of  Exeter  belong  That learned doctor and that frugal Head  Who grudges ev'n himself his daily bread  Of so penurious provident a sense  He curses human life for its expence  And often wishes he was under ground  Rather than lose a penny in the pound  Candles are dear and therefore he thinks best  Still with the setting sun to go to rest  Unless to finish something for his shop  FLETCHER will pay him well for sitting up  Yet few I fear will think it worth their while  So languid is his matter and his stile  To publish all the volumes he could write  Poor WHSTR was alas half ruin'd by't  WITH half a fowl and  half a penny small  He makes a sober dinner in the hall  Such slender meals suffice his famish'd nerves  And the minc'd fragment for his supper serves  STOOPING with age he dodders as he goes  From his red eyes a rheumy torrent flows  Like winter fruit his yellow rivel'd skin  Dams up the little blood that creeps within  Threescore and ten have quench'd his vital heat  And his decaying pulses scarcely beat  Yet thus disabled for the longing dame  he feels the pangs of love though not the flame  Fair RAGGABEL that near his collegegate  Fine china sells and tea and chocolate  Or mends old tatter'd gowns with matchless art  Shines in his eye and triumphs in his heart  Oft to her shop the feeble lecher strays  Toys with her hand or with her bubbies plays  On her dear face he rolls his doting eyes  As she weighs coffee or the needle plies  One evening prostrate on his tottering knees  The sapless dotard spoke in words like these  BEHOLD o fairest of those gentle maids  Who with their beauty grace these learned shades  Behold what conquests thy perfections gain  A reverend aged doctor wears thy chain  Me whom a college for its Head obeys  To whom each fellow servile homage pays  Thy beauty captivates thy charms inthral  Ev'n at these years a slave to love I fall  And o my dearest RAGGY do not quite  Break my old heart or judge my torments slight  Unlike raw boys who tell you fulsome lies  Adore this moment and the next despise  Ripen'd with age my passion cannot change  Nor will my years permit my heart to range  Smile on me then and with thy blooming charms  Bless my desiring my impatient arms  One evening at my lodgings let me prove  With how much truth and constancy I love  THE damsel though with wit not overstock'd  With this severe reply his reverence shock'd  What pity is it that desire should last  And the goodwill to sin when youth is past  Thy passions still remain thrice holy drone  And ah I grieve to think the sting is gone  Yes I behold thee with a pitying eye  And for my sake good man thou shalt not dye  Since at your lodgings you request my sight  I'll wait upon you there to morrow night  Safe in thy hands my virtue I will trust  And do dear doctor do thy very worst  BE not so mighty smart the don reply'd  Nor judge so rashly e'er my strength is try'd  In me the emblem of a leek is seen  White though my head be turn'd my tail is green  BUT whither does the muse erroneous stray  By tales of love diverted from her way  GARDINER upbraids my ears with cold neglect  And from the muse demands his due respect  FORBEAR great man restrain thy flowing gall  Wherefore on me do all these censures fall  Why shouldst thou hope for honour from my lays  When thy own YOUNG forgets to sing thy praise  WHAT shall a patriot lose his due reward  Because ill us'd by one ungrateful bard  Your pardon sir the reasoning I allow  And with these honours deck your lofty brow  IF size and stature raise a deathless name  How vast your praise how bulky is your fame  Without a rival sir the streets you tread  Thou greatest wittiest man now TADLOE'S dead  Since that huge atlas fell you reap alone  The thanks of all the  Alluding to the following epigram  When TADLOE walks the streets the paviers cry  God bless you sir and throw their rammers by  paviers in the town  NOR must thy praise o TAFFY be forgot  Another college prince and tyrant sot  To GDR next in learning and in size  Somewhat more honest and almost as wise  His sanguine cheeks with deep vermilion glow  With  antientbritish  blood his veins o'erflow  His country's native ire inflames his breast  And hostile leeks nod dreadful on his crest  Like proud  Plinlimmon  's height he seems to move  And his broad shoulders prop the clouds above  HEAVEN to this man unusual vigour gave  To rule a college obstinately brave  Youths all endued with more than vulgar flame  And stubborn as the rocks from whence they came  Hard to restrain by nature prone to rage  No common arm their fury can asswage  So much with sparks of vengeance they abound  They knock opposing bargemen to the ground  And like a tempest hurl destruction round  FAIN would I next great DSON rehearse  And greet him with new honours in my verse  O might I call him by that awful name  Which his soul covets and his merits claim  How would it touch the cockles of my heart  In  ordinance  to see him bear his part  'Gainst upstart masters wage confederate war  And  A place so called where the  sculls  of colleges meet about business  GOLGOTHA receive another star  FULL well he knows this office to acquit  And must be own'd for college business fit  Oe'r passive fellows skill'd to domineer  And grant to few the favour of his ear  From BRAZEN and DE he learnt the arts  To pick their pockets while he gains their hearts  To be ador'd for breaking all their laws  And tyrannize with safety and applause  SO romish priests esteem and reverence gain  By bidding penance and imposing pain  The wellflogg'd Zealots bless their Father's voice  And in raw backs and aking bones rejoice  BUT ah within our walls dissention reigns  And modern feuds disturb the laurel'd plains  Pert upstart patriots with rebellious pride  Spurn at their  Heads  and GOLGOTHA deride  In bold confederate clubs and plots engage  And youthful whims oppose to thoughtful age  Each day the hoary sages sink in pow'r  And Presidents and Provosts sway no more  With grumbling tories factious whigs combine  And against DNN perversely join  Resolv'd to baulk him of the darling pow'r  And antient rights of CHARLOT'S successor  WHO after these shall animate the lyre  MTHR  The present worthy  VCR  of  Oxford  do thou my flagging verse inspire  Instruct the muse thy praises to rehearse  And with thy shining deeds adorn my verse  Do thou for surely none besides can tell  No mortal knows thy merits half so well  BUT I perceive you frown upon my lays  And sullenly reject the proffer'd praise  Content to wither in obscure retreat  And unobserv'd in plenty drink and eat  O'er aukward college pedants to preside  With private grandeur and monastick pride  In indolence and ease to live unknown  And nod like eastern tyrants on their throne  NOR dost thou only chuse this mongrel Life  Blest with collegiate honours andno wife  Sundry besides thy brethren of the gown  Like thee despising fame and wide renown  Preferring stated meals and frequent prayers  To worldly bustles and domestick cares  Within their humble cells indulge the spleen  Men never talk'd of and but rarely seen  With their obsequious fellows they debate  In their own cloysters all affairs of state  Con over MIST and SHATTER once a week  And by their love of kings and statesmen speak  In the same tract of commonplace they move  And learn from them to censure and approve  OTHERS there arebut studious of her fame  Fain would the muse conceal her mother's shame  Sore loath I am to speak the mournful truth  That modern  Heads  corrupt the letter'd youth  That bold fanaticks full of sturdy zeal  For BRUNSWICK'S house disturb our commonweal  Grave loyal wretches of their monarch proud  To collegepow'r advanc'd infect the croud  Through these unhappy walls their poison spread  And strike ev'n GOLGOTHA it self with dread  SINCE first our Grannum cropt the fatal tree  No spot of earth is from pollution free  Briers and thorns infest the richest ground  And tares amongst the choicest wheat are found  The fruitful  Nile  destructive monsters breeds  And ev'n  An antient name of  Oxford  and the country which surrounds it  Bellositum  pruduces weeds  YET bring them forth my muse to publick shame  And in thy numbers brand each hated name  Each bold apostate son who durst disgrace  With heterogeneous thoughts his venerable race  HERE WICKLIFF first the northern errors fram'd  And CRANMER ever with abhorrence nam'd  Here LATIMER his novel doctrines taught  And RIDLEY here for gospel licence fought  Presumptuous prelates could they hope to live  And o're the ruins of the church survive  How could they dare oppose such mighty odds  And rashly strive with  Rome  's unnumber'd Gods  Within these walls a sacrifice they fell  And in their death forestall'd the pains of hell  FROM hence degenerate from the common throng  Ev'n men of sense and probity have sprung  Here LOCKE the second  Stagyrite  was bred  Of modern reasoning  whigs  the boasted head  Here HALES of  evermemorable  fame  And CHILLINGWORTH acquir'd a deathless name  Here KENNET first disclos'd his godlike soul  And HOUGH a tyrant's pleasure did controul  MARSHAM from hence his piercing genius drew  And LLOYD in these abodes immortal grew  HERE GUIBBONS late with  Aesculapian  skill  Preserv'd more lives than modern empericks kill  Friend to mankind and to his healing art  Join'd candour and benevolence of heart  On health and learning still vouchsafes to smile  And shines the great  Machaon  of our isle  HERE OLDHAM tag'd his rough licentious rhimes  And STEELE with whiggish wit prophan'd the times  Here TICKEL sung the charms of opening  peace  And YOUNG explor'd the mines of  Rome  and  Greece  PHILIPS and SMITH the  Christchurch  wits disgrace  And ADDISON pollutes the  Maudlin  race  FROM our old track whole colleges depart  And preach new doctrines with  Hoadleian  art  Long since the  Merton Lollards  The followers of  WICKLIFF  who were the first re∣formers in this island  went astray  And  Wadham  's sons to  Oriel  led the way  Exeter  follow'd and in some degree  Scarce is a college from infection free  TO propagate this rank contagious weed  Ev'n BRUNSWICK joins and sows the pregnant seed  With illtim'd gifts maliciously divine  Shakes our aversion to his  German  line  Shews that his breast with love of science burns  Smiles on our hate and good for ill returns  FROM such ungrateful topicks gentle muse  Divert thy song and nobler objects chuse  With more exalted themes thy numbers grace  In more exalted numbers sing the place  Where GL with unspotted virtue shines  And ATTRY form'd his great designs  O prelate of the church thou burning light  Through all thy sufferings eminently bright  In vain illfortune strives to make thee less  Great in thy self but greater in distress  Transfus'd into thy soul by power divine  LAUD'S active zeal and WOLSEY'S spirit shine  Like them pursued by a corrupted age  And sacrific'd to wild fanatick rage  Ordain'd a living martyrdom to feel  And in exotick climates broach thy zeal  How in thy praise could I dilate my song  But fate and rigid laws restrain my tongue  OUR stately rising buildings set to view  Say how we furbish old and model new  Our theatres musaeums printing domes  And libraries replete with folio tomes  Our greasy kitchens and large halls extol  And vaulted cellars stor'd with double  College ale  Coll  Our tow'ring steeples painful to behold  Our roaring bells and altars daub'd with gold  Say how our stables charm the jocky's eyes  And boghouses like palaces arise  SAY farther how the cause of faction thrives  For JAMES how ready to devote our lives  Our hierogliphick almanacks describe  Our  His excellency  EDWARD WHTR  Esq  Envoy extraordinary from the un ty of  Od  Envoybeadle and addressing tribe  How treason gives pretensions to a place  And loyalty escapes by  It is well known that the reverend  Mr MEADOW∣COURT  fellow of  Merton  college was obliged to plead his majesty's  Act of Grace  for drinking his majesty's health  Acts of Grace  How FIDDES for the church fatigues his quill  And how the devil looks o'er  Lincoln  still  RELIGION smiles while POTTER  The bishop of  Oxford  regius professor of divinity  fills the chair  And learning triumphs under MATHER'S care  From MLEY'S hideous looks by day and night  Leud strumpets fly and chasten in his sight  Shock'd at his form they curb their itching blood  And naughty children promise to be good  Aw'd with his cloven feet and scarecrow face  The athiest shudders and grows rich in grace  No more his dreadful execrations vents  But owns there is a devil and repents  NEXT to our  Oxford  laureats touch the string  And their great names in mighty numbers sing  For sure no bards abound with thoughts so bright  Nor with the genius of our poets write  TO prove this truth seraphick STERNHOLD read  And WITHERS both the right  Oxonian  breed  On SHERLEY'S comick pages cast your eyes  And hear how SETTLE'S lofty strains surprize  Our modern wits with equal lustre shine  Angelick COTES and CATCOT the divine  RICH CATHERAL TRISTRAM AMHURST WILKES and names  Which rhime and equalmeasur'd verse disclaims  What numbers would such rugged sounds compose  Which even offend the ear pronounced in prose  With the same ease I could in verse sublime  Make a  Welsh  pedigree harmonious chime  Or put the  Russian  army into rhime  UNHAPPY bards but others may be found  Whose gentle names in verse melodious sound  BACON in easy numbers glides along  And TRAP and WHARTON melt upon the tongue  Egregious wits and criticks both sublime  Whose kindred talents so exactly chime  That hard it is to say in verse or prose  Which happy genius more divinely flows  In this alone the former does excel  That TRAP writes most but WHARTON writes as well  BUT above all record the female race  The reigning Toasts and beauties of the place  Whether in  The  DruryLane  of  Oxford  Bullock'slane  they chuse to rove  Or  A publick house near  Oxford  dedicated to love  Kidneyhall  the soft retreat of love  Their shining virtues and their charms rehearse  And vindicate their names from  A scandalous libel upon the  Oxford  toasts  STREPHON'S verse  IN love too often interest sways the mind  And sordid riches our affections blind  Some squeamish fops fantastically nice  For virtue sigh and puke at modish vice  Others for titles languish and would scorn  Ev'n beauty's goddess if obscurely born  BY no such borrow'd charms nor spurious arts  Our  Oxford  ladies reign o'er youthful hearts  In their own native naked charms they shine  Smug chambermaids and sempstresses divine  Smart laundresses on  Saturdays  so clean  And bedmakers on every day between  The beggar's offspring to the parish left  And college bastards of their sires bereft  Nymphs without smocks our tender hearts sur∣prize  And deities in rags attract our eyes  UNHAPPY COBURNE lately laid in dust  How to thy ashes shall the muse be just  For to what member of APOLLO'S race  Did ever she deny the soft embrace  What slighted lover or despairing swain  Can of her wrongs or cruelty complain  No jilting tricks nor coying arts she knew  But to the amorous kind was ever true  To every sighing youth resign'd her charms  And bless'd at easy rates his longing arms  MOURN all ye sons of learning SABY'S fate  In verse and prose the mighty loss relate  With tropes and figures  Our most ingenious professor of  Oratory  COTES embalm her name  Our inimitable professor of  Poetry  WHARTON in grateful metre chaunt her fame  Let each surviving Toast her garland bring  And lavish o'er her grave the flowery spring  In streams of blood let conscious  Isis  flow  Let  Charwell  swell the sympathetick woe  Let  Christchurch Tom  her loss vociferous roar  Tom  who ne'er mourn'd for aught but kings before  In hymns of woe let every college join  In social grief let every voice combine  Let every heart with bursting sighs approve  Our sorrow as diffusive as her love  WHILE she surviv'd indulgent to our cause  We bilk'd our founders and defy'd their laws  Those grave old blockheads whose religious pride  Would quench love's flame and check old na∣ture's tide  Asswage hot blood explode the genial tast  And make mankind unnaturally chast  Reliev'd by her from these imperious chains  We knew the sweets of love without the pains  Clasp'd to her bosom every college round  The joys of marriage without marriage found  Spight of their musty statutes all the night  We roll'd in bliss and revel'd in delight  AMIDST these transports to our joys a slave  Death praematurely snatch'd her to the grave  That rank disease that fierce corroding flame  Which takes from  Venus  its venereal name  Siez'd on her bloom polluted all her charms  And with contagion fill'd her circling arms  Through every vein the spreading poison rag'd  And with her life could only be asswag'd  DREAD foe to love of human ills the worst  Thou sorest plague with which mankind is curst  In distant climes amongst the savage kind  O hadst thou ever ever been confin'd  Content the wild  Barbarian  to defile  Nor with thy breath prophan'd the  British  isle  SAY muse in strains of elegiack woe  What dire effects from such disasters flow  That the precaution'd reader may beware  And conscious of the mischiefs shun the snare  SOON as it pierces with its subtle dart  The coast of love that weak unguarded part  In doleful sounds the wounded youth complains  Of pungent sores and sharp nocturnal pains  His nerves are all relax'd his eyes grow dim  And rigid aches torture every limb  His hot envenom'd blood corrupts within  And loathsome ulcers stain his fading skin  At length his nose dismantled sinks away  His flesh turns rotten and his bones decay  Too late repentance comes and pills too late  Nor can ev'n MISAUBIN reverse his fate  Living his wholesome friends avoid his sight  And dying he pollutes the realms of night  AGAINST this ill to vary from my tale  But two specifick remedies prevail  Virtue is one and purity of heart  But if the flesh subdues the better part  Another still remains the fam'd  machine  No doubt the reader guesses what I mean  That modern rare device whose injur'd name  Is grown opprobrious though it covers shame  Without this guard if my advice prevail  On venal joys you never will regale  Then against fireships you may stand the test  And trust the warmest nymph  probatum est  SO ancient warriours buckled up in steel  Laugh'd at the drubbings which they could not feel  POOR COBURNE'S fate these sad reflections drew  O most unhappy hapless nymph adieu  Tormenting loss too grievous for the mind  If gentle DUTTON were not left behind  In her surviving charms we find relief  On her soft bosom intermit our grief  The painful hours in soft endearments waste  And in our present joys forget the past  HAIL charming fair O may'st thou ever prove  Free from the bane and pestilence of love  Long may'st thou live a soft luxurious life  By turns of twenty colleges the wife  With charms unfading glut the studious swains  The favourite Toast of all our  Oxford  plains  ON this delighful subject big with praise  How could the muse prolong her wanton lays  Unnumber'd beauties equally divine  Attract her eyes and in her fancy shine  SALACIOUS CHILD the neighb'ring dons em∣brace  And SHEPHARD blesses all the  Cambrian  race  CRASSA with luscious beauties charms the sight  And melts in greasy volumes of delight  In TATHAM'S kitchen as she basts the meat  The  Maudlin  smarts their tender vows repeat  Oft as she plies the saucepan in her hand  The  Lincoln  wits in silent rapture stand  Oft as with whirling arms she winds the jack  They suck the dewy moisture from her neck  The savoury odors from her lips they kiss  And wallow in a drippingpan of bliss  FORGIVE me fair ones who remain unsung  Sound and unsound ye tribe of old and young  To praise you all who swarm in every plain  Would swell my verse beyond an epick strain  Each college stew a volume would require  And BLRE in the tedious task would tire  HENCEFORTH ye sons of  Cam  presumptu∣ous race  No more with us contend for age or place  At length confuted quit the learned field  And to your rival the precedence yield  In times remote before the  Cam  was known  Our  Isis  rear'd her head and gain'd renown  Arts now forgot her temples did adorn  And flourish'd e'er the  Stagyrite  was born  Compar'd with her the  Graecian  state gives way  And  Athens  was a school of yesterday  HENCEFORTH in arts and knowledge vye no more  But with you sister the dispute give o'er  Let CLARKE to learning all pretensions quit  And captious BENTLEY to DELAUNE submit  No more let NEWTON his discoveries boast  But own himself in greater SHIPPEN lost  Let HOADLEY to SACHEVEREL yield the prize  Nor against POTTER in contension rise  HAIL honour'd madam hail for arts renown'd  Through ev'ry age with ivy garlands crown'd  Who from a thousand bubbies never dry  Dost with pure milk a thousand babes supply  Great  Britain  's mothernurse accept these lays  Which an adopted son in duty pays  Who oft has heard with conscious grief and shame  Licentious wits insult thy reverend name  Who oft has seen them with indignant rage  Laugh at thy silver hairs and wrinkled age  Urg'd by these wrongs in her dear mother's cause  Weak as she is the muse officious draws  And in these grateful lines attempts to shew  What publick honours to her name are due  Resolv'd at least on daring wings to play  And to some greater genius point the way  MEAN while this verse shall consecrate my name  And ev'n with  Blackmore  's ALFRED vye for fame  The present age my labours shall reward  And  Britain  stile me the  religious Bard  The future age a sumptuous pile shall raise  And croud the wall with monumental praise  Erect above shall stand the marble bust  Beneath the sacred urn shall hold my dust  FAME on the right her constant watch shall keep  And ALMA on the left dejected weep  Wreaths and festoons the labour'd stone shall grace  And this inscription fill the middle space  "  Rear'd at the publick cost this stately shrine  "  Does the choice ashes of a bard confine  "  Who in the first prevailing  GEORGE'S  days  "  Tun'd his old  British  harp to  ALMA'S  praise  "  And in a course of bold scholastick rhimes  "  Dar'd all the insults of those factious times  "  While marble can endure this hallow'd stone  "  Shall guard his dust and make his virtues known  "  When that decays his fame shall still survive  "  And in the duteous work for ages live  "  When that work dyes let harden'd sinners fear  "  For then the world's eternal doom is near  "  Reader from  OXFORD  if you chance to "come  "  Shed a few tears o'er his selected tomb  "  Nor ask his name but be content to know  "  That for a pious wit your grateful sorrows "flow  POSTSCRIPT
