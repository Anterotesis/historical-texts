 MERIT A POEM INSCRIBED TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP EARL OF CHESTERFIELD  By Mr HENRY JONES Author of the  Earl of Essex  LONDON  Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  Pallmall  And SOLD by M COOPER in  Paternosterrow  MDCCLIII  MERIT A POEM  THOU sacred Title to the Voice of Fame  The Heroe's Passportnay the Coward's Claim  The Patriot's high Pretence the Villain's Boast  The Churchman's deep Disguise the Coxcomb's Toast  The Fop's affected Mask which Dullness gave  A Vizor fitted for the Fool or Knave  Courted by all Men while by few possess'd  And honour'd only in the virtuous Breast  Celestial Beam that brightens all above  And fills with Demigods the Court of  Jove    Immortal MERIT to my Aid descend  Let Fancy fire let Truth my Verse attend  On Truth's eternal Base thy Trophies raise  Let Honesty to Heaven exalt thy Praise  Let Art let Genius on that Ground conspire  Let gen'rous Pride the panting Bosom fire  To mount to Glory on the Heights of Fame  And build on Truth an everlasting Name  Wheree'er Creation's ample Round displays  Nature's vast Works and Wisdom's wond'rous Ways  Wide as the World's Expanse the Bounds of Space  Where various Forms are deck'd with various Grace  Wheree'er the plastic Energy appears  In Mites conspicuous or th' extended Spheres  Th' ambitious Soul the searching Mind of Man  Wou'd sketch the Parts wou'd group the glorious Plan  The reas'ning Insect swells with strong Desire  And shares a Portion of Celestial Fire  Those favour'd Few in whom the Sparks divine  By Heaven's inspiring Breath are taught to shine  Who trace the winding Tracts where Comets roll  Who poize the Planets and who grasp the Pole  On NEWTON's Wings the Solar Walk survey  Look down on Worlds and lose this fading Day  On Wisdom's Steps to Wisdom's Fountain soar  And in th' Effect th' eternal Cause adore  Or stoop with LOCKE the Gleams of Thought to scan  The Infant's dawning Ray the Noon of Man  Whose Logic Line the Depths of Reason found  It's vast Expanse it's close contracted Bound  Whose guiding Hand th'ideal Blank explores  And opens wide the Senses' various Doors  Thro' which the thronging Thoughts their Passage find  In social Tribes and stock the peopled Mind  Where Fancy Judgment Passion soar so high  That Wit and Arts and Vanity supply  Opinions there their hostile Schemes commence  And wage an endless War with Truth and Sense  What aweful Sage displays yon sacred Lore  Behold him turn all Nature's Treasures o'er  Disclose the Funds whence Truths seraphic spring  And reach his Maker on an Insect's Wing  Behold him sink where Wisdom's Secrets sleep  Or weigh the Winds or sound th' unfathom'd Deep  'Mid Coral Groves and Gems of various Dyes  Ten thousand Wonders op'ning to his Eyes  Through Ocean Earth and Air and Heav'n pursue  The mystic Scale and trace th' eternal Clue  By Meekness rais'd by Love of Truth inspir'd  By Pride untouch'd his raptur'd Soul aspir'd  He soar'd abstracted in his glorious Toil  Gave Earth a guiding Starand Heav'n a BOYLE  To Names like these the World must Homage pay  And Malice at their Feet her Vipers lay  Detraction dazzled at a Beam so bright  Must drop her Gall and sink to endless Night  Triumphant Truth on Virtue's Wings shall fly  And Fame for ever soar and Envy die  What art Thou say whence doth thy Vigour spring  What plumes O Genius thy seraphic Wing  Extatic Vision op'ning to the View  A thousand Transports and for ever new  Come sacred Inmate come thou glorious Guest  Take large Possession of my lab'ring Breast  Fill all my Faculties with Warmth divine  And let one Ray of STANHOPE's Flame be mine  But ah a solemn Silence fills the Plain  The Birds are dumb  Britannia  sighs in vain  Majestic  Thames  his Murmurs heard no more  Rolls listless now his Wave by  Greenwich  Shore  The Muse in vain would court her STANHOPE's Ear  In vain would Harmony sollicit there  That sacred Passage to the Throne of Sense  Is barr'd by Fate and Converse banish'd thence  That sweet Exchange of Soul by Reason made  Enrich'd by Wisdom and by Words convey'd  Where freighted Thought her treasur'd Wealth bestows  Where Fancy brightens and where Friendship glows  Behold each Muse her plaintive Lyre lay by  The silent Graces must their Notes supply  In mute Proportion's solitary Smile  The story'd Canvas and the Classic Pile  The Clouds in Gold array'd that Heav'n adorn  The setting Evening and the rising Morn  With all that  Vision  to rich  Fancy  lends  Must make my STANHOPE's widdow'd Soul amends  Look down ye Angels that conduct the Spheres  And fill with Heavenly Notes his raptur'd Ears  Attune that social Inlet heal that Mind  'Tis Virtue's Wish the Wish of Human Kind  Rise Inspiration Goddess of those Cells  Where Fancy fledges and where Genius dwells  Reveal at once thy mystic Stores to Sight  Thy Worldcreating Force thy wond'rous Light  Which lifts the Heart on Raptures all refin'd  And leaves its mortal Dross far far behind  Those sordid Dregs that damp th' AEtherial Wing  Which else above the Stars to Heav'n would spring  Its native Homefrom whence all MERITS flow  That Angels love and Mortals reach below  The Patriot's stedfast Soul his firm Design  The Priest's unblemish'd Warmth his Plan Divine  The Lawyer's honest Heart the titled Truth  In  Lord Chief Justice of the CommonPleas in  Ireland  SINGLETON's Decline in  Lord Viscount  Charlemont  now on his Travels  CAUFIELD's Youth  The polish'd Worth in  The Right Hon  George Greenvill  Esq  GREENVILL's Soul we find  In  Jocelyn  Lord Chancellor of  Ireland  JOCELYN's Justice and in  The Hon  Richard Mountney  Esq  one of the Barons of the Exchequer in  Ireland  MOUNTNEY's Mind  Where Station stoops to Friendship's holy Tie  Where Friendship lifts that Station still more high  Shall WALDEGRAVE's Worth adorn the grateful Line  WALDEGRAVE in Senates form'd and Courts to shine  Tho' rais'd by Virtue Birth and Pow'r on high  He stoops still gracious like the bending Sky  To low Desert indulgent and serene  Grace in his Smile and Goodness in his Mien  Distinguish'd Chief whom  Britain  plac'd so near  Her Hope her Bliss and all she holds most dear  Her rising Glory and her guiding Star  In Peace her Pillar and her Shield in War  Illustrious Youth in whose propitious Face  The princely Virtues dawn of all thy Race  Thy godlike Race by Heav'n itself design'd  The Friends of Freedom Truth and Human Kind  I see the rising Years in white Array  At distant Periods wait thy promis'd Sway  Lo Time exults and in his joyful Train  Behold the Blessings of a  Brunswick  's Reign  See smiling Peace her Olive Branch extends  See busy Commerce on her Step attends  Her Flag aloft by  Britain  's Genius borne  See wanton Plenty pour her teeming Horn  See ruddy Health with naked Bosom bound  See warlike Vigour drink the martial Sound  From Pole to Pole see GEORGE's Thunder fly  Whilst Ocean's Trident at his Feet shall lie  Now Taste shall thrive now Arts sublime shall soar  Now ev'ry Science teem with ev'ry Lore  Proud Sculptors there eternal Trophies show  See Painting here in Heavenly Visions glow  Athens  shall yield to  Britain  now the Prize  And  Rome  through Envy turn aside her Eyes  The World shall wonder  Gallia  's self shall gaze  And  Lewis  ' less than GEORGE's glory praise  True Heroes now and Patriots shall appear  Like my TYRAWLEY lov'd to Taste still dear  One Hand the Pen and one shall wield the Spear  In  William Melmoth  Esq  celebrated for his Translation of  Pliny'  s Epistles and other rks  MELMOTH's Heart each social Virtue charms  Each Grace still guides him and each Muse still warms  From his rich Pen the  Roman  Genius flows  See  Pliny  's Soul through ev'ry Period glows  See Classic Beauties deck the polish'd Page  Where Sense sublime where brilliant Wit engage  With soft Humanity the ravish'd Mind  In him the Gems of  Greece  and  Rome  we find  With native Beams with added Lustre bright  Immortal  Tully  next shall charm my Sight  Come forth great Sage in all thy Pow'r confess'd  By MELMOTH's Hand in  English  Splendor dress'd  Come forth at once to charm me and surprize  To fill my Soul and bless my ravish'd Eyes  'Tis doneand yet thy Country still demands  A nobler Tribute at thy grateful Hands  Enrich her Bosom from thy native Store  Thy latent Treasures and intrinsic Ore  And needless toil in foreign Mines no more  Thy  James Tilson  Esq  a Gentleman distinguished for fine Taste and companionable Talents  TILSON joys thy various Wreath to see  Can I forget him for he gave me thee  Himself a Genius born aloft to shine  Himself a Friendand let me call him mine  With these my  M Morgan  Esq  a young Gentleman of the  Temple  design'd for the Bar  MORGAN shall thy Merits stand  Lo Fame already bears thee in her Hand  Already lifts thee to the public View  And gives thy Genius and thy Worth their Due  Thy  Tully  courts thee in thy native Tongue  Tully  whose Godlike Flame thy Muse hath sung    Whose  Latian  Lore thou long hast made thy own  To thee his secret Soul his hidden Strength are known  By him accomplish'd wage the vocal War  And wield his Thunder at the l ostile Bar  The Healthrestoring Power that conquers Pain  In  Dr  Edward Barry  an eminent Physician in  Dublin  Barry's learned Breast and Heart humane  O'er Maladies malignant Strength prevails  The Man oft cures us when the Med'cine fails  Wide is the Field where MERIT tries her Force  Painful the Steeps and various is the Course  When Nature starting in her Fervor prides  When Glory goads us and when Virtue guides  The Mimic Arts at first from Heav'n we stole  To fill the fairest Mansions of the Soul  On them Ambition to her Throne ascends  Whilst ev'ry Kindred Grace her Queen attends  By Turns approach her and by Turns retire  The Muse is oft'nest nearher Notes inspire  The noblest Passions to the noblest Ends  For Verse and Virtue were of old good Friends  Hail sacred Art distinguish'd and divine  The sweetest sounding Trump of Fame is thine  Thine are the Wreaths which Time shall ne'er decay  When breathing Brass when Marble waste away  Immortal Register of all that's great  Above the Strokes of Chance the Frowns of Fate  With Nature born descending from the Sky  With Worlds coeval nor with Worlds shall die  For ever young who Time himself shall tire  And smile secure amid the general Fire  Great Queen of Harmony who guides the Spheres  Who weds the circling Orbs who rules the Years  Thy Magic sways the Mind and charms the Thought  And all the Soul's by thy Enchantment caught  When Hope when Fear when Love when Anguish stand  And Terror takes her Tremor from thy Hand  When Pity melts us at thy potent Call  And at thy Nod the Passions rise and fall  In OTWAY's Strains what Soulfelt Sorrows flow  What pow'rful Pathos and what various Woe  Through each endearing Tie each tender Breast  The Wife the Father and the Friend distress'd  Whilst each good Heart by kindred Anguish wrung  Throbs to the Transports of a BARRY's Tongue  Whose Voice whose Look whose Air and Action join'd  Rend the hard Heart and melt the pitying Mind  Behold  Othello  rage by Frenzy fir'd  When jealous Love when Fiends when Fate conspir'd  To rack his tortur'd Thoughts ten thousand Ways  What dread Variety each Stroke displays  Still to my Sight in Fancy's Mirror seen  With all the Energy of Voice and Mien  Still BARRY's Force o'erwhelms my shrinking Heart  And to Reflection's Eye still acts the Part  In  Jaffier  next behold him soar to Fame  And nextlet others speak th' applauded Name  I blush to sing what his high Worth demands  Yet ask a thousand Hearts and Tongues and Hands  Whose loud Applauses reach'd the distant Spheres  Or better thank'd him with their silent Tears  In SHAKESPEAR's Scenes what Tempests tear the Heart  How Nature trembles and her Functions start  The shrihking Spirits to their Source retire  Or furious rush and set the Soul on fire  When Action animates the vast Design  When Sound when Motion swells the rapid Line  When Nature's utmost Stretch when Art conspire  In GARRICK's wond'rous Force in SHAKESPEAR's Fire  Lo Terror triumphs with each Grace combin'd  And dread Astonishment usurps the Mind  Each Look each Gesture and each Muscle speaks  Each Limb each Nerve the fierce Infection takes  The kindling Energy it's Force displays  'Till all the Man is one continued Blaze  To reach the Summit of the last Sublime  The highest Cliff that human Strength can climb  At once to reach it and so well maintain  Is yours whilst others toil and stretch with Pain  On Arts slowdragging aukward Stilts to rise  Your soaring Genius sweeps the vaulted Skies  Whether the Buskin or the Sock you wear  As gay in  Ranger  as distress'd in  Lear    In  Drugger  's Tremor as in  Hamlet  's Fire  The Protean Skill of Action we admire  The Eagle thus that wheels aloft in Air  Can sudden stoop and truss the trembling Hare  Play round the Rock or skim the level Plain  Then instant spring and mount to Heav'n again  The moral Character's the Test indeed  Where Fame should triumph and the Man succeed  That glorious Attribute for Virtue calls  And must be honbur'd when the Curtain falls  When Death's dark Curtain drops its Shade between  The judging Audience and the closing Scene  When Time impartial scans the naked Cause  When Truth shall give or Censure or Applause  Come forth my Friend confess'd to public Sight  And let us view thee in this sacred Light  How Malice can accuse how Envy swell  You stand convicted Sirfor you excel  That deadly Crime  Desert  must still endure  Your Morals censur'd shall your Fame secure  Your Morals toois that their desp'rate Aim  What CA'NDISH lovesnor noble BOYLE can blame  That aweful Censor both of Books and Men  Whose Life's as faultless as his learned Pen  To Truth attach'd from servile Byas free  Wou'd speak that Truth to Kings he speaks to me  His Heart ingenuous as the Source of Day  Heedless what Madmen dream or Dunces say  Collected in his conscious Worth withdraws  And leaves to Fools the Squabble for Applause  Go on still envy'd let your Foes still gaze  Whilst  Britain  gives you Wealth and  Europe  Praise  Be still applauded by the Wise and Great  And make your Fortune and your Fame compleat  Till sated with Renown in Life's Decline  Amid the Muses Shades retir'd you shine  Shelter'd by Laurels which your Worth has won  Calm and serene like CIBBER's setting Sun  The END
