assuescite Bella  Neu Patriae Validas in vicera vertite vires  VIRG  Kind Patrons take this Poem in good Part  And spare bad Numbers for an honest Heart  ROWE  LONDON Printed for W BICKERTON in the  Temple Exchange  opposite St  Dunstan  's Church  Fleetstreet  MDCCXLV  A Speech of Lord  Hastings  in ROWE'S JANE SHORE  "REMEMBER him the Villain righteous Heaven  "In thy great Day of Vengeance Blast the Traitor  "And his pernicious Councels who for Wealth  "For Power the Pride of Greatness or Revenge  "Would plunge his native Land in Civil Wars  "Have we so soon forgot those Days of Ruin  "When  York  and  Lancaster  drew forth their Battles  "When like a Matron butcher'd by her Sons  "And cast beside some common Way a Spectacle  "Of Horror and Affright to Passers by  "Our groaning Country bled at every Vein  "When Murders Rapes and Massacrees prevail'd  "When Churches Palaces and Cities blas'd  "When Insolence and Barbarism triumph'd  "And swept away Distinction Peasants trod  "Upon the Necks of Nobles low were laid  "The reverend Crosier and the holy Mitre  "And Desolation cover'd all the Land  "Who can remember this and not like me  "Here vow to sheath a Dagger in his Heart  "Whose damn'd Ambition would renew those Horrors  "And set once more that Scene of Blood before us  To the Candid Reader  AFTER a Series of Misfortunes and meeting with the most ungenerous Treatment from some whom I least suspected and least deserv'd it from I feel the additional Grievance of being a Prisoner in the  Fleet  tho' I have assign'd Two Thirds of my future Salary for the Payment of my Debts if my Creditors will be so good to allow me Liberty to work for them as well as myself While I seem to complain of Want of Lenity in some Gratitude obliges me to acknowledge the Favour shewn me by others as Several whose Demands on me are largest have not only the Humanity to come into this Proposal themselves but have endeavour'd to instil the same generous Sentiments into the rest Yet a few are unkind enough to have continu'd me for these five Months past in a Place where I am incapable of geting Bread either for myself or Children The Mind may be free tho' the Body's confin'd as a Proof of which I employ'd a little of my Leisure in the few following Lines If they in any Degree prove acceptable to the Publick I am over pay'd  My Impatience to attest my Loyalty and Affection to the Person of his Majesty and the present Establishment may perhaps make me too quick in the Publication of what I have thus loosely thrown on Paper and the Consciousness of my Inability to perfect the Task I have undertaken require some Apology Let the Honesty of the Intention plead my Excuse If I am found to be a good Subject I'll not repine at being thought an indifferent Poet I think at this Juncture it becomes not an  Englishman  to be totally silent unwatchful or inactive Neutrality at this Crisis is a Crime And may we not reasonably suspect those Gentry are not quite sound of Heart who like their politick Friend  Scrub  in the  Stratagem  resolve  "to say nothing till they're sure of a Peace"  THE ASSOCIATION OR  LIBERTY  and  LOYALTY    WRONGS to redress and Justice to maintain  Has been the Business of our Sovereign's Reign  The Injur'd from Oppression's Sword to save  To punish Vice and to reward the Brave  His Subjects from Invasions to defend  And his Allies in their Distress befriend  Unbiass'd to assert the general Good  For  Europe  's Safety to  expend his Blood  To fix the Ballance of her Power his View  That golden Point unerring to pursue  Was the first End that Providence design'd  When for Benificence she form'd his Mind  Well this appear'd when  Gallic  Arms of late  Join'd with  Bavarian  threaten'd  Europe  's Fate  Hungaria  's Princess desolate remain'd  Her Legions slaughter'd and her Treasures drain'd  When her Allies fraternal were afraid  To send that Queen her stipulated Aid  Touch'd with Compassion  generous Brunswick  came  And poiz'd the Balance steady on the Beam  Thousands of  Gauls  lay stretch'd along the Plain  Thousands were drown'd repassing thro' the  Mayne    And while those  Gauls  precipitately ran  They hop'd more Mercy from the Deep than Man  So when a  Priestrid Tyrant  heretofore  The  Papal Power  attempted to restore  Soon as he saw  brave Nassau  's Troops advance  He fled for Refuge to the Arms of  France    O may  our Monarch  still by Deeds the same  Protect this Kingdom gain a deathless Name  And with  immortal William  share  immortal Fame    While  England  's Safety  George  's Thoughts controul  The fav'rite in felt Impulse of his Soul  That Trade may flourish Peace may be restor'd  HE to the  Empire  gives a  Sovereign Lord    Nor Toil nor Treasure spares Yet strange to tell  A ranc'rous Rebel Rabble Rout from Hell  Flatter'd by  Rome  cajol'd by treach'rous  France    Our fertil Fields to waste with hasty Strides advance  A medley mischiefmaking motley Crew  Unhos'd unbreech'dsome shodbut those how few  Begot by Rapes by Rapine fed they prove  Without Wit wicked Lustful without Love  Of mongrel  French  and  Scotch  a Mixture bad  Halfblooded and crossbred from Sires run mad  Train'd in Hypocrisy that impious Evil  They  God  affront yet meanly fear the  Devil  Lawless Banditti who abandon'd dare  Miscall base Robbery and foul Murder War  Tyrants at heart ungenerously brave  They fight not to protect but to enslave  Should they succeed which Heaven avert their Fate  Now mark how just which they'll repent too late  Frantic foolhardy bigotblinded Elves  The Snares for others laid entrap themselves  To glut the Malice and the Pride they come  Of  Paris Madrid  and insatiate  Rome    Now all their papal Puppetshews display'd  That tinsel'd Trump'ry which supports their Trade  Monks  teach deluded Mortals to believe  They merit Heav'n who Hereticks deceive  "Again religious Fires prepare to shine  "And Inquisitions plead their Right Divine"  England  provok'd now feels one generous Soul  Inspires each honest Heart to loyalize the Whole  From  northern Tweed  far as the  eastmost Thames    A PatriotPassion every Breast inflames  The  healthy Hunters  whose high mettled Blood  Late swept the Vale or beat the neighb'ring Wood  To chase the  wily Fox  quick catch th' Alarm  Themselves their  Tenants  and their  Huntsmen  arm  In full Career their Coursers scour the Plain  To seek a  more pernicious savage Train    The  Farmer  strait unyokes the generous Steed  Who from his tramel'd Harness being freed  Snuffs up the Air and jocund neighs aloud  Of his new Trappings and arm'd Master proud  Both find their Bosoms with new Spirit fill'd  And march to guard the Lands they lately till'd  Divines  and  Nobles Gentry Merchants All    Chearful associate  at their  Country  's Call  Without Distinction dauntless issue forth  To dare the  Desparadoes  of the  North    O thou great God of Battles stretch thy Hand  All pow'rful

 Nor let dire Faction more this happy Realm divide  FINIS
