 THE Beau's Duel OR A SOLDIER FOR THE LADIES A Comedy As it is Acted at the New Theater in  LincolnsInnFields  BY Her MAJESTIES SERVANTS  LONDON  Printed for  D Brown  at the  Black Swan  and  N Cox  at the  Golden Bible  next  PaulsgraveHeadCourt  without  TempleBar    TO Samuel Brown  Esq  OF  StockingHall  IN RUTLAND  SIR  YOung Authors like young Wives are lyable to distrust their own Conduct in every thing and whilst they fear venturing too far are apt to stop short and rob their Benefactors of those Acknowledgments they justly deserve Or by useing too loose a Rein unavoidably  run into Adulation But I need fear neither of these Censures since your Modesty which is so conspicuous will pardon one and your Character be a sufficient defence against t'other for 'tis impossible to say more of you than you deserve  To attempt your Character wou'd be too daring an Undertaking For what Pen besides your own cou'd express that just Thought lively Fancy flowing and easy Language that adorn those Pieces which like inestimable Jewels too valuable for common use are reserv'd for the Entertainment of your happy Friends Your luckly Genius in Poetry and your peculiar tast for Musick proclaim you the Muses Darling for you they reserve their choicest Favours And indeed without such Qualifications no Man can have a true Relish for Productions of this kind and the most Excellent Pieces wou'd be entertain'd with Coldness and Contempt  How I have perform'd in the following Scenes is neither possible nor proper for me to determine 'tis Praise enough that you have given me leave to lay it at your Feet which I prefer before the vain Applause of clapping Multitudes nor cou'd I ever excuse it either to the World or my self if I slipt any opportunity of publishing the Honour you do me 'Tis a Vanity we are all lyable to and we glory in the Excellencies of our Patron Besides the advantage 'tis a piece of Justice due to this Poem and my self to fly for Sanctuary to one who is most apt to Pardon because the most capable to Judge and has himself not only approv'd but also by his inimitable Performance Corrected and Refin'd upon the most pleasant parts of Poetry  To conculde Sir for I wou'd above all things avoid being too Prolix give me leave to joyn my hearty Wishes with  the rest of Mankind for your long continuing as you are a great Incourager and principle Ornament of all Polite Literature and Gentile Accomplishments to the unspeakable Happiness of all your Friends among whom to find a place is the highest Ambition of  Sir  Your most Oblig'd most Obedinent and

Enter Colonel  Manly  Colonel  HOW do Men labour to fool themselves What Pains did I spare or Excuse did I not invent to perswade my Friends I was going another way to get rid of their troublesome Ceremony that wou'd have waited on me home and all this for an Opportunity only of taking a Turn or two before this Window  Oh Love How powerful are thy Charms thus to unman and send me like a Boy gaping after Imaginary Joys  Not all the Hazards of a Soldier's Life cou'd half so much assect me as the dreadful Apprehension of displeasing this Girl  Whatever I do whether I Eat or Drink whether I Sleep or Wake whether I'm at home alone or abroad in Company my Thoughts are still of her She's always present I can see nothing  but her I can hear nothing but her I can think of nothing but her and in short I care for nothing but her  'Tis Happiness enough for any Man to love and be beloved by such a Woman She's so Beautiful so Agreeable and so Loving yet so Virtuous so Ch  st and so Constant that it her Fathers rigid Opposition were remov'd nothing cou'd add to the Blessing lyes in store for me  Enter Capt  Bellmein  goes within two or three yards of the door then stops short looks up  Capt  Ho this must be the HouseBut what the Devil am I the better for't the Doors are lock'd Windows bar'd my Mistress asleep and I may return like an Ass as I came without so much as being dream'd ofCan Love that never fails his Votaries at a pinch inspire no Stratagem now Egad I was never more able to offer him a plentiful Sacrifice and did my Mistress know with what warm Desires I come she'd meet me half way or she deserves to dye a Maid  Col  The more I think I still perplex my self the more like a poor Fly in a Spiders Web by labouring to get loose I work my self faster in the Toyl  And why shou'd I struggle any longer with what I can't master or desire to be without what I'm perswaded is the greatest Blessing in the World  I'm resolv'd I will Love on  Turns short upon the Captain  Ha a Man and if I mistake not mad  Bellmein  whom I left at the Rose he's upon some Amorous Design but is too open to hide any thing from his Friend I'll accost him  Goodmorrow Captain I commend your early Industry you are choosing some fortify'd piece of Virtue to lay a manly Siege to  Cap  Ha Colonel Goodmorrow to you with all my heart No Faith I never stay the Formality of a Siege 'tis you honourable Lovers are forc'd to undergo that Drudgery whene're I meet any as I rarely do that resist the shock of my first assault I fairly draw off to the next who are sure to surrender upon more easie Terms  Col  So you take all by Storm Plunder the Garrison Fire their Quarters and march off in Triumph  Cap  What I do can't be comprehended by constant p  leing Lovers  They can't bear those strong Joys we suck from our lusty Draughts of Love like weaksighted Birds they fly about in the twilight of Pleasure not able to bear the Meridional Heat and Pleasure of it  One kind glance crowns all your Hopes and raises you to the highest Happiness but then a Frown or sower look Colonel throws you down again to despair So that  Col  Have a care  Captain  how far you launch out in this strain lest you be too like our Modern Widows who exclaim most against a second Husband when they are just upon the point of having one  Cap  So that from my laughing at honourable Lovers as you call them you wou'd learnedly infer I am one my self  Col  Nay Railery apart it has been seriously observ'd that you are  Cap  What  Col  Very much alter'd of late  Cap  How Faith I think my self the same Man I have the same Appetites the same Desires that ever I had  Col  Ay but you saunter about in Solitary places avoid your Acquaintance and when you can't escape them art more uneasie than a rich Miser with a borrowing Friend And here now I find you out of your way addressing your self to senceless Wood and Stone  Cap  Ay my Friend but this senseless Wood includes a more beautiful  Daphne  than e're the Delian God pursued a Girl so bright so sparkling and what recommends her much more to me so coming  Embraces him  that had she liv'd in the days of  Venus  she wou'd have rival'd that Goddess and outdone her too in her own Attributes  Col  Have a care you don't misplace your Worship for to my particular knowledge no such Person lodges in this House  Cap  To my more particular knowledge such a Person does lodge in this House and in the Room that looks out at that Window too  Col  Ha  Clarinda  lodges there 'tis true but that she's such as he describes is falseYet she's a Woman and where Dissembling grows so much in use Perfection must be a Stranger I'll for a while lay by the implicit Lover for the more inquisitive jealous Man and try him farther  Aside  Well I may be deceiv'd but how do you know you are not so too  Cap  Why Faith since I know you to be an honest Fellow and a Man of Honour I don't care if I trust you with the Secret upon condition your assistance shan't be wanting upon occasion  Col  'Slife I shall be drewn in to help him away with my Mistress  Aside  If she be such as you describe I believe you will have no great occasion for help But to the purpose  Cap  Why you must know that in this House lives a dam'd Positive illnatu  'd old Fellow  Col  I know it too well or by this time his Daughter had been out of your reach  Aside  Cap  And that there's a young Lady his Daughter Neice or something  Col  A  very probable What then  Cap  Way that  my  er  that's all  Col  H  w do you know this  Cap  Know it I have in  llible signs of it she makes Assignations with me and kee  s them receive my Addresses L  ters and Songs nay sings 'em too and if these ben't signs she likes me the Devil's in't  Col  Well but her NameI'll yet believe  Clarinda  Innocent and 'tis some one else he mistakes for her  Aside  Cap  Nay now faith Collonel you are unreasonable you know 'tis not fair to tell Names  Col  Not tell me her Name then I shall think you trin'd with me all this while and scorn the Friendship I offer  Cap  I'll rather tell you all I know but as for her Name Faith and Troth I know no more hers than she does mine her desire to be unknown her self made her the less pressing I suppose so that we freely pass amongst our selves for  Celadon  and  Cloe  as you may see by this Song if you'll be at the pains of Reading it 'tis the last I sent her and tho' inconsiderable in it self receives from her Voice inestemable value  Col  O' my Soul the very Song I heard  Clarinda  sing 'tis she past all doubt  Cap  What at a stand  Colonel  ha  What means all this Concern  Col  'Tis for you my Friend that Woman you admire I know to be the most Cun  ing Treacherous false Dissembler nay worse if worse can be in the World I wou'd advise you to proceed with Caution for Husbands  Captain  too late Repent when they can't quit the ill  Cap  if it be only my danger that disturbs you I'll soon ease you of that  ouble Marriage is not the Course I Stear we never admit  o sour a thought to turn our more pleasant Conversation▪  Col  ow not Marry What then does all this tend to  Cap  Phoo that's unreasonable again why nothing nothing but a little harmless Mirth or so  Col  On my Soul he designs to Debauch her  Aside  Cap  Ha the  Colonel  in his dumps again there's something in  don't    Aside  Col  Harkee  Captain  I know you have Courage and  took you for a  of honour therefore think i  worth my while to tell you this Woman you have been so free  I have a  ime lov'd therefore expect you'  give me  of what you have said o  meet me with your  word and so I  your self f  r which you  most proper      Cap  y da  I Have I b  n all this while making a  o  my  to the only  'em from  made  im so  Friendship  may be  I'll undertake to make out what I've s  id  Col  Upon  you Friend again but if you shou'd  you had  ook to it  Cap  Here's some Company comin  this way let's  etire till they pass then I'll tell you our whole Intreigne and leave you to judge whether I have reason to think as I do  They withdraw  Enter Sir  William Mode  Sir Will  Reviere    L  ric  Sir Sir  Will  Blister me if you don't speak plain  English  I shall have the World think I'm such a sloven as to keep an  English  Valet Do you hear if you don't Mini  k 'em better I shall tu  n you away  L Rev  Me vil take al de ca  e imaginable Sir  Sir Will  Very well Is the Musick all come  L Rev  Y  ss Sire here be de Fi  le de H  uthois de Cou  tel and de Base Vial dey be all despose for to receive your Command  Sir Will  'Tis very w  lld'hear do you Marshal them in order before this Window and see they be ready to strike up as soon as I give the Word  The  Colonel  and  Captain  appears  Cap  What the Devil's here another Lover What think you now  Colonel  your Mistress m  st be more than Woman if she can hold out against such a formal Seige  Col  This  op I know too well to be jealous of and know her so far from encouraging him that her Fathers Authority which countenances him can scarce procure him Common Civility from her  Cap  Hist the thing opens  Sir Will  Well 'tis an unspeakable Happiness we Men of parts  enjoy above the rest of Mankind By our good Management we make our access to every thing we admire easy and certain How many thickskul'd Fellows are content to dream of their Mistresses while I take a more secure Method and wake her in the Morning with Harmonious Musick  I wonder how the Ladies can suffer these Idle Fellows that take no more Pains to please them for my own part I believe I have something extraordinary in me that makes me so acceptable to all the Women I come in Company withWell Musick  I hope you will all show your selves Masters in your Performance come strick up Ah Merciful  Apollo  what a hideous noise you make there's a found fitter to storm a Breach with than approach a Ladies slumbers Play some soft Air a consort of Flutes wou'd have done well  While the Musick plays he uses a great many odd postures seeing the door open the Musick ceases and he runs to meet  Lucinda's  Maid  Coll  How the Door open  Sir Will  Ha my dear Angel How does my Goddess receive my Morning Sacrifice  Flo  As she does every thing that comes from the incomparable Sir  William Mode  with particular Marks of favour in Private tho' she's oblig'd to lay great restraint on her Carriage in Publick to appear cold to him  Sir Will  But methinks she need not be so reserv'd since I have her Fathers Consent  Flo  Ay 'tis that makes her so for his cross humour shou'd she show the Affection she realy has for you wou'd make him run counter to what he so eagerly pursues now out of meer Opposition For he never oppos'd Colonel  Manly  till she express'd some liking for him and now she fears shou'd she own her Love for you 'twou'd prove as fatal to her hopes therefore begs you by me to take all Indifference in publick for perticular marks of favour  Sir Will  Well I'll take your Advice and sweet Mrs  Flora  let me intreat you to accept of this small acknowledgement for favours I have receiv'd by your means  Flo  Oh Lord Sir I vow I'm asham'd but I shall be always ready to do you good Offices with my Lady Sir your Servant  Exit  Sir Will  Adieu Angelhere Musick strick up a merry ramble and lead to my Lodgings  Exit  Col  O Woman Woman Now Friend I believe all you said and a great deal more yet who cou'd expect with so much Beauty  such ug  y falshood For thee or any Man she might have some plea but this sign of a Man to fall so low argues a very deprav'd Appetite S'death I can't bear the thoughts on't  Cap  Have a little Patience and every small discovery will help you forward to your lost Liberty Before to Morrow Night I'll lay such convincing proofs before your Eyes as shall infallibly compleat your Cure  Col  What's here another Serenade More Lovers yet  Enter  Toper  Singing  The Devil a bit care I for a Wit  So I have but Wine and a Fire  A Wench when I please my Passion to case  The Devil a Wise I desire  Cap  Ha ha Drunken  Toper  Reeling home after a Nights deboach sure he's no Lover 'twou'd be impossible for the Blind god to find his heart for the fumes of Wine besides 'tis so indifferent to every thing else there's no taking it but with a Bottle  Col  Ha  Toper  thou holdest thy own yet I see  Top  Colonel  good Morrow I wish you hold your own Boy for I met a thing in the next Street may chance undermine your foundation one who says he can do more in one Night than you in all the days of the Week  Col  What do you mean  Top  Why I met Sir  VVilliam Mode  big with success returning from  Clarinda  who he says encourages his address in private and only favours you in publick to egg her Father on to Consumation with him and this he purchas'd with a Serenade  Col  S'death does he boast of his success and must my Misfortune be the subject of the Coxcomb's Railery Am I publish'd to the World as a blind for his designs Hell and Furies 'tis not to be born I'll after him immediately and were every Vanity about him a  Hercules  I'd force my way thro' them all to stop that foul breath of his  Going  Cap  Hold hold you will but widen the Sore you design to heal 'twill be no hard matter from the Coxcomb's fruitful Impertinence to take another occasion for quarreling and then pay old scores or if it be my luck first to meet the opportunity you may be sure I'll throw in a hearty Thrust for you  Top  Nay Sir you may save your self the labour of quarreling for he won't answer Expectation I asure you  Cap  A Coward Nay then he shall dance a minute the length of the Street while I beat time upon his backside  Col  Hang him he's not worth our Resentment Prithee  Toper  what is he for I have but barely seen him  Toper  In the first place he's a meer Compound of Powder Paint and Affectation so persum'd you may smell him a Mile he thinks every Woman in Love with him and will allow no Man to claim a share in ought above a Chambermaid or stand in Competition with his Parts or Person  Cap  And yet not fight say you  Toper  Fight no no he hates the sight of a drawn Sword as much as I do that of an empty Bottle He will sometimes pretend to Courage as some Women will to Honour and Honesty tho' their Inclinations tend to neither no more than mine to Matrimony He has  l  a Year which he spends in Intrigues sine Cloths and Musick And he has always as many Fiddlers at his heels as a general Officers at his  Lovee  Col  Whose attendance is better rewarded I fancy no doubt they taste the Fruits of their labours sweetly  Toper  I'my Conscience I believe they deserve it for who becomes his Favourite must use as many Complements as wou'd purchase a Maidenhead tho' the Womans design was Marriage Oh that Fortune shou'd be so liberal to such a Fool when so many honest  ellows sit in a Coffeehouse all the Evening for want of Money to go to the Tavern  Col  Riches are the common Chance of Knaves and Fools Fortune is rarely favourable to a Man of Sense 'tis with difficulty and danger they purchase a Smile from that Fickle Mistress but Fools are still her care  I shall take more notice of this Fellow the next time I see him  Toper  Which may be this Morning if you will for he just now invited me to an Entertainment of Musick that is to be perform'd at his Chamber by some of the best Masters there will be Champaign Boy  Cap  Will you go Colonel  Col  Not I the Conversation of TownLadies who entertain you with the Opinions of fifty Fools of their Wit and Beauty and how manag'd by them to their ruin wou'd be a thousand times more acceptable to me than the medly Chat of Fops and Fiddlers  Cap  Then you won't go  Col  No I'll expect you at my Lodgings  Ex  Toper  But you will there's Champaign Pox o'the Company  Capt  And Musick too if that be good the Company be hang'd  Ex  Scene changes to  Clarinda  's Lodging in her Father's House  Enter  Clarinda  and her Cousin  Emilia  undress'd as wak'd by the Serenade  Clar  Dear  Emilia  you ask so many questions prithee have some pitty and spare me a little  Em  Dear Cousin do you pitty me and answer me a little  Clar  I have answer'd you these three days you have been in Town more Questions than all the Astrologe  s and Philomaths in  London  cou'd resolve in a month  Em  And I have as many more to ask before I can be satisfied I'd fain know the cause of all this alteration why so much uneasinels and so much Spleen Never pleas'd but when you are displeas'd nor like your Company but when you are alone In short I have observ'd  Clar  What have you observ'd Cousin  Em  Why that your Father is never well but when talking to you of Sir  William  nor you pleas'd but when you are thinking of some body else  Clar  Oh Howinquisitive are Girls  Em  Oh how reserv'd are Lovers  Clar  Prithee Cousin learn to be more Serious  Em  Prithee Cousin learn to be more free  Clar  Then you positively believe I am in Love  Em  Positively  Clar  And with  Em  Anotherguess'd Man than your Father designs for you  Clar  And nothing  Em  Will perswade me to the contrary  Clar  Why then I am and since 'tis in vain to hide it from you  Emilia  I'll try you with that confidence I hitherto thought you too young for  Em  Alas she little thinks I have as great Intrigues of my own as any she can trust me with tho' I have been but three days in Town  Aside  Clar  I am as you see Cousin besieg'd night and day by two as different as night and day one in the head of innumerable Fopperies and Insolencies attacks me with the assurance of a Conqueror before he enters the Field being supported by the harsh Authority of a rigid Father The other after a thousand obsequious Demonstrations of Love at respectful distance courts to be admitted mine rather than seeks to have me his  Em  I'my Conscience were it my case I shou'd not be at a stand which to choose there being such apparent difference  Clar  Nay there is more yet for one is Generous and Brave the other Cowardly and Pittiful one Judicious t'other Impe  tinent  one Const  t  other Whimsical one a Man of Sense t'other a Block  ead one admir'd by all t'other ridicul'd by all  Em  One I suppose is the Gentleman that gave the Serenade Sir  William  of whom I have heard so much since I came to Town but t'other  Clarinda  I fear is no where to be found such Men appear but as they say the Phenix does not above one in an Age  Clar  And that ours has one in him the Judicious part of Mankind bears me witness  Em  Lovers  Clarinda  like People in motion fancy every thing t  ey see moves as they do and may be from the knowledge of your own Principles and Resolutions you from your Notion of hisNow cou'd I almost find in my heart to discover my own Intrigue it'twere only to let her see there are Men that equal if not exceed hers but that I'm asham'd of its forwardness in so snort a time  aside  But how comes it Cousin that we never see this Man  Clar  Before you came to Town my Father forbid him the House with any farther Pretentions to me upon Sir  William  's account to whom his Honour was engag'd before he saw him or else I believe his Follies wou'd have outweigh'd his Estate for he you know  Em  I know too much of him for I have seen him  Clar  So you have t'other too he was one of the two that bow'd to us t'other night from the sidebox and of whom you have since been so inquisitive tho' I never let you into the Secret till now  Em  Of one of those I know a Secret which believe you are a Stranger to and which I wou'd not for the World discover till I know more on't  Aside  If that be he I like him as well as you can but I think a Gentleman of Sir  William  's Estate shou  d not seem to contemptible  Clar  O dear Cousin don't name him  or besides the particular Aversion I have for him 'twould beget in the World a very slender Opinion of my Sense shou'd I encourage such a Fop  Em  O quite contrary for Women of Sense strive to distinguish themselves by their choice of Asses fit to bear their Burdens Besides Cousin if you hate him you can never get it in your power to torment him more than by marrying him  Clar  That would be making my self uneasie purely to trouble another No no I must have some Contrivance to expose him and our Neighbour Mrs  Plotwell  shall help me in it  Em  Does that Lady still continue her Persecution of  ops  Clar  With as much address and success as ever and her pleasant accounts of her feign'd Intreagues makes her very entertaining Company she hates Sir  William Mode  and I am sure will assist in any thing I never had a stronger Temptation to Disobedience than now Love and Merit plead on  Manly  's side Reason too approves my Choice  the other's an empty nothing a meer Talker we'll shew his right side expose him shall we not my Dear  Em  With all my Heart I love Mischief so well I can refuse nothing that farthers that  ACT II  SCENE Sir  William  's Lodgings  Enter Sir  William  in a Nightgown looking in his Glass  Sir Will  THis rising early is the most confounded thing on Earth nothing so destructive to the Complexion Blister me how I shall look in the side box to night wretchedly impair my Vigour  Looking in the Glass all the a bile  Yet it adds something of a languithing Air not altogether unbecoming and by Candlelight may do mischief but I must stay at home to recover some colour and that may be as well laid on too so 'tis resolv'd I will go Oh 'tis an unspeakable Pleasure to be in the side box or crowd to the Stage and be distinguish'd by the Beau's of Quality to have a Lord fly into ones Arms and kiss one as amorously as a Mistress Then tell me aloud that he din'd with his Grace and that he and the Ladies were so fond of me they talk'd of nothing else Then says I my Lord his Grace does me too much HonourThen my LordPox on this Play 'tis not worth seeing we han't been seen at  'other House tonight and the Ladies will be disappointed not to receive a Bow from Sir  William  He he he says I my Lord I'll wait upon your Lordship Then says my Lord Lead the way Sir  VVilliam  Oh pray my Lord I beg your Lordships PardonNay Sir  VVilliam  Pray my Lord  Enter  la Reviere    Pray Sir  VVilliam  Pray my Lord  As he says this several times  la Reviere  enters behind him has as he designs to pass by him is still prevented by his turning from one side to t'other as he acts himself or the Lord  l' Rev  Hey What the Devil is he Conjuring and talking with invisible Lords He's in his Airs some pleasing Imagination hurries him out of his SensesBut I must to my  Lue  Hem Hem Sir dere be one two Gentlemen below come to wait upon you dis morning fal I show dem up  Sir VVill  No my Lord by no means I know better things  l' Rev  What then am I a Lord Egad I never knew my Quality before    side  Sir VVill  'Shaw this Blockhead has rous'd me from the prittiest Entertainment in the World  Aside  Well what would you Sir  L Rev  I vovd tell you Sir dere be one two Gentlemen wait upon you  Sir Will  And let 'em wait till I have doneI had a thousand fine things to say upon that occasion but this rude fellow has frighten'd 'em all out of my Head  Aside  Well since my better Diversion is  ver snow 'em up  L Rev  Y  Sir  Exit L Riv  Enter Captain  Bellmein  and  Toper  Sir VVill  Gentlemen I'm your most humble Servant Mr  Toper  I am extreamly yours for the honour you have done me in bringing your Friend I  ay under severe apprehensions that nothing cou'd engage you but a Drinking bout  Top  Faith you were in the Right for if your Champaine had not more charms than your Musick your Fidlers might have play'd by themselves for me  Sir VVill  Oh how unpolish'd how barbarous that is  Cap Bell  Why do you expect any other from him He admi  es no Musick like Wine rattling in the throat of a Flask with a Chorus of Drawers at Coming Sir  Sir VVill  And that to me is the most Nautious thing under the Moon impair my Vigor  Top  Impair my vigor ha ha very pritty Faith Prithee where did'st get that Affirmative  Sir VVill  'Tis my own at the purchase of some days study for to use another Man's Oath is in my Opinion as undecent as wearing his Cloths And to be in the Road of the vulgar is beneath a Gentleman who in my Judgment ought to be as much distinguish'd by his Expressions as by his Coach and Livery  Cap Bell  Right Sir for since every Body that has Mony enough sets up an Equipage a Gentleman ought to sind out some other way of distinguishing himself  Sir VVill  O' my Conscience they will ape us in that too for they ape so proud of following their betters that they even tread upon their heels not a formal Cit or awkard Lawyers Clerk that  on' Cour  the Cookwench a quarter for Oil and Flower enough to ga  ish  t his Wig for a day that he may Impudently mimick a Beau if 'twe  not beneath me I cou'd kick such Animals to a Jelly  Top  How kick 'em to a Jellywhy I have seen of that kind you talk of brawny follows that cou'd kick and cuff too stoutly  Sir Will  Ay that may be but 'tis not a Gentleman's business that always wears a Sword and has some half dozen of Footmen at his heels to kick and cuff nor stand and consider whether the Mechanick  be arm'd or not 'tis enough that he is or but thinks he is affronted to attone for the Life of a Scounderel  Cap Bell  Now wou'd this Ass rank Coward as he is if not crab'd by the Law kill a hundred Men honester and stouter than himself only because they don't wear Swords or are not so sinical  Top  I should think Sir  William  these honest People that wear no Swords very harmless because they carry no Instruments of Mischief about 'em  Sir VVill  Instruments their very hands their di  ty clothes are Instruments of Mischief Lookee Sir I'll make it very plain to you I may lawfully kill a Man in my own defence that comes A  m'd  in Terrorem  to Rob me of Fifty Pound  Cap Bell  Right Sir  Sir VVill  You allow that  Top  We do  Sir VVill  Then I'll prove the  est in an instant I have a new suit on that cost me  ifty Pound here comes thundering by a di  ty Drayman with his Cart that puts me in bodily fear and rushing rudely by da  bs all my Clothes so that I can't wear them any more now here's Fifty Pound lost by this Rascals dirty Chothes if I don't prevent it by  unning him through the Body  Cap Bell  How kill a Man for wea  ing dirty Clothes ha ha ha the Law makes better Provision for Men's Live    Sir VVill  The Law shou'd make better provision for Men's Clothes too for the Insolence of the Vulgar is insufferable and if one or two of them were made examples the rest wou'd be more Cautious  One Night after Play I waited on a Lady from the Box to her Coach comes a clumsy Cit with a paultry Mask out of the Gallery rush'd against me threw down the Ladies Page brusht all the Powder out of my Wig then cry'd ha ha ha we have ruin'd the Beau had I been a Lord I wou'd have run him through the Guts but to be try'd by a  iddlesexJury  is the Devil  Top  Aythese vulgar as you call them have a greater respect for Men's Lives than to suffer that Man to escape that kills one of them But I suppose your Principle concern rises from your loss of the
