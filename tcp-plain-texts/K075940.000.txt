 AN ESSAY UPON PRINTS CONTAINING Remarks upon the Principles of pic∣turesque Beauty THE Different Kinds of Prints AND THE Characters of the most noted Masters ILLUSTRATED BY Criticisms upon particular Pieces To which are added Some Cautions that may be useful in collecting Prints  Artificumque manus inter se operumque labores Miramur  Aen I  LONDON  Printed for J ROBSON Bookseller to the Princess Dowager of Wales at the Feathers in New Bond Street  M DCC LXVIII  THE PREFACE  bert Durer  The King of Bavaria has  florins for the erection at Nurem∣  of a monument to Albert Durer It will  mmenced in the spring  NOtwithstanding the following work a few additions excepted hath lain by the author at least fifteen years it is very far from being so perfect as he could have wished any new lights therefore and information he will be glad to receive through the hands of  his bookseller In many things he fears he may have passed wrong judgments and in some points he hath not had all the means of information which he could have desired for as he hath taken nothing upon trust with regard to the characters of masters he some∣times wanted the opportunity he wished for of consulting their works  Since his work was printed the author hath seen a  Dictionary of en∣gravers ancient and modern in three volumes published by F BASAN engraver at Paris  which seems to be accurate and might in some points have been of service to him It contains a very numerous catalogue of engra∣vers the more eminent of whom only  are taken notice of in the following pages Of modern prints the author hath purposely said little declining generally to give his opinion of living artists  He thought it necessary to introduce his work by a few observations on the principles of painting as far as those principles can be applied to prints As these observations are not always new he hath endeavoured at least to make them concise  In his account of artists he hath paid some attention to chronology but has in many cases purposely neglected it with a view of bringing those masters toge∣ther whose manners are alike  The chapter containing criticisms on particular prints is an addition to his original plan He was advised to in∣sert something of this kind as an illu∣stration of his principles  N B  When the figures on the  right side  are spoken of those are meant which are  opposite  to the spectator's right and so of the  left  Explanation of Terms  Composition  in its  large  sense means a picture in general in its  limited  one the art of grouping figures and combining the parts of a pic∣ture In this latter sense it is sy∣nonymous with  disposition  Design  in its strict sense applyed chiefly to  drawing  in its more enlarged one defined page In its most enlarged one sometimes taken for a picture in general  A whole  The idea of  one  object which a picture should give in its comprehensive view  Expression  its strict meaning defined page but it often means the force by which objects of  any  kind are represented  Effect  arises chiefly from the manage∣ment of light but the word is sometimes applied to the general view of a picture  Spirit  in its strict sense defined p but it is sometimes taken in a more inlarged one and means the  gene∣ral  effect of a masterly perfor∣mance  Manner  synonymous with  execution  Picturesque  a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty which is agreeable in a picture  Picturesque grace  an agreeable form given in a picture to a clownish figure  Repose  or  quietness  applyed to a pic∣ture when the  whole  is harmonious when nothing glares either in the light shade or colouring  To  keep down take down  or  bring down  signify throwing a degree of shade upon a glaring light  A middle tint  a medium between a strong light and strong shade the phrase is not at all expressive of colour  Catching lights  strong lights which strike upon some particular parts of an object the rest of which is in shadow  Studies  the scetched ideas of a painter not wrought into a whole  Freedom  the result of quick execu∣tion  Extremities  hands and feet  Air  expresses chiefly the graceful action of the head but often means a graceful attitude  Contrast  the opposition of one part to another  THE CONTENTS  CHAP I  The principles of painting considered as far as they relate to prints  CHAP II  Observations on the different kinds of prints  CHAP III  Characters of the most noted masters  CHAP IV  Remarks on particular prints  CHAP V  Cautions in collecting prints  CHAPTER I  The principles of Painting considered so far as they relate to Prints  A Painting or picture is di∣stinguished from a print only by the colouring and the manner of execution In other respects the  foundation of beauty is the same in both and we consider a print as we do a picture in a double light with regard to a  whole  and with regard to its  parts  It may have an agree∣able effect as a  whole  and yet be very culpable in its  parts  It may be likewise the reverse A man may make a good appearance upon the  whole  tho' his  limbs  examined se∣parately may be wanting in exact proportion His  limbs  on the other hand may be exactly formed and yet his  person  upon the  whole  dis∣gusting  To make a print agreeable as a  whole  a just observance of those rules is necessary which relate to  design disposition keeping  and the  distribu∣tion  of light  to make it agreeable in its  parts  of those which relate to  drawing expression grace  and  per∣spective  By  design  a term which painters sometimes use in a more limited sense I mean the general conduct of the piece as a representation of such a particular story It answers in an historical relation of a fact to a ju∣dicious choice of circumstances and includes a  proper time proper charac∣ters  the  most affecting manner of in∣troducing those characters  and  proper appendages  With regard to a  proper time  the painter is assisted by good old dra∣matic  rules which inform him that  one  point of time only should be taken the most affecting in the action and that no other part of the story should interfere with it Thus  in the death of  ANANIAS if the instant of his falling down be cho∣sen no anachronism should be intro∣duced every part of the piece should correspond each character should be under the strongest impression of astonishment and horror those pas∣sions being yet unallayed by any cooler passions succeding  With regard to  characters  the painter must suit them to his  piece  by attending to historical truth if his subject be history or to heathen mythology if it be fabulous  He must farther  introduce them pro∣perly  They should be ordered in such an advantageous manner that the principal figures those which are most concerned in the action should catch the eye  first  and en∣gage it  most  This is an essential ingredient in a welltold story In the first place they should be the least embarrassed of the group This alone gives them distinction But they may be farther distinguish∣ed sometimes by a  broad light  some∣times tho' but rarely and when the subject requires it by a  strong sha∣dow  in the midst of a light some∣times by a remarkable  action  or  ex∣pression  and sometimes by a combi∣nation of two or three of these modes of distinction  The last thing included in  design  is the use of  proper appendages  By  appendages  are meant animals land∣skip buildings and in general what ever is introduced into the piece by way of ornament Every thing of this kind should correspond with the subject and rank in a proper subor∣dination to it BASSAN would some∣times paint a scripturestory and his method was to croud his fore∣ground with cattle well painted in∣deed but wholly foreign to his sub∣ject while you seek for his princi∣pal figures and at length perhaps with difficulty find them in some re∣mote corner of his picture We often see a landskip well adorned with a story in miniature The  land∣skip  here is principal but at the  same time the figures which tell the story tho' subordinate to the land∣skip are the  principal figures  BAS∣SAN'S practice was different In his pictures neither the  landskip  nor the  story  is principal His cattle are the ornament of his pieces To intro∣duce a story then is absurd  When all these rules are observed when a proper point of time is chosen when characters corresponding with the subject are introduced and these ordered so judiciously as to point out the story in the strongest manner and lastly when all the appendages and underparts of the piece are suitable and subservient to the sub∣ject then the story is well told and of course the design is perfect  The second thing to be considered with regard to a  whole  is  disposition  By this word is meant the art of grouping the figures and of combi∣ning the several parts of a picture  Design  considers how each part  separately taken  concurs in produ∣cing a  whole  a  whole  arising from the  unity of the subject  not the  effect of the object  For the figures in a piece may be so ordered as to tell the story in an affecting manner which is as far as  design  goes and yet may want that agreable  com∣bination  which is necessary to please the eye To produce such a com∣bination is the business of  disposition  In the cartoon of St PAUL  preaching at Athens  the  design  is perfect and  the characters in particular are so ordered as to tell the story in a very affecting manner yet the several parts of the picture are far from being agreably combined If RUBENS had had the  disposition  of the materials of this picture and the management of the lights it's effect as a  whole  had been very different  Having thus distinguished between  design  and  disposition  I shall explain the latter a little farther  It is an obvious principle that one object at a time is enough to en∣gage either the senses or the intellect Hence the necessity of  unity  or a  whole  in painting The eye upon a complex view must be able to  comprehend the picture as  one ob∣ject  or it cannot be satisfyed It may be pleased indeed by feeding on the parts separately but a picture which can please no otherwise is as poor a production as a machine the springs and wheels of which are fi∣nished with nicety but are unable to act in concert and effect the intended movement  Now  disposition  or the art of group∣ing and combining the figures and several parts of a picture is an essen∣tial which contributes greatly to pro∣duce a  whole  in painting When the parts are scattered they have no de∣pendance on each other they are still only parts but by an agreeable  grouping they are massed together and become a  whole  In disposing figures great artifice is necessary to make each group open itself in such a manner as to set off advantageously the several figures of which it is composed The  action  at least of each figure should appear  No group can be agreeable with∣out  contrast  By  contrast  is meant the opposition of one part to another A sameness in attitude action or expression among figures in the same group will always disgust the eye In the cartoon of St PAUL  preaching at Athens  the contrast among the figures is incomparably fine and the  want of it  in the death of  ANANIAS makes the group of the apostles a disagreeable one  Nor indeeed is  contrast  required only among the  figures  of the  same  group but also among the  groups themselves  and among  all the parts  of which the piece is composed In the  beautiful gate of the temple  the figures of the principal group are very well contrasted but the ad∣joining group is disposed almost in the same manner which together with the formal pillars introduce a disagreable regularity into the pic∣ture  The judicious painter however whether he group combine or con∣trast  will always avoid the  appear∣ance  of  artifice  The several parts of his picture will be so suited to each other that his art will seem the result of chance In the  sacrifice at Lystra  the head of the ox is bowed down with a design no doubt to group the figures around it more harmoniously but their action is so well suited to the posture of the ox and the whole managed with so much 'judgment that altho' the fi∣gures are disposed with the utmost art they appear with all the ease of nature The remaining part of the group is an instance of the reverse in which a number of heads appear manifestly stuck in to fill up vacui∣ties  But farther as a  whole  or  unity  is an essential of beauty  that dispo∣sition  is certainly the most perfect which admits but of  one  group All subjects however will not allow this  close  observance of unity When this is the case the several groups must again be combined chiefly by a proper distribution of light so as constitute a  whole  But as the  whole  will soon be lost if the constituent  parts  become  nume∣rous  it follows that  many  groups must not be admitted Judicious painters have thought  three  the ut∣most number that can be allowed Some subjects indeed as battles and triumphs necessarily require a great number of figures and of course  various combinations of groups In the management of  such  subjects the greatest art is necessary to preserve a  whole  Confusion in the figures must be expressed without confusion in the picture A writer should treat his subject  clearly  tho' he write upon  obscurity  With regard to  disposition  I shall only add that the  shape  or  form  of the group should also be considered The  triangular  form MICHAEL ANGELO thought the most beautiful And indeed there is a lightness in it which no other form can receive The group of the apostles in the cartoon of  giving the keys  and the same group in the  death of Ananias  are both ex∣ceedingly heavy and this heaviness  arises from nothing more than from the form of a parallelogram within the lines of which these groups are contained The triangular form too is capable of the most variety for the vertical angle of a group so dis∣posed may either be acute or obtuse in any degree Or a  segment  only of a triangle may be taken which still increases the variety The cartoons afford few instances of beauty in the  forms  of  groups  In the works of Salvator Rosa we frequently find them  The painter when he hath chosen his subject should always scetch out some beautiful form of grouping which may best suit it within which bounds he should as nearly as may  be without affectation confine his figures What I mean is that the  form  of the group should never be left at random  A third thing to be considered in a picture with regard to a  whole  is  keeping  This word implies the dif∣ferent degrees of strength and faint∣ness which objects receive from near∣ness and distance A nice observance of the gradual fading of light and shade contributes greatly towards the production of a  whole  Without it the distant parts instead of being connected with the objects at hand appear like foreign objects wildly in∣troduced and unconnected Dimi∣nished in  size  only they put you in  mind of Lilliput and Brobdignag uni∣ted in one scene  Keeping  is generally found in great perfection in DELLA BELLA'S prints and the want of it as conspicuously in TEMPESTA'S  Nearly allied to  keeping  is the doc∣trine of  harmony  which equally con∣tributes towards the production of a  whole  In  painting  the practice of this doctrine has amazing force A judicious arrangement of according tints will strike even the unpracticed eye The  effect  of every picture in a great measure depends on one principal and mastertint which pre∣vails over the whole Sometimes the purple tint is chosen sometimes the mellow brown one and in some subjects the greenish hue is most  proper Of this ruling tint whatever it is every object in the picture should in a degree participate This theory is founded on principles of truth and produces a fine effect from the  harmony  in which it unites every objectBut altho'  harmony  shews its effect chiefly in  painting  yet in some measure the effect of  prints  may be assisted by it Unless they are har∣monized by the same  tone of shadow  if I may so express myself there will always appear a great deficiency in them By the same  tone of shadow  I mean not only the  same manner  of execution but an  uniform  degree of strength We often meet with hard touches in a print which standing alone are unharmonious but when every contiguous part is touched up  to that  tone  the  whole  is in unison  Keeping  then proportions a proper degree of strength to the near and distant parts in respect to  each other Harmony  goes a step farther and keeps each part quiet with respect to itself and the  whole  I shall only add that in scetches and rough etchings no  harmony  is expected it is enough if  keeping  be observed  Harmony  is looked for only in finished compositions If you would see the want of it in the strongest light exa∣mine a wornprint harshly retouched by some bungler  The last thing which contributes to produce a  whole  is a proper  di∣stribution of light  This in a print especially is most essential An har∣mony  in the colouring may in some measure supply its place in painting but a print has no succidaneum Were the  design disposition  and  keep∣ing  ever so perfect beautiful and just without this essential instead of a whole we should have only a piece of patchwork Nay such is the power of  light  that by an arti∣ficial management of it we may even harmonize a bad disposition  The general rule which regards the distribution of  light  is that it should be spread in  large masses  This gives us the idea of a  whole  Every grand object catches the light only upon one large surface Where the light is spotted we have the idea of several objects or at least of an in∣coherent  one if the object be single which the eye surveys with difficulty It is thus in painting When we see upon a  comprehensive  view  large masses  of light and shade we have of course the idea of a  whole  of  unity  in that picture But where the light is scattered we have the idea of several objects or at least of one broken and confused TITIAN'S known illustration of this point by a bunch of grapes is beautiful and explanatory When the light falls upon the  whole bunch  together one side being illumined and the other dark we have the representation of those large masses which constitute a  whole  But when the grapes are stripped from the bunch and scat∣tered upon a table the light shining  upon each separately a  whole  is no longer preserved  Having thus considered those essen∣tials of a print which produce a  whole  it remains to consider those which relate to the  partsdrawing expression grace  and  perspective  With regard to these let it be first obser∣ved that in order they are infe∣rior to the other The production of a  whole  is the great effect that should be aimed at in a picture a picture without a  whole  is properly only a study and those things which produce a  whole  are of course the  principal  foundation of beauty  By  drawing  we mean the exactness of the outline Without a compe∣tent  knowledge of this there can be no just representation of nature E∣very thing will be distorted and offensive to the eye Bad drawing therefore is that disgusting object which  Non homines non dii non concessere columnae  Drawing however may be very tolerable though it fall short in a certain degree of absolute perfec∣tion The defect will only be ob∣served by the most critical and ana∣tomical eye and I may venture to say that drawing is ranked too high when the  niceties  of it are considered in preference to those essentials which constitute a  whole  Expression  is the life and soul of painting It implies a just represen∣tation  of  passion  and of  character  of  passion  by exhibiting every emotion of the mind as outwardly discovered by any peculiarity of gesture or the extention and contraction of the fea∣tures of  character  by representing the different manners of men as ari∣sing from their particular tempers or professions The cartoons are full of examples of the first kind of  expression  and with regard to the second commonly called  mannerspainting  it would be invidious not to mention our countryman HOGARTH whose works contain a variety of characters  represented  with more force than most men can  conceive  them  Grace  consists in such a disposition  of the parts of a figure as forms it into an agreeable attitude It de∣pends on  contrast  and  ease Contrast  when applied to a single figure means the same as when applied to a group the opposition of one part to another It may be considered with reference to the  body  the  limbs  and the  head  the graceful attitude arising sometimes from a contrast in one sometimes in another and some∣times in all With reference to the  body  contrast consists in giving it an easy turn opposing concave parts to convex Of this St PAUL in  the sacrifice at Lystra  is an instance With reference to the  limbs  it consists in the opposition between ex∣tention and contraction MICHAEL ANGELO'S illustration by a triangle or  pyramid may here likewise again be introduced this form giving grace and beauty to a  single figure  as well as to a  group  Only here a greater liberty may be allowed In  group∣ing  the triangle must always rest upon its base but in a single figure it may be inverted and stand upon its apex Thus if the lower parts of the figure be extended the upper parts should be contracted but the same beautiful form is given by ex∣tending the arms and drawing the feet to a point Lastly contrast often arises from the air of the head which is given by a turn of the neck from the line of the body The cartoons abound with examples of this kind of  grace  It is very re∣markable in the figure of St JOHN  healing the cripple and the same cartoon affords eight or nine more instances I say the less on this subject as it hath been so well ex∣plained by the ingenious author of the  Analysis of Beauty  Thus  contrast  is the foundation of  grace  but it must ever be remem∣bred that  contrast  should be accom∣panied with  ease  The body should be  turned  not  twisted  every  con∣strained  posture avoided and every motion such as nature which loves ease would dictate  What hath been said on this head relates equally to  all  figures those drawn from  low  as well as those from  high  life And here I would distin∣guish  between  picturesque  grace and that grace which arises from  dignity of character  Of the  former  kind which is the kind here treated of  all  figures should partake you find it in BERGHEM'S clowns and in CALLOT'S beggars but it belongs to  expression  to mark those charac∣teristics which distinguish the  lat∣ter  I shall only observe farther that when the piece consists of many figures the contrast of  each single  figure should be subordinate to the contrast of the  whole  It will be im∣proper therefore in many cases to practice the rules which have been just laid down They ought how∣ever to be a general direction to the  painter and at least to be observed in the  principal  figures If a  single  figure be introduced as in portrait the pyramidal form cannot well be dispensed with The figure partakes then of the nature of a group  Perspective  is that proportion with regard to  size  which near and di∣stant objects with their parts bear to each other It answers to  keep∣ing  one gives the outline and the other fills it up Without a competent knowledge of  perspective  very absurd things would be in∣troduced and yet to make a vain shew of it is pedantic Under this head may be reduced  foreshortning  Unless this be done with the utmost art it were better omitted it will otherwise occasion  great aukwardness RUBENS is fa∣mous for  foreshortning  but the effect is chiefly seen in his  paintings  sel∣dom in his  prints  To this summary of the rules which relate to the  whole  of a picture and to its  parts  I shall just add a few observations upon  execution  which relates equally to both  By  execution  is meant that manner of working by which each artist produces his effect Artists may dif∣fer in their  execution  or  manner  and yet all excel CALLOT for instance uses a strong firm stroke SALVA∣TOR a slight and loose one while REMBRANDT executes in a manner different from them both by scratches seemingly at random  Every artist is in some degree a  mannerist  that is he executes in a  manner  peculiar to himself But the word  mannerist  has generally a closer sense Nature should be the stand∣ard of imitation and every object should be executed as nearly as possible in  her manner  Thus SAL∣VATOR'S figures DU JARDIN'S ani∣mals and WATERLO'S landskips are all strongly impressed with the cha∣racter of nature Other masters again deviating from this standard instead of nature have recourse only to their own ideas They have gotten a general idea of a man a horse or a tree and to these ideas they apply upon all occasions In∣stead therefore of representing that endless variety which nature exhi∣bits  on every subject a sameness runs through all their performances Every figure and every tree bears the same stamp Such artists are  properly  called  mannerists  TEMPEST CALLOT and TESTA are all  mannerists  of this kind Their ideas are plainly no copies from nature PERELLE'S landskips too are mere transcripts of imagina∣tion The artist however who copies nature if he make a bad choice as REMBRANDT often did is less agreable than the  mannerist  who gives us his own elevated ideas touched with spirit and character tho' not with exact truth He is the true artist who copies nature but where he finds her mean elevates her from his own ideas of beauty Such was SALVATOR  By the  spirit  and  freedom  of  execution  we mean something which it is diffi∣cult to explain A certain heaviness always follows when the artist is not sure of his stroke and cannot execute his idea with precision The reverse is the case when he is certain of it and gives it boldly I know not how to explain better what is meant by  spirit  Mere  freedom  a quick execution will give but unless that  freedom  be attended with precision the stroke however free will be so un∣meaning as to lose its effect  To these observations it may not be improper to add a short compa∣rative view of the  peculiar  excellences of pictures and prints which will  shew us in what points the picture has the advantage  In  design  and  composition  the effects of both are equal The print exhi∣bits them with as much force and meaning as the picture  In  keeping  the picture has the ad∣vantage The  haziness  of distance can∣not well be expressed by any thing but the  hue of nature  which the pencil is very able to give The print  endeavours  to preserve this hazi∣ness and to give the idea but the idea is very imperfect It is little more than an aid to memory We know the appearance exists in nature and the print furnishes an hint to re∣collect it  In the  distribution of light  the com∣parison runs very wide Here the painter avails himself of a thousand varied tints which assist him in this business and by which he can har∣monize his gradations from light to shade with an almost infinite variety An harmonious colouring has in itself indeed the effect of a proper distri∣bution of light The engraver in the mean time is left to work out his effect with two materials only plain white and blackIn the print however you can more easily trace the  principles  of light and shade The pencil is the implement of deception and it requires the eye of a master to distinguish between the effect of light and the mere effect of colour but in the print even the unpractised  eye can readily catch the mass and follow the distribution of it through all its variety of middle tints One thing more may be added on this head If the picture have no harmony in its colouring the tints being all at discord among themselves which is very often the case in the works of reputable painters a good print from such a picture is more beautiful than the picture itself It preserves what is valuable upon a supposition there is any thing valuable in it and removes what is offensive  Thus the comparison runs with regard to those essentials which re∣late to a  whole  with regard to  drawing expression grace  and  per∣spective  we can pursue it only in the  two former in the two latter the picture and the print seem to have equal advantages With regard to  perspective  indeed the lines of the print verging all to one point may mark the  principles  of it more strong∣ly  Drawing  in a  picture  is effected by the contiguity of two different colours in a  print  by a positive line In the  picture  therefore  drawing  has more of nature in it and more of effect but the student in anatomy finds more precision in the print and can more easily trace the line and follow it in all its windings through light and shade In met∣zotinto indeed the comparison fails in which species of prints drawing  is effected nearly as it is in paint∣ing  With regard to  expression  the painter glories in his many advantages The passions receive their force almost as much from  colour  as from the emo∣tion of feature Nay lines without colour have frequently an effect very opposite to what is intended Vio∣lent expressions when lineal only become often grotesque The com∣plexion should support the distortion The bloated eyes of immoderate grief degenerate into coarse features unless the pencil add those highblown touches which mark the passion Ask the engraver why he could not give the dying saint of DOMINICHINO  his true expression  JAC FREII'S copy of DOMINICHINO'S St  Jerome  Why he gave him that ghastly horror instead of the serene langour of the original The engraver may with justice say he went as far as lines could go but he wanted DOMINICHINO'S pen∣cil to give those pallid touches which alone could make his lines expres∣sive Age also and sex the bloom of youth and the wan cheek of sickness are equally indebted in representation for their most charac∣teristic marks to the pencil In  portrait  the different hues of hair and complexion in  animallife  the various dies of furrs and plu∣mage  in  landskip  the peculiar tints of seasons of morning and evening the light azure of a summer's sky the sultry glow of noon the bluish or purple tinge which the moun∣tain assumes as it recedes or ap∣proaches the grey moss upon the ruin the variegated greens and mellow browns of foliage and broken ground in short the colours of every part of nature have all ama∣zing force in strengthning the ex∣pression of objects In the room of all this the deficient print has only to offer mere form and the grada∣tions of simple light Hence the sweet touches of the pencil of CLAUDE mark his pictures with the strongest expressions of nature and render them invaluable while  his prints are the dirty shapes of something which he could not ex∣press  The idea also of  distant magnitude  the print gives only very imperfectly It is expressed chiefly by colour Air which is naturally blue is the me∣dium through which we see and every object participates of this blue∣ness When the distance is small the tinge is imperceptible as it increases the tinge grows stronger and when the object is very remote it entirely loses its natural colour and becomes blue And indeed this is so familiar a criterion of distance at least with those who live in mountainous countries that if the object be visible at all after it has  received the full  ethertinge  if I may so speak the sight immediately judges it to be very large The eye ranging over the plains of Egypt and catching the blue point of a pyramid from the colour concludes the distance and is struck with the magnitude of an object which through such a space can exhibit form Here the print fails this criterion of distant magnitude it is unable to give  The print equally fails when the medium itself receives a foreign tinge from a strength of colour behind it The idea of horrour impressed by an expanse of air glowing in the night with distant fire cannot be raised by black and white VANDERVELDE has  contrived to give us a good idea of the dreadful glare of a fleet in flames but it were ridiculous for an engraver to attempt such a sub∣ject because he cannot express that idea which principally illustrates his story  Transparency  is another thing which the print is very unable to express It is the united tinge of two colours one behind the other each of which in part discovers itself singly If you employ one colour only you have the idea of opaqueness A fine carnation is a white transparent skin spread over a multitude of small blood vessels which blush through it When the breath departs these little fountains of life flow no longer the  bloom fades and livid paleness the colour of death succeeds The happy pencil can mark both these effects It can spread the glow of health over the cheek of beauty and it can with equal facility express the cold wan tint of human clay The print can express neither repre∣senting in the same dry manner the bright transparency of the one and the inert opaqueness of the other  Lastly the print fails in the expres∣sion of  polished bodies  which are in∣debted for their chief lustre to  reflected colours  The print indeed goes far∣ther here than in the case of tran∣sparency In this it can do very  little in  polished bodies  it can at least give  reflected shapes  It can shew the  forms  of hanging woods upon the edges of the lake tho' it is unable to give the kindred tinge But in many cases the  polished  body receives the  tinge  without the  shape  Here the engraver is wholly deficient he knows not how to stain the gleaming silver with the purple liquor it con∣tains nor is he able to give the hero's armour its highest polish from the tinge of the crimson vest which covers it  A single word upon the subject of  execution  shall conclude these re∣marks Here the advantage lies wholly on the side of painting  That  manner which can best give the idea  of the surface of an object is the best and the lines of the finest engraving are harsh in comparison of the smooth flow of the pencil  Metzotinto  tho' deficient in some respects is certainly in others the happyest manner of ex∣ecution and the ancient  wooden print  in which the middle tint is used is undoubtedly in point of execution beyond either etching or engraving  CHAPTER II  Observations on the different Kinds of Prints  THERE are three kinds of prints  engravings etchings  and  met∣zotintos  The characteristic of the first is  strength  of the second  free∣dom  and of the third  softness  All  these however may in some degree be found in each  From the shape of the engraver's tool each stroke is an angular inci∣sion which form must of course give the line strength and firmness if it be not very tender From such a line also as it is a deliberate one correctness may be expected but no great freedom for it is a laboured line ploughed through the metal and must necessarily in a degree want ease  Unlimited  freedom  on the other hand is the characteristic of  etching  The needle gliding along the sur∣face of the copper meets no resist∣ance and easily takes any turn the  hand pleases to give it Etching in∣deed is mere drawing and may be practised with the same facility But as  aquafortis  bites in an  equable  manner it cannot give the lines that strength which they re∣ceive from a pointed graver cut∣ting into the copper Besides it is difficult to prevent it's biting the plate  all over  alike The  distant parts  indeed may easily be covered with wax and the grand effect of the  keeping  preserved but to give each smaller part its proper relief and to  harmonize  the  whole  requires so many different degrees of strength such easy transitions from one into ano∣ther that aquafortis alone is not equal to it Here therefore engra∣ving hath the advantage which by a  stroke deep or tender at the artists pleasure can vary strength and faint∣ness in any degree  As engraving therefore and etch∣ing have their respective advantages and deficiencies artists have endea∣voured to unite their powers and correct the faults of each by join∣ing the  freedom  of the one with the  strength  of the other In most of our modern prints the plate is first etched and afterwards strength∣ened and finished by the engraver And when this is  well  done it has a happy effect That flatness which is the consequence of an equable strength of shade is taken off and the print gains a new effect by the relief given to those parts which  hang  in the painter's language upon the parts behind to them But great art is necessary in this busi∣ness We see many a print which wanted only a  few  touches when it appeared in its etched proof re∣ceive afterwards so  many  as to become laboured heavy and disgustful  It is a rare thing to meet with a print  entirely engraved  which is free from stiffness A celebrated master of our own indeed hath found the art of giving freedom to the stroke of a graver and hath displayed great force of execution upon works by no means worthy of him as if he were determined to shew the world he could stamp a value upon any thing But such artists are  rarely found  Mere engravers  in general are little better than  mere mechanics  In  etching  we have a greater va∣riety of excellent prints The case is it is so much the same as draw∣ing that we have the very works themselves of the most celebrated masters many of whom have left behind them prints in this way which however slight and incor∣rect will always have something  masterly  and of course  beautiful  in them  In the muscling of human figures of any considerable size  engraving  hath undoubtedly the advantage of  etching  The soft and delicate tran∣sitions  from light to shade which are there required cannot be so well expressed by the needle and in general  large prints  require a strength which  etching  cannot give and are therefore fit objects of  engraving  Etching  on the other hand is more particularly adapted to scetches and slight designs which if executed by an engraver would entirely lose their freedom and with it their beauty Landskip too in general is the object of  etching  The foli∣age of trees ruins sky and indeed every part of landskip requires the utmost freedom In finishing an  etched  landskip with the  tool  as it is called too much care cannot be taken to prevent heaviness We re∣marked  before the nicety of touch∣ing upon an etched plate but in landskip the business is peculiarly delicate The foregrounds may re∣quire a few strong touches and the boles of such trees as are placed upon them and here and there a few harmonizing strokes will add to the effect but if the engraver ven∣tures much farther he has good luck if he do no mischief  An  engraved  plate unless it be cut very slightly will cast off five hundred good impressions An  etched  one will not give above two hun∣dred unless it be eaten very deep and then it may perhaps give three hundred After that the plate must  be retouched or the impressions will be faint  Besides the common method of en∣graving on  copper  we have prints en∣graved on pewter and on wood The pewter plate gives a coarseness and dirtiness to the print which is disa∣greable But engraving upon wood is capable of great beauty Of this species of engraving more shall else∣where be said  Metzotinto is very different from either  engraving  or  etching  In these you make the  shades  in  metzotinto  the  lights  Since the time of its invention by  Prince RUPERT as is commonly supposed the art of scraping  met∣zotintos  is greatly more improved than either of its sisterarts Some of the earliest  etchings  are perhaps the best and  engraving  since the times of GOLTZIUS and MULLER hath not perhaps made any very great advances But  metzotinto  compared with its original state is at this day almost a new art If we exa∣mine some of the modern pieces of workmanship in this way the  Jewish Rabbi  the portrait of  Mrs  LAS∣CELLES  with a child on her knee  Mr GARRICK  between Tragedy and Comedy  and several other prints by some of our best metzotintoscra∣pers they almost as much exceed the works of WHITE and SMITH as  those masters did BECKET and SIMONS As to Prince RUPERT'S works I never saw any which were  certainly  known to be his but I make no doubt they were executed in the same black harsh disagreable man∣ner which appears so strong in the masters who succeeded The inven∣tion however was noble and the early masters have the credit of it but the truth is the ingenious me∣chanic hath been called in to the painter's aid and hath invented a manner of  laying ground  wholly un∣known to the earlier masters and they who are acquainted with  met∣zotinto  know the  ground  to be a very capital consideration  The characteristic of  metzotinto  is  softness  which adapts it chiefly to portrait or history with a few fi∣gures and these not too small No∣thing except paint can express flesh more naturally or the flowing of hair or the folds of drapery or the catching lights of armour In en∣graving and etching we must get over the prejudices of cross lines which exist on no natural bodies but  metzotinto  gives us the strongest re∣presentation of a  surface  If how∣ever the figures are two crowded it wants strength to detach the seve∣ral parts with a proper relief and if they are very small it wants pre∣cision which can only be given by an outline or as in painting by a different tint The unevenness of the  ground will occasion bad drawing and aukwardness in the extremi∣ties especially Some inferior artists have endeavoured to remedy this by terminating their figures with an engraved or etched line but they have tryed the experiment with bad success The strength of the line and the softness of the ground accord ill together I speak not here of such a judicious mixture of  etching  and  metzotinto  as WHITE formerly used and such as our best metzo∣tintoscrapers at present use to give a strength to particular parts I speak only of a harsh and injudicious lineal termination  Metzotinto  excells each of the other species of prints in its capacity of receiving the most beautiful effects of light and shade as it can the most happily unite them by blend∣ing them together Of this REM∣BRANDT seems to have been aware He had probably seen some of the first metzotintos and admiring the effect endeavoured to produce it in etching by a variety of intersecting scratches  You cannot well cast off more than an hundred good impressions from a metzotinto plate The rub∣bing of the hand soon wears it smooth And yet by constantly re∣pairing it it may be made to give  four or five hundred with tolerable strength The first impressions are not always the best They are too black and harsh You will com∣monly have the best impressions from the fiftieth to the seventieth the harsh edges will be softened down and yet there will be spirit and strength enough left  CHAPTER III  Characters of the most noted Masters  MASTERS IN HISTORY  ALBERT DURER tho' not the inventor was one of the first improvers of the art of engraving He was a German painter and at the same time a Man of letters and  a philosopher It may be added in his praise that he was an intimate friend of the great Erasmus who revised it is supposed some of the pieces which he published He was a man of business also and for many years was the leading magistrate of Nuremburgh His prints consi∣dered as the first efforts of a new art have great merit Nay we may add that it is astonishing to see a new art in its first essay carried to such a length In some of those prints which he executed on cop∣per the engraving is elegant to a great degree His  Hellscene  parti∣cularly which was engraved in the year is as highfinished a print as ever was engraved and as hap∣pily finished The labour he has  bestowed upon it has it's full effect In his wooden prints too we are sur∣prized to see in so early a master so much meaning and relief the heads so well marked and every part so well executed This artist seems to have understood very well the principles of design His com∣position too is often pleasing and his drawing generally good but he knows very little of the management of light and still less of grace and yet his ideas are purer and more elegant than we could have sup∣posed from the aukward archetypes which his country and education af∣forded In a word he was certainly a Man of a very extensive genius and as  Vasari  remarks would have been an extraordinary artist if he  had had an Italian instead of a Ger∣man education His prints are very numerous They were much admi∣red in his own lifetime and eagerly bought up which put his wife who was a teizing woman upon urging him to spend more time upon en∣graving than he was inclined to do He was very rich and chose rather to practice his art as an amusement than as a business He died in the year  The immediate successors and imi∣tators of ALBERT DURER were LUCAS VAN LEIDEN ALDGRAVE PENS HISBEN and some others of less note Their works are very much in their master's style and were the admiration of an age which  had seen nothing better The best of ALDGRAVE'S works are two or three small pieces of the story of Lot  GOLTZIUS flourished a little after the death of these masters and car∣ried engraving to a great height He was a native of Germany where he learned his art but travelling afterwards into Italy he there im∣proved his ideas You plainly dis∣cover in him a mixture of the Fle∣mish and Italian schools His forms have sometimes a degree of elegance in them but in general the Dutch master predominates GOLTZIUS is often happy in  design  and  disposi∣tion  and fails most in the  distribu∣tion of light  But his chief excellence  lies in  execution  He engraves with a noble firm expressive line which hath scarce been excelled by any succeeding masters There is a va∣riety too in his manner which is very pleasing His print of  the cir∣cumcision  is one of the best of his works The story is well told the groups agreably disposed and the execution admirable but the figures are Dutch and the whole through the want of a proper distribution of shade is only a glaring mass  MULLER ingraved very much in the style of GOLTZIUS and yet with a still bolder and firmer stroke We have no where greater master∣pieces in execution than the works of this artist exhibit The  baptism  of  JOHN is perhaps the most beauti∣ful specimen of bold engraving that is extant  ABRAHAM BLOEMART was a Dutch master also and contempo∣rary with GOLTZIUS We are not informed what particular means of improvement he had but it is cer∣tain he designed in a more elegant taste than any of his countrymen His figures are often graceful ex∣cepting only that he gives them sometimes an affected twist which is still more conspicuous in the fin∣gers an affectation which we sometimes also find in the prints of GOLTZIUS The  resurrection of  LAZARUS is one of BLOEMART'S master pieces in which are many  faults and many beauties both very characteric  While the Dutch masters were thus carrying the art of engraving to so great an height it was intro∣duced into Italy by ANDREA MAN∣TEGNA to whom the Italians as∣cribe the invention of it The paint∣ings of this master tho' they abound in noble passages are formal and disagreable We have a specimen of them at HamptonCourt in the triumph of JULIUS CAESARHis prints which are said to have been engraved on tinplates are trans∣scripts from the same ideas We see in them the chaste correct out∣line and noble simplicity of the Ro∣man school but we are to expect  nothing more not the least attempt towards an agreable  whole  And indeed we shall perhaps find in ge∣neral that the masters of the Roman school were more studious of those essentials of painting which regard the  parts  and the Flemish masters of those which regard the  whole  The former therefore drew better  figures  the latter made better  pic∣tures  MANTEGNA was succeeded by PARMIGIANO and PALMA both masters of great reputation PAR∣MIGIANO having formed the most accurate taste upon a thorough study of the works of RAPHAEL and MICHAEL ANGELO published many of his figures rather than designs  engraved on wood which abounded with every kind of beauty if we may form a judgment of them from the few which we sometimes meet with Whither PARMIGIANO in∣vented the art of engraving upon wood does not certainly appear His pretentions to the invention of etching are less disputable In this way he published many slight pieces which do him great credit In the midst of his labours he was inter∣rupted by a knavish engraver who pillaged him of all his plates Una∣ble to bear the loss he foreswore his art and abandoned himself to chymistry  PALMA was too much employed as a painter to have much leisure for etching He hath left however se∣veral prints behind him which are remarkable for the delicacy of the drawing and the freedom of the execution He etches in a very loose but masterly manner His prints are scarce and indeed we seldom meet with any that deserve more than the name of scetches  FRANCIS PARIA seems to have copied the manner of PALMA with great success But his prints are still more scarce than his master's nor have we a sufficient number of them to enable us to form a judgment of his merit  But the great improver of the art of engraving upon wood and who at once carried it to a degree of per∣fection which hath not since been exceeded was ANDREA ANDREANI of Mantua The works of this ma∣ster are remarkable for the free∣dom strength and spirit of the execution the elegant correctness of the drawing and in general for their effect Few prints come so near the idea of painting They have a force which a pointed tool upon copper cannot reach and the wash of which the middle tint is composed adds all the softness of drawing The works of this master indeed are seldom seen in perfection They are scarce and when we do meet with them it is a chance if  the impressions be good and very much of the beauty of these prints depends on the goodness of the im∣pression For often the outline is left hard the middle tint being lost and sometimes the middle tint is left without it's proper termination  Among the ancient Italian masters we cannot omit MARK ANTONIO and AUGUSTIN of Venice They are both celebrated and have hand∣ed down to us many engravings from the works of RAPHAEL but their  antiquity  not their  merit  seems to have recommended them Their execution is harsh and formal to the last degree and if their prints give us any idea of the works of RAPHAEL we may well wonder  as PICART observes how that master got his reputation  FREDERIC BAROCCHI was born at Urbin where the genius of RA∣PHAEL inspired him In his early youth he travelled to Rome and giving himself up to intense study he acquired a great name in paint∣ing At his leisure hours he etched a few prints from his own designs which are highly finished and exe∣cuted with great softness and deli∣cacy The  Salutation  is his capital performance of which we seldom meet with any impressions but those taken from the retouched plate which are very harsh  ANTHONY TEMPESTA was a na∣tive of Florence but resided chiefly at Rome where he was much em∣ployed as a painter by GREGORY XIII His prints are very numerous all from his own designs Battles and huntings are the subjects in which he most delighted His merit lies in expression and drawing in the grandeur of his ideas and an imagination exceedingly fertile His figures are often elegant and grace∣ful and his heads marked with un∣common spirit and correctness His horses tho' fleshy and illdrawn and evidently never copied from nature are however noble animals and dis∣play an endless variety of beautiful ac∣tions His imperfections at the same time are very glaring His  composition is generally bad Here and there you have a good group seldom an agreeable whole He had not the art of preserving his back∣grounds tender so that we are not to expect any effect of keeping His execution is harsh and he is totally ignorant of the distribution of light But notwithstanding all his faults such is his merit upon the whole that as studies at least his prints deserve a much higher rank in the cabinets of connoisseurs than they generally find  AUGUSTIN CARRACHE has left a few etchings which are admired for the delicacy of the drawing and the freedom of the execution But there is great flatness in them and  want of strength Etchings indeed in this style are rather meant as scetches than finished prints  GUIDO'S etchings most of which are small are esteemed for the sim∣plicity of the design the elegance and correctness of the outline and that grace for which this master is so remarkable The extremities of his figures are particularly touched with great accuracy But we have the same spiritless flatness in the works of GUIDO which we find in those of his master CARRACHE ac∣companied at the same time with less freedom  CANTARINI copied the manner of GUIDO as PARIA did that of PALMA and so happily that it is often difficult to distinguish the works of these two masters  CALLOT was little acquainted with any of the grand principles of paint∣ing of composition and the ma∣nagement of light he was totally ig∣norant But tho' he could not make a picture he was admirably skilled in drawing a figure His attitudes are generally graceful when they are not affected his expression strong his drawing correct and his execu∣tion masterly tho' rather laboured His  Fair  is a good epitome of his works Considered as a  whole  it is a confused jumble of ideas but the  parts  separately examined appear the work of a master The same character may be given of his most famous work the  Miseries of war  in which there is more expression both in action and feature than was ever perhaps shewn in so small a compass And yet I know not whether his  Beggars  be not the more capital performance In the  Miseries of war  he aims at composition in which he rarely succeeds  His Beg∣gars  are detached figures in which lay his strength I shall only add that a vein of drollery and humour runs through all his designs which sometimes when he chuses to indulge it freely as in the  Temptation of St  ANTHONY displays itself in a very facetious manner  COUNT GAUDE contracted a friendship at Rome with ADAM ELSHAMER from whose designs he engraved a few prints GAUDE was a young nobleman upon his travels and never practised engraving as a profession This would call for in∣dulgence if his prints had less merit but in their way they are beautiful tho' on the whole formal and un∣pleasant They are highly finished but void of all freedom Moon∣lights and torchlights are the sub∣jects he chiefly chuses and his great excellence lies in preserving the effects of these different lights His prints are generally small I know only one the  Flight into Egypt  of a larger size  SALVATOR ROSA  painted  landskip more than history but his  prints  are chiefly historical He was bred a painter and perfectly understood his art if we except only the  ma∣nagement of light  of which he seems to have been ignorant The capital landskip of this master at Chiswick is a noble picture The contrivance the composition the distances the figures and all the parts and appen∣dages of it are fine but in point of light it might perhaps have been improved if the middle ground where the figures of the second distance stand had been thrown into sun∣shine In  design  and generally in  composition  SALVATOR is very great His figures which he drew in ex∣quisite taste are graceful and nobly expressive beautifully grouped and varied into the most agreeable atti∣tudes With regard indeed to the  legs of his figures it must be owned he is a  mannerist  They are well drawn but all cast in one mould There is a stiffness too in the backs of his extended hands the palms are beautiful But these are trivial criticisms His  manner  is flight so as not to admit either softness or effect yet the simplicity and ele∣gance of it are wonderfully pleasing and bear that strong characteristic of a master's hand  sibi quivis  Speret idem  One thing in his manner of shading is disagreable He will often shade a  face  half over with long lines which in so small and delicate an object gives an unpleasant abruptness It is treating a face like an egg no distinc∣tion of feature is observed  SALVATOR was a man of genius and of learning both which he has found frequent opportunities of dis∣playing in his works His style is grand every object that he intro∣duces is of the heroic kind and his subjects in general shew an intimacy with ancient history and mytho∣logy  A roving disposition to which he is said to have given full scope seems to have added a wildness to all his thoughts We are told he spent the early part of his life in a troop of banditti and that the rocky and desolate scenes in which he was accustomed to take refuge furnished him with those romantic ideas in landskip of which he is so exceed∣ingly fond and in the description of which he so greatly excells His  Robbers  as his detached figures are commonly called are supposed also to have been taken from the life  REMBRANDT'S excellency as a painter lay in colouring which he possessed in such perfection that it almost screens every fault in his pic∣tures His prints deprived of this palliative have only his inferior qua∣lifications to recommend them These are expression and skill in the ma∣nagement of light execution and sometimes composition I mention them in the order in which he seems to have possessed them His expres∣sion has most force in the character of age He marks as strongly as the hand of Time itself He possesses too in a great degree that inferior  kind of expression which gives its proper and characteristic touch to drapery fur metal and every object he represents His management of light consists chiefly in making a very strong contrast which has often a good effect and yet in many of his prints there is no effect at all which gives us reason to think he either had no principles or published such prints before his principles were as∣certained His execution is pecu∣liar to himself It is rough or neat as he meant a scetch or a finished piece but always free and masterly It produces it's effect by strokes in∣tersected in every direction and comes nearer the idea of painting than the execution of any other master  Never painter was more at a loss than REMBRANDT for an idea of that species of grace which is neces∣sary to support an elevated character While he keeps within the sphere of his genius and contents himself with low subjects he deserves any praise But when he attempts beauty or dignity it were goodnatured to suppose he means only burlesque and charicature He is a strong contrast to SALVATOR The one drew all his ideas from nature as she appears with the utmost grace and elegance The other caught her in her meanest images and transferred those images into the highest cha∣racters Hence SALVATOR exalts banditti into heroes REMBRANDT degrades patriarchs into beggars  REMBRANDT indeed seems to have affected awkwardness He was a man of humour and would laugh at those artists who studied the an∣tique "I'll shew you my antiques" he would cry and then he would carry his friends into a room furnish∣ed with headdresses draperies hous∣holdstuff and instruments of all kinds  These he would add are worth all your antiques  His best etching is that which goes by the name of the  hundredguildresprint  which is in such esteem that I have known twenty guineas given for a good impression of it In this all his excellencies are united and I might add his imperfections also Age and wretchedness are admirably  described but the principal figure is ridiculously mean  REMBRANDT is said to have left behind him near three hundred prints none of which are dated be∣fore MDCXXVIII none after MDCLIX They were in such esteem even in his own lifetime that he is said to have retouched some of them four or five times  PETER TESTA studied upon a plan very different from that either of SAL∣VATOR or REMBRANDT Those masters drew their ideas from nature TESTA from what he esteemed a superior model the antique Smit with the love of painting this artist travelled to Rome in the habit of a  pilgrim destitute of all the means of improvement but what mere genius furnished He had not even inte∣rest to procure a recommendation nor had he any address to substitute in it's room The works of sculp∣ture fell most obviously in his way and to those he applied himself with so much industry copying them over and again that he is said to have gotten them all by heart Thus qua∣lified he took up the pencil But he soon found the school in which he had studied a very insufficient one to form a painter He had neglected colouring and his pictures were in no esteem Disappointed and mor∣tified he threw aside his pallet and applied himself to etching in which he became a great proficient  His prints are very valuable We are seldom indeed to expect a cohe∣rency of design in any of them An enthusiastic vein runs through most of his compositions and it is not an improbable conjecture that his head was a little disturbed He generally crouds into his pieces such a jumble of inconsistent ideas that it is diffi∣cult sometimes only to guess at what he aims He was as little acquaint∣ed with the distribution of light as with the rules of design and yet notwithstanding all this his works contain an infinite fund of entertain∣ment There is an exuberance of fancy in him which with all its wild∣ness is agreable his ideas are sub∣lime and noble his drawing most elegantly correct his heads touched  with infinite spirit and expression his figures graceful rather too nearly allied to the antique his groups often beautiful and his execution in his best etchings for he is often unequal to himself very masterly  Some of his works are etched by CAES TESTA  Perhaps no prints afford more useful studies for a painter  The  procession of  SILENUS if we may guess at so confused a design may illustrate all that hath been said The  whole  is as incoherent as the  parts  are beautiful  This unfortunate artist was drown∣ed in the Tyber and it is left uncer∣tain whether by accident or de∣sign  SPANIOLET etched a few prints in a very spirited manner No master understood better the force of every touch SILENUS  and  BACCHUS and the  Martyrdom of St  BARTHOLOMEW are the best of his historical prints and yet these are inferior to some of his charicaturas which are admira∣bly executed  MICHAEL DORIGNY or OLD DORIGNY as he is often called to distinguish him from NICHOLAS had the misfortune to be the son in law of SIMON VOUET whose works he engraved and whose imperfections he copied His execution is free and he preserves the lights extremely well upon single figures his drapery too is natural and easy but his  drawing is below criticism in the extremities especially In this his master misled him VOUET excel∣led in composition of which we have many beautiful instances in DO∣RIGNY'S prints  VILLAMENA was inferior to few engravers If he be deficient in strength and effect there is a delicacy in his manner which is inimitable One of his best prints is a  descent from the cross  But his works are so rare that we can scarce form an adequate idea of his merit  STEPHEN DE LA BELLA was a minute genius His manner wants strength for any larger work but  in small objects it appears to advan∣tage there is great freedom in it and uncommon neatness His fi∣gures are touched with spirit and sometimes his composition is good but he seldom discovers any skill in the management of light though the defect is less striking because of the smallness of the pieces His  Pont Neuf  will give us an idea of his works Through the bad ma∣nagement of the light it makes no appearance as a  whole  tho' the composition if we except the modern architecture is tolerable But the figures are marked with great beauty and the distances extremely fine Some of his single heads are very elegant  LA FAGE'S works consist chiefly of scetches The great excellency of this master lay in drawing in which he was perfectly skilled How∣ever unfinished his pieces are they discover him to have been admira∣bly acquainted with anatomy and proportion There is very little in him besides that is valuable grace and expression sometimes seldom composition his figures are gene∣rally either too much crowded or too diffuse As for light and shade he seems to have been totally igno∣rant of their effect or he could never have shewn so bad a taste as to publish his designs without at least a bare expression of the masses of each Indeed we have positive proof as well as negative Where  he has attempted an effect of light he has shewn only how little he knew of it  His genius chiefly displays itself in the gambols of nymphs and satyrs in routs and revels but there is so much obscenity in his works of this kind that altho' otherwise fine they scarce afford an innocent entertain∣ment  In some of his prints in which he has attempted the sublimest cha∣racters he has given them a wonder∣ful dignity Some of his figures of Christ are not inferior to the ideas of RAPHAEL and in a slight scetch intitled  Vocation de Moyse  the Deity is introduced with surprizing majesty  His best works are slightly etched from his drawings by ERTINGER who has done justice to them  BOLSWERT engraved the works of RUBENS and in a stile worthy of his master You see the same free and animated manner in both It is said that RUBENS touched his proofs and it is probable the ideas of the painter are so exactly transfused into the works of the engraver  PONTIUS too engraved the works of RUBENS and would have ap∣peared a greater master if he had not had such a competitor as BOLS∣WERT  SCIAMINOSSI etched a few small plates of the  mysteries of the rosary  in a masterly style There is no great beauty in the composition but the drawing is good the figures are generally graceful and the heads touched with great spirit  ROMAN LE HOOGHE is inimita∣ble in execution Perhaps no master etches in a freer and more spirited manner there is a richness in it likewise which we seldom meet with His figures too are often good but his composition is gene∣rally faulty it is crouded and con∣fused He knows little of the effect of light There is a flutter in him too which hurts an eye pleased with  simplicity His prints are very his∣torical The  deluge at Coeverden  is finely described LE HOOGHE was much employed by the authors of his time in composing frontis∣pieces some of which are very beautiful  LUIKEN etches in the manner of LE HOOGHE but it is a less masterly manner His  history of the bible  is a great work in which there are many good figures and great freedom of execution but poor composition much confusion and little skill in the distribution of light This master hath also etched a book of various kinds of capital punish∣ments amongst which there are many good prints  GERRARD LAIRESSE etches in a loose and unfinished but free and masterly manner His light is often well distributed but his shades have not sufficient strength to give his pieces effect Though he was a Dutch painter you see nothing of the Dutchman in his works His composition is generally grand and beautiful especially where he has only a few figures to manage His figures themselves are graceful and his expression strong The simple and sublime ideas which appear every where in his works acquired him the title of the  Dutch  RAPHAEL a title which he very well deserves LAIRESSE may be called an ethic painter He commonly inculcates some truth either in morals or reli∣gion  which he illustrates by a Latin sentence at the bottom of his print It may be added that his drape∣ries are particularly excellent  CASTIGLIONE was an Italian painter of some eminence He drew human figures with grace and cor∣rectness yet he generally chose such subjects as would admit the intro∣duction of animal life which often makes the most distinguished part of his piece  There is a simplicity in the designs of this master which is very beau∣tiful In composition he excells greatly Of his elegant groups we have many instances in a set of prints etched from his paintings  in a slight free manner by C MACEE particularly in those of the  patriar∣chal journeyings  He hath left us several of his  own  etchings also which are very valuable The sub∣jects indeed of some of them are odd and fantastic and the compo∣sition not equal to some prints we have from his paintings by other hands but the execution is greatly superior Freedom strength and spirit are very eminent in them and delicacy likewise where he chuses to finish highly of which we have some instances One of his best prints is the  entrance of  NOAH  into the ark  The composition the distribution of light the spirit and expression with which the ani∣mals are touched and the freedom  of the execution are all admira∣ble  VANDER MUILEN has given us historical representations of several modern battles His prints are ge∣nerally large and contain many good figures and agreable groups but they have no effect and sel∣dom produce a  whole  A disagre∣able monotony as the musical peo∣ple speak runs through them all  OTHO VENIUS has entire∣ly the air of an Italian tho' of Dutch parentage He had the ho∣nour of being the master of the celebrated RUBENS who chiefly learned from him his knowledge of light and shade This artist pub∣lished  a book of loveemblems in which the Cupids are engraved with great spirit His pieces of fabulous history have less merit  MELLAN was a whimsical en∣graver He shadowed entirely with parallel lines which he winds round the muscles of his figures and the folds of his draperies with great variety and beauty His manner is soft and delicate but void of strength and effect His compositions of course make no  whole  tho' his sin∣gle figures are often elegant His saints and statues are in general his best pieces There is great expres∣sion in many of the former and his drapery is often incomparable One of his best prints is inscribed  Per se surgens  and another very good one with this strange passage from St AUSTIN  Ego evangelio non crederem nisi me catholicae ecclesiae com∣moveret auctoritas  His head of Christ effected by a single spiral line is a masterly but whimsical performance  OSTADE'S etchings like his pic∣tures are admirable representations of low life They abound in hu∣mour and expression in which lies their great merit They have little besides to recommend them The composition is generally very indiffe∣rent and the execution no way re∣markable Sometimes and but sel∣dom you see a good effect of light  CORNELIUS BEGA etches very much in the manner of OSTADE but with more freedom  VAN TULDEN has nothing of the Dutch master in his design which seems formed upon the study of the antique It is chaste elegant and correct His manner is rather firm and distinct than free and spirited His principal work is  the voyage of  ULYSSES  in fiftyeight plates  in which we have a great variety of elegant attitudes excellent charac∣ters of heads good drawing and tho' not much effect yet often good grouping His drapery is heavy  JOSEPH PARROCELLE painted battles for LEWIS XIV He etched also several of his own designs The best of his works are eight small battles which are very scarce Four of these are of a size larger than the rest of which two the  battle  and  stripping the slain  are very fine Of the four smaller that entitled  vesper  is the best His manner is rough free and masterly and his knowledge of the effect of light con∣siderable His greatest undertaking was the  Life of Christ  in a series of plates but it is a hasty and incor∣rect work Most of the prints are mere scetches and many of them even in that light are bad tho' the freedom of the manner is pleasing in the worst of them The best  plates are the th th th d th th st d and d  V LE FEBRE etched many designs from TITIAN and JULIO ROMANO in a very miserable manner His drawing is bad his drapery fritte∣red his lights illpreserved and his execution disgusting and yet we find his works in capital collec∣tions  BELLANGE'S prints are highly finished and his execution is not amiss His figures also have some∣thing in them which looks like grace and his light is tolerably well massed But his heads are illset on his extremities incorrectly touch∣ed his figures badly proportioned  and in short his drawing in general very bad  CLAUDE GILLOT was a French painter but finding himself rivalled he laid aside his pencil and employ∣ed himself entirely in etching His common subjects are  dances  and  re∣vels  in which he introduces satyrs nymphs and fawns By giving his sylvans a peculiar cast of eye he has introduced a new kind of character The invention and fancy of this master are very pleasing and his composition is often good His man∣ner is slight which is the best apo∣logy for his bad drawing  WATTEAU has great defects and it must be owned great merit He  abounds in all that flutter and af∣fectation which is so disagreable in the generality of French painters But at the same time we acknow∣ledge he draws well gives grace and delicacy to his figures and pro∣duces often a beautiful effect of light I speak chiefly of such of his works as have been engraved by othersHe etched a few slight plates himself with great freedom and elegance The best of them are contained in a small book of figures in various dresses and attitudes  CORNELIUS SCHUT excells chiefly in execution sometimes in compo∣sition but he knows nothing of grace and has upon the whole but little merit  WILLIAM BAUR etches with great spirit His largest works are in the historical way He has given us many of the sieges and battles which wasted Flanders in the sixteenth cen∣tury They  may  be exact and pro∣bably they  are  but they are rather plans than pictures and have little to recommend them but historic truth and the freedom of the execution BAUR'S best prints are some charac∣ters he has given us of different na∣tions in which the peculiarities of each are very well preserved His OVID is a poor performance  COYPEL hath left us a few prints of his own etching the principal of which is an  Ecce homo  touched with great spirit Several of his own de∣signs  he etched himself and after∣wards put into the hands of engra∣vers to finish It is probable he overlooked this work but it is probable also that we should have had better prints if we had received them pure from his own needle What they had lost in force would have been amply made up in spirit  PICART was one of the most in∣genious of the French engravers His  imitations  are among the most entertaining of his works The cry in his day ran wholly in favour of antiquity "No modern masters were worth looking at" PICART piqued at such prejudice etched several pieces in imitation of ancient ma∣sters and so happily that he al∣most  outdid in their own excellen∣cies the artists whom he copied These prints were much admired as the works of GUIDO REMBRANDT and others Having had his joke he published them under the title of  Impostures innocentes  PICART'S own manner is highly finished yet at the same time rich bold and spirited His prints are generally small and most of them from the designs of others One of the best is from that beautiful composition of POUSSIN in which  Truth is delivered by Time from Envy  ARTHUR POND our countryman succeeded admirably in this method of imitation in which he hath etched several very valuable prints particu∣larly  two oval landskips after SAL∣VATOR a monkey in red chalk after CARRACHE two or three ruins after PANINI and some others equally excellent  But this method of imitation hath been most successfully practised by  Count  CAYLUS an ingenious French nobleman whose works in this way are very voluminous He hath ran∣sacked the French king's cabinet and hath scarce left a master of any note from whose drawings he hath not given us excellent prints Inso∣much that if we had nothing re∣maining from those masters but  Count  CAYLUS'S works we should not want a very sufficient idea of them So versatile is his genius that  COMTE DE CAYLUS  with the same ease he presents us with an elegant outline from RAPHAEL a rough scetch from REMBRANDT and a delicate portrait from VAN∣DYKE  LE CLERC was an excellent en∣graver but chiefly in the petite stile He immortalized ALEXANDER and LEWIS XIV in miniature His genius seldom exceeds the dimen∣sions of six inches Within those limits he can draw up twenty thou∣sand men with great dexterity No artist except CALLOT and DELLA BELLA could touch a small figure with so much spirit He seems to have imitated CALLOT'S manner but his stroke is neither so firm nor so masterly  PETER BARTOLI etched with free∣dom tho' his manner is not agreeable His capital work is LANFRANK'S gallery  JAC FREII is an admirable en∣graver He unites in a great de∣gree strength and softness and comes as near the force of painting as an engraver can well do He employed himself chiefly in copying and has given us the strongest ideas of the works of several of the most emi∣nent masters He preserves the draw∣ing and expression of his original and often perhaps improves the effect You see him in perfection in a noble print from MARATTE intitled  In conspectu angelorum psallam tibi  S GRIBELIN is a careful and laborious engraver of no extensive genius but painfully exact His works are chiefly small the princi∣pal of which are his copies from the BanquettingHouse at Whitehall and from the Cartoons His man∣ner is formal yet he has contrived to preserve the spirit of his original We have no copies of the cartoons so good as his It is a pity he did not engrave them on a larger scale  LE BAS etches in a clear di∣stinct free manner and has done great honour to the works of TE∣NIERS WOVERMAN and BERG∣HEM from whom he chiefly copied The best of his works are after BERG∣HEM  BISCHOP'S etching has something very pleasing in it It is loose and free and yet has strength and rich∣ness Many of his statues are good figures the drawing is sometimes incorrect but the execution beau∣tiful Many of the plates of his drawingbook are very well His greatest single work is the represen∣tation of JOSEPH  in Egypt  in which there are many faults both in the drawing and effect some of which are chargeable upon him and others upon the artist from whom he copied but upon the whole it is a pleasing print  FRANCIS PERRIER was the de∣bauched son of a goldsmith in Franchecompte His indiscretions  forcing him from home his incli∣nations led him to Rome His manner of travelling thither was whimsical He joined himself to a blind beggar whom he agreed to lead for half his alms At Rome he applied to painting and made a much greater proficiency than could have been expected from his dissipa∣ted life He published a large col∣lection of statues and other antiqui∣ties which are etched in a very ma∣sterly manner The drawing is often incorrect but the attitudes are well chosen and the execution spirited Many of them seem to have been done hastily but there are marks of ge∣nius in them all  MAROT who was architect to K  WILLIAM hath etched some statues likewise in a very masterly manner Indeed all his works are admirably executed but they consist chiefly of ornaments in the way of his pro∣fession  FRAN ROETTIERS etches in a very bold manner and with a good deal of spirit but there is a harsh∣ness in his outline which is disagre∣able tho' the less so as his drawing is generally good Few artists ma∣nage a crowd better or give it more effect by a proper distribution of light Of this management we have some judicious instances in his two capital prints the  Assumption of the cross  and the  crucifixion  NICHOLAS DORIGNY was bred a lawyer but not succeeding at the bar he studied painting and after∣wards applied to engraving His capital work is the  Transfiguration  which Mr ADDISON calls the noblest print in the world It is unquestion∣ably a noble work but DORIGNY seems to have exhausted his genius upon it for he did nothing afterwards worth preserving His cartoons are very poor He engraved them in his oldage and was obliged to employ assistants who did not answer his ex∣pectation  MASTERS IN PORTRAIT  Among the masters in portrait REMBRANDT may take the lead His heads are admirable copies from nature and perhaps the best of his works There is infinite expression in them and character  VAN ULIET followed REM∣BRANDT'S manner which he hath in many things excelled Some of his heads nothing can exceed The force which he gives to every fea∣ture the roundness of the muscle the spirit of the execution the strength of the character and the effect of the whole are all admirable  J LIEVENS etches in the same style His heads are executed with great spirit and deserve a place in any collection of prints tho' they are certainly inferior to ULIET'S ULIET and LIEVENS etched some historical prints particularly the latter whose  Lazarus  after REMBRANDT is a noble work but their portraits are their best prints  Among the imitators of REM∣BRANDT we should not forget our countryman WORLIDGE who has very ingeniously followed the man∣ner of that master and sometimes improved upon him No man un∣derstood the drawing of an head bet∣ter  Many of VAN DYKE'S etchings do him great credit They are chiefly to be found in a collection of the por∣traits of eminent artists which VAN DYKE was at the expence of get∣ting engraved Several of these he etched himself They are done slightly but bear the character of a master LUKE VOSTERMAN is one of the best It is probable VAN DYKE made the drawings for most of the rest his manner is conspicuous in them all A very finished etch∣ing of an  Ecce homo  passes under the name of this master It is a good print upon the whole but not equal to what we might ex∣pect  We have a few prints of Sir PETER  PETER LELY'S etching likewise but there is nothing in them that is extraordinary  R WHITE was the principal en∣graver of portraits in CHARLES IId's reign but his works are miserable performances They are said to be good likenesses they may be so but they are wretched prints  BECKET and SIMONS are names which scarce deserve to be mentioned They were both metzotintoscra∣pers of note only because they were the best of their time  WHITE the metzotinto scraper son of the engraver was an artist of great merit He copied after Sir  GODFREY KNELLER whom he teized so much with his proofs that it is said Sir GODFREY forbad him his house His metzotinto's are very beautiful BAPTISTE WING STUR∣GES and HOOPER are all admirable prints He himself used to say that old and young PARR were the best portraits he ever scraped His manner was peculiar at the time he used it tho' it hath since been adopted by other masters He first etched his plate and then scraped it Hence his prints pre∣serve a spirit to the last which few metzotintos do  SMITH was the pupil of BECKET but he soon excelled his master He was esteemed the best metzotintoscraper  His Royal Highness George Prince of Denmark  Eques pinx I Smith  ec Sold by I Smith at the Lyon and Crown in Russel street Covent Garden  portrait of Prince George  of his time tho' perhaps in∣ferior to WHITE He hath left a very numerous collection of portraits so numerous that they are often bound in two large folios He copied chiefly from Sir GODFREY and is said to have had an apartment in his house Lord SOMERS was so fond of the works of this master that he seldom travelled without carrying them with him in the seat of his coachSome of his best prints are two holy fami∣lies ANTHONY LEIGH MARY MAGDELINE SCALKEN an halflength of Lady ELIZABETH CROMWELL the Duke of SCHOM∣BERG on horseback the countess of SALISBURY GIBBON the statuary and a very fine hawking piece from WYKEAfter all it must be own∣ed  that the best of these metzotintos are inferior to what we have seen done by the masters of the present age  MELLAN'S portraits are the most indifferent of his works They want strength spirit and effect  PIAZZETA a Venetian hath lately published a set of heads in the style of MELLAN but in a much finer taste both as to the compositi∣on and the manner Tho' like MELLAN he never crosses his stroke yet he has contrived to give his heads more force and spirit  J MORIN'S heads are engraved in a very peculiar manner They are  pinx Vanity I Smith fec et ex  stippled with a graver after the manner of metzotinto and have a good effect They have force and at the same time softness Few por∣traits upon the whole are better GUIDO BENTIVOLIUS from VNA∣DYKE is one of the best  J LUTMA'S heads are executed in the same way we are told with a chissel and mallet They are infe∣rior to MORIN'S but are not with∣out merit  EDM MARMION etched a few portraits in the manner of VAN∣DYKE and probably from him in which there is great ease and free∣dom He has put his name only to one of them  DREVET'S portraits are neat and elegant but laboured to the last de∣gree They are copied from RI∣GAUD and other French masters and abound in all that flutter and licentious drapery so opposite to the simple and chaste ideas of true taste DREVET chiefly excells in copying RIGAUD'S frippery lace silk fur velvet and other ornamental parts of dress  RICHARDSON hath left us several heads which he etched for Mr POPE and others of his friends They are slight but shew the spirit of a master Mr POPE'S profile is the best  VERTUE was an excellent anti∣quarian  but no artist He copied with painful exactness in a dry dis∣agreeable manner without force or freedom In his whole collection of heads we can scarce pick out half a dozen which are good  Such an artist in metzotinto was FABER He has published nothing extremely bad and yet few things worth collecting  Mrs  COLLIER is one of his best prints and a very good one She is leaning against a pillar on the base of which is en∣graved the story of the golden apple  HOUBRAKEN is a genius and has given us in his collection of English portraits some pieces of engraving at least equal to any thing of the kind  Such are his heads of HAMBDEN SCHOMBERG the earl of BEDFORD the duke of RICHMOND particularly and some others At the same time we must own that he has intermix∣ed among his works a great number of bad prints In his best there is a wonderful union of softness and freedom A more elegant and flow∣ing line no artist surely ever em∣ployed  Our countryman FRY has left be∣hind him a few very beautiful heads in metzotinto They are all copied from nature have great softness and spirit but want strength Metzo∣tinto is not adapted to works so large as the heads he has published  MASTERS IN ANIMAL LIFE  BERGHEM has a genius truly pas∣toral and brings before us the most agreeable scenes of rural life The simplicity of Arcadian manners is no where better described than in his works We have a large collection of prints from his designs many etched by himself and many by o∣ther masters Those by himself are slight but masterly His execution is inimitable His cattle which are always the distinguishing part of his pieces are welldrawn admirably characterized and generally wellgrouped Few painters excelled more in composition than BERGHEM and  yet we have more beautiful instances of it in the prints etched by others than in those by himself Among his own etchings a few small plates of sheep and goats are exceedingly valued  J VISSCHER never appears to more advantage than when he copies BERGHEM His excellent drawing and the freedom of his execution give a great value to his prints which have more the air of originals than of copies He is a master both in etching and engraving His slightest etchings tho' copies only are the works of a master and when he touches with a graver he knows how to add strength and firmness without destroying freedom and spirit He  might be said to have done every thing well if he had not failed in the distribution of light it is more than probable he has not attended to the effect of it in many of the paintings which he has copied  HONDIUS a native of Rotterdam passed the greater part of his life in England He painted animals chief∣ly was free in his manner extrava∣gant in his colouring incorrect in his drawing ignorant of the effect of light but amazingly great in ex∣pression His prints therefore are better than his pictures They pos∣sess his chief excellency without his defects They are executed indeed with great spirit and afford such strong instances of animal fury as we meet  with no where but in nature itself His  hunted wolf  is an admirable print  DU JARDIN understood the ana∣tomy of domestic animals perhaps better than any other master His drawing is admirably correct and yet the freedom of the master is pre∣served He copied nature strictly tho' not servilely and hath given us not only the form but the charac∣teristic peculiarities of each animal He never indeed like HONDIUS animates his creation with the vio∣lence of savage fury His genius takes a milder turn All is quietness and repose His dogs after their exercise are stretched at their ease  and the languor of a meridian sun prevails commonly through all his pieces His composition is beautiful and his execution tho' neat is spi∣ritedHis works when bound to∣gether make a volume of about leaves among which there is scarce one bad print  REUBENS'S huntings are undoubt∣edly superior upon the whole to any thing of the kind we have There is more invention in them and a grander style of composition than we find any where else I class them under his name because they are en∣graved by several masters But all their engravings are poor They re∣semble the paintings they are copied from as a shadow does the object  which projects it There is some∣thing of the  shape  but all the  finish∣ing  is lost And indeed there is no doubt but the awkwardnesses the patchwork and the grotesque cha∣racters which every where appear in those prints are in the originals bold foreshortnings grand effects of light and noble instances of ex∣pressionBut it is as difficult to co∣py the flights of REUBENS as to translate those of HOMER The spi∣rit of each master evaporates in the process  WOVERMAN'S composition is ge∣nerally crouded with little ornaments There is no simplicity in his works He wanted a chaste judgment to cor∣rect his exuberanceVISSCHER was  the first who engraved prints from this artist He chose only a few good designs and executed them master∣lyMOYREAU undertook him next and hath published a large collection He hath finished them highly but with more softness than spirit His prints however have a neat appear∣ance and exhibit a variety of plea∣sing representations cavalcades marches huntings and encamp∣ments  ROSA of TIVOLI etched in a very finished manner No one outdid him in composition and execution He is very skilful too in the manage∣ment of light His designs are all pastoral and yet there is often a mixture of the heroic style in his  composition which is very pleasing His prints are scarce and were they not so would be valuable  STEPHEN DE LA BELLA may be mentioned among the masters in ani∣mal life tho' few of his works in this way deserve any other praise than what arises from the elegance of the execution In general his animals are neither well drawn nor justly characterized The best of his works in animal life are some heads of camels and dromedaries  ANTHONY TEMPESTA hath etch∣ed several plates of single horses and of huntings He hath given great expression to his animals but his composition is more than ordinarily  bad in these prints nor is there in any of them the least effect of light  J FYT hath etched a few animals in which you discover the drawing and something of that inimitable strength and spirit with which this master painted But he has only done a few detached things in this way nothing to shew his skill in compo∣sition and the management of light both which he well understood  In curious collections we meet with a few of CUYP'S etchings The  pic∣tures  of this master excell in colour∣ing composition drawing and the ex∣pression of character His  prints  have all these excellencies except the first  PETER DE LAER hath left us se∣veral  small etchings of horses and other animals well characterized and executed in a bold and masterly manner Many of them are single figures but when he composes his composition is generally good and his distribution of light seldom much amiss often very pleasing his drawing too is commonly good  PETER STOOP came from Lisbon with queen Catherine and was ad∣mired in England till WYCK'S su∣perior excellence in painting eclipsed him He hath etched a book of hor∣ses which are very much valued as there is in general accuracy in the drawing nature in the characters and spirit in the execution  REMBRANDT'S lions which are etched in his usual style are worthy the notice of a connoisseur  BLOTELING'S lions are highly fi∣nished but with more neatness than spirit  PAUL POTTER etched several plates of cows and horses in a master∣ly manner His manner indeed is better than his drawing which in his sheep especially is but very indif∣ferent neither does he characterize them with any accuracy  BARLOW'S etchings are numerous His illustration of Esop is his greatest work There is something pleasing in the composition and manner of this master tho' neither is excellent  His drawing too is very indifferent nor does he characterize any animal justly His birds in general are bet∣ter than his beasts  FLAMEN has etched several plates of birds and fishes the former are bad the latter better than any thing of the kind we have  HOLLAR has given us several plates in animal life which ought the ra∣ther to be taken notice of as they are the best of his works Two or three small plates of domestic fowls ducks woodcocks and other game are very well His shells and but∣terflies are beautiful and indeed these are the subjects suited to his ge∣nius  and it is a pity he did not con∣fine himself to them  I shall close this account with RI∣DINGER who is one of the greatest masters in animal life He is still living but as he is so capital in this way he must not be omitted This artist has marked the characters of animals especially of the more sa∣vage kind with surprizing expressi∣on His works may be considered as natural history He carries us into the forest among bears and tygers and with the exactness of a natura∣list describes their forms haunts and manner of livingHis compo∣sition is generally beautiful and his distribution of light good so that he commonly produces an agreeable whole His landskip too is picturesque  and romantic and well adapted to the subjects he treats On the other hand his manner is laboured and wants freedom His human fi∣gures are seldom drawn with taste His horses are illcharacterized and worse drawn and indeed his draw∣ing in general is but slovenly The prints of this master are often real history and represent the por∣traits of particular animals which had been taken in hunting We have sometimes too the story of the chace in highdutch at the bot∣tom of the print The idea of his∣torical truth adds a relish to the en∣tertainment and we survey the ani∣mal with new pleasure which has given diversion to a German prince for nine hours togetherThe pro∣ductions  of RIDINGER are very nu∣merous and the greater part of them good His huntings in general and different methods of catching animals are the least picturesque of any of his works But he meant them rather as didactic prints than as pictures Many of his fables are beautiful par∣ticularly the d the th the th and the th I cannot forbear ad∣ding a particular encomium upon a book of the heads of wolves and foxesHis most capital prints are two large uprights one representing bears devouring a deer the other wildboars reposing in a forest  MASTERS IN LANDSKIP  SADLER'S landskips have some merit in composition they are pic∣turesque and romantic but the man∣ner is dry and disagreeable the light is illdistributed the distances illkept and the figures badThere were three engravers of this name but none of them eminent JOHN engraved a set of prints for the bible and many other small plates in the historical way in which we some∣times find a graceful figure and to∣lerable drawing but on the whole no great merit EGIDIUS was the engraver of landskips and is the per∣son here criticized RALPH chiefly  copied the designs of BASSAN and engraved in the dry disagreeable man∣ner of his brother  REMBRANDT'S landskips have ve∣ry little to recommend them besides their effect which is often surpri∣zing One of the most admired of them goes under the name of  The three trees  GASPER POUSSIN etched a few landskips in a very loose but master∣ly manner It is a pity we have not more of his works  ABRAHAM BLOEMART understood the beauty of composition as well in landskip as in history His prints have little force through the want of a proper distribution of light Nei∣ther  is there much freedom in the ex∣ecution but there is generally great elegance in the design and great sim∣plicity  HOLLAR gives us views of parti∣cular places which he copies with great truth unornamented as he found them If we are satisfied with exact representations we have them no where better than in HOLLAR'S works but if we expect pictures we must seek them elsewhere HOL∣LAR was an antiquarian and a draughtsman but seems to have been unacquainted with any one prin∣ciple of painting Stiffness to the last degree is his characteristic and a pain∣ful exactness utterly void of all taste His larger views are mere plans In  some of his smaller at the expence of infinite pains something of an ef∣fect is sometimes produced But in general we consider him as a repo∣sitory of curiosities a record of an∣tiquated dresses abolished ceremonies and edifices now in ruins  STEPHEN DE LA BELLA'S land∣skips have little to recommend them besides their neatness and keeping There is no great beauty in his com∣position and the foliage of his trees resembles bits of spunge I speak chiefly of his larger works for which his manner is not calculated His great neatness qualifies him better for miniature  BOLSWERT'S landskips after REU∣BENS are composed in a very grand style Such a painter and such an engraver could not fail of producing something great There is little va∣riety in them nor any of the more minute beauties arising from contrasts catching lights and such little ele∣gancies but every thing is simple and great The print which goes by the name of  The waggon  is par∣ticularly and deservedly admired Of these prints you generally meet with good impressions as the plates are engraved with great strength  NEULANT hath etched a small book of the ruins of Rome in which there is great simplicity and some skill in composition and the dis∣tribution  of light but the execution is harsh and disagreeable  We have a few landskips by an earl of  Sunderland  in an elegant loose manner One of them in which is is a Spaniard standing on the fore∣ground is marked  G  and  J sculpse∣runt  another  J G  WATERLO is a name beyond any other in landskip His subjects are perfectly rural Simplicity is their characteristic We find no great va∣riety in them nor stretch of fancy He selects a few striking objects A coppice a corner of a forest a wind∣ingroad or a stragling village is ge∣nerally the extent of his view nor does he always introduce an offskip  His composition is generally good and his light often well distributed but his chief merit lies in execution in which he is a consummate master Every object that he touches has the character of nature but he par∣ticularly excells in the foliage of treesIt is a difficult matter to meet with the works of this master in perfection the original plates are all retouched and greatly injured  SWANEVELT painted landskip at Rome where he obtained the name of  the hermit  from his solitary walks among the ruins of TIVOLI and FRESCATI He etched in the man∣ner of WATERLO but with less freedom His trees in particular will bear no comparison with those  of that master And yet upon the whole his works have great merit We should think them excellent if the idea of WATERLO'S superiority in the same style of etching did not constantly recur  JAMES ROUSSEAU was the disci∣ple of SWANEVELT He was a French protestant and fled into Eng∣land from the persecution of Lewis XIV Here he was patronized by the duke of MONTAGUE whose palace now the  British Museum  he contributed to adorn with his paint∣ings some of which are very good The few etchings he hath left are very beautiful He understood com∣position and the distribution of light and there is a fine taste in his land∣skips  if we except perhaps only that his horizon is often taken too high Neither can his perspective at all times bear a critical examination and what is worse it is often pedanti∣cally introduced His figures are good in themselves and generally well placedHis manner is rather dry and formalROUSSEAU it may be added was an excellent man Having escaped the rage of persecu∣tion himself he made it his study to lessen the sufferings of his distressed brethren by distributing among them the greatest part of his gains Such an anecdote in the life of a painter should not be omitted even in so short a review as this  J LUTMA hath etched a few small landskips in a masterly manner which discover some skill in composition and the management of light  ISRAEL SYLVESTRE has given us small views some indeed of a larger size of most of the capital ruins churches bridges and castles in Italy and France They are ex∣ceedingly neat and touched with great spirit This master can give beauty even to the outlines of a mo∣dern building and what is more he gives it without injuring the truth insomuch that I have seen a gentleman just come from his travels pick out many of SYLVESTRE'S views one by one tho' he had never seen them before merely from his ac∣quaintance  with the buildings To his praise it may be farther added that in general he forms his view in∣to an agreeable whole and if his light is not always well distributed there are so many beauties in his ex∣ecution that the eye cannot find fault His works are very numerous and few of them are bad In trees he excels least  The etchings of CLAUDE LORRAIN are below his character We some∣times find good composition in them but little else His execution is bad there is a dirtiness in it which is disgusting his trees are heavy his lights seldom wellmassed and his distances only sometimes observed The truth is CLAUDE'S talents lay  upon his pallet and he could do no∣thing without it  PERELLE has great merit His fancy is exceedingly fruitful and supplies him with a richness and va∣riety in his views which nature sel∣dom exhibits It is indeed too ex∣uberant for he often confounds the eye with too great a luxuriancy His manner is his own and it is hard to say whether it excells most in richness strength elegance or free∣dom His trees are particularly beau∣tiful the foliage is loose and the ramification easy and graceful And yet it must be confessed that PERELLE is rather a mannerist than a co∣pier of nature His views are all ideal his trees are of one family  and his light tho' generally well distributed is sometimes affected it is introduced as a spot and is not properly melted into the neighbour∣ing shade by a middle tint Catch∣ing lights used sparingly are beau∣tiful PERELLE affects them These remarks are made principally upon the works of  old  PERELLE as he is called There were three en∣gravers of this name the grandfa∣ther the father and the son They all engraved in the same style but the juniors instead of improving the the familytaste degenerated The grandfather is the best and the grand∣son the worst  OVERBECK etched a book of Ro∣man ruins which are in general  good They are pretty large and highly finished His manner is free his light often well distributed and his composition agreeable  GENOEL'S landskips are rather free scetches than finished prints In that light they are beautiful No effect is aimed at but the free man∣ner in which they are touched is pleasing and the composition is in general good tho' often crouded  BOTH'S taste in landskip is elegant His ideas are grand his composition beautiful and his execution bold and masterly His light too is com∣monly well distributed and his fi∣gures are excellent We regret only that we have so few of his works  MARCO RICCI'S works which are numerous have little merit His human figures indeed are good and his trees tolerable but he produces no effect his manner is disgusting his cattle illdrawn and his distan∣ces illpreserved  ZEEMAN was a Dutch painter and excelled in seacoasts beaches and distant land which he common∣ly ornamented with skiffs and fish∣ingboats His execution is neat and his distances well kept Of the distribution of light he knows no∣thing and the foregrounds of ma∣ny of his prints are for that reason particularly bad But his figures are good and his skiffs admirable In his  seapieces  he introduces larger ves∣sels  but his prints in this style are commonly awkward and disagree∣able  VANDIEST left behind him a few rough scetches which are executed with great freedom  GOUPY very happily caught the manner of SALVATOR and in some things excelled him There is a rich∣ness in his execution and a spirit in his trees which SALVATOR wants But his figures are bad Very gross instances not only of indelicacy of out∣line but even of bad drawing may be found in his print of PORSENNA and in that of DIANA Landskip is his sort and his best prints are those which go under the titles of the  La∣trones  the  Augurs Tobit Hagar  and its companion  Our celebrated countryman HO∣GARTH cannot properly be omitted in a catalogue of engravers and yet he ranks in none of the foregoing classes With this apology I shall in∣troduce him here  The works of this master abound in true humour and satyr which is generally welldirected they are admirable moral lessons and a fund of entertainment suited to every taste a circumstance which shews them to be just copies of nature We may consider them too as valuable reposi∣tories of the manners customs and dresses of the present age What a fund of entertainment would a col∣lection  of this kind afford drawn from every period of the history of BritainHow far the works of HO∣GARTH will bear a  critical examinati∣on  may be the subject of a little more enquiry  In  design  HOGARTH was seldom at a loss His invention was fertile and his judgment accurate An im∣proper incident is rarely introduced a proper one rarely omitted No one could tell a story better or make it in all its circumstances more intelli∣gible His genius however it must be owned was suited only to  low  or  familiar  subjects It never soared above  common  life to subjects natu∣rally sublime or which from anti∣quity or other accidents borrowed dignity he could not rise  In  composition  we see little in him to admire In many of his prints the deficiency is so great as plainly to shew a want of all principles it makes us ready to believe that when we do meet with a beautiful group it is the effect of chance In one of his minor works the  Idle 'prentice  we seldom see a croud more beautifully managed than in the last print If the she∣riff's officers had not been placed in a line and had been brought a little lower in the picture so as to have formed a pyramid with the cart the composition had been unexceptiona∣ble and yet the first print of this work is such a striking instance of disagreeable composition that it is amazing how an artist who had any idea of beautiful forms could  suffer so unmasterly a performance to leave his hands  Of the  distribution of light  HO∣GARTH had as little knowledge as of  composition  In some of his pieces we see a good effect as in the  Exe∣cution  just mentioned in which if the figures at the right and left cor∣ners had been  kept down  a little the light would have been beautifully distributed on the foreground and a fine secondary light spread over part of the croud but at the same time there is so obvious a deficiency in point of effect in most of his prints that it is very evident he had no prin∣ciples  Neither was HOGARTH a master in  drawing  Of the muscles and ana∣tomy of the head and hands he had  perfect knowledge but his trunks are often badly moulded and his limbs ill set on I tax him with plain bad drawing I speak not of the ni∣ceties of anatomy and elegance of outline of these indeed he knew nothing nor were they of use in that mode of design which he cultivated and yet his figures upon the whole are inspired with so much life and meaning that the eye is kept in goodhumour in spite of its inclina∣tion to find fault  The author of the  Analysis of beau∣ty  it might be supposed would have given us more instances of  grace  than we find in the works of HOGARTH which shews strongly that theory and practice are not always united Many opportunities his subjects naturally  afford of introducing graceful atti∣tudes and yet we have very few ex∣amples of them With instances of picturesque grace his works abound  But of his  expression  in which the force of his genius lay we cannot speak in terms too high In every mode of it he was truely ex∣cellent The passions he thoroughly understood and all the effects which they produce in every part of the hu∣man frame he had the happy art also of conveying his ideas with the same precision with which he con∣ceived them He was excellent too in expressing any humourous oddity which we often see stamped upon the human face All his heads are cast in the very mould of nature Hence that endless variety which is dis∣played  through his works and hence it is that the difference arises between  his  heads and the affected charica∣turas of  those masters  who have sometimes amused themselves with patching together an assemblage of features from their own ideas Such are SPANIOLET'S which tho' ad∣mirably executed appear plainly to have no archetypes in nature HO∣GARTH'S on the other hand are collections of natural curiosities The  Oxfordheads  the  physiciansarms  and some of his other pieces are expresly of this humourous kind They are truly comic tho' illna∣tured effusions of mirth more en∣tertaining than SPANIOLET'S as they are pure nature but less inno∣cent as they contain illdirected ridi∣culeBut  the species of expression in which this master perhaps most excels is that happy art of catching those peculiarities of air and gesture which the ridiculous part of every profession contract from their peculi∣ar situation and which for that rea∣son become characteristic of the whole His counsellors his under∣takers his lawyers his usurers are all conspicuous at sight In a word almost every profession may see in his works that particular species of affec∣tation which they should most en∣deavour to avoid  The  execution  of this master is well suited to his subjects and manner of treating them He etches with great spirit and never gives one unnecessary stroke For myself I greatly more  value the works of his own needle than those highfinished prints on which he employed other engravers For as the production of an effect is not his talent and as this is the chief excellence of highfinishing his own rough manner is certainly preferable in which we have most of the force and spirit of his expression The  man∣ner  in none of his works pleases me so well as in a small print of a cor∣ner of a playhouse There is more spirit in a work of this kind struck off at once warm from the imagi∣nation than in all the cold correct∣ness of an elaborate engraving If all his works had been executed in this style with a few improve∣ments in the composition and the management of light they would  certainly have been a much more valuable collection of prints than they are The  rake's progress  and some of his other works are both etched and engraved by himself they are well done but it is plain he meant them as furniture As works designed for a critick's eye they would certainly have been better without the engraving except a few touches in a very few places The want of effect too would have been less conspicuous which in his high∣est finished prints is disagreeably striking  CHAPTER IV  Remarks on particular Prints  THE RESURRECTION OF LA∣ZARUS BY BLOEMART  WITH regard to  design  this print has great merit The point of time is very judiciously cho∣sen It is a point between the first command  Lazarus come forth  and  the second  Loose him and let him go  The first astonishment of the two sisters is now over The predomi∣nant passion is gratitude which is discovering itself in praise One of the attendents is telling the yet stu∣pified man "That is your sister" He himself collecting his scattered ideas directs his gratitude to Christ Jesus directs it farther to heaven So far the design is good But what are those idle figures on the right hand and on the left some of them seem no way concerned in the action Two of the principal of them are introduced as gravediggers but even in that capacity they were unwanted for  the place  we are told  was a cave and a stone rolled upon the mouth  When a painter is employed on a  barren subject he must make up his groups as he is able but there is no barrenness here and the painter might with propriety have introdu∣ced in the room of the gravediggers some of the Pharisaical party malig∣ning the action Such we are told were on the spot They are figures of consequence in the story and ought not to have been shoved back as they are among the appendages of the piece  The  composition  is almost faultless The principal group is finely disposed It's form is nearly that of a rightan∣gled triangle The hand of Christ is the apex The kneeling figure and the dark figure looking up make the two other angles The group  opens in a beautiful manner and dis∣covers every part It is equally beau∣tiful when considered as combined with the figures on the left It then forms an easy inclined plane of which the highest figure is the apex and the dark figure just mentioned on the left of Lazarus is the angle at the base Such combinations of trian∣gular forms have a fine effect  The  light  is very illdistributed tho' the figures are disposed to receive the most beautiful effect of it The whole is one glare It had been bet∣ter if all the figures on the elevated ground on the right had been in strong shadow The extended arm the head and shoulder of the gravedigger might have received catching  lights A little more light might have been thrown upon the principal figure and a little less upon the fi∣gure kneeling The remaining fi∣gures on the left should have been kept down Thus the light would have centered strongly upon the ca∣pital group and would have faded gradually away  The single figures are in general good The principal one indeed is not so capital as might be wished The character is not quite pleasing the right arm is aukwardly introdu∣ced if not illdrawn and the whole disagreably incumbered with drape∣ryLazarus is very fine the draw∣ing the expression and grace of the figure are all goodThe figure  kneeling is not very graceful but it contrasts with the groupThe gravediggers are both admirable fi∣gures It is a pity they should be incumbrances only  The  drawing  is good yet there seems to be something amiss in the pectoral muscles of the gravedigger on the right The hands too in general of all the figures are con∣strained and aukward Few of them are in natural action  The  manner  is strong distinct and expressive It is mere engraving without any etching The drapery of the kneeling figure is particularly well touched as are also the head and leg of LAZARUS and the gravedigger on the left  THE DEATH OF POLYCRATES BY SALVATOR ROSA  The  story  is well told every part is fully engaged in the subject and properly subordinate to it  The  disposition  is agreeable The contrivance of the groups falling one into another is very pleasing And yet the form would have been more beautiful if a ladder with a figure upon it a piece of loose drapery a standard or some other object had been placed on the left side of the cross to have filled up that formal vacancy in the shape of a rightan∣gle and to have made the pyramid more compleat The groups them∣selves  are simple and elegant The three figures on horseback indeed are had A line of heads is always unpleasing  We have no idea of  keeping  The whole has only one surface which might have been prevented by a lit∣tle more strength on the foreground and a slighter sky  The  light  is distributed without any judgment It might perhaps have been improved if the group of the soldier resting upon his shield had been in shadow with a few catching lights This shadow pas∣sing through the label might have extended over great part of the foreground above it by which we should have had a body of shadow to balance the light of the centregroup The  lower figures of the equestriangroup might have received a middle tint with a few strong touches the up∣per figures might have caught the light to detach them from the ground  With regard to the figures taken separately they are almost unexcep∣tionably good You will seldom in∣deed see so many good figures in any collection of such a number The young soldier leaning over his shield the other figures of that group the soldier pointing in the middle of the picture and the figure behind him spreading his hands are all in the highest degree elegant and graceful The distant figures too are beautiful The expression in the whole body of the spectators is very striking  Some are more and some less affec∣ted but every one in a degree All the figures however are not fault∣less POLYCRATES hangs ungrace∣fully upon his cross his body is too much made up of parallel lines and right angles His face is strongly marked with agony but his legs are disproportioned to his bodyThe three lower figures of the equestriangroup are bad They are properly placed to catch the abruptness of the centregroup and finish the pyra∣midal form but they might have had a little more meaning and a little more graceOne of the eques∣trian figures also that nearest the cross is formal and disgusting and as to an horse SALVATOR seems not to have had the least idea of the pro∣portion  and anatomy of that ani∣mal  The scenery is inimitable The rock broken and covered with shrubs at the top and afterwards spreading into one grand and simple shade is in itself a pleasing object and affords an excellent background to the fi∣gures  The  execution  of this print is equal to that of any of SALVATOR'S works The passages in which this master's  manner  is more particularly characte∣rized are the soldier sitting with the shield the pointing figure in the middle group the head in armour behind it the distant groups imme∣diately on the right and left of the cross and the scenery in general  THE TRIUMPH OF SILENUS BY PETER TESTA  P TESTA seems in this elegant and masterly performance as far as his sublime ideas can be comprehend∣ed to intend a satyr upon drunken∣ness  The  design  seems to be perfect The God is introduced in the middle of the piece holding an ivycrown and supported by his train in all the pomp of unwieldy majesty Before him dance a band of bacchanalian ri∣oters while Intemperance De∣bauchery and unnatural Lusts com∣pleat the immoral festival In the offskip rises the temple of Priapus  hard by a mountain dedicated to lewdness nymphs and satyrs In the heavens are represented the  Moon  and  Stars  pushing back the  Sun  to shew that the actions of which this night was a witness dreaded the ap∣proach of light  The  disposition  has less merit yet is not unpleasing The  whole  group on the left of SILENUS and the  se∣veral parts  of it are happily dispo∣sed The group of dancers on the other side is crouded and illshapen It is disagreeable too for want of con∣trast The two principal figures each standing on one leg appear dis∣gusting counterparts The  whole  I speak only of the terrestrial groups is disposed in the form of an easy in∣clined  plane which partakes as lit∣tle as possible of the pyramidal form It might perhaps have had a better effect if an elegant canopy had been holden over SILENUS which would have been no improper appendage and by bringing the apex of the pyramid over the principal figure would hav  given more variety to the whole The sameness too in the dis∣position of the etherial and the ter∣restrial figures which is rather dis∣pleasing would have been prevented by this slight alteration  The  light  with regard to  particu∣lar figures  is very beautiful But such a light at best gives you only the idea of a picture examined by a can∣dle Every figure as you hold the  candle to it appears well lighted but instead of an  effect  of light you have only a succession of  spots  In∣deed the light is not only ill but absurdly distributed The upper part is inlightened by one sun and the lower part by another the direction of the light being different in each Should we endeavour to amend it it might be better perhaps to leave out the Sun and to represent him by his symbols as  approaching  only The skyfigures would of course re∣ceive catching lights and might be left nearly as they are The figure of  Rain  under the  Moon  should be in shadow The bear too and the li∣on's head should be  kept down  Thus there would be nothing glaring in the celestial figures For SILENUS and  his train they might be enlightened by a very strong torchlight which might be carried by the dancing fi∣gures The light would then fall nearly as it does upon the principal group The other figures should be  brought down  to a middle tint This kind of light would naturally produce a gloom in the background but there is no occasion to make it dark as more torchlight might be suppo∣sed  With regard to the figures taken separately they are conceived with such classical purity and simplicity of taste so elegant in the drawing so graceful in every attitude and at the same time marked with such man∣ly expression that if I were obliged to fix upon any print as an example  of all the beauties of which single figures are capable of receiving I should be tempted to give the prefe∣rence to this tho' at the same time it must be owned that some of them give you too much the idea of mar∣ble  The most striking instances of fine  drawing  are seen in the principal fi∣gure in the legs of the figure that supports him and in those of the fi∣gure dancing with the pipes in the man and woman behind the centaur in the figure in the clouds with his right hand over his knee in the A∣pollo and particularly in that bold foreshortened figure of the sign Ca∣pricorn  Instances of  expression  we have in the unweildiness of SILENUS He  appears so dead a weight so totally unelastic that every part of him which is not supported sinks with its own gravity The sensibility too with which his bloated body like a quagmire feels every touch is strong∣ly expressed in his countenance The figure which supports him expres∣ses in every muscle the labour of the action The dancing figures if we except that with the thyrsus are all strongly characterized The pushing figures in the sky are marked with great expression and above all the threatning Capricorn who is repre∣sented in the act of drawing a bow  With regard to  grace  every figure at least every capital one is agreeable if we except only that figure which lies kicking its legs upon the ground  But we have the strongest instances of grace in the figure dancing with the pipes in the man and woman behind the centaur which it is not im∣probable might be designed for BAC∣CHUS and ARIADNE and in the boy lying on the ground  With regard to  execution  we rarely see an instance of it in greater perfec∣tion Every head every muscle and every extremity is touched with infi∣nite spirit The very appendages are fine and the stonepines which adorn the background are marked with such taste and precision as if landskip had been this artist's only study  SMITH'S PORTRAIT OF THE DUKE OF SHOMBERG FROM KNELLER  KNELLER even when he laid him∣self out to excel was often but a taw∣dry painter His equestrian portrait of king WILLIAM at Hamptoncourt is a very unmasterly perform∣ance the composition is bad the colouring gaudy the whole is void of effect and there is scarce a good figure in itThe composition before us is more pleasing tho' the effect is little better An equestrian figure at best is an aukward subject The legs of an horse are great incumbran∣ces in grouping VANDYKE indeed has managed king CHARLES the First  on horseback with great judgment and RUBENS too at Hamptoncourt has made a noble picture of the duke of ALVA tho' his horse is very illdrawnIn the print before us the figure sits with grace and dignity but the horse is no Bucephalus its character is only that of a managed∣pad The bush growing by the duke's trunchion is a trifling circum∣stance and helps to break into more parts a composition already too much brokenThe  execution  is throughout excellent and tho' the parts are ra∣ther too small for metzotinto yet SMITH has given them all their force  PETHER'S METZOTINTO OF REM∣BRANDT'S JEWISH RABBI  The character is that of a stern haughty man big with the idea of his own importance The  rabbi  is probably fictitious but the  carac∣ter  was certainly taken from nature There is great dignity in it which in a work of REMBRANDT'S is the more extraordinaryThe full ex∣pression of it is given us in the print The unelastic heaviness of age which is so well described in the original is as well preserved in the copy The three equidistant lights on the head on the ornament and on the hands are disagreeable  in the print they could not be remov∣ed but it might have been judicious to have  kept down  the two latter a little moreWith regard to the ex∣ecution every part is scraped with the utmost softness and delicacy The muscles are round and plump and the insertions of them which in an old face are very apparent are well expressed Such a variety of middle tints and melting lights were difficult to manage and yet they are managed with great tenderness The looseness of the beard is masterly The hands are exactly those of a fat old man The stern eyes are full of life and the nose and mouth are ad∣mirably touched The separation of the lips in some parts and adhesion in others are characteristic strokes  and happily preserved The folds and lightness of the turban are very ele∣gant The robe about the shoulder is unintelligible and illmanaged but this was the painter's faultIn a word when we examine this very beautiful metzotinto we must ac∣knowledge that no engraving can equal it in softness and delicacy  HONDIUS'S HUNTED WOLF  The composition in this little print is good and yet there is too much similitude in the direction of the bo∣dies of the several animals The shape also of the group would have been more pleasing if the vertical angle had been rather more acute The group is too much broken also and wants solidity The horizon is taken too high unless the dimensi∣ons of the print had been higher The risingground above the wolf's head had been offskip enough and yet the rock which rises higher is so beautifully touched that it would be a pity to remove itThe  light  is  distributed without any judgment It might have been improved if all the interstices among the legs and heads of the animals had been  kept down  and the shadow made very strong under the fawn and the woun∣ded dog This would have given a bold relief to the figures and might without any other alteration have produced a good effectThe  draw∣ing  is not faultless The legs and body of the wounded dog are but very inaccurate nor does the attacking dog stand firm upon his right leg With regard to  expression  HONDIUS has exerted his full force The ex∣pression both of the wounded dog and of the wolf is admirable but the expression of the attacking dog is a most bold and masterly copy from  nature His attitude shews every nerve convulsed and his head is a masterpiece of animal fury We should add that the slaughtered ani∣mal is so illcharacterized that we scarce know what it is The  execution  is equal to the expression It is neat and highly finished but discovers in every touch the spirit of a mas∣ter  THE th PLATE OF DU JARDIN'S ANIMALS  The  design  tho' humble is simple and beautiful The two dogs repo∣sing at noon after the labour of the morning the impliments of fowling the fictitious hedge and the loop∣holes through it all correspond to∣gether and agreeably tell the little history of the dayThe  composition  is beautiful tho' it might have been improved if another dog or some∣thing equivalent had been introduced in the vacancy at the left corner This would have given the group of dogs a better form The nets and fowlingpieces are judiciously added  and make an agreeable shape with the dogs The hedge also adds another pyramidal form which would have been more pleasing if the left cor∣ner of the reeds had been a little higherThe  light  is well distribu∣ted only there is too much of it The farther dog might have been  taken down  a little and the hinder parts of the nearerThe  drawing  and  expression  are pure nature and the  execution  elegant and masterly  WATERLO'S TOBIAS  The landskip I mean is an up∣right of the largest size which this master ever used near twelve inches in height by ten On the near ground stands an oak which forms a diagonal through the print The second distance is composed of a rising ground connected with a rock which is covered with shrubs The oak and the shrubs make a vista through which you have an extensive view into the coun∣try The figures which consist of an angel Tobias and a dog are de∣scending an hill which forms the second distance The print with  the description cannot be mistaken The  composition  is very pleasing The trees on the foreground spreading over the top of the print and sloping to a point at the bottom give the beautiful form of an inverted pyra∣mid which in trees especially has often a fine effect To this form the inclined plane on which the figures stand and which is beautifully bro∣ken is a good contrast The rock approaches to a perpendicular and the distance to an horizontal line All together make such a combina∣tion of beautiful and contrasting shapes that the whole is very plea∣sing If I should find fault with any thing it is the regularity of the rocks There is no variety in parrel∣lel lines and it had been very easy  to have broken themThe  keeping  is very accurate The second and third distance are both judiciously managedThe  light  is beautifully disposed To prevent heaviness it is introduced upon the tree both at the top and bottom but it is pro∣perly  kept down  A mass of shade succeeds upon the ground of the se∣cond distance and is continued upon the water The light breaks in a blaze upon the bottom of the rock and masses the  whole  The trees shrubs and upper part of the rock are happily thrown into a middle tint to prevent extravagance Perhaps the effect of the distant country might have been better if all the lights up∣on it had been  kept down  except one easy catching light upon the town  and the rising ground on which it standsThe  execution  is exceedingly beautiful No artist had an happier manner of expressing trees than WA∣TERLO and the tree before us is one of his capital works The shape of it we have already criticized The bole and ramification are as beautiful as the shape The foliage if I were not afraid of speaking the language of extravagance seems the work of inchantment Such an union of strength and lightness is rarely found The extremities are touched with infinite tenderness the strong masses of light are relieved with sha∣dows equally strong and yet great ease and softness are preserved The foreground is highly inriched and indeed the whole print and every part of it is full of art and full of nature  THE DELUGE AT COEVERDEN BY ROMAN LE HOOGHE  This is an historical landskip a style very different from that of the last WATERLO had nothing in view but to form an agreeable pic∣ture He had all nature before him through which his imagination might range The figures he introduced unconnected with his subject serv∣ed only to embellish it Any o∣ther figures would have answered his design as well But LE HOOGHE was confined within narrower lines He had a  country  to describe and a  story  to tell The  country  is the en∣virons of Coeverden a Dutch town  with a view of that immense bank which the bishop of Munster in the year threw up and fortified at a vast expence to lay the town under water The  story  is the ruin of that bank which was broken through in three places by the vio∣lence of the waters in a storm The subject was great and difficult and yet the artist has acquitted himself in a masterly manner The town of Coeverden fills the distant view The country is spread with a deluge the sky with a tempest and the breaches in the bank appear in all their horrorThe  composition  in the distant and middle parts is as plea∣sing as such an extensive subject can be An elevated horizon which is always disgusting was necessary here  to give a distinct view of the whole The  light  too is thrown over the distant parts in good massesThe  expression  of the figures of the horses especially is very strong those which the driver is turning to avoid the horrid chasm before him are impressed with the wildest character of terror and indeed the whole scene of distress and the horrible confusion in every part of it are ad∣mirably describedThe  execution  is not equal to that of many of LE HOOGHE'S works The sky is hard and there is a dryness in the whole If in any part the master appears like himself it is in the figures on the left of the foregroundThere are other faults in this print The shape of it is bad A little more length  would have enlarged the idea and the town would have stood better not quite in the middleBut what is most faulty is the disproportion and littleness of the foreground on the right The spirit which the artist had maintained through the whole description flags miserably here Whereas  here  he should have closed the whole with some vast and noble confusion which would have given  keeping  to the distant parts and struck the spectator with the strongest ima∣ges of horror Instead of this we are presented with a few pigs and calves floundering in the water The thought seems borrowed from OVID In the midst of a world in ruins  Nat lupus inter oves  HOGARTH'S RAKE'S PROGRESS  The first print of this capital work is an excellent representation of a young heir taking possession of a mi∣ser's effects The passion of avarice which hoards every thing without distinction what is and what is not valuable is admirably described The  composition  tho' not excellent is not unpleasing The principal group consisting of the young gen∣tleman the taylor the appraiser the papers and chest is agreeably shaped but the eye is hurt with the disagreeable regularity of three heads nearly in a line and at equal distan∣cesThe  light  is not illdisposed  It falls on the principal figures but the effect might have been improved If the extreme parts of the mass the white apron on one side and the memorandumbook on the other had been in shade the  repose  had been less injured The detached parts of a group should rarely catch a strong body of lightWe have no striking instances of  expression  in this print The principal figure is un∣meaning The only one which dis∣plays the true  vis comica  of HOGARTH is the appraiser fingering the gold You enter at once into his character The young woman might have furnished the artist with an opportu∣nity of presenting a graceful figure which would have been more plea∣sing The figure he  has  introduced  is by no means an object of allure∣mentThe  perspective  is accurate but affected So many windows and open doors may shew the author's learning but they break the background and injure the simplicity of it  The second print introduces our hero into all the dissipation of modish life We became first acquainted with him when a boy of eighteen He is now of age has entirely thrown off the clownish schoolboy and as∣sumes the man of fashion Instead of the countrytaylor who took measure of him for his father's mourn∣ing he is now attended by Frenchbarbers Frenchtaylors poets mil∣liners jockies bullies and the whole  retinue of a fine gentlemanThe  expression  in this print is wonder∣fully great The dauntless front of the bully the keen eye and elasti∣city of the fencingmaster and the simpering importance of the dancingmaster are admirably expressed The last is perhaps rather a little outrè and it may be added but very indif∣ferently drawn The architect is a strong copy from natureThe  com∣position  seems to be entirely subser∣vient to the expression It appears as if HOGARTH had scetched in his memorandumbook all the charac∣ters which he has here introduced but was at a loss how to group them and chose rather to introduce them in detached figures as he had scetch∣ed them than to lose any part of the  expression by combining themThe  light  is very ill distributed It is spread indiscriminately over the print and destroys the  whole  We have no instance of  grace  in any of the fi∣gures The principal figure is very deficient There is no contrast in the limbs which is always attended with a degree of ungracefulness The  execution  is very good It is ela∣borate and yet freeThe satyr on operas tho' it may be welldirected is forced and unnatural  The third plate carries us still deeper in the history We meet our hero engaged in one of his eveningamusements This print on the whole is no very extraordinary ef∣fort of geniusThe  design  is good  and may be a very exact description of the humours of a brothelThe  composition  too is not amiss But we have few of those masterly strokes which distinguish the works of HO∣GARTH The whole is plain history The lady setting the world on fire is the best thought and there is some humour in furnishing the room with a set of Caesars and not placing them in orderThe  light  is illmanaged By a few alterations which are ob∣vious particularly by throwing the lady dressing into the shade the disposition of it might have been to∣lerable But still we should have had an absurdity to answer whence comes it Here is light in abun∣dance but no visible source  Ex∣pression  we have very little through  the whole print The principal fi∣gure is the best The ladies have all the air of their profession but no variety of character HOGARTH'S women are in general very inferior to his men For which reason I pre∣fer the  rake's progress  to the  harlot's  The femaleface indeed has seldom strength of feature enough to admit the strong markings of expression  Very disagreeable accidents often befall gentlemen of pleasure An event of this kind is recorded in the fourth print which is now before us Our hero going in full dress to pay his compliments at court on St Da∣vid'sday was accosted in the rude manner which is here represented The  composition  is good The form  of the group made up of the figures in action the chair and the lamplighter is pleasing Only here we have an opportunity of remarking that a group is disgusting when the extremities of it are heavy A group in some respect should resemble a tree The heavier part of the foliage the  cup  as the landskippainter calls it is always near the middle the out∣sidebranches which are relieved by the sky are light and airy An in∣attention to this rule has given a heaviness to the group before us The two bailiffs the woman and the chairman are all huddled together in that part of the group which should have been the lightest while the middle part where the hand holds the door wants strength and  consistence It may be added too that the four heads in the form of a diamond make an unpleasing shape All regular figures should studiously be avoidedThe  light  would have been well distributed if the bailiff holding the arrest and the chairman had been a little lighter and the wo∣man darker The glare of the white apron is disagreeableWe have in this print some beautiful instances of  expression  The surprize and ter∣ror of the poor gentleman is appa∣rent in every limb as far as is con∣sistent with the fear of discomposing his dress The insolence of power in one of the bailiffs and the un∣feeling heart in the other which can jest with misery are strongly marked The selfimportance too of the honest  Cambrian is not illportrayed who is chiefly introduced to settle the chronology of the storyIn point of  grace  we have nothing striking HOGARTH might have introduced a degree of it in the female figure at least he might have contrived to vary the disagreeable and heavy form of her draperyThe  perspective  is good and makes an agreeable shape I cannot leave this print without remarking the  falling banbox  Such representations of quick motion are very absurd and every moment the absurdity grows stronger You can∣not deceive the eye The falling bo∣dy  must  appear  not  to fall Objects of that kind are beyond the power of representation  Difficulties croud so fast upon our hero that at the age of twentyfive which he seems to have attained in the fifth plate we find him driven to the necessity of marrying a woman whom he detests for her fortune The  composition  here is very good and yet we have a disagreeable regu∣larity in the climax of the three fi∣gures the maid the bride and the bridegroomThe  light  is not illdistributed The principal figure too is  graceful  and there is strong  ex∣pression  in the seeming tranquility of his features He hides his contempt of the object before him as well as he can and yet he cannot do it She too has as much meaning as can appear through the deformity of her features The clergyman's face we  are well acquainted with and also his wig tho' we cannot pretend to say where we have seen either The clerk too is an admirable fellow The  perspective  is well understood but the church is too small and the wooden post which seems to have no use divides the picture very dis∣agreeablyThe creed lost the com∣mandments broken and the poor'sbox obstructed by a cobweb are all excellent strokes of satyrical humour  The fortune which our adventurer has just received enables him to make one push more at the gamingtable He is exhibited in the sixth print venting curses on his folly for having lost his last stake This is upon the whole perhaps the best print  of the set The horrid scene it describes was never more inimitably drawn The  composition  is artful and natural If the shape of the whole be not quite pleasing the figures are so well grouped and with so much ease and variety that you cannot take of∣fenceIn point of light it is more culpable There is not shade enough among the figures to balance the glare If the neckcloth and weep∣ers of the gentleman in mourning had been removed and his hands thrown into shade even that alone would have improved the effect The  expression  in almost every figure is admirable and the whole is a strong representation of the human mind in a storm Three stages of that species of madness which at∣attends  gaming are here described On the first shock all is inward dis∣may The ruined gamester is re∣presented leaning against a wall with his arms across lost in an agony of horror Perhaps never pas∣sion was described with so much force In a short time this horrible gloom bursts into a storm of fury he tears in pieces what comes next him and kneeling down invokes curses upon himself He next at∣tacks others every one in his turn whom he imagines to have been in∣strumental in his ruinThe eager joy of the winning gamesters the attention of the usurer the vehe∣mence of the watchman and the profound reverie of the highwayman are all admirably marked There is  great coolness too expressed in the lit∣tle we see of the fat gentleman at the end of the table The figure opposing the madman is bad it has a drunken appearance and drunken∣ness is not the vice of a gamingtableThe principal figure is  ill drawn  The  perspective  is formal and the  execution  but indifferent in heightening his expression HO∣GARTH has lost his spirit  The seventh plate which gives us the view of a jail has very little in it Many of the circumstances which may well be supposed to in∣crease the misery of a confined debt∣or are well contrived but the fruit∣ful genius of HOGARTH I should think might have treated the sub∣ject  in a more copious manner The episode of the fainting woman might have given way to many cir∣cumstances more proper to the occa∣sion This is the same woman whom the rake discards in the first print by whom he is rescued in the fourth who is present at his mar∣riage who follows him into jail and lastly to Bedlam The thought is rather unnatural and the moral certainly culpable The  composition  is bad The group of the woman fainting is a round heavy mass and the other group is very ill shapen The  light  could not be worse ma∣naged and as the groups are con∣trived can hardly be improvedIn the principal figure there is great  expression  and the fainting scene is  well describedA scheme to pay off the national debt by a man who cannot pay his own and the at∣tempt of a silly rake to retrieve his affairs by a work of genius are admirable strokes of humour  The eighth plate brings the fortunes of our hero to a conclusion It is a very expressive representation of the most horrid scene which human nature can exhibit The  composition  is not bad The group in which the lunatic is chained is well managed and if it had been carried a little further towards the middle of the picture and the two women who seem very odly introduced had been removed both the composition and the distri∣bution of light had been good  The  drawing  of the principal fi∣gure is a more accurate piece of ana∣tomy than I should have expect∣ed from HOGARTH The  expres∣sion  of this figure is rather un∣meaning and very inferior to the strong characters of all the other lunatics The fertile genius of the artist has introduced as many of the causes of madness as he could well have collected tho' there is a little tautology There are two religionists and two astronomers Yet there is vari∣ety in each and strong  expres∣sion  in all the characters The selfsatisfaction and conviction of him who has discovered the lon∣gitude the mock majesty of the monarch the moody melancholy  of the lover and the superstitious horror of the popish devotée are all admirableThe  perspective  is simple and proper  CHAPTER V  CAUTIONS IN COLLECTING PRINTS  THE collector of prints may be first cautioned against indulg∣ing a desire to become possessed of  all  the works of any master There are no masters whose works in the  gross  deserve notice No man is equal to himself in all his compositions I have known a collector of REM∣BRANDT ready to give any price for a print or two which he wanted to compleat his collection tho' it had been to REMBRANDT'S credit if those prints had been suppressed There is no doubt but if one third of the works of this master should be tried by the rules of just criticism they would appear of little value The great prince  Eugene  it is said was a collector of this kind and piqued himself upon having in his possession  all the works of all the masters  His col∣lection was bulky and cost fourscore thousand pounds but when sifted could not at that time of day be worth so many hundreds  The collector of prints may se∣condly be cautioned against a super∣stitious veneration for names A true judge leaves the  master  out of the question and only examines the  work  But with a little genius no∣thing sways like a great name It carries a wonderful force covers glaring faults and creates imaginary beauties That species of criticism is certainly just which examines the different manners of different mas∣ters with a view to discover in how many ways a good effect may be pro∣duced and which produces the best But to be curious in finding out a master in order  there  to rest the judgment is a kind of criticism very paultry and illiberal It is judging of the work by the master instead  of judging of the master by the work Hence it is that such vile prints as the  Woman in the cauldron  and  Mount Parnassus  obtain credit among con∣noisseurs If you ask wherein their beauty consists you are informed they are engraved by MARK ANTO∣NIO and if that do not satisfy you you are further assured they are after RAPHAEL This absurd taste raised an honest indignation in that ingenious artist PICART who hav∣ing shewn the world by his excel∣lent imitations how ridiculous it is to pay a blind veneration to  names  tells us that he had compared some of the engravings of the antient mas∣ters with the original pictures and found them very bad copies He speaks of the stiffness which in ge∣neral  runs through them of the hair of children which resembles pothooks and of the ignorance of those engravers in anatomy draw∣ing and the distribution of light  A third caution which may be of use in collecting prints is not to rate their value by their  scarceness  Scarceness will make a  valuable  print  more  valuable but to make scarce∣ness the standard of a prints value is to mistake an accident for merit This folly is founded in vanity and arises from a desire of possessing what no body else can possess The want of  real  merit is made up by  imagina∣ry  and the object is intended to be  kept  not  looked at  Yet absurd as this false taste is nothing is more  common and a trifling genius may be found who will give ten guineas for HOLLAR'S shells which valued according to their real merit the scarcity of them being added to the account are not worth more than as many shil∣lings Instances in abundance might be collected of the prevalence of this folly LE CLERC in his print of  Alexander's Triumph  had given a profile of that prince The print was shewn to the duke of Or∣leans who was pleased with it on the whole but justly enough objec∣ted to the sideface The obsequi∣ous artist erased it and engraved a full one A few impressions had been taken from the plate in its first state which sell among the cu∣rious  for ten times the price of the impressions taken after the face was al∣teredCALLOT once pleased with a little plate of his own etching made an hole in it through which he drew a ribbon and wore it at his button The impressions after the hole was made are very scarce and amazingly valuableVANDYKE etched a print of the holy family in which St John was represented lay∣ing his hand upon the virgin's shoul∣der The print before it was pub∣lished was shewn among his critical friends some of whom thought the action of St John too familiar The painter was convinced and removed the hand But he was mistaken when he thought he added value to his print by the alteration The im∣pressions which got abroad with  the hand upon the shoulder would buy up all the rest three times over in any auction in LondonMany of REMBRANDT'S prints receive in∣finite value from little accidental al∣terations of this kind A few im∣pressions were taken from one plate before a dog was introduced from another before a white horsetail was turned into a black one from a third before a signpost was insert∣ed at an alehouse door and all the scarce prints from these plates tho' altered for the better are the prints of value the rest are common and cheapI shall conclude these in∣stances with a story of a late cele∣brated collector of pictures He was shewing his collection with great sa∣tisfaction and after expatiating up∣on many noble works by GUIDO  MARRATTI and other masters he turned suddenly to the gentleman whom he attended and "Now Sir said he I'll shew you a real curiosi∣ty there is a WOVERMAN without a horse in it"The circumstance it is true was uncommon but was unluckily that very circumstance which made the picture of little value  Let the collector of prints be cau∣tioned fourthly to beware of buy∣ing copies for originals Most of the works of the capital masters have been copied and many of them so well that if a person be not versed in prints he may easily be deceived Were the copies really as good as the originals the name would sig∣nify  nothing but like translations they necessarily fall short of the spi∣rit of the original and contract a stiffness from the fear of erring When seen apart they look well but when compared with the origi∣nals the difference easily appears Thus CALLOT  's beggars  have been so well copied that the difference be∣tween the originals and the copies would not immediately strike you but when you compare them it is obvious There is a plain want of freedom the characters are less strongly marked and the extremi∣ties are less accurately touchedIt is a difficult matter to give rules to as∣sist in distinguishing the copy from the original In most cases the en∣graver's name or his mark which  should be well known will be a suf∣ficient direction These the copyist is seldom hardy enough to forge But in anonymous prints it is matter of more difficulty All that can be done is to attend carefully to the  freedom  of the  manner  in the  ex∣tremities  especially in which the copyist is more liable to fail When you are pretty well acquainted with the  manner  of a master you cannot well be deceived When you are not your best way is to be directed by those who are  The last caution I shall give to the collector of prints is to take care he purchase not bad impressions There are three things which make an impression bad The first is it's  being  ill taken off  Some prints seem to have received the force of the roller at intervals The impressi∣on is double and gives that glimmer∣ing appearance which illudes the eyeA second thing which makes an impression bad is  a worn plate  There is as much difference between the first and the last impression of the same plate as between two different prints The  effect  is wholly lost in a faint impression and you have nothing left but a vapid design without spirit and without force In metzotinto especially a strong impression is desireable For the spirit of a metzotinto quickly eva∣porates without which it is the most insipid of all prints In en∣graving and etching there will be  always here and there a dark touch which long preserves an appearance of spirit but metzotinto is a flat surface and when it begins to wear it wears  all over  Too ma∣ny of the works of all the great masters which are commonly hawk∣ed about at auctions or sold in shops are in this wretched state It is difficult to meet with a good impression The SALVATORS REM∣BRANDTS and WATERLOS which we meet with now except here and there in some choice collection are seldom better than mere reverses You see the form of the print but the elegant and masterly touches are gone backgrounds and foregrounds are jumbled together by the confusion of all distance and you  have rather the shadow of a print left than the print itself The last thing which makes a bad impressi∣on is  retouching a worn plate  Sometimes this is performed by the master himself and then the spirit of the impression may be still preser∣ved But most commonly the re∣touching part is done by some bungler into whose hands the plate has fallen and then it is most exe∣crable In a  worn  plate at least what you have is good you have the remains of something excellent and if you are versed in the works of the master your imagination may be agreeably exercised in making out what is lost But when the plate has gone through the hands of a bungler who has worked it over  with his infamous scratches the idea of the master is lost and you have nothing left but strong harsh and unmeaning lines upon a faint ground which is the most disagree∣able compound with which the eye can be presented Such prints and many such there are though offer∣ed us under the name of REM∣BRANDT or WATERLO are of lit∣tle value Those masters would not have owned such worksYet as we are often obliged to take up with such impressions as we can get let us rather chuse the  faint  impression than the  retouched  one  THE END  ERRATA  Page line read  behind them  Page line read  punishment  Page line read  the work  INDEX  A  Appendages  what  Ananias  cartoon of criticized  Aquafortis  its manner
