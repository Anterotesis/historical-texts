Antennae clavated Wings when at rest erect Fly by day  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Wings indented above purple darker round the Edges with seven distinct white Spots on the first Wings on the second an ir∣regular broad white Stripe and a red Eye Beneath black brown and white  Linn Syst Nat  p P cx  The Papilio Iris is esteemed among the beautiful and placed with the rare of the  English Lepidoptera  The cursory reader may not perceive that superiority particularly as many of the minute Insects infinitely excel in real beauty and richness of colouring but the scien∣tific  will be ever ready to give it the first place as a British Papilio and to those a figure of the Caterpillar and Chrysalis will be an ac∣ceptable acquisition It derives the title of Purple High Flyer as it very rarely descends to the ground except in some few instances it has never been taken but in the most elevated situations and even those instances have been after a strong wind or heavy rain The tops of the loftiest forest trees afford it an asylum and in the Caterpillar and Chrysalis state it is preserved from the wanton cruelty of man by the almost inaccessible height of its habitation They feed on the Sallow  salix caprea  and the Caterpillars are obtained by beating the branches of the tree with a pole twenty or thirty feet in length it is then but a necessary precaution to cover the ground beneath with large sheets to a certain distance or the insects which fall will be lost among the herbage  It is in Caterpillar about  May  and  June  it passes to the Chrysalis state and in  July  or  August  is a Papilio  The great difficulty and trouble to rear the Caterpillars when found and greater difficulty to take the Fly has stamped a valuable consi∣deration on it and particularly so when fine and a high price is but esteemed an adequate compensation for it if in good preservation The male is smaller but more beautiful than the female the upper side of the wings of the female not being enriched with that vivid change of purple which the male possesses in such an eminent degree but the underside of the female is far richer in the various teints of colour than the male they are both beautifully spotted mottled and waved with brown black white and orange The Chrysalis is of a very delicate texture much resembling thin white paper and is tinged in several parts with a very lively purple hue which it borrows from the wings of the enclosed insect and bears the characteristic mark of a Papilio by being suspended from the tail with the head downward  PLATE XXXVIII CIMEX STAGNORUM WATER BUG HEMIPTERA  Shells or upper Wings semicrustaceous not divided by a straight Suture but incumbent on each other Beak curved downward  GENERIC CHARACTER  Cimex  Antennae longer than the Thorax Thorax margined In each Foot three Joints  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Black brown long slender Head one third of its whole length Antennae as long as the Head and very slender Eyes minute pro∣minent Fore Legs shortest length half an inch breadth one third of a line  Linn Syst Nat  Many species of the  Cimex  genus differ so materially in their ge∣neral form that very nice attention is necessary to discriminate the species which evidently belong to this extensive family The external appearance of the House or Scarlet Bug cannot intimate the con∣nection to the same genus with this slender bodied insect but so they are arranged by Linnaeus and so they will appear on a proper inspec∣tion of those parts which constitute their generic character  The present species is common and may be taken during great part of the warm seasons We have an Insect of the same genus  Cimex Lacustris  which has frequently attracted notice by the va∣riety and activity of its motions when sporting on the surface of stagnant pools or other standing water It appears to fly or skim the surface but its wings are not often expanded the lightness of its body  and length of its legs permitting it to dart with great velocity in any direction and when it alights it causes only a gentle tremulous motion beneath it Its habits have much affinity to the generality of aquatic insects and being constantly found on that element would almost determine it to be of that race but it is rather amphibious and very rarely descends beneath the surface It will at intervals rest for several minutes motionless on the water its six legs are then ex∣panded and the tarsi of the feet only touch the surface but the  Cimex Stagnorum  is remarkable for the regularity and carefulness of all its actions it rarely runs but treads the water slow and ever appears to apprehend danger it frequently pauses suddenly and if it then perceives any thing disagreeable retires Aquatic Insects are generally supplied at several parts of their body with an oily matter that the water can∣not penetrate and the legs of this Insect is apparently possessed of that property  PLATE XXXIX COCCINELLA COLEOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae knotted truncated Palpi longer than the Antennae body hemispheric Shells and Thorax bordered In each Foot three Joints  FIG I and FIG IV  SPECIFIC CHARACTER COCCINELLA PUNCTATA  Head black Corslet and Shells yellow The first with five black Spots the latter with twentytwo Length ½ line  FIG II PUNCTATA  Shells orange with fourteen black Spots Head black Thorax black in the Center with an orange Margin and a black Spot on each Side  FIG III PUSTALATA  Head Thorax and Shells black with three red Spots on each Shell Length ½ line  FIG V PUNCTATA LADY COW OR LADY BIRD  Head and Thorax black Shells red with seven black Spots length three or four lines  The history of those several insects so nearly resemble each other that one general account will comprise all that can be said of any of the species The larva is not unlike the adult insect though its body js longer and tapering and it hath no shells to defend it if in danger its security therefore depends on its feet which are rather longer or at least appear longer than in the afterstate all the species whether as the larva or the adult commonly feed on grass but they as frequently are taken on the plantain thistle and rose or any other plant whether wild or cultivated They fasten themselves to the leaves of any plant that is near when they enter the Chrysalis state and its appearance is then as if it were tied to the leaf by threads which pass each other in trans∣verse directions they remain only a few days in the Chrysalis as it undergoes but little change May June and July or later if the weather should prove fine is the time to find them many of the species are so numerous in almost every situation that collectors give little trouble to obtain them or at least search for such only as are most uncommon  PLATE XL PHALAENA ROSEA RED ARCHES LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae taper from the base Wings in general contracted when at rest Fly by night  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Rose colour On the superior Wings a dark waved or arched line and a row of spots near the margin  The Caterpillar of this  Phalaena  feeds on the Oak Our specimen was taken from an oak at Norwood July They are not very common although found during the month of July in several parts near London  FIG I THE LARVA OF THE COCCINELLA PUNCTATA  In Plate XXXIX we have represented several species of the  Cocci∣nella  in their perfect or adult state Our present figure is the larva of the  Punctata  Fig V It is a very common Insect and will feed on almost every kind of vegetable food  PHALAENA PRASINANA SCARCE SILVER LINE LEPIDOPTERA  Phalaena  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Body and under Wings white first Wings green with two oblique arrow lines of pale yellow  We possess two species of the Green Silver Line one Phalaena Prasinana of Linnaeus the second unknown to that author but since described in the  Species Insectorum  of  Fabricius  Those two species nearly resemble each other are both taken from the Oak and are distinguished only in some few particulars the  Scarce Silver Line  has its Superior Wings of a plain peagreen with two stripes of feint yellow the Body and inferior Wings are of an immaculate white But the Common Silver Line is more variegated in its colour having a dash of a paler hue between each Silver Line and an orange or crimson border The Scarce Silver Line is taken in July in woods  Note Fabricius appears to have changed the name of this Insect in his  Spec Ins  for in the  System Ent  m  he calls the common Silver Line Prasinana the same as Linnaeus does which in the  Spec  he has altered to  Fagana  PLATE XL  FIG I VORTICELLA POLYMORPHA  GENERIC CHARACTER  A Worm capable of contracting or extending itself naked with rotatory cilia  Manyshaped Vorticella green opaque  It is impossible to describe the various forms those little Insects can assume and from the microscope it is both doubtful and difficult to give a correct figure of it as the activity of its motions and changes frequently misplace it from the verge of the focus It is scarcely per∣ceptible to the naked eye and is generally of a green colour  FIG II VORTICELLA ROTATORIA  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Cylindrical Vorticella with a little foot projecting from the neck a long tail furnished with four points  Of all the species of minute Insects this Vorticella seems to have engaged the attention of the curious most Baker has described  it under the title of  the Wheel Animalculum  and hence it is well known It is found in gutters or leaden pipes in the summer This Insect possesses one property by no means common to larger animals or even known of many of the minuter kinds it lives in the water but may be kept dry for months and when again it is immerged in that element it will regain its life and motion in half an hour  FIG III TRICHODA LYNCEUS  GENERIC CHARACTER  An invisible pellucid hairy Worm  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Nearly square with a crooked beak The mouth hairy  FIG IV KERONA PATELLA  GENERIC CHARACTER  An invisible Worm with horns  With one valve orbicular chrystalline the forepart notched the body lies in the middle of the shell above and below are hairs or  orns of different lengths jutting out beyond the shell and acting instead of feet and oars  Müller's Ani Infus  PLATE XLII  FIG I ICHNEUMON RAMIDULUS HYMENOPTERA  Wings four generally membraneous Tail of the females

and extremity of the abdomen black Abdomen curved and compressed  FIG II ICHNEUMON RAPTORIUS  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Head thorax and extremity of the abdomen black center spot of yellow on the thorax and two first divisions of the abdomen bright roange Legs black and brown  Ichneumons are the most voracious of all the winged Insectsin their nature robust and powerful and armed with a formidable sting they are the dread and destroyer of other tribes and mortal enemies to each other like the animal  The Ichneumon is a well known animal in Egypt particularly near the river Nile and are useful for destroying the Eggs of the Crocodile c  whence their significant appellation is derived they exist by rapine and plunder and support their infant offspring on the vitals of larger Insects  The female Ichneumon when ready to lay her eggs is seen eagerly rushing from one plant to another if its prey offers which is generally the Larva of the  Phalaena Papilio  c it darts down with the fero∣city of an eagle and grasps the tender body in its claws it is now in vain that the unwieldy animal attempts resistance as all its efforts are but the sport of a savage conqueror For raising the body almost upright or into the form of a bow the creature returns it in an in∣stant and dashes the sting up to the base in the softest part of the ca∣terpillar's body this if undisturbed it will repeat thirty or forty times always choosing a fresh spot for every new wound and often entirely scarifying the Insect The stung animal refuses to eat and sometimes its illness terminates in its death though generally the eggs are ma∣tured and the Insects produced from the living body so that if it survives its misery and the wounds heal the heat of the body ripens the embryos and the young Ichneumons gnaw and tear large passages through the body to complete their delivery July and August are the Months those species we have described are on the wing  PLATE XLIII PAPILIO HYALE SAFFRON BUTTERFLY LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae clavated Wings when at rest erect Diurnal  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Wings entire rounded deep yellowish orange On the superior wings a black and on the inferior wings an orange spot in the center and a deep irregular border of black on the margin Antennae and legs yellow Breadth two inches  Syst Ent    Linn Syst Nat    Fn Sv    The  Papilio Hyale  has been described by several authors English and Foreign and the natural historians of Germany have generally no∣ticed it Unlike many Insects we have in our country it is found in every part of Europe but in greater abundance in Africa and America  Its breadth in England rarely exceeds two inches but influenced by a warmer climate they arrive at a higher degree of perfection than in those northern countries at least they are commonly taken much larger With us it has ever been esteemed as a rare Insect though seen this season in Kent in greater plenty than for several years but as they were probably only an accidental brood they may again disap∣pear for a considerable time The Fly is to be taken in autumn but seldom after August  Our Figure is of the malethe female has several irregular yel∣low spots on the black borders  MELOE PROSCARABEUS COLEOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER  Antennae globular the last globule oval Thorax roundish Shells soft Head gibbous and bent downwards  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Blue black No wings Shells short Abdomen long Antennae thickest in the middle Head broad Thorax narrower than the head and without margin Length ¼ inch  Syst Ent    Linn Syst Nat    Fn Sv    It is by no means for the beauty but singularity of this creature that we have given it a place in our present selection If it is too perfect for the larva of an Insect it certainly appears too imperfect for the adult state it has shells but cannot fly and their length compared with the proportion of the body contributes much to its awkward ap∣pearance It is very quicksighted and runs with swiftness when in danger After death the body is considerably contracted and the native brilliancy of colour it possessed while living immediately va∣nishes When touched a brown liquor oozes from the sides  We have several species of the Meloe differing in size colour and proportion the  Meloe Proscarabeus  is the most common at least near London It feeds under the surface of the ground on the tender fibrils of plants and prefers the light earth of the flowergarden for its devastation May be taken in May or June  PLATE XLIV THE LARVA OF THE LIBELLULA DEPRESSA  In Plate of this work we have represented the LIBELLULA DEPRESSA in the winged state and our present Figure is of the Larva of that Insect We have before described it as a savage vora∣cious creature in every state of its existence The Larva which is an aquatic feeds on Insects of that element and when it becomes adult Moths Butterflies and other winged Insects are its prey As Lepidopterous Insects are not provided with any weapons defensive or offensive it will encounter the largest grasp them in its claws and tear them to pieces Its mouth is spacious and well adapted for that purpose  The Larvae of most winged Insects pass to the Aurelia or Chrysalis state and thence produce the Fly but the Larvae of the  Libellulae  never undergoes that change and though its appearance is altered several times in its progress to perfection it does not become dormant When the ultimate period of its last change arrives it crawls to the bank or side of the ditch and affixing its legs firmly to the ground or grass it collects all its strength and by one violent effort the fu∣ture between the Thorax and Abdomen is broken whence the Head and Thorax is protruded after some pause the exuvia is cast off and the Wings which were before enwrapped in the short cases at the bottom of the Thorax expand The creature now entirely formed for flight only waits a short time to exhale the superfluous moisture and then rushes into the air to spread havoc and disorder  PLATE XLV PHALAENA JACOBAEAE CINNABAR MOTH LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER PHALAENA  Spiral Trunk Back smooth without Crest  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Antennae and body black First Wings dark

are found on such plants as grow in ditches or fenny situationsThe Sisymbrium Nasturtium  Water Cress  is its common food but it will devour with avidity most aquatic vegetables particularly the  Festuca Fluitans Floating Fescue Grass  It is esteemed one of the rarest Species of Phalaenae we have in this country its elegant form and rich colouring determines it also one of the most beautiful Near  London it has been sought with most success in the Battersea Fields or on those banks which abound with aquatic plants between Battersea and Richmond the marshes in the vicinity of Deptford and Rother∣hithe have been yet more productive we do not  owever understand that any have been taken this season about the metropolis  The very singular manner in which this Caterpillar constructs its web deserves particular notice previous to its transformation from the  Larva  to the  Aurelia  it quits the tender plants which afford nou∣rishment and retires to those better calculated for its protection in its defenceless state its choice is generally the Scirpus Lacustris  Bull Rush  or the stoutest plant that is near if its leaves are rushy and strong Its first process is to make a deep incision across the leaf which it effects with little labour as its mouth is well armed for the purpose the upper part of the leaf being thus deprived of its support instantly becomes dependent the Caterpillar embraces the two sur∣faces of the fractured leaf and weaves its web between The web is of an exquisite texture and whiteness and bears great resemblance to the webs of some spiders that frequent watery places  The Caterpillars are found in June and July the Fly in August  PLATE XLVII  FIG I PROTEUS DIFFLUENS  GENERIC CHARACTER  An invisible very simple pellucid Worm of a variable

Species perfectly harmless and inoffensive yet their singular form and more particularly the extraordinary disproportion of their legs operates frequently to their disadvantage with the ignorant who readily suppose they have to avoid the secreted sting of whatever appears aukward or uncommon  Our smaller Species are infinitely more numerous and many of them are not described being so very minute as to remain unnoticed The  Tipula Plumosa  Plate XXII differs materially in its general appear∣ance from the larger kinds  We rarely find a specimen of the larger kinds of Tipula with the legs complete the loss of one or two of those members do not materially retard the briskness of its motions but it cannot fly after suffering a total amputation though it will then live a considerable time  The Tipula Rivosa being entangled by two of its legs in the snare of a large spider ARANEA DIADEMA at first endeavoured to dis∣engage them by force but this rather added to its calamity and a third leg was attracted by the glutinous matter on the threads the spider approached and the creature accelerated its escape by leaving its legs in the web It is very common to observe the broken limbs of the  Tipulae  in the snares of this species of spider  The Larvae of many Tipulae more especially the very minute sorts are found in standing water but the larger generally feed on the roots of grass and may be found by turning up the light surface of the earth The Tipula Rivosa is taken in May and June the Tipula Crocata in June and July the latter is observed in the flowergarden or orchard

may be observed as to size pro∣portion or colouring of many individual kinds yet the rapaciousness  common to the family is apparent in all Our domestic Spiders are plain in their colours and seldom attain a very extraordinary size the gardens are infested by species somewhat larger and more lively in their marks and teints but if we wish to trace the just gradations of the beauty or size of those detestable creatures the forests abound and will afford the highest gratification to the enquiries of the naturalist We have Spiders purely white or white stained with a lovely green yellow marked with a vivid red purples shaded with the richest hues and the brightest browns bespangled with the utmost elegance and symmetry Yet under those rich adornments which nature has so pro∣fusely bestowed on this complication of beauty and ferocity we dis∣cover inherent qualities which in larger animals would become formidable and though we feel confident of our superiority over the insidious art of such a contemptible creature yet the mind is suscepti∣ble of an inward abhorrence at its touch which neither the expansion of philosophy or ignorance of its disposition will sometimes suppress It is probable that  Thomson  in his description of the Spider felt this sympathy of the human mind  "To heedless flies the window proves  A constant death where gloomily retired  The villain Spider lives cunning and fierce  Mixture abhorr'd Amid a mangled heap  Of carcases in eager watch he sits  O'erlooking all his waving snares around  Near the dire cell the dreadless wanderer oft  Passes as oft the ruffian shews his front  The prey at last ensnar'd he dreadful darts  With rapid glide along the leaning line  And fixing in the wretch his cruel fangs  Strikes backward grimly pleas'd the flutt'ring wing  And shriller found declare extreme distress  And ask the helping hospitable hand"  Early in the spring we find the nests of Spiders in the crevices of old walls trees and other obscure places They are enclosed in webs of a white yellow or grey colour varying according to the  species immediately that the warmth of the sun has hatched them they disperse it being no longer necessary to live in societies which indeed would deprive some of their subsistence  In February we took a nest of minute yellowish eggs which proved to be the infant offspring of the A Diadema they scarcely exceeded the size of a pin's head when hatched and were of a bright yellow colour at first their food was the common house fly but their increase in bulk was so rapid that it was necessary to destroy many to preserve a few we therefore selected four specimens which being fed in separate glasses and on different insects exhibited each a distinct degree of strength and colour One specimen destroyed thirty of the common house fly in a day it then appeared much enlarged and the colours were almost black except the spots of white which sparkled with infinite lustre but being confined a week without a fresh supply its colours were considerably faded another week of abstinence reduced its colours to a pale uniform brown the body was much wasted and the creature became perfectly ravenous It devoured a vast quantity of food and recovered much of its former colours a few hours after  Our largest Spiders are incomparable for their size or venomous qualities to the productions of America or of the eastern countries in Germany they are far superior in size to our specimens but in Surinam they are infinitely surpassed Spiders of those parts being often found with legs as thick as a goosequill and three or four inches in length which with difficulty support a body as large as a pullet's egg Their snares are commonly extended from one branch of a tree to another covering the space of twenty or thirty feet and is suffi∣ciently strong to entangle the largest insects A Seba has figured a Spider of this description as descending from an arm of a tree into the nest of a small species of Humming Bird to suck the blood of the parent and eggs  "The eyes of the Spider are a very beautiful microscopic object viewed either as transparent or opake they have generally eight two on the top of the head that look directly upwards two in the front a little below the foregoing to discover what passes before it and on each side a couple more one whereof points sideways forward the other sideways backward so that it can see almost all around it They are immoveable and seem to be formed of a hard transparent horny sub∣stance The number of eyes is not the same in all the species of the  Spider They have eight legs with six joints thickly beset with hairs and terminating in two crooked moveable claws which have little teeth like a saw at a small distance from these claws but placed higher up is another somewhat like a cock's spur by the assistance of which it adheres to it's webs but the weapon wherewith it seizes and kills its prey is a pair of sharp crooked claws or forceps placed in the forepart of the head They can open or extend these pincers as occasion may require when undisturbed they suffer them to lie one upon another Mr  Lewenhoeck  says that each of these claws has a small aperture or slit through which he supposes a poisonous juice is injected into the wound it makes  "The exuvia of the Spider which may be found in cobwebs be∣ing transparent is an excellent object and the fangs or forceps may be easier separated from it and examined with more exactness than in a living Spider The contexture of the Spider's web and their man∣ner of weaving them have been discovered by the microscope The Spider is supplied with a large quantity of glutinous matter within it's body and five dugs or teats for spinning it into thread This substance when examined accurately will be found twisted into many coils of an agate colour and which from its tenacity may be easily drawn out into threads The five teats are placed near the extremity of its tail from these the aforesaid substance proceeds it adheres to any thing it is pressed against and being drawn out hardens in the air The Spider can contract or dilate at pleasure the orifices through which the threads are drawn The threads unite at a small distance from the body so that those which appear to us so fine and single are notwithstanding composed of five joined together and these are many times doubled when the web is in formation"  The Spider parallels design  Sure as Du Moivre without rule or line  POPE  PLATE L  FIG I  The head and thorax natural size  FIG II  A fragment of the

enlarged from the egg it perforates the stalk and hav∣ing entire possession of the inner channel it feeds on the soft substance which is abundant within Thus it is secured by nature with a de∣fence against many depredators to which all Caterpillars except in∣ternal feeders are exposed  It changes to a Chrysalis within the stalk  A short time before the Insect bursts forth the Chrysalis is pro∣truded through the outer bark precisely in the same manner as the Chrysalis of the  Sp Apiformis  PLATE and is supported by a similar contrivance every segment being serrated or armed with a row of very minute teeth which firmly embrace the substance of the stalk and elevate the Chrysalis in an oblique posture until the last efforts of the Insect completely disengages it from the case  The

WISHING to comprise such information as may recommend our Work to a general Class of Readers we are absolutely compelled to deviate from that uniform path which we at first intended to pursue by introducing the figures of some Moths before we can procure their larva we promise this will rarely occur except with Insects whose larva are unknown and the Author will spare no expence or trouble to attain even those but were he to refuse a place to the many valu∣able specimens recently discovered it would be very displeasing to the greater part of his Subscribers therefore as an invariable obser∣vance of such intention promises only to exclude the most rare of our Insects we cannot always indulge it on this plan in the first Volume we could neither have represented the Phal Batis  Peach Blossom  as the larva has only once been found or the Phal Christernana whose larva is unknown  The Caterpillars of a very small portion of minute Moths are known and many Species in the adult state are so very rare as to have escaped the attention of the most accurate Entymologists Of the number which are ascertained as natives very few are hitherto figured or even described  These are Insects which few Cabinets in Eng∣land possess hence the figures must be very acceptable and their rarity a sufficient apology for their premature introduction  PLATE LVIII  FIG I I PHALAENA PRUNIELLA

and thorax white Abdomen grey  We have copied the name  Pruniella  from that celebrated work of Clerk said to be executed under the immediate inspection of  Linnaeus  himself He has figured it in the th Plate Fig But the great scarcity of that work there not being twelve copies in this country can have contributed in a very small measure to its being generally known which indeed is the fact as it does not appear any writer since that time has figured or even described it Some were perhaps ignorant of its having been figured in Clerk's Plates which however could not have been the case with  Linnaeus  but we cannot find that he has described it or referred to Clerk's figure in any part of his works  though a copy of that book came over with the Linnaean collection into the hands of Dr Smith nor can we trace any description of this moth in the writings of  Fabricius  he also has not quoted the figure We may hence conclude that although the insect is frequent in the months of June and July it is little known except with those who possess collections and even many of that description are perhaps unacquainted with the circumstance of its having been named by Clerk and probably by no other author  Taken at Highgate  FIG II PHALAENA MARGINELLA LEPIDOPTERA  GENERIC CHARACTER PHALAENA TINEA  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  First wings bright pale brown with a broad white margin Second wings

Fabricius which is a native of Germany and altogether different that writer it is well known divided many of the genera of Linnaeus and from their materials constituted an infinitely greater number it was by such divisions he separated the  tineae  into the genera  tineae  and  alu∣citae  removing the  alucitae  The insects distinguished by this title are known by the trivial names  Plumes  or  Fans  their wings being entirely formed of feathers connected only near the base in the manner of a fan  of Linnaeus under the title of  Ptero∣phorus  He therefore uses the specific name  marginella

distinguished by the elegantly little mark at the apex of the upper wings which appears like the feather of a peacock's tail  the serruginous dorsal spot surrounded with a thick black mark although pretty is by no means peculiar to this species being common to several other minute moths the clouded markings of black and buffcolour interspersed with silver give this little animal a beautiful appearance particularly under the microscope The under wings have a similar appearance of a peacock's feather but more obsolete at the apex  We believe this species has never been described before and very rarely taken Our specimen was found in SussexAugust  PLATE LIX  FIG I PHALAENA PAVONANA MAGNIFIED  FIG II PHALAENA PRUNIELLA MAGNIFIED  We cannot select more pleasing objects for microscopical

description annexed to ac∣company the figure of the natural size with a microscopical represen∣tation not to enforce that such addition is indispensibly necessary but when moths like the present offer

brown but where it touches the anterior margin it is darker within this band are nine white spots or points and between the band and exterior margin of the wing on the lower edge is a bright black point there are several other reddish brown points scattered upon the upper wing near the base The inferior wings are of a yellowishwhite with a shade of purple a dark spot on the middle and a pale black broad border with a white fringe  This elegant species of the  Noctua  division of Moths appears to be not only a nondescript but altogether unknown before even to the best practical entymologists That an insect of such magnitude should have been unnoticed by  Linnaeus  or  Fabricius  is not very singular as several nondescripts of a similar and many of an inferior  size are to be seen in almost every cabinet but that the species should have escaped the researches of the most eminent collectors is rather astonishing  We have sought every information which our connection would permit and from the result we scarcely hesitate to pronounce the insect of a nondescript species and our specimen to be perfectly unique at least it is a newlydiscovered acquisition to many scientific entymologists  The original whence the figure has been copied is in the collec∣tion of the author it was taken in a lane leading immediately from the wood at  Tottenham  the last week in June It was dis∣covered in the evening on a blade of grass and from its wet ap∣pearance as well as exquisite preservation it had certainly just emerged from its chrysalis  The Caterpillar may be supposed to be an

dies this difference of the appearance between the living and dead specimen of the same species is not peculiar to this Insect only but is commonly observed of most other kinds The body is large in proportion to the other parts but after death it is so contracted or distorted from its natural shape as to assume the appearance of an incoherent mass the skin so co  rugated as to receive a false light on different parts of the surface and consequently the natural glow of  the colours considerably decreased by the exhalation of that moisture which served to refresh them in the living state  The underside from the greater tenacity of the skin or shelly sub∣stance is less liable to alteration than the upper side it is entirely of a dark but beautiful purple which is changeable in proportion to the convexity of the body to the most brilliant hues the legs are also of a beautiful purple with the appearance of bronze or copper colour intermixed  It does not appear to be frequent

leaves of the currant whitethorn nettle grass c if the former cannot be readily procured  The Caterpillars are black and foxy or hairy but in a less degree than the Caterpillars of Ph Caja Great Tyger Moth which we have figured in the early part of this work  About the latter end of April the Caterpillars have attained their full size and change into chrysalis late in May they appear in the winged state  It is by no means so frequent as the Great Tyger Moth though not very rare but it is infinitely superior for the happy combination of its colours to it or either of the British species of that tribe which are trivially termed Tygers it is already high in the esteem of col∣lectors and were specimens of the kind less common it would be in great request among the English Entomologists

Europe though very scarce and in England it is extremely rare  And it is no less distinguished for the very singular structure and length of its antennae than for its rarity that part which forms one of the most certain characteristics of almost every tribe of Insects constitutes the most prominent character in this  Of its use we are altogether ignorant as the various opinions that have been given by former writers are now obliterated some have supposed that they were the organs of hearing or smell and others have imagined that they were susceptible of the least motion in the ambient fluid in which they move  Geoffroy discovered the organs of hearing in several amphibious animals viz in the toad frog viper some other serpents lizard watersalamander and skate  Memoires Etrangers de l'Acad de Paris  and many of the most eminent ana∣tomists of the present time have discovered by their researches into the animal kingdom those organs in different creatures Profes∣sor Camper in published remarks on the organs of hearing in fishes in the Harlem Transactions  In the Year c  Mr Hunter has described others in the Philosophical Transactions  Vol lxxii  and Dr Monro has de∣scribed and figured great variety of them in his large work on the structure and physiology of fishes  Probably induced by those discoveries professor Fabricius endea∣voured to ascertain the organs of hearing in Insects also and about nine years ago published an account of this interesting discovery in the New Copenhagen Transactions  Vol ii p  with figures of those organs in the crab and lobster he found the external orifice of the organ in these animals to be placed between the long and the short antennae the cochlea c being lodged in the upper part which Linnaeus calls the thorax near the base of the serrated projection at its apex we must therefore conclude that the antennae of Insects are appropriated for some other purposes than those it is at present suspected they answer  The Cerambyx Aedilis Fabricius informs us lives in the trunks of trees its horns are moveable as it can either direct them forward or support them in an erect position and when it sleeps it reclines them along its back it also reclines them when it walks quick or has to pass through a narrow track as the least resistance from any thing in its way would be very liable to injure or break them off  Our specimen was taken in May  LINNAEAN INDEX TO VOL II  COLEOPTERA  Scarabaeus Testudinarius Plate Fig  Conflagratus Plate ib Fig  Quadrimaculatus Plate ib Fig  Silpha Quadripunctata Plate Fig  Thoracica Plate
