THE LORD VISCOUNT NEWARK BARON PIERREPONT OF HOLME PIERREPONT IN THE COUNTY OF NOTTINGHAM L L D  This small Tribute of Respect and Friendship Is offered and  With His Lordship's Permission  Inscribed By the Translater  PREFACE  THOSE who are conversant in the French Drama will readily perceive that the  Captive of Spilburg  is little else than a translation of  Le Souterrain  In adapting it to the English stage endeavours have been used to select the most striking and interesting features of the Original The principal Alteration consists in the Airs which when new Music is to be composed it is seldom of any advantage to translate  Much censure has of late been cast on the negligence of those who write  words  for Musical Compositions That some remissness should creep in upon a laborious task where the utmost diligence  can attain little praise will be no subject of surprize to any one accoustomed to habits of application but that indulgence may fairly be extended to writers of this description may be inferred from the apology made by the great Dryden for himself on this subject In speaking of the difficulties of our language in musical composition he says  it consists too much of monosyllables and those too most commonly clogg'd with consonants for which reason he adds I am often forced to coin new words revive some that are antiquated and botch others as if I had not served out my time in Poetry but was bound 'Prentice to some Doggrel Rhimer who makes songs to tunes and sings them for a livelihood 'Tis true I have not been often put to this drudgery but  where I have the words sufficiently shew that I was then a slave to the composition  which I will never be again  In fact the diligent writer of words to be adapted to Music goes to work with fewer materials than any other with a vocabulary  disfurnished  of at least one third of his language  All close sounds all words ending in mutes all in which many consonants are perceptible to the ear are unfavourable to and some times incompatible with his purpose What embarrassment this restriction produces and how greatly it impedes the efforts of a writer  Experiment  will best ascertain  Unfortunately for this species of writing it is likewise liable to censure from the errors of others as well as of the writer The Music of every successful Dramatic Production is immediately published and words are annexed to it which from the frequent inaccuracy in that point of the Copper Plate Engraver are  very falsely said to be written  by the Author of the Piece But this the judicious observer will easily discriminate  The Translator of the present Drama is as fully aware as the most splenetic critic can be that productions of this kind are of no great importance to the retired reader They are however the food of the Stage and a really comprehensive and candid  mind will not estimate their merits merely by the scale of Literature but will recollect that the Theatre demands action that the best written plays  may  be the most unfit for representation and that without this consideration the most accurate judge of books will be a very inadequate censor of dramatic writings  THE CAPTIVE OF SPILBURG  ACT I  SCENE I  Landskip of mountains covered with snow in the front tall firs or pines and on the side the extremity of an ancient castle from the door of which steps descend to the stage the sky cloudy and the scene dark  Enter  CANZEMAR  and  MOUSIC  DUET  HUSH'D in a stilly silence round  All nature breathless seems to lie  Save where athwart the gloom profound  The flick'ring vapours scare the eye  Can  Coragio Mousicfollowhark  I voices hear  Mou  Owls in the dark  Can  Hush listen some one whispers near  Mou  A bat I felt him brush my ear  Can  Onward

Master take heed  Can  All is ruin'd here and bare  Mou  Master beware  Can  Something touches at my head  Mou  Oh lud we're dead  Canz  Shades of night so fond to cover  Projects of the vent'rous lover  Gently courted now to me  Shades of night propitious be  Mou  If fairies or goblins should catch us  Or devils come hither to fetch us  Mou  Good master beware in the deed of the night  Each  nothing  I meet puts me all in a fright  Can  What's yonder  Mou  Oh comfort a man with a light  Both  Hope like to yonder sparkling light  That cheers the lonely dwelling  Wakes in my heart her visions bright  All anxious fears dispelling  CANZEMAR  and  MOUSIC  go up the steps into the house the clouds clear away and discover the moon at full and reflected in the water  Enter  TACHSTEIN  and  KARGAD  K  How say'st thou Tachstein is not the night piercing cold  T  Aye marry is itWhere is our Captain  K  Studying his occupations yonder  T  What in the alehouse  K  Alehouse or innthe village affords no better Drinking is every where the noblest employment of a soldier for what makes a brave soldier contempt of danger And what inspires contempt of danger Why drinking  T  I do not much value the bravery of a man in his cups  K  Hold thy peace Tachstein thou art ignorant thou abusest speech when thou say'st a man is in his cups forsooth as tho' the wine swallowed the man and not the man the wine Never say a man is in liquor 'tis a foolish phrase he is not in the liquor but the liquor in him Were some men in the liquor they drink God help usthey might be drown'd  T  If the  man  be not drown'd in liquor his  understanding  is  K  Nay how can wine drown the understanding  when it is notorious that wine makes the brain  swim  I say thou art ignorant But come along for we may have perilous service to perform to night  Exit  TACH  and  KARG  SCENE II  Inside of the Castle a great Hall  Enter  CANZEMAR MOUSIC  and  KOURAKIN  with a taper in his hand  Kou With kindness

Kou  Promises every hour to follow the other half  Mou  Pray Sir what may this place be  Kou  It was formerly an old convent but long since deserted There is nothing here now but long galleries huge halls dreadful subterraneous vaults and  Mou  Oh lord what  Kou  You don't mind a ghost or two do you  Mou  Ghosts  Kou  Aye we have them here by dozens I believe I saw one or two here the other night

hired to be but there being no longer any garden I was placed within doors to direct the ceremonies of the house but when no ceremony was observed here I was made Steward to take care of the household furniture but there being little or no furniture I was made Clerk to inspect the accoutns but as there were no accounts to be kept they made me Bailiff to collect the rents but as there were no rents to collect  Mou  What did you do then  Kou  Then I came down to be Doorporter but as no one ever comes to the door  Can  What is your present employment  Kou  Making love I find that makes the time pass rather quicker  Can and Mou  Love in this place  Kou  Just the place for it and to say the truth it is my way in all places  AIR  Kourakin  I've lov'd so many a maiden fair  Of names that so much

heigho  I always was from boy to man  Well pleas'd to toy with any  Now if a lady flap her fan  Whystraight I think on Fanny  Dear Fanny I remember yet  No lass so smart and pretty  But if you offer me a bet  Whythen I think on Betty  With a heigho heigho  Then Betty she is all my theme  So round so plump and jolly  But if I hear a Parrot scream  It makes me think on Polly  Thus happy I while scarce a thing  Can meet me so contrary  That will not make me think and sing  Of Fanny Bess or Mary  With a heigho heigho  Mou  You seem to have a merry heart Pray will you introduce my master to the lord of this castle  Kou  Impossible  Mou  Just to speak with him  Kou  He never speaks to any body he has spoken to me only once since he came here and that is a week ago  Can  Who is he pray  Kou  I

Exit  LIEBSTOFF  Mou  Pray who is that mortal merry gentleman  Kou  That is the upper footman  Mou  A pretty figure for his place and pray is that the livery of the castle  Kou  Why as beauty's no

she was married though in private and bound not to disclose her husband's name and did not you nevertheless consine her for several days in your house till you found you could not prevail on her to be be your mistress  Can  And then did not I carry her back to Prague Sirrah  Mou  Where you set her adrift without knowing whither she was going  Can  Those were terms of her own making to which I acceded on condition of her never revealing to any mortal what had pass'd  Mou  Aye I remember you made her take a terrible solemn oath about it That was a  proof there was no good in what you had done or you would not have been so afraid of owning it  Can  My vanity was mortified at her resistance and suggested to me that method of concealing a folly which now causes the remorse of my life  Mou  Oh does it so then this is the moment for repentance for my part it has quite reformed  me  I'll never speak to a woman again as long as I live Oh lordwhat did I see there something all in white

heart  Eugenia the conflict overpowers me  Exit  KOURAKIN MOOLA CANZEMAR  and  MOUSIC  return on tiptoe  Mou  If that is the longest speech he ever makes I don't wonder you cannot tell us any more about him  Can  Well and where is he going now  Kou  It is believ'd he goes into the apartment of a young woman confined in this castle whom nobody ever saw and who died in consequence of ill treatment from a certain steward  Mou  And what is become of that steward  Kou  He also died about a week ago and that is the reason my master came hither  Mou  alarmed  Does every body die then that comes into the castle  Kou  Generally speaking  Can  Have you never had the curiosity to follow him  Kou  No he makes use of a trifling precaution to prevent me  Mou  What's that  Kou  A brace of loaded pistols which he carries about him to answer impertinent questions  Moo  Come away Where are you going to carry the gentlemen Kourakin  Kou  There is no other hiding place than that little passage under the stair case level with the court yard  Mou  Aye  in  the court yard I suppose  Kou  Why I confess 'tis not much out of it but it will keep you in a dry skin and I will come and fetch

the dungeon  KOROWITZ  listens with great emotion  Oh cheering hope Oh faithful guide  Thou too art gone the captive cried  Then fainting stoop'd to earth and died  Kor  That voice disarms me Shall I then venture to look on her no let me not forget that she refuses to speak the name of him who bore her from my cowardly servants in triumph who detained her thee long weeks and extorted from her as she says an oath never to reveal his name She loves himHell is in that thought she shall speak his name or never more behold the light At midnight her son shall descend with me If that fail I must seek a new guardian of this dungeon I am inclined to trust Kourakin but I must be wary    knocking without    Who presumes to knock    aloud and sternly    who knocks  Kou  'Tis me Sir saving your

 Kor  Well  Kou  Well your honor and so I came to tell you that this hall being the most distant from your apartment we had made choice of it for our little hop that we might not disturb you  Kor  This hall  with agitation  Kou  frightened  Why as your honour knows the castle is not in the best repair all over This room seems the most secure and the best for our hop because they say there are vaults under it Is it true Sir  KOROWITZ  starts    So Sir with your leave it shall be here  KOROWITZ  appears thoughtful and affected during his silence  KOURAKIN  seeing his countenance more mild ventures nearer to him  Won't my master be pleased to honor with his presence the happiest day of Kourakin's life I am sure your honor has a good heart at bottom I know though you seem so stern you do not mean to be illnatured  to any one and if to divert your melancholy you were to take a pretty little wife too such an one as  Kor  with a half stifled voice  a wife  Kou  Such an one as I could recommend your honour might be as happy as I am  Kor  unable to restrain his emotion  Happy oh  Exit hastily  Kou  looking after him with surprize  well said Bear What an incomprehensible animal it is

asleep  Eug  rises  The last threat of Korowitz will be accomplish'dthe accustom'd hour is past and no one opens the dungeon to convey my scanty food  listens  surely those were distant voices  attempts to cross to the place whence she thought the sound came but is too faintlistens again  my exhausted strength prevented me from calling for aidI hear them no more  looks with tenderness at her child  Heaven will not abandon that little innocenthe was not restored to me only to die in my arms  AIR  Dwell gentle sleep on  Iwan's  eyes  That witness not a mother's woes  Nor let him mark my

IWAN  wakes and rises from the couch    Iwan  Do you never see the day light here  Eug  sighs  Never  Iwan  But I don't wish to see it without you you said they sometimes brought you food at these

He faints and no help my son Iwan    she tries to recover him        expresses joy    he clasps my handoh no he is dyingI now feel I am a mother and repent    a flash of light appears amongst the rocks    what glimmering light is that nothing so bright has ever visited these caves    the light of torches is discovered possing near the summit of the Souterain    My child look up they are coming hither to preserve usyou shall not diehere is food  IWAN  lifts up his head but is unable to support himself    all all is over    the lamp goes out    the light extinguished tooKorowitzHelp Helpalas

and surprize at seeing her  During the action above described is sung the following  AIR AND CHORUS  Eng  What sounds are those above around  Increasing niurmurs shake the ground  Chorus  without and at a distance  Eugenia  Eug  Listen Whence that sound  'Twas but the shrill resounding shore  Or haply but the sullen roar  Of hollow wintry wind  Chorus  more distinctly heard  Eugenia  Eng  Listen Iwan hear  Was't not a voice that met my ear  Sweet voice of human kind  'Twas but some houseless bird that flies  Amid the menace of the skies  To seek these caverns drear  'Twas but the lightning

Eugenia lift thy heart to joy  Safety's at hand  Eug  Oh save my boy  she kneels  Oh pow'r supreme my child desend  Oh hear a mother's pray'r  Let him to light to life ascend  Beneath thy guardian

of the ruins as flying from the guard who pursue him and defending himself with his sword against them  Kor  AwayAway tho' guilty her life shall be preserv'd  he leaps down into the cavern and runs to  EUGENIA  who still fainting is now supported  by  CANZEMAR  Heavens what do I see  Can  The innocent victim of thy severity In  me  behold the unhappy cause of thy suspicions  KOROWITZ  turns towards  CANZEMAR  in great rage  The secrecy of thy union may best plead in excuse of my offencethy wife was spotless as the snow of heaven but see she revives  Kor  kneels and clasps  EUCENIA  in his arms  Eugenia look up thou injur'd sufferer  Eug  lifting her eyes and hands towards him  My husband  KOROWITZ  raises  EUGENIA  from the ground while others appear to administer relief to  IWAN  who is afterwards embraced tenderly by his parents  FINAL CHORUS  Hope thy genia ray we feel  Charming ev'ry care to rest  Lo returning pleasures steal  Gently o'er her heaving breast  Loudly now let transport swell  Notes of joy our rapture tell  While the vaulted caves around  Echo back the welcome sound  Eug  Bright those eyes with mercy beam  Once again I clasp my boy  Cease my soul thy se rsul dream  Waken to the voice of joy  Chorus  While the vaulted caves around  Echo back the welcome sound  The curtain falls
