 THE IMPERTINENT OR A Visit to the COURT A SATYR  By an Eminent Hand  LONDON  Printed for JOHN WILEORD behind the  Chapterhouse  near St  Paul  's  THE IMPERTINENT OR A Visit to the COURT  A SATYR  WELL if it be my time to quit the Stage  Adieu to all the Follies of the Age  I die in Charity with Fool and Knave  Secure of Happiness beyond the Grave  I've had my  Purgatory  here betimes  And paid for all my Satires all my Rhymes  The Poet's Hell its Tortures Fiends and Flames  To this were Trifles Toys and empty Names  With foolish  Pride  my Heart was never fir'd  Nor the vain Itch  t'admire  or  be admir'd  I hop'd for no  Commission  from his Grace  I bought no  Benefice  I begg'd no  Place  Had no  newVerses  or  new Suit  to show  Yet went to COURTthe Dev'l wou'd have it so  But as the Fool that in reforming Days  Wou'd go to Mass in jest as Story says  Could not but think to pay his  Fine  was odd  Since 'twas no form'd Design of serving God  Such was my Fate whom Heav'n adjudg'd as  proud  As prone to  Ill  as negligent of  Good  As deep in  Debt  without a thought to pay  As  vain  as  idle  and as  false  as they  Who  live  at  Court  for going once that Way  Scarce was I enter'd when behold there came  A Thing which  Adam  had been pos'd to name  Noah  had refus'd it lodging in his Ark  Where all the Race of  Reptiles  might embark  A verier Monster than on  Africk  's Shore  The Sun e're got or slimy  Nilus  bore  Or  Sloane  or  Woodward  's wondrous Shelves contain  Nay all that lying Travellers can feign  This Thing has  travell'd  speaks each Language too  And knows what's fit for ev'ry State to do  Of whofe best Phrase and courtly Accent join'd  He forms one Tongue exotic and refin'd  Talkers I've learn'd to bear  M  tt  x  I knew  Henley  himself I've heard nay  B  dg  l  too  The Doctor's Wormwood Style the Hash of Tongues  A Pedant makes the Storm of  G  s  n  's Lungs  The whole Artill'ry of the Terms of War  And all those Plagues in one the bawling Bar  These I cou'd bear but not a Rogue so civil  Whose Tongue can complement you to the Devil  A Tongue that can cheat Widows cancel Scores  Make  Scots  speak Treason cozen subtlest Whores  With Royal Favourites in Flatt'ry vie  And  Oldmixon  and  Burnet  both outlie  He spies me out I whisper gracious God  What Sin of mine cou'd merit such a Rod  That all the Shot of Dulness now must be  From this thy Blunderbuss discharg'd on me  Well met he cries and happy sure for each  For I am pleas'd to learn and you to teach  What  Speech  esteem you most"The  King  's said I  But the best  Words  "O Sir the  Dictionary  You miss my aim I mean the most acute  And perfect  Speaker"Onslow  past dispute  But Sir of Writers"  Swift  for closer Style  "And  Ho  y  for a Period of a Mile  Why yes 'tis granted these indeed may pass  Good common Linguists and so  Panurge  was  Nay troth th'  Apostles  tho' perhaps too rough  Had once a pretty Gift of Tongues enough  Yet these were all  poor Gentlemen  I dare  Affirm 'twas  Travel  made them what they were  Thus others Talents having nicely shown  He came by soft Transition to his own  Till I cry'd out You prove yourself so able  Pity you was not Druggerman at  Babel  For had they found a Linguist half so good  I make no question but the  Tow'r  had stood  "Obliging Sir I love you I profess  "But wish you lik'd Retreat a little less  "Spirits like you believe me shou'd be seen  "And like  Ulysses  visit Courts and Men  "So much  alone  to speak plain Truth between us  "You'll die of SpleenExcuse me  Nunquam minus  But as for  Courts  forgive me if I say  No Lessons now are taught the  Spartan  way  Tho' in his Pictures Lust be full display'd  Few are the Converts  Aretine  has made  And tho' the Court show  Vice  exceeding clear  None shou'd by my Advice learn  Virtue  there  At this entranc'd he lifts his Hands and Eyes  Squeaks like a highstretch'd Lutestring and replies  "Oh 'tis the sweetest of all earthly things  "To gaze on Princes and to talk of Kings"  Then happy Man who shows the Tombs said I  He dwells amidst the Royal Family  He ev'ry Day from  King  to  King  can walk  Of all our  Harries  all our  Edwards  talk  And get by speaking Truth of Monarchs dead  What few can of the living  Ease  and  Bread  "Lord Sir a meer  Mechanick  strangely low  "And coarse of Phraseyour  English  all are so  "How elegant your  Frenchman  Mine d'ye mean  I have but one I hope the Fellow's clean  "Oh Sir politely well nay let me dye  "Your only wearing is your  Paduasoy"  Not Sir my onlyI have better still  And this you see is but my Dishabille  Wild to get loose his Patience I provoke  Mistake confound object at all he spoke  But as coarse Iron sharpen'd mangles more  And Itch most hurts when anger'd to a Sore  So when you plague a Fool 'tis still the Curse  You only make the Matter worse and worse  He past it o'er put on an easy Smile  At all my Peevishness and chang'd his Style  He asks What  News  I tell him of new Plays  New Eunuchs Harlequins and Operas  He hears and as a Still with Simples in it  Between each Drop it gives stays half a Minute  Loth to enrich me with too quick Replies  By little and by little drops his Lies  Meer  Houshold Trash  of BirthNights Balls and Shows  More than ten  Holingsheds  or  Halls  or  Stows  When the  Qeen  frown'd or smil'd he knows and what  A subtle Minister may make of that  Who sins with whom who got his Pension  Rug  Or quicken'd a Reversion by a  Drug  Whose Place is  quarter'd out  three Parts in four  And whether to a Bishop or a Whore  Who having lost his Credit pawn'd his Rent  Is therefore fit to have a  Government  Who in the  Secret  deals in Stocks secure  And cheats th'unknowing Widow and the Poor  Who makes a  Trust  or  Charity  a Job  And gets an Ac of Parliament to rob  Why  Turnpikes  rose and why no Cit nor Clown  Can  gratis  see the  Country  or the  Town  Shortly no Lad shall  chuck  or Lady  vole  But some excising Courtier will have Toll  He tells what Strumpet Places sells for Life  What 'Squire his Lands what Citizen his Wife  And last which proves him wiser still than all  What Lady's Face is not a whited Wall  As one of  Woodward  's Patients sick and sore  I puke I nauseateyet he thrusts in more  Shows  Poland  's Int'rests takes the  Primate  's part  And talks  Gazettes  and  PostBoys  o'er by heart  Like a big Wife at sight of loathsome Meat  Ready to cast I yawn I sigh I sweat  Then as a licens'd Spy whom nothing can  Silence or hurt he libels the  Great Man  Swears every  Place entail'd  for Years to come  In  sure Succession  to the Day of Doom  He names the  Price  for ev'ry  Office  paid  And says our  Wars thrive ill  because  delay'd  Nay hints 'tis by Connivance of the Court  That  Spain  robs on and  Dunkirk  's still a Port  Not more Amazement seiz'd on  Circe  's Guests  To see themselves fall endlong into Beasts  Than mine to find a Subject staid and wise  Already half turn'd Traytor by surprize  I felt th'Infection slide from him to me  As in the Pox some give it to get free  And quick to swallow me methought I saw  One of our Giant  Statutes  ope its Jaw  In that nice Moment as another Lye  Stood just atilt the  Minister  came by  Away he flies He bows and bows again  And close as  Umbra  joins the dirty Train  Not  Naos  's self more impudently near  When half his Nose is in his Patron's Ear  I blest my Stars but still afraid to see  All the Court fill'd with stranger things than he  Run out as fast as one that pays his Bail  And dreads more Actions hurries from a Jail  Bear me some God oh quickly bear me hence  To wholesome Solitude the Nurse of Sense  Here Contemplation prunes her ruffled Wings  And the free Soul looks down to pity Kings  Here still Reflection led on sober Thought  Which Fancy colour'd and a Vision wrought  A  Vision  Hermits can to Hell transport  And bring ev'n me to see the Damn'd at Court  Not  Dant√©  dreaming all th'Infernal State  Saw such a Scene of  Envy Sin  and  Hate  Base Fear becomes the Guilty not the Free  Suits Tyrants Plunderers but suits not me  Shall I the Terror of this sinful Town  Care if a livery'd Lord or smile or frown  Who cannot flatter and detest who can  Tremble before a  noble ServingMan  O my fair Mistress  Truth  Shall I quit thee  For huffing braggart puft  Nobility  Thou who since Yesterday hast roll'd o'er all  The busy idle Blockheads of the Ball  Hast thou  O Sun  beheld an emptier sort  Than such as swell this Bladder of a Court  Now pox on those who shew a  A famous Show of the COURT of FRANCE in Waxwork  Court in Wax  It ought to bring all Courtiers on their backs  Such painted Puppets such a varnish'd Race  Of hollow Gewgaws only Dress and Face  Such waxen Noses stately staring things  No wonder some Folks bow and think them  Kings  And now the  British  Youth engaged no more  At  Fig  's or  White  's with  Felons  or a  Whore  Pay their last Duty to the  Court  and come  All fresh and fragrant to the  DrawingRoom  Colours as gay and Odours as divine  As the fair Fields they sold to look so fine  "That's  Velvet  for a  King  " the Flatt'rer swears  'Tis true for ten days hence 'twill be  King Lear  's  Our Court may justly to our Stage give Rules  That helps it both to  Fool'sCoats  and to  Fools  And why not Players strut in Courtiers Cloaths  For these are Actors too as well as those  Wants reach ll States they beg but better dres  And all is  splendid Poverty  at best  Painted for sight and essenc'd for the smell  Like Frigates fraught with Spice and Cochine'l  Sail in the  Ladies  How each Pyrate eyes  So weak a Vessel and so rich a Prize  Topgallant he and she in all her Trim  He boarding her she striking sail to him  "  Chere Comtesse  you have Charms all Hearts to hit"  And "  sweet Sir Fopling  you have so much wit"  Such Wits and Beauties are not prais'd for nought  For both the Beauty and the Wit are  bought  'Twou'd burst ev'n  Heraclitus  with the Spleen  To see those Anticks  Fopling  and  Courtin  The  Presence  seems with things so richly odd  The Mosque of  Mahound  or some queer  Pagod  See them survey their Limbs by  Durer  's Rules  Of all Beaukind the best proportion'd Fools  Adjust their Cloaths and to Confession draw  Each idle Atom or erroneous Straw  What Terrors wou'd distract each conscious Soul  Convicted of that mortal Sin a Hole  Or should one Pound of Powder less bespread  The MonkeyTail that wags behind his Head  Thus finish'd and corrected to a hair  They march to prate their Hour before the Fair  So first to preach a whiteglov'd Chaplain goes  With Band of Lily and with Cheek of Rose  Sweeter than  Sharon  in immaculate trim  Neatness itself impertinent in him  Let but the Ladies smile and they are blest  Prodigious how the Things  Protest Protest  Peace Fools or  Gonson  will for Papists seize you  If once he catch you at your  Jesu Jesu  Nature made ev'ry Fop to plague his Brother  Just as one Beauty mortifies another  But here's the  Captain  that will plague you both  Whose Air cries Arm whofe very Look's an Oath  What tho' his Soul be Bullet Body Buff  Damn him he's honest Sirand that's enuff  He spits foreright his haughty Chest before  Like batt'ring Rams beats open ev'ry Door  And with a Face as red and as awry  As  Herod  's Hangdogs in old Tapestry  Scarecrow to Boys the breeding Woman's curse  Has yet a strange Ambition to  look worse  Confounds the Civil keeps the Rude in awe  Jests like alicens'd Fool commands like Law  Frighted I quit the Room but leave it so  As Men from Jayls to Execution go  For hung with  The Room hung with Tapestry now very antient representing the  Seven Deadly Sins  Deadly Sins  I see the Wall  And lin'd with  Giants  deadlier than 'em all  Each Man an  A Giant famous in divers Romances  Ascapart  of strength to toss  For Quoits both  TempleBar  and  CharingCross  Scar'd at the grizly Forms I sweat I fly  And shake all o'er like a discover'd Spy  Courts  are no match for Wits so weak as mine  Charge them with Heav'n's Artill'ry bold  Divine  From such alone the Great Rebukes endure  Whose  Satyr  's  sacred  and whose Rage  secure  'Tis mine to wash a few slight Stains but theirs  To deluge Sin and drown a Court in Tears  Howe'er what's now  Apocrypha  my Wit  In time to come may pass for  Holy Writ  FINISH
