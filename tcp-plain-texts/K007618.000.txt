 POEMS UPON Various Occasions  Written for the Entertainment OF THE AUTHOR And Printed for the Amusement Of a few FRIENDS Prejudic'd in his Favour  BY WILLIAM SHENSTONE Gent  Spes Fortuna valete  OXFORD  Printed by  Leon Lichfield  near  EastGate    PREFATORY DEDICATION TO  Mrs  _DEdications  Madam  ought in Policy to be addrest to the most powerful and in Justice to the most deserving These I think I have united by applying to You in this Manner who have gain'd the former of these Advantages by means of the latter Accomplishments like Your's give the most absolute Authority of any I mean that over the Judgments as well as Hearts of Mankind  I intended here  Madam  after the Manner of other wellmeaning Dedicators to have given some Sketches of Your Character Not so much from the Ostentation of my Art in describing as of the peculiar Diligence I have used in observing it An indifferent Painter may trace some Features of his Sov'reign's Face whose Loyalty has render'd him accurate in studying the OriginalBesides 'Twere  hard a Lady of Your Perfections shou'd be the only one exempted from the Pleasure of being acquainted with 'em 'Tis true You have a quick Eye and penetrating Judgment in distinguishing both natural and moral Beauties But You must inevitably remain a Stranger to the greatest were it not for the Assistance of those important Utensils a Poet and a LookingGlass  'Twere dangerous indeed You might suffer by any Representation I am capable of But 'twas not Incapacity alone discourag'd me There is something in Your Character vastly disadvantageous to any that attempts it To proclaim You possess'd of every imaginable good Quality wou'd be saying it was Day when the Sun shines in its Meridian As for Your Faults if You have any they indeed are far enough from being liable to the former Exception but the extreme Difficulty I shou'd have found in selecting a few minute ones And some I must have selected if possible as the Shades of my  Piece  together with the small Share of Credit I shou'd have gain'd in the World dishearten'd me Such indeed were my only Objections Unless I may adjoin this that to Strangers your real and genuine Character must have  pass'd for Flattery I say to Strangers for where you are known You must be acknowledg'd incapable of it As the Sun's Brightness can be set off by no Allusion Hence in short I laid aside all thoughts of a Portraiture Those that wou'd love You as You deserve must know You as necessarily as those who know You must consequently love You  As to the Poetry I beg Leave to declare that 'tis the Product of a young Genius little exercis'd in Versification And the Muses you know  Madam  are not like a great many of their Sex that have the most Esteem for those who neglect them tho' they have had sometimes in Appearance  Horace  and  Swift  whom to you I wou'd chuse to mention have attended them whole Mornings at their  Toilette  that they might conduct them into the World in a more agreeable Undress But my Negligences  Madam  are of such a Nature that I must beg you'd impute them to Disuse and Inexperience However by this Confession I may probably put you in Mind of a Lady who having thrum'd over a Spinnet for a considerable Space without the least shew of Harmony took much pains to prove she had never play'd before 'Tis with an  Author much the same as with a Sportsman  Hippolitus  may excuse his Illsuccess to himself and perhaps justly alledge several alleviating Circumstances But in vain may he attempt his vindication to the World That has been so frequently deluded by these Apologies that it has made it a Rule to fix the Fault upon the Marksman  I indeed ever despair'd of affording much entertainment this way to a Lady of your refin'd Taste And I'm positive that Indolence has with me prov'd and always will do more than a Ballance to any  other  Ambition This is my only Encouragement that as one almost insensibly conforms to a taste one very much admires I can't but think these Trifles won't prove absolutely disagreeable to Your's  You'll perhaps find other Names in these Pages than that which includes all that's agreeable and is indeed the most comprehensive word that is I mean your own But as there is some thing mean in an aversion to the Praises of another or a continual Apprehension of being rival'd which I take to be it's original I'm secure of giving You no uneasiness Especially since a Lady of Your Merit may give all others infinitely more than their due without the least Shadow of Danger  I ask Pardon for the Pedantry of Latin Mottoes and Quotations But You may easily dispense with the loss of them whether You consider them merely as a Compliance with custom or as certain scraps of Antiquity to indemnify the Poet with those Critic's who approve only what's ancient As there are some who fix a tutelary Piece of Iron on their Thresholds to elude the Fury of Illdesigning  Spirits  Next to the happiness of being possess'd of Merit is to shew one's Approbation of those who are And this is really no small addition to a Man's Character So that shou'd these Papers appear ever so ridiculous I shall value them on  one  Account And shou'd their Fame prove equal to Mr  Pope  's I shou'd value them on none so much as  that  which is that they enable me to declare openly how much I am  MADAM  Your most Obedient Humble Servant  Pembroke College OXFORD  April  th    POEMS Upon Various OCCASIONS  The Speeches of  SLOTH  and  VIRTUE  Upon the Plan of  Xenophon's Judgment of Hercules  SLOTH  _HITHER dear Boy direct thy wandring Eyes  'Tis here the lovely Vale of  Pleasure  lies  Debate no moreto me thy self resign  Her mossy Caves her Groves and all are mine  For me the Goddess opes her various Pow'r  Springs in a Tree or blossoms in a Flow'r  To please my Ear she breaths celestial Strains  To please my Eye with Lillies strews the Plains  To form my Couch in mossy Beds she grows  To gratify my Smell she blooms a Rose  Oft' in some Nymph the Deity I find  Where in one Form the various Sweets are join'd  Yield but to mea Choir of Nymphs shall rise  And with the blooming Sight regale thy Eyes  Their beauteous Cheeks a fairer Rose shall wear  A brighter Lilly in their Necks appear  Thou on their Breasts thy wearied Head recline  Nor at the Swan's less pleasing Nest repine  Whilst  Philomel  in each soft Voice complains  And gently lulls thee with her dying Strains  Whilst spicy Gums round each fair Bosom glow  And in each Accent myrrhy Odours flow  For thee with softest Art the Dome shall rise  And spiring Turrets glitter thro' the Skies  For thee the Robe shall glow with purple Rays  The Sideboard sparkle and gilt Chariot blaze  In brilliant Mines be other Hands employ'd  So the gay Product be by thine enjoy'd  For thee the Poplar shall her Amber drain  For thee in clouded Beauty spring the Cane  To please thy Taste shall  Gallia  prune the Vine  To swell thy Treasures  India  sink the Mine  For thee each Nations nicer Stores shall grow  And ev'ry Wind some lovely Tribute blow  Learning shall ne'er molest thy tranquil Reign  Nor Science puzzle thy inactive Brain  Sometimes perhaps thy Fancy take her Wing  To grace a Fan or celebrate a Ring  Fix various Dyes to suit each varying Mien  Prescribe where Patches shou'd in Crouds be seen  Or sigh soft Strains along the vocal Grove  And tell the Charms the sweet Effects of Love  Or if more specious Ease thy Care shou'd claim  And thy Breast glow with faint Desire of Fame  Some trivial Science shall thy Thoughts amuse  And Learning's Name a solemn Sound diffuse  To Thee all Nature's shelly Store I'll bring  To thee the Sparklings on the Insect's Wing  Pleasure in infant Forms shalt thou descry  View in an Ant or hear her in a Fly  When near thy Path as oft as Spring appears  The sportive Goddess buzzes round thy Ears  Now in some Pebble's curious Vein is seen  Or on some Leaf bestows unusual Green  Then Sleep shall wrap thee in her downy Arms  And round thy weary'd Head diffuse her Charms  Lest growing Pride thy peaceful Schemes o'erthrow  And Thought succeedmy most destructive Foe  The watry Nymphs shall tune the tinkling Vales  And gentle Zephyrs harmonize their Gales  For thy repose instruct with Rival Joy  Their Streams to murmur and their Winds to sigh  Thus shalt thou spend the sweetly flowing Day  Till lost in Bliss thou breath thy Soul away  How easy a Transition should'st thou find  Were to thy Fate Annihilation join'd  VIRTUE  FLY fly fond Youth the too indulgent Maid  Nor err by such fantastick Scenes betray'd  Tho' in my Path the prickly Thorn be seen  And the waste Turf produce a fainter Green  Tho' no gay Rose or purple Product shine  The rugged Surface still conceals the Mine  And each unsightly Object can supply  More lasting Pleasure more substantial Joy  But shou'd those airy glittr'ing Toys allure  Yet whence cou'd  Sloth  the mighty Boon procure  Or whence receive or how those Gifts bestow  Which I alone possessher greatest Foe  I from old Ocean rob the treasur'd Store  And hidden Gems thro' ev'ry Realm explore  'Twas I the rugged Brilliant first reveal'd  By tenfold Strata in the Earth conceal'd  'Tis I the shapeless Surface still refine  And teach the rugged Brilliant how to shine  Where blooms the Rose where spires the shapely Tree  Where smiles the Grape without fair Industry  But grant we  Sloth  the Scene herself has drawn  The mossy Grotto and the flow'ry Lawn  Let Frankincense with ev'ry Wind exhale  And  Philomela  breath in ev'ry Gale  Let Brilliants sparkle dear Machines of Pride  And from the Poplar flow the Amber Tide  Let gay  Pomona  quitting all around  For choicest Fruits select the hallow'd Ground  To tread the favour'd Soil shou'd  Virtue  cease  Nor mossy Grotts nor flow'ry Lawns cou'd please  Nor ought  Pomona  's luscious Gifts avail  The Sound harmonious or the spicy Gale  See'st thou those Rocks in dreadful Pomp arise  And barren Cliffs that sweep the vaulted Skies  Those Fields whence  Phoebus  all their Moisture drains  And too profusely kind disrobes the Plains  When I vouchsafe to tread the lonely Soil  Those Rocks seem lovely and those Desarts smile  Oft' on those pathless Wilds as I appear  With Converse sweet his lonely Steps to chear  Those Cliffs the Exile has with Pleasure view'd  And call'd that Desart "Blissful Solitude  Known by its airy Height and tow'ring Spires  Behind that Scene  Fame's  lofty Dome retires  Steep the Ascent by which to Fame we rise  Yet equal to the Labour is the Prize  From thence you gain an earthly Crown from thenceyou reach the Skies  Far far below the downy Throne is seen  That lulls to Rest  Ignavia's  softer Queen  Thence to Fame's Turrets oft' She lifts her Eyes  Desirous still still impotent to rise  Oft' when resolv'd to gain those shining Tow'rs  The pensive Queen the dire Ascent explores  Comes onward wafted by the gummy Trees  Some Sylvan Musick or some scented Breeze  She turns her Head her own gay Realm she spies  And all the airy Resolution dies  Thus still in vain these gilded Visions please  The Wretch of Glory whilst the Slave of Ease  Doom'd ever in ignoble State to pine  Boast her own Scenes and languish after mine  LOVE and MUSICK  SHall  Love  alone for ever claim  An universal Right to Fame  An undisputed Sway  Or has not  Musick  equal Charms  To fill the Breast with strange Alarms  And make the World obey  The  Thracian  Bard as Poets tell  Cou'd mitigate the Pow'rs of Hell  Ev'n  Pluto  's nicer Ear  His Arts no more than  Love's  we find  To Deities or Men confin'd  Drew Brutes in Crouds to hear  Whatever fav'rite Passion reign'd  The Poet still his Right maintain'd  O'er all that rang'd the Plain  The siercer Tyrants cou'd asswage  Or fire the tim'rous into Rage  Whene'er he chang'd the Strain  In milder Lays the Bard began  Soft Notes thro' every Finger ran  And echoing charm'd the place  See fawning Lions gaze around  And taught to quit their savage Sound  Assume a gentler Grace  When  Cymon  view'd the fair One's Charms  Her ruby Lips and snowy Arms  And told her Beauties o'er  When  Love  reform'd his awkard Tone  And made each clownish Gesture known  It shew'd but equal Pow'r  The Bard now tries a sprightlier sound  When all the feather'd Race around  Perceive the vary'd Strains  The soaring Lark the Note pursues  The tim'rous Dove around him cooes  And  Philomel  complains  An equal Pow'r of  Love  I've seen  Incite the Deer to scour the Green  And chace his  barking  Foe  Sometimes has  Love  with greater might  To challengenaysometimesto fight  Provok'd th' enamour'd Beau  When  Silvia  treads the smiling Plain  How glows the Heart of ev'ry Swain  By pleasing Tumults tost  When  Handel  's solemn Accents roll  Each Breast is fir'd each raptur'd Soul  In sweet Confusion lost  If she her melting Glances dart  Or he his dying Airs impart  Our Spirits sink away  Enough enough dear Nymph give o'er  And thou great Artist urge no more  Thy unresisted Sway  Thus Love or Sound affects the Mind  But when their various Pow'rs are join'd  Fly daring Mortal fly  For when  Selinda's  Charms appear  And I her tuneful Accents hear  I burn I faint I die  COLEMIRA  A  Culinary  ECLOGUE  Nec tantum Veners quantum studiosa culinae  NIght's sable Clouds had half the Globe o'erspread  And Silence reign'd and Folks were gone to Bed  When Love which gentle Sleep can ne'er inspire  Had seated  Damon  by the Kitchen Fire  Pensive he lay extended on the Ground  The little  Lares  kept their Vigils round  The fawning Cats compassionate his case  And purr around and gently lick his Face  To all his 'plaints the sleeping Curs reply  And with hoarse Snorings imitate a Sigh  Such gloomy Scenes with Lover's Minds agree  And Solitude to them is best Society  Cou'd I he cry'd express how bright a grace  Adorns thy morning Hands and wellwash'd Face  Thou wou'dst  Colemira  grant what I implore  And yield me love or wash thy face no more  Ah who can see and seeing not admire  Whene'er she sets the Pot upon the Fire  Her Hands outshine the Fire and redder things  Her Eyes are blacker than the Pot she brings  But sure no Chamberdamsel can compare  When in meridian Lustre shines my Fair  When warm'd with Dinner's toil in pearly rills  Adown her goodly Cheek the Sweat distills  Oh how I long how ardently desire  To view those rosy Fingers strike the Lyre  For late when Bees to change their Climes began  How did I see 'em thrum the Fryingpan  With her I shou'd not envy  G  his Queen  Tho' She in royal Grandeur deck'd be seen  Whilst Rags just sever'd from my Fairone's Gown  In russet Pomp and greasy Pride hang down  Ah how it does my drooping Heart rejoice  When in the Hall I hear thy mellow Voice  How wou'd that Voice exceed the VillageBell  Wou'dst thou but sing "  I like thee Passing well  "  When from the Hearth she bade the  Pointers  go  How soft how easy did her Accents slow  " Get out she cry'd when Strangers come to Sup  " One ne'er can raise those snoring Devils up"  Then full of wrath she kick'd each lazy Brute  Alas I envy'd even that Salute  'Twas sure misplac'd  Shock  said or seem'd to say  He had as lief I had the kick as they  If she the mystick Bellows take in hand  Who like the Fair can that Machine command  O mayst thou ne'er by  Eolus  be seen  For he wou'd sure demand thee for his Queen  But shou'd the Flame this rougher aid refuse  And only gentler Med'cines be of use  With fullblown Cheeks she ends the doubtful strife  Foments the infant Flame and puffs it into life  Such Arts as these exalt the drooping Fire  But in my Breast a fiercer Flame inspire  I burn I burn O give thy pussing o'er  And swell thy Cheeks and pout thy Lips no more  With all her haughty Looks the time I've seen  When this proud Damsel has more humble been  When with nice Airs she hoist the Pancake round  And dropt it hapless Fair upon the Ground  Look with what charming grace what winning tricks  The artful Charmer rubs the Candlesticks  So bright she makes the Candlesticks she handles  Oft have I saidThere were no need of Candles  But thou my Fair who never wou'dst approve  Or hear the tender Story of my love  Or mind how burns my raging Breasta Button  Perhaps are dreaming ofa Breast of Mutton  Thus said and wept the sad desponding Swain  Revealing to the sable Walls his Pain  But Nymphs are free with those they shou'd deny  To those they love more exquisitely coy  Now chirping Crickets raise their tinkling Voice  The lambent Flames in languid Streams arise  And Smoke in azure Folds evaporates and dies  COMPARISON  'TIS by  Comparison  we know  On ev'ry Object to bestow  Its proper share of Praise  Did each a like Perfection bear  What  Beauty  tho' divinely Fair  Cou'd Admiration raise  Amidst the lucid Bands of Night  See  Hesperus  serenely bright  Adorns the distant Skies  But languishes amidst the blaze  Of sprightly  Sol  's meridian Rays  Or  Silvia's  brighter Eyes  Whene'er the Nightingale complains  I like the melancholy Strains  And praise the tuneful Bird  But vainly might she strain her Throat  Vainly exalt each swelling Note  Shou'd  Silvia's  Voice be heard  When on the Vi'lets purple Bed  Supine I rest my weary Head  The fragrant Pillow charms  Yet soon such languid Bliss I'd fly  Wou'd  Silvia  but the Loss supply  And take me to her Arms  The Alabaster's wond'rous White  The Marble's Polish strikes my Sight  When  Silvia  is not seen  But ah how faint that White is grown  How rough appears the polish'd Stone  Compar'd with  Silvia's  Mien  The Rose that o'er the  Cyprian  Plains  With Flow'rs enamel'd blooming reigns  With undisputed Pow'r  Plac'd near her Cheek's celestial Red  Its Purple lost its Lustre fled  Delights the Sense no more  The SCHOOLMISTRESS  A POEM  In Imitation of  Spencer  's Stile  IN evrich Mart that stands on  British  Ground  In evrich Village less yknown to Fame  Dwells there in Cot uncouth a far renown'd  A Matron old whom we  SchoolMistress  name  Who wont unruly Brats with Birch to tame  They grieven sore in Durance vile ypent  Aw'd by the Pow'r of uncontrouled Dame  And ofttimes on Vagaries idly bent  For Task unconn'd or unkempt Hair are sore yshent  II  Nar to this Dome is found a Patch so green  On which the Tribe their Gambols do display  Als at the Door impris'ning Board is seen  Lest weakly Wights of smaller size shou'd stray  Eager perdie to bask in sunshine Day  The Noises intermix'd which thence resound  Do Learning's little Tenement betray  Where sits the Dame disguis'd in Look profound  And eyes her fairy Throng and turns her Wheel around  III  Right well knew She each Temper to descry  To thwart the proud and the submiss to raise  Some with vile copper Prize exalt on high  And some entice with Pittance small of Praise  And other Sorts with baleful Spriggs affrays  Eke in her Absence She command doth hold  While with quaint Arts the thoughtless Croud she sways  Forewarn'd if little Bird their Tricks behold  'Twill whisper in her Ear and all the Scene unfold  IV  Lo now with State she utters the command  Eftsoons the Urchins to their Tasks repair  Their Books of stature small take they in Hand  Which with pellucid Horn secured are  To save from Finger wet the Letters fair  The Work so quaint that on their Backs is seen  St  George  's high Atchievements does declare  On which thilk Wight that has ygazing been  Kens the forthcoming Rod unpleasing Sight I ween  V  But ah what Pen his woful Plight can trace  Or what Device his loud Laments explain  The Form uncouth of his disguised Face  The pallid Hue that dyes his Looks amain  The plenteous Show'r that does his Check distain  When he in abject wise implores the Dame  Ne hopeth ought of sweet Reprieve to gain  Or when from high she levels well her Aim  And thro' the Thatch his Cries each falling Stroke proclaim  VI  The other Tribe aghast with sore dismay  Attend and conn their Tasks with mickle Care  By turns astony'd evrich Twigg survey  And from their Fellows furrow'd Bum beware  Knowing I wist how each the same may share  Till Fear has taught 'em a performance meet  And to the wellknown Chest the Dame repair  Whence oft with sugar'd Cates she doth 'em greet  And Gingerbread yrare now certes doubly sweet  VII  Now to their Seats they hie with merry glee  And in beseemly order sitten there  All but the Wight of Bum ygalled he  Abhors both Bench and Stool and Form and Chair  This Hand in Mouth yfix'd that rends his Hair  And eke with Snubs profound and heaving Breast  Convulsions intermitting does declare  His grievous Wrongs his Dame's unjust Behest  And scorns her proffer'd Love and shuns to be caress t  VIII  Behind some Door in melancholy Thought  Mindless of Food he dreary Caitiff pines  Ne for his Fellows joyance careth ought  But to the Winds all Merriment resigns  His Face besprent with liquid Chrystal shines  And many a sullen Look askaunce is sent  Which for his Dame's Annoyance he designs  Nathless the more to pleasure him she's bent  The more doth he perverse her 'Haviour past resent  IX  Algates the rest from silk Misfortune free  Stir'n but as Nature doth abroad them call  Then squatten down with Hand beneath each Knee  Ne seeken out or secret Nook or Wall  But cack in open Streetno Shame doth them appall  And may no Carl their Innocence deride  While they p  ss boldly in the face of all  Turning unaw'd their Vestments small aside  Ne covet Hedge ne Barn their privy Parts to hide  X  But when the Hour of Pleasaunce draweth near  They usher forth all debonair and gay  And standing on the Green with jocund Leer  Salute the Stranger passing on his Way  Some builden fragile tenements of Clay  Some to the standing Lake their Courses bend  With Pebbles smooth at  Duck and Drake  to play  Thilk to the Huxter's sav'ry Cot ytend  In pastry  Kings  and  Queens  th' allotted Mite to spend  XI  Here as each Season yields a diffrent store  Each Season's Stores in order ranged been  Apples with Cabbagenet ycover'd o'er  Galling full sore th' unmoney'd Wight are seen  And Gooseb'rie clad in Liv'ry red or green  And here of lovely Dye the Cath'rine Pear  Fine Pear as lovely for thy Juice I ween  O may no Wight e'er pennyless come there  Lest led by thee astray he shameful Theft prepare  XII  See Cherries here e'er Cherries yet abound  With Thread so white in lusheous Bundles ty'd  Scatter like blooming Maid their Glances round  And draw with pamper'd Look our Eyes aside  These must be bought tho' Penury betide  The Plum of purple Hue the Nut so brown  Tempting the passing Swain thilk Cakes beside  Whose muchlov'd Names th' Inventress City own  Rend'ring thro'  Britain's  Isle  Salopia's  Praises known  The QUILL  REnown'd Machine important Trifle  To whom each Art some Tribute owes  Who to the World thy Praise can stifle  Or who without thy Aid disclose  II  How just  Thou  prov'st to injur'd Merit  When Courts neglect it hence we find  Thro'  Thee  does  Pope  Fame's Hill inherit  And circling Bays his Temples bind  III  Yet are the dull as well as brightest  Indebted to  Thy  various Use  When flatter'd Noble's Praise  Thou  writest  Or gayly deck'st  Thy  Parent Goose  IV  When  Peggy  's Cleanly Hand  Thou  gracest  The illplac'd  Web Thy  Presence flies  As  Thou  by  Young  's Direction chacest  The misbecoming Stains of Vice  V  In  Chevychace  so fam'd in Story  Thou  taught'st th' unerring Shafts to fly  When fatal to the  Scotish  Glory  Thy  Down imbib'd the purple Dye  VI  When  Chloe  form'd the Silken Flower  Which by  Thy  aid the Artist drew  And felt the guilty Needle's Power  Such was her lovely Finger's Hue  VII  When hostile Rage and Fury lingers  And Vengeance comes but slowly on  Thou  plac'd between  Machaon  's Fingers  Far Far excell'st both Sword and Gun  VIII  While ev'ry grateful Tongue rehearses  The Monarch's praise each rolling Year  How dext'rous  Thou  in Squibs or  Verses    C  r  or  Blackshoeboy  declare  IX  Unhappy Tooth  Thy  Aid requiring  Thou  can'st from Fragments vile refine  Then from the gen'rous Work retiring  Enjoy'st alone the Silver Shrine  X  Kneller  to distant Times and Places  While  Thou  confin'dst each stragling Hair  Cou'd tell his Art and  Myra  's Graces  How skillful he and she how fair  XI  In  Silvia  's Spinnet everpleasing  Thy  tributary Aid is known  When Poet's Harmony increasing  His Fame  Thou  raisestand  Thy  own  XII  Potent when  Handel  's Touch obeying  Thou  can'st to Heav'n exalt the Mind  Yet more when Charming  Silvia  playing  In her alone an Heav'n we find  Albo  que simillima cygno  AS  Delia  lovely Syren sate  The myrtle Shades among  Regardless of a farther Fate  Than what her killing Eyes create  Philander  beg'd a Song  Too well alas the  artful  knew  He'd not his suit give o'er  And cry'd"by walking in the Dew"  " I'm grown so hoarse""I vow'tis true"  " Dear Swain insist no more"  At length to his renew'd Address  She yields yet vows again  She scarce can draw her Breath much

with all this Art and Care  Be it large as well as fair  Else however neat the Bowl  Ne'er can please the thirsty Soul  Let it if it can be so  Hold more than it  seems  to do  Let it so capacious be  That it  seem  to hold a Sea  Thus may  Bacchus  hence remain  Tyrant of the  lesser Main  Use the Refuse I enjoin  For the Service of the Vine  Let my Boughs support the Tree  In its weakly Insancy  What remains may be of Use  To contain th' unripen'd Juice  Forming Butts and all that may  Profit in the Toping way  Thus may I be lov'd again  By the Care deceiving Train  'Tis my Study Day and

feign  Must I then leave these blissful Walks and Bow'rs  My teeming Fruittrees and my rip'ning Flow'rs  Each verdant Lawn and each delightful Grove  Where I was wont where Gods might chuse to rove  Those Pines and Cedars which luxuriant rise  And each fair Object that first met these Eyes  Yet here I hop'd to watch the  springing  Train  Here sooth my Fate and mitigate my Pain  And here abandon'd Wretch at least to know  A lazy Grief an lndolence of Woe  Ye Flow'rs whose nicer Frame whose subtile Veins  Refuse the Moisture of less fertile Plains  Ye Plants which in no vulgar Soil can rise  Or bear the Impulse of inclement Skies  Who now with glad'ning Streams your Shoots shall raise  Or lead to wanton in the solar Blaze  Who teach your Tints the kindly'st Change to know  And by a just succession doubly glow  To each your Names my early Fancy gave  And strove from Fate your Embryoleaves to save  To you at Ev'n I strict attendance paid  To you in cool of early Dawn I stray'd

Streams distill  The lovely Languor's of the faint  Jonquill  How shall I then thy fragrant Shelter change  O'er dreary Wilds and unknown Scenes to range  How leave this purer Air these Fruits sublime  For the gross Product of a coarser Clime  Where Earth and Air refuse such soft Supplies  Ungrateful Desarts and unfriendly Skies  How shall I part  JUDITH  'S SONG  THen fir'd with Zeal the Warriour

and wellmarshall'd Field  Led by whose Hand a safe Retreat I found  Tho' Nations rag'd tho' Millions storm'd around  From northern Mountains a stupendous Throng  Of conqu'ring Troops proud  Assur  trail'd along  Whence Torrents stop'd forsook their wonted Shore  And bright with Arms our Hills look'd green no more  Inflam'd with Rage with airy Projects vain  He threaten'd Seas of Blood and Hills of Slain  That Flames should ravage where the Sword shou'd spare  Nor Age nor Sex redeem the  Young  or  Fair    The Babe shou'd stain with harmless Blood the Sands  Torn from the Mother's Breastand trembling Hands  Not the soft Maid his harden'd Breast shou'd move  Too sierce for Pity as too rude for Love  Yet cou'd our God his boasted Pow'r disarm  Give manly Fury to a Female Arm  Not sanguine Youth nor tall Gigantick Might  Fell'd the dire Tyrant in a dubious Fight  Throughout his Camp no hostile Fires there flew  No Poison rag'd nor missive Jav'lin flew  'Twas Love's soft Flame and who cou'd Love controul  'Twas Beauty's Darts o'ercame his yielding Soul  'Twas  Judith  's FaceShe left her gloomy Veil  While envious Custom wou'd her Charms conceal  Her sparkling Eyes with Tears familiar grown  She gayly taught an Office long unknown  Chearful She laid her sable Weeds aside  And tho' She shone She shone for  Israel's  Pride  She bade her Robe wave wanton with the Wind  Within the Purple Tyre her Locks confin'd  Enslav'd the Tyrant with the circling Toy  And taught the silken Texture to destroy  Her wellplac'd Gems his fault'ring Soul o'erthrew  Her Charms disarm'd him and her Faulchion slew  The desp'rate Scene of Death her Hands display'd  Lost in Amaze the  Persian  Chiefs survey'd  Chill'd with cold Fear the softer  Mede  beheld  Yet own'd her Courage as her Charms excell'd  From either Camp shrill Clamours pierc'd the Sky  The Shrieks of Sorrow and the Shouts of Joy  Here the gay Sounds of mirthfulBands were known  There the wild Horrours of an Host o'er thrown  Stretch'd on the Plain the slaughter'd Victims lie  Who impious dar'd JEHOVAH's Aid defy  'Twas HE alone their haughty Rage cou'd quell  By HIM the Victors fought the vanquish'd fell  They fought by

liquid Folds away  Yet gentle Mercy to THY People shewn  Endears THY Sway and gilds THY awful Throne  And on the pious Suppliant pleas'd to shine  Protects him fearless midst a Pow'r like THINE  What tho' with Gums our Altars smoke in vain  The Fumes of Incense and the Fat of slain  Tho' Worship's Pomp THOU can'st regardless see  And Earth's rich Fragrance breaths nosweets to THEE  Bliss still succeeds when righteous Hands revere  The Mind untainted and the Heart sincere  Peace to all such but who with impious Arms  Against THY Israel raise unjust Alarms  Shall feel THY Angel with unpitying

 And from  Selinda's  beauteous Face  Call forth celestial Bloom  And cou'd alas destructive prove  A Nymph so form'd to please  So like some newborn  Queen of Love    Amidst her infant Seas  From  Bacchus  sprightly Cups our Thoughts  A careless Pleasure share  Ah why shou'd  Cytherea's  Draughts  Refine the Soul to Care  Yet thence I felt my Pangs renew  My Bloom my Life decay  And like the

Making the most sorrowful Countenance  To  Smile    In his Presence  Always  bestowing more than he was ask'd    Always  imparting before he was desir'd    Not Proceeding in this Manner  Upon every
