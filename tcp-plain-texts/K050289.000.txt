 AN ESSAY UPON Buying  and  Selling OF SPEECHES IN A LETTER To a Worshipfull Justice of the Peace Being also A MEMBER of a certain Worshipfull Society of  SPEECHMAKERS  LONDON  Printed for  J Baker  and  T Warner  in  PaterNosterRow  Price SixPence  AN ESSAY UPON Buying  and  Selling OF SPEECHES  And't please your Worship  _BEING to Write of Matters of State and particularly of some Steps lately taken by the Masters in  State Policy  I could not pass over  your Worship  who of late has so Distinguish'd your self as well by Writings and Speeches as other ways in Matters of the greatest Moment and therefore  I have Directed this  ESSAY  to your Worship beseeching your Protection on to an Author who has thus ventur'd to reprove a little the Pride of the Men of great Talents like your self a Practise which you have made L udable by your great Example when your Worship was pleas'd to Jest with the World a little and gave your self the Trouble of telling other Men their Faults and taking no Care of your own  I shall not presume so much upon  your Worship  as to make your own Character illustrate the Work I am upon however aptly it might suit with the Design there are so many other flagrant Examples before me that I am under no Necessity of runing the risque of your Displeasure perhaps your Worship may see your own Picture in the History as plain as you may desire and have some reason to express your Satisfaction that it is no plainer  Your Worship knows that in the Case of true Satyrs 'tis  Application makes the Ass  and when Men see their Crimes touch'd so sensibly as that it masters their Temper we say  It discovers that they are the Men and that the Coat fits them  But I doubt not your Worship can bear the brief Reflections made here upon a  scandalous Practise without appropriating any Part of it to your self  That I may therefore with the more Life represent the Crime of  Buying  and  Selling SPEECHES  I shall give you the History of  a once famous Person  who knowing how successful the Antients practised that gainful Trade with what secure Measures they persued their Game and how boldly they made their Market of their Interest in Parliament how effectually they Bantered their Soveraign when they found it for their Advantage and how sure they were to be Bought off as soon as they thought fit to OPEN against the Court resolv'd some few Years agoe  for the raising his declining Fortune for the satisfying his unsatiable Ambition  and  for supplying the most unmannaging profuse Inclination  to try the Experiment upon his Prince You will see with what detestable Ingratitude he Set Out with what Insolence and Assurance he Proceeded and with what just Reproach he Miscarry'd  This History  and't please your Worship  or whether it be a History or no will doubtless sufficiently answer the Design for it will fully lay open the base Measures  taken by such Polititians to get into Employment It will also lay before  your Worship  the narrow selfish Ends which many if not most of those who have formerly made popular Speeches in the Councils and Assemblies of Great Men pusht at HOW they aim'd at their private Advantages all the while they made pretences of pleading the Cause of Justice and the Peoples Liberty HOW when they rail'd at the Mismanagments of Men in Place the Design was not so much the detecting the Frauds of others in great Posts in order to have Justice done to the Nation as for the sake of getting themselves put in their Room  It will also shew by the Royal Example of a Wise and truly Great Prince HOW every Government ought to treat such Creatures as these with what just Contempt they should disappoint their Expectations and HOW they should always be above the fear either of their Malice or their Treachery  I doubt not but when  your Worship  shall have read this Story you will join in recommending the scandalous Practise of  Buying  and  Selling  of  Speeches  to every honest Mans Detestation  The Gentleman I speak of was an  Irishman  by Nation a Man of a Liberal Education well Read especially in that excellent SchoolAccomplishment call'd  Classick Learning  He had also a competent Stock of Natural Wit and by keeping good Company and running some Changes of Fortune had gone thro' so much Variety as to know the World  prety well  and the Town  very well  all which had very much fitted him for Conversation His Thoughts were Clear and he had some happy Turns in Expression which gave some Beauty to his Discourse especially if he did not happen to Talk TOO MUCH which however he was a little enclin'd to  With these Accomplishments he set out in the World and it was Observ'd That for some Years before he made himself Popular he was mightily addicted to make Speeches for which he once got a Friendly Reproof and was told  That If he had not a great care of his Modesty he would get the general Character of a TALKING FELLOW the thing which of all Worldly Reproaches a Wise Man is most affaid of and most studious to avoid  His Answer was remarkable it seems to the Gentleman that was so kind  as to give him the Caution  viz I have Courage enough to carry me over all that  The Gentleman only Reply'd  Cousin Cousin you should not call it Courage call it  However for all his or Courage call it as you will he had another more insuperable Obstruction to his Rising in the World For having neither  Vertue  or  Principles  and which was still worse  No Money  to put him forward in the World he found it very Difficult to force his Way thro' or  as I may say  over the Belly of the Misfortunes which generally attend a Narrow Circumstance and tho' he had made himself Agreeable amongst some Men of good Sense and had even got Acquaintance with some above himself yet all this could not effectually assist him to surmount the Fate of his Family or to master that great Difficulty  viz  of seperating between  Wit  and  Poverty  With all his Acquirements he had some Vices which I must touch at that I may make his History compleat but I shall be brief in that ungrateful Part of History With his  Wit  he had  and alas who is without it  an unbridled Passion for his own dear Praiee Impatient to the last degree of the least Reproach  nay tho' it were just and yet this Exorbitance did not at all restrain him from laying himself open every Day to the most just Satyr and exposing himself a thousand ways by the most ungarded Conduct in the World but believing it in his power to establish his Character upon the foot of his extraordinary Merit he thought he had a right to stop the Enquiries of curious Mallice into those Parts of his Fame which were less Shining and that it was a saucy unmannerly thing for any Man to say an ill Word of him however Just or how much Truth soever there might be in the Fact  To carry on this Haughty Humour his first Care was to let the World believe he was a Person of BIRTH as well as Merit and he Carry'd himself most ridiculously High upon that head Indeed this was the weakest Step he could ever have taken because there were some things in his Family which his Fathers being call'd a  Gentleman  could by no means Ballance and besides that as the Poverty of his Fathers Circumstances expos'd his Children to be bred up by the Charity of others so it happen'd that those Relations of his which shew'd that Charity seem'd  to have acquir'd the Capasity by some scandalous Methods  Now tho' Poverty is rather the  Misfortune  than the  Crime  of a Gentleman yet all Men know that when there are Circumstances of those kinds in the Rear of a Man's Family it is not thought the wisest Step that Man can take to place them in the Front of his own History because it gives Envy a handle to Speak detractingly It was this Vanity of his which caus'd an illnatur'd Poet of those Times among other bitter Things to publish this Distich upon him occasioned by his unseasonable Boasting of being a  Gentleman Born  A Gentleman Born and Charity Bred  Much Brass in his Face more than Brains in his Head  But we pass over his  Pride  as a thing too common to Men of Wit Anex't to this he had the most unhappy Spirit of  Profusion  in his Way of Living that a Wise Man could be guilty of and it was the more Scandalous to him because he had no suitable Fund to justify or support it This Humour was come to such an extravagant Hight in him  that even Good Fortune it self could not supply it and this faild not to make him Necessitous even in spight of the Bounty of Princes This  Poverty  was accompany'd with its constant  YoakFellow Debt  which however was grown so natural a Grievance to him that like a riveted Gout which when it is grown familiar to us we take no Physick for nor are allarm'd at so to be Dun'd or Arrested was no breach of his Tranquility nor did he ever load himself with the unnecessary Care of getting out of it thinking that those People he ow'd Money to had more need to be Uneasy and Thoughtful about that main Point  How they should get him out of their Books  than he whose much greater Care was to find Ways and Means to get farther in  But being by these thing reduc'd all most to his Primitive State  viz  Living upon Charity at length a Friend let him into the Secret  viz  That Railing at Princes making Satyrs upon Great Men and long Speeches against the Vices of the Publick Management was the best way that could be thought of for a Man of his Capacity to get a start into the World  That nothing was wanting to a Man of his Capacity but to be known That for an Author to be Popular was to be formidable to Great Men whose Conduct would very seldom bare a History or their Vertues a Character and that therefore if he once could Establish his Fame in this Town as a  Satyr  he would find very quickly that he might sell Silence at a good Price or get enough by one good Speech to make it worth while to hold his Tongue all his Life after  Upon this prospect he set out  he rail'd in Print upon several Occasions very Magnificently but unhappily sunk under two Circumstances He was afraid to own what he Writ and that kept him too much  Jncog  In the World And He strook too low and fell upon Men not able to buy him off  But he soon found his Mistake  and in one flaming half Sheet he made amends for that Modesty and fell upon the Greatest Men in the Kingdom In short he Damn'd all the  WhiteStaffs  in the Nation as Rogues by Employment and threatn'd what Devilish Things he would Discover of them in the Process of his Studies  He had no sooner done this but it was every Mans Business to enquire who this TALKING Fellow was There is seldom much difficulty in seeking those People that desire to be found the Author was of easy access and being found Tasted the first Fruits of the good Advice given him and was let know that one of the greatest  Staffs  in the Nation had a mind to Serve him Immediately we receiv'd a full and true Account  That a Great Man with a WhiteStaff might be very Honest that there was a WhiteStaff in the World who eminently Merited to be esteem'd and whose Character it was  "to be Frugal of the Publick Money and Prodigal of his own"  This was the first Attempt he made according to the Advice given him and having met with Success he was Encouraged afterwards to go on in a more publick Manner In a course of Time he receiv'd some Civilities from another Person bearing a  Staff  and in hopes of more was heard to say  That he had entertain'd indeed some hard Thoughts of that Gentleman but that he found he was possess'd of a Genius Born to Conquer Universal Prejudice and that  he was afterwards resolv'd to Number himself among his Friends  But finding every Man not alike apprehensive of the Power of a sharp Pen and that he knew not how to make himself fear'd there as he expected his good Opinion abated in a little time  In the mean time the Soveraign at that time Reigning influenc'd by the first Person mention'd had heaped accumulated Royal Favours upon this  Irish  Creature But after the Possession of them a reasonable time the Vallue of them seem'd to abate in his Thought tho' the Revenue of them abated nothing in his Pocket for Favours to some Men appear with a different aspect and sink always in their Magnitude after they have been long enjoy'd  It was not for want of Application or of assurance  to Crave  that the Mortal Wight crep't no higher but that Age had its share of Penetration in some Things as it had of Mistakes in others and he was perhaps sooner than he thought was decent observ'd to distinguish his dear self from his attachment to any Interest  or Party and therefore he thought fit very early to show himself to be what it seems he thought it was best to be in all Governments  viz a Malecontent  We must not say  For we must do him Justice  that his Passion for the Character of a  Malecontent  was deriv'd from his ill Nature for we give that Tribute to his Immorality that he was never Cinical or Morose in his Temper But that his Politicks brought him into those Measures founded upon the mistaken Notion of his own Merit which he always had Prudence enough to keep up an Opinion of tho' not Modesty enough to confine it  Upon this Foundation it was that he was not easily brought to acknowledge himself oblig'd all ways pretending to have it in his Power not only to make himself useful but necessary to the Publick so that their employing and supplying him was all ways to be esteem'd as a Testimony not of the Soveraign's Goodwill so much as Good Sence and of their being able to Judge who or who not it was their Interest to be Bountiful to  But the Consequences of this shew'd more plainly the Truth of what is here asserted for no sooner did he find that the Soveraign once dar'd to run the Risque of his Displeasure but he made no difficulty to shew it and that in the most disobliging Way imaginable Insulting the Crown he Serv'd and carrying it in such a Manner as evidently shew'd he doubted not by appearing against them to be bought off at a good Price  But the Soveraign not being in need of his Service or afraid of his Power ventur'd his Indignation and forbore to Purchase what it was well known could not be Retain'd any longer than the Royal Bounty should flow in a manner equal to his unbounded Profusion  During this Dilemma of his Affairs there happen'd a great Revolution in the Government where he liv'd the Crown being Transpos'd by that Providence in whom the Original Right of disposing all Things remains from one Head to another and that Transposition giving a round turn to the Administration even from one Extream almost to another it gave him also a new Rise and put him into a Posture to shew himself again He was Politician  enough to act his part in the first appearance of Things and to look like other Men He had been taught to Cloth himself with such shapes as best might serve his grand Design and to this purpose fail'd not to make all the disobliging Steps which he had taken in the preceeding Reign pass for Merit in the next and happening to have the good Fortune to fall now into the Hands of a Prince of Immense Beneficence that knew how to engage Ingenious Spirits beyond their Power of return and Rewarded in proportion to his own Bounty rather than the Subjects Character he fail'd not to meet with an acceptance as much beyond his Expectations as those Expectations were above his Merit  This set him at the first dash above all his Rivals and would have Establish'd his Fame if it had not to his great Misfortune set him also above himself  But as nothing is more rare than for one Born in a low Station to know how to move in just proportion to a more extended Orb so the Velocity of his Motion in his new Sphere was so unequal  to himself and to what he ought to have been that it cast him immediately back into the same Disorder that he was in before I have hinted just now that the Soveraigns greatness of Spirit caus'd him to measure his Bounty by his own Magnificence rather than by the bare Desert of the Object and this was in him a Test of an extensive Goodness But our  Irish  Man run into the contrary Extream and measuring his own Merit by his Princes Bounty he fell into the most gross and most offensive Absurdity in Nature for as it fill'd him with unsufferable Arrogance by which he became intollerable to his Friends so it push't him upon that most scandalous Folly of clashing with himself fixing a stated Contradiction between the Days of his Humiliation and those of his Exhaltation  Being come this length there wanted nothing to compleat the ruin of his Character and make him perfectly Contemptible but that he should think as formerly he thought  viz  That all Rewards which were not equall to his Extravagance were Extravagantly short of  his Merit and so bring him to Treat his new Benefactor as he had done his former I mean with Ingratitude  Fate that had determin'd this Mushroom the due Punishment of Upstarts fail'd not to bring this to pass also by the following Circumstances with which I shall conclude his History  By the Favour and Bounty of his Prince of which mention is made he was so far recommended to the Subject  Or which if Fame lies not was part of the Case  made Capable to recommend himself that upon an Election of a Parliament he was chosen to sit in the House of Commons for there were new Parliaments frequently call'd in those Days as well as in these He was no sooner entred into the House but even the first Day as Authors relate he began to make Speeches and Flattring Panegyricks Persuing thus the Dictates of his first Instructor most exactly for it seems he was told That in that place was the best Market for GOOD SPEECHES and that he might take it for Granted that to make a long Speech against the Publick Mannagement was the only way  to get a share in it according to Mr  And Marvill  That Parliament Men should rail at the Court  And get a Preferment immediately for't  Upon this Principle the unhappy Polititian took his Measures he had been Treated as I have said so far above his capasity of Deserving that had not most People known his Character and that he would soon let his Soveraign see his Bounty was ill bestow'd he would almost have arriv'd to the Dignity of being Envied But that unbounded Spirit of Profusion which was however a Judgment upon his Ambition soon made way thro' all that his Princes Bounty had bestowed and he grew Necessitous in the midst of a Sufficency for a Lord Three times the Godlike Goodness of his Prince bore with the Infirmity believing it might be the remains of former Misfortunes and with no less than Five Hundred Pounds at a time if History does not mistake Recruited the  Wity Extravagant  But it was all in vain it was a Stream not a Bucket an Ocean not a Stream that must be sufficient to supply the Outlet of his Vanity  and that Wisdom which was as inseperable from his Soveraign's just Character as his Bounty dictated that in charity to the Lunacy of this Mans Temper he must shut up his Expectation within the Bounds of what he had in Possession and that it was the kindest Thing that could be done for him to let him know it was in vain for him to Ask who had already Surfeited  His Soveraign had almost as good have declar'd him a Traitor as told him  That his Account of Merit was Ballanc'd by past Favours  for his  Merit  being exhausted as well as the  Money  it follows of course that Ways and Means were to be found out to supply the Last whether the First were concern'd or no  The Devil who they say is the cunningest Fellow at his Trade in the World finding the Mans Nature Wicked and his Circumstances Favourable fail'd not to take hold of the advantage and presented him with an Opportunity as he fraudulently told him to raise his Fortunes Nor did he long stick at the Motion tho' at the expence of his Vertue  In a Word the Advice  Sathan  administred  was upon the old Foot  Oppose the Court and make your self Necessary then they'l Buy you  Tho' the Face of this Man was as Casehardn'd as the very Mettal it self which we call so yet it is related in his Favour That he started at the first Proposal and told the Devil  It was damn'd Ungrateful  that  he was a Gentleman Born  and  he could not do any Thing so base  he did not add  Get thee behind me Sathan  because there was more Business between them to Treat of but he gave him a very handsome Repulse it must be confess'd  But  Sathan  is not used to be  said nay  The Devil knew his Inside better perhaps than he did himself and Banter'd him upon his Nicety  A Pox o' your Modesty  says old Belzebub  is it any more than you have done by all the Benefactors ever you had in your Life And besides  says the old Prevaricator  have you not the best Plea in the World for it  viz  NECESSITY Prethee  Dick says he  try the other Experiment can you  Starve  You must do one or tother that you know therefore Consider of it  I do not find that History has Recorded the whole Dialogue between them  nor how  the Devil  they made the Bargain But this is Recorded as a certain Truth  That he came into the Proposal  Now to cut short the Story for the best part of it is behind the generous Prince defeated both the Devil and the Traytor for as soon as he saw his Goodness abus'd he was so far from stooping to gratify the Wicked Design and to draw him back by more Gifts as he expected that he contemn'd the Impotence of his Malice withdrew his Favours and Condemn'd the Wretch to  Rail on  He continu'd a while according to Sentence till he was Hiss'd at and Pd upon by all wise Men his Friends asham'd of him and his Enemies above him and that he laid himself below the dignity of  Lampoon  In this condition Heaven in Mercy to him clear'd up his Understanding and he became a mighty Penitent but as it is not in Man to answer for Sincerity and no Man car'd to venture upon one that had been always otherwise till then The compassionate Prince Pardon'd him gave him a Pension for Bread and laid him up as an Invalid  THIS HISTORY  and't please your Worship  I was willing to lay before you that I might have your Worship's Opinion whether it is not worth while to bring it upon the Stage  in Terrorem  to Deter Incendaries from making Speeches against their Masters and against their Principles with a design to get up higher in their Favour tho' they have already been Rewarded in a manner which it was never in their Power to deserve  I doubt not but if your Worship casts your Eye back upon the Histories of those Times for it is many Years since those things were done you will find I have not wrong'd the Memory of the Person and that you will be satisfy'd great part of the Account is true in Fact  Now I most humbly beseech your Worship to give your aid and assistance in crying down this Unchristian Practice in all its parts and let the World know from your Authentick Hand how justly the Vice of  Speechmaking  is abhor'd by all honest Men but observe if you please that I do not condemn  Speechmaking  in general as such for that may be very useful in its place but making Speeches against Principles and against  Benefactors on purpose to appear considerable and to be drawn off again by a frail Argument which I am asham'd to name  I know your Worship abhors these Things and tho' fame lay's it to your Charge that you spake somewhat after this sort lately upon the Subject of  Shewing Mercy  c yet as common Fame is a false Jilt and has long since lost her Reputation I assure your Worship I shall give no credit to her Words in that Case  Besides Sir I cannot entertain a Thought that you who understands what belongs to Humane Mercy so much having wanted it so often in Civil Affairs tho' not in Criminal could open your Mouth  unless Paid for it beyond the ordinary Price  for the shewing Mercy to those who are no ways the proper objects of Mercy either of God or Man  I need not tell you Sir what  I hear  you very nobly insisted upon  viz  How Kings should imitate the King of Kings in that Superiour Attribute of shewing Mercy and how glorious it  was for Princes to come up to that Sublime Pattern But as our  Jacobites  have enlarged upon that Point to an extreme hight  higher to be sure than your Worship ever intended it  I know your Judgment must joyn with the Kings in this That it may be his Majesty's Duty to imitate the Merciful God of Heaven in Forgivness but that we no where find that any King ought to go beyond that Sacred Pattern  For example  our Religion teaches us  That if we confess and forsake we shall find Mercy  our Rubrick says  Spare thou them O God which confess their Faults  But neither does God himself Pardon any but the Penitent neither can any Man but on the highest Presumption so much as Pray for Pardon for himself or any one else but on the Supposition of Repentance and Reformation  Now  and't please your Worship  we have not yet heard of one of these Prisoners or Condemn'd People that confess  their Fault  for your Worship knows there is a vast difference between confessing  the Fact  and confessing  the Fault  and those who would have the King shew Mercy to the first without the last are for having the  King go farther  your Worship knows  than ever God Almighty himself went yet  It is most certain therefore that your Worship was for having the King be Merciful to those who by a Penitent acknowledgment of their Crime as well as of the Fact rendred themself Objects worthy of Compassion for otherwise it is most certain your Worship was for having the King Pardon those who we are sure God himself will not Pardon  All these things I thought for your Worship's Service to Communicat to you that you may make such use thereof for the Conviction of our Mercenary  Speechmakers  of this Age as to your Worship in your great Wisdom shall seem meet  I am Your Worship's most Humble and obedient Servant A D  ADENDA  IT has often been Complain'd of as a Grievance that our Court have formerly by Bribery Pensions Preferment  with other Arts  form'd their Interest among their People But the present Complaint is the reverse of that Practice  viz  The Subjects by a new fashion'd Method of Chagrin Raillery and Discontent forcing their Interest in the Publick  Nothing is more Certain than that for Fifty Years past this has been the growing Practise of the Times It was at first indeed a  State Secret  and esteem'd to be a Secret of great value few understood it and therefore when we found the Polititians clamorous and loud one Week and as silent as Mutes the next we used to be Surpriz'd at it till old Colonel  Birch  in the Days of King  Charles  II broke into it and discover'd the Trick The Case was thus  An Eminent Member had for some  Years made himself known by his leading Interest in the House He was a Man of Sense a Patron of Liberty warm against Favourites had made himself very popular in Parliament by his Zeal against the Popish Plot constantly oppos'd giving Money without redress of Grievances a mighty  Habeaus CorpusMan  an Enemy to  French  Whores  French  Counsellors c And this Warmth continued till the Time that famous Attempt was made in the House call'd  The Bill of Exclusion  But his Friends were strangely surpriz'd when after so long Experience of his Forwardness they found on a sudden he had not one Word to say no not in that popular Cause  of the Excluding a Popish Successor  neither did he meet at the Clubs as usual where those things were ordinarily Concerted It happen'd once that upon a Committee where they were altogether upon that famous Debate an old Member who sat next him press'd him to give his Opinion but he declin'd it and the old Member still urging him  Let him alone  says Col  Birch he has receiv'd HUSHMONEY  The Jest took  the Word became Proverbial  and it grew very Publick but for all that the Court who found their Account in it  continued the Practise  King  Charles  II who lov'd a good Turn of Wit made that Word his  Common Place  for the Occasion and if they found a troublesom Man begin to lead a Party and make warm Speeches c it was the Word presently at Court  he must have some  HushMoney  But as this was a Practise scandalous enough upon the Court and made use of in a Way most particularly mischievous to the Nation so when once it became Publick the Country Gentlemen turn'd the Tables upon the Ministry and made it  a bite upon the Court  For as soon as they found that the Court to cover their Designs and keep the People Easie were very willing to stop the Mouth of every Complainer with  HushMoney  and that to be a  Malecontent  of Note was a certain Step to advance a Man's Interest This  HushMoney  became a Plague upon the Court they turn'd all  Malecontents  on purpose to be Bought off Yet such was the Conduct of that Court so much were they afraid to let their Practises be expos'd and so little were they able to bear a PlainDealer that tho' they knew  they were Imposed upon to the last degree yet they were oblig'd to wink and let it go on having no other way to stop the Clamours of the People but to buy off the Complainer and this grew a dreadful RentCharge upon them at last especially if it be true as some have said that it cost King  Charles  II Four Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year in  HushMoney  to stop the Mouths of  ParliamentMen  But if this was a Satyr upon the  Court  whose business it was to stand still and see their Pockets pickt that they might at the same Time  by the help of those Mercenary Creatures  get an Opportunity to pick the Nations Pocket of three times as much Yet it was much more scandalous upon the People concern'd who by selling themselves to the Government divested themselves of the Power of serving their Country and like a Souldier who in the heat of Action quits his Post making a breach in the Line of Battle at which the Enemy breaks in and destroys the whole Body so these Men made a monstrous Breach in the Constitution at which  Tyrany Arbitrary Government Persecution of Protestants  and at last  a Popish Successor  broke  in to the endangering the  Liberties  and  Religion  of  Great Britain  It cannot but be remember'd very well by many how Merry King  Charles  II used to make himself with those  HushMoneyMen 'Ds Fish  says the King one Day upon seeing the Account for Secret Service  I believe they'l go Halves with me at last  At another Time when an Eminent Member had made a flameing Speech against giving more Money and it was proposed to get him off  Vijs et Modis  as before  Well  said the King  I have heard of Buying and Selling of Places but I never heard of Buying and Selling of SPEECHES before  But the King fell out with 'em at last for after all they had got of the King and after all the King had got of the Nation by them at last the King would Give no more to Them and then they would Give no more to Him upon which they were sent home Curst and Expos'd as they deserv'd of whom the famous  A Marvel  has these two Lines  But thanks to the Wh who made the K Dogged  For Giving no more the Rogues were Prorogued  But let us now bring this down to the present Time that the folly and absurdity of this  Speechmaking  may appear and this indeed is the Reason of reciting the scandalous History of the Days past What can those Gentlemen promise to themselves Or what do they propose Is there a King now Reigning that wants such Mercenaries that fears their Tongues or can stoop to entertain them in His Pay Sure they cannot have such scandalous Notions in their Minds of a Government of which themselves have said so many fine Things before  Let us examine a little the Circumstances of their new  Phaenomena  which have appear'd so lately in a  certain Place  and whence the Original of their Motion may be drawn It is evident they are not  Tories  they are not so either Simply or by Composition neither Naturally or Politically the Air they have put upon their Conduct has so little of Art in it that even the  Torys  themselves say  It has not Disguise enough in it to do their Cause any Service or the  Whigg  Cause any Harm  So that it is perfectly Impotent and serves for no other End but to expose the People that put it on and give  the Hissing Part of the Bystanders an opportunity to Divert themselves  But are they  Whiggs  then Is it possible that  Whiggs  can be found making Speeches for Mercy to Rebells Who never yet were Penitent enough to acknowledge their rising in Arms against King  George  was a Rebellion Who strove to obtain their Pardon by a Party Spirit And make a Faction for Mercy against Prudence Can this be done by a Friend to King  George  and as such It is impossible But if it be True and the Speakers are  Whiggs  they must either have renounced the Name of  Whigg  and be what as  Whiggs  they always esteem'd Scandalous nay Infamous I mean  Jacobits  and Friends to  Jacobites  or it must be from some Private Spirit some Parlt Policy such as selling of Speeches was in former Days getting  HushMoney  and the like  Again Upon what Principle can any Thing that calls it self a  Whigg  or is attach'd to the Interest of King  George  oppose at such a Time as this the passing of a Bill which is the only step to put an entire End to the Spirit of Rebellion among us the only thing that  can entirely extinguish the hopes and expectations of the  Jacobites  by removing that one and only Difficulty upon which alone the expectation of reviving the Interest of Rebellion did depend whether this be the Affair of  Trienneal  Parliaments or any other Thing  Nay tho' there should be some Niceties of Priviledge or any thing else which at another time it would be very rational and commendable to Insist upon yet is it absolutely necessay for a Person to dispence with some Laws which are justly esteem'd the  Bulwark  of our  Liberties  and shall we not dispence with Circumstances Shall we stand upon Niceties and Punctilios to the hazard of the whole Nation Shall we pass over the Great and not abate the Small How strangely Nice must these Men be and how contrary to common Prudence do they Act Do not Men blow up Houses when the Street is on Fire to save the remainder of the Town Is the Dammage to a few a sufficient Argument to prevent it Was ever any Man affraid it should be made a Precedent to blow up other Peoples Houses when there is not the same Necessity or when there was no Fire at all  If a  Tory  had made use of such Arguments against the  Habeas Corpus  Bill or the  Trienneal  c we should not have thought it strange but for  Whiggs  to act thus It must be upon some meaner lower Principle than those  who deserve the Name of Whiggs  always acted from and altho' these Sheets shall not undertake to charge any Modern Gentleman with Speaking upon the foot of Mercenary Expectations either within the House or without it yet as  Buying  and  Selling  of  Speeches  receiving of  HushMoney  c has been Practices recent in our Memory and by which the Soveraign has been abused and the Nation betray'd 'tis hard to avoid the injection of such things to our Thoughts when we are at a loss to find any other probable Reason for the extraordinary Measures of some People whose Actions and Speeches we could always till now account for  What shall we say then to these  Speechmakers  Shall we speak to them as  Whiggs  Why even in that predicament they appear most Ridiculous Let us refer them back to some of their own Speeches when they were in their Senses and let them be judges for themselves  after all they have said of King  George  of his  standing by his Friends doing Justice to his Enemies and fearing no body  let us ask now whether they can ever believe that his Majesty can be capable of any apprehension from the present Grimace they put upon their Conduct And that their Speeches in Opposition to his just Measures can have any other Effect upon the King than to give his Majesty a needfull Knowledge of the Men and a just Contempt of their Designs  Besides their own former Speeches let them Read Sir  Richard Steel  's Letter to the Pope and see there the just Character which he gives not of the Kings Person only but of his Administration Let them look over Mr  Lmer  's Speech upon the Impeachments where he is pleas'd to say  That the Wisdom and Steddiness of his Majesty's Government have retriev'd the Honour and Reputation of his Kingdom  Let these things speak the Absurdity and Folly of those who being at the Bottom Embark't solidly by Principle and Inclination for the Kings Interest can yet be so Mercenary as to put on the Countenance of  Malecontent  upon the base Notions of making themselves  Necessary and this in a Reign too where they ought to know better than to think it can be made to answer so mean a Design  Let those People look into the Conduct of the present Administration and see whether there is any thing done or doing that it is in their Power to expose or that the Ministers are at all in their reach Let them Remember his Majesty gives no  HushMoney  there are no Court Pensions to complain of but what are known and the Court has chosen to let the World know that some Men have been rewarded beyond their Merit rather than to have them think they have had more Rewards than are known  To what end than do Men who have shar'd so much of the Royal Bounty turn their Backs upon their Principles And open their Mouths at their Benefactors Is it that they think by this Method to get more when they are even asham'd to ask upon any other Foundation It cannot be Nothing can be so Base It must certainly be that they are Sensible they have been too well us'd and can no longer in Conscience  deceive a Prince of so much Benignity but like Murderers who are hurry'd by their own Terrors to discover themselves they find themselves necessitated to tell the King he has been mistaken in them  That  they are of the Number of those who no Bounty can bind nor Favour oblige to be Faithful unless they have a continual flux of Supplies sufficient to gratify the necessary Avarice of an unbounded Expence occasion'd by the Practice of all manner of scandalous Vices  That  they are Servants who will never be Paid and would be always Receiving  that  their Services are small and few and that it would be very necessary to let the Nation see they can go on without such Men as these  That  the Market for long Speeches is over and that having now expos'd themselves sufficiently they are grown perfectly Useless either to one side or other and are  at last  arriv'd to that meanest condition a publick Man can ever come to  viz to be neither Valued or Feared  FINIS
