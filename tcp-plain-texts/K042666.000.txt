 THE PRINCIPLES OF BRIDGES CONTAINING THE MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS OF The PROPERTIES of the ARCHES the THICKNESS of the PIERS the FORCE of the WATER against them c  TOGETHER WITH PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS and DIRECTIONS drawn from the whole  By CHA HUTTON MATHEMATICIAN  NEWCASTLE  Printed by T SAINT and sold by J WILKIE in St Paul's Church Yard and H TURPIN in St John's Street London and by KINCAID and CREECH Edinburgh  PREFACE  A Large and elegant bridge forming a way over a broad and rapid river is justly esteemed one of the noblest pieces of mechanism that man is capable of performing And the usefulness of an art which at the same time that it con∣nects distant shores by a way over the deep and rapid waters also allows those waters and their navigation to pass smooth and uninterrupted renders all probable attempts to advance the theory or practice of it highly deserving the encouragement of the public  This little book is offered as an attempt towards the per∣fection of the theory of this art in which the properties di∣mensions proportions and other relations of the various parts of a bridge are strictly demonstrated and clearly illustrated by various examples It is divided into five sections the  st  treats on the projects of bridges containing a regular detail of the various circumstances and considerations that are cog∣nizable in such projects The  d  treats on arches demon∣strating their various properties with the relations between their intrados and extrados and clearly distinguishes the most preferable curves to be used in a bridge the first two or three propositions being instituted after the manner of two or three done by Mr Emerson in his Fluxions and Mechanics The  d  section treats on the piers demonstrating their thick∣ness necessary for supporting any kind of an arch springing at any height and that both when part of the pier is supposed to be immersed in water and when otherwise The  th  de∣monstrates the force of the water against the end or face of the pier considered as of different forms with the best form for dividing the stream c and to it is added a table shewing the several heights of the fall of the water under the arches arising from its velocity and the obstruction of the piers as it was composed by Tho Wright  Esq  of Auckland in the county of Durham who informs me it is part of a word on which he has spent much time and with which he intends to favour the public And the  th  and last section contains a dictionary of the most material terms peculiar to the subject  in which many practical observations and directions are given which could not be so regularly nor properly introduced into the former sections The whole it is presumed containing full directions for constituting and adapting to one another the several essential parts of a bridge so as to make it the strongest and the most convenient both for the passage over and under it that the situation and other circumstances will possibly admit not indeed for the actual methods of disposing the stones making of mortar or the external ornaments c those things I do not descend to but leave to the discretion of the practical architect as being no part of the plan of my un∣dertaking and for the same reason also I have given no views of bridges but only prints of such parts or figures as are ne∣cessary in explaining the elementary parts of the subject  As my profession is not that of an architect very probably I should never have turned my thoughts to this subject so as to address the public upon it had it not been from the occasion of an accident in that part of the country in which I reside viz the fall of Newcastle and other bridges on the river Tyne on the  th  of november    occasioned by a high flood which rose about    feet higher at Newcastle than the usual spring tides doAnd this occasion having furnished me with many opportunities of hearing and seeing very absurd things advanced on the subject in general I thought the demonstrations of the relations of the essential parts of a bridge would not be unac∣ceptable to those architects and others who may be capable of perceiving the force of them and whose ignorance may not have prejudiced them against things which they do not un∣derstand  In the  th  section there is one thing forgotten to be re∣marked viz That in determining the best form of the end of the pier to be a rightlined triangle the water was supposed to strike every part of it with the same velocity had the vari∣ably increased velocity been used the form of the ends would come out a little curved but as the increase of the velocity in the best bridges is very small the difference in them is quite imperceptable  THE PRINCIPLES OF STONE BRIDGES  SECTION I  Of the Projects of Bridges with the Design Estimate c  WHEN a bridge is deemed necessary to be built over a river the first consideration is the place of it or what particular situation will contain a maximum of the advantages over the disadvantages  In agitating this most important question e∣very circumstance certain and probable attend∣ing or likely to attend the bridge should be separately minutely and impartially stated and examined and the advantage or disadvantage of it rated at a value proportioned to it then the difference between the whole advantages and  disadvantages will be the neat value of that particular situation for which the calculation is made And by doing the same for any other situations all their neat values will be found and of consequence the most preferable situation among themOr in a competition between two place if each one's advantage over the other be estimated or valued in every circum∣stance attending them the sums of their advan∣tages will shew whether of them is the better And the same being done for this and a third and so on the best situation of all will be ob∣tained  In this estimation a great number of particu∣lars must be included and nothing omitted that can be found to make a part of the consideration  Among these the situation of the town or place for the convenience of which the bridge is chiefly to be made will naturally produce a particular of the first consequence and a great many others ought to be sacrificed to it If possible the bridge should be placed where there can conveniently be opened and made passages or streets from the ends of it in every direction and especially one as nearly in the direction of the bridge itself as possible tending towards the body of the town without narrows or crooked windings and easily communicating with the chief streets thoroughfares cAnd here  every person in judging of this should divest himself of all partial regards or attachments what∣ever think and determine for the good of the whole only and for posterity as well as the pre∣sent  The banks or declivities towards the river are also of particular concern as they affect the conveniency of the passage to and from the bridge or determine the height of it upon which in a great measure depends the expence  The breadth of the river the navigation upon it and the quantity of water to be passed or the velocity and depth of the stream from also considerations of great moment as they deter∣mine the bridge to be higher or lower longer or shorter However in most cases a wide part of the river ought rather to be chosen than a narrow one especially if it is subject to great tides or floods for the increased velocity of the stream in the narrow part being again aug∣mented by the farther contraction of the breadth by the piers of the bridge will both incommode the navigation through the arches and under∣mine the piers and endanger the whole bridge  The nature of the bed of the river is also of great concern it having a great influence on the expence as upon it and the depth and velocity  of the stream depend the manner of laying the foundations and building the piers  These are the chief and capital articles of con∣sideration and which will branch themselves out into other dependent ones and so lead to the required estimate of the whole  HAVING resolved on the place the next con∣siderations are the form the estimate of the ex∣pence and the manner of execution  With respect to the form strength utility and beauty ought to be regarded and united the chief part of which lies in the arches The form of the arches will depend on their height and span and the height on that of the water the navigation and the adjacent banks They ought to be made so high as that they may easily transmit the water at its greatest height either from tides or floods and their height and figure ought also to be such as will easily allow of a convenient passage of the craft through them This and the disposition of it above so as to ren∣der the passage over it also convenient make up its utilityHaving fixed the heights of the arches their spans are still necessary for de∣termining their figure Their spans will be known by dividing the whole breadth of the river into a convenient number of arches and piers allowing at least the necessary thickness of  the piers out of the whole In fixing on the number of arches take always an odd number and rather take few and large ones than many and smaller if convenient For thus you will have not only fewer foundations and piers to make with fewer arches and centers which will produce great savings in the expence but the arches themselves will also require much less ma∣terials and workmanship and allow of more and better passage for the water and craft through them and will appear at the same time more noble and beautiful especially if constructed in elliptical or in cycloidal forms for the truth of which it may be sufficient to refer to that noble and elegant bridge lately built at Blackfriars London by Mr Mylne And here I can't help remarking that the Gentleman who a few years since in a pamphlet on the Principles of Bridges censured Mr Mylne and Mr Muller concerning elliptic arches has very much exposed himself and absurdly criticises them through his own want of mathematical knowledge which he some∣where in the same pamphlet affects to despise He brings to my mind an expression of I think Mr Henry Fielding somewhere in his works That a person does not speak the worse on a subject for knowing something about it I do not however make this remark through any par∣ticular disrespect for this Gentleman concerning whom I know nothing farther any more than I do about the other two Gentlemen but only to  prevent others from being prejudiced and misled by the authority of his  ipse dixit  If the top of the bridge be a streight horizontal line let the arches be made all of a size if it be a little lower at the ends than the middle the arches must pro∣portionally decrease from the middle towards the ends but if higher at the ends than the middle let them increase towards the ends A choice of the most convenient arches is to be made from the th and th propositions where their several properties c are demonstrated and pointed out Among them the elliptic cycloi∣dal and equilibrial arch in prop will gene∣rally claim the preference both on account of their strength beauty and cheapness or saving in materials and labour Other particulars also concerning them may be seen under the word ARCH in the Dictionary in the last section And as the choice of the arch is of so great moment let no person either through ignorance or indo∣lence prefer a worse arch because it may seem to him easier to construct for he would very ill deserve the name or employment of an Archi∣tect who is incapable of rendering the exact construction of these curves easy and familiar to himself but if by chance a Bridgebuilder should be employed who is incapable of doing that he ought at least to be endowed with such a share of honesty as to procure some person to go through the calculations which he cannot make for himself  Next find what thickness at the keystone or top will be necessary for the arches For which see the word KEYSTONE in the Dictionary in the last section  Having thus obtained all the parts of the arches with the height of the piers the neces∣sary thickness of the piers themselves are next to be computed by prop  This done the chief and material requisites are found the elevation and plans of the design can then be drawn and the calculations of the expence form thence made including the foun∣dations with such ornamental or accidental ap∣pendages as shall be thought fit which I shall leave to the discretion of the Practical Architect as being no part of the plan of my undertaking together with the practical methods of carrying the design into execution I shall however in the Dictionary in the last section not only de∣scribe the terms parts machines c but also speak of their dimensions properties and any thing else material belonging to them and to which therefore I from hence refer for more ex∣plicit information in each particular article as well as to these immediately following proposi∣tions in which the theory of the arches piers c are fully and strictly demonstrated  SECTION II  Of the Arches  PROPOSITION I  LET there be any number of lines  AB BC CD DE  c all in the same vertical plane connected together and moveable about the joints or angles  A B C D E F  the two extreme points  A  and  F  being fixed It is re∣quired to find the proportions of the weights to be laid upon the angles  B C D  c so that the whole may remain in equilibrium  diagram  Solution  FROM the several angles having drawn the lines Bb Cc Dd c perpendicular to the horizon about them as diagonals constitute  parallelograms such that those sides of each two that are upon the same one of the given lines may be equal to each other viz having made one parallelogram mn take Cp = Bn and form the parallelogram pq then take Dr = Cq and make the parallelogram rs and take Et = Ds and form the parallelogram tv and so on Then the said vertical diagonals Bb Cc Dd Ee c of those parallelograms will be propor∣tional to the weights as required  Demonstration  BY the resolution of forces each of the weights or forces Bb Cc Dd c in the diagonals of the parallelograms is equal to and may be re∣solved into two forces expressed by two adjacent sides of the parallelogram viz the force Bb will be resolved into the two forces Bm Bn and in those directions the force Cc into the two forces Cp Cq and in those directions the force Dd into the two forces Dr Ds and in those directions and so on Then since two forces that are equal and in opposite directions do mutually balance each other therefore the several pairs of forces Bn and Cp Cq and Dr Ds and Et c being equal and opposite by the construction do mutually destroy or balance each other and the extreme forces Bm Ev are balanced by the opposite resistances of the sixed points A F Wherefore there is no force  to change the position of any one of the lines and consequently they will all remain in equili∣brium  QED  Corollary  HENCE if one of the weights and the positions of all the lines be given all the other weights may be found  PROPOSITION II  IF any number of lines that are connected to∣gether and moveable about the points of con∣nection be kept in equilibrium by weights laid upon the angles as in the last proposition Then will the weight on any angle  C  be universally as  that is directly as the sine of that angle and reciprocally as the sines of the two parts or angles into which that angle is divided by a line drawn through it perpendicular to the horizon  Demonstration  BY the last proposition the weights are as Bb Cc Dd c when Bn = pC Cq = rD Ds = tE c But since the angle ABb is = the angle  Bbn and the angle BCc = the angle Ccq c as being always the alternate angles made by a line cutting two other parallel lines also the sine of the ∠ ABC = s ∠ Bnb and s ∠ BCD = s ∠ Cqc as being supplements one to ano∣ther by plane trigonometry we shall have Bn= Bb×s∠ABb s∠ABC = Cp= Cc×s∠cCD S∠BCD Cq= Cc×s∠BCc s∠BCD = Dr= Dd×s∠dDE s∠CDE Ds= Dd×s∠CDd s∠CDE = Et= Ee×s∠eEF s∠DEF c  Hence Bb ∶ Cc ∷ s∠ABC s∠ABb ∶ s∠BCD s∠cCD Cc ∶ Dd ∷ s∠BCD s∠BCc ∶ s∠CDE s∠dDE Dd ∶ Ee ∷ s∠CDE s∠CDd ∶ s∠DEF s∠eEF c  Or by dividing the latter terms of the first of these proportions each by s ∠ bBC and then compounding together two of the proportions then three of them c striking out the com∣mon factors and observing that the s ∠ bBC is = s ∠ BBc the s ∠ cCD = s ∠ CDd c we shall have  Bb ∶ Cc ∷ s∠ABC s∠ABb×s∠bBC ∶ s∠BCD s∠BCc×s∠cCD Bb ∶ Dd ∷ s∠ABC s∠ABb×s∠bBC ∶ s∠CDE s∠CDd×s∠dDE Bb ∶ Ee ∷ s∠ABC s∠ABb×s∠bBC ∶ s∠DEF s∠DEe×s∠eEF c  QED  Otherwise  SINCE Cp or Bn ∶ Bm or nb ∷ s ∠ Bbn or s ∠ ABb ∶ s ∠ bBC or s ∠ BCc ∷ s∠BCc ∶ s∠ABb and Cp or qc ∶ Cq or Dr ∷ s ∠ cCq or s ∠ CDd ∶ s ∠ Ccq or s ∠ BCc ∷ s∠BCc ∶ s∠CDd it is clear that Cp is as s∠BCc that is the forces mB pC rD c are reciprocally as the sines of the angles which they make with the vertical line  And since Cc is = Cp×s∠Cpc s∠Ccp = Cp×s∠BCD s∠cCD therefore any force Cc is as s∠BCD s∠cCB×s∠cCD  QED  Corollary  IF DC be produced to h the sine of the ∠ hCB being = to the sine of its supplement BCD the weight or force Cc will be as s∠hCB s∠BCc×∠cCD which three angles toge∣ther make up two right angles  PROPOSITION III  TO find the proportion of the height of the wall above every point of an arch of equilibra∣tion That is if  GHIK  be the top of a wall supported by an arch  ABCD  it is required to find the proportion of the perpendiculars  BH CI  c so that all the parts of the arch may be kept in equilibrium from falling by the weight or pressure of the superincumbent wall  diagram  Solution  THE lines of equilibration in the former pro∣positions being imagined to become indefinitely small they will constitute a curve of equilibra∣tion and the weights will press upon every point of it and will be respectively equal to the per∣pendiculars  BH CI c drawn into their re∣spective breadths supposing them to be indefi∣nitely narrow parallelograms Also the angle hCB will become the angle of contact formed by the tangent and curve whose sine is equal to the angle itself or its measure and the an∣gles cCB and cCD become equal to the angles cCh cCk or equal to the angles ICk ICh whose sines are equal because the angles are supplements to each other These values being substituted in the expression in the co∣rollary to the last proposition we shall have the force Cc or parallelogram Ci as  or as    Now supposing these narrow parallelograms to stand upon indefinitely small equal parts of the arch their breadths will be directly as the s ∠ kCI and inversly as radius hence the pa∣rallelogram IC × s ∠ kCI is as  and consequently the altitude IC as  or as the  CP being perpendicular to CI and the radius all along equal to unity  But the angle of contact kCD is as the cur∣vature of the arch and that again is inversly  as the radius of curvature wherefore IC is as  or as  putting  R  for the radius of curvature to the point C that is the height of the wall above any point is reciprocally as the radius of curvature and cube of the sine of the angle in which the ver∣tical line cuts the curve in that point or reci∣procally as the radius of curvature and directly as the cube of the secant of the curve's inclina∣tion to the horizon  Corollary    HENCE if the form of the arch or nature of the curve ABCD be given the form of the line GHIK bounding the top of the wall or forming the extrados may be found so that ABCD shall be an arch of equilibration or be in equilibrium in all its parts by the pressure of the wall  For since the arch is given the radius of cur∣vature and position of the tangent at every point of it will be given and consequently the pro∣portions of the verticals BH CI c And by assuming one of them or making it equal to an assigned length the rest will be found from it and then the line GHI c may be drawn through the extremities of them all  Corollary    AND if the line GHIK forming the top of the wall be given the curve of equilibration ABCD may be found And the manner of finding them both the one from the other we shall teach in the two following propositions  Corollary    IF the arch ABCD be a circle the radius of curvature will be constant and the angle kCP always measured by the arc DC sup∣posing D the vertex of the curve and then CI will be everywhere as the cube of the se∣cant of the arc DC  PROPOSITION IV  HAVING given the Intrados to find the Extrados That is given the nature or form of an arch to find the nature of the line forming the top of the superincumbent wall by whose pressure the arch is kept in equilibrium  Solution  LET D be the vertex of the given curve ABCD and K that of the required line GHIK Put  a  = DK  x  = AP the abscissa  y  = PC the ordinate  z  = DC the arch and  R  = the radius of curvature at the point C  Now by the last prop CI is as  But by similar triangles as  ẏ  ∶  ż  ∷ radius ∶  ż    ẏ  = sec ∠ kCP therefore CI is as ż    Rẏ    Again in every curve whose ordinate is refered to an axis the radius of curvature  R  is =  ż      ẏẍ    ẋÿ  wherefore CI will be as  ẏẍ    ẋÿ    ẏ      or CI = ẏẍẋÿ ẏ    ×  Q  where  Q  is a constant quantity  whose value will be determined by taking the expression for the given perpendicular DK at the vertex of the curve  Corollary  HENCE then as either  x  or  y  may be sup∣posed to flow uniformly and consequently either of their second fluxions equal to nothing by striking either of the terms out of the nume∣rator of the above value of CI and then ex∣terminating either of the unknown quantities by the equation of the curve the value of CI will be obtained as is done in the following examples  EXAMPLE  To find the extrados of a circular arch  diagram  LET Q be the center and D the vertex of the given circular arch K the vertex of the extrados and the other lines as in the figure  Put  a  = DK  r  = AQ = QD = the radius  x  = DP and  y  = PC = RI  Then  and  by making  ẋ  = Hence  But at the vertex  x  is = and then CI is  Consequently the value of  Q  is =  ar  And the general value of CI or  is    Otherwise  By making  ̇y  constant  THE notation remaining as before we have    and  Hence CI or ẏẍẋÿ y    × Q becomes  This when  y  = gives  a  =  Q    r  and  Q  =  ar  as before And conse∣quently  CI or  is  as before  Hence the equation to the curve KI is  or    Corollary    HENCE KIG is a curve running up an infi∣nite height towards G the perpendicular AG being an asymptote to it And the curve is accurately as represented in the figure when the thickness DK at the top is th of the span  Corollary    BUT the curve KIG is quite inconvenient for the form of the ex∣trados of any bridge  diagram  however a streight ho∣rizontal line IK might be used instead of it if the materials of which the arch is built could  be so chosen as that they might increase in their specific gravity from DK towards CI continually as the cube of the secant of the arch from D And this again perhaps would be quite impracticable But if a circular arch and a right line at the top were  necessarily  required the proportion of DK to the radius DQ may be found so as the arch may be  nearly  in equilibrium thus  When KI is a right line then KR in the figure to the example must be nothing or ra∣ther when the curve crosses the horizontal line then KR is equal to nothing put its value then as found above equal to o and we shall have  and from this equation by assuming one of the quantities  a y  the corresponding value of the other may be found for the point where the curve crosses the horizontal line so from hence the general value of  a  is  Now this va∣lue of  a  or DK evidently becomes = when the arch consists of the whole semicircle but  when the arch is less than the semicircle  a  will have a finite value and between and de∣grees many arches of equilibration of a certain thickness at top may be found Thus if the half arch DC contain degrees then its sine  y  or PC is = ½  r  which being substituted for it in the above general value of  a  we have  a  = √ × \  r  or = ¼  r  extremely near that is DK is = ¼ of DQ or ¼ of PC the span when the curve cuts the horizontal line directly above the point in the circle which an∣swers to degrees And if DC were an arch of degrees then  y  =  r  √ and  a  = √ ×  r  =  r  or of the span nearly Also if DC were degrees then  y  =  r  √ and  a  = th of  r  =  r  or of the span nearly So that in each of these cases the points C and D would be in equilibrium but then about the middle parts between D and C or rather nearer to D than to C the materials should be a little lighter than at D and C and the exact propor∣tion in which their gravity should be diminished might easily be found by calculation so in the first case in particular the specific gravity of the materials in the middle of the arch between D and C that is at degrees from D should be to that at D or C as to which is  but a very inconsiderable decrease and may be very well neglectedIn the first two cases the thickness at the top would be too much but in the latter one when the whole arch is degrees the thickness is just about that which the best architects now allow and in greater arches the thickness would become too little So that an arch of nearly about de∣grees is the only part of a circle that can be used with any degree of propriety  EXAMPLE  To determine the extrados of an elliptical arch of equilibration  diagram  SUPPOSE the curve in the above figure to be a semiellipse with either the longer or shorter  axe horizontal and let  h  denote the horizontal semiaxe AQ and  r  the vertical one DQ and all the other letters as in the last example  Then by the nature of the ellipse  hence  and  by making  ẋ  constant Then  is  But when  x  is = this expression becomes  a  =  rQ    hh  and then  Q  =  ahh    r  consequently CI is  the same as in the circleAnd the same expression may be brought out by making  y  constant  Hence the nature of the curve KI is thus ex∣pressed  and is of the same kind with that in the last exampleBut the elliptic arch may take a streight line at top better than the circular one when the longer axe is  horizontal because the arch is flatter or of a less curvature and worse than the circular arch when the shorter axe is horizontal  EXAMPLE  To determine the figure of the extrados of a para∣bolic arch of equilibration  diagram  PUT  a  = KD  r  = DQ  h  = QA  x  = DP and  y  = PC = RI  Then by the nature of the curve  hh  ∶  yy  ∷  r  ∶  x  =  ryy    hh  and hence  ẋ  =  ryẏ    hh  and  ẋ  =  rẏ    hh  by making  ẏ  constant Then CI =  ẍ    ẏ    ×  Q  is =  rQ    hh  = a constant quantity =  a  that is CI is everywhere equal to KD  Consequently KR is = DP and since RI is = PC it is evident that KI is the same para∣bolic curve with DC and may be placed any height above it  EXAMPLE  To find the figure of the extrados for an hyper∣bolic arch of equilibration  diagram  PUT  a  = KD  r  = the semitransverse and  h  = the semiconjugate axe  x  = DP and  y  = PC = RI  Then by the nature of the hyperbola  hence  and  by making  ẋ  constant Wherefore CI or  But  when  x  = this expression becomes  rQ    hh  =  a  hence  Q  =  ahh    r  and consequently CI or  is    Whence the equation to the curve KI re∣quired will be    Scholium  In this hyperbolic arch then it is evident that the extrados KI continually approaches nearer to the intrados whereas in the circular and elliptic arches it goes off continually far∣ther from it and in the parabola the two curves keep always at the same distance ob∣serving however that by the distance between the two curves in each of these cases is meant their distance in the vertical direction  EXAMPLE  To find the extrados for a catenarian arch of equilibration  diagram  LET  a  = KD  x  = DP and  y  = PC = RI as before also let  c  denote the constant tension of the curve at the vertex  Then by the nature of the catenary  y  is =  c  × hyp log of  hence taking the fluxions we have  and  by making  ẋ  constant Wherefore CI or  ẋÿ    ẏ    ×  Q  is  c  +  x    cc  ×  Q  But at the vertex  x  is = and CI =  a  =  Q    c  consequently  Q  is =  ac  This being  written for it there results CI =  c  +  x    c  ×  a  =  a  +  ax  \  c  Hence for the nature of the curve KI we have KR =  a  +  x  CI =  x    ax    c  =  c    a    c  ×  x  Corollary  AND hence the abscissa DP is to the abscissa KR always in the constant proportion of  c  to  c    a  So that when  a  is less than  c  R and the curve KI lies below the horizontal line but when  a  is greater than  c  they lie above it and when  a  is equal to  c  KR is always equal to nothing and KI or the extrados coincides with the horizontal line  As  a  diminishes the line KI approaches nearer to DC in all its parts till when  a  entirely va∣nishes or is so little in respect of  c  as to be omitted in the expression  c    a    c  ×  x  = KR the two curves quite coincide throughout  Scholium  As we have found above that the extrados will be a streight horizontal line when  a  is equal  to  c  I shall here make a calculation to deter∣mine in that case the value of  c  and conse∣quently of  a  with respect to  x  and  y  or a given span and height of an arch  Now the equation to the curve expressed in terms of  c x  and  y  is  y  =  c  × hyp log of  and when  x  and  y  are given the value of  c  may be found from this equation by the method of trial and error But as the process would be at best but a tedious one and perhaps the method not easy in this case to be practised by every person I shall here investigate a series for finding the value of  c  from those of  x  and  y  in a direct manner  Since then  y  is =  c  × hyp log of  by taking the fluxion of this equation we have  by writing  d  for  c  and by ex∣panding this expression into a series it becomes  ẏ  =  ẋ  √  d    x  × ∶  x    d  + ·  x    ·  d    ··  x    ··  d    + ···  x    ···  d  c  and by taking the fluents we have  y  = √  dx  × ∶  x  ·  d  + ·  x    ··  d    ··  x    ···  d    + ···  x    ····  d    c and hence by dividing by  x  we have  y    x  = √  d    x  × ∶  x  ·  d  + ·  x    ··  d    ··  x    ···  d    + ···  x    ····  d    c or by writing  v  for  y    x  and  w  for √  d    x  it is  v  =  w  ·  w  + ···  w    ·····  w    + ·······  w    c Then by reverting this series we have  w  =  v  +  v    v    +  v      v    c And hence by squaring c and restoring the ori∣ginal letters it is ½  d  = ½  xw    =  c  = ½  x  × ∶  y      x    + ⅓  x      y    +  x      y      x      y    c where a few of the first terms are sufficient to determine the value of  c  pretty nearly  Now for an example in numbers suppose the height of the arch to be feet and its span which are nearly the dimensions of the middle arch of Blackfriar's Bridge at Lon∣don Then  x  = and  y  = which being substituted for them in this series it gives  c  = feet nearly So that to have made that arch a catenarian one with a streight line above the top of the arch must have been almost of the  immense thickness of feet to have kept it in equilibrium  But if the height and span be and feet as above and the thickness of the arch at top be assumed equal to feet then the extrados will not be a right line but as it is drawn in the figure to this example which figure is accurately constructed according to these dimensions  It may be farther remarked that the curves in these last three examples viz the parabola hy∣perbola and catenary are all very improper for the arches of a bridge consisting of several arches because it is evident from their figures which are all accurately constructed that all the build∣ing or filling up of the flanks of the arches will tend to destroy the equilibrium of them But in a bridge of one single arch whose extrados rises pretty much from the spring to the top one of these figures will answer better than any of the former ones  EXAMPLE  To determine the extrados of a cycloidal arch of equilibration  diagram  LET DZQ be the circle from which the cy∣cloid DCA is generated and the other lines as before  Put  a  = DK  x  = DP and  y  = PC = RI also put  d  = DQ the diameter of the circle and  z  = the circular arc DZ  Then by the nature of the cycloid CZ is always equal to DZ =  z  and by the nature of the circle PZ is  wherefore PC or  Hence  but  by the nature of the circle therefore  and then  making  ẋ  constant Hence  But when  x  = CI is =  a  =  Q    d  therefore  Q  =  ad  and then the general value of CI is    Consequently  will express the nature of the curve KI which resembles that for the circle and ellipse as evidently appears by comparing the figures together each of them being accurately constructed But this figure seems to be rather better than either of them as the extrados ap∣proaches rather nearer to a right line and ex∣tends farther out before it is bent upwards  Other examples of known curves might be given but those that have been put down al∣ready seem to be the fittest for real practice and there is a sufficient variety among them to suit the various circumstances of convenience strength and beauty  I shall now proceed to another general pro∣blem which is the reverse of the last one and determines the figure of the intrados for any given figure of the extrados so that the arch may be in equilibrium in all its parts  PROPOSITION V  HAVING the Extrados given to find the Intrados That is having given the nature or form of a line bounding the top of a wall above an arch to find the figure of the arch so that by the pressure of the superincumbent wall the whole may remain in equilibrium  Solution  PUT  a  = DK the thickness of the arch at top  x  = DP the ab∣scissa of the intrados DC  z  = KR the ab∣scissa of the given ex∣trados KI and  y  = PC = RI their equal ordi∣nates  diagram  Then by the last proposition CI is =  ẏẍ    ẋÿ    ẏ    ×  Q  but CI is also evidently equal to  a  +  x    z  therefore  a  +  x    z  is =  ẏẍ    ẋÿ    ẏ    ×  Q  =  Q    ẏ  × the fluxion of  ẋ    ẏ  where  Q  is a constant quan∣tity as used in the last proposition and always to be determined from the nature or conditions of each particular case  Hence then by substituting in this equation the given value of  z  instead of it as expressed in terms of  y  the resulting equation will then involve only  x  and  y  together with their first and second fluxions besides constant quantities And from it the relation between  x  and  y  themselves may be found by the application of such me∣thods as may seem to be best adapted to the parti∣cular form of the given equation to the extrados In general a proper series for the value of  x  in terms of  y  is to be assumed with indeterminate coefficients which series being put into fluxions striking out of every term the fluxion of  y  and the result fluxed again striking out from every term of this also the fluxion of  y  the last ex∣pression drawn into  Q  being equated to  a  +  x    z  there will be produced an equation from which will be found the values of the coefficients of the terms in the assumed value of  x  But in the particular case when  z  is always nothing or the extrados a right horizontal line  a different and easier process obtains as in this following example  EXAMPLE  TO find an arch of equilibration whose extrados shall be a horizontal line  diagram  Making the notation as in the proposition we have  z  = and therefore  a  +  x  =  Q    ẏ  × the fluxion of  ẋ    ẏ  Now assume  ẏ  =  ẋ    v  then  ẋ    ẏ  =  v  and  Q    ẏ  × flux of  ẋ    ẏ  =  Qvv̇    ẋ  that is  a  +  x  =  Qvv̇    ẋ  hence  aẋ  +  xẋ  =  Qvv̇  Then by taking the fluents we have  ax  +  x    =  Qv    hence  v  = √  ax  +  xx    Q  and consequently  Then the fluent of this is  but when  x  = this is  Q  ½  × hyp log of  a  therefore the correct fluent is    Or the fluent might be otherwise found thus  THE equation  a  +  x  =  ẏẍ    ẋÿ    ẏ    ×  Q  sup∣posing  ẏ  constant becomes  a  +  x  =  Qẍ    ẏ    or  aẏ    +  xẏ    =  Qẍ  multiply by  ẋ  and then  aẋẏ    +  xẋẏ    =  Qẋẍ  and hence by taking the fluents  axẏ    +  x    ẏ    =  Qẋ    consequently  ẏ    =  Qẋ      ax  +  xx  or  And then the rest will be as above  Now the value of  Q  will be found by writing in this equation some particular correspondent known values of  x  and  y  thus when P arrives at Q then  x  = DQ =  r  and  y  = QA =  h  these being substituted for them we have    and conse∣quently  Wherefore the general value of  y  is thus    Hence when  Q  ½  is =  a  the curve DC is the catenary and in general the ordinate is every∣where to the corresponding ordinate of the cate∣nary whose tension at the vertex is  a  as  h  is to    If  x  were desired in terms of  y  it would be thus Put  A  = the hyp log of  a  and  then  Again put  N  = the number whose hyp log is  Dy  +  A  then  and hence  or  a  +  x  = KP =  N    +  a      N  By taking AQ =  h  = and DQ =  r  = also DK =  a  = Then the hyp log  of  is = the hyp log of  the hyp log of · = · by which dividing  h  = the quo∣tient is · So that the ordinate  y  will be constantly in that case equal to · × the hyp log of  Also · = is =  D  and  A  = hyp log of = · then  N  = the number whose hyp log is · +  y  And then by assuming several values of one of the letters  x y  the corresponding values of the other will be found from one of the two equa∣tions above  And in this manner were calculated the num∣bers in the following table from which the curve being constructed it will be as appears in the figure to the exampleAnd thus we have an arch in equilibrium in all its parts and its top a streight line as is generally required in most bridges or at least they are so near a ho∣rizontal line that their difference from it will cause no sensible ill consequence It is also both both of a graceful figure and of a convenient form for the passage through it So that there can be no good reason for neglecting to use it in works of any consequence  The Table for Constructing the Curve in this Example  Value of KI  Value of IC                                                                                                                                                                                      The above numbers may be feet or any other lengths of which DQ is and QA is But when DQ is to QA in any other proportion than that of to or when DK is not to DQ as to or to then the above numbers will not answer but others must be found by the same rule to construct the curve by  In the beginning of the table as far as the value of KI is made to differ by because  the value of IC in that part increases so very slowly  Other examples of given extrados might be taken but as there can scarcely ever by any real occasion for them and as the trouble of calculation would be in most cases extremely great they are omitted  SECTION III  Of the Piers  PROPOSITION VI  To find the distance  QM  of the center of gravity of the given circular arc  AD  from  DQ  the versed sine of the said arc  QA  being its right sine  Solution  PUT  r  = the radius  z  = any arc DR and  x  = its sine TR or QS  diagram  Then by mechanics the force of a particle  ż  of the curve placed at R is TR ×  ż  =  xż  and the force of all the par∣ticles will be equal to the fluent of  xż  which must be equal to QM drawn into the whole line that is QM ×  z  = the fluent of  xż  or QM =  z  × fluent of  xż  And this is a ge∣neneral theorem whether  z  be a line surface or solid supposing the two former to be affected with gravity  Now by the nature of the circle  and therefore  the correct fluent of which is  Consequently QM is  which when  x  = QA and  z  = the arc AD becomes  the dis∣tance from DQ required  Or since  the same distance QM will be expressed by  r  × DQ ARD  Or lastly since  r  × QD is half the square of the chord AD the same distance QM will be equal to AD    ARD or AQ    +QD    ARD  Corollary  When ARD is a quadrant then AQ = QD =  r  and the rule is QM =  rr  ARD =  rr  ×  r  =  r  · Or QM = ⅔  r  nearly or =  r  extremely near  PROPOSITION VII  THE figure being the same as in the last proposition in is required to find the distance  Qm  of the center of gravity of the arc  ARD  from the sine  AQ  Solution  As in the last proposition QM will be = AR × the fluent of SR × AR  But putting  z  = AR  x  = QS = RT  r  = the radius  h  = DQ and  s  = QA we shall have  and  hence  the correct fluent of which is    Consequently Qm is =  h    r  +  s    x    z  ·  r  =  h    r  + AS  z  ·  r  And when R arrives at D it is Qm =  h    r  +  sr    A  Or since  r  is =  ss  +  hh    h  the same distance Qm will be =  hh    ss    h  +  hh  +  ss    h  ·  s    A  where  A  is the whole arc ARD  Corollary  When ARD is a quadrant then  h  and  s  are each =  s  and the rule is  rr    A  the same as in the corollary to the last  PROPOSITION VIII  To find the distance  QM  of the center of gravity of the space  AIKDSA  from  KQ  supposing  DA  to be a circular arc whose sine is  AQ  its versed sine  QD  and  AI IK  pa∣rallel to  DQ QA  respectively  Solution  Draw RS ST parallel to DQ QA And put  a  = DK  r  = VD = VW the radius of the circle  x  = TS = KR and  z  = the area DSRK  diagram  Then as in prop we shall have QM =  z  × the fluent of  xż  But  ż  is = RS ×  ẋ  and  Consequently  xż  is  the cor∣rect fluent of which is    Wherefore QM is  putting  m  = VK and  y  = VT And when SR arrives at AI then QM is  putting  A  for the whole space AIKDW  Corollary    WHEN DA is a quadrant then the space AIKDSA or AIKQ ASDQ is  and QA = QD =  r  Wherefore in that case QM =  a  +  r    a  +·  r  × ⅙  r  =  a  +  r    a  +·  r  × ½  r  Or QM is =  a  +  r    a  +⅔  r  × ½  r  =  a  +  r    a  +  r  × ½  r  nearly Or rather it is =  a  +  r    a  +  r  × ½  r  =  a  +  r    a  +  r  × ½  r  extremely near  Corollary    WHEN  a  is nothing then AD being a qua∣drant QM is  r  Or it is  r  very nearly  And when  a  is =  r  then QM is  r  Or  r  very nearly  Lastly when  a  =  r  which is nearly the proportion in pretty large arches then QM is =  r  Or  r  very nearly  PROPOSITION IX  To find the distance of the center of gravity of the space  kiDSA  from the sine  QA  of the circular arc  ASD  where  ki  is perpendicular to  QAk  and the rest of the lines as in the last figure  Solution  Put  a  = kA  s  = AQ  m  = kQ =  a  +  s r  = VW = VD the radius  z  = any variable space krSA and  x  = TS the sine of the arc SD Also  A  = the space kiDSA  Then rS =  m    x  and by the circle  hence  consequently  the correct fluent of which is  s      x    ×  m    s      x    Wherefore the distance from VW is Vm =  s      x      z  ×  m    s      x      z  for the general space krSA  And when S arrives at D  x  is = and then Vm is =  s    m    A    s      A  =  m    s    A  ×  s    =  a  +  s    A  ×  s    = kA+AQ kiDSA × AQ    = the distance of the center of gravity from VW  Corollary  WHEN  A  coincides with  W  or the arc a qua∣drant then  s  is =  r  and the rule becomes as in Corollary to the last Also the d Corollary to that may be understood here making the same suppositions as in it  Scholium  THE four preceding propositions are premised as necessary to the examples to the following general one which determines the thickness of  the piers necessary to resist the spread or shoot of any given arch and that whether the whole or part or none of it is immersed in water In∣stances only of circular arcs are here given because that in determining the drift of the arch whatever its curve may be it will make little or no difference by supposing it to be circular  PROPOSITION X  To find the thickness of the piers of an arch necessary to keep the arch in equilibrium or to resist its shoot or drift independent of any other arches  diagram  Solution  LET IKDA be the half arch and IHGL the pier to support it moveable about the point G and bisected by the perpendicular EF  Through the center of gravity of the arch AIKD draw MN perpendicular to AQ the semispan and meeting DN drawn parallel to AQ in N And continue QA to meet GH in B  Put  a  = DK  h  = DQ = MN  c  = AM  A  = the area or section AIKD of the arch  d  = AL = BG  e  = FE and  x  = AB = GL the required breadth of the pier  Now by prop  Emer  Mechan the weight of the arch is to its pressure in the direction AB as NM is to MA hence  h  ∶  c  ∷  A  ∶  cA    h  = the force or shoot of the arch in the direction AB which being drawn into the length of the lever BG = d we have  cdA    h  for the effica∣cious force of the arch to overset the pier or to turn it about the point G Again  ex  is = the area of the section of the pier which being supposed to be collected into the middle line EF it may be considered as a weight appended to the end E of the lever EG therefore  ex  × EG = ½  exx  will be the efficacious force of the pier to prevent its being overturned And that the arch and pier may be just kept in equilibrium we must make the force and resistance equal to each other that is ½  exx  =  cdA    h  Hence then  x  = √  cdA    eh  = √ AM×AL×  A  DQ×EF will be the breadth or thick∣ness of the pier required  In the above investigation it is supposed that the whole of the pier was out of water But if any part of it OL be supposed to be im∣mersed in water that part will lose so much of its weight as is equal to its bulk of water and since the specific gravity of water is to that of common stone as is to ½ or as to it is evident that OL will lose parts in of its weight Hence then putting  g  = OG since OG × GL =  gx  is the area immersed there∣fore ⅖  gx  = the weight lost by the immersion which being taken from  ex  the whole we shall have  ex    gx  as the weight remaining ap∣pended to E then this being drawn into GE = ½  x  and the product equated to the efficacious force of the arch as before we have ½  exx    gxx  =  cdA    h  and hence  x  = √  cdA    h  ·  e    g  for the thickness of the pier when it is im∣mersed in water to the height expressed by  g  Or because  g  will be nearly equal to  d  the theorem for the thickness may be  x  = √  cdA    h  ·  e    d  = √ AM×AL×  A  DQ×EFAL  Corollary    When DA is a quadrant the arch is a com∣plete semicircle and then  h  is =  r  as in Cor to prop and by the same Corollary  c  or  r  QM is  Consequently  cA  is    This value being substituted in the two pre∣ceding theorems we have  thickness of the pier when it it is dryOr if  n  express what part  a  is of  r  or DK =  n  th of DQ or QA the same thickness will be    And the thickness when AL is under water will be    Or if  a  =  r    n  as before the same thickness will be    Corollary    diagram  WHEN HG is = BG in the last figure then the arch and pier will be as in this an∣nexed figure And  e  being then =  d  the two general theo∣rems will become  x  = √  cA    h  = √  A  ×AM DQ for the thickness of the pier when dry and  x  = √  cA    h  = √  A  ×AM DQ = the thickness when under water  So that in this case it makes no difference of whatever height LA the pier is to the springing  of the arch For though the drift of the arch be increased with the length of the lever or height of the pier the weight of the pier itself which acts against it is also increased in the same proportion  Scholium  IN the investigation of this proposition the sections of the arch and pier are used for their solidities as being evidently in the same pro∣portion or in that of their weights since they are of the same length viz the breadth of the bridge  By the above rules together with those in the four preceding propositions the necessary thick∣ness of a pier may be found so that it shall  just  balance the spread or shoot of the arch independent of any other arch on the other side of the pier But the weight of the pier ought a little to preponderate against or exceed in ef∣fect the shoot of the arch and therefore the thickness ought to be taken a little more than what will be found by these rules unless it be supposed that the pointed projections of the piers against the stream beyond the common breadth of the bridge will be a sufficient addi∣tion to the pier to give it the necessary pre∣ponderancy But there is one very material thing on account of which the thickness of the piers may be much diminished viz by the  stones of the wall above the voussoirs being bonded in with those of the pier and with one another the pier will carry part of their weight which will not only diminish the weight of the whole arch and wall but will also both add the same to the weight of the pier and lengthen the lever EG by moving the center of gravity a little nearer to L but then also M will be a little nearer to Q so that AM will be longer and the effects of the change of the centers of gravity may be supposed nearly to balance each otherIn the foregoing propo∣sitions I have considered circular arches only as it will make no difference of any consequence to suppose the arches of any other curve of the same span and pitch But this th prop is general for all curves  I shall now add a few examples of the cal∣culation in numbers to shew the manner and in them also to point out the easiest methods of calculation  EXAMPLE  SUPPOSING the arch in the figure to the pro∣position to be a semicircle whose height or pitch is feet and consequently its span feet also suppose the thickness DK at top to be feet and the height LA to the springing and let it be required to find the thickness GL  of the pier necessary to resist the drift of the arch  This will be immediately found by Cor in which AQ is = AL = and  n  =  r    a  = = ½  Then the first expression  will become √ = · or feet nearly for the thickness of the pier when dry  And the latter expression  will give √ = · feet for the thickness when feet are under water  EXAMPLE  In the same figure suppose the span to be feet the height feet also the thickness at top feet and the height of the pier to the springer feet as before  Here the figure either is or may be consi∣dered as a scheme arch or the segment of a circle in which the versed sine QD is = and the right sine QA = also DK = AL = EF =  Now by the nature of the circle the radius VD =  r  is = QA    +QD    QD =    +    = ¼ hence VQ = ¼ = ¼ and the area of the semisegment ADQ will be found to be or nearly which being taken from the rectangle AIKQ = AQ × QK = × = there remains =  A  the area AIKD Then by prop QM will be = VD    VQ      A  × VK VD    VQ      A  = ·    ·    × × ¼ ·    ·    × = · and consequently MA = AQ QM = · = ·  Then the first expression √ AL×AM×  A  DQ×EF will become √ ×·×× = · or ⅔ feet nearly = the thickness of the pier when dry  And the latter expression √ AL×AM×  A  DQ×EFAL will give √ ×·×× = · or ½ feet nearly = the thickness when feet are under water  EXAMPLE  diagram  LET the arch be of the gothic kind as in the annexed figure in which DA is a circular arc whose center is V its sine DQ = = the height of the arch its versed sine AQ = = the semispan the thickness at top DK = and the height AL of the pier to the spring = as before  Here the radius VA = ¼ as in the last ex∣ample and the semisegment ADQ = also the same as in the last example then the rectangle IQ is = AQ × QK = × = from which taking the semisegment there re∣mains =  A  for the area AIKD Then by prop VM will be equal to KD+DQ  A  × DQ    = +× ×    = · and hence MA =  c  = =  Then the first expression √ AL×AM×  A  DQ×IL will become √ ×·×× = · or nearly feet for the thickness of the pier when when it is all out of water  And the latter one √ AL×MA×  A  DQ×ILAL will give √ ×·×× = · or ½ nearly = the thickness when feet are under water  EXAMPLE  WHEN the arch stones only are laid and the pier built no higher than the spring it will ap∣pear as in the figure to corollary And then if in the first case the arch be a complete semicircle whose diameter is feet and the thickness everywhere DK = AS = feet It is required to find the breadth of the piers  The bounding arcs being quadrants the area ADKS will be AD+KS × DK = + × × = × = · = A Now if TW be another concentric quadrant bisecting the area ADKS the center of gravity of TW  may be taken for that of the said area And then by the corollary to prop QM will be QT but since the quadrants QDA QTW QKS are in arithmetic progression the squares of their semidiameters QD QT QK will be in the same progression that is QT    = QD    + QK    or QT = √ QD    +QK    = √    +    = · hence then QM = QT is = × · = · and consequently MA = · = ·  Then the former of the two expressions in corollary to this proposition will give GL or √  A  ×AM DQ = √ ·×· = · or feet for the thickness of the pier when out of water  And the latter one √  A  ×AM DQ will be∣come √ ×· = · or nearly feet for the thickness when the pier is immersed in water  Scholium  OR because QT is nearly an arithmetic mean between QD and QK half the sum of OD and QK might have been used instead of it  without causing any sensible difference in the conclusion  We might also exhibit general theorems for the thickness in terms of the radius only For taking QT or QW = QD+QK by the corollary to prop we have QM = QW = QD+QK × and thence AM =  c  = AQ QM = QA QD+QK = QDDK Also  A  = AD+KS × DK = QD+QK × DK = QD+DK × DK Then these values being substituted in the expression √  A  ×AM QD we shall have √ QD    QD×DKDK    QD × DK for the thickness of the pier when dry and the same expression multiplied by √ will give the thickness when the pier is immersed in water And farther if DK be assumed equal to any part of DQ as DK =  n  × DQ then the thickness in the former case will be QD × √  n    nn  ×  n  and in the latter QD × √  n    nn  ×  n  Then by assuming several values of  n  from to ⅕ which are beyond the limits of it the several breadths of the piers corresponding to the several values of the thickness of the arch both when the pier is supposed to be out of water and immersed in it will be found from these expressions as in the following table where the fractional part ½ or is also given because it is the most common proportion  A table of the Breadth or Thickness of a Pier answering to the several thicknesses of a semicircular arch as in the foregoing ex∣ample  QD  being the radius or semispan  For the pier dry  For the pier in water  Thickness of the arch  Thickness of the pier  Thickness of the arch  Thickness of the pier  QD  QD  QD  QD  QD  QD  QD  QD  ⅛ QD  QD  ⅛ QD  QD  ½ QD  QD  ½ QD  QD  QD  QD  QD  QD  ⅙ QD  QD  ⅙ QD  QD  ⅕ QD  QD  ⅕ QD  QD  EXAMPLE  BUT supposing the same figure in Cor to be a circular segment whose chord or span is feet and height feet also the thickness of the arch feet To find the thickness of the piers  Here the radius of the middle arc TW is QW    +QT    QT =    +    = hence TW is an arc of ° ′ and its length will be which being multiplied by DK = AS = we have  A  = Then by prop QM will be found =    +    ×· = · And consequently AM = =  Hence by Cor it will be √  A  ×AM DQ = √ ·×· the thickness of the pier when dry  And √  A  ×AM DQ = √ ·×· = · = the thickness in water  Otherwise  BUT if the arch be supposed to increase in thickness from the top at D where it is feet all the way to the spring where it is AS = feet suppose the height and span being and as before  Then QS = QW = and QT = Hence the radius of the arc TW will be QW    +QT    QT =    +    = · and therefore TW is an arc of ° ′ and its length = Consequently the area ADKS or TW × DK+AS will be × = =  A  And by prop QM will be    +    ×· = · and therefore AM = =  Hence as above √ ·×· = · will be the thickness of the pier when dry  And √ ·×· = · = the thick∣ness in water  EXAMPLE  In a gothic arch whose thickness at top is the span and height feet to find the thickness of the piers  diagram  By the last example TW is = its radius and the area ADKS = Then by prop we have  and hence AM = =  Then by Cor we shall have √ ×·×· = · for the thick∣ness of the pier when dry  And √ ·×· = · the thickness when in water  Also if the arch stones were supposed to lengthen all the way from the top towards the lower end the calculation might be made as in the last example  Having in these d and d sections gone through the calculations for the form of arches and the thickness of piers I shall now in the next section add some investigations of rules for determining the best form of the ends of the piers with the force of the water upon them c  SECTION IV  The Force of the Water c  PROPOSITION XI  TO determine the form of the ends of a pier so as to make the least resistance to or be the least subject to the force of the stream of water  Solution  LET the following figure represent a hori∣zontal section of the pier AB its breadth CD the given length or projection of the end and ADB the line required whether right or cur∣ved also let EF represent the force of a par∣ticle of water acting on AD at F in the di∣rection parallel to the axe CD produce EF to meet AB in G and draw the tangent FH also draw EH perpendicular to FH HI per∣pendicular to EF and FK perpendicular to DC  diagram  Now the absolute force EF of the particle of water may be resolved into the two forces EH HF and in those directions of these the latter one acting parallel to the curve is of no effect and the former EH is resolved into the two EI IH so that EI is the efficacious force of the particle to move the pier in the direction of its axe or length That is the absolute force is to the efficacious force as EF is to EI Then since EF is the diameter of a semicircle passing through H by the nature of the circle we shall have EF ∶ EI ∷ EF    ∶ EH    ∷ by similar triangles HF    ∶ HI    and ∷ the square of the fluxion of the curve or line ∶ the square of the fluxion of the ordinate FK because HF HI are parallel to the line and ordinate  Wherefore putting the abscissa DK =  x  the ordinate KF =  y  and the line DF =  z  we shall have as  ż    ∶  ẏ    ∷ the force EF ∶  ẏ      ż    = the force of the particle at F to move the pier in the direction EFG But the number of particles striking against the indefinitely small part of the line is as  ẏ  this drawn into the above found force of each we have  ẏ      ż    =  ẏ      ẋ    +  ẏ    for the fluxion of the force or the force acting against the part z′ of the line  But by the proposition the whole force on DFA must be a minimum or the fluent of  ẏ      ẋ    +  ẏ    must be a minimum when that of  ẋ  becomes equal to the constant quantity DC in which case it will be found that  must be always equal to a constant quantity  q  and hence    Now in this equation it is evident that  ẋ  is to  ẏ  in a constant ratio but if two fluxions be always in a constant ratio their fluents  x y  are known to be also in a constant ratio which is the property of a right line  Wherefore DFA is a right line and the end ADB of the pier must be a rightlined triangle that the force of the water upon it may be the least possible  PROPOSITION XII  TO determine the resistance of the end of a pier against the stream of water  Solution  USING here the figure and notation of the last proposition by the same it is found that the fluxion of the force of the stream against the face DF is  ẏ      ẋ    +  ẏ    and since the fluxion of the force against the base is  ẏ  it follows that the force of the stream against the base AB is to the force against the face ADB as  y  the fluent of  ẏ  is to the fluent of  ẏ      ẋ    +  ẏ    That is the the absolute force of the stream is to the effica∣cious force against the face of the pier as its breadth is to double the fluent of  ẏ      ẋ    +  ẏ    when  y  is equal to half the breadth  Corollary  IF the face ADB be retilineal  Putting DC =  a  CA =  b  and  as  a  ∶  b  ∷  x  ∶  y  by similar  triangles hence  x  =  ay    b  and  ẋ  =  aẏ    b  this be∣ing written for it in the general expression above we have  for the fluxion of the force on AD the fluent of which or  bby    cc  is the force itself And conse∣quently the force on the flat base AB is to that on the triangular end as  y  to  bby    cc  or as  cc  to  bb  that is as AD    to AC      And if AC be equal to CD or ADB a right angle which is generally the case then AD    = AC    and the force on the base to that on the face as to  Moreover as the force on ADB when ADB is a right angle is only half of the absolute force so it is evident that the force will be more than onehalf when ADB is greater than a right angle and less when it is less and also that the longer AD is the less the force is it being always inversely as the square of AD  Corollary  IF ADB be a semicircle  The radius AC = CD =  a  then  ax    xx  =  yy  or  and  hence  becomes  the fluent of which is  aa  ⅓  vy    aa  ×  y  and therefore the force on the base is to the force on the circular end as  y  is to  aa  ⅓  yy    aa  ×  y  or as  aa  to  aa  ⅓  yy  or as  aa  to  aa    yy  And when  y  =  a  = AC the proportion be∣comes that of to  So that only onethird of the absolute force is taken off by making the end a semicircle  Corollary  WHEN the face ADB is a parabola  Then the notation being as before viz DC =  a  and AC =  b  we have  a  ∶  bb  ∷  x  ∶  yy  hence  x  =  ayy    bb  and  ẋ  =  ayẏ    bb  which being  A TABLE of the natural RISE of WATER in Proportin to the Resistance or

arising from its obstruction by the piers accord∣ing to several rates of velocity c  SECTION V  Of the Terms or Names of the various parts peculiar to a Bridge and the Machines c used about it disposed in alphabetical order  ABUTMENT or BUTMENT which see in its place below  ARCH and opening of a bridge through or under which the water c passes and which is supported by piers or by butments  Arches are denominated circular elliptical cycloidal catenarian c according to the figure of the curve of them There are also other denominations of circular arches according to the different parts of a circle So a semicircular arch is half the circle a scheme or skeen arch is a segment less than the semicircle and arches of the third and fourth point or gothic arches consist of two circular arcs excentric and meet∣ing in an angle at top each being d or th c of the whole circle  The chief properties of the most considerable arches with regard to the extrados they re∣quire c may be learned from the second sec∣tion It there appears that none but the arch  of equilibration in the example to prop can admit of a horizontal line at top that this arch is not only of a graceful but of a convenient form as it may be made higher or lower at pleasure with the same opening that it but no other with a horizontal top can be equally strong in all its parts and therefore ought to be used in all works of much consequence All the other arches require tops that are curved either upward or downward some more and some less Of these the elliptical arch seems to be the fittest to be substituted instead of the equilibrial one with any tolerable degree of propriety it is in general also the best form for most bridges as it can be made of any height to the same span or of any span to the same height while at the same time its hanches are sufficiently ele∣vated above the water even when it is pretty flat at top which is a property of which the other curves are not possessed in the same de∣gree and this property is the more valuable because it is remarked that after an arch is built and the centering struck it settles more about the hanches than the other parts by which other curves are reduced near to a streight line at the hanches Elliptical arches also look bolder are really stronger and require less ma∣terials and labour than the others Of the other curves the cycloidal arch is next in quality to the elliptical one for all the above properties And lastly the circle As to the others the  parabola hyperbola and catenary they may not at all be admitted in bridges of several arches but may in some cases be used for a bridge of one single arch which is to rise very high because then not much loaded at the hanches We may hence also perceive the fal∣sity of those arguments which assert that be∣cause the catenarian curve supports itself equally in all its parts it will therefore best support any additional weight laid upon it for the additional building made to raise the bridge to a horizontal line or nearly such by pressing more in one part than another must force those parts down and the whole must fall Whereas other curves will not support themselves at all without some additional parts built above them to balance them or to reduce their parts to an equilibrium  ARCHIVOLT the curve or line formed by the upper sides of the voussoirs or arch stones It is parallel to the intrados or underside of the arch when the voussoirs are all of the same length otherwise not  By the archivolt is also sometimes understood the whole set of voussoirs  BANQUET the raised foot path at the sides of the bridge next the parapet This ought to be allowed in all bridges of any considerable  size it should be raised about a foot above the middle or horse passage made c feet broad according to the size of the bridge and paved with large stones whose length is equal to the breadth of the walk  BATTARDEAU or  Cofferdam  a case of pi∣ling c without a bottom fixed in the bed of the river watertight or nearly so by which to lay the bottom dry for a space large enough to build the pier on When it is fixed its sides reaching above the level of the water the water is pumped out of it or drawn off by engines c till the space be dry and it is kept so by the same means if there are leaks which cannot be stopped till the pier is built up in it and then the materials of it are drawn up again  Battardeaux are made in various manners either by a single inclosure or by a double one with clay or chalk rammed in between the two to prevent the water from coming through the sides And these inclosures are also made either with piles only driven close by one another and sometimes notched or dovetailed into each other or with piles grooved in the sides driven in at a distance from one another and boards let down between them in the grooves  The method of building in battardeaux can∣not well be used where the river is either deep or rapid It also requires a very good natural bottom of solid earth or clay for although the sides be made watertight if the bottom or bed of the river be of a loose consistence the water will ooze up through it in too great abundance to be evacuated by the engines  It is almost needless to remark that the sides must be made very strong and well propt or braced in the inside to prevent the ambient water from pressing the sides in and forcing its way into the battardeau  BRIDGE a work of carpentry or masonry built over a river canal c for the conve∣niency of crossing the same  A stone bridge is an edifice forming a way over a river c supported by one arch or by several arches and these again supported by proper piers or butments  A stately bridge over a large river is one of the most noble and striking pieces of art To behold huge and bold arches composed of an immense quantity of small materials as stones bricks c so disposed and united together that  they seem to form but one solid compact body affording a safe passage for men and carriages over large waters which with their navigation pass free and easy under them at the same time is a sight truly surprizing and affecting indeed  To the absolutely necessary parts of a bridge already mentioned viz the arches piers and abutments may be added the paving at top the parapet wall either with or without a ba∣lustrade c also the banquet or raised foot way on each side leaving a sufficient breadth in the middle for horses and carriages The breadth of a bridge for a great city should be such as to allow an easy passage for three carriages and two horsemen abreast in the middle way and for three foot passengers in the same manner on each banquet And for other less bridges a less breadth  As a bridge is made for a way or passage over a river c so it ought to be made of such a height as will be quite convenient for that passage but yet so as to be consistent with the interest and concerns of the river itself easily admitting through its arches the craft that navi∣gate upon it and all the water even at high tides and floods The neglect of this precept has been the ruin of many bridges and parti∣cularly that at Newcastle over the river Tyne on the th of november So that in de∣termining  its height the conveniencies both of the passage over it and under it should be con∣sidered and the height made to answer the best for them both observing to make the  convenient  give place to the  necessary  when their interests are opposite  Bridges are generally placed in a direction perpendicular to the stream in a direct line to give free passage to the water c But some think they should be made not in a streight line but convex towards the stream the better to resist floods c And some such bridges have been made  Again a bridge should not be made in too narrow a part of a navigable river or one sub∣ject to tides or floods because the breadth be∣ing still more contracted by the piers will in∣crease the depth velocity and fall of the water under the arches and endanger the whole bridge and navigation  The number of arches of a bridge are gene∣rally made odd either that the middle of the stream or chief current may flow freely without the interruption of a pier or that the two halves of the bridge by gradually rising from the ends to the middle may there meet in the highest and largest arch or else for the sake of grace that by being open in the middle the eye in  viewing it may look directly through there as one always expects to do in looking at it and without which opening one generally feels a disappointment in viewing it  If the bridge be equally high throughout the arches being all of a height are made all of a size which causes a great saving of centering If the bridge be higher in the middle than at the ends let the arches decrease from the middle to∣wards each end but so as that each half have the arches exactly alike and that they decrease in span proportionally to their height so as to be always the same kind of figure and similar parts of that figure thus if one be a semicircle let the rest be semicircles also but proportionally less if one be a segment of a circle let the rest be similar segments of other circles and so for other figures The arches being equal at equal distances on both sides of the middle is not only for the strength and beauty of the bridge but that the centering of the one half may serve for the other also But if the bridge be higher at the ends than in the middle the arches ought to increase in span and pitch from the middle towards the ends  When the middle and ends are of different heights their difference however ought not to be great in proportion to the length that the ascent may be easy and then also it is more  beautiful to make the top one continued curve than two inclined streight lines from the ends towards the middle  Bridges should rather be of few and large arches than of many and small ones if the height and situation will possibly allow of it for this will leave more free passage for the water and navigation and be a great saving in materials and labour as there will be fewer piers and centers and the arches themselves will require less materials  For the fabric of a bridge and the proper estimation of the expence c there are gene∣rally necessary three plans three sections and an elevation The three plans are so many horizontal sections viz the first a plan of the foundation under the piers with the particular circumstances attending it whether of gratings planks piles c the second is the plan of the piers and arches c and the third is the plan of the superstructure with the paved road and banquet The three sections are vertical ones the first of them a longitudinal section from end to end and through the middle of the breadth the second a transverse one or across it and through the summit of an arch and the third also across and taken upon a pier The eleva∣tion is an orthographic projection of one side or face of the bridge or its appearance as viewed  at an infinite distance and shews the exterior aspect of the materials and the manner in which they are worked and decorated  Other observations are to be seen in the first section  BUTMENTS or  abutments  the extremities of a bridge by which it joins to or abuts upon the land or sides of the river c These must be made very secure quite immovable and more than barely sufficient to resist the drift of its adjacent arch So that if there are not rocks or very solid banks to raise them against they must be well reinforced with proper walls or returns c The thickness of them that will be barely sufficient to resist the shoot of the arch may be calculated as that of a pier by prop  When the foundation of a butment is raised against a sloping bank of rock gravel or good solid earth it will produce a saving of materials and labour to carry the work on by returns at different heights like steps of stairs  CAISSON a kind of  chest  or flatbottomed boat in which a pier is built then sunk to the bed of the river and the sides loosened and taken off from the bottom by a contrivance for that purpose the bottom of it being left  under the pier as a foundation It is evident therefore that the bottoms of caissons must be made very strong and fit for the foundations of the piers The caisson is kept afloat till the pier be built to about the height of lowwater mark and for that purpose its sides must either be made of more than that height at first or else gradually raised to it as it sinks by the weight of the work so as always to keep its top above water And therefore the sides must be made very strong and kept asunder by cross timbers within lest the great pressure of the ambient water crush the sides in and so not only endanger the work but also drown the men who work within it The caisson is made of the shape of the pier but some feet wider on every side to make room for the men to work the whole of the sides are of two pieces both joined to the bottom quite around and to each other at the salient angle so as to be disengaged from the bottom and from each other when the pier is raised to the desired height and sunk It is also convenient to have a little sluice made in the bottom occasionally to open and shut to sink the caisson and pier sometimes by before it be finished to try if it bottom level and rightly for by opening the sluice the water will rush in and fill it to the height of the exterior water and the weight of the work already built will sink it then by shutting the sluice again and pumping out the  water it will be made to float again and the rest of the work may be completed but it must not be sunk but when the sides are high enough to reach above the surface of the water otherwise it cannot be raised and laid dry again Mr Labelye tells us that the caissons in which he built some of the piers of Westminster bridge contained above load of fir timber of cubic feet each and was of more tonnage or capacity than a gun ship of war  CENTERS are the timber frames erected in the spaces of the arches to turn them on by building on them the voussoirs of the arch As the center serves as a foundation for the arch to be built on when the arch is completed that foundation is struck from under it to make way for the water and navigation and then the arch will stand of itself from its curved fi∣gure A center must therefore be constructed of the exact figure of the intended arch convex as the arch is concave to receive it on as a mould If the form be circular the curve is struck from a central point by a radius if it be elliptical it ought to be struck with a dou∣bled cord passing over two pins or nails fixed in the focusses as the mathematicians describe their ellipses and not by striking different pieces or arcs of circles from several centers for these will form no ellipse at all but an irregular mis∣shapen curve made up of broken pieces of dif∣ferent  circular arcs but if the arch be of any other form the several abscissas and ordinates ought to be calculated then their corresponding lengths transferred to the centering will give so many points of the curve and exactly by which points bending a bow of pliable matter the curve may be drawn by it  The centers are constructed of beams c of timber firmly pinned and bound together into one entire compact frame covered smooth at top with planks or boards to place the voussoirs on the whole supported by offsets in the sides of the piers and by piles driven into the bed of the river and capable of being raised and depressed by wedges contrived for that purpose and for taking them down when the arch is completed They ought also to be constructed of a strength more than sufficient to bear the weight of the arch  In taking the center down first let it down a little all in a piece by easing some of the wedges there let it rest a few hours or days to try if the arch make any efforts to fall or any joints open or stones crush or crack c that the damage may be repaired before the center is entirely removed which is not to be done till the arch ceases to make any visible efforts  In some bridges the centering makes a very considerable part of the expence and therefore all means of saving in this article ought to be closely attended to such as making few arches and as nearly alike or similar as possible that the centering of one arch may serve for others and at least that the same center may be used for both of each pair of equal arches on both sides of the middle  CHEST the same as  Caisson  COFFERDAM the same as  Battardeau  DRIFT  Shoot  or  Thrust  of an arch is the push or force which it exerts in the direction of the length of the bridge This force arises from the perpendicular gravitation of the stones of the arch which being kept from descending by the form of the arch and the resistance of the pier exert their force in a lateral or hori∣zontal direction This force is computed in prop where the thickness of the pier is de∣termined that is necessary to resist it and is greater the lower the arch is  coeteris paribus  ELEVATION the orthographic projection of the front of a bridge on the vertical plane pa∣rallel to its length This is necessary to shew the form and dimensions of the arches and other  parts as to height and breadth and therefore has a plain scale annexed to it to measure the parts by It also shews the manner of working up and decorating the fronts of the bridge  EXTRADOS the exterior curvature or line of an arch In the propositions of the second section it is the outer or upper line of the wall above the arch but it often means only the upper or exterior curve of the voussoirs  FOUNDATIONS the bottoms of the piers c or the bases on which they are built These bottoms are always to be made with projections greater or less according to the spaces on which they are built And according to the nature of the ground depth and velocity of water c the foundations are laid and the piers built after different manners either in caissons in battar∣deaux on stilts with sterlings c for the par∣ticular methods of doing which see each under its respective term  The most obvious and simple method of lay∣ing the foundations and raising the piers up to watermark is to turn the river out of its course above the place of the bridge into a new channel cut for it near the place where it makes an elbow or turn then the piers are built on dry ground and the water turned into its old course again the new one being securely banked  up This is certainly the best method when the new channel can be easily and conveniently made but which however is seldom or never the case  Another method is to lay only the space of each pier dry till it be built by surrounding it with piles and planks driven down into the bed of the river so close together as to exclude the water from coming in then the water is pumped out of the inclosed space the pier built in it and lastly the piles and planks drawn up This is cofferdam work but evidently cannot be practised if the bottom be of a loose con∣sistence admitting the water to ooze and spring up through it  When neither the whole nor part of the river can be easily laid dry as above other methods are to be used such as to build either in cais∣sons or on stilts both which methods are de∣scribed under their proper words or yet by another method which hath though seldom been sometimes used without laying the bottom dry and which is thus the pier is built upon strong rafts or gratings of timber well bound together and buoyed up on the surface of the water by strong cables fixed to other flotes or machines till the pier is built the whole is then gently let down to the bottom which must be made level for the purpose But of  these methods that of building in caissons is the best  But before the pier can be built in any man∣ner the ground at the bottom must be well secured and made quite good and safe if it be not so naturally The space must be bored into to try the consistence of the ground and if a good bottom of stone or firm gravel clay c be met with within a moderate depth below the bed of the river the loose sand c must be removed and digged out to it and the foun∣dation laid on the firm bottom on a strong gra∣ting or base of timber made much broader every way than the pier that there may be the greater base to press on to prevent its being sunk But if a solid bottom cannot be found at a conve∣nient depth to dig to the space must then be driven full of strong piles whose tops must be sawed off level some feet below the bed of the water the sand having been previously digged out for that purpose and then the foundation on a grating of timber laid on their tops as before Or when the bottom is not good if it be made level and a strong grating of tim∣ber two three or four times as large as the base of the pier be made it will form a good base to bulid on its great size preventing it from sinking In driving the piles begin at the mid∣dle and proceed outwards all the way to the borders or margin the reason of which is that  if the outer ones were driven first the earth of the inner space would be thereby so jammed together as not to allow the inner piles to be driven And besides the piles immediately under the piers it is also very prudent to drive in a single double or triple row of them around and close to the frame of the foundation cutting them off a little above it to secure it from slipping aside out of its place and to bind the ground under the pier the firmer For as the safety of the whole bridge depends on the foun∣dation too much care cannot be used to have the bottom made quite secure  JETTEE the border made around the stilts under a pier being the same with  Sterling  IMPOST is the part of the pier on which the feet of the arches stand or from which whey spring  KEYSTONE the middle voussoir or the arch stone in the top or immediately over the center of the arch The length of the keystone or thickness of the archivolt at top is allowed to be about th or th of the span by the best architects  ORTHOGRAPHY the elevation of a bridge or front view as seen at an infinite distance  PARAPET the breast wall made on the top of a bridge to prevent passengers from falling over In good bridges to build the parapet but a little part of its height close or solid and upon that a balustrade to above a man's height has an elegant effect  PIERS the walls built for the support of the arches and from which they spring as their bases  They ought to be built of large blocks of stone solid throughout and cramped together with iron which will make the whole as one solid stone Their faces or ends from the base up to highwater mark ought to project sharp out with a salient angle to divide the stream Or perhaps the bottom of the pier should be built flat or square up to about half the height of lowwater mark to allow a lodgment against it for the sand and mud to cover the founda∣tion lest by being left bare the water should in time undermine and so ruin or injure it The best form of the projection for dividing the stream is the triangle and the longer it is or the more acute the salient angle the better it will divide it and the less will the force of the water be against the pier but it may be suffi∣cient to make that angle a right one as it will make the work stronger and in that case the  perpendicular projection will be equal to half the breadth or thickness of the pier In rivers on which large heavy craft navigate and pass the arches it may perhaps be better to make the ends semicircular for although it does not di∣vide the water so well as the triangle it will both better turn off and bear the shock of the craft  The thickness of the piers ought to be such as will make them of weight or strength sufficient to support their interjacent arch independent of any other arches And then if the middle of the pier be run up to its full height the centering may be struck to be used in another arch before the hanches are filled up The whole theory of the piers may be seen in the third section  They ought to be made with a broad bottom on the foundation and gradually diminished in thickness by offsets up to lowwater mark  The methods of laying their foundations and building them up to the surface of the water are given under the word FOUNDATION  PILES are timbers driven into the bed of the river for various purposes and are either round square or flat like planks They may be of any wood which will not rot under water but oak and fir are mostly used especially the latter on account of its length streightness and  cheapness They are shod with a pointed iron at the bottom the better to penetrate into the ground and are bound with a strong iron band or ring at top to prevent them from being split by the violent strokes of the ram by which they are driven down  Piles are either used to build the foundations on or are driven about the pier as a border of defence or to support the centers on and in this case when the centering is removed they must either be drawn up or sawed off very low under water but it is perhaps better to saw them off and leave them sticking in the bot∣tom lest the drawing of them out should loosen the ground about the foundation of the pier Those to build on are either such as are cut off by the bottom of the water or rather a few feet within the bed of the river or else such as are cut off at lowwater mark and then they are called stilts Those to form borders of defence are rows driven in close by the frame of a foundation to keep it firm or else they are to form a case or jettee about stilts to keep within it the stones that are thrown in to fill it up in this case the piles are grooved driven at a little distance from each other and plank piles let into the grooves between them and driven down also till the whole space is sur∣rounded Besides using this for stilts it is also sometimes necessary to surround a stone pier  with a sterling or jettee and fill it up with stones to secure an injured pier from being still more damaged and the whole bridge ruined The piles to support the centers may also serve as a border of piling to secure the foundation cutting them off low enough after the center is removed  PILE DRIVER and engine for driving down the piles It consists of a large ram of iron sliding perpendicularly down between two guide posts which being lift up to the top of them and there let fall from a great height comes down upon the top of the pile with a violent blow It is worked either with men or horses and either with or without wheelwork That which was used at the building of Westminster bridge is perhaps the best ever invented  PITCH of an arch the perpendicular height from the spring or impost to the keystone  PLAN of any part as of the foundations or piers or superstructure is the orthographic projection of it on a plane paralled to the ho∣rizon  PUSH of any arch the same as drift shoot c  SALIENT ANGLE of a pier the projection of the end against the stream to divide it The rightlined angle best divides the stream and the more acute the better for that purpose but the right angle is generally used as making the best masonry A semicircular end though it does not divide the stream so well is sometimes better in large navigable rivers as it carries the craft the better off or bears their shocks the better  SHOOT of an arch the same as drift  SPRINGERS are the first or lowest stones of an arch being those at its feet bearing im∣mediately on the impost  STERLINGS or Jettees a kind of case made about a pier of stilts c to secure it and is particularly described under the next word  Stilts  STILTS a set of piles driven into the space intended for the pier whose tops being sawed level of about lowwater mark the pier is then raised on them This method was formerly used when the bottom of the river could not be laid dry and these stilts were surrounded at a few feet distance by a row of piles and planks c close to them like a cofferdam and called a sterling or jettee after which loose  stones c are thrown or poured down into the space till it be filled up to the top by that means forming a kind of pier of rub∣ble or loose work and which is kept together by the sides or sterlings this is then paved level at the top and the arches turned upon it This method was formerly much used most of the large old bridges in England being e∣rected that way such as London bridge New∣castle bridge Rochester bridge c But the inconveniencies attending it are so great that it is now quite exploded and disused for be∣cause of the loose composition of the piers they must be made very large or broad or else the arch would push them over and rush down as soon as the center was drawn which great breadth of piers and sterlings so much contracts the passage of the water as not only very much incommodes the navigation through the arch from the fall and quick motion of the water but from the same cause also the bridge itself is in much danger especially in time of floods when the water is too much for the passage Add to this that besides the danger there is of the pier bursting out the sterlings they are also subject to much decay and damage by the velocity of the water and the craft
