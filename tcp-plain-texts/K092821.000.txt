 JUSTIFICATION BY  CHRIST  alone A Fountain of Life and Comfort DECLARING That the whole Work of Man's Salvation was accomplished by JESUS CHRIST upon the Cross in that he took away and healed all his from all Sins and presented them to God holy without Fault in his Sight  By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities  Isa liii  Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scriptures might be fulfilled he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost  John xix  In the body of his flesh through death to make you holy and unblameable and without fault in his sight  Col xxi  Being justified by his blood  Rom v  Thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee  Cant  Written by  SAMUEL RICHARDSON  In the Year  LONDON  Printed by JOHN HART in  Popping'sCourt Fleetstreet  and sold by J LEWIS in  BartholomewClose  near  WestSmithfield  and at the  Tabernacle  MDCCXLV  To the Reader  THE point here insisted on is of the greatest moment tho' the least regarded or rightly understood Many think they truly know it when they have but crude carnal indigested notions of the same which dead faith not purifying their conscience and giving true peace they are obliged to support by past experience frames feelings or works and when they hear those who spiritually understand the mystery of  Christ  talk of living upon  Christ  and being perfectly holy by  faith only  without these things they imagine we mean to rest contented with such a faith as theirs namely that  Christ  has died to ward off the wrath of God to purchase his favour and as an effect of that to obtain certain inherent qualities and dispositions  c  to make us  meet  for the kingdom of heaven was  this  our faith it would be certainly requisite to seek after  this sort  of sanctification and not be at rest without we felt something of it But on the contrary we believe that the bloodshed upon the cross was the  very  attonement and that  that  blood has purged put away and blotted out all our sins and that then there was an everlasting righteousness brought in by believing which our hearts and consciences are made as perfectly clean as tho' we had never sinned in  this  consists true purity of soul and  not  in habitual qualities and whoso are  thus  made pure and perfect have fellowship with God have the Holy Ghost have constant peace and are deliver'd from the dominion of sin They do also bear forth the fruits of righteousness not in order to become  more  holy either in the sight of God or in their own consciences but because they  are  perfectly holy through faith and  a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit    'Tis true we have still the vile sinful body which continually disposes the mind to evil but the blood of  Jesus  by purifying the conscience makes  us free from sin  and as it were destroys the connexion I would therefore recommend this little piece to the consideration those who desire to walk in the  highway of holiness  and remain theirs to serve in the  Lord Jesus Christ    WILLIAM CUDWORTH  JUSTIFICATION BY  CHRIST  alone  Unto him that hath loved us and washed away our sins in his own blood  Rev i  THese words contain the virtue fruit and effectualness of Christ's death and the benefit privilege and happiness of the sons of God by it  In these words we are to consider The persons whose sins Christ  washed away  and they were all those who  were given to Christ John  What is he that  washed their sins away  and that is the Lord Jesus Christ ver How and by what means he washed them away and that was with his blood It is ascribed to his blood because  Without blood there is no remission Heb    Question  Did Christ's blood as blood simply so consider'd effect this work  Answer  No there is something else included in it as appears  The blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offer'd himself without spot to God  Heb  The word was God the word took flesh  John Christ who is God by taking flesh united the elect by his flesh to himself and so became one with God as God and Christ are one  John  So that the flesh of Christ became in an unspeakable manner one with the perfection of the divine and infinite being which was the life and substance of all which lay hid under  This vail that is to say his flesh    Heb So that by the power of his divine nature he might make satisfaction in and by the human and by reason of this union there was an infinite value and worth in Christ's blood therefore it is called  The precious blood of Christ  Pet yea  the blood of God  Acts So that we may not  know Christ  simply  after the flesh  but in the flesh and in the spirit together  Cor  The time when he washed their sins away which was then when he shed his blood for in his blood they were washed away Christ's blood and their sins went away together The ground and cause why he took their sin away was his love which was in himself nothing in us or done by us could move him to die for us  The sum of all is that Jesus Christ by once offering the sacrifice of himself when he was upon the cross he took away put to an end blotted out and utterly destroyed all the sins of his people for ever and presented them just righteous and holy without spot before God  This will appear to be true if ye consider these several reasons which are proved by plain scriptures  Because that was the time which Christ was to do this work in  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish the transgressions and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy And after threescore and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off but not for himself And he shall confirm the covenant with many c  Dan Which time was at an end when Christ died therefore it is said  The year of my redeemed is come  Isa Yea  the hour is come saith Christ  John  Because Christ was ordained of God to take away sins and to present us holy  Who verily was fore ordained to redeem us with his precious blood  Pet  For he hath made him to be sin for us that knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him  Cor  Who of God is made unto us wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption  Cor  Because Christ was mighty to save Therefore he  did do this work himself alone  Who is this that cometh from Edom with dy'd garments from Bozrah that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the greatness of his strength I that speak in righteousness mighty to save I have trodden the wine press alone and of the people there was none with me I looked and there was none to help therefore my own arm brought salvation unto me  Isa So that Christ did all this work alone for none else could help Then  thou spakest in a vision to thy holy One and said I have laid help upon one that is mighty  Psal  Because Christ took flesh on purpose to effect this work  Wherefore when he came into the world he said sacrifices and offerings thou wouldst not but a body thou hast prepar'd for me in burntofferings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure  Heb  It was the will of God that Christ should by the shedding his blood sanctify his by  the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus once for all  Heb to  Because Jesus Christ came on purpose to take away our sins  c Then said I lo I come to do thy will O God  Heb  He was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin  John  Once in the end of the world hath he appeared to take away sin by the sacrifice of himself  Heb  Because Jesus Christ was made a  curse  for  us  and suffer'd all the punishment due to us for sin  Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us  Gal  Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and afflicted He was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all He bare the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors  Isa  Because the scriptures saith he hath obtained eternal redemption for us  Having obtained eternal redemption for us  Heb  In whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins  â–ª Col Col  Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world  John And that he hath healed us  By whose stripes we are healed  Isa  Who his own self bare our sins in his own body by whose stripes we are healed  Pet  Because it was the promise of God that this work should prosper and that he should justify many by bearing their sins  When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles He shall not fail nor be discouraged till he hath set iudgment on the earth  Isa  c  See  Isa    My righteous servant shall justify many for he shall bear their iniquity  Isa Were these promises fulfilled concerning Christ or no Surely yea Then he hath justified his  Because else Christ had not answer'd the types under the law  Adam  was a type of Christ who was a publick person as Christ was and as truly the first  Adam  by one act made all that were in him sinners which was true enough so really and truly did Christ the second  Adam  by his own act  viz  the sacrifice of himself he made all that were in him righteous and that is as true see  Rom  to and  as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of One many are made righteous  And as by our natural birth we become personally sinners from our sinful root  Adam  so by our spiritual birth or believing we become personally righteous in our  righteous branch Christ  And as being conceived in sin  c  we bear forth sinful fruit in thought word and actions so by being personally righteous  in conscience by faith  we bear forth good fruit in thought word and actions  As by the first  Adam  condemnation came so by the righteousness of one came upon all unto justification of life The priest was a type of Christ who is said to  make attonement for you to cleanse you from all your sins before the Lord  Levit Christ by his death did present all his  people to God without spot or blemish or wrinkle  Ephes  In the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unreproveable in his sight  Col So then I hope they are free from all sin if the scripture saith truth as it doth  The live goat was a type of Christ upon whose  head all the transgressions of the children were laid who did bear them and carry them all away into a land not inhabited in the wilderness  Levit  Which were shadows of things to come but the body is Christ  Col  Because Christ did exceed all the priests and sacrifices under the law for  they could not make the comers thereunto perfect  But Christ the substance of those sacrifices hath made his perfect If those sacrifices could have purged them as Christ hath purged us they should have  no more conscience of sin  than we have that is none at all because we are for  ever  fully and freely set free being  perfected  Heb The priest  under the law  made many offerings and yet by all their offerings they could never take away one sin but Christ by one offering hath taken away all their sins for ever they stood daily ministring and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice which could never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for ever sat down at the right hand of God  Heb  to Oh what a difference is there betwixt them Christ hath wonderfully exceeded them therefore this priest this offering is more glorious and happy yea and all the elect are made happy by this perfect effectual glorious offering  Heb    Because there needs no more offerings for sin therefore sin is quite gone and remitted  Now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin  Heb because there needs none For this one of Christ is sufficient  Because there can be no more required to be done to make us just and righteous than Christ hath done for us he hath done all that he was required to do to take away sin therefore he hath done  Jesus knowing that all things were accomplished that the scriptures might be fulfilled  John Cor  Because if Christ had not fully accomplished what he came to do  viz  to make us just and righteous he would not have  ascended into heaven  as he did  This man after he had offered one sacrifice sate down at the right hand of God  Heb and  Because the scripture saith  We are justified by his blood  Which could not be true if he had not taken away and destroyed all our sins and  presented us to God without spot and made peace by the blood of his cross now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight  Col For this end  Christ gave himself for his church that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it might be holy without blemish  Ephes Therefore the scriptures say all our sins are  scattered removed cast behind his back Thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back  Isa  They are cast into the depth of the sea  Mich  As far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us  Psal This is something but this is not all they are  covered Whose sin is covered  Psal Yet the soul is not satisfied because a thing may have a being that is covered therefore God saith they are blotted out  I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sin  Isa This is more for now they are not they have no being But God can remember that which is not this is answered for God saith  I wiil not remember thy sins  Isa  I will remember their sins no more  Jer I hope now you are satisfied  Because they are holy and without spot Therefore Christ saith of his  Thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee  Song  My love my fair one  Song  They are without fault before the throne of God  Revel Now this could not have been if Christ had not  in the body of his flesh through death made them so holy and presented them so to God  As  Col    Eph    Because Christ saith that we are without sin we  may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world  Joh How is Christ I pray sure he is without sin for so saith the scriptures  In him is no sin  John Heb Thus we are now as we are in Christ in respect of his righteousness which is ours though it be in him I say this our perfection  and happiness is in respect of our justification and as we are in Christ for as we are in ourselves simply so considered though we were never out of Christ in our bodies in the flesh we are not capable of so great perfection in this Life for the Apostle saith  If any man saith he hath no sin he is a lyar and deceives himself  John But these Scriptures are all true therefore we are all  fair  without  fault  and  spot  and we are so as we are in Christ and so we were made all this by Christ when he died And seeing it must be true also that we have  sin  and do  sin  that is as we are in our flesh in our bodies and seeing we are so notwithstanding conversion and faith therefore our believing  c  hath not made us so perfect and therefore Christ upon his cross made us so and so presented us to God  Col    Because Christ did all that was needful to be done to make us perfect and present us holy For what can be more required to the justification of a sinner before God than to be free from all sin Is not he that is no sinner a righteous person must not he that is free from all sin of necessity appear just to him that knows he is so as God doth it is all one to be free from sin and to be perfectly righteous  Cor    John  there is no medium betwixt them  By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities  So that his bearing their iniquity was that which did justify them and by his knowledge he knew whose sins he bore  viz  whom he justified  Isa    Christ upon the cross did this work for us because the scripture saith  He hath washed away our sins in his own blood  Rev therefore they are done away Therefore to say that they are not done away is to contradict God in his word and very dishonourable to Jesus Christ that he should be  manifested to take away our sins  John that Christ should come to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins  c Dan    Cor  and yet this work is still to do What is this but to say Christ came not to do it or if he came  to do it he did not do it for he did it not if it be still to do  Because Christ saith this work is finished therefore it is so for he is the  faithful and true witness  therefore we may believe it and affirm it is done  These words spake Jesus I have glorified thee on earth I have finished the work thou gavest me to do Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost  John and to The work God gave Christ to do was the work of our salvation which consisted in taking and destroying our sins and presenting us holy without spot to God and this he did by being  made sin us that so we might be made  being made sin for us  the righteousness of God in him  Cor  Therefore if when Christ died that was the time this was to be done and if Christ was ordained to do it if Christ was mighty to save if Christ took flesh to do this work if it was the will of God that he should do it if Christ came on purpose to do it if our sins were laid upon Christ and he suffered the punishment the curse of them if he hath redeemed us if it was prophesied of him that he should justify many and that his work should prosper if Christ did answer his types if he hath exceeded all the priests and sacrifices under the law if there needs no more offerings for sin if Christ hath done all the law required if Christ hath done what he came to do if we are justified by his blood if he hath made us holy and presented us without spot if we are free from all sin if Christ hath done all that can be done to make us just and righteous if Christ did wash away our sins in his own blood if Christ hath said It is finished then it's done it's done it's done perfectly and compleatly done and then what I have said is fully proved namely that Jesus Christ by once offering the sacrifice of himself when he was on the cross put an end to sin and so destroyed all the sins of his people for ever and presented them just righteous and holy without spot  c  before God  Col    Col    Oh what a fountain of consolation is here what marrow and fatness is here what sweetness is like to this to all that believe who now may say once sin was mine then it was laid upon Christ and now they are neither mine nor his because they are not at all for by his blood  he washed them all away  and now they are all gone blotted out and shall be remembred no more no more no more Now Christ's righteousness is mine as well as his for I was  made the righteousness of God in him  Cor And I did nothing at all to procure these things to me in this appears free grace here is Christ and Christ alone and nothing but Christ all things else pass away because they are  under the sun  Eccles they are full of mutation and change Faith may be obscured and the soul greatly deserted so as to see  no light  Isa yet when at the worst they need not be comfortless  John  for still  God is their God  and their  lives are hid with Christ in God  Col  Who is the same to day yesterday and for ever  Heb We change oft but he  never changeth  Mal In this is our happiness comfort and glory and even then when we cannot apprehend him yet were we  in him  Ephes and we are and ever shall be in him and  one with him  and are comprehended of him  John    Because I live  saith Christ  ye shall live also  John What doctrine in religion is more sweet and comfortable more necessary or profitable yea or more honourable to the Lord Jesus Christ This is that which holds forth the love of God that sets the crown upon his head and will  not give his glory to another  Isa Jer This will have Christ to be  our life  Col  peace  Ephes  glory  Isa This is that that thrust us out of ourselves our life our  righteousness  Rom Tit to his to live in him and caused us to say  O Lord thou art our righteousness  Ezra  The Lord our righteousness  which life is most sweet and serviceable because this is sure and mo  spiritual In a word this makes Christ  all in all  Col  and  exalts him  above all which is his place  Psal  And surely that which is the  life  of our souls that upon which the eternal happiness of our souls depends is not in any thing in us but that is  Christ in him  Cor  Cor  it lies in him that so it may be kept safe for us And that we might not live upon any thing within us faith is given that by it we may live out of ourselves in another even the Lord Jesus where  our life is  Col Surely if our life and happiness had been infused in us we should have lived in our selves and not upon God  Adam  had his life in him and he lost it therefore it's better for us that  our life is hid in Christ in God  Col  This is comfortable indeed as God saith  Comfort ye my people speak comfortably unto her tell her that her warfare is accomplish'd and her iniquity is pardoned  c  Isa    This is good news from heaven indeed that this great work is finished it is not now to do neither for faith nor thee Oh see that ye add not nor detract from it if thou beest Christ's  i e  if thou believest it is thine apply it take comfort in it admire God's love free grace give God all the glory of it give none of it to faith nor to any thing else rejoice in God and thy union with him witness to his truth and suffer for him serve and love and live and die with him and his  Many having a notion in this day of being justified by a faith which is sometime out of exercise I would recommend to their consideration a few questions of this author's in his answers to some objections against this doctrine    Whether saith in the nature and power of it unacted do justify or no if yea I desire to know how the power to believe apart from the exercise of it can be known to us    How it may fitly be called saith when there is no believing as there is not without the act seeing faith and to believe is one thing and whether the same light and power c be not the same power by which we obey the rest of God's commands and if it be how you can distinguish it apart from its act and if it justifies as it is a grace unacted can you tell how and when you were justified and if it may abide in the soul one hour and not act why not two and so two seven years and whether then this opinion doth not imply that a man may have faith in him and be justified by it and yet he never believe nor know it  FINIS
