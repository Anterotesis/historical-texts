Drurylane  as she chuses to submit Faults which are really her own to the Judgment of the World rather than be accused of those which she never committed  PROLOGUE TO THE MINIATURE PICTURE  WRITTEN BY RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN  Esq  Spoken by Mr KING  CHILL'D by rude gales while yet reluctant May  Withholds the beauties of the vernal day  As some fond maid whom matron frowns reprove  Suspends the smile her heart devotes to love  The season's pleasures too delay their hour  And Winter revels with protracted pow'r  Then blame not Critics if thus late we bring  A Winter's Dramabut reproachthe Spring  What prudent Cit dares yet the season trust  Bask in his whisky and enjoy the dust  Hous'd in Cheapside scarce yet the gayer spark  Atchieves the Sunday triumph of the Park  Scarce yet you see him dreading to be late  Scour the NewRoad and dash thro' Grosvenorgate  Anxiousand fearful toohis steed to show  The hack'd Bucephalus of Rottenrow  Careless he seems yet vigilantly sly  Wooes the stray glance of ladies passing by  While his offheel insidiously aside  Provokes the caper which he seems to chide  Scarce rural Kensington due honour gains  The vulgar verdure of her walk remains  Where whiterob'd misses amble two by two  Nodding to booted beaux"how' do how' do"  With gen'rous questions that no answer wait  "How vastly full A'n't you come vastly late  "Is'n't it quite charming When do you leave town  "A'n't you quite tir'd Pray can we set you down"  These suburb pleasures of a London May  Imperfect yet we hail the cold delay  But if this plea's denied in our excuse  Another still remains you can't refuse  It is a Lady writesand harka Noble Muse  But see a critic starting from his bench  "A noble author" Yes Sir but the Play's not  French    Yet if it were no blame on us could fall  For we you know must follow Fashion's call  And true it is things lately were  en traine  To woo the Gallic Muse at Drurylane  Not to import a troop of Foreign elves  But treat you with French Actorsin ourselves  A Friend we had who vow'd he'd make us speak  Pure flippant French  by contractin a week  Told us 'twas time to study what was good  Polish and leave off being understood  That crouded audiences we thus might bring  To Monsieur Parsons and Chevalier King  Or should the Vulgars grumble now and then  The Prompter might translatefor Country Gentlemen  Straight all subscrib'dKings Gods Mutes Singer Actor  A Flanders Figuredancer our Contractor  But here I grieve to own tho't be to you  He actede'en as most Contractors do  Sold what he never dealt in and th' amount  Being first discharg'd submitted his account  And what th' event their industry was such  Dodd  spoke good Flemish  Bannister  bad Dutch  Then the rogue told us with insulting ease  So it was Foreign it was sure to please  Beaux Witsapplaud as Fashion should commend  And Misses laughto seem to understand  So from each clime our soil may something gain  Manhood from Rome and sprightliness from Spain  Some  Russian Roscius  next delight the age  And a  Dutch Heinel  skate along the stage  Exotic fopperies hail whose flatt'ring smile  Supplants the Sterner Virtues of our Isle  Thus while with Chinese firs and Indian pines  Our nurs'ries swarm the British Oak declines  Yet vain our Muse's fearno Foreign laws  We dread while native beauty pleads our cause  While you too judge whose smiles are honours higher  Than verse should gain but where those eyes inspire  But if the men presume your pow'r to awe  Retort their churlish Senatorial law  This is your Houseand movethe gentlemen withdraw  Then they may vote with envy never ceasing  Your Influence has encreas'd and is encreasing  But there I trust the resolution's finish'd  Sure none will say  It ought to be diminish'd  EPILOGUE  Written by Mr JEKYLL  Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON  THE men like tyrants of the Turkish kind  Have long our sex's energy confin'd  In fulldress black and bows and solemn stalk  Have long monopoliz'd the Prologue's walk  But still the flippant Epilogue was our's  It ask'd for gay support the female powr's  It ask'd a flirting air coquet and free  And so to murder it they fix'd 'on me'  Much they mistake my talentsI was born  To tell in sobs and sighs some tale forlorn  To wet my handkerchief with Juliet's woes  Or tune to Shore's despair my 'tragic nose'  Yes Gentlemen in education's spite  You still shall find that we can read and write  Like you can swell a debt or a debate  Can quit the cardtable to steer the State  And bid our BelleAssemblee's Rhet'ric flow  To drown your dull declaimers at Soho  Methinks e'en now I hear my sex's tongues  The sweet smart melody of female lungs  The storm of Question the Division calm  With "hear her hear her Mrs Speaker Ma'am  "Oh Order Order Kates and Susans rise  And Marg'ret moves and Tabitha replies  Look to the CampCoxheath and Warley Common  Supplied at least for ev'ry tent a woman  The cartridge paper wrapt the billetdoux  The rear and picquet form'd the rendezvous  The drum's stern rattle shook the nuptial bedd  The knapsack pillow'd 'Lady Sturgeon's' hea  Love was the watchword till the morning fife  Rous'd the tame Major and his warlike wife  Look to the Stagetonight's example draws  A female dramatist to grace the cause  So fade the triumphs of presumptuous man  And would you Ladies but complete my plan  Here should ye sign some patriot petition  To mend our constitutional condition  The men invade our rights the mimic elves  'Lisp and nickname God's creatures' like ourselves  Rouge more than we do simper flounce and fret  And they 'coquet good Gods how they coquet  They too are coy and monstrous to relate  Their's is the coyness in a 'tête a tête'  Yes Ladies yes "I could a tale unfold'  'Wou'd harrow up your'cushions were it told  Part 'your combined curls and freeze' pomatum  At griefs and grievances as I could state 'em  But 'such eternal blazon must not' speak  Besides the house adjourns some day next week  This fair 'Committee' shall detail the rest  Then let the monsters if they dare 'Protest'  THE MINIATURE PICTURE  ACT I  SCENE I  Mr  Camply  's Study  Mr  Camply  writing Servant knocks at the Door  Mr CAMPLY  COME in  Enter Servant  Sir here is a young gentleman come to wait upon you says his Name is Revel I think  Mr CAMPLY  Revel  lays down his pen and rises  Revel ha Sir Harry Revel perhaps desire him to walk in  exit servant  I have not seen him since he was ten years old his father was the worthiest  of men and I must return some of the attention he bestowed on me to his son    Enter  Eliza Camply  dressed in a baronet's gown and cap bows affectedly several times then salutes her brother à la Françoise puts her cap up to her mouth to hide her laughing and pretends to cough    Mr CAMPLY  Sir Harry Revel I believe I did not know that you were come to the university or I should certainly have waited upon you first but you will easily dispense with ceremony for as you have been partly educated abroad the formalities of an English college must appear rather strange to you  ELIZA  interrupting  Yes faith strange enough and all the old fogrums with their faces as starch'd and as prim as their bandswhy we all move by clockwork au pied de la lettre indeed my good sir for the clock directs all our motions  Mr CAMPLY  I fancy my good cousin is a great puppy  Aside  The melancholy event of your good father's death must make every place appear dull to you Sir Harry but I hope a change of scene and the attentions of your family  ELIZA  Family attentions and family affairs are equally my aversion cousinand really the queer fancy of my father's ordering me to Oxford in his will after I had been for three years at an academy in  France is such an outoftheway thing that I am half comforted for his death by it already  Mr CAMPLY  Indeed Sir Harry  ELIZA  Besides cousin ten thousand a year a title and a pretty wife are comforts that  Mr CAMPLY  Are you married Sir Harry  ELIZA  O no not yet but I shall be in a short time Apropos as I must soon leave this country for a little time while I go to see the old mansion I must beg you will give me two or three franks for my intended  Mr CAMPLY  Does she inhabit this country then Sir What a giddy mortal  Aside  Eliza  going up to one side of the table lays down the franks sits down her brother goes and fits in the chair he first rose from on the other    Yes Sir only Miss Loveless you knowhere  Mr CAMPLY  Loveless Miss Loveless    Embarrassed takes up and lays down a pen  ELIZA  Yes cousinWhat makes you stare so Because the lady has had sense enough to refuse all the squires of Oxfordshire is that any reason why she should not accept of me  Mr CAMPLY  A vain wretch  aside and affects a laugh  Oh nonono I give you joy Sir Harry I think you are well fitted to each other But are you sure Sir it is the same Miss Loveless I mean  ELIZA  I cannot possibly guess what Miss Loveless may run in your head but I mean the great heiress Miss Loveless who lives here in Oxford  Mr CAMPLY  Indeed  ELIZA  Indeed and what of that    Takes snuff affectedly  Mr CAMPLY    Affects to laugh  O nothing at all nothing at all  ELIZA    Flings herself back in her chair laughing  Ha ha ha my dear brother ha ha I shall die ha ha I shall die at your poor disconcerted visage ha ha  Mr CAMPLY    Rises and goes up to her  My sister as I hope to live why my dear Bess what whim now When we parted at breakfast your eyes were red and your spirits were gone I thought at dinner to have seen you the same sighing melancholy creature and here you are all life and spirits and in breeches too What does all this mean explain explain my little Oxonian    They come forward  Eliza  leaning on his shoulder  ELIZA  Not all life and spirits neither my dear brother you know I have not seen Belvil this weekwe have quarrelled  Mr CAMPLY  I suspected as much but I would not ask Pray what could you quarrel about You told me you had given him your picture and that he intended to make a demand in form to me  ELIZA  All this was true but for all this I have not seen him this weekheigh ho and I really fear I shall never see him as my lover again  Mr CAMPLY  How then you really love him my poor Bess  ELIZA  My dear brother indeed I do it is that and your being in love too that has made me put on this dress  Mr CAMPLY  Me you dream I in love I ridiculous what could make you take that into your head  ELIZA    Shaking her head  O my good Sir all your coldness and indifference cannot impose upon me that animal that Belvil has taught my heart to read into the hearts of others  Mr CAMPLY  Well and what knowledge do you get from mine  ELIZA  Why I have read that you are deeply aye deeply in love with that weathercock Flirtilla Loveless  Mr CAMPLY  Poh poh nonsense  ELIZA  Very good sense for it is true  Mr CAMPLY  Supposing it is true what is that to your quarrel with Belvil  ELIZA  Why this dress shall reconcile me to him that is if he deserves it and make Miss Loveless fling herself at your head or at your feet or  Mr CAMPLY  Into the river sooner I really do not understand you  ELIZA  You know she has flirted with and refus'd half the country the only two persons who have not sacrificed their time or inclinations to her coquetry are you and Belvil Now I think she likes you  Mr CAMPLY  O that is quite impossiblefor I never speak to her  ELIZA  So much the better nothing piques a coquet like your obstinate silence Brother pray let me ask you one question if you do not feel afraid of her why should you not speak to her  Mr CAMPLY  Why whypoh what a question I'll tell you Betsy I like her too well to permit her to exercise her power over me she is so handsome and so capricious that she would pretend to like me for one day send me to the devil the next and laugh at me for loving her all the rest of her life  ELIZA  I have not visited her these six years because I saw you avoided her but her repeated refusals convince me she likes some one and that you are that one her blushes whenever you are named sufficiently explain  Mr CAMPLY  That may be pride hurt  ELIZA  Aye aye pride to be sure  Mr CAMPLY  Well but Belvil and youI am all impatience  ELIZA  He saidit was yesterday se'en night he saidMiss Loveless was prodigiously handsome and very agreeable Why no quoth your foolish sister no quoth that creatureNo she is very witty I observed that she was a great flirt and that if I married him he should never speak to her He said that was very silly I grew angry he laugh'd me into a passion and my passion sent him out of the house  Mr CAMPLY  This was all foolish enough and then you were sorryhey  Eliza  sighs  Did he take your picture with him  ELIZA  O yes he had it hung about his neck but that is not the worst part of the story I find he has been ever since with Miss Loveless six days with that odious flirtilla Now as I could deceive you I am certain of improving upon them as Sir Harry Revel then will I go there make violent love to her rout Belvil humble her vanity and when I have deprived her of her whole train of admirers and her airs I will offer you as a  Mr CAMPLY  Heyday sister not so fast when it is time I can offer myself but I do not approve of your going unless the aunt is in the plot  ELIZA  I have wrote to her she disapproves much of her niece's conduct and is very glad to enter into any scheme that is likely to alter it Come do not look so gravewish me success and Belvil true  Going returns  Pray contrive to make Belvil believe I am gone to London if he should call  Mr CAMPLY  I will    Exit  Eliza  I wish her success indeed if she can get the better of that intolerable spirit of coquetry and love of admiration that so entirely possesses Miss Loveless I shall fling myself at her feet and think myself too happy to secure her peace of mind and honour for ever    Is going but is met by  Eliza  ELIZA  Brother here is Mrs Arabella Loveless but lord Mackgrinnon is with her therefore pray contrive to call him out of the way  Mr CAMPLY  I will    Servant announces Mrs  Arabella  and lord  Macgrinnon  Give me leave to present my cousin Sir Harry Revel to you and my lord I must beg the favour of you as you have been some time at Oxford to introduce him to your societies  Lord MACGRINNON    Mr  Camply  and Mrs  Arabella  talk apart  I shall be very happy to make him acquainted with some of the most learned and discreet gentlemen of the different colleges particularly with my worthy friends at Baliol he'll meet with good cheer as well as with cheerful and witty people and aw for nothing for I am at home wherever I go  ELIZA  That I dare say  Camply  pulls her by the elbow  I hate his northern dialect  Aside to her brother  O my lord every one must be glad when you do them the honour of making their houses your home  Bowing  Lord MACGRINNON  Aside  A pert sheeld I fancy  Bows  Mrs ARABELLA  Pray Mr Camply have you not built a new hothouse lately to tell you the truth my visit was partly to your new plants but chiefly to our new neighbour here as his worthy father was a particular friend of mine I wish'd to ask him some questions that  Mr CAMPLY  If lord Macgrinnon will take a walk round the shrubbery with me by the time we return I imagine your business with Sir Harry will be over  Lord MACGRINNON  I'll attend you with great pleasure    Exit  Mr Camply  and  lord Macgrinnon  ELIZA  How do you think my new character fits upon me Dear madam if under this disguise I can be of any service to you and find out Mr Belvil's way of thinking in regard to your niece I shall be too happy  ARABELLA  Smiling  As to Mr Belvil's way of thinking I dare be sworn my niece has no share in it  ELIZA  Indeed  Mrs ARABELLA  Yes indeed but my dear Miss Camply what am I to think of my niece she has given Mr Belvil just the same encouragement that every other suitor has met with Lord Macgrinnon too is upon her listand yet they seem all to be far from her heart  ELIZA  Smiling  Is there no one do you think that is near it  Mrs ARABELLA  O no if there was any particular person whom she meant to please she would not permit herself such universal coquetry  ELIZA  My dear Madam  Looking round  there's no man can hear me all women are born coquets and nothing but a great passion for one object can cure that natural propensity we all have to coquetry  Mrs ARABELLA  Surely good sense might cure it  ELIZA  Good sense good sense only strengthens the foible as it increases our power over mankindbut to our point is there no one among your niece's train of admirers whom you should wish her to prefer  Mrs ARABELLA  None Mr Belvil is not her loverlord Macgrinnon is a proud Scotchman who praises her beauty and talks of the delights of love from morning till night but I suspect his views are interested from the questions he has ask'd other people concerning her estate her money her plate her housesin short whatever his intentions are the secresy he involves them in bespeaks them to be of no good kind  ELIZA  Perhaps when Sir Harry Revel appears as a serious rival we shall find out his planbut madam do you think Miss Loveless hates my brother  Mrs ARABELLA  Would to heaven your brother did not dislike herhe would be a friend and protector to any woman that could please him  ELIZA  Then set your heart at rest about him I know he loves her though he disapproves of her conduct and if you will take the excuse of a fiddle tomorrow night to call in your neighbours by way of my brother's coming to your house as if it was a natural thing I will take care to bring matters to such a crisis that your niece shall be obliged to confess a preference to my brother if she feels it which I suspect  Mrs ARABELLA  You seem to be a connoisseur in the language of looks I that live with her never suspected as much  ELIZA  She never names him I dare say  Mrs ARABELLA  More than that I think she generally turns off the conversation when he is named you see Miss Camply this is a bad sign  ELIZA  An excellent one rather lord my dear madam you seem never to have taken the trouble of peeping into your own mind you are so perfectly unacquainted with that of our sex in generaland    Laughing  Mrs ARABELLA  I do not know which delights me most her philosophy or vivacity my ignorance proceeds not from my not searching into my own heart but that no one has taken the trouble of asking if I had one or not for you know Miss Camply I am an old maid    Laughing  ELIZA    Taking her hand  And so would I be one too if at your time of life that title would sit upon me with so much  goodhumour and dignityI think I hear my brother's voice at a distance remember that you are only to announce me as Sir Harry and persuade your niece that I Miss Camply am gone to London and that you will have a dance tomorrow night  Mrs ARABELLA  I shall certainly not forget any part of a scheme which is likely to join our families into one happy group  ELIZA    Kisses her hand  Your are an excellent being  Enter lord  Macgrinnon  and Mr  Camply  Mr CAMPLY  What making fine speeches cousin  Lord MACGRINNON  Not making love surely to such an antiquated gentlewoman  ELIZA    Aside to lord  Macgrinnon  Why not my lord  Lord MACGRINNON  I would no more squander my breath than I would my money unless I were to get cent per cent interest for it  ELIZA  I dare say not true Scottish oeconomyI hope not to reap a cent per cent interest there my lord but receive through other hands interest surpassing the principal  Lord MACGRINNON  Other hands he does not mean the niece sure he he what the niece hey  Mrs ARABELLA  Now Mr Camply may not I see these plants I mentioned  Mr CAMPLY  Certainly Gentlemen will you walk  ELIZA  We will follow you presently cousin    Exit Mr  Camply  and Mrs  Arabella  Lord MACGRINNON  How do you like the university Sir Harry  Sir HARRY  I don't know I suppose it is like all other universitieswe young fellows leave in them all the little learning we are ever possessed of and carry no sort of knowledge out of them which can be of any service to us during the rest of our liveshow should wewe drink portdrive stage coachesand laugh at the old DonsPshawPray my lord how do  you like  Miss Loveless is she not very handsome  Lord MACGRINNON  Handsome eneugh and trowth a believe what am teld o'her that she's gote aw the different pairts o' geud breeding at the best scheuls but one of her greatest accomplishments is her fortune  ELIZA  Pshaw dirt mere dirt my lord I have heard much of her high spirit and contempt for our sex  for women in generalEgad I like her for itWhat do you think my lord is likely to soften her into love beside ten thousand a year and a tolerable figure  Lord MACGRINNON  If he does mean to attack her I will mislead him  Aside  She has had so many fine speeches made to her that I believe nothing but neglect would move herI will make him behave quite rude to her and then she will hate him  Aside  Pretend not to see her tak na notice of her beauty rail against the whole sex and I'll warrant she's your awn  ELIZA    Seems to muse upon it  UmphIndeed  Lord MACGRINNON  And I will feed her vanity which in good truth as they say is her only weakness I woul cram it till it shall overflow all her gude sensetake this with you Sir Harry I believe she has a great deal of pride but na vanity at all na na vanity at all I think  ELIZA  That's a Scotch lie now he has some design in that  Aside  No vanity my lord why the world attribute vanity to her as the only shade to her perfectionsNow swear to your lie Sawney  Aside  Lord MACGRINNON  Upon my credit I never saw any thing like it pride she has and a great deal and my advice can only come from my desire of being of some sarvice to you  ELIZA    Bowing but laughs  Much obliged to you my lord have I not some reason to suspect your advice for I am told you are one of her lovers  Lord MACGRINNON  Mere jest or calumny Sir Harry na na na Macgrinnon ever married a woman that had na titleIndeed Miss Loveless's fortune might make a mon forget she was not noble if he might have it aw without any lawyers interfering but not me Sir Harry Na I will na be the first o' my family to set the example of marrying only a simple gentlewoman  ELIZA  So you think it would be very foolish for any one to marry without getting the fortune intirely into one's own hands  Lord MACGRINNON  Most surely and in truth Sir Harry women are come to such a pretty highflying pass nowadays that ruin and beggary are the only things that can keep a wife within the bounds of decency Why ye hear of nathing but divorces na I should  be sorry were I to give my name to any woman that if she chose to play the devil I must return one sixpence of her money for separate maintenance or that she should exact an allowance from meNa na Sir Harry keep the power and the pence together in your awn hands  ELIZA  And you would have my wife love me as the Indians worship the devil through fear  Lord MACGRINNON  Hey trowth I a' think fear is the strongest had we ha o' mankind or womankind  ELIZA  I must inform you my lord that I am perfectly acquainted with woman I judge of the whole sex by one whose mind I thoroughly possess  Lord MACGRINNON  Possess in trowth and suppose you do you possess a riddle that's aw a riddle na na Sir Harry womens' minds are weak guided by the impulse of the momenthere and there a flash of wit but na judgment  ELIZA  I could spit in his Scotch face  Aside  Lord MACGRINNON  Hey what may ye be muttering pray Sir  ELIZA  I say the whole sex are much obliged to your lordship I am quite of a different opinion my lord and as I was telling you if I was a woman myself I could not be better acquainted with the sex than I am and I imagine it is the unjust usurpation of all their natural rights and liberties which men are possessed of that makes our sexI say that makes women my lord women run into such errors  Lord MACGRINNON  Why if you was a woman yourself you could not plead better for them than you do  ELIZA  I love them all I respect I honour them  Lord MACGRINNON  I love them too but as to respect and honour    Shakes his head  ELIZA  In short my Lord if I succeed with Miss Loveless all the business I shall give her family will be to settle her whole fortune upon herself  Lord MACGRINNON  A downright feul  Aside  ELIZA  Entirely in her own power that she may feel totally independent of me and free as air that I may be certain nothing but her own heart and inclination gives me her time and attentions  Lord MACGRINNON  Aw that's mare than I intendsuch liberty as that may tempt herNa na Sir Harry you are quite wrong  ELIZA  Wrong or not such are my ideas and I shall follow them as fast as possible    Runs out  Lord MACGRINNON  And I shall follow you as fast as possible I hope at least he will take my advice in trying to pique her pride and make her so angry that I may gain time to get her consent and to make mine upon my own termsfor if once I have her fortune she may go and hang herself for what I care  End of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE  the Drawingroom in Miss  Loveless  's House  Mrs  Arabella  and Miss  Loveless  sitting on each side of a table upon which Mr  Belvil  is sitting with a book which he shuts and turning to Miss  Loveless  says    SO you do not admire this charming poem of Henry and Emma  Miss LOVELESS  No indeed that Emma

to the Aunt  SERVANT  From Mr Camply madam  Mrs ARABELLA    After having read the note  My dear I will return presently I will just go and answer this    Exit  Miss LOVELESS  What can that be    Rises and aside  BELVIL  Aside  A note from Camplyperhaps his sister has complained of me I am a silly puppy for here am I making love to a woman I do not care about and perhaps shall entangle myself in such a manner that I shall not know how to retreatwithout feeling the least pleasure in the pursuit too What a cursed fool  Miss LOVELESS    Approaches and taps him on the shoulder with her fan    What deep in thought Mr Belvil come I'll guess the subject of that reverie  BELVIL  My reveries can have but one subject and you must be too well acquainted with your own merit not to know it  Miss LOVELESS  Pshaw you are a flattererDo you know Mr Belvil that I am tempted nowandthen to believe that you are upon the point of turning politician  BELVIL  Pray why madam  Miss LOVELESS  Because you fall into such unaccountable reveries then I am sure you must be studying about some matters of importanceperhaps you are a patriot and are forming a new system of governmentLard there will be no bearing you if you turn reformer  BELVIL  Ha ha no indeed Miss Lovelesswhen I am perfectly satisfied with a reformation of my own private conduct I may then perhaps advise the community at largebut nowridiculousha ha    As he laughs Miss  Camply  's picture hangs out of his bosom  Miss LOVELESS  Ha what's that  BELVIL  What  Miss LOVELESS  A picture as I hope to live Why Mr Belvil this is a very odd fancy of yours never to have shewn me thatnay I insist upon seeing it  BELVIL  How unlucky  aside  O certainly  unties and gives it her  it is only a picture that I had given me one day in jokenothing seriousa jokehea jokehethat's all What an imprudent puppy I am  aside  Miss LOVELESS  A joke is that all O then I'll try him  aside  So it is only a joke  BELVIL  A joke that engrosses all my serious thoughts though  aside  Miss LOVELESS  Oh if you study your speeches I would not give one farthing for them  BELVIL  Remember that I only lend you that picture and that you must return it as soon as possiblePray compare that face with your own and imagine if possible you can that it can even be look'd at with patience except indeed to serve as a foil  Miss LOVELESS  I'll try him  aside  Well now I protest it is prettier than I thought I will keep it with your leave to examine the beauty at leisure as you are so indifferent about it I will put in my pocket  till I have an opportunity of comparing it with the original He looks confused  aside  BELVIL  How imprudent I have been  Forces a laugh  O certainlykeep itfling it awaydo just what you please with ithe he  Reenter the Aunt  Mrs ARABELLA  My dear niece Mr Camply's note was to inform me of the arrival of Sir Harry Revel at Oxford as Mr Camply and his sister are gone to London upon business they have desired me to shew their cousin some attention in order to dissipate his melancholy having just lost his father by whose death he gets ten thousand a year Pray Mr Belvil did you ever see him  BELVIL  Not since he was

bowing  Mrs ARABELLA  Well my dear has Mr Belvil made any proposals yet  Miss LOVELESS  Lard aunt the instant a man speaks to one you imagine he must propose  Mrs ARABELLA  I can tell you niece that your encouraging so many suitors without my hearing of any thing serious alarms me very much for the sake of your reputation there is my lord Macgrinnon who tells the whole world he is in love with you  Miss LOVELESS  And he tells me so too  Mrs ARABELLA  For shame niece I should have blush'd myself into a fever before I could have said such a thing And pray do not you know that Mr Belvil has even been attached to Miss Camply and yet you have suffered him to dangle after you for a whole weekI wish I knew his intentions  Miss LOVELESS  Indeed ma'am if you chuse to call me to an account for every foolish fellow that deserts country misses for me you will have enough to doWill you condemn me in the high court of your judgment because my charms monopolize the attentions of mankindReally

have been brought up with your cousin who is the most superlatively accomplished woman in the world if one may credit Mr Belvil's accounts of her  ELIZA  I suppose you have seen her and know there is nothing so very extraordinary about her Now for a description of myself  aside  Miss LOVELESS  Yes I have seen her but she blushes so much at every thing and at nothingand her countenance alters from one moment to another into such a variety of expressions that I really never could decide any thing about herI suppose Mr Belvil's passion for her was only a nursery prejudice  ELIZA  Now do I dread to have my questions answered  aside  His addresses to you are no secret in Camply's house I assure you and I thought my foolish cousin seem'd to look very grave upon the subjectbut I trust you have refused Mr Belvil's offers  Miss LOVELESS  His offersLard Sir Harry you are just like my aunt who fancies every dangler one has is to offer he has done every thing a respectful lover could do but offer but I suppose he will  ELIZA  Aye aye to be sure  aside  Heaven forbid  Miss LOVELESS  Yes he can't think seriously about Miss Camply  ELIZA  Why not pray  Miss LOVELESS  Why he has trusted her picture to me and that looks as if he did not care about her  ELIZA  It does indeed Pray let me see that picturepray compare that face with this portrait and see if there is the least chance of Eliza's making any conquest when you are near  Miss LOVELESS  For heaven's sake Sir Harry hide ithide ithere is Mr Belvil  Miss  Loveless  confus'd  GentlemenMr Belvil where is my auntI must find her

you get that  ELIZA  Why it was given me this moment by a fair lady and I intend to make use of it as a passport to the good graces of the lady who sat for it  BELVIL  I can hardly contain myself What shall I say to him  aside  ELIZA  Now do I die to know if it is myself or Miss Camply that he is so much disturbed about  aside  What is the matter Mr Belvil you look out of countenanceYou lookfaith I've hit it You look like the secretary of the waroffice when he receives the news of a defeat instead of a victoryor like Sir Tantivy on a frosty morning  BELVIL  Belvil  goes up to him  You may think yourself very witty Sir Harry but your mirth at  his voice trembles  at this time is the very height of cruelty  ELIZA  I could kiss him for that now  aside  Are you deaf man I say Miss Loveless gave me this and really I think it like Elizabut in her grave looks though  BELVIL  Then you are very well acquainted with Miss Loveless already  ELIZA  I could beat him with pleasure  aside  O yes

upon your not going Sir Harry that picture once was mine  ELIZA  The more fool you for parting with it  BELVIL  Part with it part with it I would as soon part with my life  ELIZA  Poh poh Mr Belvil it is quite ridiculous in you to appear so anxious about a picture which I repeat you have parted with so easily  BELVIL  No by that heaven that hears us I would as soon part with the original if I was possessed of herbut it was folly and imprudence that made me lend it to Miss Loveless and her giving it to you was greater folly still I do intreat you Sir Harry I beseech you shall I kneel to you for it what is there I will not do if you will make me easy by restoring it  ELIZA  Why did the girl give it you  BELVIL  Yes she did  ELIZA  She didfaith the girl is as great a simpleton as you are  BELVIL  Very angry  Very well Sir Harry the confession I have made gives you a right to upbraid me but tho' my heart is neatly broken by the consequences of my foolish conduct my spirit my spirit is not  ELIZA  Poor sighing swain  BELVIL  Hell and furies Sir Harry do you laugh at me  ELIZA  What would the man have you may marry my cousin if you like it  BELVIL  I never shall be so happy I should

ELIZA  Not so loud sir you crack the drum of my ear these country gentlemen are so robust You willthen by Jove you shall not have it for should she be cruel and not surrender I shall shew this picture to the whole world and swear she has and that will do as well  BELVIL  Then you are a villain  ELIZA  With all my spirit a rascal a coxcomb a puppy and you the worthy Mr Belvil But seriously now Bilvil you will be a lucky man to have such a gallant as myself to escort your wife aboutfor I shall appear in every public place with her close to her earalways at her elbowalways  BELVIL  This usage is not to be borne  ELIZA  Well    takes snuff and stares at him  BELVIL  Aside  What is there in that boy that quite unmans me  goes up to him  I expect Sir Harry that you will give me satisfaction  ELIZA  Oh sir I expect satisfaction likewise but this is not a proper place to shew our courage in Tomorrow if you please Mr Belvil if you will meet me at the end of the chesnuttree walk at seven o' clock we will decide this matter with any arms you please till then I keep the picture tomorrow the conqueror shall wear it  BELVIL  Bravely spoken Sir Harry with swords we will decide this point and if you fall I shall proclaim to the world that in your serious moments you are a contrast to your usual character which I must inform you Sir Harry is one of the most profligate and debauched I ever met with If you survive me all I ask of you is to justify me to your cousin it is to do justice to her honour that I expose my life  ELIZA  I'll answer for your justification  Aside  I die to undeceive him Well sir one of us will live to lay our laurels and our person at her feet  BELVIL  I have a serious affair to settle therefore I must leave you  going returns  Remember the hour  ELIZA  Yes yes    Exit  Belvil  Now I have sufficiently punished him I shall give him satisfaction but in a much pleasanter way than he expects Here is then at last returned to me the copy of a very foolish original and were the fate of it to be well described in a modern play I fancy it would teach many giddy girls like myself not to part with the one till the other was secured as fast as a lawyer and parson could bind it  End of the SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE  Miss  Loveless  's Garden  Miss  Loveless  crossing the stage meets Mr  Camply  and starts  Miss LOVELESS  HA he here  Aside  Mr CAMPLY

give a ball tonight the gravity of such a very sober creature as you are will quite discompose our dancing  Mr CAMPLY  Your aunt has done my sister and me the honour of inviting us and I hastened out of town on purpose to attend her commands  Miss LOVELESS  Her commands I suppose you mean to dance with her too I protest Mr Camply it will be quite edifying to see her like a true maid of honour  in queen Bess's days with her hands thusand footing it demurely soher eyes rivetted upon her feet all the time lest the left foot should take place improperly of the right  Mr CAMPLY  Ha ha ha charming I protest Now draw my picture  Miss LOVELESS  PshawHow in the name of wonder should I describe your dancing when the very sound of your voice is quite a new thing to me  Mr CAMPLY  Were I as vain as my cousin Sir Harry I should say that look'd like a reproach to me for not speaking to you before  Miss LOVELESS  Lard now do not apply general observations to particular peopleFor heaven's sake let us think of ourselves as little as we always have done  Mr CAMPLY  Yes yes I know you ever had much less regard for yourself than for any one else in the world  Miss LOVELESS  Myselfmyself again why did you ever think about myself  Mr CAMPLY  O no not at allnever neverHa ha ha I am quite diverted  Miss LOVELESS  At our raillery I suppose  aside  That is the most provoking laugh I ever heard I'll cure him of that affectation I'm determinedPray excuse me Mr Camply when I tell you that nature never intended you for raillery it sits upon you just as a veil and beads would sit upon me  Mr CAMPLY  Indeed if raillery is as proper for me as a convent is for you I should do nothing but laugh at my own jokes for the rest of my life Besides I think you would make a very pretty nun  Miss LOVELESS  You are quite mistaken Mr Camply for I could give you a proof that I have too much of the woman about me to make a saint of  Mr CAMPLY  A proof  Miss LOVELESS  Yes what do you think brings me into the garden at this time of the morning  Mr CAMPLY  Indeed I do not know  Miss LOVELESS  Why curiosity  Mr CAMPLY  Curiosity as I have none of that ingredient in my composition I do not desire to know what is the object of yours  Miss LOVELESS  Provoking indifference  aside  What do you think then of an appointment  Mr CAMPLY  I should be sorry to interrupt the smallest of your amusements and if I see right the object of them is too entertaining for my gravity to relish and so will take my leave  Going  Miss LOVELESS  O pray stay    Enter lord  Macgrinnon  Mr CAMPLY  My lord your servant    Exit

beauties and the birds make a concert to hail your charms while the very roses fade with envy at seeing themselves outdone  Miss LOVELESS  Stop stop my lord there is so much poetry in all that that it

the rest of our lives  Miss LOVELESS  The usual way of proposing in his country my lord is accompanied by settlements and the consent of ones parents  Lord MACGRINNON  Augh my dear Miss Loveless settlements and consents are not necessary between people that love nay marriage was invented only to bind the feuls and vulgar of both sexes but youyour mind like the soaring eagle despises all little game and should have no tie but your heart  Miss LOVELESS  What does the fool mean  Aside  Lord MACGRINNON  Your aunt does not want you come with me into Scotland and then we will conform to the odious custom of joining hands when our hearts are one believe the most ardent the most passionate the most faithful of lovers here will I be rivetted like a statue to the earth till you consent

likely  to get a partner this evening of a contrary sex to your own if you depend upon your humble Servant  H REVEL  Did you know the contents of this note Miss Camply  ELIZA  Yes Miss Loveless  Miss LOVELESS  Why then I must confess the same uncivil folly runs thro' the whole family it is downright nonsense  ELIZA  Well that is very odd for my cousin is reckoned very sensible almost as clever as myself  Miss LOVELESS  The girl's a downright fool  Aside  Well Miss Camply Mr Belvil will be here presently I shall dance with him  Enter  Belvil  BELVIL  Pardon me madam I am engaged to dance with Miss Camply  ELIZA  And I am engaged to Sir Harry  Miss LOVELESS  I fancy good people you mean to be witty in some way or other but as I do not understand how I must own I think the place you have chosen  to exhibit in makes it rather uncivil these jokes in my house are almost rude  ELIZA  Miss Loveless your head thus look down no up yesaye that will doDo you recollect such a scene  Miss LOVELESS  Intolerable that puppy has given her an account of my behaviour  ELIZA  My cousin is very justly vain of your encouragement Miss Loveless and I thank you in his name for your great condescension  Miss LOVELESS  Miss Camply this is not to be borne do you mean to affront me  ELIZA  No if I could not affront you when a man I am sure my female character cannot offend  Miss LOVELESS  O heavens and were you Sir Harry Revel only to laugh at me grant me patience  She cries  ELIZA  No Miss Loveless not to laugh at you but to regain my own lover whom you had nearly stolen from me  BELVIL  Not that neither do not be offended Miss Loveless if I acknowledge that I had not the least serious intentions about you  Miss LOVELESS  What is there a combinationa plot to laugh at meI can tell you Miss Camply if my behaviour appeared extraordinary I think yours to the full as reprehensible to put me on a masculine habit and personate a man for the sake of an odious man  ELIZA  I never encouraged but that one odious man but you Miss Loveless have encouraged many  Miss LOVELESS  Can you stand tamely by and see me reproached in this manner  Mrs ARABELLA  Your conduct my dear deserves such reproaches  Miss LOVELESS  Why madam I shall be the ridicule of the country but I will not stay to bear itI wish you joy both of you of your intended match and I hope you will be as heartily tired of each other soon as I am of you at presentbut you shall not have the pleasure of seeing me mortifiedI shall go and live at Paris for the remainder of my life I  have an uncle that will let me live as privately as I please Pray madam make my excuses to the companysay I have got the headach say any thing and to morrow I'll go and leave you and all my follies behind me  Going enter Mr  Camply  Mr CAMPLY  Miss Loveless it is all my faultMy sister has treated you in this manner only to try you and if my whole life can atone for the moment of pain she has occasioned dispose of it I tremble for her answer  Aside  Miss LOVELESS  I am so amazed I shall faint  Mr  Camply  draws a chair and seats her in it  ELIZA  Puts a smelling bottle to her nose  Dear Miss Loveless my brother has been dying for you these three years pray forgive him he dares not kneel but I will for him  Miss LOVELESS  What am I to say to you you odd creature  ELIZA  to  Camply  Come child don't stand petrified like a statue I have said enough now speak for yourself  Mr CAMPLY  Miss Loveless dare I flatter myself you will hear my petition  Miss LOVELESS  No Mr Camply I am determined to go and will not make you so bad a present as that of my handbesides I like no one and not you certainly of all men in the world for had you liked me these three years you could not have kept it so secret  Mr CAMPLY  Then my sister has deceived me only to make me still more wretched than I wassheshepresumed youdid not hate me  ELIZA  Talks aside to the aunt and then comes forward  I am a presuming young woman indeed but I have good eyes and a feeling heart and I am sure you cannot be happy without each otherso therecomeyour handand yours  Miss LOVELESS  No I don't like him  Mr CAMPLY  No she hates me I see that  ELIZA  Oh you do not like him then Mrs Arabella what do you say upon this subject  Mrs ARABELLA  I say since my niece has pride enough to oppose her own happiness that she has owned to me that she likes Mr Camply  Miss LOVELESS  Why then aunt I do think you are much worse than Mr Belvil Miss Camply or her brother and therefore to be revenged I'll e'en stay and try to be happier than you all seem to beand now Mr Camply if upon farther acquaintance we do not change our minds we may follow the example of Mr Belvil and your sister  Mr CAMPLY  I thank you miss for my sister is soon to be married  ELIZA  O not this twelvemonthand as no one shall say I lead them into a scrape we will all four be married together and you as my elder brother must begin the dance  BELVIL  I shall endeavour to hasten the period for a twelvemonth seems an age  Miss LOVELESS  Enough of this now we are all agreed I will shew you a scene that may amuse you if you will follow me into the garden  SCENE  changes to the garden lord  Macgrinnon  peeping out of the arbour  The de'el surely tempted me to feex upon this neeghtfor I am wat to the skan  Enter  Susan  at one corner  Sir sir sir sir  Lord MACGRINNON  Augh are you there  She takes hold of his hand and as they are going enter  John  who pulls her  JOHN  I'll lady you with a vengeance Mrs Susan what man can't you be satisfied without my mistress  Lord MACGRINNON  Hoot hush mon your mistress chuses to go  JOHN  But I don't chuse it I tell you you sarpent you viper  Lord MACGRINNON  I never saw so rude a brute is this the way you treat your mistress fellow  JOHN  Fellow yourself why 'tis because she is my mistress that she shan't go with thee why if thee beest a lord thee beest only a manand as an Englishman I'm the best of the two and so you shall find me if you dare lay hold of her again  Lord MACGRINNON  He's certainly bewitch'dspeak to him sweet love  SUSAN  Why John  In a low voice  JOHN  Why zounds I could tear your ugly eyes out so I could  Sets down his lanthorn and beats him with a stick  theretherenow will you take my mistress  Lord MACGRINNON  Help help murder    The group of company appear at the end of the stage with servants and torches Mr  Camply  runs up to  John  and holds his arm    Mr CAMPLY  What is the matter my lord what is the matter  Lord MACGRINNON  Why Miss Loveless and I were going to take a walk together and that fellow is mad I believe for he will not let her do as she likes  Mr CAMPLY  Miss Loveless why my lord is this Miss Loveless you dream  Holds the lanthorn up to  Susan  's face  Lord MACGRINNON  Faithan uglier dream by halfwhat in the name of wonder can all this be  BEVIL  This is a fine evening my lord but you look disturb'd what is the matter  Lord MACGRINNON  Matter why all the plagues of Egypt I believe yes yes I am disturb'd and wet to the skin too so pray what do you talk of a fine evening for there has been a violent storm of rain  All the company laugh  Na na  Miss LOVELESS  I am much obliged to you my lord for your very kind intentions and love of my fortune I was so insensible of the nature of your affection that it is to me you are indebted for that shower of rain from yonder engine and for a beating into the bargain from honest John who thought it was his mistress you were going off with  JOHN  What and so you did not like him thenAh Susan Susan I've a month's mind never to be jealous again  SUSAN  Why you great jolterhead you did'st think I was going to run away don't ye know that nothing but gentlefolks run away with one another  JOHN  Well well say no more if ever I am jealous again I wish a frost may nip all the trees in the  garden odsnigs if Mr Camply had not come I believe in my heart I should have broke every bone in your skin my lord  Lord MACGRINNON  Thank ye I feel as if you had done it Never did any man of the family of Macgrinnon suffer such indignities as I have suffered from this company to be deluded by a woman is a trifle a man of sense will expect it but I canna help reflecting on the impertinencies the jeers and the sluicing that have been thrown at me without thinking that the happiness of my noble ancestors is disturbed by the unworthy treatment that has been offered to their lineal descendant    All the company laugh  Miss LOVELESS  Certainly nothing but his vanity could induce him to think that I was weak enough to comply with his request and now Miss Camply I will confess that I am much indebted to you for curing me of my ridiculous plan of conduct and I wish you may succeed in every thing you undertake as you have in this  ELIZA  Why mine was rather a bold scheme I must confess but if the rest of the company  bowing round  will forget what a very lively coxcomb I  have been I shall not repent of the pains I have taken to please every one  Ladies I trust you will adopt my plan  And only wear the dress to gain the man  FINIS  BOOKS printed for G RILEY  I The Third Edition price Two
