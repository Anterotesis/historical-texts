 OBSERVATIONS ON THE THREE FIRST VOLUMES OF THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY IN A FAMILIAR LETTER TO THE AUTHOR  RIEN N'EST BEAU QUE LE VRAI LE VRAI SEUL EST AIMABLE  BOILEAU  LONDON PRINTED FOR J STOCKDALE PICCADILLY AND R FAULDER IN NEW BONDSTREET MDCCLXXXII  These OBSERVATIONS printed in the size of Mr WARTONS HISTORY are extremely proper to be bound up with that celebrated work to which they will be found a very useful APPENDIX  OBSERVATIONS  c  To the Revd Mr WARTON  SIR  YOU will have no reason to be either alarmed or offended at a mode of address which every reader has a right to adopt The author of a book upon a subject designed for and attractive of public attention gives a general challenge If his facts and opinions stand the test of a fair and candid enquiry he is entitled to universal patronage and approbation if not contempt and oblivion should be his fate The "History of English Poetry" stands high in public estimation the subject is equally curious interesting and abstruse much very much of its success is undoubtedly to be ascribed to the opinion generally entertained of your veracity and care as a historian and upon an idea so universal so satisfactory and hitherto so undisturbed it may seem invidious not to have been content entirely to rely I however Sir am somewhat too restless in my enquiries too desirous of being able to judge for myself to be satisfyed either with a writers reputation or with the opinion of the world at least when I have it in my power to learn how deservedly that reputation has been acquired or how justly that opinion is formed In pursuit of these objects I have read and examined your great and important work with some degree of attention and accuracy and I now present you with the result of my enquiries the public disclosure of which will not I flatter myself either to you or your numerous readers prove an unacceptable service If in some few instances I may be thought to have betrayed a warmth of expression from which reputation so high abilities so uncommon and a profession so sacred ought to have been wholely exempt let me once for all observe that having no other object in view no other end to answer than truth and justice I neither wish nor intend to consider you otherwise than as author of the work in question Personal motives I cannot possibly have been influenced by and  utterly disavow And were you able to falsify every charge I have here brought against you whatever might be your severity I should kiss the rod with resignation and even pleasure as I assure you the satisfaction I should have experienced in finding your work entirely free from error would have been infinitely beyond any I can be supposed to feel in thus making myself the public instrument of its detection  VOL I  Preface  Page vi  That "some perhaps will be of opinion that these annals ought to have commenced with a view of Saxon poetry" is a very natural and judicious conjecture "The legitimate illustration of that jejune and intricate subject" would undoubtedly "have doubled 'your' labour" and required I fear a more profound and extensive erudition as well as a more penetrating judgement than were perhaps necessary for the aera whence you have thought proper to deduce this important history "That the Saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries that our Saxon poems are little more than religious rhapsodies and that scarce any compositions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan state  It may seem a very extraordinary idea in a Christian minister and who is not only the historian of poets but a poet hisself that these people could not have a poetical genius because they were not pagans and that religion and poetry are incompatible The notion however strange may yet in some degree be just The Saxons like many other nations really seem to have got very little "by the  swop  "  we will readyly allow because admitting the positions to be true they prove nothing they are perfectly harmless But "that the Saxon poetry has NO CONNECTION with the nature and purpose of 'your' PRESENT UNDERTAKING" is an assertion one may safely venture to say as new as it is illgrounded and full of mischief Though the great revolution produced by the Norman invaders effected "that signal change in our policy constitution and public manners" which has in its consequences "reached modern times" yet neither the Saxon people nor the Saxon tongue was thereby eradicated You Sir have sometimes been a blographer and did you ever find it necessary to commence the story of your hero at the th or th year of his age and to assert that the time of his birth and infancy had no connection with the story of his life because forsooth he was become a very different person when grown up and sent to college from what he was when born breeched and sent to school And yet one may well doubt whether such an apology would not have answered your purpose just as effectually in that case as your reason for declining to enter upon the state of  the Saxon poetry does in this The truth is that the origin and fundamental principles as well of our language as of our poetry are to be sought for among the remains of the Saxon literature  You admit this by the very first page of your history you doubtless perceived your inconsistency though you did not I suppose expect that any of your readers would do so  and he who shall tell us that the English and Saxon languages have not sort of connection with each other is either deceived hisself or finds it his interest to deceive othersby sheltering his own ignorance or inactivity under a formidable and laboured shew of difficulty and uselessness equally visionary delusive and pernicious  P viii  Whether you have gratifyed "the reader of taste" by your exertions on this subject I know not but of this I am confident that "the antiquarian" will have greater reason to be dissatisfyed with being perplexed or misled than to thank you for having engaged in a task for which it will appear you have been so little qualifyed  I shall pass by the two dissertations which precede your history without observation  You have somewhere observed that we have a kind of malicious pleasure in detecting the secret resources and petty thefts of a great writer and the remark is just and natural with respect to the pleasure which does not I trust so much result from malice as from a secret regard to truth and an indignant warmth at seeing the daw strut abroad in his stolen plumes Whatever may be the cause I shall in the course of this enquiry have many opportunities or proving the justice of the observation And firstly you will be pleased to take notice that the greatest and best part of your note  t  Dis I sign a  b  in which you with an equal parade of ingenuity and learning account for an interpolation by Geoffrey of Monmouth into his translation of the British history has been found to be almost literally  borrowed  from Mr Cartes preface to the first vol of his History of England I have likewise some little reason to suppose though I do not think worth my while to prove that you owe more obligation to Sheltons translation of Wottons View of Dr Hickeses Thesaurus than to the Thesaurus itsself  not that I think them altogether just and proper but because I find that a strict examination would require greater leisure and more intense application as well as a more frequent reference to the numerous and uncommon books there quoted many of which I have by the way much reason to suspect you never consulted nor even ever saw than I am at present either willing or able to devote to it I do not at the same time wish to detract from whatever merit you may have in this ingenious structure I onely desire the reader to be particularly cautious and distrustful as he wanders over these extensive regions of FABLE and ROMANCE One may however venture to assert that let your facts and reasonings in the first of these dissertations be ever so just yet will they by no means prove any thing like what you produce them forthe introduction of romantic fiction into Europe which is rather to be sought for in the history of the Gauls or other Celtic nations who were settled  in Europe some thousand years before you suppose the Goths to have arrived in this part of the world and had doubtless "a very sufficient stock of lies of their own growth  Tyrwhitt  versus  Warburton Supplement to Shakspeare i  " without being beholden to Asiatic adventurers  I shall not give myself the trouble to minute  every  inaccuracy I might discover in the citations you have introduced from the old metrical legends between your th and th page I take it for granted they are just as correct as I shall prove others to be which you have given from MSS in the Cotton and Harleian libraries many of which as one may easyly perceive by your method of quoting referring to or registering them you have certainly never seen  P  One cannot help taking notice of your frequent forewardness in determining the age of poetical compositions or the MSS which contain them In this page you produce a lovesong the oldest you can discover which you "would place before or about the year " This you cite from a MS appearing as you elsewhere  P  tell us to be of the handwriting of the reign of king Edward the first but  an Elegy upon his  DEATH which you have printed in another place  P  from this very MS might have served to shew you the absurdity of dating it in his LIFETIME The truth is the book evidently appears to have been written in the reign of his son and successor and there is not the least reason for concluding any poem in it to be much older than the year  The Revd Dr Percy now lord bishop of Dromore whose knowlege in these matters seems pretty much upon a level with your own has brought its age down so low as the reign of king Richard II  Reliques of Ancient Poetry ii  I cannot willingly dismiss this same lovesong without giving a specimen or two of the extreme correctness with which it is printed and the extreme propriety with which it is explained  "With lokkes lefliche and longe"  Lefliche  you say is "lively" and a most curious explanation to be sure it is The  lively locks  of a young lady Charming creature she must have been a perfect Medusa But possibly you mistook  lokkes  for  looks  and then we have the  lively and  long  looks  of the said fair one If this famous history of yours should have the great and unmerited good fortune to come to a second edition you will do well to subtract one fault by correcting  lively  to  lovely  and another by writing  lure lumes  instead of  bire limmes  for though old poetry may be the same thing to you sense or nonsense it may not be so to every one who is tempted to look into your book The great blank a few lines  further you may fill up with the little word  wes  but indeed you would do much better to get a fresh transcript as there are fifty other mistakes in the copy you have printed and all the rest of the extracts from this and every other MS throughout the volume and indeed the whole work are in the same predicament It would moreover be as well not to call the verses beginning "Hyrdmen hem hatieth ant vch mones hyne" a different ballad from that on the lawyers as had you inspected the MS instead of the catalogue you would have found both to be one and the same piece  P  We are here favoured with a satyrical ballad upon Richard king of the Romans brother to our Henry III preserved in the above MS which you in a note tell us you "had transcribed from the British Museum and written the explanations upon BEFORE 'you' knew that it was printed in the SECOND FIRST edition of Doctor Percy's Ballads"Now Mr Warton listen to me for a single moment and  "mark how a plain tale shall put you down"  Dr now Bp Percy in printing this song has taken some liberties with the orthography and language and where is the piece with which he has not taken such liberties in particular he has altered the word  cop  "Sire Simond de Montfort hath suore by ys  cop" i e  cap or head Thus in the ancient Erench romance of Girart de Vienne MS  Þ mon  cap  dist G men uoil gardar  which he did  not  understand to  fot  which it is to be supposed he  did  In this alteration and indeed throughout the whole poem YOU Mr Warton have followed him with a most literal and servile exactness Still however you might have escaped undetected and have pilfered "your ingenious friend and fellowlabourer" with safety but unluckyly his lordships accuracy being much of a piece with your own suffered him to omit a complete stanza which could not possibly have eluded the observation of a second copyist but I look in vain for it in YOUR different transcript However as it may be some small consolation to you in this unfortunate dilemma I will here give it you  Be þe luef be þe loht sire edward  You shalt ride sporeles o þy lyard  Al þe ryhte way to douere ward  Shalt þou never more breke foreward  And þat reweþ sore  Edward þou dudest ase a shreward  For soke þyn emes lore  Richard c  This omission of the ingenious prelate is the more astonishing not onely as the verse immediately follows what he has copyed but because Mr Wanley says in his catalogue that the song expressly mentions prince Edward which it onely does in this verse  At p is another poem the Elegy on Ed I from the Reliques but there too it  escaped you till just before the work went to the press that the Dr had printed it  Credat Judaeus Apella non ego    I shall make no remark on the obvious wonder of your forgetting the principal contents of a book from which you are continually quoting passagesas your own a favour indeed that many writers have to acknowlege beside his lordship of Dromore  P  "The king and ys conseil  radde  the stones for to fette"  Radde  you boldly say is  Rode  Writers who want in knowlege should abound in care Had you read three lines further you would have discovered that the king and his council did NOT  ride  It means  advised  P  No one I sincerely believe except yourself could have supposed for a moment that the name of HENGIST deserved the slightest attention in giving the etymology of the word STONEHENGEthan which nothing can be more simple and apparent as it is communicated by the word itsself  hanging stone  P  "In the reign of Henry the sixth we find a ballad stuck on the gates of the royal palace… This piece is preserved in the Ashmolean museum"  It is no ballad and the reference would have been just as easy and much more useful to Hearnes HEMINGI CHARTULARIUM p Whence I dare lay my life you had your information  P  "What maner schap with me so  ferd  "  Why  Lay  Fared  "Of elde avenaunt"  Not "I was then young and beautiful" but  of a fit age  It may not be improper once for all to warn the reader that you interpret every where at random and not because you perfectly understand but because you are entirely ignorant of the word you pretend to explain I must however do you the justice to except a variety of words to which you have affixed  the proper meanings where the merest schoolboy could not have been at a loss for them and for the multitude of really difficult ones which you have left untouched your readers owe you infinite obligations  P  Poor old Cotgrave is here attacked for what you call absurdly interpreting  mangoneau    magnel  in your text  an oldfashioned sling  You indeed say "it is a  catapult  or  battering ram  I observe that this ingenious explication is with many other blunders of greater and less consequence afterwards directed to be destroyed You should however have destroyed it yourself It would not surely be a sufficient atonement for the impudence or ignorance of a writer whose work was one continued mistake to direct his readers to  dele  the whole You will not however have many similar instances of hardship to complain of  " But pray Mr Warton who told you so or where did you learn that a  catapult  was the same thing as a  battering ram  Cotgrave undoubtedly knew a thousand million times more of the matter than you can do and to prove that you know nothing at all about it let me intreat you to read your own text you will there find that the  magnels  were to be used by people UPON the wall against those who came to assail it Was that the place and use of a  battering ram  The very passage shews Cotgrave to be right and his explanation is further confirmed by a line at p where though the word  magneles  is joined with  slinges  and evidently signifies something of the same nature you have the confidence to refer the reader to the above nonsense at p  P  "Danz Robert of Meltone"  "Sir Robert of Malton It appears from hence that he was born at  Malton  in  Lincolnshire  " And why not at Malton in  Yorkshire  or why indeed at any  Malton  There are still places called  Melton  But do you suppose that when a person is designed  of  such a place it is always an evidence he was  born  at it  P  "  Vuel  thing" "well good" P "  Vuel  thing" "Vile"  Such sensible people Mr Warton as yourself generally take care to be very consistent Is a  good  thing a  vile  one  P  "Before these expeditions into the East became fashionable the principal and leading subjects of the old fablers were the atchievements of king  Arthur with his knights of the round table and of Charlemagne with his twelve peers But in the romances written after the holy war a new set of champions of conquests and of countries were introduced Trebizonde took place of Rouncevalles and Godfrey of Bulloigne Solyman Nouraddin the caliphs the souldans and the cities of Aegypt and Syria became the favourite topics"  And now Mr Warton after this very sublime Eastern flight let me ask for I dare say many of your readers would be glad to know what time you are pleased to call the fashionable aera of the Crusade Was it when Godfrey captured Jerusalem in or when Richard I planted the English standard upon the walls of Acon in If the first you will I am afrayed be at a loss to produce a single romance upon the subject of king Arthur of Charlemagne or of Roncesvalles If the second then I am to enquire where a romance is to be found any way near that age or indeed of any other which treats of Trebizond independent of the history of Charlemagne and excepting perhaps a book or two of the acts of Godfrey and Baldwin where are these favourite romances of Solyman Nouraddin the caliphs the soldans Egypt and Syria which cut such a pompous figure in the above extract Shall I likewise give you the trouble to recollect your authority for making the whole body of the troubadours of Provence take up arms and follow their barons "in prodigious multitudes" to the conquest of Jerusalem That some few of these poets in the service and courts of princes should be permitted to accompany their lords to the crusade and that others of inferior rank might enter into and mix with the army may be and I fancy is very true but that a single province should at that or any other time contain such  prodigious multitudes  of itinerant minstrels is an assertion as hypothetic and insupportable as it is incredible and absurd It will moreover appear that the Provencal troubadours were then  i e  about the latter crusade for you fix upon neither and for some time after a respectable and superior description of men  P  "The elder Spanish romances have  professedly  more Arabian allusions than any other"Will you Mr Warton do us the favour to name a single one of those elder Spanish romances with  any  Arabian allusion I know you cannot Cervantes has indeed pretended that the author of Don Quixote was an Arabian And any person acquainted with the romantic books published about his own time  Historia de Don Rodrigo to Historia de las guerras civiles de Granada  c  will see the force and propriety of this piece of satyre Those critics and we know well enough who they are that supposed Spain to have learned the art of romancewriting from the Arabians and to have afterwards communicated it to the rest of Europe were unfortunately ignorant that this species of composition was every where cultivated and had been so for centuries before it is known to have even existed in Spain To prove that the Spaniards imitated the Moors and they have not a single romance  at least what WE mean by romance to be given in evidence upon the occasion it should first be made appear from better authority than the whimsical reveries of selfconceited hypothetics that those Arabians had any such performances among them Huet does  not  seem to favour any such system he uses the word  romance  with the greatest propriety and the  sophistry  and  ignorance  of that wouldhavebeen universal critic and there was never wanting either a fool to think or a parasite to call him so who undertook and pretended to correct him has been sufficiently  exposed  and  chastised  by one very well acquainted with the merits of both  Supplement to Shakspeare i    P  The Sowdan of Damascus is represented in the text as riding with great violence to attack king Richard and the romance says  "A FAUCON BRODE in honde he bare  "For he thought he wold thare  "Have slayne Rycharde with treasowne"  This  faucon brode  you most sagaciously interpret to be a BIRD wonderful geniusWhat had not the king to dread from an enemy so terribly accoutered "The Soldan continues this your admirable exposition is represented as meeting Richard with a  hawk  on his fist to shew indifference or a  contempt for his adversary  and that he came rather prepared for the CHACE than the COMBAT" And so you go on through a whole page and a long note to prove that other great men formerly carryed hawks on their fist but  never  as you very ingeniously conclude  going to battle  and yet the Soldan is here in the midst of an engagement and riding full speed to assail his antagonist with a FAULCON in not  on  his hand instead of a SABREThough such unparalleled ignorance such matchless effrontery is not Mr Warton in my humble opinion worthy of any thing but castigation or contempt yet should there be a single person beside yourself who can mistake the meaning of so plain so obvious a passage which I much suspect to have been corrupted in coming through your hands I shall beg leave to inform him that a FAUCON BRODE is nothing more or less than a BROAD FAUCHION  P  "With ffoxes tails mony aboute"  "In many knots" Clearly with many foxes tails about him  P  I stop here to acquaint you that ROBERT LE DIABLE is a  totally different personage  from ROBERT OF CICYLE I shall have a little more to say to you on your intimacy with these two gentlemen by and by  P  Pray Mr Warton shall I take the liberty to ask you in what "ROMANTIC HISTORY OF THE PALADINS" we shall find "William Ferrabras and his brethren sons of Tancred the Norman who acquired the signories of Apulia and Calabria about the year "  P  "It is well known that  anciently  England LADIES were  sheriffs  of  counties  " This is a circumstance of which you who seem to know so many strange things may be perfectly satisfyed Some of your readers though I imagine would have been equally obliged to you if you had condescended to produce an instance or two of the factbut that I am afrayed would have been somewhat difficult to compass  The hereditary sheriffdom of Westmoreland has been and may still be in a female and to this though it be nothing to the purpose you may perhaps mean to allude  P  "The metrical romance entitled La Le Mort Arthure…is supposed by the learned and accurate Wanley to be a translation from the French who adds that it is not perhaps older than the times of Henry the seventh But as it abounds with many Saxon words and SEEMS to be quoted in Syr Bevys I have given it a place here  That is before or about the time of king Edward II  "  The learning and accuracy of Mr Wanley had not however it should seem the power to convince you that a poem no older than the reign of Henry VII could not possibly belong to that of Edward II But it often indeed suits ones purpose best to be ignorant Mr Wanley says the writer of this romance "useth many Saxon or obsolete words" and Dr Percy observes that  it SEEMS to be quoted in Syr Bevis  your own expression which is as unlikely as it is untrue However to settle all differences upon the subject and you had certainly Mr Warton on these puzzling occasions better suffer yourself to be guided by so good a judge as Mr Wanley than being blind yourselt lead your blind readers into the ditch I can assure you that this same romance and one might have almost guessed it by the title is neither more nor less than a good part of CAXTONS  Prose Book  reduced into metre and neither is nor possibly can be older than the reign of Henry the seventh  P  "Chaucer mentions in Sir Topaz among others the romantic poems of SIR BLANDAMOURE Sir Libeaux and Sir Ippotis Of the former I find nothing more than the name occurring in SIR LIBEAUX" And do you Mr Warton  really  find the name there Dr Percy indeed says that the word  Blandamoure  suppose occurs in LIBEAUX and very modestly  observes "that 'tis possible Chaucers memory deceived him" But you Mr Warton will be pleased to mark that Chaucer does NOT mention SIR BLANDAMOURE the  title  is conferred by yourself  You have on this occasion I see been very liberal of your knightly favourshaving bestowed the same honour upon poor master  Ypotis  It would not be amiss to christen itthe  Order of Ignorance  he onely names Syr Libeaus and  Pleindamoure  And I am credibly informed that no such name as either Blandamoure or Pleindamoure is to be found in Lybeaus so that it is probable either your own eyes or as I rather suppose those of your right reverend and learned friend have seen the thing which was not  "Among Tanners manuscripts you say we have the  Weddynge of Sir Gawain  Numb Bibl Bodl" But are you sure Mr Warton that this reference is accuratethere was I am well assured no such thing in the article when it was not long since inspected for this very purpose  You say you think you "have somewhere seen a romance in verse entitled  The Turke and Gawaine"  The bishop of Dromore says he has it in his FOLIO MS Did you ever SEE THAT  P  "I shulde  swithe don  my lord kyng to wyte"  Thus ingeniously explained "I should  make haste  my lord the king to know" instead of  I should quickly  do him to wit i e  let him know  P  "Our brother we mowe hym clepe  wel"  "WEL i e SOMETIMES" O rare T W  P  "  Pelles  skins" Ignorance velvet mantles  palls  P  "FitzStephen mentions at the end of his tract "Imperatricem Matildem Henricum tertium et beatum Thomam c" p " Upon which you make the following profound and sagacious remark "Henry the third did not accede till the year Perhaps he FitzStephen implied  futurum  regem tertium" You conclude then do doubt that he spoke by the spirit of prophecy for this Henry the third was not born till thirtyfive years after Beckets assassination and sometime most probably after FitzStephens death But I will as I have often done and shall throughout my letter have frequent occasion to do give you a little information upon this subject of which you seem very much in need  You do not at least did not understand the passage you have here imperfectly quoted or you must have perceived that the author only mentions  these three great personages in this place because they were  born  in LONDON Henry the third who "acceded in " as I think you must have been some time or other told was  born  at WINCHESTER which place for aught I know might likewise have the honour of giving birth to yourself FitzStephen is not speaking of a king  in futuro  but of one  in esse  namely Henry the younger son to Henry II and grandson to the empress Matilda who was crowned king in the lifetime of his father and is expressly stiled HENRICUS TERTIUS by Mathew Paris William of Newbury and several others of our early historiansParticulars known to any person but of which I do not at all wonder that YOU should be ignorant or upon which that you should write as you seem to be no better acquainted with any one point you have handled in the whole course of your blundering work  P  This  rubbish  Long extracts from the  Pricke of Conscience  the most stupid miserable stuff that the historian could any where discover and of which no person can possibly read three lines  fills up rarely Mr Warton we shall soon make a volume  P note y  The absurdity of the argument against ecclesiastical establishments will not be readyly perceived by any but a thoroughbred Oxonian toryrory Highchurchman  P  The folly and injustice of your censure on Wickliffe that his attacks on the superstitions of his age proceeded from resentment might have been avoided had you known when he begun to write and when he was ejected from his wardenship particulars which you might easyly have learned from the Biographia Britannica  P  I should be glad to know from what authority or intrinsic or extrinsic evidence you infer that the romance of Alexander quoted in this page was written in imitation of the stile and manner of Piers Plowman which it certainly is not Indeed it rather seems to be a much earlyer composition There is I can assure you more reason against LONGLANDS title to the authorship of Piers Plowman than you are aware of  P  "Our author  i e  Chaucer in his Troilus and Cresseida from his excessive fondness for Statius has been guilty of a very diverting double anachronism"  I wish not to interrupt the merryment occasioned by this notable discoveryBut after you have sufficiently enjoyed your laughlet me ask you where this same diverting double anachronism existsout of your own imagination  fertile enough perhaps in creations of this kind Why might not Cressid be represented by Chaucer as reading the STORY OF THEBES Was the destruction of that city subsequent to the siege of Troy And admitting that Chaucer derived all his own knowlege from the THEBAID does CASSANDRA ever mention the name of STATIUS  P  You are here pleased to tell us that "AMADIS DE GAUL" had a sword which baffled the force of enchantments and refer to Don Quixote as your authority but you are continually involving yourself in some unfortunate dilemma For in the st place Amadis de Gaul had NOT such a sword and dly Don Quixote does NOT say he HAD He indeed speaks of the sword which belonged to "  Amadis quando se llamàva  el Cavallero de la ardiente espada  P l c  " when he called himself  the Knight of the burning sword  and if you had been in the least degree acquainted with the matter you would have known that it is not to AMADIS DE GAUL but to AMADIS OF GREECE he here alludes which last character is known by this very title and whose sword had actually the qualities which Cervantes ascribes to it  P  "Cervantes mentions a horse of woodmade by Merlin for Peter of Provence with which that valorous knight carried off the fair Magalona From what romance Cervantes took this I do not recollect"  It is not very surprising that you should forget what you never knew but to assist your memory I will inform you of three things no one of which I dare believe you are at present in the least acquainted with  The romance alluded to by Cervantes is intitled  "La Historia de la linda Magalona hija del rey de Napoles y de Pierres de Provença"  printed at Seville and to and is a translation from a much more ancient and very celebrated French romance under a similar title  The story of the wooden horse with the pin in its head is also to be found in another old Spanish romance likewise from the French intitled  "La Historia del cavallero Clamades y de la linda Clarmonda"  printed at Burgos in to  The original tale is in the Arabian Nights Entertainments  See "The story of the Inchanted Horse" vol iv p  P  "The story of Patient Grisilde was the invention of Boccacio" Hardyly and boldly assertedBlind Bayard never hesitates at a leap From the circumstance of there being every reason to conclude that Boccace was NOT the author of this story you very rationally conclude he WAS In the year and not the Decameron fell into the hands of Petrarch who tells Boccace in a letter he was so much affected with this tale that he had translated it into Latin adding that it had always pleased him  when he had heard  it many years before  See Mr Tyrwhitts Chaucer iv  a sufficient proof that Boccace was not the author And it would indeed appear very strange if Petrarch had not payed his friend some compliment upon the invention of so interesting a story if he had not been fully apprised that it was  not  HIS Besides it is well enough known that this is far from being the onely tale in the Decameron of which Boccace was not the inventor The fable of Chaucers interview with Petrarch having been justly exploded and given up by every other person YOU are now "inclined to think that he Chaucer was one of those friends to whom Petrarch used to relate it  i e  the story of Grisilde at Padua" and "this" you say "seems sufficiently pointed out in the words of the prologue" because the Clerk of Oxenford who tells the story there says that HE "lernid it at 'Padow of  this  worthie clerke" A most convincing and satisfactory circumstance truely But Petrarch does not inform us that he ever used to relate the story to his friends at Padua or anywhere else he onely says he had shewn his translation of it to one of them and from this version which would most probably be longer and more circumstantial than Boccacios and if you think proper you have it in your power to compare them there can be little doubt that Chaucer took the story believing it to be Petrarchs own and knowing it was not Boccacios  P  "There is a curious mixture in CHAUCERS  balade  to king Henry IV where Alexander Hector Julius Caesar Judas Maccabeus David Joshua Charlemagne Godfrey of Bulloign and king Arthur are all thrown together as antient heroes v seq"  And pray Sir under your good favour where is the great curiosity of placing the NINE WORTHIES in their proper order Your learning just enabled you to discover that  les neuf preux  meant  the nine worthies  it was not sufficient to inform you  who they were  But now Mr Warton since you are so fond of pointing out curiosities what do you think of the curiosity of JOHN GOWERS  balade  to Henry IV being written by CHAUCER  P  "Wel  sikerer  was his crowing in his loge  "Than was a clock or abbey horologe"  Sikerer  "clearer" Nonsense  Surer  more exact  P  "A  broche  she bare upon her low collere  "As brode as is the bosse of a boklere"  What do you mean by explaining  broche  a JEWEL A  precious stone  as broad  as the boss of a shield A very common ornament no doubtIt was her  breastbuckle  P  "It is remarkable" you say "that Wickliffe translates Luc i i "He schal not drinke wyn ne  sydyr  " Is this last word in any printed or MS copy of Wickliffes testament or is it an interpolation of your own I onely ask because a very ancient MS of it which has been lately consulted for the purpose reads "wyne  cyser  " "  vinum et  siceram" OXFORD ALE And as that seems to be the true word your quotation of the passage makes nothing to the purpose for which you produce it  VOL II  P  It would have been a curious though I should be apt to imagine a somewhat difficult argument to have endeavoured to prove how Gowers mentioning a  great number  of  stones  "vegetable mineral and animal" "abundantly confirms" Dr Warburtons explication of  Falstaffes  "TWO  stones  " which passage you very modestly tell us "the rest of the commentators do not seem to have understood" though in reality as "the rest of the commentators" would tell  you  you do not understand it yourself  P  I will here with your good leave transcribe a very curious note from the foot of this page  "I have mentioned a Latin romance of Alexander's life as printed by Frederick Corsellis about supr vol i p where you tell us it is "without date" On examination that impression is said to be finished Decemb Unluckily the seventeenth day of December was a Sunday that year A manifest proof that the name of Corsellis was forged"  And upon this correction and inevitable conclusion I shall beg leave to hazard a couple of insignificant remarks The first is I much doubt whether there be any such book as you refer to appearing or pretending to be printed by Corsellis in the above year because if there be and we can onely get rid of your "manifest proof" I think its existence will go a great way to establish not onely the identity of the man but his residence and practice at  Oxford in that very early period a circumstance so much to the credit of Alma Mater that I am surprised one of her old fostered children should have so readyly given it up on the slight ground of a printers devil finishing a book upon a Sunday  But are you  certain  Mr Warton that the th day of Decem  was  a Sunday Because I have and this is my d remark some reason to believe that it was not and I'll tell you whyIt was a SATURDAY the last day of the week the most likely of all others for the finishing of a laborious work "a manifest proof that the name of Corsellis was NOT forged" For surely "the collusion holds good in the exchange"The Sunday letter for this part of the year which was leap year and I appeal to every one capable of calculating it was B Sunday must therefor necessaryly fall upon the EIGHTEENTH day of the above month as any parishclerk is able to inform you How prudent Mr Warton you see it is always to establish your premisses upon a sure foundation before you venture to draw a conclusion which may in the end prove the overthrow of its creator  P  "men knowè well inowe  "That combreworld that thou Death my mayster slowe"  Note a "He calls death the  encumbrance of the world  " Ridiculous It is the MEN who  encumber the world  fruges

miserable state of incorrectness as all your other transcripts from MSS But why should you regard what you do not understand I will st give you an instance that it is incorrect and dly an instance that you do not understand it  Instead of "  Le  douʒty artours dawes" the MS reads "  Be  i e  by  in douʒty artours dawes"  "Of a  ley  that was ysette"  Ley  you interpret  Liege  as if it alluded to Launfals character or situation whereas it is simply a  Lay  or song that was so called  I could adduce five hundred such instances if I chose I may hereafter take some notice of your absurd whim of ascribing "a set of French romances" to "some Armorican bard" as well as of the familiar and confident manner in which you affect to speak of the poets of Britany of whose writings you never saw a line nor can you tell where there is one to be found and for whose history you know not where to look  P  You  think  you "have seen some evidence to prove that Chestre was author of the Erle of Tholouse" You THINK so and expect I suppose that your dreams are to pass upon your readers for fact and history you never could see any such evidence you never did see it  P  I onely observe that the  Gal  which you have here so very ingeniously converted into  Sal  and thence into  Salisbury  is foisted in by yourself without the least authority This  Chateau du Gast  or  Gât  is indeed sayed to be  near  Salisbury but that is a sufficient proof it was not meant to be the same place You should have proved that the romance of Lancelot had existed in Latin before you mentioned it as a translation from that tongue  P  "John Major mentions the beginning of some of his i e James I of Scotlands other poems viz "Yas sen c" and "at Beltayn c" Both these poems SEEM to be written on his

so idle and to my knowlege false a notion  P  "The decisive battle of SHREWSBURY fought against the SCOTS"  Where in the name of all that is wonderful and absurd could you possibly meet with this precious piece of information In the same authority no doubt whence you learned that the EMPEROR was  taken prisoner  by the FRENCH KING at the siege of PAVIA  Supplement to Shakspeare ii  You must either Mr Warton deal in very strange histories or else you are very unmindful of what you read or careless of what you say And indeed I cannot but think if that good and wholesome discipline which the name of MILTON may probably call to your remembrance were still in use at Trinity College the more than childish ignorance of a certain near friend of yours would hardly escape without experiencing its salutary effects  P  If you had looked further into John Hardings Chronicle than merely to  pick out a specimen of his poetical frigidity you might have found reason to allow with some truth "that both his prose and poetry are equally useful" as his book contains many curious and important historical records and a relation of numerous interesting facts in some of which he was a performer to others an eyewitness not to be found in any other of our old writers and surely you are not so absurd as to imagine that the veracity of his narrative is impeached by the flatness of his verse But indeed I am not at all surprised at the disregard you shew for authentic history after giving us such signal proofs how little you are acquainted with it  P  "John Scogan is commonly supposed to have been a cotemporary of Chaucer but this is a mistake He was educated at Oriel college in Oxford and being an excellent mimic and of great pleasantry in conversation became the favourite buffoon of the court of Edward the fourth in which he passed the greatest part of his life" You could scarcely have give the gentleman a more particular description if you had enjoyed the pleasure of a  têteàtête  with him But where is your authority for it Marry in "SCOGGINS JESTS" an admirable source truely to draw the history of a mans life from So may the lives of Foote Garrick and Sir John Fielding be compiled by some future Warton from the jestbooks extant under their respective names But let us examine the account This Scogan or Scoggin it seems was a buffoon in the court of Edward the fourth how then came Falstaff to break his head "at the court gate when he was a crack not thus high" this was in John of Gaunts time when Jack "was page to Thomas Mowbray duke of Norfolk  d pt of Hen IV a iii sc  " O this no doubt you will say is Shakspeares own anachronism Ben Jonson however who was as likely to know the fact as you are expressly tells us that Scogan was  a fine gentleman and a master of arts  Of HENRY THE FOURTHS times that made disguises  For the kings sons and writ in ballad royal  Daintily well  Fortunate Isles vol vi p Consult also Tyrwhitts Chaucer V xv xix    And this seems to be true for we have a  moral balade royal  from "Scogan unto the lordes and gentlemen of the kynges house" and which must as you observe have been written before the year meaning I suppose in his old age and printed as you yourself tell us by Caxton who was doubtless sufficiently acquainted with his identity and character and there is likewise another from Chaucer to him So that notwithstanding any doubt or uncertainty  you may have upon the authenticity of these two poems  If the above MORAL BALADE be "the dullest sermon that ever was written" and if it and other things equally dull be the whole of Scogans poetical remains whence arises your authority for giving him the very familiar appellation of "our JOCULAR BARD" since by your own account his  jests  and his  poetry  had not the remotest connection It is not unlikely however to allow you all possible justice that in thus summing up his character in two words you had your eye upon the following ingenious composition which he wrote at Oxford on taking his degree of A M and wherein  both  his talents are united  "A Master of Art is not worth a fart  "Except he be in schools  "A Batchelour of Law is not worth a straw  "Except he be among fools"  every person else must be convinced that the Scogan by and to whom they were respectively written could not possibly be a  buffoon  in the court of  Edward IV  This was a difficulty you could not reconcile to your hypothesis you were therefor resolved to deny or at least to doubt the evidence that made for the opposite side of the question and to cut the knot which you could not untye For a little enquiry or attention must have informed you that the true name of the poet Scogan was HENRY and not JOHN This Mr Tyrwhitt has clearly shewn and thence perhaps rather too hastyly inferred that the story of Scogan the jester was an absurd and improbable fiction nay he has even contrary to his usual candour gone so far as to call the jestbook of which you have so exalted an opinion "a collection of  foolish  stories" The merits of the work I shall leave to be settled between yourselves but this really learned and ingenious gentleman will not I trust take it amiss if I shall venture to assert that there  actually was  such a person as JOHN SCOGAN a totally distinct character from Henry the poet and who though no "jocular bard" unless you will allow the extract in the note sufficient to authorise the title must in my mind have been "a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy" I do not in forming this opinion rely altogether upon your friend Dr Andrew Borde though it will appear that the account given by him is not entirely void of probability  This writer informs us he had "heard say that Scogin did come of an honest stock no kindred and that his friends did set him to schoole at Oxford where he did continue till he was made master of art" He appears from the book to have been dead before Henry the sevenths time He is there frequently called TOM by Sir William Nevyle and is introduced to court as his fool possibly however this might have been the common appellation of such characters we still say TOM FOOL SCOGGINS JESTS nd to b  neither do I lay much stress on what Shallow says in Hen IV"Bale inaccurately" you say but why inaccurately he certainly knew more about the fellow than you can do "calls Scogan the JOCULATOR of Edward the fourth"the kings JESTER there is no inaccuracy in the phrase and you admit the fact But I shall produce still better and more unexceptionable authority and first we will see what master Raphael Hollinshed says of him speaking of the great men of Edward the fourths time "Skogan a learned gentleman and student for a time in Oxforde of a pleasaunte witte and bent to mery deuises in respect whereof he was called  into the courte where giuing himselfe to his naturall inclination of mirthe and pleasaunt pastime he plaied many sporting parts althoughe not in suche vnciuill maner as hath bene of hym reported  His Eng II By "vnciuill" reports he evidently alludes to Dr Bordes Storybook a circumstance of which the reader will have little doubt on perusing the following  mery jest  intituled "How Scogin let a fart and said it was worth forty pounds"  "That time that Scogin was conversant both in the kings chamber and in the quens Scogin would peak here and there about in the queens chamber or lodging the queen by custom as most commonly all great women and ladies and gentlewomen do let a fart saying The same is worth to me twenty pound Scogin hearing this girt out a fart like a horse or mare saying if that fart be so dear of twenty pound my fart is worth forty pounds" p  The story immediately preceding "How Scogin played horseplay in the queens chamber" is still more "vnciuill"  The title of the book is "Scogins Jests Full of witty mirth and pleasant shifts done by him in France and other places Being a preservative against melancholy Gathered by Andrew Board doctor of physick"  Amongst these ancient and vulgar pleasantries is the supposedly modern story of the French quack and his fleapowder and Smollets tale of the  three black crows  here augmented to  twentyone  There is likewise the joke of the Oxford scholars proving two eggs to be three and that of the sharpers convincing the fellow that his sheep were hogs besides many other suchlike things usually met with in more modern books  " Secondly here is his EPITAPH transcribed from an authentic MS in the British Museum  MSS Harl It is remarkable for containing the name of Cardinal Pole written by himself when a boy at school  an evidence which must be decisive as to his existence character and christian name  Hic iacet in tumulo corpus  SCOGAN  ecce  JOHANNIS  Sit tibi pro speculo letus fuit eius in annis  Leti transibunt transitus vitare nequibunt  Quo nescim{us} ibunt vinosi cito Ribunt  This MS appears to have been written towards the latter part of Edward the fourth's time so that you are peculiarly happy in your conjecture that Scogan "FLOURISHED about the year  I could never conceive Mr Warton to what Drayton alludes in the preface to his Eclogues where he says that "the Colin Clout of SCOGAN under Henry the seventh is pretty" He is speaking of pastoral poetry and adds that "Barklays ship of fools hath twenty wiser in it" You somewhere say "he must mean SKELTON" but what PASTORAL did HE write  "  P  "I refer also the NOTBROWNE MAYDE to this period  i e  the reign of Ed IV That is because you know no better than Prior did when he called it  three hundred years old  It cannot possibly be earlyer than Henry the eighths time You are equally mistaken about "the delectable history of king Edward the fourth and the tanner of Tamworth" which as we have it now is certainly not older than the latter part of queen Elizabeths reign By a parity of reasoning I suppose if it had been  the delectable history of king  HENRY  the fourth or king Edward the  FIRST  and the aforesay'd tanner  you would have carryed it fifty or a hundred years still further back I readyly however admit  that the poem has been much modernised and that the original of which I am certain you never before heard is probably as old as the time you mention having seen and transcribed an ancient MS copy which appeared to have been written in or about the reign of Henry the seventh intitled "THE KYNG AND THE BARKER  i e  of "Dantre" or Daventry and not Tamworth  "  P  Though I very willingly agree with you in determining the poems of Rowley to be modern illcontrived forgeries yet I must beg leave to think that neither "MS Wantn" nor any other gives you the least authority for saying that "SIR CHARLES BALDWIN was executed at Bristol in the presence of Edward the fourth in the year " This name and circumstance if not from Chattertons poem are entirely of your own invention And how is it possible that ROWLEYS MEMOIRS should be composed in when he speaks of king Edward IV as the reigning prince who did not attain the crown till the following year and expressly mentions his Bristow tragedy the relation of an event which according to your own account did not happen before or as you afterwards correct yourself or  P  "The reader will observe that whether there are eight or SEVEN lines I have called it the OCTAVE stanza" I see you have and should from this curious remark be rather apt if it were not for better intelligence to assign your  birth parentage  and  education  to a country more remarkable for such like observations than our own You are I imagine so far acquainted with mathematics as to know that SEVEN is not EIGHT any more than or for you likewise call Spensers the OCTAVE stanza by the same licence I suppose as you elsewhere tell us that a poem containing SIX lines in each verse was "printed in FIVELINED STANZAS  Vol ii p  "  P  "He  sci  Richard I regnyd almost TWO yere"  Be so good as to look at your original and see whether it be not as it should be TEN  yere  instead of TWO  P  Having displayed your ingenious conjectures that Ranulph Higden the chronicler was author of the Chester Whitsun Plays you tell us that "in  Piers Plowman  a FRIER says that he is  well acquainted  with  the rimes  of Randall of Chester" and add "I take this passage to allude to THIS VERY PERSON  and to his  compositions of this kind  for which he was probably soon famous" Very well every thing you suppose is so far smooth and safe And now Mr Warton let me observe two things to you st The fellow in Piers Plowman to whom you mean to refer is NOT a FRIER but an idle drunken SECULAR PRIEST dly He does NOT say that he is well acquainted with THE "rimes of Randall of Chester" he onely tells us that he "CAN rimes of Roben Hode and Randal of Chester"  i e  that he could SING or REPEAT rimes or songs not MADE BY but OF AND CONCERNING Robin Hood and Randal of Chesternot Randal Hygden but Randal Blundeville EARL of CHESTER a crusader and celebrated hero greatly in favour with the common people and contemporary with Robin Hood You begin now to perceive what a ridiculous figure your conclusion cuts and into what a miserable dilemma you have got for unless you will allow that YOUR  frier  could spout plays written by Robin Hood you cannot be permitted to say that he alludes to the Whitsun Mummeries of Randal Hygden how famous soever you may suppose him to have been on that account  P  "Whiche be omytted now  not put in ure  "  That is as you explain it "not mentioned here" Flat nonsense the meaning is  not now put in use  not used at present  P  "INFORTUNIO" You had best be sure whether Spenser ever assumed this appellation In the mean time I will inform you that the author of this poem on the miseries of Edward II was RALPH STARKEY the antiquary  P  "The DEADMAN'S SONG…is worthy of Doctor Percy's excellent collection" I really believe Mr Warton that you are the onely person in the world that could think or would say so It is a most wretched performance altogether unworthy of republication and for the justice of this character I appeal to the Doctor hisself of whose taste in poetry that is where he understands it I have the highest opinion and who may indeed easyly make it deserving of a place in his "excellent collection" if he will but take the same pains with it which he has taken with most of the other old pieces so faithfully reprinted in that celebrated work It has done HIS busyness however and that's enough  P  "As Tully supposes SCIPIO to have shewn the other world to his ANCESTOR AFRICANUS"  So  in vol iii p "In imitation of Tully who in the  Somnium Scipionis  supposes SCIPIO to have shewn the other world to his ANCESTOR AFRICANUS"  IS THIS a  proof  that you Mr Warton have ever read the  Somnium Scipionis  or a proof that you have been in a  dream  yourself Is it possible think you for such an absurdity to have proceeded from any other person  P  "The HISTORY OF THE SEVEN CHAMPIONS a book compiled in the reign of JAMES THE FIRST by one Richard Johnson and containing some of the capital fictions of the old Arabian romance" It is somewhat extraordinary if this work were written no sooner that the AUTHOR of the OBSERVATIONS ON SPENSERS FAIRY QUEEN should have represented it as one of those "miraculous books" which were so highly fashionable in the reign of queen Elizabeth and even as having been of great assistance to Spenser in the formation of that poem But I well know who corrected him and I likewise believe that  the correcter  knew very little more of the matter than  the corrected  The fact is that both the author of the Observations and the author of the History of English Poetry  is  wrong For st The History of the Seven Champions was not written so early as the Fairy Queen and dly It was not "compiled in the reign of James the first" The first position is not indeed quite so easy to prove nor as you yourself here suppose the contrary do I much care whether it be true or not but the other is certain "The Seven Champions of Christendom" being quoted as a popular book by Meres in his WITS TREASURY printed in With respect to its containing any fiction of Arabian romance you should I think first adduce some such romance containing similar fictions with the Seven Champions which is a mere olio from Guy Bevis and other old English romances and storybooks  P  "The cristen mon  hedde farly  "What hit mihte mene"  "Was very attentive  Heeded  "  Though I have here and there hastyly picked up a good large bavin of your pretended explanations of ancient

 "About the year MARTIN COCCCAIE of Mantua whose true name was THEOPHILO FOLENGIO a Benedictine monk of Casino in Italy wrote aburlesque Latin poem in heroic metre checquered with ITALIAN and TUSCAN

book and if he had sayed any thing would have told his readers that such a one under such an assumed name did so and so But it seems to be your chief study if you study at all to court absurdity rather than to avoid it Here being no less than three choice blunders in little more than so many lines For in the first place the assumed name of the aobve writer not MARTIN but MERLIN Coccaie dly His true one was not  Theophilo  FOLENGIO but  Teofilo  FOLENGO And dly The most illiterate person must know that the  Italian  and  Tuscan  is either one and the same language or at least that  Tuscan  words must necessaryly be  Italian  ones But I ask your pardon you do not perhaps know that Tuscany is in Italy Ignorant you certainly are that the dialect made use of in the above poem is the  Mantuan  which would be almost as difficult to a native of Florence as to a native of Madrid You have well observed that you went out of your way to mention such obscure versifyers as Folengus and Arena for you neither prove that Skelton copyed the manner indeed it would have been surprising if he had as he wrote before either nor that  their  singular mode of versification was known in England nor  his  in France or Italy Indeed you evidently to not know what Macaronic poetry is The POLEMOMIDDINIA is undoubtedly the first regular imitation of Folengo I mean the first Macaronic poem by a

peace  c  "  I had puzzled myself for a long time to find out how you could possibly become acquainted with the circumstances of Wyatts obligation to Petrarch For I can never believe that  you  ever read the Italian poet I have indeed sometimes thought that the truely learned Mr Tyrwhitt might have furnished you with this piece of information But if you had received many such favours from him your book would have cut a very different sigure from what it does and I should have been deprived of the honour of addressing you upon the subject At other times I have doubted whether you were not indebted to your illustrious friend the bishop of Dromore But alas I know not that his lordship is much better acquainted with Petrarch than yourself I might indeed have remained in perpetual ignorance if I had not accidentally cast my eye upon the th page of the th volume of the last edition of Shakspeare where I find the ingenious Dr Farmer quoting this very sonnet and referring to Wyatts translation with all the particularities you could have desired But still I am at a loss to know how you came to learn that the passage in Petrarchs sonnet which you have pointed out "is taken from  Messen Jordi  a PROVENCIAL poet of VALENCIA" Sure I am that you can know nothing of the Valencian poets And therefor though I am pretty well satisfyed that no such person as MESSEN JORDI ever existed I shall not accuse you of inventing the name and circumstance alluded to indeed I strongly suspect whence you drew them tho' I have it not a present in my power to satisfy myself Be that as it may to call him "a PROVENCIAL poet of VALENCIA"  is one of those IrishEnglish bulls for which you alone must be answerable A FRENCH poet of SPAIN or a SPANISH poet of FRANCE Why would you my dear sir trust yourself so far from home in a strange country too and which is worst of all where anybody had been before or could come after you  P  "In  lusty leas  at liberty I walke"  "In large fields over fruitful grounds" Contemptible In  pleasant meads  P  Are you sure Mr Warton that George Gascoyne was the author of the  Panegyric on the English Poets  Compare ii n i  P  "What star doth let the hurtful  sire  to rage"  Sire  you interpret SATURN A sort of small mistake into which ignorant people will sometimes unavoidably stumble What think you of SIRIUS  the dogstar  P  "The Tragedy of GORDOBUCKE  That this blunder has proceeded from the author and not from the press appears from its occuri  g in many other places indeed whereever the drama is spoken of See in particular vol iii p

of Tottenham…the substance of its phraseology which I diverst of its obvious innovations is not altogether obsolete enough for a higher period I am aware that in a manuscript of the British Museum it is referred to the time of Henry the sixth But that manuscript affords no positive indication of that date"  Such a shuffleing nonsensical paragraph was I firmly believe never put together since the invention of letters That which I do not and which I think no one can understand I shall not meddle with Here is an authentic MS which not onely Mr Tyrwhitt and when I mention him I suppose I need not care if there be a hundred of a different opinion but every other person who has seen it is satisfyed and convinced could not have been written later than the reign of Henry the sixth NOW YOU Mr Warton who to be sure must be an incomparable judge of what you never saw pronounce it near a century more modern because forsooth it only  refers  the poem to  that age which it certainly does not and gives no "positive indication" of such a date which it certainly does But if the book had been evidently written in Edward the seconds time the same absuid plea would have served you There is not one MS out of a hundred that has any "positive indication" of the particular period in which it has been written and yet people who are in the practice of inspecting and comparing MSS of different ages can assign to each its proper date nearly as well as it they had sound it in the book But what is all this to you who know nothing either of ancient writing or of ancient language For I will venture to say that the stile of this very composition bespeaks it at least a hundred years older than the  Nutbrowne Mayde  which not onely without but against all authority you have thrown so far back as the reign of Henry VI Your recantation proves nothing but your ignorance  The right revd the lord bp of Dromore has in the third edition of his "Reliques of Ancient English Poetry" vol ii p printed the TURNAMENT OF TOTTENHAM from the above MS This copy I naturally suppose you have not seen or you must I think have perceived the absurdity of mentioning "obvious innovations" His lordship has indeed told us that the  last stanza  is not in the MS but in this he is positively mistaken  P note z  For the purpose of observing that the  stanza  used by  one man  is the same with that used by  another  a most prosound and important remark and extremely necessary especially in this place there was surely no occasion to foist in a poem of sixteen stanzas O yes I beg your pardon but there wasTo lengthen and stuff your work which without such ingenious contrivances such adventitious helps you could never have been able to spin out to three large quarto volumes before you come to Spensers Fairy Queen The OBSERVATIONS on which for I suppose you will of course lug in the whole of your former work and indeed as it is entirely forgotten and may therefor safely appear as new matter one cannot disapprove your oeconomy will naturally make the subject of a  fourth  and thus you will proceed I supposed with a volume a year so long as the credulity of the public will keep you in countenance I love to speak out Mr Warton I really believe you will not willingly close the work so long as you can make a single guinea by it  I am not unaware that you have informed us of the fourth volume being in the press which will complete the work but they who put implicit faith in such assurances can never have seen or must have entirely forget the following advertisement at the end of the second edition of your POEMS and which was doubtless inserted in the newspapers of that year"SPEEDILY will be published by the same Author the  Third  and LAST Volume of the History of English Poetry In which the Subject will be carried  brought  I suppose you mean down to the Commencement of the PRESENT Century" How well you kept your word will appear by the volume itsself which was not published till near three years after and in which the subject is not even carried down as you call it to the commencement of the LAST  It is in my opinion a most extraordinary and I hope and believe unparalleled circumstance that a man of eminence in the literary  world should in order to enhance the bulk and price of his writings hazard his reputation upon and descend to or rather be guilty of such low such paltry such dishonourable and even dishonest artifices as almost to deserve the name and punishment of aSWINDLER  P  "For the purpose of ascertaining or illustrating the age of pieces which have been lately or will be soon produced I here stop to recall the readers attention to the poetry and language of the last  sci  the th century by exhibiting some extracts from the manuscript romance of YWAIN and GAWAIN which has some great outlines of Gothic painting and appears to have been written in the reign of HENRY THE SIXTH I premise that  but few circumstances happened which contributed to the improvement of our language within  THAT  and the  PRESENT PERIOD"  How modest how ingenuousBut indeed I ought to apologise for this and the other long extracts I have taken the liberty of producing from your celebrated history however as the mode has been adopted rather for the sake of giving you fair play and doing you SUBSTANTIAL JUSTICE than with a view to injure the rapid sale of the work you will I flatter myself have no inclination to be displeased at it But to returnAnd so you really thought it necessary to go back a full hundred years to  newwrite  the History of English Poetry during that period A most systematical historian doubtless What would any of Mr Humes readers have thought of him if in the middle of Henry the eighths reign he had  stopped to recall their attention  to a new history of the reign of Henry the sixth What could there possibly be in the state of our language and poetry at the period you had got to which could require could authorise could justify or even excuse your going back a hundred years to begin your story anew That which you affect "to premise" with respect to the language having received no improvement between the two periods is a glaring inconsistency You wilfully forget as you wish your readers to do that there has been a SURREY and a WYATT just mentioned If any other person had advanced such a groundless and absurd position you must have taken him for either a fool or a madman But the truth Mr Warton the truth is that you knew nothing of this romance when you might properly enough have introduced it not in the reign of Henry VI for that is an age it does not belong to you were as entirely ignorant of the existence of such a poet as  Laurence Minot  before you saw Mr Tyrwhitts Chaucer which by the way was published soon enough for you to have made a better use of it  It appeared three years before the publication of your second volume in the body of which it is I believe never once mentioned  as you still are of his marit I know that these communications were made to you after the publication of your second volume but you were resolved it seems to drag them at all events neck and heels into your third and I am ready to confess they well answer the purpose for which you introduced themthey stuff your book But  now Mr Warton suffer me if you please to say a few words to you upon the age of this same MS COTTON GALB E ix which by the way I believe you never saw and yet I can hardly think any other person could have been so grossly deceived as to suppose it of the age of Henry VI I will venture to assure you and I do not care a farthing whether you believe me or not that the writing of this book is as old at least as the time of king Richard the second But I well know that all the world will be convinced of your want of judgement before you yourself suspect it  P  "Lions beres both bul and bare  "That rewfully gan  rope  and rare"  Rope  you explain by  "ramp"  But it means

SYR BEVYS OF SOUTHAMPTON were modernised in this reign  sci  that of Hen VIII from more antient and simple narrations" This ingenious conjecture comes to be sure with perfect consistency from one who has already produced large extracts from these very poems as specimens of the composition of Edward the seconds time But ingenious as it is it contains neither probability nor truth All the above romances are extant in MSS above years old and one of them at least Sir Bevis excepting the typographical incorrectness of the old printed copy differs no otherwise from it than in its orthography and the slight variations inseparable from repeated transcription The ancient MS copy of  Richard Cuer de Lion  is as long at least as if not longer than the old  editions  but whether the printed copies agree with the MSS or not is a matter of very little consequence to your hypothesis It is a fact that some MS copies are so totally different from each other as not to have two lines in common being translations from the French by different hands This is actually the case with respect to SIR GUY there are two distinct translations both very old one of which is line for line the same with the printed copy But it will not be found that the phraseology or stile is more polished or the story more amplifyed or intricate in the editions than they are in the MSS Simplicity indeed is a fault of which few people will have reason to complain in the perusal of an old metrical romance let its antiquity be what it may I shall  take the liberty to observe in passing that the printed copy of SIR GUY does NOT begin ITHEN the tyme that God was borne as you implicitly following AMES but according to your constant practice concealing the name of your informant have been pleased to assert  Ames

not without very strong suspicions that you were indebted as well for this same carol as for the printers colophonnot to the book itsself butto your honest industrious useful and ungratefully requited friend and assistant Thomas Hearne in his notes and spicilege upon William of Newbury who had likewise as it appeared furnished you with the anecdote from Hollinshed p These suspicions were not weakened on finding by a comparison of you and your authority that sayed carol and colophon were printed with your usual accuracy But upon further reflection I am half inclined to question the justice of the above suspicions for it rather seems to me that you have been on this occasion GUILTY OF PRIVATELY STEALINGfrom YOURSELF And I'll tell you how In that very humourous trifle intitled and called "A COMPANION TO THE GUIDE AND A GUIDE TO THE COMPANION" I see that you have inserted the whole of Mr Hearnes account  verbatim  and with a circumstance which might elsewhere have been more to your honouryou have given a minute and accurate reference to your real authority I say  elsewhere  for it is in this place done merely with a view to raise a laugh at the expence of that most worthy and respectable antiquary whom I rather think you have in the above piece made somewhat toomany attempts to ridicule forgetting perhaps that though he was less polished in his taste and less elegant in his diction than some more modern writers few if any of them can boast of such a sacred regard to truth and of such unimpeached integrity And whatever his errors are there is one in which I wish you had imitated him as successfully as you have done in many others of a less important and commendable naturehe has never been detected in a wilful falsehood nor been ever charged with the slightest misrepresentation of the minutest fact  Lest the number and uniformity of these dry expostulations should render them too flat and tedious to yourself or my other gentle readers I shall make bold to break the chain and endeavour to enliven you and them with an old Christmas carol upon bringing up the BOARS HEAD very different from that printed by Wynken de Worde and now for the first time faithfully published from an ancient MS in my own possession  In die natiuitat{is}  Nowell nowell nowell nowell  Tydyng{is} gode y thyngke to telle  The borys hede that we bryng here  Betokeneth a  p

use at present it is heartyly at their service and they may likewise command the original music the accompanyment of which would alone be sufficient to give this song a decided superiority over the other and cannot fail to render their  boarshead  dinner a REAL FEAST    P  "The same BOAR that is EDWARD THE THIRD is introduced by Minot as resisting the Scottish invasion in at Nevils cross near Durham  "Sir David the Bruse  "Was at distance  When EDWARD THE BALIOLFE  "Rade with his lance"  Baliolfe  you tell us means "WARLIKE" How despicably ignorant must you conceive your readers to dare for a moment to suppose that such stuff should pass upon them for knowlege in history criticism and ancient language Does not every child know that EDWARD III so far from playing the BOAR at Nevils cross was not even in England when that affair happened Indeed Minot expressly mentions his absence in this very poem Know to your confusion that  Edward the baliolfe  is EDWARD DE BALIOL who is sayed

found ourselves so unexpectedly plunged and now perhaps you will after I have recovered my fright and breath give me leave to ask you a single question To what purpose is all this long dissertation upon  Dante  What possible connection is there between the  Divina Comedia  and the History of English Poetry "Pough fool it fills my book up do'n't it" Very true sir it certainly does so and I think THAT from you is such an unanswerable argument for the necessity of this sort of manoeuvre that I rather wonder you have not favoured us with a similar account of every epic or other poem of which you know anything or know nothing 'tis all the same from Homer to Milton Trust me I admire your modesty though doubtless we shall have more anon But pray as you have entertained us with so many Italian quotations give me leave to ask you how long it may be since you became master of that language because I have heared that once upon a time when you were ambitious of displaying your erudition in the OBSERVATIONS ON SPENSERS FAIRY QUEEN by an extract from Tasso Tasso in the original you unfortunately laid hold of a  wrong stanza  which occasioned much mirth among those wicked wits who are so maliciously disposed as not to suffer a man of genius to enjoy the credit of talents and learning which he does not possess  P  "I am not sure that the  translator of Plutarchs Lives  in is the same

as the others and most propably it is the very same thing  P  "The murninge of Edward duke of Buckingham" is not as you absurdly enough suppose  Sackvilles Legend  but a real ballad which is still extant and has been lately reprinted  P  "Marlowes wit and spriteliness of conversation had often the unhappy effect of tempting him to sport with sacred subjects more perhaps from the  preposterous ambition of courting the casual applause of profligate and unprincipled companions than from any systematic disbelief of religion His scepticism whatever it might be was construed by the prejudiced and peevish puritans into absolute atheism and they took pains to represent the unfortunate catastrophe of his untimely death as an immediate judgment from heaven upon his execrable impiety"  A great deal has been sayed about Marlow his opinions and exit from age to age from Beard to Warton the oldest writers "prejudiced and peevish puritans" directly arraigning him of atheism and blasphemy and those of more modern times pious and orthodox churchmen generously labouring to rescue his character either by boldly denying or artfully extenuating the crimes alledged against him but not an  iota  of evidence has been produced on either side I have a great respect for Marlow as an ingenious poet but I have a much higher regard for truth and justice and will therefor take the liberty to produce the strongest if not the whole proof that now remains of his diabolical tenets and debauched morals and if you Mr Warton still choose to think him innocent of the charge I shall be very glad to see

plain that these "prejudiced peevish puritans" had sufficient authority to assert that Marlow" denied God and his sonne Christ and nor onely in word blasphemed the Trinity but also as 'was' credibly reported wrote bookes against it affirming our Sauiour to be but a deceiuer and Moses to be but a coniurer and seducer of the people and the holy Bible to bee but vaine and idle stories and all

conceive It could not surely be for the  smoothness of the paragraph  All former writers and Wood amongst the rest whom you expressly quote and which does not always follow by a slight peculiarity in your expression I think you must have consulted say it was in his HEAD  P  "IGNOTO  Raleighs  CONSTANT SIGNATURE" Always confident and always wrong The publisher of  Englands Helicon  never conceals

distinguished have been since referred to their true authors Some to Shakspeace others to Spenser but not one of them if we except the reply to Marlow has been ever supposed to be Raleighs To whom if you had not been generously pleased to give the  Imitation  you mention it might have remained in want of an owner till doomsday Of this discovery therefor your profound sagacity may safely claim the sole credit  P  "As a  peotical  novel of Greece it will not be improper to mention here the  Clitophon and Leucippe  of Achilles Tatius" Pray what do you mean by  calling this a POETICAL novel Both

couple of centuries after him I would be glad to know where you Mr Warton discovered that Boccace was "imitated" by the compiler of the  Novelle Antike  whom you have doubtless sufficient authority for placing  after  Bndello as I am given to understand that the Italian literati universally believe not onely that he was at least contemporary with Boccace but also that his tales are of much

some one  had actually  sayed so of her I was rather surprised that you had not taken more particular notice of the passage when I found that according to your usual and laudable custom you had been pecking and pilfering from Mr Steevenses note upon it whence I see you got your  report  that the  Cent nouvelles nouvelles  were written by some of the royal family of France But I am afrayed that the ingenious commentator confounded this work with a quite different onethe Queen of Navarres Tales  P  "Among Mr Oldys's books was the "Life of Sir Meliado  a Brittish knight  " translated from the

which has converted many a French knight into an Englishman The learned Nicholas Antonio in his SPANISH LIBRARY  affords a remarkable example of this confusion  and a  proof of its frequency  where he is speaking of the Spanish translation of the romance of TIRANTE THE WHITE in  Ad fabularum artificem stylum convertimus Joannem Martorell Valentiae regni civem cujus est liber hujus commatis TIRANT

You cannot even translate the simplest passage with common honesty Antonio does not assert that the book was ACTUALLY PRINTED at Valencia in that year he onely says IT WAS REPORTED SO And the report was false  in This writer according to a practice common to such idle historians pretends he translated this book from English into Portugueze and from thence into the Valencian language  The hero is a  gentleman  of BRETAGNE and the book was FIRST WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY I take this opportunity of observing that  these mistakes  of ENGLAND for BRITANNY  tend to confirm  MY HYPOTHESIS that Bretagne or Armorica was antiently a copious source of romance an hypothesis which I have the happiness to find was the opinion of the most learned and ingenious M La Croze  c  p "OUR KING ARTHUR was sometimes called ARTHUR of LITTLE BRITTAYNE and there is a romance with that title reprinted in "  I trouble you Mr Warton with this long extract because it is so very interesting and I have such a great deal to say to you upon it that nothing less perhaps would have answered either your purpose or mine  Though I never met with the "LIFE OF SIR MELIADO" nor with any other notice of it I must be content to suppose it to have actually been where you say it was But you ought certainly to have been better acquainted with it before you had so peremptoryly decided upon the meaning of the word "BRITTISH" which with equal absurdity and presumption you would confine to BRETAGNE or Britany in France To be sure you are rather got into your Irish stile when you attempt to prove that BRITISH does NOT mean ENGLISH as no one I believe excepting yourself could possibly have imagined that it did It is at the same time very curious to find a person who either is or pretends to be a scholar hardyly contending that this country was never called BRITAIN nor its inhabitants BRITISH That the sun gives no light and the night brings no darknes The notion is in the utmost degree contemptible and absurd Armorica was by the French called LA PETITE BRETAGNE by us LITTLE BRITAIN merely to distinguish it from the iland of GREAT BRITAIN by the stiled LA GRANDE BRETAGNE The name BRITISH  may  for aught I know be common to both countries but I firmly believe the inhabitants of BRITANY were never so called much less  distinguished  by any writer English of foreign before the sagacious Mr Warton  If there be any such book as "The Life of Sir Meliado" it is without doubt the romance of MELIADUS DE LEONNOIS a petty king in GREAT BRITAIN and one of the knights of the Round Table whose story was translated out of French into Italian and printed at Venice in and in two volumes octavo  But let the word BRITISH mean what it will how does it connect with or apply to the quotation from Nicholas Antonio He says nothing at all about BRITISH he expresly tells us that Martorell pretended to have translated the romance of Tirante "EX ANGLICA" out of ENGLISH I have not in the whole  course of this strange history been astonished at anything more than at your assertion that "the hero is a gentleman of BRETAGNE" Because I can onely conclude it to be a guess and it happens to be as lucky as it was bold You are not quite so fortunate however in your equally dogmatical position that "the book was FIRST WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT COUNTRY" than which nothing can be more insupportable more illgrounded or more false I must indeed confess that it was not without reason you concluded every one to be as ignorant about the matter as yourself and that you might safely advance whatever you chose without the smallest fear of detection But alas how miserably have you been deceived John or Joanot Martorell the author of the above romance of TIRANT LO BLANCH which by the way was not printed at Valencia in but at Barcelona in and no where else during the th century in his dedication thereof to Don Ferdinand prince of Portugal and duke of Viseo brother of Alphonsus V and then  sci  in presumptive heir to the crown to which his son Emanuel afterwards succeeded positively declares that the history and acts of the said TIRANT were written in the English tongue  "EN LENGUA ANGLESA"  that he had TRANSLATED them out of THAT LANGUAGE into PORTUGUESE at the direct instance of the above prince who thought that as he Martorell had been sometime in England "  EN LA ILLA DE ANGLETERRA  In the suite perhaps of Peter duke of Coimbra one of the sons of John I who was here in the third year of king Henry VI at whose court he was magnificently entertained and made a knight of the Garter An honour which Martorell has conferred upon the hero of his romance whom he supposes to be the first that received it As to prince Ferdinand though he might never be in England it is not improbable that he understood something of the language being grandson of Philippa sister of our Henry IV and wife of the above John He dyed in aged thirty so that he could not well have been more than nineteen when he imposed the task of this translation upon Martorell  he would know the tongue better than others that he had since translated the book out of Portuguese into his native dialect the VALENCIAN  He onely lived it appears to finish the three first books the fourth and last part is sayed to be translated  "a pregaries de la noble senyora dona ysabel de loriç per lo magnifich caualler mossen marti iohau de galba"  and apologises for the defects of his version as being in some measure occasioned by the peculiar difficulties of the English language which he had in many places found it impracticable to translate But as you appear to understand Valencian  See before p  I shall give you his own words  "Car si d'faliments algūs hi son certament senyor nes en part causa da dita LENGUA ĀGLESA de la qual en algunes partides es inpossible poder be girar los vocables"  It is strange enough that an author more especially of Martorells consequence who is stiled  "lo magnifich e virtuos cavaller"  should have the considence to impose upon his patron not onely a feigned original but a feigned command to translate it and an imaginary translation too This is an enigma we cannot at present solve It is not impossible however that Martorell might actually pick up some part of his subject during his residence in England What makes this conjecture the less  improbable is the use he has made of the story of  "Comte gillem de uaroych"  Guy of Warwick which we know to have been then extant in English The origin of THE GARTER the magnificent celebration of the nuptials of the king of England alluding most likely to those of Richard II with the king of France's daughter and some few other particulars he may undoubtedly have got here Though one might perhaps be led to think that he has derived his principal information on these heads from old Froissart a favourite historian during the continuance of chivalry But independent of his own assertions the venial deceits of a romantic age there is the strongest and most conclusive evidence as well intrinsic as extrinsic that Martorell whether he wrote first in Portuguese or Valencian was the original author As to the work itself it is a most ingenious and admirable performance well deserving the praises bestowed upon it by Cervantes  See  Don Quixote  p l c The romance of Tirante was early in the th century translated into Castilian from thence into Italian and about or years ago into French The two latter translators were entire strangers to the original of which there is not perhaps more than one single copy known to be extant  and much beyond any thing of the kind ever produced in England or even if one dare venture to say it capable of being so  You will not desire me to take further notice of your assertion that this romance was first written in the language of Britany I have I think sayed enough to make you completely ashamed of yourself if you have a particle of modesty in your composition But what credit let me ask is a reader to place in the reveries and confident declarations of so ignorant so false and so conceited a writer  Your HYPOTHESIS as you call it is so false so groundless so visionary and absurd that I am equally willing to believe it your own and to leave you in peacable possession of it Neither have I any thing at present to say to "the most learned and ingenious M La Croze" of whom I must with shame acknowlege I never before heared If therefor it be such an amazing happyness to find one single person in the whole world of the same opinion with yourself enjoy it  That "our king Arthur" might be "sometimes called Arthur of Little Brittayne" as he is supposed to have been king of both countries is probable enough though I do not believe it I am however ready to allow that "there is a romance with that title" which may for any thing I know to the contrary have been "reprinted in " But they who told you that should at the same time have informed you that Arthur of Little Britain the hero of that romance is a very different person from king Arthur of Great Britain And so much for you and your hypothesis  P  The old version of TASSO being registered by Ames and at present existing to my knowlege in more libraries than one is no such mighty discovery as you seem to flatter yourself However if you think its full title and a specimen of the translators poetical talents worthy of a place in your next  edition if your admirable history arrive at that honour or even in the list of blunders"Emendations and additions" I should sayto Volume the third you are heartyly welcome to both Onely take care I beseech you and print them correctly and I shall space you the mortification of telling to whom you are obliged

it may be is  Richard Carew  I have at length Mr Warton completed my design of exposing to the public eye a tolerable specimen of the numerous errors falsities and plagiarisms of which you have been guilty in the course of your celebrated History And though I am conscious of having left considerable gleanings to any who may be inclined to follow me I trust I have given you much reason to be sorry and more to be ashamed But whether my arguments will produce any such effects I really neither know nor care  Next to the civil history of a country an account of its language literature and poetry is both to natives and strangers the most interesting and important subject that can be conceived A subject which requires and deserves the greatest talents and most unremiting industry But this is a task for which you of all men who have ever pretended to write history are the least qualifyed Your language I confess is easy and elegant but your indolence in collecting and examining materials and beyond every thing your ignorance of the subject should have prevented you from engaging in a work of such great and general consequence in which whatever might be your progress how uninformed soever you might esteem the bulk of your readers you were certain at last of encountering detection and disgrace You have entitled your performance the HISTORY of English Poetry It is the extreme of  hyperbole  and a gross insult to common sense Could you flatter yourself  that your  calling  it a HISTORY would induce the public to accept it for one Alas what do they perceive but an injudicious  farrago  a  gallimawfry  of things which both do and do not belong to the subject thrown and jumbled together without system arrangement or perspicuity  a dark  Illimitable ocean without bound  Without dimension where length breadth and highth  And time and place are lost  The reader is bewildered in mazes he turns round and round and wanders backward and foreward and foreward and backward and at last finds hisself just where he set out heartyly tired and without anything to console him for the tediousness and labour of the journeyunless he can pick a flower or two for flowers there certainly are from amongst the numerous weeds and briars which intercept his passage and entangle his footsteps Want of method however is the least fault of which you can be accused If your collections had been authentic though of theirselves no history nor capable in your hands of becoming one they might at least have been useful to some subsequent writer better qualifyed for the purpose But we see as has been here sufficiently proved you are not to be relyed on in a single instance the work being a continued tissue of falsehood from beginning to end Suffer me as a friendto your subject at leastto recommend it to you to take all the advice and assistance you can get from the most able literary characters who may be willing to render you either and immediately set abous a diligent revisal and correction  I would likewise wish you to be convinced of another fault which ought to be carefully rooted out I mean your fulsome and disgusting  Egotism  There is some difference between the  History of English Portry  and the  Life and Opinions of Thomas Warton  of your three volumes already published deferring the remainder of the work till it be worthy of the light do justice to those writers to whom you have been actually indebted and omit that which is unnecessary and which you have from the vilest motive inserted merely to extend and enlarge the work even if by so doing your three volumes should be reduced to two That the work may not remain a monument of disgrace to yourself and your country Of all men living the learned and intelligent editor of The CANTERBURY TALES is the best able to afford you the requisite help and surely in a matter of such universal concern if you apply to him with sincerity he will not withhold it His publication of Chaucer is the most erudite curious and valuable performance that excepting onely that mine of literary treasure Dr Hickeses Thesaurus which never had nor ever will have its equal has yet appeared in this country I do not however mean to pronounce it entirely faultless It undoubtedly contains some mistakes  Such as his supposing Chaucers lines to contain eleven syllables an idea as just as that and make his adopting and misspelling certain words contrary to the evidence of all the MSS he consulted a few erroneous notions with respect to Chaucers language and the nature and history of the English tonguewith some others perhaps of still less consequence From all which however it is to be wished so excellent a work were totally free'd  but they are very few and being  chiefly confined to matter of opinion will be thought rather trifleing than important rather innocent than dangerous Even the  errors  of SUCH MEN are intitled to respect And for the later periods of our literary history who is there so well informed so judicious or so liberal as the worthy and amiable writer of the "Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare" Thus assisted Mr Warton you might probably render your work in reality what you have had the modesty to entitle it Not that I have after all the slightest expectation of your taking any further trouble about the matter unless indeed the sale of the revised work should appear likely to produce you some considerable advantage However you are equally obliged to me for my good advice whether you embrace it or not And as I am satisfyed that you will continue to write upon the subject so long as you can find materials however flimsy or purchasers however simple I beg leave to recommend to a respectable department in your  seventh  volume or rather to a volume or two of its own a Virgin Article for which I have highest regardThe Poetical Annals of the British NurseryWith two learned DiffertationsI On the origin and use of the ancient  Lullabies  II On the GESTA ROMANORUM of the NurseryMother Goose's Tales You could not reasonably desire a more ample field for the display of your amazing erudition in all its branches Your "episode" and the more "disproportionate" it is the better on a theatre which as you very justly observe is "of the lowest species and the highest antiquity" will be allowed to comprehend the whole history of the genuine mode of scenic representiation from Thespis to Flockton interspersed with a variety of surprising observations and unheared of facts These will eke out many a loose and easy page while your disquisitions upon Puerile Architecture or the art of constructing Castles of Cards will not onely involve the rise progress and grand arcana of Freemasonry which are all comprised in this curious and antique process but give you at the same time a fine opportunity of exhibiting your whole fund of knowlege in the science of which you have induced us to believe that you are perfect master and by not writing at least not publishing your promised work have been wise enough not to undeceive us One cannot easyly imagine a more pleasing or fruitful subject nor a historian better qualifyed to do it justice unless indeed your want of fidelity and care may be thought an insuperable objection But I am not without hope that even the present address will have the good fortune to make you a little more cautious on those heads in your future lucubrations  I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient and most humble servant
