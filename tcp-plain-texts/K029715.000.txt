 CALVARY OR THE DEATH OF CHRIST  CALVARY OR THE DEATH OF CHRIST A POEM IN EIGHT BOOKS  BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND  LONDON PRINTED FOR C DILLY IN THE POULTRY MDCCXCII  CALVARY OR  THE DEATH OF CHRIST  BOOK I  THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK  After a short introduction which states the miraculous acts of Christ and serves to mark the period at which the Poem commences Satan goes forth by night into the wilderness and finds himself in the very spot where he had in vain practised his temptations upon Christ Here he falls into meditation upon that unsuccessful interview and vents himself in soliloquy Indignant under disappointment and impatient to repair his defeat he ascends to the summit of the mountain from whence he had exhibited the kingdoms of the earth and calls the Devils from all parts of the Heathen world The whole host of Infernals assemble at his summons The chief leaders are enumerated their persons and attributes described Satan addresses them and proposes the subject matter for their consultation namely By what means to counteract the power of Christ upon earth Baal delivers his sentiments by stating difficulties and objections without any decided opinion unless for seduction in the general Moloch angrily resents what he considers as pointed at himself and speaks disdainfully against the proposal of seduction as not only desperate but disgraceful Belial replies and after much circumlocution suggests a temptation to be set on foot by Mammon He is interrupted by Satan who reproves him for certain digressions in his speech but adopts his hint of employing Mammon and calls upon that evil Spirit to attempt the fidelity of Judas Iscariot whom he points out to him as the only one of the Disciples open to seduction Mammon at first affects to excuse himself from the undertaking but in conclusion accepts it and taking wing in presence of the whole applauding host sets out upon his embassy directing his course to the city of Jerusalem  CALVARY  BOOK I THE ASSEMBLING OF THE DEVILS  HAIL awful CALVARY forsaking now  Aonian haunts and the unhallow'd Nine  I visit thy sad mount and thence invite  The mournful echoes to my deepton'd harp  Hymning the whilst in solemn numbers praise  To God for mercies purchas'd by the death  Of that mysterious Being virginborn  Savior of lost mankind who on the cross  Lord though he be of life and one with God  In mortal pangs expir'd there to atone  For a degenerate world by his pure blood  To wash original corruption out  And rising victor from the grave dispel  Sin and it's offspring Death with all the train  Of idol gods usurping earth and heav'n  Now had the wond'rous acts by JESUS wrought  Spread wide his fame thro' all Judaea's realm  The leper cleans'd the blind to sight restor'd  The sick to health and ev'n the dead to life  Tho' warn'd to silence for his modest ear  Sought not the praise of men so much the more  Publish'd his mercies Daemons at his call  With horrid shrieks that testified his power  Came forth from men possest and fled his voice  Rebuk'd the seas and winds vast was the throng  That follow'd where he led and thousands found  In the waste wilderness mirac'lous food  They saw they marvel'd and of force confest  Messias in his power not so in form  For there no comeliness no outward grace  No princely state appear'd Slow to renounce  Illusions long indulg'd their wavering minds  'Twixt two opinions halted while in place  Of these bright visions they beheld a man  Lowly and meek a houseless wanderer  That had not where on earth to lay his head  Such can our Israel's great Restorer be  Such our MessiasThus their troubled thoughts  Like meeting currents clash'd when as he spake  Truth flow'd resistless from his lips his eyes  Beam'd mercy and his Father's glory shone  Effulgent in his face then every tongue  Was hush'd to silence every doubt dispell'd  And every heart confess'd him Lord and Christ  'Twas night when SATAN prince of darkness call'd  And fitly call'd for evil hates the day  Walk'd forth on hellish meditation bent  Prowling the wilderness Where'er he trode  Earth quak'd beneath his foot before him roll'd  Thick cloud and vapour making night's dark shade  More black and terrible the beasts of prey  Every wild thing that roams the savage waste  And howling to the moon demands it's food  Fled his approach the lion and the pard  Scented the blast and slunk into their dens  For whilst his breast with raging passions boil'd  Hatred revenge and blasphemous despight  The sighs he vented from the hell within  Breath'd death into the air his haggard eyes  Which still in speechless agonies he roll'd  Outglar'd the hyaena's other fires than their's  To light his dismal path he needed none  Now having stretch'd athwart the sandy wild  Clear to its rocky verge the Archfiend paus'd  And upward cast his eye if haply there  Darkling he might discern what saucy mound  Dar'd to arrest his course for yet there dwelt  Such vigor in his wing nor depth nor heighth  Mountains nor seas might check his bold career  Were he so purpos'd neither would he deign  To ask one charitable star for light  Thoughtful of former glory when he soar'd  Son of the morning far above their spheres  Whereat he 'gan put forth his plumed vans  From either shoulder stretcht for flight when soon  The fuel'd clouds to fierce encounter rush'd  Loud thunders bellow'd and the lightning's flash  Smote on the craggy cliff at sight whereof  Conscious that now he press'd the fatal spot  Where late he commun'd with the Son of God  Who for the space of forty days and nights  Foil'd ev'ry vain device with shame abash'd  And pondering in his mind his foul defeat  Down down at once his flagging pinions fell  Close cow'ring to his ribs As some proud ship  Between the tropics o'er th' Atlantic wave  Speeding amain to reach her destin'd port  If chance th' experienc'd mariner espies  The gathering hurricane no stay no stop  Quick to the yard each swelling sail is furl'd  The curl'd waves whitening as the torrent drives  And soon her taunt and lofty topmast lower'd  Strikes to the gale so he his towering heighth  That to angelic stature now had swell'd  Shrunk into human size nor other seem'd  Than pilgrim squalid and with years and toil  Bending decrepit when from his full heart  Words intermixt with groans thus forc'd their way  Yes hateful wilderness detested rocks  Whom I would curse had Nature left one blade  On your bare ribs which cursing I might blast  Full well I know you deep too deep engrav'd  On memory's tablet your rude horrors live  And you officious lightnings hide your fires  Come Night again let central darkness shrowd  Scenes whose tormenting recollection stabs  My unavenged soul Can I forget  This Son of Joseph Son of God henceforth  Of force I must confess him for what less  Than godlike constancy could have withstood  Temptations great and terrible as mine  Something which man is not he needs must be  Virtue that angels boast not he must have  Else had my snares enclos'd him else the world  Which then was mine to give had been a bribe  Too glorious not to dazzle every eye  But his who made those glories what they are  Still I must doubt the Father's love sincere  Tho' loudly vouch'd by his own voice from heav'n  Is this a father's love is this his care  Here to expose him to this desart wild  Forty long sleepless nights and fasting days  No Angel guard about him lost forlorn  Abandon'd to the elements to beasts  More fierce than this loud storm nay fiercer still  To me than all more terrible to me  Foe of his life inveterate and avow'd  Rare sample of God's love If here his CHRIST  Encounter'd aught of danger and if none  What else could prompt him to this vain display  Of voluntary penance but the love  Of flattery and a despicable wish  To hear himself applauded In this spot  Beneath the jutting roof of this rude cliff  I first surpriz'd this wand'ring Son of God  This Savior of the world Fainting he seem'd  With thirst and hunger pale as death his cheek  His hollow eyes deep sunk and from his brow  Big drops of sweat distill'd as one o'erspent  And sinking to the earth there to expire  A ready tale he had for pity's ear  A melancholy list of wants and woes  He had not tasted food and fairly own'd  That Nature's cravings were intense when I  Glad at the heart to find him thus besieg'd  With appetite so eager stooping down  From the dissever'd fragments that here lie  About the base of this stormbeaten rock  Chose out a few smooth stones and tempting said  If thou art hungry eat convert these stones  If thou art God's own Son to bread and eat  But he not so beguil'd spurn'd them away  And silenc'd me with text of holy writ  A nobler appetite I next assail'd  Ambition to the mountain's top we soar'd  I spread the kingdoms of the earth in sight  Fit sight to whet the hunger of the mind  But mind and body he alike would starve  Nor thank nor homage render back for food  Of my providing One last hope remain'd  Methought there was a godly pride about him  Which with right holy flattery I might win  Upon the temple's topmost pinnacle  I plac'd this scorner of an earthly crown  And bade him be a God Cast thyself down  Behold quoth I the Angels are on wing  To bear thee up unhurt With stern rebuke  Get thee behind me SATAN he replied  Some power unseen control'd me down I fell  Down from the giddy eminence I plung'd  And left him to his Angels whilst their hymns  And halelujahs echo'd through the air  His triumphs and my second fall from heav'n  And now if dark despair shall reach this heart  Which of hell's tetrarchs can arraign their king  Or fix on me his share of public loss  And overthrow sustain'd in this attack  None for none dare If I till now supreme  Great idol of the Gentile world for whom  So many groves so many altars blaze  If I to whom by various names ador'd  Thousands of temples rife whilst one alone  One solitary pile on Sion's hill  Echoes the praise of God neglected else  Of all if I if SATAN must submit  To CHRIST revenge to patience war to peace  And men must learn new maxims of forgiveness  Maxims I neither practise nor instil  Heroes and kings and conquerors farewell  Greater is he who serves than he who reigns  To suffer to submit to turn the cheek  To the proud smiter these are virtues now  Hence with such virtues If these rules obtain  If this tame doctrine shall unman the world  Altars and groves and temples all must sink  Olympus and its synod every Grace  And every Muse all that the chissel wrought  In Greece or Rome shall moulder into dust  And CHRIST and Reason shall usurp the world  He ceas'd and now his swelling bosom heav'd  With indignation like the labouring earth  Which subterranean vapors undermine  Pent in it's sulph'rous entrails Up he sprung  To that high mountain top whence he review'd  The kingdoms of the earth whilst at his side  CHRIST's humble virtue stood on other realms  Realms of immortal happiness intent  Here as a vulture on the craggy peak  Of Caucasus or Haemus left to watch  Screams out his shrill alarm at sound whereof  The carrion troop upon the wing for prey  Come flocking to the signal SATAN thus  Stood eminent and call'd his dark compeers  So loud he call'd that to the farthest bounds  Of Pagan isle or continent was heard  His voice reechoing thro' the vault of heav'n  Heroes and demigods Olympian powers  Infernal princes of hell's dark abyss  Heav'n's exiles spirits of air water fire  Or whatsoever element confines  Your incorporeal effences Oh hear  Hear and assemble 'tis your leader calls  It is your champion's voice in happier hours  Heard and obey'd now in extremest need  Be present and assist our great divan  No more for soon was heard the distant sound  Of wings that beat the air from every point  Of the four winds the gathering swarm came on  From Grete from Cyprus and the Ionian coast  From Egypt Afric and the Ausonian shores  Gods of all names dimensions and degrees  Great was their sovereign's triumph to behold  This prompt obedience to his high command  For now descending on the desart heath  To martial music the infernal host  In bands and columns by their chiefs arrang'd  Stood firm if ever gleam of joy might reach  Heart so accurs'd the Archfiend had felt it here  As with a monarch's eye he now review'd  His armies covering all the swarthy plain  Come Muse and to your suppliant's eyes impart  One ray of that pure light which late you pour'd  On the dark orbs of your immortal Bard  Eclips'd by drop serene Conduct me now  Me from my better days of bold emprize  Far in decline and with the hoary hand  Of Time hard stricken yet adventuring forth  O'er Nature's limits into worlds unseen  Peopled with shadowy forms and phantoms dire  Oh bear me on your pinions in this void  Where weary foot ne'er rested and behold  All hell bursts forth Support me or I sink  Now glimm'ring twilight streak'd the Eastern sky  For he that on his forehead brings the morn  Starcrowned PHOSPHORUS had heard the call  And with the foremost stood Beside him one  Of towering stature and majestic port  Himself a host his black and curling locks  Down his herculean shoulders copious flow'd  In glittering brass upon his shield he bore  A kingly eagle ensign of command  BAAL his name second to none in state  Save only his great chieftain worshipp'd long  In Babylon till Daniel drove him thence  With all his gluttonous priests exalted since  High above all the idol gods of Greece  Thron'd on Olympus and his impious hand  Arm'd with the thunder yet he ru'd the zeal  Of furious Jehu and that mournful day  When he beheld his altars stream with blood  His prophets and his priests by hundreds slain  Upon Mount Carmel MOLOCH in the van  Mail'd at all points for war with spear and helm  And plumed crest and garments roll'd in blood  Flam'd like a meteor Him with horrid joy  SATAN awhile survey'd then sighing cried  Oh worthy of command had all like thee  So bravely fought heav'n never had been lost  Thence as he glanc'd his eye far other form  And much unfit for war he next espied  CHEMOS the sin of Moab power obscene  Emasculate and soft in loose attire  A sensual deity his glory 'twas  In arts of base seduction to excel  And leagu'd with harlots to have turn'd the heart  Of that wise king and drawn him from his God  To bend his aged knees at idol shrines  Close at his side stood one in whose soft eyes  Ensnaring smiles and beauteous ruin lurk'd  Oh that such grace should be allied to sin  Zidonian goddess ASHTORETH her name  Heav'n would not quite destroy so fair a work  But wantonness usurp'd an angel face  And with her innocence had chang'd her sex  Yet let that sex beware for in their souls  When once she enters peace no longer dwells  Witness that Magdalen whose frantic breast  Till by CHRIST's mercy heal'd sev'n daemons rent  All sinbegotten all her brood accurst  BUT SATAN whose stern heart stranger to love  All weakness tho' in shape of sin disdain'd  And only priz'd spirits more like himself  Indignant turn'd aside and bent his eye  Where DAGON giant god amidst the ranks  Like Teneriff or Aetna proudly tower'd  DAGON of Gath and Askalon the boast  In that sad flight when on Gilboa's mount  The shield of Saul was vilely thrown away  And Israel's beauty perish'd Him awhile  With scowling eye the infernal king survey'd  Then taunting cried O DAGON vast in size  In soul diminutive had that huge mass  Valour proportionate heav'n had been our's  But fitter thou dull spirit to people hell  Than reassault God's throne Where was thy pride  When overthrown in Gaza by the strength  Of that uxorious Danite Humbled now  I know thy nightly haunts and how thou driv'st  Wretches possest to hide themselves in tombs  Whence I beheld thee 'midst the herd unclean  Scour down the steep and plunge into the sea  But now a fairer form arrests the eye  Of hell's despotic lord his radiant vest  Of Tyrian purple studded thick with gems  Flow'd graceful He for courts was form'd for feasts  For ladies chambers and for amorous sports  He lov'd not camps nor the rude toils of war  BELIAL his name around his temples twin'd  A wreath of roses and where'er he pass'd  His garments fann'd a breeze of rich perfume  No ear had he for the shrilltoned trump  Him the soft warble of the Lydian flute  Delighted rather the lovesoothing harp  Sappho's loose song and the Aonian Maids  And zoneless Graces floating in the dance  Yet from his lips sweet eloquence distill'd  As honey from the bee but still his voice  Ne'er counsell'd aught but cunning and deceit  Mean truce and base capitulating terms  Therefore by SATAN held in slight account  For devils affect a dignity in sin  Last in the field and from the rest apart  Was MAMMON cautious was his step and slow  His eye still watchful to prevent surprize  Squalid his vesture and his locks uncomb'd  For gain and usury engross'd his soul  Nor other care had he but to amass  Wealth unenjoy'd and gloat upon his hoard  Had there been only happiness in heav'n  And gold in hell MAMMON had spurn'd the bliss  And hugg'd the treasure cheaply earn'd with pain  His princes thus review'd from the hill top  SATAN swiftglancing flew and in the midst  Rose like a meteor whereat all the host  Sent up a general shout he with his hand  Gave sign and wheel'd the Stygian phalanx round  Horrible sight A theatre of fiends  And each the foe of man idols and imps  Wizzards familiars sprites phantasmas dreams  Sorrows and pains and deaths in every shape  Cover'd the blasted heath Th' infernal king  Tho' in his heart by mutinous passions torn  Thought clash'd with thought and all was anarchy  Yet with assum'd composure beck'ning forth  His princes whilst th' inferior throng stood off  And mute attention reign'd in few thus spake  Friends and confederates welcome for this proof  Of your affiance thanks On every call  Whether we need your counsel or your arms  Joyful I see your ready zeal displays  Virtues which hell itself cannot corrupt  I mean not to declame The occasion told  Speaks its own import and the time's dispatch  All waste of words forbids God's Son on earth  CHRIST the reveal'd Messias how to oppose  Is now the question by what force or power  Temptations have been tried I name not them  Or dark conspiracy we may pull down  This sun of righteousness from his bright sphere  Declare who can I pause for a reply  Silence ensu'd whilst every eye was turn'd  Instinctively on BAAL he of all  Hell's magi fill'd the seat of wisdom chief  Experienc'd long in craft and nothing apt  To give strait counsel slow of speech he was  To hint propound dilate and so entice  Other opinions forth them to refute  And thereon build his own was all his art  After long pause and hesitation feign'd  Stale trick of orators he thus began  Why thus on me as I were worthy me  Lost being like yourselves as I alone  Cou'd compass this high argument on me  Least in your sapient conclave why you point  These scrutinizing looks I muse and aw'd  By this your expectation fain wou'd shrink  From the great task to silence had you not  O'er these poor faculties such full controul  As to put by all pleas and call them forth  In heav'n or earth or hell's profound abyss  Your's in all uses present at all hours  Our kingly chief hath told us we are met  To combat CHRIST on earth Be't so We yet  May try our fortune in another field  Worse fortune than in heav'n befell our arms  Worse downfall than to hell we cannot prove  But with the scene our action too must change  How to what warfare Circumvention fraud  Seduction these are earthly weapons these  As man to man opposes so must we  To CHRIST incarnate There be some who cry  Hence with such dastard arts War open war  I honor such bold counsellors and yield  All that I can my praise till one be found  One that may rival God's own Son in power  And miracle to miracle oppose  More than my praise I cannot my assent  I will not give 'twere madness And how war  With God what arms may we employ 'gainst him  Whose very prophets can call down heaven's fires  Upon our priests and altars For myself  What powers I had I shall not soon forget  What I have left I know and for your use  Shall husband as I may not vainly risque  Where they must surely fail The Jews pretend  That CHRIST colludes with Belzebub the Jews  As far mistake my nature as my name  The fallacy O peers confutes itself  Forg'd to disparage CHRIST not honor me  Oh that I had his wonderworking powers  I'm not that fool to turn them on myself  No my brave friends I've yet too much to lose  Though Babylon's proud shrines are laid in dust  Rome's capitol survives and thro' the world  Where'er her eagles fly upon their wings  They bear my thunder and they spread my fame  Therefore no more of Belzebub and CHRIST  No league no compact can we hold together  What then ensues Despair Perish the thought  The brave renounce it and the wise prevent  You are both wise and brave Our leader says  Temptations have been tried and tried in vain  Himself the tempter Who will tread that ground  Where he was foil'd For Adam a mere toy  An apple serv'd CHRIST is not brib'd by worlds  So much the second Man exceeds the first  In strength and glory But tho' CHRIST himself  Will not be tempted those who hear him may  Jews may be urg'd to envy to revenge  To murder a rebellious race of old  To kill a prophet or betray his God  What Jew was ever found to need the spur  Wist ye not what a train this preacher hath  What followers what disciples These are men  Mere men frail sons of Adam born in sin  Here is our hope I leave it to your thoughts  He ceas'd but neither murmur nor applause  Follow'd his speech for MOLOCH whose fell heart  Ill stomach'd this tame counsel least of all  Taunts thinly cover'd under mask of praise  Sprung forth impetuous and with scowling brow  And accent acrimonious thus replied  My thoughts it seems are known before I speak  War open war is all my note I rise  To thank the prophet who thus reads my heart  Where honesty shou'd wear it in my face  That face from danger I did never hide  How then from him Nor am I by his praise  More honor'd than by his dissenting voice  For whilst he counsels circumvention fraud  Seductionif my memory wrongs his words  I yield it to correctionwe stand off  Wide as the poles apart Much I had hop'd  When the great Tempter fail'd and in your ears  Sung his own honor's dirge we had heard the last  Of plots and mean temptations mean I call them  For great names cannot sanctify mean deeds  SATAN himself knows I oppos'd the attempt  Appeal'd protested my thricehonor'd chief  Knows it full well and blushes for th' event  And are we now caballing how to outwit  A few poor harmless fishermen for such  Are CHRIST's disciples how to gull and cheat  Their simple hearts of honesty Oh peers  For shame if not for pity leave them that  That beggar's virtue And is this the theme  The mighty theme which now employs the thoughts  Of your immortal synod Shame Oh shame  Princes Dominions Archangelic Thrones  Imperial Lords these were your titles once  By these names ye were known above the stars  Shame not your antient dignities nor sink  Beneath the vilest of the sons of men  Whisperers informers spies If CHRIST be God  Fight as becometh you to fight with God  If man and sure his birth bespeaks no more  Why all this preparation this consult  These mighty machinations and cabals  Off with your foe at once dismiss him hence  Where all his brother prophets have been sent  Where his precursor John is gone before  Whose voice still echoes thro' this wilderness  "Repent ye for God's kingdom is at hand  "Prepare ye the Lord's way"It is prepar'd  It leads to death it marshals him the road  To that oblivious bourne whence none return  Herod yet lives another royal feast  Another wanton dance and he for whom  So many innocents were slain shall fall  Once vanquish'd are we therefore to despair  In heav'n unequal battle we provok'd  Tho' vast our host the million was with God  On earth enquire of all the nations round  Whom they will serve with one voice they reply  We are their gods they feed us with their blood  Their sons and daughters they make pass through fire  To do us grace if their own flesh they give  Shall they withhold to sacrifice a foe  Twelve tribes were all Jehovah had on earth  And ten are lost of this small remnant few  And wretched are the friends that league with Heav'n  And where is now CHRIST's promis'd reign on earth  When God's own servants rise against his Son  And those to whom the promises were giv'n  Revolt from their Messias can we wish  Greater revenge What need have we to tempt  Them who have hearts rebellious as our own  As prompt to malice no less prone to vex  God's righteous spirit And let come what may  It comes not to our loss rather our gain  Let God arise to vengeance let him pour  Destruction on his temple whose proud heighth  Our chief can witness measur'd by his fall  Let him not leave one stone upon another  As his rash Son hath menac'd let his wrath  Thro' all the inhospitable earth disperse  His scatter'd tribes such ever be the fate  Of all his worshippers May scorn contempt  Derision be their lot and may their God  Never recall his curse Are we O peers  To mourn for his Jerusalem Our joy  Springs from confusion enmity 'twixt God  And man is our best triumph For myself  War is my harvest then my altars blaze  Brightest when human victims feed the flame  Breathless he paus'd so rapid was the pulse  Of his highbeating heart he stood as one  Choak'd and convuls'd with rage when as he ceas'd  He smote his mailed habergeon so loud  Hell's armed legions heard and shook their spears  Betok'ning war Frowning he look'd around  Whilst from his fiery eyes such terror glanc'd  It seem'd as if his pride meant to abash  And silence all opposers Yet not long  His triumph for now BELIAL from the ranks  Graceful advanc'd and as he put aside  His purple robe in act to speak the throng  Such was the dazzling beauty of his form  Fell back a space then stood all eyes and ears  In expectation mute as death Though hell  Own'd not a spirit more false sensual and base  Yet ever as he spake such action grac'd  His words so musically soft they flow'd  Who most despis'd the pleader prais'd the speech  When thus with mild insinuating looks  Masking his rancorous heart the Fiend began  After so many peaceful ages past  Since first emerging from hell's dark abyss  Rous'd by our Archangelic Chief we sprung  Up to this middle region and here seiz'd  On this terrestrial globe created first  For man our vassal now where at full ease  Lords of the elements and gods ador'd  We reign and revel undisturb'd of Heav'n  If God whose jealousy be sure ill brooks  That this fair world should be so long possess'd  Of us his exil'd angels and his name  Pent up in Palestine should now arouse  His slumb'ring wrath and his best strength put forth  To wrestle for lost empire and our earth  As we in evil hour his heav'n assail  Who of this mighty synod but must own  The provocation warrants the retort  If then the Maker of mankind hath cause  To meditate their rescue we no less  Have cause to oppose th' attempt and hold them fast  To their allegiance in despite of Heav'n  Much then we owe to our great Leader's care  Which ever watchful o'er the public weal  Calls us to this full council here to meet  In grave consult how best we may repair  Past disappointments and repel the spite  Of this new Champion levell'd at our shrines  Great is the trouble of my thoughts O peers  And much perplex'd am I with doubts what name  Nature and office to ascribe to CHRIST  In form the lowliest of the sons of men  In miracles omnipotent as God  Whose voice controuls the stoutest of our host  Bids the graves open and their dead come forth  Whose very touch is health who with a glance  Pervades each heart absolves it or condemns  Whose virgin birth credulity scarce owns  And Nature disavows Prais'd to all time  Immortal as himself be the renown  Of that wise spirit who shall devise the means  By force or fraud to overthrow the power  Of this mysterious foe what shall I say  Priest Prophet King Messias Son of God  Yet how God's unity which well we know  Endures no second should adopt a Son  And essence indivisible divide  Baffles my weak conjecture Let that pass  To such hard doctrines I subscribe no faith  I'll call him man inspir'd and wait till death  Gives sentence of mortality upon him  Meanwhile let circumspection on our part  Fill all the anxious interim alarm  Rome's jealousy stir up the captious spleen  Of the proud Pharisee beset him round  With snares to catch him urge the envious priests  For envy still beneath the altar lurks  And note the man he trusts MAMMON could tell  Though MAMMON boasts not of his own success  How few of human mould have yet withstood  His glittering golden lures The sword can kill  Man's body gold destroys his very soul  Yet mark me well I counsel not to tempt  The Master poverty can do no more  Than his own mortifying penance does  Hunger and thirst and obstinately starve  When his mere wish could make the rock a spring  And its hard fragments bread Yet sure I am  All are not CHRIST's in heart who with their lips  Confess him these are men and therefore frail  Frail and corruptible And let none say  Fear prompts this counsel I disclaim all fear  But for the general cause In every heart  Nature hath built my altar every sect  Nation and language with one voice confess  Pleasure the sovereign good The Stoic churl  The dogged Cynic snarling in his tub  And all the ragged moralizing crew  Are hypocrites philosophy itself  Is but my votary beneath a cloak  It harms not me though every idol God  Were tumbled from his base alike I scorn  Sampson's strong nerve and Daniel's flaming zeal  And let CHRIST preach his mortifying rules  Let him go forth through all the Gentile world  And on the ruin of our fanes erect  His church triumphant o'er the gates of hell  Still still man's heart will draw the secret sigh  For pleasures unenjoy'd the gloomy cell  And melancholy fast the midnight prayer  And pale contrition weeping o'er her lamp  Are penances from which the sense revolts  Fines that compounding superstition pays  For pleasures past or bribes for more to come  Enough of this vain boast here SATAN cried  More than enough of these voluptuous strains  Which tho' they lull the ear disarm the soul  Of its best attribute Not gaudy flowers  Are cull'd for med'cine but the humble weed  True wisdom ever frugal of her speech  Gives sage advice in plain and homely words  The sum of all our reasoning ends in this  That nothing but the death of CHRIST can solve  The mystery of his nature till he falls  Scarce can I say we stand All voices then  Though varying in the means conspire his death  Some cautiously as BAAL some with zeal  Precipitate as MOLOCH whose swift thought  Vaults over all impediments to seize  The goal of his ambition But O peers  Our's is no trivial care direct your sight  Along the ranks of that redeemed host  On us hangs all their safety Night and day  My anxious thoughts are labouring in their cause  And whilst CHRIST walks the earth I take no rest  A watchful spy for ever at his side  Noting each word and deed sometimes I mix  With the selected Twelve that page his steps  Of these though some have waver'd none is false  Save one alone ISCARIOT he by name  The taint of avarice hath touch'd his heart  I've mark'd him for my own Hear princes hear  This night the priests and elders will convene  Their secret conclave I am in their hearts  Burning with envy malice and revenge  Their only thought is how to tangle CHRIST  In whom of force I own no guile is found  But gentleness instead and perfect truth  A lamb in nature without spot and pure  Fit victim therefore for their Paschal rites  Which now are near at hand apt is the hour  Apt are the instruments What now remains  But to send forth a tempter to persuade  ISCARIOT to betray his Master's life  And damn himself for gold Speak is there one  One in this patriot circle whom all eyes  Point out for this emprize Most sure there is  BELIAL hath well predicted of our choice  MAMMON stand forth On thee th' election lights  He spake and all approv'd for choice so fit  None could oppose when MAMMON thus replied  Prince of this world To whom these armies owe  Lost but for thee in everlasting night  The glorious prospect of yon rising sun  'Tis not to evade the labor but prevent  The failure of your hopes that I beseech  Your wisdom to correct it's choice and lodge  This arduous embassy in abler hands  Nathless if such your will and my compeers  Adjudge me to this service I submit  In me is no repugnance no delay  For ever what these toiling hands could do  Or patient thoughts devise that I have done  Whether in heav'n ordain'd to undermine  God's adamantine throne or doom'd to dig  The solid sulphur of hell's burning soil  Fearless I wrought and were there no tongues else  To vouch my services these scars would speak  How many daintier spirits do I see  Fair as in heav'n and in fresh bloom of youth  Whilst I with shrivel'd sinews cramp'd and scorch'd  'Midst pestilential damps and fiery blasts  Drag as you see a miserable load  Agestruck without the last resource of death  This for myself no more You're not to know  The snares which I employ are golden snares  These are my arts and like the crafty slave  Who in Rome's Circus hurls the fatal net  Over his fierce pursuer so oft times  Have I entangled the proud hearts of men  And made their courage stoop to shameful bribes  Paid for dishonest deeds perjuries and plots  That draw them off from God who else had fill'd  His courts ere now with guests and peopled heav'n  These weapons and these hands you still command  So dear I hold the general cause at heart  So disciplin'd am I in duty's school  That reckless of all hazard I present  Myself your servant or if so fate wills  Your sacrifice for though from mortal man  Discomfiture I dread not yet if CHRIST  Whom the great Tempter foil'd not shall stand forth  The champion of his follower witness for me  You my brave peers and this angelic host  I sought not this bold heighth whence if I fall  I do but fall where SATAN could not stand  Go then exclaim'd th' ArchEnemy of man  Go brave adventurer go where glory calls  Auspicious thoughts engender in my breast  And now prophetic visions burst upon me  I see the traitor JUDAS with a band  Of midnight ruffians seize his peaceful Lord  They drag him to the bar accuse condemn  He bleeds he dies Darkness involves the rest  Ascend the air brave spirit and 'midst the shout  Of grateful myriads wing thy course to fame  He said and pointing to the sacred towers  Of God's high temple wav'd his sceptred hand  Whereat the infernal armies gave a shout  That shook the rocky desart to its base  Meanwhile the fiend ambassador of hell  Exulting heard his high election crown'd  With these applauding voices and the call  Of his great Chieftain echo'd to the skies  Pride swell'd his conscious breast no longer now  Crouching with age and pain but nerv'd anew  As with a spell transform'd erect he stood  With towering stature tallest of the throng  And looks of high supremacy and state  And now from either shoulder he unfurl'd  His widestretch'd pinions and uprising swift  Tower'd in midair the host with loud acclaim  Hail'd his ascent he on the wellpois'd wing  Hoverd awhile till from his cloudy heighth  Sweeping the wide horizon he descried  Far in the west the holy city of God  His destin'd port then to the orient sun  Turn'd his broad vans and plied their utmost speed  END OF THE FIRST BOOK  CALVARY OR  THE DEATH OF CHRIST  BOOK II  THE ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK  Mammon alighting on the Holy Mount assumes the form and character of a Levite and under that appearance goes in search of Judas Iscariot He meets that disciple most opportunely for his purpose in a solitary place and entering into conversation with him pretends a commission from the priests and elders for engaging him in their service with the promise of a reward and urges many insidious arguments for detaching him from his Master They separate with a promise on the part of Judas to report his final answer to the priests that evening Christ is now brought to view sitting in the midst of his disciples at his Last Supper He addresses them in those solemn and affecting terms recorded in the Gospel of Saint John washes their feet foretells his death and points out to them his betrayer in the person of Judas then present The traitor perceiving himself discovered hastily departs Christ pitying the affliction of his disciples tenderly consoles them with the promise of his support under their future tribulations and concludes with an aweful invocation to the Father in their behalf whereupon warning them that his hour is come he goes forth to the garden A reflection naturally springing from the subject addressed to unbelievers closes the book  CALVARY  BOOK II THE LAST SUPPER  NOW on the consecrated Mount of God  MAMMON invisible to mortal eye  Stooping the wing from his aerial heighth  With feet unhallow'd lands a direful pest  Farthest from heav'n of all that outcast crew  Who fell from bliss fit messenger was he  And fatal was their choice who sent him forth  To work corruption's purpose in man's heart  For in his pow'r excelling he can take  The semblance of each virtue shift each form  And turn and turn new faces on the world  Till he hath snar'd a soul then he appears  In nature as he is loathsome obscene  Rapacious as those filthy monsters feign'd  By fabling poets of amphibious breed  Harpies of earth and ocean the foul spawn  Half brute half human with cadaverous face  Horribly pale and hollow hungry eye  Glaring aghast with wings outstretch'd to chace  And talons crook'd to pounce their mangled prey  And now by dev'lish spell transform'd he seems  A reverend Levite bearded to the waist  Hypocrisy ne'er wore a graver mask  And still with wolflike watch he prowls around  If haply in those haunts he might surprize  Occasion to put forth his damning arts  And from the flock of their good Shepherd cull  One tainted straggler one whose sordid soul  Avarice might tempt to take the price of blood  And sacrifice the Son of God for gold  Of CHRIST no care had he but to elude  His vigilance which still was all his dread  Nor of the Twelve save JUDAS was there one  Whom to assail on him alone on him  Son of perdition rested all the hopes  Of SATAN and his legions Now the fiend  With ineffectual search had coasted all  The sacred region round and in the shade  Beneath the temple porch awhile repos'd  List'ning the converse of the idle crowd  The sun then high at noon and much they talk'd  Of CHRIST and his great miracles of some  Elias deem'd of some the Baptist John  Ris'n from the dead but by all tongues confest  A prophet mighty both in word and deed  Silent the whilst in secret musings wrapt  The wizard spirit stood when all at once  Loud voices strike his ear and strait comes one  Leaping and bounding 'midst the shouting throng  A cripple new restor'd the very bed  Which from his birth the palsied wretch had press'd  Now in it's turn was carried and to all  Triumphantly expos'd Behold he cried  The token of my cure I am the man  Whom ye all knew and this the doleful bed  On which fast bound in misery and pain  Helpless before your charitable gates  I laid and begg'd for pity and relief  Lo I am free Mark how these newfound limbs  Nimbly the healthrestoring voice obey  CHRIST gave the word he spake and I am whole  This whilst he heard conviction smote the fiend  His conscious heart a sudden tremor seiz'd  And off he slunk abash'd A winding path  Led down the mount and here as he pursued  In gloomy thought his solitary way  Behold by happy chance the man he sought  ISCARIOT and alone Joy flush'd the cheek  Of the incarnate daemon thus to find  His labour in auspicious moment crown'd  Hail son of Simon peace be to thee friend  Fairly encounter'd art thou in good hour  The priestlike Tempter cried thy worth is known  To all our Levites from whose tribe I come  With friendly greeting charg'd This night they meet  In special conclave our chief pontiff there  Will in the holy convocation move  Points of high import to our antient law  Questions it much importeth thee to hear  And well accepted shalt thou be of all  Who with large recompence and honors due  Will greet thee so complying I have said  Grave Sir I know thee not JUDAS replied  Yet for thy greeting thanks and peace for peace  As holy men becomes To him the fiend  Unknown I well may be who night and day  Serving God's altar rarely stir abroad  And little commerce hold with this great world  But thee I know one of that Teacher's train  Who walks at large nor shuns the haunts impure  Of sinners and of publicans Alas  That one of thy wise bearing should be seen  In such base fellowship paging his steps  Calling him Lord and Master whom the world  In mere derision suffers to grow up  To fullblown vanity at once to crush  But good report is pregnant with thy name  As one exempted from the general scorn  And sure I am thou wilt not so abase  And lower thy nobler thoughts to one so mean  Vile and mechanic to the driv'ling crew  Of children and of women leave that task  To Peter and his brethren of the net  Fine reas'ning we shall have and well be school'd  When fishermen turn preachers and instill  Doctrines and laws which Moses never taught  Woe to our scribes Rare mockery of the world  And the world's wisdom if these simple folk  Lur'd from their daily drudgery should set up  Fishers of men the synagogue to them  A barren element will never yield  Such gainful earnings as the sea affords  And what is CHRIST that JUDAS so should court  His starving service What so tempting lure  Hath this deceiver to beguile thy hopes  Not of this world my kingdom he hath said  Yet of this world are we in this alone  We live and move here only we expect  Or pain or pleasure all that lies beyond  In the unknown abyss is dark as death  And wherefore carriest thou that bag about  A beggar needs no treasurer and thy Lord  Feeds but by miracle Alas for him  Who serves a master that keeps Sabbath fasts  Forty long days in the bare wilderness  Makes poverty his passport into heav'n  And bids us throw away life's present means  For doubtful chance of interest after life  And art thou of all reason so bereft  As to account prosperity a crime  Or think none blest but him whose every step  Through misery's thorny path is mark'd with blood  O son of Simon take thy last resolve  Either resign thy body to the worm  And die with CHRIST or him renounce and live  Rich honor'd prosperous and enjoy the world  The Fiend now paus'd well pleas'd that he had gain'd  Audience so large when JUDAS in whose soul  The pois'nous instillation 'gan to work  Thus to corruption's advocate replied  That CHRIST rejected and despis'd of men  Hath in this world no part I freely grant  Therefore if we his followers who renounce  Things present build our hopes upon a dream  Of what shall never come we are of all  Most miserable if we who bid farewel  To all that Nature holds most dear to share  Sorrows and pains and poverty with CHRIST  Find not those blissful mansions in the heav'n  Which he hath promis'd if when all is past  And this sad scene concludes no reck'ning comes  No grateful compensation after death  Hard is our fate and much hath he abus'd  Our weak credulity but still these hopes  Of an expected glory though with doubt  And darkness clouded faint yet not extinct  Yield not to words words made them what they are  CHRIST's words and surely man ne'er spake like him  Wherefore if these your doctors of the law  Invite me to their conclave but to hear  A railing accusation I hold off  From their assembly and to CHRIST adhere  As to the better reas'ner and though poor  The servant equal is the Master's lot  Poor as the poorest houseless and forlorn  A man of sorrows nor can we complain  Whilst he of all we suffer still partakes  First in all labours penances and pains  You ask and bid me take my last resolve  If I will give this body to the worm  And die with CHRIST To die is Nature's dread  Instinctively she loaths the gloomy grave  And turns a longing eye to light and life  But fortune gives to all things their degrees  To them who bask in sunshine thro' the day  Night comes with double sadness whilst to me  Who toil from morn to noon from noon to eve  Yet nothing but a dim horizon see  Low'ring in clouds darkness is nothing strange  Nor death a terror Wealth presents no dower  To wed me to the world no pleasures cling  Around my heart no soft affections woo  My longer stay on earth there to prefer  Brief joys possess'd to hope of future bliss  Thus whilst he 'plain'd the subtle Tempter's ear  Caught the soft murmur that betrays the soul  The sigh capitulating virtue breathes  When from her last defences she retreats  Whereat a bolder tone he now assum'd  And thus the wav'ring false disciple plied  All joys that gold can purchase wait your choice  Rich to your heart's ambition you shall be  Nor only rich but rescued from a doom  So dreadful had you all the wealth in store  Which the sea covers or the earth contains  'Twere well bestow'd to purchase your redemption  With CHRIST impending death with me you meet  Life with encircling pleasures Throw aside  That beggar's purse your starving office spurn  Serve God's high priest whose treasury is full  Cast those few mites away the scanty dole  Of some contaminating leper's hand  For which you bid God heal him and pass on  Whilst he good cred'lous soul cries out amain  As powerful fancy works Lo I am clean  Behold a miracle But gold performs  Greater and happier miracles than this  Gold with a touch can heal the mind's disease  Quicken the slowpac'd blood and make it dance  In tides of rapture through each thrilling vein  Cast out that worst of daemons poverty  And with a spell exorcise the sad heart  Haunted with spectres of despair and spleen  If then this prize can tempt thee if thy soul  Still thirsts for life for riches for repose  If in thy breast there dwells that manly scorn  Which slighted merit feels when envious pride  Thrusts it aside to build th' unworthy up  Now now assert it from a Master turn  Who turns from thee who before thee exalts  Thy meaner brethren Peter James and John  On them his partial smile for ever beams  They have his love his confidence his heart  Of them revolting he might well complain  Of thee he cannot thine were just revenge  He is no traitor who resents a wrong  Who shares no confidence can break no trust  Bid conscience then be still let no weak qualms  Damp thy reviving spirit but when night  Wraps her dark curtain round this busy world  Come thou to CAIAPHAS there will be found  Our priests and scribes in council to attaint  And bring to judgment this presumptuous man  Who boasts himself Messias Son of God  If thou to whom his midnight haunts are known  His secret incantations and his spells  By which he does those feats that cheat our sight  Wilt to those guilty haunts conduct our guard  And render up his person to the law  Much praise and large reward shalt thou receive  If thou wilt notBut wherefore should I doubt  I would persuade not threaten Know withal  It is not thou 'tis justice gives the blow  The law will have its victim Thinkest thou  That we to whom the custody is given  Of God's prophetic oracles ordain'd  To guard his worship and expound his laws  Will let this innovating Teacher spurn  Our holy order mock our ancient rites  Prophane our Sabbaths and himself exalt  Coequal with Jehovah to confound  His unity and claim divided power  No let death arbitrate 'twixt him and us  If he be very CHRIST death shall not dare  To aim his dart at immortality  His incorruption shall defy the grave  If man blaspheming man he justly dies  Living or dying thus his fate dispells  All mystery truth starts of force to light  And God is glorified in either case  He ceas'd and on the Traitor fix'd a look  Which like the serpent's fascinating eye  Gaz'd motion's power away sullen he stood  As with a spell entranc'd the aweful sense  Of his great Master's virtue and the dread  Of an hereafter terrible to thought  No longer serv'd to hold the wizard fiend  And his fell arts at bay The word of truth  Sown on the surface of his stony heart  Had perish'd without root religion's lamp  Faint and more faint as MAMMON's crafty breath  Blew up the storm of passion now expir'd  In his benighted soul there rankling pride  Malicious envy avarice and revenge  Leagu'd with hell's minister and uncontroul'd  Their impious orgies held At length the wretch  To calm deliberate treachery resign'd  With all th' unrighteous Mammon in his heart  And vile prevarication on his lips  Thus with consent in dubious phrase implied  The grand seducer of mankind dismiss'd  Great is the peril of the attempt you urge  For great the power of him you would destroy  Therefore if I demand some pause for thought  Deem it not much Your offers shall be weigh'd  But now no more Occasions call me hence  This night the Master hath convok'd the Twelve  To keep the sacred feast ordain'd of God  With bread unleaven'd and the Paschal lamb  Thither tho' last and in his favor leaft  I go a cited guest There whilst I sit  Unnotic'd at his table's lowest foot  My meditations shall recall your words  And ponder them apart Say to your priests  Those conservators of our ancient law  This night they may expect my last resolve  And now behold the length'ning shadow marks  The ev'ning hour that warns me hence Farewell  This said their conf'rence ended they embrace  As friends who plight their faith Upon the touch  So quick th' infection ran so dire the blight  The pois'nous ferment on the instant reach'd  ISCARIOT'S tainted heart and now he burnt  With the fell lust of gold Joy seiz'd the Fiend  For well he knew how mortal to the soul  That deadly aconite the growth of hell  Oh wretch for ever lost for ever curst  Whom Mammon thus embraces Who shall wake  Thy conscience from its lethargy Who now  Shall stop the courses of that baneful drug  And stem the swift destruction 'Tis too late  Better for thee hadst thou ne'er seen the light  Or lost it ere this fatal hour had birth  Thy doom is seal'd hell hath its hour of joy  Thou traitor an eternity of woe  The meditation of thy heart shall hurl  Thee to perdition and thy Lord to death  Now JUDAS down the mountain turn'd his steps  Not so the Tempter he from the high rock  Exalted where he stood his impious eye  Glanc'd o'er the city' of God full in his view  From East to West in moony crescent stretch'd  Here yet JEHOVAH was ador'd here reign'd  All else to SATAN and his idol gods  Thro' earth's wide range belong'd to their dire names  Each temple echo'd every knee was bow'd  How oft ev'n here upon his holy hill  Did Judah's kings with their polluted groves  Affront God's house and pagan altars raise  To Chemos Milcom Ashtaroth and all  The host of heav'n within his sacred courts  Witness that impious king who pass'd his son  Through fire to Moloch homicidal God  Which rous'd th' Almighty's vengeance and entail'd  Mournful captivity on all his race  Hither as to the delug'd world of old  In promis'd time the dove of peace was sent  Upon this Ararat his sacred mount  He rested hence salvation dawn'd on man  Him to destroy the Tempter now aspir'd  Secure of his new convert firmly leagu'd  In his dire plot and to perdition seal'd  Nor rested on that mount the darkling Fiend  Nor further need had he of priestly garb  Than till he saw ISCARIOT join the train  Of CHRIST and his disciples then at once  To his own airy properties dissolv'd  A spi'rit invisible with eager speed  To hell's assembled chiefs he wing'd his flight  The sun had sunk beneath the Western hills  And now at ev'ning hour the Jews prepare  To celebrate their Passover ordain'd  T' eternize their deliv'rance when God's wrath  Smote ev'ry firstborn male in Mizraim's coast  Save where the blood of lamb piacular  Sprinkling the consecrated door was found  Of the destroying angel To this feast  Prelusive of his own pure sacrifice  And type of his bloodshedding JESUS came  The guests were present and the table spread  With loins begirt as men upon the march  And staff in hand they snatch a hasty meal  This done in pensive meditation rapt  The Savior conscious of impending death  Sate in the midst to his allpresent mind  The treason and the traitor stood confest  Low'ring abash'd and from the rest apart  ISCARIOT at the table's lowest foot  Took post where best he might escape that glance  From whose intelligence no heart could hide  Its guilty meditations All eyes else  Were center'd on the Savior's face divine  Which with the brightness of the Godhead mix'd  Traces of human sorrow and display'd  The workings of a mind where mercy seem'd  Struggling to reconcile some mortal wrong  To pardon and forbearance Such a look  Made silence sacred every tongue was mute  Ev'n PETER's zeal forbore the vent of words  Or spent itself in murmurs half supprest  At length the meek REDEEMER rais'd his eyes  Where gentle resignation tempering grief  Beam'd grace ineffable on all around  And with these words the awful silence broke  Muse not if I am sad nor stand aghast  As doubtful of my constancy these pangs  And more which I must suffer were foreseen  The hour now coming comes not by surprize  It is the consummation of my charge  And fills the measure of atonement up  Shall I then say Father avert this hour  And save me from these agonies Not so  With heart prepar'd to suffer and submit  I meet my doom forewarn'd Yet ere we part  Take this last office from your Master's hands  And when you see me stoop to wash your feet  As soon as you shall remember 'tis your Lord  Your dying Lord this legacy bequeaths  And edify by his humility  This said his seamless mantle he threw off  And girt his tunic close about his waist  And now with mute amazement they beheld  The Son of God in servantlike attire  Prepar'd to execute his menial task  All gaz'd all wonder'd but no voice oppos'd  None dar'd to pray forbearance of the deed  Till he whose heart was ever on his lips  PETER in warm expostulation cried  Lord dost thou wash my feet thy servant's feet  Mean as the dust he treads on Never Lord  Never shalt thou do that for one so vile  So allunworthy That be far from thee  Such homage ill beseemeth thee to pay  Me to receiveTo him the Lord replied  PETER as yet thou know'st not what I do  Hereafter thou shalt know therefore no more  Cease to oppose for if I wash thee not  With me thou hast no partStruck to the soul  With horror at the thought his eager words  Wing'd with the flame of rhapsody burst forth  Oh not my feet alone my hands my head  Wash me all o'er and sanctify each part  There needs not this the meek REDEEMER cried  Enough is done thus wash'd though but in part  Thou shalt be clean throughout Yet I'll not say  Ye are all clean Spite of the Shepherd's care  The taint hath touch'd his flock Alas for him  On whom the foul contamination lights  Woe to that wretch that ever he was born  And do ye need a comment to expound  This lesson of humility and lore  Ye call me Lord and Master well ye say  For such in truth I am if then your Lord  Be meek and lowly will not ye renounce  Pride and contention If the Master stoops  To wash his feet who serves shall ye do less  To these your equal brethren Learn of me  And each with other deal as I with you  Write on your hearts my words the time draws nigh  When I shall speak no more with you on earth  Ye have all heard how blest if ye obey  I speak not of you all Whilst here ye sit  In seeming fellowship around my board  Sharing this social meal my last on earth  Doubt not but I can search into your breasts  And see whose hearts are loyal whose is false  And mark me well I fall not by man's wiles  Not unpredicted is the trait'rous act  And well I know the wretch whose faithless hand  Dips with me in the dish shall soon be dy'd  With my devoted blood Betray'd I am  Deceiv'd I cannot beThis when they heard  Each with the other interchang'd a look  Of question and suspect speechless they star'd  Confounded and aghast As men drawn forth  For decimation tremble to unfold  The lot of life or death so these in doubt  On whom the word of prophecy might light  Curious yet fearful to enquire of CHRIST  Search'd their own hearts in silence All perceiv'd  Omniscience which to God alone belongs  Familiar with their thoughts and every soul  Save that dire wretch whom conscience inly smote  Trembled lest unpremeditated guilt  Might be denounc'd upon him or the sin  Of one man as of Korah move the Lord  With the whole congregation to be wroth  But PETER in whose everanxious mind  These terrors undispell'd long could not dwell  To the belov'd Disciple on the breast  Of CHRIST reclining now gave sign to ask  The fearful question in what traitor's heart  Plot so accurs'd could harbour Thus besought  Though much his humble nature fear'd offence  In accent soft with supplicating eye  Turn'd on the Master the meek suitor said  Lord shew thy true and faithful servants grace  And let us know the traitorHe it is  JESUS replied on whom I shall bestow  This sop when I have dipp'd it in my cup  He said and as he plung'd the morsel in  All eyes were fix'd upon the fatal work  Wond'ring on whom he would bestow the spell  And soon with silent horror they beheld  The saturated sop to JUDAS giv'n  Pledge of perdition he with greedy haste  Devour'd it by the fiend within him urg'd  For MAMMON to the dark divan had told  The joyful tidings and had posted back  Swift as the magic whirlwind conjur'd up  By all hell's wizard imps could drive him on  And now sate nestling in the traitor's heart  Brooding his filthy spawn Great was the joy  Of the infernal tempter thus to find  That guardian Pow'r whose providence he fear'd  By these symbolic elements withdrawn  And his apostate victim now cast out  From the Lord's Supper alien from God's grace  And soulsurrender'd to hell's gloomy realm  Now as the spell within him 'gan to work  The traitor's visage like the troubled sea  Uptorn and furrow'd with tempestuous winds  Shifted it's hues now deadly pale aghast  And horrorstruck now fiery red deform'd  With hellish rage and from man's semblance chang'd  To very daemon terrible to sight  Oh what a fall from heav'n to deeper hell  Than thought can fathom horrors worse than heart  Of man unless abandon'd of his God  Can suffer or conceive Words do but fail  To paint that unreveal'd abyss those depths  Of the immeasu'rable profound where groans  Wailings and woes and tossings amidst fires  Unquenchable await the wretch condemn'd  Meanwhile in cloudless majesty and mild  The Savior's face divine on all around  Effulgent beam'd about his temples shone  A radiant glory This when JUDAS saw  Whom now the spi'rit of darkness had possess'd  And none such in the sphere of that pure light  Long could abide he started from his couch  Prepar'd for flight when thus in few the Lord  Go then and what thou hast in hand to do  Do quickly so departThe word of power  Though gentle yet commanding JUDAS heard  And instantly the spirit took him thence  Nor could he not obey for so rebuk'd  The prince of hell SATAN himself had fled  The faithful remnant sate in mute suspense  Pondering what this dismission might import  The Master with a glance discern'd their thoughts  He saw them in profound conjecture lost  Humbled in heart and sad their honor stain'd  By base defection and their faith convuls'd  When thus at once to strengthen and console  Their wav'ring minds these healing words he spake  Let not your heart be troubled Ye believe  In God believe also in me his Son  Doubt not but in the compass of the heav'ns  My Father will provide for all his Saints  Mansions of peace seats of eternal bliss  Where spi'rits made perfect after death shall dwell  And rest from earthly toils Thither I go  To seal your sure election and prepare  For you my faithful servants an abode  That as in sorrow here so there in bliss  With me your Lord now dying for your sakes  Ye may surmount the grave and ever live  In heavenly communion undisturb'd  Lament not therefore if I now depart  Your provident precursor for ye know  Whither I go and also know the way  Lord we are ignorant and dimsighted men  THOMAS replied we see not what thou see'st  And as it stands not in our reach to guess  Whither thou go'st how should we know the way  I am the way th' inspired Teacher cried  I am the Truth the Life None can approach  The Father but by me me had ye known  This blindness had been done away and now  Behold Him presentWhere still doubting cried  One of th' astonish'd number Oh impart  That intellectual vision to discern  And see the Father set Him in our view  In form demonstrative we ask no more  Say'st thou resum'd the Lord and have I been  So long familiar yet so little known  Will not the works O PHILIP I have done  Done in thy sight instruct thee whence I am  And what my power Doth there need light for this  'Midst the broad blaze of proofs that shines about thee  Can'st thou not see God's presence in his power  Of this mortality which ye behold  This fleshly self I speak not 'tis the Spirit  The virtue of my Father which is in me  In act how visible in voice how strong  Clear and express And can you see and hear  And yet withhold belief Oh slow of faith  If words cannot persuade let works convince  If miracles which only God can do  Are done before your eyes how say you then  Shew us the Father Sanctify your hearts  From fear and terror though the hour comes on  When to the silent mansions of the dead  From this impeni'tent world I must withdraw  Mourn not but let your grief be turn'd to joy  For as in me the Father so in Him  I live and move my Spirit though unseen  Still present shall protect and hover o'er you  I will not leave you comfortless my name  Shall be your tower of refuge with my peace  Now dying I endow you of that peace  The powers of this world never shall despoil you  And in my Name whatever ye shall ask  Believing ye shall have By faith in me  Ye shall command the elements uplift  The everlasting mountains by their roots  And whelm them in the centre of the sea  This in my Name potential ye shall do  And greater works than this By faith in me▪  Ye shall confront th' oppressor 'midst the shock  Of tribulations and the angry scorn  Of a malignant world abhorr'd despis'd  Thrust from their synagogues ye shall possess  Your souls in patience glorying to endure  Like tribulation with your martyr'd Lord  Despair nor therefore for before that day  A Comforter shall come whom I will send  And he shall teach you all things When ye stand  Before the judgment seat of impious men  Friendless accus'd environ'd with a throng  Of perjur'd witnesses athirst for blood  Your Guardian Spirit shall provide a voice  Action and eloquence and prompt your lips  With untaught languages to sound my Name  With tongue miraculous through all the world  Wars then and rumors and portentous signs  Famine and earthquakes and disastrous plagues  Shall vex the nations prophets shall arise  With lying divinations to confound  The weak pervert the wavering and perplex  The very Saints themselves Await the time  These are but harbingers of mightier woes  The day of terror is but in it's dawn  The powers of earth and heav'n must undergo  Direful convulsion this majestic pile  This temple shall become so mere a wreck  That not one stone shall rest upon another  Then shall your hour of tribulation come  Then to confess my Name shall be your crime  By torture and by death to be aton'd  The tyrants of the world shall then let loose  Their persecuting rage and great shall be  The fallingoff of many rocks and caves  Shall be your hidingplaces yet from thence  Your sound shall echo to the farthest ends  Of the redeemed earth from those dark cells  The beams of revelation shall break forth  Maugre the pow'rs of hell and blest is he  Whose faith unshaken shall abide the time  Till the great end and consummation comes  My peace and my salvation to ensure  Few are the moments now and passing swift  Which thus conversing we have yet in hand  Servants no more henceforth I call you friends  Therefore as friends and children let your love  Each to the other knit your hearts together  In brotherly communion this command  New to the world I give you Let good will  And peace and concord harmonize your souls  And mark you as the followers of him  Whose every act was charity whose life  Was spent and clos'd expiring for your sakes  And stronger proof of love what man can give  Than to yield up his body to the grave  And die as shortly I shall for his friends  Time was that I have shadow'd out my speech  In proverbs and allusions time now is  To cast obscurity aside and shew  Th' unveiled glories of the Father to you  Henceforward ye shall ask of Him and have  My Name for your petitions shall suffice  My prayers ye need not for the Father's love  Without an intercessor shall protect  Mine as you love me and prevent your wants  From Him I came into this world to Him  This world now leaving I again return  This said conviction smote their glowing hearts  With faith and hope's bright image new inspir'd  And scenes of future glory beaming on them  When thus with voices join'd in loud acclaim  CHRIST in the Godhead manifest they hail'd  Now Lord we hear and understand thy words  Plain words and not in parables involv'd  Now are we sure all knowledge is reveal'd  All pow'r committed to thee from above  And without further question we believe  And henceforth know thou camest forth from God  Do ye at length believe the Master cried  Behold the hour comes on yea now is come  When your strong faith shall stagger at the scene  Of these impending horrors and shrink back  Confounded and appall'd to the four winds  Wide as your fears can spread you all shall fly  And leave me struggling with a storm of woes  Unfriended and alone what did I say  Alone I cannot be for in me dwells  The Father ever present Let this thought  Arm you with constancy to meet the shock  Of tribulation and withstand the powers  Of this brief world for to your comfort know  I have o'ercome the world This said he paus'd  And sate whilst all were hush'd as one entranc'd  So fast the heav'nly vision pour'd upon him  Then with uplifted eyes and heaving breast  Full of his God this solemn pray'r breath'd forth  O Father give thy glory to the Son  As he hath glorified thy Name on earth  And these whom thou hast giv'n him taught to know  Thee the true God alone and JESUS CHRIST  Thy messenger and advocate with thee  For lost mankind Father To me restore  That glory which was mine before all time  Or e'er the world was made and man fell off  From his obedience now at length redeem'd  From sin by my atonement and made heir  Of life eternal purchas'd with my blood  The act of mediation is complete  Thy work is finish'd and thy Name gone forth  To these of thine election Thine they were  To me thou gav'st them and they have receiv'd  And kept as faithful witnesses thy Word  For them I pray The world which now I leave  Hath no more part in me for them alone  Not for the world I pray they must abide  I shall depart and be at peace with Thee  O holy Father keep them in thy Name  Whole and entire link'd in the bond of faith  Firm as I hold them One alone is lost  Son of perdition him the prophets saw  In their prospective visions and foretold  That so thy Son should suffer but for these  They are unstain'd they stand not in the guilt  And condemnation of that wretch accurst  I pray thee not to take them from the world  Through which I send them forth as shining lights  To draw men's eyes and hearts and guide their search  To the bright source whence thy salvation beams  These are my ministers as I am thine  Oh sanctify them through thy truth For them  And all through them converted to thy word  Father I pray Translate them in thy time  From this unquiet world to that high state  Of heav'nly bliss where they may dwell with me  And see my glory So shall they receive  Thy love through me transfus'd into their hearts  And rest from all their sorrows in thy peace  So spake the Lord and with these gracious words  His faithful remnant cheer'd for soft they fell  As heav'n's blest dew upon the thirsty hills  And sweet the healing balm which they distill'd  On sorrowwounded soulsNow treach'rous eve  Crept silent on and threw her dusky veil  O'er Nature's face masking the deeds of men  The Savior rose for in his conscious breast  A warning voice had whisper'd Up arise  Go forth to death One solemn act remains  One sacrifice 'tis now God's wrath demands  Atonement a whole world's redemption now  Hangs on the minute's point Behold him then  A voluntary victim leading forth  His sad disciples to the fatal spot  Where treason lurk'd in ambush for his life  Where stood the prince of darkness and his pow'rs  Arm'd with commission'd terrors to assail  Him single him forsaken him oppos'd  To myriads whilst Heav'n's angels soar'd aloof  Trembling spectators of th' unequal strife  Who now so comfortless as God's own Son  His soul in woes unutterable whelm'd  All commerce with its native heav'n denied  Press'd down to earth nor other strength had he  Than in his human nature might be found  To combat more than human agonies  Accumulated pangs which all the sins  Of all the world from loss of Paradise  By man's first fall to the last damning page  Of heav'n's black register had pil'd upon him  The mass of ages Oh what tongue can speak  The love of our REDEEMER And yet man  Ingrateful impious man hourly reviles  His Benefactor's name affects the style  Of sophistry and metaphysic pride  To quibble with salvation and renounce  Those guides that lead us by the hand to heav'n  This they call reason this man's natural right  To question his Creator and in pride  Of independant dignity reject  Salvation rather than consent to own  God's privilege to save him by such means  As to God's wisdom best and meetest seem'd  Such monsters doth this teeming earth produce  Impious audacity which dares to say  I need no Mediator I disclaim  CHRIST and his offer'd peace 'twixt God and me  I want no advocate to plead my cause  By my own rectitude I stand or fall  The Evangelic Volumes I regard  As fabricated tales of juggling tricks  Witness'd by none but partners in the craft  Deep read in pagan story I confront  The sacred records with the silent page  Of those who register no strange eclipse  No noonday darkness not one friendly groan  Of sympathising Nature to attest  CHRIST's dying hourShut shut the Book of Life  Go to the Jews the Pagans for thy creed  Go to the dust blasphemer In the ear  Of Death whisper thy doubts and learn of him  Thy folly's confutation and thy doom  In those sad realms to which he shall conduct  Thy trembling soul when the Archangel's trump  Hath summon'd thee to judgment and set ope  The grave thy rashness deem'd for ever clos'd  END OF THE SECOND BOOK  CALVARY OR  THE DEATH OF CHRIST  BOOK III  THE ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK  Iscariot having separated himself from Christ wanders through the streets of the city in a disconsolate manner and at length arrives at the brook Cedron without the gates Here he breaks forth into soliloquy in which after reviewing his past situation he affects to justify his present motives for betraying his Master to the priests Christ and his disciples proceeding to the Mount of Olives are discovered by him as they are passing the brook in their way thither and Judas resolves upon availing himself of the opportunity for delivering Christ into the hands of his enemies In the mean time the priests and elders assemble in the palace of Caiaphas and there hold a council upon the measures to be pursued for the apprehension of Christ The high priest harangues the assembly to this immediate purport In the interim Judas is announced and being admitted makes his proposal to the council this produces some observations on the part of Caiaphas and is objected to by Nicodemus who after delivering his opinion quits the assembly Caiaphas then takes up the matter afresh controverts the sentiments of Nicodemus and with the approbation of all present closes with the proposals of Judas and sends out a company with that traiterous disciple to the Mount of Olives there to apprehend the person of Christ The assembly breaks up and the hall is no sooner evacuated by the priests and elders than their seats are filled by Satan and his infernal spirits Satan addresses to them a congratulatory speech on the success of Mammon's temptation on whom he bestows many high encomiums an ovation takes place in honor of that daemon when Chemos appears wounded by the spear of Gabriel whom he had encountered on the Mount of Olives where he had been posted as a spy upon the motions of Christ and his disciples Satan enraged at the account sallies forth with a resolution to revenge the attack by punishing the temerity of Gabriel arms himself for the occasion and after much proud vaunting of his superior prowess disappears and the infernal spirits disperse  CALVARY  BOOK III THE TREASON OF JUDAS  DARK came the ev'ning on and the pale moon  Now faintly glimm'ring through a wint'ry cloud  Shed her dim horrors o'er the shadowy earth  Whilst through the silent streets with step disturb'd  And heart by hellish meditations rent  The Outcast of the Lord pursued his way  ISCARIOT name for evermore accurst  Onward he went unquestion'd unobserv'd  For all upon this solemn night kept house  Nor stopp'd till forth the city gates he came  To Cedron's brook whose bubbling current laves  The olivecrowned Mount favor'd of CHRIST  For its umbrageous groves and silent haunts  For pray'r and contemplation fit retreat  Here first as one awaken'd to new thoughts  Starting he check'd his step and with a groan  That rent his lab'ring bosom thus broke forth  Oh my torn heart Oh soultormenting scenes  Can I forget the blissful hours I've pass'd  Beneath your shades lift'ning the Master's words  When as he spake of heav'n and heav'nly joys  Of righteousness and the blest Spi'rits with God  Such life in his description glow'd methought  All Paradise was present to my view  And courted me to enter Heav'n and earth  Must I remember Never man like him  Could with such magic eloquence entrance  The senses of his hearers lift the soul  To heav'nly contemplations and transport  To thoughts beyond itself thence to look down  Upon this lower world and all it's cares  It's pains it's persecutions with contempt  Sometimes envelop'd in mysterious schemes  And parables he couch'd the moral truth  Which painted on the memory left it's tints  Indelible But when with tongue inspir'd  The fall of nations he foretold and drew  The curtain of futurity aside  When in the pomp of numbers he describ'd  Jerusalem beleaguer'd with a host  Of Gentile foes and trodden down to dust  Her matrons and her virgins whelm'd in blood  Or dragg'd to violation shame and bondage  By ruffian spoilers when his soaring flight  Spurning the world's wide compass scal'd the skies  And there amidst the empyrean fields  As in his proper region shook the spheres  Of sun moon stars as with a master's hand  And shew'd them falling in prophetic awe  Of his own glorious coming in a cloud  With pow'r and state supernal then our hearts  With sympathetic raptures burnt within us  And we vain mortals saw or thought we saw  Our own vile bodies glorified to share  In his triumphant entry and ourselves  To dignities and thrones and starry spheres  Exalted loftiest in the realms of light  But now these bright illusions are no more  Vanish'd these glitt'ring scenes my claims on heav'n  All cancell'd and my hopes a bankrupt's dream  Mocking the haunted fancy with a pile  Of visionary wealth Behold me sham'd  Banish'd his board detected and my thoughts  Turn'd outward to provoke my brethren's scorn  And blazon forth his prescience Let that pass  Traitor pronounc'd a traitor I will be  That prophecy at least shall be fulfill'd  Though master of my will I could refute  And dash his bold prediction yet my heart  Ponders revenge more suited to it's wrongs  Greater than such slight triumph can bestow  And not less terrible than death itself  This night the last that he shall walk at large  This night shall be his triumph or his fall  If these grave elders who conspire his death  These reverend priests revolt not from the deed  That casts on them their function and their tribe  The peril of his blood why should my heart  Shrink from it's purpose What have I to fear  In act subordinate in cause supreme  Traitor prejudg'd of uncommitted crimes  Arraign'd and thrown upon the world condemn'd  More he had said but like a serpent coil'd  With sudden start he shrunk into himself  And list'ning held his breath to catch the sound  Of steps that echoing o'er the flinty soil  Bespoke a company in near approach  With these the Master's wellknown voice he heard  Whereat like murd'rous Cain when call'd of God  The cow'ring conscious outcast slunk aside  And wrapp'd his russet cloak about his head  Then darkling stood the holy troop meanwhile  Forded the shallow brook and held their way  Strait to the Olive Mount their wonted haunt  Forth sprung the lurking caitiff from his watch  The greedy Mammon rush'd upon his heart  Glorying that now he held them in his net  Darkness conspiring with occasions apt  Of hour and place to make his vengeance sure  Remorse was dead within him every sense  Of virtue lost yet in his coward breast  Such languor dread and cold repugnance dwelt  Scarce could the breath of hell's worst fiend suffice  To blow it into flame Now sudden rage  Impell'd him onward now with palsied fear  Struck back he reel'd and shook in ev'ry joint  This SATAN saw and evermore at hand  To drive the wav'ring sinner to his doom  Breath'd all his spi'rit upon him direr blast  Cocytus never vented the full tide  Of aconite engender'd with his blood  His brain set ev'ry fev'rish nerve in play  And screw'd his heated fancy to the pitch  Of daring and defiance yet the wretch  Not less a traitor to himself than CHRIST  Or e'er the acting of the dreadful deed  Thus strove by sophistry to gloss it o'er  Why do I doubt What horrors shake my mind  Why should not my affronted honor stir  Me to betray as their insulted law  Provokes our elders to destroy their foe  For Moses they I for myself oppose  And where's the wrong if he who knows my heart  And all it's meditations will not deign  To turn it from it's purpose and divert  The danger he foreknows nay rather helps  To lure the embryo treason into birth  Either his own free will makes death it's choice  And so becomes accomplice in the deed  Or else foredoom'd to die he knows his hour  And thus not acting of ourselves but rul'd  By strong necessity we stand absolv'd  Mere guiltless tools and instruments of fate  What then Why let the Scriptures be fulfill'd  Let prophecies which are the voice of God  Sound out his knell we fight not against Heav'n  Let CHRIST if glory waits him in the grave  Descend into the dust and seek it there  If his soul covets to make league with death  And dwell in consort with corruption's worm  What time more apt for death than this dark hour  Image of death itself And who so fit  As God's highpriest the temple's minister  To put life's intervening veil aside  And usher him to glory I meanwhile  His humble harbinger will go before  T' announce his coming and make clear the road  That leads to death the goal of his ambition  Yet how if all this tame indifference  Be but a feint to draw the world about him  And then amaze them with some grand display  Of wonderworking power And who can tell  How far his hand miraculous may stretch  Who from the tomb pluck'd forth the fest'ring corpse  Of shrowded Lazarus three days in earth  And bade him live again Stupendous act  This we beheld and hail'd him Lord of Life  But still the unconverted Jews stood off  And deem'd us witnesses of slight account  Weak cred'lous men first dup'd and thence become  Associates in imposture What remains  But instantly to put my thoughts in act  And yield him up to those who in th' attempt  Succeeding vindicate their disbelief  Failing abide the shame of their defeat  In this or that opinion there must be  A dangerous error to persist were fatal  This night dispells all doubt If he be CHRIST  He lives confest and triumphs over death  If man he falls unpitied and abjur'd  Thus for foul deeds pretending fair excuse  The caitiff wretch on trait'rous errand bent  Back through the city gates pursu'd his way  And to his nightly assignation hied  Perch'd on the summit of the sacred Mount  Should'ring God's temple a proud palace stood  There dwelt the sovereign pontiff and this night  Held solemn convocation and consult  Not for God's glory other cares had they  Cares nearer to their selfish hearts concerns  Heav'n had no part in impious dire cabals  How to prevent the dayspring from on high  Now by CHRIST's revelation and his acts  Miraculous just dawning on the world  Aforetime wrapt in darkness black as death  Best veil for their hypocrisy and craft  In their great hall of council there in ranks  Precedencies and dignities dispos'd  Doctors and longrob'd pharisees and scribes  And bearded elders met senate to whom  For machinations plots and secret wiles  Rome's purple conclave stoops High over all  On throne pontifical in robes of state  With sacred ephod girt of various hues  And breastplate glitt'ring bright with mystic gems  Mitrecrown'd CAIAPHAS the temple's chief  Exalted sate The sanhedrim was full  All came whom lust of power or bigot zeal  Or enmity to CHRIST rous'd to the call  Mouthworshippers of God agents of hell  In heart and hypocrites abhorr'd of CHRIST  To public scorn held up and pictur'd out  As rebel husbandmen who basely slew  Their Lord's commission'd Son Scarce was there one  Whose galled conscience had not felt the sting  Of some keen truth extorted from the lips  Of the elsehumble JESUS meek to all  But the proud Pharisee or cavi'lling Scribe  To knaves who thought by cunning to outwit  Wisdom itself and snare him in his talk  To hypocrites who fasted oft with sad  And woeworn faces to be seen of men  Or such as made long pray'rs for a display  Of righteousness and vaunted their good deeds  Mocking their conscience and insulting Heav'n  To these in all the majesty of truth  Frowning he spake nor spar'd he for rebuke  Severe indignant many a time and oft  To their whole sect he had denounced woe  Woe trebled on their heads What wonder then  If thus combin'd by interest to oppose  His spreading glories their envenom'd hearts  Rankled with envy hatred and revenge  Nor were there wanting to their great divan  Those who can work unseen within the heart  Dark ministers who know to touch the springs  And cords whose movements can convulse the soul  With furious passions bursting from their mine  Like sulph'rous fires that tear the quaking earth  SATAN himself was there for at this hour  He and his host had furlough upon earth  Daemons of blood ambition envy strife  Rang'd the vex'd world at large Loud were their tongues  And fiery hot their zeal against the Lord  Whose miracles resounding through the land  Rung in their ears the downfall of their pow'r  Illomen'd knellBrethren 'tis time to rouse  Cried CAIAPHAS and started from his throne  Furious as Korah when at his tent door  With his rebellious company he stood  And waving high his censer call'd aloud  To mutiny 'gainst Moses So now call'd  With voice as loud and deeper plung'd in crime  Than these who sunk outright this second priest  This worse revolter against God himself  In his own Son reflected from his state  High o'er their heads exalted he look'd down  On all beneath then with uplifted eyes  And hands extended as in act to rend  His robes pontificalYes sacred seers  Again he cried yes venerable priests  Elders and reverend sages of our law  'Tis more than time to call your vengeance up  Awake ye sleep too long For me your slave  Servant of servants me by how much more  In place exalted so much more in heart  Abas'd as meritless of such high state  I were content to cast these robes aside  Pluck off this beard and on this mitred head  Unworthy of such honors scatter dust  And ashes might such penitence avert  The shame that for my sins is falling on you  And quell the mad'ning faction now afloat  Since this bold Bethlemite hath started up  To mock the church of God Shall it be said  That for my punishment these evils light  On you the righteous that in my day rose  This innovator to conspire your fall  To broach new doctrines and unhinge the faith  Of the still wavering multitude If I  If I am in the crime if in your thoughts  My negligence hath foster'd this revolt  Make me your sacrifice thrust me from hence  For this high place unfit set up your cross  And there exalt me But if I am clear  And this your looks encourage me to hope  If CHRIST not CAIAPHAS deserves the death  Why do ye pause What terror holds you back  Timehonor'd rabbi elders sages guides  And masters of our Israel ye by whom  Our synagogues are taught of God's own law  Interpreters ordain'd which of your grave  And reverend council will at once unfold  To my yet faithless ears the mighty spell  By which this JESUS works Who will expound  This prodigy that sets the crowd agape  This more than man of whom the people bruit  These more than human doings You are dumb  None offers a reply for none will say  This wisdom and these mighty works accord  With one so mean of birth with Joseph's son  A base mechanic Fitter task for him  To use his father craft and humbly ply  The workman's tools than in the temple sit  Disputing with our doctors or withdrawn  As late the Baptist to some desart mount  There sit in sullen dignity enthron'd  And from his rocky theatre declaim  To list'ning thousands Here be some have heard  His doctrines many have endur'd his taunts  And though in wise and wellpois'd minds like your's  Such meteors breed no terror yet they draw  The gazing vulgar and so rank a taint  Runs through th' infected fold that much I doubt  If half the flock of Israel be not touch'd  So diligent is he to spread the plague  So careless we to stem it If his word  Be suffer'd thus to overturn our law  The monument of ages then alas  We've seen the last of these solemnities  Before this night returns there'll not be found  Or lamb to sacrifice or priest to slay  Or temple to receive our Paschal rites  Rome whose ambition grasps the conquer'd world  Shall plant her eagles on our holy mount  And Jupiter usurp JEHOVAH's shrine  He paus'd yet stood as one in act to speak  Struggling for words which furious passion choak'd  And stifled on his tongue a stormy cloud  Hung on his brow his visage ghastly pale  Mad'ning with rage he stampt and shook his robe  As when the Delphic prophetess convuls'd  And foaming on her tripod sets aghast  The scar"d enthusiasts who believe her fill'd  And fighting with the God oracular  So through the hall of council silence reign'd  Whilst expectation turn'd all eyes and ears  On their rapt prophet till the word being giv'n  That one of CHRIST's disciples stood without  And instant audience crav'd that awful name  Their spellbound faculties at once set free  Instant loud murmurs fill'd the vaulted roof  Like the deep roar of subterranean tides  Whose eddies undermine the cavern'd shores  Of seagirt Mona or Bermuda's isle  This past the senate's chief resum'd his throne  Whence from his state inclining he gave sign  For silence and commanded to admit  Their unexpected suitor at the word  Wide flew the doors apart and there behold  With cloak to' the knee tuck'd up and staff in hand  ISCARIOT caitiff viler than the worst  That e'er wore pilgrim's sanctimonious garb  In aftertimes when fierce crusading zeal  Sent forth it's wand'ring eremites to put  The murd'rous sword in meek Religion's hand  The cross on which our patient Lord expir'd  Their badge of victory and signal made  For their destroying armies lur'd to war  With pardons earnt in fields of carnage fought  For God's pretended glory' as if dire hope  Rivers of blood could waft their souls to heav'n  Founder of these and prototype of all  Who dy'd the cross with blood ISCARIOT stood  Full of the fiend and cast around on all  His haggard eyes that augur'd vengeful ire  And fraud deep brooding in his treach'rous heart  When after pause now summon'd to expound  His purpose whether by his Master sent  Or selfimpell'd thus MAMMON's convert spake  Fathers of Israel patrons of our law  And chiefly thou great priest vicar of God  And faithful shepherd of the remnant sav'd  From Abraham's scatter'd flock I muse not lords  That you are cast in wonder to behold  Me standing in this place me to your cause  Unfriendly deem'd and which to all is known  Nor on my part denied one of the Twelve  And follower of JESUS But grave sirs  I do adjure you by your love to truth  No longer wear this jealous eye upon me  Than to your patient ears I shall unfold  Why hither I am come not as a thief  To steal into your councils spy them out  And after blazon them but in fair faith  And plain sincerity with no double heart  To make confession sure and give my life  A pledge into your hands Stand not amaz'd  As if it were a thing impossible  That CHRIST's disciple should not be his friend  Mine hath been toilsome husbandry my lords  And none but bitter fruits have I reap'd from it  Fruits of repentance Weary days and nights  I've minister'd to him without reward  And weary miles full many travel'd o'er  Fainting and pinch'd with hunger then at night  When the wild creatures of the earth find rest  And covert in their holes houseless have watch'd  Amidst the shock of elements and brav'd  Storms which the mail'd rhinoceros did not dare  Unshelter'd to abide Sometimes on sea  Lash'd by the surging waves I've toil'd for life  Whilst he sate sleeping reckless of the gale  Rescu'd from these for I of force confess  His pow'r is absolute and safe on shore  My labors ceas'd not with the scene new toils  New tasks succeeded Now to rocks and caves  To sandy wilds or wheresoever else  The Spirit led and desolation reign'd  His wand'ring steps I follow'd yes his steps  But at what distance from his heart he held me  Bear witness mem'ry Others had his heart  Peter and James and John to them he breath'd  The secrets of his soul on them he shower'd  His promises of these he made no thrift  These he abounded in to me he gave  What he had least in store a barren purse  And bade me bear it no hard task I own  For it was light as beggary could make it  But office most ignoble Here perchance  Your wisdom would demand of me a cause  Why I endur'd these slights year after year  And still toil'd on in such a thankless service  What fascination and what spell you'll ask  Doth this man work with so to charm the mind  And lure it on through mortifying toils  Sorrows and pains and worse than these contempts  Yet hold it still enchain'd slave to his will  Most equal judges I must here submit  My weakness to your censure and refer  My cause to mercy or in selfdefence  Conjure you for a moment to descend  From your high state and to my humble place  And peasant thoughts accord your own great minds  My lords I neither mean to varnish o'er  My own too feeble nature nor to smooth  The rough sincerity of truth through fear  Or flattery of those 'fore whom I speak  If JESUS works by spells I know them not  Pray'rs but not incantations I have heard  If these be charms they are no charms for devils  Yet such he's charg'd withal Neither by league  With Beelzebub as some have gravely urg'd  Nor art Samaritan nor else by imp  Or genius as the heathen loudly vouch  Of their fam'd Socrates do I believe  His miracles are wrought Alas alas  Which of hell's ministers will be suborn'd  To work his own confusion No they shriek  They tremble at his bidding they come forth  From men possest they vanish to the winds  They sink into the pit from whence they sprung  I am a man my lords not overprone  To rash credulity nor apt to veer  With ev'ry breath of doctrine and I've heard  A voice that sways the elements commands  The springs of health making maim'd nature whole  Nay life itself return into the trunk  Which it had left and give a second pulse  To the cold heart of death This to have seen  And not to stand in reverence of the pow'r  That wrought these miracles were a degree  Of apathy above my nature's reach  No more cried CAIAPHAS no more of this  You much abuse our patience with this talk  Here is no place to sound CHRIST's praises forth  We are not met to recognize his pow'r  And back his daring claims but to chastise  Imposture to assert our sacred law  And vindicate the majesty of Heav'n  You tell us you are wearied with the tasks  Of a hard Master quit him then and earn  A better service earn a rich reward  By yielding him to justice You well know  His haunts his privacies his darkling hours  When without hazard of a public brawl  We may make lawful seizure for the state  Of his attainted person On this point  So you will order your discourse aright  You may speak freely of his praise no more  To him th' Apostate If from my forc'd lips  Unwilling witnesses although they be  Truth wrings this praise the last which they will utter  Suffer thus far in candor and let pass  These words in justice to a Master's fame  Whom I renounce and with an oath devote  To wrath to punishment to death itself  If death you doom But oh most reverend lords  It is not as a false and juggling cheat  A dealer with familiars I present him  To your just judgment Wretches vile as these  Would but disgrace your wrath and my revenge  But take him as a victim from my hands  Richer than hecatombs of vulgar blood  A sacrifice for God's high priest to make  Whilst all earth's scepter'd monarchs stood around  To gaze upon the work Be not deceiv'd  I know the jeopardy in which I stand  Yet I will on in me is no delay  This night this hour this instant I am your's  To trace him to his haunts to be your guide  And marshal you to vengeance But beware  Let them be chosen men you send approv'd  And constant though the heav'ns shall rain down fire  And the earth rock beneath them He who call'd  The dead anatomy to life can well  Make corpses of the livingHere the voice  Of one who nearest to the throne had place  Cut short the traitor's speech Of high renown  Was he now rising NICODEMUS known  To afterages as the nightly guest  Of JESUS and his converse with our Lord  In holy writ recorded Grave he was  A Pharisee and ruler of the Jews  Yet not of soul vindictive like the rest  Nor aspect arrogant when thus he spake  I call the time mispent that is bestow'd  On loudtongu'd orators whose art it is  To launch their hearers upon passion's tide  And drive them on by gusts of windy words  A giddy desperate course to rocks and shoals  Which steer'd by sage experience they had shunn'd  Such shipwreck of our wisdom we might make  Should we our better senses now permit  To take improv'ident counsel of our ears  By this highton'd declaimer thus assail'd  I pray you therefore carry back your thoughts  To times foregone when prophets have arose  And boasted mighty works which being done  Of man's device and cunning came to nought  So will it be with JESUS if his spirit  Be not of God time will o'ertake deceit  If time be let to run but cut it short  By death's rash stroke you cover him with glory  And from his ashes raise a mightier name  Than living he had reach'd with all the aids  Of artifice to back him Give me Heav'n  That tolerating policy which shews  No bitterness in speculative points  Disdaining from my heart what this man says  A traitor says who comes to sell his Master  My sentence never shall affect the life  Of this or any other man accus'd  On vague presumptions nor will I say Die  Till I have that in proof which merits death  For if this JESUS vaunts himself to be  What he is not God will confute his pride  But if with pow'r divine he acts and speaks  Commission'd to some awful unseen end  Shall man contend with God Vain strife shall we  Fall off from our great origin the faith  Of our blest father Abraham Shall we  Sore smitten for our trespasses cut short  And wasted to a remnant we on whom  The guiltless blood of all the prophets rests  Send this man up to heav'n to cry against us  And to a burthen heavier than enough  Add more and weightier guilt than all the rest  Heav'n's grace forefend You have my conscience lords  I leave it to your thoughts I stand absolv'd  He said and conscious that his words were lost  Upon obdurate hearts departed thence  So warn'd of God and from the gulph escap'd  Of that night's dire perdition wherein all  Save him alone were lost So in the wreck  Of some great admiral full fraught for war  When his tall vessel splits and the bold crew  Plunge quick into th' abyss Heav'n sometimes deigns  By wond'rous providence to snatch one life  From the devouring waves and waft him home  A solitary relick there to tell  God's mercies and his sad companions' fate  Him thus departing the proud pontiff ey'd  With look malign and to these taunts gave vent  Weak is that cause whose advocate flies from it  I pause to see if any here will follow  None moves none speaks none seconds his appeal  'Tis well One only convert to our foe  One patron of his cause this senate held  And holds no longer Vanish'd flown escap'd  One heart one mind one voice now rules the whole  For me I nor opinion shift nor place  Faithful I shrink from neither You have heard  What this wise elder counsels he hath left  His conscience as a legacy behind him  Let him who loves the giver take the gift  I for such part as to my share may fall  Scorn to engraft that scyon on my heart  Which if admitted might impart the seeds  Of treason and apostacy like his  Till cold and hot agree till selfish fear  And temporising maxims coalesce  With patriot zeal for Israel and firm faith  In God's reveal'd decrees his thoughts and mine  Will never mix and the attempt to join  Their jarring elements could only serve  To make this breast a field of mental war  Mark brethren mark how this man contravenes  Your antient just retaliating law  Moses saidEye for eye and tooth for tooth  So is revenge a virtue By this rule  JESUS must die for who puts out the law  Puts out the light of Israel stabs the life  And life for life is justice upon record  This ordinance our absent elder spurns  He holds at nought our antient equity  And sets new doctrines forth tells us forsooth  That we must wait the time wait till the light  Of Israel be extinct and leave redress  For those who without eyes can spy it out  Such councils would make cowards of us all  Rebels to God deserters from the faith  Traitors to Israel Can I wear these robes  And wear a heart within so vile so base  Tear them away uncover me to shame  Make me the scorn of men if thus array'd  And trickt in outside honors I am found  False to that King whose standard I support  No venerable sages if your rule  Were short to teach us what our duty is  The very heathen would inform us of it  The Roman soldier who deserts his post  Or sleeping suffers a surprize shall die  But we with God's own armies in our charge  We whose commander is the Lord of Hosts  Should we be found thus criminal what death  What doom more terrible than death itself  Can recompense such treason Forth then lords  Draw out an armed band and send them forth  Behold a ready leader Time yet serves  This night no stir no stragglers in our streets  To shake the city's peace JESUS secur'd  And hither brought a largess I decree  To all concern'd to JUDAS a reward  Befitting us to give him to receive  No more loud acclamations shook the hall  Th' assembly rose the traitor bow'd assent  A band of ruffians arm'd with swords and staves  Forth issued with ISCARIOT at their head  And to the Olive Mountain bent their course  Oh hour accurst Oh all ye stars of heav'n  And thou pale waining moon etherial lights  Firstborn of Nature look not ye chaste fires  Upon this monsterbreeding earth but quench  Your conscious lamps and whelm this murd'rous crew  In darkness black as their own damning plot  And thou conductor of this Stygian band  Vile hypocrite what fiend inspir'd the thought  To hail thy Master with the kiss of peace  And so betray him Wretch the time will come  When rack'd with horror and to all hope lost  Thine agonizing soul shall rue this deed  Curse its birthhour and whilst thy Master soars  To heav'n triumphant over death and sin  Thou shalt sink howling to the depths of hell  Now break your synod up ye envious priests  Elders and scribes prepare your harden'd hearts  To judge the Lord of Life convene your spies  To forge false witness and make smooth the way  To man's redemption by the blood of CHRIST  The very Paschal Lamb whom by the type  Of this night's sacrifice ye shadow'd forth  Blind unbelieving prophets as ye are  Fit hour ye chose ye murd'rers to embrue  Your cursed hands in that pure Victim's blood  Peaceoffering for the sins of lost mankind  Hence to your homes there meditate new plots  The fiends shall be your helpers to your thoughts  Present though not to sight they swarm around  Now here now there now hovering over head  Where as your enmity to CHRIST breaks forth  And your blaspheming voices fill the roof  Like steaming vapors from sulphureous lakes  Joyous they catch the welcome sounds and fan  With clapping wings the pestilential air  Applauding as they soar Now clear the hall  Yield up your seats ye substituted fiends  Hence minor daemons give your masters place  And hark the King of Terrors speaks the word  He calls his shadowy princes they start forth  Expand themselves to sight and throng the hall  A synod of infernals Forms more dire  Imagination shapes not when the wretch  Whom conscience haunts in the dead hour of night  Whilst all is dark and silent round his bed  Sees hideous phantoms in his fev'rish dream  That stare him into madness with fix'd eyes  And threat'ning faces floating in his brain  The ghostly monarch mounts the vacant throne  Gives sign for order the superiors sit  Each as his stellar attribute gives rank  And place peculiar the untitled stand  Circling their LUCIFER their fallen sun  He of his state more jealous as in heart  Conscious of faded glory in the midst  Now rising after many a hard essay  To wreathe his warworn face into a smile  Semblance at least of joy at length with voice  Screw'd to the pitch of triumph vaunting cries  Pow'rs and Dominions Lords by victory's right  Of earth and man now from his Maker won  By overthrow of Heav'n's last champion giv'n  In God's own city battle fairly gain'd  On hostile ground his Sion's sacred mount  Warriors your king applauds you Thanks brave friends  Now shall your temples with loud paeans ring  Your vindicated altars and your groves  Exhale rich clouds of incense steaming forth  From od'rous gums your statues gaily crown'd  With garlands every trophy that the art  Of painting or of sculpture can bestow  Shall be hung round to decorate your shrines  Your oracles henceforth shall find a voice  Which future CHRISTS shall never put to silence  And nations from your lips shall ask their fate  This day to all posterity shall be  Sacred to games processions triumphs feasts  And laurelcrowned bards shall hymn your praise  But sure no spirit of etherial mould  For such of right ye are will so forget  His native dignity as to repine  Or gloat with envy if I now demand  Your tribute of especial praise to him  Whom your joint suffrages deputed first  To this important embassy a spirit  Our subterranean empire cannot mate  For high authority and potent sway  O'er man's subjected heart MAMMON stand forth  Stand forth thou prosp'rous rich persuasive pow'r  Worshipp'd of all great idol of the world  May fortune on thy patient labors smile  Thou persevering deity Pursue  Thy darling metal through earth's central veins  Ransack her womb for mines send forth thy slaves  To undiscover'd realms and bid them sap  Potosi's glittering mountains for their ore  Pull down her golden temples strip her kings  Rack them with tortures wring their secrets out  By slowconsuming fires lay Nature waste  Let nothing mortal breathe upon the soil  That covers gold All hell applauds thy zeal  And all hell's engines shall assist thy search  He said and lo from either side the throne  Upon the signal a seraphic choir  In equal bands came forth the minstrels strike  Their golden harps swift o'er the sounding strings  Their flying fingers sweep whilst to the strain  Melodious voices though to heav'nly airs  Attun'd no longer still in sweet accord  Echo the festive song now full combin'd  Pouring the choral torrent on the ear  In parts responsive now warbling by turns  Their sprightly quick divisions swelling now  Through all the compass of their tuneful throats  Their varying cadences as fancy prompts  Whereat the Stygian herd like them of old  Lull'd by the Theban minstrel stood at gaze  Mute and appeas'd for music hath a voice  Which ev'n the devils obey and for a while  Sweet sounds shall lay their turbid hearts asleep  Charm'd into sweet oblivion and repose  The praise of MAMMON the rapt seraphs sung  And Gold's almighty pow'r free flow'd the verse  No need to call the Muse for all were there  Apollo and the Heliconian Maids  And all that pagan poet e'er invok'd  Were present to the song Above the flight  Of bold Alcaeus Tisias bard divine  Or Pindar's strain Olympic high it soar'd  In dithyrambic majesty sublime  At the right hand of hell's terrific Lord  MAMMON exalted sate and as the choir  Chanted their hymn his swelling bosom throbb'd  In concert with the strain pride flush'd his cheek  Furrow'd with care and toil his eyes now rais'd  From earth their proper center sparkling gleam'd  Malicious triumph whilst ovations loud  And thund'ring plaudits shook the trembling roof  The song was clos'd and order now resum'd  MAMMON stood forth to speak when ere the words  From his slow lips found way the infernal King  With eager action starting from his throne  Gave sign for silence and thus interpos'd  Pause worthy spi'rit awhile my mind forebodes  Cares more immediate for amid the throng  I spy our faithful CHEMOS well I know  'Tis not on slight occasion he hath left  The post assign'd him and behold his looks  Augur important tidings Fall back friends  And give our gallant centinel access  Obedient to the word the opening files  Fell back and let him pass he to the throne  Low rev'rence made and thus his chief address'd  Imperial Lord of this seraphic host  As I kept station on the faithless Mount  Where once my altar blaz'd revolted now  From it's allegiance and with olive crown'd  In token of God's peace I thence descried  By glimpse of the pale moon a vagrant train  With JESUS at their head fording the brook  As thither bound I couch'd upon the watch  So bidd'n and to their talk gave heedful ear  A melancholy theme the Master chose  Sadly he warns them of his own death's hour  Now near impending and how all shall fly  Like scatter'd sheep and their lone Shepherd leave  Forlorn abandon'd This the fiery zeal  Of PETER to our chief well known disclaims  Who boldly vouches though all else should swerve  His own unshaken constancy when CHRIST  Severe though not with railing him reproves  And solemnly denounces triple breach  Of this vain boast and instant for this night  Or e'er the cock's shrill trumpet twice shall sound  So CHRIST predicts he shall be thrice denied  Of this selfvaunting man All this I heard  And held it for my duty to report  What more ensu'd imperfectly I learn  For now the Master taketh three apart  And much disturb'd in soul and sore amaz'd  Wills them stand off and watch whilst he retires  And vents his grief in pray'r I saw him fall  Prostrate to earth and vent such heartfelt groans  That were I other than I am less wrong'd  Less hostile to the tyranny of Heaven  Whence I am exil'd I had then let fall  Weak pity's tear and been my nature's fool  But lords I cannot so forget your cause  Or my own wrongs nor would I wear a heart  Made of such melting stuff With noiseless tread  The kneeling Suppliant I approach'd and mark'd  His agony of soul whilst from his brow  I saw large drops and gouttes of bloody sweat  Incarnardine the dust on which they fell  Bear witness my revenge 'twas there ev'n there  The very spot on which he knelt and pray'd  Where now his blood wrung out by agony  As in atonement dropt on which my shrine  Rear'd by the wives of the uxorious king  Deck'd out with blazing tapers proudly shone  And front to front of God's own temple stood  Till Asa's parricidal hand pluck'd up  Maacha's groves and burnt my shrine to dust  Now hear the sequel As I stood at gaze  Noting his pray'r one of the heav'nly band  And of the highest GABRIEL with his spear  Couch'd as for combat started forth to view  And frowning bade me take my flight with speed  Nor trouble that just person Valiant peers  I am not one to back at his proud bidding  Nor ever did I turn my face to flight  Save in our army's universal rout  When all from heav'n fell headlong to the gulph  Such weapon as I had this trenchant sword  Of adamantine proof forthwith I drew  But ere my arm could wield it swift as thought  I felt his spear's sharp point with forceful thrust  Deep plung'd into my side Staggering amaz'd  I gave back so compell'd he still advanc'd  Arm'd for a second onset when my strength  Foil'd though immortal and my sight grown dim  My wound the whilst sore rankling I took wing  And hither came on painful pinions borne  Your faithful servant whether to attempt  Fresh battle or my present loss repair  This said he put his azure tunic by  And bar'd his wounded side where GABRIEL's spear  Had lodg'd it's massy fluke a ghastlychasm  Trench'd by the force of archangelic arm  And to aught else than deathless spirit death  Fir'd at the sight with eyes that sparkling blaz'd  SATAN uprose and thus infuriate spake  GABRIEL in arms Hah warriors we are brav'd  CHRIST hath his guard about him and defies us  If this immortal spirit could not stand  What shall ISCARIOT do Myself will forth  We shall then see who wields the stronger lance  SATAN or GABRIEL In the fields of heaven  In the midair on earth in deepest hell  He knows my might superior and shall rue  His dastardly assault Why not with me  The sender rather than the sent  this strife  So might he boast the contest though subdued  The scars by this sharp sword in battle dealt  Are the best honors GABRIEL hath to vaunt  The brightest laurels on his brow are those  I planted when in equal fight I deign'd  To measure spears with such inferior foe  Doth GABRIEL think God's favour can reverse  Immutable preeminence and raise  His menial sphere to that in which I shone  Son of the morning Doth he vainly hope  Exil'd from heav'n we left our courage there  Or lost it in our fall or that hell's fires  Have parch'd and wither'd our shrunk sinews up  Delusive hope the warrior's nerve is strung  By exercise by pain by glorious toil  The torrid clime of hell it's burning rock  It's gulph of liquid flames in which we roll'd  Have calcin'd our strong hearts breath'd their own fires  Into our veins and forg'd those nerves to steel  Which heav'n's calm aether her voluptuous skies  And frequent adorations well nigh smooth'd  To the soft flexibility of slaves  Till bold rebellion shook it's fetters off  And with their clangor rais'd so brave a storm  That God's eternal throne rock'd to it's base  Now break we up this council Each disperse  Or to his post his pleasure or pursuit  Sufficeth for this task my single arm  CHEMOS shall be reveng'd the public zeal  Of MAMMON still shall be our theme of praise  Nor shall ISCARIOT's nightly plot be foil'd  By intervening angels nor these priests  Whose seats we fill and whose allies we are  Fail of their victim or find us remiss  To second them in this our common league  And joint emprize against the pow'rs of Heav'n  'Twas said the princes of th' assembly rose  In reverence to his will the legion round  Smote on their shields the signal of assent  Tow'ring he stood the Majesty of Hell  Dark o'er his brows thick clouds of vengeance roll'd  Thunder was in his voice his eye shot fire  And loud he call'd for buckler and for spear  These bold AZAZEL bore enormous weight  For Atlantean spirit proper charge  With eager grasp he seiz'd the towering mast  And shook it like a twig then with a frown  That aw'd the stoutest heart gave sign for all  Strait to disperse and vanish'd from their sight  END OF THE THIRD BOOK  CALVARY OR  THE DEATH OF CHRIST  BOOK IV  THE ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK  A general review of Christ's agony in the garden His disciples who are ordered to watch fall asleep Christ prays apart he wakens them and warns them to watch left they enter into temptation Satan arrives and takes post near the spot where Christ is praying in his agony He is discovered by Gabriel the supporting angel their interview described Christ approaches and reproving Satan by the word of power casts him to the ground disabled and in torments Judas now advances with an armed company betrays his Master with a kiss Christ is seized and carried away to the palace of the high priest Satan unable to rise laments over his disconsolate condition He is discovered by Mammon who consoles him and assists in raising him from the ground Satan testifies to the power and divinity of Christ feels a presentiment of his impending doom and having delivered his last injunctions to Mammon is lifted from the earth by a stormy gust and carried through the air out fight of that evil spirit who terrified by the fate of his chief turns to flight and escapes  CALVARY  BOOK IV THE AGONY IN THE GARDEN  O MOUNT of Agony water'd with tears  From my Redeemer's eyes and by his knees  Pressing thy turf made sacred as the ground  Where ev'n the Chosen Shepherd might not stand  But with unsandal'd feet Ah where is now  That purifying Angel me to cleanse  From this vile world that so I may approach  Though but in thought with a right spi'rit renew'd  Thy hallow'd solitude Lo where the Lord  Sorrowing retires apart Where are the Three  Station'd to guard his sacred privacy  Stand they aloof as their forefathers stood  When from the midst of darkness cloud and fire  JEHOVAH thunder'd out of Sinai's mount  Ah no within that olive grove they lie  Stretch'd on the ground a drowsy slumb'ring guard  And could ye not ye sleepers watch one hour  For such a Master Oh what heart could taste  Of rest or peace whilst his was rack'd with pain  Was it the sighs his suffering virtue breath'd  Into the air of sad Gethsemane  That so entranc'd your senses Or was he  The strength'ning Angel sent from Heav'n to shield  The Savior's anguish from all human eyes  And veil the mystery of that awful hour  Then was that angry cup full mix'd and red  From God's right hand presented to his lips  The bitter essence of origi'nal sin  With every lifedestroying extract drawn  From man's corruption since were there infus'd  Compounded and resolved into that draught  Mix'd by the hand of Death and drugg'd in hell  The coward shrinking under fortune's blows  With desperate lip hath ofttimes drank and died  'Tis refuge 'tis desertion from a post  He dare defend no longer 'tis the hope  False fruitless hope of a perpetual sleep  When he hath bottom'd that Lethaean cup  But our Redeemer's potion was not such  Horrors and heartdissolving woes and pangs  That mock imagination's scope and stretch  The heart's strong cordage till it bursts asunder  And leaves the mind a wreck these were the drugs  That brew'd that cup of agony which God  Now tender'd as the wrathatoning draught  For a revolted world Mysterious act  The Father sacrifice the Son belov'd  The just to spare the unjust lay the rod  Upon the guiltless head Shall all offend  And One atone for all One Victim bear  The accumulated load of punishment  The mass of vengeance that amazing whole  Which each particu'lar sin had pil'd in store  And that devoted sacrifice a Lamb  Pure without spot or blemish O my soul  Beware nor to that tabernacle press  Where clouds and darkness canopy thy God  Lo where the Savior kneels he looks around  For some to succour to support some friend  Whose sympathising eye might beam upon him  And with a moment's glance of pity chear  His desolated spirit All around  Is vacant horror solitary dark  The partners of his heart the chosen few  The friends who should have watch'd are wrapt in sleep  Insensible supine oblivious sleep  Woes multiplied by woe and that the worst  Ingratitude the sharpest fang that gnaws  Man's bleeding bosom In this sad extreme  His soul revolting from the noisome draught  With eyes to Heav'n uplifted and a sigh  Which shew'd that human weakness then o'erpower'd  His soul's diviner partAbba he cries  Father all things are possible to Thee  Remove this cupThen bows his patient head  And qualifies the pray'rYet not my will  But Thine be doneNo voice from Heav'n replies  All Nature sleeps in silence still as death  As if the planets in their spheres had paus'd  To watch the trembling balance on whose point  The fortunes of this globe suspended hung  It's ruin or redemption death or life  'Twas then the strength'ning Angel dealt the blow  That put the hovering spy of hell to flight  Seen of our Lord in ambush where he lay  And now the Mourner rises from the earth  On which he knelt and a few paces moves  Pensive and slow to find his station'd friends  He finds them not as friends upon the watch  Not as God's faithful soldiers should be found  But at their length stretch'd out in lazy sleep  With folded arms supine Rous'd by his voice  They stare they start confounded and amaz'd  Could ye not watch one hour the Sufferer cries  Watch for the foe of man is near at hand  Pray lest ye fall into the Tempter's snare  The spi'rit is ready but the flesh is weak  So warn'd he leaves them with this mild rebuke  A second time he seeks the dismal dell  Again he prays remission of his woe  And deprecates the agonizing cup  Meanwhile his drowsy centinels perceive  A languor which their senses must obey  And down they sink their leaden eyeballs clos'd  As in a deathlike trance Again he comes  Again he calls a second warning gives  And so departsNow SATAN on the wing  Swift as a fiery meteor rides the air  With shield and spear arm'd at all points for war  Then down at once with huge Titanian bulk  Plumb down he lights upon the solid soil  Hard by th' angelic post Earth felt the shock  And trembling to her center inly groan'd  Nor did his haughty courage deign to crouch  Or lurk with lion watch but firm of foot  Erect and confident in arms he stood  As one whose prowess all advantage scorn'd  And mean surprize of an unguarded foe  Such arts to weaker spirits he resign'd  He of his former self felt no decay  Or feeling scorn'd confession for his pride  Still deem'd that heav'n though lost contain'd no peer  To mate with him in hardihood and proof  Save only the Almighty to such heighth  Of arrogance had pow'r long time usurp'd  Over the Gentile nations and the sight  Of God's own Son now as he falsely deem'd  Vanquish'd and prostrate swell'd his impious heart  Our blessed Lord meanwhile having preferr'd  For the last time his interceding prayer  Summon'd his strength and conscious that the hour  Was come which finish'd or revok'd the task  Of man's redemption from the powers of hell  Whose representative hard by at hand  Stood eager to arrest the forfeit prize  Put forth his hand and as he took the cup  SATAN who stood spectator of the deed  Started aghast cold tremor shook his joints  His threat'ning spear now droop'd and his broad shield  So proudly borne aloft weigh'd down his arm  Slack and unnerv'd confusion seiz'd his heart  And his high courage quail'd This GABRIEL saw  Yet left he not his post till CHRIST had drain'd  The cup mysterious to its lowest dregs  He drank it now convulsion shook the fiend  Death shriek'd amain and through his hollow ribs  Drove his own ebon dart with desp'rate rage  Bitter the draught and hateful to the taste  But Immortality had crown'd the cup  And Light and Life on phoenix wings sprung forth  From the foul dregs in newborn glories bright  GABRIEL who knew that by this solemn act  Thus happily perform'd his charge expir'd  Now turn'd away in search of that fierce spi'rit  Whom thro' the darkling covert he had seen  Whilst by the side of God's afflicted Son  Minist'ring he stood Right well he knew the form  And towering port of hell's terrific King  Nor had the dire confusion and dismay  Of that fell daemon scap'd th' angelic glance  Him now within a gloomy dell retir'd  To further distance wrapt as it should seem  In pensive thought the Guardian Seraph spied  In the same moment SATAN's ghastly eye  Glanc'd on his foe bright in caerulean arms  Heav'n's champion shone high o'er his crested helm  The archangelic plume triformed wav'd  Ensign of throned state and high command  The grifly monarch gnash'd his teeth with spite  To find himself encounter'd at such odds  His foe fresh blooming in immortal youth  Vigorous in heav'nlytemper'd armor brac'd  Himself at this ill hour surpriz'd his strength  As by enchantment blasted and that voice  Which in the ears of all hell's princes vouch'd  Such bold achievements shrunk from it's high pitch  To feeble murmurs and weak whining sighs  So when on Zama's plain the rival chiefs  Rome's consul and the Punic captain met  To parley in midway 'twixt either camp  The warworn veteran blighted and defac'd  By wint'ry marches over noisome fens  And snows on mountains pil'd with envious eye  Sole relick of his toil survey'd the form  And blooming features of his youthful foe  Then to his mind recalling glories past  When his proud menace aw'd immortal Rome  Sigh'd to reflect how far in the decline  From that bright morn his evening sun had sunk  Then ey'd the youth again and in his face  Shadow'd by fate saw Carthage doom'd to fall  And his own glories to a foe transferr'd  Less than his equal once his conqu'ror now  But 'twas not long that SATAN so endur'd  For now the conscious sense of former deeds  Bold though unblest and high innate disdain  Of mean capitulation and demur  Rous'd his proud heart like a hot courser spurr'd  To chase and lash his languid courage up  Red'ning he swell'd and gnaw'd his nether lip  For vengeance that it would not give him words  To hurl defiance on th' advancing foe  When GABRIEL noting his disorder'd mien  And haggard aspect strait bespoke the fiend  Thus ever may the foe of CHRIST be found  Speechless abash'd struck down of Heav'n and quell'd  How long malicious Spi'rit wilt thou persist  To trouble this vex'd earth How long to haunt  This righteous person whole strong virtue mocks  Thy faint attempts Warn'd by this shame avaunt  Hence baffled Tempter roaming thus at large  Thou dost but shew by melancholy proof  That a tormented conscience never rests  As the fierce panther through the ribs transfix'd  Writhes round the bloody weapon in his side  And tugs it to and fro with foamy teeth  Mad'ning with pain and gnashing at his wound  So 'gainst himself and foe alike enrag'd  Hell's gloomy Lord by this deserved taunt  Cut to the heart with many a hard essay  Struggled for voice at length collecting breath  These words disdainful though of their full tone  And energy abated found their way  GABRIEL the brave in danger earn renown  True valor spares the weak but thou more wise  Than valiant studiest well the safer hour  When to come forth and wage inglorious war  'Gainst unprovided foes if CHEMOS then  Or some slight Cherub cross thy wary path  Woe to the straggler if thy barbed spear  Can make safe tilt at his unweapon'd side  But I who day and night have pac'd this globe  Found in all quarters I who never shun'd  Rather have sought thy walk am left to roam  Free and of thee unquestion'd from the hour  When on the confines of this newmade world  We parlied under Eden's shady fence  To th' instant now when faint and ill at ease  Unwarlike Angel thou hast found me here  Nerveless and little more than match for thee  To whom th' indignant Virtue thus reply'd  If SATAN here is found in evil plight  He's found of me unsought Thine own dark wiles  Degen'rate Spi'rit and Heav'n's allruling hand  Have cast thee in my way Must I turn off  From duty's road direct because forsooth  A wounded adder hisses in my path  Why didst thou press into this place of prayer  This hallow'd solitude where CHRIST hath breath'd  A charm that withers up thy blasted strength  Could'st thou not learn by late experience taught  There is a sphere about the Son of God  In which no spi'rit like thee accurst can draw  His breath blaspheming At a word begone  Though with my foot I could have spurn'd thee hence  I tread not on the fall'n nor do I vaunt  Conquest of thee that to a mightier arm  Rebel to God to God's own Son thou ow'st  To CHRIST not GABRIEL Nor shalt thou alone  Stoop to his name but every idol God  And ev'ry pow'r of darkness with their prince  And Sin hellborn and thy soul offspring Death  Whereto by these prophetic words appall'd  SATAN with taunting argument replied  Since this angelic form from death exempt  Sometimes shall yield to aches and transient pains  And natural ailments for awhile endur'd  What wonder if etherial spi'rit like me  Pent in this atmosphere and fain to breathe  The lazy fogs of this unwholesome earth  Pine for his native clime What if he droop  Worn out with care and toil Wert thou as I  Driv'n to and fro and by God's thunder hurl'd  From Heav'n's high ramparts would that silken form  Abide the tossing on hell's fiery lake  Hadst thou like me travers'd the vast profound  Of antient Night and beat the weary wing  Through stormy Chaos voyage rude as this  Wou'd ruffle those fine plumes I've kept my course  Through hurricanes the least of which let loose  On this firm globe would winnow it to dust  Snap like a weaver's thread the mighty chain  That links it to heav'n's adamantine floor  And whirl it through the Infinite of Space  And what hast thou soft Cherub done the whilst  What are thy labors What hast thou atchiev'd  Heav'n knows no winter there no tempests howl  To breathe perpetual spring to sleep supine  On flowery beds of amaranth and rose  Voluptuous slavery was GABRIEL's choice  His bosom never drew th' indignant sigh  That rent my heart when call'd to morning hymn  I paid compulsive homage at God's throne  Warbling feign'd hallelujahs to his praise  Spirits of abject mould and such art thou  May call this easy service for they love  Ignoble ease to me the fulsome task  Was bitterest slavery and though I fell  I fell opposing exil'd both from heav'n  Freedom and I shar'd the same glorious fall  Go back then to thy drudgery of praise  Practise new canticles and tune thy throat  To flattery's fawning pitch leave me my groans  Leave me to teach these echoes how to curse  Here let me lie and make this rugged stone  My couch my canopy this stormy cloud  That rolls stern winter o'er my fenceless head  'Tis freedom's privilege nor tribute owes  Nor tribute pays to Heav'n's despotic King  Thus whilst he spake the Savior of mankind  New ris'n from pray'r drew nigh whereat the fiend  Or e'er the awful presence met his eye  Shivering as one by sudden fever seiz'd  Turn'd deadly pale then fell to earth convuls'd  Dire were the yells he vented fierce the throes  That writh'd his toitur'd frame whilst through the seams  And chinks that in his jointed armour gap'd  Blue sulph'rous flames in livid flashes burst  So hot the hell within his fuel'd heart  Which like a furnace sev'n times heated rag'd  Meanwhile the winged Messenger of Heaven  GABRIEL with horror and amazement fix'd  Stood motionless behind his orbed shield  Not so the Savior he with look compos'd  And stedfast noting the disastrous plight  Of that tormented fiend these words address'd  SATAN thou see'st the serpent's primal curse  At length falls heavy on thy bruised head  When man lost Paradise by thee betray'd  This was thy doom Deceiver and although  Ages have roll'd on ages since yet God  Who from eternal to eternal lives  Blessed for evermore computes not time  As thou whose mis'ry makes short years seem long  Yet was the interim thine and thou who first  Brought'st sin into the world hast reign'd in sin  Thou hadst the power of death but I through death  Am destin'd to destroy that power and thee  And now my hour is come I go to death  That all through me may live therefore begone  Get thee behind me Thou hast now no part  On earth thy dwelling is prepar'd in hell  There when we meet expect to meet thy doom  This said the fiend replied not but with groans  Nor staid the Angel longer than to turn  One last sad look upon his prostrate foe  Then flew to heav'n The Savior bent his steps  In search of his disciples them he found  Wrapt as before in sleepSleep on he cried  And henceforth take your rest It is enough  The hour is come Behold the Son of man  Into the hands of sinners is betray'd  Rise let us go The traitor is at hand  And lo while yet he spake a mingled crew  Arm'd and unarm'd approach before them all  JUDAS advancing thus bespeaks the throng  Whom I shall kiss is He the CHRIST Him seize  And in safe keeping holdUpon the word  He gives the trait'rous greeting and exclaims  Hail MasterWhen at once the swarming crowd  Rush in a space then stand in circle round  Like bloodhounds held at bay their eager eyes  Fix'd on his face which to behold they rear  Their flaming torches whilst the prospect round  Glares with the ruddy blaze a ghastly troop  Like that dread chorus which the tragic bard  Pour'd on the scene when the Athenian wives  Dropt their abortive burthens with affright  To see their snaky locks and fiery brands  Kindled in Phlegethon's sulphureous waves  So glares that haggard crew in front they see  JESUS in conscious majesty unmov'd  Behind him to some little space withdrawn  PETER and JAMES and JOHN the chosen Three  Small band but in their Leader's power a host  Invincible 'gainst whom whole armies leagu'd  Were but as chaff before the whirlwind's blast  Had he so will'd but now with accent firm  Whom seek ye he demands They answer make  JESUS of NazarethI am the man  JESUS replies He whom ye seek is found  His air his utterance and that voice divine  Which could have arm'd Heav'n's legions in his cause  Or gulph'd them to the center at a word  Swift as the vollied thunder smote their hearts  And hurl'd them to the ground Headlong they fell  With hideous crash nor ever thence had ris'n  Had not his gracious purpose so decreed  For man's redemption Up they rise from earth  And in like manner to the same demand  A second time make answer he repeats  I told you and ye heard that I am He  If therefore me ye seek let these depart  Then burst the chidden zeal of PETER forth  Arm'd with a sword he rush'd upon the throng  And at the foremost aim'd a random blow  That gash'd the caitiff's head but miss'd the life  Put up thy sword rash man the Savior cries  Did I want rescue would I ask of thee  With all my Father's Angels at command  No let me do His will and drink His cup  And you that here encompass me about  As 'twere a felon ye came out to take  With swords and staves suffer thus far behold  The wound his weapon makes my touch shall heal  'Tis done Know all that they who take the sword  Shall perish by the sword What needs this stir  This midnight plotting and this traitor's kiss  These staves these torches and this arm'd array  To make one harmless peaceful man your prize  You saw me daily in my public walks  Freely we commun'd for you harm'd me not  You heard me in the Temple for I taught  In very zeal the simple way of truth  Lab'ring full hard to turn your hearts to God  If this were my offence why not arrest  Your Preacher in the act and drag to death  Him who would fain have train'd you in the road  To life eternal Never on the poor  Turn'd I my back I courted not the rich  Were this my fault in the broad face of day  Ye might have smitten me and earn'd the praise  Of the proud Pharisee and braggart Scribe  I fed the hungry and I heal'd your sick  I succour'd the tormented and possest  Are these the heinous acts for which I die  In field in city in frequented ways  The wretched flock'd around if these be crimes  Why is their punishment so long reserv'd  To this dark hour of night The sun himself  Witness'd my doings so might he my death  But see my followers are dispers'd and fled  And I stand in your peril here alone  No need to fear him who makes no defence  Conduct me to my doom God's will be done  This said their sacrilegious hands they laid  Upon his sacred person He in' the midst  With meek composure and submitted look  March'd slowly onward as they led the way  To the proud dome of CAIAPHAS highpriest  Of MOLOCH than of God more fitly call'd  Oh ye hard hearts was this the Paschal Lamb  Ye worse than pagan butchers whom ye cull'd  Pure and unspotted for your bloody feast  Well did your lawgiver decree this day  A record and memorial to be kept  Throughout your generations to all time  A memorable day a noted feast  Your stubborn incredulity hath made it  To you a day of darkness and disgrace  To us Salvation's glorious dawn to us  By our great Captain led the Lord of Life  Who through the darksome avenue of death  And depths mysterious of the mazy grave  Holding the clue of prophecy in hand  Unravell'd all the ways of Providence  And to our view set ope the golden gates  Of Paradise regain'd whence light and life  And bliss eternal beam on all mankind  For all who with their lips confess the Lord  And in their hearts believe that from the dead  God in his pow'r hath rais'd him shall be sav'd  Meanwhile the prince of hell whom CHRIST had left  Rolling in torments on the stony rock  Mad as leviathan when tempestwreck'd  Flound'ring he lies upon the shoaly beach  Now to one last and desperate effort driv'n  Straining each nerve with many a dolorous groan  Half his huge length had rear'd His right hand grasp'd  His spear the other on his buckler propp'd  Pillow'd his head raging with pain and thoughts  Black as the night around him To arise  And stand surpass'd his power in vain he spread  His feathery vans to raise him in the air  About him all the ground with azure plumes  Beat from his shatter'd pinions was bestrewn  Despair now seiz'd him now too late he rued  His blasphemies and bold rebellious taunts  'Gainst Heav'n's Omnipotent his Judge incens'd  Hopeless of mercy now he curs'd his doom  Of immortality and as he roll'd  His haggard eyes in night hell's flaming gulph  Terrific vision seem'd to burst upon him  With treble horrors charg'd then with a sigh  That strain'd his heaving cors'let he breath'd forth  In murmuring lamentations these sad words  Ah who will lift me from this iron bed  On which Prometheuslike for ever link'd  And rivetted by dire necessity  I'm doom'd to lie and wail the cruel boon  Of immortality my baneful fate  O earth earth earth Cannot my groans pervade  Thy stony heart to' embowel me alive  Under this rock before tomorrow's sun  Find me here weltering in the sordid dust  A spectacle of scorn to all my host  Wont to behold in me their kingly chief  Will not some pitying earthquake gulph me down  To where the everlasting fountains sleep  That in those wat'ry caverns I might slake  These fires that shrivel my parch'd sinews up  Ah whither shall I turn who will unbrace  This scalding mail that burns my tortur'd breast  Worse than the shirt of Nessus Oh for pity  Grant me a moment's interval of ease  Avenging angry Deity Draw back  Thy red right hand that with the light'ning arm'd  Thrust to my heart makes all my boiling blood  Hiss in my veins or if thou wilt destroy  Whom thou hast vanquish'd terminate these feuds  'Twixt good and evil thee and me reduce  This incorruptible to mould'ring dust  Make Death a parricide and so conclude  Me and my sufferings and my sins at once  But 'twill not be Happy I might have been  Immortal I must be God can create  Nothing but bliss I made the pains I feel  Sorrow had no existence Death no name  'Till I lost heav'n to be was to be blest  And beings blest could never cease to be  This earth and man its habitant were good  Till envy pride rebellion in my heart  Engend'ring marr'd God's perfect work with sin  And but for sin the universe were heav'n  So am I author of the hell within me  And these tormenting fires God cannot quench  For that would be to turn from what he is  Parent of good and to become like me  Patron and friend of evil Reas'ning thus  I must renounce all hope of future peace  And wage eternal enmity with God  Whom longer to oppose I now despair  And under whose strong hand weigh'd down to earth  Prostrate confounded I can rise no more  Must I be ever thus Must these fierce pangs  Or worse if worse can be torment me ever  Are there no means to make a truce with Heav'n  Submission penitence atonement pray'rs  And intercessionsOh fallacious vain  Impracticable terms Can pride shed tears  Falsehood keep faith or perjury pass it's oath  Upon that Judge to whom all hearts are known  It cannot be Ages of sin have roll'd  'Twixt me and pardon gulph impassable  Man's loss of Paradise a delug'd world  Sin paramount on earth the nations turn'd  From God to idols scarce a remnant left  Of this his chosen race corruption spread  Ev'n to' the heart of Judah' and from this Mount  Sad witness of my overthrow and shame  Scene of my triumphs once his standard torn  And hell's proud banners flanting in it's place  These and a countless multitude of wrongs  Cry in the catalogue so loud against me  That should the thunder of God's vengeance sleep  Mercy herself would seize th' uplifted bolt  And speed the ling'ring blow What is my hope  If such the task to purchase peace for man  Man so subordinate in sin to me  The spring and fountainhead of that soul stream  Which he at distance drank If CHRIST must die  For man if nothing less than God's own Son  Can stand betwixt the Father's wrath and man  What mediator can be found for me  None and no wonder if his wrath withdrawn  From man now pardon'd fall with worse recoil  On my devoted head Ev'n now it falls  Me like an eagle in my tow'ring flight  From the proud zenith of the sun's bright sphere  Headlong he hurls to earth with shatter'd wing  And plumes dishevell'd grov'ling in the dust  Me the sole mover of man's foul revolt  He marks for tenfold vengeance for if CHRIST  The patient meek Redeemer groans in pain  What shall the Tempter feel If on the rack  Of agony his guiltless brow sweats blood  Well may this body' of sin burst out in flames  A conflagration horrible to sight  And blazing beacon to th' astonish'd world  And what is this vile JUDAS who seduc'd  By wily MAMMON sells his Master's life  What PETER's self whom had not JESUS pray'd  I'd sifted into chaff These purblind priests  Who with their halfshut eyes askance behold  Their own Messias in his wond'rous acts  Yet give those wonders to the powers of hell  And trembling for their craft complot his death  What are they Whence but from myself their lyes  'Tis I in them and not they of themselves  That kill the Prince of Peace his guiltless blood  Sprinkles their hands but in a floodgate tide  Redder than scarlet whelms my sinking soul  He ceas'd and in his mantle hid his face  For shame and sorrow to be thus surpriz'd  For MAMMON ever on the foot by night  Had spied him through the gloom and thus began  What ails thee Prince of air that here thou liest  On the dull earth not resting it should seem  From victory but vanquish'd and o'erthrown  Vanquish'd alas and in the dust o'erthrown  By God's allpow'rful Son SATAN replied  Too sure I am and how it wrings this heart  So to be found of thee words cannot speak  Yet thou of all the spirits heav'n hath lost  Art he of whom my pride hath least to fear  For thou wilt not as others gall my spleen  With scorn and taunting Thou a friendly chief  Hast pity for the sorrows of a friend  To thee my valor and deserts are known  For thou wert ever nearest where I fought  In front of danger on the battle's edge  Thou know'st the hazard and the chance of war  And with what malice fortune thwarts our best  Our bravest efforts Scarr'd thyself with wounds  Thou from the wounded wilt not turn aside  Therefore O MAMMON as my hand to thee  Were present didst thou need it so to me  Thy sovereign in distress reach forth thine hand  And if thou canst upraise me from this fall  If thou canst not let not my armies know  Their leader's fate be mindful of my fame  And bury this sad secret in thy breast  He said nor need had he of further suit  For MAMMON now had put forth all his strength  To raise him from the ground in his strong grasp  He seiz'd his giant limbs in armour clad  Of adamant and gold a ponderous wreck  Earth trembled with the shock dire were the groans  Hell's Monarch vented horrible the pains  That rack'd his stiffen'd joints yet on he toil'd  Till by Heav'n's sufferance rather than by aid  Of arm angelic once again he rear'd  His huge Titanian stature to the skies  And stood yet not as late with look erect  And lofty mien Ruin was in his face  Sordid and soil'd with ignominious dust  His robe imperial and his azure wings  And glossy locks that o'er his shoulders curl'd  Dishevell'd now and in like tatter'd trim  With vessel tempesttorn or by the force  Of engines weigh'd from bottom of the deep  Founder'd in creek or harbor where she lay  Gulph'd in the slimy ooze when MAMMON thus  Joy to our gallant Leader Once again  With firm foot planted on the subject earth  We stand as spi'rits by our own strength redeem'd  Erect and dauntless Wherefore droops that eye  As it would root itself into the soil  From which with vigor new restor'd you rise  Antaeuslike indignant of defeat  Oft when in search of gold or silver ore  In earth's metallic veins I've labor'd long  And hard in damp and darksome caverns pent  Mining the solid rock at length to light  And the free air emerg'd I've found my limbs  Stiffen'd with cramps or with cold ague numb'd  Yet never did my patient courage droop  Or slack it's gainful toil I am not apt  When wealth or glory can be bought with pain  To stagger at the terms and if it please  Heav'n's Monarch in his vengeance to attach  To this eternal be'ing eternal pain  Good hope as poisons may be sheath'd by use  So long familiarity with pain  May draw it's sting and habitude convert  It's hostile property to friendly ease  But thy great heart perhaps is rent with grief  Of pain disdainful as of lesser ill  And wherefore grieve Our joys were lost with heaven  Our passions all revers'd our natures chang'd  Virtues to vices amity to hate  Deeds that in heav'n had been our shame in hell  Become our glory' and whilst the world endures  Whilst evil is to good oppos'd we keep  The fight at doubtful issue ofttimes win  The glorious field and triumph over God  Why did I tempt ISCARIOT to betray  His guiltless Master 'Twas not that I lov'd  The traitor no the treason was my joy  I laugh at fools in their own folly caught  The wretch I tempted him I shall destroy  And like a wornout weapon cast him by  He shall not live to see his Master's fall  And for the sorry purchase of his sin  He shall but touch the adder's sting and die  So much for JUDAS Thus at once I slay  Two victims and refine upon revenge  To whom with clouded brow and nothing cheer'd  By this discourse hell's gloomy Power replied  MAMMON you well describe the rueful change  Wrought in us by our overthrow from heav'n  And for such solace as in thought you find  Pondering the sad eternity of pain  My argument shall never be employ'd  To make that little less but when you vaunt  ISCARIOT's treason and th' impending fall  Of that just Person now before the bar  Of envious judges who shall doom his death  You vaunt a deed which though the' elect of hell  Jointly with me advis'd brings on us all  Ruin with loss of empire and all hope  So quenches nought can stand us now in stead  But patience and your reconciling rules  To wont our natures to eternal pain  My potency you know and can you think  Less than the hand of God could hurl me down  To misery like this It must be God  Who speaks in CHRIST the Father in the Son  Though meek Almighty he controuls the world  And me the world's late master he destroys  Sin my begotten and Sin's offspring Death  Oh that I never had approach'd him more  Foil'd in my first temptation Now ev'n now  I feel a nature in me not mine own  That is my master and against my will  Enforces truths prophetic from my tongue  Making me rev'rence whom in heart I hate  I feel that now though lifted from the ground  I stand or move or speak but as he wills  By influence not by freedom I perceive  These exhalations that the night breathes on me  Are loaded with the vaporous steams of hell  I scent them in the air and well I know  The angel of destruction is abroad  I cannot fly from fate the man foredoom'd  To bruise my head is CHRIST the time is come  The prophecy is full exil'd from hence  As first from heav'n my reign on earth is o'er  And my last care is for those hapless friends  The partners of my fall when I am gone  Left like a headless trunk Warn them to fly  Impending ruin sure I am when CHRIST  Breathes forth his sacred spi'rit into the air  His dying gasp shall blow them like a spell  To the four winds of heav'n Let them be gone  In time and ply the wing there's shelter yet  In this wide world for them Though I must hence  They may abide and though their names be lost  Their altars levell'd and their idols maim'd  Yet shall their arts and offices endure  Their influences still shall draw the hearts  Of many sin shall not at once secede  From earth nor darkness wholly yield to light  To thee auspicious spi'rit whose potent arm  Hath rais'd me from the ground I can assure  A longer term of residence and power  Thy empire in earth's inmost centre roots  Thy influence circulates through all her veins  Nor earth alone but ocean wafts to thee  Continual tribute commerce hails thy name  In thee war triumphs thee fair peace adores  And gilds the feathers of her dove with gold  To dedicate to thee her worldly god  Thee the last foe whom CHRIST shall chase from earth  So spake the parting fiend in his last hour  Prophetic father though he were of lyes  To him the inferior daemon answer none  Attempted but in ghastly silence stood  Gazing with horror on his chieftain's face  That chang'd all hues by fits as when the north  With nitrous vapors charg'd convulsive shoots  It's fiery darts athwart the trembling pole  Making heav'n's vault a canopy of blood  So o'er the visage of the exorcis'd fiend  Alternate gleams like meteors came and went  And ever and anon he beat his breast  That quick and short with lab'ring pulses heav'd  One piteous look he upward turn'd one sigh  From his sad heart he fain had sent to heav'n  But ere the hopeless messenger could leave  His quiv'ring lips by sudden impulse seiz'd  He finds himself uplifted from the earth  His azure wings to sooty black now chang'd  In wide expanse from either shoulder stretch  For flight involuntary Up he springs  Whirl'd in a fiery vortex round and round  As when the Lybian wilderness caught up  In sandy pillar by the eddying winds  Moves horrible the grave of man and beast  Him thus ascending the fork'd light'ning smites  With sidelong volley whilst loud thunders rock  Heav'n's echoing vault when all at once behold  Caught in the stream of an impetuous gust  High in midair swift on the level wing  Northward he shoots and like a comet leaves  Long fiery track behind speeding his course  Strait to the realms of Chaos and old Night  Hellbound and to Tartarean darkness doom'd  His sad associate left on earth look'd up  And with like conscious terror ey'd his flight  As when the merchant trembling for his freight  Looks seaward from some promontory's top  And thence descries his gallant bark a wreck  Driving at mercy of the winds and waves  Full on the rocky shoal her certain grave  Then having bid farewell to all his hope  In this one bottom stor'd now lost to sight  Turns with a sigh aside and o'er the strand  With heavy heart takes homeward his slow way  So sigh'd the fiend and for his own sad fate  Trembling yet fearful to attempt the wing  Slunk cow'ring off veil'd in the shades of night  END OF THE FOURTH BOOK  CALVARY OR  THE DEATH OF CHRIST  BOOK V  THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH BOOK  This Book proposing to treat of the trial and condemnation of Christ opens with an invocation to the Evangelists the sacred historians of that eventChrist brought before the priests and elders in council accused by the witnesses interrogated by Caiaphas persists in keeping silence till being solemnly called upon to declare himself he answers by an affirmation of the truth Instantly all voices are let loose upon him accusing him of blasphemy and pronouncing him worthy of death He is delivered over to mockery and insult The Jews resolve to arraign him before Pilate on the following morning He turns and looks upon Peter who according to prediction had three several times denied him The sorrow and contrition of that Disciple is described he retires apart to bewail his crime and supplicate forgiveness His prayer and confession in the templeporch The council of the Jews resort to Pilate next morning and appeal against Christ He informs them that by the Roman law no judgment can be given till the accused is confronted with his accusers and heard in his defence Now commences the trial of Christ before Pilate who finding nothing worthy of death in that just person refers him to Herod as belonging to his jurisdiction Herod after mocking him arrays him in a gorgeous robe and in that apparel sends him back to Pilate He again appears in the judgment hall before Pilate who after many fruitless efforts to save him the Jews still urging him by their clamorous importunity to crucify him finding no other way to prevent a tumult of the people after declaring himself innocent of the blood of Jesus by the ceremony of washing his hands before the multitude delivers him to be crucified  CALVARY  BOOK V THE CONDEMNATION OF CHRIST  YE sacred Guides whose plain unvarnish'd page  Penn'd by the hand of Truth records the scene  Where CHRIST before the bar of impious men  Patient of all their scorn arraign'd betray'd  And of his own abandon'd silent stands  You I invoke so from the same pure source  Whence my faith flows shall also flow my song  Not idly babbling like that shallow rill  Trickling at foot of the Parnassian Mount  But deep serene to hallow'd airs attun'd  Aid me from Heav'n where now before God's throne  In evangelic attributes ye stand  Sixwing'd and thick bespangled o'er with eyes  Ranging all points before you and behind  Seraphic minstrels chanting day and night  Your ceaseless hallelujahs to the name  Of Him who was and is and is to come  Led by your hand with trembling step I press  The sacred ground which my Redeemer trode  Now like a lamb to slaughter led and now  Pendent Oh horror on the bloody tree  And whilst to tell his sacrifice of love  His souldissolving agonies I strive  My heart melts into sorrows deep as those  When the sad daughters of Jerusalem  Water'd his passage to the cross with tears  Musing my pious theme as fits a bard  Far onward in the wint'ry track of age  I shun the Muses haunts nor dalliance hold  With fancy by the way but travel on  My mournful road a pilgrim grey with years  One that finds little favor with the world  Yet thankful for it's least benevolence  And patient of it's taunts for never yet  Lur'd I the popu'lar ear with gibing tales  Or sacrific'd the modesty of song  Harping lewd madrigals at drunken feasts  To make the vulgar sport and win their shout  Me rather the still voice delights the praise  Whisper'd not publish'd by fame's braying trump  Be thou my herald Nature Let me please  The sacred few let my remembrance live  Embosom'd by the virtuous and the wise  Make me O Heav'n by those who love thee lov'd  So when the widow's and the children's tears  Shall sprinkle the cold dust in which I sleep  Pompless and from a scornful world withdrawn  The laurel which it's malice rent shall shoot  So water'd into life and mantling throw  It's verdant honors o'er my grassy tomb  Here in midway of my unfinish'd course  Doubtful of future time whilst now I pause  To fetch new breath and trim my waining lamp  Fountain of Life if I have still ador'd  Thy mercy and remember'd Thee with awe  Ev'n in my mirth in the gay prime of youth  So conscience witnesses the mental scribe  That registers my errors quits me here  Propitious Pow'r support me and if death  Near at the farthest meditates the blow  To cut me short in my prevented task  Spare me a little and put by the stroke  Till I recount his overthrow and hail  Thy Son victorious rising from the grave  Now to that dismal scene return my thoughts  Where CHRIST in midst of an irreverent crew  Usher'd by torches through the darkling streets  And now at summit of the holy Mount  Arriv'd before the pontiff's lofty gate  Waiting the call of impious pride attends  The halls and lobbies vomit forth a swarm  Of saucy servitors with ideot stare  Gazing the wond'rous Man and venting loud  Their coward mockeries He stands unmov'd  Great is the stir within and on the post  Through all the palace runs the buzzing news  Of this great Prophet's capture circling round  With ever new enlargement of strange sights  And fearful doings in the garden seen  Of those who took him CAIAPHAS meanwhile  Summons the Templechiefs elders and scribes  A hasty Sanhedrim No longer now  With stately step in measur'd pace they march  Huddled together by their fears they flock  They cluster in a throng safest so deem'd  And fill the council seats In speech abrupt  And brief their hierarch the cause expounds  Of their so sudden meetingCHRIST is seiz'd  The Prophet whom they dreaded is in hold  Th'Enchanter who by league with Belzebub  Scar'd them with magic spells is at their door  Now is the time to put his art to proof  Now is the moment to decide if thus  Their unreveal'd Messias shall appear  After long promise in this abject state  A shackled pris'ner or a conquering king  Admit him with faint voice some two or three  Of the least timorous cryBehold he comes  The rabble throng rush in and at the bar  Of the immur'd divan present him bound  With cords his raiment soil'd with hands profane  His head uncover'd and his sacred locks  By the rude winds and ruder men despoil'd  Of their propriety dishevell'd spread  Like shatter'd fragments on the branching top  Of piny Lebanon after a storm  Silence now reign'd the roar of tongues was hush'd  And expectation with suspended breath  Sate watchful when some sign or word of power  Should in a miracle break forth upon them  None such that patient Sufferer vouchsaf'd  Nor menace nor complaint his eye bespake  But meek serene composure Noting this  As cowards out of danger loudest vaunt  The council now took heart Then soon were heard  The lying tongues of witnesses suborn'd  Various and loud but these no order kept  Falshood with falshood clash'd and each to each  Irreconcileable as all to truth  Shame held the council mute for vilest hearts  Cloak'd in the robes of judgment will affect  Some outward shew of what they ought to be  Then most malicious when most seeming just  Confusion now ensu'd and perjury  In it's own labyrinth had lost itself  When some of graver note within the pale  Of justice seated but far thence remov'd  In conscience and in heart started new charge  Averring they had heard the Pris'ner say  I will destroy this temple made with hands  And within three days will another build  Made without handsThe charge was gravely urg'd  And colour'd to the semblance of a plot  Breath'd sacrilegious menace to God's house  Fit matter for descant pontifical  When CAIAPHAS as foremost in degree  So first to sound forth danger and affix  Solemnity to malice from his state  With magisterial dignity arose  And sternly fixing on the face divine  His eye inquisitorial thus began  Hear'st thou what these alledge The words in charge  Stand witness'd by these present Face to face  Th' accusers they and thou th' accused meet  Justice is open What is thy defence  Answerest thou nothingNothing answer'd he  But as a lamb before it's shearers mute  He open'd not his mouth the mystery couch'd  Under those words prophetic of his death  And following resurrection to expound  To their perverted minds beseem'd not him  Searcher of hearts and Savior of mankind  Silent not pertinacious he endur'd  Their scorn nor did his meek demeanour shew  More than the dignity of conscious truth  Which knows itself prejudg'd and scorns a plea  But CAIAPHAS who brook'd not this repulse  And still occasion sought from his own lips  By subtlety to' ensnare him thus reurg'd  Question with solemn adjuration back'd  Hear me thou man accus'd and answer make  I do adjure thee by the living God  To what I now demand Art thou the CHRIST  The very CHRIST Son of th' eternal God  Or art thou not Resolve us who thou art  Then JESUS by this solemn adjuration urg'd  Lifting his eyes to heav'n in mute appeal  Whilst all his Father's virtue in his face  Effulgent beam'd these glorious words pronounc'd  Hear them O heav'n and Oh record them earth  Write them ye mortals on your heartsI am  I am the CHRIST all that you ask I am  And ye shall see me coming in the clouds  Of heav'n enthron'd at the right hand of Power  As when on rapine bent a savage horde  Arab or Indian in some sandy dell  Or by the sedgy lake in ambush lodg'd  Upon the watchword by their leader giv'n  Leap from their treach'rous lair with sudden yell  And bloody weapons waving to surprize  And overpower th' unguarded traveller  Fatally trapp'd into their murderous snare  So at the signal of their priestly chief  Uprose the dire divan with rushing sound  Like roar of distant waters Terrorstruck  Frantic as Bromius with furious hands  Th' enthusiastic hierarch seiz'd his robes  And into tatters like a cancell'd scroll  Tore them exclaiming vehement and loud  That all might hearWhat need of further proof  Ye' have heard his blasphemy How think ye sirs  What may such crime deserveTh' infuriate priests  Seiz'd by like phrensy with one voice pronounce  Death be his sentenceDeath through all the hall  Rebounding echoes back th' accurs'd decree  Horrible sentence Murder hatch'd in hell  Libation for the fiends Daemons on you  And on your generations to all time  His righteous blood shall rest Now uproar wild  And horrid din succeeds The scoffing crowd  Rush to the bar so privileg'd and there  With scurril taunts and blasphemies revile  The patient Son of God Oh thought of horror  The Savior of mankind revil'd by man  The Just by th' unjust Others more profane  Vent their vile rheum upon his sacred face  Or smite him with their palms then gibing cry  Tell us who smote thee prophesy thou CHRIST  Monsters that CHRIST hath prophesied your doom  Already by that Prophet is pronounc'd  The lips you strike have utter'd it Behold  Jerusalem is fall'n her towers are dust  Your city smokes in ruin Lo what piles  Of mangled carcases what horrid scenes  Of violated matrons Hark what screams  Of infants butcher'd in their mothers arms  And look your temple blazes to the sky  It's beams of cedar overlaid with gold  It's fretted roof with carvings rich emboss'd  And all it's glorious splendor feeds the flames  Insatiate mark how high their serpent spires  Hissing ascend God fans them in his ire  Thither the wild beasts of the desart hie  There carrion owls by midnight haunt there dwells  The dragon and the satyrs dance 'Tis done  That prophecy is seal'd There yet remains  An awful consummation unreveal'd  Till God shall gather up your scatter'd race  Still vagrant o'er th' inhospitable earth  Ah wretched people broken and dispers'd  Did ye preserve the oracles of God  But to convict your own obduracy  Sad nation on whose neck the iron yoke  Of persecution hard too hard hath lain  And yet lies heavy will ye not accept  A High Priest holy harmless undefil'd  From sinners sep'rate and exalted high  Above the heavens And do ye not perceive  The word of JESUS in yourselves fulfill'd  Rue then the prophecy which you provok'd  Of faithless fathers ye still faithless sons  Whilst shuddering I recount the impious taunts  Of that blaspheming rout But neither taunts  Nor violence could shake the Savior's peace  He in his own pure spi'rit collected stood  Nor of their base revilings took account  'Twas now that CHRIST knowing himself denied  Three times of PETER turn'd and look'd upon him  He from the garden where his Lord was seiz'd  Following at distance JUDAS and his band  Had kept his eye upon their moving fires  And up the sacred mount pursued their track  Till at the palacedoor he stood and sought  Admission with the crowd when there behold  A damsel at the portal scans him o'er  With scrutinizing eye and strait exclaims  Thou too wert in this Galilean's train  Thou art of JESUSSudden to his heart  The coward tremor runs and there suggests  The fearconceived lye before them all  With confidence to falsehood ill applied  I know not what thou say'sthe strait avers  And to the porch goes forth There in his ear  The cock his first shrill warning gives and sings  The knell of constancy's predicted breach  Of constancy alas too strongly vouch'd  By him in rash and overweening zeal  Boasting like martyrdom with CHRIST himself  Sole sacrifice appointed for mankind  But he though of presumption warn'd by fear  Still haunted and the guilty dread of death  Strait to a second questioner replies  I do not know the manand to engage  Belief binds down the falsehood with an oath  Fatal appeal to Heav'n insult to God  And His allrighteous ears Is this the man  Who with such glowing ardor selfassur'd  Though all shall be offended I will not  Proudly averr'd and for that pride reprov'd  Though I should die with thee dauntless rejoin'd  Yet will I not deny thee Man weak man  Pride was not made for thee If PETER fell  Presuming who shall say Behold I stand  In my own strength nor ask support of God  And now as if devoted to his shame  Curious to pry yet fearful to be seen  He mixes with the throng that crowd the hall  And there once more is challeng'd for his speech  As savo'ring of the Galilean phrase  Then with reiterated oaths abjures  His Master the third time when hark again  The cock's loud signal echoes back the lye  In his convicted ear the prophet bird  Strains his recording throat and up to heav'n  Trumpets the trebled perjury and claps  His wings in triumph o'er presumption's fall  Oh fall'n how low is this thy promis'd faith  Favor'd of CHRIST so highly Know'st thou not  Disciple thine own Lord or know'st him only  In safety in prosperity in power  For thine own selfish ends a summer guest  Prone to desert him in the wint'ry hour  Of tribulation poverty and woe  Is thy frail memory of that slippery stuff  That a friend's sorrow washes out all trace  Of a friend's features Look upon his eyes  Behold they turn on thee Them dost thou know  Their language canst thou read and from them draw  The conscious reminiscence thou disown'st  Mark is their sweetness lost Ah no they beam  Celestial grace a sanctity of soul  So melting soft with pity such a gleam  Of love divine attemp'ring mild reproof  Where is the man that to obtain that eye  Of mercy on his sins would not forego  Life's dearest comforts to embrace such hope  O death death where would be thy sting or where  These awful tremblings which thy coming stirs  In my too conscious breast might I aspire  To hope my Judge would greet me with that look  Vaunt not yourselves ye scorners nor exult  In this recital of a good man's fall  Faithful historian of his own offence  But rather let it physic your proud spleen  To mark how mean prevaricating false  And despicable a vainglorious man  PETER's denial David's heinous sin  And all the guilty lapses of man's heart  Though summ'd together into one account  Each spot and blemish malice can search out  To tarnish the fair lustre of a name  Stand but as lessons of humility  Warnings of frailty to o'erweening man  And if our mournful page hath now set forth  The fall of virtue let it next record  It's glorious resurrection We have shewn  The' offender in his shame what now remains  But to display the penitent Behold  Abash'd he stands bath'd in remorseful tears  One glance from his beloved Master's eye  Like Nathan's parable hath rous'd from sleep  His drowsy conscience Mark where he retires  To weep in solitude and purge his heart  By sorrowful repentance of it's guilt  O PETER could my verse fit offering make  That verse should be bestow'd upon thy tears  Now the assembled elders and their chief  After short consultation had resolve  With the next dawn of morning to arraign  Their Prisoner at the praetorian bar  Of PILATE procurator for the state  Imperial of Rome and Caesar he  Held judgment sovereign of life and death  In tributary Jewry judge corrupt  And like Rome's venal emissaries prone  To every sordid purpose train'd in blood  And for tribunal bloody therefore fit  Meanwhile forth issuing from the fatal hall  Scene of his shame the sad Disciple took  His pensive way across the templecourt  Silent and solitary seeking where  To' unbosom his full sorrows and give up  His soul to pray'r and pardon seek of God  For his revolt Pale through night's curtain gleam'd  By fits the lunar intermittent ray  That quiv'ring serv'd to light his lonely steps  To the fair gate call'd Beautiful whose porch  High overarch'd on writhed columns propp'd  Of spiral brass convolv'd was for it's shade  Of CHRIST and his Disciples much in quest  Hither he came and falling on his knees  Like the' humble publican smote on his breast  And this confession selfaccusing made  Here let me fall and in repentant tears  Weep out my soul upon these piti'less stones  Made sacred by His steps whose awful name  Thrice blasphem'd thrice abjur'd I dare not speak  Though in my supplication Can I say  Spare me O God of mercy Can I ask  Pardon of God unpardon'd of myself  Oh wretched recreant creature as I am  What shall redeem me from this misery  And reconcile my conscience to itself  A perjur'd conscience Never more can peace  Dwell in this bosom never can my soul  Ascend out of the dust or lift a thought  In hope tow'rds heav'n With JUDAS let me dwell  Colleague in treason with his sin my sin  In the' execration of all time be link'd  Or shall I venture to look up and say  O God behold a wretch who dares not sue  For mercy but for mitigated wrath  For punishment proportion'd to my bearing  Protracted not too sudden lest it take  My senses from me and with them all power  Of meditation penance and atonement  Spare me a little to abhor myself  And if the arrow which my conscience drives  Into this guilty heart draws not enough  Of it's vile blood to purify what's left  Let the strong hand of justice force it home  And finish me at once Was I not warn'd  Of my presumption and a signal set  To number my denials when I swore  Never to swerve but follow him to death  Mine like ISCARIOT's was predicted sin  I spar'd not him I call'd his wilful guilt  Obstinate malice and can I now urge  Necessity my plea All things are known  To CHRIST the evil motions of my will  He saw not overrul'd I might have pray'd  For grace support prevention I pray'd not  But heedless of the prophecy and blind  Rush'd into sin prepense selfwill'd selflost  What fascination seiz'd me to draw forth  The sword in rash defence of Him whose word  Legions of Angels could have call'd from heav'n  And what prevaricating daemon breath'd  The lye into my lips when the same night  Nay the same hour that saw me prompt to' oppose  My life to danger saw me meanly shrink  From what I courted and behind a lye  Three times repeated like a coward sculk  And did I not know CHRIST whom I denied  Did I not know the Master whom I serv'd  Who call'd me to him pour'd into my heart  His heav'nly doctrines rais'd my lowly thoughts  From the mean drudgery of a fisher's trade  And taught me in the energy of faith  To walk upon that sea in which erewhile  I dragg'd the net and toil'd for daily bread  O memory once my glory now my curse  To what sad purpose do I call thee home  Absent in danger present in despair  Is there a wonder done of CHRIST on earth  I have not witness'd Did I not behold  Dead Lazarus revive at his command  What shall I say to him whom I saw die  When living he arraigns me face to face  What answer make to those whom I have serv'd  From one small wallet with the bread of thousands  The very blind ere they receiv'd their sight  Saw more than I and hail'd him LORD and CHRIST  Who shall believe when I renounce belief  The very dev'ils own Him whom I denied  Can I call these accurst whose impious cry  Dooms him to death who smite him with their palms  Blaspheming Harder than their hands my heart  Wretch 'twas my false tongue train'd them on to murder  On me me only all their sin rebounds  I stand condemn'd they free Can I forget  How oft my lips confess'd him Son of God  Perish that tongue which could revoke it's faith  Disown confession and belie my heart  Denied of me on earth when in the clouds  Of heav'n he comes at the right hand of Pow'r  And sends his Angels with the trumpet's sound  To gather his elect from the four winds  When as a shepherd culling out his flock  To separate all nations and divide  The good from evil he proceeds Ah then  Then will he not retort the fatal words  First us'd of me I know thee not Depart  Thou wicked servant into outer darkness  There weep and gnash thy teeth in fires prepar'd  For SATAN and his outcast crew accurst  Thus he all night with deep remorse o'erwhelm'd  Mournfully kneeling at God's templegate  Bewail'd his crime and supplication made  For pardon and let aftertimes attest  How full a portion of God's spi'rit abode  In this blest Penitent when with the sound  Of rushing mighty winds it was pour'd down  On him and on his fellows thence install'd  Apostles and with gifted tongues inspir'd  To speak all languages and preach the Word  Of CHRIST throughout the whole converted world  Here in this very spot where now he kneels  Repentant fill'd ere long with pow'r divine  He bade the cripple in the name of CHRIST  Rise up and walk He at the word in sight  Of all the people rose and stood and walk'd  And in the temple gave loud praise to God  Then let not his offence pardon'd of God  By man but for example's sake be nam'd  And once more hail thou renovated Saint  Made brighter by repentance Enter thou  Into thy Master's joy once more resume  Thine apostolic primacy and feed  Shepherd of CHRIST deputed feed his flock  Nor shall thy faith once faulter nor thy zeal  Shrink from the test of martyrdom reserv'd  To glorify thy Master on the cross  Now morning from her cloudy barrier forth  Advancing crimson'd all the flecker'd East  As blushing to lead on the guilty day  With the first dawn the wakeful elders meet  Short council hold for little time suffic'd  To take their voices whose relentless minds  In the same bloody league were banded all  And now unanimous with their high priest  In stately grave procession forth they march  To find their heathen judge and at his bar  Arraign the Holy OneBut check my heart  Thine indignation let the verse proceed  Him in his seat of judgment high enthron'd  With axes and with lictors round embay'd  In martial state with reverence they salute  And lowly stoop their tributary heads  To his vicegerent majesty With smile  Of condescending favor he accepts  Their abject greeting and to his right hand  Their chief advances others in their ranks  And orders he disposes then with feign'd  Solicitude as if to seek the cause  Of this concerted meeting he begins  What cause so weighty brings JEHOVAH's priest  With these wise elders and timehonor'd scribes  Thus early to seek justice at my bar  Appeal so reverend with such leader grac'd  And by such followers witness'd well demands  Of Caesar's servant his most equal ear  Whereto the' high priest second to none in craft  With solemn accent and demeanor grave  Masking his base collusion thus replies  When he whose hand the sword of justice sways  Her balance also holds in equal poise  Over this realm provincial we have cause  To thank the master of our liberties  Who by such delegation of his power  Makes light that yoke which else would gall our necks  Though Caesar lays it on us Then let praise  Be giv'n to Caesar for the love we bear  To PONTIUS PILATE Have I leave to say  That we your servants a peculiar race  Pay worship to one God and hold at heart  As sacred that commandment handed down  From our forefathers which for ever makes  His undivided Unity the creed  Of all our nation and whoe'er blasphemes  His name and controverts our holy faith  Dies by our law This sentence we have pass'd  But execution staid so bound in duty  Upon a certain Nazarite by name  JESUS obscure of birth but of our peace  No slight disturber for the common herd  A monster as you know with many heads  And every head with twice as many ears  Itching for novelties have rais'd this man  To dang'rous eminence and for he cheats  Their gross credulity with juggling sleights  Which they call miracles have blown his pride  To such a monstrous bulk he now scales heaven  There seats himselfOh where shall I find words  To speak his blasphemyat God's right hand  His Son his equal sharer of his throne  Judge of the world if this be not a crime  For death to expiate we are slaves indeed  And every statute ordinance and law  Rome leaves inviolate JESUS shall break  Unpunish'd Nor is this dread sir the whole  Of his presumption mark I pray the heighth  To which his phrensy rages mark his threat  He will put down this temple in three days  And in like time with hands invisible  Erect anotherPatron of our laws  Fountain of justice ought this man to live  Such madness breath'd into our peoples minds  Will spur them to the deed break every band  That ties them down to order and turn loose  Their fury not on us alone but Rome  Not on our temple only but perhaps  On this tribunal which Heav'n guard And now  Take the whole matter of our charge at once  This JESUS hath pronounc'd himself a king  Our king your master's rival You best know  If your great empe'ror abdicates his right  To our allegiance which we fain would hold  Where we have vow'd it to imperial Caesar  Not to this mean mechanic Joseph's son  This is our plea O PONTIUS why we claim  Justice against the pris'ner who now waits  Your sentence under guard and bound as fits  Delinquent so atrocious I have said  To him the RomanBe it known to all  The sentence which you urge against the life  Of your now absent pris'ner cannot pass  By practice of our law till face to face  With his accusers he shall stand at bar  And licence have to answer for himself  Touching the crime in charge therefore these words  Which you have largely spent are spent in air  Else might the ear of justice be forestall'd  By the empleader's charge and so perchance  Let fall the axe upon the guiltless head  Much knowledge of your laws I cannot boast  Nor with these learned scribes hold argument  For so much therefore as to them pertains  I on the part of Caesar am no judge  His tributes his supremacy and rights  Disputed or oppos'd I shall uphold  'Gainst all offenders Let th' accus'd appear  This said behold the blessed Son of God  Dragg'd to a pagan bar There whilst he stood  A spectacle of pity patient meek  Submitted to his fate PILATE who knew  Him innocent and his accusers false  Envious and cruel ey'd him o'er and o'er  And as he ponder'd in his mind how base  The sentence he was now requir'd to give  Some sparks of Roman virtue not quite dead  Though faintly felt in his degene'rate breast  Revolted from the deed Soft was the touch  Though ineffectual which sweet pity gave  To his stern heart He wish'd yet knew not how  To' unfold the gates of mercy and through them  Let pass the rescued Innocent to life  The son of Epicurus could no more  Upon the Sufferer's brow serene he saw  Where innocence and sanctity enthron'd  Sate visible and claim'd his just award  He turn'd him to th' accusers and beheld  Such malice as brought up to view a groupe  Of his own furies from their fabled hell  Then with a frown he criesWhat law is your's  Which makes this man a culprit ere he's tried  Unmanacle his limbs A Roman judge  Hears no man plead in shackles he who speaks  In life's defence hath call for every aid  That Nature can bestow free use of limbs  Action and utterance to grace his cause  And hold him up against the world's contempt  I will not hear a man that pleads in bonds  Cut those vile cords asunder Set him loose  And now our blessed Lord his arms releas'd  From the harsh thongs which the malignant Jews  Had bound about them 'gan to recompose  His decent vesture and with calm survey  To note his persecutors those dire priests  And cruel hypocrites that bay'd him round  In every breast transparent to his eye  Malice and craft and envy he discern'd  In PILATE's face the shifting hues bespoke  Internal strife of passions all in arms  Combat 'twixt good and evil In his hand  He held a scroll which with intentive eye  And thoughtful brow deep pondering he perus'd  The writing well he knew but the contents  Thus worded much perplex'd his wav'ring thoughts  "O Pilate if thy wife was ever held  "In honor love or trust I do adjure thee  "This once take warning from her voice inspir'd  "To snatch thee from destruction Oh withhold  "Thine hand from that just person harm not him  "That holy JESUS who now stands before thee  "Touch not his sacred life or on thine head  "A fearful judgment thou shalt else pull down  "A mighty Pow'r protects him what I know not  "But mightier sure than all the Gods of Rome  "For I have seen his glory in a dream  "And dreams descend from heav'n Pilate beware"  Such was the warning scroll he now perus'd  Ev'n on the judgment seat by timely hand  Sent for his rescue Happy had he turn'd  His heart so warn'd to justice and obey'd  The visitation of the spi'rit vouchsaf'd  But he like Caesar deem'd his manhood pledg'd  To make slight 'count of a weak woman's dream  Yet much confus'd uncertain and perplex'd  He look'd around and saw all eyes upon him  The Jews impatient JESUS at the bar  Prepar'd for trial What shall he resolve  Break up the court and judgment put aside  For a mere vapor for no better plea  Than to indulge a woman's fond caprice  And bid the law stand still and wait the time  " Till PILATE's wife shall meet with better dreams"  Such scorn he dar'd not to provoke and now  Loud murmurs fill'd his ear Compell'd to rise  Though uncollected and in mind disturb'd  He thus address'd the LORDArt thou a king  And of this nation who accuse thee to me  King of the JewsThou say'st it JESUS cried  But say'st thou of thyself this thing or taught  Of others art thou prompted so to speak  Am I a Jew the fault'ring judge replied  Not I but these who if thou wert a king  Were thine own subjects elders priests and scribes  These have accus'd thee Not of them am I  Nor in this business covet further share  Than on the part of justice to demand  What hast thou done How answer'st thou their charge  Of this world were my kingdom said our LORD  My servants would defend their King and fight  To save me from my' oppressors But I reign  Not on this earth nor is my pow'r from hence  Art thou a king theninterpos'd the judge  Thou say'st cried JESUS that I am a king  And truly to this purpose was I born  And for this cause came I into the world  That I should witness bear unto the Truth  And all that to the Truth belong hear me  What is the Truth said PILATE but his voice  Now falter'd and his thoughts unsettled wild  And driv'n at random like a wreck could grasp  No helm of reason only this he knew  There was no fault before him This aloud  To all he publish'd and pronounc'd him clear  Whereat with rage and disappointment stung  Furious as wolves defrauded of their prey  Uprose the priests appellant and afresh  Urge o'er and o'er their aggravating charge  Forging new falsehoods and reforging old  The Preacher of forbearance peace and love  Perverter of the nation now they call  Fomenter of sedition spreading wide  From Galilee the cradle of his birth  Throughout all Jewry to the capital  Where now assuming to himself the name  Prerogative and state of King and CHRIST  He stirreth up the people to revolt  Forbidding them to pay their rightful dues  Of tribute to Rome's emperor himself  Exalting above Caesar This and more  In the like strain of virulence with lips  In aspic venom steep'd they now depose  Nor had they brought their malice to a pause  When PILATE hoping he had now found plea  To shift the dreaded sentence from himself  Thus interposing check'd their clam'rous spleen  Break off and let your tongues take rest awhile  It is not at this bar you must emplead  This man a Galilean as it seems  Whom being such it is not mine to hear  But HEROD's Let his special tetrarch judge  'Twixt him and you Thither remit your suit  This said he rose preventing all reply  Whilst they though by procrastination gall'd  Yet of their tetrarch confident submit  But nor with HEROD could their malice speed  To it's main purpose Little care had he  For all their priestly clamor in his thoughts  Religion had no interest truth no weight  For prophets and for prophecies no ear  Had he alike regardless how CHRIST preach'd  Or they complain'd yet much he wish'd to see  Some splendid miracle of him perform'd  Something to strike his senses with surprize  And satisfy a wanton curiosity  Made eager by the fame of those great works  Whereof he much had heard and nothing seen  But when our LORD to all his questions mute  Nor word nor sign vouchsaf'd to wrath impell'd  What by enticements he had fail'd to gain  By taunts he hop'd to' extort and now his spleen  To impious scorn and mockery gave the rein  Forthwith his Pris'ner in a gorgeous robe  Apparel'd as a king to all his court  Held up for sport and laughter he expos'd  Loud was the roar of blasphemy the whilst  And wild the revels of the scoffing throng  As the lewd orgies of the frantic god  Or clamor of that sacrilegious rout  When their mad rage the Thracian minstrel tore  Whose wonderworking harp could charm the ear  Of hell and call dead nature into life  The priests look'd on and grinn'd malicious joy  Yet would not HEROD execution doom  Or willing to appease the jealousy  Of PILATE or content to mark his scorn  Of JESUS by this arrogant display  Of mercy as not dreading whom he spar'd  Now once again at PILATE's bar he stands  Not as before like malefactor tied  And round begirt with cords but overlaid  With a rich load of sumptuous mockery  A lamb compell'd to carry the proud spoils  And guilty trappings of the ty'rannous wolf  Again the judge with slow unwilling step  To his tribunal mounts and thus he speaks  You still persist to bring this man to me  As a perverter of your nation's faith  And loyalty Your witnesses I've heard  Ponder'd their depositions and throughout  Examin'd ev'ry tittle of your charge  Him too I've question'd in the ears of all  Here present and no shadow of offence  Can I discern to warrant your appeal  For execution and pass judgment on him  No nor yet HEROD for to him I sent  You and your pris'ner and behold him freed  Nothing is done unto him worthy death  I will chastise him therefore and release  Yet this chastisement rather to allay  Your anger than so merited of him  I shall inflict Remember this your feast  Hath the long plea of custom to be mark'd  With pardon and forbearance To reprieve  One culprit from his sentence I am bound  No less by inclination than by rule  And usage immemorial Make your choice  But let it fall on innocence not guilt  Instant all voices echo'd forth a cry  Hence with this man away with him to death  Give us the murd'rer set Barabbas free  Let JESUS perishWherefore for what crime  PILATE exclaim'd What evil hath he done  No cause of death in JESUS can I find  Be witness for me justice none in him  But for that wretch on whom ye would bestow  Pardon misplac'd so various are his crimes  So black their quality ye cannot name  A death more terrible than he deserves  Take of the guiltless blood what stripes can draw  To satisfy your longing but forbear  To take the life if not for pity's sake  In honor of yourselves that ye may say  There was one prophet whom ye did not kill  Loud as the winds that lash the raging seas  And all as deaf redoubling now the roar  Th' infuriate Jews rend their blaspheming throats  Howling for blood 'till deafen'd with the din  Of Crucify him crucify him dreadful cry  PILATE who 'twixt their tumult and the death  Of that just Person saw no middle course  By which t' escape one solemn act prepar'd  By expiatory washing of his hands  In presence of the multitude to purge  His soul and thereof God alone is judge  From the pure blood of that devoted Lamb  Behold he cries I pour this water forth  And therein make ablution of my soul  From all participation in your crime  By washing of my hands from every stain  Of this inhuman sacrifice each spot  And sprinkling of this guiltless Victim's blood  Rest on your heads the murder I am clean  This said he turn'd and fix'd a pitying look  Upon the LORD then sigh'd and gave the word  Eager as hounds when slipp'd upon their prey  In rush the throng and soon the hissing scourge  Whirl'd with impetuous swing aloud resounds  Gashing that sacred flesh whose bleeding stripes  Heal'd our sinwounded souls upon his brow  A thorny crown they fix whose tortu'ring spikes  Thrust rudely in by sacrilegious hands  Furrow his temples and with crimson streams  Cover his face divine Him thus abus'd  Mangled with stripes and all o'er bath'd in blood  In purple robe they scornfully array  And drag to public viewBehold the man  PILATE proclaim'd with horror in his voice  And outstretch'd arm that pointed to a sight  Which had to pity mov'd their steely hearts  Had they not been of metal forg'd by fiends  And temper'd in the sternest fires of hell  Dryey'd as rock of adamant unmov'd  Obdurate to his sorrows they look'd on  Nor from their crucifying clamor ceas'd  Till PILATE now all hope for JESUS lost  Yielding to their tumultuous fury cried  Take him and do your bloody work yourselves  Impose it not on me I find no cause  Of death no fault in JESUS Take ye him  And crucify him Of his guiltless blood  Lo I am innocent see ye to that  On us and on our children be his blood  Then answer'd all the Jews Tremendous words  Tremendously fulfill'd And now afresh  They clamor for the cross when thus the judge  Would you that I should crucify your king  We have no king but Caesar they rejoin  Nor art thou Caesar's friend to spare this man  'Twas past to that dread name the Roman bow'd  Obedient and from his sad heart sigh'd forth  Th' extorted doomDeath to the LORD OF LIFE  END OF THE FIFTH BOOK  CALVARY OR  THE DEATH OF CHRIST  BOOK VI  THE ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK  Judas Iscariot seized with remorse returns the thirty pieces of silver to the priests and departs Mammon reassumes the habit of a Levite and meeting Judas after he had returned the money to the priests instigates him to destroy himself That evil spirit now takes wing and repairs to the wilderness convenes the daemons from all parts of Palestine and informing them of Satan's expulsion from earth warns them by his command to betake themselves to flight before the hour of Christ's crucifixion This is no sooner announced than the whole infernal host breaks up in disorder and disperses to various parts of the world therein describedThe subject of the Crucifixion is now brought forward The procession sets out for Mount Calvary Christ bearing his cross is bewailed by the spectators as he passes He is seen by Gabriel and the angels with him from the mount on which they were stationed He addresses himself to the daughters of Jerusalem The executioners nail his hands and feet to the cross the priests revile him and call upon him to come down one of the malefactors crucified with him casts the same in his teeth he is reproved by the other whose penitence is rewarded by the promise of immediate salvation and glory Christ from the cross recommends his mother to John the beloved disciple Christ dies The sun is darkened the earth quakes the rocks are rent and the bodies of the saints and prophets are raised from the dead and appear upon earth The priests and elders alarmed by these prodigies resort to Pilate and demand a guard of Romans to defend the sepulchre lest the disciples should take away the body of Christ and pretend that he was risen Pilate replies that they have a watch bids them see to it themselves and dismisses them  CALVARY  BOOK VI THE CRUCIFIXION  "ON us and on our children be his blood"  Such was your imprecation O ye Jews  When in your sight the world's Redeemer stood  Gash'd o'er with wounds and emptying ev'ry vein  For man's redemption and behold it flows  It whelms upon you in a floodgate tide  Steep'd to the lips ye are in all the blood  Of all the righteous shed upon the earth  From blood of righteous Abel to the blood  Of Zechariah whom your fathers ston'd  Betwixt the altar and the house of God  Ye have enough the mark is on your race  Ye have drawn down the judgment ye provok'd  It rests upon you Yet for you no rest  No station no abidingplace is found  Strangers and weary wand'rers upon earth  If in the dust of your Jerusalem  With foot proscrib'd ye dare to tread ye die  A savage race usurps your sacred mount  And Jordan echoes an unhallow'd name  Should ye but stop to shed a filial tear  Upon the soil where your forefathers sleep  Woe to the circumcis'd that so is found  Oh slow of heart when will ye understand  That thus afflicted scatter'd and dispers'd  Through every clime and kingdom of the world  Ye are sent forth to publish as ye pass  How truly CHRIST predicted of your fate  And though your lips deny your sufferings prove  That prophet JESUS whom your fathers slew  Was Savior Christ Messias Son of God  Amidst the throng that fill'd the judgmenthall  Stood JUDAS he upon the watch to' avoid  The Master's eye with caution took his post  Yet was his ear to all that JESUS spake  Still present and though few the words yet strong  And potent of those few the' impressive truth  There was a magic sweetness in his voice  A note that seem'd to shiver every nerve  Entwin'd about his heart though now corrupt  Debas'd and harden'd Ill could he abide  Murderer although he were the dying tones  Of him whom he had murder'd 'Twas the voice  As of a spirit in the air by night  Heard in the meditation of some crime  Or sleepcreated in the troubled ear  Of conscience crying out Beware It smote  Upon the soul for it was CHRIST who spake  Well then might JUDAS tremble 'twas the traitor  Listning the plea of innocence betray'd  Well might that plea awaken his remorse  When the perverting witnesses depos'd  To crimes of which he knew his Master free  The refutation quiver'd on his lips  And hard he struggled to bring forth the words  Yet could not tonguety'd with despair and shame  But if his hearing so alarm'd his heart  What were his feelings when at times his eye  Glanc'd on the sacred person of his Lord  Bound like a felon his defenceless hands  In manacles confin'd behind his back  His cheeks with blows sufflated and his face  Oh piteous with blaspheming slaver stain'd  Then stripp'd transform'd in purple stole array'd  Saluted with the insolent Allhail  King of the Jews a spectacle of sport  And merriment to all the scoffing crowd  Could heart of man bear this who had beheld  His miracles his mercies prov'd his love  His patience his forbearance shar'd his cares  His labors and his watchings heard his voice  When tempesttost rebuke the elements  Though silent now amidst the roar of tongues  'Twas all that priestly malice could inflict  But more than MAMMON's convert could support  Yet worse had these tormentors in reserve  To agonize his soul another scene  To shift new horrors on that bloody stage  The torturing scourge now sounded in his ears  The mangled flesh flew off in tatter'd stripes  The crimson stream ran down the pavement drank  Libation of his immolated blood  The hall rebellow'd with the echoing cry  Of monsters who applauded every stroke  Wolves vultures Oh for words to speak them worse  Men turn'd to daemons Traitor though he were  Son of perdition this was all too much  Take hence he cried take back your bribe accurst  Damn'd price of damning deed Tell o'er your coin  Count out your thirty pieces for each piece  Is thirty thousand daggers to my heart  Burthen'd too much already with my sins  I should but into worse damnation sink  Under this mercenary load opprest  I have betray'd the innocent too late  For pardon I am past redemption lost  Ye may redeem the time if ye recall  Your fatal condemnation and atone  To that just person ye have doom'd to death  If not ye crucify the Lord of Life  This said he threw the thirty pieces down  And strait departed they to his retort  Short answer made remorseless and malign  And now disburthen'd of his filthy bribe  It seem'd as though his conscience would permit  A momentary pause for one short gleam  Of hope to visit his benighted soul  'Twas something like atonement 'twas one step  Turn'd backward from the precipice of sin  And pointed tow'rds repentance 'twas the last  Faint effort that reluctant nature made  To struggle 'gainst selfmurder but how vain  For MAMMON once the tyrant of man's heart  Ill brooks expulsion thence from youth to age  From age to life's extremest hour he holds  Absolute empire nor does hell contain  Spirit so jealous of usurp'd command  He in the bosoms of those impious priests  Held high preeminence and them amidst  Himself unseen had noted all that pass'd  And much indignant to be now abjur'd  Of that compunctious traitor swift as thought  Such was his power of motion took the form  And habit of that Levite first assum'd  And him close following to the outward hall  There with these taunting words assail'd his ear  A losing game friend JUDAS thou hast play'd  To set thy soul upon a desperate cast  And after pay the stake on either side  What folly is it to be knave by halves  Who would strike virtue in the face and then  Ask pardon for the blow fall off from truth  Enlist with falsehood and take pay for treason  Then by a paltry plea of restitution  Think to compound one trespass by another  Desertion by desertion Get thee hence  Thou shame to manhood wring out the sad dregs  Of thy detested life in hopeless tears  For thou hast thrown away both worlds at once  All gain in this all glory in the next  And what art thou cried JUDAS so to gall  A wounded spirit wounded by thy arts  Tempter accurst Human thou canst not be  Else thou wouldst find some pity in thy heart  For wretch like me Who but thyself seduc'd  My loyalty from CHRIST Who sapp'd my faith  Who fix'd this adder to my breast but thou  Thou daemon as thou art hast hurl'd me down  From my high hope to fathomless abyss  Of misery and despair from heav'n to hell  Rail not on me quoth MAMMON but thyself  And thine own folly there the charge were just  Didst thou not sell thy Master for a bribe  My part was faithfully perform'd the price  Condition'd for was paid What wouldst thou more  I needed treason and I sought out thee  As fittest for my purpose Envious proud  Lustful of pelf a villain readymade  And ripe for mischief such I mark'd thee down  Nay and yet better for I thought thee whole  And perfect villain with no rotten part  Of penitence to mar thee but behold  Thou hast deceiv'd me vilely and hast got  A blinking vice about thee a perverse  And retrograde depravity of soul  That makes thee hateful to my sight Begone  That thou art wicked put not me to blame  Hadst thou been constant I had made thee rich  And riches would have sav'd thee from contempt  Now thou art poor and loathsome Hence avaunt  One remedy I'll give thee for despair  This cord a remnant of thy Master's bonds  A legacy most opportunely left  To heal thy cares and recompence thy love  Take and apply it to it's proper use  It tied his limbs Let it encase thy throat  He said and stooping from the pavement took  The cord there left and hurling it with scorn  To the desponding traitor disappear'd  Nor did that wretch the fatal gift reject  But eager seiz'd the instrument of death  And soon within a darksome vault beneath  The judgmenthall fit solitude he found  And beam appropriate to his desperate use  Whereto appendent he breath'd out his soul  Not daring to put up one prayer for peace  At his dark journey's end but trembling wild  Confus'd of reason as of hope bereft  With heaving breast and ghastly staring eyes  There betwixt heav'n and earth of both renounc'd  Hung terrible to sight a bloated corpse  Oh how shall rash and ignorant man presume  To judge for God and on his narrow scale  Think to mete out by limits and degrees  Immeasurable mercy Who can tell  How high the sorrows of man's suffering heart  Ascend tow'rds heav'n how swift contrition flies  What words find passage to the throne of grace  What in midway are lost dispers'd in air  And scatter'd to the winds Oh that my harp  Could sound that happy note which stirs the string  Responsive that kind Nature hath entwin'd  About the human heart and by whose clue  Repentance heav'nly monitress reclaims  The youthful wanderer from his dang'rous maze  To tread her peaceful paths and seek his God  So could my fervent my effectual verse  Avail posterity should then engrave  That verse upon my tomb to tell the world  I did not live in vain But heedless man  Deaf to the music of the moral song  By Mammon or by Belial led from sin  To sin runs onward in his mad career  Nor once takes warning of his better guide  Till at the barrier of life's little span  Arriv'd he stops Death opens to his view  A hideous gulph in vain he looks around  For the lost seraph Hope beside him stands  The tyrant fiend and urges to the brink  Behind him black despair with threat'ning frown  And gorgon shield whose interposed orb  Bars all retreat and with it's shade involves  Life's brighter prospects in one hideous night  So JUDAS fell so like him every wretch  By the same filthy Mammon lur'd shall fall  Meanwhile the vengeful daemon unappeas'd  Pond'ring the warning of his Stygian Lord  Late driv'n from earth and mindful that the charge  And conduct of hell's host on him devolv'd  Now claim'd his wariest thought upon the wing  Sets forth full sail to summon his compeers  As many' as in that quarter might be found  And them apprize of their foul loss incurr'd  By their great captain's fall and what dispatch  Behoves them now put forth timely to 'scape  Impending danger of their chief foreseen  If CHRIST's deathhour should unawares surprize  Them idly station'd or with curious gaze  Hovering about his cross So forth he goes  But first to spy the land he wheels his flight  Athwart Mount Calvary and there on guard  A file of heav'nly warriors he descries  Covering the sacred hill and at their head  GABRIEL in golden panoply array'd  Arm'd at all points commander of the band  The fate of SATAN and the recent sight  Of CHEMOS' ghastly wound with guilty fears  Haunting his coward fancy warn'd him fly  Beyond the range of that strong spear from which  Spirit more warlike than himself had fled  As when a pirate galley on the scout  Roving the seas of some strongguarded coast  In bay or inlet moor'd under the lea  Of headland promontory' at anchor spies  A warlike fleet whose tow'ring masts and sails  Unbent for sea bespeak their ready trim  Down goes the helm at once the felon crew  Bestir all hands and veer the vessel round  To seaward then ply oars and sails for life  So at the sight of that angelic band  The Stygian scout wheel'd round and sped his flight  Sheer to the wilderness on swiftest wing  There on the watch AZAZEL haply found  He bade sound forth the loud Satanic trump  Heard through all Palestine at call whereof  Spi'rits to whatever element affix'd  In troops swiftposting on the charmed winds  Came from all parts from Sidon and from Tyre  New ris'n amidst the waves from Gaza's coast  Meridian limit to the snowcapt mounts  Hermon and Libanus and them beyond  From Epidaphne on Orontes' stream  Fam'd for it's grove prophetic from the banks  Of Pharphar and Abana Rimmon's haunts  From Byblus where Astarte's wanton train  Howl for the death of Thammuz yearly lost  And found as oft by the lovefrantic dames  These on the desart heath alighting stand  Obedient to the signal all around  Expectant of their archangelic chief  They cast an anxious look but look in vain  Him in far other region they shall find  In chains fast bound amidst eternal fires  His dismal dwelling for them also' reserv'd  In God's appointed time To whom the fiend  I muse not warriors that ye stand amaz'd  To see yourselves in absence of our chief  Here summon'd by his archangelic trump  Which other breath than his before ne'er fill'd  But public danger urges this bold step  In me presumptuous had I not to plead  Your safety for my warrant and withal  His last sad mandate earnestly bequeath'd  At parting when sole witness I beheld  His utter loss discomfiture and flight  Ah friends how sympathetic with my soul  Is that deep general groan which now I hear  Full cause immortal mourners have we all  To groan and beat our breasts nor I the least  Whose melancholy task it is to pour  These heavy tidings in your grieved ears  But let us yet remember what we are  And be not therefore heartless though bereft  Of him who was the head and brain of all  Many and mighty are the chiefs yet left  Though he prime chief no longer shall review  This widow'd host Of SATAN the return  Is desp'rate such a whirlwind caught him up  So strong a southern blast at CHRIST's command  Blew him beyond the stretch of angel ken  Right onward to the realm of antient Night  Impetuous through the empyrean void  Sheer on the level wing Of him the fate  Is worse than doubtful of his Victor's power  And Godhead irresistible what proof  Greater than this sad downfall can we need  Or after such example what provoke  Behoves us now prepare for instant flight  This our late chief prophetic in his fall  With his last words enjoin'd me to propound  To these our legions scatter'd o'er the coasts  Of Palestine whom else the coming hour  Of CHRIST's mysterious passion shall involve  In like disgrace and ruin with your prince  Who to his latest moment upon earth  Was studious of your safety I have now  In words unworthy of my charge yet such  As heart o'erwhelm'd with sorrow can supply  Surrender'd to your ears my painful trust  But whither to repair whom to elect  As captain and conductor of this host  Now headless conscious that such high command  With none but with the worthiest should be lodg'd  I as becomes me to your wiser thoughts  Submit and with the general choice shall close  No more for now with sudden panic seiz'd  The Stygian host no voice imperial heard  Nor rule nor order kept uprose at once  Disbanded lawless dreadful was the yell  Of that infernal rout a swarm as thick  As locusts making horrid night beneath  Their wings that with like clangor beat the air  As of a flock of cormorants disturb'd  From some lone island on the rocky coast  Of Chili where they haunt so they with cry  More hideous mount there hover for a while  Then to all points disperse as chance falls out  Or short consult prescribes Some to the South  With Isis and Osiris at their head  To Memphis Thin and Tamis take their flight  There with the bestial deities to herd  Birds serpents reptiles monsters of the Nile  Gods that would half unfurnish Noah's ark  Some with Melcartus demigod of Tyre  Light short and in his temple refuge take  Where arm'd with massy club and lion hide  His huge athletic idol frowning stands  Others with Rimmon eastward wing their way  To fam'd Damascus there in bow'ring shades  By rilling fountains on the flowery turf  To doze away the soft oblivious hours  A slumb'ring synod Some the golden spires  Of Nineveh attract and Nisroc's fane  Stain'd with Sennacherib's imperial blood  There by the parricidal princes shed  To Byblus and Belitus others speed  Light feathery wantons by Astarte led  With loose loveditties and soft smiles lur'd on  To page her pride and deck her amorous sports  But of the rest far greater part repair  To high Olympus where presides the power  Of thundering Baäl he that station keeps  Preeminent o'er all the idol gods  And in his festive hall rich nectar quaffs  With purple lips and midnight revels holds  Luxurious sensual lewd in vice immers'd  Yet some there were and of no vulgar note  Who grief to tell to the biforked mount  Flew off and there with the Parnassian maids  Held shameful dalliance from whose lewd embrace  Descended a whole family of bards  Corruptive illegitimate and base  A spurious breed of wickedness and wit  A Muse's genius with a Daemon's heart  MAMMON meanwhile a solitary sprite  Selfish morose and ev'n by dev'ils abhorr'd  Hied him alone on sordid thoughts intent  To rummage in Pactolus' sands for gold  None join'd nor sought he partner in his flight  His sole ambition to engross and hoard  Now came the awful consummation on  The hour of promise dimly shadow'd out  By types and prophecies when from the womb  Of mystery long travailing in pains  And groanings now in ripe time should spring forth  Her full form'd revelation to dispel  Th' Obscure of antient days and usher in  Twin birth of Immortality and Life  Now God by the' off'ring of his only Son  The type of Abraham's sacrifice fulfill'd  Who though unconscious of that type by faith  Righteous was of the promises made heir  And now as Moses in the wilderness  Lifted the serpent so the Son of man  Exalted on the cross shall heal the world  Of sin and expiate the widewasting plague  Now the peaceoffering of the spotless Lamb  By one conclusive Passover shall rend  The law's symbolic veil and all absolve  Whose consciences are sprinkled with his blood  From punishment entail'd upon the world  By man's first disobedience Forth He comes  From condemnation Ye too from your tombs  Come forth ye prophetsSon of Amoz thou  Prepare for resurrection Come and see  Not darkly' as in a glass but face to face  The object of thy vision Him the man  Of sorrows Him who like a lamb is brought  To slaughter Mark the travail of his soul  Witness how he is stricken for our sins  Witness how we are healed by his stripes  And by the note and comment of his death  Construe thine own predictions Forth he comes  From condemnation under Roman guard  Bearing his cross Upon his bleeding brow  Ensign alike of royalty and woe  A thorny crown no friendly hand is found  To wipe away the tear mingled with blood  That hangs upon his cheek The soldiers cry  Room for the criminal and rest their pikes  To keep the crowd aloof staggering beneath  The ponderous burthen of his cross he faints  And sinks to earth o'erspent till one is found  A sturdy stranger of Cyrenean birth  On whom to lay the venerable load  Hail SIMON blessed above men wert thou  If faith in Him that suffer'd on that cross  Glow'd in thy heart and furnish'd thee with zeal  To render this last service to thy Lord  Without the city walls there was a mount  Call'd CALVARY The common grave it was  Of malefactors there to plant his cross  It was decreed Long was the way to death  And like th' ascent to glory hard to climb  Upon the summit stood the Angel troop  Of MAMMON seen though to man's filmed eye  Invisible Here GABRIEL from the heighth  Noting the sad procession had espied  The suffering Son of God amidst the throng  Dragg'd slowly on by rude and ruffian hands  To shameful execution Horrorstruck  Pierc'd to the heart th' indignant Seraph shook  His threat'ning spear and with the other hand  Smote on his thigh in agony of soul  For man's ingratitude glist'ning with tears  His eyes whence late celestial sweetness beam'd  Now shot a fiery glance on them below  Then raising them to heav'n he thus exclaim'd  Oh that the Everlasting would permit  His Angels to chastise these impious men  And from their hands his holy Son redeem  Whom in the heav'n of heav'ns we have beheld  Beloved of the Father ever blest  At the right hand of Pow'r in glory thron'd  But this for purposes beyond our reach  God ever wise forbids and who against  God's interdict shall stir Therefore retire  Stand off and wait the time If CHRIST commands  We are his ministers to do his will  Be it to lift this mountain from it's base  And whelm it on his murderers if not  Patient spectators we must here abide  And let the sacrilegious work proceed  Knowing that God hath said I will revenge  Vengeance belongeth to the Lord alone  Now on the news of their great Prophet's fate  Each heart with fearfulness and trembling seiz'd  Through all Jerusalem the tumult ran  Native or stranger aged or infirm  None in the Holy City now kept house  Where'er the Savior pass'd his presence drew  Thousands to gaze and many' an aching heart  Heav'd silent the last tributary sigh  In memory of his mercies zealous some  Rush'd in the grateful blessing to bestow  For health or limbs or life itself restor'd  But these the soldiers rudely thrust aside  And some with brutal violence they smote  Thick'ning their files to hem their Pris'ner close  As fearful of a rescue Loud the cry  Of women whose soft sex to pity prone  Melts at those scenes which flintyhearted man  Dryey'd contemplates Mothers in their arms  Held up their infants and with shrill acclaim  Begg'd a last blessing for those innocents  Whose sweet simplicity so well he lov'd  And ever as he met them laid his hands  Upon their harmless heads with gentle love  And gracious benediction breathing heav'n  Into their hearts Oh happy babes so blest  Fenc'd in with shields and spears and compass'd round  With Roman guards the persecuting priests  Elders and scribes follow'd their Victim's steps  Amidst the scoffs and hissings of the crowd  And still as CHRIST approach'd the fatal spot  Loud and more loud the sad lamentings grew  Till at the foot of the funereal mount  Arriv'd he stopt and turning to the group  Of mourners these prophetic words address'd  Daughters of Solyma weep not for me  Weep rather for yourselves and for your babes  For lo the dawn of sorrows is at hand  The dread prediction presses to the birth  When through Jerusalem a voice shall cry  Give thanks ye childless matrons and confess  A barren bed your worst misfortune deem'd  Now your best blessing Break forth into joy  Ye at whose breasts no infant ever hung  For ye have none to mourn Now to the clefts  And caverns of the mountains they shall say  Fall on us cover us ye rocky vaults  And hide us from this wrath For if with us  Already it begins what shall the end  Of the ungodly and the sinner be  If the green tree cannot abide the storm  How shall the dry escapeAnd now no more  Upon the summit of Mount CALVARY  They rear his cross conspicuous there it stands  An ensign of salvation to the world  Kneel all ye Christian nations bow your hearts  And worship your Redeemer in whose death  Ye live and from whose issuing wounds flows life  By his blood purchas'd hope's best promise flows  Of joys immortal for the just reserv'd  The soldiers now by their centurion form'd  In hollow orb around the cross begin  Their horrid prelude to the murd'rous scene  And first his vesture their accustom'd spoil  And perquisite they part but for his coat  From top to bottom woven without seam  That they rend not but on it cast their lots  Whose it shall be entire Upon his cross  In Hebrew Greek and Latin they inscribe  So PILATE will'd though by the priests oppos'd  "JESUS OF NAZARETH KING OF THE JEWS"  This title in three several tongues display'd  Read all those crucifiers of their King  And murmur'd as they read hard to the last  Obdurate unbelieving Now began  The executioners to spread his arms  Upon the beam transverse and through his palms  Monsters of cruelty and through his feet  They drove their spiked nails whilst at the clang  Of those dire engines every feeling heart  Utter'd a groan that with the mingled shrieks  Of mothers and of children pierc'd the air  The priests and elders gnash'd their teeth for rage  And rancorous spite to hear him so bewail'd  Women dropt down convuls'd and on the spot  Let fall their burthens immature for birth  Words fail to paint the horrors of that scene  The very soldiers paus'd and stood aghast  Musing what these lamentings might portend  Scarce dar'd they to pursue the dreadful work  Awestruck and gazing on the face divine  Of the suspended Savior He though stretch'd  Upon the rack of agony to heav'n  Raising his eyesFather of mercy cried  Forgive them for they know not what they do  O ruthless murderers could ye hear these words  And yet persist Blasphemers can ye read  And not adore The people stand at gaze  The rulers eager to provoke anew  Their quailing resolution with one voice  Cry out amainAh thou that on the cross  Now hangest thou that boastedst to destroy  Our temple and rebuild it in three days  Where art thou If thou be the very CHRIST  The King of Israel now come down descend  And save thyself this seeing we will then  Confess thee and believe But 'tis in vain  He hears not he replies not he expires  Others he sav'd himself he cannot save  Peace peace revilers nor expect reply  Think not that CHRIST thus dying for mankind  Will from his great commission turn aside  And stop the sacrifice and quit the cross  On which his body offer'd up for sin  As on an altar lies Your taunts he hears  Yet will he not descend call'd down by you  Nor at the door of death shrink back and leave  Short of perfection his allglorious work  But wait the time and greater sign than this  Ye shall behold when rising from the dead  And incorruptible he shall return  On earth triumphant o'er the cross and death  Yet such is the perverseness of your hearts  Him nor descending would ye now believe  Nor reascending will ye then confess  And now behold on either side the cross  Of CHRIST a wretched malefactor hung  Groaning and writhing in the pangs of death  When one of these encourag'd by the taunts  Of the reviling priests scornful exclaims  Hear'st thou not what they say If thou be CHRIST  Why art thou in this torture Save thyself  And us thy fellows from this cross redeem  This when his penitent companion heard  New horrors smote his heart his fault'ring voice  He rais'd and thus the blasphemy rebuk'd  Hast thou no fear of God expiring wretch  Stretch'd as thou art upon the tree of death  Hast thou no terror for the wrath to come  And truly we the merited reward  Of our ill deeds receive but this just Man  What hath he done In him no fault is found  This said the penitent with faith inspir'd  Upon the Savior turn'd his dying eyes  AndLord he cried with supplicating voice  When to thy heav'nly kingdom thou shalt come  Oh then remember meTo him the LORD  I tell thee of a truth this very day  Thou shalt be found in Paradise with me  Oh words of joy that breathe into the ear  Of the expiring penitent the pledge  Of pardon and acceptance Words that waft  The soul yet hovering on the lips of faith  Into the heav'n of heav'ns with grateful heart  We hail the glorious promise which unfolds  The gates of bliss and present entrance gives  To the repentant sinner Now no more  Conjecture ponders on the life to come  Our dying Savior draws aside the veil  Through which dim reason caught a doubtful glimpse  Of shadowy realms that stretch'd beyond the grave  Elysian scenes in clouds and mist involv'd  Yet with this comfort take the caution too  For who shall say what penitence was his  That earn'd this promise Fatally he errs  Whose hope foreruns repentance who presumes  That God will pardon when he's tir'd of sin  And like a stale companion casts it off  Oh arrogant delusive impious thought  To meditate commodious truce with Heaven  When death's swift arrow smites him unprepar'd  And that protracted moment never comes  Or comes too late Turn then presumptuous man  Turn to the other sinner on the cross  Who died reviling there behold thy doom  Thou too the Virgin Mother of our Lord  By the angelic salutation hail'd  Blest above women thou amidst the group  Of sympathising mourners at that hour  Wast present when th' incarnate Virtue born  Of thine immac'ulate womb impregn'd of Heav'n  Hung on the cross expiring He from thence  On thee disconsolate a dying look  Of tenderest pity cast and at thy side  Noting the meek disciple whom he lov'd  Thus both address'dWoman behold thy son  Son look upon thy motherSacred charge  And piously fulfill'dNow darkness fell  On all the region round the shrowded sun  From the impen'itent earth withdrew his light  I thirstthe Savior cried and lifting up  His eyes in agonyMy God my God  Ah why hast thou forsaken meexclaim'd  Yet deem him not forsaken of his God  Beware that error 'Twas the mortal part  Of his compounded nature breathing forth  It's last sad agony that so complain'd  Doubt not that veil of sorrow was withdrawn  And heav'nly comfort to his soul vouchsaf'd  Ere thus he criedFather into thy hands  My spirit I commendThen bow'd his head  And died Now GABRIEL and his heav'nly choir  Of minist'ring angels hov'ring o'er the cross  Receiv'd his spi'rit at length from mortal pangs  And fleshly pris'on set free and bore it thence  Upon their wings rejoicing Then behold  A prodigy that to the world announc'd  A new religion and dissolv'd the old  The temple's sacred vail was rent in twain  From top to bottom 'midst th' attesting shocks  Of earthquake and the rending up of graves  Now those mysterious symbols heretofore  Curtain'd from vulgar eyes and holiest deem'd  Of holies were display'd to public view  The mercyseat with its cherubic wings  O'ershadow'd and the golden ark beneath  Covering the testimony now through the rent  Of that dissever'd vail first saw the light  A world redeem'd had now no further need  Of types and emblems dimly shadowing forth  An angry Deity withdrawn from sight  And canopied in clouds Him face to face  Now in full light reveal'd the dying breath  Of his dear Son appeas'd and purchas'd peace  And reconcilement for offending man  Thus the partition wall by Moses built  By CHRIST was level'd and the Gentile world  Enter'd the breach by their great Captain led  Up to the throne of grace opening himself  Through his own flesh a new and living way  Then were the oracles of God made known  To all the nations sprinkled by the blood  Of JESUS and baptiz'd into his death  So was the birthright of the elderborn  Heirs of the promise forfeited whilst they  Whom sin had erst in bondage held made free  From sin and servants of the living God  Now gain'd the gift of God eternal life  Soon as these signs and prodigies were seen  Of those who watch'd the cross conviction smote  Their fearstruck hearts The sun at noonday dark  The earth convulsive underneath their feet  And the firm rocks in shiver'd fragments rent  Rous'd them at once to tremble and believe  Then was our Lord by heathen lips confess'd  When the centurion criedIn very truth  This righteous person was the Son of God  The rest in heart assenting stood abash'd  Watching in silence the tremendous scene  The recollection of his gracious acts  His dying pray'rs and their own impious taunts  Now rose in sad review too late they wish'd  The deed undone and sighing smote their breasts  Strait from God's presence went that Angel forth  Whose trumpet shall call up the sleeping dead  At the last day and bade the Saints arise  And come on earth to hail this promis'd hour  The dayspring of Salvation Forth they came  From their dark tenements their shadowy forms  Made visible as in their fleshly state  And through the Holy City here and there  Frequent they gleam'd by night by day with fear  And wonder seen of many Holy seers  Prophets and martyrs from the grave set free  And the firstfruits of the redeemed dead  They who with CHRIST transfigur'd on the mount  Were seen of his disciples in a cloud  Of dazzling glory now in form distinct  Mingling amidst the public haunts of men  Struck terror to all hearts Ezekiel there  The captive seer to whom on Chebar's banks  The heav'ns were open'd and the fatal roll  Held forth with dire denunciations fill'd  Of lamentation mourning and of woe  Now falling fast on Israel's wretched race  He too was there Hilkiah's holy son  With loins close girt and glowing lips of fire  By God's own finger touch'd There might be seen  The youthful prophet Belteshazzar nam'd  Of the Chaldees interpreter of dreams  Knowledge of God bestow'd in visions skill'd  And fair and learn'd and wise The Baptist here  Girt in his hairy mantle frowning stalk'd  And pointing to his ghastly wound exclaim'd  Ye vipers whom my warning could not move  Timely to flee from the impending wrath  Now fallen on your heads whom I indeed  With water CHRIST hath now with fire baptiz'd  Barren ye were of fruits which I prescrib'd  Meet for repentance and behold the axe  Is laid to the unprofitable root  Of every sapless tree hewn down condemn'd  And cast into the fire Lo these are they  These shadowy forms now floating in your sight  These are the harbingers of antient days  Who witness'd the Messias and announc'd  His coming upon earth Mark with what scorn  Silent they pass you by Them had ye heard  Them had ye noted with a patient mind  Ye had not crucified the LORD OF LIFE  He of these stones to Abraham shall raise up  Children than you more worthy of his stock  And now his winnowing fan is in his hand  With which he'll purge his floor and having stor'd  The precious grain in garners will consume  With fire unquenchable the refuse chaff  Thus the terrific Vision in the ears  Of the astonish'd multitude declaim'd  With threat'ning voice and wrung their conscious hearts  Whilst the blaspheming priests who in their scorn  Triumphant saw the Savior of the world  Expiring on the cross and deem'd him lost  Now by the resurrection of the saints  Usher'd on earth with prodigies and signs  Confounded and amaz'd began to doubt  If yet the sepulchre had power to keep  It's crucified Possessor safe in hold  And with these thoughts perplex'd masking their fears  Under pretence of caution they repair  To PILATE and demand a Roman guard  To watch the tomb of CHRIST and then they add  For we remember that Deceiver said  Whilst he was yet alive after three days  I will again arise therefore we pray  Command the sepulchre to be made sure  Till the third day lest his disciples come  By night and craftily remove him thence  So the last error shall outgo the first  But PILATE whose unrighteous judgment still  Sate heavy on his heart had little care  For what might them befall and to their suit  Briefly reply'dWhy do ye ask of me  That custody which in yourselves ye have  Take your own watch and to their charge commit  The safeguard of that body which though dead  Keeps yet alive your fears 'Tis your own cause  As such I leave it with you so begone  He said and turn'd aside nor did they tempt  Further discourse but murm'ring went their way  END OF THE SIXTH BOOK  CALVARY OR  THE DEATH OF CHRIST  BOOK VII  THE ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTH BOOK  This Book opens with the scene of Mount Calvary at the coming on of evening Christ still hanging dead upon the cross the disciples standing apart and the holy women watching amongst whom is the Blessed Virgin supported by St John Christ having bequeathed her to his care His address to her on this subject and her reply The soldiers come and break the legs of the two malefactors but finding Christ already dead they pierce his heart with a spear and blood and water issues from the wound They take him down from the cross and lay him in the sepulchre His spirit in the meanwhile is conveyed by the angels into the region of Death that region described and the distant prospect of the bottomless pit where the souls of the wicked are in torment Christ points out these scenes to Gabriel and instructs him as to the future objects of his descent into this gloomy region Satan expelled from earth falls prostrate at the foot of the throne of Death He makes suit to that power for protection Death rejects his intercessions The person and palace of the King of Terrors described The triumphant entry of Christ Satan is hurled into the bottomless pit and there bound by the strong angel the horrors of that dreadful abode are represented Death humbles himself before the Redeemer of mankind and conscious that his power is overthrown tenders his crown to Christ as to his conqueror He lays the key at his feet which sets free the souls of the Saints who are destined to be partakers of the first resurrection This key is given to Gabriel with instructions for their release Christ in his reply to Death forewarns him of his doom but signifies to him that the dissolution of his power will not be immediate The approach of the Saints concludes the Book  CALVARY  BOOK VII THE DESCENT INTO HELL  NOW Hesperus renew'd his evening lamp  And hung it forth amid the turbid sky  To mark the close of this portentous day  The lab'ring sun in his midcourse eclips'd  Darkling at length had reach'd his western goal  And now it seem'd as if all Nature slept  O'erspent and wearied with convulsive throes  Upon his cross the martyr'd Savior hung  Pale through the twilight gleam'd his breathless corpse  And silvery white as when the moonbeam plays  On the smooth surface of the glassy lake  His thorncrown'd head upon his breast reclin'd  His arms were wide outspread as if in act  To' embrace and welcome the converted world  So were they late expanded when he cried  Come all ye heavy laden come to me  And I will give you rest Death had not dar'd  To rob those features of one heav'nly grace  Nor had the worm authority to taint  That incorruptible and hallow'd shrine  Wherein his purity had deign'd to dwell  The living saints here mingling with the dead  Stood round in pensive meditation rapt  Silent spectators of the awful scene  There his disciples in a group apart  Like frighted sheep that cluster in a storm  Throng'd each on other interchanging looks  Of sorrow and despair no voice was heard  No utterance but of sighs though all had need  Of comfort none had comfort to bestow  But PETER in whose selfaccusing breast  Grief roll'd in tempests had the whilst chos'n out  A solitary spot where at his length  Outstretch'd with face incumbent on the ground  He lay like one whom fortune had cast off  Of all hope 'reft most wretched and forlorn  There too the holy Mother might be seen  Like Rizpah watching o'er her murder'd son  Rooted in earth a monument of woe  Beside her bath'd in sympathising tears  First in his Master's love as meek of soul  Stood JOHN adopted by his dying Lord  Son and supporter of that mournful Saint  At length with reverend love he turn'd his eyes  Upon the Virgin Mother and thus spake  Oh thou participant with God himself  In his incarnate Offspring if I claim  The glorious title which my dying Lord  On me thy servant ever now thy son  Gracious bequeath'd let not my words offend  High honor and a trust than life more dear  Hath CHRIST by this adoption deign'd to cast  On me unmeriting yet well I heard  Those sacred wordsMother behold thy son  Son look upon thy motherYes I heard  And treasuring in my heart the rich bequest  Bow'd and obey'd Ev'n then my zeal had spoke  The dictates of devotion had I dar'd  To break the awful silence of that hour  Or sacrilegiously divert the ear  Of mute attention whilst those lips divine  Those living oracles had breath to move  Now mute alas for He is now no more  Who had the words of life Our hope is quench'd  Our glory vanish'd See the deed is done  Those murderers have kill'd the Prince of Peace  Cold on the cross and stiff'ning in the wind  To the rude elements his corpse is left  Nor is there found who shall provide a grave  For the sad reliques of the Son of God  But lo the heav'ns that three long hours have mourn'd  In darkness now throw off their sable shroud  The earth no longer quakes beneath our feet  The shatter'd rocks subside Nature is calm  The sun unmasks and through disparted clouds  With ruddy twilight streaks the western sky  And may not we since God hath now withdrawn  His terrors and asswag'd the wrathful sky  May not we hope that as his light revives  At the third hour so of his blessed Son  The promis'd resurrection to new life  At the third day shall also come to pass  When as the sun emerging from eclipse  Darkness dispells so CHRIST from out the grave  Arising shall dispell our dark despair  To him the holy Mother thus replied  Thou meek Disciple in thy Master's love  Preeminently blest since He whose will  Should govern so decrees it from this hour  Henceforth I lodge thee in a mother's heart  And hold thee as my son for I perceive  CHRIST from his human nature is withdrawn  And to mortality hath render'd back  All that from me a mortal he receiv'd  His Incorruptible now lives with God  And in that glory I no part must claim  Flesh cannot share with spirit Henceforth thou  Thou art my son adopted in the place  Of that incarnate Virtue of whose birth  Miraculous the eastern star gave sign  And Angels witness'd him the Son of God  And now behold what wonders mark his death  Whence are these prodigies What but the hand  Of God can shake the pillars of the earth  Seal up the sun and rend these rocks in twain  Turn day to night tear down the temple vail  Break up the graves and bid the saints come forth  Lo where they pass as sensible to sight  As in broad day substantial man to man  And can we ask if He be very CHRIST  Whom stars and Angels usher'd into birth  Can we doubt Him on whom the Spi'rit of God  Dovelike descended Can we stop our ears  Against a voice from heav'n Are we so blind  Dull and insensible not to behold  That sun emergent and these moving shapes  That to revisit earth have left their graves  Awaken'd as from sleep If these can rise  If these whose bones are moulder'd into dust  On whom the worm hath fed for ages men  As mortal as ourselves can reascend  Out of the pit do not these signs bespeak  His second coming who is LORD and CHRIST  He shall He shall return upon the earth  Victorious over death and we though now  Humbled in heart and for a season sad  Yet wavering not in faith and holding fast  The anchor of our hope shall yet again  Behold his glory and as now his death  Turns day to night his resurrection then  Shall into joy convert our present gloom  But see where PETER prostrate on the earth  Is lost in sorrow Haste and bid him rise  Tell him the day's at hand when he must work  Hath he not heard the servant shall not sleep  In his Lord's absence Strengthen thou his heart  So spake these Saints and each to other gave  Alternate solace faith inspiring hope  And hope asswaging woe At PETER's side  Behold the meek discipleUp he cries  Awake and put on strength The Virgin Saint  The Mother of our Lord bids thee awake  Unprofitable grief availeth nought  But godly sorrow is approv'd in works  Meet for repentance Up for CHRIST though dead  Yet speaketh and shall come again on earth  Woe to that servant therefore whom his Lord  Shall find thus sleeping great shall be his wrath  This said he reach'd his hand and rais'd him up  He stood and spakeServant of CHRIST approv'd  Thee and thy blessed Sender I obey  Yet doth my heart by deep remorse subdued  Press downward to the dust A wretch I am  Who hath denied his Lord What can I do  A miserable man O righteous JOHN  When thou shalt spread abroad as sure thou wilt  The direful doings of this fatal day  And publish to mankind the wond'rous love  Of CHRIST thus dying for them I conjure thee  Be faithful to the truth screen not my crime  Foul though it be but let the nations know  PETER who vaunted of himself was false  So shall they reap instruction from my shame  And by despising me correct themselves  Thus spake the contrite Saint when now the priests  Whose custom was upon this solemn eve  To purge their Golgotha from human blood  Send forth their guard official to remove  CHRIST and the slaves convict before the dawn  Of that great day too hallow'd to permit  Their bodies fest'ring on th' illomen'd cross  And lo the soldiers so encharg'd arrive  Survey the victims and begin the work  But first the pond'rous sledge with horrid crash  Descending breaks the knees and ankle joints  Of these two criminals for stubborn life  Still hover'd on their lips and now and then  Their heaving bosoms fetch'd a deepdrawn sigh  Like the slow swell of seas without a wind  But when the Savior's body they approach'd  And saw there needed not a second blow  To make his death secure the word of God  Prophetic mov'd their else obdurate hearts  To break no limb yet one so destin'd thrust  His spear into his side and forthwith flow'd  Water and blood from the heartpiercing wound  So deep the stab that to life's citadel  Had life remain'd the mortal point had reach'd  And there had finish'd it Meanwhile behold  JOSEPH arrives a counsellor was he  But not for death and rich and just withal  In Ramoth born where Samuel first drew breath  And as his heart in righteousness and faith  Stood firm with CHRIST whilst living so his zeal  An honour'able interment to bestow  On his dead Master prompted him to make  Bold suit to PILATE for the lifeless corpse  Nor fail'd he of his suit therefore he came  So favor'd to receive the precious charge  Of those dear reliques and with decent rites  Commit them to the grave Spear'd to the heart  And death with double diligence ensur'd  The body they take down the hands and feet  Pierc'd through with nails and all besmear'd with blood  O piteous spectacle which to behold  Bathes every angel face in heav'n with tears  Accursed Deicides the time comes on  When every mark your sacrilegious hands  Have printed on that corpse shall be a seal  To testify against you every gash  Unclos'd shall with it's living lips proclaim  CHRIST in his human attributes renew'd  Corporeal yet immortal Then the hand  Of him who doubts shall probe those gaping wounds  And by the evidence of sense compel  The faithless and reluctant to believe  And now they place the body on the bier  Cleans'd of the blood and wrapt in seemly cloths  Then under guard convey it to the vault  Hewn in the rock where never corpse was laid  And there consign it to it's dark abode  Rolling a massy fragment to the door  Unwieldy vast and having seal'd the stone  They post their centinels and so depart  Meanwhile the' unhoused spirit of CHRIST set free  From gross communion with his earthly clay  Borne with the meteor's speed upon the wings  Of mightiest Cherubim had now approach'd  The dark confines of Death's engulph'd domain  Here at the barrier of that vast profound  On the firm adamant from whence uprose  The tow'ring structure of hell's ebon gate  The heav'nly Visitant descending bade  His cherub bearers stoop their wings on which  As in a plumey chariot he rode  And now alighted on the dreadful brink  The Savior paus'd and downward cast his eye  O'er that immeasurable blank the grave  Of universal Nature founded then  And charter'd to the gloomy powers of Sin  And Death Sinborn when the primaeval pair  Lost immortality and fell from God  The starry lamps of heav'n here lost their light  No sunbeam ever reach'd this dismal realm  Yet in CHRIST's spi'rit divine that living light  Which from the Father of creation flow'd  Before all time inherently supplied  Selffurnish'd vision to explore the bounds  Of that oblivious pit in whose dark womb  Myriads of unredeemed souls were plung'd  All who of human birth had pass'd that gate  From righteous Abel the firstfruit of death  To him whose heart had newly ceas'd to beat  Were in that gulph immers'd At farthest end  Of that Obscure a pillary cloud arose  Of sulph'rous smoke that from hell's crater steam'd  Whence here and there by intermittent gleams  Blue flashing fires burst forth that sparkling blaz'd  Up to the iron roof whose echoing vault  Resounded ever with the dolorous groans  Of the sad crew beneath Thence might be heard  The wailing suicide's remorseful plaint  The murd'rer's yelling scream and the loud cry  Of tyrants in that fiery furnace hurl'd  Vain cry▪ th' unmitigated furies urge  Their ruthless task and to the cauldron's edge  With ceaseless toil huge blocks of sulphur roll  Pil'd mountains high to feed the greedy flames  All these th' accursed brood of Sin were once  The guilty pleasures the false joys that lur'd  Their sensual vota'rists to th' infernal pit  Them their fell mother watchful o'er the work  With eye that sleep ne'er clos'd and snaky scourge  Still waving o'er their heads for ever plies  To keep the fiery deluge at it's heighth  And stops her ears against the clam'rous din  Of those tormented who for mercy call  Age after age implor'd and still denied  These when th' allpresent Spirit of CHRIST descried  At distance tossing in the sulph'rous lake  And heard their dismal groans the conscious sense  Of human weakness by experience earn'd  In his own mortal body now put off  And recollection that Himself of late  In his sublunar pilgrimage had prov'd  Temptations like to their's drew from his soul  A sigh of nat'ral pity as from man  To man although in merited distress  But when his human sympathy gave place  To judgment better weigh'd and riper thoughts  Congenial with the Godhead reassum'd  The justice of their doom th' abhorrence due  To their vile deeds by voluntary act  Of will left free committed in despight  Of conscience moving them to better thoughts  Turn'd him indignant from the loathed sight  Of these impenitents when after pause  To GABRIEL chief of the cherubic host  And late his strength'ning angel thus he spake  GABRIEL or e'er from this high steep we launch  With prone descent into this gloomy vast  This shadowy dark inane the realm of Death  After so swift a race through all the spheres  From earth to this hell's portal it behoves  Thee and thy plumed cohort to recruit  The vigor of your wings for sure I am  That in this subterranean we shall find  No breeze from heav'n's pure aether to give aid  To motion or uphold in steady poise  Your feath'ry vans outstretch'd nor may we look  For star or planet or one straggling ray  From circumlucent sun to guide our course  Through this obscure domain of Night and Death  Nor less behoves thee gentle as thou art  Friendliest to man of all heav'n's angel host  And for each task of mercy and of love  First in the choice of God to arm thy heart  For the sad spectacles the dismal scenes  Which we must needs encounter in this gulph  Of human misery this world of woes  Fit residence for SATAN and his crew  Of outcast angels sad reverse to thee  Inhabitant of heav'n And now behold  Where hell's infernal pit with horrid glare  Flames through the dismal gloom there but that God  In mercy films thine archangelic eye  Such myriads in that everburning lake  Of souls tormented thou wouldst else discern  As would appal thy nature but these scenes  From thee a spi'rit so loving to mankind  So melting soft to pity are withheld  No mercy can I meditate far them  Impenitent no embassy of peace  Have I in charge no respite till the trump  Of general resurrection calls them up  At the last day of judgment then to hear  Their crimes rehears'd their blasphemies expos'd  Their envyings frauds revilings treach'ries plots▪  And ev'ry secret of their hearts unmask'd  By an allrighteous Judge who shall pronounce  Their final condemnation and decree  Their present pains perpetual We meanwhile  To other regions shall divert our course  From them and from their torments far apart  Regions of night and silence where the souls  Of righteous men in their oblivious caves  Sleep out the time till their Deliverer comes  To wake them from their trance dissolve the spell  Of their enchanter Death and set them free  To range the fields of Paradise where flows  As from a fountain by God's presence fed  Beatitude surpassing human thought  Pleasures unseen unnumber'd unconceiv'd  This said from those high battlements the Dove  Of Peace upon Redemption's errand sent  Borne on the wings of his cherubic choir  Descended swift and through the drowsy void  To Death's terrific palace steer'd his flight  Here the Archfoe of man from earth expell'd  By man's Redeemer newly had arriv'd  But fearstruck and in like disastrous trim  With warworn Sisera when in his flight  From the victorious Naphthalite he came  To ask protection at falfe Jael's tent  And ruin found instead The whirlwind's blast  Had shatter'd his proud form now scorch'd by fires  Now driv'n to regions of perpetual frost  Beyond extremest Saturn's wint'ry sphere  No middle course kept he nor had his feet  From their aërial journey once found rest  Till at the threshold of Death's gloomy throne  Down on the solid adamant he fell  Precipitate at once and lay entranc'd  Of archangelic majesty the wreck  Scar'd at the hideous crash and all aghast  Death scream'd amain then wrapt himself in clouds  And in his dark pavilion trembling sate  Mantled in night And now the prostrate fiend  Rear'd his terrific head with lightnings scorch'd  And furrow'd deep with scars of livid hue  Then stood erect and roll'd his bloodshot eyes  To find the ghastly vision of grim Death  Who at the sudden downfal of his fire  Startled and of his own destruction warn'd  Had shrunk from sight and to a misty cloud  Dissolv'd hung lowring o'er his shrouded throne  When SATAN whose last hope was now at stake  Impatient for the interview exclaim'd  Where art thou Death Why hide thyself from him  Of whom thou art Come forth thou grisly king  And though to suitor of immortal mould  Thy refuge be denied yet at my call  Thy father's call come forth and comfort me  Thou gaunt anatomy with one short glimpse  Of those dry bones in which alone is peace  And that oblivious sleep for which I sigh  He said and now a deep and hollow groan  Like roar of distant thunders shook the hall  And from before the cloudenvelop'd throne  The adamantine pavement burst in twain  With hideous crash selfopen'd and display'd  A subterranean chasm whose yawning vault  Deep as the pit of Acheron forbade  All nearer access to the shado'wy king  Whereat the imprison'd winds that in it's womb  Were cavern'd 'gan to heave their yeasty waves  In bubbling exhalations till at once  Their eddying vapors working upwards burst  From the broad vent enfranchis'd when behold  The cloud that late around the throne had pour'd  More than Egyptian darkness now began  To lift it's fleecy skirts till through the mist  The imperial Phantom gleam'd monster deform'd  Enormous terrible from heel to scalp  One dire anatomy his giant bones  Star'd through the shrivell'd skin that loosely hung  On his sepulchral carcase round his brows  A cypress wreath tiaralike he wore  With nightshade and cold hemlock intertwin'd  Behind him hung his quiver'd store of darts  Wing'd with the raven's plume his fatal bow  Of deadly yew tall as Goliah's spear  Propp'd his unerring arm about his throne  If throne it might be call'd which was compos'd  Of human bones as in a charnel pil'd  A hideous group of dire diseases stood  Sorrows and pains and agonizing plagues  His ghastly satellites and ev'n than these  More terrible ambition's slaught'ring sons  Heroes and conquerors stil'd on earth but here  Doom'd to ignoble drudgery employ'd  To do his errands in the loathsome vault  And tend corruption's neverdying worm  To haunt the catacombs and ransack graves  Where some late popu'lous city is laid waste  By the destroying pestilence or storm'd  By murdering Russ or Tartar bloodbesmear'd  And furious in the desp'rate breach to plant  His eagle or his crescent on the piles  Of mangled multitudes and flout the sky  With his victorious banners Now a troop  Of shrowded ghosts upon a signal given  By their terrific Monarch start to sight  Each with a torch funereal in his grasp  That o'er the hall diffus'd a dying light  Than darkness' self more horrible The walls  Of that vast cenotaph hung round with spears  Falchions and poleaxes and plumed helms  Shew'd like the arm'ory of some warlike state  There every mortal weapon might be seen  Each implement of old or new device  Which savage nature or inventive art  Furnish'd to arm the ruffian hand of war  And deal to man the lifedestroying stroke  And them betwixt at intervals were plac'd  The crowned skeletons of mighty kings  Caesars and Caliphs and barbarian Chiefs  Monsters whose swords had made creation shrink  And frighted peace and science from the earth  Pondering the scene in mute amazement rapt  The lost Archangel stood when soon the voice  Of Death as from the tombs lowmurmuring thus  Bespoke attentionWhat uncivil cause  Prince of the air provokes thee to offend  Against the peaceful charter of these realms  By voice thus rude and clamo'rous Know'st thou not  I reign by privilege though son not slave  Of thee heav'nexil'd Here no place hast thou  For here is peace no part in this domain  To thee and to thy rebel host belongs  They in the flames of Tartarus but we  Dwell with the silent worm The pow'r we have  O'er man's corruptible and mortal part  Ends with the body here the bones may sleep  For these anatomies disturb us not  But for the spark unquenchable the soul  Immortal which survives the fleeting breath  Of that we take no charge that must abide  In other regions it's appointed lot  Of misery or bliss What then hath Death  To do with SATAN Can the son who drew  Existence from the father quench that spi'rit  Which God decreed eternal Will those fires  Cease at my word Hell will not hear my voice  Nor can the howlings of th' infernal pit  Enter my ears Ask not repose of me  Tormented fiend There is no grave for sin  No sleep for SATAN fall'n from heav'n thou art  There thou hast no abode fall'n now from earth  Where is thy lodging Where but in those flames  Pass on then in thy course nor loiter here  For hell expects thee Wert thou here to stay  Death in destroying thee himself destroys  Whereto th' unwelcome visitant replied  Inhospitable Pow'r and is it thus  Thou greet'st a father in his extreme need  Suppliant for leave to draw a moment's breath  In thy pale presence till this furious blast  That follow'd me from earth shall spend it's rage  And cease to howl through the profound of hell  If in thy heartless trunk no mem'ory dwells  Of what I was Oh teach me to forget  What now I am and make my senses dull  To pain as thine to gratitude are lost  But if thy mind be present to record  My fall from bliss will it not also serve  To put thee in remembrance how that fall  Bestow'd on thee a station and a name  Had I not fall'n from heav'n man had not lost  The joys of Paradise immortal joys  Till I destroy'd them who then but myself  Exil'd from God brought Death into the world  Gave thee the sepulchre for thy domain  And every mortal body for thy prey  Whose hand but SATAN's thankless as thou art  Plac'd that victorious wreath upon thy brow  Arm'd thee for war and bade thee be a king  And what doth SATAN now demand of Death  What but a moment's respite the small boon  Of hospitable shelter where to lay  My aching head and rest my weary wing  This to the father can the son refuse  I ask no more If CHRIST from whom I fly  Pursues me to this pit and into hell  Descending shall repass her gloomy gates  Guarded by Sin that barrier lost farewell  To all thy greatness Where shall be thy sting  O Death and where thy victory O Grave  Then to have harbor'd SATAN shall not add  One feather to the balance of thy fate  All must be lost together I to flames  Consign'd thou Phantom into air dissolv'd  No more of this vain arguing Death replied  My peace and my repose I can but deal  As God decrees and as he wills withhold  Thus wrangling to the latest hour of time  Nothing O SATAN could'st thou wring from me  But the same answer and the same despair  I with mortality alone confer  Thou art a deathless spirit If my pow'r  Cannot annihilate the soul of man  How then of angel Guilty thou hast been  Conscious must ever be and therefore curst  Of me complaining thou condemn'st thyself  The righteous ever are at peace with Death  Thou art not of their number Spi'rit unblest  Author of man's revolt and all things ill  The hell which thou hast peopled is thine own  Earth thou hast made a ruin men by thee  Perverted turn to monsters Heav'n itself  Disturb'd by thy rebellion for a while  Suffer'd convulsion and her thrones besieg'd  Echo'd the din of battle the fair bloom  Of Paradise was blasted by thy spells  And man driv'n forth to till th' unthankful earth  And toil and sweat for a precarious meal  Degraded from his origin at length  To me and to corruption was consign'd  These were thy doings this was my descent  And my inheritance the loathsome worm  The throne funereal and this yawning gulph  Impassable which I am yet to thank  For that it holds thee at a distance from me  This is thy bounty Look upon these bones  Survey this dread anatomy and say  If son so fashion'd owes his father thanks  Proportion'd to thy goodness I accord  My gratitude by bidding thee avaunt  Hence from my sight intruder Thrust from earth  As heretofore from heav'n and tempesttorn  With bruised head and shatter'd flagging wing  Hither thou com'st a fugitive from Him  Whom in the wilderness for forty days  Tempting thou didst annoy Dull doating spirit  Blind to thine own destruction not to see  God's pow'r in CHRIST nor understand that He  Who foil'd thy cunning might defy thy strength  But neither strength nor cunning shall prevail  To draw me forth upon a losing side  And set this empire on a desp'rate cast  I lack presumption to oppose that Power  Which puts hell's monarch to inglorious flight  What shelter can'st thou find behind a shade  An airy phantom Such thou say'st I am  Such let me be That phantom will not tempt  The furious blast of God's avenging breath  Nor mov'd to pity by thy treacherous plaints  Tender oblivion's boon to soul accurst  Such favor when thou wouldst extort from Death  That phantom will be adamant to thee  Now learn a truth CHRIST in the flesh is dead  Yet long I cannot hold him in the grave  His body interdicted to the worm  For some mysterious purpose is reserv'd  From all corruption free and sure I am  He will not leave his enemy at large  In this obscure domain where sleep the souls  Of righteous men fly then whilst yet the hour  Serves thee for flightAnd hark the angel trump  Sounds his approach Now tremble thou accurst  No more encanopied beneath the wings  Of mighty Cherubim with sounding trump  And joyful chaunt the LORD OF LIFE came on  Lift up your heads the heav'nly chorus sung  Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates  And CHRIST the King of Glory shall come in  Bright as the sun his presence darkness fled  Down to the center SATAN on the earth  Fell motionless Death trembled on his throne  And call'd his shadowy guards they with loud shrieks  Vanish'd in air whilst from the gulph profound  Blue lightnings flash'd and deepmouth'd thunders roar'd  When CHRIST with eye severe on SATAN turn'd  Bade the storm cease and thus address'd the fiend  Well art thou found thou serpent on the brink  Of thy last home this horrible abyss  For thee and for thine impious crew prepar'd  Man from his God by thy corruption turn'd  Is by my death receiv'd into the peace  Of his offended Maker and if faith  Opens his way to heav'n in righteousness  And true conversion Death cannot retain  His soul in darkness nor thy crafty wiles  Puzzle his path and damp his glowing zeal  But thou presumptuous who hast had the world  To range at will and from God's altars pluck'd  Their consecrated honors falsely view'd  Those spoils by sufferance yielded as the prize  Of thine own proper victory Behold  These are thy triumphs in this pit receive  Thy folly's confutation and the doom  Of woe eternal on thy sin denounc'd  He said nor other answer SATAN gave  Than one deep groan rent from his lab'ring breast  The strong vindictive Angel to whose charge  The key of that infernal pit belong'd  Now seiz'd him in his grasp and from the ground  Lifting his pond'rous bulk such vigor dwelt  In arm celestial headlong down at once  Down hurl'd him to the bottom of the gulph  Then follow'd on the wing His yelling cries  Death heard whilst terror shiver'd every bone  Not so the choir cherubic they with joy  Beheld Redemption's triumph in the fall  Of that Great Dragon enemy of man  That antient Serpent now with bruised head  And stingbereft hurl'd down into the pit  Whereat in heav'nly concert they begin  To raise their tuneful voices and sing forth  Praise to the Lamb of God and joyful strain  Of gratulation to the Saints redeem'd  Now is salvation come and strength and power  The kingdom of our God and of his CHRIST  Now is that railing and malignant foe  Cast down into the pit which day and night  Accus'd our righteous brethren to their God  Now are they made victorious by the blood  Of the Redeeming Lamb and in the word  Of Truth their fearless witness through the world  Go forth against the anarchy of Sin  A host of martyrs faithful unto death  Therefore rejoice ye heav'ns and ye of earth  Inhabitants awake to joy and hail  The dayspring of Salvation from on high  SATAN meanwhile ten thousand fathoms deep  At bottom of the pit a mangled mass  With shatter'd brain and broken limbs outspread  Lay groaning on the adamantine rock  Him the strong Angel with ethereal touch  Made whole in form but not to strength restor'd  Rather to pain and the acuter sense  Of shame and torment hideous was the glare  Of his bloodstreaming eyes and loud he yell'd  For very agony whilst on his limbs  The massy fetters such as hell alone  Could forge in hottest sulphur were infix'd  And rivetted in the perpetual stone  Upon his back he lay extended huge  A hideous ruin not a word vouchsaf'd  That vengeful Angel but with quick dispatch  Plied his commission'd task then stretch'd the wing  And upward flew for now th' infernal cave  Through all it's vast circumference had giv'n  The dreadful warning and began to close  It's rocky ribs upon th' imprison'd fiend  Fierce and more fierce as it approach'd became  The flaming concave thus comprest the vault  Red as metallic furnace glow'd intense  With heat that had the hideous den been less  Than adamant it had become a flood  Or SATAN other than he was in sin  And archangelic strength preeminent  He neither could have suffer'd nor deserv'd  Panting he roll'd in streams of scalding sweat  Parch'd with intolerable thirst one drop  Of water then to cool his raging tongue  Had been a boon worth all his golden shrines  Vain wish for now the pit had clos'd it's mouth  Nor other light remain'd than what the glare  Of those reverberating fires bestow'd  Then all the dungeon round was thick beset  With horrid faces threat'ning as they glar'd  Their haggard eyes upon him from hell's lake  Flocking they came whole legions of the damn'd  His worshippers on earth sensual profane  Abominable in their lives monsters of vice  Bloodstained murderers apostate kings  And crowned tyrants some tormented now  For their past crimes and into furies turn'd  Accusing their betrayer Curses dire  Hissings and tauntings now from every side  Assail'd his ear on him on him alone  From Cain first murderer to ISCARIOT all  All with loud voices charg'd on him their sins  Their agonies with imprecations urg'd  For treble vengeance on his head accurst  Founder of hell sole author of their woe  And enemy avow'd of all mankind  Now when the King of Terrors had perceiv'd  The pow'r of his new Visitant and saw  SATAN engulph'd and the devouring pit  Best barrier of his throne for ever clos'd  Descending from his state with heart abash'd  Conscious that pride would ill befriend him now  In presence of his Conqueror at the feet  Of CHRIST with low obeisance he put off  The trophies of his brow and on the knee  Stooping his vassal head low homage paid  And suppliant thus his humble suit preferr'd  Immortal King all glorious and all good  At whose great name befits that every knee  In heav'n or earth or in these realms beneath  Should bend adoring let thy will prevail  Here as wherever else And sure I am  'Tis not my pow'r but thine own wond'rous love  Consenting to the deed hath brought thee here  In pity to mankind to taste the cup  Of agony and visit these sad shades  Though deathless thence to reascend as soon  Thou shalt victorious to the realms of light  I know thee for the CHRIST the Son of God  Messias of the prophets long foreseen  Yet of the unbelieving Jews despis'd  Rejected for thou cam'st not in the pomp  Of tempo'ral majesty and only great  In patience in humility in love  And miracles of mercy At thy feet  This head uncrown'd thus stooping I resign  All empire not on me let fall thy wrath  As on that bruised Serpent What am I  What is the sword what is the pestilence  And all my host of mortal ministers  But servants of thy providence a scourge  And rod of vengeance wherewith to chastise  Presumptuous guilty pride Whose hand but mine  Strikes terror to the atheist's harden'd heart  Who plucks the tyrant from his bloody car  And rolls him in the dust or at a blow  Strangles the curse in the blasphemer's throat  If on the martyr's head my axe descends  The same hand plants a crown of glory there  And if in my dark caves the righteous sleep  Peaceful they sleep I break not their repose  For silence dwells with me and night and rest  Behold the key inviolate that guards  Their hallow'd slumbers never did I yield  Though oft solicited this sacred pledge  To SATAN or his sindefiled crew  Faithful I've kept it ever faithful now  To thee their Savior I resign my charge  This said the golden badge of his command  Rich and of heav'nly workmanship with gems  Of azure green and purple thick emboss'd  Humbly he laid at the REDEEMER's feet  He to the zeal of GABRIEL strait consign'd  Th' enlargement of those spi'rits to bliss preferr'd  Fit minister for office so benign  Whereat he bade sound forth the signal trump  Of the First Resurrection heard of none  Save of those holy Saints elect of God  Martyrs and prophets call'd to live with CHRIST  In antecedent glory till the day  Of general Resurrection shall awaken  And summon into judgment all mankind  Swift hied that friendly Angel on the wing  Swifter for that on gracious errand sent  Joy urg'd him to put forth his utmost speed  Meanwhile the heav'nly Visitant of Death  Upon that ghastly Vision turn'd his eyes  And thus in accent mild address'd the Shade  That I came down from heav'n and am the CHRIST  Rightly O Death thou hast pronounc'd yet here  I come not to destroy thy power at once  But to set free the Saints thou hold'st in thrall  And call them to my peace but ev'n of these  Part till my second coming must abide  Of thee and all things of corruption bred  The term is fix'd God must be all in all  But time as man computes hath yet to roll  Through numerous ages ere the final trump  Shall sound thy knell I brought not upon earth  Peace but the sword the gospel I have preach'd  Man will corrupt misconstrue and pervert  Nor shall my Church be only drench'd with blood  Of it's own martyrs zealots shall arise  Aliens to my humility and peace  With more than pagan enmity enflam'd  Each against other then shall ruthless war  And persecution and fierce civil rage  Ravage the Christian world intole'rant pride  Usurping pow'r infallible shall send  It's heralds forth with cursing in their mouths  And fetters for man's conscience in their hands  They in the battle's front shall plant the Cross  And bid the unconverted nations kneel  Under their conqu'ring standard and adopt  The creed of murderers who in the place  Of the pure bond of charity present  A forged scroll blurr'd and defac'd with lies  And impiously inscribe it with my Name  These are religion's traitors and from them  An ample harvest shalt thou reap O Death  Suffice it thee to know that for a while  Thou shalt be spar'd And now no more Behold  GABRIEL leads on the congregated Saints  Vanish pale Phantom Give the ransom'd place  END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK  CALVARY OR  THE DEATH OF CHRIST  BOOK VIII  THE ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHTH BOOK  Christ having closed his interview with Death prepares to receive the Saints of the First Resurrection now approaching under the conduct of the angel Gabriel and having ascended a mount in the midst of the congregation appears to them in glory They pay homage to their Redeemer in a hymn of praise and thanksgiving He addresses them in reply and assures them of the blessings of immortal life bestowed upon them by the Father as the reward of righteousness The patriarch Abraham enters into conference with Christ in the conclusion of which the Savior of the world shews him the glorious vision of the heavenly Jerusalem the holy city as described in the Apocalypse When this beatific vision is passed away Christ reascends to earth in view of the whole assembly of Saints The angel Gabriel who is left behind addresses them from the mount and expounds the purposes of the Savior's resurrection from the dead and return to earth Moses recapitulates the events of his life instances the frequent rebellions of the Lord's unfaithful people and laments their future impenitence and incredulity Gabriel replies and from the nature of man's free will explains the origin and necessity of evil from which he deduces the benefits of Christ's death and redemption And now the Spirit of God descending on the hearts of the righteous inspires them with all understanding and knowledge fitted to their happy condition A Paradise arises within the regions of Death Gabriel addresses them for the last time and upon his departure the Poem concludes  CALVARY  BOOK VIII THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD  NOW had the Savior by the word of power  Wafted the magic Phantom into air  And all the horrors of the scene dispell'd  Swift as the stroke of his own winged dart  Or flitting shadows by the moonbeam chas'd  Death on the instant vanish'd What had seem'd  A citadel of proud and martial port  With bastions fenc'd and tow'rs impregnable  Of adamant compos'd and lofty dome  Covering the throne imperial now was air  And far as eye could reach a level plain  In the intermin'able horizon lost  Unfolded it's vast champain to the view  Darkness twinborn with Death had fled the rays  That from the Savior's suncrown'd temples beam'd  With dazzling lustre brighten'd all the scene  There just emerging to the distant view  And glitt'ring white a multitude appear'd  Stretch'd east and west in orderly array  Swift marching underneath the mighty wings  Of the protecting Angel who in air  Soar'd imminent and with the broad expanse  From flank to flank envelop'd all the host  He with the blast of the awak'ning trump  Gave note of their advance In the midplain  There was a mount thither the Savior hied  With his cherubic guard and there in view  Of the assembled myriads stood sublime  The Saints in order form'd themselves around  Orb within orb each in his proper sphere  Instinctively arrang'd then all at once  As by one soul inspir'd with bended knee  And forehead prostrate on the earth they paid  Joint homage and ador'd Oh who shall dare  With bold conjecture to compute the list  Of that blest multitude or say who first  Who last receiv'd the glorious Allhail  Ye blessed of my Father Yet perchance  So warranted by scripture and so taught  By moral sage experience we may doubt  If many rich if many great or learn'd  Were of that righteous company be sure  The lover of this world had there no place  He barter'd it for gold he pass'd it off  To Belial for a perishable toy  He sold it to a wanton There the proud  Were brought down and the meek and lowly rais'd  The conque'ror not of others but himself  There found preeminence All joy to him  Who rear'd the orphan dried the widow's tears  And sought affliction in her secret haunts  Not for the praise of men and may not we  Born in an age when mild philanthropy  Hath taught a better lesson to the heart  May not we foster a kind hope that some  Of pagan name were call'd who through the maze  Of dark idolatry took Reason's clue  And found a mental avenue to God  Here with the Father of the Faithful stood  A host of patriarchs prophets judges saints  Noah who perfect in the time of wrath  And righteous found was left unto the earth  A remnant when the waters fell from heav'n  And was in covenant with the Most High  That man no more should perish by the flood  Moses the faithful servant of the Lord  Meekest though mightiest of the sons of men  And glorious in the sight of dreadful kings  Joshua th' avenger of th' Elect of God  Whose voice upon mount Gibeon staid the sun  In the midheav'n and bade the moon stand still  In Ajalon's dark vale till Israel ceas'd  From slaughter and the conqu'ring sword was sheath'd  Here Samuel in his linen ephod girt  Thrice call'd of God amid the foremost stood  He who with Baäl's priests contending rear'd  His rival altars and brought fire from heav'n  To vindicate his God The Psalmist King  And he at whose sick pray'r the sun went back  And he surnam'd the Good Daniel the feer  And they who in the furnace walk'd unhurt  All in the sacred page recorded just  And faithful servants of the living God  For who can doubt the holy word of truth  Attesting their salvation Yet there is  One who by promise sacredly assur'd  Of bliss immediate heard the glorious call  Whilst hanging on the cross by penitence  And faith obtain'd from the allgracious lips  Of God's own Son expiring at his side  Hail holy congregation elderborn  Of righteousness and firstfruits of the grave  Elect unto salvation Hail blest Saints  Now cloathed in white robes as in your lives  With purity sound forth your praise to God  And to the Lamb in whose blood ye are wash'd  Wave high your branches of victorious palm  Hymning the strain which He in Patmos heard  What time the glorious vision was reveal'd  Hail First and Last th' immortal chorus sung  Of all things the beginning and the end  For thou art he who liveth and wast dead  And lo thou art alive for evermore  And hold'st in hand of hell and death the keys  Salvation to our God and to the Lamb  At his right hand who sitteth on the throne  Blessing and glory wisdom honor power  Might and thanksgiving evermore to God  And to his CHRIST Father we give thee thanks  Lord God which wast and art and art to come  For this thy mighty pow'r in us fulfill'd  Now are the kingdoms of this world become  The kingdoms of our Lord and of his CHRIST  And he shall reign for ever now thy wrath  On the rebellious nations is let loose  Now is the first call of the sleeping saints  And all thy servants faithful unto death  Thou hast rewarded with eternal bliss  Henceforth for ever blessed are the dead  Thus dying in the Lord for they shall rest  From labor and their good works are not lost  Their hymn perform'd the whole redeemed host  With hands uplifted and all eyes direct  Upon the glorious Presence bent the knee  Silent whilst thus the LORD OF MERCY spake  Ye blessed of my Father prophets saints  And martyrs ye of Abraham's faithful stock  And ye though wild by nature grafted in  Upon the parent tree and bearing fruits  To life eternal welcome to my peace  Now are your watchings and your labors past  Your tribulations selfdenials pains  And mournings recompens'd never again  Shall ye know thirst or hunger nor the sun  Scorch you by day nor yet by night the moon  For ye shall dwell before the throne of God  And I will feed you I will lead you forth  To living founts and wipe away all tears  Come enter ye into your Master's joy  Come for the throne awaits you take the crown  Of glory take the kingdom from all time  For you prepar'd possess your happy rights  The earnings of your charity and love  For I was hungred and ye gave me meat  Thirsty I was and ye asswag'd my thirst  I was a stranger and ye took me in  Naked ye cloath'd me sick ye visited  I was in prison and ye came unto me  When Lord the righteous humbly interpos'd  When were these charities by us perform'd  How have we merited this praise of thee  Whom in the flesh we knew not Tell us Lord  When saw we thee anhungred and gave food  When thirsty and gave drink a stranger when  And took thee in naked and cloathed thee  When saw we thee in sickness or in prison  And came unto thee When didst thou endure  These hard necessities or we relieve  Whereto the LORD replied Truly ye say  Me in the flesh ye knew not yet in spi'rit  Ye knew me for my law was in your hearts  And what to these my brethren ye have done  Or to the least of these ye did to me  Patron of mercy and the friend of man  To every one but not to all alike  Some talent is in trust the loan of Heav'n  To husband as he may and he who spares  From his imparted fund wherewith to help  His neighbor's scantier dole improves the loan  And makes his Lord his debtor First and last  Ere Abraham was I am Open your ears  Hear mark and understand The world by sin  Original had fallen off from God  Man was become corrupt idolatrous  Abominable SATAN reign'd on earth  Ye are of various ages all have slept  And some from earliest times or e'er the flood  Swallow'd the nations yet with one accord  All in your several periods have bewail'd  Degenerated man Noah can tell  How all the earth with violence was fill'd  Or e'er the fountains of the vasty deep  Were broken up Moses can well declare  How hard and to rebellion prone the hearts  Of those whom he led forth Samuel beheld  A stiffneck'd generation spurn the yoke  And kick against their God but vain his voice  Vain all the prophets voices which foretold  My coming without whom the world were lost  Now is salvation come I've drank the cup  Of bitterness and died the death for man  My peace I've left on earth the living world  They have the word of truth and by that word  Through faith they shall be sav'd from them I came  To visit these dark regions and redeem  The saints who slept behold ye are alive  Death hath no more dominion SATAN chain'd  For ages shall abide his time to come  Meanwhile in glory ye shall dwell with me  By resurrection purchas'd with my blood  Ye are the firstfruits of immortal life  Now ABRAHAM father of the faithful band  And first in station nearest to the mount  His eyes uplifted to the face divine  Of the effulgent Virtue and thus spake  Yet once more as aforetime in the days  Of Sodom suffer me to plead for man  And ask of thee his Savior if these few  Few not in numbers yet for heav'n too few  And for heav'n's mercy seeing there are past  So many many ages of the world  Are all that shall be sav'd Alas for man  If this be the whole remnant all the stock  Cull'd from so many myriads for God's fold  Where are the nations vanish'd Where the hosts  That sea earth flood and fire have swallow'd up  Can hell contain them Can devouring Death  Find stomach for them all Did God make man  For death and hell or thou endure the cross  Only for us Are all the righteous shrunk  To this small measure And if these be all  Are they not yet enough to save the rest  If heav'nly mercy listen to our prayer  May not our righteousness so save a world  From wrath as once the righteousness of five  Had sav'd a guilty city from it's fate  To him the LORD OF MERCY I have said  Ye are the first fruits by my blood obtain'd  The earnest of redemption I have bruis'd  Not crush'd the Serpent's head he shall arise  Out of the pit once more to vex the earth  Death the last enemy is not destroy'd  Yet is his sceptre shorten'd and the key  That opens into life now in those hands  Where mercy best can place it for man's good  Thus of all pow'r though Death is not bereft  Yet I have shook his throne with inroad deep  Pierc'd his dark realm and you redeeming thence  Made tenantless your graves his strongest holds  With you when from this depth I reascend  And through heav'n's golden portal lead my host  Of Saints highwaving these victorious palms  Your white robes glitt'ring in God's starry courts  Great sure will be the triumph loud th' acclaim  When all my Father's Angels shall sound forth  Their joyful halelujahs round his throne  Enough for victory hath been atchiev'd  Destruction is reserv'd to that great day  When the compelling Angel shall go forth  To gather every atom of man's dust  Which the seas cover or the earth contains  Then shall all souls be judg'd if Abraham then  When of all hearts the secrets shall be known  Then if the Friend of God hath aught to urge  In mitigation of man's guilt be sure  Ere justice strike mercy will hear the plea  Of this no more The seasons and the times  Are with the Father the dread hour draws on  But I must first revisit those on earth  Whom I have left in sorrow for their sakes  I must again submit me to the flesh  And by the evidence of sense confirm  My promis'd resurrection this perform'd  And immortality reveal'd to man  By faith made sure my gospel shall go forth  My office then the Comforter will take  The weak he shall make strong the foolish wise  And by the mouths of sucklings and of babes  He shall confound the wisdom of the world  And o'er the gates of hell erect my Church  When thus the Patriarch glowing still with zeal  For man's salvation further question urg'd  Lord will not then the faithless world believe  When thou return'st with glory From the dead  When they behold thee visible on earth  And thence to heav'n ascending can they doubt  Such revelation can their eyes resist  Their ears such truth recorded Shall there then  Be left a Gentile idol upon earth  To rival Israel's God Shall there not be  One Shepherd and one fold for all mankind  One faith one baptism one LORD and CHRIST  But I perhaps too bold offend thine ear  With my rude converse Lord if so command  My tongue to silence yet not in thy wrath  Not in thy wrath O Lord reprove my zeal  Whereto the Savior mildly thus replied  O Abraham in whose soul compassion glows  And love that burns with zeal for all thy sons  Nor for thy sons alone but the whole world  Whose advocate thou art think not the tongue  That speaks for mercy can offend my ear  Yet what thy zeal anticipates in time  Is distant far ages must roll betwixt  Thy hope and its completion threat'ning clouds  Lour on the glorious prospect seas of blood  Must first be pass'd long pilgrimage and sad  My martyrs have to make through vallies dark  Where ign'rance shades the sun through frightful haunts  Where superstition pictures out the scene  In monstrous forms and worships what it dreads  Painful their march and round beset with snares  Here treach'ry lurks there persecution flames  Before them infidelity behind  Reproach and slander and the roar of tongues  Contentious urging them to turn from God  And waste their nobler zeal in vain dispute  Thus step by step in righteousness and faith  Arm'd at all points my servants militant  Shall win their way and what they earn enjoy  Lowly and meek I came into the world  And meek and lowly I shall now return  Not with that glory rising from the grave  Which for my second coming is reserv'd  But in that mortal body which they pierc'd  Shewing my wounds not with the proud display  Of one who courts the voice of public fame  But communing apart with those I left  To be my witnesses that so through them  Men may be taught by reason to discern  Not what they must but what they should believe  Not by the evidence of sense to feel  But by the mind's conviction to perceive  Truth in it's argument not act and build  On reason not necessity their faith  And on their faith and their good works their hope  God will not always struggle with mankind  Heap proof on proof till incredulity  Though blind must see though deaf of force must hear  He will not bring his heav'n upon the earth  Rather will lead man's heart from earthly things  To reach at heavenly the railing Jews  Who fix'd me to the cross bade me come down  And with the sign of pow'r dispel their doubts  So had I frustrated all faith at once  And with all faith all virtue I was dumb  I open'd not my mouth to their reproach  I stirr'd not from the cross I died the death  Nor to my rescue brought one Angel down  Though legions waited to obey my call  And now none other sign will I vouchsafe  But of the prophet Jonas for as he  From out the belly of the whale emerg'd  On the third day so I from out the tomb  In the same body will come forth on earth  With the third morning's dawn thus shall the word  Of prophecy by my disciples heard  Not understood be perfected in me  And I will breathe my spi'rit into their hearts  To comprehend all scriptures and to preach  Me crucified nor shall there be a dearth  Of witnesses to publish and attest  My resurrection hundreds shall behold  My substance in the flesh and he that doubts  Shall touch me and believe More to expound  There needs not this in all your ears aloud  I now promulgate that when I am gone  Ye may abide the interim in peace  By terror or impatience undisturb'd  And now not many are the days to pass  Ere to the heav'n of heav'ns I shall ascend  And there in blest communion with my Saints  Made perfect after death for ever dwell  At the right hand of Pow'r meanwhile the seed  Which I have sown though of all grains the least  Yet water'd by the Comforter shall grow  Of herbs the greatest and become a tree  Within whose branches all the birds of air  Shall come and lodge so shall my kingdom rise  From mean beginning into mighty growth  A still small current spreading as it goes  For in the arm of man I place no strength  Nor in the battle's thunder can be heard  His voice that preacheth peace to storm the ear  Like those loud heathen orators who shake  The forum with their eloquence ill suits  The servants of a Master little vers'd  In this world's wisdom and not vain of speech  In love in calm persuasion and in peace  My gospel I have planted Woe to them  Who in the place of these sweet fruits provoke  The baneful growth of persecution strife  And discord in my Church op'ning my wounds  Unheal'd and crucifying me afresh  To him the Patriarch Lord we give thee thanks  For that thou hast imparted to thy saints  These tidings of great joy though distant far  And through such clouds of sorrow dimly seen  And sure we are thy gospel shall prevail  Yet much do we lament for what thy saints  And martyrs have to suffer upon earth  Foil'd by that first Deceiver of mankind  Who though now bruis'd and for awhile enchain'd  Shall yet come forth to vex thy holy Church  To conjure up false prophets and pervert  Thy follo'wers who are taught to live in peace  And charity with all men But we know  God did not build this goodly frame of things  For SATAN to destroy and he and Death  Shall have an end Heav'n is man's natural home  And righteousness the impulse of his heart  Nor will God fail his promise that in me  And in my seed the whole world shall be blest  Ah when shall I behold that promis'd day  When shall I see the warring world at peace  When shall my Israel scatter'd o'er the earth  And straggling wide hear their good Shepherd's call  And come into his fold Sure that blest voice  That glorious vision would be heav'n itself  That vision thou shalt see the LORD replied  And smil'd allgracious on th' enraptur'd Saint  From this prospective mount with purged eye  That through the length'ning tract of time discerns  Futurity remote thou shalt behold  Th' Apocalypse which to no living eye  Save of my servant John I shall disclose  But know ere this blest period shall arrive  The elements must melt with fervent heat  And earth and sea and heav'n must pass away  Darkness and sin and death shall be no more  And a new world shine forth Ascend the mount  And eastward turning tell me what thou see'st  I see the Patriarch cried an heaven and earth  Earth without sea and heav'n without a cloud  All bright and glist'ning from the Maker's hands  I see descending from the throne of God  Jerusalem the Holy City new  Deck'd like a bride for her celestial spouse  Order and grace and symmetry conspire  In all her parts and with the rich display  Of vivid gems make glorious her attire  To the four points of heav'n in equal span  She stretches out her manycolour'd walls  Celestial masonry whose meanest stone  More rare and precious than the brightest gem  Of earthly diadems transparent flames  From the foundations to the topmost cope  Of mural battlement one dazzling blaze  Of glorious jewelry and them amidst  On every flank quadrangular three gates  Each of an orient pearl to our twelve tribes  By number and by name appropriate  Stand open guarded by Cherubic watch  Through whose unfolded portals I descry  A city all of purest gold and clear  As the unclouded crystal on whose towers  God's allsufficient glory sheds a flood  Of radiance brighter than the borrow'd beam  Of shadowy moon or sun oft wrapt in clouds  Making alternate night and day on earth  But night is here unknown day needeth not  To rest in darkness nor the eye in sleep  Nor temple here for worship may be found  The everpresent Deity demands  No house of pray'r in ev'ry heart is built  His altar every voice records his praise  And every saint his minister and priest  Through the midstreet a crystal river flows  Pellucid welling from the throne of God  It's living source upon whose border springs  The tree of life bearing ambrosial fruits  Monthly renew'd and varied through the year  Food for immortals in whose balmy gum  And leaves medicinal a virtue dwells  So general and potential that no pain  Or ailment but here finds it's ready cure  No tear shall wet this consecrated soil  Nor feud nor clamor nor unholy curse  Disturb these peaceful echoes here the saints  In sweet harmonious brotherhood shall dwell  Serene and perfect in the sight of God  And hark I hear seraphic voices chaunt  To their melodious harps the bridal hymn  Now is our God espoused to his Church  And from their heav'nly union are gone forth  Blessing and peace and joy to all mankind  Now shall his saints eternal Sabbath keep  From death and pain and wailing and complaint  All is made new the old is pass'd away  Time draws aside the faded scene of things  And Nature in immortal freshness blooms  Now to the waters of the fount of life  Perpetual waters every soul may come  And he that is athirst may freely drink  But fire and brimstone in the burning lake  Shall be their portion who revolt from God  There with the Beast in torments they shall dwell  Seal'd in their foreheads with his mark and drink  The cup of indignation to the dregs  Wrung out in anger whilst their ceaseless cry  Shall with the smoke of the infernal pit  Day after day for evermore ascend  No more for now the heav'nly vision clos'd  Awaken'd from his trance the Patriarch turn'd  With grateful reverence to address the LORD  And giver of these newdiscover'd joys  When lo ascending from the mount he saw  CHRIST in a cloud of glory on the wings  Of mighty Cherubim upborne in air  Highsoaring to this orb terraqueous bound  Seen overhead diminish'd to a point  Dim and opake amid the blue serene  His raiment whiter than the newborn light  Struck out of chaos by the Maker's hand  In earnest of creation sparkling blaz'd  In it's swift motion and with fiery track  Mark'd his ascent to earth the host of Saints  With joyful loud hosannas fill'd the air  Glory to God on high was all their strain  On the earth peace goodwill to all mankind  Meanwhile th' Archangel GABRIEL who yet kept  His tutelary station on the mount  So bidd'n of CHRIST with arm outstretch'd and voice  Commanding silence thus the Saints bespake  Now is your resurrection sure your joy  Your glory and your triumph over Death  And hell made perfect for behold where CHRIST  Your firstfruit is aris'n and waves on high  The ensign of redemption now he soars  Up to yon pendent world that darkling speck  Which in the boundless empyrean floats  Pois'd on it's whirling axle there he liv'd  And took your mortal body there he died  And for your sakes endur'd the painful cross  Giving his blood a ransom for your sins  Thither he goes to reassume his flesh  There when his angel ministers have op'd  The sealed sepulchre he shall come forth  And shew himself resurgent from the grave  To those whom he hath sanctified and call'd  To be his witnesses in all the world  And of his resurrection after death  Their faithful evidence to seal with blood  Of martyrs and apostles warning men  With their last breath to be baptiz'd and live  So shall the seed be water'd and increase  Till all the Gentile nations shall come in  And dwell beneath it's branches evermore  Now are the gates of everlasting life  Set open to mankind and when the LORD  Captain of their salvation shall have liv'd  His promis'd term on earth and thence to heav'n  Ascending seat himself at God's right hand  Then shall the Holy Ghost the Comforter  Rush like a mighty wind upon the hearts  Of his inspir'd apostles tongues of fire  And languages untaught they shall receive  To speak with boldness the revealed Word  Enduring all things for the gospel's sake  Troubled on ev'ry side yet not distress'd  Perplex'd but not surrender'd to despair  Afflicted not forsaken they shall be  Cast down but not destroy'd knowing that God  Who raised the LORD JESUS from the dead  Them also into life through him will raise  And that the light affliction of this world  Which is but for a moment soon shall be  O'erpaid by a far more exceeding weight  Of glory' eternal in the life to come  He ceas'd and all were silent wrapt in awe  Of the late glorious vision yet in heart  Troubled for what the Angel had reveal'd  Of sorrows still to come and pains and deaths  To be encounter'd by the Saints on earth  When now that Shepherd who on Sinai's mount  Commun'd with God and heard creation's plan  Expounded by it's Architect thus spake  Oh thou whom through the fiery cloud I saw  On Horeb's hill when tending Jethro's flock  What time I heard my name twice call'd of God  In thunder from amidst the flaming bush  Bidding me strait go forth to loose his sheep  From Egypt's captive fold I do perceive  That I have penn'd the Word of God aright  And now in CHRIST behold the woman's seed  Bruising that Serpent's head who wrought the fall  Of our first parents Forty days and nights  On Sinai's top 'midst thund'rings clouds and fire  Fasting I stood and whilst the hallow'd ground  Trembled beneath my bare unsandal'd feet  I heard an awful voice that bade me write  The glorious record of his six days work  Aghast confounded dazzled with the blaze  Of glory still my faithful pen obey'd  The sacred dictates of an unseen God  I wrote and to an unbelieving world  Publish'd the wond'rous Code age after age  Libell'd the transcript With the rod of pow'r  I smote the seas asunder Israel pass'd  Through wat'ry battlements forty long years  In the waste howling wilderness I fed  Their murmuring tribes with food miraculous  They fed but murmur'd still I brought them laws  With God's own finger graven I came down  Bearing Jehovah's statutes in my hand  On both sides written impious noisy shouts  Lewd triumphs and vile revels smote mine ear  The people danc'd around a molten calf  Monstrous idolatry Raging with shame  I dash'd the stony tablets on the ground  And shiver'd them to fragments God was mock'd  A stiffneck'd and a stubborn race they were  Who from the rock of their salvation turn'd  And sacrific'd to devils and behold  Their sons have crucified the LORD OF LIFE  Therefore his resurrection which shall be  Light and redemption to the Gentile world  To them is darkness and the shadow' of death  For they have slain the very Paschal Lamb  That bloody symbol of their antient law  Which I made sacred they have now made void  And cancell'd my legation I perceive  A new commandment is gone forth I see  The temple's vail is rent for the old law  A carnal shadow of things spiritual  Suffic'd not for perfection and the pow'r  Of an eternal life CHRIST is become  That King of Salem that immortal Priest  Of God most high whose ministry supreme  Before all time from heav'n itself deriv'd  And not from right Levitical removes  All title from that consecrated tribe  Where I had fix'd it God who sending me  Sent but his servant now hath giv'n his Son  More worthy of his glory without sin  And spotless He the great High Priest hath pass'd  Into the heav'ns victorious over Death  But I whose trespasses at Meribah  Frail sinful man provok'd the Lord to wrath  Saw but the skirts of Dan from Pisgah's top  Unworthy deem'd to enter that fair land  And died upon mount Nebo But when CHRIST  Who hath awaken'd us from sleep shall rise  And in his mortal flesh a second time  Visit his Saints on earth who then shall say  There is no resurrection of the dead  Faintly I shadow'd forth a future life  I spake not to men's senses as CHRIST speaks  God gave me no commission to reveal  The secrets of the grave corruption's worm  Spar'd not my flesh nor came my spirit back  From Death's dark citadel to give mankind  Conviction ocular of his defeat  I left him in his power till CHRIST should come  To break that sceptre which had aw'd the world  Much then it moves my wonder much I grieve  That darkness shall not yet be drawn aside  From Israel and that those who would not hear  Me and the prophets shall not yet believe  CHRIST their Messias rising from the dead  To whom th' Archangel answer'd heav'nly mild  Well may'st thou muse that reas'ning man should doubt  And cause we have to grieve when he neglects  So great salvation but when CHRIST hath shewn  What is the good and true and perfect way  Reason must do the rest When all are free  Some must be faithless wilful and perverse  God could have made his creatures void of sin  For he can put a master in their hearts  And govern them by instinct but to man  He gave a nobler faculty a will  A spark of immortality a soul  Reason to counsel that immortal soul  And conscience to restrain licentious will  Grace shall assist the humble and devout  A proud man hath no friend in heav'n or earth  Renounc'd of angels and by men abhorr'd  Truth must be sought it will not be impos'd  What were that revelation which should leave  No exercise to faith All men must work  With fear and trembling their salvation out  God does not give free will to take away  What he hath giv'n if man will sin he must  Nor do we call them good who cannot err  Else brutes would claim a virtue None is good  Save God alone impute we not to God  The evil which man does nor him arraign  For not preventing ills which he foreknows  Angels have sinn'd and some are fall'n from bliss  All had their days of error their degrees  Of good and ill else why have we degrees  Ranks and precedencies of bliss in heav'n  Call your own lives to mind ye have been men  Your failings many yet your virtues more  Why are ye now rewarded by your God  Why but because those virtues were your own  Ye made them what they were ye rear'd their growth  Reason reform'd the wild luxuriant soil  Pluck'd up the weeds and nurs'd the glorious fruit  Is there amongst you one that hath to boast  Human perfection There is none that will  A free yet faultless creature would be more  Than man than angel nor can God create  An equal to himself a rival God  In Eden's happy groves when man was plac'd  One interdicted baneful plant there was  Tempting and rich in fruit all else was good  Fair to the eye and wholesome to the taste  Yet of that fruit man pluck'd and eat and died  Tempted he was but not compell'd to take  Warn'd to abstain no angel stopp'd his hand  No thundering voice deterr'd him from the deed  For man was free so could he not have been  Had God's foreknowledge overrul'd his will  Thus Sin had origin and Death began  His occupation with the human race  More terrible for that he came with pangs  Horrors and doubts on sinoppressed man  When conscience wrung him in the parting hour  But still the inextinguishable soul  Mock'd at Death's dart the body was his own  From the beginning of the earth 'twas made  The earth it till'd and from the earth it fed  A tenement of dust was never form'd  Fox immortality and now behold  Adam the earthy man in whom all die  Is buried to the world redemption brings  The dayspring of Salvation from on high  CHRIST in his glory comes the LORD from heav'n  And who in him have faith in him have life  He ceas'd when now th' assembly of the Saints  Who whilst he spake stood in their orbs unmov'd  Circling the mount 'gan feel the Spi'rit of God  Descending on their hearts and like a sea  By secret currents from it's bottom stirr'd  Wav'd to and fro their undulating files  Wide and more wide as with a mighty wind  The heav'nly inspiration on them rush'd  This GABRIEL heard and from the mount came down  Which quak'd beneath his feet whilst overhead  Loud thunderings announc'd the coming God  And now a fire that cover'd all the mount  Bespoke him present all the air respir'd  Ambrosial odours amaranth and rose  For Nature felt her God and every flower  And every fragrant shrub whose honied breath  Perfumes the courts of heav'n had burst to life  Blooming and in a thousand colors dy'd  Threw their gay mantle o'er the naked heath  Now glow'd the living landscape hill and dale  Rose on the flat or sunk as Nature shap'd  Her loveliest forms and swell'd her wavey line  Leaving unrein'd variety to run  Her wild career amid the sportive scene  Nor were there wanting trees of ev'ry growth  Umbrageous some making a verdant tent  Under their spreading branches some of shaft  Majestic tow'ring o'er the subject groves  Blossoms and fruits and aromatic gums  Scented the breeze that fann'd their rustling leaves  And them betwixt a crystal river flow'd  O'er golden sands meand'ring in it's course  Through amaranthine banks with lulling sound  Of dulcet murmurs breathing soft repose  Thus at the sight of God spontaneous rose  A Paradise within the realm of Death  Where that blest congregation might abide  Their LORD's return now visitant on earth  And now th' Eternal having breath'd his joy  Into their hearts and giv'n them to discern  All knowledge that befitted souls so blest  Withdrew his presence from the flaming mount  Whereat the min'istring Angel who beheld  Salvation's work complete thus parting spake  God in whose presence pleasure ever dwells  Hath for your dear Redeemer's sake bestow'd  These joys and now his presence is withdrawn  Yet hath he left his spirit in your hearts  To teach you all that is and is to be  Behold the cloud that veil'd your mortal eyes  Is drawn aside and what as in a glass  Darkling ye saw now face to face is seen  Ye now discern the ways of God how just  How true how wise how perfect in design  And well ye know that man presumptuous man  In a vain shadow walketh ye perceive  His boasted mind sufficient for the things  That to his own salvation appertain  Yet when it scans the mysteries of heaven  How false how weak how daringly absurd  Firm faith warm charity and humble hope  These are the Christian graces these the guides  That lead to life eternal thoughts perverse  Pert quibbling follies publish'd in the pride  Of false philosophy are dev'lish arts  That damn the instrument who thus attempts  To hide the light of revelation's beam  From weaker eyes and turn the world from God  These verily shall have their just reward  And now no more this Paradise ye see  Is but your passage to a brighter scene  A restingplace till CHRIST shall reascend  To the right hand of God and call you hence  To share his glory in the heav'n of heavens  He said and swifter than the meteor's glance  Sprung on the wing to seek his native sphere  The Saints look'd up then sung with joint acclaim  Glory to God and praises to his CHRIST  Judge and Redeemer of the quick and dead  END OF THE POEM
