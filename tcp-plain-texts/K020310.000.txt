ruff'd up like good Queen  Bess  They are forsooth too much expos'd and free  Were more expos'd no ill Effects I see  For more or less 'tis all the same to me  Poor Gaming too was mauld among the rest  That precious Cordial to a highlife Breast  When Thoughts arise I always game or drink  An  English  Gentleman shou'd never think  The Reason's plain which ev'ry Soul might hit on  What  trims  a  Frenchman oversets  a  Briton  In us Reflection breeds a sober Sadness  Which always ends in Politicks or Madness  I therefore now proposeby your Command  That Tragedies no more shall cloud this Land

twoand  Woodward's  Pantomimes  The Author of the Prologue and Epilogue would not have publish'd them had it not been customary to print them with the Play He is very sensible that they can have little or no Merit in the Reading their Effect wholly depending upon the Characters which speak them and the Novelty of introducing them They were likewise written at a very short Warning for the Author of the Play had not provided these usual and therefore necessary Parts of the Performance which Mr GARRICK thought proper to provide at all Events  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  BARBAROSSA  Mr  Mossop

ATTENDANTS and SLAVES  SCENE  the Royal Palace of  ALGIERS TIME  a few Hours about Midnight  ADVERTISEMENT  "TRAGEDY as it was anciently composed hath been ever held the gravest moralest and most profitable of all other Poems Hence Philosophers and other gravest Writers as  Cicero Plutarch  and others frequently cite out of Tragic Poets both to adorn and illustrate their Discourse The Apostle  Paul  himself thought it not unworthy to insert a Verse of  a Greek Poet  into the Text of Holy ScriptureHeretofore Men in highest Dignity have laboured not a little to be thought able to compose a Tragedy Of that Honour  Dionysius  the Elder was no less ambitious than before of his attaining to the Tyranny  Augustus Caesar  also had begun his  Ajax  but unable to please his own Judgment left it unfinished  Sencca  the Philosopher is by some thought the Author of those Tragedies at least the best of them that go under that Name  Gregory Nazianzen  a Father of the Church thought it not unbeseeming the Sanctity of his Person to write a Tragedy which is intitled  Christ Suffering  This is mentioned to  vindicate Tragedy  from the small Esteem or rather Infamy which in the Account of many it undergoes at this Day"  So sar the great  Milton  who strengthen'd these Examples by  his own  The Author hath nothing more to add save only that he hath aimed to write this Piece in its  essential Parts  according to the Model of ancient Tragedy so far as modern Ideas and Manners wou'd permit And he is so gratefully senssble of that favourable Reception it hath met with from the Public that in every future Attempt he will assuredly labour to merit their farther Regarcs by keeping in his Eye the same great Originals  BARBAROSSA  ACT  Enter  OTHMAN  and a  SLAVE  OTHMAN  _A Stranger say'st thou that inquires of OTHMAN  SLAVE  He does and waits Admittance  OTHMAN  Did he tell  His Name and Quality  SLAVE  That he declined  But call'd himself thy Friend  OTHMAN  Where didst thou see him  SLAVE  Ev'n now while Twilight clos'd the Day I spy'd him  Musing amid' the Ruins of yon Tow'r  That overhangs the Flood On my Approach  With Aspect stern and Words of Import dark  He question'd me of OTHMAN Then the Tear  Stole from his Eye But when I talk'd of Pow'r  And courtly Honours here conferr'd on thee  His Frown grew darker All I wish'd he cry'd  Is to confer with him and then to die  OTHMAN  What may this meanConduct the Stranger to me  Exit Slave  Perhaps some worthy Citizen return'd  From voluntary Exile to ALGIERS  Once known in happier Days  Enter  SADI  Ah SADI here  My honor'd Friend  SADI  Stand offpollute me not  These honest Arms tho' worn with Want disdain  Thy gorgeous Trappings earn'd by foul Dishonour  OTHMAN  Forbear thy rash Reproaches for beneath  This Habit which to thy mistaken Eye  Bespeaks my Guilt I wear a Heart as true  As SADI's to my King  SADI  Why then beneath  This cursed Roof this black Usurper's Palace  Dar'st thou to draw infected Air and live  The Slave of Insolence Why lick the Dust  Beneath his Feet who laid ALGIERS in Ruin  But Age which shou'd have taught thee honest Caution  Has taught thee Treachery  OTHMAM  Mistaken Man  Cou'd Passion prompt me to licentious Speech  Like thine  SADI  Peace false one Peace The Slave to Pow'r  Still wears a pliant TongueO Shame to dwell  With Murder Lust and RapineDid he not  Come from the Depths of BARCA's Solitude  With fair Pretence of Faith and firm Alliance  Did not our grateful King with open Arms  Receive him as his Guest O fatal Hour  Did he not then with hot adult'rous Eye  Gaze on the Queen ZAPHIRA Yes 'twas Lust  Lust gave th' infernal Whisper to his Soul  And bade him Murder if he wou'd enjoy  O complicated Horrors hellborn Treach'ry  Then fell our Country when good SELIM dy'd  Yet thou pernicious Traitor unabash'd  Can'st wear the Murd'rer's Badge  OTHMAN  Yet hear me SADI  SADI  What can Dishonour plead  OTHMAN  Yet blame not Prudence  SADI  Prudence the stale Pretence of ev'ry Knave  The Traitor's ready Mask  OTHMAN  Yet still I love thee  Yet unprovok'd by thy intemperate Zeal  Bethink theemight I not insult thy Flight  With the Foul Names of Fear or Perfidy  Didst thou not fly when BARBAROSSA's Sword  Reek'd with the Blood of thy brave Countrymen  What then did IBeneath this hated Roof  In Pity to my widow'd Queen  SADI  In Pity  OTHMAN  Yes SADI Heav'n is Witness Pity sway'd me  SADI  Words Words Dissimulation all and Guilt  OTHMAN  With honest Guile I did inroll my Name  In the black List of BARBAROSSA's Friends  In hope that some propitious Hour might rise  When Heav'n would dash the Murd'rer from his Throne  And give young SELIM to his orphan'd People  SADI  Indeed can'st thou be true  OTHMAN  By Heav'n I am  SADI  Why then dissemble thus  OTHMAN  Have I not told thee  I held it vain to stem the Tyrant's Pow'r  By the weak Sallies of an illtim'd Rage  SADI  Enough I find thee honest And with Pride  Will join thy Councils This my faithful Arm  Wasted with Misery shall gain new Nerves  For brave Resolves Can aught my Friend be done  Can aught be dar'd  OTHMAN  We groan beneath the Scourge  This very Morn on false Pretence of Vengeance  For the foul Murder of our honor'd King  Five guiltless Wretches perish'd on the Rack  Our longlov'd Friends and bravest Citizens  Selfbanish'd to the Desart mourn in Exile  While the fell Tyrant lords it o'er a Crew  Of abject Sycophants the needy Tools  Of Pow'r usurp'd and a degen'rate Train  Of Slaves in Arms  SADI  O my devoted Country  But say the widow'd Queenmy Heart bleeds for her  OTHMAN  If Pain be Life she lives But in such Woe  As Want and Slavery might view with Pity  And bless their happier Lot Hemm'd round by Terrors  Within this cruel Palace once the Seat  Of ev'ry Joy thro' sev'n long tedious Years  She weeps her murder'd Lord her exil'd Son  Her People fall'n the Murd'rer of her Lord  Returning now from Conquest o'er the MOORS  Tempts her to Marriage spurr'd at once by Lust  And black Ambition But with noble Firmness  Surpassing the female she rejects his Vows  Scorning the horrid Union Meantime he  With ceaseless Hate pursues her exil'd Son  AndOh detested Monster  He weeps  SADI  Yet more Deeds  Of Cruelty Just Heaven  OTHMAN  His Rage pursues  The virtuous Youth ev'n into foreign Climes  Ere this perhaps he bleeds A murd'ring Ruffian  Is sent to watch his Steps and plunge the Dagger  Into his guiltless Breast  SADI  Is this thy Faith  Tamely to witness to such Deeds of Horror  Give me thy Poignard lead me to the Tyrant  What tho' surrounding Guards  OTHMAN  Repress thy Fury  Thou wilt alarm the Palace wilt involve  Thyself thy Friend in Ruin Haste thee hence  Haste to the Remnant of our loyal Friends  And let maturer Councils rule thy Zeal  SADI  Yet let us ne'er forget our Prince's Wrongs  Remember OTHMAN and let Vengeance rise  How in the Pangs of Death and in his Gore  Welt'ring we found our Prince The deadly Dagger  Deep in his Heart was fix'd His royal Blood  The Lifeblood of his People o'er the Bath  Ran purple O remember and revenge  OTHMAN  Doubt not my Zeal But haste and seek our Friends  Near to the western Port ALMANZOR dwells  Yet unseduc'd by BARBAROSSA's Pow'r  He will disclose to thee if aught be heard  Of SELIM's Safety or what more I dread  Of SELIM's Death Thence best may our Resolves  Be drawn hereafter But let Caution guide thee  For in these Walks where Tyranny and Guilt  Usurp the Throne wakeful Suspicion dwells  And squintey'd Jealousy prone to pervert  Ev'n Looks and Smiles to Treason  SADI  I obey thee  Near to the western Port thou say'st  OTHMAN  Ev'n there  Close by the blasted Palmtree where the Mosque  O'erlooks the City Haste thee hence my Friend  I wou'd not have thee found within these Walls  Flourish  And harkthese warlike Sounds proclaim th' Approach  Of the proud BARBAROSSA with his Train  Begone  SADI  May dire Disease and Pestilence  Hang o'er his StepsFarewelRemember OTHMAN  Thy Queen's thy Prince's and thy Country's Wrongs  Exit  SADI  OTHMAN  When I forget them be Contempt my Lot  Yet for the Love I bear them I must wrap  My deep Resentments in the specious Guise  Of Smiles and fair Deportment  Enter  BARBAROSSA  Guards  c  BARBAROSSA  Valiant OTHMAN  Are these vile Slaves impal'd  OTHMAN  My Lord they are  BARBAROSSA  Did not the Rack extort Confession from them  OTHMAN  They dy'd obdurate while the melting Crowd  Murmur'd out Pity for their Groans and Anguish  BARBAROSSA  Curse on their womanish Hearts what pity Slaves  Whom my supreme Decree condemn'd to Torture  Are you not all my Slaves to whom my Nod  Gives Life or Death  OTHMAN  To doubt thy Will is Treason  BARBAROSSA  I love thee faithful OTHMAN But why sits  That Sadness on thy Brow For oft' I find thee  Musing and sad while Joy for my Return  My Sword victorious and the MOOR to'erthrown  Resounds thro' all my Palace  OTHMAN  Mighty Warrior  The Soul intent on Offices of Love  Will oft' neglect or scorn the weaker Proof  Which Smiles or Speech can give  BARBAROSSA  Well Be it so  To guard ALGIERS from Anarchy's Misrule  I sway the regal Scepter Who deserves  Shall meet Protection And who merits not  Shall meet my Wrath in ThunderBut 'tis strange  That when with open Arms I wou'd receive  Young SELIM wou'd restore the Crown which Death  Reft from his Father's HeadHe scorns my Bounty  Shuns me with sullen and obdurate Hate  And proudly kindles War in foreign Climes  Against my Power who sav'd his bleeding Country  OTHMAN  'Tis strange indeed  Enter  ALADIN  ALADIN  Brave Prince I bring thee Tydings  Of high Concernment to ALGIERS and Thee  Young SELIM is no more  OTHMAN  Indeed  BARBAROSSA  Indeedwhy that Astonishment  He was our bitterest Foe  OTHMAN  So perish all  Thy causeless Enemies  BARBAROSSA  What says the Rumour  How dy'd the Prince and where  ALADIN  The Rumour tells  That flying to ORAN he there begg'd Succours  From FERDINAND of SPAIN t'invade ALGIERS  BARBAROSSA  From Christian Dogs  OTHMAN  How league with Infidels  ALADIN  And there held Council with the haughty SPANIARD  To conquer and dethrone thee But in vain  For in a dark Encounter with two Slaves  Wherein the one fell by his dauntless Valour  SELIM at length was slain  BARBAROSSA  Ungrateful Boy  Oft' have I courted him to meet my Kindness  But still in vain he shun'd me like a Pestilence  Nor cou'd I e'er behold him since the Down  Cover'd his manly CheekHow many Years  Number'd he  OTHMAN  I think scarce thirteen when his Father dy'd  And now some twenty  BARBAROSSA  OTHMAN now for Proof  Of undissembled ServiceWell I know  Thy longexperienc'd Faith hath plac'd thee high  In the Queen's Confidence The Crown I wear  Yet totters on my Head till MarriageRites  Have made her mine OTHMAN she must be won  Plead thou my Cause of Love Bid her dry up  Her fruitless Tears Paint forth her long Delays  Wake all thy Eloquence Make her but mine  And such unsought Reward shall crown thy Zeal  As shall outsoar thy Wishes  OTHMAN  Mighty King  Where Duty bids I go  BARBAROSSA  Then haste thee OTHMAN  Ere yet the Rumour of her Son's Decease  Hath reach'd her Ear ere yet the mournful Tale  Hath whelm'd her in a new Abyss of Woe  And quench'd all soft Affection save for him  Tell her I come borne on the Wings of Love  HasteflyI follow thee  Exit  OTHMAN  Now ALADIN  Now Fortune bears us to the wish'dfor Port  We ride secure on her most prosp'rous Billow  This was the Rock I dreaded Dost not think  Th' Attempt was greatly daring  ALADIN  Ay and necessary  What booted it to cut the old Serpent off  While the young Adder nested in his Place  BARBAROSSA  True We have conquer'd now ALGIERS is mine  Without a Rival Thus great Souls aspire  And boldly snatch at Crowns beyond the Reach  Of coward ConscienceYet I wonder much  OMAR returns not OMAR whom I sent  On this high Trust I fear 'tis he hath fal'n  Didst thou not say two Slaves encounter'd SELIM  ALADIN  Ay two 'tis rumour'd so  BARBAROSSA  And that one fell  ALADIN  Ev'n so By SELIM's Hand while his Companion  Planted his happier Steel in SELIM's Heart  BARBAROSSA  OMAR I fear is fal'n From my RightHand  I gave my Signet to the trusty Slave  And bade him send it as the certain Pledge  Of SELIM's Death if Sickness or Captivity  Or wayward Fate shou'd thwart his quick Return  ALADIN  The Rumour yet is young perhaps foreruns  The trusty Slave's Approach  BARBAROSSA  We'll wait th' Event  Meantime give out that now the widow'd Queen  Hath dry'd her Tears prepar'd to crown my Love  By MarriageRites Spread wide the flatt'ring Tale  For if Persuasion win not her Consent  Pow'r shall compel  ALADIN  It is indeed a Thought  Which Prudence whispers  BARBAROSSA  Thou brave ALADIN  Hast been the firm Companion of my Deeds  Soon shall my Friendship's Warmth reward thy Faith  This Night my Will devotes to Feast and Joy  For Conquest o'er the MOOR Hence ALADIN  And see the NightWatch close the Palace round  Exit  ALADIN  Now to the Queen My Heart expands with Hope  Let high Ambition flourish In SELIM's Blood  Its Root is struck From this the rising Stem  Proudly shall branch o'er AFRIC's Continent  And stretch from Shore to Shore  Enter  IRENE  What drown'd in Tears still with thy Folly thwart  Each purpose of my Soul When Pleasures spring  Beneath our Feet thou spurn'st the proffer'd Boon  To dwell with SorrowWhy these sullen Tears  IRENE  Let not these Tears offend my Father's Eye  They are the Tears of Pity From the Queen  I come thy Suppliant  BARBAROSSA  On some rude Request  What wou'dst thou urge  IRENE  Thy dread Return from War  And proffer'd Love have open'd ev'ry Wound  The soft and lenient Hand of Time had clos'd  If ever gentle Pity touch'd thy Heart  Now let it melt Urge not thy harsh Command  To see her Her distracted Soul is bent  To mourn in Solitude She asks no more  BARBAROSSA  She mocks my Love How many tedious Years  Have I endur'd her Coyness Had not War  And great Ambition call'd me from ALGIERS  Ere this my Pow'r had reap'd what she denies  But there's a Cause which touches on my Peace  And bids me brook no more her false Delays  IRENE  O frown not thus Sure Pity ne'er deserv'd  A Parent's Frown Then look more kindly on me  Let thy consenting Pity mix with mine  And heal the Woes of weeping Majesty  Unhappy Queen  BARBAROSSA  What means that gushing Tear  IRENE  Oh never shall IRENE taste of Peace  While poor ZAPHIRA mourns  BARBAROSSA  Is this my Child  Perverse and stubbornAs thou lov'st thy Peace  Dry up thy Tears What damp the general Triumph  That echoes through ALGIERS which now shall pierce  The vaulted Heav'n as soon as Fame shall spread  Young SELIM's Death my Empire's bitterest Foe  IRENE  O generous SELIM  BARBAROSSA  Ah There's more in this  Tell me IRENE On thy Duty tell me  As thou dost wish I wou'd not cast thee off  With an incensed Father's Curses on thee  Now tell me why at this detested Name  Afresh thy Sorrow streams  IRENE  Yes I will tell thee  For he is gone and dreads thy Hate no more  My Father knows that scarce five Moons are past  Since the MOORS seiz'd and sold me at ORAN  A hopeless Captive in a foreign Clime  BARBAROSSA  Too well I know and rue the fatal Day  But what of this  IRENE  Why shou'd I tell what Horrors  Did then beset my SoulOft' have I told thee  How 'midst the Throng a Youth appear'd His Eye  Bright as the Morning Star  BARBAROSSA  And was it SELIM  Did he redeem thee  IRENE  With unsparing Hand  He paid th' allotted Ransom And o'crbade  Av'rice and Appetite At his Feet I wept  Dissolv'd in Tears of Gratitude and Joy  But when I told my Quality and Birth  He started at the Name of BARBAROSSA  And thrice turn'd pale Yet with Recovery mild  Go to ALGIERS he cry'd protect my Mother  And be to Her what SELIM is to Thee  Ev'n such my Father was the gen'rous Youth  Who by the Hands of bloody bloody Men  Lies number'd with the dead  BARBAROSSA  Amazement chills me  Was this thy unknown Friend conceal'd from me  False faithless Child  IRENE  Cou'd Gratitude do less  He said thy Hate pursu'd him thence conjur'd me  Not to reveal his Name  BARBAROSSA  Thou treacherous Maid  To stoop to Freedom from thy Father's Foe  IRENE  Alas my Father  He never was thy Foe  BARBAROSSA  Whatplead for SELIM  Away He merited the Death he found  Oh Coward Traitress to thy Father's Glory  Thou shou'dst have liv'd a Slavebeen sold to Shame  Been banish'd to the Depth of howling Desarts  Been aught but what thou art rather than blot  A Father's Honour by a Deed so vile  Hence from my SightHence thou unthankful Child  Beware thee Shun the Queen nor taint her Ear  With SELIM's Fate Yes she shall crown my Love  Or by our Prophet she shall dread my Pow'r  Exit  BARBAROSSA  IRENE  Unhappy Queen  To what new Scenes of Horror art thou doom'd  O cruel Father Hapless Child whom Pity  Compels to call him cruelGen'rous SELIM  Poor injur'd Queen who but intreats to die  In her dear Father's Tents Thither good Queen  My Care shall speed thee while Suspicion sleeps  What tho' my frowning Father pour his Rage  On my defenceless Head Yet Innocence  Shall yield her firm Support and conscious Virtue  Gild all my Days Cou'd I but save ZAPHIRA  Let the Storm beat I'll weep and pray till she  And Heav'n forget my Father e'er was

Pow'r  Unchain'd thee from thy native Depth of Hell  To stalk the Earth with thy destructive Train  Murder and Lust to waste domestic Peace  And ev'ry Heartfelt Joy  Enter  OTHMAN  O faithful OTHMAN  Our Fears were true My SELIM is no more  OTHMAN  Has then the fatal Story reach'd thine Ear  Inhuman Tyrant  ZAPHIRA  Strike him Heav'n with Thunder  Nor let ZAPHIRA doubt thy Providence  OTHMAN  'Twas what we fear'd Accuse not Heav'n's high Will  Nor struggle with the tenfold Chain of Fate  That links thee to thy Woes O rather yield  And wait the happier Hour when Innocence  Shall weep no more Rest in that pleasing Hope  And yield thyself to Heav'nMy honor'd Queen  The King  ZAPHIRA  Whom stil'st thou King  OTHMAN  'Tis BARBAROSSA  He means to see thee  ZAPHIRA  Curses blast the Tyrant  Does he assume the Name of King  OTHMAN  He does  ZAPHIRA  O Title vilely purchas'd by the Blood  Of Innocence By Treachr'y and Murder  May Heav'n incens'd pour down its Vengeance on him  Blast all his Joys and turn them into Horror  Till Phrenzy rise and bid him curse the Hour  That gave his Crimes their Birth My faithful OTHMAN  My sole surviving Prop Can'st thou devise  No secret Means by which I may escape  This hated Palace with undaunted Step  I'd roam the Waste to reach my Father's Vales  Of dear MUTIJACan no means be found  To fly these black'ning Horrors that surround me  OTHMAN  That Hope is vain The Tyrant knows thy Hate  Hence Day and Night his watchful Guards surround thee  Impenetrable as Walls of Adamant  Curb then thy mighty Griefs Justice and Truth  He mocks as Shadows Rouse not then his Anger  Let soft Persuasion and mild Eloquence  Redeem that Liberty which stern Rebuke  Wou'd rob thee of for ever  ZAPHIRA  Cruel Task  For Royalty to bowan injur'd Queen  To kneel for Liberty And Oh to whom  Ev'n to the Murd'rer of her Lord and Son  O perish first ZAPHIRA Yes I'll die  For what is Life to me My dear dear Lord  My hapless Child Yes I will follow you  OTHMAN  Wilt thou not see him then  ZAPHIRA  I will not OTHMAN  Or if I do with bitter Imprecation  More keen than Poison shot from Serpents Tongues  I'll pour my Curses on him  OTHMAN  Will ZAPHIRA  Thus

countless Woes His kindling Rage  Shall wake the Vallies into honest Vengeance  The sudden Storm shall pour on BARBAROSSA  And ev'ry glowing Warrior steep his Shaft  In deadlier Poison to revenge my Wrongs  OTHMAN  There spoke the Queen But as thou lov'st thy Freedom  Touch not on SELIM's Fate Thy Soul will kindle  And Passion mount in Flames that will consume thee  ZAPHIRA  My murder'd Son yes

Kingdoms at thy Feet  Lies conquer'd by thy Pow'r  ZAPHIRA  O BARBAROSSA  No more the Pride of Conquest e'er can charm  My widow'd Heart With my departed Lord  My Love lies bury'd I should meet thy Flame  With sullen Tears and cold Indifference  Then turn thee to some happier Fair whose Heart  May crown thy growing Love with Love sincere  For I have none to give  BARBAROSSA  Love ne'er shou'd die  'Tis the Soul's Cordial 'Tis the Fount of Life  Therefore shou'd spring eternal in the Breast  One Object lost another shou'd succeed  And all our Life be Love  ZAPHIRA  Urge me no moreThou might'st with equal Hope  Woo the cold Marble weeping o'er a Tomb  To meet thy Wishes But if gen'rous Love  Dwell in thy Breast vouchsafe me Proof sincere  Give me safe Convoy to my native Vales  Of dear MUTIJA where my Father reigns  BARBAROSSA  O blind to proffer'd Bliss what fondly quit  This lofty Palace and the envy'd Pomp  Of Empire for an Arab's wand'ring Tent  Where the mock Chieftain leads his vagrant Tribes  From Plain to Plain as Thirst or Famine sways  Obscurely vain and faintly shadows out  The Majesty of KingsFar other Joys  Here shall attend thy Call The winged Bark  For thee shall traverse Seas and ev'ry Clime  Be tributary to ZAPHIRA's Charms  To Thee exalted Fair submissive Realms  Shall bow the Neck and swarthy Kings and Queens  From the fardistant NIGER and the NILE  Drawn captive at my conqu'ring CharriotWheels  Shall kneel before thee  ZAPHIRA  Pomp and Pow'r are Toys  Which ev'n the Mind at ease may well disdain  But ah what Mockery is the tinsel Pride  Of Splendor when by wasting Woes the Mind  Lies desolate withinSuch such is mine  O'erwhelm'd with Ills and dead to ev'ry Joy  Envy me not this last Request to die  In my dear Father's Tents  BARBAROSSA  Thy Suit is vain  ZAPHIRA  Thus kneeling at thy Feet  BARBAROSSA  Thou thankless Fair  Thus to repay the Labours of my Love  Had I not siez'd the Throne when SELIM dy'd  Ere this thy Foes
