 MESSIAH  Advertisement  IN reading several passages of the prophet  Isaiah  which foretell the coming of Christ and the felicities attending it I could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of the thoughts and those in the Pollio of  Virgil  This will not seem surprising when we reflect that the Eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same subject One may judge that  Virgil  did not copy it line by line but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece I have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him though without admitting any thing of my own since it was written with this particular view that the reader by comparing the several thoughts might see how for the images and descriptions of the Prophet are superior to those of the Poet But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management I shall subjoin the passages of  Isaiah  and those of  Virgil  under the same disadvantage of a literal translation  POPE  MESSIAH A SACRED ECLOGUE In Imitation of VIRGIL's POLLIO  By ALEXANDER POPE  Esq  Printed for the PROPRIETORS and sold by all the

general exclamations of  Virgil  which make the loftiest part of his Pollio  Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo  toto surget gens aurea mundo  incipient magni procedere menses  Aspice venturo laetentur ut omnia saeclo etc  The reader needs only to turn to the passages of  Isaiab  here cited P  REMARKS  VER  Ye Heav'ns from high the dewy nectar pour  And in soft silence shed the kindly show'r  His Original says  Drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together  This is a very noble description of divine grace shed abroad in the hearts of the faithful under the Gospel dispensation And the poet understood all its force as appears from the two lines preceding these  Th' Aethereal Spirit c  The prophet describes this under the image of  rain  which chiefly fits the  first age  of the Gospel The poet under the idea of  dew  which extends it to  every age  And as it was his purpose it should be  o understood as appears from this expression of  soft silence  which agrees with the  common  not the  extraordinary  effusions of the Holy Spirit The figurative term is wonderfully happy He who would moralize the ancient Mythology in the manner of  Bac  n  must say that by the poetical  nectar  is meant theological  grace  VER  ancient fraud  i e the fraud of the Serpent  VER  He from thick films shall purge the visual ray  The sense and language shew that by  visual ray  the poet meant the  sight  or as  Milton  calls it indeed something less boldly  visual nerve  And no critic would quarrel with the figure which calls the  instrument  of vision by the name of the  cause  But though the term be just nay noble and even sublime yet the expression of  thick films  is faulty and he fell into it by a common neglect of the following rule of good writing  That when a figurative word is used whatsoever is predicated of it ought not only to agree in terms to the thing to which the figure is applied but likewise to that from which the figure is taken  Thick films  agree only with the thing to which it is applied namely to the  sight  or eve and not to that from which it is taken namely a  ray of light  coming to the eye He should have said  thick clouds  which would have agreed with both But these inaccuracies are not to be found in his later poems
