INTRODUCTION  YOUR kind indulgence I am come to ask  Whilst I pursue my arduous mimic task  The path's contracted which I've sought to tread  Chance pops each fancy'd figure in my head  No dint of labour gather'd by degrees  I can't assume an object when I please  But just when Nature throws it in my way  I take the hint and bear the form away  I would not by this mimic trade offend  My only motive is a private end  chinking the pocket  And who is here will say that I'm to blame  Since all mankind are apt to do the same  Yet some there are methinks I hear 'em too  Who cry "this fellow's plan can never do  "Damn his wry facesHe pretend to sing  "Would he were taken off but onceto swing  "Did ever mortal such an effort see  "He'd fain persuade you that he takes off me  "How could the puppy ever think to please  "No more like me than I to Hercules  mimicking Wdwd  Should I engagement seekand by the by  Should I to Aristophanes apply  The Satirist perhaps would thus reply  "Engage you sir no that can never be  "Two of a trade you know can ne'er agree  "You say I broil my characters like sprats  "And make me write a comedy of cats  "Croak too the hellish language of a crow  "When all the world can tell I don't know how  "Would you engage try to engage the town  "And then like me you'll  hobble  to renown  "Live by your wits sir that's the way to thrive  "Why how the devil do you think I live"  I'll take the hint and on myself depend  I never yet found Manager my friend  By you supported boldly I'll oppose  My mimic powers against a host of foes  Roscius shall wake and strut about the stage  And limping Proteus grin with comic rage  Feeble  Othello  shall the state address  And toothless  Shylock  lisp in  Macbeth  's dress  Declaiming  Richard  in short accents breathe  And bind his brows with a victorious wreathe  The silken sons of  Italy  shall squall  And John roastbeef in vulgar accents bawl  In fineas far as mimickry can go  At least as far as I can make it do  These and some others of the changeful crew  Shall rise for judgment to your candid view  And if some merit you shall chance to find  Some little genius in the lecturer's mind  O'erlook his failings set his heart at ease  Nor damp an ardour which aspires to please  LECTURES ON MIMICKRY  A SUDDEN transition from the gloomy shades of oblivion to the sunshine of prosperity has different effects on different objects the man of sense shews it in a modest reserve a coxcomb in a superficial glare of ostentation which renders him the laughingstock of all mankind A tomboy is always pleas'd with a new coat let it fit him ever so ill and when he should rather hide himself his vanity leads him into the great world hence he is proud of establishing a character though a ridiculous one  I beg leave to give my auditors a novel scene in another peep behind the curtain  FIDDLESTICK  Hollo you carpenters what the devil are you all about there  CARPENTER  Drawing up the clouds to make room for an Italian sky  FIDDLESTICK  Why you make such a tugging and a pulling you'll tear all the clouds to pieces  CARPENTER  Somebody has taken away the laurel from the figure of Apollo sir and we have not another in the house  FIDDLESTICK  Oh I have got that it fits me very well and I intend to wear it in the character of Apollo at the masquerade this evening There there what the devil are you about now hey  CARPENTER  'Tis only one of the ropes that snap'd  FIDDLESTICK  The devil snap you what do you mean by that do you know that the fourth part of every rope in this house belongs to me  CARPENTER  'Twas only the rope that was tied about the neck of Apollo there is rope enough left to hang all the Apollo's in England  Here Jerry Dowlas comes to offer himself  DOWLAS  A good morning sir pray sir is not your name Mr Fiddlestick  FIDDLESTICK  Timothy Fiddlestick Esq if you please  DOWLAS  I beg your pardon sir  FIDDLESTICK  Well what do you want here  DOWLAS  Sir I came to offer myself  FIDDLESTICK  Offer yourself to do what  DOWLAS  To play sir  FIDDLESTICK  Hey well what do you play the fiddle  DOWLAS  No sir  FIDDLESTICK  Can you sing  DOWLAS  No sir  FIDDLESTICK  Then I would not give a fig for you  DOWLAS  I am a tragedian sir  FIDDLESTICK  Damn your tragedies and your comedies I wish they were at the bottom of the sea with all my heart'Tis a great pity they were ever introduced upon the stagethere is more  sound  sense in a good solo or a concerto than all the tragedies and comedies in the world But here comes Mr Smallcoalyou'd better speak to him Hey what wellMr Smallcoal here is a gentleman who says he is a tragedian  SMALLCOAL  A tragedian is he  Sneering  did you ever play in any company  DOWLAS  Oh yes sir very often  SMALLCOAL  What company sir  DOWLAS  Sometimes in one company and sometimes another  SMALLCOAL  But what company sir  DOWLAS  Sometimes at the Faulcon in Fetterlane sometimes at the Horn in Doctor's Commons sometimes at the GooseandGridiron in St Paul's Churchyard  SMALLCOAL  I never saw such a goose as you are I'm sure  laughing  Can you read sir  DOWLAS  O yes sir  SMALLCOAL  Can you write  DOWLAS  Yes sir  SMALLCOAL  Then I'll be damn'd if you'll ever do for me for you fellows that write and read are always too conceited there is no making any thing of you  DOWLAS  I thought it was impossible to be an actor without such requisites sir  SMALLCOAL  You thoughtwho gave you the privilege of thinking sirthat's another proof of your stupidityan actor should never think for himself  DOWLAS  No sir  SMALLCOAL  No he should always leave that to a ManagerDid you ever hear Mrs Hartichoke  DOWLAS  No sir  SMALLCOAL  Nocall her innow you shall hear the very pattern of an actress  Enter Hartichoke  Prithee my dear girl give me your favourite speech in shoreOh she has all the charming monotony of the cuckoo  HARTICHOKE  Such is the fate unhappy women find  And such the curse entail'd upon our kind  That man the lawless libertine may rove  Free and unquestion'd thro' the wilds of love  While woman sense and nature's easy fool  If poor weak woman swerve from virtue's rule  If strongly charm'd she leave the thorny way  And in the softer paths of pleasure stray  Ruin ensues reproach and endless shame  And one false step entirely damns her fame  In vain with tears the loss she may deplore  In vain look back to what she was before  She sets like stars that fall to rise no more  SMALLCOAL  There there what do you think of her  DOWLAS  Very clever indeed Sirbut surely she could never have arriv'd at such a pitch of excellence without knowing how to write and read  SMALLCOAL  Not a word sirnot a syllableall nature and my assistancebesides when she has lost the power of actingshe will be able to get her living by squeezing oranges and lemons at a coffeehouse  squeezing his hands  DOWLAS  Sir a good morning to youI'm sorry I have been so troublesome  SMALLCOAL  So am I sir hey Fiddlestick but I am afraid you have the greatest trouble to come  DOWLAS  What trouble sir  SMALLCOAL  The trouble of taking yourself away as you came hey Fiddlestick  DOWLAS  'Tis a sad misfortune to be bit by a mad playerhowever I have one resource left yet I'll e'en to my old friend Billy Bustlehe's handandglove with Patent Patent will soon  find out my genius tho' these purblind

your Richard and yourza za zathis is a genius damn such geniusses I say  Exit  It will be acknowledged I believe that some the most ingenious of mankind who now stand dignified in the court of Fame have been often more indebted to chance than industry  Painters have drawn conversation pieces from the figures they have fancied to have seen in a fire beautiful landscapes from the broken plaister in a wallformidable caverns and terrifick mountains from the inside of a rotten cheese  Musicians have composed fav'rite airs from the creaking hinges of a door the gurgling in  the neck of a bottle or the wind whistling through some little cranny  Famous actors too have often formed their mode of speaking from the howling of a wolf the roaring of a lion or the braying of an ass  There is a modern theatrical hero "whom I have heard many praise and highly too" as Hamlet says who fell in love with the monotony of a chimney sweeper  S**th  Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths  Our stern alarms are chang'd to merry meetings  Grimvisag'd war has smooth'd his wrinkled front  And now instead of mounting barbed steeds  To fright the souls of fearful adversaries  He capers nimbly in a lady's ehamber  To the lascivious pleasing of a lute  Little Peter Pollish took his hints from a different object This gentleman has often been heard to say that a windmill was one of the most graceful structures in the world and that it always put him in mind of a flying Mercury but how he made it out heaven only knows  'tis certain he had studied the motion of a windmill and the figure of a Mercury for he had ever the action of the one and the attitude of the other 'tis said he was a profound politician too and has been often heard muttering to himself concerning the precarious and ticklish finances of poor Old England our trade declining frequent bankruptcies combustions in the state city squabbling public complainings and no  Popery  Once in a sudden gush of exclamation he broke out in a quotation from Barbarossa sometimes ingeniously making one syllable into two  S**ig*y  Now sleep and silence  beroods  o'er the  city  The devoted centinel now takes his lonely stand  And idly  dereams  of that tomorrow  Which shall never comein this  deread  interval  Oh busy thought from outward things  Descend into thyself bring with thee  Awful conscience and  firem  resolve  That in the approaching hour of blood and horror  I may stand unmov'd  And there he left off as stiff as a statue  A certain veteran of the stage perceiving a dearth of genius and the theatre in an absolute decline stood forth at seventyfive to save it from a total fall Othello he observ'd had lost his legs and Roscius his inclinationShall we for ever bid good by'e to RomeoAdieu to Castalioand farewell to Macbethno I will step forth myself and convince the world there is no occasion for leg tooth or eye to play such characters and without any of those corporeal requisites my auditors shall see that I will act them to a charm  M**k**n  If it were done when 'tis done then 'twere well  It were done quickly if th' assassination  Could trammell up the consequence and catch  With its surcease success that but this blow  Might be the  beall  and the  endall  HERE  But  here  upon this bank and shoal of time  We'd jump the life to comeBut in these cases  We still have judgment  here  that we but teach  Bloody instructions which being taught return  To plague the inventor Evenhanded justice  Returns th' ingredients of our poison'd chalice  To our own lips  Exit  End of the First Part  SECOND PART  THE Italians make the ladies the objects of their imitation Who does not laugh to hear a gigantic hero from whose appearance one might expect the roar of a bellowing Taurus warble out the commands of the conqueror of the world with the execrable squeaking of a guineapig  GAUDANI  What alas shall Orpheus do  Whither go without his love  Euridice oh answer me  I have lost my darling dove c  I know no difference there can be in this between a C*T**Y in breeches and a S***S**O in petticoats  C*T**Y  When bickerings hot  At high words got  Break out at gammyoram  The golden rule  Their flame to cool  Is push about the jorum  With fist on jug  Coifs who can hug  Or shew me that glib speaker  Who her red rag  In gibe can wag  When her mouth's brim full of liquor  'Tis not every ear that is so refin'd some will listen with more satisfaction to the natural and unaffected manner of an English singer than to the debilitated extravagance of an Italian  DU**LL**Y  With early horn  Salute the morn c  Now I will beg leave to introduce the manner of a gentleman who has a little more pudding in his voice  B*NN****R  This is sir a Jubilee  Music without Melody  Verses without harmony  That is sir a Jubilee  c c  There is generally a greater share of affectation in singers than in actors and they are frequently more indebted to art than to nature To imitate the dissonant jargon of an unpolished African requires a  mimical  capacity but no great share of vocal abilities  D*BD*N  Deer heart deer heart what a terrible life am I led c  The Italians whose ancestors were the sweetest of all poets seem to have abolished that celestial science as if they thought poetry and good sense unnecessary where there is fine singing A famous air in an Italian Opera has been literally translated thus  Where which and wherefore  There this and therefore  Paintings in still life seem to have lost their estimationbut we have capital singers in still life in high esteem who think it unnecessary to move hand or foot nay sometimes indeed even disdain to open their mouths  Mrs BAR***L***N  From morn to night alone I set  For liberty I sigh and fret  Like Robin in his cage  Mamma too kills me with her care  She tells me I am young and fair  At a bewitching age  c c  Our most sanguine wishes are frequently disappointed by the most provoking contrarieties Some there are who possess enchanting tones but are destitute of taste and on the other hand we meet with those who are endowed with every requisite but a voice When therefore a passion for imitation is guided by taste and judgment it will always give satisfaction and we are ever pleas'd to view good action fine feelings and superior taste supply the deficiency of a voice  V*RN*N  Think ah think within my breast  While contending passions reign  How my heart is robb'd of rest  And in pity ease my pain  To a lover thus distrest  Torn with doubting hopes and fears  Ev'ry moment till he's bless'd  Is a thousand thousand years  When an actor or a singer is possessed of an extravagance of action it destroys all effect of sense or sound and renders the most elegant composition farcical  Mrs B*DD**Y  The pride of all nature was sweet Willy O  The first of all swains  He gladden'd the plains  None ever was like to the sweet Willy O  None ever was like to the sweet Willy O  c c  I have heard the tree of our immortal Shakespeare celebrated in the melodious strains of an itinerant crier of wooden ware  "By my bowl or platter buy my wooden ware"  K**R  Behold this fair goblet was carv'd from the tree  Which Oh my sweet Shakespeare was planted by thee  As a relique I kiss it and bow to the shrine  What comes from thy hand must be ever divine  All shall yield to the mulberry tree  Bend to thee bless'd mulberry  Matchless was he that planted thee  And thou like him immortal be  As I have already given Mungo in distress and Amintor in love give me leave to introduce them once more in the rustic Ballad Singers  V*RN*N  Ye Warwickshire lads and ye lasses  See what at the Jubilee passes  c c  D*BD*N  Be proud of the charms of your county  Where nature has lavish'd her bounty  c c  V**N*N  Old Ben Thomas Otway John Dryden  And half a score more we take pride in  c c  D*BD*N  There never was sure such a creature  Of all she was worth he rob'd nature  c c  End of the Second Part  PART III  IT rarely happens that we meet with a ROSCIUS whose imitative genius can comprehend the great variety of human passions and arrive at superior excellence in each  There are many characters in which the figure of the figure of an actor gives us a disgust and were they possessed of every other requisite the part would always shew an awkward deficiency A crookback'd Richard six feet high will prejudice us against the characterAn Othello or a Mark Anthony have the same effect when represented by a diminutive figureBut I have seen those characters acted by a modern tragedian who hath impressed on me so strong an idea that I have sometimes thought he had just left the great originals and came to mimic them on the stage  B*R*Y  Most potent grave and reveren'd Seniors  My ever honour'd and approv'd good masters  That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter  It is most truetrue I married her  The very head and front of my offending  Hath this extentno more  It has been too often observed the managers of our theatres pay too little deference to their Kings I have seen his Majesty of Denmark represented by a gentleman who would have made an excellent waiter at a tavern and Cymbeline put into the hands of another who would have done more credit to  Snuffle  in the Mayor of Garrat than any other actor on the stage  H**ST  I've surely seen him  His favour his familiar to meBoy  Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace  I know not whyor wherefore  To say Live Boy ne'er thank thy masterlive  And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt  Fitting my bounty and thy state I'll give it  When a hero makes his complaints they should be expressed with the spirit of a hero but when he whimpers them like a schoolboy it renders him perfectly ridiculous  P*L**R  It was upon a time  A curse the clock that struck the hour  When I brought proof enough to make  The noble Leonatus mad Whereupon  Methinks I see him now  R*DD**H  Ah so thou dost Italian fiend  Ah me egregious murderer spit  And throw stones at me set  The dogs in the street at me  Let every thing be call'd Posthumous Leonatus  Oh Imogen my life my wife my Imogen  Comedy has never a better effect on our passions than when two characters are happily contrasted like light and shade in painting each serves to foil the otherthe ludicrous vociferation of a Major Sturgeon and the vacant timidity of a Jerry Sneak give a double satisfaction being opposed to each other  DIALOGUE  Aristophanes  F**TE  Billy Buckram  W*ST*N  BUCKRAM  Your servant Master Stophanes  ARISTOPHANES  Ah what my little waddling swaddling

warrant you'll roar like a lion in spight of your teeth  BUCKRAM  But shan't I make use of the same charm to you Master 'Stophanes  ARISTOPHANES  I beg to be excusedI have my part by heart For instance what mob can stand this  brays like an ass  away they runThere's a touch for you  BUCKRAM  A touch indeed  ARISTOPHANES  Now what is the next scene  BUCKRAM  Nay I can't tell  ARISTOPHANES

of a murderer or a methodist  End of the Third Part  JERRY SNEAK's RETURN FROM THE REGATTA  I'M just come from 'Gatta am drench'd like a hound  'Tis twenty to one that I had not been drown'd  There were wife and myself and some brave jolly boys  In a sixoar'd cutter amidst all the noise  When a blundering broadbottom'd country barge  Came bearing down on usand then to our charge  We were all overset should surely have sunk  And have gone to the bottom if we had not been drunk  There was ne'er a one dead of us all but my wife  But they tow'd her to shore and soon brought her to life  She was dead as a fish and as pale as a clout  But they rubb'd her and scrubb'd her and roll'd her about  'Till they made her to talk and to walk and to see  And now she's as blithe and as brisk as a bee  But we boarded our cutter and ventur'd again  Determin'd to see what there was to be seen  Such a wonderful possy of pennants and colours  Such splashing and dashing with oars and scullers  Skiffs wherries and barges all huddl'd together  Such crying for shelter on account of the weather  The people on shore who paid pounds for a seat  Got wet to the skin and were glad to retreat  While we on the Thames were so snug and so quiet  Amidst all the rain all the racket and riot  There were courtiers and cits and the gay savageweavers  With fifes and with drums with bones and with cleavers  The men were all red and the women all white  Oh what a beautiful wonderful sight  The like I ne'er saw since born of my mother  Should I live 'till I die I should ne'er see another  For should I have been drowned again and again  I'd have gone every day such a sight to have seen  There's nothing in drowning you know nowadays  They've found out such wonderful comical ways  Were you dead as a stone you've no reason to fear  They'll bring you to life with a flea in your ear  The barges some look'd like a body of gold  Some new ones were made  out of those that were old  With awnings of silk with some figure or trinket  And many were coveredwith nought but a blanket  With whitelead and blacklead with paint and with pitch  Some large and some small some ragged some rich  Such a sight such a noise and such a sweet smell  Was never yet equal'd on earth or in hell  But we got to the gardens and landed at last  In hopes to partake of the princely repast  The tables were cover'd with many a thing  You'd have thought they'd set out a fine feast for a king  The aldermen fix'd 'em each man to his plate  One took off his wig and then rubbing his pate  Look'd eagerly round with a face of despair  For fear that he should not come in for his share  Then stuck his knife greedily into a ham  Unbutton'd his waistcoat his stomach to cram  Laid bones of fat capons in many a heap  That he eat and he drank till he fell fast asleep  I was hungry too for as I am a sinner  I'd ne'er a spare minute to get me a dinner  So took me a plate and then slily sate down  Determin'd to get me  a bit of the brown  Was resolv'd to have it the risque of my life  In spight of that termagant teazer my wife  But I'd scarcely got down a good mouthful or two  Before she came up and made such ado  Cry'd I never should more go with her to a feast  Said I look'd like a hog that I eat like a beast  I'd have look'd if I could still more like a swine  Would have swill'd all the night but could get me no wine  And mine was the fate too often out of twenty  There was nought but the artful appearance of plenty  To canal next I went and there dipp'd in my hat  To get me some waterthere was plenty of that  I heard some of the people most bitterly curse  But I took it like marriage the better for worse  The people all round seem'd in wonderful pother  Did nothing but grumble and look at each other  To me it appear'd like a scene of confusion  Without a beginning or without a conclusion  All the folks that wereTurk Christian or Jew  Seem'd plaguely puzzl'd to know what to do  By the fate of St Peter and well too they might  'Twas the very first time they had seen such a sight  'Twas a kind of rehearsal where none knew his part  To act a Regatta's a wonderful part  There was none of them perfect to be sure it was plain  'Twill be much better done when they play it again  But they all from that day have been fond of the water  Not a father or mother not a son or a daughter  But what have sate off for a draught or a dip  To get themselves cur'd of the scurvy and hyp  Oh were you at Margate Southampton or Brighton  To see them all sous'd'tis enough to delight one  'Tis sheepsheering time so they go there to feast  The first to be wash'd well and then to be fleec'd  The townsmen have all got a wonderful knack  Of touching your pocket and stroking your back  But give them a chance once of taking a pull  At a fat golden fleece and they'll have all his wool  If you would not be apt now to think it too long  I'd finish my story good folks with a song  SONG The BOOKS of BRIGHTON Tune  Cold and raw the North doth blow  I  The country is moorish  The natives are boorish  Tho' ignorant yet they are cunning  These are excellent places  If you're of false faces  With abundance of fleecing and funning  II  I wish you much pleasure  And mirth without measure  My wishes I'm sure they are fervent  You may all believe me  I do not deceive ye  So believe me your most humble servant  End of the Fourth Part  A LECTURE ON LECTURES By LANCELOT LAST As delivered with Applause in the COMIC MIRROUR Written by G S CAREY  LADIES and Gemmen I am going presently as you will presently find to give you a Lecture on Lectures but first and foremast I think it necessary that I should give some account of myself because why a man who can give no account of himself is to all intents and purposes a  vagram  First as to my name Lancelot Last at your service by trade when I used to follow it a Shoemaker but happening to see one of your lectures in our town I was inspired as it were  and knowing him to be no better a  schollard  than myself I took off my  apron  threw down my  lapstone  kick'd up my  last  gave up my  awl  and so sate off to lecture  I was a long time before I could determine with myself what subject to begin upon at last  Stronomy  came into my head but I found the stars were out of my reach and whenever I dipp'd into that science I was presently lost as it were in a cloud  Then  Ottamy  came into my head I was at home to a peg in  Ottomy  for as to plucking out a tooth picking out a corn or curing the gripes nobody is more skilful than myself but when I came to the  imputation  of a leg and as I am naturally tenderhearted I found it too  cutting  a business for me  Then says I to myself what think'st thou Lancelot Last of Chymistry I thought as how that business was something in my way for as to your  consalves  and  presarves  nobody is more  larned  in that way than myself but then  thinks  I again some of my auditors may have an objection to the name of physic and physic nowadays is nothing but a  drug  Then Heraldry came into my head but happening to see the king's arms on a hackneycoach I thought the dignity of that science was gone to the dogs  I was advised by a friend to set about Midwifery But my mind was big with a thousand apprehensions whenever I thought on midwifery so I gave it up because I thought I should never be able to  deliver  myself on that subject  I would have set about a Lecture on Heads but my friend Alexander Stevens had dissected every head in the kingdom so well that I should have been set down as one of his  blockheads  if I had meddled with ever a one  I thought the  Heart  would be no bad subject but I could find so very few good ones that I had not a heart to set about it  Thinking of bad hearts put the  Law  into my head and I thought a Lecture on the Law would be no bad thing then says I to myself the Law is no good thing in itself but would it not be better if I could make a good subject out of it I thought and I ponder'd about it 'till I found  myself like a poor fly in a cobweb The law always puts me in mind of a coffinonce in your never out again  If none of these subjects will do what in the name of Lucifer will doLucifer who the devil is LuciferA great orator mayhap Oddsbobbs an oratorIt directly came into my head that a lecture on oratory would be the best thing I could set about and so I begins my lecture on oratory  Ladies and gemmen now according to the learned and I am something of a  schollard  myself Oratory means jawing because why why because no orator can speak without his jaws perhaps you'll think I can't give you a Latin  devination  for it now you'll find yourselves mistaken what is English for  Os  why bon  to be sure and the jaws being full of bones▪ they are  fix'd  proofs that the word oratory comes from  Os  Now I think it is necessary that you should know what an orator isand what is it you will say I answer it is a manand what is he to doI answer to speak wordsand  what are wordsI answer letters put together but there can be no word without a  wowel  because why why do you see because they can't  What are the necessary qualities of an oratorThe first he must spit then wipe his mouth then lay his hand upon his heart then turn up his eyes then out comes a word then another follows it and then like a post horse let him get on as fast as he can  An orator should be a good mimic too Oddsbobbs now I talk of mimics I must take care what I am about for I am surrounded by mimics here and they will be for taking me off perhaps now you shall see I will save them the trouble and take off myself  going off  FINIS
