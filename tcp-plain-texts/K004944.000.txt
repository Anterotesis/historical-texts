 FALDONI AND TERESA  By MR JERNINGHAM  IS IT IN HEAV'N A CRIME TO LOVE TOO WELL  POPE  A NEW EDITION  LONDON PRINTED FOR J ROBSON BOOKSELLER NEW BONDSTREET M DCC LXXIII  ADVERTISEMENT  The following poem is founded on a very singular Event that happened near Lyons in the month of June Two Lovers FALDONI and TERESA MEUNIER meeting with an invincible obstacle to their union determined to put an end to their existence with pistols The place they chose for the execution of their terrible project was a chapel that stood at a little distance from the house They even decorated the altar for the occasion they also paid a particular attention to their own dress TERESA was dressed in white with rosecoloured Ribbands The same coloured Ribbands were tied to the pistols Each held the Ribband that was fastened to the other's trigger which they drew at a signal agreed upon  Arria and Paetus says Monsieur de Voltaire set the example but then it must be considered they were condemned to death by a tyrant whereas love was the only inventor and perpetrator of the deed we have recordedSee  Questions sur L'Encyclopedie Articles De caton et de suicide  See also a book entitled  Les Tableaux  by the Marquis de Pezai  FALDONI AND TERESA  TO you ye sons of France the Muse appeals  To vouch the truth of what she now reveals  Say have ye not beheld what love can dare  When torn with grief and prompted by despair  Still urg'd by pity ye bewail their doom  Still to the traveller ye mark the tomb  Where sleep from tyrant laws and sorrows free  The youthful victims of their own decree  Allruling Love the God of Youth possess'd  Entire dominion of FALDONI's breast  An equal flame did sympathy impart  A flame destructive to TERESA's heart  As on one stem two opening flowers respire  So grew their life entwin'd on one desire  Yet lest their hopes parental power should blast  Still o'er their love her veil Concealment cast  Near to the mansion on a secret spot  Meet haunt for lovers rose a sylvan grot  True to the stated moment still they came  Here breath'd the vow here fed the mutual flame  Here form'd to list'ning Heaven the firm resolve  Which power nor fate averse shou'd e'er dissolve  This grot the confident of ev'ry fear  This kind recess that bosom'd ev'ry tear  Where oft the impassion'd soul they did assuage  Urg'd by a warmth congenial to their age  Still they devoted to the pow'r above  And fondly call'd the Temple of their Love  Once as they hasten'd to this still retreat  The mutual object of their wish to meet  FALDONI saw the beauteous maid distress'd  Her cheek with terror and alarm imprest  Saw rais'd to Heav'n her supplicating eyes  As if to deprecate the vengeful skies  'Ah speak he cried with anxious wonder fraught  'What undivided care employs thy thought'  In accents suited to the strain of woe  TERESA thus indulg'd her thoughts to flow  'The cloud which long has threaten'd to destroy  'With rage redoubled bursts upon our joy  'Ev'n thro' the friendly veil Concealment wove  'There are who mark'd the progress of our love  'To pity dead and Nature's stronger claim  'A fatherWhence does he usurp that name  'Ah had thine eyes beheld the cruel scene  'As with indignant and tremendous mien  'While to his mercy kneeling I applied  'With barb'rous hand he flung me from his side  'And bad meOh insensible of heart  'Far from his angry presence to depart  'UnlessCan I pronounce his dread demand  'I wou'd from thee withdraw this plighted hand  'Behold me banish'd from my native home  'To thee a hapless fugitive I come  'Bent to the ground beneath Misfortune's show'r  'Affliction's bride a father's curse my dow'r  'Yet why complain still happy in thy love  'What more can earth bestow or Heaven above  'For this are daughters born FALDONI cried  'To fall the victims of parental pride  'When nature youth and sympathy unite  'Say shall a father's voice forbid the rite  'Shall he with cruel and relentless hands  'O'erthrow the altar tear the nuptial bands  'But thou with love and virtue shall combine  'To break the law that bids thee not be mine  'Still shall the lov'd TERESA be my bride  'Not Fortune's gifts to which thou art allied  'In my attachment claim'd their venal part  'I fought what love requires a tender heart  'Tho' wreck'd despoil'd of Fortune's golden store  'Rich only in thy heart I prize thee more  'With me ascend yon Alpinean height  'Let Italy's bright sun illume our flight  'There haply there at our disastrous tale  'In some kind breast compassion may prevail  'In vainfor busy apprehension still  'Alarms my love and traverses my will  'Worn with the labours of the length'ning way  'Should'st thou sink down to weariness a prey  'If in that moment by thy father led  'Of Russians thou should'st hear the thund'ring tread  'What wou'd my rage by love impell'd avail  'If as the coward numbers shou'd prevail  'Thou most ador'd thou blest with every charm  'They still shou'd tear thee from this vanquish'd arm  'Not all their cruelty the fair rejoin'd  'Shall ever boast a conquest o'er my mind  'Ne'er shall they wrest this heart still uncontrol'd  'From Constancy's embrace and Passion's hold  'If to the law that bids me not be thine  'One more severe a father shou'd adjoin  'To rescue still my soul from that distress  'A thought enbosom'd in this heart's recess  'Shou'd rising into actAh spare the rest  'Say can't thy fancy my resolve suggest  'This poniard  'Greatly thought the youth reply'd  'Be bolder still and let my voice decide  'The ills to come why tremblingly await  'Ah rather meet inevitable fate  'Let us since life with foul and haggard mien  'Holds to our wishes but a desert scene  'To Death's dread region urge our daring way  'And quit the aspect of the living day  'I give she cry'd this breast 'tis thine to bleed  'Ah more than give I glory in the deed  'Unfold the meansthe instruments prepare  'All all that daring Love can do I dare  The youth rejoin'd 'When o'er the silent world  'The hand of Darkness has her veil unfurl'd  'When thro' her mid career the Night has run  'Shall warranted by Love a deed be done  'Which not the records of Distress can show  'Thro' the long page of lovecreated woe  'The sacred wall of this sequester'd spot  'That's doom'd to witness our unhappy lot  'Shall an eternal monument proclaim  'Affection's triumph and parental shame  'Ev'n to the tomb where sorrow shall repose  'Where Pity's hand our ashes shall enclose  'Her num'rous train posterity shall lead  'And to her children thus unfold the deed  '  Here    hallow'd spot    Love's martyrs rest secure    '  Ah what they suffer'd may ye ne'er endure  'But why to vain discourse thus idly give  'The precious momentswhile I talk we live'  The stated hour at length approaching near  Th' unhappy youth beheld devoid of fear  See to the grot the faithful maid repair  Prepar'd to act the counsel of despair  With eager arms he strain'd her to his breast  And thus the purpose of his soul express'd  'See rear'd by me yon sacred altar stands  'Adorn'd with lights and dress'd with flow'ry bands  'See near the cross in silken chains array'd  'The ready instruments of Death display'd  'Nor pale regret nor doubt the coward's train  'Shall dare the orgies of this night profane  'But intrepidity that life disdains  'And breaks Oh Prejudice thy pow'rful chains  'With Confidence that lifts her raptur'd eye  'To meet the future blessings of the sky  'And chearfulness whitevested as a bride  'With blueey'd Pleasure walking at her side  'Delightful band shall to yon altar move  'To celebrate the festival of Love  'But say TERESA do these eyes mislead  'Or dost thou tremble at the hallow'd deed  'Yes treach'rous fear thy troubled aspect pales  'Ah lost FALDONIthy companion fails  'Wil't thou departing from thy first design  'Submit to liveyet will I not repine  'Shall at my voice that beauty cease to bloom  'And does my love condemn thee to the tomb  'Shal't thou in flow'r of youth resign thy life  'And smile in death to be FALDONI's wife  'The base th'ungen'rous wish I now disown  'FALDONI acts the tragic scene alone  'In pity leave me to my own despair  'Nor stay to witness what thou must not share  'Returnthy presence my resolve disarms  'Returnand bless an aged father's arms  'Tell him the youth by beauty's charm beguil'd  'Who taught rebellion to his only child  'Urg'd by that fatal passion is no more  'Slain by his hand and welt'ring in his gore  'Oh dire resolve the heartpierc'd mourner cries  'Joy sinks for ever when FALDONI dies  'Yet yet reflectreverse the cruel doom  'Still let me snatch thee from the youthful tomb  'There faithful Love resigns his sacred fires  'Remembrance sickens and bright hope expires  In vain he added life unfolds her charms  'While she withholds thee from these widow'd arms  'Depriv'd of thee the world's a desert shore  'Round which the surges beat and tempests roar  ''Tis wisdom then to launch into the main  'And seek the clime where happier seasons reign  'Enoughmay length of days and joy be thine  'Let truth let constancy and death be mine'  The fair indignant said'Too hasty youth  'He who suspects first breaks the law of truth  'Did not this bosom first by passion taught  'Conceive unprompted the intrepid thought  'Did not this voice first speak the bold decree  'To perish rather than be false to thee  'Mark how these hands have deck'd this little form  'To grace the rites I'm destin'd to perform  'Behold me now impatient selfdecreed  'The gaudy victim at Love's shrine to bleed  'Thou glory of thy sex the youth replied  'O'erwhelm'd and lost in passion's rushing tide  'My sense was drown'dnow to thy merit just  'Ev'n to thy courage as thy love I trust  'That courage welcomes spoke the beauteous maid  'This terrorshedding scene for death array'd  'Yet then Religion acts her rigid part  'Forbear she cries and damps the boldest heart  'Methinks I view wide op'ning at my feet  'Form'd by an angry God the direful seat  'Now now I hear infernal voices call  'And from the gulph fiends beckon us to fall  'Ev'n as I hasten'd to this bless'd retreat  'The vow that love had witness'd to compleat  'The darken'd air sent forth a voice unknown  'That shriek'd my namethe forest breath'd a groan  'Illomen'd birds across my passage flew  'And frighten'd Nature shudder'd at my view  'To airy nothing give the youth rejoin'd  'From whence they sprung these spectres of the mind  'Ah know meek homage can that God assuage  'And turn to clemency awaken'd rage  'What he the most requires thou can'st impart  ''Tis Virtue's offering an unspotted heart  'Let us implore him at yon altar's base  'To bless our deed with his absolving grace  'Which as the sun whose vivifying ray  'Gilds the dark cloud that wou'd obscure the day  'Will gild within the dark'ning thoughts that roll  'And beautify the purpose of our soul  'Then shall the host of saints at Virtue's call  'Behold our act and consecrate our fall'  He spokewhen guided by a rage divine  Th'enthusiast led her to the sacred shrine  Then as their bended knee the ground impress'd  He thus aloud the throne of grace address'd  'Thou who did'st form our mutual hearts to glow  'With all the feelings that the tender know  'Behold us by a parent's voice withheld  'From rites connubial and from joy expell'd  'Free of remorse the guilty feel we die  'To thee from woes and tyrantlaws we fly  'Ah from our fears remove thy vengeful rod  'And be at once our Father and our God'  Now on the fair FALDONI cast his eye  While halfsuppress'd arose compassion's sigh  'Prepare he said the tragic scene to close  'And shun the fate that ironhearts impose  'Yet when I think if stern parental pow'r  'Had to our wishes giv'n the nuptial hour  'Life might have wing'd its way supremely blest  'By fortune favour'd and by love carest  'Ah wonder not these tears unbidden flow  'That round thy form these arms encircling grow  'That not ev'n Wisdom's dictates can control  'The grief that harrows up my bleeding soul  'Yet will I not too lavishly complain  'A future world may recompence our pain  'Ah in that world shou'd we too blest rejoin  'No father there shall traverse Love's design  'Thee to my hope shou'd fav'ring Heav'n bestow  'Ah let us love as we have lov'd below  'Tho' flatt'ring Hope she said inform your breast  'This bosom owns not such a welcome guest  'Tho' Passion's torch illume the path we tread  'Drear is the passage to the silent dead  'Yet not the less do I consent to steer  'Thro' this tremendous sea of doubt and fear  'The dread omniscient pow'r who rules above  'Still sees my fears subjected to my love  'I gowhate'er that pow'r shall now ordain  'To view thy bliss or to divide thy pain  Lo near the instruments of death they stand  To which they reach a bold determin'd hand  'Oh unexampled fair FALDONI said  'To life's pale confines by thy lover led  'Think not these engines destin'd to destroy  'Ah rather deem them hallow'd keys of joy  'Whose magic pow'r to screen from future woes  'Eternity's bright portal shall unclose  'Then shall TERESA from each care releas'd  ''Mid angels take her radiant seat'  He ceas'd  'Yet ere she cried we meet th' impending doom  'Yet ere we sink into th' untimely tomb  'Let me reclining on that tender heart  'The farewell accents of my love impart  'Methinks we stand beneath Death's hov'ring pall  'Pass one short moment and we both must fall  'One momentand dire ruin shall deface  'Sent from this thund'ring tube each living grace  'That form which still I view shall know decay  'And all that beauty be the graveworm's prey  'Distracting thoughtWho spoke the dread command  'Who with this fiery weapon arm'd this hand  'Born by the torrent of distress away  'My lost afflicted thoughts from reason stray  'Forgive this weaknessworthy still of thee  'I'm still prepar'd to fall at Love's decree  See now FALDONI draw aside the vest  And to the sight reveal his naked breast  As if impatient to embrace his fate  He griev'd one instant had prolong'd his date  This scene the firmness of her mind appalls  And all her wonted tenderness recalls  'Is it for me that breast with blood to stain  'And pierce that heart with agonizing pain  'That feeling heartwhere ev'ry virtue glows  'Where I possess the rank that love bestows  'The voice of Nature sure forbids the deed  'Ne'er shall FALDONI by this engine bleed  'On me on me it now shall act its part  'She said and boldly held it to her heart  FALDONI swiftly seiz'd her daring hand  And spoke'Ah what has thy distraction plann'd  'The sacred plan that Love ordain'd recall  'Slain by each other's willing arm to fall  'Now heav'n methinks with our resolve conspires  'And o'er yon tapers sheds the purest fires  'Gives to yon twining wreaths a brighter bloom  'And o'er the censor breaths divine perfume  'While mystic emblems of eternal day  'Above the altar lambent glories play'  She added'faithful to thy just demand  'I'll now direct this deathentrusted hand  'And now at length I take the parting view  'Ah now these lips pronounce the last adieu  'FALDONI Oh my treasure Oh my pride  'In life in love in death to me allied  'May saints prepare the garland for thy brow  'Farewellto yonder conscious shrine I vow  'This voice which faintly pours its closing strain  'Shall never utter thy fond name again'  They now approach to give the fatal wound  While trembling Expectation hovers round  One solemn moment they reserve to pray'r  And now the dire explosion rends the air  They falland to the awful pow'r above  Resign the tortur'd soul of hopeless love  Unhappy victims tho' cold reason hear  Your mournful story with unheeding ear  Tho' pious zealots at your death exclaim  Still sacred Pity consecrates your name  Ev'n stern Religion as she sees you bleed  Lets fall a tear and halfabsolves the deed
